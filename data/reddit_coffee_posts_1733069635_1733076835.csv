I’m basically looking for friends whom I can hang out with, whether it’s going to parties, strolling around town, or late night conversations! I just don’t want to be lonely especially since I just moved in!

Here are some stuff about me (brace yourselves for this relatively long intro):

- First off my friends would probably say that I’m a walking ray of sunshine or that I give off golden retriever energy, but I cannot really confirm that since I don’t really see that in me! Though I am very talkative and jovial especially if I warm up to you! People would say that I am super energetic at most times though!

- I also love to talk and yap! People say that I’m an intellectual kind of person (again I might have to disagree) since I graduated from a university overseas in a STEM field (I don’t really like it though, let’s just say I majored in STEM out of pragmatism). I do have lots of stories to tell about my life abroad but we can talk about anything under the sun! I love popular culture and social commentary, but I would prefer if we talk about ourselves, our ambitions, and our experiences just so that we get to know about each other first (though we can always talk about our interests).

- My MBTI is INFJ and my love language is spending quality time, so I am looking for constants whom I can hang out or have conversations with! Of course we can chat or call first, but I’m the kind of person who likes doing stuff together with friends be it baking, shopping, movies, or even partying! We can go out and eat together or go for coffee as well! 

- My hobbies and interests include music and dancing! I love K-Pop if you haven’t seem my title above HAHA. I just love their artistry so I usually listen to them, watch their antics, and attend their concerts if I have the time! Feel free to ask me about my favorite groups as well or you can guess! I don’t really mind if we have the same interests but I’m just putting this out there in case you do! I can also give you recommendations or songs that remind me of you if you want as well! Aside from K-Pop I love ballads and R&B- I also play the piano in my spare time (though getting rusty because I don’t really have much time anymore)

- Another favorite hobby of mine is traveling (particular air travel since I am an aviation geek)! Have been to a handful of countries (I’m the kind of person who would revisit them especially if I love the place). Feel free to ask me about my experiences abroad or how I feel about traveling and airlines! 

I’m sure that’s a mouthful, if you want to hang out or have a late night talk with me feel free to send me a message! I’m also looking for constant and genuine connections so I’m just hoping that you can make an effort as well (I promise to reciprocate your energy)! And hopefully you can introduce yourself as well and we’ll take it from there (it doesn’t have to be a super comprehensive intro like mine so long as it isn’t a simple one-line). That’s all and I hope to see you around!",1,1733076535.0,PhR4Friends,0,1.0,False

1h49aav,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1h49aav,New to the Game,"Hey everybody excited to be part of this group! So I started this journey when my wife got me a Nespresso a few years back. Yes I know, whipped coffee, but it was good to my tastebuds then (and now when I am hankering and dont have time). That led me to craving for actual espresso I was pulling from a basic Delonghi, which was great, and my wife got me again another appliance (woohoo!), a KitchenAid burr coffee grinder. At that point, I was mostly interested in fine fine grind and this hit it just fine for me.

This then progressed me to craving coffee that was single origin, and I have a nice roaster in my neighborhood callled Southdown that’s pretty good. But…they have a pour steady that made me an amazing pour over of a light roast. Ive been chasing my own pour over cup at home ever since, for about the past 12 months, which has become my everyday routine. Been exposing myself to a number of awesome roasters and coffee.

But. I am still grinding with the Kitchenaid conical burr. It’s consistent, but I feel like I am losing my mind attempting to dial it in. The “medium” is 35 (out of 70 grind settings) looks too fine to me. This was my most recent post-pour over, and had it set at 18.

The answer I am sure is to upgrade my grinder. And I am going to purchase one that grinds up to the 35-45 g range. But any pointers with this KitchenAid until I pull the trigger? Or just trash it!

“W-what the hell are we supposed to do now?” Dustin asked as he looked around, completely dumbfounded. Guess they didn’t cover rogue revenant showdowns on his detective’s exam.

“The only thing we can do,” I answered after thinking over our less than optimal options. I then cocked my crossbow and steadily started towards the dark recesses of the warehouse. “Make sure both of them make it out of this alive.”

He nodded, coming back to his senses. Then he took charge- where he should be- overtaking my stride and leading the way.

We traversed down a concrete tunnel-like hallway that was covered in graffiti, following Sage’s voice as it reverberated off the walls. By the sound of it, she was having  one of those villainous monologue moments that takes place right before an epic battle. “You really don’t remember anything, do you?”

Dustin and I finally reached the end of the hallway. It opened up to a lofted balcony with a staircase leading down to the main floor. Cautiously, we walked over to the railing and peeked over.

The first floor was the size of a football field. Empty, rusted, and broken down storage shelves and equipment were everywhere. Deep in a back corner, it looked like someone had set up a makeshift living room. There were a couple couches, a coffee table, and rug- all orientated around the mounted tv. I realized then where we were. This place was Fake Sage’s old nest.

In the open center of the warehouse, Sage and Rudy were slowly walking circles around each other.

Moonlight started to filter in through the exposed rafters of a large portion of collapsed ceiling, giving us a clear visual on the two supernaturals. Because of all the dust floating in the air, that was probably the only time I’d ever see a vampire sparkle.

I figured she looked young by the sound of her voice, and I’d been right. Sage couldn’t have been older than twenty-five when she was turned. Curtain bangs framed her slim face. Long, dirty blonde hair, fell down in loose waves around her shoulders. Sage’s boho hairstyle, acid wash bell-bottom jeans, and flared pink blouse made her look like a hippie.

“Nope,” Rudy said with a snarl, putting his fists up, ready to fight. “All I know, is I gotta overwhelming urge to rip your face off.”

Sage jerked forward, snapping her jaw shut like a shark. Rudy flinched back slightly before quickly steadying himself.

“C’mon, then,” Sage goaded as her eyes flashed red, waving him towards her. “Try your best, revenant.”

Accepting the challenge, Rudy shook the tension out of his wrists and cracked his neck.

I pivoted to make my way down the stairs and nip this in the bud before it could even begin, but Dustin quickly grabbed my shoulder and stopped me.

“Unless you want to get your head torn off, I suggest we stay up here for the time being. It looks like things are about to get pretty ugly.”

Despite the overwhelming urge to go down there and try to take control of the situation anyway, I stayed. Dustin was right, getting caught in the crossfire wouldn’t help anybody. All we could do was let the inevitable happen and moderate from the sidelines.

“Oh, I’m *so* going to enjoy kicking your ass!” Sage giggled after dodging Rudy’s first attack. He’d put a lot of momentum behind his punch, so he stumbled forward past her when his fist didn’t connect with anything.

With an evil grin, she wound her elbow up and struck him in the spine. Rudy squeaked as he fell to the ground with a thud, the wind knocked out of him.

He spit, turning to face his opponent. “Savor that sting in your arm, sweetie. That’s the first and last hit you’re going to get in.” Rudy seemed to fly as he kick-up’d off the ground.

Sage cracked her knuckles confidently. “We’ll see about that.”

What ensued looked like a fight straight out of a Saturday morning cartoon. The two of them seemed to be swept up in a twirling tornado as they used their paranormal capabilities, struggling to keep the upper hand over the other.

Dustin and I were afraid to blink with how hard the fight was to follow. We would miss a devastating blow here or a gut wrenching kick there if we did.

However, the tide of the fight seemed to turn in Rudy’s favor after Sage had kicked him to the ground for the umpteenth time. Instead of immediately getting back to his feet like usual, he managed to grab the broken off section of a storage shelf. He swung with all his might, socking Sage right in the face, sending her whole body flying.

I could tell something in him snapped then. His eyes seemed to glow brighter, his fangs got longer and sharper. Even his nails seemed to become thick talons. Rudy’s eyes got dark as he went feral, jumping on top of Sage before she had a chance to get back up again.

A chill went down my spine as a pained roar echoed through the warehouse as he punched, slapped, kicked, and clawed. Sage’s screams filled the empty space.

“I’m going to shoot!” Dustin said, aiming his crossbow right at Rudy’s heart.

“No, don’t!” I lunged for his weapon, pushing  it right as he released the trigger. The trajectory of the stake veered off to the right, whistling past Rudy’s ear and landing in a pile of rubble. He didn’t seem to notice. “We’re not authorized to!”

“*God damn it*, Lucy, look at him!” Dustin yelled at me, reloading the crossbow. “He’s going to tear her to shreds and we need her alive!”

“We also need him alive,” I reminded him, harshly gripping his forearm. “He’s a victim here too!”

I pointed down at Rudy as he continued wailing on Sage. “Look.”

Dustin leaned closer and squinted his eyes. That’s when he noticed the black bloody tears flowing from the revenants eyes. Rudy was sobbing. “Why are you fighting so hard for him all of a sudden?” He questioned. “You wanted him dead earlier.”

The pained expression of guilt and loss on Rudy’s face as he cried felt all too familiar. It resonated within me. “I- I don’t know…”

“Well you better figure out how to get him out of that trance then,” Dustin said with a scoff. “That monster will leave nothing left.”

“That’s it, Dustin, you’re a genius! I could kiss you right now,” I stated, grabbing his cheeks and squishing them together making his lips pop out like a fish before gunning it to the railing.

“Rudy,” I called. My voice fell upon deaf ears as he was still focused on destroying the vampire’s every atom. “Rudy, don’t do this, please!”

He continued to scrape and tear faster than Sage’s vampiric healing could keep up with. If I didn’t do something soon she’d be beyond saving.

“*Rudy!*” I screamed at the top of my lungs, almost falling over the railing as it started to rattle. “You’re a **monster.**”

He paused as soon as the word passed through my lips. While he’d stopped, Rudy’s eyes were still looking down at Sage; but his ears were listening to me. I’d somehow managed to get through to him. Not wasting the opportunity, I continued.

“You do this, Rudy, you kill her? You become a monster.”

“So what?” He snapped, wrapping his hand around Sage’s throat and squeezing. She let out a soft groan. “She deserves it.”

Running the risk of sounding like a pick-me girl, I said, “This isn’t you.”

“And how would you know?” Rudy hissed. “You don’t know me. Hell, I don’t even know myself!”With one hand, he lifted Sage up by the neck. She started to gasp out for air and claw at his wrists, but to no avail.

“Maybe I am a monster.”

“Yeah, maybe, but you don’t have to be. I know your type, you despise monsters. Don’t become the thing you despise. If not for yourself,” I grabbed the Polaroid that Dustin had stolen from the Old Brooks Motel crime scene out of my pocket and tossed it over the edge. The photo fluttered through the air in a random zig-zag pattern before landing right at Rudy’s feet. His eyes flickered to the picture. You could see the gears start turning in his head as he desperately tried to remember his loved ones. Then they moved to the reflection in the standing puddle of water right above it, taking in the truly nightmarish features that stared back, before going back to the photo. “…then for them.”

Rudy stood there for a moment before the brown returned to his eyes. He tossed Sage down to the ground like a rag doll with a grunt, “fine.”

His eyes glowed red again, staring down at the battered woman, trying to figure out what he’d done for her to cause so much pain and damage. He was about to lose control again, but Rudy roughly slapped himself out of it. Shoving his hands into his pockets, walking away and kicking a non existent rock instead.

Right as Dustin and I were about to go down and retrieve the vampire, slight movement and a weak chuckle came from behind Rudy. She was still, somehow, *awake.*

“You see, you may be a little stronger and a smidge faster than me, revenant,” Sage spat, her breaths uneven and weak. Slowly, she peeled her upper half off the ground. “But I have something you don’t have.”

“Yeah?” Rudy asked, still sulking, “what’s that?”

“Experience. I’ve been a vampire for almost fifty years now and here’s the most important thing I’ve learned-“

“Rudy!” I called out after seeing her lick up stray flecks of his blood from the floor. Her pupils exploded as she got the energy boost she needed. I tried to warn him, seeing her get up before he did, but he turned around to face me.

“*Never* let yourself get distracted in a fight.” Sage decked Rudy in the face pretty good, busting his right cheek wide open. She gripped his shoulders tightly and leaned in real close, whispering, “You might have won this battle, but we’ll see who wins the war.”

Taking advantage of him standing there, still stunned from her attack, Sage made a mad dash for the exit. I flew down the stairs trying to get to both her and Rudy in time. Dustin stayed at the top of the loft, quickly drawing his crossbow. The tip of one stake narrowly missed the vampire’s head as she ran. Dustin booked it down the flight of stairs as well, meeting up with me at the bottom step. Two more shots fired in rapid succession- both missed.

At this point, I’m *really* starting to think he should log a couple more hours at the shooting range.

Sage then disappeared, her words echoing through the air as she escaped into the night. “This isn’t over!”

A thick tension filled the warehouse as the weight of the reality of our situation set in. Our primary suspect, and vampiric serial killer, had just escaped. *Shit.*

Rudy broke the silence. “I roughed her up pretty good,” he said out of breath, wiping off some black blood dripping from the wound on his cheek. “Doubt she’ll make it far.”

This set Davidson off. In a rage, Dustin went and kicked the back of Rudy’s knee, sending the small man to the ground. He yanked the revenant’s wrists behind his back before double cuffing him. He picked him up by the armpit and started hauling ass back to the liftback.

Not knowing what else to do, and stuck in a flurry of my own thoughts, I absentmindedly followed behind them.

“I just saved your ass! This is really how you’re going to repay me?” Rudy retorted after a particularly harsh shove.

Dustin suddenly skittered to a stop. “Saved? *Saved?!* You broke out of prison and overtook our whole operation!” He pinched the bridge of his nose and sighed, “Not to mention you went berserk back there and almost killed our main suspect!”

“What else did you want me to do?” Rudy asked defensively. “I can *guarantee* that the two of you would’ve ended up as vampire chow if you’d went in alone. The only reason she’s still standing right now is because she’s the killer and has been binge drinking blood. That means the chick was absolutely WIRED!” Rudy’s eyebrows furrowed as he went deep in thought, “Wait…how did I know that?”

“Good grief,” Dustin griped.

“You were a monster hunter before,” I told him.

Rudy paused, mulling that information over. “My mind doesn’t remember but it seems my body sure does. I can’t believe I fought like that. I- I don’t know how to describe it exactly, but it’s like this *rush* came over me. I felt so *strong* and so *powerful,* like I could do *anything…*”

My pulse started racing and my palms got sweaty as I remembered the last thing Rudy had been doing before we left and he broke out. He’d been drinking blood. My blood.

“That’s nice. Now, get moving!” Dustin grumbled, kicking the back of Rudy’s feet to get him walking. As they continued to make their way out into the parking lot, my partner turned his neck and shot me one of his infamous glares. I guess Dustin still wanted to have that talk later.

Detective Davidson dug a pair of car keys out from his pocket as we approached his liftback. The car chirped as he pressed the unlock button. I popped and held the back door open while Dustin shoved the escapee down in the backseat.

After Rudy was tightly secured and situated, I sat down in my usual seat with the door open while Dustin walked around to the Driver’s side. He didn’t get in though. He stood with his hands on his hips, staring up at the moon. It was full and glowing brightly, basking him in a thick layer of moonlight. According to the news it was a super moon that night. A beaver moon.

A bitter breeze brought some fresh air into the vehicle. The still silence that followed allowed me to finally process the events of the last five minutes.

“Fuck!”I shouted, angrily slamming my fist on the dashboard with all my might. The car shook due to my outburst, the glove compartment popping open. “I can’t believe she got away,” I leaned back in my chair and sighed.

Rudy looked at me through the rearview mirror judgmentally before muttering into his shoulder, “You heard her back there. She’ll be back.”

Dustin then tapped his finger on the driver’s side glass window twice to get my attention. After receiving it, he motioned for me to roll down the window. Stretching across my seat, I did as instructed, turning the little handle all the way until there was no window left to roll down.

“Go easy on ol’ Mabel, eh?” he said patting the top of his car gently, pointing to the open glove box. “She’s not getting any younger.”

“You named your car, Mabel?” Rudy antagonized from the back seat. That earned him a hearty stare from Dustin. Rudy shifted uncomfortably in his seat, turning his head to look out the window.

“Pass me my lighter and smokes?” Dustin asked, once again pointing at the glove compartment.

“Really?” I asked, rifling through the junk filling up the small space. I found an almost empty box of Marlboro lights and tossed it. He told me he was giving up smoking a month ago. And, for the most part, he’d been keeping good on his word. I didn’t even know he still had a pack left. “You’re going to smoke *now?*”

Dustin shook the box and tapped it on the palm of his hand a couple times before sliding out a cigarette and sticking it between his lips. “What?! I’m stressed.”

Now it was my turn to give him a look. He just stared at me expectantly.

“Didn’t find a lighter.”

Dustin took the cigarette out of his mouth and held it between his middle and pointer finger, placing a hand on his hip as he stared at me impatiently. “Check my jacket pocket then.”

With a groan, I reaching behind the driver’s seat, my hand blindly searching for the garment that had been tossed back there earlier. An “aha,” slipped out of my mouth as my fingers brushed against the fabric. I pulled it out and set it on my lap as I dug through the pockets. Finding a blue lighter, I snagged it.

The hunger that shone in Rudy’s eyes didn’t escape me as he watched me toss the bloodied police jacket back onto the seat. In all honesty, I forgot he had been back there for a second. He was sulking rather quietly. Rudy got a testing glance from me, telling him he was toast if he tried anything. I was about to grab the jacket back when Dustin cleared his throat restlessly. Making a mental note, I turned and threw the lighter out the window.

Davidson caught it and I continued to stare at him. He scoffed, lighting the cigarette in his mouth and taking a long drag. “You don’t get to judge me, missy. Not after the shit you put me through today.”

I rolled my eyes, mimicking, “you don’t get to judge me, missy,” like a toddler. Dustin blew me off and continued to happily destroy his lungs with carcinogen. I turned forward and crossed my arms into my chest, a box of lucky strike matches in the glove compartment catching my eye.

Without hesitation, I swiped the namesake and stuffed into my pocket. *Hope you miss these, sucker!* I thought, turning my neck to look out at the moon.

Claire de lune started playing again, causing the three of us to jump. “Shit, should probably answer that,” Dustin then threw his cig on the ground and stomped it out before getting into the liftback. He rolled up his window before digging his phone out of the center console. The soothing classical music abruptly stopped as he answered the phone.

“Jesus Christ, finally!” Jane loudly yelled through the phone. Dustin winced and pulled the phone away from his ear as he clicked the speakerphone button. “I was just about to send a unit out there to check on the two of you. Rudy escaped!

“Yeah, we know,” I said.

“You *know?!* what do you mean you know? I’ve been calling you nonstop for the past thirty minutes!”

“Relax, Jane, we got him. He’s sitting in my back seat right now.”

“Hi,” Rudy called out meekly.

“H-hi?” Jane responded. I could just visualize the confused look on her face.

“Sage is the one that got away,” I added bitterly.

Jane gasped. “What the hell happened out there?”

“A fight happened,” Davidson answered, “her and the revenant got into it. He almost killed her, but Hale talked him out of it. Then she got the upper hand while he was distracted and got away fast.”

“T-that’s okay,”she blurted out, “the vampire confessed. We have direct evidence! We’ll put out a statewide bulletin  and she’ll be in Winchester PD’s custody in no time. She’ll face The Court and the trial will be swift with what we got on her. A happy ending for everyone- well, except her.”

Dustin shot down Jane’s optimism. “We didn’t record it. There’s no proof.”

“Sage is gone and we have nothing on her to get her back,” I said solemnly, picking at the skin around my thumbnail. “Hell we don’t even know her real name!”

A tense moment of silence passed as Dustin and I stewed in our failure. A glance at the rearview mirror revealed even Rudy looked disappointed with himself.

“Then, there’s nothing else we can do about it tonight,” Jane said softly. “Let’s all just go home and recuperate. We’ll regroup tomorrow and figure out what to do from there.”

“Yeah, okay,” Dustin sighed, leaning back in his seat, “it has been a long day. I’m beat.”

A yawn escaped me. “Same. I’m ready to go home.”

A soft snore came from Rudy’s mouth, the excitement of the day finally catching up with him.

Dustin let out a breath as he leaned forward and turned his key in the ignition. He put his hands on the steering wheel before looking back at Rudy, “All right revenant, let’s get you back to where you belong.”

Dustin was about to hang up the phone on Jane when suddenly, my phone started vibrating. “Hold on, I’m getting a call,” I said aloud, perplexed. Who could be calling at this time of night?

I looked at the caller ID. It wasn’t any number I recognized, but it had a local area code. Something in my gut told me to answer it, so I did.

Before I could even get in a hello, an agonized scream erupted in my ear. I jolted up right in my seat, the fear in the person’s voice causing my adrenal glands to kick into overdrive. Whoever was calling me sounded familiar.

“W-what’s going on?” Jane asked, Dustin’s phone having picked up the scream.

Dustin and Rudy- now awake again- looked at me for answers as well.

“I- I dunno!” I said, straining my ear trying to decipher whose voice was on the other line. There had been a tense moment after the scream, filled with heavy breathing. It was labored. Like the very action of breathing was painful.

Suddenly, a ghastly moan echoed through my phone. “O-officer… please. Please, help me!”

My eyes went wide as the face and name belonging to the voice clicked in my mind.“N-Noah?!?”

“Who the hell is Noah?” Dustin questioned, a hint of jealousy in his tone.

“My barista!” I answered in a tizzy. How had he gotten a hold of my personal cell number?

Dustin stared at me like the confused Nick Young meme. “Y-you’re *what?*”

“Never mind that, now,” I said brushing him off. “Jane, can you get a location from this phone number and fast?”

A moment of silence passed as I awaited for the witch’s answer, the tension in the cabin rose as more heavy breathing sounded from my call. “Give it to me. I can get it to you instantly.”

I rattled out the phone number in a panicked breath. At the same time, a soft incantation came from the other side of Dustin’s phone. We had a location in seconds.

“The call is coming from Whispering Pines Highway just past the thirteenth mile marker,” Jane quickly relayed. That wasn’t too far from the warehouse.

Dustin nodded his head, knowing where to go. He threw the liftback in reverse, kicking up a cloud of dirt.

“We’re on our way,” Dustin said into his phone before ending his call with Jane.

“Do you hear me, Noah? We’re coming for you!” I yelled into the phone right before the call got disconnected. “We’re coming for you…” I said again in a whisper as Dustin sped off, turning on his red and blue lights.

We rolled up on an abandoned Jeep Wrangler. It was grey in color and pulled over to the side, engine still running. The lights and radio in the cabin were on but no driver was in sight. The passenger side door was wide open.

Dustin pulled in behind the Jeep. We noticed in the tree line a path of broken foliage. I haphazardly unbuckled my seatbelt and opened my door. Dustin followed.

Rudy looked at us disbelievingly, “You’re really just going to leave me in here?”

Dustin and I looked at each other before looking over at Rudy. “Yes,” we answered in unison before slamming our doors on him. He scowled at us through the window as we walked further into the woods to investigate.

I led the way, following the direction the tips of broken tree limbs pointed in as a guide.

“Maybe we should turn back,” Dustin grumbled after a stray branch whacked him on the nose, “we can gather a search party and come back better prepared. It’s a full moon and I don’t know if you noticed, but we don’t really have anything to protect ourselves with. There could be werewolves out here!”

“Calm down, Dustin,” I said behind me, braving further into the thick brush. “We’re not turning back.”

“Lucky, please,” he pleaded.

“No!” I snapped, stopping for a brief moment. Then I started walking again. The sound of our footsteps crunching on dead leaves filled the silence between us.

I was the one who broke it. “You heard how distressed he was. We don’t have time to gather a search party.”

“Be honest with me,”Davidson sighed, “why are you really determined to find this guy?”

“I- I know him, Dustin,”I started to explain, “He’s a good kid.”

He burned two holes in the back of my head with his disbelieving stare. I guess being partners for nearly a year meant we knew each other better than that. Detective Davidson had caught on that I wasn’t telling the full truth.

“And after tonight, I *need* to save him. *Save someone.* Who knows how many more people are in danger now because of me. Because of that psycho out on the loose.”

“Lucy,” Dustin said softly.

I wiped a tear from my waterline, trying to stuff that guilty feeling down into a box that would never see the light of day again. With a sniffle, I let out a small, pathetic, giggle. “You know, he asked me out on a date, but I shot him down. This is the least-“

A firm hand gripped my shoulder. At first I thought it was to comfort and reassure me, but then Dustin pointed at something in the distance and shushed me. Cautiously, we approached it.

At the mouth of a small clearing, the two of us discovered a trail of discarded clothes. It led deeper into the glade. At the end of the trail lied the shivering body of a naked man. He was on the floor, back turned to us, in the fetal position. What sounded like slight, heavy sobs filled the air.

I’d recognize that curly brown mop anywhere. “Noah, thank god we found you!” I exclaimed, running up to check on him.

As I approached, something in the air started to feel weird. Perhaps it was the fact that Noah’s sobs didn’t sound so much like that anymore. Instead, it seemed the boy had been suffering from a fit of laughter. “You stupid bitch!” He roared out with a cackle, continuing to clutch his sides as he laughed even harder.

“Never mind I take back what I said about him being a good kid,” I whispered, slowly retracting the hand I had outstretched, warily backing away. This wasn’t right…

Suddenly the laughs stopped. Noah picked himself up off the ground and turned. The light of the moon seemed to make his eyes glow ethereally. No, it wasn’t the moon. His brown eyes were literally glowing. They burned so bright they looked almost yellow. Instead of the usual innocence l saw in them, those eyes were dark, conniving, and evil. Noah flashed a smile, revealing two rows of sharpened teeth. “I knew you’d come.”

“See?!? *Werewolf!*” Dustin triumphantly motioned with his hands from me to Noah. Of course he’d been right. He always was.

As if on cue, Noah’s body started to wriggle and writhe as his skeleton began to rearrange itself. Those same pained groans I heard from the phone earlier came from his mouth as patches of fur began appearing all over his body. Noah’s hands morphed into paws as his jaw snapped and elongated into a sickening snout. The flesh of his lower back split open, making room for the section of spine that was pushing itself out, forming a rudimentary tail. In just under a minute, Noah had become a wolf. Not just any wolf, though. *The White Wolf.*

This whole thing had been a trap, and I’d fallen right into it.

“T-that’s him! My stalker!” I cried, biting my knuckles.

“What?!” Dustin asked, turning to look at me, then to the werewolf.

The White Wolf licked his lips hungrily as it stared at me. With a snarl, Noah turned to face the bigger of the two of us. Dustin.

I’d seen in his eyes how he calculated who the bigger threat was, and I didn’t like where this was heading.

The wolf dug his paws in the dirt like a horse and tensed his haunches. With a tremendous amount of power and elegance, he pounced, soaring through the air.

Realizing he didn’t have enough time, Dustin braced himself, putting his arms up defensively. I tried to jump and push him out of the way, but I was too late.

A howl of pain erupted out of Dustin’s throat as Noah’s claws sliced into his forearm, the momentum of the wolf’s tackle knocking them both to the ground.

Dustin yelped as he fruitlessly punched and kicked at The White Wolf as he continued to maul him. Who was quite literally tearing him to shreds.

I yelled at Noah to get off of my partner, but he just turned and growled at me. “Wait your turn,” the look he gave seemed to say.

My hands flew to my tool belt in an effort to find anything that could dispel the werewolf. My finger grazed my gun holster.

I could’ve emptied a clip into the wolf, but in my state there was a good probability Dustin would get caught in the crossfire. Not to mention the fact regular bullets were useless on werewolves- and my spare ammunition was in the trunk of the liftback. I doubted throwing silver handcuffs at the animal would do much other than piss him off even more.

What else did I have on me that could harm a werewolf? My wallet: definitely not. There was nothing in it. Taser: maybe, but I’d have to get close and run the risk of hurting Dustin even more.

Hope to save my partner was quickly fleeting as I patted my pants down for something, *anything.* That’s when the palm of my hand felt a small rectangular object. The Lucky Strike matchbook in my pocket.

Fire: yes.

I fumbled to get the matches out of the pocket. My hands were shaking and trembling so bad, the matchbook almost slipped out of my hands. Steeling myself, I carefully grabbed a match and stuck it on the package.

Didn’t light.

I tried it again, altering the amount of pressure on the match head this time. Still didn’t light.

Dustin, fighting for his life, looked over at me struggling. “Arghhh!” He screamed after his face had been scratched. “Get! Him! Off!”

“I! Am! Trying!” I shouted back, frustrated, still striking the match on the box. I felt a small tug in my gut. It was small enough to barely even notice it was there. Then a hot flash spread throughout my body. The sizzling sound of the match head burning was like music to my ears. With all my might, I tossed the lit match, watching as it rotated towards its target.

As soon as the fire made contact, the wolf’s pelt was engulfed in flames in an instant. Noah let out a pained whine as he jumped off of Dustin, rolling around in the dirt trying to put out the fire. No matter what he did that fire still burned. Like it was somehow enchanted.

The wolf cried out in a panic as it erratically jumped around trying to put itself out. Eventually the flames burned all the fur off and his joints were too damaged to move. With a heavy thud, Noah slumped over on the ground. After one last howl, The White Wolf’s charred remains stopped moving. It seemed the fire only went out after Noah had burned to a crisp. Wisps of smoke wafted off the corpse, the smell of burnt meat and hair filled the air.

“God damn,” Rudy said in amazement from behind me.

I jumped, turning around and throwing a defensive punch. Using his supernatural agility, Rudy narrowly dodged my surprise attack.

“How did you escape?” I questioned. It was then that I noticed he had something hanging from his mouth. It was Dustin’s bloodied police jacket.

“Wif dis,” Rudy said with a smile, pointing at the jacket. With a small slurp, he pulled it out of his mouth and folded it over his arm. “I heard a scream and came to help, but it looks like you had it covered.”

I was about to say something when Dustin let out a weak groan. I ran over to him. Rudy tried to follow but then he saw all the blood. He hesitated before walking back into the tree line. “I’ll just stay over here.”

“Dustin? Dustin are you alright?!” I asked, taking him in. His clothes were reduced to threads and he was covered in cuts and blood. His left eye was swollen shut and turning blue.

“I think-“ he coughed up a little bit of blood. Tears started to sting my eyes. “I think I prefer getting beat up by the mermaid.”

I stifled a laugh then a cry. “One, it was a siren. And two, you should see the other guy,” I pointed over to the singed lump a few yards away.

Dustin groaned as he slowly sat up and looked. “Phew,” he said looking back at me. His hand slipped on the slick grass, but I caught him this time.

“Are you going to be alright?”

“I’ll be fine. Nothing a good rest and glass of whiskey can’t fix.”

“Yeah, no, let’s get you to a hospital,” I said, carefully lifting him up.

“That’s probably a good idea,” he groaned, leaning on me for support. Slowly, the two of us started making our way back out to the road. “Is that Rudy?” He asked, watching the revenant walk on ahead of us.

“Yup,” I answered.

Dustin grabbed a hold of his side, wincing as we walked. “Do I even want to know?”

I pressed my lips into a thin line, imagining just the kind of damage Rudy had done to the liftback in his escape. “Probably not.”

Dustin then started to lightly chuckle, at one point going into a small coughing fit before taking a deep breath, the cold air cooling his burning lungs. “Welp, one thing is for sure.”

“Yeah, what’s that?” I asked with a breathy laugh, patting his shoulder.

“You’re definitely not a damn rookie anymore. You saved my life.”

A twang of guilt stung my stomach and I lost my balance for a second. “It’s my fault I had to save it in the first place.”

“Doesn’t matter,” he shrugged.

As we continued to walk all I could think about was my old partner. The one I had back in Chicago before joining the division.

The one I *couldn’t* save.

I really liked the *Humblewood* setting, so I’ve decided to use it as a starting point. However, there’s a small issue: the people I’ll be playing with probably won’t be available all the time. Because of this, I thought about structuring the campaign as a series of one-shots with a common end goal. I also want to keep the theme more relaxed.

With that in mind, I’m considering setting the campaign around a coffee or specialty shop (one that sells random artifacts and quirky, useless objects) that the players are responsible for running. Recently, a rival shop has opened in the city, and the players need to stop relying on their current supplier. This forces them to become adventurers, traveling to find new supplies.

Each adventure would play out like a one-shot: the players would retrieve the item of the session and bring it back to the shop safely. They would also need to interact with the townsfolk to advertise their new finds. They could even decide to go on small heists at the rival shop to investigate their supply chain, and so on.

My question is: do you think this is a fun idea? I want to create a campaign that I can run regularly and that allows players to drop in and out as they wish.

So, I (34F) have a preteen daughter (11F) who is a trans girl. She hasn’t started puberty blockers yet, but she’s already made a lot of changes—wearing dresses, growing out her hair, and speaking in a more feminine voice. She’s thriving, and I’m so proud of her for being herself. However, things have gotten pretty complicated with my sister, Sarah’s, family, and I’m wondering if I’m in the wrong for how I’ve been handling things.

Sarah has always been more than just a sister to me. Growing up, we didn’t have a dad, and our mom struggled with addiction. Sarah basically raised me, and when I had my daughter, she was always there for us. After our mom got sober (she’s been clean for 10 years now), she rejoined the family, but Sarah’s been like a second mom to me and my daughter. That’s why this situation is so hard for me, and I really don’t want to cause any rifts.

Sarah’s husband, Tim, is very conservative, and while I’ve never heard him directly say anything hateful about my daughter or trans people, I overheard him once, thinking I was in another room, saying that trans people “don’t exist” and that my daughter should dress like a boy until she’s 18. That moment really stuck with me, but I didn’t confront him about it because I was so shocked.

A while back, my daughter and I went to a family dinner at Sarah’s. Everything was fine until my nephew (Sarah’s son, 12) said something that really hurt my daughter. He told her she wasn’t a girl and that she had male genitalia because “God gave it to her.” This was devastating for my daughter, and we had to leave early because she was crying. I didn’t want to make a scene, but I could tell my daughter was crushed.

The next day, I met with Sarah for coffee and told her what happened. She was incredibly apologetic and promised that it would never happen again. She assured me that Tim didn’t share those views, and that she was unaware he was transphobic until my daughter’s transition started. I appreciated her trying to be supportive, but when we went back for the next family dinner, things took a turn.

During dinner, we all held hands to pray, and when it came time for my daughter to join in, my nephew refused to hold her hand. He called her a “gross tranny.” I didn’t hear this directly, but my daughter came to me afterward, upset and crying. My nephew seemed confused and didn’t say anything when I asked him about it, but I trust my daughter. She’s not the type to lie about something like that—she just wants to be accepted.

Sarah claims my nephew didn’t say anything, but I’m not sure what to think. I know she doesn’t share Tim’s views, but at the same time, I can’t ignore the possibility that Tim’s influence is seeping into the kids, even if it’s not being said outright.

Since then, I’ve been avoiding family gatherings because I just don’t feel it’s a safe environment for my daughter. I don’t want her to go through more hurtful moments like this. I don’t want to cause a rift with Sarah—she’s been such a huge part of my life and my daughter’s life, and the thought of breaking up our family over this is devastating. But at the same time, I have to protect my daughter and make sure she feels accepted and loved.

So, AITA for not spending time with Sarah’s family? I feel like I’m doing what’s best for my daughter, but I don’t want to damage the relationship with my sister either.",1,1733075679.0,ComfortLevelPod,3,1.0,False

In my area, there is a large population of senior citizens.

One of my favorite clients is a dude named Rob, retired, and another senior citizen on a fixed income, but also loaded from stocks and other stuff like that.

He has two cats: one is named Simon and the other is a diabetic cat named Schuster. When I come over to sit for the cats, he always leaves me a tip in cash in addition to tipping at the end of the booking through the Rover app.

And I always joke with him, ""Hey, Rob! Thanks as always, but you already left me a tip!""

And he'll always joke back that it must be ""old people problems"" (i.e., he's joking he is a typical old person with memory problems).

I have another sit that I just started today. Back in September (the last sit I had before today's), I had replied that I'm just as happy with a Wawa coffee that's about $1 (part joke, but I'm also serious that I would be happy with just some cheap coffee).

1h48ydr,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating_advice/comments/1h48ydr/she_was_showing_signs_of_interest_but_now_i_think/,"She was showing signs of interest, but now I think she’s ghosting me ","So I (32M) matched with this woman (29F) on hinge last week. We hit it off quick, have lots of mutual interests and a shared sense of humor. The conversations escalated to her saying how she wants to take *me* out to coffee, she switched over to sending me voice notes and eventually we exchanged numbers. She told me how much she liked my voice and how my style was cute, how sweet I am, etc. 

Since we have a mutual interest of the outdoors, a couple days ago I suggested we do a fun outdoorsy date and she agreed. The plan was for today, which isn’t happening at this point. Yesterday was my birthday and she sent me a really nice message saying something along the lines of “happy birthday you sweet handsome man xx!” And then told me she had a long outdoors trip planned for the day and she’d text me in the evening. I thanked her and told her to have a great day. My plan was to confirm our plans later that night when she texted me, but she never did. So I texted her instead after my birthday festivities asking if she was still up for our date tomorrow but no worries if she was tired from her trip. It was late so she didn’t respond, and at this point I think she’s probably ghosting me or at the very least showing signs of it 

It’s a shame since she showed a lot of interest and initiative, and I made sure to reciprocate that energy. It’s still possible that her trip yesterday went longer than she expected and maybe she didn’t have the energy to text, but I still feel like she should have at least texted she we had a date planned. To be fair the last time we talked about the date was a couple days ago, but I usually don’t forget about a planned date after a couple of days, especially if I’m interested. This seems to be a recurring theme in dating for me these days - the woman will show clear signs of interest and then ghost. 

I’m wondering if I should be doing anything differently? This isn’t my first rodeo and I’m already prepared to move on, but it’s admittedly frustrating since I’m seeing this flakey/ghosty behavior so often from grown adults 

Edit: it’s also crazy to me how she sent me such a sweet birthday text only to never text me or respond afterwards  ",1,1733075509.0,dating_advice,6,1.0,False

I was getting on the tram in Amsterdam with one of those reusable hard plastic coffee cups with a lid—totally sealed, and EMPTY.

I told her it was empty, but nope, apparently just having the container is against the rules. She actually said, “Throw it away or take the next tram.”

Now, it’s the best part, I asked her where I was supposed to throw it because there wasn’t a trash can in sight. She said: “Throw it on the ground at the tram stop.”

At that point, I was ready to just give up, but this random girl at the stop came up and offered to hold onto my cup and throw it away for me. I handed it to her, got on the tram, and just sat there stewing over how unnecessarily stupid the whole situation was.

All you have to do is follow the guide.Can be turned on/off because it will be irritating if it will always save you on things like a woman accidentally spilling coffee on you(who knows, she couldve been your love story😅).

I treasure my friends dearly and don't want to  hurt them both. Pwede pa hingi advice on what to do kasi parang palala ng palala as the day goes by eh. 

Context: 2 months ago, may friend ako nanghingi favor na maging ""bf"" daw ako since madami raw nag aask out sa kanya na mga barumbado which she doesn't like para lang daw they'll leave her alone till the end of semester since mimigrate na siya sa US, which I agreed, wala naman harm and just for funsies lang naman. We don't do the deed or love chat whatsoever like pag sa campus lang act lang. Her best friend is the only person on campus that knows we're not a real thing . 

Now, a week ago I decided to tell my best friend in the other school about this and was pretty stoked at first sinasabihan pa ako na ""may trial na sa pagiging boyfriend"" kaya goods then later nagmessage siya sa akin na sinabi niya sa HS Crush ko na may Girlfriend na ako. A day has passed, my HS Crush messaged me casual nangangamusta lang which is like okay definitely nothing weird, just her casually messaging me after malaman na may gf ako. So then we chatted, days passed by she asked me to stop by the coffee shop near her and agreed to meet her there kasi syempre casual catching up lang yun, ang akala ko. Then she cried in the middle of our conversation asked her what it's about and she keeps muttering ""napakatanga ko"" sinabi ko pa biro ""dahil ba sa gf ko"" sabi nya ""oo, ilan beses mo akong inask out wala akong sagot sayo palagi silence, ni reject man lang hindi ko masabi sayo dahil gusto kita pero hindi lang talaga ako handa."" may mga iba pa siyang sinabi then she left, nagreregret lang ako since di ko man lang nasabi na acting bf lang naman ako para sa kaibigan ko that we still have chance dahil in disbelief talaga ako sa mga sinabi niya. 

Balik sa campus during training ka sparring ko ung best friend niya sinabi sakin na di ko daw ba napapansin na parang lumalagkit daw tingin sakin ng kaibigan namin sagot ko parang di naman then later pagtapos class namin hinatid ko sa dorm the usual routine then kissed me on my lips then said ""see you monday"" like what the actual fk??? Wala naman nakatingin sa amin to act that way and she never ever did that at most akbay lang hindi nga hug eh. 

So ngayon conflicted ako what to do. I treasure my friends dearly and don't want to  hurt them both. Pwede pa hingi advice on what to do kasi parang palala ng palala as the day goes by eh.

###New Crimes
---

**Franklin Rock High School, Suicide Slum**

*Months Ago*

---

José Delgado walked into his fifth-grade classroom and cleared his throat loudly, getting the students' attention. A few were still talking amongst themselves.

“Attention,” José ordered, which did the trick. “You know the drill,” he continued. “Alvarez?” he asked, getting a “here” response.

“Baxter?” José asked next, but the room was quiet, except for some whispers and shuffling through backpacks.

“Here, Mr. Delgado,” he finally got.

“Donner?”

…

“Donner?”

“I think he’s out sick,” another child interjected.

“Okay,” said José, making a note on the sheet. I’ll check with the office. “Johnson?” he asked next.

“Johnson?” he repeated.

“I haven’t seen her today,” someone said.

“Yeah,” another added. “We were supposed to meet by my locker.”

“Hmm,” said José, adding another note.

A knock at the door captured everyone’s attention. It was the principal, Mrs. Delany. José waved her inside.

She entered slowly with a somber look and whispered something into José’s ear. The teacher’s face dropped.

“I have some bad news about Lateesha Johnson,” Mrs. Delany explained. “There was a shooting near her apartment complex this morning.

Some gasps filled the room as all eyes were focused on what she was saying.

“Luckily, Superman arrived and got her to the hospital,” she continued. “And they’re doing everything they can to make her better.”

“We’ll take some time to talk,” said José. “It can be difficult to process news like this.”

“Thank you, Mr. Delgado,” said Mrs. Delany. “And, if anyone needs to talk more, my door is always open, too.”

The principal exited the classroom, and José looked at the empty seat where Lateesha usually sat. He tightened his fists. It was a miracle that Lateesha had gotten help, but it sounded like she’d need another miracle. He would pray for her, but he couldn’t think of all the others who were affected by violence in the city and the world daily.

Several years ago, after his field trip to Saint Florian’s Cathedral was in the crossfire of an altercation with the Cyborg Superman ([*Batman #30*](https://www.reddit.com/r/DCFU/comments/9t9rz4/batman_30_the_battle_of_metropolis/)), José made a promise to himself that he’d always keep his students safe. He had gotten into boxing and martial arts, readying for the day he’d have to step up and protect them again.

But now he realized that was a preventative measure. Maybe he needed to be more proactive to help make the city safer for his students and everyone else who lived there.

---

**LexCorp Tower**

*Now*

---

Lois and Clark stood behind the police tape around the LexCorp entrance where a break-in had just occurred. Cameras flashed, and the crowd of reporters hyped up as Lena stepped out the doors.

A cacophony of questions greeted her.

“Who broke in?”

“What was stolen?”

“Does the robbery have anything to do with your father?”

Lena’s security guards motioned for them to quiet down. She gathered by a clump of microphones outstretched over the police barricade.

“We don’t know much,” Lena explained. “But the perpetrators were wearing logos associated with the Savior following, which was believed to have been shut down recently.”

The Savior was a cult leader and serial killer who believed Superman never came back to life after Doomsday. But he was taken down, and his organization dismantled, or so they thought. There were apparently still members out there, but how did LexCorp fit into their operation?

“They used highly advanced weaponry,” Lena continued. “The police are unclear how they acquired such technology, though.”

“What did they want?” Lois asked.

“They appeared to be after information,” Lena replied. “Some old archives were breached. We’re still investigating what they accessed, but preliminary indications are this wasn’t an attempt to access personal or financial information about our customers or employees. It appears to be some form of corporate espionage after proprietary knowledge.”

Clark shared a quizzical look with Lois. Something didn’t add up.

“That’s all for now,” Lena said next. I’ll schedule a formal press conference once we have more information. Thank you.”

“There’s a service entrance around the corner the police are using,” Clark told Lois softly. “I could sneak us through there without anyone seeing.”

“Clark Joseph Kent,” said Lois with a playful melody in her tone. “After eight years of working together, am I finally rubbing off on you?”

“You’re acting like this is the first time I’ve snuck into this building,” said Clark. ([*Batman #11*](https://www.reddit.com/r/DCFU/comments/62sqfh/batman_11_seeking_answers_justice_league_iii/))

 “And you’re acting like that wasn’t Bruce’s idea,” Lois replied, taking her husband’s hand.

---

**Inside LexCorp**

*Moment Later*

---

A police officer stood guard by the entrance to the archive room as Clark and Lois stood around the corner.

Lois bit her bottom lip as she considered their next move.

“Give me your glasses,” she said a moment later while tying her hair into a ponytail.

“My glasses?” Clark repeated, wondering where she was going with it.

Lois stepped over to her husband, reaching up to his face while stretching her toes. “A little help?” she asked.

Clark exhaled slowly and took off his glasses, handing them to Lois, who put them on herself.

“Stay here,” she ordered, stepping into view of the officer.

“This area’s a crime scene,” the officer told her. “It will be off-limits until we’re done here.”

“The commissioner is upstairs,” Lois said. “He wants everyone to check in with him before we wrap things up.""

The officer stepped closer. “Henderson is here?” he asked.

“Yeah,” Lois confirmed. “Better not keep him waiting.”

The officer squinted his eyes, reaching for his shoulder-mounted microphone, and tapped the button. “Status check,” he said, but nothing happened. “*Hmm*,” he said, inspecting the device. “I guess we’re done here.”

The officer walked away, and Clark joined Lois by the door to the archive room.

“That was lucky,” she said.

Clark let his eyes turn red for a moment. “Luck had nothing to do with it,” he said.

“Wow, Smallville,” said Lois, handing the glasses back. “Damaging police equipment? That was a bold move.”

“I couldn’t let you get caught,” said Clark, putting back on his glasses. But then he took them back off.

“What happened?” asked Lois.

“Another robbery,” said Clark. “S.T.A.R. Labs is being hit.”

“Go,” said Lois. “I’ll finish up here and find my way out.”

Clark nodded and disappeared, and Lois stepped inside the room. She found an open terminal with chairs and random equipment scattered around it. Safe bet it was where the intruders accessed the systems.

Lois pulled out her phone from her purse and triple-tapped a point on the back twice. A small device popped out of the side of the phone, which she pulled out, revealing a silver USB input on its end.

“Thank you, Chloe,” she whispered as she inserted the device into the terminal.

Several windows popped up on the screen and disappeared just as quickly. A progress bar appeared labeled “Download in Progress.”

The elevator door opened nearby, and the police officer who had left had previously stepped out, along with a few other officers with their firearms drawn.  They entered the archives room to find it empty. But the screen said, “Download Complete.”

###New Information

---

**Suicide Slum**

*Earlier*

---

José Delgado sat in his decade-old Toyota Camry, watching the apartment building across the street. A large duffel bag was on the passenger seat. It had taken months, but he found out who was involved in the shooting that got one of his students shot in the crossfire.

Thankfully, Lateesha fully recovered, but that wasn’t the point. She was one of the lucky ones. Not everyone was that lucky in Suicide Slum.

José had all the names but didn’t have enough evidence to bring to the police. That was the problem with most gang crimes. They had reputations– people from the neighborhood *knew* what they’d done– but nobody would ever step forward as witnesses. Putting the heat on themselves or their families was too risky.

The man who had taken the shot was named John Hatoswki, but he went by “Hatz.” He was always wearing a baseball hat. Some in his circle even joked he wore one to bed. José wasn’t laughing, though.

A van pulled up, blocking José’s view of the doorway. He stepped out of his car and nonchalantly walked across the street, covertly taking peeks when he could.

The front door to the apartment building swung open, and there he was. Hatz stepped outside with a grin that made José’s blood boil. The man didn’t deserve to be happy.

The van opened its side door, and José saw several people wearing recognizable blue robes with the Superman symbol.

No way.

Hatz could *not* be a member of a movement that worshiped Superman.

One of the members in the van handed a robe to Hatz, who grabbed it as he stepped inside.

José went back to his car and waited for the van to leave. He kept his distance but followed along.

---

**S.T.A.R. Labs**

*Soon*

The van had driven to Midtown until it stopped across the street from S.T.A.R. Labs.

José parked a few spaces down and kept an eye on them.

He had a weird feeling. What would Superman worshippers be doing there? They were more known for harassing people in Centennial Park, trying to get them to join their misguided religion.

The robed members exited the van but were now wearing blue masks. One of the masks protruded back as if he were wearing a baseball cap underneath.

José shook his head and then watched as each of the members reached back inside the van and pulled away with weapons.

That confirmed it. They were definitely up to no good.

José pulled out his phone and dialed 911.

“911, what’s your emergency?” a voice answered.

“Masked men with guns are headed toward S.T.A.R. Labs,” José stated before hanging up.

It’d take time for them to get there. But luckily, he was already there.

José opened his duffel bag and pulled out some garments. Minutes later, he stepped out of his car in brown and yellow armor with a helmet and visor. He wore a silver chain on the front of his waist with two sticks flopping to the side. A fist covered by a prohibition circle was affixed to his chest.

It had taken too long to change. The crew was already across the street and inside the facility.

José ran across, jumping over the hood of a car that almost ran into him. He rushed inside to find the security guards had been taken out, but several of the robed perpetrators were still in the lobby.

None of them had a hat under their mask.

“Who are you supposed to be?” one asked when they saw his costume.

“I’m Gangbuster,” José stated. “Whatever you’re doing here, it’s over.”

“We’re not a gang,” the Superman worshiper said, stepping close with a gun aimed his way.

José grabbed the gun and punched the man in the head with his other gloved hand. He took several shots at the others, making them duck for cover. He leaped toward them, throwing kicks and punches until they were all knocked out.

“Drop the gun,” a voice called from the doorway.

José turned around slowly to find Superman there. He let the weapon fall to the ground. “It’s okay,” he said. “I’m here to help.”

Clark took a closer look. “You must be Gangbuster,” he said. “I’ve heard of you.”

He scanned deeper inside the building. “If you’ll excuse me,” he added before disappearing from the lobby.

Police sirens could be heard approaching. José figured he wasn’t needed anymore. But he would stay close. He wanted to see them take Hatz into custody.

“Abadabba daba,” said Lara as Chloe listened intently. “Badadda gabba,” she continued.

“You don’t say,” Chloe responded.

“Bab*ba*da!” Lara declared, really stressing the point.

“Babbada,” Jon repeated with a giggle. “She’s so funny.”

“Maybe she’ll be a comedian when she grows up,” said Lois.

“Maybe!” Jon replied.

A laptop on the coffee table beeped, and Chloe reached over.

“Anything?” asked Lois.

“This data is encrypted so well,” Chloe explained. “But we’ve already been in LexCorp’s systems. There shouldn’t be anything new in their archives we haven’t seen.”

“Unless it’s been archived since,” Lois corrected. “But knowing what they were after would answer a lot of questions.”

“That’s why I’m focusing on decrypting the logging markers,” Chloe explained. “It *should* tell us what was accessed recently. And the burglars would be the last ones to do that.”

The laptop beeped again.

“Beep!” Jon repeated.

Chloe smiled. “Got something,” she said.

Lois pulled herself closer.

Chloe exhaled sharply. “False alarm,” she said. “Only a few nonsequential words have been decrypted so far. The rest are taking more time.”

Lois scanned the words on the screen, broken up by numerous random-looking characters. Two stood out the most: “North” and “Dean.”

“Dean,” Lois said aloud. “Where have I heard that name before?”

Chloe took a moment. “Could the next word after ‘north’ be ‘pole’?” she asked.

Lois’ eyes popped wide open. “That’s it,” she said. “Dean was one of Lex’s covert agents who led a team to infiltrate Superman’s Fortress of Solitude. Could the Savior cult be after information about The Fortress itself?”

“We better call Clark,” said Chloe.

###New Mysteries

**Near S.T.A.R. Labs**

---

Clark left S.T.A.R. Labs and took to the skies as his phone rang. He tapped a button on his belt to answer.

“Clark,” said Lois on the other end. “The Saviors appear to be after info on the Fortress,” she explained.

“The Fortress?” Clark repeated back in disbelief.

“Weird, right?” said Lois.

Clark spotted Gangbuster on a rooftop nearby.

“Just as weird as Superman worshipers breaking into S.T.A.R. Labs today,” Clark said.

“My guess is there are snakes involved,” said Lois. “When there’s weirdness going on lately, they seem to be around in some capacity.”

“I’ll be home soon,” said Clark. “I have to make a stop.”

Clark hung up and landed on the rooftop.

“Did they arrest everyone?” asked Gangbuster.

“At least one got away,” Clark explained. “They stole blue kryptonite that had been used to subdue General Zod when he was in their custody.”

“Why would those who allegedly worship you want kryptonite?” Gangbuster asked.

“That’s a good question,” Clark agreed.

“Tell me,” the helmeted hero started. “Were any of the ones arrested wearing a baseball cap?”

Clark shook his head, and Gangbuster sighed.

“You being here,” said Clark. “It was about him, wasn’t it? Stopping corporate robberies isn’t your usual scene.”

Gangbuster removed his helmet. “My name is José Delgado,” he said. “I’m a teacher. One of my students was hurt in a gang shooting.”

“And he’s the one who did it?” Clark asked.

José nodded.

Clark took a deep breath. “Do you know where we might find him?”

---
**Suicide Slum**

*Later*

---

Superman broke down the wall of an abandoned factory, revealing several people jumping to their feet from lounge furniture.

Clark used his heat vision to disarm any who pulled out guns as José ran inside wielding a pair of nunchakus that was previously adorned to his stomach.

José spun them around, knocking back any gang members who tried to attack him, while Clark sped over to any of the others who went after a crate of weapons in the corner.

“Where’s Hatz?” asked José sternly.

“Answer him,” Clark backed him up, his eyes turning red.

“Hatz left us,” one of them spoke up. “He found God or sumthin’.”

“God?” José asked. “He joined a Superman cult.”

Every time that group was mentioned, Clark was uneasy. Sure, he could wrap his head around people hating him. But to think of him like a god? He was just a farmboy from Kansas.

“Where can we find him?” José asked.

“We got no idea,” the same man answered. “He hasn’t been to his place since.”

“But, we do know where those Superman nuts he hangs out with meet,” another added.

“Yeah, he tried to recruit some of us there at the start,” the first one clarified.

José moved closer. “Where?” he asked.

“Downtown,” they shared. “There’s an old mechanic’s place they own. The sign says ‘Chubb’s.’”

José turned back to the door.

Clark took a moment and then looked over at the crate in the corner. He sped over and ripped it apart, letting the assortment of guns fall into a giant pile. He heated up his eyes until the weapons melted together in a pile of useless metal.

---

**Downtown**

*Later*

---

Hatz entered the old mechanic shop and dropped into one of the chairs. It had been a long day. Several of his fellow members were caught, but the mission was done. Superman himself interfered, but he didn’t know better. He didn’t know their mission would save his life.

The door broke open, and he found Superman himself there, along with a masked man. He’d heard of him before: He was fighting gangs in Suicide Slum. Why was he working with The Man of Steel?

Hatz jumped out of his chair.

“You,” Gangbuster said. “You’re finally going down. Not for what you should be, but it’ll do.”

“Wh-what?” Hatz asked.

“You shot a little girl,” Gangbuster explained.

“Oh, God,” said Hatz, dropping to his knees. “I didn’t mean to do that.”

“It doesn’t matter,” said José, letting a punch fly into the former gang member’s face.

Clark moved forward but stopped when he saw José pull back.

“She could have died,” José continued.

“I know!” Hatz yelled. “That’s why I left! I couldn’t live with myself.”

“Oh,” said José, but shook it off. “It still doesn’t matter. You should have turned yourself in. That’s the only path to forgiveness.”

“I took another path,” Hatz explained. “I had a new mission that would do more good than the bad I’ve done.”

“Stealing from S.T.A.R. Labs?” asked Clark, finally stepping into the conversation.

“The kryptonite we stole is the only thing that will save you,” said Hatz. “Our mission was to save you from your greatest enemy who’s coming.”

There was only a select group of enemies against whom blue kryptonite would even have an effect.

“And who is that?” asked Clark.

“I don’t know,” said Hatz. “They didn’t say.”

“Who didn’t say?” Clark pressed.

Hatz exhaled slowly before answering. “The Snake Kids: Snake Girl and Serpenteen.”

And there it was. He knew their names would come up again. They were pulling strings behind Humans First, The Saved, and the Superman worshippers. Groups that had very different and even conflicting methodologies. But to what purpose? And what did The Fortress have to do with it?

---

**Fortress of Solitude**

*Sometime Later*

---

Kelex floated around, performing calculations on increasing the range in long-range scanners used by the Justice League Watchtower to monitor for potential incoming threats. A phone call popped up in his visor, and he answered it.

“*Kal-El*,” he said. “*It’s always good to hear from you.*”

“You too, Kelex,” said Clark. “We have reason to believe The Fortress may be targeted.”

“*I see*,” said Kelex. “*Our security has never been stronger, but I’ll make sure we’re on high alert.*”

“Thank you,” said Clark. “I’ll stop by later to check things out for myself.”

“*Sounds good, sir,*” said Kelex. “*Goodbye for now.*”

Kelex hung up and returned to his duties momentarily before the lights flickered.

“*What was that*?” asked Kelex aloud, checking for system alerts, but nothing showed up. “*I better run a full diagnostics just in case.*”

For example, the other day he climbed on the counter, and as I was running to get him he fell and landed on his back. Then he got up and said “I think I need to try that again.” Today he managed to grab the freshly brewed pot of coffee that I have told him a million times is very hot and can burn him.

Imagine this: it’s the summer of 2054. We’re on the porch of a cozy house—one of those timeless places where the steps creak like old memories and the swing hums softly in the evening breeze. The sky is a canvas of gold and fire, and we’re there, painting it with laughter and shared stories. The kind of tales that weave themselves into your soul: travels that shaped us, mishaps that made us laugh, and quiet moments where no words were needed—just the warmth of each other’s company.

It’s not about grand adventures every day, but about finding magic in the ordinary—the way the sunset turns the edges of the world golden or how a shared silence can feel louder than words. Now, I’m here searching for the co-author of this future. Could it be you?

# A Little About Me

I’m a contradiction wrapped in curiosity. A writer of thoughts, a collector of sunsets, and a seeker of those fleeting moments that remind us how beautiful the world can be. Quiet at first, but if you’re patient, you’ll find someone who speaks in passions and listens like it’s the most important thing they could ever do.

Right now, I’m looking for **a friendship** that feels like the first chapter of a well-worn book—something natural, unforced, where we build a connection page by page. I believe the best stories begin with a spark of understanding, and maybe, just maybe, they grow into something more.

**Here’s what makes my story unique:**  
🎵 **Music as a Muse:** A future vinyl collector searching for a space, a lover of playlists that take you on a journey, and songs that feel like a warm hug. Music has a unique way of connecting moments, and I love finding the perfect soundtrack for every memory. Got a favorite song? Share it—I’m always ready to discover melodies that move you.  
🌍 **Adventure in My Veins:** Whether it’s chasing the perfect golden-hour light, wandering through unfamiliar streets, or hiking trails that lead to breathtaking views, I’m all about exploring the world—both near and far. Life’s too short not to follow the whispers of adventure.  
📚 **Wordsmith at Heart:** Writing is my way of capturing the fleeting and the unforgettable. I love playing with words until they reflect the emotions I can’t quite say aloud. And recently, I’ve been dabbling in photography—turning moments into memories through a lens.  
🕹️ **Low-Key Gamer:** When the world feels too loud, there’s something comforting about a quiet night in with a good game or a classic movie marathon.

# What I’m Looking For

I’m searching for someone who’s as curious about the world as I am—a woman who is kind at heart, sharp of mind, and carries a quiet strength that makes you want to know every story behind her smile. Someone who’s not just eager to explore the world around us but also willing to dive into the uncharted territory of creating a world together.

A partner in curiosity, someone who loves sharing dreams and building them into something real. Whether it’s small projects, grand adventures, or simply learning to navigate life’s challenges side by side, I want to create something unique with you—a shared journey filled with meaning, discovery, and connection.

# What Sets Me Apart

I see life as a tapestry of little details: the way sunlight dances on leaves, the rhythm of rain on a quiet afternoon, or the poetry of a shared moment that feels too good to end. I’ll notice the way your eyes light up when you talk about something you love, and I’ll make a mental note of your favorite coffee order—not because I have to, but because I want to.

Loyalty is my cornerstone. I’ll show up, not just in the big moments, but in the small ones too—the random text when I know you’re having a rough day, the laughter when you need a distraction, or simply being there when you feel like the world isn’t. The best stories aren’t about grand gestures; they’re about the quiet consistency of someone who’s truly there for you.

I’m also a romantic—not in the cliché way, but in the way that makes you feel seen. Sweet gestures, thoughtful words, and a knack for making everyday moments feel special. I’m the kind of person who’ll leave you a note in your favorite book, point out constellations during a midnight drive, or turn a casual Sunday into something unforgettable.

And when it comes to connection, I value honesty above all. If something’s on your mind, I’ll always want to hear it. Because real stories—the ones worth telling—are built on truth, not games.

# What About You?

Are you the kind of person who finds beauty in the cracks of everyday life? Who laughs easily, dreams deeply, and values honesty like a rare gem? Maybe you’re someone who savors both the quiet moments and the spontaneous ones—a cozy evening in or a bold adventure out.

Let’s start as friends, as kindred spirits who share an appreciation for the world’s quirks and wonders. Maybe we’ll swap stories, exchange playlists, or even embark on an adventure or two.

However, incorporating [home and hearth](https://www.truegether.com/category/antiques) antiques into a modern living space can be both challenging and rewarding. These vintage treasures, whether they're a classic wood-burning stove or an antique armchair, have the potential to infuse warmth, personality, and character into your home. The juxtaposition of traditional pieces within contemporary settings is not only aesthetically pleasing but also speaks volumes about your appreciation for history, quality, and sustainability. This article will guide you on how to seamlessly blend home and hearth antiques into your modern living space, while offering some statistics and tips on how they enhance both style and functionality.

**The Enduring Appeal of Antiques in Modern Homes**

Incorporating antiques into a modern living space isn't just about design—it's also about creating a living environment that tells a story. According to a report by *Antique Trader*, the antique furniture market was valued at approximately $14.6 billion in 2022 and is expected to grow in the coming years as more people are drawn to the unique charm of older, hand-crafted items. The increasing popularity of sustainable living and a desire for individuality are driving people away from mass-produced modern furniture and towards more personalized, timeless choices.

Home and hearth antiques, specifically, include items like vintage fireplaces, old-fashioned stoves, cast iron accessories, and antique wooden furniture—pieces that were once functional but now stand as beautiful, decorative elements. These items often come with their own history and craftsmanship that cannot be replicated today. The process of integrating these pieces into a modern setting can be a delightful challenge, one that requires thoughtful planning to ensure that the two styles complement each other rather than clash.

**1. Start with Statement Pieces**

One of the easiest ways to incorporate home and hearth antiques into your space is to begin with a statement piece. These are large, attention-grabbing items that can serve as the focal point of a room. Examples include a classic cast iron fireplace, an antique wood stove, or a vintage leather armchair. These pieces bring an instant sense of history and nostalgia to any room.

For instance, a restored wood stove in the kitchen not only provides a rustic touch but also serves as a functional centerpiece. These vintage stoves can be both decorative and practical, with modern counterparts often costing thousands of dollars. Antique wood stoves, however, can be found for a fraction of the price at antique shops or online marketplaces.

**Tip**: When incorporating large statement pieces, ensure they have enough breathing room in the space. Let them stand out without overwhelming the rest of the room.

**2. Mix with Modern Elements**

The key to successfully combining antiques with contemporary design is finding balance. Home and hearth antiques should be used to complement, not dominate, the space. In this case, less is often more. While you may want to incorporate a few key pieces, mixing them with more modern furniture and décor will allow your antiques to shine without overwhelming the room.

For example, if you have an antique armoire, pair it with a modern, minimalist sofa or coffee table. The contrast between the sleek lines of contemporary furniture and the rich textures of an antique piece creates a harmonious blend that celebrates both styles. Similarly, you can juxtapose a vintage cast iron kettle or teapot with modern ceramic mugs on your kitchen shelf to create a delightful fusion of past and present.

Statistics show that 69% of interior designers recommend mixing old and new furnishings to create a balanced aesthetic. This combination creates a unique and sophisticated atmosphere, where both antique and modern pieces add value to the overall design.

**Tip**: Use color schemes to tie modern and antique elements together. Neutral tones like grays, whites, and beiges can help balance the look.

**3. Repurpose Antique Hearth Items for Modern Functionality**

Antique hearth items, such as fireplace tools or brass candelabras, are often seen as outdated. However, with a little creativity, these items can be repurposed for modern use while retaining their vintage charm.

For example, antique fireplace tools like tongs, pokers, and shovels can be transformed into unique wall hangings or used to create interesting art pieces. Alternatively, a vintage brass fire screen can double as a decorative partition or wall art.

A growing trend is to turn old wooden mantels or rustic stone hearths into kitchen islands or bathroom vanities. This practice not only gives a new life to these vintage elements but also introduces a sense of warmth and character into spaces that are often overlooked.

**Tip**: Consider using fireplace accessories such as andirons or old lanterns as functional, yet decorative, elements on shelves or tabletops.

**4. Create a Cozy, Vintage-Inspired Atmosphere**

Home and hearth antiques are ideal for creating a cozy and inviting atmosphere. Items like plush antique armchairs, woolen throws, and vintage rugs help to create a space that feels lived-in and comforting. A well-worn leather chair or a Persian rug can instantly make your home feel warmer and more intimate.

To create a truly vintage-inspired space, you can combine old-fashioned furniture with modern lighting and accessories. For instance, an antique rocking chair placed next to a contemporary lamp with sleek lines offers the perfect blend of comfort and style.

**Tip**: Layering textures such as antique quilts, plush throws, and modern linen cushions can help add warmth and depth to your living space.

**5. Antiques in the Kitchen: Blending Function with Tradition**

The kitchen is another area where home and hearth antiques can thrive. Vintage kitchenware, such as enamelware, antique spice racks, and old wooden cutting boards, can add a rustic touch to your kitchen, while still serving practical purposes.

For example, hanging an antique cast iron skillet on the wall not only gives the space an industrial feel but also brings a sense of nostalgia and history. Antique copper pots or a vintage farmhouse sink can be incorporated into modern kitchen designs to give the room a homey, lived-in feel. The key is to strike a balance between practical and decorative uses of these items.

According to a survey by *Better Homes & Gardens*, 45% of homeowners say they prefer to mix antique and contemporary pieces in their kitchens to create a stylish yet functional space.

**Tip**: Display antique dishware or bakeware on open shelving for a charming vintage look that still serves a functional purpose.

**6. Sustainability and Value: The Eco-Friendly Appeal of Antiques**

In today's world, sustainability is a key consideration when decorating. Antiques, especially home and hearth antiques, are a great way to embrace sustainable living. By incorporating vintage items into your home, you're not only reducing waste by reusing items but also supporting the preservation of craftsmanship that may otherwise be lost.

Antiques have an inherent value that modern mass-produced items often lack. Many of these pieces are made from high-quality materials, ensuring their durability. As people become more aware of environmental concerns, the shift towards second-hand and vintage furniture has been growing. In fact, a *ThredUp* report shows that the secondhand market is expected to surpass $51 billion by 2028, driven by consumers seeking more sustainable alternatives.

**Tip**: When choosing antiques, research their provenance and craftsmanship to ensure you're purchasing high-quality pieces that will stand the test of time.

**Conclusion**

Incorporating home and hearth antiques into your modern living space is not only a way to preserve history but also a means to create a unique, personalized environment. From repurposing antique items for modern functionality to blending them with sleek, contemporary furnishings, there are countless ways to embrace the old while celebrating the new. As you explore different ways to integrate these vintage treasures into your home, remember that the beauty of antiques lies in their ability to tell a story—one that adds warmth, charm, and a sense of timeless elegance to your modern living space.

By thoughtfully mixing and matching, you'll create a harmonious balance where the past and present coexist beautifully, enriching your home with layers of history, personality, and style.

My company-issue security cruiser trundled along the ice-coated road as I made my way to the suspect’s home. Named for its long, harsh winters, the planet Persephone was far from perfect by colonist standards. With chilly summers and downright freezing winters, Persephone certainly wouldn’t be picked as a resort world anytime soon. Apparently, however, its natural abundance of cobalt and other metals was enough to convince Prism—a cellphone company—to cough up the cash for a colony.

Of course, as far as colonizing other planets went, there was only one name in the game. Whether it be a company or country making the call, Neverland Colonial Technologies was always on the other end. Everything a client could want from a colony, the company would provide. Prefabricated buildings, infrastructure, and even colony policing. That was where I came in.

*“Status report on our alleged dealer?”* Officer Smith asked through my radio right as I came to a stop in front of the apartment building three blocks from where our guy gave some poor kid the dose he’d end up dying from. 

“Pulling up now,” I sighed, putting the car in park and stepping out into the snow. My job as a colonial security officer was pretty much the same as that of a cop back on Earth—keep the peace, enforce the law, protect the community. Most of the time what that meant was standing outside of public spaces to discourage the local punks from trying anything funny. 

Stepping into the apartment lobby and making my way upstairs to the third floor, I kindly waved tenants back into their apartments with my right hand as they peered out to see me passing by, all the while keeping my left firmly at my side for quick access to my service weapon should the need to use it arise. 

Stalking up to the suspect’s door and wrapping my knuckles firmly against it, I spoke with volume just short of a shout. “Mr. Johan. This is Officer Ambrose, NCT security. Open up.”

No response. 

Inside the suspect’s apartment, I could just barely make out the sound of footsteps pacing past the door. After at least ten seconds had passed without a word from the suspect, I once again knocked on the door and announced myself. “NCT security. I’m here on a warrant issued by Persephone’s Global Charter legal counsel. Open this damn door!”

*Silence.*

Neverland Colonial Technologies took great pains to ensure that its policies were in compliance with Global Charter legislation. Unlike the toothless United Nations that preceded it, the Global Charter had all the power it needed to enforce its rules—something a certain now-bankrupt tech giant found out the hard way when it was discovered that they were practicing slavery on one of their colony worlds. Among the policies and procedures from their Policing Accord adopted by NCT was the Three Knock Rule, which stated that when carrying out a warranted search, officers were obligated to knock three times, with at least a ten second interval between each one. This rule could be waived if there was sufficient reason to believe someone’s life was in immediate danger, but for drug busts like this it was pretty set in stone. 

Raising my right knuckle to the door for a third time, I raised my voice to supply one final warning. “You have ten seconds before I kick this door down. Unless you wanna pay to replace the frame, I’d recommend you make this easy on both of us and let me in!”

Inside the apartment, I could vaguely hear the sound of a toilet attempting to flush, followed by water hitting the tile floor as it overflowed.

“Three…Two…*One*,” I murmured to myself before reeling back my boot and slamming it hard into Eddy Johan’s front door, forcing it open with the sound of splintering wood to reveal behind it the suspect’s filthy, disorganized living quarters. Standing there on the left side of the room, I saw Eddy drenched in sweat, wearing slippers soaked in toilet water. “Hands where I can see ‘em!” I demanded, drawing my rail pistol and lining up the barrel with his chest.

“Officer Ambrose!” Began Eddy with a clearly forced smile as he reluctantly complied with my demand. “What, uh, what brings you here?” He chuckled, refusing to get within two meters of me as he shuffled back toward the bathroom entrance and positioned himself in front of it.

“Don’t play dumb with me!” I growled, gesturing with my gun for him to step aside. “You know exactly why I’m here.”

“Y-you really don’t wanna go in there!” Pleaded the suspect as I lowered my weapon and stepped past him to investigate what he was trying to flush. As expected, what I found lodged within was a plastic bag full of white powder. 

Turning back toward the suspect and regarding him with a glare, I asked. “Just how stupid do you think I am?”

“You want the honest answer to that?” He snarked, quickly bringing my blood to a boil with his sheer nonchalance.

“You think this is *funny*?” I barked, grabbing Eddy by the shirt and pinning his back against the wall behind him. “A mother buried her son yesterday because of you. Hell, if it were up to me, I’d put a bullet in your skull and call it frontier justice.”

Eddy’s face hardened into a scowl as he fruitlessly labored to pry my hand off of him. “You can cut with the whole ‘boy scout’ act!” He hissed, finally managing to free himself from my grip. “You’re not even a real cop; just another NCT corporate bootlicker playing dress-up!”

“Well, you’re halfway right.” I replied with a sigh, holstering my weapon so as to free up both of my hands before wrestling him to the ground. “I might not \*technically\* be a cop, but I’m no bootlicker!” I continued, clapping on the handcuffs before leaning in to talk directly into his ear. “I *am* the boot!”

Shepherding our guy down the apartment stairs and out into my cruiser’s backseat separated from the front by steel mesh, I popped a cigarette into my mouth and stepped into the driver’s seat.

“Those things’ll kill ya’, officer!” Eddy quipped, rapidly regaining his usual shit-eating grin. 

“What part of ‘right to remain silent’ don’t you understand?” I snapped back, reminding the suspect of what I had told him on our way down. “This being your fourth arrest I thought you’d have it memorized by now.”

Driving through the colony’s grid-like streets set between dreary prefab buildings, I grabbed my radio and contacted the security station. “This is Officer Ambrose, I’m bringing in the suspect now. ETA is five minutes.”

“So what is it that brought you to this shithole?” Asked Eddy from the backseat, staring out the cruiser window at Persephone’s snow-covered landscape. “Other than the perfect swimsuit weather, that is!”

“I was top of my class with a gun, but apparently a C on the written test only gets you so far,” I replied with a shrug, not caring about the scumbag’s opinion of me enough to lie. A little better on the NCT Security Officer Exam and I probably would have been stationed on a resort world somewhere, sipping on margaritas after every shift. *“Besides,”* I murmured beneath my breath. *“Where else can a convicted felon make this kind of salary?”*

Neverland Colonial Technologies was the biggest employer of ex-cons there was: a fact they frequently flaunted as proof of their ‘commitment to rehabilitation’. The actual reason was much less glamorous. Felons had innately fewer options for gainful employment, so they were far less likely to risk unionizing. Since my only crime (that they could actually pin on me) was tax fraud, I was allowed to become a security officer for the company. As for what they \*couldn’t\* pin on me, let’s just say there’s a reason I’m so damn good with a gun

.	Pulling up to headquarters and parking in my cruiser’s reserved space just outside the front door, I grabbed Eddy from the back seat and herded him into the lobby, where Sheriff Doe was waiting to receive him. 

“Good work, Rowan!” Doe remarked, ignoring Johan’s inane chatter as he signaled for Officers Gail and Jovi to take the guy away. “By the way: Anita and Jen from the bakery sent us some doughnuts. They’re in the break room if you wanna go ahead and help yourself.”

“You know what? I think I just might,” I shrugged before making my way down the hall towards our lounge.

Stepping into the break room, I was immediately greeted by the twin scents of fresh coffee and warm glaze. Just as the sheriff promised, three half-full boxes of doughnuts were lined up beside the coffee pot. Grabbing one of the pastries and popping a hot-chocolate pod into the coffee machine (I’m not a coffee guy), I approached a two-person table halfway occupied by our forensics girl, Destiny, whose eyes were firmly glued to the television screen as yet another news report droned on about the disappearance of the Virgo Cluster.

“You’d think after a month they’d find something else to talk about,” I shrugged, removing the now-stumpy cigarette from my mouth and putting it out on the ashtray before taking a bite of my doughnut. I’ll admit, it was pretty fun at first watching the eggheads squirm, but that source of entertainment lost its luster after about a week of nonstop coverage. From the way they talked about it, you’d swear the world was about to end.

“Are you kidding?” Destiny asked, not even turning to face me. “The disappearance of the Virgo Cluster defies everything we know about how the universe works.”

Onscreen, some sweaty scientist with bags under his eyes continued to rattle off the egghead collective’s newest theory. \*“Gravitational readings are consistent with the cluster’s presence, implying that its mass is still there. What we could be looking at is a localized ‘Big Crunch’ event!”\*

Naturally, I had absolutely no clue what that meant. ‘Big Crunch’ just sounded to me like the name of an off brand candy bar. 

“It’s the opposite of a big bang,” Destiny clarified, evidently knowing me well enough to understand the limits of my knowledge. “An entire cluster of galaxies condensed into a single point of infinite density.”

“And what could possibly do something like that?” I asked, more intrigued by this theory than the last three due to its sheer absurdity. 

Silence fell between us as Destiny continued staring into the screen. When finally she spoke, her tone carried with it a foreboding chill. “Absolutely nothing,” she began before taking a long sip of her coffee. “As far as our current models of physics go, it *should be* impossible.”

Crossing the room to retrieve my drink, I returned to my seat only to find the previous broadcast replaced by meaningless static. “What the hell?” I growled, standing up once more to investigate the television for loose cables. My search, however, was quickly interrupted when Sheriff Doe’s voice crackled through my radio.

\*“Interstellar communications just went offline,”\* he broadcast through our radio network’s open channel, ensuring that his message would be received by every officer on duty. 

*“Probably that damn receiver dish again,”* Sighed Officer Smith, his words over the radio echoed by his real voice in the next room over. *“That snowstorm last night was pretty intense. Maybe it knocked something loose?”*

Strange as it was for our communication line with the rest of humanity to be cut off so suddenly, I quickly categorized the event as ‘not my problem’ and prepared to move on with my evening. However, before I could even finish my drink in the break room, I was approached by Officer Smith.

“What is it?” I asked him, preparing myself mentally for whatever random task I had been unwittingly volunteered for.

“The satellite techs are requesting an officer escort,” he told me. “It’s getting dark out, and the wenders hunt at night. They said they won’t fix it without someone to back them up and I know how much you love community outreach, so I volunteered to do your job while you go help them.”

“Joy,” I sighed, standing up and cracking my back before approaching the front door without so much as another word to the other officers. As expected, the technicians’ truck was waiting outside for me.

“Thank you, Officer,” the younger of the technicians smiled, stepping out of the passenger side and allowing me to assume his seat. “Normally, we don’t repair the dish after dark, but the sheriff insisted.”

“That he did…” The older technician growled, pulling out of the parking lot and beginning the twenty minute drive out to where the dish was. “And there’s not a damn chance I’m going out without someone to watch my back. I came face to face alone with the local wildlife once and once was once too many.”

“Don’t gotta tell me twice,” I shrugged, lighting up once again before holding the cigarette between my fingertips. Wenders were the local apex predator; so named for their uncanny resemblance to a creature from Algonquin folklore. Their heads looked like those of deer, but with the unnerving additions of forward-facing eyes and razor sharp teeth. From the neck down, they looked like freakishly-tall chimps, averaging at around seven or eight feet tall. Terrifying as the bastards look, though, they’re not malevolent spirits: just opportunistic carnivores looking for their next meal. Usually a warning shot is enough to scare ‘em away. If not, my rail pistol’s got the stopping power to put one down.

Gravel and snow crunched beneath the maintenance truck’s tires as we trundled beyond the city limits to where the main dish was about ten miles out. “Why the hell did the company feel the need to build this thing so far from the city?” I asked the techs more out of frustration than genuine curiosity.

“Do we look like civil engineers to you?” The younger tech asked rhetorically, answering my question with a question of his own. “We just make sure it works like it’s supposed to.”

“Speaking of: any idea what might be broken?” I asked.

For the next minute or so, I stared blankly ahead as the two techs debated their theories. The younger insisted that the issue was probably a misalignment of the dish caused by snow heaped onto it, while the senior technician posited a transmitter malfunction as the reason behind it. 

Suddenly, my radio roared to life as the sheriff’s voice rang through it. “Sheriff Doe speaking. Orbital defenses have been taken offline! Something is in our airspace! I repeat: something is in our airspace!”

“The hell?” I murmured, pressing down on my radio’s transmission button before speaking into it. “This is Officer Ambrose; can you ID the hostiles?”

“Radar says there’s thirty of ‘em right above us. They aren’t responding to any hails.”

For the next few minutes as we continued our drive out to the receiver dish, the line was alive with chatter. Every security officer on Persephone wanted to know what was going on and what should be done about it. Pirates were a rare occurrence even on the outskirts of human expansion, and they usually broadcast demands before even entering orbit.

Pulling up to the communications array and stepping out alongside the two techs, I was just about to press down on the radio’s transmitter button when the dissonant voices coming from it fell silent, replaced by static all at once as though someone had flipped a switch.

“This is Officer Ambrose. Can anyone hear me?” I shouted into the radio, desperate for some kind of response. 

Then, through the device’s crackling static, *something* spoke up.

*“Nos paenitet…”*

Looking behind us back toward the colony, I watched as a blinding blue light shone from the night sky, illuminating the darkness like lightning to reveal a fleet of strangely-shaped ships, with the light itself originating from the largest—an octagonal vessel at least a mile wide.

I barely saw the lance of light touch down. It flashed for a fraction of a second, and yet even miles away I felt a slight surge of warmth as it carved into the center of town, right where our headquarters was.

“You two,” I shouted to the pair of now motionless techs, both of whom now stared at the sky in horror. “Go inside, seal the doors, and try to send a distress signal to the global charter!” Reaching into my pocket and producing a high-power taser, I tossed it to the younger of the two. “In case of uninvited guests,” I said before snatching the truck keys from the other guy’s hand and climbing into the driver’s seat, burning rubber on my way back to the colony.",12,1733073581.0,HFY,3,1.0,False

","**Why**

 We hope this guide can be useful for people that want to travel to Thailand who don't have that much experience in traveling.

**Travel profile**

M (33 year) and F (35 year). We appreciate comfort but are also looking to add a bit of adventure.

**My travel experience**

* Lot of trips in Europe
* Previous trips outside of Europe
   * 3 x NYC
   * Senegal
   * India (Golden Triangle + Bangalore)
   * Nepal
   * Thailand (Bangkok / Phuket) + Maleysia ( Kuala Lumpur / Cameron Highlands)  + Singapore
   * Sri Lanka

 **Trip background**

 Our initial idea was to go to Vietnam this year. However, earlier this year my girlfriend was diagnosed with breast cancer. The last 6 months I've seen the inside of the hospital much more than I've seen it my entire life. For the ones that haven't gone through something similar (and I don't wish this upon anyone), basically doctors dictate many aspects of your life during the treatment. Especially in the beginning, appointments are scheduled without any prior consultation. Your full-time job is now being a cancer patient so you are expected to be available at any time the hospital sees fit. Don't get me wrong, we received great care and are grateful for the quality of health care we could benefit from. However next to the physical effects of treatment, the mental aspect is equally though. While the treatment was progressing, we discussed safe holiday destinations with the oncologist. After 16 rounds of chemo, the chance of anything happening is much higher than your average 30-year old. The basic premise of our destination was availability of qualitative hospitals. Western Europe was highlighted as rich of potential destinations but we did had our minds on some more distant travel. Vietnam (and for some reason Cambodja was dragged into this as the oncologist had done some volunteering there) were not deemed cancer-patient-proof.  After a few seconds of frowning the oncologist dropped Thailand and Singapore as potential destinations. This might sound like an extreme first-world problem, however getting back some freedom in your life felt as such a big victory at the time. So Thailand it is!

 

 **Day 1: Friday 9th of August**

 

After planning our trip for many weeks, we finally set of on our trip. We dropped of our cat at our friends and parked at the train station where 3 trains later we arrived at Brussels Airport. We stopped for a quick beer (Hoegaarden & Liefmans, 8 EUR) at Beers & Cheers in Terminal A (playing a nice dice game :[https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/15818/pickomino](https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/15818/pickomino)) after which we moved our assess through passport control to terminal B. Our first flight operated by Emirates took us to Dubai. We moved to our next flight while watching the semi-finals of Belgium - France of the Women's basketball (we lost after locking in overtime with a 3-point buzzer beater).

 

**Day 2 : Saturday 10th of August**

 

Overall flights were great. The luxury problem was that Emirates entertainment choice was so wide it was difficult to find a movie. We landed at a little before 1 PM Bangkok local time. I envy people who can sleep on planes (in Economy), I locked in the full 15 minutes. Border control and grabbing our luggage took roundabout 30 mins. After purchasing an eSim we took an official cab and were stupid enough to accept the price offer of 800 Bath to get us to the city center. I still consider it fair knowing I paid as much in 2016 and all in all 800 Bath for a 50 min drive is not the end of the world (however you can get cheaper: see below).

 

Our first hotel was the Chillax Heritage Hotel Khaosan (Yes I'm aware of Khaosan road) were we paid approx 50 EUR / night. We freshened up after stinking on the plane and looked for some lunch as we were both starving. We walked right out of our hotel and pretty much stopped at the first restaurant we passed (Hemlock) after my girlfriend looked at the Google Maps reviews as she wouldn't step a foot in something with less than 4 stars). We landed on fried yellow curry rice with chicken for myself and stir-fry chicken with holy basil for my better half. As our stomachs were emptier than a banker's heart, we played our dice game a bit to not focus too much on the growling sounds. When our meals arrived and we took our first bite it felt like a lot of the stress piled up from the past months disappeared. Oh my god do we love the richness of the Thai cuisine. We devoured our dishes and set of to the pier to get to the tourist hop-on hop-off boat (40 bath per person single ride) which took us to Wat Arun for our first visit. If you ask me, it's a must see but we were overwhelmed by the literal hundreds of people (okay yeah maybe ""only"" dozens of people) that were dressed up in Thai traditional clothing and had extensive photograph sessions. After walking around a bit we took a tuktuk to ""Wat Prayurawongsawas Worawihan"" (60 bath) . The sheer contrast with Wat Arun was amazing. While we couldn't had a decent picture of the monument / part of the monument without people on it at Wat Arun, at this temple were only with one other couple. The contrasting silence was tremendous to witness.

 

After our second temple visit we walked over the bridge crossing the Chao Praya and walked towards Chinatown. We made our first stop at 7/11 and bought our first of many Singha soda waters. After walking around a bit we quickly settled for Pad Thai and enjoyed our first Changs of the trip (330 Bath for 3 x Changs and 2 x Pad Thai). The travel really started to drag us down and we jumped in an overpriced tuktuk (250 Bath, sometimes you're just too tired to haggle) that brought us to our temporary home.

 

**Day 3: Sunday 11th of August.**

 

The best sleeps in my life I had were those nights after traveling East and not being able to sleep on the plane. After a non-stop session of 10 hours I started to slowly getting awake enjoying that feeling where you have the full holiday still ahead of you and you are just so grateful of the comfort of a bed versus being stuck in a plane seat trying out 50 positions of not being able to sleep. When getting ready I noticed one of pants had a front pocket with a hole in. We consulted the hotel lobby and they directed us to a nice women 200 meters down the road. When I presented the pants to her she grabbed them out of my hands and used a pair of scissors to remove the pocket. After sewing in a nice replacement she was happy with the 20 bath tip on top of the 50 bath she asked us.  We went over to take the hop-on hop-off boat again and took off to the Grand Palace. We left an exit too soon and walked direction Grand Palace. I have an excellent memory from being here in 2016 and guided my girlfriend and myself to the entrance of the Grand Palace, paid the 300 Bath per person entry fee. After entering we looked for a guide to escort us around but we were told there's no guides here and we might have better luck at the .. Grand palace. Oh right, we were actually at Wat Pho, thanks excellent memory. We walked around the temple, had the obligatory picture of the laying Budha and set off for a quick lunch. After 2 x stir frieds we set off to the actual Grand Palace and managed to find a guide here that offered a 1h trip for 600 Bath and 1h30 trip for 800 Bath. We agreed on 1h30 , paid the 500 Bath entry fee per person and explored the magnificent architecture while being explained the history of Thailand and the Royal Family. You can't openly critize the Royal Family but apparently you can fire up sarcastic comments about their faithful values. At the end of the trip our guide respectfully asked if we have any Euro coins with the face of the new Belgium king but we had to disappoint him. We went back to the hotel via boat transfer and freshened up to go to the to pool. The pool of our hotel is located on the roof and the bar can be accessed from within the swimming pool. We took place in the prime seats and ordered 2 Gin Tonics (220 bath each) and enjoyed the complimentary appetizer (Spicy BBQ chicken wings) during their happy hour from 5-7PM. After a testing session of Singha and Chang (Chang wins) we freshened up again and went for dinner close to our hotel in the Thanom Ram Buttri ally. We went for a Som Tum salad, Massaman Curry and Tom Kha soup (approx 280 Bath for the food). We went to a close by bar for a last night cap and opened up a card game we bought for the trip ([https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/391625/the-brain](https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/391625/the-brain)). Unlike a lot of other games, in this game you actually need to team up with the contenders to win and get rid of all the cards. We played a few rounds but didn't manage to win yet and set off to the hotel around 11 PM.

 

**Day 4: Monday 12th of August**

 

Jetlagged kicked in this night. My girlfriend and I did a changing-of-the-guard routine where she didn't manage to sleep the first 3 hours-ish of the night and then I got awake and didn't manage to sleep the second 3 hours-ish of the night. At about 6 o'clock we woke up and got ready to go to the Thonburi Railway Station to go to Kanchanaburi. We checked out and asked the hotel to get us a taxi. The doorman helped us get a taxi and said it would be 200 bath. He discussed some items in Thai with a first cab that didn't accept our ride (we thought) but we were more lucky with the second one.  While we stepped in the car I saw the driver slip a 20 to the doorman and we set off. I know, we should just have gotten the meter. The taxi dropped us of at the train station and we bought 2 tickets third class to our destination (approx 150 Bath pp). At the tran station we also saw a German couple with their 2 kids boarding the train as well. Along the 2h30 train ride we mostly played our addictive card game Brain and had a pleasant uneventful journey. Arriving at Kanchanaburi a larger version of the tuktuk took us to our hotel (Good Times Resort, 40 EUR per night) for 100 Bath (5 mins drive). As our room wasn't ready yet, we dropped of our luggage and rented a scooter at the hotel (300 Bath 24 hours). At that point, I've been awake for approx 7 hours and I was starving to get some food. My Google-maps-review addict directed us to an approved 4,5+ star restaurant and we settled for a small lunch (fried rice, cashew tofu stir fry, 250 Bath). After lunch we walked over the bridge over the river Kwai, explored a bit the surroundings at the other side and went to the nearby war museum (50 bath pp entry fee). We were a bit tired and cooked from the heath and went back to the hotel. My girlfriend napped in the room and I started to read a new book I brought at the pool ([https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/60194162-demon-copperhead](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/60194162-demon-copperhead)). Around 5 PM we got ready to visit some small temples in the city center and visited the Skywalk. We scootered back to the hotel and set off on foot for some apero & dinner at a nearby restaurant. We saw the same German couple with their kids again that we saw in the Thonburi station.. After some Changs, some stir fried dishes and some more of our card game we got back to the hotel. Over dinner we discussed the planning for the next day. Earlier that day, we discussed a bit with the people at the reception of the hotel how to get best to Erawan national park. We had booked a hotel close to the park (or we thought so) but apparently we would still be 10km out and it would be a hassle to get there by public bus (our original idea). Instead, we were lucky that the hotel had one more room available (one that they didn't advertise online as it was a bit smaller but still giving all the comfort we needed, 25 EUR per night). Instead of the hassle of going to a hotel in the middle of nowhere, nothing nearby etc we booked a transfer to the Erawan National Park + Tiger temple (1400 Bath in total for the car+driver) and booked an extra room in the Good Times Resort and cancelled the other hotel we had booked. After going through all the administration we went to our room, played a few more rounds of our card game and went to bed.

 

**Day 5: Tuesday 13th of August**

 

We woke up, grabbed a nice breakfast (omelet made based on request, fresh mango, watermelon & dragon fruit, fresh noodles) and packed our bags (we could leave them in the room and the staff would put them in our new room). We set of in our car for a 45 min ride and low and behold we played our card game in the car. That wasn’t necessarily a very good idea because the curvy roads + sitting sideways and looking at cards actually induced some car sickness. I had to stay quiet the last 15 mins, focus on the road and take some small breaths to avoid a mandatory stop (and risk of not stopping on time). We paid 300 Bath entry fee per person at the national park, paid 20 Bath pp to rent obligatory safety jackets and paid a 20 bath deposit per bottle you bring in the national park (to avoid littering). The national park is divided in 7 levels of water falls and its quite manageable to reach all 7 levels. I couldn't bring myself really to swim in the actual waterfalls as I  was quite bothered by the fact that fishes keep coming up to ""suck"" on your skin which is a very annoying (albeit very harmless) feeling. We stopped at each waterfall, saw some monkeys on the way back and got back to the car. We drove back the 45 mins to the hotel and drove another 30 mins to the other side of Kanchanaburi to visit the tiger temple. In the meantime I had to take a big number 2 but the insects & lack of toilet paper prohibited me from dropping it just yet (a recurring problem if you have difficulties in forgetting on a certain level of sanitary requirements). The blazing sun hit us quite hard after leaving our car (the tile surface actually radiated back a lot of heat) and we took some shadow & a cool drink before climbing the bit of stairs up to the temple (free entrance) . Inside the main building there's stairs that brings you to the 5th level where you have a stunning view on the surrounding rice fields. We got hit by a small monsoon rain and took shelter for roundabout a quarter and then went back to the car. The driver suggested we stop by a nearby café but as we were already quite tired from the heat we asked to get back to the hotel .Just a few days back scrolling Instagram reels, we actually found a reel displaying the view of the café they were going to bring us .. Darn it .. [https://www.trip.com/moments/detail/tha-muang-1447208-122953385/](https://www.trip.com/moments/detail/tha-muang-1447208-122953385/) it looks stunning (in our defense, it just rained and was still cloudy so we wouldn't have had the best view anyway). Back at the hotel, we checked how we were going to get to our next destination (Ayutthaya) and they proposed either a private transfer (2000 Bath) or shared transfer of 400 Bath pp. As we only that day in Ayutthaya we opted for the private transfer. We went back to our new room, had a quick bite at the restaurant of the hotel (we shared a cashew chicken stir-fry and had a delicious mango smoothie each, 200 Bath) and went to the pool. As it had rained recently it cooled off quite a bit and I decided to go for a quick 5k run going from the hotel to the bridge over the river Kwai and back (and some more). I always love running in a foreign country as you always soak in a lot of atmosphere while performing sports (or at least I do). We went for a nice Thai Massage (300 Bath pp, 1 hour) and went to  On’s Thai-Issan Vegan (where we saw the same German couple again for the third time! Third time's a charm but still we didn't initiate a conversation). I really recommend this restaurant (4,8 on Google). The stir-fry morninglory + tom Kha + fried rice was amazing. They don't serve alcohol but they actually redirect you to the neighbours to get your BYOB. We devoured the food, played our game even more, paid the bill and went to the neighbours for a night cap and called it a night.

 

**Day 6: Wednesday 14th of August**

 

After a quick breakfast we checked out of our hotel and our transfer brought us to our guest house in Ayutthaya (25ish EUR per night). The guest house offers free bikes. I didn't necessarily expect a carbon Specialized but the bikes were quite a challenge to ride. We had lunch near the Wat Mahathat (sweet & sour with chicken & stir fried chicken with tom yam sauce (350 Bath including 2 x Coke zero, bit on the more pricier side). After lunch we visited Wat Phra Ram (50 Bath entrance fee pp) and the temple Wihan Phra Mongkhon Bophit (no entrance fee). We then cycled back to Wat Mahathat and visited that temple as well (50 bath entrance fee pp). We already knew our time in Ayutthaya would be limited and didn't had time to book a guided tour but I would recommend one nonetheless. Visiting the old ruins without some background on the history of Thailand is for me a lost opportunity. Arriving at the Wat Mahathat one of the bikes broke down and we called our Guest House to come and pick up both bikes. We then took a tuktuk to Wat Chai Watthanaram (150 bath) where we paid a 50 Bath entrance fee pp and visited our last monument for the day. There's a nice café at the entrance where you have a nice view on the temple where we chilled a bit and read while enjoying the temple view. From there we wanted to take a tuktuk to the central station to buy our train tickets to Phitsanulok. When informing about the price they redirected us to a self-made menu card which displayed prices to various destinations but quite sure we paid a bit too much (but stil an acceptable 250 Bath as we drove 15ish mins). We were a bit too late in booking our tickets and unfortunately the special express train was already sold out so we booked the rapid train (250 Bath pp) which takes almost 6h instead of 3h15min.

We took a tuktuk from the station to the night market to grab a bite but we didn't find any nice spot to sit and have food so we wandered around to look for a nearby restaurant. Google Maps reviews showed us the way and after drinks/food & some interactions with a Japanese traveler to whom I proudly showed my Mazda car keys we took a grab to our guest house.

 

**Day 7: Thursday 15th of August**

 

After some few busy days we hoped to sleep in a bit but as the special express departing only at 9:55 AM was sold out we needed to catch our 8:38 rapid train and were instructed to be at the station approximately 45-60 mins prior to departure (as we already had the tickets looking back I don't see why you need to be there more than 15 mins prior ..). Nevertheless, we were a bit on the later side so were already stressing to be there on time. Getting a grab or a tuktuk during rush hour took us a good 10 mins and we arrived around 8:15 only to then wait until 8:38 contemplating why we stressed again to get here still 30 mins prior to departure. We boarded the train and set of for our journey which with delay took more than 6 hours. We had a connecting bus transfer to Sukhotai and were worried we were going to miss that one. My girlfriend was already in contact with the bus operator mentioning that our train is running late but we were told the bus would leave the bus station at 14:30 sharp and couldn't wait even a few minutes on us. We arrived at Phitsanulok around 14:12 and had to take a 16 min taxi drive for 11km to the bus station. Apparently just saying NO METER solves any discussion with a taxi who wanted to propose a fixed price. Arriving at the bus station, my girlfriend jumped out of the car to hold the bus while I was settling the fare and grabbing our luggage only to then realize the bus wasn't there yet and would leave only around 14:50. best part of it all, the first stop of the bus was actually another bus terminal only 2 km away from the railway station. Oh well, another day another experience. The bus brought us all the way to Sukhothai city where we still had to find a ride to the historical park where our hotel was situated nearby. Same deal again with the preprinted menu cards & prices and we took a ride for 300 bath which I thought was on the more expensive side (considering our taxi in Phitsanulok was 1/3rd for the same distance). We checked into our hotel Scent of Sukhothai Resort (40ish EUR per night). We had a quick jump in the pool, shared a large Leo for apero and got ready for dinner. Restaurant choices are limited and we went to a 4,4 starred restaurant next to 7/11 (Baitong). Spending already a few days in Thailand (and especially Kanchanaburi) we were treated already very well in the food department. Sukhothai was a bit disappointing. Dishes were all around 120/130 bath but the serving size was quite small and we both took 2 x dishes (including rice) but honestly I was still hungry after settling the bill.

We stopped on the walk to the hotel for a short beer (and playing our Cards game) and called it a night.

 

**Day 8: Friday 16th of August.**

 

The day before we tried to book a guided tour of the Sukhothai historical park. We wanted to book the late afternoon tour but there were only full day tours available. As we wanted to avoid the blazing sun we opted out of the proposal unfortunately. The day started a bit slower. We rented bikes around the corner of our hotel (50 bath pp for 24 hours) and the owner was super friendly .Made sure the tires were well pumped and even offered some elastics to avoid that my girlfriend's wide pants messed with the chain. We drove 1km to coffee shop, had a coffee and chilled a bit. Then we went to a nearby shop where they were advertising transfers to other cities and we booked a car transfer to Chiang Mai for the day after (4500 Bath). As we were running out of Thai cash we tried to find a money exchange. We went to the nearby 7/11 to ask for instructions (didn't find anything online) and I realized I left my phone in the coffee shop (it was still there fortunately). Anyway back at the 7/11 they confirmed us that there are no money exchange near the historical park and we needed to go 10km to the new city. I wanted to avoid a 20km ride so checked the ATMs outside. Between Exchange rate, bank charges, my Mastercard charges I would pay 120 EUR for the equivalent of 100 EUR, that deal was too bad to take. We actually tried to exchange some EURs with some tourists where we both could get a win (offering them a few 100s bath to avoid losing it in fees). In the end we didn't find anyone and had to take a tuktuk to the BigC supermarket 7kms out where at least we did had a very good exchange rate (nearing actual exchange rate).  We had some quick lunch and started to prepare for our visit to some temples of the historical park. As we didn't manage to get a guide we decided to each take a monument and provide a guided tour ourselves. I chose the Wat Sa Si and linked the history of the temple with the broader history of Thailand and the role of Sukhothai in the emerging country of now Thailand. We bought our entry tickets (100 bath pp + 10 bath pp for the bikes) and cycled around to all the major temples in the historical park. The difference with Ayutthaya was honestly amazing. While we saw busses offloading tourists in Ayutthaya we saw so little people during our visit of the historical park in Sukhothai and the contrast was very refreshing. We took a detour to the hotel and cycled back via the west side of the historical park to the south side to arrive at our hotel located at the east side of the historical park . We plunged in the pool again, had a beer as apero and cycled to the ""center"" for a restaurant visit. Same experience as the day before, we went to one of the top rated restaurants in the neighbourhood but we really didn't enjoy our dinner that much. A bit disappointed we decided to still try a dish at another place and we went to "" Lom&fon kitchen"". Please visit that one if you're in the neighborhood. Portions are literally double the size for the same amount (we paid 120 bath for sharing a stir fry chicken with cashews. We got some complimentary mango and after mentioning to them that we specifically came here for another dish and this was so much better than the restaurants at the big street we cycled back hotel-bound. We dropped of our bikes on the way and walked back the last 100 meters to the hotel

 

**Day 9: Saturday 17th of August**

 

We packed our bags, checked out of the hotel and took place at the backseat of our transfer. The driver was friendly, exchanged a few words and set course to Chiang Mai. A quarter into the ride the driver mentioned that she was going to take the ""Chadway"" (?) rather than the highway as she would be prone to fall asleep (euhm… okay). She drove quite reckless, a bit too fast and wasn't really keeping her lane in the turns. 2 hours in of our not-so-relaxing-ride she asked if we wanted to stop for coffee. We didn't really needed a break but she mentioned she needed some coffee to stay awake (okay again). We stopped 15 mins later, had a coffee ourselves and continued our journey again. 30 mins left to our destination the car drifted a bit to the left. I didn't bother at the time but a few mins later she pulled over at a gas station and said to us that she needed a quick nap. She then abruptly put her seat back and put her hat on her face. I took my girlfriend aside out of the car and mentioned to her that I really don't want to continue our journey with her as a driver. We booked a Grab and took our luggage out of the car. In the grab to the city center we texted the owner of the company and agreed to get the money back to pay for our grab. We arrived at the Jomkitti Boutique hotel and checked in for 3 nights (40 EUR per night). After the limited restaurant options in Sukhothai we really felt to be in the Walhallah while wandering around the streets of the old town of Chiang Mai. We grabbed lunch at a spot that had nice reviews and a lot of people inside and had my first Khao Soi. It was on the spicier side but I really loved it. After lunch we walked to some money exchanges. There are a few within the old town but rates were quite bad. In the end we walked a bit further and found a money exchange near Tha Phae Gate where rates were 7-8% better than the ones in the more center of the old town (worth the extra 5 mins walk..). We walked a bit further around and chilled a bit in the hotel (as we didn't really had such a relaxing car trip). After another plunge in the pool we went for a massage at Zenza. Traditional Thai Massage was only 100 Bath more expensive than the place in Kanchanaburi but we opted for the oil massage which was 600 Bath pp for 60 mins. A bit more expensive versus the one we did in Kachanaburi but honestly the difference really outweighed the small extra fee. You're greeted with a small foot wash, you get a cold tea and fill in a document how you want your massage, which spots you like to avoid and which spots you like to stress. The massage itself was quite good, there was some relaxing music,  and we relaxed again afterwards with a hot tea and some small biscuits.  That more end-to-end experience makes it cheaper quality-wise versus a lot of other spots I must say (and let's be real, 1 hour massage for 600 bath is still peanuts compared to prices at home). After the massage we went for dinner at ""Link Cuisine"" which turned out to be a restaurant on the more fancier side with both asian and european dishes. We paid 300ish Bath per dish for some stir fry dishes but price-quality we didn't enjoy it that much (it was a bit fancier which explains the price increase but we both agreed this is totally not what we were looking for). After dinner we had a drink at Wingman Music Bar where they had some live music. Saturday eve seems to be the night when the locals are going out as well. A lot of people seem to order a bottle of Whiskey, some water and soft drinks, and whiskey mixed with water seems a go-to drink. We finished our drink and called it a day.

 

 

**Day 10:  Sunday 18th of August**

 

After breakfast we went for some temple sightseeing across the old town. We grabbed some coffee, read a bit in our books and went to another temple outside of the old town (a bit east of Tha Phae Gate) . We started to get hungry again and went looking for some lunch. After more than a week of delicious Thai food was really craving for a grilled ham/cheese sandwich. Close to the temple we visited we found a very cute small place (Petit Jardin Café et Bistro) that served extremely delicious ""croque madame"" (ham/cheese toast with a fried egg on top). We love the Thai food but having something from home was a really nice change for a while. We were quite stuffed from the grilled cheese and went back to the hotel to chill a bit. In the evening we went to the night market (every Sunday Eve in a few streets around the Wat Chedi Lang, they have several night markets throughout the week normally). We went for a small dinner (Pad Thai, 120 bath per dish) and went to the hotel to chill a bit and watch some Netflix. 

 

**Day 11: Monday 19th of August**

 

Today we wanted to visit the Wat Phrathat Doi Suthep. We walked to a nearby scooter place and wanted to rent some scooters (250 bath per scooter for 24 hours). They wanted out passport as deposit but we're not really a fan of this. We pushed for an alternative and they accepted 3000 Bath deposit per scooter instead. I agreed to go back to the hotel and get 150 EUR instead and took the scooter to do so. After arranging the deposit we took off to the temple for the 18km drive. We followed some small roads north of the old town to avoid driving all the way via the big road. At a while we had to take the large road to go to the temple and it seems to be a very popular road for other tourists with a scooter. After a while we drove into a police control and they validated our driver licenses. I didn't have my international driver license on me and my girlfriend's one didn't seem to have the right credentials for a scooter (her driver license B covers scooters as well normally). The traffic police was actually quite friendly, mentioned that we had nothing to worry about. We were getting a 500 Bath fine, had to pay this at the nearest traffic police station and would get a permit to drive in Thailand for the next 4 days. We drove further towards the temple and stopped at the next traffic police station to settle our fine. The 7-8km drive uphill is quite nice and after the drive we parked out scooter to visit the temple (50 Bath entrance fee per person). We walked around, took some pictures of the view of the city and went back to our scooters. While driving downhill it started to rain. We took it a bit slower to avoid any dangerous situation but made it down quite easily. Back down it actually started to pour heavily and we were quite soaked from the rain. We looked to grab some lunch and found an Indian restaurant with very nice review 4,9/5 stars with 1401 reviews (Chai n Thai). We ordered a Masala Dosa (which turned out to be HUGE), some cheese naan, chicken butter masala and chicken curry. We devoured the meal but were soooo stuffed from it (I think we paid 700ish Bath in total). After lunch we want to the Wat Umong and Wat Suan Dok temples. We drove back to the hotel and went to the hotel gym for some sport (feeling a bit guilty after the what felt like 5000 calories lunch). For dinner we went to Tikky Café and I had one of the best Red curry soup ever!!! (120 bath). After dinner we stopped to buy some elephants pants for my girlfriend and went back to the hoteL.

 

**Day 12: Tuesday 20th of August** 

 

On the 20th we had a trip booked at the Chai Lai Orchid Lodge. The Elephant sanctuary works together with songthaew drivers. We were picked up at 8:15 sharp as agreed and joined the passengers that already got picked up. The ride takes about 1 hour. The first 25ish minutes are on straight roads but the last 35 mins are quite curvy going into the more hilly area east of Chiang Mai. I had a bit of a heavy stomach after the heavy Indian meal and heavy curry soup and was starting to get a little bit nauseous from the curves. Meanwhile my girlfriend was passed out sleeping in the no-window songthaew that goes left and right on the curvy roads ..  I was jealous. We arrived at the sanctuary with our bags (as we booked an overnight stay) and as the reviews on Google state, it is indeed a bit unorganized. There's 4-5 people behind the table but they don't really seem to work structured; Anyway it didn’t really bother me, we dropped our luggage at the reception desk (read, reception table) and set of for our 2-3 hour tour. We took place in a jeep, drove for 5 minutes, went down to a river side, crossed via a small bridge and went up again and set foot to the elephant feeding zone. We were a group of 10ish people and there were 4-5 elephants we could feed close by. We took some pictures, interacted a bit with the guards and prepared some small mixture that helps their digestive process (read: makes them shite). We talked with our guide who was a native Karen and was living close to the sanctuary. You can say what you want about the elephant sanctuaries and their commercial motivations, it was clear that our guide had an honest passion for the animals. Last year, a young elephant died after 4  years in the sanctuary and our guide had a tattoo of the elephant as remembrance. We set off for a small walk with the elephants and proceeded with some more feeding of a mother and her young baby. We went back to the river and were able to get into the water and help wash the elephants. After this we got back to the main area and received our lunch and ordered 2 Mango-Passion Fruit smoothie who were the best of our whole trip, wow. After lunch we got back to the reception and checked into our room (80 EUR for the night). Our room was ""Mountain view 7"" and the checkin staff already mentioned to us we have a nice room. Our room was a small cabin consisting out of 1 room with an outdoor patio/bathroom. The cabin itself had some space in between the wooden floor and it was quite warm. I enjoyed the outdoor toilet and took a quick outdoor shower and chilled a bit. Just laying there in the heat already made me sweat again so I was already ""fearing"" the night (not that good of a sleeper).  They have a happy hour from 4:30-6 PM so we went to their restaurant area (roundabout 20 meters from our cabin). They serve 1+1 on the cocktails during happy hour (only 160-180 bath per cocktail) and the cocktails were honestly very good and quite taken care of. As we were hungry again we took a chicken-mango salad to share and it was SO UNBELIEVABLY GOOD. Cocktails were good as well so we ordered another round. While chilling and viewing a nearby elephant we noticed the girl at our table next to us was starting to cry and was discussing things with the hotel staff. My girlfriend asked what was wrong and she started explaining that she looked so much forward to this trip, organized a private elephant photographing session but her room was so freaking far away. Well, turned out the other rooms of the hotel were ""river side"" which was 5 mins by car, going down to the river, crossing the river and going up again, where you had cabins which were in a more challenging state than the ones we were residing in. if she was going to take one of the three nice dresses she brought on the trip, it would take 1 hour back-and-forth and she would come back all sweaty and that made her so sad. We both didn’t really know how to support her in this challenge as we're both not really on the influencer kind of the spectrum. She left to her room around 5 PM and we didn't saw her back actually the whole evening. We changed from cocktails to beers as we were started to get a bit more warm. We played our card game for a while and ordered some food (a very yummy Massaman curry for myself and a Kueng salad for my girlfriend (no the most ideal food when drinking)). I must say, most of the times, these kind of locations where the main attraction is non-food (the elephants in this case) often don't have very qualitative food/drinks. But I was positively surprised. The cocktails, the food, prices were all very nice and again surprises me for such a destination (typically you would see higher prices and lesser quality. A few tables from where we were sitting there were 2 Spanish couples who didn't switch over to beer and kept going strong in the cocktail department. Spanish people already tend to speak a bit louder but throughout the late afternoon/evening we gradually heard the volume rising along with the alcohol percentage in the blood. One of the men was called Ramon apparently and every now and then we heard RAMON, which after some rounds was turning into RAMONNNNN. If my Spanish was better I would have joined them. Meanwhile after we finished our food there was a NYC couple who was eating at the table behind us. I saw they brought their own kind-of wine bottle and made a small remark like ""nice, you brought some wine"". We shared some pleasantries and they asked if we wanted to try some of the rice wine they bought during their trip to Thailand. Needless to say we said yes and we were offered 2 BIG glasses of rice wine (oh boy). We chatted some more, about my time in NYC, their previous trips, our both trips in Thailand, … and the rooms. Turned out they had a room at the river side and the more and more they were thinking about their room the more and more they were dreading to go to their room. At  9 PM the restaurant of the hotel closed off. We bought a last round of beers to consume in the room, said bye to the NYC couple who was discussing with hotel staff that they want to check out now and get a transfer to Chiang Mai, and said buenes noches to Ramon and not-Ramon who were ordering a bottle of gin to take back to their room (which also was river side). Our now-in-our-mind-upgraded luxourious palace Mountain view 7 was only 20 meters away.

In the quiet of each night, as our messages filled the darkness, I fell into a universe that was just... you. Those ""secret songs"" you shared became our language - every melody a piece of your soul I was lucky enough to hold.

I lived for your stories, the way you'd paint your day in words. Your mind - so deep, so far beyond your years - it leaves me in awe and terror all at once. You think in shades and depths that make me question everything I believed about age and understanding.

That first time you wrote my name... just pixels on a screen, but my heart knew before my mind did. I traced those letters until they burned, until my own name became something sacred in your typing.

Loving you, even from this distance, is like holding a butterfly. The tighter I want to hold on, the more I know I have to let go. Your young, pure heart sees such beauty in everything - it's not mine to complicate. Though your thoughts dance with wisdom beyond time, your soul needs to bloom in its own season.

At night, I catch myself humming your songs, each note a memory of you sharing your day. These melodies are now both my comfort and my torture. I miss being your safe harbor, the keeper of your racing thoughts.

Walking away broke me. Staying would have been easier - pretending time didn't matter, basking in your light. But you deserve to shine without shadows, to bloom without the weight of years between us.

I carry you like a whispered prayer, like a song I'll never hear again. Maybe someday, in some coffee shop, one of our songs will play, and my heart will remember what it means to love someone enough to let them go.

Until then, I hope you're out there sharing your songs, telling your stories, making someone else believe in magic. Stay beautifully, breathtakingly you.

It’s a cozy 3BHK setup where the owner sublets the other two rooms. One room is mine, the second belongs to the owner (though she’s away on a trip), and the third was temporarily vacant.

Last night, something surreal happened. A girl booked the vacant room as a temporary stopover. She was traveling from the US, on her route to visiting her family in Andhra Pradesh. So she stayed booked this place for 2 days to visit her friends here in Bangalore.

It was Friday night, and I’d just returned from work, was in my room, locked from the inside. Around 10 PM, I heard someone walk in, unaware I was home too. Moments later, I heard crying—loud, heart-wrenching sobs. For a second, it felt like the walls of this silent apartment were the safe space for her to vent it out, assuming no one was home.

Confused and a little alarmed, I stepped out of my room.The other two rooms were locked, yet the crying continued. Unsure of what to do, I turned on the TV in the living room, flipping to Hanuman Chalisa chants, hoping to fill the air with something comforting. That’s when she realized she wasn’t alone.

I was confused and startled, I stepped out to find the source of the sound. Both the other rooms were locked, yet the crying persisted. I got panicked; I turned on the TV in the living room, flipping to Hanuman Chalisa chants for some sense of Positivity. It was then she realized she wasn’t alone. She stepped out, visibly shaken, and introduced herself. She stepped out, startled, her face flushed with the kind of embarrassment, through her tears, she introduced herself.

 

I gently said*, “Listen, I know you’ve had a bad day. I don’t know what you’re going through, but everything will be alright.”* Her cheeks flushed with embarrassment as she asked softly*, “Was I too loud?”*

 

*“No worries,”* I smiled. *“Life happens to the best of us. We all go through it, and it’s okay.”*

 

Something in that moment shifted. The awkwardness melted, replaced by assurance. She asked if she could join me in the living room to watch the TV, and I said yes. We started watching TV, sharing cold coffee and our life stories, career, and shared a great laughter. I made sure she had a good time while we are chatting, kept her engaged, She opened up about her work in South Carolina and Chicago, her in-between phase of life, and the weight she was carrying.

I shared my own story—the heartbreak from years ago that left me guarded, the journey of trying to rebuild myself, and how even the toughest phases in life eventually pass. I wanted her to know that she wasn’t alone, that this was just a moment, not the whole story. Just to keep her assured the worst is not the worst, it's just a phase of life and ""this too shall pass"". There was a simplicity to our conversation—raw, unfiltered, and honest. She smiled often, and I found myself laughing too, something I hadn’t done in a long while.

At one point, while searching for Friends episodes on YouTube, a mantra played in the background (which the owner had saved on youtube). She suddenly remarked, *“Pata hai na main Muslim hoon”* (You know I’m a muslim, right?) "", I responded, ""mujhe to pta hai but TV koi nahi and youtube doesn’t discriminate like our politicians"". (I know, but TV doesn’t and don’t discriminate like our politicians)

She burst into laughter, and in that moment, it felt like all the heaviness she’d carried into the room had lifted. We talked about everything—her jet lag, her insomnia, and even joked like we’d known each other for years. She shared chocolates she’d brought, and we teased each other over little things, letting the night slip away unnoticed.

Before we knew it, it was dawn. She got up to leave and turned to me with a smile. *“This was really nice,” she said. “I was just going to watch some videos and sleep, but this was much better—though I’m still embarrassed about the start.”* I added*, ""they way you were crying, I don't think you were going to watch videos"".*

She laughed and said*, “Good luck with…”*

 

*“Life,”* I finished for her sentence.

 

She corrected me, *“I was going to say your US trip—but haan, good luck with life too.”*

That was it. She went to her room, and I went to mine. I stayed awake, replaying the night in my mind—the laughter, her stories, and the way her presence had filled the room with something I hadn’t felt in a long time.

By 8 AM, she was gone. She left the key with the guard, assuming I was asleep. But I wasn’t. I waited, hoping she’d return to pick up her things, but she didn’t.

And just like that, she was gone. No numbers exchanged, no way to find her. I tried looking her up online, but it was futile—a needle in a haystack.

It’s strange. In those few hours, something shifted in me. I’ve been through heartbreak after a 5 years of relationship and spent years building walls around myself, hiding my emotions. But in those 6-7 hours, something shifted. I felt like me again. She was her. Two strangers, from entirely different worlds, sharing a spark in a living room in Bangalore.

I don’t know if she felt the same, or if this night will linger in her memory the way it does in mine. But as I sit here, her face, her eyes, and that radiant smile refuse to leave my mind.

Sometimes, life gives us these rare, serendipitous moments—brief yet profound. They remind us of the beauty in human connection, no matter how fleeting.

I wish her the best in life, wherever she is. And though we may never meet again, I’ll always hold onto this memory. A night filled with smiles, laughter, and hope. A night where, for the first time in years, I felt alive.

I am happy I was there for her and change her sad day to something better. Although I feel sad as she is gone and there is no way will be able to get in touch with her, but I really wish I could be there for her forever to make sure that radiant smile on her face is alive forever.

Absolutely zero friends, disowned by family (long story)

I used to have a life full of family & friends during university years, but since then it has all vanished. People are too busy for me, have moved on & started families, live in different countries or areas. I tried to meet up with old friends for years before giving up- they were always busy with work or their new family / kids. 

I go through the day everyday with no one to even go for coffee with. 

If I didn’t have my partner (who barely talks to me) I’d have no one on this earth. I’m self employed with no colleagues, work from home. 

This is not healthy & it hurt

I’ve tried everything I can to fix this problem but this is my experience:

In 40s if u are male & average looking & don’t have ur own family or circle of friends, if starting from scratch u are basically shunned by people. It’s debilitating. 

Im very good socially, always have been, but noticed a huge shift in how people befriend each other in modern times- compared to 20 years ago ppl are more superficial nowadays and if ur starting from scratch u need to be very good looking or charming or muscular for anyone to even want to befriend you from nothing.

I’ve tried talking to strangers- no one is interested in me at all, even for a coffee.

When I was wealthy (lost it all now- long story), everyone wanted to befriend me. Before social media, it was 1000% easier as people were more interested in befriending each other including average men. 

I go to the gym, take care of myself, eat healthy, I have a job. Just no one is interested. I tried befriending my housemates but they refuse to even talk to each other & are equally uninterested in going for coffee with me no matter how often I ask. 

People tell me I’m really nice & good socially - I make people laugh, know how to respond to things…  

Given that nothing else worked I recently tried changing tack & started telling people I have no friends- they express surprise when I say I have no friends - but still tell me they’re too busy for coffee 😂🤣 so one wonders why it is that they express surprise in the first place ! I’m not blaming them - it is just that people are too busy nowadays so those starting from scratch have no “in”.  

When I focus on my income & physique, get lean and muscular, suddenly people pay me attention but the only ones willing to meet up for friendship are those who secretly want something more & end up cutting off contact as soon as they get into a relationship with someone else. No one wants genuine friendship anymore. 

I have come to realise ur supposed to have a family by my age (midlife although I look younger) otherwise ur shunned by society. You’re supposed to be busy with kids or family, and if you have none ur life can so easily be empty. It’s horrid. No one told me this growing up. 

Can’t have kids with my partner either. For various reasons I can’t go into. 

I tried asking my clients for coffee but they’re busy & only agree to come if they think they can get something out of it like a discount… otherwise the answer is just no…

It sucks 

Also, scouring this sub I’ve noticed a huge number of people in similar positions who are almost ALL the same demographic as me - men. Something hugely wrong that isn’t bloody being addressed in modern society as this literally never used to be an issue ",1,1733073211.0,lonely,0,1.0,False

A few weeks ago I posted my first setup (in the second pic), which I’d used for a year and decided it was time to graduate from.
Here’s the upgrades I’ve made so far, based on your input:
* Upgraded my beans!!
    * Onyx from local Whole Foods Market pictured. B&W in the mail
    * Also tried a local roaster who had beans at Whole Foods with a marked roast date.
* Added a Timemore Chestnut C3 Max Pro from Amazon
* Started using a basic food scale that I already had
    * Only measures to 1.0g and 1.0ml level of precision
* Switched from the Chemex to a Hario V60 glass dripper (nobody really pushed for this change but I really like it!)
* Added a Hario v60 600ml server (which I forgot to put in the picture) for when I make coffee for two, which is about half of the time.
* Started working on my first actual recipe.
Current recipe with this gear (I double this for 2 people):
* 16gr of coffee : 330ml filtered (refrigerator filter) tap water
* 17 clicks on the grinder
* 200ºF on the water (this is my wildcard. Basically I boil the water then let it sit a minute before I pour, hoping it's somewhere between 200ºF and 210ºF.
Probably the next upgrades I'll make is a better scale and a kettle with a thermometer (maybe electric or maybe still stovetop)

It’s a cozy 3BHK setup where the owner sublets the other two rooms. One room is mine, the second belongs to the owner (though she’s away on a trip), and the third was temporarily vacant.

Last night, something surreal happened. A girl booked the vacant room as a temporary stopover. She was traveling from the US, on her route to visiting her family in Andhra Pradesh. So she stayed booked this place for 2 days to visit her friends here in Bangalore.

It was Friday night, and I’d just returned from work, was in my room, locked from the inside. Around 10 PM, I heard someone walk in, unaware I was home too. Moments later, I heard crying—loud, heart-wrenching sobs. For a second, it felt like the walls of this silent apartment were the safe space for her to vent it out, assuming no one was home.

Confused and a little alarmed, I stepped out of my room.The other two rooms were locked, yet the crying continued. Unsure of what to do, I turned on the TV in the living room, flipping to Hanuman Chalisa chants, hoping to fill the air with something comforting. That’s when she realized she wasn’t alone.

I was confused and startled, I stepped out to find the source of the sound. Both the other rooms were locked, yet the crying persisted. I got panicked; I turned on the TV in the living room, flipping to Hanuman Chalisa chants for some sense of Positivity. It was then she realized she wasn’t alone. She stepped out, visibly shaken, and introduced herself. She stepped out, startled, her face flushed with the kind of embarrassment, through her tears, she introduced herself.

 

I gently said*, “Listen, I know you’ve had a bad day. I don’t know what you’re going through, but everything will be alright.”* Her cheeks flushed with embarrassment as she asked softly*, “Was I too loud?”*

 

*“No worries,”* I smiled. *“Life happens to the best of us. We all go through it, and it’s okay.”*

 

Something in that moment shifted. The awkwardness melted, replaced by assurance. She asked if she could join me in the living room to watch the TV, and I said yes. We started watching TV, sharing cold coffee and our life stories, career, and shared a great laughter. I made sure she had a good time while we are chatting, kept her engaged, She opened up about her work in South Carolina and Chicago, her in-between phase of life, and the weight she was carrying.

I shared my own story—the heartbreak from years ago that left me guarded, the journey of trying to rebuild myself, and how even the toughest phases in life eventually pass. I wanted her to know that she wasn’t alone, that this was just a moment, not the whole story. Just to keep her assured the worst is not the worst, it's just a phase of life and ""this too shall pass"". There was a simplicity to our conversation—raw, unfiltered, and honest. She smiled often, and I found myself laughing too, something I hadn’t done in a long while.

At one point, while searching for Friends episodes on YouTube, a mantra played in the background (which the owner had saved on youtube). She suddenly remarked, *“Pata hai na main Muslim hoon”* (You know I’m a muslim, right?) "", I responded, ""mujhe to pta hai but TV koi nahi and youtube doesn’t discriminate like our politicians"". (I know, but TV doesn’t and don’t discriminate like our politicians)

She burst into laughter, and in that moment, it felt like all the heaviness she’d carried into the room had lifted. We talked about everything—her jet lag, her insomnia, and even joked like we’d known each other for years. She shared chocolates she’d brought, and we teased each other over little things, letting the night slip away unnoticed.

Before we knew it, it was dawn. She got up to leave and turned to me with a smile. *“This was really nice,” she said. “I was just going to watch some videos and sleep, but this was much better—though I’m still embarrassed about the start.”* I added*, ""they way you were crying, I don't think you were going to watch videos"".*

She laughed and said*, “Good luck with…”*

 

*“Life,”* I finished for her sentence.

 

She corrected me, *“I was going to say your US trip—but haan, good luck with life too.”*

That was it. She went to her room, and I went to mine. I stayed awake, replaying the night in my mind—the laughter, her stories, and the way her presence had filled the room with something I hadn’t felt in a long time.

By 8 AM, she was gone. She left the key with the guard, assuming I was asleep. But I wasn’t. I waited, hoping she’d return to pick up her things, but she didn’t.

And just like that, she was gone. No numbers exchanged, no way to find her. I tried looking her up online, but it was futile—a needle in a haystack.

It’s strange. In those few hours, something shifted in me. I’ve been through heartbreak after a 5 years of relationship and spent years building walls around myself, hiding my emotions. But in those 6-7 hours, something shifted. I felt like me again. She was her. Two strangers, from entirely different worlds, sharing a spark in a living room in Bangalore.

I don’t know if she felt the same, or if this night will linger in her memory the way it does in mine. But as I sit here, her face, her eyes, and that radiant smile refuse to leave my mind.

Sometimes, life gives us these rare, serendipitous moments—brief yet profound. They remind us of the beauty in human connection, no matter how fleeting.

I wish her the best in life, wherever she is. And though we may never meet again, I’ll always hold onto this memory. A night filled with smiles, laughter, and hope. A night where, for the first time in years, I felt alive.

I am happy I was there for her and change her sad day to something better. Although I feel sad as she is gone and there is no way will be able to get in touch with her, but I really wish I could be there for her forever to make sure that radiant smile on her face is alive forever.

If you are reading this (very limited chance). Wish you goodluck stranger, I hope you shine brighter than the North Star, And don’t forget to travel other places too, airport halts don’t counts. And between me and you, I have kept the Pooky with me.",9,1733072738.0,ZyadaKuchNai,3,0.85,False

I received one b12 shot last year from the pharmacy. I was taking prairie naturals b vitamins for 8 months previous. The injection fixed a whole host of problems for me. My nerves in back stopped firing off like it had been for 4 years before. My rocescea went away. I had orecancer of the vulva for 3 years that kept spreading and coming back. The symptoms I had for that were extreme itch and it stopped in its tracks. Months later when I went to have the surgery they did a multitude of biopsys and it was just gone. My allergies stopped in their tracks. 

That's the good. But the bad it my heart started beating out of my chest. I ended up for months with 13 extra beats in my heart per minute. My vision went funny. I suddenly had extreme vertigo and couldn't get up or lay down with out the room spinning. That lasted for a few weeks. I couldn't drink coffee. Or tea. Any caffeine. It made me feel like I would faint. My spine inflamed at the base of the neck and the neck. I couldn't keep my temperature up. I was feeling like I was in shock. My nerves were trembling. It was like a internal tremor. My arms and legs would get pins and needles. I can't remember all the other symptoms I had as that was last year. I received the injection in the end of Nov. Felt amazing for two days then boom! I wasn't able to barley leave my house except for the ambulance rides I went for. I was dismissed by many doctors even though any time they felt my pulse kinda freaked out. Anytime I would take any kind of supplement my neck spine would inflame. I started going to a chivro. 

Eventually after my own research as no doctor could help me I decided it was b6 toxicity possibly from the supplements I took before. And that the B12 activated all the b6 in my body. I started eating low b6 meals. 

In May half my chest went numb and face. The doctor told me it was from stress. Love how everything including all that is stress right?!? 

I happen to get ina. Few days later for a MRI to rule out Ms. I was booked for a year and happened to get in by fluke. Turns out that month I had a stroke. ( Def when half my body went numb and they told me it was stress). He said it was with in the month.  Slowly all my symptoms subsided. 

A little previous info. I was a vegetarian for ten years prior. Docs kept telling me my B12 at 270 was fine. I was like there's no way after ten. Years and not really supplementing my B12 is ""fine"". So I started eating meat again 6 months prior to the Nov injection. My cholesterol went from smoking perfect for the past ten years to by the time I had the stroke 8 months later it was flagged as high. In Nov when I received the shot it had gone up quite a bit too. ( Could see it kinda like a graph). I only ate hamburger on my salad. And steaks with my meals. No processed or fast food. 

I immediately went back to vegetarian diet after the stroke.

So I've done all these thoughts on what it could be. Maybe the chivro. I def stopped going to see him when I had the stroke. B6 toxicity? But here's the thing. Injection and after all that meat my B12 barley went up.  I was sitting at 280. Then it dipped back down. To 270.  

In July I started to feel symptoms of deficiency again. I thought maybe it was my iron. I went on a trip and started eating fish and was able to handle taking an iron supplement. I started feeling better. Bruising stopped. I had more energy. I got home and got blood work done and my ferritan tanked from 46 to 28. But my B12 was up 10 points! So by this time I KNOW I have B12 deficiancy. So I kept on a pescatarian diet.  Fast forward to now. I have tried all types of B12 and folate. Hydro. Adeno. Folinic acid. I cut out all supplemented foods from the year before. 

I was able to get rid of the extra beats over time then any time I tried even a small amount of supplements they would come back. 

This weekend I tried methyl B12. Like your supposed to take a whoke dropper full and I literally took only a few drops. And my extra beats are back full force. Been 2 weeks. And my neck is sore again. It scares me as I'm terrified for another stroke. They have no idea why I had one. But I know it's from all this. As the symptoms inflame anytime I take it. But if I don't my symptoms of deficiency start to come back. Including the cancer itch. Oh and my anxiety has improved a lot! Like a light switch when I got that shot. It was crazy!! 

I find this crazy. I can't eat meat or my cholesterol will go through the roof. I can't supplement. I have deficiancy I know this for a fact.  But I can't eat fish every day. 

So ..... I have no doctors that want to help me. So far it's just been me figuring stuff out. Like I can fix my pre cancer but I can't take supplements cuz it'll kill me.  Sounds dramatic. But it's really not. I spent a large portion of the year thinking I was going to die. I'm ok now. But stuck. I have a artery calcium score of 0. So it wasn't a plaque build of in my arteries. 

So any idea of what's going on would be appricated. I then can maybe try and figure this out. I live in Canada. So anyone who knows someone that specializes in this would be great too. I have been to natural paths when all this was happening and they wanted me to take more supplements. I was like no.  As I reacted to all supplements. ",1,1733072633.0,b12deficiency,1,1.0,False

1h47rqe,https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/1h47rqe/easter_sunday/,Easter Sunday,"As I sit and write this, I think of children and their craving for more experience. They wish, as I once did, to advance time beyond themselves. For myself, it was those dinner table exclusions that would pass eye-to-eye between parents over the top of wine glasses. They were almost jokes at my expense - I would 'get it when I was older'. Oh, how I wished and wished to be older. I begged to not be treated like, for God's sake, a baby. I wanted to be a grown up but the concept was so abstract to me at that age, so foreign, that I thought it meant a dream house like the ones I'd drawn on wax paper with crayons; a smoking chimney, a strip of acid-green grass and blue sky all for myself. Something of my very own.

I strained to carve out those fragments of imagined maturity for myself, back when I thought maturity could only bring me good things and freedom.

It was Easter Sunday fourteen years ago. My parents weren't rich but we were well-off enough to afford an in-country getaway during school holidays. We often spent time at the Ponteville Caravan Park, too far from the lakes to be described as in the Lake District but still tucked neatly away from it all in the countryside. Thirty or so yellow painted caravans in a spiral formation around a log-cabin clubhouse referred to as The Den. The site was only accessible via a dirt road and was enclosed on all sides by farmland and patches of forest.

Those vans were well-kept but always had that blue-ish taxi smell of cigarettes leaking through air freshener. They hadn't been re-decorated since the seventies and if the weather strayed outside the realm of mild the TV would static and fuzz. This was only an issue to my brother, already mature, a cool-ish 13-year-old. He felt worlds away, only my brother by blood. He was embarrassed by me and I'm sure he dreaded these caravan reprieves as much as I loved them.

You see, far from being upset by a dodgy TV, I had my own little cohort of holiday friends that I would busy myself with. Other kids who would habitually come to Ponteville over school breaks. Our get-togethers being brief made them all the more special, particularly over Easter, when we would all join forces to complete an egg-hunt arranged by the site managers, a lovely old couple who kept cats. They would hide these plastic egg-capsules - the type you crack open to reveal chocolate - around the site and parts of the woods every year for the seven-or-so kids who were regulars. Well, six by that time, I guess, since my brother was all grown up.

Easter was tomorrow, but I looked out the window of the room I shared with my brother and felt the disappointment already setting in. It had been raining the previous few days, badly, and was still coming down in grey sheets just a few inches from my face. The type of rain I now know sweeps students off the streets and into the library. I'll always now associate that rain with mouldy air conditioning and a stale book smell. Deodorant spiked through with sweat and the clacking of keys hurrying to finish a paper. Back then, the rain only meant ensuing boredom.

Still, Easter morning, and although it was cloudy, blue-tinged, the rain seemed to have cleared up. Now all we had to worry about were those marshed patches that could sink and stick wellington boots. We were all given warnings not to climb over fences into farmland, and with our over-sized wicker baskets, we were off to hunt eggs.

Sweat sticking down fringes, rosy cheeked and insulated by raincoats, our parents glanced out at us periodically from the windows of The Den where they had congregated for coffee, as every so often one of us would shriek and run past. Eventually we had swept the whole site from top to bottom and found what I now assume was all of the eggs, shining jewel-like in our baskets, those cheap things. At the far end of the site, the furthest part of fence away from that dirt road and The Den, was a gap of wooden fence we all leaned on to peer at the disused barn on the other side, only about fifty metres away. Even at that age I knew about disused. Old, broken, nobody there. I don't remember who it was that suggested we check the place for eggs, but we were all so giggly and flushed that even the crybabies amongst us, pedants before knowing the meaning of pedantic, hopped the fence. We didn't have to use the door as there was a sizeable hole in the wooden exterior of the barn that we all crouched through. It was dry inside, and inside, slumped on a wall, we saw the Easter Bunny.

It sat still and watched us, not giving any clues, but we felt sure it meant there were eggs nearby. We went methodically through the barn. It was empty, but that didn’t stop us sifting through rotting piles of hay. Really, its lucky none of us got tetanus - anything could have been hidden in there. Anything apart from eggs - I don't remember what the others said or did, but I remember feeling easily accepting of the fact that the Easter Bunny hadn't tricked us, nothing like that! I thought it might have been sitting against the barn wall watching the hunt from afar!

We said our goodbyes to it and although it didn’t reply (I do remember one of the other little boys at this point reminding us that rabbits couldn’t speak English), I thought I saw its ears twitch in recognition. We headed back to The Den with such a tall tale, though we didn't say where exactly we had met the Easter Bunny - after all, we knew we weren't supposed to be in that barn. Of course, we went back the next day, our little procession, but by then it had left, with only the blackened imprint on the dirt barn floor of where it had been sitting to prove it was ever there.

I always looked back on that memory so fondly. Some piece of magic that was for me and only me. Something, for once, that adults didn't understand. Mine.

I'm not quite sure what to say next. Every time I think of it now my mouth goes dry. I'm twenty years old, of quite a nervous disposition, but this makes me go even paler, clutch even harder and more fleetingly at my hands whenever a new piece of the puzzle resurfaces and comes into form.

It's not a perfectly clear memory, not even a silhouette, but shards of it replay themselves for me sometimes and I still can’t quite believe we didn't notice the track marks, or the fact she was only in lingerie.

I remember the way she was crooked against the barn wall and the pale tinge of scar tissue and the plastic carrier bag over her face - her head had been shoved through a tear in the bottom of the bag, and it was secured with a cord at her neck. Atop her head, the handles, knotted, stood stiff and straight up. They had looked like rabbit ears.

My maturity. In my maturity I realise that her spiriting away the following morning had less to do with the stroke of midnight on a holiday and probably more to do with a group of people, a van, strong hands to break the rigor-mortis. Oh yes, she was probably dead. She might not have been when we found her. Perhaps she was comatose, listening to our sickening inflections. ""Goodbye Bunny!"" I had said. For God's sake.

I truly have something of my very own, something I haven't told a soul. That we might have been able to do something if we weren’t dopey middle-class kids. I haven't seen any of my caravan friends for many years, but I wonder if they have warped it over so many times in their heads, as I have. An abscess with constant pressure. I would trade that coloured-crayon house in my sketchbook to be able to go back and give myself that sliver of maturity that might have helped her.

Or maybe I wouldn't. Maybe I would wish to take it all back. I would be Peter Pan and keep that childhood memory soft-tinged. I wish to still tell people that I met the Easter Bunny.

I started my job at my dream company so basically there were alot of people in my team but i automatically bonded with this guy who had joined one week before me.We would take coffee breaks together , have lunch together , sit somewhere together and talk about life sometimes (you know getting to know each other) then we became really good friends he would show me pictures of his friends and family , sit next to me , we'd make plans to go out etc etc and I don't really remember much on how we became best friends in eight months but yeah ..

So the last two months it was just flirting/teasing each other , sometimes holding hands and us confessing we had a crush on each other.But whatever happened work or no work we were always together.

It was going fine until he started acting weird.Now he wouldn't even talk to me , i have stopped sitting at the same table as him because when i tried to do that while trying to understand what was going on he would just get up and sit somewhere else , we're just not the same anymore and I'm having a hard time accepting that.I have tried asking him , apologized incase i crossed any boundaries but he just replied with ""please bear with me"".Now i just see him being all friendly and like that with another female teammate and it just hurts sometimes because that used to be our thing.

I still don't understand what's going on and it just confuses me alot and i miss our bond.

WATCH NFL LIVE STREAM

With the advent of Atalantanet streaming, it’s made cable a pretty outdated service. Unfortunately, there isn’t really a good place to watch sports online. I’ve tried purchasing a streaming service that gives you access to NFL games, but I was also paying for a bunch of channels I never even watched. Talk about a waste of money!



But what if I told you I found a place to watch an NFL live game without cable?



Awesome, right? 



I found this awesome place that streams all NFL games online for free. And I didn’t even have to sign up!



If you’ve tried to watch NFL games online before, you probably know that the NFL has some pretty strict streaming regulations. They typically want people to watch on TV. But right when I was about to give up and accept their demands, I found this great streaming service. 



It bypasses paywalls put in place by cable companies and streaming services and lets me watch games that aren’t even in my region. It’s practically heaven on Earth!



But let’s delve a bit deeper into that, shall we?



I have access to every NFL game everywhere



Did you know that streaming services like Sling and Hulu don’t give you access to all the available games? Crazy right? 



Well, this service lets me watch over 270+\* games a season. I can watch every NFL live game without needing a cable subscription or streaming service. I have the entire roster of games at my fingertips and I didn’t even need to leave my house. Talk about game-changing.



One of the most frustrating parts about game day is that I have to stay home the entire time. If I want to do something, I have to miss out on an important play. But now, I can watch the game everywhere and on any device, including Android, Apple, or Google devices. Did I get to sit down at a coffee shop and watch my favorite games, all without missing a thing?



I can even watch from my PlayStation. I just have to turn it on and voila! And none of this requires doing anything sketchy to your devices like jailbreaking them or the like. 



Freedom of choice is the name of the game so I’m getting the best streaming experience entirely for free and without risking the safety of my devices.



I get to decide which games I watch, not my streaming service or the NFL. And this is all, completely free. 



Which channels do I have access to?



You’d think I’d have to compromise on the channels I have access to, but that just isn’t the case! I can watch games that are televised on ESPN, the NFL Network, NFL RedZone FOX, TSN, NESN, CBC, SNW, MSG a and NBC. Even if I want to see a regional game that isn’t on one of the channels, I can see that, too!



But what about the video quality?



It doesn’t do you any good to have access to all these games if you can’t see anything, right?



Well, the good news is that the picture quality is awesome! If your Atalantanet can handle it, anyway. But don’t worry, there are options to lower the video quality a little bit to improve streaming speeds. I’ve had to do this a couple times when the wifi was spotty and didn’t have any trouble with buffering. I could watch the whole game without worrying about not being able to see the most important parts!



After all, what’s the point of watching the game if half of your time is spent waiting for things to load? I might as well be staring at a blank wall! It certainly feels like I am when everything’s buffering all the time.



In the end,



I finally don’t have to put up with streaming services or the NFL telling me how to watch my games. This has completely revolutionized how I watch football on Sunday. I get the best game day experience and I didn’t have to sacrifice an excessive amount of money or my safety!



This service offers the unbeatable game day experience by putting the power back in my hands. Which games I watch shouldn’t be decided by the NFL or my streaming service. I’ve taken back the reins and have control over what I watch. 



And if you use this service, you can too.

so am i being paranoid as usual or should this be considered a red sign?

It’s a cozy 3BHK setup where the owner sublets the other two rooms. One room is mine, the second belongs to the owner (though she’s away on a trip), and the third was temporarily vacant.

Last night, something surreal happened. A girl booked the vacant room as a temporary stopover. She was traveling from the US, on her route to visiting her family in Andhra Pradesh or maybe Hyderabad. So she stayed booked this place for 2 days to visit her friends here in Bangalore.

It was Friday night, and I’d just returned from work, was in my room, locked from the inside. Around 10 PM, I heard someone walk in, unaware I was home too. Moments later, I heard crying—loud, heart-wrenching sobs. For a second, it felt like the walls of this silent apartment were the safe space for her to vent it out, assuming no one was home.

Confused and a little alarmed, I stepped out of my room.The other two rooms were locked, yet the crying continued. Unsure of what to do, I turned on the TV in the living room, flipping to Hanuman Chalisa chants, hoping to fill the air with something comforting. That’s when she realized she wasn’t alone.

I was confused and startled, I stepped out to find the source of the sound. Both the other rooms were locked, yet the crying persisted. I got panicked; I turned on the TV in the living room, flipping to Hanuman Chalisa chants for some sense of Positivity. It was then she realized she wasn’t alone. She stepped out, visibly shaken, and introduced herself. She stepped out, startled, her face flushed with the kind of embarrassment, through her tears, she introduced herself.

 

I gently said*, “Listen, I know you’ve had a bad day. I don’t know what you’re going through, but everything will be alright.”* Her cheeks flushed with embarrassment as she asked softly*, “Was I too loud?”*

 

*“No worries,”* I smiled. *“Life happens to the best of us. We all go through it, and it’s okay.”*

 

Something in that moment shifted. The awkwardness melted, replaced by assurance. She asked if she could join me in the living room to watch the TV, and I said yes. We started watching TV, sharing cold coffee and our life stories, career, and shared a great laughter. I made sure she had a good time while we are chatting, kept her engaged, She opened up about her work in South Carolina and Chicago, her in-between phase of life, and the weight she was carrying.

I shared my own story—the heartbreak from years ago that left me guarded, the journey of trying to rebuild myself, and how even the toughest phases in life eventually pass. I wanted her to know that she wasn’t alone, that this was just a moment, not the whole story. Just to keep her assured the worst is not the worst, it's just a phase of life and ""this too shall pass"". There was a simplicity to our conversation—raw, unfiltered, and honest. She smiled often, and I found myself laughing too, something I hadn’t done in a long while.

At one point, while searching for Friends episodes on YouTube, a mantra played in the background (which the owner had saved on youtube). She suddenly remarked, *“Pata hai na main Muslim hoon”* (You know I’m a muslim, right?) "", I responded, ""mujhe to pta hai but TV koi nahi and youtube doesn’t discriminate like our politicians"". (I know, but TV doesn’t and don’t discriminate like our politicians)

She burst into laughter, and in that moment, it felt like all the heaviness she’d carried into the room had lifted. We talked about everything—her jet lag, her insomnia, and even joked like we’d known each other for years. She shared chocolates she’d brought, and we teased each other over little things, letting the night slip away unnoticed.

Before we knew it, it was dawn. She got up to leave and turned to me with a smile. *“This was really nice,” she said. “I was just going to watch some videos and sleep, but this was much better—though I’m still embarrassed about the start.”* I added*, ""they way you were crying, I don't think you were going to watch videos"".*

She laughed and said*, “Good luck with…”*

 

*“Life,”* I finished for her sentence.

 

She corrected me, *“I was going to say your US trip—but haan, good luck with life too.”*

That was it. She went to her room, and I went to mine. I stayed awake, replaying the night in my mind—the laughter, her stories, and the way her presence had filled the room with something I hadn’t felt in a long time.

By 8 AM, she was gone. She left the key with the guard, assuming I was asleep. But I wasn’t. I waited, hoping she’d return to pick up her things, but she didn’t.

And just like that, she was gone. No numbers exchanged, no way to find her. I tried looking her up online, but it was futile—a needle in a haystack.

It’s strange. In those few hours, something shifted in me. I’ve been through heartbreak after a 5 years of relationship and spent years building walls around myself, hiding my emotions. But in those 6-7 hours, something shifted. I felt like me again. She was her. Two strangers, from entirely different worlds, sharing a spark in a living room in Bangalore.

I don’t know if she felt the same, or if this night will linger in her memory the way it does in mine. But as I sit here, her face, her eyes, and that radiant smile refuse to leave my mind.

Sometimes, life gives us these rare, serendipitous moments—brief yet profound. They remind us of the beauty in human connection, no matter how fleeting.

I wish her the best in life, wherever she is. And though we may never meet again, I’ll always hold onto this memory. A night filled with smiles, laughter, and hope. A night where, for the first time in years, I felt alive.

I am happy I was there for her and change her sad day to something better. Although I feel sad as she is gone and there is no way will be able to get in touch with her, but I really wish I could be there for her forever to make sure that radiant smile on her face is alive forever.

1h47ffc,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1h47ffc,Fire up the Time Machine! I'm going back to the 1970s! Dittos-Inspired Skintight Saddleback Pants,"I made... Dittos-Inspired Skintight Pants! 

I started here:  'BIG PANTS Dittos' https://www.reddit.com/r/sewing/s/8TnbnEmOMa

I went here: 'Casual Fit Dittos' https://www.reddit.com/r/sewing/s/K4Kgi3GWtJ

I have four Saddleback pants total in HUGE, Casual, Skintight... what's happening?

Warning: Long Post Coming

- Chapter One: Creation Process
- Chapter Two: Here We Go... or Maybe Not
- Chapter Three: Trust

**CHAPTER ONE: CREATION PROCESS**

After finishing my 'BIG PANTS Dittos' and then my 'Casual Fit Dittos', I wanted to see if... 1) I could make 'Skintight Dittos' and 2) If I would even like them. And 3) I decided I would challenge myself and make them 100% woven no-stretch, no plastic elastic stretchy thread anywhere.

So... my thinking process was thus:

- Go skinny jeans and slice and dice a saddleback?
- Set the saddleback on a bias.... plaid... stripes... contrast... curve bias...
- Grade down my 'Casual Fit Dittos' pattern?
- And then, it occurred to me. I **ALREADY OWN** this pattern.

YEARS ago, I got fascinated by Matadors and their styling. I eventually made a Costume Matador 3-piece outfit as well as a Matador hat. Still have it. Still occasionally wear it. But it's a costume so.... Anyhow.

TRAJE DE LUCES. 'Suit of Lights' is what they wear in the bullring. There are THREE interesting aspects of this garment: 1) it is based off of bull-wranglers and people who sit on a SADDLE all day; 2) it really hasn't changed for centuries; and 3) it is 100% woven non-stretch silk. No modern stretchy elastic material stuff. The stretch works in the bias at the various curves.

BINGO. 100% woven no-stretch cotton demin for a skintight Dittos saddleback jean. PLUS SIDE: Matadors move around a LOT. These garments are meant for movement and ceremony. No 'singing-an-octave-higher skinny jeans', no 'falling down because blood isn't circulating to your feet'. 

I can... touch my toes WITHOUT holding my breath and WITHOUT damaging an internal organ. I can... kung-fu kick with no rip. I can crouch down and touch grass. Stretchy comfy fabrics are fun but... you can get the same effect from wovens sometimes. Thank you for attending my 'Talk On Wovens'. Moving on.

So I went back to the 70s. The 1570s. I busted out my old old old Traje de Luces pattern. These were self-drafted from a historical museum cutting layout of Spanish Mens' Breeches, waistcoats, and jackets. I looked at the breeches. They are 6 panel breeches (like a cycling short): front, back, and highly decorative side panel on each leg. The seam line of the back and side panel goes right down the middle back of the Matador's legback (pretty much GRAINLINE). ---> perfect for a Dittos Saddleback. It highlights the man's waist, hip, rear, thigh, knee, calf. (No ankle, the Matador's breeches end just below knee). I also took a look at Tudor tailoring during that period. Specifically, mens' bias-cut hosen. Important takeaway: crotch needs to be uptight and close to prevent ripping and increase leg mobility. Makes sense.

Took my Traje de Luces drafted pattern, re-drew some sewing lines and cutting lines, extended the leg to GROOVY length, added volume for a subtle bellbottom.

**CHAPTER TWO: HERE WE GO! OR.. maybe not**

Made a toile. Did a fitting. It was close but not quite there. Adjusted the fit. Made a 2nd toile. And oh, boy. Yeah this was it! Went to bed, woke up, tossed on the 2nd toile, made some coffee, checked some emails, walked around WEARING THE TOILE and contemplated the meaning of life... and yes, these fit and drape right.

Made a 'final' in my 'good' fabric. It had issues. Still made it to completion. ...Meh. Went to sleep. (Toile #2 was GREAT as pajamas and morning wandering around getting ready for the day. 'Final' was still... meh.)

Woke up. Took a look at the 'final'. And thought, ""OK YOU are my 3rd toile."" Let's go. Got rid of the waistband. (It was bad.) Got rid of pockets. (They served no purpose. I wanted SKINTIGHT uh.. there's no room to put a thing in skintight.) Sliced the side panels and added a straight 1"" increase panel to the outseam width. Waist and hip fit well. Adjusted the saddleback.. hmm. Upper hip, to peak booty, to lower booty to thigh looked meh. Pinned and took a solid look at my pattern. ...And contemplated life.

Tried several things. Adjust the thigh, adjust the 'yoke' seam allowance. Still meh. I wasn't gonna give up. Realized that taking in some places actually constricted the rear and caused buckling ripples along some seams. Fixed that and yes, finally... Breathe.

My 3rd toile (the DENIM JEANS in pics) has some funky adjustments that I purposely decorated as a design choice. Some places are rough and battered. But seeing as how I started from a bullfighter outfit, it kinda felt right? I'm glad I didn't give up on him. He's my first skintight saddleback Dittos-inspired jean. I need a proper Spanish name for him... Miguel? Pedro? Octavio? Hmmm... anyways.  And I now have a paper pattern with all correct adjustments so the next pair should be fun!

**CHAPTER THREE: TRUST**

The very next day, I busted out the pattern and proceeded to make a pair of PINK PRINT SLACKS. (I used up all my denim. Don't worry, this is a good thing. I want to clear my stash. Moving on.) This pink print material is woven poly/cotton blend with a 1/8"" stretch on the weft. I focused on straight-up trusting that the adjustments were correct. Purposely: NO FITTING ADJUSTMENTS. I spent creative energy in print matching. No basting this time. TRUST TRUST TRUST. AND wow... I love them a lot. They feel like sweatpants, pajamas, running tights with a kilt waist. Firm at the gut, hip and rear. Comfy everywhere else.

And I get it now. These pants are fun, racy, cheeky, and SO comfortable. 

**My Dittos-inspired Traje de Luces Saddleback Denim Jeans and Pink Print Saddleback Slacks. 1570s meets 1970s meets 2024**

**Pattern:**

- self drafted from historical 16th Century Spanish breeches cutting layout.
- Decision: no pockets. Clean and lean. The only bulges are me. Original breeches had no pocket.
- Gosh, HEAVILY altered. Yeesh, this pattern is wild and yet...timeless?

**Materials:**

**DENIM SADDLEBACK JEANS**

- 100% cotton woven no-stretch denim (two colors/weaves, same weight)
- Sanguine Red, Dusty Rose, Spanish Gold polyester thread for topstitching; navy blue thread for main stitching; Light Blue polyester thread for basting.
- Vintage metal square button (second thought, is that like a gear part? Haha it was with my buttons. These pants were like 'GIMMMEEE') , red zipper.

**PINK PRINT SADDLEBACK SLACKS**

- Polyester Cotton Blend with 1/8"" stretch on weft
- Lavender polyester thread for topstitching
- Lavender metal zipper, hook eye closure

**Learning:**

- Look to history to solve a question. Humans have been making clothes for as long as the first person existed who was bored of being nakid.
- Toiles/mockups and fittings will SAVE YOU TIME. Do them. Don't abandon them. You might be surprised.
- A MEH FINAL GARMENT is a TOILE. Slice that baby up. Ask it what it needs. 
- Skintight does not mean restricting. These pants are more comfortable than some skinny jeans I own, and PAID for, ... and never wear.
- The bias on curves can do magical things for a fit. 
- TRUST IN ONESELF was a pleasant self-discovery surprise.
- Pattern Matching is fun!

**Takeaways:**

- The DENIM SADDLEBACKS feel like yoga tights but they are completely woven. No stretchy anything in the fabric or threads. 100% woven cotton denim. No stretch nowhere no direction. (Except on the bias.)
- The saddleback curve helps the human body to move in these pants. Bias on the curve is a friend.
- I... kinda like pattern matching??? Who knew?
- Can anyone get me an interview at Jordache? (Does Jordache still exist? Haha.)

In conclusion, I love this style. I love how Menswear has the potential to be exciting, fun, and invigorating. I am grateful for this community. I NEVER knew about Dittos. So, sincerely: THANK YOU.

Next up: adventures in Plaid Dittos-inspired Saddlebacks... expecting bias study and pattern matching decisions, cutting decisions. Should be fun. ... I also got some stripey stuff.. and some corduroy. Decisions, decisions.

NEXT, LONG TERM: get a hold of actual Vintage Dittos and study them.

NEXT, LONG LONG TERM: see actual Traje de Luces and study them.

Good luck to everyone on your sewing journey and sincere thanks for all your comments on the ""Groovy! I made... Dittos!"" post. It truly made my heart warm to read all the encouragement, advice, and HAHAs... and 'words of warning'.. 'dangerous'.... haha. Thanks people. Let's make stuff.",2,1733071603.0,sewing,2,1.0,False

Hi! I am looking primarily for friendship, potentially open to more if it occurs naturally, but not searching for anything more specifically. 

A bit about the type of person I’m looking for: 
I live in western Canada, so a similar time zone to that would be ideal(exact same time zone not necessary, any North American time zone is close enough). I am looking for someone aged 30+(this is a hard boundary). Does not expect constant/instant replies. I would like there to be daily communication, but I’m not constantly glued to my phone. I am looking for someone that is willing and able to put effort into conversation(I will do the same). I am looking for someone kind, fun, maybe a little bit funny, and genuine. Other than that, I’m very open to most other things and am not looking for a specific “type” of person! I’m looking for friendship first and foremost, but wouldn’t be opposed to it if the friendship evolved into something a bit more flirty/feelings develop. That being said, I’m not *looking* for something serious, nor do I have any intention of relocating or anything like that. 



A bit about me/some general interests: 

I love to listen to music, my favorite band since I was 15 lol is Blink 182(have seen them live three times). I like to watch movies and tv shows(who doesn’t?) - I’m definitely a horror girly, but I like other things too! I love ghosts and fall.  I love to shop and get my nails done. I’m a little obsessed with Jellycats. Also a little obsessed with Bobs Burgers.  I love coffee. I’m very close with my family, we spend a lot of time together. I like to try and stay active, and get at least a bit of exercise daily. 
Here are a couple photos of me https://imgur.com/a/5P3SHJq


If you think this sounds like something you’d be interested in, please contact me(chat preferred over DM). Please only message me if you are going to include some context - tell me about yourself, start a conversation based on something I’ve mentioned in my post, it’s up to you but I will likely not spend any effort on “hey” or smalltalk responses.

It’s a cozy 3BHK setup where the owner sublets the other two rooms. One room is mine, the second belongs to the owner (though she’s away on a trip), and the third was temporarily vacant.

Last night, something surreal happened. A girl booked the vacant room as a temporary stopover. She was traveling from the US, on her route to visiting her family in Andhra Pradesh. So she stayed booked this place for 2 days to visit her friends here in Bangalore.

It was Friday night, and I’d just returned from work, was in my room, locked from the inside. Around 10 PM, I heard someone walk in, unaware I was home too. Moments later, I heard crying—loud, heart-wrenching sobs. For a second, it felt like the walls of this silent apartment were the safe space for her to vent it out, assuming no one was home.

Confused and a little alarmed, I stepped out of my room.The other two rooms were locked, yet the crying continued. Unsure of what to do, I turned on the TV in the living room, flipping to Hanuman Chalisa chants, hoping to fill the air with something comforting. That’s when she realized she wasn’t alone.

I was confused and startled, I stepped out to find the source of the sound. Both the other rooms were locked, yet the crying persisted. I got panicked; I turned on the TV in the living room, flipping to Hanuman Chalisa chants for some sense of Positivity. It was then she realized she wasn’t alone. She stepped out, visibly shaken, and introduced herself. She stepped out, startled, her face flushed with the kind of embarrassment, through her tears, she introduced herself.

I gently said*, “Listen, I know you’ve had a bad day. I don’t know what you’re going through, but everything will be alright.”* Her cheeks flushed with embarrassment as she asked softly*, “Was I too loud?”*

*“No worries,”* I smiled. *“Life happens to the best of us. We all go through it, and it’s okay.”*

Something in that moment shifted. The awkwardness melted, replaced by assurance. She asked if she could join me in the living room to watch the TV, and I said yes. We started watching TV, sharing cold coffee and our life stories, career, and shared a great laughter. I made sure she had a good time while we are chatting, kept her engaged, She opened up about her work in South Carolina and Chicago, her in-between phase of life, and the weight she was carrying.

I shared my own story—the heartbreak from years ago that left me guarded, the journey of trying to rebuild myself, and how even the toughest phases in life eventually pass. I wanted her to know that she wasn’t alone, that this was just a moment, not the whole story. Just to keep her assured the worst is not the worst, it's just a phase of life and ""this too shall pass"". There was a simplicity to our conversation—raw, unfiltered, and honest. She smiled often, and I found myself laughing too, something I hadn’t done in a long while.

At one point, while searching for Friends episodes on YouTube, a mantra played in the background (which the owner had saved on youtube). She suddenly remarked, *“Pata hai na main Muslim hoon”* (You know I’m a muslim, right?) "", I responded, ""mujhe to pta hai but TV koi nahi and youtube doesn’t discriminate like our politicians"". (I know, but TV doesn’t and don’t discriminate like our politicians)

She burst into laughter, and in that moment, it felt like all the heaviness she’d carried into the room had lifted. We talked about everything—her jet lag, her insomnia, and even joked like we’d known each other for years. She shared chocolates she’d brought, and we teased each other over little things, letting the night slip away unnoticed.

Before we knew it, it was dawn. She got up to leave and turned to me with a smile. *“This was really nice,” she said. “I was just going to watch some videos and sleep, but this was much better—though I’m still embarrassed about the start.”* I added*, ""they way you were crying, I don't think you were going to watch videos"".*

She laughed and said*, “Good luck with…”*

*“Life,”* I finished for her sentence.

She corrected me, *“I was going to say your US trip—but haan, good luck with life too.”*

That was it. She went to her room, and I went to mine. I stayed awake, replaying the night in my mind—the laughter, her stories, and the way her presence had filled the room with something I hadn’t felt in a long time.

By 8 AM, she was gone. She left the key with the guard, assuming I was asleep. But I wasn’t. I waited, hoping she’d return to pick up her things, but she didn’t.

And just like that, she was gone. No numbers exchanged, no way to find her. I tried looking her up online, but it was futile—a needle in a haystack.

It’s strange. In those few hours, something shifted in me. I’ve been through heartbreak after a 5 years of relationship and spent years building walls around myself, hiding my emotions. But in those 6-7 hours, something shifted. I felt like me again. She was her. Two strangers, from entirely different worlds, sharing a spark in a living room in Bangalore.

I don’t know if she felt the same, or if this night will linger in her memory the way it does in mine. But as I sit here, her face, her eyes, and that radiant smile refuse to leave my mind.

Sometimes, life gives us these rare, serendipitous moments—brief yet profound. They remind us of the beauty in human connection, no matter how fleeting.

I wish her the best in life, wherever she is. And though we may never meet again, I’ll always hold onto this memory. A night filled with smiles, laughter, and hope. A night where, for the first time in years, I felt alive.

I am happy I was there for her and change her sad day to something better. Although I feel sad as she is gone and there is no way will be able to get in touch with her, but I really wish I could be there for her forever to make sure that radiant smile on her face is alive forever.

1h47bua,https://www.reddit.com/r/DeadBedrooms/comments/1h47bua/never_really_considered_an_affair_before_but/,"Never really considered an affair before, but...","Sorry for the long, rambling post. I am undoubtedly a bad person, but I can't talk to anyone irl about this.

All of this started with my goddamn therapist, of all people. I decided to start going to therapy after years of ignoring my issues and now everything, including my completely unsatisfying relationship of 10 years, is coming to light in a very uncomfortable way. We aren't married on paper, but in every other way, we are (house, no kids ever but a dog, finances combined, etc).

My therapist asks me about the relationship and has made it clear that he believes I'm literally one bad step away from an affair. I've never really considered it, honestly. I always figured you had to be hot to have an affair, and I'm pretty far from hot.

Horny, though. I have that going for me. I am so in need of physical affection that makes me feel real, like he really wants me. I get my bf to fuck me about 1 out of every 5 times I ask, including when I 'ask' by literally taking him from his fucking video games and shoving his cock in my mouth. He doesn't get hard, sometimes (most of the time). Our sex is one-sided and bland.

My therapist gave me some homework to communicate my needs, blah blah. You can imagine how well that's going, so now I'm here. Even when we do fuck (after I initiate or get handsy), it's bland and just lacking that passion that we used to have. I fantasize about other men when I'm fucking him, and it helps.

The amount of high-libido women that cheat on their SOs is astonishing. The number of women in my exact situation and have decided to take matters into their own hands (and someone else's) is frankly inspiring. I love my boyfriend, he's amazingly verbally affectionate and kind. He isn't enough for me, though, and I think has gotten comfortable with me and all of the household managing I do. So why not just... get some on the side?

It would be so easy. He trusts me so much. He wouldn't ever suspect a thing. I am left to my own devices almost all the time. He doesn't go through my phone. He walks in on me masturbating and just says ""oops, sorry to interrupt"". It would take a braindead move to get caught.

So now I fantasize about fucking a thoughtful, gentle, and knowledgeable older man that would show me everything I've been missing. I've only been with 2 men in my life. I don't even know what I like and want, but I know I am in desperate need of getting pounded until I cum. I want to be his favorite, even if he fucks other girls. I love the idea of a man who understands how I feel and how desperate it makes people to go so long without a genuine sexual connection. I want to be everything to him that he would be to me, to give him everything he's missing from his wife. My bf is rather slight and slim, it would be amazing to feel a bit of muscle and chub over and under me.

I want to be touched and kissed and hugged and cuddled. And I want to touch, kiss, hug, and cuddle. An affair would have to be with someone I trust, and this process would take an incredibly long time. Are there even men out there that would be so patient with me? Literally starting with a coffee date. Or is that just not how these things go?

I suppose I posted here with the same confused, feral energy that's been plaguing me for weeks. My sexual fantasies have never really involved ME, moreso watching others live them out because I've been stuck with this guy for years. It is nice to imagine humble Lil ol me living some secret double life fucking a guy twice her age.

At the heart of these fantasies is a deep sadness, a mourning for what could have been and what I used to have. We used to fuck like rabbits, kinky and unhinged. Now I'm lucky to get a sideways glance from him.

 I am so close to making a horrible decision... but realistically, I never will cheat on him. The guilt would crush me. I would be giving up everything I've worked so hard for in favor of a little sex. But it feels so important, enough for my mind to fixate on it uncomfortably.

1h47aa1,https://www.reddit.com/r/pourover/comments/1h47aa1/frustrated_with_dialing_in_my_pour_over_coffee/,Frustrated with dialing in my pour over coffee,"Ok I've been on this (rabbit hole) journey for some years now and I've not yet mastered the art of dialing in pour over coffee.  I have done well (enough) for espresso - granted adding foamy milk grants you some leaniance to how perfect the espresso needs to be. However, I cannot make it work for pour over. So far I'm almost finished with this bag from Joshua Tree Coffee (light roast) and have yet to fully enjoy a cup of ""bliss"" as I'd like to call it when everything comes together and you get that happy cup of coffee.

This morning I tried 3 cups - each with same temp (93 C) and same coffee and same ratio (15 g coffee / 240 g water = 16), and same recipe. The recipe was 70 grams water for bloom phase to 1 minute, then add water to get to 200 grams, then at 2 min mark, add 40 grams water, let drain, stirring once towards the end to ensure uniform foundation. The difference simply was 1 variable - grind size. I used my Timemore 64s to grind at levels (from right to left of photo) 6, 8 and 10 setting. Each time I took the grinds and did a ""blind shake"" of them to ensure uniformity before I placed the grinds into the vessel.

The results, for me, well ...

I leaned towards the coffee made from grind size 8. I noticed that when I tasted that one, there was a hint of something nice but it wasn't able to truly come forward because (I think) other notes like bitter, etc were still too strong and blocking the fruits and lighter notes.

The cup on the right (grind level 6) was bitter, but oddly as I kept tasting it became less bitter.. or maybe my tongue was getting adjusted.

The cup on the left (grind level 10) was what I was expecting to be the best but it wasn't. I couldn't taste any fruity notes or anything but honestly I'm just confused by the taste. Cannot figure it out. This is where I get a bit frustrated.

And in the end, what to do? So I ask for some help here, granted you are not able to taste these cups yourself but am I even doing things right? I don't have a ton of equipment so I know this isn't scientific, but it's meant to at least help me find the ""sweet spot"" for a new bag of coffee. I feel I need to explore something with the grind size 8 cup but I am not sure what to do there. Higher temp with same grind size, etc? Lower temp to reduce bitter notes? Faster pours? Move grind size from 8 down to 7?

I have followed Lance Hedrick and James Hoffman and Morgan Eckroth and others for a long time now and why do I feel still in this ""frustration brew"" and feeling myself very over-extracted and quite bitter with how hard this process still is and each day we loose a ton of coffee in the world just to dial in and we loose a ton of potential coffee specialists to the simple fact that this is not easy folks. I've had days where I wanted to toss it all in the trash and go back to those Nespresso machine days and try not to think about the environment impact at all and just worry about my daily frustrations or lack of.

It’s a cozy 3BHK setup where the owner sublets the other two rooms. One room is mine, the second belongs to the owner (though she’s away on a trip), and the third was temporarily vacant.

about a week ago.

I think I'm 90% recovered and will return to office and normal routine from Monday, tomorrow. This is just my record for my own purposes, but also to share what happened to a person who got the Covid for the first time. Early 40s male, vaccinated early this year, our family got the vaccine once a year every year (twice for flu).

Nov 21 Thu close to midnight:

* Feeling chill and bodyache, I thought it is just flu, had a Tylenol and fall a sleep

Nov 22 Fri morning

* Thanks to Tyleonol, flu-alike symptoms were weakened, but I couldn't taste almost anything at all. This is the moment I realize this might be Covid. I tested, got positive. Fortunately, my family were all OK and negative.
* I immediately began to separate myself to my room.
* I contacted my boss to request sick leave until the end of holiday, and contact everyone I met on Thursday about my Covid and asked them to check Covid if you have any symptom.

Nov 22 Fri afternoon

* Bodyache, chill, fever were severe. I remember, at one point, temperature reached 105 and was panic. The wave of Bodyache, chill, fever visits every 4\~6 hour cycle, as far as I remember.
* Headache, cough, runny nose, nose congestion, and sore throat were severe.
* I contacted my family doctor, he prescribed me Paxlovid. But local pharmarcy was too busy and Dr's office send prescription to late, I was unable to get Paxlovid on Friday.
* I only had soups. My digestion capability was really low, I can feel it. But since I can't have Tylenol/Advil in empty stomach, I try to eat something.
* I only drink tea, water, and Getorade.
* I had max. strength Mucinex every 10\~12 hours + swapped Tylenol/Advil every 4 hours.
* Looking back now, I guess headache is probably because of caffeine deficit. We decided to change from coffee to tea (without caffeine). But I think that was good decision. Because I was having strange green stool + diarrhea, which is also typical for Covid.

Nov 23 Sat

* Similar with Friday. Fever was still 99\~102, at one point reached 104.
* Begin Paxlovid, twice a day. That metallic after taste wasn't good.
* I'm not sure if I'm the only person who feel this, but Paxlovid makes me feel drowsy and sleepy. But Paxlovid doesn't have such side effect. I don't know what happened. Maybe because of Advil/Tylenol? Anyway, I always sleep around lunch time, after I have Paxlovid around 10AM.
* I had max. strength Mucinex every 10\~12 hours + swapped Tylenol/Advil every 4 hours.
* I only had soup and Gatorade.

Nov 24 Sun

* Similar with Saturday, but Fever goes down, 99\~100 level.
* But sore throat become so severe, I couldn't drink or talk properly.
* All others are the same.
* I must say, Wegmans Italian Wedding soup and my wife's Chicken Noodle soup saved my life during this weekend. Despite sore throat, I was able to eat these. I sense a bit of taste was came back, not full.

Nov 25 Mon

* I feel Paxlovid was working, from Monday my chill, bodyache, and fever goes to decline.
* But sore throat was still severe, headache, cough, runny nose, nose congestion as well.
* More taste came back.

Nov 26 Tue

* From this point fever, chill, bodyache was almost gone, max was 99 at morning. But I continued to monitor. I stopped Tylenol/Advil.
* Sore throat become eased a bit, but cough, runny nose, nose congestion become more severe despite Mucinex. Because of this, I decided to not to go any party or anywhere during holiday season. Fortunately, for this year our family decided to skip the gathering. We got some invitations from family friends, but I skipped all of those.
* Digestion function and stomach feels much better, began to eat normal foods. Diarrhea become less severe.

Nov 27 Wed

* Body temperature was normal after 24 hour after cease of Tylenol/Advil. But cough, runny nose, nose congestion was still there.
* I was able to feel sore throat but much less than Monday level.
* Last day of Paxlovid. It worked on me. Fortunately, Covid re-spike didn't occur to me so far, after I finished my Paxlovid. 

Nov 28 Thu \~ Dec 1 Sun (today)

* Change to semi-separation from Nov 28 Thu. I mostly stayed in my room, but came out of my room to do something with mask on.
* We have 8 years old kid, I don't want to spread my Covid to him, so we took extra care, I tried to stay at my room as much as possible, went outside of my room only when it is needed.
* Cough, runny nose, nose congestion slowly dwindled. I still have occasional runny nose and cough though.
* Right now I'm doing big laundry and cleaning.

I will return to office and normal routine from tomorrow, but I think I may need to use my mask for a week, because of my cough.

I forget to mention, but I didn't skip multivitamin every day, and I also had Emergen-C powder with water a cup a day. Maybe these helped a bit.

But I have very important sports league match incoming, I don't know what to do. I already skipped a week, it is kinda not good for my team if I skip incoming week as well.

I still have mild cough and runny nose. But these days, weather is cold and dry, it is not possible to live without cough and runny nose for most of population. So, I wonder if I can join the league game mid of incoming week...

I hope not to get Covid again. Hopefully the next vaccine works well to prevent as many variants as possible.

I wish everyone in here recovers and gets back to the normal as soon as possible.",3,1733071164.0,COVID19positive,1,1.0,False

I do have a pour over and a french press, but I feel like I need to make more coffee in one go and keep it warm for longer because me and my partner drink maybe a cup or two each every morning, so we thought why not go for a coffee maker because it does that job. If you have recommendations, I'd love to hear it. Also, if you know retailers or brands who might offer good deals on coffee makers this Cyber Monday, that'd be great too.

1h477ps,https://www.reddit.com/r/carnivorediet/comments/1h477ps/very_small_boned_man_on_carnivore_weak_no_matter/,Very small boned man on carnivore - weak no matter how much I eat or workout ,"I am doing strength training, at the gym. I have always been weak & thin boned. Personal trainers are almost always surprised by how little I can lift, and how big my muscles look by comparison  to how little I can lift 😂🤣 I have very thin wrists (around 16cm or just over 6”)

My muscle mass is out of range on most gym machines - I mean muscle mass below range for the average male. I’m like all those slender looking men in large major cities… I’m very non dangerous looking 😂🤣 

I’d like to change this if possible but appreciate might be difficult… I’m 43, 176cm, 67kg, 16% body fat, I eat until stuffed, about 750g ribeye a day

All blood normal, testosterone normal

Larger muscle mass is associated with higher metabolic health & more calorie needs and also is more “forgiving” of insults eg carbs or toxins or caffeine etc. for example when I was at my peak of muscularity (only average for most men but very muscular for me, I looked super muscular due to having a small frame), I was able to tolerate all sorts of insults like coffee or carbs without getting fat or feeling bad. When I’m less muscular, I can’t even drink decaf coffee without negative results (jittery etc) and can’t eat any carbs at all without feeling bad or getting fat (which is why I’m on lion diet), when I’m of low muscle mass I can’t eat a single plant without anxiety, everything I eat is absorbed and very little filtered out from what I can tell. 

But I eat until super stuffed. It just seems to be my body type. I’ve always been like this- I gain fat very easily & it goes beyond what is healthy for men easily (I reach 23% or more if I’m not careful what I eat). Since I look muscular with a normal amount of muscle, you can imagine what having 23% body fat has on me – I get triple chins, manboobs, and feel so sluggish. Optimal range for me is 12 to 16%, which matches the optimal range for most men. 

The only way I was able to gain muscle to reach an “average” male was by taking light TRT from my doctor for 2 months while working out daily - but that was more of an experiment than a “need” as my testosterone is in the normal range …

I think some men in modern world especially  in major cities  are just small / weak. Either we are malformed due to lack of nutrition in childhood and in womb or there is a smaller male population in the human race and we are adapted to absorb more from our food (like a super efficient car) because we aren’t as adapted to hunting as the average stronger or  larger men. 🤷🏼‍♂️ 

It is well-known that the size of men varies according to population, for example, in Holland, they have the tallest men in the world. They are very thick set and large bones. I’m probably half their their size in total mass 😂 

I started lion diet three years ago. I don’t cheat. Recently incorporated wild low pollution, high omega-3 fish like wild sardines.

I work out with relatively light weights around four times a week (approx 8kg of bicep curls, 10kg chest press)… bar only without weight for squats… If I force myself to lift heavy, I end up with an injury and unable to lift for a month or more. 

I also walk for around one hour a day, briskly. I have plenty of energy.

I don’t have any symptoms, all of my health issues have resolved or reduced. The only thing is I wish I could be a bit more muscular, with a larger muscle mass, so that I could be stronger

Insights or experiences welcome…

I tried relaxed carnivore also incorporating eggs etc, for around 9 months. I got fat but didn’t gain much muscle. Feel better on lion diet ",1,1733071039.0,carnivorediet,3,0.67,False

I'm here because I can'tsee a doctor and I can't  post this to other places since it is just my health anxiety and rattling off symptoms that might not even mean anything. But something is wrong. My stomach hasn't stopped hurting for a long time. I have good days though and think it was just my imagination or that I ate something bad. Then it starts up again with more weird stuff. I've been having recurrent diarrhea and finding blood in my bowel movements. Thought it could just be haemorrhoids. Earlier this week though the stool itself was bloody, not bright red but like coffee grains. Sometimes there is mucus with stool. Today I pooped only mucus. 

I am.....fucking terrified. I have an urge to throw up and poop and can't cause I'm empty. But I don't feel like this is a typical stomach virus. I have had stomach viruses, this isn't it. I am still thirsty and hungry, I want to drnik water and cant' because idk what will happen. I'm just in pain and feel fucked up in there like a pressure on my insides. The pain never goes away it just becomes less noticable. It's been like this for months and I have put it off for a couple factors like because of depression and passive suicidality/death wish, because I don't have the healthiest lifestyle, because I have anxiety and that can mimic all kinds of ailments. I have been wrong about things before. I thought once I had asthma. I did not have asthma. ¯\\\_(ツ)\_/¯ 

So uh yeah. Idk man the body is a carnival of horrors and I'm thinking about my mortality and just really sad because my mood has been amazing recently and I've had a surge of creative energy. I've been writing stories and actually able to finish them and do some editing. Normally it is so hard to focus and complete anything. I'm just grateful I got to feel joy for a little while.

1h4777i,https://www.reddit.com/r/AmIOverreacting/comments/1h4777i/aio_my_wife_goes_back_to_bed_at_8_am/,AIO My wife goes back to bed at 8 am.,"If she gets woken up at 8 AM, she will actually go back to bed to sleep for another hour and a half. 

My wife works from home a pretty cushy customer service job. I am the ""stay at home"" parent. I have some side things that bring in about 900-1k a month. But I ""manage"" most everything about the household and kids. Help that she gives, are things I have to specifically ask her to do. She will do some simple things on her own like changing a diaper...but not always.

 I have a huge problem in general with my wife's laziness and feeling like I need more help with chores and parenting etc. But specifically for this post, getting up in the morning is a serious problem that drives me nuts. She seemingly needs at least 10 hours of sleep. Her work schedule right now is 11-7:30 and the not having to start until 11 is nice but I hate that she works so late. I want her to change her schedule to get off a little earlier but she would have to start earlier. And she tries to not get up until 9:30. And of course she's one of those dreadfully slow wakers who needs to sip coffee and be a zombie for an hour before you can really even talk to her. As a result I get almost no help in the mornings before she has to go in to work. 

She gets off at 7:30 so we generally have already eaten dinner without her. She needs to relax and have a smoke after work so I don't really get any help from her until at least 8, more likely 8:30 to 9. That's already the kids bedtime. 

Am I overreacting for wanting her to get out of bed by 8 am and to help me more? 

I would estimate, even when she doesn't work, I do 70+% of all household chores and errands. Probably at least 90% of errands that require leaving the house are done by me. We have 3 kids 8 months, 4 years and 9 years. The 4 year old is autistic. The 9 year old is home schooled. It's A LOT of work caring for the kids during the day. I desperately need more help with cleaning and errands. After years of begging, it hasn't really gotten much better.  ",0,1733071003.0,AmIOverreacting,7,0.5,False

I’m reaching out to small business owners to learn about your experiences with creating product documentation, particularly user manuals (for physical products-say like coffee machines). I’m interested in understanding:

* The Process: How do you approach creating user manuals from scratch? What are the key steps you follow?

* Digital vs. Paper: Do you offer digital manuals, and if so, what tools or platforms do you use?

* Challenges: What challenges have you encounter in developing product documentation?

Any insights or advice you can share would be greatly appreciated.

1h473jg,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/1h473jg/an_unexpected_date/,An Unexpected Date,"I’m staying in an Airbnb in Bangalore for a little while—a first for me, choosing this over the usual hotel stays. It’s a cozy 3BHK setup where the owner sublets the other two rooms. One room is mine, the second belongs to the owner (though she’s away on a trip), and the third was temporarily vacant.

Last night, something surreal happened. A girl booked the vacant room as a temporary stopover. She was traveling from the US, on her route to visiting her family in Andhra Pradesh. So she stayed booked this place for 2 days to visit her friends here in Bangalore.

It was Friday night, and I’d just returned from work, I was in my room, locked from the inside. Around 10 PM, I heard someone walk in, unaware I was home too. Moments later, I heard crying—loud, heart-wrenching sobs. For a second, it felt like the walls of this silent apartment were the safe space for her to vent it out, assuming no one was home.

Confused and a little alarmed, I stepped out of my room.The other two rooms were locked, yet the crying continued. Unsure of what to do, I turned on the TV in the living room, flipping to Hanuman Chalisa chants, hoping to fill the air with something comforting. That’s when she realized she wasn’t alone.

I was confused and startled, I stepped out to find the source of the sound. Both the other rooms were locked, yet the crying persisted. I got panicked; I turned on the TV in the living room, flipping to Hanuman Chalisa chants for some sense of Positivity. It was then she realized she wasn’t alone. She stepped out, visibly shaken, and introduced herself. She stepped out, startled, her face flushed with the kind of embarrassment, through her tears, she introduced herself.

I gently said*, “Listen, I know you’ve had a bad day. I don’t know what you’re going through, but everything will be alright.”* Her cheeks flushed with embarrassment as she asked softly*, “Was I too loud?”*

*“No worries,”* I smiled. *“Life happens to the best of us. We all go through it, and it’s okay.”*

Something in that moment shifted. The awkwardness melted, replaced by assurance. She asked if she could join me in the living room to watch the TV, and I said yes. We started watching TV, sharing cold coffee and our life stories, career, and shared a great laughter. I made sure she had a good time while we are chatting, kept her engaged, She opened up about her work in South Carolina and Chicago, her in-between phase of life, and the weight she was carrying.

I shared my own story—the heartbreak from years ago that left me guarded, the journey of trying to rebuild myself, and how even the toughest phases in life eventually pass. I wanted her to know that she wasn’t alone, that this was just a moment, not the whole story. Just to keep her assured the worst is not the worst, it's just a phase of life and ""this too shall pass"". There was a simplicity to our conversation—raw, unfiltered, and honest. She smiled often, and I found myself laughing too, something I hadn’t done in a long while.

At one point, while searching for Friends episodes on YouTube, a mantra played in the background (which the owner had saved on youtube). She suddenly remarked, *“Pata hai na main Muslim hoon”* (You know I’m a muslim, right?) "", I responded, ""mujhe to pta hai but TV koi nahi and youtube doesn’t discriminate like our politicians"". (I know, but TV doesn’t and don’t discriminate like our politicians)

She burst into laughter, and in that moment, it felt like all the heaviness she’d carried into the room had lifted. We talked about everything—her jet lag, her insomnia, and even joked like we’d known each other for years. She shared chocolates she’d brought, and we teased each other over little things, letting the night slip away unnoticed.

Before we knew it, it was dawn. She got up to leave and turned to me with a smile. *“This was really nice,” she said. “I was just going to watch some videos and sleep, but this was much better—though I’m still embarrassed about the start.”* I added*, ""they way you were crying, I don't think you were going to watch videos"".*

She laughed and said*, “Good luck with…”*

*“Life,”* I finished for her sentence.

She corrected me, *“I was going to say your US trip—but haan, good luck with life too.”*

That was it. She went to her room, and I went to mine. I stayed awake, replaying the night in my mind—the laughter, her stories, and the way her presence had filled the room with something I hadn’t felt in a long time.

By 8 AM, she was gone. She left the key with the guard, assuming I was asleep. But I wasn’t. I waited, hoping she’d return to pick up her things, but she didn’t.

And just like that, she was gone. No numbers exchanged, no way to find her. I tried looking her up online, but it was futile—a needle in a haystack.

It’s strange. In those few hours, something shifted in me. I’ve been through heartbreak after a 5 years of relationship and spent years building walls around myself, hiding my emotions. But in those 6-7 hours, something shifted. I felt like me again. She was her. Two strangers, from entirely different worlds, sharing a spark in a living room in Bangalore.

I don’t know if she felt the same, or if this night will linger in her memory the way it does in mine. But as I sit here, her face, her eyes, and that radiant smile refuse to leave my mind.

Sometimes, life gives us these rare, serendipitous moments—brief yet profound. They remind us of the beauty in human connection, no matter how fleeting.

I wish her the best in life, wherever she is. And though we may never meet again, I’ll always hold onto this memory. A night filled with smiles, laughter, and hope. A night where, for the first time in years, I felt alive.

I am happy I was there for her and change her sad day to something better. Although I feel sad as she is gone and there is no way will be able to get in touch with her, but I really wish I could be there for her forever to make sure that radiant smile on her face is alive forever.

If you are reading this (very limited chance). Wish you goodluck stranger, I hope you shine brighter than the North Star, And don’t forget to travel other places too, airport halts don’t counts. And between me and you, I have kept the Pooky with me.",2,1733070724.0,dating,2,1.0,False

1h4710b,https://www.reddit.com/r/StardewValley/comments/1h4710b/aitah_divine_intervention_denying_divorce/,AITAH: Divine Intervention Denying Divorce,"AITAH for wanting to divorce Leah, even though the game won’t let me?

I’ve been married to Leah for four amazing summers in Stardew Valley. We’ve built a beautiful life together—over a million gold earned, two amazing kids raised, and a house that reflects all her artistic flair. Leah’s been an incredible partner, always holding down the fort while I spent seasons developing the island. I love her and deeply appreciate everything she’s done for us.

But lately, I’ve been questioning if I rushed into marriage before I really knew myself or what I wanted out of the game. Leah was the natural choice back then, but now I want to explore other connections in the Valley, ones I never gave myself the chance to build. I’ve realized that I’ve grown and want to experience more out of life.

I’ve made the difficult decision to file for divorce—except, I can’t. Every time I try to end my marriage, no matter how many different ways I replay the day, the game crashes when I go to sleep, and I wake up as if nothing happened. At this point, I’ve perfected my “divorce day” routine:

I still make sure Leah gets her morning coffee, and I’ve set aside a bottle of iridium-quality peach wine as a final gift for her. I kiss the kids goodbye and ride to the mayor’s house to file the papers. Afterward, I spend the rest of the day working on the farm, doing my best to tend to my responsibilities. At night, I take a quest to harvest 100 taro and head to the island to process my feelings.

I used to handle it poorly—drinking at the saloon all day and punishing myself with that stupid Prairie King game—but I’ve matured. Now, I’m ready to move forward with dignity. Except, I can’t. It seems Yoba, the great god of the Valley, opposes my decision to divorce Leah.

So, AITAH for even wanting this? Should I continue trying to divorce Leah dozens more times, or do I accept that we’re cosmically bound and stay with her, knowing I tried to leave? And if I do stay, how do I reconcile sleeping in the same bed as her after this?

# 1. Create a Trigger List

>Every ADHD brain is unique, and every life is unique, so what triggers one person’s sensory overload may not trigger another.   But when we know the things that are most likely to trigger sensory overload, we can not only think ahead of time about how to handle them, but we may be able to avoid them as well.

>**Creating a list of your most common triggers** is a great way to do this.  I know- it’s really tempting to just do this in your head, but writing it down really helps.  It allows you to think it through more fully while providing something you can refer back to or add on to.  Once you have a list of the things that often trigger your overload, you can go through it and ask yourself- is there a way I can avoid this trigger?  When does this trigger happen?  What can I do to minimize how this trigger impacts me?

# 2. Block Sensory Inputs

>Because sensory inputs tend to build on each other, tools like **noise-canceling headphones, earplugs, blue-light filtering glasses, tagless clothing, sunhats, and umbrellas and saying no to loud, busy social obligations** can go a long way to reducing sensory overload because they keep your nervous system farther from meltdown levels.

# 3. Increase your Inputs

>I know!  Sounds crazy!  This is a post about being overloaded- why on earth would we want to increase our inputs?!?  
  
Remember I said that ADHD brains tend to need more stimulation to activate and, therefore, sometimes seek out extra and wind up getting overloaded?  Well, we can take a page out of the sensory diets of our kids by intentionally adding in just enough stimulation to keep our system regulated and focused but not so much we can’t handle it.

>How do we do that?    
  
Think through your day; when are you most likely to feel dysregulated?  When does your attention falter?    
  
Those are the times you want to **add in a bit of sensory stimulation with things like:** 

* Standing on a wiggle board, 
* sitting on an exercise ball, 
* Listening to instrumental music
* Listening to Brown noise 
* Playing with Fidgets
* Knitting 
* Getting A tight hug
* Weight lifting, a quick set of push-ups or jumping jacks
* Wrapping yourself in a heavy blanket
* Rocking in a rocking chair

(Youtube: [Brown Noise for ADHD](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BlON1dvbGOo), [5 Minute Guided Meditation for ADHD](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3yL6jFWf_Hw))

# 4. Practice Calm Down Strategies

>But we don’t just want to offer more stimulation.  We need strategies to help us respond when life offers more sensory stimulation than our systems can handle too.   
  
First, you want to brainstorm a couple of options.  Things like **going for a walk, deep breathing, screaming into a pillow, crying to a friend, meditation, or lying in a dark room** are all possible strategies.  Once you have a list of several that might work for you, see if you can pair and practice a few of them throughout the day.  Can you practice 5 deep breaths every time you wash your hands?  Can you take a 10-minute walk after lunch?  Can you prep the cool compress that you’ll use?  Can you take a soak in a tub a couple of nights a week as you are getting ready for bed?  Can you watch your kids' fish tank while having your coffee each morning?

# 5. Get in Motion

>When our systems are overloaded or on the brink of overload, it taxes our nervous system, ramping us up into fight/flight/freeze mode.  And that mode is all about action and movement.  [Getting into motion](https://www.addept.org/living-with-adult-add-adhd/12-ways-exercise-boosts-adhd-brain) does the job of that mode, spending its energy and helping us calm down and relax.  Having a regular practice of exercise allows an ADHD to regularly offload some of that extra stimulation. But using motion as a calm-down is a great strategy too.

# 6. Use Task Management Strategies

>One of the reasons ADHD brains are more likely to cross the threshold into sensory overload is that we can be so easily overwhelmed by the logistics and tasks of life.  Having and using [task management and planning strategies](https://www.addept.org/living-with-adult-add-adhd/the-best-to-do-list-for-adults-with-adhd) can be key in reducing that extra load, making us less likely to tip over into meltdown mode.

I had childhood and adolescent OCD. I completed ERT at a young age and it was very helpful. But I'm becoming more aware that the OCD ""neuropathways"" as my doctor refers to it, are influencing my day to day at home.

How this manifests:

1. Does anyone actually avoid cleaning as opposed to over-cleaning? I avoid a few specific areas and let them get totally out of control because I don't want to have contact with them at all. This has to change.
2. I put off purchases that I need for years, like a water filter. I have spent countless hours researching them. I've never felt like my choice would be the right one...so here I am, YEARS later, drinking from the tap or periodically fumbling with the option I have and really hate with wasteful ineffective filters.
3. I have major consumption guilt. I made myself buy a coffee system with pods (recyclable) this week after thinking about it, and using an awful inefficient ""solution,"" for about 4 years. I know I'm going to struggle with the guilt over the pods even though I'll be recycling them and I've read all about how they're recycled and should feel good about it. I'm actually considering this one exposure therapy...
4. I have a hard time throwing things out. I worry I'll need them, or I feel that attachment to the items. It feels wasteful. I live in an apartment, so there's nowhere to store things and they're starting to just take up space in the rooms.
5. I check for bugs constantly. In fact its probably why I avoid cleaning the areas I do - I've seen bugs there in the past, and I rarely go near these areas without scanning for bugs and feeling anxious. I also keep dirty dishes in sort of weird places when I'm not ready to clean them yet because I don't want to attract bugs...not cool. Also am overly conscious of and avoid where exterminators have sprayed in the past.

All things considered, this isn't so bad. I've had very debilitating OCD at points in my life so I recognize how manageable this is. But I want to feel less held back by these tendencies and I don't hear them referred to too often, so am curious if anyone relates. Overall this adds up to an unkept household, even though I absolutely love a clean functioning space. Its also a huge waste of time and energy...most people just buy things, throw them out, clean their stuff...its one thing to be environmentally conscious and make a difference with your choices but its another to be obsessed and anxious about it to a point of paralysis. I might get an office job again just to get out more often too. I think for those of us that WFH these things do escalate with the isolation.",1,1733070058.0,OCD,0,1.0,False

1h46qgg,https://www.reddit.com/r/NarcissisticSpouses/comments/1h46qgg/the_omelettes_rules/,The Omelette's Rules,"When I met the narcissistic vampire, I was a widower. Having been married for a couple of decades, that marriage was a significant part of my life. I confided in the narcissist, who at the time pretended to be very interested in my past with my late wife. I told them about our family tradition, where I would make breakfast for our children one day a week. This allowed my wife to rest, and I took care of the kids. I would make them whatever they wanted for that morning. We would make sure to already have everything on hand for pancakes, waffles, eggs, omelets, French toast, and any other dish we could think of. I became particularly skilled at making customized omelets for them. 

During the initial stages of our relationship, the narcissist pretended to be everything I could ever ask for in a spouse and expressed a strong desire to try my self-described ""world-famous"" omelets and seemed to genuinely enjoy hearing stories about my life with my wife and kids. Shortly after we got married, she insisted that we maintain our weekend tradition of preparing a big, homemade breakfast. Sometimes, we would invite my grown kids, but mostly it was a special ritual just between the two of us.

The first time I made her an omelet for breakfast, she claimed it was the best she had, even better than the many French restaurants in France she had visited. I found this hard to believe, but it was nice to know she loved the food I prepared for her.

Many months into the relationship, which was already chaotic, as one might expect, I still found some satisfaction in making her breakfast from time to time. Naturally, being a lazy narcissist, she enjoyed being served by others. However, that satisfaction was soon diminished by the confusing and manipulative rules that narcissists tend to impose.

The first rule I had to follow was that she didn't like any brown spots on her eggs; she preferred them to be completely yellow, with no brown at all, even around the edges. If you cook eggs regularly, you know that achieving that perfect look on the stovetop isn’t easy. However, I figured out the technique. I would usually make my eggs first as a test, and then I’d cook hers, making any necessary adjustments.

The next rule was that she didn't want salt added to the omelet after it was cooked. She insisted that it should be mixed into the eggs at the beginning. I found this request quite strange, as I wasn't sure what difference it would make. Nevertheless, I tried my best to comply.  However, there were times when I got a rhythm and reverted to autopilot, leading me to forget to mix the salt in with the eggs once or twice.

Of course, the fact that I would wake up early to prepare a complete breakfast for her—sometimes including toast and fresh fruit, a lovingly made omelet, and fresh coffee with whipped cream—was no indication of my feelings for her. Instead, she would often tell me how much I didn’t care, how I never listened to her, and even how it was a mistake to marry me. Simply because of one minor variation.

Naturally, this situation led to defensiveness on my part, resulting in a full-blown argument. However, in an effort to maintain peace, I suggested that she could help make the omelet. This way, we could share a moment as a loving couple, and she could mix in her own salt with the eggs to ensure I wouldn't forget. The negotiation took a long time and was quite tedious, but eventually, she agreed to give that a try.

That approach worked for a while, maybe for a couple of months. However, as omelets often do, their consistency began to vary for many obvious reasons. When this happened, new rules were established: more cheese, ensure they aren't undercooked, and so on. Whenever I felt defensive about all the nitpicking and the seemingly endless set of rules I had to follow just to show my love for my wife, an argument would inevitably arise over something trivial.

It came to an abrupt end one day when, after an argument the night before, in which I tried to let wash off my back, I got up as usual and went about cooking a nice breakfast, hoping that it would lighten the mood in the house. She came out, acting as if the horrid argument from the night before never happened, which was a relief. She took her place beside me and began mixing the eggs for the next omelet as I cooked the first. This day was different because I had just bought a new non-stick frying pan, and I hadn't cooked with it before. As any normal human being would surmise, it took me a little while to adjust to the new variables that the pan introduced. And guess what? The omelet in the pan was cooking much faster than anticipated. And the edges were showing signs of browning.

Of course, she immediately began criticizing me and sharing a sob story—made up, as it turns out—about how she gets heartburn when the eggs are browned. Despite my efforts to remain as neutral as possible, I guess some pent-up frustration from the night before came through. Then, her true nature revealed itself, and the criticism shifted to belittling and hurtful accusations about me not caring. This, despite me even starting on her omelet. I poured her eggs into the pan and listened to her turn steadily into the raving lunatic she always did. Something snapped.

I slammed the pan down on the glass-top stove and said, ""Finish your own damn omelets, you ungrateful bitch. Don't ever ask me to cook you anything ever again."" I meant it. I didn't cook for ever again.

I told this story because it illustrates the process they use to string you along, making you think that if you just get every detail correct, things will finally be right between you.
