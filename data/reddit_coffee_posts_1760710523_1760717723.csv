Hi! My name is Stephanie! I‚Äôm 35 and live in Western Canada (Specifically - Alberta). I am hoping to make a new online friend that is fun/funny, genuine, willing/able to put effort into conversations(I will do the same!). I would prefer to chat with people around my age, or older(please no one under 30!), that is able to text/write full words lol - a bit of slang is cool, but I can‚Äôt do the whole ‚Äúu‚Äù instead of ‚Äúyou‚Äù thing etc all the time! 

Some things I enjoy that could give an idea if we have interests in common, or just to start a conversation: music! My favorite band is blink 182, and has been since I was 14 - also pretty into Alkaline Trio, mgk, Taylor Swift etc etc. I enjoy shopping and getting my nails done - I see a very talented nail tech that makes all my nail art dreams a reality. I love coffee, movie and tv shows, with a preference for anything horror. I love to exercise daily, and love to go for long walks. Other things too, but I don‚Äôt want to give everything away here, or make this intro too long. 

If this interests you and you‚Äôd like to have a chat, please send me a message with a quick introduction!

( i need every seconds detail ?? that what- what you have thought and done on every single second )



can you tell me every single detail of your \`1 cheapest Minute Or your whole hour, day, week, month, year or your whole life ??



if you are not able to tell me about this life then what proof do you have that you didn't forget your past ? and that you will not forget this present life in the future ?



that is Fact that Supreme Lord Krishna exists but we posses no such intelligence to understand him.

there is also next life. and i already proved you that no scientist, no politician, no so-called intelligent man in this world is able to understand this Truth. cuz they are imagining. and you cannot imagine what is god, who is god, what is after life etc.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

for example :Your father existed before your birth. you cannot say that before your birth your father don,t exists.



So you have to ask from mother, ""Who is my father?"" And if she says, ""This gentleman is your father,"" then it is all right. It is easy.

Otherwise, if you makes research, ""Who is my father?"" go on searching for life; you'll never find your father.



( now maybe...maybe you will say that i will search my father from D.N.A, or i will prove it by photo's, or many other thing's which i will get from my mother and prove it that who is my Real father.{ So you have to believe the authority. who is that authority ? she is your mother. you cannot claim of any photo's, D.N.A or many other things without authority ( or ur mother ).



if you will show D.N.A, photo's, and many other proofs from other women then your mother. then what is use of those proofs ??} )



same you have to follow real authority. ""Whatever You have spoken, I accept it,"" Then there is no difficulty. And You are accepted by Devala, Narada, Vyasa, and You are speaking Yourself, and later on, all the acaryas have accepted. Then I'll follow.

I'll have to follow great personalities. The same reason mother says, this gentleman is my father. That's all. Finish business. Where is the necessity of making research? All authorities accept Krsna, the Supreme Personality of Godhead. You accept it; then your searching after God is finished.



Why should you waste your time?

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

all that is you need is to hear from authority ( same like mother ). and i heard this truth from authority "" Srila Prabhupada "" he is my spiritual master.

im not talking these all things from my own.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_



in this world no \`1 can be Peace full. this is all along Fact.



cuz we all are suffering in this world 4 Problems which are Disease, Old age, Death, and Birth after Birth.



tell me are you really happy ?? you can,t be happy if you will ignore these 4 main problem. then still you will be Forced by Nature.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_



if you really want to be happy then follow these 6 Things which are No illicit s.ex, No g.ambling, No d.rugs ( No tea & coffee ), No meat-eating ( No onion & garlic's )



5th thing is whatever you eat \`1st offer it to Supreme Lord Krishna. ( if you know it what is Guru parama-para then offer them food not direct Supreme Lord Krishna )



and 6th "" Main Thing "" is you have to Chant "" hare krishna hare krishna krishna krishna hare hare hare rama hare rama rama rama hare hare "".

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

If your not able to follow these 4 things no illicit s.ex, no g.ambling, no d.rugs, no meat-eating then don,t worry but chanting of this holy name ( Hare Krishna Maha-Mantra ) is very-very and very important.



Chant "" hare krishna hare krishna krishna krishna hare hare hare rama hare rama rama rama hare hare "" and be happy.



if you still don,t believe on me then chant any other name for 5 Min's and chant this holy name for 5 Min's and you will see effect. i promise you it works And chanting at least 16 rounds ( each round of 108 beads ) of the Hare Krishna maha-mantra daily.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

Here is no Question of Holy Books quotes, Personal Experiences, Faith or Belief. i accept that Sometimes Faith is also Blind. Here is already Practical explanation which already proved that every\`1 else in this world is nothing more then Busy Foolish and totally idiot.

Source(s):

every \`1 is already Blind in this world and if you will follow another Blind then you both will fall in hole. so try to follow that person who have Spiritual Eyes who can Guide you on Actual Right Path. ( my Authority & Guide is my Spiritual Master "" Srila Prabhupada "" )

I brewed french roast with 10 clicks on c3s using south indian filter, it was really bad even with a flat bed. Very dark roast smells unpleasant as well.

I usually brew with an AeroPress, a South Indian filter, and a C3S grinder.

Anyone else had this same issue ? 

Historically Noma Projects customer service has been outstanding, in my experience. I am an original Taste Buds member and can speak to how fast they always responded to any questions. But now their customer service appears to be non existent.

Yikes.)  i.e. swatting their butt or pushing their nose in soiled carpet. So as I moved out to lived on my own as soon as I could have. I now choose to walk a life of peace and non violence to others. I'm slowly building my own family with my soon to be fianc√©. We got a dog together and swore we would never hit him cause we were ashamed of how both our families handled pets. He's a little 7lb Chihuahua and is nervous all the time cause the family we rescued him regularly hit him and shocked him with a collar. I've had him for 2 years now and he is my best friend. So let me explain the situation. I just woke up today nice and early even though it's my day off. It was just payday so I was a bit giddy and ready to spoil myself. I ordered McDonald's breakfast cause I haven't had it in a while and I'm 420 friendly so to celebrate this vibey morning I hit the ol benji. I ordered me and my girl some food and I was super excited to have some grub and watch YouTube shows. Food arrives and I'm ready to feast. I left some food on the coffee table and my fianc√© had went to bed because she stay up late last night. So I took her food and put it away so she may have it later. After my trip back from the kitchen I found my dog had knocked down my breakfast sandwich down and had been going to town on it. It honestly was a funny sight thinking back on it. But in the moment I was seeing red. I yelled his name and separated him from the food and placed him in a kennel that we only use when we aren't home and can find nobody to watch him. Other than that the door is left open so he can come and leave as he pleases. I've been fuming ever since and highly disappointed I have to miss out on breakfast and my dogs new behavior. I don't wanna be violent but that's how my parents corrected behavior back then. While I'm staying true to my promise, I wanna correct this misbehavior and discourage it from happening in the future. So I apologize for my ignorance but how can I go about that with out violence and shock collars. I'm not willing to train them that way. History of the behavior: He actually stole a fry one day like months ago but instead of being mad everyone in the room laughed at him and said "" I too am a gremlin for French fries"". Which mightve encouraged it. Idk.

Hope you guys find it useful. We came to Kathmandu on 03.09 and our return flight was 17.09, so exactly two weeks in Nepal. We knew the timeframe was tight, but decided to give it a go.¬†

**Transportation**

Download the InDrive app and register; it works like Uber and is the best way to get around Kathmandu. Keep in mind you must pay the driver in cash after the ride.

As for EBC, Jeep was our go-to option as we wanted to save money. But it is also more sturdy, as the flights are highly unreliable at this time of year. When finishing EBC, there were no flights for 3 days, and then for at least another 2 days after. So people were stuck for at least 5 days; I have no idea when the flights were resumed. The Jeep journey takes 2 full days, but unless there is a massive problem with the road, you will most likely arrive as planned.¬†

Jeep

Most important! Unless you are a very small and thin person, and really want to save some money, I highly recommend you buy an extra seat. By default, they seat 4 people in one row (same width as the back row of an average 5-seater city car). So when you travel in 2ppl, buy 3 seats; for 3ppl buy 4 seats. Ask for this when you buy tickets or when arranging the ride; it makes a HUGE difference in comfort.¬†

When you arrive at your hotel in Kathmandu, ask the front desk for a jeep to Salleri. Online, you can read about a highway being constructed, but I think it is not true. The road to Salleri was flooded a few months ago, and is an asphalt and dirt road. They told us it takes 8-9 hours to reach Salleri, but in reality, it was \~13 hours both times. Departure is around 5 AM. There are stops for food, so no need to bring your own. You will arrive in Surke around 6 PM, and the driver should drop you at his friend‚Äôs guesthouse, but you can request to be dropped off at a different one. The normal price for this ride is 2000 NPR, but our Kathmandu hotel charged 3000 NPR with hotel pickup. You need to sleep in Salleri and the next day take another 4x4 jeep to Surke, where you can start your trek.¬†

The driver from Kathmandu should ask you if you need transport to Surke for the next day, and the same with the guesthouse owner. I think it doesn‚Äôt matter which one you choose. The normal price is 3000 NPR for the Surke jeep. At the beginning, we were told this journey was 4-5 hours, but ended up being \~11 hours. You start around 7 AM and arrive at Surke at dusk. Sleep in Surke and start your trek the next day.¬†

Keep in mind, the road to Surke is a real off-road; it was destroyed by the river, and we had to literally jump with backpacks on the remains of some pipes to the other side of the road and swap jeeps. It was a big river, so honestly, it was dangerous. Then our driver refused to drive further (many other jeeps passed us later), and we had to walk 3 hours to Surke at night in heavy rain. Coming back after finishing EBC, there were two human-sized rocks in the middle of the road; fortunately, the drivers were able to put them aside with hydraulic car lifters. So I guess if you are afraid of the flight being dangerous, jeep is not the best alternative.¬†

For larger groups:

The first jeep has 9 seats (1 front seat and two rows of 4 seats). Realistically, if you want to sit semi-comfortably, it can fit 7 ppl.

The second jeep has 6 seats (2 front and 4 back). In reality, it can fit 1 person in front and 3 in the back, so 4 in total.

Flight

You can fly to Lukla from Kathmandu (or more likely from Manthali, a few hours' drive away). The price is fixed at 222/225 USD for all airlines. In the off-season, you can buy the tickets on departure day.

**Weather**¬†

We read online that the monsoon should be ending at this time, but unfortunately, it started a bit later than usual and thus lasted for our whole trip. All in all, the weather was not a disaster, but it was getting worse instead of better. At the beginning, there was sun and we saw some 8k peaks, later there was usually fog and clouds. Even if the sky above you cleared, the peaks were covered with clouds and not visible at all. Except for the first day, there was no heavy rain between 8/9 AM and 1/2 PM, but every other day there was some light rain. I believe this is a price you have to consider paying for having very few people on the trail.¬†

**Money**¬†

You definitely need to bring enough cash to the trail, many hotels had stickers ‚Äúcards accepted‚Äù but I asked 3 of them and all said there are some problems and accept only cash. I was used to withdrawing money from ATMs with a Revolut card, but in Kathmandu, all ATMs have an access fee of 500 NPR, and you can withdraw a maximum 25 000 NPR (some have a higher limit, but the access fee is also higher). So I guess it is better to take USD and exchange it in Kathmandu. We took out 125,000 NPR for two ppl, and carried an extra 100 USD each just in case. We also needed 30 USD for a visa on arrival.

We paid by card for two dinners and our 1st night in Kathmandu, the rest was cash.

62,000 NPR per person was enough for transport, accommodation, food, souvenirs, permits, and a SIM card.¬†

It was one of our most affordable trips, 420 euros per person for two weeks. We got a good deal on flights from Vienna for 430 euros both ways, so the total cost, including a 30 USD visa and 100 euro insurance, was less than 1000 euros.

During the trek, we spend from 2200 to 3750 NPR per person per day; the higher you go, the more expensive it gets. This includes accommodation, breakfast, dinner, tea pots, and some hot showers. Keep in mind, after Dingboche we didn‚Äôt take hot showers, didn‚Äôt buy phone charges, nor wifi‚Äôs. Two 20k power banks were enough to charge the camera, watch, and two phones. If you want to take a shower in Lobuche, it will be around 1000 NPR, same with wifi.¬†

**People**¬†

Nepalese are the kindest people on earth, always ready to help you. Complete opposite of what we experienced in India. There were no scammers (except one taxi driver in Kathmandu who tried to convince us he was our InDrive), and you could really see that these people have your best interest at heart. We were never pushed to buy or pay extra for anything; at every lodge, they wrote down all our expenses and let us check before paying. We had soaked clothes, a lovely host couple fired a coal heater, and dried our jackets with us. If you have any problem, you can always ask, and if possible, they will help you. In Nepal, we felt more welcome than anywhere else in the world.

**Food/water**

During the trek, there is no problem with food; it is tasty, fresh, and reasonably priced. We stuck to vegetarian food as a safer option for the stomach. The best value is Dal Bhat, which is unlimited to a reasonable extent. I can eat huge portions and am always full after ordering Dal Bhat. It is also the most balanced, as you have carbohydrates from rice, proteins from dal, and vitamins+iron from spinach.

From Europe, we took 1kg of peanut butter as it is very calorie-dense, a lot of good fats, and some proteins. It was a good addition to the morning porridge. Electrolytes and powdered isotonic drinks also came in handy as we drank \~5 liters of water daily. We had two dehydrated spaghetti meals from Decathlon in case of stomach problems (ate in Gorak), some gummy bears, and cereal bars.¬†

We filtered water from a soft flask into a Nalgene, and it worked great, very efficient, and lightweight. There are many taps outside along the way. If you fill your Nalgene, you should have enough water to find the next one. In Gorak, it is advised to drink boiled or bottled water, as there is only glacier water available. This was the only time we bought water.

**Guides/Porters**¬†

If you just want to do EBC and Kala Patthar, there is no reason to get a guide. The road was super simple; if there are no signs, just choose the biggest path. Download the¬†[Mapy.com](http://mapy.com/)¬†app, sign up for free, download offline Nepal maps, and you're good to go.

As for porters, it might make sense to hire one if you have some doubts about your fitness, but if you can pack light, you should be good on your own.

We went solo, and it was a great decision. The only time we hesitated was right before base camp. There was a melting glacier, and the path was falling down the slope. We needed to walk on rocks, and some were quite unstable, so returning, we waited for the Chinese girls with the guide to pass us and walked after them.¬†

**Equipment**¬†

We divided the equipment according to our own weight. My backpack with full food, shoes, and jackets was around 15kg, and my gf was 10kg. Closer to the top, we wore heavier clothes and ate the food, so my bag was \~10kg and my gf was \~7kg. The sleeping bags we used were only once, and honestly, they were not necessary. In the off-season, they have many empty rooms and can give you a second duvet. I read many times that high sturdy shoes are a must. I chose my trail running shoes (250g both) over the Lowa explorer (1200g both), and it was a great choice. In the conditions we were trekking in, there was zero need to bring heavy shoes. I also didn‚Äôt take microspikes as there was no snow anywhere on the trail.

Stuff for trekking:

* 1 main backpack (60+10L for me and 45+10L for my gf)
* 1 down sleeping bag, 0 degrees Celsius comfort¬†
* 1 Merrell Moab Low GTX shoes
* 1 evadict trail running shoes¬†
* 1 flip flops
* 1 hiking poles
* 1 Gore-Tex jacket
* 1 insulted jacket
* 1 waterproof pants
* 1 insulted pants
* 2 long-sleeve merino termo
* 1 termo underpants¬†
* 4 boxers¬†
* 5 pairs of socks¬†
* headlight¬†
* Merino beanie, gloves, and neck warmer
* sunglasses, sunscreen
* 1L wide Nalgene bottle
* Simond soft flask water filter
* plastic spoon

**Itinerary and accommodation**¬†

Day 1¬†

Arrive in Kathmandu, withdraw or exchange NPR, arrange a jeep, and check out the biggest attractions

Day 2¬†

Kathmandu -> Salleri

\~13-hour drive by jeep

Slept in Numbur guesthouse, I recommend staying here, they have new rooms with private bathroom and hot shower - later there won‚Äôt be such luxuries. We paid 1000 NPR for a room.

Day 3

Salleri -> Surke

\~11-hour drive by 4x4

Namaste Lodge was recommended twice by local people along the way, but it was closed at the time.

Day 4

Surke -> Namche

Because the drive from Salleri to Surke took a whole day, we needed to catch up to the plan and decided to go straight to Namche, as the altitude is not a problem. If you are reasonably fit without a heavy backpack, you will make it work. We started at 8 AM and reached Namche 10 hours later. Stayed in Alpine lodge, it was fine but nothing special. It was the last place with free WIFI and charging, the shower was 500NPR. The room was free if you ordered food.

Day 5

Aclimatisation day

Short hike to Khunde and Hotel Everest View

Day 6

Namche -> Tengboche

After 2/3 of the way, you will face a steep ascent. We stayed in the Himalayan Hotel, and the food was good but a little pricy. Accommodation was below average. You can pay for a hot shower; cold water is free.

Day 7

Tengboche -> Dingboche

On this day, you will see a landscape changing; there will be more rocks and less forest. We had the best stay here in Green Tara Lodge. My Google Maps review: ""This was the best place we stayed during the EBC trek, and considering the altitude, it is amazing how good you feel in here. Prices are very affordable (cheaper than in Tengboche) and the food was the best we had on the whole trek (delicious momos, same for dal bhat). Instead of many business hotels you see on the trail, the Green Tara host is the kindest person. We were greeted with hot tea/coffee and had the cleanest room during the trek with a private squat toilet. There is also a hot shower in a nice glass cabin for a very reasonable price. From the room, you exit directly to the green patio with a mountain view instead of smelly and dark hotel halls. Very authentic place with a wonderful owner. Highly recommend, you won‚Äôt find a better place in Dingboche.""

Day 8

Dingboche -> Lobuche

Unfortunately, we had no choice but to skip the second acclimatisation day. We felt very well at Dingboche and decided to push on; it was a good decision, although in Lobuche we felt the altitude for the first time. I suppose the extra day in Dingboche would prevent that, so I highly recommend you do this. Stayed in Hotel Peak 15, it was nice, but we knew the host from the Jeep drive and got the best room plus freebies; others might not get such good treatment.

Day 9

Lobuche -> Gorak Shep -> EBC -> Gorak

This day was harder than expected; I had some fatigue and a light headache when returning from EBC. I believe it was half altitude and half tiredness, as the path from Gorak to EBC took us much longer than we expected. Highly recommend you go up to the tents, and the rock is not very impressive. There might be no visible path, so look for Yak shit and follow it. In Gorak, we slept at Buddha Lodge. It was fine considering the altitude.

Day 10

Gorak -> Dingboche

Day 11

Dingboche -> Namche

Day 12

Namche -> Surke

Day 13

Surke -> Salleri by 4x4

Day 14

Salleri -> Kathmandu by Jeep

Day 15

Flight back from Kathmandu

I‚Äôve been learning a lot from this community, so I figured it‚Äôs time I give something back. I wanted to share how I went from literally zero to building 6 Amazon Affiliate websites, each making anywhere from $1,000 to $3,000 USD per month.

And here‚Äôs the cool part! Each site can usually be sold for around 30x its monthly profit.  
For example, I once sold one for $77,000 after 18 months when it was making $3,000/month.

I‚Äôll try to keep things as short as possible, but there‚Äôs a lot that goes into it so grab a coffee and hang tight while I break down exactly how I did it.

Build a high-quality niche website that:

* Attracts traffic organically
* Helps readers find genuinely useful info
* Recommends great products
* Earns passive income through the Amazon Associates program

That‚Äôs it. Simple concept but not-so-simple execution.

* Products that exist on Amazon with reviews and ratings
* Keywords with modifiers like best, review, comparison, vs, etc.
* Topics where I can realistically compete after doing a competition analysis

Basically: if people are searching for it and buying it, and I can create better content, it‚Äôs worth exploring

**2. Keyword Research**

Now it‚Äôs time to find those money terms.

Here‚Äôs what I do:

* Collect keywords with modifiers (best, reviews, comparison, vs)
* Check their U.S. search volume (I target 500+ monthly)
* Analyze competition with Ahrefs
* Create outlines that hit search intent + convert (mine average over 50% CTR to Amazon)
* Group them into categories

This step literally builds your entire content roadmap.

**3. Link Building Plan (Skyscraper Shotgun Style)**

Find high-backlink articles in your niche, write something way better, reach out to everyone linking to them.

That‚Äôs it. It‚Äôs simple, but it works.

We get around 5% conversion on outreach so for every 1,000 emails, we land \~50 solid white-hat backlinks.

**4. Site Planning**

Once keyword research + link plan are ready, I map everything out.

The mind map includes:

* 2‚Äì4 main content categories
* ‚ÄúMoney‚Äù keywords for each
* A list of content ideas + backlink targets

Think of it like your battle plan before the SEO war begins.

**5. Content Strategy Outsourcing**

Create outlines that actually fulfill user intent.  
People don‚Äôt want fluff ‚Äî they want answers fast.

I used to hire freelancers on Upwork, but now I‚Äôve got my own small team of writers who handle all 6 sites (and some client work too).

Pro tip: treat your writers well. If you find good ones, hold onto them. They‚Äôre gold.

**6. Website Setup**

I keep it simple:

* Platform: WordPress
* Theme: Astra
* Builder: Elementor Pro (used to use Thrive, wouldn‚Äôt recommend it anymore)

Add the essentials:

* Homepage
* About Us
* Privacy Policy
* Cookies Disclaimer
* Amazon Affiliate Disclaimer (required!)

And most importantly: focus on on-site SEO.  
Internal linking, readability, keyword placement, don‚Äôt gloss over this.

**7. Actually Building Links**

This is the grind. We run the Skyscraper Shotgun method consistently, and it delivers.

It‚Äôs repetitive, but those backlinks are what push your content to the top 3 spots.

**8. Stay Consistent**

This is where people fall off.

You can‚Äôt just set and forget affiliate sites. Keep adding content, building links, and refreshing existing articles. Google loves active, growing sites.

Consistency is honestly the biggest secret.

**9. Exit or Keep Scaling**

Once a site is making stable monthly income, you‚Äôve got two options:

* Sell it (usually 25x‚Äì30x monthly profit)
* Keep growing it

Personally, I‚Äôm aiming to push each site to $3K/month before I sell.  
I also keep adding new sites to my portfolio.

**What I Learned**

Getting here took me years of testing, learning, failing, and trying again.

I‚Äôm still learning but if you‚Äôre thinking of starting your first site or investing in a long-term online business, this model is one of the best out there.

It‚Äôs not easy. But it‚Äôs absolutely worth it.

If you‚Äôre curious about any part of this such as keyword research, link building, outsourcing, monetization, whatever, ask me anything!

**ASK ME ANYTHING! AMA**

1o92zt6,https://www.reddit.com/r/toddlers/comments/1o92zt6/missed_my_3_yearolds_classroom_visit_and_spiraling/,Missed my 3 year-old's classroom visit and spiraling,"I need help not feeling like a failure. This morning was my daughter's class's ""classroom visit"" where the parents are supposed to come into the classroom for a half hour to meet the teacher again and hear about the curriculum. I completely forgot about it and when my husband dropped my daughter off this morning he was completely clueless because I hadn't put it in our shared Google calendar and he couldn't stay because he had an important meeting. My daughter was the only one who didn't have a parent there. 

I feel like the worst mother in the world. It's a new school and she's not really used to the classroom yet and I just screwed up. She's an amazing kid and the fact that she's an exhausting three year old isn't her fault--it's just how three year olds are. But the whining drives me insane, the messes drive me insane, the refusing to eat, the refusing to brush her teeth, the potty training setbacks etc etc. I never ever lose my temper with her, but it comes out in other ways--mostly in the form of me beating myself up for my failures.

The situation in our home is becoming unsustainable for me, and this morning felt like the last straw. My husband and I both work full time. Three months ago he started at a really high-pressure, in person job, and I work remotely. Since he started his new job I have taken on 100 percent of the domestic duties with the exception of morning drop off, which he does. I do school pickup, coordinate childcare for days when school is closed, I cook every meal, I do all of the cleaning, I do dinner, bath time, and bedtime every single night by myself. I keep the calendar and I do all of the emotional labor of raising a spirited three year old. 

I *also* work 50 hours a week at a full time (more than full time) job. (I used to have a pretty high-status job that I was good at, and I made a lot more than my husband, but I got laid off last year. Since then I feel less like I do a Career and more like I do a Job, but that's it's own story, I guess.) 

The obvious thing to do would be to work less, but my husband's job doesn't pay enough for me to work less. To add to that, his job is also so new and so inflexible that he doesn't feel like he can cut any corners without getting fired. We are so, so, so crunched. I was making it work on massive amounts of coffee (and yes, prescription stimulants) but this morning I failed. I screwed up and I'm beating myself up for it so much. 

I know that I need to be less hard on myself and I'm working on that. But I can't help but feel like if I worked harder, if I were a little better, if I didn't have vices (the most notable among them being that I have a beer after work most days and I usually do it while I'm cooking dinner with my kid and I feel so so so guilty about that, but it's a small pleasure that I don't really want to give up), if I were more organized, if I didn't have ADD, if I were a little smarter, that I could do this. But it's just feeling impossible. I don't know what I'm asking for other than maybe just...solidarity? Reassurance? To just take a deep breath maybe.

( i need every seconds detail ?? that what- what you have thought and done on every single second )



can you tell me every single detail of your \`1 cheapest Minute Or your whole hour, day, week, month, year or your whole life ??



if you are not able to tell me about this life then what proof do you have that you didn't forget your past ? and that you will not forget this present life in the future ?



that is Fact that Supreme Lord Krishna exists but we posses no such intelligence to understand him.

there is also next life. and i already proved you that no scientist, no politician, no so-called intelligent man in this world is able to understand this Truth. cuz they are imagining. and you cannot imagine what is god, who is god, what is after life etc.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

for example :Your father existed before your birth. you cannot say that before your birth your father don,t exists.



So you have to ask from mother, ""Who is my father?"" And if she says, ""This gentleman is your father,"" then it is all right. It is easy.

Otherwise, if you makes research, ""Who is my father?"" go on searching for life; you'll never find your father.



( now maybe...maybe you will say that i will search my father from D.N.A, or i will prove it by photo's, or many other thing's which i will get from my mother and prove it that who is my Real father.{ So you have to believe the authority. who is that authority ? she is your mother. you cannot claim of any photo's, D.N.A or many other things without authority ( or ur mother ).



if you will show D.N.A, photo's, and many other proofs from other women then your mother. then what is use of those proofs ??} )



same you have to follow real authority. ""Whatever You have spoken, I accept it,"" Then there is no difficulty. And You are accepted by Devala, Narada, Vyasa, and You are speaking Yourself, and later on, all the acaryas have accepted. Then I'll follow.

I'll have to follow great personalities. The same reason mother says, this gentleman is my father. That's all. Finish business. Where is the necessity of making research? All authorities accept Krsna, the Supreme Personality of Godhead. You accept it; then your searching after God is finished.



Why should you waste your time?

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

all that is you need is to hear from authority ( same like mother ). and i heard this truth from authority "" Srila Prabhupada "" he is my spiritual master.

im not talking these all things from my own.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_



in this world no \`1 can be Peace full. this is all along Fact.



cuz we all are suffering in this world 4 Problems which are Disease, Old age, Death, and Birth after Birth.



tell me are you really happy ?? you can,t be happy if you will ignore these 4 main problem. then still you will be Forced by Nature.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_



if you really want to be happy then follow these 6 Things which are No illicit s.ex, No g.ambling, No d.rugs ( No tea & coffee ), No meat-eating ( No onion & garlic's )



5th thing is whatever you eat \`1st offer it to Supreme Lord Krishna. ( if you know it what is Guru parama-para then offer them food not direct Supreme Lord Krishna )



and 6th "" Main Thing "" is you have to Chant "" hare krishna hare krishna krishna krishna hare hare hare rama hare rama rama rama hare hare "".

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

If your not able to follow these 4 things no illicit s.ex, no g.ambling, no d.rugs, no meat-eating then don,t worry but chanting of this holy name ( Hare Krishna Maha-Mantra ) is very-very and very important.



Chant "" hare krishna hare krishna krishna krishna hare hare hare rama hare rama rama rama hare hare "" and be happy.



if you still don,t believe on me then chant any other name for 5 Min's and chant this holy name for 5 Min's and you will see effect. i promise you it works And chanting at least 16 rounds ( each round of 108 beads ) of the Hare Krishna maha-mantra daily.

1o92vdu,https://www.reddit.com/r/NevilleGoddard/comments/1o92vdu/how_i_manifested_my_moms_freedom_from_debt_and_an/,How I Manifested My Mom‚Äôs Freedom from Debt and an Apartment for Myself!,"**Hello everyone,**

I wanted to share with you my two biggest manifestation success stories.  
My success came not only from studying Neville Goddard‚Äôs teachings but also from learning from other manifestation teachers.

I‚Äôll start with the smaller success story.  
For a long time, my fianc√© and I had been looking for a bigger apartment, closer to work. It was already hard enough for us as a couple, but when our child was born, our chances dropped even further. Landlords would openly tell us that their property was for couples *without children.* Our current apartment was falling apart and badly needed renovation, so we didn‚Äôt want‚Äîand couldn‚Äôt afford‚Äîto stay there.

We went to see one apartment that seemed perfect for us: ground floor, spacious, three bedrooms, a terrace, surrounded by greenery, and only a 3-minute walk from the nursery, kindergarten, and elementary school. The price was also reasonable. My fianc√© fell in love with it right away, and we submitted all the required documents. Because rental apartments get taken so quickly, we really hoped that this time it would finally work out. It was during the holiday season, so the waiting time for a decision was even longer.

I wanted to live there, but I also kept thinking, *if it doesn‚Äôt work out, that‚Äôs fine too.* I didn‚Äôt feel the need to do any manifestation techniques. The only thing I did was imagine, throughout the day‚Äîwhile watching TV or playing with my child‚Äîhow I would decorate that apartment. In my mind, with my eyes open, I walked through it and planned where everything would go, what I still needed to make it look the way I wanted. I did it naturally, without stress or even strong excitement.

The final decision was supposed to come by the end of the first week after New Year‚Äôs. The week passed, and on Friday morning my fianc√© got up and said around 10 a.m. that he thought it wasn‚Äôt going to happen, since we‚Äôd been waiting so long with no news. I didn‚Äôt react to his negativity or take on his emotions. I just told him to calm down‚Äîit wasn‚Äôt the end of the day yet.

He went to work, and around 3 p.m. he called me, super excited, saying that they had just called him and *we got the apartment!* I didn‚Äôt jump for joy or cry from happiness‚ÄîI just smiled, because of course we got it. I had already *been there,* decorating it in my mind. And who decorates an apartment? The person who *lives* there!

I think the key was that I mentally walked through *that exact apartment,* not my old one or some random one. After that, I promised myself that I would never doubt myself again and that I would trust myself completely.



The second story actually happened before the first one, but it‚Äôs far more spectacular.

I knew that my mom had taken out loans and credit cards long ago and had trouble paying them back, but I thought it was all somewhat under control. Everyone in our family had minor or major financial problems, and shame kept us from talking honestly about it. Everyone knew *something,* but no one knew *everything*‚Äîhow much, from whom, or why.

**November 2021**  
My mom finally told me that she was facing serious consequences because of her massive debt and inability to pay it off. That‚Äôs when I learned the full scale of the problem‚Äîand it was huge. My mom was in debt for the value of an entire apartment! I won‚Äôt tell you the exact amount because it‚Äôs in my country‚Äôs currency, and converting it 1:1 into dollars doesn‚Äôt make sense, but let‚Äôs just say‚Äîit was enough to *buy a small apartment.* Yes, you read that right‚Äî*buy an apartment!*

I was shocked. I cried and said terrible things to my mom. I was terrified for her and the rest of the family, who might end up burdened by her debts. My mom was sick and couldn‚Äôt work anymore. I didn‚Äôt know what to do. For days I wandered around numb, unable to sleep. I couldn‚Äôt see any way out. Neither I nor my siblings had any money to help. My mom was facing bankruptcy‚Äîand worse, possible homelessness in her old age.

She started working with a free legal aid lawyer to at least keep her apartment so she‚Äôd have somewhere to live. Selling it wouldn‚Äôt have helped‚Äîhalf belonged to my father, who‚Äôd been evicted years earlier. Even selling her share wouldn‚Äôt cover half the debt. The entire apartment was worth less than her total debt.

After a long time in despair, I decided to do something‚Äîand turn to manifestation. In my 3D reality, there was no way out. It was hard, because while I kept affirming that my mom was debt-free, I also couldn‚Äôt stop worrying. It was a loop of crying, affirming, chest pain from fear, and visualization.

By 2021, I‚Äôd already known about manifestation for a few years, but I didn‚Äôt really *understand* it deeply yet. I‚Äôd only had very small successes (seriously small‚Äîsmaller than manifesting a cup of coffee). So I kept searching for ways, reading Neville Goddard and others, trying out different teachers‚Äô methods. I did a bit of everything to improve my practice.

What finally worked here was visualization. During the day, when I had a moment to myself, I‚Äôd sit comfortably, slow my breathing, and relax my body. My visualization scene was simple: I was writing a Reddit post about my success story‚Äîhow my mom‚Äôs debt had been canceled and she was living peacefully in her home. I saw myself sitting in front of the computer, happy and calm.

I didn‚Äôt know *how* it would happen, so I decided that scene would be enough. And surprise, surprise‚Äîhere I am now, writing that very success story! I don‚Äôt even know when I stopped visualizing‚Äîit just felt complete, so I let it go.

**June 2023**  
As you can see, some time had passed since the problem began. Maybe if I had visualized longer, it would have happened sooner. My mom messaged me and sent a photo of a court document‚Äîher **entire debt had been canceled.** She didn‚Äôt have to pay a single cent. She only attended court hearings because the banks were chasing her, and she worked with that free lawyer‚Äîand that was it!

I didn‚Äôt do *anything* in 3D. I didn‚Äôt pay, didn‚Äôt seek financial help, didn‚Äôt take any action. The only action I took was internal‚Äîclosing my eyes and moving to the good ending *within myself.* The court wiped out hundreds of thousands in debt. My mom is free‚Äîcompletely free of debt and payments.

It‚Äôs such an incredible story because I knew how these cases usually end: the bailiff seizes the property, auctions it off, and the people end up homeless.

I‚Äôm not a master writer or storyteller, but I hope my stories bring you hope and courage to pursue *everything* you want.

1o92ukb,https://www.reddit.com/r/sleep/comments/1o92ukb/sleeping_issues_since_birth_getting_worse/,"Sleeping Issues since birth, getting worse","Hello,

I‚Äôm going to try & give everyone as much information as possible, so bare with me if it‚Äôs a long post, sorry in advance. 

Since I was born, I‚Äôve had sleeping issues which my parents always found really hard to manage since I would never want to sleep. I wouldn‚Äôt take naps & would take a very long time to fall asleep at night, which resulted in me moving a lot in bed. 

Up until half way through middle school, it was always mainly trouble falling asleep. 

From halfway through middle school to end of cegep, it was both trouble falling sleep & waking up. 

Now, since starting University, for about 3 years, it‚Äôs been even worse! Trouble falling asleep, trouble staying asleep (I wake up more than 3 times a night, my maximum was 10 times, sometimes only a few seconds & then I fall back asleep, other times to go to the bathroom, other times bcs of intensive dreams, & I sometimes wake up & it takes me a while to fall back asleep), & waking up. 

I always get 8hrs+ sleep every night, but since I wake up a lot during my sleep, it‚Äôs just broken sleep rem, so it‚Äôs not really 8 hours+ anymore. 


For more info;
- yes I have a doctor, he‚Äôs been trying to help, but isn‚Äôt the best.
- I‚Äôve tried 4 different sleeping pills, none of them work, they help me feel sleepy so I fall asleep a bit quicker, but I still wake up during the night, & they all made me feel very groggy in the morning. 
- I do take birth control, for 4 years now
- I take anxiety meds
- I take iron supplements
- I take b12 supplements
(All pills are prescribed by my doctor)
- I work out 3x/week
- I try my best to drink 2L of water every day
- I have a good diet, but I do have a lot of stomach issues which my doctor hasn‚Äôt helped much with, says it‚Äôs anxiety, but I know it‚Äôs not, I know what anxiety stomach pains feel like, & it‚Äôs not this. 
- I‚Äôm diagnosed with AuDHD, dyslexia, PTSD & anxiety
- I sleep in a very comfy bed, no heavy blankets or covers, completely blacked out (I even wear an eye mask), no noise (I can‚Äôt sleep with noise, even white noise), it tends to be a bit colder during the night bcs I‚Äôm in the basement but I do have a small heater for my room.
- I try my best to sleep at the same time every night, & wake up at the same time everyday
- waking up earlier than 10am, is extremely difficult for me, & I don‚Äôt get tired until 9:30-10pm at night. 
- I do not drink coffee
- I do not drink alcohol 
- I do not smoke
- I do not take drugs (other than my prescribed pills)
- I don‚Äôt take naps (unless I‚Äôm sick)
- I have done test around my stomach & other private areas to see if it was related to a cyst or other, but everything came back normal, even did some blood tests which is how we found I had lower b12 & iron, but I take supplements now.
- my doctor doesn‚Äôt want me to do any sleeping test bcs he says it‚Äôs not sleep apnea
- I dream every night, sometimes wake up from scary or stressful dreams but I fall back asleep after once realizing it was just a dream
- I have a therapist which I have spoken to her abt my sleep issues, I do what she suggests; if I cannot fall asleep after 20-30mins of waking up from sleep or trying to fall asleep in general, I move to another room & meditate or read a book. I don‚Äôt look at electronics 30mins-1hr before falling asleep, I did some yoga & meditation(I tried for 8 months), & none of these have helped me. 

I can‚Äôt think of anything else. I guess what I‚Äôm trying to find from you guys is seeing if maybe there‚Äôs something that you guys see that neither I or my doctor seeÔºü I might want to try to stop taking my birth controls since I read it can affect your sleep a lot. But apart from that‚Ä¶ I‚Äôm really lost on what to do‚Ä¶ ",2,1760711365.0,sleep,1,1.0,False

You google ‚Äúbest paper writing service‚Äù hoping for salvation‚Ä¶ and land in a jungle of suspiciously perfect reviews and websites that all swear¬†*they‚Äôre*¬†the ‚Äútop rated essay writing service.‚Äù

Been there. Cried there. Ordered there.

So today I‚Äôm giving you a no-BS, Reddit-style comparison post ‚Äî focusing on **writingserviceforme** (which I actually tried) and how it stacks up against a few other top rated essay writing services that Redditors often mention.

Let‚Äôs see which one deserves the best writing service badge and which one belongs in the academic graveyard.

# ‚öôÔ∏è First Impressions: Design, Usability & Ordering

|Service|Site Design|Ordering Process|Transparency|
|:-|:-|:-|:-|
|**WritingServiceForMe**|Clean, minimal, not screaming ‚Äúessay mill.‚Äù|Super quick form ‚Äî topic, level, deadline, boom.|Writer selection after payment, but profiles shown.|
|**SpeedyPaper**|Feels professional but a bit salesy.|Easy navigation; lots of upsells.|Prices shown upfront.|
|**EssayMarket**|Old-school layout; functional but meh.|Simple but lacks writer detail.|Minimal transparency.|

Honestly,¬†**writingserviceforme**¬†surprised me ‚Äî it didn‚Äôt look like a scam ad from 2010. It‚Äôs clean, straight to the point, and doesn‚Äôt bombard you with ‚Äú50% OFF‚Äù popups every two seconds.

# üïí Delivery & Speed

I ordered a 5-page sociology paper, standard college level, due in 3 days.

* **WritingServiceForMe**: Delivered 5 hours early (a miracle compared to my usual all-nighter).
* **SpeedyPaper**: Delivered exactly on time.
* **EssayMarket**: Barely made the deadline ‚Äî stress level = espresso shot.

So far, WritingServiceForMe earns major points here. If ‚Äúon-time delivery‚Äù were a GPA, they‚Äôd have a solid 4.0.

# ‚úçÔ∏è Quality of Writing

I ran my paper through Grammarly, Turnitin, and, well, my skeptical brain. Here‚Äôs the result:

|Service|Grammar|Structure|Voice / Flow|Sources|
|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|
|**WritingServiceForMe**|Minor grammar issues (fixable).|Logical, well-structured.|Slightly formal but readable|Real academic sources (JSTOR, Google Scholar)|
|**SpeedyPaper**|Almost flawless grammar|Very polished|Felt slightly too ‚Äútemplate-y.‚Äù|Mixed sources, mostly fine.|
|**EssayMarket**|Rough around the edges|Weak transitions|Generic tone|A few questionable references.|

**Verdict:**¬†WritingServiceForMe isn‚Äôt perfect, but the content actually made sense. It read like a paper I could‚Äôve written on too little sleep and too much coffee ‚Äî which, honestly, is¬†*ideal*¬†if you want to avoid suspicion.

# üí¨ Communication & Support

Their chat support works 24/7 (allegedly). I tested it at 2 a.m.

* Response time: \~3 minutes.
* Tone: Human, not chatbot.
* Problem-solving: Solid ‚Äî they reassigned a writer after I asked for a different style.

Compared to others, WritingServiceForMe sits in the sweet spot ‚Äî not overly pushy, not ghosting you either.

# üí∏ Price & Value Breakdown

|Service|Price per Page (College Level)|Freebies|Refund / Revision Policy|
|:-|:-|:-|:-|
|**WritingServiceForMe**|\~$13.99|Title page, formatting, revisions.|Full refund if late or off-topic.|
|**SpeedyPaper**|\~$14.50|Formatting, draft requests.|Partial refund policy.|
|**EssayMarket**|\~$11.00|Minimal extras.|No clear refund policy.|

Not the cheapest, but you get what you pay for. The ‚Äúbest paper writing service‚Äù isn‚Äôt necessarily the cheapest one ‚Äî it‚Äôs the one that saves you from rewriting the whole thing at 4 a.m.

# üß† Real Use Case: My Sociology Essay

Topic: ‚ÄúThe Role of Social Media in Political Polarization.‚Äù

I expected generic filler paragraphs. Instead, the writer from WritingServiceForMe cited actual studies and even used a recent Pew Research report. The structure made sense, and it didn‚Äôt sound like ChatGPT in disguise.

Was it A+ level? Probably not. But it was solid B+/A- territory, which is exactly where I want to be ‚Äî believable and plagiarism-free.

# üîç Comparison Summary (Short Version)

|Criteria|WritingServiceForMe|SpeedyPaper|EssayMarket|
|:-|:-|:-|:-|
|**Ease of Ordering**|‚úÖ‚úÖ‚úÖ|‚úÖ‚úÖ|‚úÖ|
|**Delivery Speed**|‚úÖ‚úÖ‚úÖ|‚úÖ‚úÖ|‚úÖ|
|**Writing Quality**|‚úÖ‚úÖ|‚úÖ‚úÖ‚úÖ|‚úÖ|
|**Customer Support**|‚úÖ‚úÖ‚úÖ|‚úÖ‚úÖ|‚ùå|
|**Overall Value**|‚≠ê 9/10|‚≠ê 8.5/10|‚≠ê 6.5/10|

Verdict: WritingServiceForMe isn‚Äôt perfect, but the content actually made sense. It read like a paper I could‚Äôve written on too little sleep and too much coffee ‚Äî which, honestly, is *ideal* if you want to avoid suspicion.

# üí≠ Final Thoughts: The Verdict

So, is WritingServiceForMe the best writing service I‚Äôve ever tried?

Maybe not¬†*the absolute best*, but it‚Äôs definitely one of the most balanced. It doesn‚Äôt overpromise, it actually delivers, and the end result looks authentic enough that your professor won‚Äôt smell AI.

If you‚Äôre comparing top rated essay writing services, here‚Äôs my honest breakdown:

* If you want a polished, near-perfect essay ‚Üí SpeedyPaper.
* If you want affordable, human-sounding work ‚Üí WritingServiceForMe.
* If you like gambling with your GPA ‚Üí EssayMarket (no shade, but‚Ä¶ yeah).

# üß© Bonus: Quick Tips Before Ordering

* Be ultra-specific with instructions. The more details you give, the less editing later.
* Always request revisions if something feels off ‚Äî you‚Äôre paying for it.
* Run a plagiarism check yourself just to be safe.
* Don‚Äôt use these services to cheat ‚Äî use them to learn formatting, structure, and phrasing.

# TL;DR ‚Äî The Student‚Äôs Verdict

* **WritingServiceForMe**¬†= Surprisingly reliable, human-sounding, mid-price gem.
* Great balance of quality, price, and speed.
* Not the absolute best paper writing service on Earth, but definitely one of the top rated essay writing services worth trying if you‚Äôre in a pinch.

And remember: if your paper‚Äôs due in 12 hours, no ‚Äúbest writing service‚Äù can save you ‚Äî but a smart head start might.",1,1760711069.0,homeworkhelpNY,1,1.0,False

‚Ä¢ Share caf√© recommendations and new finds around the city  
‚Ä¢ Talk home brewing (pour-over, espresso, AeroPress, etc.)  
‚Ä¢ Swap bean recs, setups, and roasting tips

1o92ow1,https://www.reddit.com/r/SEO/comments/1o92ow1/6_amazon_affiliate_sites_that_each_make_1k3kmonth/,6 Amazon Affiliate Sites That Each Make $1K‚Äì$3K/Month,"Hey everyone!

I‚Äôve been learning a lot from this community, so I figured it‚Äôs time I give something back. I wanted to share how I went from literally zero to building 6 Amazon Affiliate websites, each making anywhere from $1,000 to $3,000 USD per month.

And here‚Äôs the cool part! Each site can usually be sold for around 30x its monthly profit.  
For example, I once sold one for $77,000 after 18 months when it was making $3,000/month.

I‚Äôll try to keep things as short as possible, but there‚Äôs a lot that goes into it so grab a coffee and hang tight while I break down exactly how I did it.

**The Core Idea**

Build a high-quality niche website that:

* Attracts traffic organically
* Helps readers find genuinely useful info
* Recommends great products
* Earns passive income through the Amazon Associates program

That‚Äôs it. Simple concept but not-so-simple execution.

**1. Niche Selection**

This is the foundation. Get this wrong, and nothing else matters.

What I look for:

* Products that exist on Amazon with reviews and ratings
* Keywords with modifiers like best, review, comparison, vs, etc.
* Topics where I can realistically compete after doing a competition analysis

Basically: if people are searching for it and buying it, and I can create better content, it‚Äôs worth exploring

**2. Keyword Research**

Now it‚Äôs time to find those money terms.

Here‚Äôs what I do:

* Collect keywords with modifiers (best, reviews, comparison, vs)
* Check their U.S. search volume (I target 500+ monthly)
* Analyze competition with Ahrefs
* Create outlines that hit search intent + convert (mine average over 50% CTR to Amazon)
* Group them into categories

This step literally builds your entire content roadmap.

**3. Link Building Plan (Skyscraper Shotgun Style)**

Find high-backlink articles in your niche, write something way better, reach out to everyone linking to them.

That‚Äôs it. It‚Äôs simple, but it works.

We get around 5% conversion on outreach so for every 1,000 emails, we land \~50 solid white-hat backlinks.

**4. Site Planning**

Once keyword research + link plan are ready, I map everything out.

The mind map includes:

* 2‚Äì4 main content categories
* ‚ÄúMoney‚Äù keywords for each
* A list of content ideas + backlink targets

Think of it like your battle plan before the SEO war begins.

**5. Content Strategy  Outsourcing**

Create outlines that actually fulfill user intent.  
People don‚Äôt want fluff ‚Äî they want answers fast.

I used to hire freelancers on Upwork, but now I‚Äôve got my own small team of writers who handle all 6 sites (and some client work too).

Pro tip: treat your writers well. If you find good ones, hold onto them. They‚Äôre gold.

**6. Website Setup**

I keep it simple:

* Platform: WordPress
* Theme: Astra
* Builder: Elementor Pro (used to use Thrive, wouldn‚Äôt recommend it anymore)

Add the essentials:

* Homepage
* About Us
* Privacy Policy
* Cookies Disclaimer
* Amazon Affiliate Disclaimer (required!)

And most importantly: focus on on-site SEO.  
Internal linking, readability, keyword placement, don‚Äôt gloss over this.

**7. Actually Building Links**

This is the grind. We run the Skyscraper Shotgun method consistently, and it delivers.

It‚Äôs repetitive, but those backlinks are what push your content to the top 3 spots.

**8. Stay Consistent**

This is where people fall off.

You can‚Äôt just set and forget affiliate sites. Keep adding content, building links, and refreshing existing articles. Google loves active, growing sites.

Consistency is honestly the biggest secret.

**9. Exit or Keep Scaling**

Once a site is making stable monthly income, you‚Äôve got two options:

* Sell it (usually 25x‚Äì30x monthly profit)
* Keep growing it

Personally, I‚Äôm aiming to push each site to $3K/month before I sell.  
I also keep adding new sites to my portfolio.

**What I Learned**

Getting here took me years of testing, learning, failing, and trying again.

I‚Äôm still learning but if you‚Äôre thinking of starting your first site or investing in a long-term online business, this model is one of the best out there.

It‚Äôs not easy. But it‚Äôs absolutely worth it.

If you‚Äôre curious about any part of this such as keyword research, link building, outsourcing, monetization, whatever, ask me anything!

( i need every seconds detail ?? that what- what you have thought and done on every single second )



can you tell me every single detail of your \`1 cheapest Minute Or your whole hour, day, week, month, year or your whole life ??



if you are not able to tell me about this life then what proof do you have that you didn't forget your past ? and that you will not forget this present life in the future ?



that is Fact that Supreme Lord Krishna exists but we posses no such intelligence to understand him.

there is also next life. and i already proved you that no scientist, no politician, no so-called intelligent man in this world is able to understand this Truth. cuz they are imagining. and you cannot imagine what is god, who is god, what is after life etc.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

for example :Your father existed before your birth. you cannot say that before your birth your father don,t exists.



So you have to ask from mother, ""Who is my father?"" And if she says, ""This gentleman is your father,"" then it is all right. It is easy.

Otherwise, if you makes research, ""Who is my father?"" go on searching for life; you'll never find your father.



( now maybe...maybe you will say that i will search my father from D.N.A, or i will prove it by photo's, or many other thing's which i will get from my mother and prove it that who is my Real father.{ So you have to believe the authority. who is that authority ? she is your mother. you cannot claim of any photo's, D.N.A or many other things without authority ( or ur mother ).



if you will show D.N.A, photo's, and many other proofs from other women then your mother. then what is use of those proofs ??} )



same you have to follow real authority. ""Whatever You have spoken, I accept it,"" Then there is no difficulty. And You are accepted by Devala, Narada, Vyasa, and You are speaking Yourself, and later on, all the acaryas have accepted. Then I'll follow.

I'll have to follow great personalities. The same reason mother says, this gentleman is my father. That's all. Finish business. Where is the necessity of making research? All authorities accept Krsna, the Supreme Personality of Godhead. You accept it; then your searching after God is finished.



Why should you waste your time?

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

all that is you need is to hear from authority ( same like mother ). and i heard this truth from authority "" Srila Prabhupada "" he is my spiritual master.

im not talking these all things from my own.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_



in this world no \`1 can be Peace full. this is all along Fact.



cuz we all are suffering in this world 4 Problems which are Disease, Old age, Death, and Birth after Birth.



tell me are you really happy ?? you can,t be happy if you will ignore these 4 main problem. then still you will be Forced by Nature.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_



if you really want to be happy then follow these 6 Things which are No illicit s.ex, No g.ambling, No d.rugs ( No tea & coffee ), No meat-eating ( No onion & garlic's )



5th thing is whatever you eat \`1st offer it to Supreme Lord Krishna. ( if you know it what is Guru parama-para then offer them food not direct Supreme Lord Krishna )



and 6th "" Main Thing "" is you have to Chant "" hare krishna hare krishna krishna krishna hare hare hare rama hare rama rama rama hare hare "".

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

If your not able to follow these 4 things no illicit s.ex, no g.ambling, no d.rugs, no meat-eating then don,t worry but chanting of this holy name ( Hare Krishna Maha-Mantra ) is very-very and very important.



Chant "" hare krishna hare krishna krishna krishna hare hare hare rama hare rama rama rama hare hare "" and be happy.



if you still don,t believe on me then chant any other name for 5 Min's and chant this holy name for 5 Min's and you will see effect. i promise you it works And chanting at least 16 rounds ( each round of 108 beads ) of the Hare Krishna maha-mantra daily.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

Here is no Question of Holy Books quotes, Personal Experiences, Faith or Belief. i accept that Sometimes Faith is also Blind. Here is already Practical explanation which already proved that every\`1 else in this world is nothing more then Busy Foolish and totally idiot.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

Source(s):

every \`1 is already Blind in this world and if you will follow another Blind then you both will fall in hole. so try to follow that person who have Spiritual Eyes who can Guide you on Actual Right Path. ( my Authority & Guide is my Spiritual Master "" Srila Prabhupada "" )

I booked myself in first class from Lisbon Oriente to Faro (Algarve) earlier this month. I had one large suitcase with me and I was wearing a small crossbody bag with a zipper- that‚Äôs it, no other hand luggage.   
  
When the train arrived, 15 minutes before departure, I made my way to the first-class carriage. I pushed my suitcase up, a kindly gentleman helped pull it up, I boarded the train and went towards the luggage rack to put the suitcase on it.   
  
A young woman, smartly dressed in a black jacket and longish hair, offered to help me put the suitcase on the rack. I found it strange that she suggested I put it on the top-most rack, when the entire rack was empty. It must have taken 30 seconds or so, the suitcase was on the rack and I went ahead to find my seat. After I sat down, I automatically opened my crossbody bag to check my ticket, and to my shock saw that my wallet was missing. My heart pounded in my chest, I thought I would faint. I checked my seat and asked the couple of people seated near me if they had seen a wallet. Everyone said no.   
  
I ran out of the carriage to see if the wallet could be found on the platform where I had been sitting. No such luck. I ran down to the coffee shop to see if I could have left it there, but no chance. Meanwhile, I ran crazily up again to the platform, thinking the train would leave without me.   
  
Luckily it was delayed for 10 minutes. I went to my seat again, no wallet, I walked back to the luggage rack, and much to my shock, the wallet was lying on top of my suitcase. I opened it frantically and immediately saw that the envelope in which I had put a \*substantial\* amount of money was gone. (I‚Äôm grateful that at least she returned the wallet with my cards etc.)  
  
What a quick job that clever pickpocket did! I made a report at the police station in Faro. There was absolutely no one to help on the train, even though the train hadn‚Äôt left the platform!

1o92l0w,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1o92l0w,Distilling FSCO/FECO/RSO Pre-reduction and cook off,"After your FSCO has been properly filtered you can move on to the next step. The tincture can be filtered multiple times, I usually filter it through unbleached coffee filters 3x. The first filtration is often slow as the filters fill up with fine particulates and lipids. The 2nd and subsequent run much faster. This process can be substantially sped up with the use of a B√ºchner funnel and vacuum pump. If you go this path, a 2.5 cfm pump or smaller is adequate. To begin distilling set up your table top water distiller and make sure you have a mason jar adjusted under the spout correctly. I usually need to elevate the distiller with a few large books under it as a platform to make sure the stream goes directly into the recovery vessel, a 2 quart mason jar. Pour the tincture into the distiller put on the lid and set the distiller to 185F. Alcohol boils and distills at 176F so this should be sufficient. Set up a double boiler on your stove and get the next steps ready as your alcohol distills. I use a Pyrex dish over a large pot of boiling water for my final reduction and cook off. Depending on how much tincture you have and the beginning temperature of the tincture pre-distillation will determine how long the distillation takes, but it can often be accomplished in 20 minutes. Distill and reduce the tincture by 70%-80% to recover the most ethanol. Do not fully distilled the tincture. There needs to be a small amount of alcohol left in the tincture so that it pours out easily from the vessel into the Pyrex dish. If all the alcohol is distilled, or too much, it will make pouring off very difficult and sticky. In turn, there will most likely be lost product as the vessel is scraped clean. Take all distilled alcohol, and put it back into the freezer for storage and future use. Mason jars are very helpful in this process since they have lines and measurements on the sides to help you know how much tincture went into the distiller, how much alcohol was reclaimed, and a general idea of the percentage of tincture that still needs to be reduced in the final stage. In addition, once distilling begins, the alcohol should be pouring out of the distiller in a steady stream. When it slows down or the stream is slightly sporadic, the distillation can be finished and turned off. Always be careful when opening the distiller after using it. The liquid inside was just at 176F+ and may need to cool down before pouring into the Pyrex dish. Alcohol fumes are volatile, flammable, and can cause respiratory issues. Always distiller in a well ventilated area and never around an open flame. Once you have poured the remaining distilled tincture into the Pyrex dish, reduction and cook off can begin. Make sure to clean your distiller with isopropyl to keep it in best working condition and then properly store it for future use. Don‚Äôt run isopropyl through the machine, simply clean the inside and outside and wipe it clean. Picture 1 shows the distiller in action, reclaiming alcohol in the mason jar. On the display you can see it is running at 177F and set to 185F. I believe the brand is called CO-Z. It was purchased off Amazon for approximately $150 USD.

I‚Äôve been mainly looking at the Breville line (the Bambino models & the Barista Express) ‚Äî since it‚Äôs in my budget and not over the top expensive, plus they seem to be pretty popular and user friendly. I‚Äôve read some reviews saying that the built in grinder on the Barista Express sucks and it‚Äôs more worth while to get a Bambino with a separate burr grinder ‚Äî can anyone attest to this? If so, what burr grinder would you recommend? Looking for something that is automatic preferably and user-friendly/easy to use ‚Äî and if I‚Äôm going Bambino, I‚Äôd spend about $150/$200 on a good burr grinder. I do like the idea of the built in grinder on the Express but if the general consensus is that it sucks and isn‚Äôt consistent, I‚Äôd prefer to go the other route with separate machines. Also, just trying to keep things compact as I don‚Äôt have a ton of counter space lol.

I‚Äôm really just looking for a setup to make good espresso and lattes in the mornings for my partner and I, so any recommendations/advice is welcome and appreciated!",1,1760710596.0,espresso,4,0.67,False
1o92idb,https://www.reddit.com/r/estatesales/comments/1o92idb/the_most_unforgettable_estate_sale_ive_ever_been/,The most unforgettable estate sale I‚Äôve ever been to,"A couple of years ago, I saw a handwritten sign for an estate sale while driving through an older neighborhood. I didn‚Äôt have any plans that morning, so I decided to stop by. It was one of those quiet streets where every house looks like it‚Äôs been there forever.

When I got there, the front door was open and there was a little table by the entrance with cookies and coffee. Inside, everything looked like a real home not empty or staged, just lived in. Family photos were still on the walls, books on the shelves, even a half-finished puzzle on the coffee table.

I asked the woman sitting by the door if she was the organizer, and she smiled and said, It‚Äôs my house. I was caught off guard she explained she was hosting her own estate sale because she wanted to personally pass her things on to people who‚Äôd appreciate them. She said, It‚Äôs easier to let go when you see something find a new story.

I walked around for almost an hour, just listening to her tell little memories about each item. The dining table was from her first apartment after getting married. A small painting in the hallway had been a gift from a friend who‚Äôd moved overseas. I ended up buying an old ceramic cat she said had been on her windowsill since the 1970s.

When I left, she thanked me and said, Take care of the cat it‚Äôs seen a lot of sunsets.

It‚Äôs still on my bookshelf today. I think about that day every time I see it.

Has anyone else ever been to an estate sale that felt more like a conversation than a transaction?",53,1760710566.0,estatesales,14,1.0,False
1o92ibf,https://www.reddit.com/r/creepcast/comments/1o92ibf/the_quiet_house/,The Quiet House,"Part I

The house was quiet the morning he woke up.

That was the first thing Thomas noticed ‚Äî not the color of the light, not the sound of wind at the eaves, but the quiet. A thick, almost expectant quiet, as though the air itself was holding its breath. He sat at the edge of the bed, rubbing his eyes, waiting for the hum of the refrigerator, the ticking of the baseboard heater ‚Äî the small domestic noises that made a house feel lived in. But there was nothing.

He told himself it was early. The clocks were all dead, blinking zeroes. The power must‚Äôve gone out overnight. He made a mental note to check the breaker, then laughed softly when he realized how many times he‚Äôd said that in the past year and never actually done it.

The floorboards were cold under his bare feet as he padded toward the kitchen.

Everything was where he‚Äôd left it ‚Äî the chipped coffee mug on the counter, the folded newspaper beside the sink, the faint smell of stale grounds. But there was something off in the way the light came through the window. It wasn‚Äôt golden or gray, just‚Ä¶ pale. Thin, like a reflection of light rather than light itself.

He filled the kettle from the tap and paused. No sound. No rush of water. The stream fell into the kettle, but it was silent.

He frowned, held the kettle up, and tilted it back and forth. The water shimmered, but he could hear nothing.

The silence pressed around him until he felt slightly dizzy.

Then, as if in answer, the distant sound of a car engine passed on the road outside, and he let out a breath he hadn‚Äôt realized he was holding. The world wasn‚Äôt gone. He wasn‚Äôt alone.

He made his coffee, sat at the table, and tried to remember what day it was.

The paper was from March, though he didn‚Äôt recall what day it was now. He hadn‚Äôt been good with dates since the accident.

He didn‚Äôt like thinking about the accident ‚Äî the memory of crushed glass and screeching metal came too easily. So he‚Äôd stopped trying.

Instead, he focused on routine. Coffee, a walk down to the mailbox, maybe a nap in the afternoon. Nights were harder. The nights had grown too long since the clocks stopped.

He‚Äôd lived alone in this house for twenty-seven years, long enough that the walls seemed to know him. He could tell the weather by how they creaked. He knew when the wind would shift by how the curtains moved. It had always felt alive to him ‚Äî a quiet kind of alive, but still alive.

Until recently.

The silence had grown heavier these past few months. The air had felt still, unmoving. Sometimes he‚Äôd wake up in the middle of the night certain he‚Äôd heard voices downstairs, soft and indistinct. But when he went to check, there was nothing.

He told himself it was loneliness. That‚Äôs all. A trick of the mind.

After breakfast, he went to the porch. The morning was cool, or at least it looked cool ‚Äî the air didn‚Äôt quite feel right on his skin, like temperature had become a suggestion.

The gravel drive stretched down to the main road, and beyond it, the line of trees that had always framed his view. It was the same, and yet not. There was no movement. No birds in the trees, no wind in the branches. The world looked painted.

He stood there a long while before retreating inside.

The quiet followed him.

‚∏ª

He didn‚Äôt notice the family‚Äôs arrival right away.

It was the sound that did it ‚Äî voices, laughter, the crunch of tires on gravel. He looked up from his book, startled, and went to the window.

A moving truck had stopped at the end of the drive. A sedan behind it.

For a long moment he didn‚Äôt understand what he was seeing. He felt irritation first ‚Äî a flicker of territorial annoyance. Someone had taken a wrong turn. That was his drive. His house.

He went to the door, opened it, and stepped out.

The air was brighter now, more real than it had been in weeks.

A man climbed out of the truck, young, maybe late thirties. A woman followed from the car, carrying a little girl. They stood together, surveying the house.

Thomas froze.

He wanted to shout, Can I help you? but the words caught in his throat.

Instead, he watched as they approached the porch, chatting quietly. He noticed the man carried a clipboard, papers fluttering. The woman smiled ‚Äî a soft, tentative smile, as though she were trying to see beauty in something half-forgotten.

It was the girl who looked directly at him.

She couldn‚Äôt have been more than five, with a mass of curls and bright, uncertain eyes. She peered up at the porch where Thomas stood ‚Äî her expression shifting for a moment into something that looked like confusion.

Then her mother said something, and she looked away.

Thomas cleared his throat. ‚ÄúExcuse me,‚Äù he began.

No sound.

He frowned, tried again, louder this time. ‚ÄúExcuse me! Can I help you?‚Äù

The woman turned toward the sound of the porch ‚Äî but her eyes slid past him, like he wasn‚Äôt there.

A hollow feeling opened in his chest.

The man was saying something now, pointing at the porch. The movers came up the drive, hauling boxes. Thomas took a step forward, anger rising. ‚ÄúYou can‚Äôt just walk in here!‚Äù he shouted. ‚ÄúThis is my house!‚Äù

But no one stopped.

The movers brushed past him ‚Äî or through him. The sensation made his stomach twist. It was like walking into cold water that went right through his bones.

He stumbled back, gasping.

They didn‚Äôt see him.

They didn‚Äôt see him.

He turned toward the open door, heart pounding ‚Äî or what felt like a heart. His hands trembled as he gripped the frame. He felt the wood. It was solid beneath his fingers, warm from the sun. He wasn‚Äôt‚Ä¶ gone. He couldn‚Äôt be.

He tried again to speak. ‚ÄúGet out!‚Äù

Nothing.

The little girl lingered at the threshold, half-hidden behind her mother‚Äôs legs. She looked up again, and for a moment her eyes met his. Really met his.

She didn‚Äôt move. Didn‚Äôt speak.

Then she said softly, ‚ÄúMommy, there‚Äôs a man.‚Äù

Her mother turned, kneeling to hush her. ‚ÄúSweetheart, what man?‚Äù

The girl pointed toward the doorway, but Thomas was already backing away, into the shadows of the hall.

‚∏ª

He didn‚Äôt sleep that night ‚Äî not that he really slept anymore. The family had settled in by dusk, filling the house with the sounds of life: drawers opening, water running, the little girl‚Äôs laughter echoing through the halls.

He followed them room to room like a trespasser, both angry and strangely fascinated.

They called each other by name.
The man was David.
The woman, Clara.
Their daughter, Lily.

They moved through the house as though they belonged there, as though the walls didn‚Äôt remember him.

He tried to make himself seen. He slammed a door. They only glanced at each other in confusion. He knocked a cup from the counter ‚Äî it fell soundlessly, and when he looked again, it was back where it had been.

He pressed his hand to the wall until it sank through, his skin fading into the paint like smoke.

He fell to his knees.

‚ÄúWhy?‚Äù he whispered.

The quiet had an answer for him, though not in words. It was in the subtle pressure of the air, the way the house seemed to breathe differently now. The stillness was changing ‚Äî it was lighter, as if the house itself had been waiting for them.

Not him.

‚∏ª

Days passed.

He lost count. The family‚Äôs life played out like a film he couldn‚Äôt stop watching.

Mornings were the hardest. The smell of toast, coffee, laughter ‚Äî all the small things that used to make up his world. He found himself standing in doorways, watching them.

Clara painted the kitchen walls. David fixed the old floorboards he‚Äôd always meant to repair. Lily drew pictures with crayons at the table. Sometimes she would stop and stare into empty corners, eyes unfocused, as if listening to something Thomas couldn‚Äôt hear.

Once, she asked, ‚ÄúMommy, who talks in the hallway at night?‚Äù

Clara froze. ‚ÄúWhat do you mean, sweetie?‚Äù

‚ÄúThe man. He says he lives here.‚Äù

David laughed it off, but Clara didn‚Äôt. Thomas saw the way she touched her arms, as if she felt a draft.

That night, Thomas stood in the hall outside Lily‚Äôs room, watching the soft rise and fall of her breathing.

‚ÄúI‚Äôm not trying to scare you,‚Äù he whispered. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs still my house. That‚Äôs all.‚Äù

Her eyes opened.

‚ÄúYou‚Äôre sad,‚Äù she said.

He stepped back, startled.

‚ÄúYou‚Äôre sad all the time.‚Äù

He swallowed. ‚ÄúI‚Äôm just‚Ä¶ tired.‚Äù

‚ÄúWhy?‚Äù

He tried to answer, but the words wouldn‚Äôt come.

She blinked slowly, then turned her face back to the wall. ‚ÄúYou should go to sleep,‚Äù she murmured, already half-dreaming.

Thomas stood there for a long while, listening to the sound of her breathing, trying to remember what it had been like to need sleep at all.

‚∏ª

By the third week, the house had begun to change around him.

The air grew warmer, the walls brighter. Photographs appeared on the mantle ‚Äî not his, theirs. A family smiling on beaches he‚Äôd never seen.

He hated the pictures.

At night he‚Äôd stand before them, trying to remember his own life. He remembered laughter, a woman‚Äôs face. Her name had been Evelyn. They‚Äôd lived here together, once. Before everything fell apart.

He tried to picture her clearly, but the edges of her face slipped away, replaced by the blank reflection of his own hollow eyes in the glass frame.

He smashed the photo once ‚Äî but when he looked back, it was whole again.

The house would not keep his anger.

And still, Lily watched him.

Sometimes, in the morning light, she would sit cross-legged on the floor, crayons scattered around her, drawing pictures of the house. There was always a shadow in the doorway, always the shape of a man she never colored in.

Her mother found one of the drawings and frowned. ‚ÄúWho‚Äôs this?‚Äù

‚ÄúThe man in the hall.‚Äù

‚ÄúLily, honey, we talked about this‚Äî‚Äù

‚ÄúHe‚Äôs sad,‚Äù Lily said simply. ‚ÄúHe misses someone.‚Äù

Clara‚Äôs face softened for a moment before she folded the paper away.

‚∏ª

By now, the walls had begun to hum.

Thomas could feel it ‚Äî a deep vibration, like the house was whispering to itself. Sometimes, when the family was asleep, he could hear faint echoes of his own life: a piano playing in the parlor, the smell of rain, Evelyn‚Äôs laugh.

It should have comforted him. But instead it made him ache.

Because he could feel something slipping. A sense that the house was closing him out.

He began to retreat to the attic ‚Äî the one place the family rarely entered. It was cold there, even by his standards, filled with old boxes and dust. He‚Äôd sit in the corner, hands clasped, trying to remember what it felt like to be alive.

Once, he found an old photograph ‚Äî his wedding day. Evelyn‚Äôs smile, his arm around her.

It hit him then, sharp and sudden: the sound of rain, the flash of headlights, her hand reaching for his in the dark.

He fell forward, clutching the photo, gasping.

The memory came in fragments ‚Äî the argument, the wet road, the screeching tires.

And then nothing.

Only the quiet.

 Part II

He didn‚Äôt remember dying. That was the worst of it.
The memory simply stopped at the sound of glass breaking, a sudden drop, and then the quiet. He‚Äôd told himself it was just shock, or trauma ‚Äî that the blankness was his mind‚Äôs way of protecting itself. But now, sitting in the attic, the weight of that silence felt like truth pressing against him from every direction.

He stayed there for hours, sometimes days ‚Äî though ‚Äútime‚Äù had become meaningless. The family moved below like figures in a play he couldn‚Äôt leave. He began to hear their patterns the way one learns the rhythm of waves. The creak of the stairs, the closing of doors, the hum of laughter. Each sound scraped something raw inside him.

One night, the wind picked up outside. He couldn‚Äôt feel it, but he could see the branches shaking in the window, dark against the half-moon. It looked real again for a moment ‚Äî and he thought, Maybe I am, too.

He stood and looked around the attic, at the boxes stacked neatly against the walls. Most were his, untouched since before Evelyn left. He knelt, brushed away dust, and found a label in his own handwriting: ‚ÄúHer things.‚Äù

He hesitated before opening it.

Inside were fragments of a life ‚Äî a scarf, a worn paperback, a photograph of her laughing, head tilted away from the camera. His throat tightened. He wanted to call out her name, to hear it echo in the rafters. Instead, there was only the faint groan of the house settling.

He thought he heard footsteps then, light ones, on the floor below. The little girl.

He moved to the stairs and looked down through the gaps. Lily stood at the base, holding a flashlight. The light wobbled as she craned her neck upward.

‚ÄúMr. Thomas?‚Äù she whispered.

The sound of his name jolted him. It had been years‚Äîno, more than years‚Äîsince he‚Äôd heard it spoken aloud.

He stepped halfway down the stairs. ‚ÄúLily?‚Äù

She looked right at him, eyes wide and unafraid. ‚ÄúI knew you were up here.‚Äù

He should have asked how she knew his name, but all he could manage was, ‚ÄúYou shouldn‚Äôt be here at night. Your parents will worry.‚Äù

‚ÄúThey‚Äôre asleep.‚Äù She tilted her head. ‚ÄúYou don‚Äôt sleep.‚Äù

He tried to smile, but his mouth felt stiff. ‚ÄúNot lately.‚Äù

‚ÄúAre you sad because of your wife?‚Äù

He froze. ‚ÄúWhat?‚Äù

‚ÄúShe said you‚Äôd be sad for a long time,‚Äù Lily murmured, as if repeating something she‚Äôd overheard.

He descended one more step. ‚ÄúWho said that?‚Äù

Lily frowned, concentrating. ‚ÄúThe lady in the mirror.‚Äù

The air seemed to tilt. ‚ÄúWhat did she look like?‚Äù

‚ÄúShe had hair like this.‚Äù Lily tugged gently at one of her curls. ‚ÄúAnd she was crying.‚Äù

Thomas felt the world shudder around him ‚Äî the beams, the walls, everything. He gripped the railing until his hand vanished halfway through it.

‚ÄúLily,‚Äù he said carefully, ‚Äúyou need to go back to bed.‚Äù

‚ÄúBut‚Äî‚Äù

‚ÄúNow.‚Äù

His voice carried a weight it hadn‚Äôt before. She blinked, frightened for the first time, and ran back down the hall. Her flashlight beam danced across the walls until it vanished into the dark.

Thomas stood there for a long time, unable to move, staring at the place where she‚Äôd been.

The mirror. Evelyn.

The quiet grew louder.

‚∏ª

The next morning, the family argued in the kitchen. Thomas listened from the doorway.

‚ÄúShe keeps saying there‚Äôs someone in the house,‚Äù Clara whispered, her voice sharp with worry. ‚ÄúSomeone named Thomas.‚Äù

David sighed. ‚ÄúKids make things up, Clara. You know how imaginations are.‚Äù

‚ÄúShe said he talks to her at night. That he knows her name.‚Äù

‚ÄúMaybe she overheard you reading those old letters we found. You said one was signed by a Thomas, remember? From the previous owner.‚Äù

Clara looked at him. ‚ÄúThey weren‚Äôt addressed to me, David.‚Äù

He hesitated. ‚ÄúYou mean‚Ä¶?‚Äù

‚ÄúThey were his wife‚Äôs,‚Äù she said softly. ‚ÄúEvelyn.‚Äù

Thomas felt himself go cold.

He wanted to speak ‚Äî to tell them to stop, to tell them not to say her name like that ‚Äî but his voice wouldn‚Äôt come. He was a shadow in the doorway, a ghost in the air between their words.

When Clara turned, she looked straight through him, but her expression flickered. For the briefest instant, her gaze sharpened, like she sensed him standing there.

She shivered. ‚ÄúI‚Äôm‚Ä¶ I‚Äôm going for a walk,‚Äù she said, grabbing her coat.

‚∏ª

She walked the perimeter of the yard, following the same worn path Thomas used to take every morning. He followed her out of habit, though he didn‚Äôt understand why. The day was dim and cold, the kind of autumn day where color drains out of everything.

She stopped by the edge of the drive, staring at the woods. ‚ÄúI feel like I‚Äôm being watched,‚Äù she whispered.

Thomas wanted to say, You are, but the words caught in his throat again. It was a terrible thing, to watch someone breathe and not remember what that felt like.

Then she did something unexpected: she turned and looked straight toward him. Not through him ‚Äî at him.

‚ÄúI don‚Äôt know who you are,‚Äù she said quietly. ‚ÄúBut please. Leave my daughter alone.‚Äù

The words hit him harder than any physical blow could. He wanted to tell her he wasn‚Äôt trying to hurt anyone, that he didn‚Äôt know how to leave even if he wanted to. But as he reached for her, his hand passed through her sleeve like smoke.

Clara flinched and backed away. ‚ÄúOh my God‚Ä¶‚Äù

Thomas stumbled back toward the porch, feeling the weight of her fear settle over him like a curse.

‚∏ª

The house changed again that week.

Lights flickered. The air grew colder. Lily stopped sleeping in her room and began to crawl into her parents‚Äô bed at night. Clara‚Äôs smiles became forced; David‚Äôs patience thinned. Tension hung in every corner like cobwebs.

Thomas felt himself unraveling, thread by thread.

He spoke to the walls sometimes, trying to remind himself he existed. ‚ÄúI‚Äôm not gone,‚Äù he whispered. ‚ÄúI‚Äôm still here.‚Äù

The walls did not answer. But the silence seemed to shift in reply ‚Äî a kind of acknowledgment that was worse than words.

He dreamed, if ghosts could dream, of the night of the accident. The road was wet, the radio low, Evelyn‚Äôs voice cutting through his own anger.

‚ÄúYou don‚Äôt listen, Thomas,‚Äù she‚Äôd said. ‚ÄúYou never listen.‚Äù

He remembered shouting back, headlights flaring, the shriek of brakes, her hand reaching toward him ‚Äî and then darkness.

When he woke, the house was empty.

For the first time since they‚Äôd arrived, the family was gone. Their cars were gone from the drive. The rooms were still.

He should have felt relieved, but the quiet didn‚Äôt comfort him anymore. It only made the emptiness inside him echo louder.

He walked from room to room, calling their names ‚Äî not out of anger, but something closer to longing. ‚ÄúClara? David? Lily?‚Äù

No answer.

He sat on the stairs, feeling the weight of the house settle again. Maybe they‚Äôd left for good. Maybe he‚Äôd scared them away.

He almost hoped so.

Then the door creaked open.

Lily stepped inside, holding something small in her hand. It was the photograph from the attic ‚Äî his wedding picture. The edges were torn, the faces blurred with age.

She placed it gently on the bottom step. ‚ÄúYou dropped this,‚Äù she said.

He stared at her. ‚ÄúYou came back?‚Äù

‚ÄúMy mom said we forgot something.‚Äù

She looked around, frowning. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs different when you‚Äôre gone.‚Äù

He didn‚Äôt understand. ‚ÄúWhat do you mean?‚Äù

‚ÄúThe house,‚Äù she said. ‚ÄúIt gets sad.‚Äù

He wanted to reach out, to thank her for seeing what no one else could. But before he could speak, her father‚Äôs voice called from outside.

‚ÄúLily! Come on, honey. We‚Äôre going!‚Äù

She turned to go, then hesitated. ‚ÄúShe says she forgives you.‚Äù

Thomas‚Äôs heart ‚Äî or whatever was left of it ‚Äî twisted. ‚ÄúWho?‚Äù

‚ÄúThe lady in the mirror.‚Äù

He couldn‚Äôt speak.

Lily smiled faintly, as if that made everything simple, then ran out the door. The sound of the car engine faded down the road, leaving him alone once more.

The quiet house sighed around him, a long, low exhale.

‚∏ª

Days ‚Äî or maybe weeks ‚Äî passed. The world beyond the windows dimmed until even daylight felt like twilight. Dust gathered on the furniture. The air grew heavy.

Sometimes, he thought he saw her ‚Äî Evelyn ‚Äî moving through the hallways. Never quite solid, never close enough to touch. Always just beyond reach.

He followed her once, down into the parlor where they‚Äôd kept the old mirror. The surface shimmered faintly, like a pond disturbed by rain. And then, for the first time, he saw himself clearly.

He wasn‚Äôt as he remembered. His face was gray, edges indistinct, eyes hollowed by a sadness that had no bottom. Behind him, reflected faintly, was Evelyn‚Äôs hand resting on his shoulder.

He turned, but she was gone.

When he looked back, the mirror was empty.

He screamed then ‚Äî a raw, broken sound that filled the room but made no echo. The house absorbed it whole.

He fell to his knees, shaking. ‚ÄúI‚Äôm sorry,‚Äù he whispered to no one. ‚ÄúI‚Äôm so sorry.‚Äù

The quiet pressed closer, like arms around him.

‚∏ª

By winter, new lights appeared on the road. A ‚ÄúFor Sale‚Äù sign went up again. The family hadn‚Äôt returned. But others would.

He knew the pattern now ‚Äî the cycle of arrival, fear, departure. He‚Äôd seen it before, though he couldn‚Äôt remember how many times.

He stayed in the attic, waiting. Sometimes he heard a piano playing faintly in the distance ‚Äî Evelyn‚Äôs melody. It always faded before he could find her.

Once, in a dream that felt too sharp to be illusion, she spoke.

‚ÄúLet go, Thomas,‚Äù she said. ‚ÄúThe house isn‚Äôt yours anymore.‚Äù

He wanted to answer, but his throat was full of dust. ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt know how.‚Äù

Her voice softened. ‚ÄúThen I‚Äôll wait.‚Äù

When he woke, the house was silent again.

But for the first time, the silence didn‚Äôt feel empty.

Part III (Final)

Spring came, though Thomas wouldn‚Äôt have known it by scent or temperature. He only knew it by light. It came earlier, slid across the floor in the mornings, lingered in the windows longer before dimming. He watched the world from the attic as if through the thinnest skin of water.

Weeks passed in that way‚Äîtime marked only by how the shadows changed shape on the walls.

Then one day, the sound of tires crunched on the gravel drive again.
He closed his eyes.

They were here: another family.

He descended the stairs, slower now, every step a whisper. The house had changed since last he‚Äôd roamed it. The furniture was gone, replaced by echoes and dust motes. The smell of paint and new wood drifted faintly through the air. He thought it almost smelled alive again.

A man and woman stood in the doorway, taking in the space. He could tell immediately they were different from the last family‚Äîyoung, laughing too loudly, unburdened. The woman said something about the light, how peaceful it felt. The man kissed her temple and said, ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs perfect.‚Äù

Perfect.
The word slid through him like a blade.

He didn‚Äôt move. He simply watched.

They stayed longer than most, unafraid. He found himself retreating to corners, avoiding them. Their joy filled the rooms like sunlight, and it hurt his eyes to look at it. He wondered if maybe he was finally fading, becoming less each day, the way an echo loses itself in distance.

But one night, as the moonlight spilled across the parlor floor, he saw something different.
The mirror.

It had been covered once, then uncovered, now standing again in its old place. The new owners had polished it. The glass gleamed.

He approached it.

For a long time, he didn‚Äôt see anything but his own dim shape. Then, slowly, another figure appeared behind him‚ÄîEvelyn.

She looked just as he remembered on the day she died: her dress damp from rain, her eyes shining, not with anger but something deeper.
Sadness.
Love.
Resignation.

‚ÄúThomas,‚Äù she said softly.

He turned, trembling. ‚ÄúEvelyn?‚Äù

She smiled faintly, a ghost of a smile. ‚ÄúYou‚Äôve been here too long.‚Äù

His throat tightened. ‚ÄúI thought I could fix it. If I stayed‚Äîif I made it right‚Äîmaybe you‚Äôd come back.‚Äù

‚ÄúI never left,‚Äù she said. ‚ÄúYou just couldn‚Äôt see me.‚Äù

He felt tears rise, though they never quite fell. ‚ÄúYou forgive me?‚Äù

‚ÄúI already did.‚Äù

He reached for her, but his hand passed through her shoulder like mist. Her form flickered, pale and half-light. ‚ÄúThen why can‚Äôt I go with you?‚Äù he whispered.

‚ÄúBecause you‚Äôre still holding on.‚Äù

The words pierced him in a way no physical wound could.

Holding on‚Äîto the house, the routine, the idea that he was still alive, that he could still belong somewhere. This place was all he‚Äôd had left, so he‚Äôd clung to it, even as it decayed around him.

He looked around the parlor‚Äîthe worn boards, the faint reflection of the new couple asleep upstairs‚Äîand realized how small it all seemed now. How small he seemed.

‚ÄúI don‚Äôt know how,‚Äù he said.

Evelyn stepped closer, her presence like the scent of rain before it falls. ‚ÄúRemember,‚Äù she whispered. ‚ÄúNot the end. Before.‚Äù

He closed his eyes.

And for the first time in years‚Äîor whatever this was‚Äîhe remembered everything. The first moment he saw her. The way she laughed when he painted the wrong wall blue. The late nights by the fire. The way she‚Äôd said his name as if it were something soft and precious.

He remembered how alive the house had felt when it was full of her voice.

When he opened his eyes again, Evelyn was gone.

The mirror showed only him now‚Äîtransparent, edges dissolving into light.

‚∏ª

He wandered the house one last time.

The kitchen where she used to hum.
The hallway where Lily had whispered his name.
The attic, where he‚Äôd waited too long.

He didn‚Äôt speak. There was nothing left to say.

At dawn, he stood in the doorway and watched the sun rise over the trees. For the first time since he could remember, he felt something like warmth.

It touched him gently, passing through, and he didn‚Äôt resist. He let it fill him.

And as the light grew, he began to fade.

Not violently. Not painfully. Just‚Ä¶ gently, like breath leaving lungs after a long sigh. The air shimmered where he stood, and then there was only light.

‚∏ª

When the new couple came downstairs that morning, the house felt unusually still. Peaceful.

The woman poured coffee, frowned, and said, ‚ÄúDid you hear that?‚Äù

‚ÄúHear what?‚Äù her husband asked.

‚ÄúLike‚Ä¶ someone walking upstairs.‚Äù

He shook his head. ‚ÄúOld houses. They settle.‚Äù

She smiled, but her gaze lingered on the staircase for a moment longer. Then she let it go.

Outside, the first birds of spring began to sing.

‚∏ª

The house stood quiet that morning‚Äîquiet, but not heavy anymore.
The air seemed lighter.
The silence was no longer hollow.

And if you listened closely enough, in that soft hush between one heartbeat and the next, you might have heard the faintest whisper, like a man‚Äôs voice saying a single word:

1o92hsj,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1o92hsj,Distilling tincture for FSCO/FECO/RSO pre-cook off,"After your FSCO has been properly filtered you can move on to the next step. The tincture can be filtered multiple times, I usually filter it through unbleached coffee filters 3x. The first filtration is often slow as the filters fill up with fine particulates and lipids. The 2nd and subsequent run much faster. This process can be substantially sped up with the use of a B√ºchner funnel and vacuum pump. If you go this path, a 2.5 cfm pump or smaller is adequate. 
To begin distilling set up your table top water distiller and make sure you have a mason jar adjusted under the spout correctly. I usually need to elevate the distiller with a few large books under it as a platform to make sure the stream goes directly into the recovery vessel, a 2 quart mason jar. Pour the tincture into the distiller put on the lid and set the distiller to 185F. Alcohol boils and distills at 176F so this should be sufficient. Set up a double boiler on your stove and get the next steps ready as your alcohol distills. I use a Pyrex dish over a large pot of boiling water for my final reduction and cook off. Depending on how much tincture you have and the beginning temperature of the tincture pre-distillation will determine how long the distillation takes, but it can often be accomplished in 20 minutes. Distill and reduce the tincture by 70%-80% to recover the most ethanol. Do not fully distilled the tincture. There needs to be a small amount of alcohol left in the tincture so that it pours out easily from the vessel into the Pyrex dish. If all the alcohol is distilled, or too much, it will make pouring off very difficult and sticky. In turn, there will most likely be lost product as the vessel is scraped clean. Take all distilled alcohol, and put it back into the freezer for storage and future use. Mason jars are very helpful in this process since they have lines and measurements on the sides to help you know how much tincture went into the distiller, how much alcohol was reclaimed, and a general idea of the percentage of tincture that still needs to be reduced in the final stage. In addition, once distilling begins, the alcohol should be pouring out of the distiller in a steady stream. When it slows down or the stream is slightly sporadic, the distillation can be finished and turned off. Always be careful when opening the distiller after using it. The liquid inside was just at 176F+ and may need to cool down before pouring into the Pyrex dish. Alcohol fumes are volatile, flammable, and can cause respiratory issues. Always distiller in a well ventilated area and never around an open flame. Once you have poured the remaining distilled tincture into the Pyrex dish, reduction and cook off can begin. Make sure to clean your distiller with isopropyl to keep it in best working condition and then properly store it for future use. Don‚Äôt run isopropyl through the machine, simply clean the inside and outside and wipe it clean. Picture 1 shows the distiller in action, reclaiming alcohol in the mason jar. On the display you can see it is running at 177F and set to 185F. I believe the brand is called CO-Z. It was purchased off Amazon for approximately $150 USD.
