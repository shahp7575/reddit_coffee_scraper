We‚Äôve been close friends for years, but ever since M got married like two years ago, it‚Äôs like she‚Äôs become a completely different person. Her husband and in-laws are super conservative and controlling. She doesn‚Äôt go out at night, won‚Äôt meet on weekends because her husband is home, and always needs to ‚Äúcheck‚Äù before making even the simplest plans.

I‚Äôve gone out of my way to include her. I‚Äôve done brunches, early coffees, day plans, everything possible to work around her restrictions. But it‚Äôs never enough. She either cancels last minute or wants everyone else to change their plans so she can be comfortable. It‚Äôs never ‚Äúlet me try to make it work,‚Äù it‚Äôs always ‚Äúyou all should change it so I can come.‚Äù

What really frustrates me is how little effort she‚Äôs made in return. I have my wedding soon and I‚Äôm moving to a new city after, and she hasn‚Äôt once tried to meet me, ask about the wedding, or even check in properly. Yet somehow I‚Äôm the one who‚Äôs ‚Äúhurt her feelings‚Äù because I‚Äôve been spending time with other friends instead of waiting around for her to be available.

I‚Äôm honestly tired of it. She *chose* to marry into a family that restricts her independence, and that‚Äôs her decision. But it‚Äôs unfair to expect everyone else to live within those same limits. I‚Äôm not going to feel guilty for having a life that doesn‚Äôt need her husband‚Äôs approval. And I don‚Äôt think it‚Äôs fair of her to expect me to change my life/plans to something her husband and in laws would approve. I (and other friends) honestly couldn‚Äôt care less what they think and she should understand that

It‚Äôs sad because I miss the person she used to be, but I also can‚Äôt keep chasing a friendship that‚Äôs become so one-sided and draining.

That advice is collapsing under grocery bills. New survey data shows nearly half of card purchases are groceries, with food prices up 2.7% year-over-year and many consumers enduring sticker shock. Rather than frivolous splurges, credit cards increasingly fund essentials like eggs, coffee and gas ‚Äî pushing household balances to $1.21 trillion. The narrative that credit-card debt equals moral failure ignores reality: high lived costs, stagnant wages, and rising rates force people to borrow to eat. Experts still warn 'don't borrow,' but that guidance serves people who can choose not to, not those who can't. Calling card use a behavioral problem hides a structural one and lets policymakers off the hook. Banks profit from this squeeze; policymakers condone it with silence while households shoulder the burden. If essentials drive card loads, the answer isn't shame; it's systemic fixes ‚Äî targeted relief, food-price interventions, or stopping wage stagnation. Short-term, consumers must prioritize paying cards monthly; long-term, the country must stop pretending volatility in grocery aisles is a private budgeting issue and treat it as an economic emergency.",1,1759939551.0,ReachClub,0,1.0,False

Packing, unpacking, and being out of my element can cause me to spiral, so I wanted to share if anyone else is the same.

*My toiletries were kind of already packed, so I just needed to move my gym toiletries to my suit case, and I was mostly there. I also have a makeup bag ready to go at all times, which means I don‚Äôt need to move stuff back and forth. 

*I follow the 10x10 packing formula for packing clothes, or the 5-4-3-2-2-1 method. This trip, I packed 5 tops, 3 bottoms, 3 shoes, 2 accessories (hats for me, other people might bring silk scarves or chunky jewelry), 2 outerwear (one lightweight, one for bad weather), and 1 purse. 

*When I‚Äôm in a hotel room, I try to keep everything as consistent as possible. My phone was always either in the outside pocket if purse or on my nightstand. My metro card was either in my right back pocket or next to my phone. All my food, snacks, and medicine was next to the room‚Äôs coffee maker, etc.

*As I am unpacking my purse and tote bag I brought with me on the plane, I‚Äôm writing down everything I packed in my bullet journal. Those myriad of little details can overwhelm me, so hopefully next time I can just flip back in my journal and see a super-detailed list. 

*I have a drawer in my closet that‚Äôs just dedicated to purse stuff. My travel bag is bigger than my every day bag, so I dumped all the extra pens, bandaids, mints, etc. into the drawer and repacked my daily carry with just stuff I need. I know I saw that tip on Reddit, but I forget if it was here or in r/wearingpurses. 

Anyways, it‚Äôs helped make unpacking a lot easier, and hopefully my next trip will go smoothly, too. I don‚Äôt know if this is the right flair, but I‚Äôm feeling really good about how well my trip went.

1o1ek3x,https://www.reddit.com/r/AquaGearLab/comments/1o1ek3x/could_waterdrop_wdpfal_pitcher_alkaline_filter/,Could Waterdrop WD-PF-AL Pitcher Alkaline Filter Improve Home Water Quality? Full Review,"Finding a good water filter can be tricky, but let me share my personal experience with the **Waterdrop WD-PF-AL Replacement Alkaline Filters** in everyday use. These are designed specifically for Waterdrop pitcher filtration systems and claim to improve water quality, enhance coffee taste, and offer various health benefits by turning your tap water into alkaline, mineral-enriched goodness. After weeks of using these filters, I‚Äôve developed a solid opinion about their strengths and weaknesses.

**Design and Fit**  
From the first time I opened the pack, the quality of the filter construction really stood out. It‚Äôs compact, at 3.11""D x 8.07""W x 5.47""H, and made with materials like activated carbon, resin, and alkaline substances that genuinely feel durable and well-thought-out. Installing it into my pitcher was a straightforward process‚Äîit fit snugly without any leaks or issues. I tested it with a few compatible models like the WD-PT-07 and WD-PT-05, and it worked seamlessly. These filters also weigh only 1.3 lbs, which makes handling easy and hassle-free.  

**Healthy Alkaline Water**  
Alkaline water has been trending because of its supposed ability to neutralize acidity in the body and provide added health benefits. These filters produce water with a pH range of 8.0‚Äì9.5, something I verified with a home pH tester for accuracy. Drinking this while working out made a notable difference; it felt smoother and less acidic compared to regular filtered tap water. My cousin, who‚Äôs a coffee snob, mentioned that his morning coffee tasted way better‚Äîit‚Äôs less bitter, with more clarity of flavors. A bit skeptical, I ran a side-by-side coffee test, and I‚Äôve got to admit, he wasn‚Äôt exaggerating.  

**[Grab Waterdrop WD-PF-AL at the best price on Amazon.](https://aquagroove.com/p/b096xrty3m/)**  

**Six-Stage Filtration Power**  
This product‚Äôs claim of six-stage filtration definitely piqued my curiosity. Over time, I noticed improvements in taste and odor. My off-tasting tap water completely transformed. The fact that it can filter out heavy metals like mercury and aluminum, along with fluoride and chlorine, added peace of mind, especially since I live in an area with questionable water quality. Beyond purification, the filter enriches the water with trace elements like magnesium, calcium, and zinc. These are nutrients I know my diet could use more of, so this bonus felt like real added value.  

**The Perks**  
- Enhances pH levels to produce alkaline water.  
- Removes harmful impurities like fluoride, chlorine, and heavy metals.  
- Adds essential minerals for improved health benefits.  
- Improves coffee and general drink taste by reducing acidity.  

**The Negative Attributes**  
- Filters need to be replaced fairly quickly, roughly lasting up to 100 gallons.  
- The fast flow rate, while convenient, made me wonder if some purification directly competed with speed.  
- The price is slightly higher than competitors, which might deter budget-conscious buyers.    

**Performance and Speed**  
What genuinely impressed me was the filter‚Äôs fast flow rate of 0.3 gallons per minute. Unlike slower filters that make you wait an eternity just to fill a glass, this one felt like an instant fix. It‚Äôs absolutely great when you have a crowd or frequently use filtered water for cooking‚Äîit keeps up without bottlenecking. Just pour and watch it work efficiently.

**Competing Products**  
Compared to other options like Brita and ZeroWater, I found this filter to excel in delivering alkaline water with added minerals. Brita, while effective for basic filtration, doesn‚Äôt match the enriched benefits or pH adjustment that Waterdrop provides. ZeroWater, on the other hand, removes almost *everything,* including beneficial minerals, leaving the water almost ‚Äútoo pure.‚Äù For me, this took away the pleasant taste. While the WD-PF-AL might be more niche in its approach, it hits the perfect middle ground for improving health and flavor without being excessive.  

**Price to Quality Ratio**  
Considering its unique features, including the alkaline benefits and ability to improve coffee taste, I rank the price-to-quality ratio as pretty fair. Sure, it costs more upfront compared to basic filters, but the long-term benefits to taste and health definitely justify the investment. If you‚Äôre a minimalist who values wellness in daily routines or someone who‚Äôs vigilant about water quality, this filter delivers without question.

Created by Oliva, the Nub line was designed to hit the ‚Äúsweet spot‚Äù of a cigar right out of the gate, and the 358 Cameroon does exactly that, wrapping rich Nicaraguan tobaccos in an elegant African Cameroon wrapper.

With coffee brewing on a crisp morning and a bit of quiet before the day began, I fired one up‚Äîand was immediately reminded why this little fireplug continues to win people over.


Presentation & Cold Draw

The Nub 358 is undeniably stubby‚Äîshort, fat, and solid in the hand‚Äîbut it‚Äôs also beautifully made. The Cameroon wrapper is a medium brown with fine veins and a dry, slightly toothy texture. It has a classic, understated look with an elegant band that complements the cigar‚Äôs stout shape.

Cold draw flavors included sweet tobacco, graham cracker, cedar, cinnamon and a light raisin note, with just a bit of spice on the tongue. The draw was perfect‚Äîopen enough for easy puffing but with enough resistance to keep the burn cool and slow.


First Third ‚Äì Sweet, Spicy, and Woody

The Nub Cameroon wasted no time. From the first puff, it delivered a medium bodied mix of baking spice, toasted wood, and creamy sweetness. The signature Cameroon spice came through immediately a gentle cinnamon like warmth, balanced by notes of sweet nuts and a hint of buttered toast.

The smoke was thick and aromatic, and the burn was razor sharp, creating a tight white ash that held firm well past an inch. For such a small cigar, it paced itself like a marathoner.


Second Third ‚Äì Rich and Rounded

As it transitioned into the middle, the flavor profile deepened. The cedar intensified, joined by notes of roasted peanuts, caramel, and a bit of earthiness. There was a satisfying, soft pepper on the retrohale‚Äînever harsh, just enough to keep things interesting.

At this point, the Nub 358 really showed its balance: sweet, spicy, nutty, and woodsy‚Äîall in harmony. Despite its short size, it smoked like a full sized robusto in terms of flavor development and duration.


Final Third ‚Äì Warm Finish, Smooth Exit

The final stretch leaned a little darker, introducing subtle notes of cocoa, black coffee, and charred oak, while the spice remained gentle but persistent. The nutty sweetness faded slightly, replaced by a dry wood and leathery finish that added a touch of maturity to the profile.

It never got bitter or hot, and despite its stout size, it kept its cool to the very end. I smoked it down to the nub with no regrets.


Final Thoughts

The Nub Cameroon 358 is proof that big flavor doesn‚Äôt require big length. It‚Äôs a medium-bodied, flavorful cigar that offers complexity, smoothness, and a slow, even burn that defies its size. Whether you‚Äôre short on time or just want something rich and satisfying without committing to a full Churchill, this Nub more than delivers.

With a smoke time of 45‚Äì55 minutes, it‚Äôs perfect for coffee breaks, early evenings, or pairing with a good bourbon or bold espresso. Would I smoke it again? Without question. The Nub 358 Cameroon is a little powerhouse that earns its spot in the rotation.",3,1759939014.0,cigar,0,1.0,False

First time using an espresso machine but this seems like it's way too low for a double shot. Running it through without coffee also has the puck flooded with the same amount of water pouring out the other end.

1o1efsi,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1o1efsi,"Nub Cameroon 358 Review ‚Äì Small Format, Big Flavor","Don‚Äôt let its short stature fool you‚Äîthe Nub Cameroon 358 delivers a full-sized cigar experience in a compact, slow-burning package. Created by Oliva, the Nub line was designed to hit the ‚Äúsweet spot‚Äù of a cigar right out of the gate, and the 358 Cameroon does exactly that, wrapping rich Nicaraguan tobaccos in an elegant African Cameroon wrapper.

With coffee brewing on a crisp morning and a bit of quiet before the day began, I fired one up‚Äîand was immediately reminded why this little fireplug continues to win people over.


Presentation & Cold Draw

The Nub 358 is undeniably stubby‚Äîshort, fat, and solid in the hand‚Äîbut it‚Äôs also beautifully made. The Cameroon wrapper is a medium brown with fine veins and a dry, slightly toothy texture. It has a classic, understated look with an elegant band that complements the cigar‚Äôs stout shape.

Cold draw flavors included sweet tobacco, graham cracker, cedar, cinnamon and a light raisin note, with just a bit of spice on the tongue. The draw was perfect‚Äîopen enough for easy puffing but with enough resistance to keep the burn cool and slow.


First Third ‚Äì Sweet, Spicy, and Woody

The Nub Cameroon wasted no time. From the first puff, it delivered a medium bodied mix of baking spice, toasted wood, and creamy sweetness. The signature Cameroon spice came through immediately a gentle cinnamon like warmth, balanced by notes of sweet nuts and a hint of buttered toast.

The smoke was thick and aromatic, and the burn was razor sharp, creating a tight white ash that held firm well past an inch. For such a small cigar, it paced itself like a marathoner.


Second Third ‚Äì Rich and Rounded

As it transitioned into the middle, the flavor profile deepened. The cedar intensified, joined by notes of roasted peanuts, caramel, and a bit of earthiness. There was a satisfying, soft pepper on the retrohale‚Äînever harsh, just enough to keep things interesting.

At this point, the Nub 358 really showed its balance: sweet, spicy, nutty, and woodsy‚Äîall in harmony. Despite its short size, it smoked like a full sized robusto in terms of flavor development and duration.


Final Third ‚Äì Warm Finish, Smooth Exit

The final stretch leaned a little darker, introducing subtle notes of cocoa, black coffee, and charred oak, while the spice remained gentle but persistent. The nutty sweetness faded slightly, replaced by a dry wood and leathery finish that added a touch of maturity to the profile.

It never got bitter or hot, and despite its stout size, it kept its cool to the very end. I smoked it down to the nub with no regrets.


Final Thoughts

The Nub Cameroon 358 is proof that big flavor doesn‚Äôt require big length. It‚Äôs a medium-bodied, flavorful cigar that offers complexity, smoothness, and a slow, even burn that defies its size. Whether you‚Äôre short on time or just want something rich and satisfying without committing to a full Churchill, this Nub more than delivers.

With a smoke time of 45‚Äì55 minutes, it‚Äôs perfect for coffee breaks, early evenings, or pairing with a good bourbon or bold espresso. Would I smoke it again? Without question. The Nub 358 Cameroon is a little powerhouse that earns its spot in the rotation.",2,1759938945.0,cigar_refuge,0,1.0,False

She has beautiful nut-brown skin and dark brown hair with the most beautiful golden highlights.. anyways so I've had a crush on her for like 3 months and in all that time I think I've talked to her once (honestly probably the best day of my life) so yeah I'll just wake up Sunday mornings and be excited because I get to see her and then never talk to her cause I'm so danged awkward (plus she's pretty and I'd be speechless anyway lol) and I just don't know where to start. I have no idea what she thinks of me, just she must like me well enough as a person cause she stood up for me when we were playing Mafia after class one night. She generally keeps to her own group of foster kids, and I usually keep to myself and sit with my friend (mostly because I haven't sat anywhere else in years). The only time I've ever sat near her and the other foster kids was the time I talked to her. I think my friend might know I like her cause one night I kept looking over towards her and my friend kept giggling and snickering quietly all through class and when I asked him about it later, he gave me an evasive answer, and he acted weird for like a week after. I'm probably forgetting something I meant to add but I'm probably rambling already. Also sorry if this is confusing and/or stupid; I had coffee at like 9 and it's midnight now (I'll probably post this in the morning) and also this is the first time I've ever liked anybody like this (or second, I suppose; though meeting a girl once 300 miles from home and never seeing her again hardly counts) but anyway yeah. I can't figure out where to begin.

Something unexpected happened recently and I would really appreciate a perspective.

I met this guy on Hinge (we both were bored and had free time lmao). On my hinge profile I had uploaded a difficult chess puzzle. And he was literally the only one who actually solved it. I was impressed and even asked follow up questions to cross check, only to realise he is a rated chess player (way stronger than me). Since we both had played chess on serious level, we actually vibed well (hard to find chess players like this lol) Within half an hour of talking we decided to let's just meet for 'chess and coffee meet' (Sounds reckless but it was quite go with the flow actually. Never did this before. We saw instagram and linkedin before meeting outside my college). Like not even a date, just casual meet, I bought the chess set and we ended up playing for hours.

It turned out to be one of the most crazy date ever. The chemistry felt so natural. We ended up talking for hours. Things got so interesting, we went personal, ended up smoking together (bad habit guys) and cuddling, then kissing (I know, too soon even for us) and it honestly felt so special. We escalated too quickly there. But not like in horny way, but passionate way. All in one night.

Since than we have been in touch every single day and even met few times, spent nights together. It feels genuine by the way he takes interest in my day and my topics. He is a lil nerdy type so I find him even more cute. He doesn't appear to try hard or go overboard but actually appears grounded but also passionate.

For the 3rd meet I couldn't contain myself and ended up getting him flowers in his favourite colour, and for the 4th date I got him handkerchief with his initial embroided by me. He was surprised lol. And guess what ? He preserved those petals to dry in chess book. (Initially planned to preserve petals in hankie). I honestly didn't expect that and found it so sweet.ü•≤ I mentioned to him that I liked kinder Joy and he ended up getting one for me same night üò≠. Got my favourite dark chocolate too. He has a bike, so he always drops me at my college hostel safely. Sometimes I tell that this temple is so nice and he goes 'we can go together' üò≠ I mean that melts me (he is atheist btw lol). Even when he is buzy in work, he takes time to reply and call !? He even paid for everything till now which I kind of feel bad for. And this all happened within 2 weeks !

I was lowkey expecting getting ghosted but turns out he was also lowkey worried of getting ghosted üòÇ? I mean I don't know where this is going. The thing feels to good to be true. Am I getting love bombed? Manipulated? This feels soo real. How to check. We both weren't looking for relationship and I don't know now if he wants to. I didn't wanted at first either but things are looking so peaceful. Going with the flow thing is gonna kill me a lil lol.

TL;DR: Met a guy on Hinge over casual meet ‚Äî we clicked instantly, things moved fast, and he‚Äôs been consistently sweet and thoughtful ever since. It‚Äôs only been two weeks, but it feels so real that I‚Äôm scared it might be too good to be true.

by Preston Dennett

All UFO encounters are interesting, but perhaps the most fascinating is when UFOs land and humanoids come out! Here are ten cases of UFO landings from across the world including the United States, Brazil, Australia, Italy, Spain, Norway, Finland, Scotland, France and England. They span over a period of five decades. They involve a wide variety of humanoid figures. Many are multiple witness cases. Almost all of them involve some form hard evidence such as landing traces, animal reactions, electromagnetic disturbances, psychic effects and physiological reactions. Some include government involvement and even disturbing threats from apparent men in black.

JUL 23, 1947, PITANGA BRAZIL: Topographer Jose C. Higgins hears a high-pitched hum. Suddenly a metallic craft lands next to him and out come three beautiful ETs wearing weird spacesuits. Jose founds himself surrounded by them. To his relief, they appear to be friendly. Feeling fear, he retreats and watches them from a distance as they begin playing like small children.

AUG 1960, NEWCASTLE, NSW AUSTRALIA: Helen Aldridge is awakened by a buzzing noise coming from outside her home. Looking out the window, she sees a craft shaped like a toy top landing in her backyard. Out steps a humanoid dressed in an olive-green jumpsuit. To her shock, it climbs over her fence and approaches right up to her window.

JUL 31, 1966, PRESQUE ISLE STATE PARK, PA: When their car gets stuck in the sand, Gerald LaBelle goes for help, leaving behind Betty Klem, Doug Tibbets, Anita Haifley and her two children. Without warning, a UFO lands in the forest next to them. Police arrive and leave with Doug to investigate. At this point, a huge hairy humanoid emerges from the forest and attacks the car. Before long officers from Project Blue Book arrive to investigate.

AUG 29, 1967, CUSSAC, FRANCE: When 13-year-old Francois Delpeuch and his little sister Ann-Marie (age 9) go to retrieve the family cows, they come upon a huge glowing sphere and four small humanoids walking around beneath it. When they approach for a closer look, the strange beings notice the two children and begin floating one by one back into the craft.

FEB 5, 1971, KINNULA, FINLAND: Two forestry workers (Peter Aliranta and Esko Sneck) get the shock of their lives when a UFO lands next to them in the forest. A small 4-foot-tall being emerges and approaches Peter. When the being turns around to enter the craft, Peter rushes forward and grabs the ET by the foot. It‚Äôs a decision that he will regret for a long time.

NOV 14, 1976, WINCHESTER, ENGLAND: Joyce Bowles is driving home. Her friend Edwin Pratt is in the passenger seat. They are concerned to see a UFO dropping down from the sky ahead of them on the road. Suddenly their car steers itself off the road. When they finally get it to stop, they see a UFO blocking the roadway and humanoids looking out the windows at them. Then one emerges from the craft, walks right up to them and stares at them fixedly. Their strange adventure has only begun.

MAY 18, 1977, ELGIN, SCOTLAND: Karen McLennan and Fiona Morrison (both 10-years-old) are playing near their homes when they hear a soft humming noise in the woods. They go to investigate and come upon a landed craft. Standing next to it is a tall slender man dressed in a silvery jumpsuit. As the man walks towards them, the girls flee. When they turn around, they see the craft flying off. But when they get home, they learn there are more witnesses. And then the threats start coming in.

SEP 18, 1978, SAN GIORGIO DI NOGARO, ITALY: Railway employee Giorgio Filiputti only wants to enjoy a quiet day of fishing. But it‚Äôs not to be. He hears a strange noise and an odd breeze. Going to investigate, he comes upon a landed craft. A weird 4-foot-tall humanoid looks surprised to see Giorgio approach. He stares at Giorgio and begins to work on apparently repairing his craft.

NOV 24, 1978, GERENA, SPAIN: When four young men go hunting along the Guadiamar River, they get a lot more than they bargained for. Seeing strange lights in the forest, they come upon a landed UFO and a 7-foot-tall humanoid. The strange figure starts walking towards them. When it gets too close, the men run away in a panic. Later, strange land-traces are found.

JUL 25, 1981. STJORDAL, NORWAY: Hjordis Hokstad wants only to enjoy her morning coffee and watch the wild deer in the field behind her house. Instead she sees a landed UFO and a weird humanoid wearing a spacesuit walking around the craft. She grabs her binoculars and gets a nice close look. Little does she know, her neighbor is watching the whole thing from his house.

There is no more room for denial. The evidence for the reality of UFOs and extraterrestrials is here for those with the courage to examine it. We are not alone! We are only one of many different humanoids in a universe teeming with intelligent life.

I wish my pilot instructors could see me now. Flying 'op-force', pretending to be a drug smuggler to train Coast Guard crews! Low altitude to stay under the radar. Low speed to keep my heat signature down. Flying straight toward radar sites to keep my profile small. It's below the horizon, but I can see the reflected glow of Pensacola over my left wing as I head to a small airstrip north of Tampa.

""What's that bright light high up to the North?"" Engine died! Auto pilot is gone. ""Mayday! Mayday!"" Radio is down. 

Rudder and flaps still work. Flat turn into the waves and nose up to lose speed. Loosing too much speed, nose down. Just above stall and almost wave top high. Check harness!



CRUNCH!



I'm down and floating, but I don't know for how long. Deploy life raft. Plane is going down slowly, but going down never the less. Life raft is out, what else? Ice chest, check. I guess my fishing trip is out but there is room for my tackle box. CO2 fire extinguisher, don't know what for, but why not. Toolbox, check. Flare gun and flares, check. What else? Oh, my personal bag and I'm out of the cabin.

Paddle around to the cargo hatch. Oh, Man! The tail broke completely off and is gone. Can't get the hatch open but I can reach in from the tail. Everything is jammed! All I can get out is the bottom half of one of my rods and it's open face reel. There she goes! She wasn't mine, but I'm going to miss her. What I won't miss will be the days spent filling out forms when I get back to base.

Back to here and now. Shelter is up and beacon light is flashing on top. It will be awhile before anyone gets here, probably mid morning. Get everything arranged, no corners or sharp edges near the raft wall or floor. I know it cost more than I could really afford, I'm am glad I bought a top of the line, four man raft rather than rely on the raft they provided that is still jammed up with the rest of the stuff in the tail of the plane. Now I have room to stretch out, I'm going to get some sleep.

Beginning of day one:

Ah the breakfast of champions, an almost cold bottle of Dr. Pepper and the leftover half of a bag of chips.   I have the six inch sub and four more bottles of Dr. Pepper in the ice chest that was suppose to be for my fishing trip lunch.   I hope to be rescued before I need to get into my emergency supplies.

The sea anchor is out and tight, I guess the breeze is moving the raft along.   There's a yellow Mylar and foil kite in the kit, I think there is enough wind to launch it.   It is suppose to make me easier to find with eye or radar.

I wonder if I can get a cellphone signal out here?   I heard they were putting cell towers on the oil rigs.   I didn't think my phone got wet, but it won't come on.   My radio has a crank and solar charger along with a USB port I can hook my phone into.   I'll put them into a dry, sunny spot to dry and charge.

Morning day three:

Wind must have died sometime last night, the kite is down.   Good thing it floats, or it would have been another sea anchor if the line didn't break.   I have to start bringing it in after sundown.

My phone fully charged, but won't come on.   My radio, that was in my aluminum personal bag, sort of works.   AM and FM are nothing but static.   Short Wave has static but I can hear faint voices that I can't understand the words.   I wished I had saved some wire from the plane, I could run an antenna up the kite line.   Maybe tonight I will get a better signal.

No sign of any search.   I haven't even seen a contrail since I started looking yesterday.   If I see one, there is a slim chance that they would see the reflection of my mirror, but a slim chance is better than no chance.

I started on the survival rations last night.   It was a basic four person, two meals a day, two week kit.   One hundred ration bars, two dozen freeze dried meals, and eight half gallon water bags in it.   That's only enough water for two days for four people, but it has a water filter for fresh water and four floating solar stills.    Aquamate Solar Stills produce one to four pints a day, which is at max barely enough for an adult for a day.

One thing no one mentions in stories is how boring it is being alone in a raft.   I've read all the manuals that came with the raft and equipment, twice.   I finished one of the paperbacks I had in my personal bag and almost finished the other one.

Well, the kite is dry, I guess I'll launch it.   I am going to do some fishing.   What I'll do with them if I catch some I don't know, I don't care for sushi.

Day five:

I'm  tired for a change.   I was up all night last night filling containers with rain water.   Everything that would hold water, including myself, that wasn't keeping something dry is full.   The wind kept pushing the raft along inside a rain storm.   The wind and waves weren't too bad but it rained hard.

Day eight:

Had a scare today.   I was taking care of some 'personal business' this morning and a small bull sharks bumped the raft.   It was less than five feet long, but I was holding a rope stretched across the raft as I was hanging over the side.   I had heard that urine attracts sharks.   Since I am not a shark, I don't know if they mistake urine for blood or if they think the urine is from a large school of fish.   It's not big enough to kill you quick or eat you quick, but out here any major injury can kill you.   No gun but a flare gun and outside of Hollywood, it is hard to kill or drive off a shark with a flare.   Tying a knife to an oar is a good way to loose both. Maybe I'll hit it over the head with the fire extinguisher.

Morning Day nine:

Still no AM or FM radio, but I heard something on Shortwave that I could understand last night.   Somebody in northern Idaho was retelling what he heard from the West Coast.   Either whoever had set off the EMP bomb had miscalculated or had a second one that didn't go off because electronics that were in valleys that didn't face east in the western mountains were protected.   Also on the southern West Coast the damage was lighter and no damage farther out in the Pacific or Alaska.   After the EMP, some pilots got replacement electronics out of protected storage and repaired their crop dusters all across the country.   Most of the pilots were South Americans, but there were diverse groups such as Aryan Brotherhood and Radical Black Muslims.   Many of the planes had ""FEMA"" or ""DHS"" stenciled on their wings and sides.

The planes sprayed diseases, typhoid, cholera, and such.   Information gained from one South American pilot that was captured while refueling said they were to target operating transportations, large groups of people, residential neighborhoods, and government buildings.   The hate groups focused on the ones their hate was towards.   The plane spraying Hollywood stopped spraying and attacked the one spraying the Barrios.   The two planes exchanged pistol shots until the both crashed into a radio tower.   In San Diego, another was shot down as it approached the Marine base.   The explosion and fire didn't destroy all the typhoid that was in the tanks.   The base is locked down as they try to stop the epidemic.

There were similar sprayings in Europe, Russia, and Asia.   Fighting with conventional weapons has broken out in Africa and the Middle East.   Mostly it is tribe or sect against tribe or sect.   U.S. military commanders are trying to return with their commands intact.   They are finding it most difficult to get out of countries that wanted them the least.

Alaska is deporting most foreign nationals.   People that were trying to become citizens are being judged on a case by case basis.   Some are being sent to the lower 48.

South America is in turmoil.   The leadership of several countries were killed by small groups of black clad men.   After that several laboratories and factories had mysterious fires and explosions.   

What this means to me is that there is no one that is going to be looking for me.   If I am going to be rescued, I will have to rescue myself.   I've pulled the kite and sea anchor.   The cover has been reset to act as a sail.  The wind continues out of the southwest and I am using an oar for a rudder to steer toward the north or northeast.

Day twelve:

I am seeing an occasional seabird in the distance, I must be getting closer to land.   I've gotten so tired of food bars, sushi doesn't sound so bad now.   I had caught a fish this morning, but lost it to what looks like the same small bull shark.   Not only did I lose the fish, I lost one of my favorite lures.   If I'm out here much longer, I will need to do something about that shark.

Day thirteen:

Water is getting low again.   I put out two of the floating stills.   I get almost three quarts of water from them.   I drink an ounce or two of seawater every evening to replace salt and minerals.   Much more that that is counter productive, causing the body to loose water and salts.

Afternoon day fifteen:

Rained this morning. Not as hard or as long as last time, but I collected about four and a half gallons of water plus what I drank.

Day eighteen:

Last evening I saw seabirds flying north and east at sundown.   Land is getting closer.

Day twenty:

I finally did it, the bull shark and I had it out.   It kept rubbing on the same spot on the raft and I was afraid it would wear a hole in the raft.   I saved up a days worth of urine.   Caught two small fish near the raft.   I cut the smaller one into small pieces and put the large one on the end of the nozzle of the CO2 fire extinguisher.   When everything was ready, I dumped the urine, then the chopped up fish.   When the shark showed up, I put fish on the end of the extinguisher into the water.   When the shark went to bite the fish, I shoved the nozzle as far as I could into the shark's mouth and pulled the trigger.   I don't know if it was the cold, the pressure, or both, but the shark thrashed twice and rolled belly up.   I didn't know if it was just stunned, so I quickly gutted it.   Shark tartar is not bad after more than two weeks of meal bars.

Day twenty one:

Breakfast was more shark tartar with the hot sauce from the freeze dried meals.   The shark jaw is hanging below the raft for the fish to clean.  There are strips of meat and fins hanging to dry in the sun.   There is more shark than I can eat before it goes bad, so if it doesn't dry, I won't consider it wasted.   I've saved some of the shark skin.   Have I mentioned how boring it is being on a raft alone?

Night of day twenty three:

Just before sundown I saw light reflecting off the mast of a ship. I took a compass bearing and headed toward it.   I sailed on until I thought I would be close to it.   I put down the sail and put out the sea anchor.   I'm going to put this flashlight away and try to get some sleep, tomorrow promises to be a busy day.

Evening of day twenty four:



I am sitting here at a table and eating the most delicious thing I have ever eaten, a can of generic chicken and rice soup. This is after three weeks of meal bars and raw shark.



When it started to get light this morning I started to look for the ship. Of course I was looking in the wrong direction. It was west of me and I couldn't see it until the sun came over the horizon. It was a few hundred yards off and it took me more than two hours to paddle the raft to it. There was no signs of life except for three gulls that were sitting on the aft railing.



After I tied off the raft and climbed aboard, the first thing I saw were the remains in the stern. Between the weather and the gulls, there wasn't much left but bones and rags. There were signs of two people, two coffee cups in the sink, two unmade beds, and such. My best guess was one of them had gone over the side. The boat, the ""Right Angler"", was a private fishing boat out of Destin, FL. The fuel tanks are half full which should be enough fuel to reach Pensacola or maybe Tampa. The twenty pound propane tank that ran the fridge was almost empty, the one on the stove was almost full and one of the two spares was full. There wasn't much eatable in the fridge, some pickles, some olives, and a block of cheddar that I ate after I trimmed off the gray.



I decided to go back to Pensacola, since that is where I was based. I bagged the bones and rags that were on the deck. By the time I had the raft unloaded, deflated, and everything put away, it was late afternoon. I didn't think it would be wise to approach the base in the dark. With some difficulty I got the engines started and idled northward to charge the batteries and to check to see if everything was working with the boat.



A couple of hours after dark I checked and the batteries were fully charged so I shut off the engines and prepared my feast. When I get through eating I plan on changing the sheets on one of the bunks and see if I remember how to sleep in a bed.



Day twenty five:



I wake up before dawn as usual but it took me a while to remember where I was.   I heated a can of stew for breakfast.   After breakfast I restarted the engines and headed north again.   After the sun was up I checked the horizon and saw dark clouds to the southwest.   I moved the throttle a little more open.   Not as fuel efficient, but neither is being overtaken by a storm.   By the time I could see the Pensacola skyline, the storm was just a dark line on the horizon.   The skyline told me where I was, so I turned toward the naval base.



About two miles out I saw a cutter headed towards me.   There is no way this boat could outrun it and I didn't want to, I cut back the throttle.   When they started slowing down I cut it back to idle.   When they stopped, I stopped.   They dropped a ship's boat off the lee side of the cutter.   Four people got on the boat.   The first got behind the controls and the second got behind the thirty cal. machinegun and trained it on my boat.   That was in addition to the fifty cal. or twenty mm that was on the bow of the cutter.   I made no sudden moves.

Epilogue:

""Name and reason for being in restricted water.""

""Captain Mary Stillwater and I am returning to base, Chief.""

""What is your call sign?""

""Deep.""

""Hold"" and the chief petty officer called back to his ship on the radio.

""They are confirming your information back at base.""

""I see operation 'Mayhem' worked.""

""Yes Ma'am, they got some electronics out of a bunker and had a helicopter in the air in just a half hour after the attack.   I heard that 95% of communications are online at the base and 70% of the aircraft are flight worthy.""

""Chief, you are a little free with information.""

""No ma'am, I remember you.   I was working base security the night you busted up that drunk civilian contractor.""

""He tripped and fell on the stairs.""

""Yes ma'am, that is what the official report said, but it seems rather difficult to dislocate your right shoulder, break your nose, and crush your left instep in a fall on some stairs when you end up at the top of the stairs.   I heard the self defense instructor mention almost all the women in that barracks signed up for advanced self defense classes.""

""Never mind about that chief, I heard on the short wave about what happened out west, what happened here?""

""The base commander put the base on lockdown immediately.   When there was enough vehicles running he sent convoys out to pick up off base personal and what families that were willing to come.   The helicopter saw the plane spraying the city on the way to the base.   They forced it down in the bay.""

""Did they get the pilot?""

""They put some hazmat suits on and took a boat out.   They thought it might have been some type of nerve gas and got a sample from the tank.   They went through full de-com when they got back to base and they were fine, but the pilot died from an antibiotic resistant pneumonia.

The pilot was from Bolivia and thought he was learning to fly for the Cartels.   When they filled his tanks, they gave him a pill and told him it would protect him.  We lost a lot of people in town, but it seems to be under control.   Anyone going into town or coming onto the base has to go through quarantine and get tested.""

""Me too?""

""Considering you have not been in contact with anyone, probably not.   You will still have to go to the infirmary and get checked out.   Afterwards you will probably have to fill out a bunch of paperwork explaining why your paperwork is not up to date.""

""Civilization may be ending, but somebody has to have their paperwork done.""

""It's not as bad as it was, the C.O. has been pulling able bodies out of offices and putting them to work.   I think he hates paperwork and is enjoying eliminating a bunch of busy work.

""The Skipper says to bring you on board.   What do you want to do with the boat?""

""It's a good boat, can we tow it in or fuel it up some and have someone drive it in?   Let me get my gear.   Would the cook like some dried shark?""

1o1e8ev,https://www.reddit.com/r/dpdr/comments/1o1e8ev/1_year_4_months_update_things_are_a_lot_better_im/,[1 year 4 months] Update! Things are a lot better. I'm 90%+ back.,"Doing this for my peace of mind but things have gotten significantly better! Feel free to check out my 1 year post for a bit more context. 

TL;DR: I took an edible about 1 year and 4 months ago that completely fucked me up. The following 6 months were hell. HELL. DPDR, anxiety, existentialism, dread, you get it. Things slowly started getting better around the 6 month mark onwards. Lots of ups, some downs along with it, but I am doing so much better than before. The DPDR is essentially gone. Like 99% gone. Only in very rare moments do I zone out but I'm well-aware of it and it doesn't haunt me like it used to. 

The weird lingering effect that's been annoying me is the anxiety and stress. NEVER in my life had I experienced anxiety/stress remotely like this. I would get anxious before an exam, big school project, or a rollercoaster, sure, but never beyond that. Nor would I really experience significant / prolonged stress. Now, I can physically feel that my body has been in a fight-or-flight state AFTER the DPDR began fading. Weirdly, I couldn't even identify and label this feeling because I'd never had it before. I couldn't figure out why this was the case either because most people I talked to had the reverse experience; they have anxiety first and then the DPDR hits them. The closest explanation I have is that DPDR blunted my emotions and feelings, and once it started fading, I experienced them for what they really were. So I've been in a state of overdrive for the last few months. Any minor stressor would compound quickly. There are a lot of telltale signs - muscles always tensing up, unable to live in the present moment or always thinking about something else, feeling physical signs of stress, etc. Most days it was easy to deal with this because I wasn't stressed about anything. 

HOWEVER, recently I went through a pretty stressful life event. Nothing ""worldview shattering"" per se but definitely significant. Because my body is still in a fight-or-flight state, it triggered a stress loop like no other I've ever experienced. I started getting cluster fucks of headaches, I couldn't sleep, I had nightmares, and then even once the stressor had gone, its effects lingered like a bitch. My muscles were always tense, I was constantly anxious and/or stressed, and my scalp became so tense that it started prickling. I've had this feeling only one other time in my life and it was the previously most stressful time of my life. It was nowhere near this extent either. I'm confident this feeling will fade like it always has before, and I know I'll come out of it stronger. 

If you're in a similar situation, it's all about teaching your body and mind that the world is safe. Expose yourself to things in low-stakes situations to relearn safety. Exercise and cold showers helps me a LOT to calm my mind. Longer, hot showers help to relax your muscles. I am a chronic coffee drinker so I've tried to reduce my coffee intake. It was definitely making me jittery and more ""fight-or-flight"". Notice when your muscles tense up and be very intentional about unclenching them. 

**What did I do to make my progress to this point?**

I tried almost everything (supplements, lifestyle changes, meditation, etc) besides meds. A lot of things helped, some didn't, but I don't think anything made it worse. What I learned is that none of these things made me ""better"" or ""fixed me"". At best, they accelerated my recovery or mitigated SYMPTOMS (not the underlying issue) but even then, marginally. That's not to say go out and buy every supplement. Try them if you can! But the lifestyle is the most important by far (great sleep in terms of routine, length, and quality, consistent high intensity exercise, and a great diet).

You have to believe that time will fix things. I used to be fixated on the ""time"" part of that sentence. I didn't want to wait for things to get better because I felt so powerless and I wanted to be proactive. I rationalized that if some random thing can flick this switch ON in my brain, something can surely flick it OFF as easily. Once I shifted my focus to the ""believe"" part of believing time will fix things, things got better. You need to have 100% confidence that things will get better. Why? Because they do. Everyone's story is so unique that once you start fixating on others' recovery, you attach your success or failure to theirs. There are more than a million factors that resulted in your situation. To this day, I cannot find someone who had a story like mine. It doesn't matter. For me personally, doing things like this where I can expunge the negative feelings lifts a giant weight off my shoulders. I don't like to burden other people with this so I try to journal or write it all down and then move on with my life. Find what works for you! Note down observations, thoughts, feelings, inner monologues, and more. It's all trial and error in the end, and you know yourself best. 

As always, feel free to reach out to me about anything. Happy to help. Cheers!

I greatly enjoy the writing I do, and am also an avid reader, lately Ive been on a big EmHen kick, read Book Lovers and Beach Reads back to back.  About 12 days ago I decided it might be fun to attempt to write a slow burn romance myself.  Now I'm about 20,000 words and 15 chapters into the work, been writing about 1500 words a day, a pace I certainly can't maintain probably, but I have been enjoying it so far.  My partner and I split up on Sunday, which makes writing romance hard, so I am probably going to step back  for a few days.  

I'm hoping to lean into a slow burn orbital romance, moving through the seasons, the first half of the book, Fall and Winter, is very internal, setting emotion, tone.  Shorter chapters that still carry weight.  The second half, Spring and Summer will be more external and outward, longer chapters that are more active. Hope to hit more upmarket literary fiction than standard romance.  This text does deal with grief, suicidal ideation, depression and death.

# Chapter 1¬†

He didn‚Äôt always think about dying, but deep down he knew the only way this was really ever going to end was hanging from the end of a belt. There wasn‚Äôt a time in his life when he had been unaware of this reality, despite a constant effort to shift and maintain perspective.

The first time he had tried to hang himself he was seven, in a tiny closet in his bedroom on 6th Street‚Äîor was it First Street‚Ä¶? They had moved often when he was a child, more often than the T in ‚Äúoften‚Äù should be pronounced; once seven times in one year.

¬†His early years were a blur of faded, stamped-down memories, and he often wondered if the horrors he remembered were worse than the realities he‚Äôd faced at the time. He‚Äôd learned some questions were better left unasked.

Now in his early forties he had a toolbox for dealing with such thoughts, the product of years of therapy. He liked to say he‚Äôd had to break before he took it seriously. Not entirely true. But on days like today, the only truth was that he scared himself. Not that he was scary to anyone else; most people saw him as a bubbly ray of light, a big personality, often too big. He‚Äôd built playfulness into himself, a coping mechanism for what his childhood lacked. And underneath, for as full of life as he seemed, he was empty.

‚ÄúWhy are you sad and lonely?‚Äù his therapist had asked him the day before.	 ‚ÄúBecause I am sad and lonely,‚Äù he‚Äôd said. Because he was. But isn‚Äôt everyone?

He didn‚Äôt think so. He forced himself out of the apartment and down to a particular bench he loved. His neighborhood had one of those curated strips with more bars and boutiques than anyone needed.¬† Still, it was quaint in its small-town way, despite being in the center of the city. A place where volunteers watered flowering baskets strung from globed, old-timey streetlights. He came here to read, usually with coffee, sometimes a forbidden cigarette, though he‚Äôd mostly given up smoking, and he watched: happy couples on dates, those who ran for show, people walking dogs he couldn‚Äôt have.¬†

On this day a family passed, three little girls, the youngest in a pink princess dress with large, bug-like fairy wings slung cockeyed across her back. ‚ÄúDaddy, uppy,‚Äù she giggled as he hoisted her onto his shoulders. It was Tuesday; the little ice cream shop on the corner ran a two-dollar special and the line wrapped the block. He briefly stood in that line when he first moved here, hoping sugar might fill the hollow, but the size and chaos of the queue had made him reconsider.

The bench sat under a locust tree across the street from the local AM station, KFAB, on the north side. He loved the nostalgia of its giant red neon letters glowing in the dusk or dawn. Beneath the sign was a DIY candle shop with bistro tables; it seemed to thrive, somehow, despite what seemed to him a niche market. A place where people came to make things and memories while he watched from across the street. He had never stepped inside.¬†

Just behind the bench, a narrow walkway cut between the Italian place with its iron-fenced patio, planters spilling with herbs and flowers, and the local bank, where a little free library was bolted to the wall. Neighbors used it constantly, a quick pedestrian path that ran straight through to his block. He liked how it made the neighborhood feel stitched together, like even its shortcuts had been designed for charm.

¬†He rarely walked on the north side of the street for some reason, and when he did he usually kept to the alleyways, or to visit the coffee shop on the northeast side of the strip.

He could tell fall was coming before the leaves changed: a thinness to the air that smelled like damp sweaters and the promise of streetlights coming on early. The coffee shop leaned into the season faster than anyone; its windows fogged with steam and a chorus of pastries lined the counter like a small sugary armada. He pulled his shacket collar up and went in.

The bell chimed and the world hit him: pumpkin and cinnamon, a warm, sticky cloud that wrapped the pastry case like an invitation. His throat tightened; his eyes went slick. It wasn‚Äôt dramatic, he wasn‚Äôt going to keel over unless he ate it, but the scent had history. He‚Äôd learned the hard way in college, working nights as a baker. One breakfast rush of cinnamon buns and his face had puffed, his tongue gone wrong; a coworker had told him gently: cinnamon wasn‚Äôt for you. He‚Äôd laughed, what else could you do, and kept working until his hands ached. That was how you learned the difference between something that hurt you and something that almost did. Cinnamon belonged in that liminal aisle.

Now the smell scraped memory and body both. He pressed his heel to his sternum and glared at the pecan rolls as if they were weaponized nostalgia. In darker rooms he‚Äôd imagined how tidy it might be to go quietly, pounding a tray of sticky, cinnamon-laced pastries, and the thought would pass like a freight. He catalogued it, filed it under *Things I Do Not Act On.* Another tool.

‚ÄúLarge black, a little ice,‚Äù he told the barista.¬†

A polite, ‚ÄúYou okay?‚Äù and he threw back a joke too quick for the space. Coffee in hand, he stepped back into the chill. Coffee made things better. Coffee made things right.

He walked past the community garden, its rusted metal sign looming overhead, plasma-cut into the shape of a giant carrot. When he first inquired about the apartment, he‚Äôd already put in a request for a garden plot, some semblance of hope disguised as planning, only to learn there was a two-year waitlist. Waiting had become expected; he could handle this, deal with it, shrug it off, and move on, as long as he didn‚Äôt allow the waiting to become longing. He was good at compartmentalizing; it was one of the tools in the box. He took a breath as he walked on and, in his mind, he journeyed away to a tall-grass prairie that grew flowers like dreams; he envisioned himself walking through the amber and reddened waves of wild grains, a gentle breeze he could hear more than feel.

Some days he couldn‚Äôt get his mind to travel there though, to this safe space he had spent years cultivating in his head. On those days¬† he circled the garden, past decaying sunflowers with oversized heads, then into the alleyway where the discarded things lived. Among the trash he felt steadier than on the bright strip; it transported him back to his childhood, growing up in that small town trailer park, next to the viaduct. He looked for plants fighting for survival, the little lives that insisted on existing anyway, much like he had. He walked the three blocks down the alleyway, then he crossed back over to the south side of the street, settled, and returned to his bench.

His book sat unopened on his knee. The neon buzzed; couples floated past toward cones; children shrieked. His phone vibrated against the metal slats. *You alive?*

Lisa. Of course she noticed when he didn‚Äôt post his Wordle after dinner. He usually did, stacking little colored boxes like prayers. Today he hadn‚Äôt.

*Yes, you vulture. Just forgot,* he typed.

Thirty seconds later the phone rang.

‚ÄúYou? Forget Wordle?‚Äù Her laugh was sharp and familiar. ‚ÄúThat‚Äôs like Santa forgetting Christmas.‚Äù	 ‚ÄúPlease. Santa‚Äôs too busy playing Connections, trying to link ‚Äòcucumber‚Äô and ‚Äòsnake.‚Äô Whole North Pole‚Äôs shut down,‚Äù he said. She groaned. ‚ÄúYou‚Äôre impossible.‚Äù ‚ÄúGreen things in grass?‚Äù he teased, and waited; her laugh landed a beat late, like she was catching up. The delay hit him like a small, cold thing, his smile stumbled for a fraction, and he felt the seam there. He let the brightness hold anyway; that‚Äôs what she wanted. For most people, that was what worked.¬†

¬†‚ÄúYou sure you‚Äôre good‚Ä¶?‚Äù Lisa asked.	 ‚ÄúYeah. I‚Äôm good. Thanks for checking in.‚Äù	 ‚ÄúLet‚Äôs grab a drink this week, try that new place by you. I‚Äôve got stories.‚Äù	 ‚ÄúHave cuts been made from the roster‚Äîno wait, don‚Äôt tell me. Save it,¬† I‚Äôll need a drink for this.‚Äù	 ‚ÄúStop. OK. We‚Äôll catch up later this week. Drinks!‚Äù

The call ended and silence pressed in. He set the phone beside the unopened paperback and watched the families drift by like he was behind glass. God, he wanted a dog‚Äîbut the apartment didn‚Äôt allow pets; that was the price he paid for location., and damn if he didn‚Äôt love this location. He leaned back and let himself feel it all: the emptiness, the weight, the cinnamon still scratching at his eyes, the promise of fall. Then he lowered his head to the Emily Henry paperback.

**Chapter 14: The Meeting**

Langston arrived first. She moved through the unlit corridor in precise, measured steps, the beam from her pen‚Äëlight skimming along door frames and revealing dust she would never have tolerated a month ago. Inside the conference room she flicked the switch, heard the fluorescents whine, and immediately flicked it off again. ‚ÄúFine,‚Äù she muttered. ¬†Lamps would do. She dragged three desk lamps from side benches, set them at equal intervals around the long oak table, and angled the shades so the light fell in a soft triangle, bright enough to read by, dim enough to keep the new ache between her eyes at bay.

She laid out placards --*DR. LANGSTON / DR. BATES / DR. WEI --* exactly twelve inches from the table‚Äôs edge, then placed a government‚Äëissue recorder in the center as though the Department of Health still had clerks to type transcripts. The room smelled of ozone from idle equipment and faintly of juniper from a bundle of berries that one of the other doctors had brought in. ¬†Langston straightened her blazer, smoothed her bun, and tried to ignore the tremor in her fingers. Procedure was a lifeline; if she followed it, the world might still be made of rules.

Bates arrived next, hands in the pockets of a soft gray cardigan that didn‚Äôt match any dress code Langston recognized. She paused at the doorway, taking in the name cards and the stiff formality, and a quick, wry smile tugged at one corner of her mouth. ‚ÄúMinutes and everything?‚Äù she murmured, voice low so it wouldn‚Äôt disturb the hush. ‚ÄúIf you‚Äôd printed an agenda we could have coffee and pretend the FDA still cares.‚Äù

Langston pretended not to hear the tease. ‚ÄúPlease take your seat, Meredith. We‚Äôll start when Dr. Wei joins us.‚Äù

Bates sat, but not before tilting her lamp a shade lower, making the light warmer on Langston‚Äôs starched collar. She folded her arms, woolen boots hooked around her chair legs, and watched Langston with sympathetic curiosity.

Wei slipped in last, almost soundless, a linen scarf looped at his neck, eyes already adjusted to the dim. He offered Langston a courteous nod, Bates a knowing one, a half‚Äësmile flicked across his mouth before settling into calm seriousness. Wei then sat without ceremony or fidgeting.

When the recorder‚Äôs red light blinked on, the only noise was the soft tick of a distant refrigeration unit and, beneath it, the shared silence of three people who knew they were about to decide humanity‚Äôs fate.

Langston tugged a tube from her satchel and unscrewed the cap. The sheet she slid out wasn‚Äôt paper but thin, flexible Mylar, its surface over‚Äëprinted with a world projection and faint latitude lines. She spread it across the table; lamplight gleamed on the coating, and Bates obligingly anchored the corners with four empty beakers.

‚ÄúColors, please,‚Äù Langston prompted, reaching for a notebook.

Bates lined up a row of self-sticking dots in various colors at the margin of the map. ‚ÄúI scented them to make them more memorable,‚Äô she said, as though that were perfectly reasonable. Wei nodded. ¬†

Langston gave Bates a long look that was nearly a glare, then started placing the dots.

Lavender dots clustered along the Southeast, then trailed northwest like vines escaping a pot.¬†¬†Wei leaned closer, nostrils flaring as he sniffed. ‚ÄúLavender carries linalool,‚Äù he murmured, naming the compound. ‚ÄúAppropriate for mapping the reports we are assuming are areas of Attuned. Its calming.‚Äù

Sage dots mixed with lavender, but sparser except in areas of business and commerce where they were more ¬†evenly distributed. ‚ÄúAnd sage is thujone,‚Äù Bates said. ‚ÄúSmells sharper, helps me remember the Basic cases.‚Äù

Langston‚Äôs pen scratched. ‚ÄúTo review for the record: lavender equals confirmed Attuned clusters, sage equals majority Basic, gray pending, black indicates catastrophic ELM death of more than twenty percent of the local population.‚Äù Bates gasped as Langston placed black dots in Sub‚ÄëSaharan Africa, Uruguay, Estonia and South Dakota in the US. More black dots in every continent, every nation. Tears brimmed Wei‚Äôs eyes.

Langston nodded. ‚ÄúSources are field interviews, hospital logs, WHO bulletins, and whatever open‚Äësource cell‚Äëvideo we can still scrape before servers go dark. It‚Äôs patchy, but the pattern persists.‚Äù

Wei tapped the eastern seaboard of the United States, now a haze of lavender that diffused inland along railroad spurs. ‚ÄúWashington to Chicago in nine days. The amplitude of spread is faster than even measles prior to vaccination.‚Äù

‚ÄúBecause no one is isolating,‚Äù Bates said. ‚ÄúThey‚Äôre calm, not scared.‚Äù

She tracked a pen over to Milan. Sage dots mix with¬†lavender on northern trade arteries, then to S√£o Paulo‚Äôs interior, where lavender islands floated in a sea of black. ‚ÄúExplain the Brazilian interior, Helena. Why lavender inside an ELM kill zone?‚Äù

‚ÄúMissionary aid flights,‚Äù Langston answered. ‚ÄúThey arrived with flour and diapers. Their flight nurse was already Attuned; she breathed in a cargo hold with twenty volunteers.‚Äù

Wei smiled faintly. ‚ÄúCharity carries more than blankets.‚Äù

Langston pointed to Australia‚Äôs rim where two lonely lavender disks clung to the coast. ‚ÄúBut here is almost untouched. Airline traffic collapsed after the first wave. We could still keep whole regions Resistant.‚Äù

‚ÄúResistant or vulnerable,‚Äù Wei corrected. ‚ÄúDeaths are still rising in Darwin‚Äôs suburbs. If we withhold MIMs, we‚Äôre choosing who lives and who dies.‚Äù

Langston lifted her eyes from the map. ‚ÄúAll right. Scope acknowledged. Next question: do we accelerate, contain, or do nothing?‚Äù

Wei folded his hands. ‚ÄúBefore we move to that vote, may we agree on one point? Wherever lavender settles, the morgues stay empty.‚Äù

Bates slid the remaining stickers into her pocket. ‚ÄúAnd wherever black spreads, children are burning with encephalitis.‚Äù

Langston‚Äôs jaw tightened, but she conceded with a single nod. ‚ÄúPoint recorded.‚Äù

She closed her notebook with a soft snap. A small staccato sound that was a prelude to the real debate.

The stickers in place, Langston pinned the Mylar map to a foam-core board and propped it against the conference room wall. The stickers were starting to curl at the corners‚Äîlavender, sage. The black ones clung heavily to the page like bruises. There were so many black ones.¬† She stood beside it now, notebook open, posture tight as piano wire.

Wei and Bates sat opposite each other, mugs of cooling tea between them. Outside the reinforced windows, the generator thumped like a tired drum. Inside, ¬†the scratch of Langston‚Äôs pen filled the room.

‚ÄúLatency,‚Äù Langston began, ‚Äúaverages twenty-four to forty-eight hours. In ELM survivors with lingering immunosuppression, the window can compress to as little as six.‚Äù

‚ÄúIt‚Äôs possible that it compresses more than that. There are reports of MIMs saving ELM patients who appear to have mild brain swelling at the onset ¬†of the encephalitic phase.‚Äù

Langston nodded, ‚ÄúI‚Äôve heard that too, but at this time it's only anecdotal.‚Äù

‚ÄúAnd the active phase?‚Äù Wei asked.

Langston turned the page. ‚ÄúMedian five hours. Elevated cortisol correlates with compulsive truth-telling, erratic metaphor use, sensory-driven speech, and physical pacing. Then... cessation. Most subjects transition cleanly into a new baseline within twelve hours of the onset of the active phase.‚Äù

‚ÄúNo deaths directly attributed to MIMs?‚Äù Bates asked.

Langston shook her head. ‚ÄúNone. Outcomes are stabilizing. Twenty percent of the general population emerge Basic. Sixty-five percent present as Attuned. Remaining fifteen percent are either resistant, ambiguous, or pending final assessment.‚Äù

She paused. ‚ÄúAnd fertility patterns are becoming clearer.‚Äù

Wei looked up.

Langston read without commentary: ‚ÄúBasic males are completely sterile. Attuned males show significantly diminished sperm motility. Low, but not zero. Observed sex drive in Basics: negligible. In Attuned: markedly reduced. Birth rate across lavender and sage zones projected to stabilize at twenty-five percent of pre-ELM levels.‚Äù

Bates blinked, slowly. ‚ÄúNot extinction. But close.‚Äù

Bates looked thoughtfully at Langston and said, ¬†‚ÄúLooks like the earth gets her reset either way. They die through ELM‚Ä¶ or they‚Äôre never born at all.‚Äù

They considered in silence for a moment before Langston continued, ‚ÄúNo aggressive behavior reported. No reproductive coercion. No statistically significant pair-bonding in either group post-transition. Sexual activity drops off almost entirely within the first week.‚Äù

Wei exhaled, slow and even. ‚ÄúThat might be the most hopeful thing I‚Äôve heard all day.‚Äù

Langston moved to the map. She touched a lavender cluster near Atlanta and let her finger trace the spread westward along the old rail lines. ‚ÄúLavender zones show near-total ELM suppression. Ten days from first infection, mortality rates drop to statistical noise.‚Äù

She gestured toward the blackened dots in eastern Europe, inland China, the center of Australia. ‚ÄúBlack zones still losing up to twenty-five percent of population, and that number will likely go higher without intervention. Hospitals are overwhelmed. Long-term care units collapsing. Caregivers are burning out.‚Äù

Bates tapped the table lightly. ‚ÄúSystems are failing where fear still rules. But where MIMs¬†takes root--‚Äù

‚ÄúFear drops,‚Äù Wei finished. ‚ÄúCaretaking becomes communal. Energy use flattens. No more overconsumption.‚Äù

Langston‚Äôs lip curled. ‚ÄúBecause half of them are standing barefoot in fields talking to moths.‚Äù

Wei shrugged. ‚ÄúStill sustainable.‚Äù

Langston had resumed her pacing, a habit that had returned since the map went up. Her heels made a soft rhythm on the concrete floor, measured and tight. ‚ÄúWe haven‚Äôt run long-term cognitive studies,‚Äù she said abruptly. ‚ÄúWe don‚Äôt know what happens to Attuned children at adolescence. For all we know, they could lose executive function, or fail to develop it in the first place. Basic adults may be incapable of abstract planning. Society could stall.‚Äù

Her voice didn‚Äôt rise, but the edge was there, under the surface and well-controlled.

Wei leaned back in his chair, not in dismissal but in quiet counterbalance. ‚ÄúSociety is already stalling,‚Äù he said, folding his hands. ‚ÄúELM is a guillotine falling in¬†slow motion. With MIMs, at least the survivors remain nonviolent, collaborative. Alive. According to their neurochemistry, blissful, even.‚Äù

Langston stopped walking but didn‚Äôt sit. ‚ÄúAnd what exactly do we become? Dreamy philosophers humming at plants while the plumbing rusts?‚Äù

Bates spoke gently. ‚ÄúHistory will judge intent. If we accelerate distribution, we‚Äôre making a decision on humanity‚Äôs behalf.‚Äù

Wei didn‚Äôt flinch. ‚ÄúAnd if we do nothing, we‚Äôre still deciding. We‚Äôll watch millions die knowing it was unnecessary and because of us. Non-action is still action. Just slower. Don‚Äôt forget, MIMs gives individuals a choice.‚Äù

Langston bristled. ‚ÄúChoice? Where is the choice in this? Basic subjects didn‚Äôt choose docility. We rewired them. You rewired them.‚Äù She folded her arms. Bates knew it was her ‚Äòtell‚Äô that she was having difficulty controlling her emotions.

‚ÄúThe choice,‚Äù Wei said, ‚Äúis internal. MIMs¬†doesn‚Äôt impose. It offers. A door appears. Whether someone walks through depends on their architecture. Their wiring. Their will.‚Äù

Langston‚Äôs eyes flashed. ‚ÄúThat‚Äôs metaphysics, not science. You have no proof. No data supports any of this.‚Äù

For a long moment, no one answered.

Then Bates, still seated, let her fingers drift to the map where a lavender dot overlapped a black sticker. She brought the tip of her index finger to her nose and inhaled. ‚ÄúThe scent is fading,‚Äù she said absently. ‚ÄúAlready.‚Äù

Then, without looking up: ‚ÄúMaybe metaphysics is the only workable model we have left. A leap of faith.‚Äù

Langston opened a slim manila folder and withdrew a single sheet of paper: she had created a Tygress Internal Ethics Ballot. The form looked out of place on the conference table now cluttered with scent-marked stickers and handwritten logs. It had the neat lines and checkboxes of another era, one that still believed governance could be printed on 20 lb. bond and filed in a drawer.

***‚ÄúDecision regarding future deployment of MIMs, global scope.‚Äù***

There were three options, each with a small square beside it.

Langston set the form in the center of the table, aligned precisely with the grain of the wood.

Wei reached for the pen first.

He checked the box next to:  
**Proceed with targeted global seeding.**

He signed beneath it with a firm, slanted hand. No hesitation.

Bates picked up the pen next. Her eyes scanned the form twice before she made her mark.  
**Proceed with targeted global seeding.**  
But before she signed, she added a line in blue ink just beneath:  
**Review quarterly. Cease if deleterious trends emerge.**

She signed her name below that, the loop of her ‚ÄòB‚Äô faintly smudged.

The pen lay idle.

Langston stared at the form for a long moment. Her fingers flexed once. Then she placed the pen down without touching the paper.

‚ÄúAbstain,‚Äù she said flatly.

No one spoke. The silence was deep and heavy, broken only by the slow cycling whine of the outdoor generator as it kicked back on, its rhythm like a weary breath.

The form sat in the center of the table, two-thirds complete.

Two-thirds was enough.

Wei reached into his shoulder bag and produced two drawstring bags. Inside the bags were a handful¬†dark-glass cylinders. He set them gently on the table and slid one toward Bates.

The cylinders were miniaturized nebulizers with silent, dry-fog delivery. Each one was pre-loaded with carefully suspended doses of MIMs. It looked very much like spray for asthma relief.¬†¬†

‚ÄúTemples,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúPilgrim festivals. Places where reverence still carries weight.‚Äù

Bates nodded, pocketing the vial. ‚ÄúTransit hubs,‚Äù she added. ‚ÄúChild-vaccination sites. People still trust nurses more than prophets. How many doses are in each bottle?‚Äù

They worked without ceremony. Into their linen duffels they packed paper maps, spare clothing, bundles of dried herbs for scent-masking.¬† No electronics. No laptops. Nothing that could be tracked. Only notebooks, worn and stitched with thread, already marked with thoughts they didn‚Äôt want a server to know.

When it was time to go, Bates stood at the door with her hand on the frame. She glanced back at Langston.

‚ÄúCome with us, Helena,‚Äù she said. ‚ÄúWe need your caution out there.‚Äù

Langston stood motionless by the map. Her arms were folded tight across her chest, but her jaw was looser now, her voice quieter.

‚ÄúSomeone has to remain uncommitted,‚Äù she said. ‚ÄúTo measure what commitment does.‚Äù

Wei placed his palm over his heart and bowed slightly. It was half salute, half farewell. ‚ÄúThen listen well,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúThe data will arrive on the wind.‚Äù

And then they were gone; just footsteps soft on concrete, echoing once in the hall before disappearing into the morning.

Langston stayed behind.

With the maps. With the silence. With the form, unsigned.

The lab felt larger once they were gone.

Langston stood alone among a sea of dark monitors, their blank faces faintly reflecting the soft amber of the desk lamps. The scent of lavender still hung faintly in the air, clinging to the Mylar map like a memory.

She exhaled once, sharply, and her breath shuddered at the end.

Then she turned.

Her heels clicked as she crossed to the comm station, a hulking relic from a time when protocols still mattered. The screen flared to life at her touch, casting sterile blue light across her face.

She dialed.

One number after another.

Every remaining government contact.  
Every pharmaceutical board chair.  
Every think-tank fellow who still owed her a favor from a panel, a grant, or a quietly shared tip.

Voicemail.  
Voicemail.  
An out-of-office bounce-back with no return date.

The silence pressed against her ribs.

Then, finally, her fingers hesitating only a moment, she opened the private channel. The one she‚Äôd never used. The one marked in red across the top of her internal clearance log.

**DEFENSE EMERGENCY BIO-THREAT ASSESSMENT.**

She entered digitally coded handshake and listened for a tone.

Then a voice that was flat, filtered. ‚ÄúAuthorization?‚Äù

‚ÄúThis is Dr. Helena Langston, Tygress Biotech,‚Äù she said, enunciating each syllable. ‚ÄúMy colleagues have left the facility with intent to disseminate an unregulated neuro-active agent across multiple continents. I require immediate interdiction.‚Äù

Silence.

Then: ‚ÄúDr. Langston, confirm agent lethality.‚Äù

‚ÄúZero lethality,‚Äù she snapped. ‚ÄúBut total behavioral modulation. That should scare you more.‚Äù

Another pause. It was longer this time.

Then, curtly: ‚ÄúUnderstood. Escalating. Stay where you are.‚Äù

The line went dead.

Langston sat back, palms sweating, a faint tremor working its way up her forearms. Her eyes drifted across the empty room. She saw the quiet desk lamps, the now-empty chairs, the thick linen duffel Wei had left behind on the floor, zipped shut like a promise. She drew a breath somewhere between a gasp and a sigh.

The map still glowed faintly lavender on the table. Were the dots a soft constellation of hope, or something worse?

She stared at the exit for a long time.

And then, to no one, or maybe to herself, she whispered, ‚ÄúMay history damn the right people.‚Äù

She didn‚Äôt know yet whether she meant herself, or them.",1,1759938135.0,redditserials,0,1.0,False

A few months ago, I was just sketching random designs in my notebook during late nights and coffee breaks. Nothing fancy, just ideas I thought would be fun on a T-shirt or hoodie. I loved the designs but didn‚Äôt have the space or budget to order 100+ pieces of inventory, and I didn‚Äôt want to compromise on quality.

After some research, I found a print-on-demand platform called Apliiq that seemed different from the others. What caught my eye was that it wasn‚Äôt just about printing, I could add custom labels, patches, and embroidery without needing a huge order.

I decided to test a few designs, just a handful of T-shirts and hoodies. When the first batch arrived, I was blown away. The fabrics felt good, the prints were crisp, and the custom touches made the pieces feel like something a real brand would sell. It gave me the confidence to expand slowly and focus on creating a small but cohesive collection.

This experience taught me two things: small batches don‚Äôt mean small impact, and details matter more than quantity when building a brand identity.

The phone rang before the thunder did.¬†

Rain pressed against the narrow windows of her house, impatient and loud, and the street outside gleamed black beneath the lamps. Miriam sat upright before she was fully awake, hand reaching for the receiver on instinct. ‚ÄúMrs. Hale?‚Äù The voice on the other end was clipped and tired. ‚ÄúLocal officer here. We‚Äôve got a body off Route 9. Could you come? We‚Äôd like it moved tonight.‚Äù For a moment she didn‚Äôt answer, the static between them filling the room like breath. ‚ÄúOf course,‚Äù she said at last, voice calm, practiced. ‚ÄúI‚Äôll be there soon.‚Äù¬†

When she set the phone back into its cradle, the hum of the embalming room seemed to vibrate inside her chest, though the funeral home was miles away. She always carried it with her, the faint chemical smell, the clean metal, the steady rhythm of her work. It was a comfort she never questioned.¬†

Beside her, Daniel slept with one arm flung across his face, the other curled near his chest. The moonlight fractured across his cheekbone, and for a heartbeat she almost didn‚Äôt recognize him. Then she bent and kissed him softly on the temple, whispering, ‚ÄúBe home before dawn.‚Äù He didn‚Äôt stir. She rose, slipped into her slate-gray robe, and began to dress for the night‚Äôs work.

She rose and dressed carefully. Under her thin slate-gray robe she wore a charcoal sheath dress, long sleeves hiding her fragile wrists. Opaque tights, ankle boots laced tight. Her waxed coat went on last, collar turned up against the rain. She tied a green scarf around her throat, took the keys from their hook, and stepped into the storm.

The drive was a ribbon of wet silver. The hearse‚Äôs lights reached through the fog, her hands steady on the wheel. The smell of disinfectant and tulips lingered in her mind, a phantom comfort. She told herself she was going to work. She felt a flicker of warmth at the thought of Daniel waiting, still warm beneath their sheets when she returned.

At the family‚Äôs house, grief hung heavy in the lemon-scented air. They were quiet people, faces swollen from weeping, the kitchen light flickering. Miriam spoke with the softness she saved for such nights. She said his name, Mr. Hargrove, as she signed the forms. She let them touch the sheet, let them blink their small birdlike blinks of disbelief. Then she wheeled him away.

The body was loaded with the precision of habit. Her gloved hands moved with the rhythm of long practice. She spoke to him softly, as she did with all of them. ‚ÄúWe‚Äôll take good care of you, Mr. Hargrove.‚Äù The thunder rolled again, and the sky cracked open.

When she arrived at the funeral home, the air felt thick and strange. The building was empty, yet she could almost feel the energy of someone moving in the upper halls. She turned on the lights one by one. The white tiles gleamed. Bottles of formaldehyde stood in rows like soldiers. She cleaned a counter that was already spotless, humming under her breath.

Then the front door creaked.

Miriam froze. Her pulse fluttered like trapped wings. When the light in the foyer flicked on, Daniel stood there, damp from the rain, holding a paper cup and a waxed bag that smelled like cheap donuts.

‚ÄúFor the mortician so dedicated,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúThought you‚Äôd need a pick-me-up.‚Äù

She laughed and took the coffee. Even standing there, he made the room feel electric, as if it depended on him for its pulse. They spoke in low voices, made small jokes about her work, the absurdity of television morticians. He lingered near her as she adjusted her tools, teasing her about the music playing faintly through the speaker. When she said she needed to finish, he kissed her hand, promised he‚Äôd go home, and disappeared into the storm.

Hours later, after finishing her work, Miriam locked the doors and drove home through streets emptied by the rain. The thought of warm sheets and Daniel‚Äôs slow breathing filled her with a sweetness she didn‚Äôt often feel.

But when she stepped into the house, something was wrong. The air was heavy, the kind of stillness that knows too much. The kitchen chair had been pushed back, and the lamp leaned sideways. The scent was off, like something rotting beneath the wallpaper.

She found him in the bedroom.

Daniel lay as he had before, one arm over his face, the other splayed across the pillow. He looked peaceful, but too still. The color of his skin was not the color of sleep. Miriam touched his shoulder and felt the cold. A tiny, broken laugh escaped her throat.

She bent and kissed his cheek, the same way she had hours earlier. The skin was dry and fragile beneath her lips. Her breath hitched. The truth came apart and reassembled in one violent instant.

He was dead.

She sat back, trembling. Her mind spun through the night like film reels on fire. The phone call. The family. The drive. Mr. Hargrove. She remembered it all, but the edges blurred. Had she gone to a house at all? Had there been a family waiting? Or had she only driven from one dark building to another, chasing the echo of her own voice?

She thought of other nights, other bodies she had taken home under the guise of ‚Äúcare.‚Äù A man from the highway last winter. A woman from the motel. Small trophies hidden neatly where no one would find them. She told herself she was preserving beauty, rescuing what the world abandoned. She called it devotion.

The truth was smaller and sharper. The funeral home was not her workplace. It was the basement of this house, the place she had turned into a mirror of what her mind needed. She had written her own forms. Signed her own names. The bodies had never left this property.

A record in her mind began to play. Her old diagnosis, written once on hospital paper: schizophrenia, chronic, with psychotic features. She had memorized the words and tried to build fences around them... schedules, checklists, the steady rhythm of ‚Äúwork.‚Äù But the fences had rotted.

Now she climbed into bed beside him. She placed her hand on his chest, waiting for a heartbeat that never came. The bed smelled faintly of formaldehyde and roses. Her lips touched his cheek again, cold against cold.

Outside, the rain softened to a whisper.

When morning came, the house sat quiet. A chair pushed back, a coffee cup half-empty on the counter, a donut with one bite missing. Downstairs, the air was cool and sterile. On the metal table lay another form, pale beneath a linen sheet, waiting for care.

Miriam closed her eyes and smiled. The world, for now, was in order.

They are super immature and two faced and it‚Äôs starting to suck 
I usually stay quiet about my problems but now it‚Äôs just bad and I have no one to talk to-

I‚Äôm crying and I don‚Äôt feel like typing a ton so here‚Äôs just a list 

The person who convinced me to dump my best friend after I found out he was a cheater is now cheating on her bf 

I‚Äôm expected to do all the work for this one friend bc I scored higher then her on 1 test 

One girl won‚Äôt stop commenting on what I wear, I wore a sweatshirt and took it off because she wouldn‚Äôt stop commenting and looking at me and laughing 

I can‚Äôt do anything without them criticizing me 

I have to drink caffeine in the morning and they complained when I brought coffee, so I brought soda instead and now they don‚Äôt shut up about that either 

The same girl that won‚Äôt stop talking about what I wear won‚Äôt stop saying I have pink eye (I don‚Äôt my eye has been like that for years.) 

They never stop screaming

I was called into the councilor‚Äôs office because they won‚Äôt stop telling people I‚Äôm schizophrenic 

I‚Äôm not taken seriously, if I say they are taking it to far they take it farther 

They are all mad im still friends with a girl from my old school 

I can‚Äôt even wear my favorite pair of shoes because they don‚Äôt shut up about them 

They are just like this with everyone, and it was fine at first but now I‚Äôm just sad and insecure about everything, they make me question everything I do and it sucks. This is only some of the things that have happened this year and it‚Äôs only been a month. I don‚Äôt have a class where they arnt in there. 

They are so close that if I drop one I drop them all and I end up alone, it‚Äôs a small school and there aren‚Äôt that many options for friends. 


My mom is freaking about because I didn‚Äôt want to go to school because yesterday absolutely sucked. I‚Äôm tired and miserable and she‚Äôs wanting to call the school but it‚Äôs just gonna make my life hell, I already know what they are gonna say.

I‚Äôm going to school late and I know they are gonna comment on my eyes being puffy, on what I‚Äôm wearing, my hair I didn‚Äôt really bother to fix, everything. I expect it now. 

I used to be confident and fine and now I stare at what km wearing because my friends don‚Äôt stop talking about it.


Yesterday I took off my sweatshirt in the bathroom and tried to figure out what was wrong. It was one of my favorite sweatshirts and now I‚Äôm probably never gonna wear it to school again.


I know this is just me being a baby but I can‚Äôt take this anymore, my mom wants me to say something but they will think it‚Äôs a joke and it will get worse. I‚Äôve already tried to say something in the past.

I, (32F) have gone no contact for 4 months now with my nmom. I'm also almost 8 months postpartum,after having my beautiful baby boy. 

My nmom has been depressed, suicidal etc almost all my life(attempted suicide when I was 4 years old, saved by my dad, attempted again when I was 21,had to fight her body to body to be able to call an ambulance for her). 

In 2019, things got really bad, she got super depressed and paranoid that my stepfather(she's divorced my dad and remarried years ago) is cheating on her and wants to end her life. She told me this in the car. I panicked, blacked out and walked away, walked 5 km before I realized what I had done and got scared that she will actually die. Called a friend of her to help, shit hit the fan as she wanted to drunkenly drive to her friend. Got caught by the police and I had her committed to a psychiatric hospital. 

Since then, she has had on and off periods of depression, has seen on and off therapists but doesn't really do anything to actually start healing her trauma as many times she's lying to her therapists. 

Fast forward 2023( I get married), now every time she needs her supply, my husband is to blame and accuses him that he is manipulating me against her. He has tried countless times to help her, has been alongside me at different ""unaliving"" attempts to talk to her, to offer counsel, hugs, moral support etc. 

Last year, when I just found out I was pregnant, it was in the middle of a no contact episode. I had to be hospitalized because I almost lost the pregnancy, during which I was receiving horrible messages from by nmom because I've gone no contact(she didn't know at that time either of the pregnancy nor that I was in the hospital).

After she found out I was pregnant, me and my husband met with her for coffee to try and set some boundaries and reconnect. We specifically said ""if you want to be in this child's life, you have to stay in therapy and do the work"". Which, of course she didn't even attempt going back to therapy. 

This summer, out of the blue she wanted to open an account for my baby and she *demanded* I give her my baby's birth certificate so she can go open the account. I said let's meet and talk about it for a number of reasons(1.i don't trust her with financial decisions, 2. Here you need a parent to actually open an account so she couldn't have done anything by herself, 3.i don't want her to have any form of control over my son cause money has been a guilt tripping mechanism she has used on me in the past) 
That was the breaking point and I went yet again no contact. 

Today she has called me to announce yet another unaliving attempt, to which I lost my cool and started shouting some horrible things to her about how she has f-Ed my life up(I am also in severe debt because of her, but that's another separate and long story) and how I will not allow her to destroy and traumatize my child's life. And ended the call. 

Now she keeps messaging me about how my husband is manipulating me to believe that she's toxic and he's the mastermind that is trying to keep her away from me and her grandson. 

So yeah.. Very long post, most of it for venting purposes, I guess? Also I'm suspecting she is trying to now use my son as supply since he can't say no...",4,1759937368.0,raisedbynarcissists,2,1.0,False

Real passive and sustainable income backed by money of AT&T and T-Mobile - they pay $0.50 per gigabyte transmitted through Helium Mobile Hotspots. Not sure where to start gathering information? Here.

Unlike many crypto projects, this is about a **real, tangible product: mobile data**.

The demand is huge and growing massively. The Helium Mobile Network transmits data for AT&T, T-Mobile (USA) and Movistar (Mexico). The demand for mobile data grows every year - more streaming, more social media, more video calls. Smartphones aren't decreasing, they're increasing, and every single device needs more and more data volume.

The compensation is fair and stable. Per gigabyte transmitted, you get **$0.50**, and this rate is **completely independent of the current HNT price**. Whether HNT is at $2 or $10 - you get the same per GB. This makes your earnings predictable and plannable.

The supply is growing, but not nearly enough. While the number of Helium Hotspots is steadily increasing (see Helium World), we would need tens of millions of hotspots before real competition for locations emerges. Currently, in most cities there are still huge white spots without adequate coverage. This means for you: Good locations are still easy to find, and this guide helps you make the right decisions in location selection and other steps in the process.

2. What is Helium Mobile?
3. Location Selection

6. Installation
7. Carrier Offload Approval
8. Billing and Agreements with the Business Owner

# 1. Introduction

Welcome to Helium Mobile Hotspot Deployment! This guide is aimed at beginners who want to get started with the Helium Mobile Network. Here you'll learn step by step how to find profitable locations, install hotspots,talk to hosts, and operate successfully long-term.

**Important:** This guide exclusively covers the **mobile side** (WiFi/5G hotspots) of Helium, not the IoT LoRaWAN hotspots.

# 2. What is Helium Mobile?

Helium Mobile is a decentralized mobile network based on WiFi hotspots. As a hotspot operator (deployer), you provide mobile coverage and earn HNT tokens for it.

# How Does It Work?

**Carrier Offload - The Magic Behind the System:** Major US mobile carriers like AT&T and T-Mobile route their customers' data traffic through your hotspots. The special thing: Their customers connect automatically without knowing it! Every modern smartphone with an AT&T or T-Mobile contract connects automatically. Customers of Helium Mobile (the own mobile brand, not to be confused with the Helium Mobile Network) also use your hotspots. The connection happens through Passpoint/Hotspot 2.0 technology completely seamlessly in the background - without logging in through some weird WiFi login page.

**Important Difference from IoT/LoRaWAN:** Unlike Helium IoT/LoRaWAN miners, where you needed special sensors, Helium Mobile works with every modern smartphone. No special devices needed - every reasonably current phone with an AT&T, T-Mobile, or Helium Mobile contract connects automatically.

# Earning Potential

You earn primarily through Data Offload, meaning through actually transmitted data from AT&T customers, T-Mobile customers, and Helium Mobile subscribers. Your location determines how much money you earn with it. Remember: **Location is king.**

# 3. Location Selection

The most important principle of all: The location determines the success or failure of your deployment. A perfect location can earn 100x more than a bad one.

The Helium Mobile Hotspot is not a magic money-printing machine that you just put in your storage room and it automatically produces money. The rewards distributed to hotspot deployers have to come from somewhere - and they come from AT&T, T-Mobile, and other carriers. But these carriers only pay for data that actually provides added value. They don't pay for data that could just as easily be transported over home WiFi.

Only when your hotspot is where carrier customers really need and use it does your deployment get refinanced through the network and ensure that your rewards are reliable and secured long-term. Anything else would make the whole system uneconomical and dubious.

# ‚ö†Ô∏è NO Money to be Made with Home Deployments!

The reasons are simple: Most people have their own WiFi at home. Why would smartphones connect to your Helium hotspot when their own WiFi is available? Smartphones prefer known, saved networks. And even if you point the hotspot out the window at the entrance of a bar directly across the street - in most cases the signal won't be good enough there anymore. Walls, windows, and distance weaken the signal significantly. Neighbors are at home on their own WiFi, passersby walk past but don't linger, and there's insufficient data transmission for attractive rewards.

Exceptions prove the rule, but in most cases it makes more sense to approach the neighboring business owner. If you're unsure whether your deployment might be an exception, ask here on Reddit beforehand to prevent later disappointment.

# Basic Principles for Good Locations

* **High foot traffic (footfall)** \- the more visitors, the better
* **NOT moving people** (cars, fast traffic) - the system isn't designed for that
* The longer people stay, the more data can be transmitted
* Placement like normal WiFi - the same rules apply
* Urban areas are more profitable than rural ones because more potential users in a smaller area

# Location Selection - Step by Step

It's generally advantageous if you scan your own area - where you know your way around. This makes location selection much easier because you know which businesses are well-visited, where people gather, and which business owners might be open to new ideas. But it's also no problem if you're not familiar with an area. You can work with several tools to identify profitable locations.

**Pro Tip:** If you have a smartphone with an AT&T or T-Mobile contract yourself, you can walk into businesses nearby and check the signal strength on your phone. Poor reception inside = perfect opportunity for a hotspot deployment. However, Helium World with the marked purple areas should always be your first step to ensure you're in a carrier-desired zone.

**Step 1: Helium World - Finding the Purple Zones**

https://preview.redd.it/py8nu1zsnwtf1.png?width=2463&format=png&auto=webp&s=0b6f06add4ccfc1878543e0afb3eb6f0cecf7bd3

Website: [https://world.helium.com](https://world.helium.com) (select ""Mobile"" tab)

Always start with Helium World. Here you see the purple/violet areas on the map (click ""Expansion Zones"" at the bottom right, then select ""POC Reward Multiplier"") - these are the zones where the carriers (AT&T, T-Mobile, Movistar) want coverage. These Purple Zones are your target areas.



**‚ö†Ô∏è Critically important:** Anyone who deploys hotspots outside the Purple Zones must expect to generate no data transfer = no rewards. The carriers only pay for coverage in the areas they actually need.

In Helium World, some restaurants, shops, and businesses are already marked, but far from everything. The map gives you an initial orientation of where it's worth looking more closely.

**Step 2: Using Google Maps for Detailed Analysis**

Take the map section from Helium World and open the same area in Google Maps. Also use Street View to get a better picture and scout locations. The basic principles are listed above. Examples include:

* Caf√©s, restaurants, clubs and bars
* Gyms
* Malls (you don't need to cover the entire mall - a well-positioned small store or kiosk is sufficient and can be very successful), strip malls
* Sports bars
* Indoor playgrounds / after-school programs
* Auto repair shops / mechanics
* Car washes
* Barber shops / hair salons, nail salons
* Laundromats
* Doctor's offices / dentist waiting rooms
* UPS stores (typically have poor cell coverage, and customers need to use their phones both while waiting in line and when dropping off packages)
* Commercial parking lots

These are just examples based on experiences from existing deployers. If you think logically and take a closer look at your surroundings, you'll certainly discover many other suitable locations.

**Example: Location Scouting Walkthrough**

Let's walk through a real example to demonstrate the scouting process:

**Check Helium World for Purple Zones:** We start by identifying purple coverage zones on Helium World. Oklahoma City shows extensive purple coverage, making it a promising area for deployments (see above in step 1).

**Zoom into a Smaller Area:** We select a smaller map section within the purple zone and open the same area in both Helium World and Google Maps. In Google Maps, we can identify two potential locations in close proximity: REV Mex Mexican restaurant and Sunnyside Diner (marked with red circles). Both are in a commercial plaza with visible parking areas.

https://preview.redd.it/5386n76vnwtf1.jpg?width=1920&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=129a6e9a8ff509db03092fddb80766dd7b5f2437

**Verify on Helium World** In the zoomed-in Helium World view (Image 2), we confirm both locations are within the purple coverage zone.

**Use Street View for Visual Confirmation** Finally, we use Google Street View to get a ground-level perspective.

https://preview.redd.it/moxujj9xnwtf1.jpg?width=3044&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=d71d5e182fc65598129468f1c7c3995299a80d3b

They're in the purple zone, have foot traffic, and are clearly commercial establishments where customers spend time. Either would be worth approaching for a hotspot deployment.

This process takes just a few minutes per location and helps you identify promising spots before ever leaving your home.

You can also check existing hotspot deployments on Helium World to see which types of locations are performing well. Look at hotspots that are already transferring data and approved by carriers - this shows you what successful deployments look like and can guide your own location selection. If you see hotspots at similar business types (restaurants, gyms, etc.) that are actively earning rewards, those are strong indicators for your own deployment strategy.

**Step 3: Going On-Site (optional, but recommended)**

Ideally, you go yourself and get your own impression. Nothing replaces personal impression.

Keep in mind: Larger locations (chains like McDonald's or KFC) bring more rewards but are harder to get. For these locations, there's also the option of Brownfield deployments (Helium Plus), where you use existing professional WiFi equipment from Ubiquiti, Aruba, Cisco, Meraki, Ruckus, and other manufacturers already in place at the business. However, Brownfield deployments are better suited for more experienced deployers as they require deeper technical knowledge. This may be covered in a separate guide.

**With smaller owner-operated shops, the rewards are lower but the chances to deploy are many times higher.** Both are worthwhile. **There are only two basic rules: Deployments only in the purple areas marked by AT&T and T-Mobile and business locations - no home deployments.**

# 4. Understanding Hotspot Types

For beginners, there are two types of Helium Mobile Hotspots: Indoor and Outdoor. These are also called ""Greenfield"" deployments because you're setting up new hardware.

# The Most Important Decision: Indoor or Outdoor?

**T-Mobile prefers Indoor Hotspots, while AT&T has no preference. If you want both carriers on board, then choose Indoor.** This maximizes your chances of getting data traffic from both major US carriers. Basically, the location should be decisive for your choice. Is your location a caf√© or restaurant? Indoor. Do you have a larger parking lot as a location in mind? Outdoor.

Anyone who wants to play it safe and place their first hotspot should start with Indoor. Installation is easier, the price is lower ($249 vs. $499), and most good beginner locations are indoor spaces like caf√©s, restaurants, or shops anyway. You can always add Outdoor hotspots later when you've gained experience.

# Indoor Hotspot

The Indoor Hotspot is a plug-and-play device for indoor spaces. You simply connect it to power and internet, do the onboarding, and done. The range corresponds to a normal WiFi access point - sufficient for most commercial indoor spaces. It's ideal for caf√©s, restaurants, retail stores, fitness studios, offices, waiting rooms, bars, and clubs. Everywhere people are indoors and using their smartphones.

# Outdoor Hotspot

The Outdoor Hotspot is weatherproof and built for outdoor use. It requires a PoE injector for power supply and must be mounted outside - either on the wall, roof, or on a pole. The range is slightly higher than the Indoor hotspot, but the difference isn't dramatic. It's suitable for city squares, parks, pedestrian zones, sports arenas, gas stations, large parking lots, bus stations, and similar outdoor areas. Keep in mind that only AT&T will use Outdoor Hotspots.

# 5. Contacting Business Owners (Location Pitch)

# Don't Mention Crypto

Avoid ""Crypto"" in the pitch completely. Instead, start by saying you can monetize their WiFi that they're currently giving away for free anyway. Simply say you work for AT&T, T-Mobile, and other mobile carriers - those are the names that matter. Helium Mobile (MVNO) is just one of the carriers and the smallest one at that. Honestly, business owners don't need to know the details, just that they'll make more money. Every business is in business to make money - that's the focus. As soon as you mention ""Crypto‚Äù,¬† you lose many people who are either confused or skeptical.

# Pitch: Show Them the Problem Live

Sometimes the best pitch is showing the problem directly. If you have a smartphone with an AT&T or T-Mobile contract, you can demonstrate the poor signal right there in their business. Pull out your phone, show them the weak signal bars, and say:

""Look at this - I'm on AT&T/T-Mobile and barely getting any signal in here. Your customers are experiencing the exact same thing right now. Every time they try to use their phone, check social media, or make a mobile payment, they're struggling. I can fix that for you - and you'll earn money from it.""

This visual demonstration can be a real door-opener. It makes the problem tangible and real, not abstract.

**Pro Tip:** If you know a location has poor reception, scout it beforehand with both an AT&T and T-Mobile phone to confirm. Then you can show them the issue with whichever carrier they use themselves. If you don't have both contracts, you can also ask them to check their own phone's signal - they'll likely confirm it's weak.

# Pitch: Better Reception = Longer Dwell Time = More Revenue

""Your customers already have mobile service on their phones - they don't have to mess with WiFi passwords. The problem: 80% of mobile traffic happens inside buildings, but the coverage there is often far too weak. I make sure the signal is strong enough indoors so that mobile payments, orders, and apps work smoothly. This means for you: Your customers stay longer in the store when they have good reception - and that directly increases your revenue. And on top of that, you can earn directly from providing mobile coverage.""

# Pitch: Bring the Hotspot Directly to the Pitch

The most effective method for beginners is showing up in person. The crucial trick: Bring your complete deployment equipment - hotspot, cables, mounting materials in a bag. Most people don't understand what a ""hotspot"" is, but when you put the physical device on the table, it suddenly becomes real and tangible. The host sees that it's small and unobtrusive.

This allows you to close the deal the same day - not ""I'll come back later,"" but direct installation or appointment for the next week. The momentum stays. When you can show the device and say ""It's secure, I pay for everything, and we both earn money,"" the close becomes much easier.

# Pitch: The Foot Traffic Monetization

This approach emphasizes the passive income stream through customers who are already there anyway.

**The Opening:** ""When your customers use your free WiFi, do you get paid for it? No? Well, I can make that possible. I can get the mobile carriers to pay you for most phones that come through your business. Does that sound interesting?""

**The Explanation:** You offer to monetize the existing WiFi that they're already offering for free anyway. The hotspots help turn the foot traffic in their business into revenue - for customers who are already there anyway using their smartphones.

# Pitch: Focus on Customer Experience in the Business

When you're talking to a restaurant or another place where customers sit down and spend time, then talk about how the customer experience improves. Customers get better connectivity, their smartphones work better, they can stream without problems, use social media, or make video calls - all things everyone expects today.

The difference from foot traffic monetization: For locations with lots of passing traffic but no sitting customers, it's about monetizing the foot traffic. But for restaurants, caf√©s, bars - everywhere people linger - the argument ""Your customers get better cell phone reception and a more stable connection"" is much stronger.

The phrasing: ""This improves the customer experience"" - because people automatically connect to better signal without noticing it. The host earns from it, and their guests are more satisfied and are likely to come back.

# Pitch: Start Where You're Already a Customer

One of the easiest ways to get your first deployments is to approach businesses where you're already a customer. The mechanic is simple: You already have rapport with the owner or staff, which makes the conversation 100x easier than cold-calling strangers.

**Examples:**

* Your barber or hair salon (70% success rate reported by deployers, even if the number is anecdotal)
* The restaurant where you regularly eat
* Your gym or fitness studio
* The caf√© where you get your morning coffee
* Any business where you're a regular and know the owner

**Why this works:** They have to listen to you because you're their customer. When you're getting your haircut, eating your meal, or working out, you have a captive audience. **Remember:** The worst thing they can do is say no. But starting with businesses where you already have a relationship dramatically increases your success rate.



# Pitch: Addressing Security Concerns

""I completely understand your security concerns - that's a legitimate question. Let me show you why your network is completely secure:

The device has a built-in security function that prevents anyone from accessing your internal network. No one who connects to the hotspot can access your cash register system, your credit card terminals, or your office computer. It's completely separated - like an invisible wall between the hotspot and your business systems.

The people who connect automatically - those are paying AT&T and T-Mobile customers with active credit cards. Any illegal activity would be immediately traceable to them, not to you.

Honestly, this is significantly more secure than normal WiFi routers from electronics stores. Those often allow connected devices to communicate with each other and thereby endanger your entire network. Our hotspot isolates every user completely - from your business and also from each other. This is professional security without you having to worry about it.""

# Pitch: No Costs, No Hassle

""The best part: You have zero costs and zero hassle. I cover the complete equipment, installation, and all ongoing costs. The device is small and unobtrusive, installation takes only a few minutes, and I do all the work. You literally don't have to do anything - except collect your share of the revenue.""

# Pitch: The Backup Internet Pitch

This approach focuses on a real problem of modern businesses - internet outages. Restaurants today use delivery services and tap-to-pay terminals that don't work without internet. An outage directly costs money.

**The Opening with the Pain Point:** ""Does your internet go down sometimes? How would you like it if I provided you with a free backup internet line at no cost to you?""

**The Summary:** ""I'm a telecommunications entrepreneur helping to offload carrier data. I can offer you a free backup internet line. This benefits your customers and your business, costs you nothing, and I do all the work.""

**The Justification if they ask why it's free:** ""We get paid by AT&T and T-Mobile, that's why I can offer this.""

**Important Limitation:** This pitch only makes sense at places where you can get a cheap second internet line under $100 per month and expect high data usage. You have to pay for the second line yourself, and that only pays off at really good locations. If you're unsure whether your location qualifies for this, better ask on Helium Reddit beforehand.

# Pitch: Free WiFi as a Selling Point

Helium Mobile Hotspots have an optional Free WiFi function that you can turn on or off. People without an AT&T or T-Mobile subscription can connect to it, but are first directed to a captive portal - similar to hotels when you want to log into the WiFi. There they have to enter name, email, and zip code before getting access. The Terms of Service they must agree to protect both the host and you from misuse. The whole thing is session-based: As soon as someone disconnects and comes back later, they have to log in again. This is an advantage over a simple password that you permanently share - here you have control and legal protection.

This can also be a strong selling point: The business owner gets a functioning Free WiFi infrastructure for their guests that they don't have to worry about - simply on top of the rewards. Many caf√©s and restaurants offer their customers WiFi anyway, now it runs professionally and the host also earns from it.

The pitch must be adapted to the location. These pitches are not 1:1 templates and can also be combined.

# Facts You Can Drop

* [30% of hotel guests don't return](https://hospitalitytech.com/can-you-hear-me-now-strong-cell-signals-strong-satisfaction) if LTE coverage is poor
* [90% of all buildings](https://www.boingo.com/good-stuff/in-building-cellular-connectivity/) have no indoor mobile solution
* [80% of mobile traffic](https://www.boingo.com/good-stuff/in-building-cellular-connectivity/) originates or ends in buildings

# 6. Installation

# What You Need

* Power
* Ethernet connection
* Minimum speed: **100 Mbps download** and **10 Mbps upload**

# Pre-Staging: Preparing the Hotspot at Home

Before you go to install at the business owner, you should prepare the hotspot at home. This prevents delays on-site and makes you look professional. Firmware updates can take several minutes, and you don't want to stand around waiting at the host. Make life easier for yourself and save yourself unnecessary stress - a few minutes of preparation at home make the difference between a quick, professional installation and a clumsy fumbling on-site.

Here's how to proceed: Connect the hotspot at home to power and internet and wait until the firmware update is complete. You'll recognize this when all LEDs go off and then come back on - this takes about one minute to a few minutes, depending on your internet connection. Then register the hotspot completely in the Builder App. Afterwards you can unplug it and take it to the installation.

The most important rule: Under an hour at the wrong location is completely fine - the system won't punish you for it. You don't get rewards during this time anyway, so it's ""fair game"" for initial setup. But don't leave the hotspot running at home longer than necessary, because extended operation time at the wrong location can attract the system's attention. There are anti-gaming mechanisms that detect suspicious location patterns, and you don't want to fall into this category.

Experienced deployers strongly recommend never doing the initial registration at the host. That looks unprofessional and wastes unnecessary time. Prepare everything at home, then you're done at the business owner in a few minutes. At the host's you just connect the hotspot, update the location in the app, and done.

# 7. Carrier Offload Approval

Carrier Offload is the heart of your earnings - this is where you earn through actual data transmission from AT&T, T-Mobile, and other carriers.

# How Does Approval Work?

After your hotspot is installed and connected, an automatic review process begins. AT&T, T-Mobile, and other carriers need about 2 weeks to approve your hotspot for offload. During this time, the carriers check whether your hotspot meets their requirements.

If you've done everything right, the probability is very, very high that after about 2 weeks data will be transmitted and rewards will come. You'll also see the carriers in Helium World then. ""Doing everything right"" means:

* Business Location (no Residential Deployments)
* Placement in the Purple area marked by carriers on Helium World
* Stable internet connection
* Hotspot is online and reachable

**Important:** Communicate to the host (your location) that there's this waiting period of about 2 weeks. Otherwise there's room for disappointment.

# No Guarantee, but High Success Rate

However, there is no guarantee of approval. The carriers ultimately decide themselves which hotspots they want to use for their offload program. But if you follow all recommendations in this guide, the chances are excellent.

If your hotspot isn't approved at one location, that's no reason to panic - the hotspot isn't unusable. Just find a new location, place the hotspot there, and the carriers will review again. Each location is evaluated separately, so a hotspot that was rejected at Location A can be approved at Location B without problems.

**Important: Communicate this to the business owner.** Make sure to explain that there's a review period of about 2 weeks and that, while approval chances are very high for good locations, there's a small possibility that the carriers may not select the location for offload. Setting realistic expectations upfront prevents disappointment and maintains trust with your host.

[See offload approval in Helium World](https://preview.redd.it/7f2rujt9owtf1.jpg?width=1940&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=7edfcf40375cf3bbd4942d1c8622a129123ad314)

**Currently in Development:** Helium is working on making the current review status visible so you know where in the process you are. So far the process runs in the background, and you notice approval when data transfer and rewards suddenly begin.

# 8. Billing and Agreements with the Business Owner

# The Basic Rule: Revenue-Share Based on Actual Token Earnings

The ideal revenue-share model should be closely tied to actual HNT earnings - even if payment is made in dollars. If you give the host cash, it should be the dollar equivalent of the percentage revenue share (e.g., 50/50 or 70/30) based on token earnings.

**Warning About Fixed Amounts:** Most deployers explicitly warn against fixed dollar amounts. This can put you in the situation where the transmitted data volume doesn't meet expectations, but you still have to pay a fixed price to the business owner - even if the hotspot earns hardly anything.

# Common Revenue-Share Models

**Model 1: 50/50 Split (most common)**

The standard in the community. You split monthly HNT earnings fifty-fifty with the host. Fair, transparent, and understandable for both sides. Both parties have the same interest in the location performing well.

When sensible: For most standard deployments where both sides benefit equally from the deal.

**Model 2: 70/30 Split (in favor of Deployer)**

You keep 70%, the business owner gets 30%. This makes sense when you invest significantly more or the location isn't particularly profitable.

When sensible:

* For more difficult or less profitable locations
* When you bear additional costs (e.g., internet upgrade)

**Model 3: 30/70 Split (in favor of Host)**

The business owner gets the lion's share. This is rare but sometimes necessary to secure a particularly good location.

When sensible:

* For premium locations with very high traffic
* To win over a hard-to-convince business owner
* When the location is so good that even 30% is very profitable for you

**Model 4: Service Model (No Revenue Share) - For Pros Only**

Here you give the host no revenue share but instead cover their internet costs or offer a free backup internet line.

Advantages:

* No monthly reports needed
* No tax complications for the host
* The host doesn't get ""greedy"" about your actual earnings
* You keep 100% of rewards
* The host can't simply replace you because they need the service

Disadvantages:

* You bear fixed costs (internet), regardless of how much the hotspot earns
* Only sensible for very profitable locations
* Requires experience to calculate costs correctly

When sensible: Only for experienced deployers with good locations where you're certain earnings significantly exceed fixed costs. Not suitable for beginners.

# Important: Both Sides Must Be Satisfied

You can choose the revenue split according to your individual circumstances. For long-term income, however, both parties should be satisfied with the rewards. A dissatisfied host/business owner will terminate the contract sooner or later.

# Payment: Crypto or Fiat?

**Fiat Payment (recommended):** Most business owners want dollars, not cryptocurrency. You convert HNT to USDC, send it to an exchange (e.g., Kraken, Coinbase), sell there to USD, and transfer the amount via bank transfer to the business owner. This means some administrative work, but is absolutely doable and the preferred method for most hosts.

**Crypto Payment:** If the host is crypto-friendly and has a wallet, you can convert HNT directly to USDC and send it to their wallet. This is faster and cheaper, but very few business owners are there yet.¬†

**New Solution in Development:** Nova Labs is working on a ""Reward Splitting"" function with ACH transfer directly to bank accounts. The host can then see their earnings and the agreed revenue-split ratio directly in the dashboard and, after identity verification, automatically receive their USD to their bank account. This will significantly simplify fiat payment and make the whole system more transparent for the business owner.

**Good luck with deploying!**

1o1dkso,https://www.reddit.com/r/tiktokcreatorclub/comments/1o1dkso/new_advice_anyone/,New advice anyone?,I‚Äôve been bouncing around content creation and similar aspects for a while now while balancing working 40-84 hours a week & wife + child. I‚Äôve now found myself diving into TikTok I started creating anime edits and a few of them kinda popped off for an unknown account ( top video 7.4k views) after realizing that I don‚Äôt have the time to create good edits as quickly as I‚Äôd like to stay consistently posting I have switched to starting a series where I post a small video of myself everyday and I‚Äôm currently on day 5. Needless to say this series is doing nothing at all yet but I was invited to start streaming on TikTok live and I have streamed a few times now while gaming. I find the streaming part very difficult as the only available time I have to stream is my only alone relaxing time of my days. My question is where do I go from here do I just keep posting my day videos and slowly get better at them and maybe one will go viral then snow ball off that? Or should I commit to streaming or both or find a specific niche for my videos any advice is always appreciated and if someone‚Äôs advice works wonders for me by chance I will definitely message you and buy you a coffee lol thx,1,1759937076.0,tiktokcreatorclub,0,1.0,False

My friends keep getting on me to get on a dating app now that I have been working out for a while and lost a bunch of weight and filled out in the ""right"" areas.

So I signed up for a few, Hinge blocked me because of a VPN (work related on my phone, I didn't know it was on). Tinder is just filled with desperate people it seems.

I researched and found Coffee Meets Bagel. I've done the dating app thing before so I set up my account, and it gave me a few suggested but I ran out and it said ""wait until Noon tomorrow!"" and gave me a cute little count down.

Great start I thought.

Today I open it and... I got zero suggestions after noon. When I do ""discover"" with the widest range possible, nothing. 

It seemed to show there were more people yesterday when it cut me off and I live in a fairly sized city.

But I haven't had the app for more than 16 hours and outside of the few people that popped up, I have seen nothing.

I am debating just going out on the weekend and seeing who is around instead of using apps as they all seem weird or have dumb issues.

Is this what I should expect as a regular experience with Coffee Meets Bagel? And if so, is it better if I pay for their whatever I can pay for?

I'm finally visiting your amazing city next week, but I only have two full days. I've done a lot of research, but everything I find points to the same popular tourist spots.

I'm looking for a different, more authentic experience. I want to see the Tbilisi that you, the residents, live in every day.

My dream is:

To drink wine (cha-cha!) in a real, no-frills taverna where the locals go, not the fancy tourist ones on Shardeni Street.

To have my morning tea or coffee in a simple, old-school spot, maybe in a Soviet-era neighborhood, the kind where a retired commrade :) would go for his morning routine.

To just wander and feel the real pulse of the city.

My rough plan:

On the first morning, I plan to rent a scooter and just explore. So, my questions for you are:

Which neighborhoods should I focus on? I'm thinking of areas like Marjanishvili (I've heard it's cool and local), Chughureti (for the architecture), or maybe places further out that I don't know about. Are these good choices for what I'm after?

Can you recommend specific, non-touristy spots?

A classic, authentic pubs, tavernas for a long, wine-filled lunch or dinner.

A simple, Soviet-era style breakfast/tea house for the morning.

Any other hidden gems a local bakery, a great street for a scooter ride, a fantastic local market.

Thank you so much in advance!

1o1dgyd,https://i.redd.it/kqdrzt2snwtf1.png,Her fianc√© Isaac was cheating,"Isabella froze outside the fitting room in the bridal shop, witnessing her future husband with another woman.



""Zac... who looks better in this wedding dress? Me or your fianc√©e?"" The woman's voice was breathy, taunting.



""You, of course."" Isaac's voice was husky, dripping with desire. ""Can't you tell how crazy I am about you? Isn't that proof enough of your charm?""



Satisfied with his response, the woman let out a sultry laugh. ""I want you to remember me forever. During your wedding, on every anniversary‚Äîyou'll always think of what we did here, of me.""



Their muffled moans echoed through the walls as Isabella stood frozen, feeling as if she'd been plunged into an ice-cold abyss.



‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî



Everything clicked into place. Isaac, who had always portrayed himself as a devoted family man, had suddenly started taking frequent ""business trips"" in the weeks before their wedding. Now she realized those were just excuses to meet his mistress.



With bile rising in her throat, Isabella stumbled away from the fitting room and fled to her car.



For seven years, they'd been both lovers and business partners, pouring their hearts into building Distant Vision from scratch.



Her sister, Hannah Carter, had warned her about Isaac.



Isabella unlocked her phone and stared at Hannah's message:



\[None of the Carters will attend your wedding to Isaac. Take care of yourself.\]



With tearful eyes, Isabella replied: \[I'm calling off the wedding anyway.\]



It took a while for Hannah to respond: \[Prove it. Come home to Washington next month or we're done.\]



Isabella simply replied with an ""Okay"" and put away her phone.



She started the car and drove off. Just then, Isaac walked out of the bridal shop, his arm around his mistress. When he caught sight of the familiar license plate, he paused.



Before he could make a move, the car had already disappeared from sight.



Isaac pulled away from the woman, smoothing down his clothes as he regained his composure. ""I'll have my assistant take you home.""



""But you promised to take me shopping,"" the woman whined, her lips forming a petulant pout.



Isaac reached out and ruffled her hair, his eyes showing a hint of coldness that brooked no refusal. ""Be a good girl.""



The woman backed away, subdued, and followed his assistant without another word.



Isaac strolled over to his car. Glancing at his reflection in the car's gleaming surface, he saw a composed and dignified face, showing no evidence of his night's indiscretions. No one would guess what he'd been up to.



Back home, Isaac saw Isabella's car in the garage. She was sitting in the driver's seat, gazing at her phone.



""Been out?"" Isaac opened the door and tossed his suit jacket onto the passenger seat. He leaned in closer.



His black shirt was partially unbuttoned, offering a glimpse of his toned chest beneath.



He looked immaculate‚Äînot a single trace of the other woman's presence remained on him.



Seeing that she didn't say a word, he leaned in to peck her.



Isabella switched off her phone and raised her hand between them, creating a barrier against his advance.



Her tone was cold. ""You seem concerned about me going out.""



Isaac was silent for a moment before saying, ""Not at all. Go wherever you want. Just thought you might get lonely by yourself.""



He gently wrapped an arm around her waist and murmured, ""What's bothering you, sweetheart? Tell me.""



Isabella kept silent, her eyes as cold as ice, and stared steadily at his exceptionally good-looking face.



Just as he'd always done, Isaac could instantly sense that she was in a bad mood. He'd figure out what was bothering her, fix the problem, and always offer the perfect words to comfort.



Isabella turned away, her voice eerily calm. ""You've been so busy lately, Isaac."" She paused, each word measured and cold. ""Maybe we should just call off the wedding. Wouldn't want to interfere with your... commitments.""



Isaac's jaw tightened as rage coursed through him. Isabella's decision was absurd‚Äîdidn't she understand? He was a public figure now. A last-minute wedding cancellation was unthinkable.



""What did you just say?"" He snapped, his voice laced with anger.



Isabella locked eyes with him. ""The wedding needs to be called off. I wouldn't want to overburden your... busy schedule.""



As she turned to leave, Isaac grabbed her arm in a flash.



The anger in his eyes was palpable. ""Everything I do‚Äîevery single thing‚Äîis for our company, our future! What about our children? Do you want them starting life with nothing?



""I've barely stepped off the plane, and instead of showing an ounce of concern, you're acting like a spoiled child. Since when did you become so unreasonable?""



Isabella met his gaze unflinchingly, a bitter laugh threatening to escape her throat.



Who was this stranger before her? The man she'd loved had vanished, replaced by a typical cheater who twisted his own betrayal into her fault.



The audacity of it all‚Äîhow he acted as if she had somehow driven him into another woman's arms.



Isabella said nothing, her mind already calculating. Two months until the supposed wedding. Her sister had given her one month to settle everything here. That was all she needed‚Äîthirty days to erase Isaac from her life completely.



Without a word, Isabella headed upstairs, into the bathroom to wash up.



Isaac followed and embraced her from behind, his voice gentle with remorse.



""I know I messed up, Bella. Work's been crazy, but that's no excuse for neglecting you. I'll clear my schedule‚Äîno meetings, no late nights. I'll come straight home, I promise.""



Isabella raised her eyes to the mirror, watching his reflection with a bitter smirk as he attempted to charm his way out of this with honeyed words.



A mocking smile tugged at the corner of her lips. ""Why bother? I...""



Before she could finish, Isaac's phone rang, playing a sweet romantic song that had recently become popular.



She remembered early in their relationship, back when the company was just starting, begging him to use their favorite duet as his ringtone. ""Too unprofessional for clients,"" he'd declined.



Now she knew the truth. It wasn't about professionalism at all. She just hadn't been the right person to make him change it.



Isaac glanced at the phone and hung up right away. ""Scam call.""



Isabella pressed her lips. She'd clearly seen the caller ID: \[181Second\]. She just let out an ""Oh"" and said nothing more.



The phone rang again. Isaac hung up, but it kept ringing. Finally, he turned around and answered it.



Hanging up, he then told Isabella, ""I've got some critical projects at the office right now,"" he said, his tone businesslike.



""I'm completely swamped. You understand, don't you? I'll be working late tonight, but I promise to be back early tomorrow for the dress fitting."" He paused. ""Don't stay up waiting‚Äîjust get some sleep.""



Isabella kept her eyes fixed on the sink, mechanically brushing her teeth. Through the mirror's reflection, she watched his silhouette disappear through the bathroom door.



Once he was gone, she searched ""181 seconds"" on her phone.



One result stood out from the rest: ""People say love lasts only three minutes, but you're my 181st second‚Äîthe moment I knew you were different.""



With an aching heart, Isabella opened the real estate app and listed their luxury villa for sale.



In just one month, she'd be back in Washington, leaving this life behind. The wealth, the success, the empire they'd built in New York‚Äînone of it mattered anymore.



She was ready to walk away from it all, including Issac, the man she'd once thought was her forever.



....



She listed the villa well below market value, slashing hundreds of thousands off the price. Within hours, her inbox was flooded with messages from eager buyers.



By the time Isabella finished replying to all those inquiries, it was already the dead of night.



Wide awake, she mindlessly scrolled through a trending women's app she'd recently downloaded.



A post caught her eye.



\[My boyfriend's getting married in two months, but today we had intercourse in his fianc√©e's wedding dress at the bridal shop! The thrill was intoxicating!\]



The comment section exploded with outrage, users condemning the post and praying it would somehow reach the unsuspecting fianc√©e.



Isabella's fingers shook as she tapped on the profile.



Heart pounding, she scrolled to the very bottom‚Äîto the first post. No words, just one image.



Two hands entwined.



Her blood ran cold. That mole on the index finger, that ring on the fourth‚Äîshe'd know them anywhere. They were Isaac's.



The photo was posted six months ago, only a week away from the day Isaac proposed to her.



Isabella stared blankly at the matching ring on her own ring finger, a wave of nausea welling up inside.



Without hesitation, she yanked off the ring and dropped it into the toilet, watching it disappear with one decisive flush.



Like trust, once something was tainted, there was no salvaging it.



The poster quickly updated her status.



Gone was her earlier smugness, replaced by a desperate plea:



\[Stop attacking me, please. We have an arrangement. In a month, I'll step aside completely and let him return to his fianc√©e.\]



The photo showed a man's bare back against white sheets‚Äîa sight so achingly familiar that Isabella's heart thundered against her ribs. She'd know those shoulders anywhere.



Let him return?



Ha...



Now she understood why people laugh when there's nothing left to say.



....



Isaac didn't come home all night. He called her early in the morning, no explanations, just telling her to meet him at the bridal shop.



At the bridal shop, Isabella arrived a few minutes earlier.



Her wedding dress hung pristine in the third-floor VIP showroom, its pure white elegance seemed untouched by the ugliness of reality.



""Ms. Carter,"" the boutique consultant spoke softly, her eyes filled with gentle concern, ""Mr. Lewis is on his way. Why don't we get you into your dress? You'll take his breath away when he walks in."" Behind her professional smile, there was unmistakable sympathy‚Äîas if she knew something Isabella didn't.



Isabella remained calm and refused, saying, ""No thanks.""



She just felt sick at the thought.



Right then, a hand suddenly wrapped around her waist and pulled her close. The familiar scent mixed with the fragrance of body wash filled her nostrils.



""Why not? Bella, do you know how long I've been waiting for this day? Will you put it on for me?""



Isabella cast a side glance at him. He looked fresh and well-rested, showing no signs of having worked overtime all night. A cold smile crept onto her face.



Isaac wasn't alone. Not far behind him stood a young girl.



She was wearing a pair of light-blue jeans and a simple white shirt, with a sweet smile on her face, looking innocent and charming.



Isabella looked past Isaac and fixed her icy gaze on the girl.



Was this another part of their sick game to chase their ""intoxicating thrill""?



Isaac caught her staring and tightened his hold on her waist, his face a mask of casual indifference.



""She's just a junior executive from one of our partner companies,"" he said smoothly. ""Actually reminds me of you when we first met. Thought you two might hit it off.""



Isaac waved at the girl over there, and she trotted over excitedly, reaching out her hand to Isabella.



""Hi, Isabella. I'm Grace Allen. So nice to meet you!"" Grace extended her hand, her smile radiant.



Isabella deliberately ignored the outstretched hand, her eyes sliding away with calculated indifference. ""What a lovely name. I imagine men find it hard to resist someone as... charming as you.""



Grace caught the sarcasm and looked a bit hurt. ""Are you calling me a flirt?""



Isabella felt Issac's grip around her waist tighten painfully. She shot him a cold glare.



He eased his hold slightly, leaning in to whisper, ""Save it for home if you're angry, Bella. The girl's shy- don't make a scene here. Let's get you into that wedding dress.""



The staff regained their composure and carefully removed the wedding dress from the mannequin, gesturing for Isabella to try it on.



Isabella caught Grace's gaze fixated on the gown, her eyes gleaming with undisguised longing.



A disdainful glint flashed in her eyes as she spoke up, ""Do you like it?""



Without a second thought, Grace blurted out, ""Yeah, I do."" She then stole a cautious look at Isaac.



Seeing a chill in his eyes, she added timidly and enviously, ""But it doesn't matter. Not everyone's as fortunate as you, Isabella. Some of us... some of us don't get to wear our dream dress or marry the person we love.""



Her head bowed low, shoulders slumping with unmistakable dejection and heartache.



""I'm feeling rather unwell today,"" Isabella said coolly, casting a sidelong glance at the stoic man beside her before addressing the staff. ""She appears to be my size. Have her try it on for me.""



The mere thought of touching a dress they had defiled made her stomach turn.



The staff members exchanged uncertain glances before turning to Isaac for guidance.



Isaac loomed over Isabella, his expression darkening.



Grace wasn't shy at all. She stepped forward with her characteristic sugary smile. ""Of course! I'd be more than happy to help Isabella by trying it on.""



She reached eagerly for the gown.



The staff stood frozen, their eyes darting between the dress and Isaac, silently awaiting his decision.



Isaac's dark eyes turned glacial, his expression hardening into something dangerous, an unspoken threat burning in his gaze.



Grace bit her lip nervously, her earlier boldness crumbling.



Isabella removed his hand from her waist, settled on the sofa, and urged, ""Go ahead.""



Then, Grace regained her smile, took the dress from the staff, and headed into the fitting room.



Isaac frowned and sat down next to Isabella. Just as he was about to voice his disapproval, Isabella looked up at him, half-smiling, and said, ""Aren't you going in to help her?""



Everyone froze at her words.



The staff who had witnessed Isaac and Grace yesterday struggled to contain their shock.



Thank heavens they'd come to work today‚Äîthis was better than any reality show.



Isaac's brows knitted together, his lips tightening into a grim line. ""Isabella, what exactly are you suggesting?"" he demanded, tension evident in his voice.



""Nothing at all,"" Isabella replied with a smile. ""I simply assumed you'd be... enthusiastic to assist."" She turned dismissively to the staff. ""I'll have a coffee.""



The fitting room curtain swept aside, revealing Grace in the wedding gown. She stood there radiating innocence, her smile honeyed, her posture a perfect blend of shyness and grace.



The dress, though meant for Isabella, hugged Grace's figure as if it had been crafted for her alone.



Isabella glanced at Isaac's face, the smile on her face cold.



She asked him, ""Pretty, isn't she?""



Isaac scowled and refused to look in Grace's direction. ""Bella, what game are you playing?""

I just started working in a coffee shop who use two recipes for for their espresso. One being 18g, 24-28s, 55g yield double shots used for 12oz drinks, and the other being 18g in, 18-20s, 32g yield used for 8oz drinks. 

These were recipes recommended by the roastery that the shop acquires their beans from.

When the solicit for #2 came out, I assumed it was a disconnected anthology, but it seems like it is a serialized story where Nico recruits more people to her adventuring party to rescue Billy, Teddy, and Karolina.",5,1759936583.0,Runaways,2,1.0,False

#Reglas Generales de CafeteAR

**Bienvenidos a CafeteAR** Gracias a todos por unirse a esta comunidad. La verdad que no esperaba el boom tan grande y la cantidad de post y gente que se uni√≥ en apenas 3 meses. Ya era la hora de que escriba las reglas de la Comunidad. Cualquier idea o opini√≥n es bienvenida en comentarios. 

####Reglas de la Comunidad


1. **Rediquetta:** Ya saben de que Tarata, respeta a los valores de reddit, no digas cosas fuera de lugar. Etc. 

2. **Caf√© Caf√©:** Es una comunidad para hablar de **CAFE** en todas sus formas, post que no est√©n relacionados al Caf√© se borran. El t√© es bienvenido. 

3. **NOT COFFEE:**  Esta es una comunidad en espa√±ol, se hacen post y comentarios en espa√±ol. (Ya hay otras comunidades en ingl√©s) V√≠deos pueden ser en ingl√©s si tienen subtitulos.

4. **Respeto Mutuo:** B√°sicamente NO seas t√≥xico ni un elitista del Caf√© (snob) o como quieran llamarlo. 

5. **Politinga NO:** No se permiten publicaciones sobre pol√≠tica ni comentarios sobre pol√≠tica, etc que busquen desvirtuar el post hacia el bardo pol√≠tico. (Ya existen varias comunidades argentinas para eso) Ac√° se habla de caf√©. 

####Reglas para los Post/Comentarios

+ **Temas:** Los post deben estar relacionados al tema de Cafe o Te. (En todas sus variedades). 
+ **Flairs:** Los post deben usar el flair correspondiente (Ej: Si es un video debe llevar el flair de video independientemente de lo que trate) 
+ **Prohibido:** Todo post que endorce al Torrado esta prohibido y se borra, esta comunidad busca que los productores locales dejen de fabricar torrado y mejoren la calidad  (materia prima) de sus caf√©s porque literalmente PUEDEN. 
+ **Prohibido 2:** Post hechos para molestar, preguntas falsas (donde op ya sabe la respuesta) Ej: *""¬øhay realmente diferencia entre torrado y molido? ""*, o *""el caf√© de especialidad es lo mismo que la morenita torrado""* osea b√°sicamente post para generar bardo/flame est√°n Prohibidos.
+ **Falopeadas:** Eso, no hagan comentarios falopas sin fuente, porque desinforman a la gente o generan confusi√≥n, esto cuando dicen cosas como EJ: *El torrado da c√°ncer*, y tambi√©n cuando hablan de marcas y comentan cosas como EJ: *Cabrales, Morenita, La Virginia usan todos (o importan) el mismo grano pedorro de baja calidad*, si van a comentar as√≠ que sea con fuentes. 
+ **Low-Effort:** No den respuestas poco elaboradas, muchas veces vi en post de Consultas sobre ""x"" marca de caf√© y las respuestas son Ej: *""ese caf√© sabe feo""* osea WTF! es literalmente la respuesta de un nene que dice *""eso caca""* expliquen por que les parece feo/no les gusta. Den respuestas como: *sabor amargo muy intenso, sabor a madera, poco cuerpo, muy √°cido, etc*. 
+ **Low-Effort 2:** En los post sobre consultas, si estas NO son elaboradas, es decir si el post no tiene contenido (texto largo e im√°genes, etc) entonces esas consultas deben ir al sticky post de Consultas diarias. Caso contrario el post se borra. 

####Explicaci√≥n de los Flairs

+ **Caf√© del D√≠a:** ‚òï Es la etiqueta universal, b√°sicamente sirve para lo que no entra en las otras. 

+ **Significa Buen Caf√©:** üéµ Para publicaciones donde recomend√°s una marca/tostador o una maquina. Recomendaciones en general. 

+ **Consulta:** üôã Para los post de Consultas importantes. 

+ **Videos:** üì∫ Se usa para todo post qu√© sea de video independiente de lo que trate. 

+ **Memes:** üí© Se explica solo, es para todo post de meme, va con este flair. 

*Eso es todo por ahora. Si en el futuro se agrega algo, el post se ir√° editando.*

I have a Gaggia Classic Pro 2019.
It is modded with the shades of coffee PID and pressure gauge. 

I've had it set up for a couple of years. When I first set it up I noticed the motor would stall before reaching the 12 bar opv spring I had at the time when the PID and Motor were both drawing power. I switched it to the 9bar spring to avoid the issue. 

But now it's gotten worse and just about any load causes the pump to stall. It doesn't completely cut out but it will drop from 9bar to 4 or 5 and just stay there with very little flow. 

I've tried reseatting the wires to the pump and tightened the relay screws and checked for any loose connections but no difference. 

Any tips on how to proceed with troubleshooting this before I start replacing all the things until it works again?

Could it be scale related? Wouldnt the OPV engage from a blockage before the pump cuts out?

I'm Michael (Mike), 27 years old, and I live in Germany. I can speak English, German, and Polish (though I don't write well in Polish). I can be a bit reserved at first, but once I get comfortable, I'm all in and pretty much an open book at that point. I value honesty and loyalty, and I'm always trying to grow and improve. I'm pretty lowkey and keep it real.

**A Bit About Me**

* I'm a good listener, and I appreciate both deep conversations and lighthearted banter
* I like calm company‚Äîhanging in a voice call while we each do our own thing is underrated
* I'm into solo hobbies, but always open to trying something new if someone brings the spark
* I'm the type who loves to listen and be there for people, but I'll give advice if I can help. Sometimes just being present for someone is what matters most

**Why I'm Posting**

Lately, I've been stuck in my thoughts, and I'm trying to get out of the loop. Finding new friends is one way I think could really help me. I actually have close friends I've known for 12+ years, but they're all on the west coast of the US now, so timezones have been tough since I moved back to Germany. That's part of why I'm looking to connect with people closer to my timezone.

I am just hoping to connect with genuine people. I love daily conversations and just checking in on how someone's day went. Whether we're gaming together, watching something, or just chilling on call doing our own thing‚ÄîI'm flexible and easy going. Whether it's talking about life, vibing in silence, or sending random memes at 2AM‚ÄîI'm here for it.

I connect best with people who are easy going and non-judgmental. I struggle with self-confidence sometimes, so finding people I really click with can take time, but once I do, I'm all in.

**My Interests**

I'll be honest‚Äîmost of my hobbies are pretty solo. That's just how I grew up and what I gravitated toward. But I enjoy talking about them and hearing what other people are into.

**Music** has always been important to me. I used to make beats‚Äîmostly freestyle, trap, and phonk style‚Äîand I might get back into it soon. I'm all over the place with genres:

* Rock / Metal / Metalcore
* Rap / Underground Hip-Hop
* Trance / DnB / Phonk / Hardstyle

Always down to swap playlists or explore new sounds. Got a playlist that hits hard? Send it my way‚ÄîI'm always listening (coffee gets me through work, energy drinks fuel the late nights).

**Other Stuff I'm Into**

* YouTube deep dives‚Äîconspiracy theories, car builds, iceberg videos, paranormal stuff, space content (the drone situation and things like 3I/ATLAS have been super interesting to follow lately). I like keeping an open mind about these topics
* Binging shows and movies‚ÄîI'm into old comedies and action films, and I want to get more into horror/scary movies too. Always open to recommendations or watching stuff together
* Just generally falling down rabbit holes. If it's weird or fascinating, I'm in

**A Bit About My Life**

I work in an office right now‚Äîmostly desk work‚Äîbut I'm looking to get into IT since I know quite a bit about computers. When the weather's nice, I love getting outside and enjoying nature. And there's something about thunderstorms at night‚Äîjust watching the lightning and chilling‚Äîthat hits different.

I'm also slowly getting into working out, nothing crazy, just trying to be more active.

I'm a night owl, especially on days off and weekends. During the week when I work, I usually stay up till 11pm-12am. But on nights before my days off? 3-5am is my zone.

I used to have a rat and a goldfish, but sadly they passed ages ago. I don't have pets right now because I want to make sure I can give them the love and attention they deserve when the time is right.

And hey, if none of this resonates with you, that's totally fine. I'm always looking to try new things and pick up new interests.

If you're also craving something a little more real than surface-level chats, maybe we're on the same wavelength. Send me a DM or message‚Äîtimezone differences don't bother me (as long as they're not too extreme), so reach out anytime!",1,1759936255.0,discordfriends,0,1.0,False

1o1d1an,https://v.redd.it/mqrqhdwokwtf1,Common English mistakes you can actually stop making,"We all make grammar mistakes ‚Äî even advanced learners. The key isn‚Äôt just memorizing rules but *training your brain* to notice how real English sounds. Let‚Äôs look at a few classics üëá

‚ùå **He like coffee.**  
‚úÖ *He likes coffee.*  
‚û°Ô∏è **Why?** Third person singular (he/she/it) always takes **-s** in the present simple.  
üß† **Tip:** Repeat full sentences when you listen to English. After hearing *‚ÄúShe works,‚Äù ‚ÄúHe goes,‚Äù ‚ÄúIt rains‚Äù* enough times, your brain starts auto-correcting itself.

‚ùå **Let me to go.**  
‚úÖ *Let me go.*  
‚û°Ô∏è **Why?** After *let* and *make*, we use the **bare infinitive** (no ‚Äúto‚Äù).  
üß† **Tip:** Notice verb patterns in real contexts ‚Äî not from grammar tables, but from dialogue in movies or audiobooks.

‚ùå **Mens / Womens**  
‚úÖ *Men / Women*  
‚û°Ô∏è **Why?** The plural forms are irregular.  
üß† **Tip:** Make flashcards or small ‚Äúmini-dictionaries‚Äù for irregular plurals. Seeing them in sentences helps: *The men are playing. Those women are teachers.*

‚ùå **I don‚Äôt know nothing.**  
‚úÖ *I don‚Äôt know anything.*  
‚û°Ô∏è **Why?** In English, we avoid **double negatives**.  
üß† **Tip:** Read or listen to short, natural English daily ‚Äî stories, dialogues, social media captions. The more correct examples you see, the less likely you‚Äôll make this mistake.

üìö One of the best ways to fix these forever is **exposure** ‚Äî hearing and seeing real English in use.  
Apps like [Ewa](http://www.appewa.com) can help with that: you can read books, listen to audiobooks, and instantly check the meaning of any word you don‚Äôt know. You‚Äôll start to *feel* what sounds right instead of memorizing endless rules.",2,1759935888.0,EWALearnLanguages,2,1.0,False

Studying away from home can be super exciting, but it can also feel a bit lonely at first. We know it's not always obvious how to meet new people in a foreign country, where do you even start?                                                Here are some tips that have actually worked for us.

**üéì Go to orientation**   
  
Even if it's optional, swinging by orientation or the freshers' fair is a great way to meet other students who are just as new as you. Everyone's looking to make friends, so a simple hello can go a long way. Suggest learning the local language together, exploring the city, or grabbing coffee; it's an easy icebreaker.

**üì±Get your mobile sorted early** 

This one might be obvious, but having a working phone is key. In some countries, getting a SIM card can be tricky, so do your research early. Once you meet someone you click with, exchange numbers and follow up, plan a study session or a walk around campus. Small gestures make a big difference.

**ü§ù Join student clubs** 

Sports, hobbies, language tables, and cultural groups - there's something for everyone. Joining clubs is an easy way to meet both international and local students. You can also check out apps or groups like MeetUp or Facebook groups for internationals. It's also a fun way to meet people outside of classes.

**üè† Get a roommate or roommates** 

Livin with others is a natural way to make friends, assuming you're comfortable with it, of course. Plan weekly dinners, cultural nights, or potlucks. You'll meet not only your roommates' friends but also friends of friends, which makes your social circle grow quickly.

**üåü Explore together**

Invite your new friends to explore the city, try local cuisine, or attend cool events. Locals often love showing off their city too, so don't be shy about asking them to join. Shared adventures are the best way to create memories and deepen friendships.

Making friends abroad is an investment of your time and energy, but it's totally worth it. Stay open, be proactive, and enjoy the ride. Chances are, you'll make connections that last a lifetime!

I had not tested these 2 tabs yet i ingested them and for what next came sent me straight to the hospital.

it started off feeling super strong, like not your average acid trip strong, fractals pretty much everywhere and the applications on my phone animating and my walls peeling apart. but this isn‚Äôt what made it so bad, an entity in the form of fractals came to me and ran up my back into my ears through my mouth and explored me and it felt horrific. It started saying it liked me and even comforted me so i felt great at that moment up until it sent 1000s and 1000s of supersize cockroaches, flies, spiders, worms, maggots all over my mouth, face, limbs, floor, ceiling, ears and were covering my entire body and spitting goo all over me force feeding it to me and i violently threw up uncontrollably and was choking on maggots spiders cobwebs and spider eggs. sick all over the walls, my skin was decaying and saw my bones, ran out the house and saw 100s and 100s of people (it was 3am by the way) watching me laughing, fractals chasing me trying to kill me (i have never seen such visuals) and alien arachnids chasing me.

i called an ambulance barely conscious saying i‚Äôm dying and obviously they told me the ambulance wait was 6-12 hours so i woke my mum and her boyfriend up and to their horror their son was off his head on what he thought was acid. they got annoyed and just said i‚Äôm having a bad trip and should go back to my room but when they realised i was seriously unwell they rushed me to the hospital 1-2 hours away.

in this car ride, i began to hear them saying i have always looked crazy and how no wonder all my exes have left me because i look insane. then started talking about ‚Äúwhat if the car broke down, *click* that would be it for him‚Äù just death jokes and remarks on how i look and act. this obviously made my experience worse.
spiders were still crawling in my mouth and i had to bear with them chain smoking cigarettes.

when we got to the hospital we were told to wait, while waiting i was sick all on the floor, choking on my own stomach acid and chugging hospital water but was still dehydrated. i thought i was actually going to die, seemed like my mum and her boyfriend didn‚Äôt care they were casually drinking coffee and going out on constant cigarette breaks. i was on the floor shivering, crying, screaming and near seizing. 6-7 hours after waiting a doctor checked my heart rate and sent me straight back out on a wooden chair for another 3-4 hours. then a doctor came in and checked me then said wait it out and gave me a tiny sip of water (no electrolytes just a sip of water) and i had to wait another 3 hours to be discharged. on the drive back i was still tripping (i started tripping at 00:00 and now it is 14:00-15:00 estimated) and as i got home i was still severely dehydrated and screaming. i got put in my bed told to drink water but the water was not hydrating me at all. thankfully 1-2 hours later my brother got me electrolytes which practically saved my life and i slept.

now onwards to yesterday and early this morning, i am waking up every 1-2 hours with horrific nightmares of me dying and being force fed fake acid while my mum stared at me, and being left in the dark while everyone watches me. i feel like my hearts stuck in my throat too.

Here's a common question that pops up at the start of the recruiting season. 

# Do I really need to reach out to someone at every firm before applying? 

Short answer: **no, you don‚Äôt have to.** 

It‚Äôs *definitely helpful* to reach out when you can, but it‚Äôs **not a dealbreaker** if you don‚Äôt ‚Äî especially in the early rounds like October 1 apps when things are moving fast and firms are just starting to look around.

If you‚Äôve had time to talk to someone (an associate, alum, recruiter, etc.), that‚Äôs great! Brownie points ‚Äî it gives you a small edge and something concrete to **mention in your cover letter** (‚ÄúI spoke with X about their experience in Y practice‚Ä¶‚Äù). 

But if you haven‚Äôt? That‚Äôs totally fine. 

The majority of people apply *cold*, mostly because there are just way too many firms to apply to that it's basically impossible to speak to folks at every single one. 

Plus, you can often simply **update your application materials** if you end up talking to someone later by just emailing the recruiters basically ""hello, I have updated materials, please see attached"" and they should update your application no problem. 

If you can't network before applying, what matters more is that your materials still show genuine interest ‚Äî cite something specific about the firm‚Äôs work, an office initiative, or a recent article they published. 

If you're stuck, here's a post on [How To Send Cover Letters If You Didn't Network Yet For Early Big Law Apps](https://www.reddit.com/r/BigLawRecruiting/comments/1nqafpd/how_to_send_cover_letters_if_you_didnt_network/).

That shows effort *without* needing to have talked to anyone.

If you want to be strategic:

* Prioritize networking for **your top 10-20 firms** (the ones you really want and/or have the best shot at getting in).
* For the rest, apply first, and if you can later connect with someone, excellent, follow up and mention that you‚Äôve already applied ‚Äî that‚Äôs normal and appreciated. And if you can't find the time, it's okay! Remember this is just one more lever to pull. It's not a requirement, just one of those things that can help move the needle. 

TL;DR ‚Äî still apply early, even if you can't network just yet. Don‚Äôt overthink it. A thoughtful cover letter is more important than a forced coffee chat.

1o1cw9s,https://www.reddit.com/r/pdfhive/comments/1o1cw9s/what_are_animal_books/,What are animal Books?,"Hey everyone!

I wanted to share some thoughts on a book I recently revisited, and it got me thinking about how much incredible storytelling exists, especially when we look at our animal friends. If you're curious to explore more reads in this fascinating category, you might find some great ideas, including the type of book I'm reviewing today, by checking out resources like [What are animal Books?](https://pdfhive.com/what-are-animal-books/). It‚Äôs a wonderful place to start if you're looking for your next captivating read.

Today, I‚Äôd like to talk about *Watership Down* by Richard Adams. For those unfamiliar, it tells the epic journey of a group of rabbits seeking a new home after their warren is threatened. It's a story of survival, leadership, and community, filled with danger, adventure, and surprisingly deep insights into society and nature. Don't let the idea of ""rabbits"" fool you; this is not a children's book in the typical sense, though it can certainly be enjoyed by younger, mature readers. It's a grand saga that stays with you long after the final page.

### What Really Stood Out For Me

**The Characters:** Adams truly makes these rabbits feel like distinct, complex individuals. Hazel, the unlikely leader, is thoughtful and brave. Fiver, the runt, has a mysterious ability to foresee danger, often saving the group. Bigwig is the tough, loyal warrior. Each rabbit has a personality that contributes to the group's dynamic, and you truly root for them through thick and thin. Their motivations and fears are incredibly human, making them easy to connect with.

**The World-Building:** This is where the book truly shines. Adams creates a rich, believable world for his rabbits, complete with their own mythology, language (Lapine), and social structure. You learn about their customs, their gods, and their fears. It‚Äôs so immersive that you start to see the world from their perspective, understanding the constant threats they face from predators and humans alike. The detailed descriptions of the English countryside are beautiful, almost another character in themselves.

**The Writing Style & Pacing:** The language is quite beautiful and evocative, drawing you into their world with a steady, deliberate pace. It‚Äôs not a fast-paced thriller in the modern sense, but the tension builds masterfully. There are moments of quiet reflection balanced with heart-pounding escapes and battles. It feels like a classic tale being told, with a lyrical quality that really resonates. It certainly evokes strong emotions ‚Äì fear, hope, sorrow, and immense satisfaction.

### Anything I Didn't Quite Connect With?

Honestly, it's hard to find major fault with *Watership Down*. For some readers, the initial pacing might feel a little slow as Adams builds his world and introduces the large cast of characters. It requires a bit of patience, but I promise the payoff is absolutely worth it. If you're used to very quick, plot-driven narratives, this might feel a bit different, but I believe its depth is its greatest strength.

### My Recommendation

Yes, I absolutely recommend *Watership Down*!

**Who is it best for?**
*   **Fantasy Fans:** If you enjoy rich world-building, unique mythologies, and epic journeys, you'll love this. It's essentially an animal fantasy epic.
*   **Readers of Psychological Fiction:** While not overtly ""psychological"" in a human sense, the themes of survival, leadership, fear, and community dynamics are incredibly deep and thought-provoking.
*   **Casual Readers looking for a profound story:** If you're open to a slightly longer, more immersive read that will make you think and feel, this is an excellent choice.

### A Gentle Guide for New Readers

For those of you just starting your reading journey, or perhaps looking to tackle a classic or a longer book like this, here are a few thoughts:

1.  **Don't Rush It:** It's okay to take your time. You don't have to finish a book in a day or a week. Enjoy the process.
2.  **Find Your Spot:** A comfy chair, a quiet corner, or even a bustling coffee shop ‚Äì wherever you feel most at ease.
3.  **It's Okay to Take Breaks:** Step away, think about what you've read, and come back refreshed.
4.  **Embrace the Journey:** Sometimes, a book takes a little while to truly grab you. Give it a fair chance before deciding it's not for you. The rewards of a truly great story are immense.

*Watership Down* is a truly special book, a powerful reminder of nature‚Äôs harsh beauty and the enduring spirit of survival. It‚Äôs a book that has stayed with me for years, offering new insights with each reread.

I hope this has been helpful!

1o1cvv2,https://i.redd.it/aru4uft0kwtf1.jpeg,Worst song on Cyr.,"You know what? I‚Äôll die on this hill: Cyr could‚Äôve been a genuinely solid record ‚Äî if it started and ended with ‚ÄúColour of Love‚Äù and ‚ÄúWyttch.‚Äù Those two tracks are the life rafts in a sea of pastel synth sludge. ‚ÄúColour of Love‚Äù is the one moment where Billy actually sounds like he‚Äôs feeling something ‚Äî the synths shimmer, the drums breathe, the melody hits like he remembered how to be human again. It‚Äôs got pulse, swagger, and that rare SP alchemy where sadness feels cinematic instead of synthetic.

Then ‚ÄúWyttch‚Äù? Chaos. Absolute chaos ‚Äî in the best way. It‚Äôs like the band collectively said, ‚ÄúAlright, enough with the cyber-ballads, let‚Äôs burn a synth at the stake.‚Äù It‚Äôs messy, loud, borderline ridiculous, and I love every second of it. That‚Äôs the closest Cyr gets to remembering it‚Äôs a Smashing Pumpkins record, not a Tron soundtrack curated by someone in an existential crisis.

And then‚Ä¶ ‚ÄúBlack Forest, Black Hills.‚Äù

There‚Äôs atmospheric, and then there‚Äôs ‚ÄúI accidentally left the keyboard on loop while I microwaved leftovers.‚Äù Jimmy ‚Äî my man, my jazz-drumming demigod ‚Äî sounds like he‚Äôs been trapped in Ableton for days, kept alive only by coffee and Stockholm syndrome. Billy, meanwhile, is floating through the track like a ghost who‚Äôs just kind of‚Ä¶ tired of haunting people.

It‚Äôs five minutes of emotional beige. It‚Äôs the musical equivalent of waiting for a download bar to finish at 98%. Every time it starts, I think, ‚ÄúMaybe it‚Äôll hit this time,‚Äù and every time it ends, I feel like I just walked out of a fog machine with mild depression.

‚ÄúBlack Forest, Black Hills‚Äù doesn‚Äôt just drag the album down ‚Äî it builds a tiny anchor, ties it to Cyr, and drops it straight into the Mariana Trench of mid-tempo misery.

Final verdict:

‚ÄúColour of Love‚Äù: Transcendent, neon melancholy done right.

‚ÄúWyttch‚Äù: Unhinged and glorious.

1o1cury,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1o1cury,"This is my moodboard. What should my dominant, secondary and accent colors be?","Hi all, 


I'd like to give some concise details if it helps make a choice:


Decor styles: modern rustic


Function: transit area between hallway and future dining area; watching tv in the evenings (lighting will be important), cat area. 


Mood: airy, light weight, clutter free


I have not included furniture, only colors, because I have no idea where to start and I am pretty flexible. I just want to achieve cohesion, especially as the living room is quite open and it will affect decisions made about adjacent spaces as well. 


The house will come unfurnished. I cannot change the floor.


I currently already own the Tv furniture in the second picture, which will replace the existing one, so I am aiming to start from there. 


Besides that, I will purchase a couch, coffee table, wall decor, ceiling light + eye level lights, and a plant. The leftover space in the living room (see existing placement) is planned to be used for a large wall mirror and cat trees.


When it comes to the jute on my color moodboard, I am not 100% sure I vibe with it yet, I cannot see it mentally but I want some texture play (maybe the couch, and wall decor in the future, but jute is a terrible texture to me).

1o1cqii,https://i.redd.it/oof0n101jwtf1.jpeg,"Creating a CHURCH - Businesses & Hobbies, or Adventure Awaits?","So...I made ""Willow Community Church"" in Willow Creek (EA ID: Mobabyhomeslice for those who wanna check it out). 

I'm working on trying to create realistic game play for a church-going Sim family without using mods. I have all the packs except Enchanted By Nature, but I'm experimenting with what gameplay works best to stimulate  Sims 4 church. Here are the ideas I'm trying so far: 

Use the Club System from Get Together + Custom holidays from Seasons to create a ""small group."" The Seasons pack gives us holidays where you can do a rabbit hole ""attend service"" where you just click on the Sim and send them off to a service, and then they come back a short while later. The small group can then have activities like reading, debating, being friendly, eating food. 

Use Businesses and Hobbies to make the Church a ""small business"" with a ticket kiosk for entry (kind of simulates offering boxes), and then set activities like listen to live entertainment, and then have ""employees"" who give lectures and classes, sing/perform music, and maybe even a barista who serves coffee in the back. The only thing is... it's not really structured into a schedule, so all those activities will be happening on top of each other.

Use Adventure Awaits to have a regularly scheduled weekly gathering. With this type of setup, you can designate roles for things like Pastor, Worship Leader, Children's Director, etc...but with getaways, you HAVE to sleep over for at least 1 night. That's a whole 24 hr period of being ""at church,"" which is a bit of a long time. 

There are pros and cons to each of these options, for sure. I'm just curious what you guys have done and what's worked best for you in terms of functionality and what's most realistic. ",2,1759935233.0,Sims4,3,0.67,False

I dumped it all over the floor and brought the empty bowl to mama to show her. She made the sound again! I was so happy I couldn't stop laughing. Mama wasn't laughing though and she brought me up to my room and put me in my crib and closed the door without giving me a kiss or reading me a story or anything which I don't think has ever happened before?

1o1cjoo,https://www.reddit.com/r/amityuniversity/comments/1o1cjoo/are_you_searching_for_purpose_of_life_here_that/,are you searching for purpose of life ? here that is - Nibaddhah,"Practical Explanation ( For Example ) :- \`1st of all can you tell me every single seconds detail from that time when you born ?? ( i need every seconds detail ?? that what- what you have thought and done on every single second )



can you tell me every single detail of your \`1 cheapest Minute Or your whole hour, day, week, month, year or your whole life ??



if you are not able to tell me about this life then what proof do you have that you didn't forget your past ? and that you will not forget this present life in the future ?



that is Fact that Supreme Lord Krishna exists but we posses no such intelligence to understand him.

there is also next life. and i already proved you that no scientist, no politician, no so-called intelligent man in this world is able to understand this Truth. cuz they are imagining. and you cannot imagine what is god, who is god, what is after life etc.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

for example :Your father existed before your birth. you cannot say that before your birth your father don,t exists.



So you have to ask from mother, ""Who is my father?"" And if she says, ""This gentleman is your father,"" then it is all right. It is easy.

Otherwise, if you makes research, ""Who is my father?"" go on searching for life; you'll never find your father.



( now maybe...maybe you will say that i will search my father from D.N.A, or i will prove it by photo's, or many other thing's which i will get from my mother and prove it that who is my Real father.{ So you have to believe the authority. who is that authority ? she is your mother. you cannot claim of any photo's, D.N.A or many other things without authority ( or ur mother ).



if you will show D.N.A, photo's, and many other proofs from other women then your mother. then what is use of those proofs ??} )



same you have to follow real authority. ""Whatever You have spoken, I accept it,"" Then there is no difficulty. And You are accepted by Devala, Narada, Vyasa, and You are speaking Yourself, and later on, all the acaryas have accepted. Then I'll follow.

I'll have to follow great personalities. The same reason mother says, this gentleman is my father. That's all. Finish business. Where is the necessity of making research? All authorities accept Krsna, the Supreme Personality of Godhead. You accept it; then your searching after God is finished.



Why should you waste your time?

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

all that is you need is to hear from authority ( same like mother ). and i heard this truth from authority "" Srila Prabhupada "" he is my spiritual master.

im not talking these all things from my own.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_



in this world no \`1 can be Peace full. this is all along Fact.



cuz we all are suffering in this world 4 Problems which are Disease, Old age, Death, and Birth after Birth.



tell me are you really happy ?? you can,t be happy if you will ignore these 4 main problem. then still you will be Forced by Nature.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_



if you really want to be happy then follow these 6 Things which are No illicit s.ex, No g.ambling, No d.rugs ( No tea & coffee ), No meat-eating ( No onion & garlic's )



5th thing is whatever you eat \`1st offer it to Supreme Lord Krishna. ( if you know it what is Guru parama-para then offer them food not direct Supreme Lord Krishna )



and 6th "" Main Thing "" is you have to Chant "" hare krishna hare krishna krishna krishna hare hare hare rama hare rama rama rama hare hare "".

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

If your not able to follow these 4 things no illicit s.ex, no g.ambling, no d.rugs, no meat-eating then don,t worry but chanting of this holy name ( Hare Krishna Maha-Mantra ) is very-very and very important.



Chant "" hare krishna hare krishna krishna krishna hare hare hare rama hare rama rama rama hare hare "" and be happy.



if you still don,t believe on me then chant any other name for 5 Min's and chant this holy name for 5 Min's and you will see effect. i promise you it works And chanting at least 16 rounds ( each round of 108 beads ) of the Hare Krishna maha-mantra daily.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

Here is no Question of Holy Books quotes, Personal Experiences, Faith or Belief. i accept that Sometimes Faith is also Blind. Here is already Practical explanation which already proved that every\`1 else in this world is nothing more then Busy Foolish and totally idiot.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

Source(s):

every \`1 is already Blind in this world and if you will follow another Blind then you both will fall in hole. so try to follow that person who have Spiritual Eyes who can Guide you on Actual Right Path. ( my Authority & Guide is my Spiritual Master "" Srila Prabhupada "" )

I'm Michael (Mike), 27 years old, and I live in Germany. I can speak English, German, and Polish (though I don't write well in Polish). I can be a bit reserved at first, but once I get comfortable, I'm all in and pretty much an open book at that point. I value honesty and loyalty, and I'm always trying to grow and improve. I'm pretty lowkey and keep it real.

**A Bit About Me**

* I'm a good listener, and I appreciate both deep conversations and lighthearted banter
* I like calm company‚Äîhanging in a voice call while we each do our own thing is underrated
* I'm into solo hobbies, but always open to trying something new if someone brings the spark
* I'm the type who loves to listen and be there for people, but I'll give advice if I can help. Sometimes just being present for someone is what matters most

**Why I'm Posting**

Lately, I've been stuck in my thoughts, and I'm trying to get out of the loop. Finding new friends is one way I think could really help me. I actually have close friends I've known for 12+ years, but they're all on the west coast of the US now, so timezones have been tough since I moved back to Germany. That's part of why I'm looking to connect with people closer to my timezone.

I'm not looking for a big group or server‚Äîjust hoping to connect with genuine people. I love daily conversations and just checking in on how someone's day went. Whether we're gaming together, watching something, or just chilling on call doing our own thing‚ÄîI'm flexible and easy going. Whether it's talking about life, vibing in silence, or sending random memes at 2AM‚ÄîI'm here for it.

I connect best with people who are easy going and non-judgmental. I struggle with self-confidence sometimes, so finding people I really click with can take time, but once I do, I'm all in.

**My Interests**

I'll be honest‚Äîmost of my hobbies are pretty solo. That's just how I grew up and what I gravitated toward. But I enjoy talking about them and hearing what other people are into.

**Music** has always been important to me. I used to make beats‚Äîmostly freestyle, trap, and phonk style‚Äîand I might get back into it soon. I'm all over the place with genres:

* Rock / Metal / Metalcore
* Rap / Underground Hip-Hop
* Trance / DnB / Phonk / Hardstyle

Always down to swap playlists or explore new sounds. Got a playlist that hits hard? Send it my way‚ÄîI'm always listening (coffee gets me through work, energy drinks fuel the late nights).

**Other Stuff I'm Into**

* YouTube deep dives‚Äîconspiracy theories, car builds, iceberg videos, paranormal stuff, space content (the drone situation and things like 3I/ATLAS have been super interesting to follow lately). I like keeping an open mind about these topics
* Binging shows and movies‚ÄîI'm into old comedies and action films, and I want to get more into horror/scary movies too. Always open to recommendations or watching stuff together
* Just generally falling down rabbit holes. If it's weird or fascinating, I'm in
* Gaming (PC) - I play a mix of tactical shooters, survival games, and RPGs when I want to unwind

**A Bit About My Life**

I work in an office right now‚Äîmostly desk work‚Äîbut I'm looking to get into IT since I know quite a bit about computers. When the weather's nice, I love getting outside and enjoying nature. And there's something about thunderstorms at night‚Äîjust watching the lightning and chilling‚Äîthat hits different.

I'm also slowly getting into working out, nothing crazy, just trying to be more active.

I'm a night owl, especially on days off and weekends. During the week when I work, I usually stay up till 11pm-12am. But on nights before my days off? 3-5am is my zone.

I used to have a rat and a goldfish, but sadly they passed ages ago. I don't have pets right now because I want to make sure I can give them the love and attention they deserve when the time is right.

And hey, if none of this resonates with you, that's totally fine. I'm always looking to try new things and pick up new interests.

If you're also craving something a little more real than surface-level chats, maybe we're on the same wavelength. Send me a DM or message‚Äîtimezone differences don't bother me (as long as they're not too extreme), so reach out anytime!",2,1759934526.0,friendship,0,1.0,False

After a couple weeks of getting to know her, I asked her out over text but did not get a response. While it was disappointing, I didn‚Äôt give up, and spent Summer 2024 getting a gym routine and losing 30 lbs. We both go to the same church in our college town, where I saw her weekly in Fall 2024. I asked her out for coffee in September in person, where she said she was seeing somebody, something I did not realize before. I kept on seeing her at church, and in December 2024, asked if she was still seeing somebody, and if not, if she would like to get ice cream. Same response.

We‚Äôve both gone our separate ways since then. She studied abroad this past spring, and I kept on working hard in school and gym, and I got a technical internship with a major company you‚Äôve all heard of, which has spun into a full time offer. Now we‚Äôre seniors and I see her weekly in church again, and she‚Äôs still warm and friendly and talkative with me.

I‚Äôve gone on other dates since then, but no girl has ever made me feel the way I do about her. She‚Äôs been a catalyst for my own self-improvement. I just know I would make her happy, but I don‚Äôt know if I should approach her about dating again. I don‚Äôt want to come across as pushy. That being said, if she is seeing someone, you wouldn‚Äôt know it from her social media, she didn‚Äôt post anything for national bf day, and she‚Äôs never posted any bf for that matter, since I‚Äôve been following her.

Should give it another shot? Or should I move on? Would really appreciate your advice.

I started to put on a little weight second trimester and then after the GD diagnosis and diet change, I‚Äôve started to lose again. All in all I‚Äôm 32 weeks and up 7lbs total from my starting weight. 

I‚Äôm looking for advice on how to maintain/gain some weight. My fasting number is really good, but I struggle having carbs in the morning as it spikes me. Here‚Äôs a typical food day for me. 

Breakfast - 5% Greek yogurt, blueberries, pb powder, coffee with fiber. 

Lunch - chicken wrap with hummus, cheese and avocado

Dinner - salmon, asparagus, small amount of a potato

Snacks are usually charcuterie spreads, oikos protein shooters, deviled eggs, core power shakes, and protein bars. 

How can I improve this?? I can‚Äôt add in tree nuts as I‚Äôm allergic but open to any other suggestions. Thanks!

I went last night to look for the TOASTED ALMOND scent of Power Stick. We have four, but no almond. I have all 3 except Paradise Breeze. Island Crush scent is too faint, Amber Rouge is inaccurate (does not smell like BR540 or the other Amber Rouge things like body mist, body wash, etc). Brazilian Mist smells accurate! But the performance on the translucent solid of Power Stick has been a let down. I like the solids that are white like Native. The translucent brown solid has a tacky texture on my skin. No bueno. 

Revlon Colorstay Brow Mousse. I was not motivated to take the time and check the batch number on the internet to see its release date. That can clue you in on whether it is way past its prime. I assume the mousse formula will be dry and clumpy so I skipped it. I could be wrong though!

‚ú®NEW‚ú® Hair Milk by B-Pure. Got one to check it out. My store had a handful.

These hand sanitizers are exactly what I came for. Unlike the bottles of apple and pumpkin that came with red and orange holders, these guys had no holders. I think I have seen one of you post that the holders they come with these scents are sheer white with sparkles. 

Almond Vanilla is a familiar vanilla scent, no almonds. Not plastic, but not strong. The Mocha Coffee is not chocolatey or coffee-like but more like Sabrina Carpenter Sweet Tooth Caramel Dream. The same way Curations by The Good Scent Espresso Martini smells like Caramel Dreams, if you shop at TJ Maxx / Marshalls and know their unboxed fragrances. Also very faint.

**E**verything in the Dam, it seemed, was made of the same black metal: the high arches that ribbed the vaulted ceiling with shadows, the steep, almost menacing walls and all their alcoves and sculpted columns, even the floor was polished to a black shine. Even the light fixtures‚Äîrecessed bulbs and hanging chandeliers‚Äîwere coated in a thin, black paint.

Poire felt that he had walked these halls before, not so very long ago. These were the same black walls, the same polished floors of the Black Library, the Historians‚Äô home that once orbited Cyre. Everywhere he looked, the same brutal architecture soared up and swallowed the light.

Only, instead of Historians, with their squid-like heads, the people who walked these halls were human. Clusters of workers in gray and reflective orange ambled toward their next job. A woman in a white coat pushed through a throng of workers, apologizing as she rushed from one hallway to the next. She stopped only a moment ot consider her direction, silver augments flashing in her flesh as she looked left and right. A team of sweeper constructs, on their way to sweep and polish the alcoves, beeped softly around the edge of a crowd of milling scientists.

The Old Man stood just outside the crowd, obviously out of place in his metallic-shining clothes, yet invisible to everyone but Poire. ‚ÄúThis way,‚Äù he said, and slipped among the traffic‚Äîhis body melding through the groups.

But Poire couldn‚Äôt get his legs to work. Couldn‚Äôt tear his eyes away. Couldn‚Äôt close his gaping mouth. How long had it been? How long since he‚Äôd seen this many humans in one place?

Or this many humans, at all?

The hall was crowded with them, and more walked through all the time, as if being near so many humans was completely normal. As if this moment was not even worth noticing. Some carried cups of steaming liquid (*is that coffee? Do they all drink it?*), talking and nodding with each other. Some were bleary-eyed, or wore bored expressions. Some smiled, and some stopped to say hello. A ring of laughter came from down the hall, not one laugh, but many together, and Poire thought it was the strangest, most glorious sound he‚Äôd ever heard.

A man with a brown uniform and a mop resting on his shoulder whistled some song Poire had never heard. He bobbed his head back and forth, legs kicking a little in time with his music. A troop of assorted maintenance droids followed behind him, like some mechanical dance troupe, zigzagging around people‚Äôs feet. The people didn‚Äôt even look at it, as if they didn‚Äôt notice it was there.

It was all just so ‚Ä¶ alien.

*And beautiful.*

‚ÄúHey,‚Äù the Old Man‚Äôs voice cracked over the crowds. ‚ÄúDon‚Äôt get stuck. This isn‚Äôt what we came for. Turn left, and start walking.‚Äù

The Old Man was nowhere in sight, but his voice still echoed down the hallways. It seemed to fill the place, not echoing against the ceiling, but somehow coming down from it. Raining upon Poire like a force. None of the people looked up, or seemed to hear it at all.

‚ÄúWe don‚Äôt have time to do this all over again,‚Äù the Old Man said. ‚ÄúYou‚Äôre about to miss it.‚Äù

Poire started to push through the crowd, when a man walked right into him. Poire gasped, but the man‚Äôs body sank right through his. The only sensation was a subtle disorienting wrongness in the pit of his stomach. He tried to avoid the rest of the people, but there were so many of them...

It took every ounce of willpower he had to avoid standing there, gawping at each of them, studying their faces, the way they walked, the sound of their voices‚Äîor just their breath. All in one place. He sucked in his breath, and charged through.

A few hallways down, construction supplies littered the floor. Tall panels of the walls were missing, revealing immense, radiating collections of pipes and ductwork and wires running together in thick lines. A pair of constructs with swiveling heads and long, extending arms dug around inside one open wall, while a flying drone supervised their work. This drone was odd‚Äîit wasn‚Äôt powered by a repulsor, but by a whirring set of rotors that kept it in the air, hovering and buzzing like an insect.

‚ÄúEmorynn!‚Äù

A man was shouting down the half-dismantled hallway. Beyond the open panels and sheets covering building supplies, a man hammered his fist on a bulkhead door. ‚ÄúYou don‚Äôt know the risks! Exposure is dangerous, Emoryn! Are you listening? I know you can hear me!‚Äù

The door‚Äôs frame looked like it would survive the depressurization of the entire station. It was sealed shut, its massive lock engaged. The man was wearing a lab coat (spotted with burn marks and an old stain), wearing the frayed expression of someone who, after a long day of work, finds some great mess waiting for him back home.

The Old Man stood next to him, his hands clasped behind his back, patiently inspecting the man, like he was watching an animal at a zoo.

Without looking up, the Old Man said, ‚ÄúHis name is Astor.‚Äù

‚ÄúThis is *the* Astor?‚Äù Poire asked. ‚ÄúAs in, Sen‚Äôs partner? The one she waited for?‚Äù

‚ÄúOh, good. You remembered. Yes, this is the same Astor. The one who started the xeno-procreation program. And ‚Ä¶ the one who created us. You, and me, and all the children in all the Conclaves. You might call him our father. Or maybe grandfather is more appropriate.‚Äù

The man in the lab coat‚ÄîAstor‚Äîgave one last thump of his fist, and slumped until his face was pressed against the door. ‚ÄúEveryone is worried about you, Emorynn. Please. You need to let me in.‚Äù

Silence.

The man slammed his fist one more time on the door, as if to say ‚ÄúFine, you‚Äôre on your own.‚Äù And he marched off, fuming and muttering to himself.

‚ÄúHow did Astor know the First Prophet?‚Äù

‚ÄúThey met here. The First Dam. Most of the greatest minds of the last generation passed through this dam, at one time or another. Emorynn‚Äôs parents helped build the dam, you know. The material used to slow the radiative energies of the Light was developed by her own mother. Now‚Ä¶‚Äù The Old Man stood where Astor had been standing. ‚ÄúFor some, having a physical form is a curse. Fortunately,‚Äù the Old Man said, ‚ÄúNot us.‚Äù

The Old Man stepped *into* the bulkhead door, leaving a pale fog so thin, it was almost not there at all. *But if we‚Äôre not really here,* Poire wondered, *why do we leave a trace at all?*

Poire placed his hand on the door. He almost tripped (*on what?*) as it went through. Then, he slid his head in. Temporarily blinded by the thickness of the door, he stepped through. And then, blinded for another reason.

A great glass window was the only barrier between him, and the shifting, brilliant expanse of light. Jagged, almost geometric bolts crawled across the sky, like lightning in slow motion, folding back and forth and spiraling into a hexagonal eddy before shooting off at a hard angle. The way it moved, in stuttering stops and racing starts, made it seem as though it could ignore distance itself.

Glittering gas billowed from the edges of the slow lightning, forming clouds as wide as continents. And there, at the center of all that light and all that motion, hung the Scar‚Äîa wound in the fabric of space.

The Scar twisted with colors that flickered and warped through the spectrum of visible light, and beyond. Shades that should not appear next to each other fuzzed together, glowing brighter than the sun. Ever-morphing refractions‚Äîjagged polygons, or dripping cones, or other nameless shapes‚Äîrose in infinitely descending rings that made Poire feel dizzy just to look at. It felt as though the Scar was reaching for something.

Behind the glass, wires trailed down from suction cups, and fed into blocky, home-made appliances, probably built from scraps gathered around the dam. The appliances were arrayed in a semi-circle, with a nest of blankets tucked between the appliances and the sheer glass walls. Half-empty food packages and empty wrappers littered the floor.

Someone had painted in giant, white words on the glass, the word ‚ÄúHELLO‚Äù across one window. A paint brush stuck out of a bucket of long-dried paint. Underneath the letters, there sat a woman. Cross-legged, and hunched forward, with her forehead propped against the glass, as if she couldn‚Äôt bear to lift the weight of her body any longer. Her fingers dragged across the glass, weak and longing. Her hair hung in long, unwashed strands, dark circles ringed her eyes, and, judging by the stains on her clothes, she didn‚Äôt smell so sweet either.

‚ÄúAh,‚Äù the Old Man said, ‚ÄúJust in time.‚Äù

‚ÄúFor what?‚Äù

But the Old Man held up his hand to silence Poire.

‚ÄúI‚Äôm here,‚Äù the woman said, her throat rasping from overuse, ‚ÄúCan‚Äôt you see me? Can‚Äôt you know me?‚Äù

A bolt of geometric lightning dragged itself across the great void of space, slicing through the clouds of white fog. It stretched across the great void of space, questing for the Dam. But each time a tendril touched at the metal, some kind of reaction occurred, and the whole twisting, jagged stalk of energy collapsed faster than it had spawned. More bolts spawned in its wake, sprouting through the misty clouds that half-covered the Scar‚Äôs dizzying depths.

With the last ounces of her strength, the woman hauled herself up to one knee, though her whole body trembled with the effort. She thumped her fist against the glass, ‚ÄúI know you‚Äôre there! I know you see me! You see *everything!*‚Äù Her last words strangled in her throat, became a furious cry as she smashed her fist against the window, and then a yelp of pain. ‚ÄúTalk to me,‚Äù she sobbed, cradling her hand. ‚ÄúPlease.‚Äù

The bolts of slow lightning grew and grew, and touched the dam, and dissipated, making room for new bolts to fork out from the Scar. A silent storm, held back by a pane of glass. The only sound was the steady, unremarkable beeping from the appliances, and the girl‚Äôs ragged breath as she walked on her knees to one appliance (a box with a series of small dishes aimed at the Scar), and, standing on shaky legs, she flicked a switch off. Then on. The dishes flickered, their shallow bowls filled with a foggy, white light. Almost like vapor.

Her eyes flicked back and forth as readouts poured into her personal holographic display, visible only to her. ‚ÄúWhy not?‚Äù she said. ‚ÄúWhy doesn‚Äôt it do anything?‚Äù She flicked the switch off and on rapidly, her long, clingy hair shaking back and forth with the furious effort.

‚ÄúWork. Work, damn you!‚Äù

Her head jolted up, as if she‚Äôd heard a sound from beyond the glass. Poire heard nothing.

She screamed at the glass, ‚ÄúI know you‚Äôre out there!‚Äù

The flickering sound of the appliance‚Äôs dishes was her only reply.

She spread her lips, and clamped her jaw into an agonized grin, and threw her head back.

She didn‚Äôt see the clouds of mist, billowing from the Scar, tremble. It was an instant movement‚Äîimpossibly fast‚Äîas thousands of miles of cloud reconfigured themselves. Not disappearing, just shifting in a single jump.

She opened her eyes, as if she had felt something change. Her gaze fixed on the Scar, her pupils dilated, both pupils growing, then shrinking to two fine points, as if she was seeing something in the distance grow very, very bright.

‚ÄúOh,‚Äù she said.

Forks of slow lightning twisted together, wrapping themselves into bundles, melting into each other until huge columns of energy swirled like currents gathering in a stream thousands of miles long.

The stream leaped forward. It shoved at the Dam, and breaking and feeding into the Dam, shoving all its energy. Where it touched, Light and clouds blasted away like heat from a blowtorch. The lights in the room flickered. An emergency alarm blared. Black plates began to rattle from the ceiling, slowly covering up the glass window.

The stream was focused on her. It shredded itself on the Dam, becoming nothing more than a tiny, silvery thread that pierced through the glass with a singing, sizzling whistle. Radiating rays of light filled the observation room, becoming glittering mist as the silver thread twisted and touched the place between Emorynn‚Äôs eyes.

She gasped. Her body went rigid. Her fingers clenched at nothing. Her mouth opened in a rictus grin, and she hissed, ‚ÄúI see it. It‚Äôs everywhere. It‚Äôs everything.‚Äù

She laughed. She groaned. Her teeth clenched. ‚ÄúWait,‚Äù she said. She raised her hands to block the silvery string of raw energy, but it simply passed through her palms, as if it was made of something other than matter. ‚ÄúWait. Too much. It‚Äôs‚Äîit‚Äôs too much!‚Äù

Emorynn‚Äôs veins glowed through her skin. White tendrils of energy radiated from her feet, and licked out from the crown of her head. Glowing and white. Her body looked wrong in that light. Like she was herself, but she was also someone else. Many someones‚Äîan infant, a middle-aged woman, a pale corpse, dust. All Emorynn, all in the same place.

The silver thread of Light snapped. Emorynn, the real Emorynn, fell to the floor.

She did not move. Not even her chest. Her skin, once so pale, began to turn blue.

‚ÄúShe‚Äôs dying‚Äî‚Äù Poire knelt next to her, his hands passing through her shoulders. ‚ÄúWe have to help her!‚Äù

But the Old Man just held up a finger, commanding Poire to wait.

Emorynn gasped, her chest lifting off the ground as if she‚Äôd been hit with a jolt of electricity. Spluttering and sucking down air, she glanced around wild-eyed. ‚ÄúWhat?‚Äù she asked. ‚ÄúWhat?‚Äù

Poire struggled to form the same question. ‚ÄúWhat was that?‚Äù

‚ÄúThat was Anu,‚Äù the Old Man said. ‚ÄúOur alien. And Emorynn just made first contact.‚Äù

Based on the Amazon ""Prime Big Deal"" listing, the Keurig K-Express is currently available at a significantly reduced price.

* **Sale Price:** **$59.99  ...** [**https://amzn.to/4h1GFuh**](https://amzn.to/4h1GFuh)
* **Discount:** **45% Savings** off the original list price.
* **Context:** This special pricing is part of a limited-time sales event. Based on the discount, the original price of the coffee maker is approximately $109.07.

====================================================================

**Key Features at a Glance:** The Keurig K-Express is designed for users who value both convenience and a quality coffee experience. It is a compact and efficient machine that fits well in most kitchens.

Three Brew Sizes: You can choose to brew an 8, 10, or 12-ounce cup of coffee, allowing for customization of your coffee's strength and volume.

""Strong"" Button: For those who prefer a more robust flavor, the ""Strong"" button modifies the brewing process to deliver a bolder taste.

Large Water Reservoir: A 42-ounce removable water reservoir allows you to brew multiple cups before needing a refill, a convenient feature for busy mornings or when entertaining guests.

Fast Brewing: This model is praised for its ability to brew a cup of coffee in just a few minutes, with no pre-heating time required between brews.

She had a look of shock on her face, but I went outside. The helicopter never came and I cried, but even though I was extremely young I knew it wasn't my imagination even though I cannot recall where that thought, or idea came from.

Shortly after that I woke up in the middle of the night and smelled smoke. I woke my parents up and told them I smelled this strange smell. The humoured me, but instructed me to go back to sleep. I couldn't. A few hours past by and suddenly my dad raced in and ordered us out of the house. The furnace had just caught on fire and my dad always reminded me of how I saved all our lives and said that the fire couldn't have started when I smelled the strange smell. He believed I had a premonition and would swear to it.

I have also had extremely lucid dreams, travels, or whatever. About 30 years ago, a couple of years after my divorce, I had moved to a new city and with a new job, and made new good friends. I was over the trauma of the split and was excited and optimistic about my new life. I was in a good place spiritually and emotionally, finally. My new friends would gather at a coffee shop almost every afternoon. Sometimes there would be two, or three, but most afternoons as many as 8 to 10 would gather. We were all single. There was this lady I was attracted to and I strongly felt it was mutual, but I hadn't asked her out on a date yet. I left the coffee shop one day and made the decision that if she was there the next day, then I was going to ask her out. I arrived at my apartment and was tired. I laid down and almost immediately I was in her apartment that I had never seen. I want to emphasize......I knew I was there. I saw the furniture and she was next to the refrigerator. I walked over and gently touched her hair. It startled me and I ""woke up"" for lack of a better term. The very next afternoon she was at the shop ordering coffee and immediately walked up and told her of my experience. She turned ghostly white and asked me what color were her walls. I said ""yellow"". She immediately and angrily said, ""when I arrived home I had a strange sense someone was in my apartment to the point I had to stay with a friend! Don't ever do that again!"" I laughed and said, ""do what?"" She never spoke to me again.

These were all involuntary phenomenon, but I always remind myself to be aware and try to control it and especially remind myself that I'm not there physically. In these OBEs I always forget and seemingly go where ever it takes me.

Well, the other evening I was watching this popular guy in his field of unexplained paranormal stuff...very popular. However, usually I get an unexplained uneasy feeling about him. The other day I was in that ""twilight"" state of mind just before sleep and suddenly I was in this library type place. It wasn't in our physical realm and I was aware of what was happening. There were lots of other minds there, but they were ghostly physical and identifiable. He was there and immediately identified me and angrily said, ""what are you doing here?!"" I knew something nefarious was happening there. He threatened me physically, as if to frightene, yet I confidentiality said, ""you cannot hurt me."" He tried, and I laughed and said, '"" see you can't!"" I did not like it there, but I wasn't afraid either. I began to mingle through the crowd with him looking for me. I found the exit door and left. He is not a good person.

Okay....that's it. I wanna do more of this. It's incredible! I ain't crazy, so ......?",8,1759934004.0,AstralProjection,6,1.0,False

Back in April I (18F) came back home after living with my grandma for 7 months. During my time with my grandma me and my mom would keep in contact here and there but whenever we would call most the time she would be complaining about how I wasn‚Äôt home to keep the house clean so it wasn‚Äôt as clean as it used to be. Now to understand what the condition of our house is in you have to understand the type of person my mom is. My mom (as much as I love her) likes to start really big projects, like trying to build a huge dog kennel in the middle of our living room or emptying our pantry shelves just to try and build a pantry herself, only to get halfway through the project and not finish it. Our living room has no couch, a huge unfinished half built dog kennel, big unopened boxes, and just piles of random stuff that she keeps throwing everywhere. Our kitchen has a table but the table is covered in all her tools that she is ‚Äúusing‚Äù her her projects that she hasn‚Äôt touched in months. The kitchen is also filled with her pantry project filling up one huge corner of the kitchen, the stovetop and counters are completely covered with unopened mail and random junk that even when I sit there and try and make a dent and clean some it looks like I never touched it. These are just the common rooms of our house, i keep my room relatively clean but while I was at my grandma‚Äôs house she used my room as storage while she pulled up the carpet in the living room and put down some flooring and even now I‚Äôm still finding things that belong in the living room in random spots in my room. The shared bathroom is a complete mess and whenever I clean it, it just gets filthy in less than an hour (I‚Äôm not kidding, I don‚Äôt know how it happens). We do have a pretty small house and quite a few pets but even still I‚Äôm sweeping the house twice a day and scooping the cat‚Äôs litter boxes every other day. Now back to the reason I‚Äôm writing this. There are four of us living in here, me, my mom, my boyfriend, and my little brother. My mom, my boyfriend and I all have jobs because my little brother is still in school although I work the least and am home the most. So I don‚Äôt mind helping out around the house and helping to make everyone‚Äôs life a little easier. However, my mom has gotten to a point where she has been putting almost all house responsibilities on me (besides paying for the house). When my boyfriend moved in with us, both me and him had offered to pay rent but she said it was fine which shocked us but whatever. Since we weren‚Äôt paying rent we started to help out with groceries a little bit and helping some more around the house than we were before. After my mom noticed we started helping with groceries she stopped buying groceries for the house all together, so unless WE were to buy the groceries for the house we would have none. She also started spending more time at her boyfriends house which I have no problem with her spending time with her boyfriend (I mean mine lives with us) but it‚Äôs when she started staying with him for 4-5 nights at a time and had me waking up my little brother for school and making sure he got to bed on time. He‚Äôs my little brother of course I‚Äôm going to do it and make sure he‚Äôs at school but that‚Äôs also not my responsibility as his sister. There are a few small things that get on my nerve like her pouring her coffee grounds down the sink drain and leaving her dishes to pile up in the sink and getting mad when I ‚Äúlet the dishes pile up‚Äù, or when she leaves a water bottle full of milk in the fridge for weeks until it rots and still leaves it in there. But the finale straw was this morning when I was in the kitchen making my boyfriend his lunch for work. She‚Äôs standing right next to me and had just finished pouring her coffee grains down the drain and looks at me and asks ‚Äúhey can you try and clean off the counter/stove and take care of the dishes today before you go to work.‚Äù I don‚Äôt work until 6, but everything on the counters is her junk that she doesn‚Äôt know where to put it (so how should I?) and all the dishes in the sink are hers because I know all me, my boyfriend and my little brother know to put our dishes in the dish washer when we are done and there are a little more dishes in the dish washer as there are in the sink. I‚Äôve talked to my therapist about options about moving out before but I honestly done know what to do, I don‚Äôt have to money to move out right now and the car I‚Äôm driving is hers.

Ex rent and property

I shared an apartment with my partner for about a year. Before signing the lease, I made sure both of our names were included to protect myself, as there were already some concerns. Over time, things became difficult‚Äîboth with work and in our relationship. A few months ago, she left to find work or ‚Äúfind herself,‚Äù but at the time, she said she planned to return.

While she was gone, I suffered a life-changing injury, and with everything going on, we ended things abruptly. Now, due to my disability, I need to move out.

My first concern is that she left a lot of her belongings behind‚Äîitems like a brand-new TV, TV stand, coffee table, queen bed, childhood dressers, IKEA furniture, and various kitchenware. I asked her to take them when she left, but since she planned to come back, I didn‚Äôt push it. She‚Äôs made no effort to contact me, other than one missed phone call months ago. I don‚Äôt want to keep or dispose of her things unfairly, but I‚Äôm not sure what the right or legal thing to do is.

My second concern is financial. Over the year we lived together, she only paid rent once. I even gave her another month free as a gift. Would she still be legally responsible for the unpaid rent? The total amount owed would be just under the small claims court limit. She has acknowledged responsibility in a text as well.

At this point, I‚Äôd honestly prefer to have someone else handle this on my behalf, as I don‚Äôt want any direct contact with her. I hold no animosity toward her, but our time together left me with a lot of emotional trauma. Time is running out before I have to move, and I‚Äôm unsure where to start.

1o1c1fy,https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/1o1c1fy/something_aint_right/,Something ain't right.,"Blood flowing from the neck. The sound of the detonation, sharp and sudden. The cries from the crowd. The chaos, erupting.

My phone, ringing.

‚ÄúIt ain‚Äôt right. Something ain‚Äôt right‚Äù.

I‚Äôve known Eleanor for almost thirty years now. We studied in Cambridge together. She left, went back to her hometown in southern Texas. I stayed, worked my way up until I- finally- became a tenured professor five years ago.

We rarely talk on the phone, rarely call each other to catch up. There‚Äôs no need, for people like us. ¬†If something happens, we know. We show up. We don‚Äôt need invitations, we don‚Äôt need updates. She was there when my husband took his life, first in my dream, when I finally collapsed from exhaustion after 42 hours awake, and then on my doorstep, when I awoke.

If I hadn‚Äôt felt it already, seeing her name on my phone screen would have been enough to alert me. But I already knew, too. Something, indeed, was not right.

I wasn‚Äôt saddened by this death. I did not agree with his politics, I do not believe his voice needed to be heard. I would have been, of course, worried about the political violence, about the risk of his supporters turning him into a martyr, even if things weren‚Äôt what they are, even if his death didn‚Äôt feel so wrong.

But his death did feel wrong.

It wasn‚Äôt because he was young. The uncomfortable truth is that dying young rarely feels wrong to us. We keep it to ourselves, because no grieving parent or sibling wants or needs to hear this, but it is true : some lives are meant to be short. The depth or the impact of a life isn‚Äôt constricted in the amount of time one spends earthbound.

So no, it wasn‚Äôt about his age. It wasn‚Äôt about who he was. It wasn‚Äôt about how he died, about the violence, about the fact that it was filmed and seen all around the globe ‚Äì although this, too, would have consequences, whether people were aware of it or not.

It was very simple : it was wrong.

Something ain‚Äôt right.

Eleanor did not add a single word after that. She didn‚Äôt need to. We knew.

It echoed. Whatever it was, it echoed.

Since that very first second, since the blood started to flow, time has been flowing differently. Underneath time, a current is starting to move backwards. The timeline has changed. Everything ‚Äì every thing- is slower now. Your coffee takes longer to get cold. Your day, even when you‚Äôre rushing, hold more minutes. You don‚Äôt need to be one of us to feel it, you just need to pay attention.

Everything ‚Äì every thing ‚Äì is extremely unstable now. The weather, the dinner table mood, the governments. Everything ‚Äì every thing ‚Äì is on edge, ready to erupt, ready to shift.

Eleanor was on my doorstep the next morning. We both knew ‚Äì we all knew ‚Äì the coven would be summoned soon.

Now ‚Äì suspend your incredulity. This isn‚Äôt what you‚Äôre picturing. No pointy hats, no chants in the forest under the moonlight. Our meetings are very proper, very demure, dare I say? And contrarily to popular beliefs, all genders are represented. The only reason men are fewer is because they won‚Äôt listen to their own hearts and you cannot find your people if you don‚Äôt let your heart lead you to them.

I hosted this one. Mainly because we knew it was too serious to let Mindy and her endless flow of homemade cocktails rule the night, and because I was the only one with a house big enough to welcome everyone. Most of us, you see, tend to favour low-paying jobs, for we are far too aware of the price to pay for greed. I, however, was married to a high-end lawyer, and his greed allowed me to own a house big enough for me, our four children and six ghosts from three different centuries.

The children were asleep, the ghosts silent, the house itself holding its breath.

Eleanor, as often, was the one to break the polite chitchat to get to the matter of the night.

‚ÄúSomething ain‚Äôt right. Something ain‚Äôt right and we all feel it‚Äù.

First round of the table‚Äì the flashbulb memory. Where were you when it happened, what were you doing, who were you with, was there music, anything specific, any pattern we can recognize, anything to explain why the shift of energy happened when it did.

That got us nowhere. No pattern, no similarities, no explanation.

Bad. Worrying. If this isn‚Äôt involuntarily triggered by the collective, it is orchestrated by design.

Second round ‚Äì the echoes. The confirmation. The shared stories. The nods. The ‚Äúyes, I felt that too‚Äù. Time, slower. The undercurrent, moving backwards. The energies of the past, revigorated. The nostalgia, the longing, the yearning for past times, a soft, human feeling suddenly screaming and raging, an unleashed beast demanding to be fed. Like an elastic band snapping back, sore fingers allowing it to sling back into our faces. Backwards, backwards, backwards, everything ‚Äì every thing ‚Äì backwards.

¬†

Third round ‚Äì the action. Tiptoeing. Silence. Sentences dropped before they make sense. An unsaid acknowledgement. We know. We cannot revert that switch back. It‚Äôs unfolding. We cannot stop it.

¬†

Eleanor, the loudest, as always. The protector. The warrior. That‚Äôs why she couldn‚Äôt stay in the quiet, prim town of Cambridge, despite the history here that allows us to blend in, almost seamlessly. Blending in requires abandoning yourself sometimes, and she‚Äôs never been one to do that.

She went home, and she started doing what she does best ‚Äì preparing people for battle. Oh, don‚Äôt be so literal. You don‚Äôt even know you‚Äôre fighting. And yet, with every choice, every word, every energy you decide to put, you‚Äôre choosing your side on the battleground. Choose wisely.

She didn‚Äôt need to call me this time. It wasn‚Äôt as urgent. She just waited until I was asleep, and with our time difference, she didn‚Äôt have to wait too long.

She was waiting for me in our favourite coffee shop. In the real Cambridge, it closed in 2012, but in our dreams, it will stay open forever. We sat. She had her hazelnut latte, I had my Darjeeling tea. We talked about our lives, about our children, about our jobs. We both knew our conversation would get heavy, and we both wanted to delay it as much as possible, to bask in the warm glow of denial.

As always, she was the brave one and brought it up first.

‚ÄúSomething ain‚Äôt right. The more you tell people about it‚Ä¶ The worse it gets. What started it‚Ä¶ Feeds on it, on the energy of it, on the awareness of it‚Ä¶ It ain‚Äôt right but it ain‚Äôt going to stop until we‚Äôre on the other side of it.‚Äù

When I met her eyes, I saw the first thing that made me truly afraid since the day my husband shared his cancer diagnosis. Eleanor, the strongest of us all, the most stubborn of us all, the untameable one, was‚Ä¶ Afraid?

The lights flickered. The lights that did not exist. The ethereal lights of a coffee shop that has been closed for over a decade, in the dream of two witches who loved to catch up over drinks there.

Something ain‚Äôt right, indeed.

We left, immediately, and we have not met again. Somehow, and I can‚Äôt figure out how, even our dreams aren‚Äôt safe anymore.

I‚Äôm afraid, too. I‚Äôm afraid for my children, for the world that is waiting for us on the other side of this.

¬†

But the last thing Eleanor told me was that it wasn‚Äôt going to stop until we‚Äôre on the other side of it.

So I did what I had to do, to get us all there.

I‚Äôm sorry. I tricked you.

Now you‚Äôre aware of it, too. Now you‚Äôll notice the way your coffee takes more time to get cold. You‚Äôll notice the way your hours seem a tiny bit longer. Your days don‚Äôt feel as rushed. Your childhood clothes are everywhere in stores. What was once conservative now feels normal. What was once futuristic now seems impossible. You‚Äôll notice the slowing down of time, and if you truly pay attention, you‚Äôll notice the undercurrent going backwards too.

Everything ‚Äì every thing ‚Äì you do is feeding something, strengthening a side.

Everything ‚Äì every thing ‚Äì is up to you.

See you on the other side.

I'm not an antisocial person, not even introverted; actually I'm really outgoing and I love talking to people.

When I was a child I was extremely bullied and isolated, it all came from the fact that I'm gifted (I think that's the correct term, I'm not an English speaker) therefore I have always been quite different from the people my age. I had to leave school for a while.

It took many years but I overcome the trauma and became extroverted and friendly, I had many friends over the years.

Two years ago, I started art school and got bullied again, I wasn't able to fight back and was so depressed that I left school again and stopped talking to everyone, that's how I lost all of my friends, slowly.

This year I came back to finish my last year with a new class. They are all very kind, but all of them have their friend groups and they aren't very interested in forming deep connections. I have taken the iniciative to make plans, but it didn't lead to much. They are very kind, but just casual classmates.


I was doing good until now that I got quite sick and I've been in bed, without anything to do for a few days. I feel so terribly isolated and lonely. I know this is just temporary but it's so hard. I need friends. I need people to have a coffee and chat. I need people to take a walk and share different opinions. I need to go out and party, or go to the park, or the mall, or anything.
I just need a friend. I crave a friend group.

I'm not sure of what to do. I'm in my last year and don't have the time to find activities in my area, not that there's much to do here anyway.
I'm not into videogames nor do I have a computer of my own.

Ever get that feeling that you're operating at 70%? Like there's another gear you just can't seem to find? It‚Äôs not about hustling 24/7, but about making your efforts *count*.

I've been obsessed with this idea of ""unlocking"" that next level without burning out. It turns out, peak performance often comes from the small, almost boring, things we do consistently. It's less about a giant leap and more about building momentum, one step at a time.

Here are a few simple shifts that have made a huge difference for me:

*   **Win the First 15 Minutes.** Before the emails, before the social media scroll-hole, just pause. I've found that drinking a full glass of water and spending two minutes thinking about my single most important task for the day completely changes my trajectory. It's about starting with intention, not reaction.

*   **Embrace Single-Tasking.** We glorify multitasking, but it's usually just a recipe for doing multiple things poorly. Try setting a timer for 25 minutes and dedicating it to *one* thing. No phone, no other tabs. The clarity you get from that focused burst is insane.

*   **Schedule an 'Energy Audit'.** At the end of the day, quickly jot down what gave you energy and what drained it. Was it a specific conversation? A type of work? The afternoon coffee? Seeing the patterns is the first step to designing a life with more of the good stuff and less of the draining stuff.

But let's be real, none of this works if your emotional foundation is shaky. You can't optimize a system that's constantly running on stress and anxiety. Getting a handle on my own emotional well-being was the biggest unlock of all. For anyone feeling a bit lost on how to structure that journey, I genuinely found **[this resource (affiliate link)](https://praneetbrar.com/digistore24/make-my-plan/#aff=maximizeme)** to be a huge help in creating a clear, actionable plan.

It's all about building that upward spiral, one small choice at a time.

1o1bylz,https://www.reddit.com/r/MakeNewFriendsHere/comments/1o1bylz/27mgermany_stuck_in_my_head_looking_for_real/,"27M/Germany - Stuck in my head, looking for real connections","Hey Reddit,

I'm Michael (Mike), 27 years old, and I live in Germany. I can speak English, German, and Polish (though I don't write well in Polish). I can be a bit reserved at first, but once I get comfortable, I'm all in and pretty much an open book at that point. I value honesty and loyalty, and I'm always trying to grow and improve. I'm pretty lowkey and keep it real.

**A Bit About Me**

* I'm a good listener, and I appreciate both deep conversations and lighthearted banter
* I like calm company‚Äîhanging in a voice call while we each do our own thing is underrated
* I'm into solo hobbies, but always open to trying something new if someone brings the spark
* I'm the type who loves to listen and be there for people, but I'll give advice if I can help. Sometimes just being present for someone is what matters most

**Why I'm Posting**

Lately, I've been stuck in my thoughts, and I'm trying to get out of the loop. Finding new friends is one way I think could really help me. I actually have close friends I've known for 12+ years, but they're all on the west coast of the US now, so timezones have been tough since I moved back to Germany. That's part of why I'm looking to connect with people closer to my timezone.

I'm not looking for a big group or server‚Äîjust hoping to connect with genuine people. I love daily conversations and just checking in on how someone's day went. Whether we're gaming together, watching something, or just chilling on call doing our own thing‚ÄîI'm flexible and easy going. Whether it's talking about life, vibing in silence, or sending random memes at 2AM‚ÄîI'm here for it.

I connect best with people who are easy going and non-judgmental. I struggle with self-confidence sometimes, so finding people I really click with can take time, but once I do, I'm all in.

**My Interests**

I'll be honest‚Äîmost of my hobbies are pretty solo. That's just how I grew up and what I gravitated toward. But I enjoy talking about them and hearing what other people are into.

**Music** has always been important to me. I used to make beats‚Äîmostly freestyle, trap, and phonk style‚Äîand I might get back into it soon. I'm all over the place with genres:

* Rock / Metal / Metalcore
* Rap / Underground Hip-Hop
* Trance / DnB / Phonk / Hardstyle

Always down to swap playlists or explore new sounds. Got a playlist that hits hard? Send it my way‚ÄîI'm always listening (coffee gets me through work, energy drinks fuel the late nights).

**Other Stuff I'm Into**

* YouTube deep dives‚Äîconspiracy theories, car builds, iceberg videos, paranormal stuff, space content (the drone situation and things like 3I/ATLAS have been super interesting to follow lately). I like keeping an open mind about these topics
* Binging shows and movies‚ÄîI'm into old comedies and action films, and I want to get more into horror/scary movies too. Always open to recommendations or watching stuff together
* Just generally falling down rabbit holes. If it's weird or fascinating, I'm in
* Gaming (PC) - I play a mix of tactical shooters, survival games, and RPGs when I want to unwind

**A Bit About My Life**

I work in an office right now‚Äîmostly desk work‚Äîbut I'm looking to get into IT since I know quite a bit about computers. When the weather's nice, I love getting outside and enjoying nature. And there's something about thunderstorms at night‚Äîjust watching the lightning and chilling‚Äîthat hits different.

I'm also slowly getting into working out, nothing crazy, just trying to be more active.

I'm a night owl, especially on days off and weekends. During the week when I work, I usually stay up till 11pm-12am. But on nights before my days off? 3-5am is my zone.

I used to have a rat and a goldfish, but sadly they passed ages ago. I don't have pets right now because I want to make sure I can give them the love and attention they deserve when the time is right.

And hey, if none of this resonates with you, that's totally fine. I'm always looking to try new things and pick up new interests.

If you're also craving something a little more real than surface-level chats, maybe we're on the same wavelength. Send me a DM or message‚Äîtimezone differences don't bother me (as long as they're not too extreme), so reach out anytime!",2,1759933504.0,MakeNewFriendsHere,2,0.75,False

10 months back I was new to this city. Left my corporate rat race in Noida and shifted to Pink City with an idea to open my own cafe and make people happy with the best food, coffee and vibes. 6 months into my cafe what started as a small idea to meet new people in new city has now being a routine. its like something I and my fellow redditors look forward to every Saturday. They have become more than family to us. An idea to start a community where we all can meet, chill and have fun has now become a way of living. 

  
We have hosted multiple events like - Sip N Paint, Bridge Game Night, Tambola Night, Jamming Sessions to Games Night. When we hosted our first event we were just 2 people, and today after almost 2 months of regular events we are already 30+ and every weekend we find new faces adding with us. The best part is now fellow members have started pitching in with ideas for future events. This is what is giving me a sense of achievement. Never thought reddit could help me find new friends of all age group and create such a positive atmosphere in my small cafe what i call my 2nd home.

Excited enough to share that this weekend we Saturdays at Suto are hosting yet another fun event with a Diwali feel around. Will share the details of same in coming days. Hope to see many new faces this weekend.",18,1759933343.0,jaipur,23,0.91,False

Ah, ""Amar Kolkata"". It's not just a city; it's an emotion, a beautifully complex, sometimes frustrating, but always captivating story.
Kolkata is a city that is fundamentally rooted. Its soul lives in the crumbling zamindarbaris of the north and the colonial architecture around Dalhousie. It's a city where you can still find a tram slowly rattling past a brand new EV, a perfect metaphor for its character. This is where a fierce intellectualism was born, where the Coffee House still buzzes with adda on everything from Fellini to local politics. It's inherently liberal and artistic ‚Äì where else would you find entire neighbourhoods dedicated to creating idols, or a book fair that feels like the city's biggest festival? It's inclusive in its own chaotic way; it absorbs everyone into its fold, from the high-flying corporate to the migrant worker, offering a space for all.
But let's not romanticize too much. The picture today is‚Ä¶ complicated. The intellectual fabric feels like it‚Äôs fading. That artistic spirit is often overshadowed by a rising tide of mediocrity. Hooligans and lumpen e shohor ta bhore utheche. You see it in the casual disregard for rules, the 'Janish ami kar lok?' attitude that has replaced polite discourse. Sikkhar theke bhitto beshi dami hoye geche. A flashy car gets more respect than a well-read mind.
And then there's the biggest problem: a creeping laziness, a societal lethargy fed by a culture of dole politics. The spirit of struggle, of innovation, of building something new seems to have been replaced by a complacent ""chole jacche, chole jabe"" attitude. It's frustrating to watch. There are indeed a lot of things not to like about this city right now.
Kintu‚Ä¶ despite all of this, eta amar sohor.
Er gondho ‚Äì the smell of wet earth after the first rains, the fragrance of shiuli flowers in autumn, the aroma of biryani from a roadside stall ‚Äì it‚Äôs a part of my DNA. Er proti ti rastai amar sob kota prothom. My first walk to school, my first secret cigarette with a friend in a narrow lane, my first heartbreak under a yellow streetlight.
Loke bolbe nostalgia-e bhoge‚Ä¶ past e bache. Maybe they are right. But tell me, past chara present hoi? The foundation of this city isn't just bricks and mortar; it's the legacy of Tagore, Ray, and Vidyasagar. Ar past ta ache bolei ei durshomoy o bhobishoter asha thake. Our glorious history is the proof that we are capable of greatness. It's the anchor that gives us hope when the present seems bleak.
And that's where the optimism lies. An optimism for a future when Kolkata (or Calcutta, as the soul still whispers) would be able to achieve its true potential. We must not forget, when Singapore was being built, its founder Lee Kuan Yew famously said he wanted to model it after the Calcutta of that time ‚Äì a bustling, orderly, and prosperous metropolis. We were the benchmark.
Perhaps that potential is just dormant, not dead. Perhaps this is just a difficult chapter, not the end of the book. We, its people, need to wake up from this slumber, shake off the laziness, and value intellect over influence once again. The day we do that, my Kolkata will shine again. It has to. After all, it's not just any city; eta amar sohor.

About 6 years ago I (30F) became friends with a guy called Josh (34M) (not real names) we lived really close to each other and had a lot in common. We also figured out that a childhood friend of mine who I hadn‚Äôt spoken to in years was a third cousin of his (important context for later). 

After a while it seemed like our friendship was turning into more. I often worked late and he would come cook for me 3/4 times a week, he‚Äôd bring me coffee in the morning and we‚Äôd walk his dogs, met his parents and friends a bunch, cuddled on the couch watching movies etc. 

Most of our friends thought we were together but nothing physical happened until we got drunk one night and slept together. (I had previously told him I had feelings for him and had tried to cut down on the physical affection but whiskey happens.) 

The next day he told me firmly he never wanted to be anything but friends. We had a discussion and I asked him for space and no contact for two to three weeks so I could move past the romance and we could carry on with our friendship. He lasted two days and then continued to text, visit etc. He even went as far as to crash a friend‚Äôs wedding weekend two hours away and then get angry at me for kissing someone else. The friendship blew up when I discovered that over the time he had slept with me he had also had an ‚Äúexclusive‚Äù girlfriend and been sleeping with two other girls. 

Anyway I moved across the country and a lot happened in 6 years, including me re-uniting and becoming close with my childhood friend again. Let‚Äôs call her Bea. (30F) Bea is quite an introvert and so I planned to throw her 30th. I got the list of family members on it (the family is massive, think like 11 aunts and uncles and even more extended family that they all call cousins) and sent out a mass group invitation, this included Josh, who I have had passing polite conversation with over the years as he is now in a relationship with an acquaintance. 

The headcount for the party was just under 90 people, out of those about 20 were friends. Josh and his partner couldn‚Äôt make it but much of her extended family could. Since I took on the task, Bea and her mother had been saying we want you to meet Grant. (32M)

Well, Grant arrives and we just click. We have a great night and it ends in a kiss. We go on a few dates and end up sleeping together. At this point I know that he is a direct cousin to Bea, but as far as I‚Äôm aware he is a completely different side of the family to Josh. 

A few days ago Grant phones me and asks me why I didn‚Äôt tell him I slept with his cousin. Turns out somewhere in the very twisted family tree they are first cousins and he had gone for dinner and Josh had told him we had hooked up. I obviously apologised because if I‚Äôd known they were first cousins I would never have gone near him but it also wasn‚Äôt intentional. 

As it is I feel gross. I never told anyone Josh and I slept together in the first place and so now this makes me feel even weirder.

I was eating a lot of sugar so that's to be expected.

I'm 2 weeks into cutting my sugar, and the only thing that's made a huge difference is eating a lot of protein and cut out caffeine completely. I have some oat biscuits and a chocolate protein yogurt most days so I'm by no means sugar free, but it seems to be enough to keep me actually functioning. I feel so much better. I've added egg whites with my oats in the morning, which on their own used to make me crash, now I'm energized until about 2pm, lunch is a protein, grains and veggies, same for dinner. I feel a lot better!

Last night my partner and I ordered pizza, it had been a rough week with sick pets and no sleep. So I had my pizza, and my first chocolate bar in 2 weeks. And my goodness....

I couldn't sleep, my heart was going insane and beating out of my chest. I was kinda shocked because when I'd gone cold turkey before and then eating family size bars of chocolate I hasn't had a reaction like that at all. I'm assuming It was the simple carbs mixed with the lack of fiber and then sugar...I'm not too sure. 

Anyway! Feeling a lot more positive, I've had no want or cravings for sugar or chocolate, just a bit of an upset stomach and tired from the poor sleep üòÖ I'm really excited to get back to sugar free, and I'm shocked at the difference 40g of protein with every meal and no coffee has made so far.",5,1759933084.0,sugarfree,1,1.0,False
