I had coffee with my past/younger self today. We both planned to show up 15 minutes early and both frantically hurried into the coffee shop with 5 mins to spare(still early) I guess some anxieties never go away I told my younger self. We both sat down, both looked at each other, and both sighed for different reasons.

Younger self sniffled this continued every 3-8 minutes along with the routinely,""im gonna go blow my nose and use the bathroom ritual.""  I let younger me start, I asked my now self if we had gotten that promotion in coding, I smiled and said you dont know, the day before you were supposed to be told you made the descion to leave and follow tattooing full time, younger self looked at me, I smiled and said the money was there. By the time the buzzes and vibrations of his phone were going off, he went to check and quickly stopped. He looked annoyed and said she's at her parents. I wanted to smile but started to tear up, I told my younger self please never take her for granted. Please never get annoyed with her questions or curiosities of the world its why you fell in love with her. Younger self rolled his eyes, and went to go to the bathroom routinely again, and I said it won't help. That ""normal feeling""youre chasing isn't making the pain go away its just hiding the fact that its making youre life worse. He still kept walking, I said youre going to lose the one person who loves you more than anyone,  Younger self chuckled and asked if I wanted to join him, I smiled and chuckled under my breathe and got up, I told my younger self im still the same smart ass you know just sober.

Youngerself took off his coffin ring and scooped out and cut two lines with his card on his phone . He handed me the 2-3 inch cut straw a asked if I'd like to go first. Inside i felt a sadness I'd never felt before seeing myself like that.i told him no and without skipping a beat my youngerself snorted both lines. He asked why I came with him and I told him so I could remember what I looked like when I was ruining my life.

We sat back down at the table and younger me hit his vape, we talked about alot. He asked about my hand and arm tattoos, I had to re explain I tattooed fulltime now, younger me broke down crying, he said he didn't want to leave tech, I told my younger self its what helped save us. I made my youngerself promise to give rugrat and Littleton a hug and kiss and showed a picture of comet. I told my youngerself where I was at in our life mentally and emotionally and why. My youngerself couldn't believe it. I promised my youngerself we'd get through all of it and more. My youngerself looked down and played with his ring. I look at him and said things will get better. I told him about mom and dad's divorce and dad cheating I told him about mom's new boyfriend.  I joked about the heart tattoo on my shaft and my youngerself made me go to the bathroom with him to prove it and he wanted another line or two. By the end of our time visiting my youngerself asked if there was anything he could do to change anything, I told him no, and that's okay because even if there was some way, my younger self was too stubborn and angry at the world and himself to probably see that.
He asked about our medical health, and looked at me fearfully. I told him dad's memory is still okay nothing too noticeable just little things every few years. My younger self said I guess we never got better at just saying it did we, I shared my head and said no. I looked at him and said we lose things alot and forget alot, not like long term and not like short term and its random. It scares us even more now than it did before. We took a walk down the sidewalk, both cutting the other off mid sentence to start the next topic of endless nonsense conversations. Sometimes I forget how sneaky we were or thought we were,as younger me powdered his nose still routinely just now using a bullet(has nicknames like shooter,ect). He asked the hard questions to which I answered. Yes, Im sober now, Yes honest and Authentic fully(we dont have to lie to feel like people like us anymore)Then paused and asked if all this has happened why didn't we end it already, were we too pussy after all? I kinda chuckled and forgotten how arrogant and brutish my youngerself could be. No, I said we're not too pussy, I dont honestly know why, probably the worry that I wouldn't be able to get into heaven, maybe bc we think people will miss us or a bigger purpose, but I honestly dont know. I smiled once again at my younger self trying to lighten the mood, we are both at rough points in our lives, younger me just deserves a little bit more comfort than I do rn, I tell him everything will be alright have faith we always have. A few more hours of conversations and alot of take aways before
We hugged each other before our departure, we looked each other over one last long time and reached out and touched different pieces of jewlrey/clothing the other was wearing, things to look forward to I guess my youngself said as he sniffled.  You're alot tougher than you think sometimes I told my youngerself, I looked several items of clothing my youngerself had on and smiled, Memories you'll never forget and we both smiled said goodbye and walked away. (Both turning back on occasion to make sure the other wasnt sent to assassinate the other.)

I'm back in the US and to reality after my vacation where I went to my first pen show. I'll post my haul and talk about my first pen show experience once my post-vacation depression goes away and after I actually get to swatching my new inks (including some Manila Pen Show exclusives and a custom mixed Sailor ink!)

Here's my current EDC :)

* TWSBI ECO <M> - Dominant Industry Log of Elixir Allegory
   * This ink feels quite dry to me, so I wanted to put it in at least a medium nib because I couldn't use it on a fine for the life of me.
* TWSBI ECO <EF> - Robert Oster x TheCoffeeMonsterzCo Coffee Monster
   * I got this pen back in the Philippines through the marketplace and I swear this writes quite thicker than I expected LOL Maybe it's just a really wet ink or I'm just very used to Japanese nibs
* Esterbook Estie <NP> - Hachimonjiya Ginzan Snow Gray
   * My first Estie and this is also my first Hachimonjiya ink! They might be made by Sailor, but I'm not sure. Anyways! I like this combo and man this needlepoint nib from Esterbrook is amazing! I love it :D
* Pilot Elite <PO> - Pilot Black Cartridge
   * I got this pen before I returned to the US, but inked it right up as soon as I got home :D I love the posting nib because it writes very fine as well and I just write small normally. I also got a CH 912 with a <PO> nib before the tariffs hit because it's the last pen that I really wanted badly (aside from the TCMC collab which I'm waiting on now :D)
* Pilot Vanishing Point <EF> - Diamine Blue Orient
   * This pen never leaves my EDC and this ink was one that was one of the inks I got from the pen show as well because it looks absolutely beautiful :D
* Pilot Custom 823 <F> - Arcus Artisan Velvet Moonlight
   * Another pen that remains inked in my collection :D And this ink came from a new ink maker in the Philippines! This writes light blue and dries a pale purple. I'm a sucker for inks like these!",2,1744272740.0,fountainpens,0,1.0,False

Sheila and Luna team up and something crazy happens. Anything to get away from the Steffy show, she's in every storyline.

1jvspk9,https://www.reddit.com/r/CrumblCookies/comments/1jvspk9/the_greed_and_lack_of_compassion_appreciation_or/,"The Greed and Lack of Compassion, Appreciation, or Care for Employees is Sickening","Honestly don't care if I get fired for this, but this is what it's actually like working for greediest company I've ever had the misfortune to work for.

What I find the most ironic thing about this shit hole of a company is the fact they are Mormon owned, most the franchises are also Mormon owned and the amount of greed/lack of care for employees is abhorrent.

I've been working as a 'Baker' at my location for over a year and got a ¢25 raise, our STORE MANAGER got a ¢45 raise. Meanwhile, there was a Mormon girl who worked with us (just a Baker) and got a $1 raise UNDER a year, was also a minor, and you bet they were late every shift and constantly making mistakes with mixing that would lead to us getting bitched at on Slack by the Owner. Funniest thing about that too, is that not even our Store Manager knew they got a raise until word got around. Sus hey?

Our Store Manager is an angel, shift leads are amazing, our franchise owner is a greedy sack of shit that has no regard, consideration, or appreciation for the people who opened and carried his store for the last year. All of us are about ready to walk out, and with him closing one of his other stores that was ""going under""- this is all he has left.

The worst part is he's AWARE that all of us are at our wits end dealing with shitty wages that don't reflect the amount of work we do to keep the show going. We're constantly understaffed (I'm literally operating ovens, pulling doughs, dressing warm/cold cookies, filling orders, balling dough, and doing POS all at the same time). We will literally have a maximum of 3 ppl running the store with a demand of between 70-100 cookies an hour between all flavours.

Recently got written up alongside some coworkers for ""leaving a dough past the Crumbl standard of 30mins"", (mind you we were swamped with myself, a shift lead, and a trainee to manage the entire store). Not to mention the ""Crumbl Standard"" requires 3-4 people to be consecutively balling, not 3 people running an entire goddamned store.

Not to mention the majority of our equipment is in the works of falling apart, I'm sure that doesn't meet the Crumbl standard. Oooo and also in typical ""Crumbl Fashion"" our store owner had his literal children folding boxes and balling doughs in-store during operation hours. Literally living up to the Child Labour Law violations Crumbl is known for.

But again, the most mind-boggling thing is that our franchise is owned by a Mormon family, the company itself is Mormon owned, and yet this is the most immoral place I've ever worked. Literally a 'Slave Wage'. When I leave this shit hole, you bet your ass Labour Board is going to be doing an investigation on our store.

Not to mention I'm a Trans Woman and am constantly facing ""subtle"" discrimination in the work place, whether it's from customers or MORMON coworkers. Literally had some 50yr old Mormon coworker introduce me to her sister as the ""Ovens Guy"" as I have developed breasts and a face of makeup. Also, the same (Mormon obvi.) coworker who got a $1 raise, had the gull to say ignorant shit comparing transracialism (DO NOT CONDONE IT) to being transgender by saying; ""Well if people can change their gender, then I can change my race."" LIKE WTF?!?!

Also in typical Crumbl fashion, they of course will never consider selling coffee, but will do a ""Promo"" with the Kardashians. Arguably America's worst example of a family, not only that, but we can all guess who didn't get a cookie... Kaitlyn Jenner! Not saying she's a good trans woman, but my God. 

I'm so sick of the corporate greed too. Our prices have gotten higher raises than our staff, in fact our prices have gotten two raises this past year since opening, whilst we got a crumb of a wage.

Everything about Crumbl is sickening, and if I could- I would gladly see our Store Owner file for bankruptcy and lose everything. He's such a tool.

Final thing. The pushing for tips from Franchise owners is disgusting. The tips are for employees, and I guarantee the reason why they get us to push it so much is because they skim them. There's absolutely no reason for our franchise owner to be concerned about us asking for tips UNLESS something sus is going on. Fucking fowl.

I hope the impending class action lawsuits down the road will do us all well- maybe make it worth it..

But hey, while I can barely afford rent, I'm so glad our Store owner can pay his 10% tithing.",1,1744272579.0,CrumblCookies,0,1.0,False

Killing 650,000 children and 1,200,000 civilian personnel. This 'report' was in truth, a declaration of war by the Empire. We are now accepting any and all enlistment and volunteers for this mission, we will not accept any negotiations with the Empire, they will pay blood with blood.""

>— By Field Marshal Hector ""Wings"" Sanders

Field Marshal Hector ""Wings"" Sanders' ""blood for blood"" speech echoed across the Sol system. Millions enlisted, fueled by righteous fury over the St. Venus massacre. War was declared. The Cass'Éfaer Empire, smug in their technological superiority and distance, prepared for a conventional conflict across the Balleui Sector border.

They expected fleets. They expected marines. They expected perhaps even a desperate planet-cracker or two aimed at a military outpost.

They did not expect Dr. Agnes Pernell and the Department of Existential Engineering (DEE).

While Sanders handled the inspiring speeches and military posturing, the *real* response was delegated. Agnes, a woman whose glasses were thicker than most starship hulls and whose idea of a relaxing evening involved calculating hyperspace resonance failures, tapped her stylus on a holographic display showing the Cass'Éfaer cradle world, Cass'Efaeria Prime, and its inconveniently located parent star, a bloated red giant named X'lar.

""Right,"" she announced to her team of sleep-deprived, caffeine-fueled engineers in the DEE's underground bunker complex (codename: 'The Sandbox'), ""Standard Orbital Relocation Protocol, sub-variant Gamma-Seven. Objective: hostile system core sterilization via targeted stellar insertion.""

""Gamma-Seven?"" piped up Jenkins, barely visible behind a mountain of discarded nutrient paste tubes. ""Isn't that the one requiring the quadruple-redundant chroniton tethers and the supplementary anti-gravity projectors powered by miniature black holes?""

""The very same,"" Agnes beamed. ""The Cass'Éfaer insulted our intelligence by attacking *children*. We shall respond by demonstrating applied astrophysics so far beyond their comprehension they won't even have time to file a formal protest with the Galactic Council That Doesn't Actually Exist.""

""Budget?"" asked Priya, sketching furiously on a napkin that depicted what looked suspiciously like a giant cosmic billiard cue.

""Approved under 'Interstellar Infrastructure Adjustment Fund',"" Agnes said airily. ""Turns out, when grief meets government spending loopholes, anything is possible. Now, sync the gravity anchors. I want X'lar nudged precisely 1.7 astronomical units towards Cass'Efaeria Prime. Standard deviation tolerance: zero. And Jenkins, make sure the Stellar Trajectory Harmonizer AI is running the 'Polite Nudge' subroutine, we don't want to accidentally destabilize the *wrong* system's Oort cloud. Paperwork, you know.""

The Cass'Éfaer Empire's orbital defense platforms around Cass'Efaeria Prime first detected... anomalies. Slight gravitational lensing where none should be. Odd neutrino emissions from their star, X'lar.

""Report, Commander,"" droned the Cass'Éfaer Sector Overseer.

""Sensors indicate... minor stellar drift, Overseer. Likely sensor malfunction due to the ongoing solar flaring.""

A few hours later.

""Overseer! The drift... it's accelerating! X'lar is deviating significantly from its orbital path!""

""Impossible! Recalibrate! Check for human stealth ships attempting-""

""Overseer! Visual confirmation! X'lar... it's... it's *filling the sky*! It's not drifting, it's *moving*! Directly towards us!""

Panic erupted. The Cass'Éfaer, a race known for their meticulous planning and rigid hierarchy, simply had no protocol for 'Enemy Is Throwing Our Own Sun At Us'. Their mighty fleets, positioned light-years away anticipating border skirmishes, were useless. Their planetary shields were designed for bombardment, not immersion in a star.

Back in The Sandbox, Agnes peered at the telemetry feeds. ""Phase One: Stellar Relocation complete. Initiating Phase Two: Applied Thermokinetics.""

Jenkins hit a large, friendly-looking button labelled 'Solar Plunge'.

Across interstellar distances, sensors detected a star briefly *wobbling* as immense, unseen forces guided it, then plunging directly into its own planetary system's heart. Cass'Efaeria Prime, its moons, its orbital habitats, and the surrounding inner planets vanished in a cataclysmic fusion event that made a supernova look like a damp squib. The outer planets were flash-boiled and then blasted into radioactive dust.

The entire Cass'Éfaer Empire, centered around their cradle world, ceased to exist in the span of about six hours from the moment Jenkins pushed the button.

Field Marshal Sanders received the report via a secure channel.

""Sir,"" a crisp voice announced. ""Project ORAT concluded. Cass'Éfaer system sterilized. Hostile civilization effectively deleted. Total human casualties: zero. Ensign Thompson spilled his coffee during the final gravity anchor detachment sequence, requesting hazard pay.""

Sanders stared out at the star charts, the righteous fire in his eyes replaced by a look of bewildered awe. He'd asked for blood. The DEE had delivered thermonuclear annihilation via stellar billiards.

Hi everyone,


 I am 35M, and from Northamptonshire, East Midlands, England. I am looking to make new genuine long-term friends and friendships, and ideally it would be great to meet people to hang out with regularly in person, as well as chat on text/ phone/video call etc.

As a person, I would describe myself as someone who is friendly, sociable, outgoing, and patient, whilst also being a caring and respectful person.

In terms of my interests and hobbies, I enjoy playing sports (I regularly play badminton, squash and table tennis), workout at the gym and do cardio/weights; socialising and going out to pubs, clubs and restaurants, watching movies (my favourite film genre is horror films); listening to music (pop, R&B, rock, indie, classical etc); gaming (I like playing PlayStation).

I also like visiting museums; and travelling and sightseeing; learning new languages and cultures; cooking; going out for coffees etc; reading history and literature and non-fiction; and playing other games like snooker/pool and bowling etc.

Whilst I am very open and happy to make new friends from international countries and I am open to long distance friendships, it would equally be great to make new friends in the UK or Britain (and preferably in nearby regions to me like London, West Midlands, East Midlands etc) to meet up and hang out with in person also. Ideally looking to make friends in the 25-40 age range (mid-late 20s, 30s and 40s - or similar ages to me).

In any case, if anyone shares the same or similar interests/hobbies to me, and feels like we may get on and would like to build a new friendship together, please feel free to message or DM me anytime. I would be very happy to connect and chat with you. 🙂

**PLATONIC FRIENDSHIP ONLY, AND ALSO PREFERABLY BASED IN BRITAIN/UK. TO KEEP THINGS RELEVANT, PLEASE ONLY MESSAGE IF YOU ARE GENUINELY SERIOUS ABOUT LOOKING FOR LONG-TERM FRIENDSHIPS, AND HAVE COMMON/SIMILAR INTERESTS.

Everything has been great from communication, similar beliefs and values, etc. 2 months ago while laying in bed with my Gf I had a dream about my ex( F/22 ). It was neither positive nor negative, however, I couldn’t help but feel guilty about it.

For context we broke up about 2 years ago due to her moving away for school and me being in school at the time. We both had insanely busy schedules and the distance didn’t help. She wanted to make things work but I broke up with her due to those factors. We had dated for 8 months when we broke up and I can say without a doubt that she gave me the absolute world. She would take initiative and plan surprises, she would visit my family without me being involved, and she understood my love languages perfectly.

Ever since being out of that relationship none of my other partners have felt the same. I lack the emotional intensity and chemistry I shared with my ex. That all being said, I have been having re-occurring dreams involving her and I find myself constantly thinking about her and missing her. I know this isn’t fair to my current gf. I just can’t help but long for what I once had and wonder if I’ll ever feel that again. It’s like all of my relationships since have been diluted.

I just found out that my ex moved back to town and is working at a local coffee shop. I was told by a friend that she is in a relationship coming up on 1 year. I have had the urge to text her but I’m not sure what exactly I’d want to hear or say. That obviously would not be very nice to my GF either. Our goodbye did not give either of us closure as it felt like a see you later rather than a goodbye. The kiss goodbye certainly didn’t make me feel cemented in our parting ways.

I am having a hard time pushing past this. Iv been constantly reliving moments from our past after not having thought about them in a year. Should I reach out?",0,1744270743.0,relationships_advice,0,0.5,False

My heart pained when I reminisced months of study which felt a waste. 

I had followed generic advice of going through flashcards, practice tests but it wasn’t enough. Doubt crept in, maybe I am not cut out for this. Guess what,,,, I refused to give up. Nursing was my dream, and I’d fight for it day in day out.

With Determination, I searched for a new approach and stumbled across Naxlex. Unlike the scattered resources.  I tried, Naxlex which offered a structured plan targeted practice questions, detailed explanations, and adaptive tests that mirrored the NCLEX. I dove in, treating my failure as a roadmap. I analyzed where I had stumbled, most topics like pharmacology, prioritization, those tricky SATA questions. Naxlex pinpointed my weaknesses with precision, turning them into strengths through repetition and clarity.

Days turned into weeks of focused study. I’d wake early, hot coffee in hand, and tackle Naxlex’s simulations.

I noticed, Confidence grew as my scores climbed. By test day, I felt different prepared, not panicked. The questions flew by, and at 85, the screen went blank. My pulse raced. Then, the result “PASS.” in the congratulatory message. Tears of pure happiness rolled down. YES I DID IT 🥰🥰🥰. 

Failing at 150 wasn’t the end it was the beginning. Naxlex didn’t just help me pass instead, it transformed my approach, proving that with the right tools and morale, triumph follows failure. Now, as a nurse, I carry that lesson daily, setbacks are just steps to success.

Best of luck Nurses 🙏",1,1744270722.0,IfailedNCLEX,0,1.0,False

After long years studying the dusty tomes of the multiverse (and many cups of strong coffee), I have finally decided to take up the sword, the spell, and the hammer — and forge my first true character.

I seek your wisdom on a path I've envisioned:
A Variant Human Artificer (Battle Smith) who will one day walk the sacred forge fires as a Forge Domain Cleric.
A craftsman, a protector, an inventor blessed by divine spark and tempered steel.

I took the Skilled feat at Level 1 to reflect a life of relentless crafting and learning.

My questions to the wise travelers who have ventured before me:

Would such a multiclass fare well in the trials of a long campaign?

How might one weave the tale of faith and invention into one soul, without feeling divided?

Are there any hidden pitfalls I should be wary of, lest my plans crumble like poorly quenched steel?

And, if you were the Dungeon Master, how would you react if a player brought this build to your table?
Would you see a rich storytelling opportunity, or would it raise any balance concerns?

Hi everyone,


 I am 35M, and from Northamptonshire, East Midlands, England. I am looking to make new genuine long-term friends and friendships, and ideally it would be great to meet people to hang out with regularly in person, as well as chat on text/ phone/video call etc.

As a person, I would describe myself as someone who is friendly, sociable, outgoing, and patient, whilst also being a caring and respectful person.

In terms of my interests and hobbies, I enjoy playing sports (I regularly play badminton, squash and table tennis), workout at the gym and do cardio/weights; socialising and going out to pubs, clubs and restaurants, watching movies (my favourite film genre is horror films); listening to music (pop, R&B, rock, indie, classical etc); gaming (I like playing PlayStation).

I also like visiting museums; and travelling and sightseeing; learning new languages and cultures; cooking; going out for coffees etc; reading history and literature and non-fiction; and playing other games like snooker/pool and bowling etc.

Whilst I am very open and happy to make new friends from international countries and I am open to long distance friendships, it would equally be great to make new friends in the UK or Britain (and preferably in nearby regions to me like London, West Midlands, East Midlands etc) to meet up and hang out with in person also. Ideally looking to make friends in the 25-40 age range (mid-late 20s, 30s and 40s - or similar ages to me).

In any case, if anyone shares the same or similar interests/hobbies to me, and feels like we may get on and would like to build a new friendship together, please feel free to message or DM me anytime. I would be very happy to connect and chat with you. 🙂

I now want to upgrade my espresso setup as I have become more of an enthusiast now, and enjoy the process of making coffee. I have set aside $1000 (with a small wiggle room) to invest in espresso making and want to reach out to the community. I say $800 for the espresso machine because I want to use the rest for other accessories like a coffee grinder.

I have read a lot of posts and hear good things about Lelit, Profitec and Breville as brands. I was originally liking the Breville Barista Express a lot, but it has a built in espresso grinder and people do not have good things to say about the quality of the grind as opposed to a dedicated grinder.

1jvs97i,https://www.reddit.com/r/FyPossessedHorror/comments/1jvs97i/the_car_behind_me/,The Car Behind Me,"**Location:** Highway 50, Nevada  
  
I was driving back to California after visiting family in Denver. I decided to take the long way home, trying to avoid the highway through Utah that always gives me a headache. So I ended up on Highway 50—the “Loneliest Road in America.”

It’s beautiful in the daytime, but it’s empty. You’re literally just driving through miles and miles of desert. No towns. No rest stops. Just flat roads and the occasional car passing you.

At some point, around 1:00 AM, I started noticing the same car behind me. It wasn’t tailgating. It was keeping its distance, but it stayed behind me for hours.

I wasn’t too bothered at first. It could be a coincidence, right? It’s a long highway, and maybe we just happened to be going the same speed.

But as the hours dragged on, it felt weird. I’d stop at a gas station in Ely, Nevada, grab a coffee, maybe check my phone, and every time I’d pull back onto the highway, that same car would be right behind me.

At this point, I started getting nervous. Every time I’d turn on my high beams or check the rearview mirror, I could see the headlights in the distance. The car was too far away to make out details, but it was always there.

After the fourth or fifth stop, I decided to keep driving without stopping again. I started to speed up a little, trying to shake it off.

Around 4:00 AM, I hit a stretch of road with no lights. I figured this was my chance to break away. So I sped up to 85 mph, flooring the gas pedal. For a few minutes, I thought I had lost it, but then I glanced at my rearview mirror.

That damn car was still there.

Still a few miles behind me.

At this point, I couldn’t take it anymore. I pulled off the highway at a rest area, thinking I would find some kind of relief. I sat in my car for a few minutes, trying to calm myself. I watched the car pass by the entrance, moving toward the next exit.

**And then it stopped.**

It sat at the exit for a few minutes. Long enough for me to feel my heart in my throat. Was it waiting for me? Was someone inside watching me?

I had no cell service, and I didn’t know what to do. But after about ten minutes, the car finally turned and drove off into the distance. I waited until I couldn’t see it anymore before I got back on the road.

I drove another two hours without stopping, too terrified to pull over again. I finally reached a bigger town, where I could safely grab a coffee and call someone. I told my friend about the car, and she told me it was probably nothing, just someone else traveling down the highway.

But I’ll never forget the feeling of being followed by something—or someone—that wasn’t in a hurry, that didn’t have to rush, that stayed with me for hours.

The weird part?

When I checked my GPS afterward, I realized I had driven through multiple towns and gas stations during the trip. Yet, every time I stopped, that car had somehow arrived before me.

Namaste! I am planning to wear a Tulsi mala, as we primarily worship Lord Vishnu at our home (other gods too, but shravan, kirtan, chintan are of Lord Vasudev). I want to wear Tulsi mala to advance in my spiritual journey.

I have seen many videos on YouTube describing the rules to follow while we wear Tulsi mala, but they seem very contradictory. I don't personally want to follow the rules of ISKCON.

**I have watched the Lecture of Sri Premanand Maharaj, and he said that we are supposed to avoid meat, intoxication, and illicit sex. People who are working can possibly not care about onion and garlic consumption, but can reduce the number of times they consume outside. People who can't follow not consuming onion and garlic can also not bother themselves about this rule.**

I am a Brahmin and I don't eat meat or do any sort of intoxication.

The questions I have are-

1. Can I consume coffee? (I have high eye power, and I get headaches frequently, due to which I consume it once or twice in a day, every day).
2. My mother and I wish to wear it, but we didn't talk about this with my father- we eat onion occasionally and garlic rarely - so my mother cooks for everyone at the same time, be it with onion or without onion. - Can we consume it?
3. We do sankirtan at our house almost every day - we play bhajans and kirtans of the lord, and we sing along. We are already maintaining an altar for our Jagannath Swamy, and we are offering him bhog and doing seva for 3 years.
4. I will be going to work soon, so there are possibly no Jain outlets near my office so is it okay if I consume normal food there (which contains onion or garlic?
5. Can I wear Tulsi mala during periods? Or should I remove it? Because I am already wearing Jagannath Swamy's locket, and I wear it all the time.
6. I don't use a mala for chanting, but I chant my isht's name 12 times and Maha Mrityunjay mantra 3 times along with recitation of Hanuman Chalisa every day.

No thankyou) and don’t have ADHD. He put me on a medication to quit smoking, and 2 days into it, I faced major suicidal and depressive non actionable thoughts. I quit the meds and the doctor. 
Reached out to another psychiatrist independent of my psychologist, and got new medication, which I took for a week but the crash was heavy. 
Now, it was too early for me to decide that I don’t ever want to take meds, but who has time to give the body time yo adapt? Not me, a neurotypical person might have, but who am I if not defined by my neurodivergence haha!
And thus starts my rebuilding phase. I quit smoking, went cold turkey. Started working out regularly, and build my life around a healthy lifestyle. Good diet is not a temporary solution, it’s a lifetime habit, and I learnt it after reaching fatty liver grade 3 (that’s the last stage to fix things btw, you cross it, you mostly lose you liver.). 
I got a new addiction, coffee(black, please don’t add milk and sugar to it). I switched my focus in building my business empire, which is technically still where it was 2 years ago, but I have learned so much!
And now I am mostly focusing on self development, restructuring my life around my newly discovered but lifelong brain pattern. I eat greens, raw foods as much as possible. I am slowly experimenting with supplements like L-theanine to balance my caffeine intake, L-Tyrosine for mental clarity and morning brain fog, creatine for the brain and muscle recovery, and magnesium glycinate for better sleep and recovery. 
I am still new to the supplement game, but I am having a great time doing a proper data analysis of my own body, studying effects of specific supplements to all aspects of my life. I am my latest project and I love it. 
But the best way to survive, I have realised, is to be the best version of myself in all aspects of life. I can’t control what I can’t control, but I can control every calorie that goes into my gut. 
Oh, and I take so much gut friendly foods - probiotics, prebiotics, kombucha, kefir, curd, yogurt, pickles and whatever I can get my hands on. (I am a chef so that helps a lot)

Lastly, I owe it big time to AI. ChatGPT is my full time assistant. No other apps or softwares or bullet journals have ever helped me apart from overwhelming me. ChatGPT is instant, and it has a memory, so it remembers everything. Use the AI as much as you can, it’s scarily amazing!

Thank you for reading my randomly put together thoughts, I hope you love your ADHD brain as much as it loves you! It’s a superpower guys.

Let me share a little story—my story.

At one point, I weighed 80 kgs. Today, I stand strong and healthy at 65 kgs. And no, I didn’t get a gym membership or do any fancy crash diets. I simply decided to *discipline* my lifestyle.

I began observing my habits and made conscious changes. I signed up for a simple yoga and meditation class in my locality. I committed to drinking 4 litres of water daily—*without fail*. Slowly, things started shifting, inside and out.

One of the biggest game changers? Routine. I built a daily rhythm that worked *with* my body, not against it. Here’s what my day typically looked like:

# 🌞 My Daily Wellness Routine

**7:30 AM – Rise and Shine**  
Woke up close to sunrise. The first thing I did? Drank two glasses of water to wake my system up. Within 15 minutes, I had a fruit to kickstart my metabolism.

**8:30 AM – Wholesome Breakfast**  
A hearty, home-cooked breakfast followed. Balanced, nourishing, and satisfying.  
👉 Followed by 3 glasses of water by 8:40 AM.

**10:00 AM – Mid-Morning Boost**  
A bowl of fresh curd to keep the gut happy.

**11:00 AM – Hydration Check**  
A glass of water to stay on track.

**11:30 AM – Healthy Munching**  
A handful of dry fruits—pick what you love!

**12:30 PM – Lunch Time**  
One roti, a bowl of rice, and a sabzi (vegetable dish). Simple and wholesome.  
👉 Washed down with 3 more glasses of water around 12:45 PM.

**2:30 PM – Snack Smart**  
An apple to fuel the afternoon.

**3:00 PM – Stay Hydrated**  
Another glass of water.

**4:00 PM – Chai Time**  
A cup of tea or coffee—but with honey instead of sugar. Small swaps, big difference.

**5:30 PM – Pre-Workout Snack**  
One banana to get ready for the evening jog.

**6:00 PM – Hydrate Again**  
Water before the jog.

**6:30 PM – Movement Matters**  
A light jog or walk from 6:30 to 7:30 PM. It’s not about intense workouts, it’s about consistency.

**7:30 – 8:00 PM – Dinner Time**  
A light, home-cooked dinner to end the day on a clean note.

**🧘‍♀️ A Few Golden Rules I Swear By:**

* I ate every 2 hours to keep my metabolism active.
* I religiously drank 4 litres of water a day.
* Yoga in the morning, jogs in the evening—it became my ritual.
* I aligned my body clock with nature: waking close to sunrise, winding down by sunset.

 

·         This wasn’t a crash course. It was a lifestyle shift. And if I can do it—without gym memberships or miracle diets—so can you.

·         The key? *Discipline, hydration, mindfulness,* and a little love for your body.

Attached are some photos of what I am looking for. However, these are from Italy.  You can see that the Caffe itself is beautifully decorated and sophisticated. And my favorite part is that the cups are ornate—have a look at those photos.   The greenish one is all the way down in Naples, and the more elegant one with gold trim is from all the way up in Venice. And throughout the country of Italy, you can find these so-called Gran Caffe’s. And they are usually quite historic. 

Does Athens have anything like this?  Preferably historic, and sophisticatedly decorated, and most importantly to me, a very signature and unique and decorated coffee cup. ",0,1744269342.0,athina,0,0.5,False

I made good talk with customers at my job, and had great conversations with my coworkers. Then I was able to complete a sufficient workout with my friend while *still* feeling energized and we were able to have a good time. I was at my peak energy through the whole day! Just enough to talk to everyone, but not too much as to bounce off the walls and feel like crap when I get home.

But days like these feel like once in a blue moon for me. And no matter how much coffee I have or how much sleep I get, I can never really give my all as a person with autism. I’m insecure about coming across as boring or shy to new people I meet. Sometimes even with people I know. When there’s more than just me and someone else in the room, I’m always the wallflower.

I’m just struggling to find out how to achieve my optimal energy levels at a consistent rate. I understand moods always change, and that’s a big contributing factor. But even on my good days where I have to be social, I often can’t find this target and end up keeping to myself against all my will.

Everything has been great from communication, similar beliefs and values, etc. 2 months ago while laying in bed with my Gf I had a dream about my ex( F/22 ). It was neither positive nor negative, however, I couldn’t help but feel guilty about it.

For context we broke up about 2 years ago due to her moving away for school and me being in school at the time. We both had insanely busy schedules and the distance didn’t help. She wanted to make things work but I broke up with her due to those factors. We had dated for 8 months when we broke up and I can say without a doubt that she gave me the absolute world. She would take initiative and plan surprises, she would visit my family without me being involved, and she understood my love languages perfectly.

Ever since being out of that relationship none of my other partners have felt the same. I lack the emotional intensity and chemistry I shared with my ex. That all being said, I have been having re-occurring dreams involving her and I find myself constantly thinking about her and missing her. I know this isn’t fair to my current gf.

I just found out that my ex moved back to town and is working at a local coffee shop. I was told by a friend that she is in a relationship coming up on 1 year. I have had the urge to text her but I’m not sure what exactly I’d want to hear or say. That obviously would not be very nice to my GF either. Our goodbye did not give either of us closure as it felt like a see you later rather than a goodbye. The kiss goodbye certainly didn’t make me feel cemented in our parting ways.

Alright, fellow focus-seekers! Let’s dive straight into this because I think we can all agree on one thing: staying focused in today’s world can feel like trying to catch smoke with your bare hands. 😅 So, what’s the secret sauce? 

Let me share a daily habit that's been a game-changer for me: **the fine art of daily planning.** 🗓️ Sounds simple, right? But hear me out!

**Here’s the deal:** 
- **Morning Ritual**: The first thing I do is grab my coffee (or tea, no judgment here), find a comfy spot, and take 10 minutes to jot down my tasks for the day. No fancy planners or apps necessary—just a good old notebook or sticky notes! 
- **Prioritize Like a Boss**: Once I have my tasks laid out, I circle the top three things that *must* get done today. It’s like creating your personal treasure map. 🗺️
- **Time Blocking**: I block out time for each task. Not only does this make me formal about my plan, but those little segments feel like mini-deadlines. Who doesn’t love the sweet rush of a ticking clock? ⏰
- **Break Time!**: After every task, I reward myself with a break—maybe a walk, a snack, or a few memes to scroll through. 😂 It’s all about those tiny victories!

And here’s the kicker: **the world around us is *loud*—social media, emails pinging, that eternal ‘what’s for dinner’ dilemma.** By taking just a few minutes to plan my day, I'm basically throwing up a soundproof wall around my focus. 

Think about it—when was the last time you felt overwhelmed because you didn’t have a plan? It happens to the best of us! And let’s be real, we often fall into the trap of thinking we’ll remember everything. Spoiler alert: we don’t! 🤦‍♀️

**So, what’s the takeaway here?** 
- Investing those few minutes in planning allows for clarity and boosts your productivity. It’s like sharpening your axe before you chop down trees. 🪓 
- And let’s not forget the thrill of striking through those tasks one by one. Seriously, it’s therapeutic! 

At the end of the day, focusing is about finding what works for *you*. Maybe it’s planning, maybe it’s something else entirely. Have you found your magic habit yet?

I am developing the idea of opening a 100% Pet-Friendly cafe in the beautiful city of Cuenca, Ecuador, and I would love to share it with you to receive feedback, ideas, and critiques.
Value Proposition:
My vision is to create a unique space where coffee lovers can enjoy their favorite drinks and food without having to leave their furry companions at home. This cafe will not only allow pets but will also be designed with their comfort and well-being in mind, offering services such as:
 * Dedicated and safe spaces for pets.
 * Fresh water bowls.
 * Potentially, a special menu for pets (healthy snacks).
 * A relaxed and friendly atmosphere for both owners and animals.
Target Market:
Cuenca has a growing community of pet owners who are looking for places where they can enjoy social activities without leaving their animal companions behind. Additionally, tourism in the city is significant, and many travelers seek ""pet-friendly"" options.
Potential:
 * Differentiating Experience: Offering a space fully adapted for pets creates a unique value proposition.
 * Community Building: The cafe could become a meeting point for animal lovers.
 * Potential for Events and Collaborations: Themed activities for owners and pets could be organized.
Current Status:
I am currently in the planning and research phase, defining the business model, looking for potential locations, and calculating the necessary initial investment.
I am in doubt whether to make it pet-friendly or only dog-friendly.
And whether it should be in Cuenca, Ecuador, or another location, preferably in LATAM.

I am planning to wear a Tulsi mala, as we primarily worship Lord Vishnu at our home (other gods too, but shravan, kirtan, chintan are of Lord Vasudev). I want to wear Tulsi mala to advance in my spiritual journey.

I have seen many videos on YouTube describing the rules to follow while we wear Tulsi mala, but they seem very contradictory. I don't personally want to follow the rules of ISKCON.

**I have watched the Lecture of Sri Premanand Maharaj, and he said that we are supposed to avoid meat, intoxication, and illicit sex. People who are working can possibly not care about onion and garlic consumption, but can reduce the number of times they consume outside. People who can't follow not consuming onion and garlic can also not bother themselves about this rule.**

I am a Brahmin and I don't eat meat or do any sort of intoxication.

The questions I have are-

1. Can I consume coffee? (I have high eye power, and I get headaches frequently, due to which I consume it once or twice in a day, every day).
2. My mother and I wish to wear it, but we didn't talk about this with my father- we eat onion occasionally and garlic rarely - so my mother cooks for everyone at the same time, be it with onion or without onion. - Can we consume it?
3. We do sankirtan at our house almost everyday - we play bhajans and kirtans of the lord, and we sing along. We are already maintaining an altar for our Jagannath Swamy, and we are offering him bhog and doing seva for 3 years.
4. I will be going to work soon, so there are possibly no Jain outlets near my office so is it okay if I consume normal food there (which contains onion or garlic?
5. Can I wear Tulsi mala during periods? Or should I remove it? Because I am already wearing Jagannath Swamy's locket, and I wear it all the time.
6. I don't use a mala for chanting, but I chant my isht's name 12 times and Maha Mrityunjay mantra 3 times along with recitation of Hanuman Chalisa every day.

1jvrtq8,https://www.reddit.com/r/mbti/comments/1jvrtq8/examples_of_possible_tife_usage/,Examples of possible Ti-Fe usage,"Here are examples of where I think I used Ti-Fe

1. One time in school, I was chosen to be at the front of the lunch line, and to choose another kid in the classroom to be in the front with me, I chose this kid with a broken arm because he had a broken arm, so it'd be more effort for him to carry his tray, so he'd need more time, my friend got mad at me for not choosing him because he's my friend and the other kid isn't, and he was still mad even after I explained my reason to him.

2. My sister made me promise not to tell that she'd snuck a cat home, I told her that she'd have to get rid of the cat, or I'd tell.

I didn't care about her doing anything wrong, I was just worried about her setting people off and getting in more trouble than a cat is worth, not to mention, it's not fair to an animal to be kept in secret because that limits their capabilities to have the most fulfilling life possible, and they'd be better off with another family who doesn't have to keep them secret.

A life of running is worse than life in prison, I'd rather just own up and face the consequences rather than continue to sneak around.

3. I used to point out the logical plot holes in what people said a lot, like this one guy said he ran a mile in 2 minutes and I pointed out how the fastest mile ever wasn't even ran that quickly, and I asked him if he ever thought about getting his name in the world record books, I didn't actually believe him, but I wanted to let him know that I was subtly onto him, it's the same with this girl who said she's 16 years old and 9'10"" I understand rare genetic conditions exist, I know that people can be allergic to sunlight and water, but someone who is 9'10"" and isn't in bedridden and in constant pain, who no one has ever seen even though she says she goes to school but just wants to remain private about her height which is why she hasn't alerted the book of world records.

It doesn't matter how private she wants to remain, there's people out there who will see someone who looks out of the ordinary and take a picture of them and show that picture to other people.

There was just a lot of things that didn't make sense, however, by this point, I'd be socially shamed enough to know when to speak up and when not to, so I only brought up my suspicions in private chats with two of my friends, they both told me to stop overthinking it so I did.

I'm not someone who does whatever anyone tells me to, I'm good at setting my boundaries, there are times when I'll fold, but sometimes some things aren't worth the effort, and this was one of them.

4. This is a bit similar to the first one, but I once knew a girl who said she was a witch and could do magic, and I decided to entertain her even though I didn't believe that she could do magic, I still asked her questions about it, and asked her to do a spell, and she did, and the next day, I pretended like the spell had worked, even though it really hadn't, then I talked to my other friends about how ridiculous I thought she was.

I know this makes me seem like a bad person to a lot of people, I was extremely socially immature in middle school, but I'm explaining my possible Ti-Fe usage while using real life examples.

I mean I'm still socially immature, but I'm learning especially since I need to get a job, and a key part of getting/keeping a job is having communication skills.

Now, I always think about what would be the most palatable thing to say for everyone, with talking it's a bit more difficult because you have to be quicker with your responses, I care about how people feel and the social atmosphere, it's just not what comes into my mind first.

5. Another time, someone asked if one roach was a problem, I answered that it could be because roaches can self-impregnate, and one roach usually means more, and everyone started getting mad, saying that I was supposed to reassure her instead of telling her the truth, but she asked, and me lying about it isn't going to make the roach problem magically disappear, it's just going to bring in more roaches.

People started making passive aggressive remarks and accusing me of lacking empathy over something like a roach, I get they can be cute sometimes, but they can make you sick and no one wants to wake up with a roach lodged in their ear in the middle of the night.

6. When I shop for things online, I look at how much money I have to spend, divide up how much money I want to spend at each place.

Then I look for stuff to buy online if it has an online website, like Wal-Mart for example has an online website, and it's cool because it tells you what aisle stuff is in so you can find it right away.

When it comes to deciding what to buy, I think about first what we need, or what we might run out of in a couple of days, I then look for the best quality/cheapest one, sometimes you can get the cheapest one, but the quality sucks, so it's like you wasted money, but the best quality is hardly worth the price, they'll tack on $300 extra because someone got sprinkles imported from France on a cake.

I don't know if my numbers are accurate, they're probably not, but the point remains the same.

After that, I get a couple of new coffees to maintain my journey of trying all the coffee brands, and I also get any new seasonal lotion that's out if I have enough, and if I see something that I know someone will like, I'll get it for them, when it comes to the ""I'll get it if I have enough stuff"" it's stuff that I want to try because I'm interested, but if I ask other people in my household if they want to try it, and they say no, I don't see the sense in wasting money on something I might not like and probably won't be able to eat all of, so it's best to just wait for the sample size.

7. Another time when I was in elementary school, I was getting bullied by a group of kids, I gave a present to the kid who seemed to be like he was the leader of the group, he wasn't the meanest to me, but his step dad was the teacher so he was popular.

I did this to gain social favor with him and to get him to leave me alone, it worked for a little while, but then they started bullying me again, I ended up moving not long after that though.

8.  I don't know if this constitutes as being Ti, I think it does though, and that's when I was watching this baseball anime, and I was trying to get into it, but all I could focus on was how everyone had their long hair down, they were wearing jewelry, including dangling earrings, and I was trying to get invested in the plot, and tell myself this is anime physics, stuff like that doesn't matter, but I couldn't think about how much of a hindrance that'd be to their game, their hair would blow in their faces, they might accidentally rip some of their hair out when they grab it throw the ball, there's reasons why they make you have to put your hair up or take out or tape up jewelry when you play sports, it gets in the way.

I don't play sports but I know enough to know stuff, and that stuff was very distracting to me.

Something similar is on this other anime, the character was wearing this shirt with these long rope things hanging off the back, and all I was thinking about was how easy it'd be for someone to just grab the ropes and kidnap her, she was a wanted person who people were looking for, and she's making herself very easy to catch with that outfit choice.

I'm bothered by the fact that in Yellowjackets, they're stranded in the middle of the woods, and one of the characters thinks it's a good idea to write in her diary with no lock about how she had an affair with her best friend's boyfriend, when her best friend is there with her.

I know she probably thinks that no one is going to read her diary, but curiosity is a powerful weapon, she really should have expected it was going to be seen.

There are a lot of examples in this show where I question people's logic, and I almost stopped watching it because it annoys me so much, I don't want to get into it because of spoilers, but if anyone's curious they can ask.

I wish I could be less picky about that stuff so I could just focus on the show, but I can't.

Some other show/movie based examples that are pretty common that annoy me are when one of the characters taunts another character they believe to be dangerous, why would they taunt someone they believe to be dangerous?

Another one, and this happens in real life too, it's where a bully who the bullied person knows dislikes them, tells them that a trusted friend says they hate them, even though there's no evidence of this, the bullied person believes them and starts distrusting their trusted friend based only on the words of someone who doesn't like them, why would they listen to someone they know doesn't like them, I know they lack confidence in themselves, but I still don't fully understand.

I could probably think of more examples, but I think this post is already long enough.

What are some examples where you used Ti-Fe or Fi-Te?",1,1744268607.0,mbti,1,1.0,False

Hi everyone,

I’ve been quietly following this community for a while now, and I’m genuinely passionate about coffee. Like most people, I started with instant coffee. Eventually, I got curious about brewing methods and, without much research, ended up buying an Agaro drip coffee maker for around ₹1500, along with Bru southern Trails Chikmagalur ground coffee from Amazon. That’s my current setup, and I’ve been using it to brew black coffee, which is my preference.

After discovering this subreddit, I realized that my brewing process wasn’t ideal. That’s when I came across James Hoffmann’s videos—especially the one on optimizing coffee from cheap drip machines—and I’ve been following those tips to improve my brews.

Now, I’d love to level up my coffee game but in a non-overwhelming way. I often feel lost with the sheer number of options in coffee gear, beans, roasters, grind sizes, etc., and that keeps me from upgrading.

Here’s what I’m looking for:

A single, affordable, and easy-to-use brewing method that’s great for black coffee (e.g., French press, Kaldi Press, or anything you’d recommend).

A reliable and affordable source of high-quality ground coffee in India—preferably one that ships fresh and doesn’t break the bank.


I just want a simple, fuss-free setup that consistently makes a great cup of black coffee. Any suggestions would be much appreciated. Thank you!

This year Estonia will be represented by Tommy Cash singing 'Espresso Macchiato,' a comedic and very catchy song about coffee sung in pseudo-Italian.

Tommy, born Tomas Tammemets in Tallinn, is a provocateur by trade, always looking to cross lines and push boundaries. As he said in a *Crack* magazine interview with Douglas Greenwood, ""What makes others uncomfortable makes me comfortable, actually. I don’t see anything gross in the things that I do. Maybe it's because I'm so forward? I don't know. It's all so normal to me."" Normal or no, his pushing of the line has gained him some notoriety, such as going viral several times for showing up to fashion shows in self-described ""anti-fashion,"" including a full mattress strapped to his back to make it look like he was in bed at a Paris show in 2023. He has also collaborated with many popular artists, such as Charli XCX, 100 gecs, or Yung Gravy, as well as Little Big and Joost Klein, previous Eurovision representatives for Russia 2020 and Netherlands 2024, respectively.

What does this conceptual artist have as a staging concept? We'll have to wait and see, but it's almost assuredly going to push the envelope and embrace the unconventional. And the audience will have no choice but to watch it all unfold before their eyes, what with all that espresso and all those macchiatos in their systems!

Ceremonial matcha powder is considered superior to other grades of matcha due to its quality, taste, and traditional significance. Sourced from the youngest tea leaves of the first harvest, ceremonial matcha is made using the topmost, tender leaves that are rich in nutrients and have minimal bitterness. These leaves are carefully stone-ground into a fine, vibrant green powder, ensuring the highest possible freshness and purity.

https://preview.redd.it/6tvxpho1gyte1.jpg?width=1440&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=8fd2395aaa95566f135adba38d1145e8950170fc

One of the most distinguishing features of ceremonial matcha is its flavor profile. It has a naturally sweet, umami taste with a smooth texture and no need for added sweeteners or milk. This makes it ideal for traditional Japanese tea ceremonies, where the flavor and quality of the matcha are the central focus. In contrast, culinary-grade matcha, while still beneficial, tends to be more bitter and is typically used in cooking or blended drinks where its flavor is masked by other ingredients.

https://preview.redd.it/vfbca9a3gyte1.png?width=1055&format=png&auto=webp&s=3a57ae2f43c0784df557e3152e592be7702e527c

Ceremonial matcha is also richer in chlorophyll, L-theanine, and antioxidants like catechins, due to the shade-growing process the tea plants undergo before harvest. This process boosts the production of these beneficial compounds, making ceremonial matcha a powerful source of calm energy and mental clarity without the crash associated with coffee.

Additionally, the preparation of ceremonial matcha is a mindful ritual in itself. Whisking the powder with hot water using a bamboo whisk (chasen) allows one to connect with the moment, promoting a sense of peace and presence.

In summary, ceremonial matcha powder is better because of its superior taste, nutritional profile, and cultural significance. It offers a high-quality, healthful, and enriching experience that goes beyond just drinking tea—it’s about enjoying a tradition that nurtures both body and mind.",1,1744268051.0,senchabrew,0,1.0,False

I waited for him to laugh. Surely this was a misunderstanding. No, he asked for free creams and as many sugars as I could give him in his water. So I obliged.

I never thought I'd be writing a review like this. In fact, I used to be the person who avoided smiling in photos, kept my mouth slightly closed when laughing, and constantly worried about bad breath—even after brushing. My teeth weren’t falling out or anything drastic, but they just didn’t feel healthy. I had bleeding gums, sensitive teeth, and this constant “fuzzy” feeling on my tongue no matter how often I brushed.

I tried all the typical fixes—fancy electric toothbrushes, special toothpastes, mouthwashes that burned my mouth, flossing religiously. You name it. Nothing seemed to work long-term.

That’s when I stumbled upon **ProDentim**.

And I have to say: **ProDentim didn’t just improve my oral health—it completely transformed it.**  
If you’ve been struggling like I was, please keep reading. Because I’m going to share my full experience, why I think this product is so different, and why it’s something I *wish* I had found years earlier.

# The Struggle: A Silent Confidence Killer

Let’s be honest—your mouth is one of the first things people notice about you. Whether you’re speaking, smiling, or laughing, your oral health is always on display.

For years, I had issues with:

* Bleeding gums during brushing
* Occasional bad breath (even with mints)
* Tooth sensitivity to cold and hot
* A constant dry or “coated” feeling on my tongue
* And an overall lack of confidence in how my mouth *felt*

And the most frustrating part? I was doing **everything right**—brushing twice a day, flossing, using mouthwash. Still, something felt *off*. And dental visits? They were always followed by guilt trips and expensive cleanings that left me feeling worse.

# The Discovery: A Different Kind of Oral Health Solution

I first heard about **ProDentim** through a health podcast. They were discussing the surprising fact that **dental problems aren't always caused by ""bad brushing""—but by an imbalance in the good and bad bacteria in our mouths.**

That caught my attention. I knew about gut health and probiotics, but it never occurred to me that **our mouths have a microbiome too**.

The speaker explained how traditional products—especially alcohol-based mouthwashes and chemical-laden toothpaste—can actually kill the *good* bacteria in your mouth, leaving the bad ones to dominate. This imbalance causes bad breath, plaque buildup, bleeding gums, and other problems.

Enter **ProDentim**—a **probiotic supplement specifically designed for oral health**.

Instead of scrubbing and killing everything, ProDentim works by **repopulating your mouth with healthy bacteria**, supporting gums, teeth, and breath from the inside out.

That made so much sense to me.

I ordered a 3-bottle bundle right away.

# What Happened After I Started Taking ProDentim

Each ProDentim tablet is a soft chewable that tastes like peppermint. You take one daily, ideally in the morning after brushing. It takes about 30 seconds to dissolve, and then you just go about your day.

I noticed changes faster than I expected.

# Week 1: A Noticeable Freshness

After just a few days, my mouth started feeling *cleaner*—not from the burning of mouthwash, but a natural, lasting kind of freshness. My tongue felt cleaner, and I didn't wake up with that “morning breath” I used to dread.

Even after coffee and lunch, I noticed my breath stayed fresher longer. This was a small thing, but it gave me a *huge* boost in confidence during meetings.

# Week 2: Gum Sensitivity Improving

By the second week, something amazing happened—I brushed my teeth and **there was no bleeding**. None. I had gotten so used to that bit of pink in the sink that I assumed it was normal. But with ProDentim, it just… stopped.

My gums looked pinker and healthier, and my sensitivity to hot and cold foods started to fade. I even bit into an ice cream cone without wincing!

# Week 4: The Full Transformation

After a month, I was hooked.

* My gums were no longer swollen or tender
* My breath stayed fresh all day, even without gum or mints
* My teeth felt smoother and looked *whiter* (even though this isn’t technically a whitening product)
* I had zero pain or discomfort when eating or drinking
* And most importantly—I smiled with full confidence again

It’s hard to explain how powerful that is. I felt **more confident, more attractive, and more free** than I had in years. All from a tiny chewable tablet.

# Why ProDentim Works (What’s Inside Matters)

The reason ProDentim works so well is because of its **carefully chosen natural ingredients and probiotic strains**. Here are a few that stood out to me:

* **Lactobacillus Paracasei:** Supports gum health and reduces inflammation
* **Lactobacillus Reuteri:** Helps with bad breath and balances oral flora
* **BLIS M-18 and BLIS K-12:** Two powerful strains that protect teeth and freshen breath
* **Inulin:** A prebiotic that feeds the good bacteria and supports balance
* **Peppermint and Malic Acid:** Natural ingredients that support a clean, fresh mouth feel

Everything is **clinically backed**, non-GMO, and made in an FDA-approved facility. That gave me a lot of peace of mind, especially since I was putting this into my body daily.

# A Few Tips for Best Results

If you're planning to try ProDentim (and you absolutely should), here are a few things I recommend:

1. **Be consistent.** Take one tablet every morning. It’s easy and becomes second nature.
2. **Let it dissolve slowly.** Don’t chew and swallow too fast—let it work its magic in your mouth.
3. **Give it time.** I saw changes in the first week, but the real magic happened around weeks 3–4.

Also, pair it with a gentle, fluoride-free toothpaste if possible. I noticed better results when I stopped using harsh chemical-based pastes.

# Final Thoughts: This is the Oral Health Secret No One Tells You About

I never imagined I’d find something that would fix so many issues—bad breath, bleeding gums, sensitivity, and confidence—all in one product.

But ProDentim did that for me.

And what’s wild is: **it’s not a pill, not a paste, not a rinse.** It’s a natural probiotic formula that simply restores balance to your mouth—something that years of brushing and flossing couldn’t do.

If you’ve been suffering silently with oral discomfort, if you avoid smiling fully, or if you’re tired of gum pain, embarrassing breath, or expensive dental visits—**this is your answer.**

It’s affordable, easy to use, and best of all—it actually works.

Doppelganger finally narrowed down the group most directly responsible for the mutant disappearances, and confirmed they were in fact targeting mutants: the 110th Street gang.* 

*They hadn't been able to gather much about the gang, normal business for a gang, which meant some absolutely reprehensible activities and taking advantage of disenfranchised youth. Although one thing had stuck out: They had undergone several changes of leadership resulting in infighting, then suddenly seemed to unify and be pushing out, taking territory from other gangs, and even sniffing at the Maggia's turf. It also happened to coincide with the beginning of the mutant disappearances. Definitely not a coincidence.* 

*More investigating and Doppelganger had found several of the 110's hideouts. Turns out they weren't great at picking up a tail, even from someone without all of Doppelganger's skills and abilities. Some weren't even particularly smart, almost got one in a bar to take them back to a hideout to show off. One of his buddies stopped it, but they still managed to slip a tracker into his pocket. Now it's time to watch, and wait. Several locations are on their list, and that meant stakeouts. Watching until they had a solid idea of numbers and patterns.* 

*Doppelganger sighs and settles into their spot on a roof watching one of the hideouts. They sip coffee from a thermos, the caffeine didn't matter much to them but the warmth was nice. At least they could be in their natural form.*

I had bleeding gums, sensitive teeth, and this constant “fuzzy” feeling on my tongue no matter how often I brushed.

I tried all the typical fixes—fancy electric toothbrushes, special toothpastes, mouthwashes that burned my mouth, flossing religiously. You name it. Nothing seemed to work long-term.

That’s when I stumbled upon **ProDentim**.

And I have to say: **ProDentim didn’t just improve my oral health—it completely transformed it.**  
If you’ve been struggling like I was, please keep reading. Because I’m going to share my full experience, why I think this product is so different, and why it’s something I *wish* I had found years earlier.

# The Struggle: A Silent Confidence Killer

Let’s be honest—your mouth is one of the first things people notice about you. Whether you’re speaking, smiling, or laughing, your oral health is always on display.

For years, I had issues with:

* Bleeding gums during brushing
* Occasional bad breath (even with mints)
* Tooth sensitivity to cold and hot
* A constant dry or “coated” feeling on my tongue
* And an overall lack of confidence in how my mouth *felt*

And the most frustrating part? I was doing **everything right**—brushing twice a day, flossing, using mouthwash. Still, something felt *off*. And dental visits? They were always followed by guilt trips and expensive cleanings that left me feeling worse.

# The Discovery: A Different Kind of Oral Health Solution

I first heard about **ProDentim** through a health podcast. They were discussing the surprising fact that **dental problems aren't always caused by ""bad brushing""—but by an imbalance in the good and bad bacteria in our mouths.**

That caught my attention. I knew about gut health and probiotics, but it never occurred to me that **our mouths have a microbiome too**.

The speaker explained how traditional products—especially alcohol-based mouthwashes and chemical-laden toothpaste—can actually kill the *good* bacteria in your mouth, leaving the bad ones to dominate. This imbalance causes bad breath, plaque buildup, bleeding gums, and other problems.

Enter **ProDentim**—a **probiotic supplement specifically designed for oral health**.

Instead of scrubbing and killing everything, ProDentim works by **repopulating your mouth with healthy bacteria**, supporting gums, teeth, and breath from the inside out.

That made so much sense to me.

I ordered a 3-bottle bundle right away.

# What Happened After I Started Taking ProDentim

Each ProDentim tablet is a soft chewable that tastes like peppermint. You take one daily, ideally in the morning after brushing. It takes about 30 seconds to dissolve, and then you just go about your day.

I noticed changes faster than I expected.

# Week 1: A Noticeable Freshness

After just a few days, my mouth started feeling *cleaner*—not from the burning of mouthwash, but a natural, lasting kind of freshness. My tongue felt cleaner, and I didn't wake up with that “morning breath” I used to dread.

Even after coffee and lunch, I noticed my breath stayed fresher longer. This was a small thing, but it gave me a *huge* boost in confidence during meetings.

# Week 2: Gum Sensitivity Improving

By the second week, something amazing happened—I brushed my teeth and **there was no bleeding**. None. I had gotten so used to that bit of pink in the sink that I assumed it was normal. But with ProDentim, it just… stopped.

My gums looked pinker and healthier, and my sensitivity to hot and cold foods started to fade. I even bit into an ice cream cone without wincing!

# Week 4: The Full Transformation

After a month, I was hooked.

* My gums were no longer swollen or tender
* My breath stayed fresh all day, even without gum or mints
* My teeth felt smoother and looked *whiter* (even though this isn’t technically a whitening product)
* I had zero pain or discomfort when eating or drinking
* And most importantly—I smiled with full confidence again

It’s hard to explain how powerful that is. I felt **more confident, more attractive, and more free** than I had in years. All from a tiny chewable tablet.

# Why ProDentim Works (What’s Inside Matters)

The reason ProDentim works so well is because of its **carefully chosen natural ingredients and probiotic strains**. Here are a few that stood out to me:

* **Lactobacillus Paracasei:** Supports gum health and reduces inflammation
* **Lactobacillus Reuteri:** Helps with bad breath and balances oral flora
* **BLIS M-18 and BLIS K-12:** Two powerful strains that protect teeth and freshen breath
* **Inulin:** A prebiotic that feeds the good bacteria and supports balance
* **Peppermint and Malic Acid:** Natural ingredients that support a clean, fresh mouth feel

Everything is **clinically backed**, non-GMO, and made in an FDA-approved facility. That gave me a lot of peace of mind, especially since I was putting this into my body daily.

# A Few Tips for Best Results

If you're planning to try ProDentim (and you absolutely should), here are a few things I recommend:

1. **Be consistent.** Take one tablet every morning. It’s easy and becomes second nature.
2. **Let it dissolve slowly.** Don’t chew and swallow too fast—let it work its magic in your mouth.
3. **Give it time.** I saw changes in the first week, but the real magic happened around weeks 3–4.

Also, pair it with a gentle, fluoride-free toothpaste if possible. I noticed better results when I stopped using harsh chemical-based pastes.

# Final Thoughts: This is the Oral Health Secret No One Tells You About

I never imagined I’d find something that would fix so many issues—bad breath, bleeding gums, sensitivity, and confidence—all in one product.

But ProDentim did that for me.

And what’s wild is: **it’s not a pill, not a paste, not a rinse.** It’s a natural probiotic formula that simply restores balance to your mouth—something that years of brushing and flossing couldn’t do.

If you’ve been suffering silently with oral discomfort, if you avoid smiling fully, or if you’re tired of gum pain, embarrassing breath, or expensive dental visits—**this is your answer.**

It’s affordable, easy to use, and best of all—it actually works.

1jvricn,https://www.reddit.com/r/LondonTravel/comments/1jvricn/help_finding_a_good_place_to_stay_for_our/,Help finding a good place to stay for our upcoming London trip?,"Hi everyone. So I've been trying to organise our first UK/Europe trip with the family (5 adults) and we're going to be coming to London for about a week in late Oct (like the last week or so). I've been doing some research about places to stay and found a few places that I wanted to run by people here to make sure that it's good before we start to book things in. I found a few places that look like they might be good:

1. [3 Bedroom Flat by Vauxhall](https://www.airbnb.com.au/rooms/1313154475172338253) (seems to be near Walworth, about 15ish minutes walk to Kennington)
2. [Home From Home](https://www.airbnb.com.au/rooms/913807928033587340) (I think about 10 minutes from Old Street station)
3. [Cosy 3 Bed Flat](https://www.airbnb.com.au/rooms/39960093) (1 min from Dollis Hill Tube Station Jubilee Line)
4. [Nice apt 15 minutes to Kings Cross St Pancras](https://www.airbnb.com.au/rooms/35311169) (3 mins to Mornington Crescent, 5 to Camden Town and 15 to Kings Cross)
5. (EDIT: I also found this place that looks like it might be good): [3 Bedroom apartment in White City](https://www.airbnb.com.au/rooms/1130992021801373294) (about 5-10 minute walk to White City)

We're looking at going to places like Buckingham Palace, Abbey Road Studios, the Harry Potter Studio Tour, Westminster Abbey/St Paul's Cathedral as the main things, and maybe some museums too, though nothing else major planned yet. We'd ideally like to be within 20-30 minutes to most things by public transport if we can, though our exchange rate to GBP is terrible at the moment so may have to get something 30-40 minutes away to fit our budget. Of course if one or two things are a bit further away that's not too bad, just as long as on average we're about 30-40 minutes out. Also we'd like to be close to some restaurants, food places, shops/groceries and maybe some cafes to grab a coffee in the morning.

I'm not 100% sure if I was looking at the right things but from what I could tell, the last one was closest to everything via public transport, but I don't know if I was looking at the right thing, so happy to be told otherwise. Also if these aren't in great areas to stay in, I'm also happy to look for others if that's what people suggest

Thanks in advanced, and I look forward to hearing from everyone!",0,1744267245.0,LondonTravel,8,0.5,False

I’m not talented, my intelligence isn’t that good. 

I had a very small incident (not even big enough to call it that) happen at a tattoo shop. I took my friend to his tattoo appointment and I spilled a tiny bit of coffee so I grabbed a paper towel from next to the sink and the artist very politely and nicely told me to not touch them and threw them out and told me that it was 100% okay and that her boyfriend did it once and that it happens, but I literally had to excuse myself to the bathroom a bit after so I could cry about it. 

I told my boyfriend about it and described how I felt in the first paragraph and he basically told me that I’m overthinking it and that the world isn’t out to get me 24/7 and that it’s okay to make mistakes sometimes (he said it nicer, but that’s the main things the said).

1jvrdrw,https://i.redd.it/c8fni6nfcyte1.jpeg,Seeking a good recipe or suggestions for vegan Hong Kong style sponge cupcakes,"Hello everyone! This is my first time posting, hopefully this works! 
I was wondering if anyone here has a good recipe for Hong Kong  or Malaysian (?) style sponge cupcakes. I saw a video about Spongies in NY which sells Hong Kong style sponge cakes and has seen a lot of success (if you look them up on YT it's very heartwarming). 
Growing up I would get these kinds of cupcakes from the Asian stores around us or at dim sum. It's essentially a sponge cake, but in my opinion it's more airy and tearable than a lot of western sponge cakes I've made. It reminds me a lot of a more sugary angel food? 
I found several recipes with the normal milk and eggs, and I'm trying to avoid those and add some pandan flavoring to some that I make, if I can find or figure out a  recipe. The problem I think with making this recipe vegan is whipping the binder for air and keeping that volume AND flexibility. 
When I've baked with aquafaba (both my own home made from raw soaking, from cooking, as well as using the pour-off from a can), it will whip up eventually, but obviously can't match an eggwhite's protein structure and flexibility. It's not bad, but the mouth feel and tenderness of these cupcakes is what I'm after.
Does anyone have a good recipe for these, or a good protein mimic that will help me get a tender and light but flexible mouth-feel? 
Picture for reference of the kind of cupcakes I'm talking about.

I had a *how hard can it be* moment. I started making them by piping jam and marshallow fondant on a pre-made base of Arnott's Milk Coffee biscuits. 

I have also found [Nana Ling](https://www.cookingwithnanaling.com/iced-vovo/)'s recipe. Now I am custom making my own bases. 

I have a couple of problems

The biscuit base is just a little... bland (sorry Nana Ling!), I want to make a base with a *little* more flavour and oomph (reminiscent of the Arnotts Milk Coffee biscuits). I have tried substituting caster sugar in the recipe for brown sugar. As there isn't that much sugar in the original recipe, it didn't make much difference.  The online recipes for coffee biscuits I have found are a completely dressed biscuit in their own right. Any Suggestions to bring some life and colour to the base? Something plain but a little sweet. Maybe some vanilla essence? 1/2 a teaspoon perhaps.

I'm suffering from hot gooey drama with the piping process. Particularly  the marshmallow fondant mix. I'm still convinced it is mostly a practice-and-practice issue, but I'm not making positive progress. I am using a sandwich bag on the piping nozzle because I think I will ruin any piping bag with the gooey marshmallow fondant mix and never clean them again. I have bought a new piping nozzle with a larger opening, maybe that will help the flow better. 

Anyway, if anyone has suggestions to help that would be wonderful. Otherwise I'm going to keep on the keep-on-trying method. 

Thanks

I’ve been with my man for almost 6 years now. We’ve had our ups and downs. In 2022, we broke up because I found Tinder on his phone. He hadn’t even fully set up his account yet but it was enough for us to break up. He had also gone on a date-like outing with a female friend and lied about it 

Eventually we got back together and rebuilt everything. We have been really good since then. We got married last year. 

So, we have an open-phone policy. It was one of the things to help build back that trust. 

Tonight I saw a notification from a girl’s name I didn’t recognize and I looked at their texts. She’s his coworker and they’ve been texting a lot. They have a mutual interest in cars and they were talking about meeting up for like a car event and him helping her with her car. His last text to her was just asking if she’d ever been to (local coffee shop) and she just replied “when?”

Looking at it objectively none of those are THAT crazy or suggestive, but I feel sick

I should talk to him but I don’t know what I would even say. “Hey babe I looked at your texts and they’re not that bad but I don’t trust you so stop texting her” ??? That’s crazy
