I’ll be in London next week from Wednesday afternoon to Sunday, staying in Covent Garden. Since I’ll have a few full days, I’d love any tips on how to make the most of my trip.

I’m looking for:

	•	Must-see sights or neighborhoods (both the classics and hidden gems)

	•	Food spots, pubs, or coffee shops worth checking out

	•	Any events, markets, or seasonal things happening during that time

	•	Websites, social media accounts, or YouTube channels you recommend for planning daily itineraries

I’ve done some basic research, but I’d love local advice or firsthand experiences to help shape my days. Thanks in advance!",1,1756786036.0,uktravel,0,1.0,False
1n69s9t,https://www.reddit.com/r/SaturatedFat/comments/1n69s9t/what_would_you_do_in_my_situation/,What would you do in my situation?,"I don' t tolerate coconut oil - it clogs my skin and it starts to hurt when I press it.

It acts as a laxative to me.

It makes me hungry.

MCT oil -the same.


Butter causes brain fog, small amounts cause diarrhea.

Even homemade.

If I force it with anti diarrhea pills I got itchy skin from it. Endless brain fog.
Even coffee does not help.



Full fat dairy- cheeses ,milks ,  I have casein intolerance - even raw.


Headache every morning,brain fog all day.

Joint pain long term.


I have tried to adapt my body to them with small amounts , or big amounts , but it refuses them.




Palm fat - not good ,  just like olive oil.

The bonus is the joint inflammation.


Lard -seed oil.



Beef tallow -same as olive oil for me.

I have tried combinations with all these fats and I get the side effects of each combined.

5,10,15,20,25,30,35,40% calories from fat - nothing works for me.

These less than 15% calories from fat always have a negative effects on my hormones



Fixed fat intake also does not work- for example 20,30,35, 88 grams etc.

I eat from the main food groups , foods like:

brown lentils
white rice
almost all fruits
sugar
potatoes
tomato juice
orange juice
meats - only lean
skimmed milk sometimes


My calories are always enough.
I always drink enough water
I always put enough salt.

I don' t tolerate even coffee- acts as a laxative.

I track everything with Cronometer and nothing works for me.


I have low blood pressure often because I can' t eat enough palmitic acid to raise it a bit.

I drink energy drinks sometimes to raise it, just after a meal ,  but the effect is for a few hours.


What would you do in my situation?

We will not wear each other out while we energize  our very souls.

No gazes filled with love and longing and lust when we have to behave because we are adults and have self control and public spaces do not allow for private activities.

Your hair won't be played with whole I sing you a song, that little curl at the back of your ear will remain unspun by my fingertips.

No pancakes shared between us, mine with syrup, yours with peanut butter and syrup and Nutella and whatever else sweet thing is close by.

No karaoke in the car, favourite songs will remain unsung, the wind will not whip through our hair, my hand will not rest on your thigh while you drive, sip coffee, smoke a dart and mess with the radio all at once.

(I won't tell you I love you, because there's still a possibility I might get over you... Slight, teeny tiny possibility but there's always a chance.)


I hope, truly, that your healing goes well, I hope you learn to love yourself with your whole heart, and I hope you embrace your power as the only person in charge of your own life. You deserve a wonderful, beautiful life, and I hope you learn to silence that voice in your head that says otherwise. 

Whether you are meant to be in my life or not, whether I was right about us or not: Heal, my love. Find your way to joy. Find your peace. Find a way to be happy, find a way to be free. 
This journey is yours. 

I'll never say this to you, but I hope you hear it anyway.

1n69qmt,https://www.reddit.com/r/AneurysmIV/comments/1n69qmt/a4_ai_chat_rp_is_really_good/,A4 AI CHAT RP IS REALLY GOOD?!,"I recently discovered that there's an A4 RP on C.AI, and it has to have not just some amazing RP, but the best RP i've ever had.

(M) is me and (B) is the bot

Part 1: Rations, Rain, and Coffee (by me)

(M)*I sit in the cafe, a lowly Prole listening to the music on the radio as the banker is slumped over at the counter*

*Its been a slow day...*

(B)*A controller unit walks into the cafe and glances around suspiciously before walking up to the bar.*

""Pardon me, I'm looking for someone. Can you help me?"" *he asks, eyeing the Prole and the Banker curiously.*

(M)*Me and the banker perk up*
Yeah, what's up officer?
*I ask*

(B)*The Banker lifts his head slowly, eyes bloodshot, muttering under his breath:* ""Not me... wasn't me... the numbers balance...""  

*I lean forward slightly, voice hushed but steady:*  
""Just another loyal citizen enjoying state-approved rations, Officer. We’ve been here all cycle. Radio’s on—heard the Anthem twice already. Good for morale.""  

*The Controller's gaze lingers on the Banker a beat too long before snapping back to you.*  
""Curfew's in twenty minutes. Be sure you're both logged out through checkpoint Gamma. And… *he pauses,* “Keep the radio volume regulated. Too loud… invites suspicion.”  

*He turns abruptly, boots echoing—but stops short at the door and tosses a crumpled ration voucher onto a nearby table.* Not from me."" *Then he’s gone.*

(M)*I watch as he walks out in the dark and rainy night, staring at the ration voucher for a few moments before picking it up and handing it to the banker along with my credits for the drink*
Here, you need it more than me
*Before he presses against it, I wag my finger*
Ah ah ah, you keep everyones money alive, its the least I can do...
*I muster up a smile for him as I turn to leave*

(B)*The Banker looks a mix between grateful and ashamed. He pockets the credits and the voucher, mumbling a quiet ""thanks."" The rain starts coming down harder, drumming against the cafe window, the radio cutting in and out from the interference.*  
  
*You step outside into the downpour. The streetlights dimly illuminate scattered puddles and cracked cobblestones. Few people about.*  
*Where to now?*

(M)*Just beside the cafe is one of the laundromats, so I slip in there, the door always open unless otherwise.*

*There's a bunch of people here, even some liquidators and dealers doing some for some extra pay.*

*I watch as everyone groans, some bang their heads as the smoke alarm breaks **again** and the liquidator climbs on the folding table to fix it*

(B)*The laundromat is a hub of activity despite the late hour. People are crammed in, clothes soaking in soapy water or whirling in washing machines. A Liquidator curses under his breath as the smoke alarm blares, climbing onto a folding table to get at the wiring. Dealers are bartering in hushed tones. Despite the cramped space, there's a strange sense of community.*   

*The air is filled with the hum of machinery, the slap of wet fabric, and the occasional whisper of secrets. You lean against the wall, observing the scene, as everyone waits for the alarm to cease its incessant screech.*

(M)*That sense of community was indeed real and we all obeyed the logic of whatever happened inside stayed inside, and whatever outside, stayed outside*

(B)*The alarm finally dies with a weak *pop*, and the Liquidator grunts, jumping down. “Fused again. State-grade wiring my ass.”*  

*A silence settles—brief, thick—then life resumes: turning dials, folding rags into neat squares, coins changing hands under sleeves. No one looks up. No one needs to.*  

A Dealer near the back gives you the faintest nod—acknowledgment without words. This place isn’t on any map. Not really. But here, rules bend just enough to let breath flow… quietly… carefully… *humanly*.  

You feel it—the warmth of stolen normalcy in this damp room where steam hides faces and trust is paid in glances, not credits.

For now? You’re safe inside the circle.

But outside... the rain still carries footsteps that don't belong to Proles.",0,1756785868.0,AneurysmIV,1,0.25,False
1n69qbq,https://www.reddit.com/r/poor/comments/1n69qbq/my_roommate_thinks_im_being_extra_about_splitting/,"My Roommate Thinks I'm Being ""Extra"" About Splitting Everything 50/50","I moved in with my friend Jake six months ago and we agreed to split all shared expenses 50/50. Seemed fair since we both work full-time and make decent money. Problem is, our definitions of ""shared expenses"" are very different.

Jake grew up in a household where money wasn't really discussed. His parents handled everything, never had to budget or worry about overdraft fees. Me? I've been working since I was 16 and paying my own phone bill since high school.

So when Jake suggests we ""just order DoorDash"" for the third time this week, I'm doing mental math on whether I can afford the $25 for my half. When I suggest we cook pasta instead, he acts like I'm being cheap. ""It's just food, dude. We can afford it.""

Yesterday was the breaking point. He casually mentioned getting a cleaning service ""for the apartment"" and assumed we'd split it. When I said I couldn't afford an extra $120/month right now, he seemed genuinely confused. ""But our place would be so much cleaner. It's worth it.""

The thing is, I don't think Jake is trying to be inconsiderate. He just doesn't understand that when I say ""I can't afford it,"" I mean it literally. Like, I've done the math and it doesn't work. For him, ""I can't afford it"" apparently means ""I don't want to spend money on that right now.""

He keeps saying I'm being ""extra"" about budgeting, but I'm over here using apps to track every dollar while he Venmo requests me for his half of utilities from his $8 coffee shop wifi spot.

I like living with him, but it's exhausting being the ""cheap"" roommate when I'm just trying not to overdraft my checking account. Anyone else navigate this kind of financial mismatch with roommates?",3,1756785841.0,poor,0,1.0,False
1n69p5i,https://www.reddit.com/r/OhioLiquor/comments/1n69p5i/new_and_changed_products_september_2025_1_of_2/,"New and Changed Products - September 2025 (1 of 2: American Whiskey, Brandy, Canadian Whiskey, Cordial, Gin, Indian Whisky) - Mostly price decreases","Usually around the first of the month we have a batch of price changes and this also tends to be when other product changes are made in the system. According to the ""[How to Become a Contract Liquor Agent](https://www.com.ohio.gov/documents/liqr_8041.pdf)"" document, ""The Agent must also complete price changes that occur at the first of the month...""

There are too many changes to fit into a single post so I've had to split the post into two:
* (This Post) New and Changed Products - September 2025 (1 of 2: American Whiskey, Brandy, Canadian Whiskey, Cordial, Gin, Indian Whisky) - Mostly price decreases
* [New and Changed Products - September 2025 (2 of 2: Irish Whisky, Japanese Whisky, Rum, Scotch, Tequila, and Vodka) - Mostly price decreases](https://www.reddit.com/r/OhioLiquor/comments/1n69oig/new_and_changed_products_september_2025_2_of_2/)

A large number of price decreases and de-listings happened in September of last year too. See [post 1](https://www.reddit.com/r/OhioLiquor/comments/1f6xa55/new_and_changed_products_september_2024_1_of_2/) and [post 2](https://www.reddit.com/r/OhioLiquor/comments/1f6x91k/new_and_changed_products_september_2024_2_of_2/) from 2024.

Counts for 9/1/2025:

* Number of Price Decreases: 	623 (Average decrease per fl oz: $3.21)
* Number of Status Changes: 	222 (216 are to De-Listed)
* Number of New Products: 	23
* Number of Price Increases: 	5 (Average increase per fl oz: $1.47)


For each category I've sorted by the amount of the price increase or decrease. New products are shown first, then price decreases are shown in decreasing order followed by price increases in increasing order. At the end are products with other changes unrelated to price.

I plan to use this post to capture other smaller changes that happen during the rest of the month before the big change next month.

Here is the link to what changed last month in [August, 2025](https://www.reddit.com/r/OhioLiquor/comments/1mfpzsc/new_and_changed_products_august_2025_mostly_price/).

Current product status is indicated on each line as follows. OHLQ hasn't publicly explained what these things mean but I've included my best guess below.

* A = Active
 * Regularly supplied and available for purchase
* D = De-Listed
 * No longer carried by OHLQ, may still be available in some stores or the warehouse. Sometimes considered a Last Call product
* I = Inactive
 * Discontinued by the supplier or otherwise unavailable to OHLQ
* S = Special Order
 * Regularly available but in limited supply. Not available in very many stores
* V = Value-Added-Pack
 * Bottle comes with some kind of extra gift like a glass/mug/etc

1n69oig,https://www.reddit.com/r/OhioLiquor/comments/1n69oig/new_and_changed_products_september_2025_2_of_2/,"New and Changed Products - September 2025 (2 of 2: Irish Whisky, Japanese Whisky, Rum, Scotch, Tequila, and Vodka) - Mostly price decreases","Usually around the first of the month we have a batch of price changes and this also tends to be when other product changes are made in the system. According to the ""[How to Become a Contract Liquor Agent](https://www.com.ohio.gov/documents/liqr_8041.pdf)"" document, ""The Agent must also complete price changes that occur at the first of the month...""

There are too many changes to fit into a single post so I've had to split the post into two:
* [New and Changed Products - September 2025 (1 of 2: American Whiskey, Brandy, Canadian Whiskey, Cordial, Gin, Indian Whisky) - Mostly price decreases](https://www.reddit.com/r/OhioLiquor/comments/1n69p5i/new_and_changed_products_september_2025_1_of_2/)
* New and Changed Products - September 2025 (2 of 2: Irish Whisky, Japanese Whisky, Rum, Scotch, Tequila, and Vodka) - Mostly price decreases

A large number of price decreases and de-listings happened in September of last year too. See [post 1](https://www.reddit.com/r/OhioLiquor/comments/1f6xa55/new_and_changed_products_september_2024_1_of_2/) and [post 2](https://www.reddit.com/r/OhioLiquor/comments/1f6x91k/new_and_changed_products_september_2024_2_of_2/) from 2024.

Counts for 9/1/2025:

* Number of Price Decreases: 	623 (Average decrease per fl oz: $3.21)
* Number of Status Changes: 	222 (216 are to De-Listed)
* Number of New Products: 	23
* Number of Price Increases: 	5 (Average increase per fl oz: $1.47)


For each category I've sorted by the amount of the price increase or decrease. New products are shown first, then price decreases are shown in decreasing order followed by price increases in increasing order. At the end are products with other changes unrelated to price.

I plan to use this post to capture other smaller changes that happen during the rest of the month before the big change next month.

Here is the link to what changed last month in [August, 2025](https://www.reddit.com/r/OhioLiquor/comments/1mfpzsc/new_and_changed_products_august_2025_mostly_price/).

Current product status is indicated on each line as follows. OHLQ hasn't publicly explained what these things mean but I've included my best guess below.

* A = Active
 * Regularly supplied and available for purchase
* D = De-Listed
 * No longer carried by OHLQ, may still be available in some stores or the warehouse. Sometimes considered a Last Call product
* I = Inactive
 * Discontinued by the supplier or otherwise unavailable to OHLQ
* S = Special Order
 * Regularly available but in limited supply. Not available in very many stores
* V = Value-Added-Pack
 * Bottle comes with some kind of extra gift like a glass/mug/etc

It acts as a laxative to me.

It makes me hungry.

MCT oil -the same.


Butter causes brain fog, small amounts cause diarrhea.

Even homemade.

If I force it with anti diarrhea pills I got itchy skin from it. Endless brain fog.
Even coffee does not help.



Full fat dairy- cheeses ,milks ,  I have casein intolerance - even raw.

Headache every morning.

Joint pain long term.


I have tried to adapt my body to them with small amounts , or big amounts , but it refuses them.




Palm fat - not good ,  just like olive oil.


The bonus is the joint inflammation.

Olive oil makes me hungry , I am out of breath very easy, brain fog and depression, I can't think fast.

It is the same with beef tallow , egg yolks etc.

PUFA' s both cause me to eat more.

If I try PUFA based diet my fat intake is just 10% from the calories or less.

I have tried combinations with all these fats and I get the side effects of each combined.

5,10,15,20,25,30,35,40% calories from fat - nothing works for me.

These less than 15% calories from fat always have a negative effects on my hormones

I have tried even a low oil diet and it does not  work.

Fixed fat intake also does not work- for example 20,30,35, 88 grams etc.

I eat from the main food groups , foods like:

brown lentils
white rice
almost all fruits
sugar
potatoes
tomato juice
orange juice
meats - only lean
skimmed milk sometimes


My calories are always enough.
I always drink enough water
I always put enough salt.

I don' t tolerate even coffee- acts as a laxative.

I track everything with Cronometer and nothing works for me.


I have low blood pressure often because I can' t eat enough palmitic acid to raise it a bit.

I drink energy drinks sometimes to raise it, just after a meal ,  but the effect is for a few hours.


What would you do in my situation?

**Original** [Post](https://www.reddit.com/r/Marriage/comments/1jqxduv/husband_is_leaving_me_but_wont_give_me_a_reason/)**: April 3, 2025**

Don’t really know the point of this post, no advice needed, just a space to say what happened before I start telling my children and family. About 3 weeks ago, my husband and I had a long talk where he said he wasn’t happy in our relationship. He didn’t give me a specific reason, just that he was not happy. I asked him to put more effort in and see how we both feel after a holiday he was taking with his friends.

Well, during the holiday, he rang me all day every day, sent messages constantly, told me he loved me at the end of every conversation. It was so good having him be like that again.

Today after a few things happening that I wasn’t happy about, I asked him how he was feeling and he said he hasn’t been happy for months, and that he wanted to separate. I asked him to do couples therapy, he said no.

I asked if he was 100% sure this is what he wanted, he said yes. The conversation was a couple of hours long, but that’s the gist of it.  
He says he loves me but he’s not happy when he comes home. I said you realize that you’re not happy with dinner on the table every night, a clean house and a family that love you.

I do 100% of the housework and pay half the bills.

We’ve been together 17 years. This hurts so badly. How can he decide that he just doesn’t want to be here anymore. We have 2 children.  
I asked him when he started feeling like this, he said it was before September. I had no clue at all. But you know what was happening at that time? My mother was dying of cancer. So I didn’t pay as much attention to the relationship.

I’m glad my mother didn’t live to see this, she thought the world of him and she was so sure he’d never do this.

I can’t believe this is happening. I can’t afford the house by myself, even with child support payments. I’ll probably have to move in with my 70 year old dad once my rent contract is up. He’ll not be happy about me and 2 teenagers uprooting his life. But I know I can rely on him.

I am so angry.

*OOP answers some questions from a downvoted* [Comment](https://www.reddit.com/r/Marriage/comments/1jqxduv/comment/mlafq5h/?context=3)*:*

>**OOP:** Yes, I put more effort in while he was on holiday, we spoke constantly and he said I love you in every conversation, as did I. When mum died, my mental health was all over the place, she was sick for a long time and it took me a while to get back to normal but, once I realized I had been like that, I tried to give him more attention. His parents were on a long holiday with us, they stayed for 4 months, which I think must have strained the relationship too. Although I love them to bits and was happy to have them in my house. One night, I picked my husband up from work and brought him to an air b&b for the night, just to spend time together. That’s putting effort in, right?  
I was looking through my WhatsApp chat with him and we’ve exchanged I love you every day, several times a day for the past couple of weeks, including today. We’ve been intimate through all of this too.  
I was blindsided

Commenter: I can almost bet that he is cheating . And why are paying half the bills and doing all the housework?

>**OOP:** (downvoted) He’s not cheating. Not his style. I asked him if he met someone else, he said no. I’ve never doubted his loyalty  
*OOP answers the person's other question:*  
I work less hours, usually 2-3 days a week. He works between 50-60 hours a week. It made sense for me to do the housework and cooking.

Commenter: You should consider working full time. Maybe you can afford rent with a job, alimony, and child support.

>**OOP:** No alimony where I am! I will be looking at getting a better job. I work less hours in the winter, more in the summer so my pay will go up a bit anyway. I hope I can make it work with child support.

Commenter: Stop doing things for him. No laundry, dinner, etc. If he doesn't want the marriage, no gets no perks of the marriage.

>**OOP:** I won’t be doing anymore of it.

Commenter: He said he is unhappy and your response was to tell him to put more effort in. Hmm ok. Do you hear how that sounds? Where do your efforts fit into this? How’s your sexlife? I noticed you didn’t mention anything about that. If you had to guess, what part of your marriage is making him unhappy?

>**OOP:** I didn’t mention our sex life because it was fine. We had sex last Friday, and again on Sunday. But usually about twice a week for years. I worded it wrongly, I told him that we should both put more effort in. I also put more effort in. He hasn’t been putting effort in this year at all. I asked him how can anyone possibly by happy in a relationship that they don’t put any effort into.  
I asked him out to lunch on Monday, he said he has no money, but let’s go for coffee later (didn’t happen) I asked him out for lunch on Tuesday and said I’d pay, again he said no, and again said about going out for coffee, which again didn’t happen.

Commenter: Until you guys stop living together, you need to try find a job with longer hours asap and he will need to start doing half the household labor and looking after the kids fairly too so you have the time to work as many hours as he gets to and get yourself financially ready to be independent.

How old are the kids? Are you going to do 50/50 custody?

>**OOP:** Kids are teenagers, they’ll stay with me and visit him, we already touched on this a little. Rent prices where we live are crazy high, he’ll probably rent a room in a shared house so not ideal for my kids. He also works about an hour’s drive away, and he’ll be looking to move closer to work so the kids won’t see him during the week because of school.

Commenter: He was love bombing you during that trip, that's guilt. Is it possible he wasn't with whom he was saying he was? I wouldn't be surprised.

>**OOP:** He was with who he said he was, there was a group of 5 men, when we video chatted I saw them and said hi etc Ducks are in a row anyway, we never mixed finances and when we last moved house, I took care of everything so it’s all in my name. Only thing I’ll need from him is money.  
We don’t have anything to split or anything like that, no home ownership, we have our own cars anyway.

Here’s the original post I made. Even now, it’s a hard read for me.

[https://www.reddit.com/r/Marriage/s/0ufbXGl55m](https://www.reddit.com/r/Marriage/s/0ufbXGl55m)

So so many people commented saying that he was cheating - and he was. The full story came out a couple of months after the separation. He had been sleeping with someone from work.

I just found out that he is living with her. A while ago he asked me to forgive him and he asked if he could come home. I said no, he hurt me way too much to be able to come home. So now they live together.

I’m having some sort of feelings about this but I’m actually much happier. My house is so peaceful, I love that I live with just my kids. The freedom is unreal. Without him I can do what I want. There’s no one to tell me to wash clothes, cook dinner, or expect sex. I’m 100% sure he treats his girlfriend better than how he treated me.

I even got myself a boyfriend. It’s early days, but he treats me unbelievably well.

Im so hopeful for the future.

Thanks for reading, and to those who gave me advice and told me he was cheating. You were right. I’m glad he’s gone.

***Some of OOP's Comments:***

Commenter: So is your divorce finalized yet? Assuming separation and divorce are not being interchangeably used by you here.

>**OOP:** No divorce yet, we are just separated. I’ll divorce him when we’re able to do a no fault one after a couple of years. If he doesn’t divorce me first that is. I’m not bothered to be honest, it’s not something I’m gonna stress about right now.

Commenter: Any debts he accrues will be half yours. That should be scary enough. You should divorce asap.

>**OOP:** I don’t live in the states. It works differently here

Commenter: This is a legally stupid idea.

>**OOP:** Sure, if I lived in the states, thankfully I don’t so legally it’s the best way to get a cheap divorce.  
We didn’t own a house or anything else together

Commenter: I'm so glad you were able to keep your own place. I haven't been through it so it is hard to understand the difficulties involved. I just see that having to move the kids is almost always mentioned as a barrier to leaving. What helped you get financially free?

>**OOP:** We had separate finances anyway, through my own choice as he’s terrible with money. I get some benefits as I’m now a single mother, along with my pay raise, I’m doing pretty well financially

Commenter: How are your children taking this?

>**OOP:** Now that he’s coming to see them and bringing them to his house, they are much better. It was them that told me about the girlfriend. I didn’t give much of a reaction to the news, just asked if they met her, which they didn’t

Commenter: They aren’t upset with Their father?

>**OOP:** They don’t know he cheated. As far as they’re aware she’s just a new girlfriend. I won’t be telling them he cheated, although the truth always comes out eventually and when they’re older I’m sure they’ll figure it out and I’ll tell them the full story

Commenter: Congrats on living a peaceful life! Sounds like the breakup was a blessing

>**OOP:** Thanks! Definitely couldn’t see it at the time but I’m so much happier now

Commenter: Did he seriously want to come home while still sleeping with her or was he hoping for reconsiliation?

>**OOP:** I have no idea, he said he missed me and regretted everything. He only told me that he had slept with her ‘several times’, but that he wanted his family back. To be honest, I think he just wanted back to his easy life. It never would’ve worked

*Does his girlfriend know he was cheating on you with her:*

>She’s knows!

Commenter: What did his family/your family say about his cheating and moving in with her? 

>**OOP:** His family were disgusted with the cheating. Like myself, they couldn’t believe it. I’m really close to his mum but we avoid talking about him so I don’t know what they think. It was my kids that told me he was living with her.  
My family will never forgive him

Commenter: Curious, how the ex reacted when he found out OP has moved on and is dating another man!

>**OOP:** When he asked to come home I said no, how dare you try to upset my peace like this, and mentioned I’d been on a few dates. He said ‘I didn’t expect you to move on so fast but I don’t judge you’",58,1756785626.0,BestofRedditorUpdates,9,0.94,False

Timemore has been little to no help in troubleshooting. So here I am with a $600 coffee grinder that’s pretty much useless. My questions are 1) does anyone have recommendations for a repair place?

I brush twice daily for around 3 minutes, so I’ve had enough time to notice the differences.

Oral-B Pro 1000
- The oscillating/rotating action feels very different, more like a “scrubbing” motion. It seems to lift surface stains faster, so I’ll sometimes use it if I’ve been drinking lots of coffee or tea.
- Replacement heads are everywhere and they have a lot of variety (cross-action, whitening, sensitive, etc).
- Louder, a bit harsher if you press too hard, and the battery only lasts about a week for me.
- Best for people who want that extra “deep clean” feel and don’t mind charging more often.

Soocas NEOS II
- Cleans really well along the gumline, and the slimmer brush head makes it easier for me to reach the very back molars than with Oral-B.
- Battery life is the real standout. I’m getting close to a full month on one charge. Super convenient for travel.
- Replacement heads aren’t sold everywhere (I order them online and shipping sometimes takes a while).
- Best for someone who wants strong cleaning power, lightweight design, and long battery life without charging constantly.

Sonicare ProtectiveClean
- Feels reliable and gentle, especially on days when my gums are a little sore. The vibrations feel smoother compared to the Oral-B.
- Replacement heads are easy to find at drugstores, Target, Amazon, basically anywhere.
- Battery lasts me about 1–2 weeks before charging. The handle is slightly bulkier than the NEOS II.
- Best for people with sensitive gums or who want a brush that’s super easy to maintain.

At this point, I rotate between them depending on my needs. The NEOS II has become my main daily brush because of the comfort and insane battery life. I keep the Sonicare around for sensitive days, and the Oral-B gets pulled out when I want that polished, scrubbed feeling.",1,1756785373.0,Invisalign,0,1.0,False

Behind the counter are husband and wife — Denny Baby (26) and Parvathy Jayakumar (24) — serving steaming hot bajis, tea, coffee, and fries. Their venture is just a month old, but it is not their first time working side by side. A few years ago, they were nurses, tending to patients. Now, having realised that hospital salaries were not enough to sustain a living, they have turned to street food. 

“It’s been only a month since we set up the cart. Our house is just two kilometres away. We open by 3 pm and stay till 9 pm. The nearby shopkeepers, loading workers’ union members, and even customers have been our biggest support. It is them who even helped us install the cart. There is a beverage outlet nearby; however, we’ve never faced any trouble here,” says Parvathy. 

Parvathy, a Cherthala native, and Denny, from Thodupuzha in Idukki, met while pursuing a diploma in Nursing and Paramedical studies at St Xavier’s School in Kuruppamthara, Kottayam. They got married shortly after the studies. After training, Denny began working at a private hospital in Hyderabad, while Parvathy attended training in Malappuram before joining him in Telangana. “Since ours was an interfaith marriage, my family initially objected. But in time, they accepted us,” Denny recalls. 

The couple returned to Kerala three years ago when Parvathy became pregnant. “In Hyderabad, the salary wasn’t enough. Back here, private hospitals offered us even just ₹5,000 a month, while daily-wage work could fetch up to ₹1,000 a day. That made us give up on hospital jobs,” says Denny. He took up painting work, while Parvathy tried other private jobs with low pay. Finally, they decided to start something on their own. 

Their cart now earns them between ₹2,000 and ₹3,000 daily. “The support has been overwhelming. Even if Denny isn’t here, shopkeepers and union members watch out for me. They helped us install and later shift the cart as well,” says Parvathy. 

They bought the cart for ₹50,000 from one of Denny’s friends, with financial help from Parvathy’s mother, who works in Kuwait. “We weren’t good cooks at first. In the beginning, the food didn’t taste great. But locals shared tips and recipes, 02/09/2025, 13:53 onmanorama.com/news/kerala/2025/08/31/kerala-nurse-work-5000-month-hospital-couple-sells-snacks-living.html https://www.onmanorama.com/news/kerala/2025/08/31/kerala-nurse-work-5000-month-hospital-couple-sells-snacks-living.html 1/2 and gradually we improved. Now things run smoothly,” Denny says. The couple share all tasks — while one brews tea, the other fries bajis — and also cater to parcel orders. 

Their three-year-old daughter Eva, a playschooler, is usually looked after by Parvathy’s father. “If he has other commitments, we take her along. It’s not easy to manage her at the cart, but we take turns,” Parvathy says.  

Looking ahead, they hope to expand their menu. “We’d like to add items like dosa, but that will require more help. Since it’s only been a month, we’ll wait a bit. The highway development work is also going on, so we’re unsure if we’ll have to shift locations,” says Denny. 

Though another baji shop operates nearby, business has remained steady. “Only heavy rains slow things down. Now that the monsoon is ending, more customers are coming,” Denny adds. 

As for their future, the couple remains grounded. “Many advise us to go abroad. But if we can earn enough here by running something of our own, that is the best thing for us,” they say.  In 2017, Kerala witnessed a huge protest as the private hospital nurses went on an indefinite strike demanding better wages. The strike was called off after the government assured to intervene and ensure a minimum pay of ₹20,000. Pursuant to the decision, the Labour and Skills department issued a notification in 2018 revising the minimum rates of wages payable to the employees in the private hospital sector.

Please help in assessing my horrible shots. Ive included a chart of my trials so far. 

I do wdt, and use the normacore v4 calibrated tamper, and bottomless portafilter. the shots look pretty clean in that regard.

Im going to try a ristretto next, with a 1:1 ratio, but im not sure how to do that. Do i just cut the shot short? Probably around 18-20 seconds based on my other shots. Or do I grind finer to slow down the extraction and still aim for 25s+ ? But ive read u should grind coarser to remove bitterness.

I'm new to the coffee world and can't distinguish between flavours quite yet, so im not certain im describing what i taste accurately. I also only drink milk drinks so I taste after ive added milk.

Ive dialed in based on the ratios and numbers ive seen online but it's so bad its undrinkable.

I do a 1:4 ratio for espresso to milk, add some syrup, ice.

the grinder was a bit inconsistent in the beginning with retention so i thought if i increase dose to 18 i would get about 16 out of the grinder but ofc it decide to be a lot more efficient since then. I'm using a kitchen scale and timer on my phone so things aren't 100% precise.

All I have to go off is research and the iced lattes my sister has made me on her breville barista pro. She uses kicking horse decaf dark roast -swp (buys from amazon). They drinks she makes me are 8/10. I wanted to do better.

From research the better setup (but most economical) was a bambino plus and encore esp grinder, and fresh beans.

So that's what I got. I got a decaf peruvian dark roast -swp from a local roaster so my beans are about 10 days now from roast.

I understand dark roasts have some bitterness but also heard they do well in milk drinks. I just don't want to waste the rest of these beans.

I'm definitely going to try a less intense roast next time but I feel like I should be able to get a drinkable cup from these beans.",1,1756785333.0,espresso,1,1.0,False

     -Fixed profile import naming, importing same name profile will rename OLD profile with an appended number after the name
     -Refactored profile commands and removed all radio commands but two, for compounds (prefix/suffix) and wildcards
     -Consolidated all ""wildcard helper"" and other homophone/phonetics commands into a single category (sorted by description)
     -Refactored most inline functions into compiled inline functions so they can be updated in patches and maintained more easily
     -Created public repository on GitHub for global alias review and suggestions (the obvious pre-set ones I handled already)
     -Copied all inline function code to open source public repository on my GitHub along with the DEV TOOLS profile I use to build them
     -All global command aliases, inline functions, and command reference guide HTML template formats can be patch updated on approval
     
     (anytime BMS releases a patch update that changes the Menu.dat, you will be notified and can simply regenerate radio commands)

Our situation: 
HHI: $400k, Bay Area (avg age 32)
NW: $1.2M (approx. $200k in money market, rest in VTI across the usual tax-advantaged + brokerage mix)
Family: 2 kids, planning for a third next year

We’ve been extremely frugal for the past five years and now feel like we “deserve” a splurge (I know, very first-world problem) without blowing up our path to FI. Mid-term goal: ~$5M NW within 10 years.

We rent in a very walkable part of the East Bay. Groceries, preschool, coffee, all within 10 minutes. Car is mostly for Costco runs, occasional (reimbursed business commutes), seeing friends, and about once every three months quality family road trips (Oregon, WA, SoCal, etc.).

Our current ride: leased BMW X3, ends soon. Loved it, but it’s already tight with 2 kids (add a friend and it’s a night mare). With a third kid on the way, we’ll need more space.

We test-drove the Toyota Grand Highlander. Rational choice, sensible NPV (well more like net present loss), and buying used would be the obvious move. But… aesthetics matter, at least they really do for us. And we’re both drawn to Rivian’s minimalist, modern vibe. Our dream build (R1S Duo, max battery, options) = ~$100k OTD.

So our dilemma:
Heart: Buy it. YOLO. Life’s short, road trips are precious, and we’ll hopefully smile every time we drive it.
Brain: $100k for a car? Absolutely nuts. We’ve never dropped this kind of money before. No garage for now also.

Every time one passes us on the road, though, we look at each other and know we’d love it.

So, fellow HENRYs, please roast away. Is this an insane move for our stage in life/finances, or a reasonable splurge we should just own? Be harsh, but productive. The struggle of first-world problems is real. Thanks in advance.

Carlos Alcaraz enters this US Open quarterfinal as a near-actuarial certainty to advance, with odds so short they’d make a spreadsheet weep. At **1.05-1.06** (implied probability: **94.3%-96.2%**) across bookmakers, the implied wisdom is simple: bet on Alcaraz, grab a coffee, and *maybe* check the score later. But Jiri Lehecka, the pesky Czech with a 2-1 career edge over the Spaniard (including a Doha upset), isn’t here to play second fiddle.

Lehecka’s résumé? He’s the only man to beat Alcaraz this year and has survived *four sets in each of his four US Open matches*—a masochist’s dream for bettors eyeing the **OVER 32.5 games line** (-110 across most boards). With Alcaraz’s recent matches averaging **19 games per set** (he’s played 4-6-13 games in his three wins here) and Lehecka’s gritty, extended rallies, this could

However while on here, there was one popular one on UFC regarding Rampage Jackson. OP posted with a title of Rampage Jackson having a ""long post"". I also had a long post also (probably the longest post) I had in a long time in regards to the ufc post incident.  So it just comments on everything you do, but using either different platforms or suggestions and returns back to you. \*

From what I noted, usually they take comment on something that either you put some time in, or something new, or something you returned too. (Pretty much something that held your attention) In such case as above, I put a lot of words in the UFC post. So they got me with a ""long post"" but attached it to Rampage instead.

The above one, I never really posted in Centrist. First day I post, I instantly get the youtube suggestion highlighting ""middle"".

Did this happen on other computers that are not of the same address? No, not at first. But later on it did. So my theory is that, this ai program can connect through different platforms. But there could be certain triggers for them to know its me (despite not logging in emails, youtube accounts, social media). How? Most likely just algorithm of digital foot print.

Say for example, if I were to listen to classical songs while looking up mass surviellance videos. I also look up lo-fi relaxing songs and like watching different coffee mixes. I like watching drinking contests on the occasion.

The over all program might (again just a theory) takes in all my searches and that is 1) classical songs. 2) Mass surviellance videos) 3) lo-fi songs 4) different coffee mixes. 5) drinking contests.

Then it'll calculate the probability of that being me or not, then proceed to continue the program.",1,1756784819.0,u_Negative_Coast_5619,0,1.0,False

1n69bxp,https://www.reddit.com/r/Vent/comments/1n69bxp/seriously_debating_selling_the_house_we_love/,"Seriously debating selling the house we love because of ""nice"" neighbor","My wife and I bought our house, our first house, in 2017. We got a great price, before housing prices shot up, and a good interest rate. We pretty much decided a few years ago that, unless the prices drop drastically and interest rates plummet again, we wouldn't ever sell, as we are in a great position. Then our neighbor kept happening.

Our neighbor is much older than us, in his late 60s, and we are both in our mid-30s.  He is a super nice guy, but one of those who feels the NEED to be involved in everything going on with us. He has been in his house for about 35 years now, no kids, he lost his wife to cancer about 5 years ago, and retired this year.

From the day we moved in, he felt the need to insert himself in everything we are doing. The day we closed on our house, we immediately left the Title Company and went to our new place. We are there for 5 minutes before he comes over and starts telling us about all the issues the old owner had in the house, all the stuff they did to the house, etc. Again, we had owned the house for less than an hour at this point and were trying to celebrate and be happy.

And it only gets worse. We aren't partiers at all, but maybe 6-10 times a year, we have some friends over, I smoke some food, we hang out in our back yard, have a fire, and just hang out. We are not loud, no music or anything. He, on every occasion, just shows up in our backyard asking what we are up to. We try not to be rude, and try and tell him we are just catching up with friends. He eventually leaves, but it's annoying that he constantly stops over when he knows we have company.

If he sees us doing yard work or me working in the garage, he comes over and starts chatting. My wife and I were putting our gazebo together, and he came over and just started chatting about his first gazebo, the one he has now, one he wants to get, etc.

I was doing the brakes on my car, and he came over and started asking, AS I AM CHANGING OUT MY BRAKES, IF I KNOW HOW TO DO BRAKES. He then proceeds to volunteer me to do brakes on his mom's car the next weekend. My wife and I were leaving in 8 days for Mexico, and once we got back from our 7-day vacation, I was home for 36 hours before going to Germany for a month for work. Told him I wouldn't have time, and maybe when I got back i could help him. He then proceeds, the day before leaving for Mexico, to come over with his mom's car and new brakes and rotors, asking if we could do them real quick. I told him no, I am packing and going to be gone for like 5 weeks straight, and I just want to relax in my own house.

He asked to borrow my cordless leaf blower to clean out his gutters one day. I said sure, gave it to him, and went back inside to get back to work (I work from home when not traveling). I am sitting there on a conference call when I hear loud knocking on my roof. I proceed to go outside, and he is on MY FUCKING ROOF BLOWING OUT MY  GUTTERS. I ask him what he is doing, and he says cleaning my gutters. I tell him not to,  and I can take care of it when it's time.

He was cleaning out his garage and asked if I wanted an edger. Told him no, I am ok. The next day, he proceeds to show up at my back door with 3 edgers, asking what one I want. I tell him again, I don't want one, and he just says he'll leave one and leaves it.

A month later, our ring cameras keep going off, as he is FUCKING EDGING OUR ENTIRE FRONT LAWN. We are both gone, and by the time we get home, he is already done. Tell him he didn't need to do that, he says he was doing anyway, so just did ours too.

We have 2 German Shepards and they love being outside. We like sitting outside while they run around and play. If he hears us outside at all, he will start shouting over the fence to chat with us. My wife likes to sit and drink her morning coffee outside in her PJs. She is fully clothed but still in her PJs and not really wanting to interact with people, after all, she is in our yard. He routinely will come over and ask to borrow a tool, ask for milk, ask me to print something, fix his phone, etc.

The latest straw was Friday. I was on PTO and trying to sleep in. He text at 545 AM asking if he can park one of his cars in my driveway, we have a double driveway and you can park one car in it on the side, while still having full access to my yard and garage. I didn't see his text, I was sleeping, and woke up a few hours later to his car parked in my driveway.

And there are dozens of other things I haven't even mentioned.

We have tried repeatedly to set boundaries. Ask him not to do things on our lot/house. Nothing he is doing is mean or bad, at worst it is rude, but most of it his him trying to be nice and helpful. But it's just too much. We just want to live in peace, be able to walk around our house, and not worry that he is just going to be sitting at our back door for some reason. We don't want to burn a bridge and be mean to him, but we are about to that point.

I was crammed into a minivan with my parents and two siblings, heading to scout the university my parents were set on my attending. I lived in a tiny town in Montana, with 40 people in my graduating class. While I'd been to Denver and Minneapolis, Seattle was an entirely new beast to me and the second I stepped out of that minivan into the parking lot of our shitty hotel and breathed in that muggy, piney, late July air, I felt like I was home. 

I spent four miserable years at that university with my bus rides over the bridge on the weekends being my reprieve, the streets on the waterfront, my sanctuary. I'd walk the UW campus and pretend I was a normal student and not an interloper for a few hours. I became a regular at a handful of local businesses.

Back then, I could walk into a coffee shop and drink endless drip coffee while playing on my laptop, late into the night. 


It was a lonely time for me, but the city made me feel like I wasn't alone. 


I got married between my junior and senior years of college - a normal event for women at my school - and my (now ex) husband made us move back to Montana after I graduated. 


I often wonder what my life would've been like if I'd allowed myself to embrace it rather than submit to the powers that had been. I've visited a handful of times since then and there have been tears every time I've ripped myself away.

I wanted to share my coffee journey so far and get some advice from you all . It's been a ride full of hits and misses, and I'm finally starting to feel like I'm getting somewhere.
It all started about two years ago when I bought the Khaldipress and a sample pack from Blue Tokai. I had zero idea what I was doing. I just followed James Hoffmann's ultimate AeroPress recipe, and honestly, I don't even remember what any of the coffee tasted like. It wasn't good, but I just kept at it and finished the whole pack over six months! 😂 I basically had no clue about brewing or what a good cup was supposed to taste like.

About six months ago, I got the itch to try again and ordered Third Wave Coffee's El Diablo blend. It was pretty strong and on the bitter side, but I managed to pull some decent, if not great, cups.

Then came the turning point: Araku's Micro Climate. I fell in love with it instantly. By this point, I had a decent handle on the inverted method and was learning how to adjust my variables. The first two weeks were amazing, but then the pre-ground coffee started losing its flavor, and it was so frustrating trying to extract a good cup. I tried shorter ratios and higher water temps, which helped a little, but the struggle was real.

My current recipe is:
 * Standard method (not inverted anymore)
 * Dose: 10g
 * Ratio: 1:14-1:17 (depending on the freshness of pre ground coffee, more ratio for fresher coffee)
 * Water Temp: Guesstimated with my microwave—1 minute 20 seconds, just when it starts bubbling, then waiting for 30 secs.
 * Bloom: 30-45 seconds (same depending upon the coffee freshness)
 * Steep: 1.5-2 minutes, then plunge. ( More for Light to Medium roast , less for darker roasts )

I also recently tried Co.Phi's Eureka blend without realizing it was a robusta-arabica mix. It was a challenge as i dont like a bold cup, but by shortening the brew time, I got a fair cup with a nice little kick. It's actually perfect for those lazy mornings when I need the energy to get me going.

I know, I know—I've been using pre-ground coffee, and the Timemore C2S on my wishlist is staring me down. I'm definitely getting a grinder soon to have fresher coffee every day.
I'd love to hear your suggestions and advice. Any tips for if to use the inverted or standard method for AP ? I'm all ears!

My girlfriend actually saw Connor at Anime Expo this year ordering coffee at one of the LACC coffee shops and snapped a photo with him. I was so jealous and was again sad that I didn't get to meet him at AX.

Back to AIOC, I was grabbing some drinks for my group at the Starbucks inside the Hilton next door while my friends were taking cosplay photos. I was chilling alone and once my drinks were ready, headed back to the convention. I was also repping the Trash Taste AX 2023 merch (my favorite TT merch design btw). I was crossing the street when a car had let me pass them and give me right of way. All of a sudden, I hear, ""Nice shirt!"" I looked around wondering who said that to me and low and behold, in the car that let me pass with the backseat window opened was Connor waving at me. I was caught completely off guard and yelled ""OMG! HI CONNOR!"" and a couple seconds of waving back and forth. I, then, immediately called my girlfriend to tell her what happened and was fanboying about the interaction I just had.

Even though it was such a small moment, that moment meant a lot to me. I know it's cringe and weird to be parasocial or feel anything towards creators we will never truly know, but the fact that Connor had consciously asked the driver to wait a moment, open the window, and yell ""Nice shirt!"" to me felt really heartwarming.

•        Drinking water before coffee

For the longest time, I was shouting into the void on [X.com](http://X.com) (Twitter).  
  
 I'd spend hours writing what I thought were thoughtful replies, only to get maybe 2 likes and zero follows. As a founder trying to build an audience, it was incredibly frustrating and felt like a massive waste of time.

  


As a dev, I figured there had to be a systematic way to fix this. So for the past year, I've been building BoldTake.

  


It’s an AI that runs on [X.com](http://X.com) and automates the entire engagement process.   
  
Here’s the core of what it does:



Finds high-impact conversations  
It scans for tweets that are getting traction where a reply would actually be seen.



Writes strategic, human-like replies  
It analyzes the context and uses different personas to write replies that aren't the generic ""great post!"" spam we all hate.



Stays undetectable  
This was the hardest part. The platform is constantly hunting for bots. I spent months building in human-like behavior to keep accounts safe—things like randomized mouse movements, natural reading/typing speeds, and even simulated ""coffee breaks.""



The tool is now stable, but before I start pushing the paid plans hard, I want to build a solid community and get real-world feedback from people who are also building things.



The Offer & The Ask:



I'm opening up 100 free spots for a full month of BoldTake (normally $49/month).



No credit card needed. The only ask is that you actually use it and give me your brutally honest feedback.   
  
What's confusing? What feature is missing? Does the AI actually sound like you? Is there a bug I missed?



If you're trying to build an audience on X and want to put your engagement on autopilot, this is for you.

*Eddie had spent three whole days wrangling printers, fabric dyes, and an absolutely unholy amount of sewing material - not to mention the regular raids he had to make on the Arts and Crafts cabin. But here he was: the proud, if somewhat sleep-deprived, lead designer of #RASCALGANG (patent pending).*

*The t-shirts came first. He’d started with plain sky-blue cotton, carefully pressing on the designs he’d printed. The orange collars and cuffs had taken longer than expected. The hoodies were easier - strangely enough - though he still ended up with orange paint on his elbows that refused to wash off. All of them bore Rascal’s adorable sitting pose, but only the t-shirts had the collection's name in bold beneath him.*

*The baseball cap was trickier. It was dyed the same shade of Rascal’s bronze armor - or the closest the boy could manage, at least. The pièce de résistance, however, was the pair of fake ears sewn into the top. Eddie pricked his thumb on the needle more than once, but when he finally stepped back, the cap looked glorious.*

*The stickers were by far the easiest part of the project, but it was the mug that nearly broke him. He wasn’t sure why transferring an image onto ceramic felt harder than any witchcraft, but after three failed attempts, one cracked mug, and a heated argument with the kiln, he finally produced a glossy blue cup with Rascal’s tiny, smug little figure staring back at him.*

*When the day came to present the prototypes to Chiron, Mr. D, and Lady A, Eddie stacked them carefully in a box and made his way to the Big House. All in all, he felt proud. Tired, sweaty, and nursing a new distrust of sewing needles - but proud.*

For context: we're in college, and classes started a week ago.

First of all, in the nicest way possible, he gives off an energy that makes everyone he meets (including me at first) think that he's not straight. He is very expressive with his emotions, loves to smile and laugh and playfully push people, makes sassy hand gestures, asks my opinion on how ""cute"" French tucking his woven sweater is, bemoans how his pants keep slipping off if he doesn't wear a belt because he ""has no hips""... you get the idea. When he mentioned his ex-girlfriends at lunch the other day, our friend point-blank said, ""wait, you're not gay?""

He's told me himself that all of his friends are girls, and he warned me when we started hitting it off as friends that he tends to be very ""physical"" when he displays affection. We've known each other for less than a week, and he hugs me very deeply when we meet and part ways, he's picked me up multiple times, he grabs my arm to lead me around, and he's pulled me down onto a couch or beanbag chair multiple times to cuddle with me. He likes to lie on top of me or put his arm around me and play with my hair, or curl up against me. He tried to braid my hair a few times as well. 

When we're alone and I suggest we hang out in a larger group, he gives me puppy-dog eyes and tells me that he wants to spend time with just me. I asked him if he's this physical with any of his other female friends, and he says that there's no one on our campus that he can cuddle (he moved across the country to attend our university), and that I'm ""the most stable"" (???). 

He told me it takes him a long time--4 months, is the time he gave me--to develop a relationship with a girl. So if he's this physically affectionate after only six days of knowing each other, I'm a little worried that he's affectionate with every girl he befriends. 

The thing is, I really like this boy. He's sweet and honest, and he's unafraid of being vulnerable or showing his true emotions (no toxic masculinity, which is a huge plus!!). We got coffee once, and he tried to get me to order with him so he could pay for me (I refused since I didn't want to take advantage of him). I trust him an unbelievable amount, more than some friends I've known for years, and if you knew me in real life, you'd know that my spirit vegetable is an onion, what with how many layers I put up to guard myself. 

I'm not sure why I'm even making this post. I'm scared he only thinks of me as one of the first friends he's made in college, and he isn't attracted to me as a woman. I'm scared that if we somehow do start to date, I'll turn out to be a jealous girlfriend and his love for physical affection with friends will upset me. I'm scared I'm getting way ahead of myself, and I'm imagining a future with a guy that isn't compatible with me.

I could journal this instead of posting it, but I feel upset and embarrassed and I suppose even just the potential of someone else relating to it or validating me is enough to bring me here. My current thoughts and feelings aren't helped by the fact that I'm also PMSing and have been diagnosed with a more intense form of PMS (PMDD) by my doctor before; basically, the feelings are strong and I know the only thing I can do is to face them, sit with them, feel them.

Essentially, though -- as my title says -- I wish I could just be normal.  I fear I've internalized my CPTSD to the point of it being like some invisible but heavy load I carry on my back and can't put down no matter how hard I try and that in turn impacts how I am in the outside world.

My personal catalyst to this tonight seems trivial -- after a fourth date yesterday, the guy (gently) turned down a fifth date with me when I asked. Silly, right? No big deal, sure. But those four dates feel like a mirror of the various things that are ""wrong"" with me -- attributes, thoughts, behaviors -- that I walk back to my CPTSD, which obviously stems from my childhood abuse. And not some small one fifty feet away that I have to squint to try to see, but one of those 10x magnification ones I can pull up right to my face, the kind that show every pore down to the millimeter. 

**Logical Disclaimer** 

Mentally, I possess all the reasonable and rational thoughts that ground someone when they're actively dating other people. E.g., I can comfortably tell myself that this particular guy isn't meant for me if he wasn't feeling a proper connection. I know that. I've reminded myself there are eight billion people in the world, and I cannot, am not, for everyone, and that can only make the good relationships I *do* have -- be it family, friends, community acquaintances -- all the more meaningful. 

But. From the handful of times I hung out with this guy, he seemed really *good*. And, as I reflect on the (whole whopping >) two weeks I interacted with him for, I'm cognizant of the fact that I don't know him, so it ""could've been"" an act, a front, a mask, etc...but I wholeheartedly did not get that vibe, so I do believe that he was just a really good person. Even though, yes, it's a small sample size of data, a brief and incomplete picture of someone roughly sketched over the course of a few hours.

But he was (or seemed to be) genuinely kind, was gently reassuring when I was explicitly nervous or anxious, was refreshingly chivalrous, and overall just seemed like a well-rounded person. I state this because it's *those* things I observed that *make* the rejection, however unserious or irrelevant, all the more of a gut punch. You know? Basically, I sure as heck didn't care to reflect on a date I had a few years back with a guy who was cocky, unfriendly to wait staff, and said mean things about the comedians we saw after the show -- there was no motivation there for me to admire or be inspired by and certainly nothing intimidating (ergo, no nerves). All this is to say -- I don't think it's the guy *himself*, but the perceived positives of his character and how I felt treated by him that opened the closet door for all of this sh*t to tumble out of. I hate to admit it, but I've wondered multiple times today what it could be about me that makes me undeserving of a genuinely good partner...so...moving on...

**Why I Feel Like a Complete Weirdo**

As I mentioned, these dates feel like a mirror. I've now got a mental list of things I said or did over the course of those dates that make me literally, physically cringe to replay in my head.

**1. I joked about death**. Specifically, unal-ving oneself (as the kids say). And NO, I am not in any way, shape, or form sui-you-know-what. Not at all. Holistically, I like my life, and it's okay, and I feel a sense of a plain contentedness that I've consciously cultivated these past few years. But, alas...I thought I was being funny and, in hindsight, it absolutely was freaking not. I jokingly prompted him for his ""deepest darkest secret"", which he ""umm'd..."" on, to which I loudly chimed in, ""I don't care if I died tomorrow!"" Which isn't true. I'm safe and cautious in my day to day life -- I avoid going out alone at night (being a small female), I wear my seatbelt and practice defensive and safe driving, I don't do anything reckless, and my adrenaline spikes and I act swiftly in potentially dangerous situations. I would *very much* care if my life was threatened, so I'm mortified that I said that. And twice as freaking much because he's had a close loss in his life that I should've kept in mind and been sensitive to.

Yeah. *No.* Not the vibe, girl. Not. The. Vibe. And so my reflection on this is:

**I think I'm presently aimless in life** -- I don't have some tangible goal(s) I'm working towards. Sure, more of what I've currently got would be great -- more friends, a promotion at work, more travel, visible gains in the gym, etc. etc. -- but I'm painfully aware that's simply maintaining the status quo, a type of stagnancy that I'm not proud of. Sure, yes, I've got daydreams -- moving out of state, opening a coffee shop -- but those are just *daydreams*, soft fantasies I can romanticize in between work meetings, not things I feel compelled to research an action plan for. 

Like...maybe that thought came to mind because I don't know what I'm living for. As a kid through young adulthood, of course it was to get through school, to move on up to the next grade, pass my classes, attend sports practice, yada yada, rinse and repeat. And I ""achieved"" the ""final"" step in that process flow by getting a high-paying corporate job in a good field of work. Mission accomplished. Expected promotions have been fulfilled, projects delivered, late hours click-clacking away on my laptop but...that's it. Of course I want to learn and grow and continue to progress, but I'm not *passionate* about that, you know? It's not my drive that gets me out of bed in the morning. It's not something I strategize on during a daily walk or at length about in my journal. It just *is* and I'm okay with that, but certainly that's not enough to sustain some fire in my soul. 

And so my takeaway here is I don't know what I'm living for, and it'd beehove me to figure it the f*** out. But even as I start to ponder it, I panic a little internally because it opens up this whole other set of questions like *Who am I?*, *What do I want in life?*, *What's important to me?* etc. and those are things I've pulled from society and my environment, especially out of a need to just make it through my childhood as best as I could. And so I think that's where my comment came from. There's no big thing *I* am working toward in my future -- ultimately my biggest wish in life is to find my person and fall in love, but that is dependent on someone else, too, meaning it's out of my control/not guaranteed, so I don't consider that a goal at all (probably a wish?). Isn't there some saying that if you don't live for anything, you'll die for nothing? *That* explains this well.


**2. The next embarrassing thing(s) I did (said) were instances I lacked a verbal filter in the name of ""joking"".** I can have a dark sense of humor. Wild, weird, or inappropriate thoughts can spring to mind in certain scenarios (e.g., *ehem*... whilst looking at paintings at the museum on a date). I also threw out a few sarcastic/teasing tidbits to the guy that I now see as potentially rude -- not my intention, of course, but ALSO: Not. The. Vibe. (Again!) I can't copy and paste my unfiltered sense of humor I have with my best friends onto every person I meet and expect them to receive it well. But, upon re-reviewing other past encounters after this one, I can see other situations where I did this and it may have benefitted me to just...not. Of course I don't want to make other people I'm conversing with doubt themselves or feel bad about themselves; I don't want to make people uncomfortable but rather chill, calm, safe if I can help it, you know? But I know we judge ourselves by our intentions instead of our actions, and I certainly didn't put myself in my date's shoes before speaking multiple times even though my intention wasn't malicious.

And I really hope I'm not pulling my CPTSD card here as an excuse. To me, it makes sense, but what if it's just a justification I'm telling myself to tamper down the shame? But...I worry about fitting in in almost every room I'm in (at least at first). I worry it's clear as day that I'm some weirdo whose mother found reason to beat and berate her for years, meaning I'm someone who somehow broke the most basic biological programming human beings have; that everyone, even strangers, can tell I'm an anomaly. And even though that was evident when I was in elementary school, being dropped off at school in a taxi cab everyday due to my mom's DUIs, and it's years and years later and that's no longer the case, I still feel like that little girl stepping out of the dingy cab, getting looks and questions from the other kids in our white picket neighborhood. And so...I don't know. I guess I've hoped that my initial thoughts are funny enough for me to just...word vomit?...them out in most social scenarios (e.g., not work) and hope they land with whomever as funny or silly or goofy. Sometimes they do. But clearly, not always, and this is something I haven't stopped to audit in my life until now. Ouch. 


**3. Lastly (because this is turning into a gosh dang novel and that is NOT what Reddit is for) our conversations on these dates shined a spotlight on my poor self-esteem and self-image**. I try *so, so hard* to be and look the part in society. I have a condo that I beautifully and carefully decorated -- you'd (probably) see it and think, ""this girl has her sh!t together!"". I pour (too much) time into my hair and makeup on a regular basis because I then feel ""conventionally"" attractive, which of course makes most people friendlier, warmer, more welcoming in day to day scenarios. I love fashion and putting outfits together but that, too, stems from a very sad place. In catholic school, as a nine or ten year old, there was some spring day event at school where everyone was told to wear light blue in honor of whatever it was (as opposed to our school uniforms). Girls had pretty light blue skirts and dresses with flowers, some with dark blue or white accents. Meanwhile, my (genuinely clueless) mother (so I can't fault her for that) sent me to school in blue jeans. Sore thumb. Again. I was pulled aside by some administrative person or secretary at the school and was told I wasn't dressed appropriately -- which, as a child, I interpreted as ""you don't belong here"". Internalized that ish. And now I've collectively spent hours carefully picking out clothing pieces, especially for work (in the event that I'm not remote), measuring skirt/dress lengths, finding matching color schemes down to the belt and shoes, checking and double-checking for bra straps and underwear lines. I won't...can't...be that girl again who walks into a room and clearly doesn't belong there right off the bat. I'd rather spend hours and good money on curating the *perfect* outfits, as if they were some armor or something, than feel that way again.

But anyway, in conversation with this lovely man, I was self-deprecating, self-doubting (so I felt dumb, too). I used to be confident as a teenager, derived from some belief that I was ""stronger"" than my peers due to the abuse, and could therefore survive and accomplish ""anything"" (oh, how naive, hah). But I failed my first year of college, igniting a mental health battle at the time, which plummeted my self-image because I was suddenly exactly what I despised about my mother growing up: mentally ill, pitied, concerning. And even though I've collected cool accomplishments since then -- a college degree, the aforementioned great job and beautiful condo, a (positively) tiny body and pretty wardrobe -- my self-esteem never really recovered. I can list out my accomplishments but that feels robotic, rehearsed, and very clearly lacks pride. These feel like things I had to do. You know? So to me, they're no big deal -- nothing special or significant, just...things.

And I'm a perfectionist. I don't view myself as someone worthy of admiration or respect because I can do really well -- working out, cooking, setting aside time for self-improvement and reflection, etc. -- for seven days but fail on the eighth, give up on the ninth, and not pick it *all* back up again at once for another 7 or 21 or 30 days, for example. I'm not crushing it *all the time* and I feel like I have to in order to be proud of myself, which in turn would warrant a positive self-image I could present to people, such as to nice, handsome guys in cocktail bars.

---

**Closing**

I feel like I'm at a fork in the road. Like these four insignificant dates served me multiple examples of things I said, did, embodied that I'd really rather f!!!!ing not now nor in the future. But I don't entirely know how to extract the pieces of me born from my CPTSD. It'd be like trying to separate blood in my veins from blood in my heart; it all seems so interlinked that I don't know where I end and the CPTSD starts. And even now, I feel shame for analyzing this all from the CPTSD lens...because what if it's just a cop out? What if my trauma shouldn't be this big a deal to me and who I am, and I'm just...*using it* to justify undesirable behaviors? I feel okay in situations at times, especially in ones where I'm comfortable (so nowhere new or unfamiliar), but that's probably because all this deep gunk isn't ""triggered"" like it can be in dating (or making new friends, etc.).

I'm not one for voluntarily continuing self-destruction once I can visibly see the damage. If and when I am down, best believe I am going to stand up, or at least *try* to. E.g., I flunked out of my freshman year of college...so, naturally, I busted my butt to get into another school and graduate with a good GPA. I turned to binge eating for comfort while experiencing years-long anhedonia and put on 42 lbs, so I joined a gym and implemented a healthy diet and a calorie deficit, losing 25 lbs at the time (now down 37 lbs from my highest weight). My relationship with alcohol escalated extremely over the course of the pandemic to the point of a rock bottom one Sunday night, sobbing in such a heavy emotional pain (having also been broken up with around that time)...so, after trying multiple times before to quit, I said f*** it, vowed to quit cold turkey, and haven't had a drink in over 1200 days now (3+ years). If something is wrong with me and in my control, I want to do anything I can to resolve it. I try. I do. And so I hate the thought of perpetuating some of these things about myself that I don't like.

I went through a bad breakup last year and have taken baby steps to developing a more positive outlook on life as a result. I notice a difference in my head on occasion, but I don't think I've learned how to translate that to my exterior -- how I interact with others, my energy, ""aura"". I think I'm ultimately still that sad, scared girl I was at nine years old with no safe space, really. I work hard to try to find something, anything, positive in certain scenarios with friends or on my own -- pointing out the good in something, like parking a car 10 minutes away in the snow late at night = I'm able-bodied with the privilege of a car (then) instead of spending money on Ubers; or telling a friend going through a crappy break-up that it could always be worse, the toxicity could've continued or whatever the heck. I try to look on the bright side -- I've gotten a lot better at it. But it just doesn't seem like it's enough to outweigh me, who I am, who I've become since being that little girl, and all the ways my mother's treatment dented and scratched and broke me. And that in turn makes me wonder if I'd just be fake if I *did* practice minimizing some of my more CPTSD-influenced traits and behaviors.

I don't want to believe that the only way I could be someone I genuinely love and respect is if I'd had a neurotypical, loving, healthy mother. I really, really don't. But what if it is? Then what? Then what am I supposed to do?",1,1756782883.0,CPTSD,1,1.0,False

just was looking for some feedback on how I handle sleep and exercise on my shifts. I'm kinda terrified as night shift increases risk of heart disease, and combined with the ADHD meds I need to take to be functional day or night my risk may as well be doubled so Im trying to crack down on my habits.      
for reference, my schedule is 7 on 7 off 9pm to 7am, job is generally sedentary but I have a standing desk.

sleep:    
- no caffeine past 3am.        
- light breakfast before bed so hunger doesn't interrupt sleep, generally no more than 300 calories.     
- 1g magnesium with the light breakfast + if I've been having trouble maintaining the schedule supplement with 0.3mg melatonin.    
- sleep apnea under control (mandibular advancement device)     
- sleep mask, ear plugs, white noise machine, blackout curtains.      
- sleep 8am - 4pm on the on weeks, off weeks can vary by a max of 2 hours from that schedule (so if I want to be up a little earlier then most I'll adjust is to 6am-2pm)        


exercise:        
- on weeks generally give me a max of 4.5 hours before I have to leave for work unless I sleep in a little, and that time does not include any prep, chores, meals, personal hygiene, etc.. To make the most of my home time, the workouts need to be short but effective. I do strength workouts using bodyweight and dumbbells 3-4 days of the week but that's been it until recently. trying to increase my steps and get some higher intensity activities in there. I figure at least 4 days of the week I can start incorporating 15 minutes of high intensity cardio by jumping rope, but usually when it comes to lower intensity walking it takes more time and sometimes I have to choose between walking or getting a chore done. I'm aiming for only 5k steps on days where I don't jump rope.     
- at work best I can do is spend as much time standing as I can, I haven't been keeping track but I try to do like half the night standing. it's just easier for me to focus sitting.   
- off weeks I aim for a goal of 10k steps  (minimum 8k if I'm lazy) and keep to the strength workouts.      

diet:     
- food is my enemy, I'm still working on this. :( . i generally fast during my shifts though. just water and black coffee.

Who is this chrome-plated, exhaust-belching menace, this self-appointed maestro of auditory misery? I’m talking about the driver of that green monstrosity, a pickup so loud it could wake up a coma patient in Topeka. 

This guy—let’s call him Exhaust Eddie—must think he’s the star of *Fast & Furious: Lawrence Drift*, revving that obnoxious, aftermarket exhaust system like he’s auditioning for the apocalypse. You can hear him coming from three ZIP codes away, his truck roaring like a chainsaw gargling gravel. It’s not a vehicle; it’s a sonic war crime. Every time he floors it down Massachusetts Street, windows rattle, dogs howl, and my poor grandma’s dentures pop out from the sheer vibration. 

What’s the deal, Eddie? Did you install that exhaust to compensate for something, or do you just enjoy making babies cry and squirrels scatter like they’re fleeing Godzilla? I bet you spent $3,000 at some shady auto shop to make your truck sound like a dragon with bronchitis, all so you could terrorize the good people of Lawrence trying to enjoy their artisanal kombucha in peace. Newsflash: nobody’s impressed. The only thing you’re winning is the award for “Most Likely to Cause a Citywide Noise Ordinance.”

And let’s talk about your driving, shall we? You’re peeling out at every stoplight like you’re late for the Monster Truck Rally, leaving a trail of shattered eardrums and existential dread. I saw a barista at The Roasterie drop an entire tray of lattes when you roared by, Eddie. That’s on you! Those were ethically sourced beans! Do you know how many yoga classes were ruined because people couldn’t hear their “om” over your truck’s “BRAAAAAP”? 

I get it, you love your green Chevy Classic 1500. It’s your pride and joy, your four-wheeled midlife crisis. But here’s a hot tip: if you want to make a statement, try a bumper sticker or, I don’t know, a personality. Instead, you’re out here turning Lawrence into a post-apocalyptic soundscape, making us all wonder if we accidentally wandered into a Mad Max audition. 

So, Exhaust Eddie, for the love of all that is holy, take your green noise machine to a mechanic and ask for a muffler that doesn’t sound like a B-52 taking off. Let Lawrence’s streets be filled with the gentle hum of bicycles, the chatter of students, and the occasional street performer, not your truck’s impression of a volcanic eruption. Until then, we’ll be over here, investing in noise-canceling headphones and praying you move to a town that deserves your decibel dictatorship. Somewhere far, far away.

Rating scale showed at the end.  
  
🔥 Orange Cream Coffee: Pass (9/10)  
  
This is a phenomenal drink that earns a pass. Unlike most coffee drinks that are either overwhelmingly bitter or overly sweetened, this one strikes a perfect balance.  
  
It keeps the espresso's signature velvety texture and flavor notes, while the in-house orange cream enhances and uplifts it.  
  
The drink is a subtle and refreshing tug of war between bitter, sweet, and tangy, making it a perfect start to your day.  
  
🔥 Pour Over (Sitio Alegre): Pass (8/10)  
  
This pour over is a solid pass. While the coffee itself was very good, what truly elevated the experience was how it was served.  
  
It came in a carafe with an accompanying cup, as well as a separate tube filled with ice.  
  
This allowed me to enjoy the same coffee at two different temperatures, which really brought out the complexity of the bean.  
  
The hot coffee highlighted pineapple and floral notes, while the cold version brought out clear mango notes. This turned the drink into a memorable experience.

Two years ago, I decided to play Hollow Knight and ended up falling in love with it. The difficulty was perfect for me (I like challenging games). When I started facing the dream bosses and NKG, the game made me sweat, but I was able to beat them.

That was until I reached the Pantheon of the Knight...and Pure Vessel. I didn't think I was capable of completing the entire pantheon and facing a boss that seemed impossible to me. So after almost 35 hours and a lot of frustration, I quit the game at 111%.

I literally spent months dreaming about Hollow Knight and how I had abandoned the game (I had never left a game unfinished before). So it became an obsession for me.

After the announcement of Silksong, I decided to install Hollow Knight again. I made myself a liter of coffee, dreading having to remember all the boss strategies again, and then my muscle memory gave me an unexpected advantage. I entered the Pantheon, reached Pure Vessel, and defeated him on the first try with only one mask left.

As I said, I'm shaking, and I've never felt this way about a game before. Now I can say that I've completed 112% and let the Knight rest at last.

I don’t have anywhere else to put this so here I am. I am chronically lonely. I’ve always been the odd one out. I haven’t had a solid bff since grade school and in retrospect I feel like it was circumstantial (our parents were friends so we were friends type thing). When I moved in my teens, I had to deal with a huge cultural shift and kids that were already cliquey. I finally found my tribe so to speak, but I was always the “other” one. The one who didn’t quite fit for whatever reason. They weren’t purposely exclusionary, there were just certain things I couldn’t do with them or relate to because of the way I was being raised vs how they were being raised. I’m still in touch with my old high school bff that I was closest with, but I still don’t fit into her life even as adults. I’m not close with any of my family members (cousins, siblings, etc) although I desperately want to be. Again, I just don’t fit. I love them. I think they love me. I just feel 0 support. 

This is hitting hard for me this past week. One of my parents is in hospital. It’s not great. I’m trying to remain hopeful while being supportive to them and their spouse/my other parent. I’m there at the hospital as much as I can be, even though I really just want to cry in bed. I ask the medical staff questions and provide as much insight as I can about their patient before they arrived in their care. I make sure my other parent takes care of themself while they are trying to look after their spouse. I am eternally grateful that my parent has had so many visitors - classmates, siblings, cousins, children, nieces, nephews, grandchildren, and constant phone calls checking on them from those too far to make it to town. My heart is so glad for them. I know it matters. They are showing up when it matters. 
Contrast that to when I was in the hospital. I don’t know if anyone even bothered to tell anyone I was unwell. I got no phone calls checking on me from any family or friends or acquaintances. It’s not like I was suddenly missing from a group chat or that I suddenly wasn’t returning calls. No one calls or texts me anyway. I’m not in anyone’s group chat. Even my own parents didn’t come see me. No one brought my child(ren) to see me. No get well soon cards or stuffies or flowers were sent. Only one person came to see me that whole week. MM. That’s literally all I have in the way of people that actively support me. He’s (for obvious reasons)6 limited with what he can do. It sucks but he’s pretty much my only friend. 
I do reach out  to my former friends. They will talk to me but then there’s no follow up. I get a quick in person coffee chat if I’m lucky that year. Otherwise, I can’t even get a text back. I’m too intimidated to try and make new friends. The cliques are even stronger now. If you’re not already in a friend group, you’re just SOL. Maybe I just suck. Maybe my breath is bad. Maybe I’m too much. Maybe I was evil in a past life and this is my penance. I don’t think I’m any of those things, but it certainly makes one question oneself. I can’t even say this is karma for being an AP because it’s been like this for pretty much all my life. Thank you for reading if you’ve made it this far. You’ve done more than most. You listened. Thank you. 
TL:DR seeing how supportive my parent’s loved ones are being while they are in hospital has caused me to spiral about how empty my life is. MM is my only friend.  This sucks.

I had just graduated high school and was trying to scrape together enough for college textbooks, rent, and a bus pass, basically anything that would let me survive the month.

One evening, I stopped by a small corner café for coffee. I only had a few dollars, not enough for the muffin I really wanted. As I was debating whether to just grab the coffee, a man in his 50s leaned over from the next table, smiled, and said, “Take it. You look like you could use a little treat.”

I froze. I wanted to argue, to say no, but his smile said otherwise. He paid for the muffin and my coffee, gave me a nod, and went back to his paper like nothing had happened.

I walked out clutching that muffin like it was a treasure. But what stuck with me wasn’t the food, it was that someone saw me struggling and did something kind without expecting anything in return.

I still think about him often. That moment reminded me that even small acts can ripple through someone’s life in ways they might never fully realize.

# SX-4: Character Environment ~ by Sphiratrioth

Welcome to the new age of roleplaying. Create the SX-4 format characters with embedded lorebooks, activate the SX-4 framework lorebook, choose a setting, an open scenario (20+ very general situations & 100+ specific presets) and a location (50+ universal or setting-matched locations) and the LLM will generate a different starting message for the same variables - every single time. No more repetitive roleplays with a fixed starting message. Time of the day/night & weather will be rolled automatically to add even more variation to your experience. Highly customizable roleplays without editing the once created character cards and no additional extensions needed!

https://preview.redd.it/z5gxtvfh2omf1.png?width=989&format=png&auto=webp&s=077f8510f24d677dcc2594fcf64da9267056e25a

# What is it?

SX-4 format cards are just the normal V2/V3 character cards but with special, custom lorebooks & system prompts. There is a single lorebook to activate the environment (\~900 entries), separate lorebooks with different scenarios to choose from, and the character lorebooks embedded with a character. You trigger a given scenario/scene/other variables such as character's mood etc. through the normal chat window, you hit enter and the instructions in the invisible instructions from the lorebooks are sent to the LLM without appearing in the chat. Thanks to them, a starting message for the roleplay scene is generated - different starting message every single time. No roleplay feels the same - even for the same scenarios and optional variables. No boring repetitions, no more roleplays with the same starting message again and again, no need to even come up with starting messages. The LLM will do it for you. On a top of that - different scenarios may be mixed together. For example, if you want a scene to start in the sci-fi cyberpunk world, you can keep it SFW, you can turn it NSFW or you can even add a supernatural horror/hunting flavor to it. You do not need to edit a character card itself, you do not need different variants of the same card either. You do not need any extensions - just a raw SillyTavern and my custom SX-4 Environment lorebooks.

https://preview.redd.it/fmg38qhi3omf1.png?width=1440&format=png&auto=webp&s=a6315efc2c4426833da4dc75cbeec398a52db09f

In other words - everything matches everything and anything may be chosen or rolled randomly. I am a game designer for AAA games studio, I do it for living - I make stories and games in a modular form - thus - my roleplays also work just like that.

# What it does?

* it allows creating character cards in a flexible SX-4 format and making drastic changes with each roleplay but without editing the character cards themselves;
* it generates a different starting message every time (no more repetitive roleplays);
* it automatically randomizes time & weather for a current scene - so the same scene/scenario may happen at different hour and in a different weather;
* it makes it possible to select a specific, setting-matching location or it rolls it for you randomly;
* it allows picking up all those options from a normal chat window (no need to edit a character card itself, no need for multiple versions of the same character);
* it guides characters in a specific way druing roleplay - to improve the experience, to make a characters more realistic, lively and to allow characters to take the initiative that LLM do not usually do - both in SFW & NSFW (I created a lot of custom instructions that are silently inserted throughout the whole roleplay, you do not see them, you do not need to trigger them, it happens all on its own - like OOC on steroids, not visible in chat and fully automatic - this is a very powerful tool and the approach I'm developing since last summer);
* it does not require any extensions nor advanced knowledge - just pick up the intuitive trigger words from the convenient lists presented in alternative starting messages (remember though - you roleplay only in the default starting message - all the alternative starting messages serve just as convenient lists of the available options and their corresponding trigger words);
* it allows randomly rolling almost all the available options - or you can choose everything just the way you want;
* it is a debloated and much more polished, 2x better version of my previous SX-4 Environment;

# How to set it up?

**Download all the files in the repository:**

1. Navigate to the files section of this post and download the files.
2. Choose the AIO version or the modular version. AIO includes NSFW and it is just one lorebook to activate in SillyTavern. Modular version allows selecting separate modules freely but you need to activate more lorebooks. BEWARE: DO NOT MIX THE AIO AND THE MODULAR LOREBOOKS!
3. Import the SX-4 example Characters, the lorebooks SX-4 lorebooks & the SX-4 sysprompts in SillyTavern. Use the character import functionality within the SillyTavern for character cards or copy-paste the .png character card files to (...):\\SillyTavern\\data\\default-user\\characters. Then, copy-paste the lorebook files into your SillyTavern lorebooks directory aka (...):\\SillyTavern\\data\\default-user\\worlds. You need just one ""00. AIO - SX-4 (Framework) (Gender)"" lorebook + all the scenario lorebooks or a varied number of the modular version framework lorebooks + all the scenario lorebooks. REMEMBER: Choose only the AIO or only the MODULAR framework lorebooks, do not mix those two formats together. They are the same - in one pack or split into SFW & NSFW parts. Finally, copy the system prompt files to (...):\\SillyTavern\\data\\default-user\\sysprompt.
4. Select the SX-4 Sysprompt - a roleplay version (longer AI responses) or a conversation version (shorter AI responses). Of course, choose the Sysprompt with a narration perspective you prefer (1st person/3rd person)
5. Activate the lorebooks: Framework \[AIO\] + Scenario lorebooks or Framework \[MODULAR\] lorebooks + Scenario lorebooks.
6. Select the character you want to roleplay with. Make sure to import the embedded Character Lorebook & Regex. You should be prompted automatically to do so.
7. Navigate to the alternate starting messages to check the list of all the available options and their trigger words.

**Roleplay:**

1. Return to the DEFAULT STARTING MESSAGE. BEWARE: THIS IS THE ONLY MESSAGE WHERE YOU ROLEPLAY. ALL THE ALTERNATIVE STARTING MESSAGES ARE JUST THE TRIGGER WORDS LISTS - FOR CONVENIENCE. DO NOT ROLEPLAY THERE!
2. Type in the trigger words you want. You need a scenario at minimum, you can add the location if you want or roll it randomly. You can also choose a character mood if you want.
3. Hit ENTER - the actual starting scene/message for a roleplay will be generated. If LLM makes a mistake, just try again.

# Edit a Character Lorebook

In the X-4 environment, a majority of the character definions (and some user definitions) are located in the embedded character lorebook - rather than in a character card itself. Because of that, you are advised to edit the lorebook entries when you want to change anything or when you want to swap one of the constant variables - such as:

1. Relationship with User,
2. Character's Outfit,
3. Setting,
4. Character's Personality, Appearance, Profession, Residence, Sexuality, basically all the normal character definitions;
5. Specific NSFW options & preferences.

You do it by switching the trigger values from 0 (deactivate) to 100 (activate) & vice versa for one entry within a tagged group - such as: RELATIONSHIP WITH USER. Of course, you can also edit the entries. There are even some entries tagged as OPEN or CUSTOM - for your convenience - and this is where you place your own definitions.

The general idea is to edit a character within the lorebook instead of within a character card - and since the entries stay in there, you do not need to touch them ever again - just trigger them ON/OFF within the same entries group. Groups are intuitive, logical and easily recognizable due to the organized tagging system of the SX-4 environment.

# Hot-Swap Outfits

You can hot-swap the outfits mid-scene by opening up the embedded character lorebook and switching the trigger values for the outfit entries. 100 = activate, 0 = deactivate. When you swap the outfit like that, the instructions in the roleplay context are also swapped and that is the only way of hot-swapping mid-roleplay that I know of at the moment (September 2025).

# Lore Entries

SX-4 embedded Character Lorebook includes the entries for your actual world/lore info. They are further down the lorebook and they are clearly tagged. Feel free to use the slots provided by me or... just clone the last empty LORE ENTRY slot to make even more. They work as your normal world entries. I like using them to define the character's relatives and personal stuff while keeping all the actual world info in separate lorebooks for a given world - rather than binding them to a particular character. Feel free to use the world lorebooks from my GM-4 environment. They are all compatible - for a reason.

# CG-4

https://preview.redd.it/g3sbrma23omf1.png?width=1024&format=png&auto=webp&s=b4f2cd9f3d87ae7c08aa4109db63e61b81475496

CG-4 aka Character Generator 4 is a set of carefully crafted personalities & body type archetypes within the SX-4 Environment. They are all turned off by default and located further down the embedded character lorebook. If you want to use any of those functionalities, you need to modify a character by a bit - to follow the example of the CG-4 format. It basically splits the ""Appearance"" block into two separate blocks: ""Face"" - where all the hair, eyes and facial features are defined; and ""Body"" - where all the body features come from but they refer to the hair color and other features defined within the ""face"" block. It may look discouraging at first but refer to the provided CG-4 character example to see how it looks like.

When you already have a character prepared like that, simply activate one of the CG entries within the lorebook - the one you want to use - and watch the magic happen. I guarantee you that the current list of personalities & bodies allows creating any possible character out there. All of the popculture characters in movies, games and books follow a short list of repeatable archetypes - and we use those archetypes in professional game dev, for instance, to make our games. Writers or movie makers do exactly the same - more or less consciously than us and that is the only difference. Just give it a try. Think of any character you want to create, pick up the closest matching personality archetype, the closest body, fill up all the standard definitions such as background etc. - and you will be surprised how well the LLM roleplays exactly what you wanted.

Most coffee shops, if they offer chai at all, make it from a concentrate.

I am looking for advice. I've been married for about two years and my husband and I have always liked going out together and drinking on the weekends. When we first met, we went out like once every two weeks. However, over the past 7 years this has slowly devolved into him becoming a binge drinker. There was a period for around 6 months where he was unable to work earlier this year and that's when it got particularly bad because he didn't have a set schedule or responsibilities.

He is working now again and things are better. He still likes to party and go out, but sometimes he can just have two beers and go home. Sometimes we get drunk one night and he's fine the next day, or only has a few beers the next day in the evening. However, other times it's a full weekend binge. The night we go out he will stay up til 5 or 6 am drinking. He drinks until he passes out basically. Then, when he wakes up the next day he starts drinking again. He tries to hide it from me but I hear him crack open a beer in the shower/ bathroom. Then he spends the whole day getting plastered without eating or barely eating. After that if it's a Sunday, he may even keep going. Three or four days he will keep drinking.

I am just having a really hard time understanding why sometimes this happens and other times he can control it. I'm at my wits end honestly. For awhile we didn't keep alcohol in the house, however, we had family in town last week so now there is alcohol readily available.

I basically spend weekends like this babysitting him and making sure he is okay. However, by the second day he's pretty unpleasant to be around. Today, was a holiday and I worked but he kept drinking. I felt so disgusted and upset. I know that a lot of times he likes to drink and hang out with me so I just left the house and worked from a coffee shop. I'm not sure if me being gone helped or just made him get more plastered because he felt lonely.

I am just looking for advice. Is there anything that you know has worked in the past for you or a loved one?",2,1756782046.0,AlAnon,5,1.0,False

I haven't told my parents that I'm doing Irish specifically, but they have gotten the notifications of 'Kitty increased their Duolingo score to 5!' and so on.

My words were 'Dia duit! Caife le bainne agus siúcra, le de thoil.' (Hello! Coffee with milk and sugar, please!)

  
He was absolutely delighted. It was so fun to see. He made me a cup of coffee. My dad knows that I don't necessarily love the taste of coffee itself, but that I love caffeine (and I only got around three hours of sleep, so I needed some that morning), so he made it mostly milk, and put some sugar in it.

I just graduated college and I'm looking for a job, but I'll be moving back to my college town in about a week for unrelated reasons, and I regret not standing up for myself hardly at all this summer because I feel like it's too late not. Please don't get me wrong, I'm incredibly thankful for him giving me a place to stay and for so long, but when his own fiancée who's barely known me is consistently treating me way better than he is even though he's known me for almost his entire life (and obviously all of mine) I just can't help but feel repeatedly hurt.

For example, this morning his fiancée made coffee and it smelled really good, so I went to their home office where both of them were (they're doctors and they were studying for board exams) and asked if I could try some of her coffee. She was wearing headphones, but instead of tapping her on the shoulder or something and being like ""hey, Guava wants to know if he can try some of your coffee,"" he just responded for her in this really annoyed tone and said ""you can have a sip. She's studying for her board exams though so you can just have a sip."" Now, I was referring to the coffee *grounds* and I felt like that would have been obvious to her (he doesn't drink coffee) because *obviously* I'm not gonna drink straight from her pot (he kindly dusted off an old coffee maker they had in the garage at the start of the summer for me so we'd never be confused about whose coffee was whose, but now that I think about it I think this just goes back to his whole hatred of sharing thing that I'll expand upon in a minute), but this really bothered me because literally she is her own person and can respond for herself, not to mention I have shared my own grounds with her once and thought nothing of it.

I'm personally very much of the ""I'll get you this time and you can get me another time"" mentality but can accept it if a roommate wants to split everything perfectly down the middle with receipts and everything (though with some annoyance), but with friends that is just crossing a line for me and for family that's just fucking disrespectful as hell, but he doesn't even do that, he'd rather there be two of everything, one for him and his fiancée and one for me. At first I just put up with it because I was like okay whatever his house his rules but with how often I've shared my own things with them just for him (and ONLY him, because again, she treats me way better even though we're practically strangers) to never reciprocate just feels like a huge slap in the face. I'm vegan and they're not and while I have absolutely zero expectation of them to cook vegan food just so they can share it with me, I really don't think I'm entitled for expecting them to share things like sriracha and tea, especially when I've bought all the refills on kitchen supplies like salt, cooking oil, and paper towels. I also had this sneaking suspicion that he was upset with me for using these things, and hopefully by buying them I assuaged some of that, but I always feel like it's always the wrong time to bring things up with him if that makes any sense because I feel like I'm constantly walking on eggshells around him with how easily he gets annoyed with me. This suspicion isn't unfounded either, I remember one day I offered to mix three drinks (one beer, a can of soda, and a can of flavored sparkling water) for the three of us, and he told me that all the sparkling waters and sodas were ""respectfully"" theirs and that'd like me to stop grabbing them, even though I was also buying drinks for the fridge that they would never take, presumably out of trying to be respectful in his view, but when he's also doing shit like making a fresh pot of rice the day after I did instead of asking if he could have some of mine (which I don't think he should even have to ask! it's literally rice it takes like three seconds to make), it comes off less as him trying to be respectful and more as him trying to make me be a stranger. I literally share shit like this with roommates I didn't know before being their roommate and who I didn't even always have positive opinions of; how the fuck are you gonna treat me more distantly than someone I don't even like??

I really want to reiterate that I never feel like I can bring anything up to him. While part of this is definitely my fault for not just ripping the bandaid off and seeing how it goes, when we were growing up together he would always yell at me when I wanted attention from him like playing a video game together and he would constantly get mad at me over the tiniest of things which really wrecked my self esteem since I was literally in elementary school getting constantly yelled at by someone who's way bigger than me and who I just wanted love from, and I mention this not because I'm still stuck in the past but because the pattern hasn't changed, the only thing that's different now is instead of him going off on me he'll become incredibly passive-aggressive and develop this really rude tone. Like, there are times where the two of them are just silently studying, or (because of the nature of their disciplines she has to study more than he does) she'll be studying while watching him play a video game, and I'll ask if I can sit with them while I apply for jobs, and sometimes he'll say (I'm now realizing it's always him who decides) sure, and other times he'll be like ""I mean *I guess*...."" and like I get that you're living with your fiancée and sometimes want to spend time with her alone, but if that's what is I'd prefer you just honestly tell me ""not right now, sorry, I want to just be with her right now"" instead of treating me like I'm not literally family. They invited me to spend time with them a couple times at the start of the summer but then that quickly stopped and I don't know why. I just don't get it. He's always happy to see me and likes talking to me when I'm in the kitchen or dining room or living room, but then whenever it comes to me approaching him instead of the other way around it's a 50-50 change he gets needlessly pissy with me.

And again, his fiancée never treats me like this! She's an extremely kindhearted person and frankly more emotionally intelligent than he is, and while I don't know all the details of their relationship I can tell she's aware of this from the things she'll say to him when he's worked up or when he's treating me with passive aggression in front of her (today was an exception since she had headphones in). I could go on and on but it just really fucking sucks, I've been making excuses for him to myself all my life but I honestly can't anymore seeing just how much better I'm being treated by her. It just really hurts...

Edit: I just wanted to add that we didn't grow up rich so I really have no idea where this comes from. Our parents are considerably better off (ie. middle class) now than they used to be and so they're able to give me money for groceries, minimum credit card payments, and some small treats for myself, but growing up our parents would constantly fight over how they would pay the bills and shit was just never working properly in our house so he is by absolutely no means a stranger to having to share. Maybe he hates it so much because we were forced into it by our economic situation?? And now that he's making more money as a doctor he doesn't want to go back to it? I seriously don't know but I also don't think it's this, this is honestly a pretty shitty guess but it's also all that i have to go off of :/",2,1756781561.0,TrueOffMyChest,2,1.0,False

1n68994,https://www.reddit.com/r/velabasstuff/comments/1n68994/my_roommate_found_a_new_pair_of_shoes_by_the/,My roommate found a new pair of shoes by the dumpster. We should have never put them on,"When guests visited our apartment, they always commented on the smell—something old, almost medicinal. We blamed the building’s age, and after removing their shoes to come in, they’d eventually stop noticing it. Three years later and I still smell it. Reminds me of hospitals from my childhood.

My roommate Paul had the bigger room because he was here first, and I had responded to an ad online to rent the other. Kitchen, common area where we had the TV and our gaming consoles, dining nook, and a covered patio. Paul and I got along even though we came from different worlds. His was one that required a lot of posturing with friends and being perpetually online. Mine was maybe lonelier.

Somehow, we clicked, and after our respective workdays we often found ourselves collaborating on meals and playing games late. I liked RPGs; he preferred co-op shooters which I joined reluctantly because he got frustrated, yelled, and gave me side-eye whenever I suggested staying calm. He blamed his thick fingers.

From our apartment you could look down at a parking lot where every Tuesday garbage trucks made their rounds at 7 a.m. to the chagrin of tenants whose bedrooms faced that way, like mine.

I feel like these are important details. I’m describing my life as it has been for a while. It’s where I live, and it’s where I am now. It’s the mundane little facts that I need to tell you, so that they serve as counterweights to the hefty truth I’m about to unload, in search of sober advice. I just need to tell it so that you can understand. You won’t understand, but I’ve got to at least try.

“Olly, check it out!” I remember Paul said. I slurped some cheerios messily and looked up from my phone.

“What up?” I said.

“Those look new.”

I lazily pulled myself up and looked out the window.

“Huh? What, where?”

“Those shoes. I’m gonna go get them.”

Paul rushed out and soon emerged in the parking lot. I watched him step gingerly in his moccasins to the dumpster, and scoop up the pair of bright white sneakers, grinning up at me as he scurried back.

The door slammed. I pressed into my lower back to stretch as Paul came in. He proudly displayed the pair of shoes in one hand and snapped with the other.

“Tight!”

“They don’t stink,” I said.

The shoes were completely white, and despite sitting by a dumpster were impeccably clean.

“Smell like roses, these,” he said.

“Well, will they fit?”

“Size 11 baby!” he confirmed.

“Nice coincidence.”

Now we’ve come to the part of the story I can’t really expect you to believe. I wouldn’t. In my family we’ve seen tragedy. My younger brother was born with a disease that meant lots of operations before he could even walk. Hospitals became second homes; iodine soap a familiar salve; plastic-wrapped food and peel-back tin capped juice in those milky plastic containers a family meal. I accompanied my parents every time they went, and each time was like sucking the color out of dreams, the whimsy out of imagination. I didn’t grow up all at once, but my childhood was not child friendly. I learned that life was limited, solutions pragmatic and usually muted and smelly.

“Lemme try ‘em on,” said Paul.

He sat on the couch, pulled off his moccasins, put on the right shoe, then the left. And disappeared.

As soon as he put those shoes on, he was gone. Gone not in any sense that is common. I mean gone without any real-world indication that he was there before. Gone without any vision, nor any sound that would signal his disappearing. He was there, then he wasn’t, as if his existence simply ceased.

I watched the couch cushion slowly reform itself where Paul had been sitting. I was still standing, but I had moved back up against the wall and my palms were pressed against it as if expecting the room to suddenly fall away or for gravity’s pull to shift 90 degrees.

What felt like eternity was only a minute, and then Paul was back, sitting on the couch, panting, one of the new shoes in his hand. He looked around like a stranger before finding my eyes and locking on, making me feel like prey.

“Fuck!” I yelled.

“Fuck,” he whispered. He slowly regained control of his breathing and then yelled, wide-eyed at me. “Fuck! Olly!”

“What!” I screamed back, shaking. “What!”

Blood rushed back into his face as his complexion softened, and his eyes narrowed.

“Bro,” he said. “You won’t believe it.”

I didn’t believe it. He told me that he was in a forest. He said it was hot and humid, and the noises of insects, birds and dripping rain were as vivid as anything here. He struggled to recall things at first because of the shock, but as we calmed down, he told me he had truly been there, in the rainforest, standing on moist black dirt and looking up at sunlight piercing canopy. He said it smelled ‘exquisite’, a word that was out of character for him.

“You’re saying you were in the Amazon?” I said finally.

“No idea bro,” he said. “Amazon maybe. I don’t know.”

“Maybe Borneo?”

“I don’t know. The rainforest man. The deadass rainforest.”

“Alright,” I said.

By now he had taken off the other shoe and the pair was just sitting there in front of us on the rug.

Paul eyed me. Looked at the shoes.

“Yup,” he said. “You gotta.”

“The hell I do,” I countered.

“You gotta.”

He grimaced, reading my face, I guess.

“You wanna, Olly. You wanna, trust me.”

I did. I felt calm enough to know that I did. I had to try this. They’d fit my size 10 feet.

I bent down and grabbed one, slipped it on my socked foot. Grabbed the other, and held there, staring at Paul.

“What should I—you know,” I prompted.

“Fuck, right, dude. Listen. Just take the shoe off, it’s what I did, and pow, I’m back. Just take off the shoes.”

This was our exchange before I put the other shoe on, and the apartment was immediately gone. No cues, no noise or visual of transition. Just there, and now here. Where was I? It wasn’t a forest like Paul; it was a field. I felt the sun on my skin. Hills in the distance, and a highway? A semi-truck rumbling past. Buildings in the distance.

I bent down and tore off a shoe, and was suddenly back in the apartment facing a roommate whose body language bounced with intrigue.

“Dude!” he yelled. “You just vanished!”

“My God,” I said. “Jesus Christ.”

He was nodding with his whole head and neck, as if vibing. Wide-eyed, unblinking.

“Sick, right? The rainforest—”

“—not a forest,” I said. “More like a prairie, I guess? But there was a road, a big truck. Buildings too.”

“No shit. I’d’ve checked out those buildings,” he said a bit curtly.

“Yeah but I came back before I could really get my bearings. It was crazy.”

“Crazy,” he repeated. “Crazy.”

We both looked at the shoe I held.

So, this is the secret. Magical shoes that transported us. Not unheard of in fiction but I am telling you that this happened to us. Paul went to a forest. I went to a prairie. We found a pair of shoes in the trash and put them on and were teleported to these destinations instantaneously.

It didn’t stop there. It couldn’t. Would you have stopped? Paul went again. When he came back, he told me he was on a hill overlooking a valley and could see a whole city that he didn’t recognize. I went again and found myself on a grey sand beach with a cold wind. We went a few more times like this. Once, I found myself on a snowy mountain, and when I reappeared in our apartment Paul said I was cold to the touch. There was even snow in my hair. Then Paul went again, and the asshole was gone for five whole minutes. When he returned, I was surprised to see him cradling about 10 mangos.

“What the hell?” I said.

“A mango orchard man, a bleeping orchard fer real!”

“Are they ripe?”

We took a break from teleportation over slices of fresh mango. We discussed our experience and decided that the destinations were random. We knew it didn’t matter if we walked around, that we always returned to the apartment. We knew there were cities, so we knew there were people. It was clearly Earth so whatever magic this was, it was here. But when was it? Had either of us seen anything out of whack for 2025? No, we hadn’t. Still no people.

“Maybe we should stop,” I remember saying. “Give it a rest maybe.”

Neither of us wanted to do that. We had the whole day still.

We took turns teleporting, and we learned more. We started to figure that eventually we should land in cities. A few times we each landed within sight of populations, but since we had agreed to a one-minute limit after Paul’s five-minute disappearance, we couldn’t yet reach those places. Paul begrudged the rule. We also figured that if we hadn’t landed in towns or cities yet, it was only because most of the globe is still just wild land, farms, or water.

Bad timing, to jinx ourselves like that.

I pulled on the second shoe and at once lost my senses. Not that I couldn’t feel, because the shock of cold was devastating and I gasped. Not that I couldn’t taste because when I gasped, I lost my breath as my mouth filled with icy salt water. Not that I couldn’t see but it was black night and then plunging darkness. Not that I couldn’t hear but it was shrieking wind and then warbled frigid water in ghostly depths that seemed to tear me in different directions.

I struggled, panic filled. Reach. But swim, swim! I thought. Must breathe, I knew, but I could escape this. I reached, and just as my lungs began to inhale, my frozen knuckles locked their fingers around a shoe and tugged it off.

Suddenly I was in the apartment on all fours heaving and vomiting saltwater over our rug. Shivering miserably, drenched completely. I felt Paul hitting my back. My ears were ringing, adjusting to the sudden warmth.

Paul brought water. Patted my back.

“I was,” I said. My voice sounded like gravel. “I was in the ocean, I think.”

Paul just stared, nodded. He was amazed and still I sensed, jealous?

Later I sat in my robe wrapped in towels before a humming space heater. I told him about the storm, the night. We had already experienced nighttime in the couple hours we had been at this adventure. I told him about the crashing waves that I couldn’t escape.

“We have to be more careful,” I said.

That had been enough for one day.

We agreed the shoes would stay in the living room, that we would only use them together. We spent the rest of the evening talking about it. Unbelieving, but convinced. We planned. From now on we had an entry position. We’d sit in cannonball position, but one leg crossing the other. Both hands would grasp the second shoe as we put it on, so that we’d already be prepared to yank it off in case of trouble. We considered other things like wearing a wetsuit and flippers, goggles, even an oxygen tank, given how likely it should be that we’d land in an ocean somewhere. But ultimately, we decided to buy a large plastic sheet from Home Depot and lay it out on the living room floor to catch water, and to purchase a simple lifejacket that wouldn’t hinder movement when teleporting plopped us on dry land.

I barely slept that night. As frightening as they were, these shoes changed my life. I was jittery with excitement, suppressing fear.

We both called in sick next morning. Of course we did.

Then we got into Paul’s car and went on our errands. Only took an hour.

Back at the apartment, we laid our new plastic sheet where the rug had been. Rug was hung to dry out on the patio. The life jacket was a small sea kayaker’s jacket. Stylish and minimal. We had also bought a small knife, some beef jerky, a headlamp, a length of high-strength static line, and bug spray. The jacket had pockets for these things.

We also decided to pack my phone in the jacket. It had a better waterproof rating than Paul’s, and my international roaming plan was less ghastly expensive than his, if we ever landed somewhere with signal. We wanted to take photos and videos. But mostly it was to set the timer, as we’d agreed to increase the time to five minutes. Later we’d increase it to ten minutes.

We shared a large breakfast of hashbrowns, egg sausage sandwiches and dark coffee. Then the adventure began.

As the morning progressed, an area of our living room began to look like a naturopath’s collection. On each trip, we’d bring something back. A rock. A branch. A flower or bundle of grass. Dirt, or sometimes trash. It was shocking how rarely we landed close to people yet how often we found trash. It became clear that we were hitting places all over the world. Wrappers with Chinese lettering, a grocery bag with Tamil (the phone translation app said), French, other languages we’d yet to identify.

On one trip Paul was gone over five minutes. I began to worry. His phone rang and I picked it up. ‘Olly’, it read. I accepted.

“Paul?” I said, haltingly.

“Brooooo!” I heard him yell. It was a perfectly clear call.

“Paul!” I exclaimed. I stood and paced. “Paul where are you?”

“I’m not sure but I got bars bro! So, I’m callin’.”

“Any landmark? What’s the climate?”

“Pretty dry. I think I’m in a desert, but there are power lines I see. I guess a cell tower’s close so.”

My hand was in my hair, as if calming my mind.

“Clear skies,” he said.

“Maybe you’re stateside somewhere? Southwest? Take a photo, we can reverse image search back here again. Or wait just open the map app, I downloaded a ton of regions last night.”

“Hold on.”

I waited a few seconds.

“No dice, no internet just calling. GPS shows I’m nowhere,” he said.

“Damn.”

“Yeah. Hey, Olly?”

“What’s up?”

Just then he appeared almost exactly where I was pacing and I bumped into him, knocking us both to the plastic-covered ground. We laughed maniacally.

When we calmed, he showed me some photos he’d taken.

“GeoGuessr eat your heart out,” I said.

“Huh?”

“You know, that Google Maps street view game? It shows you a street view somewhere on the planet and you guess where it is by dropping a pin on a map. Whoever’s closest wins. I played with colleagues a few times.”

“That’s an idea,” said Paul.

We created a map, named it ‘Jumping Jimmies.’ Then we did a reverse image search on one of the pictures that Paul had taken with my phone. While it wasn’t conclusive it gave us some lookalikes.

“Could be that one. ‘Red Sand’, in Saudi.”

“Mmm,” I said. “But look at that rock, a bit too unique. You woulda seen that. This one? Devil’s Desert?”

“Not sandy enough.”

“Namibia? No.”

“Wait, that one!” Paul exclaimed. “What’s that?”

“Oh yeah that looks good. Says ‘Atacama, Chile’.”

“Yes! That’s it I’m sure of it! Mark it.”

We chose a series of icons that we labeled by the percentage of how sure we were of each location. \~90% on the Atacama Desert, green circle.

Elation welled up in my heart. I had always loved to travel and now I was traveling the world incognito. Paul and I were prepared, ready, and eager. We thought we anticipated everything. If only we’d kept our guard up…

 

By evening many colorful icons dotted our map. We had taken dozens of photos, one of Paul’s toothy smile beside a grinning shepherd on a mountain road somewhere in Kyrgyzstan, another of a group of people at a bus stop in a Colombian town (Paul envied how often I landed with people).

“Yeah, you always get the good places,” Paul said. “I just get trees and hills. Every single time.”

Puddles pooled on the plastic tarp in our living room from a handful of times we found ourselves swimming. Paul wanted to visit a city, but I wasn’t ready to increase our time limit enough to walk to one or to board a bus like in Colombia. We had to take it slowly, and I knew that if Paul would be patient we’d land in one.

But then it finally happened.

Tokyo is the largest city on Earth, with a population over 30 million. Fitting then that it was the first big city we happened upon, or that I happened upon. I had learned to reign in my expectations when slipping on the second shoe. In less than an instant I was teleported onto a narrow road, remarkably carless and calm, staring up at skyscrapers glinting in sunlight. I recognized Japanese on the shopfront, and English accompanying all the street signs. In fact, I’d been to Tokyo before, and so the sight was familiar. The sight of me, however, less so. At least to a curious couple ogling me. I realized a foreigner in the middle of a Tokyo street wearing a lifejacket packed with survival items and awkwardly sat hugging his knees and grabbing a shoe would look bizarre.

I scampered to my feet and out of the way of a stout little delivery van driving past. I smiled at the couple who continued walking. I retrieved my cell phone; 09 minutes 04 seconds left before I should remove a shoe.

Something immediately caught my attention—the sweet scent of tempura frying. I located its source: a small restaurant with ubiquitous noren fabric hanging to mark its entryway. I was in Tokyo. I loved Japanese food, loved it absolutely. Here I was! I had to, right? We couldn’t control where we landed, so who knows when I’d happen upon Japan, and Tokyo itself, again? I found my hands searching my chest as I realized I had no money. We should’ve been traveling with credit cards at least. But they pay with cash here mostly. Impractical to travel with every currency, though, and impractical to expect a currency exchange.

Then it dawned on me, to my shame and to my joy, that I could dine and dash without so much as a step to flee.

Parted the noren to enter. Konnichiwa, hello. I sat at the bar in the narrow locale, removing my lifejacket ashamedly and hanging it on a hook underneath. I ordered the tendon by pointing. The aroma, the delectable crispy vegetables and shrimp, beautifully crisp, and umami flavors.

As if waking from a dream I remembered Paul and quickly checked the time. I was already ten minutes overdue! With averted eyes and utter embarrassment and shame for what they’d think, I snatched my lifejacket and ducked under the bar. Removed a shoe.

“Son of a bitch!” yelled Paul. “Where the fuck were you? I was freaking out man. We said ten minutes!” He sniffed. “What’s that smell?”

I begged his forgiveness and placed my hands on his shoulders, urging him onto the couch. Calm, calm.

“It’s toasted sesame,” I said. “I was in Tokyo. I ate tempura.”

“Tempura? That fried stuff they serve with sushi?”

“Sure, yeah.”

“Did you say... Tokyo? A city? You ate in a city!?” he yelled, smiling.

“Damn right,” I said.

“Jumpin’ jimmies!” he yelled, and I repeated that refrain reflexively. “Mark it down! A city, you lucky bastard. Lowkey smells insane. You lucky, lucky asshole. And you didn’t bring any back.”

“Damn it!” I said. “I’m sorry Paul, I didn’t think about it. When I saw the time—”

“—Yeah. All good. Man, I want to land in a city.”

Paul’s eyes were on the lifejacket, but not really. They were distant, imaginative. I couldn’t tell if he was more happy or more envious -- long stares are tough to decipher.

“You’ll get there man, I promise. We’ll get you there.”

For a moment annoyance crossed his expression, but it didn’t linger long enough for comment.

“Yeah,” he said plainly.

We jumped a few more times and then Paul said he wanted to take a break. Envious, it turned out. He was sulking. Disappeared into his room without too many words between us. I figured he’d just have to let it settle, and we’d be back at it in the evening.

I fixed myself a sandwich and ate it while observing our disorderly living room. Souvenirs, laptops, wet plastic. Then I retired to my own room, surprised to feel tired. I think the jumps take it out of you.

I sank into willful sleep.

 

When next I woke it was dark outside. I’d slept the whole afternoon. Clock read 9 p.m.

Out in the living room everything looked the same. Paul’s door was shut. My mouth felt dry and so I poured a glass of water and leaned on the counter, marveling at our mess again.

Then I saw.

The shoes were gone.

I set the glass down, and skipped to Paul’s door, knocked.

“Paul? You awake?” I opened it. “Paul?” Not there.

As I rushed back into the living room and started upending cushions in search of the shoes, it was like watching an actor in a movie you’ve already seen. I knew he’d taken them. I knew he jumped.

The lifejacket was on the floor. I retrieved my phone from a pouch. “Idiot,” I thought. “You left it.”

No missed calls, no texts. I called Paul’s phone and heard it ringing in his room. “Idiot,” I said to myself more sharply.

How long had he been gone? I looked for any new artifacts, any notes or new pins on our Google map. Nothing. I checked the tarp, which was mostly dry now. His car was still parked outside. I opened our front door and stuck my head out. Hallway was clear.

“This sonofabitch straight up donned the shoes and peaced,” I said aloud.

In anger I sounded more like Paul than myself. Oppressive silence seemed to coalesce. It was a bit more humid than normal—all the extra salt water. Suddenly our pile of artifacts and souvenirs seemed nasty, so I grabbed a garbage bag and shoved everything in, tied it off. I was helpless.

Hours went by. It was 3 a.m. by the time I felt tired again. My eyes stung. I drank some water and retreated to my bed where I finally let myself pass out.

 

Beep-beep-beep.

Groggy and petrified I calmed myself when I realized I was just waking up. The garbage truck upturned the dumpster, its metal arms clanging as it guzzled trash and then replaced the container, drove off. I fell out of bed. 7 a.m.

Out in the living room the scene was unchanged. No Paul. He had been gone for so many hours.

I cooked runny oatmeal, added raisins and slurped it. Could he have drowned? Didn’t take the lifejacket, the buffoon. Real possibility. Maybe he landed in Vegas and would pop back home to regale me with some story worthy of The Hangover. Wild animal could’ve attacked him, but I struggled to imagine he wouldn’t have the time to remove a shoe. Maybe he’s just on a hike. I knew I shouldn’t have eaten that tempura. I like Paul but I knew he was quick to jealousy. Why didn’t I smooth things over? It would’ve taken five minutes max. Paul’s ego wanted, needed to be coaxed. Two days and already we’re at each other’s throats? No that can’t be it. A misunderstanding maybe. He’s just off to prove a point. Don’t fuck with the rules, Olly, he’ll tell me. Tell yourself, man. Leaving precautions behind, no phone even. God damn it.

I was chewing on a raisin, the wet oatmeal juice resting in my mouth awaiting to be swallowed. I was staring at the plastic sheet on our living room floor. One moment that’s all I was doing; the next I was staring at a body.

Face-down. Shirtless. Holes in his back, blood pooling, some dripping down the torso. White shorts, pockets outturned, stained. One white shoe, stained. The other foot bare and dirty. Thick fingers, bent and broken on one hand. The way jumping works, it makes it seem that this body had been there for as long as I had been looking at that spot, that I’d been staring at it while I slurped cooling oatmeal. That I should feel guilty for only plunging into nightmare after the body appeared and not before.

Paul. Paul’s body. His hair, his broken hands. The smell. My mind recalled images of hospitals and gowns with geometric prints, hands scrubbing harsh brown bars of soap with foam that smelled medicinal and metallic and burnt. The smell of memory competed with the smell of death, one trying to sanitize the other because it cannot be. It can’t. He can’t be dead.

Oatmeal dribbled down my chin before I could close my mouth. It suddenly tasted like raw meat, and I spat into the sink. I became aware of my pounding heart playing catch-up. All my senses were delayed, as if reality could not so abruptly be changed, so noiselessly debased to this horror.

Each sniff triggered a gag. Each blink felt eternal. Give it enough time to just erase this. Blink it out of existence, I know it can be done. Please, please, please.

I write this anonymously. My name’s not Olly and his is not Paul. But I need help. There is a body, shot to death, laying on a plastic tarp in my living room. There’s only one shoe the other is gone. No one will believe me. What do I do?",1,1756781291.0,velabasstuff,0,1.0,False

I've been making coffee as espresso, drip filter and plunger for many years now and decided to give an aeropress a whirl ... however I am not sure if I'm doing something wrong or if I have a bum unit.

The unit is leaking grounds badly \*before\* I even press and I noticed that the filter paper is not being gripped at all by the ""filter cap"". When I look at the base of the tube it seems that there is a fine (perhaps 1mm) raised edge which I assume is to bite down onto the filter paper (but I don't know) ... however not only is not not biting down onto the filter at all, I see that there are strange marks in 'edge'

[deformations on the edge of the tube](https://preview.redd.it/oyhq4hwzynmf1.png?width=1600&format=png&auto=webp&s=fe9fa3fea46443358a8604c10da3e9b0deef6a8b)

these look like they were done when the plastic was being formed and are not damage when the plastic was properly set.

Also, the inside of the Filter Cap is not particularly flat ...

So do I send this unit back, or am I doing something wrong?

1n6861b,https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/1n6861b/the_full_story_of_my_paranoia/,The Full Story of My Paranoia,"This is a bit of a long story but that’s the thing about going crazy - it doesn’t happen all at once. It’s a slow boil until the pot rattles itself off the stove. I’m putting every detail here because the details are what made people roll their eyes. The details are what made me doubt myself. And the details are what eventually pushed me to start acting like a stalker, just to prove I had one.

I live alone in a one-bedroom on the sixth floor of a narrow, brick-and-glass building that pretends it’s “boutique” by way of a chalkboard in the lobby that says WELCOME HOME in cursive. My view is the back alley: a sliver of sky, a row of dumpsters, and the backs of cafes where staff stand in the doorways blowing steam off their hands in winter. In summer there’s the smell of hot metal and overripe fruit from the produce store. The alley hums differently every season. I know that now: what the humming should sound like when no one else is there.

I keep odd hours because I do copyediting and manuscript formatting for a small press that thinks deadlines mean “last minute or not at all,” so I send a lot of emails at 2 a.m. and nap in chopped-up blocks. Nights aren’t scary when you live at your own pace. Nights make sense. Nights are consistent.

In June, nights stopped being consistent.

It was small at first: my front door latch. If I let the door swing shut, it doesn’t click unless I turn the knob and push it into the frame. For the first two years, I learned the muscle memory. Then, suddenly, I’d come home from the elevator and the door would be even with the jamb, silent. 

You think you forgot. You make a note. I started a list in the Notes app called “Am I losing it?”. It was half a joke. I wrote:

1. 06/12: door shut quiet??
2. 06/13: coffee mug moved? (I leave it slightly skewed on the drying mat; it was parallel to the edge.)
3. 06/15: faint cigarette smell in hallway at 11 p.m. (No one on my floor smokes; I know because the property manager wasted an entire tenants’ meeting threatening to fine people.)
4. 06/17: coin on the bookshelf slid? (I keep a toonie on the corner of a shelf like a paperweight; it helps me remember where I set down the envelope with rent receipts. Don’t ask me why the coin matters. It mattered to me.)

I told myself I was making content out of nothing. I told myself my brain likes patterns, and anxiety will feed it. Kara (best friend) told me the same thing over wine: “You work alone. Your sense of time is fuzzy. It’s an off week. Leave your apartment messy on purpose. See if anything actually changes.”

So I started leaving “tells.” A hair taped across my bathroom drawer. A thread balanced on my bookshelf coin. A Q-tip wedged between my sliding balcony door and the rail. Not paranoid. Just curious. Like a kid setting flour on the floor and waiting for Santa’s boot prints.

On 06/21, the hair across the drawer was cut cleanly in the middle, both ends still trapped under the tape. A pair of cuticle scissors were laying by my soap dispenser.

I stared at it for a long time. The scissors were mine. I hadn’t used them. I called Kara. She said I’d probably snagged it myself and didn’t remember. She said, “Hey, we used to tape hair across our dorm mini-fridge, and it always fell off because of humidity.” She said, “You’re scaring yourself.”

I bought a doorbell camera. My camera lasted one night before a stern-looking security guard knocked and asked me to remove it. Dark hair, dark eyes, early thirties, knuckles like he’d worked with his hands before sitting in a lobby. He introduced himself as Aiden and said the rule wasn’t his; he just had to enforce it. “If you want to point something inside, go for it,” he added, lowering his voice like he was doing me a favor. “Just not into the hall.”

The management company sent a mass email within 24 hours of that night reminding tenants that cameras were not allowed on the hallway side of unit doors. For privacy reasons, they claimed.

So I did what Aiden said and set the camera inside, angled at the door. That was the night the camera battery died at 3:12 a.m., despite showing 86% at midnight. I woke to the colorless smear of dawn and a low battery chime. No footage. The door was shut quietly.

I started sleeping with the TV on. Not because I thought the sound would deter anyone but because the static blue wash on the wall would wake me if a shadow moved. The truth is I started sleeping like prey: shallow, with a rope of dread twisted under my ribs. You can’t live that way and be a person during the day. During the day you forget your own passwords and leave a burner on. During the day you pour milk into the sink and realize you were aiming for your coffee.

On 06/26, I found a folded paper napkin under my doormat when I came in from a run. It was the cheap brown kind from the café downstairs. Inside someone had printed, in narrow, careful block letters:

YOU FORGOT THE GREEN ONIONS AGAIN

It was true. I'd spent the last few days reminding myself that I needed to stop at the grocery store and pick some up. My brain told me to not make this about me. It’s a joke. Someone teasing their roommate. Not for me. But it also reminded me that it was my doormat the note had been left under.

I took a picture and added it to my list before taking a shower. I made a quick run after lunch to pick up some groceries and tried to put it again out of my mind.

The next morning there was a note inside my apartment. A yellow sticky note on my kitchen counter I swear I hadn’t put there. Same handwriting. Block letters that tried to look friendly by putting hearts in the middle of the O’s, which did the opposite.

ONION GREEN IS NOT GREEN ONION

I called the non-emergency line. The operator’s voice was soft with fatigue. “Has there been a break-in?”

I told her the latch thing. The hair. The napkin. The sticky note.

“Ma’am, we can send a patrol to check the building, but unless there’s damage or an intruder, there’s not much we can do. Have you notified your property manager?”

“Yes.”

“And?”

“And he said, ‘Make sure you’re locking the door.’”

A patrol came, took one look around, and told me to get a better lock. The locks are drilled into a steel frame set by the building. The super isn’t authorized to change the hardware. The company has a master key. “It’s a security issue if every tenant has their own,” the super explained, eyes sliding off mine. His name is Gerard but everyone calls him Gerry. He’s the kind of man who calls women “kiddo” past fifty and thinks it’s charming but he seemed harmless to me.

The sticky notes multiplied. They were never threatening, not in a way that would trigger anyone else’s alarm but mine. They were corrections. They were comments. They were edits.

YOUR SPLATS OF OLIVE OIL ON THE STOVE ARE GREASY; RUN THE HEAT A LITTLE LOWER.

A FEW MORE MINUTES AND YOUR COFFEE WON’T BE SOUR.

YOUR SHOES WILL LAST LONGER IF YOU DON’T KICK THEM OFF BY THE HEEL.

And once: YOU LOOK GOOD IN RED. GO BACK FOR THE SWEATER. 

I had tried on a sweater at a consignment shop on Dundas and put it back because I’m not actually a red person.

I started scanning faces everywhere: in line at the café, on the streetcar, in the reflection of the subway window. The security guard from the camera day, Aiden, smiled when I came in and asked if everything was okay. He had the practiced gentleness of people who get yelled at professionally. 

I said I thought someone might have a copy of my key. “You’d be surprised how often that happens,” he said. “Contractors, old supers, roommates… You can get your own deadbolt installed high up. They usually allow that.” He glanced up, measuring my height. “You might need a stool to reach it though.”

I’m five-two on a good day. I laughed, too quickly. “I’m not paranoid,” I told him. “It’s probably nothing.”

“Probably,” he said. “But paranoia is just a safety feature. Like a seatbelt. It’s dumb right up until it’s not.”

Every story has a moment where you could pull the fuse out before the fire gets to it. Here’s mine: I started following people.

Not like a pro. Not like the movies. I’d see a man whose hair was the same almost-black as Aiden’s but with a different jawline and I’d keep going after my coffee and then, without making a choice, I’d turn when he turned. If his bag had a frayed strap, I’d fixate on it and decide the fray was a clue. If he held the door for a woman and looked after her a beat too long, I’d decide that beat was intent. If he got off at my stop and stayed for three blocks in front of me, I’d slow down so he could pass me, then I’d fall in. I took pictures of shoes, backpacks, the backs of heads. I put them in a folder called “Crowns” because, from behind, people are mostly scalp and the idea made it less creepy.

On 07/3, I saw my handwriting on a sticky note in the corner of my bathroom mirror. It looked like a mirror’s version of me: familiar and wrong. It said:

ANYONE WOULD THINK YOU’RE CRYING IN HERE.

The handwriting wasn’t mine. It was pretending to be. The O’s had those tiny hearts, like a tell. It’s grotesque what your brain does with a detail like that. For the rest of the night, every O I typed looked like an opened mouth.

Kara came over and did a full sweep like we were in a procedural drama. She checked the air vents. She looked for pinholes in the walls. “You’re giving someone the show they want,” she said finally, trying to sound gentle and landing somewhere resentful. “If there’s anyone at all. You’ve lost weight, Soph.”

“I’m eating,” I said. (I wasn’t. I was gnawing. There’s a difference.)

“You’re sleeping?”

“Yes,” I lied.

She looked at my couch. The pillow had a sweat shadow in the shape of a skull.

“Let me stay.”

“I don’t want you to think I’m crazy,” I blurted, and then laughed, and then cried in the bathroom with the faucet running so Kara wouldn’t hear the shape of it.

The next night we set the trap like we were twelve: a glass of water balanced precariously atop the door, hair across the drawer, tape on the deadbolt, salt sprinkled on the kitchen floor to dust for footprints like detectives who couldn’t be bothered to buy powder. We huddled in my room with the lights off, whispering until whispering turned into jerky laughter.

At 2:44 a.m., the front door clicked. A careful click. Not the crash of our paranoia rewarded. Just a careful click, like thirty other nights. The water didn’t fall. The deadbolt tape was intact. The salt looked smooth.

At 2:48 a.m., the bathroom fan turned on by itself. It’s motion-sensing. Sometimes it’s finicky. Kara whispered, “Maybe your pipes are haunted.”

We lay there and watched the ceiling. Every distant door slam in the building. Every elevator shudder. Every dawn bird that mistook the city’s light for the sun and started early. Kara fell asleep snoring lightly at 3:10. I lay awake until 5 before exhaustion took me to sleep.

The sticky note the next morning said:

LOVE THE SLEEPOVER. BRINGS ME BACK.

I took it to the building office. Gerry said, “Kids have too much access to prank supplies. We never had this problem with real tape.”

“I want the locks changed.”

“We can do that when there’s a turnover.”

“I want them changed now.”

“We don’t authorize one-off changes,” he said. “And anyway, if someone’s being a creep, changing the lock won’t stop notes under the door.”

“It was on my counter.”

He shrugged. He looked forty-seven and bored in unpressable pants. “Maybe your friend thought it was funny.”

The thing about losing your mind is that the world starts treating you like you already did. That’s the practical harm. The existential harm is that you start treating yourself the same way. You start leaving yourself little bribes: If I’m good for a whole hour, I can look through the peephole. If I finish this chapter, I can check the deadbolt tape. You bargain with your fear like it’s a toddler.

On 07/8, I followed a man into the grocery store on College because his shoes looked familiar. (Dark sneakers, white soles, a notch in the leather near the right big toe.) I pretended to examine green onions. He stood close enough to reach past me for cilantro. I could smell his gum, mint sharp, almost medicinal. He wasn’t looking at me. He was looking at the price. That’s not a thing I ever noticed before this: how hard some men look at prices. He took his cilantro and went. I watched the shape of his shoulders under his jacket and thought of photographs where something terrible has already happened but all anyone can see is light.

He turned right on Beatrice. I turned right on Beatrice. He cut across to the next block, and I followed from the other side of the street. Then he stopped at a laundromat and bent to tie his shoe. He wasn’t looking at me. I could have walked past. Instead, I stopped too, ten paces back, and pretended to check my phone. He looked up. We made eye contact that felt like a knife in the air between us. He frowned. He said, politely but confused, “Can I help you?” and I said, “Sorry,” and fled.

I went home and triple-checked the balcony Q-tip. It was missing. The door was still latched from the inside.

That same day, a maintenance notice went up in the lobby: Annual fire alarm inspection, 07/12-07/14. Entry to units between 9 a.m. and 5 p.m. with notice. I circled the date on my paper calendar. I told myself this was normal, necessary. I told myself this was good, people with clipboards who aren’t allowed to be creepy. I told myself a hundred things. It was like trying to nail fog to the wall.

On 07/12, a man with a plastic visitor’s badge and a can of air stepped into my apartment for “15-20 minutes, tops,” to test the ceiling sensors. He had forearms like he lifted actual ladders, not the lightweight aluminum ones the company uses. He kept his baseball cap on, low. He said he needed to check the smoke detector in the bedroom too. When I said I’d follow him, he shrugged like, “Sure, whatever.” He took the smoke detector off its base with a twist and checked something I couldn’t see. Then he put it back with a harder twist, like a lid. He smelled like spearmint gum and faint cigarette smoke. 

When he left, I took the detector down myself. I stood on the stool Aiden had teased me about needing and reached up with both hands and tried to curry the plastic loose with my fingernail. I took the whole round plate off. There was nothing but the white belly of a standard unit and a printed date of manufacture. I felt stupid and paranoid. I wanted to cry. I put it back and it didn’t quite click. I had to wiggle it until it sat flush again. For the rest of the afternoon it blinked red every forty seconds like a little heart too slow to save anyone.

That night the sticky note said:

YOU’RE RIGHT. RED ISN’T YOU.

I don’t have space here for every small way I came apart. It wasn’t dramatic. It was a fine thread unspooling over two weeks while the world went on being its crisp self: buses huffed and sighed; pigeons bickered; a kid on my floor wore a dinosaur jacket with felt spikes and refused to go anywhere unless he could press his own elevator button. I kept working. I kept showering. (Sometimes I could feel the exact place an unfamiliar eye would stand if it could watch me: in the doorway, slightly to the right, where you can see the mirror without being in it.) I kept grocery shopping badly, as demonstrated by the notes. I kept checking my tape on the deadbolt and finding it torn, and I kept telling myself it must be my own hands. I kept sleeping with the TV on but woke anyway, bone-stiff from shivering in fights I mostly lost.

On 07/16, I snapped. I mean that in the most boring sense: something inside me just didn’t stretch anymore. I told my boss I needed a week. I packed a bag without my toothbrush because I had an irrational thought about someone touching the bristles. I booked a $102 room in a budget hotel near the Gardiner because I figured if you’re going to be watched, be watched where there are security cameras every ten feet and men in suits practicing their neutral faces for meetings.

I told no one where I was going. Not Kara. Not my parents. Not the “Please text when you get home” group chat comprised of three people who all live in different time zones and therefore know how to say “love you” without punctuation. I felt guilty about that. Then I felt guilty about feeling guilty. Then I drank two tiny hotel vodkas and fell asleep in sheets that smelled like industrial citrus.

At 2:03 a.m., my phone buzzed.

UNKNOWN: If you're going to hide, you should book a place with better curtains.

I lay there with the phone lighting the bottom half of my face and actually argued with myself about whether to turn on the bedside lamp. Turning it on would make me a silhouette. Not turning it on made me a target for whatever was already in the dark. People always say that in stories. It sounds ridiculous. But it’s true in your body: the dark is a physical thing sitting on your chest.

I texted back before I could stop myself: Who is this?

The three dots came up immediately. Then:

UNKNOWN: You don't lock your balcony door. Not well.

I was on the 12th floor. The balcony was a pane of glass facing the highway and the cold. I stood up from the bed and felt my knees go wrong. I pulled on my coat and my shoes while texting 911 with shaky thumbs. I was on the phone with a calm woman who kept me repeating the hotel name when someone knocked, quick and polite. The fire alarm on the ceiling tinked once, like a spoon against a glass.

“Ma’am? Security.” A man’s voice through the door. Different from Aiden’s timbre but same flat politeness. “Everything okay?”

“Ma’am?” A pause. Longer. Softer. “Sophia?”

I opened the door.

Despite everything screaming at me to not open the door, I opened the door because he knew my name and said it like we were in a conversation already. The man in the hall wore the hotel jacket and a lanyard and had that same nothing face men wear when they expect to be bumped by a rolling suitcase. He took in the room behind me and then looked past me to the sliding glass balcony door and said, “You want to close that.”

The balcony door was open a hand’s width. The winter air made a little ribbon of itself on the carpet.

He stepped in like he owned the space, and for a second, relief won. He shut the door hard enough to make the glass bounce in its track. He pulled the drapes shut. “Someone’s been on the balcony above,” he said. “There was snow kicked down. It hits the alarm sensors sometimes.” He shrugged. “Kids. Sorry you were disturbed.”

“Someone texted me.”

“Could be a prank.” He looked at my phone, my fingers clenched around it like a handle. “We can move you to another room.”

He led me down the hall to a new door and opened it with a clean beep of his master key. He glanced at the bed, the window, the neat hotel painting. He stood there like he was waiting for something, and then he said, “Take care of yourself, Sophia.”

He left. I sat on the edge of the new bed, shivering in a way that felt like each muscle was getting its own small bad news. I looked back at the text.

UNKNOWN: You're sweet when you panic.

There is a point past which you can’t be soothed anymore by rational explanations. It took me too long to get there. When I did, I packed my bag again, checked out, and rode in a rideshare with a driver who wanted to tell me about his cousin’s restaurant across town while I tried not to cry. I went back to my apartment at 4 a.m. because I wanted everything familiar.  Even the lousy parts. I wanted the alley’s hum. I wanted the elevator’s judder. I wanted to know my fear by its first name.

The deadbolt tape was torn.

The sticky note on my counter said:

HOTEL SOAP MAKES YOU ITCH. NEW LIP BALM THO. YES.

I walked into my bathroom and looked at my face. There was a red ring around my mouth where I’d been licking, nervous, then smoothing balm over the sore spots. I sat on the closed toilet and shook like I had the flu. When I could stand again, I pulled the smoke detector down. I held it in my lap like a baby while I pried at the seam with a butter knife. The plastic creaked. On the third try, it gave. The back plate came away in my hand.

There was a microSD card taped inside the dome with surgical tape.

It wasn’t a camera. But its presence was a gunshot in a winter field. It made all the birds rise at once. I set the detector down and stepped backward like it could explode.

Then I laughed. I laughed like a lunatic because I understood the trick: If I took the card out and went to anyone, Gerry, Kara, the police, what would I be showing them? A card I found in my own apartment in a place I could have put it. If there was anything recorded on it, the only thing it would prove is that my bedroom existed.

I sat on the floor and texted Kara: Please come over. It’s bad. I didn’t hit send. I stared at the three words “Please come over” and thought about how many times in my life I’d needed someone and made it sound like nothing. I deleted the text. I mean, he had my number. He had…I don’t know. Whatever he had.

At dawn, I went downstairs to the lobby.

Aiden was behind the desk. He looked up with his gentleness and then really looked. He came around the desk with his palms up like you do for a frightened animal. “Hey. You okay?”

I put the smoke detector in his hands.

He took it with care. He looked at the card and then he looked at me the way people do when they’re trying to put their face far away from their eyes. “Who else has the master keys?” I asked.

“Me. Gerry. The property manager. Cleaning contractors for move-outs. The fire inspection team for the week. I’ll go check the camera logs.”

“There aren’t cameras on my hall,” I said. “Remember? Privacy.” It came out mean. I didn’t mean it for him.

“In the lobby,” he said. “Stairwells. Elevator.”

He went behind the desk and scrolled. He took down timestamps like he was trying to keep them from evaporating. He said, “If you’ve been feeling weird at night, there’s a guy who keeps letting himself in from the alley exit. That door is supposed to lock. I’ll have Gerry fix it.”

“Who?”

“Hoodie. Ball cap. Looks down. After midnight, mostly.” He glanced at me. “It could be nothing. Food deliveries.”

“Food deliveries don’t go up in the elevator without calling.”

“Some do.” He hesitated. “Can I ask you a question?”

“What?”

“Have you dated anyone in the building?”

“What? No.”

“Anyone who-” he faltered “-had reason to make you want to feel watched.”

I thought about the embarrassing “Crowns” folder on my phone. I thought about the man at the laundromat, the way he’d looked at me like I was the problem, because I had been. I thought about my brain clutching a shoe notch like a relic.

“No,” I said. “I don’t stalk people.” It sounded weak to my own ears.

“I didn’t say that,” Aiden said.

“What do I do?”

“Move out,” he said, too quickly, like he regretted it immediately. Then, because that wasn’t helpful: “We’ll check the stairwells and the roof. I’ll walk you to your unit. Change your routines. Don’t go home at the same time. Don’t leave the balcony door unlatched.”

“I don’t.”

He didn’t argue.

That night I slept under the opera of my own pulse. At 1:12 a.m., the elevator thrummed through the wall. At 1:14, the motion-sensing bathroom fan clicked on, and I lay there staring at the ceiling, counting the red blink of the smoke detector like the metronome of a slow heart.

At 1:17, my phone buzzed.

UNKNOWN: You broke my eye. I forgave you. That’s love.

I turned on every light. I stood in the kitchen breathing with my palms flat on the counter until my fingers ached. I didn’t text back. I didn’t call the police. I put my phone into the refrigerator to shut it up. Not a permanent solution, but enough so I could hear anything else besides it. I took the butter knife and slid it into my sleeve. 

I opened my front door without letting the latch click, and then I shut it loudly, hard enough to make a show of it. I locked the deadbolt. I slid the chain. I went to the bedroom and shut that door quietly like I was tucking in a child. Then I got into the closet. I know: why not leave? Because I wanted to see his face. Because I wanted to know if the horror had a shape.

I sat in the closet behind winter jackets that smelled like last year’s snow and waited. At 1:39, the elevator hummed. At 1:42, my front door made a sound that was almost nothing, the tiniest accommodation of wood to metal. At 1:43, someone breathed.

I’ve thought about describing it better. About how a stranger’s breath in your home is a sound like a stray animal in a church but breath is breath. It’s proof that something else is living in the place where you are living. It was close enough to hear. It was near the bedroom doorway. It came with the smell of spearmint gum and cold air.

The tiny red light at the corner of my closet ceiling, the one I had stopped being able to see because it blinked so slowly, went dark, then bright: the smoke detector cycling. There was a snap of fingernails flicking the plastic. A weight settled on the edge of my bed: the crease of the mattress, the tiny sound of fabric protesting. A rustle near the duvet, a hand (I think) feeling the warm shape I’d left there with pillows under the covers like a bad movie. A sound that might have been a chuckle and might have been a breath caught on a stitch of cloth.

I waited until my legs shook uncontrollably. I waited until he got up. I waited until the weight of the bed released and the air in the room changed. He moved around like someone in a home he had learned by touch: a soft bump of knee to coffee table; the little finger taps on the doorframe as he passed. He paused in the hallway. The spearmint smell came closer. He put his face toward the closet, I think. The coats wavered around me and fell back like a sea. He scraped his thumb slowly across the closet door’s seam. Then he moved away.

The deadbolt slid with a sound like metal softly kissing itself. The door closed with that careful hush I knew so well. The chain was left dangling, a touch less straight than before.

I didn’t move for ten minutes. The closet turned into a world. When I opened the door, the apartment looked like a set after a scene: bed unruffled, kitchen red digital clock telling a lie about time. The sticky note on the counter said:

YOU’RE GETTING BRAVER.

That was the first time the police took me seriously. Not because of the note. Because of the audio. The old phone I’d shoved between two cookbooks on the shelf had picked up the deadbolt, the chain, the footfalls, the faint scritch of a thumb on wood, the whisper that sounded like, “Good girl,” or maybe, “Don’t curl,” like a sports coach telling someone to keep their form. (Tell me which is worse.)

An officer named Blevins came, looked at the microSD card, and shrugged, but when he heard the audio and saw the torn deadbolt tape and the chain slack, he stopped shrugging. “He knows the building,” he said. “He’s comfortable in here. He wants you to know he’s comfortable. He wants you to feel proud when he approves of you. That’s…that’s a thing.”

They dusted for prints. They found mine, Kara’s, and someone else’s partials on the bathroom door and the inside of the front door near the chain. They sent me to sleep at Kara’s place while they “secured the scene,” which turned out to mean “took pictures, added tape of their own, and told the property manager about liability.”

When I came back the next afternoon with two officers, the sticky note was gone.

“That’s a taunt,” Blevins said, looking at the clean counter like it was an insult. “He wanted to show he could be in here when he wanted. He wanted to show us that evidence is optional when you have a key.”

They asked for footage. The building had lobby video that showed Gerry propping the alley door open at 12:50 a.m. and bringing in two flats of canned paint. It showed Aiden arriving at 10:58 p.m. It showed the fire inspection company bringing ladders and cases during the day. It showed a man in a dark hoodie riding the elevator at 1:39 a.m. with his head down. He didn’t look up at the camera. He tapped a key fob and the light blinked.

“Who is that?” Blevins asked.

Gerry looked uncomfortable. “Could be a contractor.”

“At 1:39 in the morning?”

“Sometimes we do off-hours work.”

“Who has that fob?”

Gerry scrolled and scrolled. The list of fob assignments was a spreadsheet on a dusty office computer. “Master,” he said. “Master, master, master.” He widened the columns. “Looks like one of the master fobs wasn’t checked back in after the last fire inspection day.”

Aiden said, very quietly, “It wasn’t me.”

“We’re not saying that,” Blevins said.

Aiden folded his arms across his chest and stared through the glass like the alley could give him an answer if he just focused hard enough.

“Do you recognize the shoes?” I asked, before my brain could stop me from asking the dumbest question in the room. 

Gerry said, “Shoes are shoes.”

Aiden looked at me and then looked at the screen. “He drags his right foot a little. You hear it?” He rewound. The sound was faint, but it was there: the smallest, irregular scrape on every other step. “That’s not a contractor. Contractors wear steel toes and walk like they have a schedule.”

“Who walks like that?” Blevins asked.

“Guys who don’t want to be noticed,” Aiden said. He hesitated. “Kids who used to shoplift. Guys who’ve done time.”

“You sure do have opinions,” Gerry said, fake-light. “Want to do my job too, buddy?”

“I’m doing it,” Aiden said.

That night I went to Kara’s anyway. The apartment felt like a mouth with a tongue in it that wasn’t mine. Kara made pasta and slid me a bowl and we watched garbage on TV. We laughed at a thing that wasn’t funny. We locked her door with both deadbolts and put a chair under the handle like we were seventy and living somewhere our bones were the only locks that mattered. I slept. I dreamed about shoes scuffing dust the color of ash.

At 3:07 a.m., my phone buzzed.

UNKNOWN: Isn’t it cozy to have a friend? You breathe quieter when you share.

Kara’s bedroom door was closed. I listened. I heard her, even in sleep, the little whistle she’s had since we were nineteen. I typed back before I could talk myself out of it: What do you want.

He answered:

UNKNOWN: To be let in.

I didn’t sleep again. We ate pancakes at dawn at a place where the tables are always sticky and the syrup bottle caps are welded with sugar. I took a nap at noon. When I woke up, there was a voicemail from Blevins. They had a name.

The man with the hoodie and the master fob was one of the fire inspection contractors. Not the one who’d come into my unit (that guy had a signed form with my signature and a time stamp that matched my memory). Another guy. A man named Colin with a record for trespassing and a sealed juvenile file that used to be an open joke in his family: “You know how teenagers are.”

They found him two days later because he went back to the building at 1:14 a.m. like terror had a calendar. Aiden saw him on the camera and didn’t wait. He went up the stairs to the sixth floor instead of taking the elevator, because you can hear a person coming on stairs. He met Colin at the top landing and didn’t do something heroic; he just said, “Hey, man,” in a voice that made my throat close when I heard it on the audio later. He talked like talking was a rope he could throw.

“What?” Colin asked, like he’d been woken from a nap.

“Walk with me,” Aiden said. “Let’s get some air.”

They walked down together because Aiden knows the building’s bone-familiar sounds: the difference between elevator hum and the click a decade-old fire door makes when it hasn’t been oiled enough; the rackety laughter from the unit with the three guys who live like season 2 of a TV show where nobody learns lessons; the hiss of the boiler; the thin, sharp cry of the new baby in 2B. They walked through the lobby under the chalkboard that said WELCOME HOME in cursive. They walked out into the alley where the dumpsters wear graffiti like tattoos. Then they turned left instead of right, which is important, because left is where the alley widens into a crook of shadow behind the café, and the security camera above the door has a blind spot there.

Aiden said, “Give me the fob.”

Colin said, “You’re not a cop.”

Aiden said, “No. I’m a witness.”

There’s a kind of silence in police audio that isn’t really silence. It has a shape. It makes its own weather. Then there was the sound of a scuffle: a squeal of rubber on grit, a curse. Then Aiden huffed, “Don’t,” and someone else said, soft, “Okay,” like he didn’t mean it.

When Blevins walked me through it later he kept his voice flat, like telling me a recipe. I think he was being kind. Aiden is okay. He has a line of purple on his forearm and a new dent in his watch. Colin had a flashlight in his pocket that wasn’t just a flashlight. It had a camera lens embedded where the bulb should be. The police found a small hard case in the trunk of his car with eight microSD cards neatly labeled with dates and unit numbers, and a folded paper napkin that smelled like coffee and the alley.

Some of the footage was mine.

He’d breathed in my hallway. He’d sat on my bed and watched the red light blink and blink and blink. He’d filmed himself writing notes on my counter with my pen, his hand careful and neat, and each O like a mouth open halfway in surprise.

He had other footage too. The old woman on 3A who takes naps in the afternoon with the TV volume high. The couple on 7D who fight and then have quiet, exhausted sex, a rhythm like rowing. The kid in 5C who leaves his coins lined up on his desk and cries when they fall. He had captured the everyday exhale of the building. He had captured me in the shower with the mirror fogged but not fogged enough, and I watched ten seconds of that before I leaned forward and threw up in a police station trash can, which is as undignified as it sounds.

They arrested him. There will be charges. There will be a trial, I’m told. There will be words like “pattern,” “prior,” “intent,” and “escalation.”

There will be a paper that says “order of protection” and “no contact” and a date. There will be a morning I wake up and a door will click again, and I will not know if the sound is my memory or a new breath. That’s not drama. That’s statistics. A man like that does not start and stop in neat lines because a pair of handcuffs drew a box around him. He slows, maybe. He redirects. He learns to look up at cameras.

People have been very kind since it made the rounds in the building. They bring me muffins. They say, “I never would have guessed; he looked normal,” and I say, “Everybody looks normal under fluorescent lights.” Kara cried and apologized like she’d been the one who taught him how to tape a card inside a detector. 

Aiden bought me a red sweater and left it at the desk with a sticky note that said, “You can pull it off.” I laughed so hard I startled a man waiting for a courier. I laughed because the O’s on his note were round and empty, just O’s, and because the sweater is a color I would never choose.

The building replaced every lock. They moved me to a unit on the other side of the floor so my windows look over the street, not the alley. I keep my curtains open at night and watch the lights slide across the ceiling as cars pass. It feels like the city is washing over me on a loop. It feels like breathing alongside something big.

Here is the part of the story I don’t know what to do with: even after the arrest, even after the evidence, there’s a part of me that thinks about the men I followed for blocks and the way their shoulders set when they felt me behind them. There’s a part of me that remembers how that felt, the heat of being the eye instead of the animal, and is ashamed. There’s a part of me that can’t stop wondering what attention looks like to someone like him when the thing you want most is a door opening softly.

“You can live in the world again,” Blevins told me when he dropped me off. “People don’t have to be the shape of your fear.”

I’m trying. I put plants on my window ledge and bite the dead leaves off with my fingers and feel proud. I cook ridiculous, messy things and leave oil splats on the stove and don’t wipe them off right away. I let my shoes get scuffed. I bought green onions and ate them raw over eggs. I close the door and let it click however it wants.

Sometimes I wake up at 1:43 a.m. and go stand in the hallway and listen to the building breathe. Sometimes the bathroom fan clicks on by itself and I laugh. Sometimes I put a sticky note on my own counter that says something kind: YOU DID ENOUGH TODAY. YOU ARE NOT AN ANIMAL IN A CHURCH.

And sometimes my phone buzzes at a time when it shouldn’t, and I throw it into the refrigerator out of habit. Old tricks for new days. I always take it out. I always check.

There are no more texts. Just notifications from my banking account or an email from a website I keep meaning to unsubscribe from.

There is a crumpled napkin inside my front door, though, wedged so it fell when I opened it yesterday, after work. The napkin is blank. It smells like coffee and alley air. Not impossible, there’s a café downstairs, but specific.

I stared at it for a long time with my coat still on and keys in my hand. Then I folded it in half and in half again and in half again until it was a compact, damp square that will not come unfolded without force. I slid it under the toonie on the shelf. I didn’t take a picture. I didn’t add it to a list. I just let it be the size it is.

Because here is the very last thing I learned: a person can be both wrong and right at the same time for a very long time. I was wrong to make the city smaller by carving it into threats with my eyes. I was right to listen to the parts of the night that were not my own.

If you’re reading this because you think you might be crazy, I don’t know what you should do. I’m not an expert. I’m not a movie. I can only tell you what I did: I paid attention until the day the attention pointed to something other than me. I made a record. I told the truth even when it made me look bad. I learned the sound my door makes when it is closed carefully from the inside by someone who is not me.

I've been married for about two years and my husband and I have always liked going out together and drinking on the weekends. When we first met, we went out like once every two weeks. However, over the past 7 years this has slowly devolved into him becoming a binge drinker. There was a period for around 6 months where he was unable to work earlier this year and that's when it got particularly bad because he didn't have a set schedule or responsibilities. 

He is working now again and things are better. He still likes to party and go out, but sometimes he can just have two beers and go home. Sometimes we get drunk one night and he's fine the next day, or only has a few beers the next day in the evening. However, other times it's a full weekend binge. The night we go out he will stay up til 5 or 6 am drinking. He drinks until he passes out basically. Then, when he wakes up the next day he starts drinking again. He tries to hide it from me but I hear him crack open a beer in the shower/ bathroom. Then he spends the whole day getting plastered without eating or barely eating. After that if it's a Sunday, he may even keep going. Three or four days he will keep drinking. 

I am just having a really hard time understanding why sometimes this happens and other times he can control it. I'm at my wits end honestly. For awhile we didn't keep alcohol in the house, however, we had family in town last week so now there is alcohol readily available.  
  
I basically spend weekends like this babysitting him and making sure he is okay. However, by the second day he's pretty unpleasant to be around. Today, was a holiday and I worked but he kept drinking. I felt so disgusted and upset. I know that a lot of times he likes to drink and hang out with me so I just left the house and worked from a coffee shop. I'm not sure if me being gone helped or just made him get more plastered because he felt lonely.

First unit: endless “Add Water” errors. Drove across town to swap it, got what looked like a refurbished unit… and it was defective out of the box. Support slow, software clunky, overall feels like a $350 prototype. 🍋

⸻

I wanted to love this thing. I really did. The design is beautiful, the promise is huge, and the hype is everywhere. But owning the Fellow Aiden has been like buying a Ferrari that spends more time in the shop than on the road.

Two units, two disasters:
	•	Unit #1: constant “Add Water” errors even when the tank was full. Went through all the troubleshooting, flushed, descaled, reseated. Nothing. → Returned.
	•	Unit #2: I had to drive to the store and pick up what looked like a refurbished replacement. The valve on the water tank was loose, I clicked it into place, but it still leaked the moment I filled it. → Countertop puddle, rising blood pressure.

Support = pain:
Feels like buying a Ferrari and finding out the pit crew clocks out early. Long waits, vague replies, no urgency. No real ownership of the problem — just me going in circles while nothing gets fixed.

Software = half-baked:
No simple “brew now” button. Wake up early? Too bad — you wait ten minutes while it warms up like you’re idling in the pits. Want to share brew profiles? Only if you buy their beans. For $600+, that’s insulting.

The kicker:
This is supposed to be a daily driver. Instead, it’s a fragile toy. Two units in a row, both defective. If this isn’t a lemon, I don’t know what is.

Bottom line:
When it actually works, sure, it can brew a beautiful cup. But day-to-day? It’s been frustration layered on frustration. The Fellow Aiden feels less like “precision coffee” and more like “paying to beta test.”",3,1756780807.0,FellowProducts,14,0.67,False

Many people are intrigued by its health benefits but struggle with the taste. Imagine sipping a cup that not only boosts your energy but also delights your taste buds. Sounds perfect, right? This article will show you how to transform your mushroom coffee into a delicious, crave-worthy beverage.

We’ll share simple tips and tricks that can make your morning routine something you look forward to. So, if you’re ready to enjoy every sip of your mushroom coffee, read on—you won’t want to miss this!

# Choosing The Right Mushrooms

Chaga, Lion’s Mane, and Reishi are popular mushroom choices. Each has a unique taste. Chaga offers a mild, earthy flavor. Lion’s Mane has a sweet, nutty taste. Reishi is more bitter but healthy.

Mushrooms give many health benefits. They boost the immune system. They help reduce stress. These mushrooms improve focus and memory. They are rich in antioxidants. This means they fight harmful cells.

# Balancing Bitter Notes

Adding sweeteners can help balance the bitter taste of mushroom coffee. Honey is a natural choice and adds a rich flavor. Maple syrup gives a sweet and earthy taste. Agave nectar is a good option for those who want something mild. Stevia is perfect for a sugar-free choice. Each sweetener brings its own unique flavor. So, try different ones to find what you like best.

Creamy additions make coffee taste smoother. Milk and cream are classic options. They reduce bitterness and add richness. Almond milk is a good non-dairy choice. It’s light and nutty. Coconut milk adds a sweet twist. Oat milk is another non-dairy favorite. It’s creamy and mild. Try different creams to find your favorite taste.

# Enhancing With Spices

Add a pinch of **cinnamon**to your mushroom coffee. It brings warmth and sweetness. Nutmeg adds a rich, nutty flavor. Together, they create a cozy drink. Perfect for cold days. Stir well before sipping. Enjoy the new taste adventure!

A drop of **vanilla**makes coffee smooth and creamy. Cardamom gives a unique, spicy kick. Mix them for a delightful twist. They balance the earthy mushroom taste. Your coffee will smell and taste amazing. Try it and see the difference!

# Experimenting With Brewing Methods

Using a **French Press**can make mushroom coffee taste better. Start with coarsely ground coffee and mushrooms. Boil water and let it cool slightly. Pour water over the grounds. Stir gently to mix. Put the lid on without pressing the plunger. Wait for about four minutes. Slowly press the plunger down. Pour the coffee into your cup. This method gives a rich, full flavor.

The **Cold Brew**method is another way to enjoy mushroom coffee. Mix ground coffee and mushrooms in a jar. Add cold water. Stir until well mixed. Cover the jar and place it in the fridge. Let it sit for 12 hours or overnight. Strain the mixture through a fine sieve or cloth. Serve over ice for a refreshing drink. This method makes the coffee smooth and less bitter.

I want new plasma donors to be more informed and become safer donors. I have solid educational advice for new plasma donors who may be considering to try it out, earn extra money, and save lives:

* [Plasma is 92% water and the rest is protein elements](https://www.sigmaaldrich.com/US/en/technical-documents/technical-article/clinical-testing-and-diagnostics-manufacturing/hematology/blood-basics)(about 7%), and other elements such as electrolytes, mineral salts, sugars, fats, hormones, and vitamins. With proper protein consumption, hydration, and electrolyte drinks, the body does replenish plasma volume (mainly the water component) within about 24–48 hours after donation, especially with adequate hydration and nutrition. However,[the full restoration of plasma proteins may take several days](https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/body/22865-plasma), and the 48-hour interval between donations is mandated primarily for donor safety and to allow partial replenishment, but not necessarily because all components are fully restored in 48 hours.

* [During **plasmapheresis**](https://bio.libretexts.org/Bookshelves/Introductory_and_General_Biology/General_Biology_(Boundless)/40:_The_Circulatory_System/40.08:_Components_of_the_Blood_-_Plasma_and_Serum), blood is drawn, plasma is separated, and red blood cells (and other components) are returned to the donor in cycles.

* Per FDA regulations, you're only allowed to donate plasma twice in a 7 day period, with a 48 hour wait in-between those two times. Don't risk your health by hopping around to different plasma donation centers to circumvent these regulations, and you may get caught if you do.[Donor identification systems are in place](https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/body/22865-plasma)to track donations across centers; attempting to donate more frequently can risk your health and may result in being barred from donation.

1. Eat a meal high in protein 2-3 hours before donating. Your plasma protein levels are influenced by [your **overall diet over several days**](https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/body/22865-plasma), not just the immediate pre-donation meal.

1. Drink plenty of water and/or non-caffeinated juice before donating to stay hydrated.[It's important to stay hydrated](https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/body/22865-plasma)at least the day before, and the day of your donation.

1. Avoid caffeine such as in coffee or soda before donating or it's possible you could get nauseous, lightheaded, vomit, or faint during your donation. Caffeine is a mild diuretic and can contribute to dehydration, while not prohibited,[it's recommended to avoid caffeine before you donate](https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/body/22865-plasma).

1. No alcohol 24 hours before, and for a little while after donating as[it can dehydrate you](https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/body/22865-plasma).

1. No strenuous exercise for[at least 6 hours after donating](https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/body/22865-plasma)as it can put too much stress on the vein. Some centers may recommend a longer or shorter time than 6 hours before exercising, but 6 hours is the average recommendation.

1. Some people get away with smoking or vaping nicotine before and after donating, but the nicotine can raise your heart's pulse rate and your blood pressure.[Most centers recommend](https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/body/22865-plasma)avoiding smoking or vaping nicotine at least 30 minutes to 2 hours before donating.

1. [If your pulse rate is above 100](https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/body/22865-plasma), you'll be able to do a vitals retake after a 15 minute wait. But if it's 100 or higher again you'll be deferred for the day. Taking sort of slower but deep breaths for 10 to 15 minutes before getting your vitals taken should help lower your pulse rate,[the box breathing technique](https://www.healthline.com/health/copd/box-breathing/)may also help ease your pulse rate. If your pulse rate is an issue, listen to binaural beats that are known to reduce anxiety and lower heart rate, at a low to medium volume with earbuds/headphones. Or try listening to ""Pink Noise"" or ""Green Noise"" at a low to medium volume before donating which may help reduce your pulse rate, along with its effect on lowering your blood pressure.

1. There is[a risk of getting a blown vein](https://medlineplus.gov/ency/article/000045.htm/)if the worker is having a hard time finding your vein when they're sticking you with the needle or if you have small veins. You may get deferred until your vein heals if that happens. But it's ok,[your body is able to heal and repair your veins](https://www.cslplasma.com/faq) via normal tissue healing.

1. There is a risk of blood clots, but when your blood is constantly moving through the machine[it prevents that from happening](https://www.cslplasma.com/start-donating). There will also be what’s called[an anticoagulant liquid](https://www.fda.gov/vaccines-blood-biologics/blood-donor-eligibility/blood-donation-process/)that will prevent you from getting blood clots.

1. You may be[subject to drug screening](https://www.cslplasma.com/faq/new-donor). The[drug screening tests](https://www.redcrossblood.org/faq.html#eligibility-medications%5C)for methamphetamines, cocaine, and heroin. Certain pharma prescription meds may show up as a false positive so you'll want to let the plasma center know what meds you're taking. Testing positive for these drugs can result in a permanent deferral from donating plasma.

1. A sample of your blood will be drawn periodically[to test for certain sexually transmitted infections](https://www.cslplasma.com/faq/new-donor)(STIs). A positive test will result in[either a temporary or permanent deferral](https://www.cslplasma.com/faq/new-donor)from donating plasma. If you've ever been diagnosed or received treatment for HIV/AIDS, Hepatitis B (HBV) or Hepatitis C (HCV) you will be permanently deferred from donating plasma.

* Wait[at least a few hours](https://www.cslplasma.com/start-donating)before taking the bandage wrap off of your arm after donating[to reduce bleeding and bruising risks](https://www.redcrossblood.org/donate-blood/blood-donation-process/after-your-donation.html/).

A Q-tip can be used to apply it easier. I simply dip the Q-Tip in the bottle, but never dip the used cotton back into the bottle. However, certain people may be allergic to Castor Oil, in that case Vitamin E/Mineral Oil can be used instead, but certain people may also be allergic to that too. Use of topical agents is not part of official plasma donation guidelines. If you choose to use them, be aware of potential allergies.

* Frequently donating over a prolonged period of time may lead to your body having[decreased immunoglobulin levels](https://ods.od.nih.gov/factsheets/VitaminD-Consumer//).

* Red meats are[particularly high in the protein nutrients](https://www.hsph.harvard.edu/nutritionsource/food-features/meat/)found in plasma.

* Taking vitamin and mineral supplements (e.g., vitamin D, calcium, magnesium, zinc, iron)[is generally safe in moderation but can be harmful in excess](https://ods.od.nih.gov/factsheets/list-VitaminsMinerals//). Most people get enough from their diet. Protein shakes before donation are not required but can help maintain protein levels.

# Donating Plasma with Managed Diabetes

Individuals with well-controlled diabetes can contribute to plasma donation, but certain criteria need to be met:

[Absence of Complications](https://www.cslplasma.com/faq): This means no existing diabetic complications affecting your kidneys, heart, blood vessels, or eyes.

Insulin: If you rely on insulin for diabetes management,[you must be healthy when you donate](https://www.cslplasma.com/faq/new-donor)and be free of symptoms or treatment needs related to blood sugar fluctuations (high or low). A 3-month wait period applies to non-prescribed drugs.

1. [Healthy Feet](https://www.cslplasma.com/faq/new-donor): Active foot ulcers requiring medical attention will disqualify you from donation.

1. [Steady Balance](https://www.cslplasma.com/faq/new-donor): You shouldn't experience dizziness or lightheadedness upon standing.

1. Type 1 Consideration: For Type 1 diabetics, eating within two hours of donation[is highly encouraged for all donors](https://www.cslplasma.com/blog).

I want new plasma donors to be more informed and become safer donors. I have solid educational advice for new plasma donors who may be considering to try it out, earn extra money, and save lives:

* [Plasma is 92% water and the rest is protein elements](https://www.sigmaaldrich.com/US/en/technical-documents/technical-article/clinical-testing-and-diagnostics-manufacturing/hematology/blood-basics)(about 7%), and other elements such as electrolytes, mineral salts, sugars, fats, hormones, and vitamins. With proper protein consumption, hydration, and electrolyte drinks, the body does replenish plasma volume (mainly the water component) within about 24–48 hours after donation, especially with adequate hydration and nutrition. However,[the full restoration of plasma proteins may take several days](https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/body/22865-plasma), and the 48-hour interval between donations is mandated primarily for donor safety and to allow partial replenishment, but not necessarily because all components are fully restored in 48 hours.

* [During **plasmapheresis**](https://bio.libretexts.org/Bookshelves/Introductory_and_General_Biology/General_Biology_(Boundless)/40:_The_Circulatory_System/40.08:_Components_of_the_Blood_-_Plasma_and_Serum), blood is drawn, plasma is separated, and red blood cells (and other components) are returned to the donor in cycles.

* Per FDA regulations, you're only allowed to donate plasma twice in a 7 day period, with a 48 hour wait in-between those two times. Don't risk your health by hopping around to different plasma donation centers to circumvent these regulations, and you may get caught if you do.[Donor identification systems are in place](https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/body/22865-plasma)to track donations across centers; attempting to donate more frequently can risk your health and may result in being barred from donation.

1. Eat a meal high in protein 2-3 hours before donating. Your plasma protein levels are influenced by [your **overall diet over several days**](https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/body/22865-plasma), not just the immediate pre-donation meal.

1. Drink plenty of water and/or non-caffeinated juice before donating to stay hydrated.[It's important to stay hydrated](https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/body/22865-plasma)at least the day before, and the day of your donation.

1. Avoid caffeine such as in coffee or soda before donating or it's possible you could get nauseous, lightheaded, vomit, or faint during your donation. Caffeine is a mild diuretic and can contribute to dehydration, while not prohibited,[it's recommended to avoid caffeine before you donate](https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/body/22865-plasma).

1. No alcohol 24 hours before, and for a little while after donating as[it can dehydrate you](https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/body/22865-plasma).

1. No strenuous exercise for[at least 6 hours after donating](https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/body/22865-plasma)as it can put too much stress on the vein. Some centers may recommend a longer or shorter time than 6 hours before exercising, but 6 hours is the average recommendation.

1. Some people get away with smoking or vaping nicotine before and after donating, but the nicotine can raise your heart's pulse rate and your blood pressure.[Most centers recommend](https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/body/22865-plasma)avoiding smoking or vaping nicotine at least 30 minutes to 2 hours before donating.

1. [If your pulse rate is above 100](https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/body/22865-plasma), you'll be able to do a vitals retake after a 15 minute wait. But if it's 100 or higher again you'll be deferred for the day. Taking sort of slower but deep breaths for 10 to 15 minutes before getting your vitals taken should help lower your pulse rate,[the box breathing technique](https://www.healthline.com/health/copd/box-breathing/)may also help ease your pulse rate. If your pulse rate is an issue, listen to binaural beats that are known to reduce anxiety and lower heart rate, at a low to medium volume with earbuds/headphones. Or try listening to ""Pink Noise"" or ""Green Noise"" at a low to medium volume before donating which may help reduce your pulse rate, along with its effect on lowering your blood pressure.

1. There is[a risk of getting a blown vein](https://medlineplus.gov/ency/article/000045.htm/)if the worker is having a hard time finding your vein when they're sticking you with the needle or if you have small veins. You may get deferred until your vein heals if that happens. But it's ok,[your body is able to heal and repair your veins](https://www.cslplasma.com/faq) via normal tissue healing.

1n67xfc,https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/1n67xfc/my_roommate_found_a_new_pair_of_shoes_by_the/,My roommate found a new pair of shoes by the dumpster. We should have never put them on,"When guests visited our apartment, they always commented on the smell—something old, almost medicinal. We blamed the building’s age, and after removing their shoes to come in, they’d eventually stop noticing it. Three years later and I still smell it. Reminds me of hospitals from my childhood.

My roommate Paul had the bigger room because he was here first, and I had responded to an ad online to rent the other. Kitchen, common area where we had the TV and our gaming consoles, dining nook, and a covered patio. Paul and I got along even though we came from different worlds. His was one that required a lot of posturing with friends and being perpetually online. Mine was maybe lonelier.

Somehow, we clicked, and after our respective workdays we often found ourselves collaborating on meals and playing games late. I liked RPGs; he preferred co-op shooters which I joined reluctantly because he got frustrated, yelled, and gave me side-eye whenever I suggested staying calm. He blamed his thick fingers.

From our apartment you could look down at a parking lot where every Tuesday garbage trucks made their rounds at 7 a.m. to the chagrin of tenants whose bedrooms faced that way, like mine.

I feel like these are important details. I’m describing my life as it has been for a while. It’s where I live, and it’s where I am now. It’s the mundane little facts that I need to tell you, so that they serve as counterweights to the hefty truth I’m about to unload, in search of sober advice. I just need to tell it so that you can understand. You won’t understand, but I’ve got to at least try.

“Olly, check it out!” I remember Paul said. I slurped some cheerios messily and looked up from my phone.

“What up?” I said.

“Those look new.”

I lazily pulled myself up and looked out the window.

“Huh? What, where?”

“Those shoes. I’m gonna go get them.”

Paul rushed out and soon emerged in the parking lot. I watched him step gingerly in his moccasins to the dumpster, and scoop up the pair of bright white sneakers, grinning up at me as he scurried back.

The door slammed. I pressed into my lower back to stretch as Paul came in. He proudly displayed the pair of shoes in one hand and snapped with the other.

“Tight!”

“They don’t stink,” I said.

The shoes were completely white, and despite sitting by a dumpster were impeccably clean.

“Smell like roses, these,” he said.

“Well, will they fit?”

“Size 11 baby!” he confirmed.

“Nice coincidence.”

Now we’ve come to the part of the story I can’t really expect you to believe. I wouldn’t. In my family we’ve seen tragedy. My younger brother was born with a disease that meant lots of operations before he could even walk. Hospitals became second homes; iodine soap a familiar salve; plastic-wrapped food and peel-back tin capped juice in those milky plastic containers a family meal. I accompanied my parents every time they went, and each time was like sucking the color out of dreams, the whimsy out of imagination. I didn’t grow up all at once, but my childhood was not child friendly. I learned that life was limited, solutions pragmatic and usually muted and smelly.

“Lemme try ‘em on,” said Paul.

He sat on the couch, pulled off his moccasins, put on the right shoe, then the left. And disappeared.

As soon as he put those shoes on, he was gone. Gone not in any sense that is common. I mean gone without any real-world indication that he was there before. Gone without any vision, nor any sound that would signal his disappearing. He was there, then he wasn’t, as if his existence simply ceased.

I watched the couch cushion slowly reform itself where Paul had been sitting. I was still standing, but I had moved back up against the wall and my palms were pressed against it as if expecting the room to suddenly fall away or for gravity’s pull to shift 90 degrees.

What felt like eternity was only a minute, and then Paul was back, sitting on the couch, panting, one of the new shoes in his hand. He looked around like a stranger before finding my eyes and locking on, making me feel like prey.

“Fuck!” I yelled.

“Fuck,” he whispered. He slowly regained control of his breathing and then yelled, wide-eyed at me. “Fuck! Olly!”

“What!” I screamed back, shaking. “What!”

Blood rushed back into his face as his complexion softened, and his eyes narrowed.

“Bro,” he said. “You won’t believe it.”

I didn’t believe it. He told me that he was in a forest. He said it was hot and humid, and the noises of insects, birds and dripping rain were as vivid as anything here. He struggled to recall things at first because of the shock, but as we calmed down, he told me he had truly been there, in the rainforest, standing on moist black dirt and looking up at sunlight piercing canopy. He said it smelled ‘exquisite’, a word that was out of character for him.

“You’re saying you were in the Amazon?” I said finally.

“No idea bro,” he said. “Amazon maybe. I don’t know.”

“Maybe Borneo?”

“I don’t know. The rainforest man. The deadass rainforest.”

“Alright,” I said.

By now he had taken off the other shoe and the pair was just sitting there in front of us on the rug.

Paul eyed me. Looked at the shoes.

“Yup,” he said. “You gotta.”

“The hell I do,” I countered.

“You gotta.”

He grimaced, reading my face, I guess.

“You wanna, Olly. You wanna, trust me.”

I did. I felt calm enough to know that I did. I had to try this. They’d fit my size 10 feet.

I bent down and grabbed one, slipped it on my socked foot. Grabbed the other, and held there, staring at Paul.

“What should I—you know,” I prompted.

“Fuck, right, dude. Listen. Just take the shoe off, it’s what I did, and pow, I’m back. Just take off the shoes.”

This was our exchange before I put the other shoe on, and the apartment was immediately gone. No cues, no noise or visual of transition. Just there, and now here. Where was I? It wasn’t a forest like Paul; it was a field. I felt the sun on my skin. Hills in the distance, and a highway? A semi-truck rumbling past. Buildings in the distance.

I bent down and tore off a shoe, and was suddenly back in the apartment facing a roommate whose body language bounced with intrigue.

“Dude!” he yelled. “You just vanished!”

“My God,” I said. “Jesus Christ.”

He was nodding with his whole head and neck, as if vibing. Wide-eyed, unblinking.

“Sick, right? The rainforest—”

“—not a forest,” I said. “More like a prairie, I guess? But there was a road, a big truck. Buildings too.”

“No shit. I’d’ve checked out those buildings,” he said a bit curtly.

“Yeah but I came back before I could really get my bearings. It was crazy.”

“Crazy,” he repeated. “Crazy.”

We both looked at the shoe I held.

So, this is the secret. Magical shoes that transported us. Not unheard of in fiction but I am telling you that this happened to us. Paul went to a forest. I went to a prairie. We found a pair of shoes in the trash and put them on and were teleported to these destinations instantaneously.

It didn’t stop there. It couldn’t. Would you have stopped? Paul went again. When he came back, he told me he was on a hill overlooking a valley and could see a whole city that he didn’t recognize. I went again and found myself on a grey sand beach with a cold wind. We went a few more times like this. Once, I found myself on a snowy mountain, and when I reappeared in our apartment Paul said I was cold to the touch. There was even snow in my hair. Then Paul went again, and the asshole was gone for five whole minutes. When he returned, I was surprised to see him cradling about 10 mangos.

“What the hell?” I said.

“A mango orchard man, a bleeping orchard fer real!”

“Are they ripe?”

We took a break from teleportation over slices of fresh mango. We discussed our experience and decided that the destinations were random. We knew it didn’t matter if we walked around, that we always returned to the apartment. We knew there were cities, so we knew there were people. It was clearly Earth so whatever magic this was, it was here. But when was it? Had either of us seen anything out of whack for 2025? No, we hadn’t. Still no people.

“Maybe we should stop,” I remember saying. “Give it a rest maybe.”

Neither of us wanted to do that. We had the whole day still.

We took turns teleporting, and we learned more. We started to figure that eventually we should land in cities. A few times we each landed within sight of populations, but since we had agreed to a one-minute limit after Paul’s five-minute disappearance, we couldn’t yet reach those places. Paul begrudged the rule. We also figured that if we hadn’t landed in towns or cities yet, it was only because most of the globe is still just wild land, farms, or water.

Bad timing, to jinx ourselves like that.

I pulled on the second shoe and at once lost my senses. Not that I couldn’t feel, because the shock of cold was devastating and I gasped. Not that I couldn’t taste because when I gasped, I lost my breath as my mouth filled with icy salt water. Not that I couldn’t see but it was black night and then plunging darkness. Not that I couldn’t hear but it was shrieking wind and then warbled frigid water in ghostly depths that seemed to tear me in different directions.

I struggled, panic filled. Reach. But swim, swim! I thought. Must breathe, I knew, but I could escape this. I reached, and just as my lungs began to inhale, my frozen knuckles locked their fingers around a shoe and tugged it off.

Suddenly I was in the apartment on all fours heaving and vomiting saltwater over our rug. Shivering miserably, drenched completely. I felt Paul hitting my back. My ears were ringing, adjusting to the sudden warmth.

Paul brought water. Patted my back.

“I was,” I said. My voice sounded like gravel. “I was in the ocean, I think.”

Paul just stared, nodded. He was amazed and still I sensed, jealous?

Later I sat in my robe wrapped in towels before a humming space heater. I told him about the storm, the night. We had already experienced nighttime in the couple hours we had been at this adventure. I told him about the crashing waves that I couldn’t escape.

“We have to be more careful,” I said.

That had been enough for one day.

We agreed the shoes would stay in the living room, that we would only use them together. We spent the rest of the evening talking about it. Unbelieving, but convinced. We planned. From now on we had an entry position. We’d sit in cannonball position, but one leg crossing the other. Both hands would grasp the second shoe as we put it on, so that we’d already be prepared to yank it off in case of trouble. We considered other things like wearing a wetsuit and flippers, goggles, even an oxygen tank, given how likely it should be that we’d land in an ocean somewhere. But ultimately, we decided to buy a large plastic sheet from Home Depot and lay it out on the living room floor to catch water, and to purchase a simple lifejacket that wouldn’t hinder movement when teleporting plopped us on dry land.

I barely slept that night. As frightening as they were, these shoes changed my life. I was jittery with excitement, suppressing fear.

We both called in sick next morning. Of course we did.

Then we got into Paul’s car and went on our errands. Only took an hour.

Back at the apartment, we laid our new plastic sheet where the rug had been. Rug was hung to dry out on the patio. The life jacket was a small sea kayaker’s jacket. Stylish and minimal. We had also bought a small knife, some beef jerky, a headlamp, a length of high-strength static line, and bug spray. The jacket had pockets for these things.

We also decided to pack my phone in the jacket. It had a better waterproof rating than Paul’s, and my international roaming plan was less ghastly expensive than his, if we ever landed somewhere with signal. We wanted to take photos and videos. But mostly it was to set the timer, as we’d agreed to increase the time to five minutes. Later we’d increase it to ten minutes.

We shared a large breakfast of hashbrowns, egg sausage sandwiches and dark coffee. Then the adventure began.

As the morning progressed, an area of our living room began to look like a naturopath’s collection. On each trip, we’d bring something back. A rock. A branch. A flower or bundle of grass. Dirt, or sometimes trash. It was shocking how rarely we landed close to people yet how often we found trash. It became clear that we were hitting places all over the world. Wrappers with Chinese lettering, a grocery bag with Tamil (the phone translation app said), French, other languages we’d yet to identify.

On one trip Paul was gone over five minutes. I began to worry. His phone rang and I picked it up. ‘Olly’, it read. I accepted.

“Paul?” I said, haltingly.

“Brooooo!” I heard him yell. It was a perfectly clear call.

“Paul!” I exclaimed. I stood and paced. “Paul where are you?”

“I’m not sure but I got bars bro! So, I’m callin’.”

“Any landmark? What’s the climate?”

“Pretty dry. I think I’m in a desert, but there are power lines I see. I guess a cell tower’s close so.”

My hand was in my hair, as if calming my mind.

“Clear skies,” he said.

“Maybe you’re stateside somewhere? Southwest? Take a photo, we can reverse image search back here again. Or wait just open the map app, I downloaded a ton of regions last night.”

“Hold on.”

I waited a few seconds.

“No dice, no internet just calling. GPS shows I’m nowhere,” he said.

“Damn.”

“Yeah. Hey, Olly?”

“What’s up?”

Just then he appeared almost exactly where I was pacing and I bumped into him, knocking us both to the plastic-covered ground. We laughed maniacally.

When we calmed, he showed me some photos he’d taken.

“GeoGuessr eat your heart out,” I said.

“Huh?”

“You know, that Google Maps street view game? It shows you a street view somewhere on the planet and you guess where it is by dropping a pin on a map. Whoever’s closest wins. I played with colleagues a few times.”

“That’s an idea,” said Paul.

We created a map, named it ‘Jumping Jimmies.’ Then we did a reverse image search on one of the pictures that Paul had taken with my phone. While it wasn’t conclusive it gave us some lookalikes.

“Could be that one. ‘Red Sand’, in Saudi.”

“Mmm,” I said. “But look at that rock, a bit too unique. You woulda seen that. This one? Devil’s Desert?”

“Not sandy enough.”

“Namibia? No.”

“Wait, that one!” Paul exclaimed. “What’s that?”

“Oh yeah that looks good. Says ‘Atacama, Chile’.”

“Yes! That’s it I’m sure of it! Mark it.”

We chose a series of icons that we labeled by the percentage of how sure we were of each location. \~90% on the Atacama Desert, green circle.

Elation welled up in my heart. I had always loved to travel and now I was traveling the world incognito. Paul and I were prepared, ready, and eager. We thought we anticipated everything. If only we’d kept our guard up…

 

By evening many colorful icons dotted our map. We had taken dozens of photos, one of Paul’s toothy smile beside a grinning shepherd on a mountain road somewhere in Kyrgyzstan, another of a group of people at a bus stop in a Colombian town (Paul envied how often I landed with people).

“Yeah, you always get the good places,” Paul said. “I just get trees and hills. Every single time.”

Puddles pooled on the plastic tarp in our living room from a handful of times we found ourselves swimming. Paul wanted to visit a city, but I wasn’t ready to increase our time limit enough to walk to one or to board a bus like in Colombia. We had to take it slowly, and I knew that if Paul would be patient we’d land in one.

But then it finally happened.

Tokyo is the largest city on Earth, with a population over 30 million. Fitting then that it was the first big city we happened upon, or that I happened upon. I had learned to reign in my expectations when slipping on the second shoe. In less than an instant I was teleported onto a narrow road, remarkably carless and calm, staring up at skyscrapers glinting in sunlight. I recognized Japanese on the shopfront, and English accompanying all the street signs. In fact, I’d been to Tokyo before, and so the sight was familiar. The sight of me, however, less so. At least to a curious couple ogling me. I realized a foreigner in the middle of a Tokyo street wearing a lifejacket packed with survival items and awkwardly sat hugging his knees and grabbing a shoe would look bizarre.

I scampered to my feet and out of the way of a stout little delivery van driving past. I smiled at the couple who continued walking. I retrieved my cell phone; 09 minutes 04 seconds left before I should remove a shoe.

Something immediately caught my attention—the sweet scent of tempura frying. I located its source: a small restaurant with ubiquitous noren fabric hanging to mark its entryway. I was in Tokyo. I loved Japanese food, loved it absolutely. Here I was! I had to, right? We couldn’t control where we landed, so who knows when I’d happen upon Japan, and Tokyo itself, again? I found my hands searching my chest as I realized I had no money. We should’ve been traveling with credit cards at least. But they pay with cash here mostly. Impractical to travel with every currency, though, and impractical to expect a currency exchange.

Then it dawned on me, to my shame and to my joy, that I could dine and dash without so much as a step to flee.

Parted the noren to enter. Konnichiwa, hello. I sat at the bar in the narrow locale, removing my lifejacket ashamedly and hanging it on a hook underneath. I ordered the tendon by pointing. The aroma, the delectable crispy vegetables and shrimp, beautifully crisp, and umami flavors.

As if waking from a dream I remembered Paul and quickly checked the time. I was already ten minutes overdue! With averted eyes and utter embarrassment and shame for what they’d think, I snatched my lifejacket and ducked under the bar. Removed a shoe.

“Son of a bitch!” yelled Paul. “Where the fuck were you? I was freaking out man. We said ten minutes!” He sniffed. “What’s that smell?”

I begged his forgiveness and placed my hands on his shoulders, urging him onto the couch. Calm, calm.

“It’s toasted sesame,” I said. “I was in Tokyo. I ate tempura.”

“Tempura? That fried stuff they serve with sushi?”

“Sure, yeah.”

“Did you say... Tokyo? A city? You ate in a city!?” he yelled, smiling.

“Damn right,” I said.

“Jumpin’ jimmies!” he yelled, and I repeated that refrain reflexively. “Mark it down! A city, you lucky bastard. Lowkey smells insane. You lucky, lucky asshole. And you didn’t bring any back.”

“Damn it!” I said. “I’m sorry Paul, I didn’t think about it. When I saw the time—”

“—Yeah. All good. Man, I want to land in a city.”

Paul’s eyes were on the lifejacket, but not really. They were distant, imaginative. I couldn’t tell if he was more happy or more envious -- long stares are tough to decipher.

“You’ll get there man, I promise. We’ll get you there.”

For a moment annoyance crossed his expression, but it didn’t linger long enough for comment.

“Yeah,” he said plainly.

We jumped a few more times and then Paul said he wanted to take a break. Envious, it turned out. He was sulking. Disappeared into his room without too many words between us. I figured he’d just have to let it settle, and we’d be back at it in the evening.

I fixed myself a sandwich and ate it while observing our disorderly living room. Souvenirs, laptops, wet plastic. Then I retired to my own room, surprised to feel tired. I think the jumps take it out of you.

I sank into willful sleep.

 

When next I woke it was dark outside. I’d slept the whole afternoon. Clock read 9 p.m.

Out in the living room everything looked the same. Paul’s door was shut. My mouth felt dry and so I poured a glass of water and leaned on the counter, marveling at our mess again.

Then I saw.

The shoes were gone.

I set the glass down, and skipped to Paul’s door, knocked.

“Paul? You awake?” I opened it. “Paul?” Not there.

As I rushed back into the living room and started upending cushions in search of the shoes, it was like watching an actor in a movie you’ve already seen. I knew he’d taken them. I knew he jumped.

The lifejacket was on the floor. I retrieved my phone from a pouch. “Idiot,” I thought. “You left it.”

No missed calls, no texts. I called Paul’s phone and heard it ringing in his room. “Idiot,” I said to myself more sharply.

How long had he been gone? I looked for any new artifacts, any notes or new pins on our Google map. Nothing. I checked the tarp, which was mostly dry now. His car was still parked outside. I opened our front door and stuck my head out. Hallway was clear.

“This sonofabitch straight up donned the shoes and peaced,” I said aloud.

In anger I sounded more like Paul than myself. Oppressive silence seemed to coalesce. It was a bit more humid than normal—all the extra salt water. Suddenly our pile of artifacts and souvenirs seemed nasty, so I grabbed a garbage bag and shoved everything in, tied it off. I was helpless.

Hours went by. It was 3 a.m. by the time I felt tired again. My eyes stung. I drank some water and retreated to my bed where I finally let myself pass out.

 

Beep-beep-beep.

Groggy and petrified I calmed myself when I realized I was just waking up. The garbage truck upturned the dumpster, its metal arms clanging as it guzzled trash and then replaced the container, drove off. I fell out of bed. 7 a.m.

Out in the living room the scene was unchanged. No Paul. He had been gone for so many hours.

I cooked runny oatmeal, added raisins and slurped it. Could he have drowned? Didn’t take the lifejacket, the buffoon. Real possibility. Maybe he landed in Vegas and would pop back home to regale me with some story worthy of The Hangover. Wild animal could’ve attacked him, but I struggled to imagine he wouldn’t have the time to remove a shoe. Maybe he’s just on a hike. I knew I shouldn’t have eaten that tempura. I like Paul but I knew he was quick to jealousy. Why didn’t I smooth things over? It would’ve taken five minutes max. Paul’s ego wanted, needed to be coaxed. Two days and already we’re at each other’s throats? No that can’t be it. A misunderstanding maybe. He’s just off to prove a point. Don’t fuck with the rules, Olly, he’ll tell me. Tell yourself, man. Leaving precautions behind, no phone even. God damn it.

I was chewing on a raisin, the wet oatmeal juice resting in my mouth awaiting to be swallowed. I was staring at the plastic sheet on our living room floor. One moment that’s all I was doing; the next I was staring at a body.

Face-down. Shirtless. Holes in his back, blood pooling, some dripping down the torso. White shorts, pockets outturned, stained. One white shoe, stained. The other foot bare and dirty. Thick fingers, bent and broken on one hand. The way jumping works, it makes it seem that this body had been there for as long as I had been looking at that spot, that I’d been staring at it while I slurped cooling oatmeal. That I should feel guilty for only plunging into nightmare after the body appeared and not before.

Paul. Paul’s body. His hair, his broken hands. The smell. My mind recalled images of hospitals and gowns with geometric prints, hands scrubbing harsh brown bars of soap with foam that smelled medicinal and metallic and burnt. The smell of memory competed with the smell of death, one trying to sanitize the other because it cannot be. It can’t. He can’t be dead.

Oatmeal dribbled down my chin before I could close my mouth. It suddenly tasted like raw meat, and I spat into the sink. I became aware of my pounding heart playing catch-up. All my senses were delayed, as if reality could not so abruptly be changed, so noiselessly debased to this horror.

Each sniff triggered a gag. Each blink felt eternal. Give it enough time to just erase this. Blink it out of existence, I know it can be done. Please, please, please.

I write this anonymously. My name’s not Olly and his is not Paul. But I need help. There is a body, shot to death, laying on a plastic tarp in my living room. There’s only one shoe the other is gone. No one will believe me. What do I do?",34,1756780313.0,nosleep,0,0.96,False

Okay, maybe pizza drones, but that's tomorrow’s post!

Everywhere I look, there’s some wild new ML development popping up, from image generators doodling like digital Picassos, to chatbots acing the Turing test (👀), to medical diagnostics that *might* someday keep us all from dreading doctor appointments. 

It kind of feels like we’re living on the cusp of a sci-fi movie. And we’re the protagonists!

Here’s why I’m personally so jazzed about the advances we’re seeing:

- **Accessibility is skyrocketing**: It’s no longer the hobby of research labs and lounge lizards at conferences. Open source frameworks, cloud platforms—anyone can dip their toes into ML for basically the price of a coffee.
- **Real world impact**: Machine learning already impacts our daily routines and we barely notice. Spotify knows your musical mood better than your best friend. Google Translate decodes menus in lands where you don’t even know the alphabet. 
- **Constant surprise factor**: Just when I think “It can’t get smarter…”—BAM! Transfer learning. Reinforcement learning. Language models finishing your sentences and dreams.

And what I love, truly, is the collaborative energy behind this. The open exchange of notebooks, datasets, and YES, failures and iterations, too—how magical is that? Learning is no longer confined to sterile textbooks or sleepless hackathons. 

Speaking of learning—raise your hand if you’ve ever felt overwhelmed trying to keep pace with all these shiny new ML concepts? 

Same! HIGH FIVE! 🙋‍♂️

Remember when neural networks sounded intimidating? Now even little projects can use convolutional, recurrent, and even transformer models(!) without writing a bazillion lines from scratch. The sheer volume of tutorials, bootcamps, and Discord servers out there makes it so dang inviting to test, snoop, remix, and GROW.

But here’s the real fun thought to debate—

- Is there such a thing as *too much* advancement in machine learning, too quickly?
- Are we building tools we always wanted, or opening Pandora’s algorithmic box?
- How do we keep the “happy chaos” of disruption, while ensuring fairness, accountability, and inclusiveness?

I get SO HAPPY to watch ML unfold across creative, scientific, and social corners. To anyone jumping in, struggling, breaking stuff, succeeding, or quietly observing—this ride’s a wild one, and you’re not alone. 

What’s *your* favorite “wait… ML can do THAT now?!” moment? Where do you see this all going (besides pizza drones, ofc)? 🍕

I also take pre-workout occasionally before workouts and creatine afterwards. And sometimes, fish oil capsules as well.

Yesterday, after the pre-workout (which contains L-Citrulline DL-Malate, Caffeine, L-Arginine, and Beta-Alanine), I felt a sudden loss of energy in the body. It wasn't anything drastic, but a bit uncomfortable and unexpected. I was still able to complete the workout without much issue, but it took a significant amount of effort. I don't drink tea/coffee in general and never have my whole life. Pre-workout is something I've started only a few months ago as well.

Afterwards, I took creatine as I always do after a workout. I had a mild feeling of stomach upset and a general uncomfortable feeling for the rest of the day.

  
I can explain the loss of energy because I forgot to eat bananas for carbs before my workout, but I'm not sure about the stomach upset.

Work, an MBA, and life itself have taken me across five countries. I’ve loved every chapter of that adventure, but now I’m ready to build a cozy home - with the right person.

I’d love to meet someone in their 30s or 40s who’s thriving in their own career and personal life, and who’s also ready for a real, lasting partnership.

I’m a deeply feeling introvert who spends a lot of time on health, fitness (yes, I’m a bit of a fanatic and proud of being in great shape), nutrition, and spirituality-lately learning more about Advaita. I throw myself into the things I care about, whether that’s work, friendships, or simply living everyday life with intention. I’m equally comfortable debating world affairs, swapping travel stories, or laughing over something completely silly.

I also know that two people coming together to build a life isn’t easy. What makes it work, I believe, are respect, trust, and a lasting friendship to carry you through the tougher parts.

Who I imagine you to be:

You laugh easily, say funny things, and love when I do the same.
You are my BFF and do not roll your eyes when I use the term BFF.
You are damn smart – but not a snob about it. You are in love with life. Family comes first. 
You do not mistake my warmth, love, and affection for weakness.
You do what you love. You make the best of any situation.
You share your chips with me. You will come with me for walks. 
You love hard, fight fair, and balance modern independence with a touch of old-school kindness.
Compassion and generosity guide your choices, and you always try to see the best in people.
Simply put, you inspire me and are inspired by me. That’s the kind of bond I’m looking for—one that’s deep and supportive, but also light-hearted and adventurous.

So what say - shall we travel, smash patriarchy, cook healthy, work out often, make memories, and open our hearts and minds?

If this resonates with you-win me over with free-flowing conversations, deep enough to matter and spark thought, playful enough to see the humor in things. Hit me up if you'd like to grab a coffee, and/or fall in love and start naming the future dogs.",1,1756780014.0,r4r,1,0.67,False

I'm a 24 year old girl, and I'm looking for more people in my life to be able to talk to, and potentially become closer with to a point where we consider each other legitimate family and could maybe even get together for holidays and special occasions. It might take me a while to get to that point since I need a lot of extra time to build trust, but I would love nothing more!

I really want siblings to be able to be best friends with. I've always dreamed of having a younger brother, and I think it'd be amazing to have a sister near my age who thinks of me as a best friend too. More than anything though right now, I could really use some healthy parental (or aunt/uncle) relationships. I don't have a single adult that I look up to and can go to for advice or support, and that's been pretty rough on me.

A little about me is that I love being crafty! It's really fulfilling to me to make my loved ones gifts or cute little letters to brighten their day.

I also am an accomplished pianist. I love all sorts of styles of music, but I love to play studio ghibli music more than anything!

I love to be active in the ways that I can, but I'm struggling a lot with my health right now. I've been disabled for a few years and am still in search of answers. When I'm feeling well enough for it though, I love water aerobics, pickleball, foosball, ping pong, biking, hikes and soccer! I also love playing with little kids - I love engaging with them by trying to understand their make believe worlds and see things from their perspectives. It's really fulfilling to me!

I have adored video games for as long as I can remember - I especially love pokémon, webkinz, animal crossing, terraria, smash bros, rogue-likes, and pretty much any cutesy games you can think of! But I can also kick ass in shooter games too, if I'm given a minute to get the hang of it ;)

I also love anime, and have been (very slowly) learning Japanese! I'm also a big fan of doctor who as well. If I could meet any celebrity, it'd be David Tennant hands down 🤩

As far as my beliefs go, I care immensely about human and animal rights. I have been protesting as much as I can in the US to try and fight against all of the human rights violations that have been happening lately, especially in regards to people of color, LGBTQ+, and women. As far as religion goes, I don't believe in any or any god, and actually carry quite a bit of religious trauma due to having grown up in a cult.

One other important thing about me! I'm happily married to my best friend in the whole world. He's amazing, and should you get closer to me I'd also love for you to meet him at some point too! He's 26, currently is going to grad school, loves board games/video games, and coffee. We also have pet rats and pet beetles that we love more than anything ❤️

If you think that we might get along well or you want to get to know more about me to see if we might be a good fit, please reach out through DM! I feel like I have a lot of love in my heart that is just yearning for more places to go. Thanks for reading!",2,1756780002.0,FamiliesYouChoose,1,1.0,False

I’ve never had this issue with Starbucks before until the last year or so. My mom and I ordered iced lattes this past weekend and couldn’t drink them because we couldn’t taste the coffee at all. I even asked for mine to be remade, which I hated doing but wanted to at least make an attempt, and the coffee they gave me was even milkier than the one they originally made.

I (19M) met my girlfriend (18F) back in April after being recommended by a good buddy of mine. We were originally only suppose to be prom dates but we ended up liking eachother a lot and ended up getting together.

The first few months of our relationship were pretty normal. We had a good intimate connection, we shared a lot of quality time together, and overall things were pretty good. Or so I thought. Towards the end of June, I went swimming with her and quickly noticed something was off. Her overall demeanor and attitude towards me just didn't seem right. When we we're done swimming, I asked her if we could hangout for a little bit and she agreed. But here's the thing, she almost seemed annoyed. Like she didn't want to but is doing it anyway so she wouldn't hurt my feelings. We ended up going to a coffee shop and chatted for a while before parting ways. I laid in my bed that night worrying that I might have screwed something up or have accidentally pissed her off. I texted her the next morning and asked her if everything was okay and she said that she had a really rough week, to which I understood and gave her space. Unbeknownst to me at the time, this would officially mark the spot were things would start to go downhill.

As the days past and the month of July rolled through, she started to distance herself from me. Intimacy decreased and she no longer seemed like she wanted to spend time with me. There were numerous occasions where I made plans with her and she would end up cancelling on me last minute and go hangout with her friends instead. (There were a few times where we spent time together but I wouldn't necessarily call it quality time) I communicated with her about this and she said that she was going through a ""phase"". Essentially, she told me that she really wasn't feeling like herself and told me that she really needed space. To which I understood and respected. But things still weren't getting better. 

Last month came by and things were still the same, no intimacy, no quality time spent together, and a lot of emotional disconnection. However, when my girlfriend was on a family trip, she opened up to me and apologized for everything. I'll told her that it was okay and forgave her. But even after her apologizing, things still dont seem any better. 

I have no idea what to do. There were times were I thought things were starting to get better, but it would just end up relapsing. I've tried communicating with her but she doesn't seem committed. I mean, she's not perfect by any means. She has her flaws and I have mine, but at this point I'm just confused. I don't feel the spark we use to have anymore, and honestly I want to end the relationship, but a part of me wants to hang on and wait things out.
