1h3wsnp,https://www.reddit.com/r/travel/comments/1h3wsnp/conscious_traveling/,Conscious traveling ,"Too often, I come across people traveling from the richest counties on earth to the poorest with the intention of spending as little money as possible. The internet is saturated with tips on how to travel on a shoestring and packing lists to make sure you don’t need to buy anything on the road. I hear stories from people who seem to think that a smile and an anecdote from them is enough payment for a decidedly poorer family feeding them. And often it is. Of course you’re not going to offer to pay everyone for everything. I am not suggesting that every interaction be transactional. But I've noticed that the end point of karma is all too often the person who needs it least. For every person who feeds you or gives you a place to sleep when you’re lost in a foreign land, you should aim to do the same or similar for someone else. Sure, a smile can go round the world, but people still need to feed their families and your pearly whites aren’t going to do that for them. In my conversations over the years, I’ve heard rebukes about not being rich and having to travel cheaply. My answer is always, if you’re traveling for an extended period in a tropical country, then you’re richer than most people in that country. You have enough saved up for a 3 month trip? Make it a 2.5 month trip and don’t exploit the kindness of the people you’re meeting along the way. 

This is especially true for traveling remote workers/digital nomads. There is no justification for spending several months in, for example, SE Asia and getting paid a London salary while balking at the idea of spending money locally. When I travel, I take a small backpack. Inside, you’ll find a t shirt or 2, some shorts, underwear for a couple of days, kindle, and my laptop. Everything else that I need, I buy when I arrive. I spend the first day in a city buying the clothes and toiletries that I’ll need for my time in that country. Then, before I leave a few months later, I find a local homeless charity or orphanage, and I donate the clothes I bought. When I get to the next country, I do the same. This way, I am contributing the local economy by buying things and helping those in need in a small way before I leave. As well as that, in each place I stay, I try to find some other way to be of service to the community I am staying in. There are many ways to do this. If you are staying in a beach town, there will most likely be charity groups that clean the beach. Local environmental or humanitarian charities often need help with fundraising or advertising their issues. If you're staying somewhere like Phuket, consider giving some time to a legitimate elephant sanctuary to help care for the elephants rather than the tourist traps. If you're a web developer, consider humbly offering your skills for a few days to help a local charity set up or improve their website. If you're good with words, consider writing a blog about some real local issues not just where is best to get a coffee with strong wifi. If you're scuba certified, then consider qualifying as an eco diver and take part in research dives to help conserve the beautiful oceans that we like to gaze out on.

Of course, you're allowed to travel and enjoy the wonders of world, but if you're traveling long term and taking advantage of the cheaper cost of living in other countries, then just consider giving something valuable back.",0,1733033137.0,travel,0,0.5,False
1h3wsa9,https://www.reddit.com/r/TrueOffMyChest/comments/1h3wsa9/thanksgiving_was_so_disappointing/,Thanksgiving was so disappointing,"I was so excited to host a big Thanksgiving meal in my husband’s and I’s place for the first time since we bought our home.

We’d done small catered or curbside heat and eat type meals before with our mothers, but this was a larger, elaborate meal with mostly homemade from scratch dishes (100% made by me) 

My husband’s family have lived in the US for many years, but are originally from a middle eastern country. While my brother in law was previously married to an American woman and went to Thanksgivings at his ex MIL’s home with their kids, I’m not sure what their customs or traditions were there. 

I planned a lovely buffet meal for 4pm. I set up the adult table with decor and embroidered linens. The kids table had fun activities for the kids, and I planned for a kids movie to play on the TV to keep them occupied. I had fine china out on the buffet for adults and durable paper plates for the kids with fun designs. 

My husband’s family showed up 45 minutes early. I was still in the heat of cooking and popped my head out to say hi, but only his mother came into the kitchen to say hello. They immediately wanted (Turkish) coffee, which wasn’t easy to navigate with the burners full and casseroles needing to rotate. 

As always, my husband jumped in to help with cooking, washing dishes, making coffee- but this did mean his family was left “alone” in the living room. My mother was out there with them, working hard to keep conversation flowing. She later told me they were very uninterested in having conversation and she felt like she was talking to a brick wall. She asked them lots of questions about their lives and developments since the last time she’d seen them, and they answered shortly, without anyone ever asking her a question back.

Shortly after arriving, my FIL had a tense conversation with BIL in Arabic, making big gestures towards the TV playing the Charlie Brown Thanksgiving movie. A family tradition of ours I wanted to continue in honor of my grandfather who had passed on, for whom Charlie Brown was a treasured part of every holiday. A frenzy ensued with the TV, with BIL rushing to change the channel to find a TV show my FIL wanted to watch. (This is AFTER my mother explained why the movie was important) They were not able to find this show, so he insisted anything else be put on (he wanted a show in Arabic), and once his show was on my FIL did not say another word for hours. 

When dinner was ready at 4, I announced for them to come make a plate, and they sat for another ~5 minutes ignoring me (not even talking, just sitting there) it was extremely odd. When they came in to make plates, they immediately passed out the fine china to the 6-10 year old children and the adults rummaged through our cabinets for other plates. When I got out to the table, our 10 year old nephew was sitting at the adults table. I started to say something (we didn’t have enough space/chairs for him to sit here) but something was said harshly by my FIL in Arabic and everyone scattered to make room for the boy. My SIL ended up on the couch with the children. I was fuming at this but exhausted and sick of fighting. I’m ashamed to say I didn’t fight back against this. I absolutely should have. We both apologized to her later in the night, but it is still bothering me. 

As his family finished dinner, they individually popped up from the table and went to the living room. I’ve never seen them do this in their own home- usually people sit together until everyone is done. They were at the table for maybe 15-20 minutes max, silently eating the entire time. My mother and I kept trying to make conversation but were rebuffed. 

My mother was appalled by this so I sat with her at the table a bit longer, just the two of us. I heard commotion behind me in the kitchen, but assumed they were making coffee again, which I was fine with. My husband was busy entertaining the kids while my FIL took over the TV again. When I went to the kitchen a bit later, I saw one of the (hidden) pies half eaten out on the counter- not even cut, almost scraped out as if with a spoon. I had a whole spread for dessert with 3 pies, whipped cream, and ice cream, so I was really upset they served themselves (it could not have been easy to find either- I hid them well to keep the kids from going crazy) I later found out that my FIL insisted he be served dessert right after dinner to his wife, who went looking for dessert for him. 

After being in our home for about 1.5 hours, including the 45 minutes they were early, my BIL was nervously pacing around grumbling about wanting to leave. He argued with his wife about getting the kids to leave, who were just relaxing and playing games at this point. The kids were extremely upset about leaving, and I interjected to ask my BIL if everything was OK, as I was about to serve dessert. He reluctantly said oh fine they can have it, which allowed me a few minutes to put out the dessert options. Everyone had dessert and seemed to enjoy it, but it was rushed. I was so upset at this point I think I dropped my mask a bit. 

My FIL and MIL and two of the kids had planned to stay the night that night. My FIL had already gone to bed (at ~5:30/6) and the other kids were throwing fits about leaving. My BIL walked out of the house without his kids and left his wife and my husband to carry them out kicking and screaming. The kids were hitting my SIL and she just had this dead look in her eyes. No one else said anything or helped out with calming the kids down. 

My mother and I spent a couple hours playing games with the two boys who stayed while my husband visited with his mother and cleaned up. We enjoyed the games a lot and for a brief moment, it felt like old school family time. 

I thought I might have been the only one who got upset. I’m pregnant and already do not enjoy his family very much, so I thought I may have blown the events out of proportion. However, I spoke to my mom the next day and felt her heartbreak and disappointment and realized it was real- they had ZERO respect or consideration for our holiday traditions. I was flooded with memories of both hosting and being a guest for their cultural holidays, and the respect and curiosity I showed them. I realized this wasn’t just a misunderstanding or cultural difference- they are rude and don’t like or respect me or my family. 

I did my best to keep the peace and be polite to the houseguests, but I was devastated at the energy depletion from hosting them. I asked my husband to please take them all out Friday and leave me home to rest. I was looking forward to eating leftovers, but his family insisted on eating middle eastern food for the rest of the meals they had at our home, so I just made myself a big lunch that day binged on Hawaiian roll sandwiches while crying it out. 

I thought this would be the beginning of a yearly hosting tradition. I never want to do this again. ",3,1733033102.0,TrueOffMyChest,1,1.0,False
1h3wrgp,https://www.reddit.com/r/decaf/comments/1h3wrgp/decaf_or_nocaf/,Decaf or Nocaf?,"Hi everyone,

I’ve noticed that the term “decaf” can sometimes cause confusion (at least for me). Some use it to mean they drink decaffeinated coffee, while others use it to say they’ve quit caffeine entirely.

To make things clearer, how about we use:
	•	Decaf: For decaffeinated coffee (which does contain a little caffeine).
	•	Nocaf: For no caffeine at all.

This small distinction could make our conversations much easier to follow and more helpful for everyone in the group.

What do you all think?

I switched from regular coffee to decaf (Swiss Water Process) about four months ago, and it has been life-changing for my migraines. After suffering from migraines at least once a week for decades, they’ve basically disappeared. However, it hasn’t had much of an effect on my moderate, intermittent depression. I don’t drink much, perhaps 2 cups a day.

So now, I’ve decided to go completely “nocaf” to see if even the small amount of caffeine in decaf coffee might still be affecting me. Yesterday was my first day without caffeine and today I woke up really depressed. Gah. So it’s seems to do something …. Anyone with experience about this?

1h3wr72,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1h3wr72,Villains who actually care about their minions,"You know how bad guys treat their minions. They kill them because their morning coffee was a little too cool, they kill them if they fail their mission, heck, sometimes they kill them even if they did their jobs *correctly*. 

I like villains that go against the grain, they genuinely care about their mooks and get mad when someone that isn’t them messes with them. The main problem I have with this trope is that most examples wind up having redemption arcs and wind up becoming good guys. But there are some truly bad to the bone bad guys that still have a soft spot for their minions. Allow me to list a few examples.

1: Bowser from the Mario series: From what we see, Bowser may frequently get frustrated with his troops and call them idiots frequently, but he does legitimately care about their well-being, he gets mad when he finds out Fawful captured them, and there is no record in the games of him killing one or more of them for their incompetence. (In fact, the fact that they removed this trait from his character in The Super Mario Bros. Movie is one of my few complaints with that film).

2: Ursula from the Little Mermaid: Unlike Bowser, Ursula never even gets mad at her eels (who I’ve forgotten the names of, sorry), during her ‘Poor Unfortunate Souls’ song, she pets them like dogs, and she becomes thoroughly *outraged* when the heroes trick her into killing them.

3: I don’t actually know a lot about Arlecchino, but I do know that she cares about the orphans she keeps. Sorry about this one, because I’ve never played Genshin Impact, but I needed a third example of this trope otherwise the post would get taken down.",1,1733032992.0,TopCharacterTropes,2,0.67,False
1h3wqlv,https://www.reddit.com/r/mokapot/comments/1h3wqlv/community_review_and_update/,COMMUNITY REVIEW AND UPDATE,"Hi everyone,  
  
I wanna to take a moment on updating you all on what’s been happening over the past  
year and some exciting changes in our community and stuff that I've been hard on working  
on adding.  
  
As some of you may know, earlier this year, our subreddit was unfortunately hacked.  
Some accounts were compromised, and a few users were banned by Reddit as we   
reported them.   
  
I was given the role of moderator by spaceoverlord, the creator of this subreddit, since   
I was the one that was reporting the bots and users to reddit to get them out of this   
community during the hack or compromised accounts time, and they might have felt that   
I was the right user to be added to the moderator team,and for that reason I am really   
grateful to spaceoverlord for trusting me with this responsibility, and giving me the   
opportunity to help with in this community, and I’ve been working hard to restore   
everything and keep things moving in the right direction.  
  
I’m happy to say that things are steadily improving as we continue to recover from that incident.  
  
To celebrate our progress and encourage more engagement, I have been adding user flairs.   
  
These are little tags you can add to your profile to show off your interests  
or expertise and are only visible in this community.  
  
For example, I have the “Aluminum” tag, but you can pick something like “Collector”   
or “Vintage,” or anything that best represents your style. You do not need to add   
them if you feel that you would rather stay as a regular user, it's your own choice.   
  
I also added post flairs, which help us categorize posts and make it easier  
for everyone to find and engage with content. So if you're posting, be sure to choose   
a flair that matches the topic or just use discussions or question when posting your  
reddit stuff.    
  
Please Give us feedback on the flairs and if you want us to add a specific tag whether   
it's a user flair or post flair / tag.   
  
As our community grows, I just want to remind everyone that we’re all at different places in   
our moka pot journey. Some are new to moka pots, while others have been using them for   
years. Please be kind to those who are just starting out. If you see a question that seems   
basic or obvious to you but not the the new users, remember we’ve all been new to moka   
pots at one point.   
  
There’s no need to down vote or dismiss anyone’s question sometimes new users just need   
a little guidance.

It’s also important to be patient when waiting for responses. Everyone has their own stuff to   
do, and not all answers may fit your needs or question. Don’t hesitate to ask for clarification   
on the answer if you feel like you need it.

This space is all about sharing knowledge and supporting each other, so if you know the   
answer to someone’s question, please help out. It’s not about collecting karma points, but   
about helping others while learning and improving together.

Remember, you’re welcome to correct me if I share something that isn’t quite right. We’re   
all here to learn and improve our moka pot techniques, no matter our experience level.

When it comes to moka pots and brewing, there’s no one-size-fits-all approach. You don’t  
need the most expensive equipment to make great coffee. Whether you’re using a simple   
moka pot and grinder or high-end gadgets, it’s about finding what works for you and your   
lifestyle. Don’t feel pressured to buy fancy gear to enjoy delicious coffee.

Everyone’s setup is different—whether you prefer vintage moka pots or modern ones, or   
whether you’re on a budget or investing in premium gear. The beauty of this community   
is that there’s room for all types of setups, and what matters most is finding what works   
for you.

Not everyone has space for a large coffee setup or the budget for high end equipment,   
and that’s perfectly okay. Sometimes, the simplest setup is the best. All you need are the  
basic tools that fit your routine and lifestyle, and most importantly, to have fun with it.   
Brewing coffee should be an enjoyable experience, no matter what tools you’re using.  


Lastly I want to thank you all so much for being part of the moka pot community,   
whether you've been here since the beginning or you’re just discovering the joys of   
moka pots and found out there is a reddit community and decided to stay.  
  
I’m really excited about what’s to come and look forward to seeing more of your posts,  
questions, journey, and ideas that you might have with us all.

I really appreciate that you are engaging and interacting with us on our moka pot journeys  
or the posts we share, regardless of our experience level or the setup that we have.   
  
Whether it's with community members, others who share the same passion, or those who   
enjoy helping, we truly want to say thank you for becoming a member and for staying as   
long as you feel that this community has something that you can help or hang out,  
and share the same passion with like minded people on the topic of  moka pots .   
  
I hope you all the best on your next moka brewing session and this journey with your moka pot.

1h3wo52,https://www.reddit.com/r/AITAH/comments/1h3wo52/aitah_for_wanting_to_leave_for_the_weekend/,AITAH for wanting to leave for the weekend?,"There’s quite a back story, and it’s a rambling, my apologies. I’d rather give more info than not enough -

Basic setup on the upcoming weekend: in-laws are visiting first weekend of December. A big part of me wants to leave for the weekend to help them have a calm weekend together with their son (my husband) and their granddaughter (our daughter) and to help me not have a miserable weekend - but I can’t tell if it’s because I have become the A. 

2019 and earlier —

So up till 2019 I had a good relationship with my in-laws. Father-in-law is particularly kind, and leans into light puns and songs as regular conversation. Very pleasant, though not particularly deep in self-examination or social-examination. Can go a little bit into it if it is presented very concisely and shows general good logic and ethics, but generally just goes with the flow.  

Mother-in-law, we had been able to have some good discussions, and we both had seemed to be on similar pages of valuing family and having a fuller life outside of family as well. 

Mother-in-law, though I hadn’t experienced it personally at that point, could also get into cycles of negativity where she’ll focus on something negative and be unable to see past that or any other of the grey areas of what makes anything complex and hard to fully pin down. Mostly was focused on her husband’s family. I don’t have enough context to know whether this is fair, and without additional knowledge I have trusted her judgement because I have no real evidence else-wise. 

End of 2019 to early 2024 —

So to give additional context - husband and I moved across the country in 2012 to NM. Have been here since where we both got master’s degrees. In 2017 we founded a complex and demanding nonprofit. 

Nov 2019 in-laws came to visit us. During that visit they informed us they had decided to move to NM from OH, that MIL had been applying for jobs in our town, and during that visit they started looking for houses and choose a house. It felt a tad rushed, especially choosing a house over what was a weekend, and without really talking to my husband and I on locations or other advice. They had chosen a house right on BLM land where javelina (wild hogs), coyotes, and mountain lions and more are present. Someplace I would never feel comfortable living, and not somewhere I would recommend nearly life-long midwesterners to move to. But the decision was made before a chance for input could have been given. 

We had lived in NM without any other family for quite some time, so it was exciting to have family in town, especially being in our early 30s. We had wanted to start a family and thought our business was getting stable enough, that we had enough larger community support, and now with my husband’s parents moving into town, that we could have a child. 

In what may be a moment of me being an A, I had made the assumption that after so many conversations with MIL about family and us eventually wanting to have a kid or two, and her multiple statements of raising her kids as a stay-at-home-Mom was the best part of her life, and that she was so thankful for having both sets of grandparents in her life while raising children - I thought that part of their moving to town was in support of us starting a family. I recognize I didn’t expressly confirm this. Assumptions are a key Midwest culture - not great, I know. 

In-laws were due to move to NM in January of 2020. Husband and I decided Dec 2019 that it was time to try for a family, and we succeeded! Yay! Baby girl was set to eventually be born in Aug 2020. 

Y’all know what happened next, by March 2020 the world was locked down, I was very pregnant,  so husband and I isolated at home, just spending time with the in-laws, and we worked from home giving a lot of time and energy to keep our nonprofit going and keeping all of our employees. 

Tension was there in our dynamic of four adults (husband, MIL, FIL, myself) as the world was in chaos; what my husband and I thought was the stability of our nonprofit was ripped underneath us and we worked to keep it going which was stressful (including a fight with our city government after some unethical behaviors which we had to publicly call out and fight against till we eventually won); what was the removal of the larger community we thought we had built (both of my parents have passed, I have no siblings, and part of my decision to feel comfortable having kids was that we had a wide community of individuals who could be supportive because I saw my parents struggle without support and I didn’t want to be that stressed parent); and my MIL almost immediately having relationship issues at her new job. (Now that I think about it, she has always mentioned relationship issues at all of her jobs…). But it was expected for things to be hard and tense during a pandemic. 

August 2020 arrives, baby girl is healthy and wonderful! Everyone is happy!

Parenting takes it toil, disrupted sleep, parenting is way more demanding than husband or I expected. We quickly become sleep deprived. 

We had been regularly visiting in-laws for dinner on Sunday. We keep up with that. In-laws visited us a bit at our house when baby girl was first born, but MIL seemed uncomfortable at our house and fairly quickly seemed to only want to be with us at her home. (Admittedly I was not able to keep up with Midwest white lady expectations of clean-house - aka no dust, grime, clutter at all - and I pretty often fretted about not doing enough to keep MIL comfortable or happy.)

In the months following birth of baby girl it also became clear that it wasn’t just being a mother that was keeping me sleepless and exhausted - my lower back was locked and hips were fairly extensively out of alignment. I started going to physical therapy weekly as my insurance would allow it. 

So I was exhausted and hurting and frankly doing just enough to get by, which included going to Sunday dinner, and eventually when MIL decided to start taking baby girl Sunday afternoons, my husband and I would have 4-5 hours of deep house resetting before going to dinner. 

In the 4ish years they did Sunday dinner I think I missed maybe 8-10 dinners because I was either too sick / tired. And I skipped 2-3 dinners because I just wanted some alone time and that was the only time I got at home during those years. 

They watched baby girl on two of our anniversaries so we could have an evening out. 

There were multiple moments of either one of our families getting sick and isolating from the other. (Husband leads a project that a few dozen times a year has him travel and teach or coordinate teaching events, so there were moments he would come home sick, and there were just more moments where I was home alone with baby girl.)

In 2022, after vaccinations, we rejoined society and placed our daughter in a childcare program during the week. 8-5 M-Th, 8-12 F. MIL started picking up baby girl on Friday afternoons and then my husband or I would pick her up at 5. Which we had to be really careful to pick her up on time or we’d hear about it - which is fair and I understand her wanting boundaries, so we did our best, which was almost always, or within 10 minutes on the few occasions we didn’t. 

We did ask for a few evening coverings with childcare for moments we had higher workloads. I’d say about once a quarter. We also tried to intersperse our asks with another older friend in the neighborhood and a younger babysitter when they were available. 

Childcare for a newly emerged human meant she was sick a lot, and we had more moments we didn’t visit with in-laws to not get them sick, as we all would get sick. It was an incredibly exhausting time and my alignment and sleep issues were still terrible. By end of 2022 I was having tacacardia issues, and my doctor was sending me for testing and studies with a cardiologist. Additionally, pregnancy had made my allergies absolutely terrible, so I was also miserable with cold like symptoms all the time. 

Results came back from the cardiologist as nothing particularly wrong. After getting sick so many times the sinus doctor decided to remove my tonsils (they were huge -always a “wow” from doctors my whole life), and to also fix a deviated septum and just generally roto-route my sinuses. Surgery was May 2023.

That surgery in-laws took our daughter overnight for one night. That was the second time they had taken her overnight, and the last time. I respect that kids at night are hard and they need their sleep. 

It took about 2 weeks for me to recover from surgery, but the benefits were clear. I started feeling better, sleeping a little bit better, and the 4 allergy medicines I was on (am on) finally seemed to be working. Yes - not sick all the time, allergies finally under control, and the tacacardia issues finally were getting more under control. I honestly think I was utterly exhausting myself to death. 

I was still having sleep problems as the alignment issues with my hips were severe, and so I was still extremely tired. I kept up with PT and my doctor by fall 2023 put me on a muscle relaxer so I could sleep at night. The entry level muscle relaxer couldn’t get through, so I was on a pretty decent muscle relaxer that I only used at night to help me sleep. I used that for about 6-8 months where I think it really did a lot to help me finally rest enough for the PT to start working. 

During this time period MIL eventually was fired from her job, in I think early 2023, after an interpersonal issue went awry. She had finally been promoted to Director, something she had wanted in her career. I’m not sure if it was the employee being utterly unreasonable (which is likely because I heard from an outside source that he could often been unreasonable); whether it was MIL’s inexperience with a director role (there were moments when her responses to a negative things her employees did seemed out of proportion, especially given the pandemic turmoil to everyone - and given my own experience as a director and what I had seen work); whether it was cultural differences between a very intense Midwest, military work ethic and a more laid-back Southwest culture; or all of the above. But she was fired, mad, and bitter. Until she moved in early 2024 almost all she could talk about was how horrible her job had been, or how horrible NM is. For the rest of NM, it was how expensive things were (prices of everything increased after the pandemic, but she was convinced it was just NM); that healthcare wasn’t as good (she had similar issues with sinuses and back issues, but would never take my recommendations on doctors I had had success with, and didn’t like any of the results she had); that crime was bad (crime has statistically raised everywhere since the pandemic); and that she couldn’t make friends (she had tried a local garden group and one lady she met at an art supply store but didn’t like them, and for years I tried getting her involved with multiple community groups in her interests that she would never attend). 

During the muscle relaxer period, along with having not felt good for a long time, and some extreme challenges at work, I was pretty depressed and had lost a lot of confidence in my ability to lead. I was actively looking to step down from work because my health was still just so poor and I felt so unable to do the quick-thinking work my position needed. 

Early 2024 MIL states at dinner that she is utterly miserable, is upset we don’t spend more time with her, and wants to know what we are doing with our lives. Like, rather explosively over dinner. At that moment I was deep in my debate to leave my position at work, but because of how new it was, and that I really prefer thinking things through before making announcements, I didn’t feel comfortable talking about it. She asked if I thought she would judge me - which I automatically replied “yes” because she does judge people a lot, and while I had trusted her a great deal over the years, she hadn’t shown herself to be very empathetic. She was immediately upset. FIL just left the chat and walked out of the room, he can’t handle conflict, and husband went to explaining we are talking about things but haven’t made any decisions yet. The conversation basically ended at that point, with tensions clearly high. 

Hearing that she felt she didn’t have enough time together, that next weekend (Sat) I planned for MIL and I to go out for a late morning coffee with time to relax and chat. Having more time, I told her I was thinking of leaving my position because I felt so incapable after so many health issues, and just the incredible difficulty of parenting and running a nonprofit. She seemed to vaguely approve of the notion, and emphasized she’s worried about us financially. We had never really talked finances with her before, they had never asked, we had not offered. So I told her we were ok. We don’t make a lot of money, but because of where we live, the money that had come through them from her father had been used to fully pay for our house making our money expenses very affordable. We’re also in a quite affordable part of the country. We are low-income and have smaller than we would like retirement accounts, but we have more than 6 months of savings and we are very careful with our purchases. We only buy things that last, and tend to hold off on purchases unless necessary, or for the two hobbies (one for each of us) that at this point we each get about 2 hours for each week. We cook at home, pack lunches, don’t go out to buy coffee. Drive cars to the ground. We’re ok being lower income because we don’t want a lot, and we value more having careers in things we care about. They have been upper middle class their whole lives, and I think there is a great deal of anxiety for MIL on having enough money, even when they arguably have enough. 

Now some other considerations here, especially with this consideration around the anxiety of money. MIL was not able to get another job and so has been just at home since the 2023 firing. She feels a great obligation to financially provide though FIL makes more than enough, and they have a great deal in savings and stocks. But my husband is one of two kids. My husband’s brother and his wife live in San Diego. Like San Diego proper. He works in tech, and after some ups and downs in jobs, in 2022/23 had finally gotten a good job that looked stable and they decided to buy a house. For the same amount from my husband’s grandfather’s inheritance that was able to fully purchase our house, it was the down payment + for brother-in-law’s duplex half. Fall 2023 brother-in-law was let go from his tech job. Whether due to a lack of savings (him and his wife always have new clothes, furniture, cars, eat out) or whether MIL has a deep sense of obligation for care, it turns out she and FIL have been paying the mortgage on the San Diego home. I don’t know all the details, how much or how long, and I am guessing since he was laid off. He didn’t get a new job till summer 2024, and has now been laid off again after like 2 months. 

So… back to the coffee. I explain we’re ok. We don’t have a lot financially but we’re ok, and while I was feeling still doubtful about work, we have been working hard to find more income through our work (which we did - we started as a fully volunteer based organization to today where we employee 18 people including ourselves). I also invited her to be with me at home more while I cook or clean. I made it clear for tiny bit of socializing I do have, it’s usually someone sitting at the kitchen table while I do chores. She mentions her mother used to do that for her. 

We go to dinner the next day (Sun) and she announces they have decided to move. They want to leave within 2-5 years. MIL emphasizes this is the hardest decision because of granddaughter but she is convinced she cannot get enough healthcare, that there is too much crime, it’s too expensive, and she is too lonely and can’t make friends. Ok - that is their decision, I get it, 2-5 years is plenty of time. Our 3.5 year old will still have more time with her grandparents, husband and I will still have support during the last few tough years of young child rearing. 

I try to plan more weekend coffee time, even buying some embroidery kits for us to work on so it can be a casual enjoyable time. She likes textiles, and wanted to really honor that she said we didn’t have enough time together and address it. I also invite her to the house multiple times for moments when I’ll either be cooking or cleaning, asking if she and FIL would like to stay for dinner. They decline each time. 

Two weeks later MIL announces they have put an offer on a half-million dollar house they have never seen. They will be leaving in a matter of weeks to months. MIL states that she doesn’t know what she could have done with me and that “while I didn’t think I could be like a mother to you, I had hoped I could have been like an aunt.” I’m shocked by the statement, still don’t fully understand. I thought I had been quite open about my experiences and thoughts until that one time I was demanded to give plans immediately for something I hadn’t fully formed into full thoughts yet; and that I had really listened to her advice. I thought we had a good MIL / DIL relationship. I know it was the pandemic years and then the pandemic blowout afterwards, with a baby and poor health, but I had done what I could to be present every week. No other individual in our lives saw us every week outside of actual work. We actually only saw friends maybe a dozen times outside of our home during that time 4 years, and mostly in shifts, so one parent stayed home while the other went out. 

We get through the evening well enough, but in reflection I started getting upset. And talking with friends and my aunt I start hearing other things. First, two of my friends, granted individuals who are more in touch with their anger which can sometimes bite them in the butts, straight up said MIL hasn’t treated me with respect for years and they haven’t liked her but didn’t say anything because MIL has lived in town and what good would it have done to say anything. They mention her general attitude towards me, that MIL at dinners had started seating me to the side of the table though everyone else was centered with one another, had on the couple of occasions said she we watch for a friend event pulled out of watching baby girl last minute for her own events, and had repeatedly shown disrespect by doing things like introducing tv after we had chosen not to, introducing candy before we planned to, consistently given juice as a drink although I had wanted to not give juice, and doing things like starting large house improvement projects at our house without asking (which some didn’t end well and we’ll have to spend thousands to fix) which also took up almost every longer holiday period even when we were clearly communicating exhaustion. Another friend who is just a good, kind human, someone around the same age of MIL and who had also been a stay-at-home mom, someone I had hoped could be friends with MIL, communicated that MIL just consistently talked in disparaging ways of wishing MIL was a better person like my friend or me, and that a sense of jealousy could never be broken through enough to get to know her. This friend also communicated that MIL seemed disrespectful to me and unreliable as MIL would often pull out of the normal Fri or Sun plans on short notice for events or very short notice vacations. 

Lastly, and the one that hurts the most is from my aunt. Nearly in her 80s, a sweet woman who has been like a second mother to me many times in life - someone who worked tireless to keep her siblings and their families together even through multiple hard circumstances, and the most positive person I know (to the point I get annoyed at how unrealistic is it), she told me of some hard things. Most of it was centered on an award and recognition I had received from the university I had gotten my masters at. My aunt and uncle (also in his 80s) travelled from the Midwest to see this award ceremony. In the moments I wasn’t at the award table my aunt told me that MIL was saying this was so much more about the effort her son had done than I had done (which I want to be absolutely clear, I could not have done it without him and am extremely grateful to him for having gone through this together and have checked multiple times with him whether he really wants to continue in this path). My aunt said that basically every time I wasn’t there MIL was saying how it should have been her son getting the recognition and that I hadn’t done enough. It was enough that my uncle, a very mild mannered human, didn’t want to see her anymore that trip. My aunt mentioned that in the moments she was not disparaging me, she was disparaging the local people in rather racist ways. And that these negative things weren’t just what she said to her, but she was saying to everyone who came near. We run our nonprofit in this town, so it hurts she would say such hurtful things, both personally and professionally as we both still work for this nonprofit. I want to make it also clear - I absolutely recognize I couldn’t have done it alone, especially without my husband who also worked countless unpaid hours when we first started. And I also want to make it clear, I’ve worked hard for this nonprofit. I had started researching and planning for this nonprofit back in 2009. Every major decision I made (beyond getting married to my partner) until we decided to have a daughter in 2019 was made with the idea of whether it would help the nonprofit. The “funding” that made the nonprofit possible came from my Dad dying from medical negligence and I used the monthly annuity to support us while we started the nonprofit. Starting this nonprofit is absolutely work my husband and I did together, but it also comes from a place of tragic loss, and the positive action I wanted to come from that loss. I was completely clear with my husband on our first official date what I wanted to do and where I wanted to move to. I’ve also regularly checked in with him to make sure this life path was the right one for him. I deeply appreciate him wanting to also do good for society, and I deeply appreciated being recognized for something I had worked 14 years for, something that has helped tens of thousands of people since its opening in 2018. 

It hurt that her response was jealousy and bitterness. And I get it too, her son did amazing grant writing and program work that made our nonprofit possible. And I acknowledged him, our team, our volunteers, my parent-in-laws, and even my parents role - and I leaned in hard that major accomplishments are possible when communities come together. Something I deeply believe. 

Mid 2024 to now —

After the house purchase announcement things went quickly. They left town for a month in Ireland and then came home for several weeks of intense packing and getting their NM home show ready. Friday pickups stopped which made sense because they had a lot of packing to do. They stopped spending time with our daughter most Sunday afternoons, but we kept with Sunday dinners, and while I felt upset I didn’t say much because my daughter has adored her grandmother. 

When they left town in April, in what had been unclear notice till they said we are leaving tomorrow morning, my daughter was devastated. Personally, I felt hurt from the terrible things said behind my back, I felt hurt from the lack of support with our daughter (which I readily admit I had no guarantee of and should have no expectation of - though I did / do feel annoyed for her saying how she had two sets of grandparents that regularly helped them more days a week then she ever did for us), and I felt hurt that it had seemed like I had disappointed her as a DIL but can’t pin down how. What hurt the worst though was my daughter’s grief. It was the four of us adults and our daughter. This was her family. Two of them decided to move across the country. At less than 4 years old I couldn’t really explain. My daughter brought them up everyday for months.

By the end of the summer my daughter started stabilizing, and even my husband and I were starting to do better as I was starting to get the space I needed to feel ok, and both of us were finally getting a little bit of rest on Sundays as we’re actually more stay-in type of people and didn’t realize how much the weekly dinner out, and the high house cleaning expectations we were trying to maintain for MIL were further exhausting us. 

I started planning mid-summer for a fun birthday for our daughter to help her feel special and loved, and had started working about 2 months out with plans and decorations. 

About a month from daughter’s birthday MIL told us they were coming out for our daughter’s fourth birthday. Ok, makes sense, it’s their only granddaughter. 

But I started getting mad soon after. Like, after our daughter finally started letting go of grieving them leaving, they are going to show up for a single weekend and reignite this grief. And it’s hard because there is a legitimate idea for them to regularly visit, but then I question how much is it guilt about moving, because honestly I don’t think MIL actually enjoys grandparenting much, because there were often complaints about the time they had been together 

And - I want to recognize with the most grace I can - a person deserves the ability to find where they are happy and safe. MIL didn’t feel happy or safe here. MIL doesn’t like kids as much as she thought - great, I’m glad you’re figuring things out. And I think I’m a sore spot because I’ve been more self reflective. I readily admit parenting can be hard and I don’t always like it. I succeeded at being a Director when she didn’t. I was recognized for something when her son, her honestly brilliant son, whom they invested deeply into as upper middle class humans (while my family growing up were lower middle class with a lot of issues), did not receive the same recognition - though he has received many other forms of recognition from others. I succeeded at being able to move and adapt in a new culture and make friends. She didn’t. But I also felt like she self-sabatouzed so many opportunities to make it better while in NM. And I also think she is honestly freaked out about money. In reflecting about the home they purchased - ostensibly for MIL and FIL - it is a 6 bedroom house, multiple stories. 4,000 sq/ft! Like huge! Getting to retirement age with a 4,000 sq/ft house, I think MIL thinks both of her sons are going to fail at life and move themselves and their families back in with them. Like - jiminy, that’s hard! Like what a weight to carry on yourself. And I think she is frustrated that we keep doing the hard work of a nonprofit instead of finding more stable lucrative work (like the tech industry that has so worked out for the other son. I do feel bad for him, he’s tried the conventional “it’ll be secure and lucrative”, and looked the part, and he has faced more lay offs then anyone I know.)

And I also want to make it clear. These have been a rough 4 years for me, I was not the cheeriest person. The pandemic sucked. Parenting was harder than I had expected. The stability of our nonprofit was harder than I thought it would be due to the pandemic. Work was harder than I thought it would be. Health was way worse than I would have guessed for my mid 30s. And I communicated my struggles with MIL, thinking it was a way to connect. A way to be honest. And I’m afraid it’s just seen as a weakest, that I made the wrong decision in this career path for both myself and my husband. Balance is not a trait myself or my husband come by easily, but we’ve been trying. And I think we’ve never espoused the same values of outside “put togetherness” and wealth as MIL, and have instead choosen values aligning with self reflection, social good, deep kindness, and truth. 

And so they came for the birthday. And I tried to keep myself busy with the birthday readiness, and cooking dinners, and I was still upset. At meals I would just not talk. There was nothing I could say in honesty that felt like I could be truthful and not have it turned against me behind my back or have me actually talk about my hurt in an inappropriate place to someone I think isn’t going to care. At one point in the weekend I got so tired of it all I said I didn’t feel good (which I honestly mentally did not), and started isolating. I cooked dinners for the family, ate with them, but then went to our bedroom to isolate. In one of the moments when I was working in the kitchen MIL yelled at me whether I was mad at her - let me tell you, this reminds me of my unstable, yelling mother so much. I lied, I hate lying, but I lied and said everything was fine. I know I wasn’t fine, but for the life of me I don’t want a yelling match, especially with my daughter in the house. I’ve lost my trust that she honestly cares. I had a miserable weekend outside of the deep bonding moments of my daughter’s birthday that I had planned months for. 

I also want to put it out there, I may have expected too much out of life and those around me and may have been TA for a long time. 

The choice —

And now - after this summer when MIL said they would not spend Christmas this year with us (a bit rude, but which was a real relief to me and so I decided to just take it as overly direct communication, though that usually isn’t her thing), they asked for an early Dec or Jan time to visit. We said early Dec, then last week, they asked to visit over Christmas (I think they had planned for their other son to visit them in the Midwest and with him being laid off again I think BIL and wife said they couldn’t visit). And bless my husband, he said “no” so we can truly rest. My favorite week of the year is between Christmas and New Year’s where I can be in my pjs for a week and talk to no one outside of my immediate family. I haven’t done that since 2018. So we agreed on the first weekend of Dec for them to visit. 

So they are planning to visit first weekend in Dec. I’m still hurt, and I didn’t have a good time when they were last here, and I know my tension came out and I’m afraid it’ll come out into something explosive again. (I am admittedly not great once I get upset. I’ve held it mostly together, but I’m not a good liar.)

Am I the A for wanting to leave for the weekend? I have only been gone 3 nights once for work related activities / to see a friend since my daughter has been born. Mostly because I know my already tired husband would be even more drained if I left for a weekend away (hasn’t even crossed my mind till this in-law moment of maybe I should leave.) But with the in-laws in town, daughter will mostly be attached to them while they are here and then my husband would only really have to deal with mornings and going to bed. I could have a real weekend away, doing some activities I am really excited for. And I wouldn’t risk my hurt feelings coming out and souring things. The rest of them are ok. It’s me and MIL. 

I know it risks further polluting the waters, especially after just telling them “no” to the on-the-holiday visit. But I am also truly worried about making the visit miserable for all by just being there. I think no matter what I do MIL is going to be upset at me: she’ll either go off or I’ll go off if I am there; or she’s going to feel hurt and say bad things about me not being there and it being rude. Though I’m pretty sure she is consistently saying mean things behind my back anyway.

These days it was my high school graduation party and I was excited. In preparation for the party I was super stressed, acting impatient and even rude to family members. I was very insecure about my look for that fancy party and it took me a while to get ready, I think these were factors that contributed to my stress. Even in the middle of and after the party I continue like this, I think because I'm unaccustomed to the type of clothing and the act of dressing up a lot, I feel inferior to others.
At one point during the party I was super tired, exhausted in mind and body. I had 3 cups of coffee and my spirits returned. It was an open bar, I think I had about 4 drinks, but it was the last two that finished me off (lol).
I felt extremely happy and drunk, dancing with my friends. It was super cool.
The point is that there is a boy who had been hitting on me for weeks, with whom I sometimes talked and kind of ""gave him a fuck"". He spoke to me at the beginning of the party and at another time, at the party, he made it very clear that he wanted to be with me. Anyway, during the dance, almost at the end of the party, he asked me to kiss him.
I, BVL, was scared to death of kissing, you know, because I didn't know what to do. But I was so drunk that I just went along with it.
Anyway, I think it was a decent kiss (among other extra details), but I didn't feel horny at all, you know... My friend said it could have been, in addition to not liking him that way, because of the alcohol. It was clearly strange, but I think normal. He was a very experienced guy who commanded everything (lol). I just know that afterwards I felt a little strange, sla, but I was happy to have finally kissed him.
My mother knows him from before and even saw me giving him a kiss. And we thought it was funny. But now, the next day, after having only had two hours of sleep (7 to 9), I felt an unbearable guilt and indecency, in addition to hating the general situation. I don't know, maybe I wanted to prove something to someone? I usually do things that I completely agree with internally, that I feel in my soul, I don't know... I just know that I feel emptiness and shame about the situation and that this comes internally, not because of what other people told me. Maybe it has something to do with fear of intimacy and my own prejudices, and also with the emotional changes caused by drinking (ups and downs, I don't know). I even got to have a really nice conversation with the guy afterwards. Anyway, I would like to better identify this feeling and understand its causes.",1,1733032114.0,Emotions,0,1.0,False

Job hunting can feel like a daunting expedition, full of twists and turns. Whether you’re fresh out of college or looking to switch careers, the journey to landing your dream job requires strategy, persistence, and creativity. The good news? There are countless tips and tricks that can help you navigate this tricky terrain with confidence.  
  
Imagine waking up each day excited about what lies ahead in your career. With the right approach, that dream can become your reality. From setting clear goals to mastering the art of interviews, every step counts in securing a position that aligns with both your passions and skills.  
  
Ready to supercharge your job search? Dive into these 50 practical job hunting tips designed to equip you for success in today’s competitive market!

# Tip 1: Set clear career goals.

Setting clear career goals is the foundation of your job search. Without them, you might find yourself wandering aimlessly through a sea of opportunities.  
  
Start by reflecting on what truly excites you in your professional life. Identify specific roles or industries that spark your passion and align with your skills. This clarity will guide your job-hunting efforts.  
  
Write down these goals to make them tangible. Break them into short-term and long-term objectives, which can help keep you motivated along the way.  
  
Regularly revisit and adjust these goals as needed. The job market is constantly evolving, and being adaptable will ensure you remain on track toward landing that dream role.

# Tip 2: Research industries and roles that align with your strengths.

Understanding your strengths is a powerful tool in job hunting. It shapes the industries and roles you should consider.  
  
Start by making a list of what you’re good at. Are you great with people? Do numbers make sense to you? Identifying these skills will guide your research.  
  
Next, explore industries that value those strengths. For instance, if you’re an excellent communicator, fields like marketing or public relations might be ideal for you.  
  
Don’t ignore roles within those sectors. Look for specific positions that match not just your skills but also spark your interest.  
  
Reading about different career paths can help clarify what resonates with you most. Websites, blogs, and forums are treasure troves of information about various jobs and their demands.  
  
Take time to reflect on how each role aligns with who you are as an individual. This alignment creates a more fulfilling work life ahead.

# Tip 3: Create a structured job-hunting schedule.

Creating a structured job-hunting schedule can transform your search from chaotic to productive. Start by allocating specific time blocks each day dedicated solely to your job hunt.  
  
Map out tasks like researching companies, customizing resumes, or networking. This focused approach keeps you organized and ensures no aspect is overlooked.  
  
Include breaks in your schedule to recharge. Burnout can creep up unexpectedly when searching for that dream position.  
  
Be flexible but disciplined. If something urgent arises, adjust your plan without losing sight of the overall goal.  
  
Track progress weekly to celebrate small wins and identify areas needing improvement. A visual reminder helps maintain motivation.  
  
Staying consistent with a routine makes the process feel less overwhelming and more manageable as you navigate through applications and interviews on the path to landing that desired role.

# Tip 4: Tailor your resume and cover letter to each job application.

Crafting a generic resume and cover letter is tempting, but it rarely leads to success. Each job application deserves your unique touch.  
  
Start by analyzing the job description closely. Highlight key skills and phrases that resonate with your experience. Incorporating these elements into your documents shows employers you understand their needs.  
  
Your resume should reflect relevant achievements tailored to the role you’re applying for. Use metrics where possible to demonstrate impact—numbers speak volumes.  
  
When writing your cover letter, address the hiring manager directly if possible. Share specific examples from past experiences that align with what they’re seeking. This personal connection can set you apart from other candidates.  
  
Remember, a customized approach not only showcases your qualifications but also demonstrates genuine interest in the position and company culture.

# Tip 5: Identify and focus on your unique selling points.

Understanding your unique selling points (USPs) can set you apart in a competitive job market. Your USPs are the skills, experiences, and qualities that make you an ideal candidate for specific roles.  
  
Begin by reflecting on your strengths. What do you excel at? It could be technical skills, leadership abilities, or even soft skills like communication. Write these down.  
  
Next, consider feedback from colleagues and mentors. They might highlight attributes you overlook in yourself. This external perspective can reveal valuable insights.  
  
Once you’ve identified your USPs, weave them into your resume and cover letters. Use concrete examples to demonstrate how these traits have benefited past employers or projects.  
  
Use them during interviews to showcase what makes you uniquely qualified for the position. Remember: it’s about highlighting what sets you apart while aligning with the company’s needs.

# Tip 6: Keep an open mind about new industries or roles.

When job hunting, it’s easy to feel pigeonholed into a specific industry or role. However, keeping an open mind can lead you to unexpected opportunities.  
  
Consider industries that might not align with your background but resonate with your interests. A skills transfer is often more achievable than you think. Many employers value fresh perspectives and diverse experiences.  
  
Networking plays a crucial part here. Engaging conversations can unveil roles you hadn’t considered before. You might discover passions or talents waiting just beneath the surface.  
  
Moreover, being adaptable showcases your willingness to learn and grow—a trait many companies seek in candidates. Embrace the unknown; it could unlock doors to your dream career path that you’ve yet to explore. Don’t shy away from stepping outside of familiar territory; sometimes the best adventures begin where comfort zones end.

# Tip 7: Build a list of target companies.

Creating a focused list of target companies is a strategic approach to your job search. Start by identifying industries that excite you and align with your skills. This clarity helps narrow down potential employers.  
  
Next, consider company culture and values. Are they in line with what you envision for yourself? Research organizations renowned for their positive work environments or innovative practices.  
  
Utilize online resources like Glassdoor, LinkedIn, or industry-specific forums to gather insights about these companies. Pay attention to employee reviews and any recent news that could impact hiring.  
  
After compiling your list, prioritize it based on factors such as growth opportunities and alignment with your career goals. This allows you to channel energy into applications where you’re most likely to thrive. Networking within these targeted firms can also open doors—reach out through LinkedIn or attend industry events related to them.

# Tip 8: Understand the job market trends in your area.

Understanding the job market trends in your area is crucial for effective job hunting. Start by analyzing local economic conditions. Are businesses expanding or downsizing? This can significantly influence hiring patterns.  
  
Next, explore which industries are thriving. Tech, healthcare, and renewable energy may have more opportunities compared to others. Local chambers of commerce often publish reports that highlight these trends.  
  
Networking plays a key role as well. Engage with professionals in your field through LinkedIn or community events to gain insights into what skills employers currently seek.  
  
Don’t overlook seasonal fluctuations either; certain jobs might be abundant at specific times of the year based on demand cycles. Staying informed allows you to adapt your strategy and target roles where competition might be less intense.  
  
By keeping an eye on these dynamics, you’ll position yourself more effectively within the evolving landscape of employment opportunities around you.

# Tip 9: Set a weekly quota for job applications and networking outreach.

Establishing a weekly quota for job applications and networking outreach can significantly enhance your job search efficiency. By setting specific targets, you create a clear focus that transforms the overwhelming process into manageable tasks.  
  
Start by deciding how many jobs you want to apply for each week. Whether it’s three or ten, stick to your goal. This structure keeps you accountable and motivated.  
  
Networking is equally crucial. Aim to connect with a certain number of professionals in your field each week. Reach out through LinkedIn messages, emails, or even phone calls. Every connection counts and could lead to new opportunities.  
  
Track your progress using a simple spreadsheet or journal. Celebrate small wins along the way; they build momentum and keep spirits high during what can sometimes feel like an arduous journey toward landing that dream role.

# Tip 10: Stay persistent and motivated despite setbacks.

Job hunting can feel like a rollercoaster ride. One moment you’re excited about a promising lead, and the next, you’re facing rejection. It’s easy to let setbacks dampen your spirits.  
  
Persistence is key in this process. Each “no” brings you one step closer to that elusive “yes.” Embrace each rejection as an opportunity for growth. Reflect on what went wrong and adjust your approach accordingly.  
  
Staying motivated during tough times requires self-care. Take breaks when needed, celebrate small victories, and surround yourself with supportive people who uplift you. Engage in activities that bring joy outside of your job search.  
  
Remember why you’re pursuing a new role in the first place—whether it’s career advancement or personal fulfillment. Keep those goals front and center; they will fuel your determination through challenges ahead. Every effort counts toward landing that dream job you’ve been working so hard for!

# Tip 11: Use major job boards (e.g., LinkedIn, Indeed).

When diving into the job market, major job boards are your best friends. Websites like LinkedIn and Indeed aggregate thousands of listings in one place, saving you time and effort.  
  
On these platforms, you can filter jobs by location, industry, or even company size. This makes it easier to find positions that match your skills and experience. Plus, many roles allow you to apply directly through the site.  
  
Networking is also a key benefit. On LinkedIn especially, recruiters often reach out to candidates who have relevant profiles and experiences that catch their eye. Keeping your profile updated increases your chances of being noticed.  
  
Don’t forget about alerts! Set up notifications for new postings matching your criteria so you’re always among the first applicants when opportunities arise. Remember: staying proactive is essential in today’s competitive landscape.

**Indeed’s Job Search Tips**: Offers actionable advice on creating standout resumes, preparing for interviews, and following up with potential employers. Visit their blog for detailed tips. [Learn from Indeed](https://www.indeed.com/)

# Tip 12: Check niche job sites for specialized roles.

When searching for specialized roles, mainstream job boards might not cut it. Niche job sites cater specifically to unique industries or professions, giving you an edge in your hunt.  
  
These platforms often host listings that larger sites overlook. By focusing on specific sectors—like tech, healthcare, or creative fields—you can discover opportunities tailored to your skills and interests.  
  
Additionally, niche sites typically attract employers looking to find candidates with particular expertise. This means less competition and a higher chance of landing interviews.  
  
Don’t forget the power of industry-specific forums and communities online. They often share exclusive job openings before they even hit major websites.  
  
Embrace these resources as part of your strategy; they are essential tools in finding that dream position you’ve been after!

# Tip 13: Follow company career pages for updates.

Following company career pages is a crucial step in your job hunting journey. Companies often post their latest openings directly on these platforms, giving you first access to available roles.  
  
By regularly checking these pages, you can stay informed about new opportunities that match your skills and interests. This proactive approach allows you to apply early, increasing your chances of being noticed by hiring managers.  
  
Additionally, company career pages often provide insights into the organization’s culture and values. You’ll gain a better understanding of what it’s like to work there, helping you tailor your application materials effectively.  
  
Don’t forget to sign up for notifications if the option is available. This way, you’ll receive alerts straight to your inbox whenever there’s an update on new positions or events. It keeps you ahead in the competitive job market while showcasing your genuine interest in specific companies.

# Tip 14: Sign up for job alerts.

Job alerts can be a game-changer in your job search strategy. By signing up for these notifications, you stay informed about new opportunities as soon as they arise.  
  
Most major job boards and company websites offer this feature. You simply input your preferences—keywords, location, or even salary ranges. Then, the system does the work for you.  
  
Imagine receiving daily or weekly emails tailored to your career aspirations. This proactive approach saves time and ensures you don’t miss out on positions that might be a perfect fit.  
  
Plus, it allows you to tailor your applications more effectively. With timely insights into openings, you’re empowered to craft customized resumes and cover letters that resonate with potential employers right when they’re looking at candidates.  
  
Embrace technology; let it enhance your job hunting process!

# Tip 15: Leverage staffing agencies and recruiters.

Staffing agencies and recruiters can be valuable allies in your job search. They have connections with multiple companies and often know about openings before they’re publicly advertised.  
  
When you partner with a recruiter, you’re tapping into their expertise. These professionals understand the nuances of various industries and can help match your skills to suitable roles.  
  
Additionally, many staffing agencies specialize in specific fields. This means they could find opportunities tailored precisely to your background or interests.  
  
Don’t hesitate to reach out and establish a relationship with these experts. Share your career goals clearly so that they can advocate for you effectively.  
  
Remember, working with a recruiter is not just about getting interviews; it’s also an opportunity for feedback on how to strengthen your application materials.

# Tip 16: Attend local and virtual career fairs.

Attending career fairs, whether local or virtual, is a powerful way to connect with potential employers. These events gather numerous companies under one roof—or online platform—making it easier for job seekers to explore multiple opportunities.  
  
Local fairs offer the chance for face-to-face interactions. You can engage in meaningful conversations and make memorable impressions on recruiters. Bringing printed resumes can also set you apart during these encounters.  
  
On the other hand, virtual career fairs provide flexibility. They often allow for more extensive participation without geographical limitations. You can chat via video calls or messaging platforms from the comfort of your home.  
  
Don’t forget to prepare beforehand! Research participating companies and have thoughtful questions ready. This preparation demonstrates genuine interest and helps you stand out among many candidates vying for attention at these bustling events.

# Tip 17: Explore government and non-profit job portals.

Government and non-profit job portals can be goldmines for job seekers. These platforms often list roles that you might not find on typical job boards. Positions in public service, education, or community outreach offer unique opportunities to make a difference.  
  
Navigating these sites may feel different at first. Government jobs usually require specific applications and qualifications. Pay close attention to the details outlined in each listing.  
  
Non-profit organizations also have their own set of requirements but often value passion and commitment over extensive experience. Many of these roles are deeply rewarding, allowing you to contribute to causes you’re passionate about.  
  
Regularly check these portals as new positions arise frequently. Setting up alerts can help you stay informed without constant searching. Whether your goal is stability or making an impact, exploring government and non-profit avenues could lead you closer to your dream role.

# Tip 18: Utilize college alumni networks and job boards.

Tapping into your college alumni network can open doors you didn’t even know existed. Alumni often share job leads, provide mentorship, and offer invaluable insights about their industries. They understand the challenges of breaking into a field because they’ve been there.  
  
Many universities maintain dedicated job boards where employers specifically look for graduates from that institution. These postings can be tailored to suit your skills and background. It’s an underutilized resource that could lead to unique opportunities.  
  
Connect with former classmates through social media platforms or alumni events. Foster those relationships; they might just become your biggest advocates in the hiring process.  
  
Don’t underestimate the power of shared experience—alumni networks thrive on camaraderie and support, making them a rich source for job hunting tips and potential referrals.

# Tip 19: Look for freelance or contract work as a stepping stone.

Freelance or contract work can be a game changer in your job search. It opens doors to new opportunities while allowing you to gain valuable experience.  
  
Think of it as a way to showcase your skills without the long-term commitment. You get to build your portfolio and expand your professional network simultaneously.  
  
Plus, many companies offer freelance roles that can lead to permanent positions if you impress them with your work ethic and results. These gigs often provide flexibility, enabling you to explore different industries before settling on one.  
  
Don’t underestimate the power of freelancing; it’s not just about earning money. It’s about learning, adapting, and positioning yourself favorably for future roles when you’re ready for that dream job.

# Tip 20: Explore social media platforms for job postings.

Social media is a treasure trove for job seekers. Platforms like Twitter, Facebook, and Instagram often post job openings that you won’t find on traditional job boards.  
  
Follow companies in your field of interest. Many organizations share updates about career opportunities directly on their pages. Engaging with these posts can also give you an inside look at company culture.  
  
Join relevant groups or communities focused on your industry. These spaces frequently feature members sharing job leads, tips, and resources to help each other succeed.  
  
Don’t overlook hashtags! Searching phrases like #jobopening or #hiring can lead to hidden gems and exciting prospects in real-time.  
  
Remember to maintain a professional online presence. Employers often check candidates’ social profiles before making hiring decisions, so ensure yours reflects the image you want to project.

# Tip 21: Update and optimize your LinkedIn profile.

Your LinkedIn profile is often your first impression on potential employers. Make it count by updating it regularly.  
  
Start with a professional photo that reflects your personality yet maintains professionalism. A friendly smile can make a difference.  
  
Next, optimize the headline and summary sections. Use keywords relevant to your industry and roles you’re pursuing. This makes you more discoverable to recruiters looking for talent like yours.  
  
Showcase your skills prominently. Endorsements from colleagues lend credibility, so don’t hesitate to ask for them.  
  
Add rich media such as presentations or videos showcasing your work achievements; this adds depth and personality to your profile.  
  
Stay active on the platform by sharing insights related to your field. Engaging with content not only demonstrates expertise but also expands your network organically.

# Tip 22: Join LinkedIn groups relevant to your field.

Joining LinkedIn groups can be a game changer in your job search journey. These communities are filled with professionals who share your interests and fields of expertise.  
  
Participating in discussions allows you to showcase your knowledge. You can ask questions, provide insights, and engage with thought leaders. This visibility can attract potential employers or collaborators.  
  
Groups also serve as a valuable resource for job leads. Many companies post openings exclusively within these networks. By being active, you increase your chances of hearing about opportunities before they hit major job boards.  
  
Networking is another huge advantage. Connecting with group members expands your reach beyond immediate contacts. You never know where that next referral might come from, so don’t shy away from initiating conversations!

# Tip 23: Attend professional meetups and events.

Attending professional meetups and events can be a game changer in your job search. These gatherings provide unique opportunities to network with industry peers and potential employers.  
  
The casual setting fosters genuine connections. Conversations can lead to insights about unadvertised job openings or company culture that you won’t find online.  
  
Moreover, engaging with speakers or panelists allows you to learn from their experiences. You may even discover mentors who can guide you through your career journey.  
  
Don’t underestimate the power of face-to-face interactions; they often leave lasting impressions. Bring along business cards for easy networking, and follow up afterward to keep those connections alive.  
  
Whether local or virtual, these events are invaluable resources in expanding your professional circle while enhancing your visibility in the field you’re passionate about.

# Tip 24: Reconnect with former colleagues and mentors.

Reconnecting with former colleagues and mentors can be a game-changer in your job search. These individuals know your skills, work ethic, and potential firsthand. They can provide insights into opportunities that may not be posted publicly.  
  
Start by reaching out through LinkedIn or email. A simple message expressing interest in their current role or sharing updates about your job search is often well-received. People appreciate being remembered.  
  
Ask for advice on navigating the industry or even tips specific to certain companies. Their experiences can offer valuable guidance as you explore new paths.  
  
Don’t hesitate to suggest a coffee chat or virtual meeting if they’re open to it. Genuine conversations help rekindle relationships and keep you top of mind when they hear about openings within their networks.  
  
Remember, connections are powerful assets in the professional world—nurture them!

# Tip 25: Inform your personal network about your job search.

Your personal network can be a game-changer in your job search. Friends, family, and former colleagues often have insights or connections that can open doors for you.  
  
Don’t hesitate to share your goals with them. A casual conversation over coffee might lead to unexpected leads. People appreciate being kept in the loop and may be more willing to help than you think.  
  
Use social media platforms as well. A simple post about what you’re looking for can reach many eyes quickly.  
  
Remember, networking is not just about asking; it’s also about giving back when possible. Offer support or advice to others seeking jobs too—it builds goodwill.  
  
Keep the lines of communication open and stay engaged with their updates as well. You never know how these relationships will evolve during your journey toward landing that dream job!

# Tip 26: Seek informational interviews with industry professionals.

Informational interviews can be a powerful tool in your job-hunting arsenal. These conversations allow you to gain insights directly from industry professionals, providing a behind-the-scenes look at their roles and companies.  
  
Approach potential contacts with genuine curiosity. Express interest in their career paths and experiences rather than asking for a job outright. This makes the interaction more about learning and less about pressure.  
  
Prepare thoughtful questions ahead of time. Ask about day-to-day responsibilities, challenges faced, and skills that are most valuable in their field. You might discover unexpected opportunities or resources during these discussions.  
  
Don’t forget to express gratitude afterward. A simple thank-you note can leave a lasting impression, potentially leading to future connections or referrals down the line. Engaging in this way helps build relationships that may benefit your career journey significantly.

# Tip 27: Volunteer at industry-related events.

Volunteering at industry-related events can open doors you didn’t even know existed. It’s a chance to immerse yourself in your field while making valuable connections.  
  
When you volunteer, you’re part of the action. You meet professionals who share your interests and may even be hiring. Those conversations can lead to mentorships or job leads that traditional applications might miss.  
  
Additionally, volunteering enhances your resume. It shows potential employers that you’re proactive and passionate about your career path. Plus, it allows you to gain hands-on experience in a real-world setting.  
  
You’ll learn skills specific to your industry while also showcasing teamwork and initiative—qualities every employer values. Embrace the opportunity; it could be the stepping stone toward landing that dream position you’ve been pursuing.

# Tip 28: Engage with industry content and thought leaders online.

Engaging with industry content and thought leaders online can significantly enhance your job search. Follow influential figures in your field on platforms like LinkedIn and Twitter. Their insights often provide valuable knowledge about trends and opportunities.  
  
Participate in discussions by commenting on their posts or sharing relevant articles with your perspective. This not only showcases your expertise but also helps you build connections.  
  
Join webinars or virtual panels they host to learn directly from experts while networking with other attendees. These interactions might lead to unexpected opportunities.  
  
Don’t shy away from creating content yourself—share what you’ve learned or express thoughts on current issues in the industry. Your voice can resonate, making you more visible to potential employers who value proactive candidates.  
  
Remember, consistency is key; regular engagement keeps you top-of-mind for both peers and leaders alike as you navigate the competitive job landscape.

# Tip 29: Leverage family and friends for potential referrals.

When it comes to job hunting, don’t underestimate the power of your personal network. Family and friends can be invaluable resources in your search for that dream position.  
  
Start by sharing your career goals with them. You never know who might have connections in industries or companies you’re interested in. Casual conversations can lead to unexpected opportunities.  
  
Consider asking if they know anyone hiring or if they could introduce you to professionals within their circles. A warm introduction often holds more weight than a cold application.  
  
Remember, this isn’t just about asking for jobs; it’s about building relationships. Engage them in discussions about your field of interest and seek advice on navigating challenges. Their insights might open doors you hadn’t considered before.  
  
Approaching this process with genuine curiosity will not only strengthen bonds but also increase your chances of landing a role through trusted recommendations.

# Tip 30: Always follow up after making a connection.

Following up after making a connection can set you apart in your job search. It shows initiative and appreciation for the time someone has invested in you.  
  
A simple thank-you message can go a long way. Express gratitude for their insights or assistance during your conversation. This gesture helps solidify that relationship.  
  
Timing matters too. Aim to send your follow-up within 24-48 hours of meeting. This keeps the interaction fresh in their mind while demonstrating your eagerness.  
  
You might also consider adding value to the conversation by sharing an article, resource, or information related to what you discussed. It reinforces your interest and expertise in the field.  
  
Don’t hesitate to keep the dialogue going over time. Regular check-ins show that you’re genuinely interested beyond just landing a job; they help maintain rapport and keep you on their radar for future opportunities.

1h3wcxk,https://www.reddit.com/r/srilanka/comments/1h3wcxk/is_this_behavior_normal_in_sri_lankan_culture_or/,"Is this behavior normal in Sri Lankan culture, or is it just him?","Moderator(s), please delete this post if not allowed.

Hi, I’m a Filipino-Canadian, and I had a Sri Lankan roommate who’s new to Canada and whom I lived with for over a year. I wanted to share an experience and ask for your insights.

Recently, we were invited to my friend’s house for drinks. I’m a light drinker, and all my friends know this about me. That night, my friend also made a soup that I really liked and wanted to eat more of because it was a dish similar to one from my country, which I haven’t had for almost a decade. When I tried to have more, my roommate told me not to eat too much. I ignored this because, honestly, why wouldn’t I eat more of something I enjoyed?

However, things escalated when he took my bowl away and hid it. He said he didn’t want me to eat because I might vomit, like he would if he eats and drinks alcohol at the same time. I didn’t argue with him but chose to eat more anyway. I was hungry, and as someone who took ServSafe, I knew that eating would help prevent me from getting drunk quickly on an empty stomach.

That same night, he pressured me multiple times to drink alcohol and even gave me a time ultimatum. He also pressured me to take marijuana gummies, even though I repeatedly said no. He knows I’m diagnosed with migraines and that drinking alcohol, lack of sleep, coffee, and an unhealthy diet are triggers for me, so his insistence felt especially inconsiderate.

Later, when it was time to leave, my roommate refused because he said he was still dizzy. I didn’t want to leave either because my friend—who was also under the influence of marijuana—said that if we came together, we should leave together. She’s a married woman, and her husband wasn’t home. I noticed she seemed uncomfortable with my roommate since she didn’t know him well, so I felt it was my responsibility to stay.

My roommate, however, insisted I leave and kept pressuring me to book a ride on my phone. I didn’t want to, but he was so forceful that I agreed and tried booking. However, it was already 5 AM, and neither Uber nor Lyft was taking my ride request. He made me try multiple times, and I did so because my plan was to stay by the door just in case something happened.

We argued for about 30 minutes because I didn’t want to leave them alone, especially since he refused to leave with me. Eventually, he booked an Uber for me on his phone, ignoring my feelings. When I suggested calling my sister for advice or waking my friend to ask if it was okay for me to leave, he didn’t like it and stopped speaking to me, signaling that he was done with the conversation. I ended up waking my friend, and she said it was okay for me to leave.

I’ve known him for over a year and always thought he was a decent guy. However, yesterday, when we went out with my friends again, he was being pushy about me drinking, even though I said no multiple times.

I’ll admit I’m not very familiar with South Asian culture, but even though I don’t have to follow it since I live in Canada, I want to understand what is considered normal or socially acceptable in Sri Lanka.

I’m starting to wonder if this behavior is cultural, personality-driven, or just plain disrespectful.

Is this kind of behavior normal in Sri Lankan culture? I’d really appreciate your honest opinions and advice.",15,1733031548.0,srilanka,12,0.94,False

My EQ6 has worked like a charm, until a few days ago. Not any liquid gets out during start up clean or when brewing a coffee. But wierdly enough I can still make a cup of hot water without any problems. It have been totally cleaned/scaled. And been that all the time since I got it. 

Probably something with the brewing unit, as far as I can tell by myself. So will a new of those fix my problems or so any know of why it behave like this? Would be a waste of money of the issue digs deeper... :(

I have taken a small video om me trying to brew a cup of coffee in the Youtube link below. But the maschine makes a lot of noises which isn't normal, except for the grinding which seem normal.

1h3w8fa,https://www.reddit.com/r/FictionWriting/comments/1h3w8fa/his_last_welcome/,His Last Welcome,"I opened my eyes slowly. I could feel the crust surrounding the outer edges of my eyelids. If I opened my eyes too fast, the crust would surely fall in. I closed my eyes and wiped the crust from my eyelids, but kept them closed. 

	Outside, I could hear my rooster calling from the front yard. How does he keep getting out of that fence? I know getting out of bed is the only way the rooster is going to stop, but my body resists. I was up late last night wondering about him again. Wondering. That seems to be the only thing I do when he's gone. Does he wonder about me? Sometimes I think that I just enjoy spending time with him in my memories, for sometimes he almost seems closer there. 

	I muster up the energy to launch myself onto my feet and start my morning. I don't need coffee this morning as it’ll only give me more energy to overthink. I stand on the porch and take a deep breath. The air is cool and crisp, and the sun has not yet peeked over the horizon. The edges of the farm are still completely dark from, only slightly illuminated by moonlight. I lock my fingers together and stretch before stepping off the porch and sauntering over to the rabbit pen.

	Most of the rabbits are still sleeping but I check to make sure everyone is alive. Next, is the barn to check on the horses. I open the door and I hear one of the horses give a short whine. It’s his horse, Viridi. Looking at her has become bittersweet. 

	In a way, Viridi and I have a weird sense of solidarity. Frequently abandoned by the one we love the most, never really sure of when he's coming back. Each time he's gone is never longer or shorter than the last. He comes and goes as he pleases. Nomadic in every sense of the word. I had half a mind to go with him, and I know he has half a mind to stay home but, in ourselves lies the truth. There will always be a part of us that wants something different. 

	I walk over to her and gently rub her nose. I know she doesn't like me as much as him, but she's always nicer to me when he's not around. He never believed that. She looks at me with blank eyes. Memories of me and him building this barn for her, start to flood my mind and  I feel a sense of hopelessness wash over me. Not right now. 

	I take my hand off of her nose and rush out of the barn. There's just so much I have to do. I storm back into the house and rip through my drawers. They have to be in here somewhere. I know he left them here, I'm positive. There, I pull a pair of headphones out of my bottom drawer. I turn them around and look at the jagged engraving of ‘R+D’ in a heart. Running my finger over the raised edges, I take a deep breath. I toss them over my ears and throw on a playlist of ambient music to keep my brain occupied. I can't spend all day thinking about him. 

	With the addition of the music, the farm chores go by rather uneventfully. I check the fence around the chicken coop to try to see where the rooster is getting out of, but I find nothing. Either way I know I'm going to have to fix it when I find it so I grab my wallet and my keys and make my way towards town in his pickup truck. 

	On the way to the tractor supply store, I called him. He built the fence after all. If anyone knew how to fix the fence it would be him for sure. It rings, and rings, and rings some more before I finally give up. That's weird, he's usually awake by now. 

“He’s probably just busy.” I say to myself out loud. I try to say it confidently but it comes out more like I'm trying to convince myself it's true. 

	The drive back from the store is filled with swirling thoughts of what he could be doing, and where he could be. It wasn't unusual for him to not answer a phone call but that didn't stop me from worrying about it every single time that it happened. When I pull up to my house I’m expecting to see my rooster on the porch but instead there's a man. The sound of the pickup truck catches his attention and he turns around, but I know who it is before then. He raises his arms in the air at the sight of the truck and gives a warm smile. 

“I thought we agreed you were supposed to have tea and a shower ready for me when I got home.” he yells from the porch. I know he's trying to make a joke but for some reason it rubs me the wrong way.

“Yeah well it’d be easier to do that if i ever knew when you were coming home.” I push past him into the house and leave the door open behind me, and I hear it shut from the back door. Footsteps gradually make their way to me. 

“So cranky darling. Is that any way to greet me?” he stares expectantly. I stare back blankly before taking a deep breath and walking over to him. Something in the back of my mind is telling me not to but I fall into him anyways. I wrap my arms around him tightly and stop breathing. I can feel his heartbeat on my cheek as we stand there in silence.

“I hate that you leave me.” This is our usual routine. He puts a finger under my chin and lifts my head so that our eyes meet.

“I’m never gone for long my love, and I know you're strong. After all, I just want to see the world.” 

“You can see the world but I want you to spend more time with me! I want to start a family.” I feel my eyes start to burn and my face gets hot so I release him. I hate letting him see me cry. 

“I worry, Darry. I worry that one day you won't come back. Whether that's because you found a new girl to be with, or you get hurt, or you just never find your way back home. We built all this together and sometimes it feels like I'm living in a shell of you. I miss you. I miss us. I miss having my husband around. Is that too much to ask?” I stare at him expectantly and he looks down at the floor. 

“Rose I-” 

“No Darry, I know what you're going to say. I don't want to hear how you're only going to be gone for a couple more years and-”

“Rose please!” His voice is stern but troubled. A pit starts to form in my stomach and I can feel myself getting nauseous

“Can we please just talk about this later?” I bit my lip and looked at the floor.

“Of course we can sweetheart. What tea would you like?” He sits down at the table and looks up at me silently. I wipe my hands on my pants and start to rustle through the cabinets for the kettle. We drank the tea in silence.

	The next morning I woke up to the sun peeking through the blinds. I roll over and feel for Darry but I'm met with the soft coolness of the sheets. My heart sinks and my breath catches. I jump out of bed and run to the window before I can process what's happening. There he is. In the backyard , fixing the fence surrounding the chicken coop. I swear I looked in the area he was patching and didn't see a hole.

	He should be coming in soon so I walk to the kitchen to make him tea. I sit at the kitchen table and butter a piece of toast I made for myself while I wait for the kettle to scream. He walks through the door just as it decides to blow.

“Just in time.” I mutter sheepishly.

“You made me tea? Ah, I appreciate it, but I don't know if I'll have time to drink it.” he replies. I stop and stare at him. His back is facing towards me but I know he can feel my eyes burning into his back.

“Don't do that now,” he mutters under his breath. I get up to storm back into the room but he catches my wrist in the doorway. I snatched it back.

“Do not!” I yell before taking a pause. By now tears have already started streaming down my face. I know what's coming next.

“Just go Darry. Leave, like you always do. Tell me you have to do a job or you want to go visit a friend and leave.” I throw my hands up in the air and turn to head up the stairs.

“Rosie, I’m not trying to hurt you my love. I promise. I'm just trying to figure some things out so I can be home more. You don't think I want to be here with you? I love you. Of course I want to be here with you. I care about you.”

“Care? Darry, you don't know anything about me! We don't talk and that's all your doing.” 

“I know you very well Rose.”

“What's my favorite color?” 

“Blue.” I stare at him for a moment before I turn and walk away. He doesn't say anything to try to stop me. After a while of burrowing my face into a tear drenched pillow I hear footsteps creak into our room. He sits on the edge of the bed and puts his hand on my side.

“Listen. I love you. You're right alright. You got me, I don't know any of the minor details about you. I don't remember your favorite color, or how much time has passed since the last time we talked but I always know what to say to you. I walk into a room and I always make you laugh. I know me leaving hurts you, and I know that it's wrong. Hell, I think you're pretty strong for putting up with it this long,” 

“Get to your point.” I hissed at him.

“It would be selfish of me to expect you to continue doing this for me, and I also understand you don't want to leave and come with me every single time I go somewhere for months on end. Rosie, you feel like home. What I’m trying to say is that you're my home. Through all the whipping and moving around I've been doing over the past years, I spend a lot of time thinking about the last time I was secure. That was with you Rose, in this home, in your arms.” I look at him and I feel my shoulders relax a bit. 

“What does all that mean, Darry.” 

“ I want you around. I need you around.” Darry grabs my hands and holds them close to his chest. 

	For the longest time I refused to go with him and travel because I wanted some sense of security. That's why anyone does anything right? To feel secure or at least lull themselves into a false sense of the word. That's why he helped me build this farm to begin with. Everything we did back then was for security. Getting married, building this farm, moving to this lonely city. I thought this was what I needed until he started traveling. His trips became more sporadic and longer and I was starting to get more and more impatient. I figured it was just the typical feelings of missing your spouse but as time went on I could feel it growing into something more. Something bigger than that. I wanted it to be resentment but in my heart I knew I couldn't hate Darry if I tried. He was my everything. So why was I having these feelings?

	“So what? I sell the farm and we just travel forever? What about all the things we built to feel secure together? You wanted this too Darry! I never even wanted to be in this city. I don't know anyone in this city. I only moved here because you said this was what you wanted.” Darry looked down at my hands and set them down on the bed. 

“This was what I needed, but things change my love and people grow. Their needs change and they may need to do things a little differently.” I can see Darry shift in his seat a little before clearing his throat. He has something to tell me but I can't fathom what. He already told me he was going on another trip, so what else could there be?

	“Now Rosie, I don't want you to go on and do all that hootin’ and hollerin’ like you do when you get mad but I have something to tell you.” I stare at Darry, emotionless. Sitting there patiently, I can already start to feel my body start to vibrate from the inside out. 

	“While I was out on one of the trips, I slept with this girl I met at the bar. I didn't think anything of it because we went our separate ways the next morning and I thought that would be the end of it.” Darry trails off and tears start to form in his eyes.

“You're about to piss me off Darry. You didn't.” I look up at the ceiling and ball my fists up. I can feel the buzzing in my body getting more and more intense and my teeth start to chatter. My body is completely stiff save for the periodic convulsion from the tremors in my body.

“She told me she could get pregnant Darry, and by god, I trusted the lady knew her own body!” He says it matter-of-factly. Of course he trusted her, a stranger, over logic. How disgustingly lustful. I stood up and took a long drawn out breath. I turned around to face him.

“Darry, I want you out of this house right now. I want you to pack up that bag with every trace of you in this home and take it elsewhere, you hear me? Darry I mean everything, down to the buttons that fell off your shirts.” I walk out of the room but he starts talking before I make it all the way out.

“Baby c’mon! I don't want to be with her, it didn't matter. I’m not going to be a father to the kid anyways.” I stopped dead in my tracks. 

“Why would you abandon your mistake to make me feel any better? You think I could have a baby with you in good conscience knowing that you have another one out there who you don't take care of? That doesn't attract me. It was supposed to be our child. I was supposed to have your child Darry, For Christ's sake, we're married!” What started out as a calm response shortly elapsed into a wailing sob. 

Darry stood there with tears streaming down his face but somehow still emotionless. He didn't know what to say. He didn't have to tell me that. After years of being with him, I already knew. For the first time, Darry didn't have to say anything. I didn't want him to.

1h3w88n,https://www.reddit.com/r/creepypasta/comments/1h3w88n/its_lurking_in_the_forest_with_fire_in_its_eyes/,"it's lurking in the forest, with fire in its eyes.","Hello all, I'm new to reddit and I'm here to tell you about my strange discovery in the forest of Oregon. For a bit of Backstory my name is Curt and I'm an amature Cryptozoology, and when I say armature I mean amature. I believe in Bigfoot and Nessy and UFOs, and I know something here or there about mythology. 

Any how, I have lived in Oregon all 40 years of my life and I had always been curious about the massive forests all around where I lived, what could be hiding in those trees just out of sight? Such curiosity is how I found myself searching local folklore on anything strange or unheard of in the forests nearby. One day in the fall of 2006 I found myself in a small diner outside of Junction city, a small farming town north of where I lived. I was sitting there drinking my coffee when overheard two older gentlemen speaking to each other at the other end of the bar table. 

“ I'm telling you Bill I saw it, It was looking right at me.”
“ ah horse shit Frank, you were probably drunk knowing you.”

“I swear Bill, gods Honest truth. It was just like the stories your dad use to tell us.” 

“ my Pa was as much of a drunk as you are, probably more.”

As they continued to speak to each other I moved down the bar towards them. 
“excuse me gentlemen? I couldn't help but over hear your conversation. Tell me what did you see?” 

The skinnier of the two, Bill, rolled his eyes at me, but Frank continued. 

“ I saw the Lurker.” He said excited that some one cared to hear his story. 

“the lurker?” I asked unsure of what he meant. He leaned in close and said. 

“The Lurker is a local mystery, it lives in the woods, watching us.” He paused and took a swig of his Beer. 

“I was out stalking one of the local trails, looking for white tail. While I was trudging through the brush I hear a loud cracking sound in the trees ahead. I stopped to see what it could be, thinking it was a Cougar or a Deer. When I saw one of the trees move as if it turned away from me in that brief moment I saw two gleaming Orange eyes like two burning coals.” 

Bill let out a scoff.
“More likely you saw someones tail lights.”

“ I know the difference between tail lights and eyes Bill!” Frank exclaimed as he shot his head In Bill's direction. 

“How do you know that it's the Lurker?” I interjected. 

“ folks been seeing it for years and it's always described the same way.” Frank continued.

“What did you do next?” 

“Nothing, I blinked and just like that it was gone again as if it had never been there. Then I made my way back to my Pick-up and headed back home.” 

I sipped from my coffee as contemplating Frank's tale, the exhilaration of finding something unknown crept up my spine. 

“Where was this?” I asked, trying to downplay my excitement. 

Frank looked at me with a twinge of suspicion in his eyes. 

“Why do you want to know?”

“morbid curiosity, I'm doing research for a blog on folklore.” 

Frank scratched the back of his head uncomfortably. 

“Alright, it was on a game trail out by Fern ridge. It's not far from a hiking trail that's visited often.”

I thanked him, payed for my coffee then left. 
I was actually familiar with the hiking trail Frank had told me about, so I headed straight there. I arrived at Fern Ridge later that afternoon and made my way down the hiking trail towards the woods. Soon enough I found the game trail that Frank had told me about. As I made my way through the underbrush, I felt the tingle of my hairs standing up in excitement. The foliage got thicker and thicker as I continued, suddenly, I lost my footing and fell into the bushes. When I looked down towards my feet I saw a huge hole that I had slipped into. 

I got up, brushed myself off and inspected  the hole. It was about 3 feet wide and about 1 foot deep, I was lucky I hadn't really hurt myself. Then I noticed that there was a bunch of loose soil both in and around the hole. it looked like the hole left by a tree being uprooted, only there was no fallen tree nearby. I felt a shiver up my spine, I couldn't tell you why. I shook my head thinking an animal had just been digging in the dirt. But as I looked up the trail I saw another hole about 15 feet away, and another, and another. If I didn't know any better I would've said they were footprints. I felt a lump forming in my throat and the sudden urge to follow the trail growing in the back of my head.

Against my better judgment I began to follow the foot trail of “foot prints.” The excitement of finding something truly undiscovered too enticing to ignore. As I continued a little voice in my head began to implore me not to follow, but that voice was little more than a whisper.
Soon, I found the trail lead to a small clearing, the prints stopped exactly where I was standing. I look around and saw no trace of the prints I looked about and saw that the Sun was starting to set, I must have really lost track of time. 

I turned around making one last pass at the clearing, when a cacophony of screeches shot up from the trees just to my left. I nearly jumped out of my skin as a murder of crows came bursting from the trees circling another the clearing. They flew into the air like a black cloud, slowly spiraling towards the ground. Feeling a sudden pull drawing me towards where they were landing. As I made my way closer, my skin began to crawl as I felt the putrid stench of rot in the air. My heart stopped as I looked down, there laying in the middle of the clearing was a body, torn to pieces, entrails strewn around like streamers. 

I turned away, retching up what little I had in my stomach. I pulled myself back up, my eye locked with the dead puffy eye in the shattered remnants of its skull. One of the larger crows landed there cocking its head at me curiously. It squawked and pecked at the wet puffy eye, pulling it free with a wer sucking sound. It quickly gobbled up the eye, I was to shocked and filled with disbelief to move. The crow tilted its head at me again, and for a brief moment I could have sworn I saw a glint of orange in the birds eye. 
It screeched and flew away, as it did all of my senses slowly returned to me I felt my arms start to move frantically to my phone. I scrambled to dial, 9-1-1, A woman's voice immediately answered.

“ 911 help line please state the nature of your emergency.”
“hi….I….oh god…I'd like to report a dead body!”

“OK sir please tell me your name.”

I felt my tongue glued to the roof of my mouth as I tried to answer.

“ my name is C-Curt, Curt Walsh! I'm out off a game trail just off Fern ridge…I was going for a walk and I found….oh God I can't even tell…ma’am it's bad…please..send someone.”

She tried to calm me down, but all I could do was hear the Crows, they began to squawk in a more full chorus.

“ Curt I need you to tell me if the officers and paramedics can get to you.”

The birds squawking grew louder, I clutched my head as my ears began to ring.

“I…..I…what!?” I shouted into the phone, she responded louder.

“can the Paramedics and Officers get to you?” 

“I….I'm not sure I'm off the usual trail about a quarter of a mile!”

The birds kept calling out trying to drown out all other sounds. My ears began to ring louder the woman's voice was a muffled mess I felt an ear piercing yell tear out of my lungs.

“SHUT UP!!!!” 

suddenly the birds all stopped and cranked their heads towards me. There was an uncomfortable silence made all the worse now that the noise was gone. The crows spread their wings and took to the sky flying towards the slowly sinking sun. As I watched I heard the woman.
“ Curt?! Curt? Are you ok?”

I placed the phone back to my ear.
“ y-yes…..sorry there was a group of crows…they…led me to the body…and they were being loud…I'm sorry.” 

She hesitated then in a soft voice replied.
“It's Ok….the officers are on their way, can you help them find the body?”

“uh, yes… I can go off the trail and lead the officers here.”

She spoke softly over the phone.
“OK would you like me to stay on the call with you until then?”

I stuttered my mind still a whir with the sound of the crows and the discovery at my feet. 
“Yes…please…miss?”
“Lizz.” She responded softly.
 “My name is Lizz.”

As I walked back to the main trail I spoke to Lizz, explaining why I was out there, and how the Crows had led me to the body. She spoke softly to me trying to keep me calm. She seemed sweet and kind over the phone, I would have asked her for more pleasant company bit given the circumstances I decided now was not the time. As I reached the trail a half hour later I saw the lights flickering from the officers and paramedics.

“Alright I'm back at the main trail, thank you Lizz, for the calming conversation.”

She spoke softly and said 
“It's alright Curt, I hope you are OK and the Paramedics can help you.”

I felt a pang in my stomach as I knew the conversation was ending. I blurted out.
“Could I get your Number!”

She chuckled over the other end.
“Well this is the strangest way a guy has ever asked for that but sure, why not?”

I pulled out my pocket book and wrote down the number she game me. We exchanged pleasantries and the call ended.
Soon I brought the Officers and the Paramedics around to the clearing, the began to investigate the body as I told them the whole story. How I had been out there following some tracks, how the crows startled me and I followed them to the body. One of the officers looked at me strangely, he was an older man maybe in his late Fifties. his name badge gleamed in the flash light
‘Lesky’

“You a journo?”

I shook my head slowly.
“No, why do you ask?”

“cuz it sounds like you were looking for the Lurker.”

I felt my stomach twist slightly.
“I was…is there a problem.”

Lusky slowly adjusted his cap.
“listen kid, people who go looking for old ghost stories usually find nothing but trouble. So do me and my guys here a favor and quit while you're ahead.” 

A new twinge of morbid curiosity tingled up my spine.

“What makes you say that?”

He pulled a cigarette from his coat pocket.
“the last time some city slicker came here to look for the Lurker, he wound up dead.”
His eyes trailed to the macabre strewn corpse.
“and it was about as pretty as this.”

I raised my eyebrows
“what are you saying a local legend did this.”

“all i'm saying, is that there's something in these woods…and it wants to be left alone.”
A thin trail of smoke left his mouth, as he flicked his barely started Cigarette onto the ground stomping it into the brackish mud.
 He turned away from me and started telling his men to finish up as the Paramedics where almost finished packing up the body.

“ am I done here?” I asked one of the other officers, He nodded to me.
“if you are feeling well enough to drive you can head home now, we may call you in for another statement once the coronary report comes in.”

I nodded, thanked him and turned around to leave. as I slowly made my way to back towards the edge of the clearing I caught something just off the other end. Two gleaming lights, like burning coals. I blinked my eyes and shook my head, they were gon just as soon as they appeared. I shuddered thinking my mind was playing tricks on me as I made my way back to my car I couldn't help but Shake the feeling I was being watched.

Pizza makes me constipated, so my 2 meals per day consists of $2 coffee and 1.50$ donuts, then I scramble something from the food bank together for dinner. Im not purchasing from this coffee shop for luxury, but only because of affordability. Im given only15 mins for lunch, and my workplace is far from other eateries on campus, 15mins is walking distance to an eatery so its not possible to leave the building for lunch.

I feel lots of shame for my purchase, I don't know why. mY friend on the other hand has consumed dominos pizza and bought a bran new MacBook, even if she knew about congo and said she wouldn't buy one. I didn't question her purchase, and even writing about what someone else bought feels weird. We take the same class as well, and I can almost feel like she feels I'm a fraud. Ive tried to ask hr what the odd energy between us is, but no response. At times I feel our disparity in income levels, makes her come off ignorant at times. Even if I try to explain this situation, she might see it as an excuse. 

she did say "" i saw you yesterday with you coffee from \_\_"" and i answered her that "" yes, i just needed my coffee"", but idk if i was wrong.

I feel being able to boycott is really a privilege at times, especially if affordability and accessibility s not an issue. I don't boycott starbucks, lululemon and the rest becuadse I never consumed them to begin with, probably because I never had money to, and have always bought second hand cloths and gadgets.

It feels like I'm being seen as a liar now, and I almost even feel uncomfortable ever speaking about Palestine, because it seems like I'm a fraud. None of what I see in Palestine and congo makes me uncomfortable. I might not be going to every protest or posting on social media everyday, but I =t doesn't mean I don't care. i love to listen to others speak about how they feel, especially other people of colour, even if although, everytime I've spoken about black issues, it feels like no one around me cares much.

  
This almost feels like a situation of activist purity, i feel no one can ever consume ethically in the times we are in. Ever. So using someone purchase to judge how they see an issue feels almost painful. ",1,1733030598.0,blackladies,0,0.67,False

i tried the IC diet and had no improvement so i sad f*** it and went back to enjoying food and coffee (still doing decaf just to be safe). nothing changed after i went back. i tried abstaining from sex for a few weeks, nothing happened. sex actually seems to make me feel better which i don’t hear a lot about. 

i cannot pin point a single trigger. i did all these things while waiting to see a urologist because i knew they would say to try these things first and he basically said “great! keep doing what your doing!” even tho i had told them that it didn’t make any improvement. i also didn’t receive any diagnosis, so i decided to make an appt with a urogyn, but that not for a couple months away. 

whatever i have is not horrendous, more of just a painful annoyance. but i would like this painful annoyance to go away. 

my symptoms include urgency and an aching feeling. (tmi but feels like something is heavy behind my clitoris if that makes sense). i have no burning while urinating, i can hold my bladder for up to like 4 hours but it’s usually around 2 because that’s when i start to get that heavy feelings. 

does anyone have similar symptoms that got some relief. it would be really appreciated!!

# Nagano Tonic Review

I’ve always believed in second chances. For years, I struggled with weight, energy slumps, and a general feeling that my body wasn’t living up to its potential. Like so many others, I tried it all—fad diets, workout routines, expensive supplements that promised the world and delivered nothing but frustration. And then, I found *it*. The answer I had been searching for, hidden in plain sight. A tonic that completely changed the game.

When I first started using this product, I was skeptical. I’d seen countless ads touting “miracle” solutions, and I’d fallen for more than a few of them. But something about this was different. The formula wasn’t just some random mix of buzzword ingredients—it was rooted in traditions and science, boasting a blend of natural extracts that targeted energy, metabolism, and, most importantly, stubborn fat.

[👉Click here to visit Nagano Tonic's Official website](https://tinyurl.com/2s3d2rt2)

Within the first week, I noticed something I hadn’t felt in years: energy. Not the jittery, fake kind you get from sugar or caffeine overload, but a steady, all-day flow that powered me through my mornings and well into the evening. That alone was worth the price. But the real magic started to show in the mirror.

By week three, I saw a difference. My clothes fit better, my face looked leaner, and the stubborn belly fat that had clung to me like a bad habit for years began to melt away. And it wasn’t just about aesthetics—my confidence skyrocketed. I started walking taller, smiling more, and feeling like the version of myself I had always wanted to be.

The best part? I wasn’t starving myself or punishing my body with grueling workouts. Sure, I was eating reasonably and staying active, but this wasn’t about restriction or exhaustion. It was about giving my body the tools it needed to function optimally. This tonic became a part of my routine as natural as brushing my teeth. A scoop, a stir, and a sip each morning. That’s all it took.

Here’s what I didn’t expect: the ripple effect. When your body starts performing at its best, every aspect of your life levels up. I became more productive at work, more present with my family, and even more adventurous. Hiking trails I’d avoided for years now felt like a welcome challenge, not a dreaded punishment.

Friends started noticing the transformation and asking, “What’s your secret?” And while I wanted to shout it from the rooftops, I also wanted them to know this wasn’t a magic pill. It was a tool—a powerful, effective tool that worked when paired with a mindset shift. This wasn’t about quick fixes or gimmicks; it was about reclaiming control over my health and my life.

Months later, I’ve maintained my results. The weight hasn’t crept back, my energy remains sky-high, and my confidence continues to grow. It’s not just about looking better—it’s about *being* better. I’m finally living the life I deserve, and it all started with a single choice to try something new.

If you’re on the fence, I get it. I’ve been there. But let me tell you this: the hardest step is the first one. Once you take it, you’ll realize how much you’ve been holding yourself back. This tonic gave me more than weight loss and energy—it gave me a fresh start. And for that, I’ll forever be grateful.

Your transformation is waiting. It’s time to say yes.

What truly sets this tonic apart from the sea of other products claiming miraculous results is the science behind it. This isn’t just a blend of trendy ingredients slapped together to make a quick sale—it’s a carefully crafted formula inspired by time-tested traditions and backed by modern research.

At its core, the tonic is designed to address one of the most overlooked aspects of weight loss and overall health: metabolic efficiency. Many people struggle to shed pounds not because they’re eating too much or moving too little, but because their metabolism isn’t functioning the way it should. It’s like trying to run a marathon with a car stuck in second gear—you can work as hard as you want, but you’ll never get the results you’re after.

Here’s where the tonic’s unique ingredients come into play. Each one serves a specific purpose, targeting key systems in the body to create a synergistic effect. Let’s break it down:

# 1. Boosting Metabolism

The tonic contains EGCG (Epigallocatechin Gallate), a powerful compound found in green tea that has been widely studied for its metabolism-enhancing properties. EGCG works by stimulating thermogenesis, which helps your body burn fat more efficiently. It’s like turning your body into a fat-burning furnace, especially when paired with a balanced diet.

# 2. Reducing Stress and Cortisol

Stress is a silent saboteur when it comes to weight loss. Elevated cortisol levels can lead to stubborn belly fat, cravings for unhealthy foods, and even muscle loss. That’s why the inclusion of adaptogenic herbs like Ashwagandha is so important. Ashwagandha has been shown to regulate cortisol levels, reduce stress, and improve overall well-being, making it easier to stick to healthy habits.

# 3. Improving Digestion

A sluggish digestive system can stall even the most well-intentioned health journey. Ingredients like Camu Camu and Mangosteen support gut health by introducing powerful antioxidants and anti-inflammatory properties. A healthier gut means better nutrient absorption, fewer cravings, and a happier, lighter you.

# 4. Natural Energy Boost

Unlike synthetic stimulants that can leave you jittery and crashing, the tonic leverages natural energy boosters like Panax Ginseng. This ancient root is known for enhancing physical and mental stamina without overtaxing your system. The result? You’re alert, focused, and ready to tackle your day without relying on endless cups of coffee.

# 5. Balancing Blood Sugar

One of the hidden culprits of weight gain is unstable blood sugar. Spikes and crashes can lead to fatigue, cravings, and fat storage. The tonic helps stabilize blood sugar levels, thanks to its blend of carefully selected plant-based ingredients. This not only aids in weight management but also supports long-term health.

# 6. Detoxifying the Body

Every day, we’re exposed to toxins from the environment, food, and even the products we use. Over time, these can build up in the body, slowing down processes like fat oxidation and energy production. This tonic includes ingredients rich in antioxidants, which help neutralize harmful free radicals and detoxify the body. Think of it as a gentle cleanse that works from the inside out.

# 7. Supporting Hormonal Balance

Weight loss isn’t just about calories in versus calories out; hormones play a massive role in how your body processes food, burns fat, and even determines hunger levels. The tonic’s ingredients are carefully chosen to support hormonal health, creating an environment where your body feels safe to let go of excess weight.

When you combine these scientifically-backed mechanisms, it’s no wonder the results are so profound. This tonic doesn’t just help you lose weight—it optimizes your body from the inside out. It’s like giving your system a complete tune-up, addressing the root causes of stubborn fat and low energy rather than just masking the symptoms.

After learning about the science, my confidence in the product only grew. I wasn’t just experiencing results—I understood *why* they were happening. And that knowledge made the journey even more empowering. This isn’t about chasing a quick fix; it’s about leveraging proven, natural solutions to unlock your body’s full potential.

If there’s one thing I’ve learned, it’s that when science meets tradition, incredible things can happen. This tonic is living proof.



**TL;DR:** Nagano Tonic is a natural supplement inspired by Japanese traditions, designed to boost metabolism, energy, and overall well-being. Packed with scientifically-backed ingredients like EGCG, Ashwagandha, and Mangosteen, it helps with weight loss, stress reduction, and gut health. My personal experience has been transformative—improved energy, noticeable fat loss, and increased confidence without drastic lifestyle changes. If you’re seeking a sustainable solution for better health, this tonic might just be the game-changer you’ve been looking for.

1h3vu4s,https://www.reddit.com/r/shortstories/comments/1h3vu4s/rf_his_last_welcome/,[RF] His Last Welcome,"I opened my eyes slowly. I could feel the crust surrounding the outer edges of my eyelids. If I opened my eyes too fast, the crust would surely fall in. I closed my eyes and wiped the crust from my eyelids, but kept them closed.

Outside, I could hear my rooster calling from the front yard. How does he keep getting out of that fence? I know getting out of bed is the only way the rooster is going to stop, but my body resists. I was up late last night wondering about him again. Wondering. That seems to be the only thing I do when he's gone. Does he wonder about me? Sometimes I think that I just enjoy spending time with him in my memories, for sometimes he almost seems closer there.   
  
I muster up the energy to launch myself onto my feet and start my morning. I don't need coffee this morning as it’ll only give me more energy to overthink. I stand on the porch and take a deep breath. The air is cool and crisp, and the sun has not yet peeked over the horizon. The edges of the farm are still completely dark from, only slightly illuminated by moonlight. I lock my fingers together and stretch before stepping off the porch and sauntering over to the rabbit pen.  
  
Most of the rabbits are still sleeping but I check to make sure everyone is alive. Next, is the barn to check on the horses. I open the door and I hear one of the horses give a short whine. It’s his horse, Viridi. Looking at her has become bittersweet.   
  
In a way, Viridi and I have a weird sense of solidarity. Frequently abandoned by the one we love the most, never really sure of when he's coming back. Each time he's gone is never longer or shorter than the last. He comes and goes as he pleases. Nomadic in every sense of the word. I had half a mind to go with him, and I know he has half a mind to stay home but, in ourselves lies the truth. There will always be a part of us that wants something different.   
  
I walk over to her and gently rub her nose. I know she doesn't like me as much as him, but she's always nicer to me when he's not around. He never believed that. She looks at me with blank eyes. Memories of me and him building this barn for her, start to flood my mind and  I feel a sense of hopelessness wash over me. Not right now.   
  
I take my hand off of her nose and rush out of the barn. There's just so much I have to do. I storm back into the house and rip through my drawers. They have to be in here somewhere. I know he left them here, I'm positive. There, I pull a pair of headphones out of my bottom drawer. I turn them around and look at the jagged engraving of ‘R+D’ in a heart. Running my finger over the raised edges, I take a deep breath. I toss them over my ears and throw on a playlist of ambient music to keep my brain occupied. I can't spend all day thinking about him.   
  
With the addition of the music, the farm chores go by rather uneventfully. I check the fence around the chicken coop to try to see where the rooster is getting out of, but I find nothing. Either way I know I'm going to have to fix it when I find it so I grab my wallet and my keys and make my way towards town in his pickup truck.   
  
On the way to the tractor supply store, I called him. He built the fence after all. If anyone knew how to fix the fence it would be him for sure. It rings, and rings, and rings some more before I finally give up. That's weird, he's usually awake by now. 

“He’s probably just busy.” I say to myself out loud. I try to say it confidently but it comes out more like I'm trying to convince myself it's true.

The drive back from the store is filled with swirling thoughts of what he could be doing, and where he could be. It wasn't unusual for him to not answer a phone call but that didn't stop me from worrying about it every single time that it happened. When I pull up to my house I’m expecting to see my rooster on the porch but instead there's a man. The sound of the pickup truck catches his attention and he turns around, but I know who it is before then. He raises his arms in the air at the sight of the truck and gives a warm smile. 

“I thought we agreed you were supposed to have tea and a shower ready for me when I got home.” he yells from the porch. I know he's trying to make a joke but for some reason it rubs me the wrong way.

“Yeah well it’d be easier to do that if i ever knew when you were coming home.” I push past him into the house and leave the door open behind me, and I hear it shut from the back door. Footsteps gradually make their way to me.

“So cranky darling. Is that any way to greet me?” he stares expectantly. I stare back blankly before taking a deep breath and walking over to him. Something in the back of my mind is telling me not to but I fall into him anyways. I wrap my arms around him tightly and stop breathing. I can feel his heartbeat on my cheek as we stand there in silence.

“I hate that you leave me.” This is our usual routine. He puts a finger under my chin and lifts my head so that our eyes meet.

“I’m never gone for long my love, and I know you're strong. After all, I just want to see the world.”

“You can see the world but I want you to spend more time with me! I want to start a family.” I feel my eyes start to burn and my face gets hot so I release him. I hate letting him see me cry.

“I worry, Darry. I worry that one day you won't come back. Whether that's because you found a new girl to be with, or you get hurt, or you just never find your way back home. We built all this together and sometimes it feels like I'm living in a shell of you. I miss you. I miss us. I miss having my husband around. Is that too much to ask?” I stare at him expectantly and he looks down at the floor.

“Rose I-”

“No Darry, I know what you're going to say. I don't want to hear how you're only going to be gone for a couple more years and-”

“Rose please!” His voice is stern but troubled. A pit starts to form in my stomach and I can feel myself getting nauseous

“Can we please just talk about this later?” I bit my lip and looked at the floor.

“Of course we can sweetheart. What tea would you like?” He sits down at the table and looks up at me silently. I wipe my hands on my pants and start to rustle through the cabinets for the kettle. We drank the tea in silence.

The next morning I woke up to the sun peeking through the blinds. I roll over and feel for Darry but I'm met with the soft coolness of the sheets. My heart sinks and my breath catches. I jump out of bed and run to the window before I can process what's happening. There he is. In the backyard , fixing the fence surrounding the chicken coop. I swear I looked in the area he was patching and didn't see a hole.  
  
He should be coming in soon so I walk to the kitchen to make him tea. I sit at the kitchen table and butter a piece of toast I made for myself while I wait for the kettle to scream. He walks through the door just as it decides to blow.

“Just in time.” I mutter sheepishly.

“You made me tea? Ah, I appreciate it, but I don't know if I'll have time to drink it.” he replies. I stop and stare at him. His back is facing towards me but I know he can feel my eyes burning into his back.

“Don't do that now,” he mutters under his breath. I get up to storm back into the room but he catches my wrist in the doorway. I snatched it back.

“Do not!” I yell before taking a pause. By now tears have already started streaming down my face. I know what's coming next.

“Just go Darry. Leave, like you always do. Tell me you have to do a job or you want to go visit a friend and leave.” I throw my hands up in the air and turn to head up the stairs.

“Rosie, I’m not trying to hurt you my love. I promise. I'm just trying to figure some things out so I can be home more. You don't think I want to be here with you? I love you. Of course I want to be here with you. I care about you.”

“Care? Darry, you don't know anything about me! We don't talk and that's all your doing.”

“I know you very well Rose.”

“What's my favorite color?”

“Blue.” I stare at him for a moment before I turn and walk away. He doesn't say anything to try to stop me. After a while of burrowing my face into a tear drenched pillow I hear footsteps creak into our room. He sits on the edge of the bed and puts his hand on my side.

“Listen. I love you. You're right alright. You got me, I don't know any of the minor details about you. I don't remember your favorite color, or how much time has passed since the last time we talked but I always know what to say to you. I walk into a room and I always make you laugh. I know me leaving hurts you, and I know that it's wrong. Hell, I think you're pretty strong for putting up with it this long,”

“Get to your point.” I hissed at him.

“It would be selfish of me to expect you to continue doing this for me, and I also understand you don't want to leave and come with me every single time I go somewhere for months on end. Rosie, you feel like home. What I’m trying to say is that you're my home. Through all the whipping and moving around I've been doing over the past years, I spend a lot of time thinking about the last time I was secure. That was with you Rose, in this home, in your arms.” I look at him and I feel my shoulders relax a bit.

“What does all that mean, Darry.”

“ I want you around. I need you around.” Darry grabs my hands and holds them close to his chest.

For the longest time I refused to go with him and travel because I wanted some sense of security. That's why anyone does anything right? To feel secure or at least lull themselves into a false sense of the word. That's why he helped me build this farm to begin with. Everything we did back then was for security. Getting married, building this farm, moving to this lonely city. I thought this was what I needed until he started traveling. His trips became more sporadic and longer and I was starting to get more and more impatient. I figured it was just the typical feelings of missing your spouse but as time went on I could feel it growing into something more. Something bigger than that. I wanted it to be resentment but in my heart I knew I couldn't hate Darry if I tried. He was my everything. So why was I having these feelings?  
  
“So what? I sell the farm and we just travel forever? What about all the things we built to feel secure together? You wanted this too Darry! I never even wanted to be in this city. I don't know anyone in this city. I only moved here because you said this was what you wanted.” Darry looked down at my hands and set them down on the bed. 

“This was what I needed, but things change my love and people grow. Their needs change and they may need to do things a little differently.” I can see Darry shift in his seat a little before clearing his throat. He has something to tell me but I can't fathom what. He already told me he was going on another trip, so what else could there be?

“Now Rosie, I don't want you to go on and do all that hootin’ and hollerin’ like you do when you get mad but I have something to tell you.” I stare at Darry, emotionless. Sitting there patiently, I can already start to feel my body start to vibrate from the inside out.   
  
“While I was out on one of the trips, I slept with this girl I met at the bar. I didn't think anything of it because we went our separate ways the next morning and I thought that would be the end of it.” Darry trails off and tears start to form in his eyes.

“You're about to piss me off Darry. You didn't.” I look up at the ceiling and ball my fists up. I can feel the buzzing in my body getting more and more intense and my teeth start to chatter. My body is completely stiff save for the periodic convulsion from the tremors in my body.

“She told me she could get pregnant Darry, and by god, I trusted the lady knew her own body!” He says it matter-of-factly. Of course he trusted her, a stranger, over logic. How disgustingly lustful. I stood up and took a long drawn out breath. I turned around to face him.

“Darry, I want you out of this house right now. I want you to pack up that bag with every trace of you in this home and take it elsewhere, you hear me? Darry I mean everything, down to the buttons that fell off your shirts.” I walk out of the room but he starts talking before I make it all the way out.

“Baby c’mon! I don't want to be with her, it didn't matter. I’m not going to be a father to the kid anyways.” I stopped dead in my tracks.

“Why would you abandon your mistake to make me feel any better? You think I could have a baby with you in good conscience knowing that you have another one out there who you don't take care of? That doesn't attract me. It was supposed to be our child. I was supposed to have your child Darry, For Christ's sake, we're married!” What started out as a calm response shortly elapsed into a wailing sob.

Darry stood there with tears streaming down his face but somehow still emotionless. He didn't know what to say. He didn't have to tell me that. After years of being with him, I already knew. For the first time, Darry didn't have to say anything. I didn't want him to.",1,1733029635.0,shortstories,1,1.0,False

We met when we were both 25 and worked at our previous jobs, I worked in an office that was on top of the coffee shop she worked at. We slowly started, dating things materialized, and the sex was the most amazing either of us ever had had. It was daily, it was intense, and we worked hard to fulfill each other’s wants and needs. We dated 5 years and been married the past 5, total of 10. Our daughter was born 3 years ago and although I expected sex to slow down, I wasn’t prepared for it to just stop. In the last 3 years, we have had sex 3 times. She doesn’t want to do oral anymore, and even when we have, it seems like she does it gets what she wants, and then rushes me. I expressed to her my wants and needs and frustrations and her response is giving birth traumatized her and she doesn’t want any risk of getting pregnant. She also said she just doesn’t get turned on or even crave sex anymore. I haven’t cheated or had an affair, i haven’t even entertained it. But now it’s running rampant and brought me here. I love my family and don’t wish to be elsewhere, but also I am a man that has needs that aren’t being met at all. Not sure what to do. The sexual frustration obviously leads to many arguments and a lot of non issues are problems. I do find myself getting more easily annoyed with her personally. I don’t wanna cheat, but I don’t wanna fight, but I also want to have my needs taken care of. Help…..",1,1733029477.0,DeadBedrooms,0,0.67,False

1h3vp1u,https://www.reddit.com/r/DeadBedrooms/comments/1h3vp1u/a_half_empty_nest_and_the_future/,A Half Empty Nest and The Future,"Now that one of our kids has left for college (the other is living at home while they go to school in town), I've been thinking more about what life will be like when it's just me and my LL wife and our pets.

I'm in my early fifties and she'll be fifty next year. Her forties have come and gone without any hint of a resurgence of her libido. She takes meds for anxiety and I truly feel they have killed our sex life.

Any sexual/romantic playfulness on my part is met with exasperation and/or outright hostility. I can feel my own libido slowly ebbing, and I'm afraid once it's gone, I'll have so much resentment I won't want to be around her anymore. 

We've been married for over 20 years. Sex was never plentiful as I wished it could have been, but we were at least normal in the sense that we got together often enough to prevent serious resentment. Over the last five or so years, she's become almost anti-sexual when it comes to me. She has a vibrator (which I bought for her in the vain hope it might cause some sort of awakening) which she uses occasionally - and then tells me about what a good time she had using it. She'll tell me I should take care of myself, but that if I watch porn it's not ok.

I consider myself to be a pretty selfless lover; when we were physical, she always came first. I never wanted to finish pleasuring her - she'd have to push me away. When it was my turn, her attitude would change to ""let's get this over with"". I still don't understand how someone can be so uncaring and callous toward their partner. There were times when we both were in a good mood and had a wonderful time, but the pattern of Her First Then Me Second (As Quickly As Possible) has been our routine for years. 

Any suggestion of changing things up in the bedroom is met with derision and judgement. I've suggested all manner of kinky things, and she has zero interest. Her job is stressful and she's never in the mood unless she's had a day of rest. Friday night? Too tired, don't talk to me. Saturday morning? Ew, morning breath and besides I haven't had coffee yet. Saturday afternoon? No, I'm tired from my spin class/errands and I just want to relax. Saturday night? No, I'm going upstairs to do crosswords and derp on my phone. Sunday morning? No, see Saturday morning. Sunday afternoon? Maybe... assuming she's in the mood. And do I get the luxury of NOT being in the mood?

Meanwhile, I've been ready all week. After dinner mid-week? Why not? Before work randomly one morning? Why not? Can I cuddle you for a bit before work? No, I have to get ready. Am I talking too much after work? Probably, because she has to deal with so many people at work.

I am here.
I am human.
I don't deserve sex just because we're married, but I have needs.
I am here, waiting.
I just don't know how much longer.",2,1733029207.0,DeadBedrooms,1,1.0,False

🔎 My gf and I are looking for one roommate (no couples) to live with us and our kitty in our 2 bedroom/1 bath duplex conveniently located in midtown (close to the Co-op and Temple Coffee on S street, a light rail station, and all major freeways). My gf is in PA school and studies a lot at home and at school, and I work part-time for the library and for myself as a mobile music therapist.

🏠 Rent is $850/month (includes internet) plus utilities which range from $100 -160/mo total for the whole household (SMUD only) and will be split evenly amongst all 3 of us. The room is approx. 10x10ft. (unfurnished) and the apt has central air and heat. The rest of the apartment is fully furnished. The washer/dryer is accessible from outside on the bottom level. The fireplace is functional and you’re definitely welcome to use! You will have a guaranteed parking spot in a gated space right outside. There’s also a cute little patio upstairs and small garden area available for use downstairs.

⚠️ Our unit is upstairs. No additional pets please as our kitty unfortunately does not get along with other animals (but does love cuddling with anyone who has a cozy blanket). You will be asked to share landlord references and proof of income for the past year.

🚭 No smoking.

1h3vlk7,https://www.reddit.com/r/AncestryDNA/comments/1h3vlk7/i_found_my_father/,I found my father,"Boy oh boy. I posted here in 2021 when I got my results. Based on my results, I learned my dad was not my biological father (we have never been close, and yes it hurt, but it opened a door for me to potentially find my biological father. I tried so hard and couldn’t get any answers. My mother had just passed away so I had nobody to confirm anything. 

Three weeks ago, early November 2024, my whole life changed. 

I got an email from a distant cousin asking about my paternal lineage (he said his name) and explained how I showed up as the man’s brother’s niece. Shooketh. I told my newly found cousin my situation and he said “I’m going to find your father. I just need to try and prove that he is NOT your father to be sure”. He sent me photos of all the brothers of my uncle I’m matched with on Ancestry. Of the three men, my stomach did a flip when I saw one in particular. I felt it in my soul that I was his daughter. I am skeptical, distrusting, analytical AND I believe in the power of intuition. On top of that, I look exactly like this man. I tried to not be Maury, but I swear it’s insane. 

We talked throughout the day and what started as confusion and him being very much skeptical, ended in him agreeing 100% this man is my father. (Another note: my father hasn’t done a test, so we’re looking at every connection I have and trying to figure it out). We got on a three way call with my other uncle and he was so kind and even remembered my mom. 

That uncle reached out to my bio dad to tell him that I exist. I’m 37. I don’t want anything from him, other than to know I’m not this random human with no parents. I emphasized this to my uncle. I’ve done well for myself in business and am whole internally. I would LOVE a relationship but I was willing to to simply do a dna test to confirm. 

My bio father thinks it’s all a scam 😭. I have tried to record a video simply saying hello, I’m here, I know this is shocking news, but I’m not a scam. Every time I try I cry so hard. I don’t want to send him an emotional video. But I think I’m just going to have to do it. 

I know he probably needs time. I honor that. That makes this situation that much more difficult, especially since he lives 4 miles away from me. 

Has anyone been in the situation and the other parent came around? Any advice on reaching out? I’ll be meeting up for coffee with 3 of my cousins… I hope I can meet more of my family and maybe eventually he will come around.

I fully plan on going but I would like to talk to the priest at coffee hour afterwards to talk to him about being catechized. This church would be a perfect fit for me since it’s only 15 minutes from my parents house where I live in the summer, and the priest also runs the Orthodox Christian chapter at my university so it works out really well. I just have really bad social anxiety and I’m super afraid to go to the church alone, especially since it’s smaller.

In some restaurants, I've experienced discrimination in the form of gaslighting, with staff mentioning all sorts of excuses that disqualify me from availing a discount (i.e. the food is already discounted when it's not, only one item can be discounted when it's all for my cosumption). I also experience insensitivity of staff that exhibits loud, rowdy behavior and horseplay when I am dining, even if I have explained to them that my disability causes me extreme distress with loud noise. Naming and shaming some of these establishments because we must hold them accountable to abiding by laws and creating inclusive environments for their customers. Please help me add to the list.

DISCRIMINATORY PWD ESTABLISHMENTS
1. Cara Cafe - discounts only one item
2. Rico's Lechon - claims their meals are already discounted
3. Nanyang - charged my card double to make up for the discount. Said it was a mistake, told me they would refund it, but never did.
4. Mylene's Bakeshop - discounts only the cheapest item
5. Ukiyo Tavern - waitstaff became hostile to me when I asked very politely if they could turn down the noise while horseplaying
6. Ginza BGC - waiter ignored me although he was responsive to everyone else. I kept calling his attention to the point where everyone in the restaurant already noticed except him. As a passive-aggressive retort, he ""accidentally"" poured water on my laptop.

Also, avoid any establishment with a ""No to Fake PWD IDs"" sign. They would rather disenfranchise an entire minority than do their due diligence of verifying PWD IDs and lose a few hundred pesos from actual offenders.

And here are the PWD-friendly establishments I've been to:

1. Filtrante Coffee - full discount. Staff keeps things that I accidentally left when dissociated and returned them to me.
2. Tuantuan Chinese Brasserie - attentive staff. They prioritized bringing me water and tissue even without me asking.
3. Dohtonbori - they helped me find a quiet, private table where I would less likely be distressed
4. Fat Seed - they help me find good seats and electrical sockets. Stayed open past their closing one time when I had difficulty packing my stuff

1. I really would like to rotate the rug but it would go into the walkway leading to the kitchen and bedroom. 

2. The wall facing the couch is two feet shorter, so I’ve centered the tv console with the couch and that’s why it looks so pushed up to the wall.

3. The mirror is the perfect height, but maybe the one I bought was too small and probably made the perspective look off. I would like to put clutter decor around it though, any suggestions on style?

4. I’m not sure what style we’re going for, but we absolutely adore the couch and rug. Should we get a coffee table? Ottoman? And any recommendations for a nice armchair? 

5. The tv console area is a work in process, we’re kinda just spending money on essential furniture. We’ll get to it eventually. 

6. The cat tree (and cat) stay, no questions asked. She will not leave that thing. 

7. I want to add plants and we’ve been looking all over and we’ll be getting some, I’m just not sure what yet. I’m not much of a plant guy, but me and my wife thought about getting an aquarium and I’ve kept fish for years. 

8. Money. If we can get away with good looking, yet cheap decor we will do. Owning an apartment in SoCal is expensive. 

9. I’m British, and I want to have some home comforts. The cushion was one. Any way to bring that in without making it look tacky?

These commodities are traded on specialized exchanges where traders speculate on price movements based on global demand and supply factors. If you're considering entering this exciting world, understanding how commodity trading works and how to get started can help you make informed decisions and navigate potential risks.

# Understanding the Basics of Commodity Market Trading

The term [**commodity market trading**](https://kanakmarkets.com/) refers to the exchange of raw materials such as oil, gold, wheat, and other primary goods. Commodities are typically categorized into two main types: hard commodities and soft commodities. Hard commodities include natural resources like crude oil, metals (gold, silver, copper), and energy products, while soft commodities refer to agricultural products like grains, coffee, cotton, and livestock.

The goal of commodity trading is to profit from price fluctuations in these goods. Traders can buy commodities when they believe prices will rise, or sell them when they expect prices to fall. The trading can occur through various financial instruments such as futures contracts, options, and exchange-traded funds (ETFs).

# How Commodity Market Trading Works

Commodity trading is generally carried out on commodity exchanges, such as the Chicago Mercantile Exchange (CME), the New York Mercantile Exchange (NYMEX), and the London Metal Exchange (LME). These platforms provide a regulated environment for buying and selling commodities. Prices are determined by factors like market demand, geopolitical events, weather conditions, and economic reports.

For example, the price of oil may rise due to tensions in oil-producing regions, or wheat prices could fluctuate depending on crop yields and global demand. Traders use various tools to analyze these market factors, helping them predict price movements and determine the best times to buy or sell.

Futures contracts are the most common form of commodity trading. These contracts allow traders to agree to buy or sell a specific quantity of a commodity at a predetermined price and date in the future. This can be highly speculative, as traders aim to capitalize on price changes that happen before the contract expires.

# Key Benefits of Commodity Market Trading

1. **Diversification**: Trading in commodities can be a way to diversify an investment portfolio. Since commodity prices often do not correlate directly with stock market trends, they can help reduce overall portfolio risk during market downturns.

2. **Hedge Against Inflation**: Many investors view commodities, particularly precious metals like gold, as a hedge against inflation. When currency values drop, the value of gold and other commodities tends to rise, providing a store of wealth.

3. **Profit Potential**: Commodity markets can be volatile, meaning there are significant opportunities for profit. Whether through long-term investments or short-term trading, the potential for high returns exists.

4. **Liquidity**: Commodity markets, especially those for well-known goods like crude oil, gold, and silver, are typically very liquid, meaning you can buy or sell large quantities with ease.

# How to Get Started with Commodity Market Trading

Getting started in commodity market trading requires careful planning and understanding of the market dynamics. Here’s a step-by-step guide to help you begin:

# 1. Understand the Basics

Before you start trading commodities, it's essential to understand the basics of how these markets work. Begin by learning about the different types of commodities, how they are priced, and what factors influence their prices. Follow global market trends, news, and reports that can impact commodity prices, such as crop reports, production levels, and political instability in key producing regions.

# 2. Choose a Trading Platform

To begin [**commodity trading**](https://kanakmarkets.com/commodity-trading/), you'll need to choose a reliable and reputable trading platform. Many online brokers offer access to commodity markets, where you can trade a variety of commodities through futures contracts, options, and ETFs. When selecting a platform, ensure it provides the necessary tools and resources, such as real-time market data, charting tools, and customer support.

# 3. Open a Trading Account

Once you've chosen a platform, you will need to open a trading account. Most brokers require you to submit basic information, verify your identity, and deposit funds before you can start trading. It's important to choose a broker that provides sufficient educational resources and has a user-friendly interface, especially if you're new to commodity market trading.

# 4. Develop a Trading Strategy

Commodity trading is not a passive activity; it requires a well-thought-out strategy. Your strategy should consider your risk tolerance, financial goals, and the type of commodities you're interested in trading. Some traders prefer to focus on long-term trends, while others may prefer more active, short-term trading to capitalize on immediate price fluctuations. Either way, it's important to have a clear strategy and stick to it.

# 5. Start with a Demo Account

Before you begin live trading, it's wise to practice with a demo account. Many trading platforms offer simulated environments where you can trade with virtual money. This will allow you to familiarize yourself with the platform and understand how commodity market trading works without the risk of losing real money.

# 6. Analyze the Market

Successful commodity traders spend a lot of time analyzing the market. You’ll need to stay updated with market news, geopolitical events, and economic reports that could impact commodity prices. Fundamental analysis, which looks at supply and demand, is important, but technical analysis, which involves charting and studying past price movements, can also provide valuable insights.

# 7. Start Small and Manage Your Risk

When you’re ready to begin live trading, it’s advisable to start small. Many platforms allow you to trade in smaller lots or with leverage, which means you can control larger positions with a smaller capital outlay. However, leverage can magnify both your profits and losses, so it’s crucial to use it cautiously. Always set stop-loss orders to limit potential losses and manage your risk effectively.

# 8. Keep Learning

Commodity markets are constantly evolving, so it's essential to continue learning as you trade. Follow market trends, attend webinars, and read books or articles on commodity market trading to improve your skills and strategies over time. Additionally, staying informed about global economic conditions and news will help you anticipate market movements and make more educated decisions.

# Conclusion

Commodity trading offers vast opportunities for profit, but it comes with its share of risks. By understanding how commodity markets function, selecting the right trading platform, and developing a sound strategy, you can increase your chances of success. Starting with small investments, continuous learning, and disciplined risk management will be key to navigating this dynamic market. Whether you're looking to diversify your portfolio or hedge against inflation, commodity market trading can be an exciting and rewarding venture for those who take the time to understand the market and its nuances.",1,1733028269.0,u_NileshKasurde,0,1.0,False
1h3vent,https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/1h3vent/the_deerman/,The Deerman ,"Julie knew the three-hour drive from Burberry to the North Woods First Nations reserve all too well. Highway 13 stretched out for miles before merging onto Highway 6. She made a quick pit stop in Hollowsville, a quaint paper mill town, for a much-needed coffee and bathroom break, then continued. The rocky landscape between Hollowsville and her childhood home in the Northern Woods was always stunning in the fading twilight – her mother loved to call them the Wajiwiinsan (Little Mountains) in Ojibwe. Even with the trees bare, the scenery was a spectacular sight and a refreshing change from the city's smog and busy traffic.

Julie stopped at the small bridge connecting the mainland to the island, and idled patiently, waiting for the light to change. During the busy summer months, the bridge swung open every hour to accommodate an influx of large seasonal boats. But in November, just after sunset, it appeared deserted, as did the sleepy town of Little River that lay just beyond it. Her phone beeped in the seat next to her, a text message.

**Mom:** ""Watch out for deer on the road! Love you.""

Julie's thumbs moved deftly over the keypad: ""No worries. See you soon. Xo.""

Driving alone at night made her acutely aware of her solitude. The occasional flicker of wildlife eyes was the only break in the emptiness. Then, about a half mile ahead, she spotted something enormous standing in the middle of the road; a buck, the biggest she'd ever seen. The car slowed to a complete stop a safe distance away, and she peered over the dash, surveying him carefully. He was tall and magnificent. Antlers stretched majestically upward from his head, looking regal and poised like a picture frozen in time.

Julie nodded. ""Boozhoo, Waawashkesh,"" she said with a tone of respect. His gaze fixed somewhere beyond the glare at the windshield, a sight that sent an inexplicable shiver down Julie's spine. Then, suddenly, the buck sprang toward her; the sickening thud of his body collapsing against the hood was followed by the shattering of her windshield. Glass pieces peppered her skin as his antlers thrust through the broken glass, mere inches from her face. Lydia screamed in terror as she pushed back in the seat as far as she could. Her hand fumbled with the door; there was an awful grinding sound as it shimmied it open. The buck's convulsions caused the hood to groan under its weight. It stared blankly, eyes bloodied and bulging in a way that would haunt her forever.

Julie stumbled out onto the roadway and into a pair of oncoming headlights. A horn blared loudly, causing her heart to jump. She lunged out of the way as the other vehicle flew past and came to a screeching halt. She collapsed onto the cold pavement.

The last thing she saw was a blurry shape approaching, and a man's warbled voice spoke as she faded into unconsciousness, ""Miss? Miss? Are you alright? Help is on the way.""

\---

The rattle of a med cart and the murmur of voices outside her room jolted her out of a nightmare. When she opened her eyes, the images floated, impressed like a misty mirage before her. But instead of a deer, a young man about her age stood there unflinching against a vast, empty darkness with his arms folded across his chest. ""Lora,"" his voice echoed like a chant in a big room. The car rushed toward him. The brakes were failing; she couldn't stop the collision from happening.

""Miss Wabigwan?"" Nurse Lumley's voice broke through the haze. Julie blinked, and the dream dissipated like a fine mist. She struggled to sit up, wincing at the stiffness in her neck.  

""Your neck is giving you trouble, huh?""

Julie nodded. ""Yes, where am I?""

Still groggy, she looked around the room and realized it was a hospital room.

""We'll get you something for the pain in a minute. And you're at Little River Hospital. They brought you in late last night. The medics said you hit a *deer* on the road."" She said it in a way that implied that Julie was lucky to be alive.

The deer. Julie remembered it all now. The deer had charged at her. ""Yeah, he came at me."" Gingerly, she touched the cuts on her face, wincing.

Nurse Lumley offered a sympathetic smile. ""Well, you're safe now, dear, and don't you worry about those nasty cuts; they'll be gone in no time.""  

Julie's mother, Mary walked into the room, carrying two large coffees in a tray. ""Good, you're awake."" She set the tray on the bedside table and sat next to her.

Nurse Lumley finished fluffing and straightening the pillows. ""There, all nice and comfy now."" She straightened. ""The doctor's going to be in soon to see you. Click the button if you need anything in the meantime."" She pointed to the call button at Julie's side. Julie nodded, and the nurse departed.

Her mom opened the tabs on both coffees, letting the steam escape. Julie rested back against the pillows.

""So how are you feeling, Julie?"" her mother looked her over, concern etching lines across her face. As a young widow and single mother, her daughter's well-being was always her main priority. There had been many uphill struggles along the way. However, Julie had grown into a beautiful young woman only months away from her bachelor's degree in creative writing; Mary couldn't have been prouder.

Julie thought carefully for a moment, ""Well, to be honest, Mom, I feel like I've been run over by a tow truck."" They both chuckled. ""But now I really just want to get out of here and go home.""

""Well, just wait for the doc to come in and look you over first,"" Mary winked.

As if right on cue, Doctor Swanson strode into the room, wearing a standard white coat with a clipboard clutched in his hand.

""Hello,"" he said, sounding almost chipper, setting the clipboard on the counter beside him before leaning against it casually. ""So, how are we feeling this morning, Julie?"" She noticed his lacklustre blue eyes, a clear sign of sleepless hours. She knew that look all too well, having spent many sleepless nights focused on her studies, living on coffee and cigarettes just to get by. Still, she had to credit him for at least trying to sound upbeat.

""I could be better, but I think I'm okay.""

""Well. Good, let's take a look then."" He walked over and applied gentle pressure to Julie's neck and back. She tried to not wince at the tender parts. When finished, he stepped back and thoughtfully weighed in on the evidence before passing final judgment. ""You may have some neck stiffness for a little while, but pain meds should take care of that, and plenty of rest."" He cast a side glance at Julie's mother, undoubtedly knowing she'd see to that.

Nurse Lumley re-entered, holding a small pill cup and a glass of water. ""Sorry, doctor, but an officer is waiting outside to speak to Julie."" She placed the pills and water down, then turned on her heel to exit.

""Well, I guess that's my cue to leave. Take care, Julie, and if anything comes up, then just come back.""

Julie downed her meds and then nodded. ""I will.""

Officer Josh Miigizi came in after Dr. Swanson left. Julie's face lit up. ""Josh!"" she exclaimed

""Hey Julie, long time no see."" He smiled warmly, then turned and nodded at her mom, ""Mrs. Waabigwan.""  

""Aanii Josh, come on in."" She nodded back and smiled; it made her heart glad to see Julie smiling again. Then she got up and conveniently excused herself to find a washroom so they could talk. Julie patted a clear spot on her bed next to her. ""come, sit,"" she commanded.

They spent the next while discussing the details of the accident at length for the report. They then graciously moved on to lighter subjects, like what's been transpiring in their lives up to the present. Julie gave him a quick three-minute summary about her pursuing a Creative Writing degree in Burry, a three-hour commute away. Josh shared he had joined the police force right after high school and returned to the island after his father's passing. He'd inherited his dad's house and lived there ever since.

""Hey, how about I swing by with coffee tomorrow? We can catch up some more.""

Julie nodded, a hint of a smile on her lips. ""Sure, why not?"" They quickly exchanged cell numbers. Suddenly, Josh's police radio crackled at his side; he immediately answered it and then had to leave in a hurry.

Moments later, Mary reappeared, looking more refreshed. ""Well? Are you ready to go, daughter?""

""Absolutely!"" Julie carefully got up to get ready. The pills eased the discomfort but some stiffness remained.

\---

It was good to be back on the rez again; on the way home, they stopped at Mogey's Variety just past two o'clock corner for some groceries and snacks. The sky was a slate grey; its smooth surface stretched for miles without a break in the cloud surface. It gave the land and the leafless trees a shadowy, colourless feel. Julie wished she had brought her sketchbook and pencils along for the trip.

""You need anything else before we go home?"" Her mom interrupted her reverie as she fiddled with the music playlist, trying to get it to play again.

""We're in the dead zone, Mom; you'll have to wait a few secs for the sound to kick in again,"" Julie pointed upward, signifying there was no service.

Oh, yeah, that's right, you'd think I'd remember that by now,"" her mom said, relaxing back into her seat again. Sure enough, the music automatically resumed playing only moments later.

The house seemed quiet, as if it were asleep. Her uncle's dog, Benji, from next door, waited near the front steps, his tail wagging cheerfully.

""Awe, Benji,"" her mom's tone was soft-spoken.

Benji waited for the car to park before circling around to greet Julie. She patted him gently. He was old in years, but still a happy boy, nonetheless.

The door was left unlocked like it usually was during the day, and the familiar scent of cinnamon air freshener told her she was home. Her mom headed to her room to put her purse away, calling back over her shoulder, ""Oh, before I forget, Josh dropped off your bag last night; it's by the couch."" Julie sighed with immense relief; her laptop and favourite books were in that bag, including a couple of first editions.

It had been quiet that night, and yet she couldn't sleep; the images of the accident kept seeping back into her thoughts. She remembered the name ""Lora"" and wondered what it all meant. She flipped over to her other side, facing the bookshelf, and spotted the pack of smokes she had left stashed on the second shelf a month ago. It rested on her copy of 'Bear Walker,' she slid one out.

Even though it had been a month since she quit, she couldn't resist the urge to have just one, especially now after the deer and car accident. And then the haunting nightmare, to boot. The whole thing was just too eerie for words. The first drag was the best; it made her feel grounded and connected to the present moment, as did the cold night. She thought about what Josh had said at the hospital. Maybe he was right; perhaps the car lights spooked the deer into panic, and it lost all direction. It really was the only reasonable explanation, the only one that made any sense, anyway. Her phone bleeped in her pocket. It suddenly occurred that she hadn't checked her messages since yesterday. Josh's name appeared on the screen: Hey, hope you all settled in. How about I drop by with coffee around 1ish tomorrow?

**Julie**: Sure! I take mine, black. :)

**Josh:** Okay, see ya then. ;)

SNAP. Julie jumped with a start, nearly dropping her phone. Her eyes immediately scanned the darkness for whatever it was. The hairs on her neck prickled up; she had the uncanny sensation of being watched. Her cigarette had burnt down to the nub, singing her fingers. She shook her hand and winced, then hurried back into the house, locking the doors behind her.

A tall figure stood out from the shadows, unaffected by the cold. Watching the house, his attention immediately drawn to the window where a single light was lit in one room; a woman's slender silhouette grazed by the curtains, and then the light went out.

\---

The savoury scent of bacon sizzling and freshly brewed coffee pulled Julie from sleep. Again, she'd been dreaming of 'him' - the attractive man with dark hair and deep-set eyes, only this time he motioned for her to follow him into dense woods. In the peaceful scene behind him, colourful birds took flight, and a young fawn, its large brown eyes sparkling with innocence, darted amongst the sun-dappled trees. The dream felt so real; she reached out with a pang of yearning to follow him into those woods. Yet, like water between her fingers, the dream slipped away, leaving only the ache of wanting.

During breakfast, her mom spoke enthusiastically about a gathering she was heading to this morning with the aunties, and she invited Julie to tag along with them. She declined her mom's offer, explaining that she had already made plans to spend the day with Josh. Mary playfully nudged her daughter, insinuating that they might wind up becoming a thing. Julie laughed. Though Josh was good-looking, the idea of dating right now seemed ludicrous. Since the beginning of her studies, there was little time to think about anything else. Period.

That afternoon, Josh and Julie took a leisurely stroll through the woods behind the house with coffees in hand. The sun glared in the clear November sky, casting a cool haze over everything. ""So, how are ya today? Still hurtin?""

Instinctively, Julie touched her neck. ""Well, the pills help a bit; it's not that bad now,"" she replied.

""Good."" He kicked a stone out of the path and kept walking.

She continued, ""I haven't slept too well the past couple of days, though.""

""Really? Why's that?"" He glanced at her briefly, then took a sip of coffee; steam rose, mingling with his breath.

""It's nothing major, really."" She shrugged, then took a swig from her own cup; three-quarters of the way done, she could feel the effects of the caffeine already kicking in, giving her a slight energy boost..

""Come on, just lay it out."" He nudged her encouragingly.

They stopped at a large fallen tree and sat down in the middle. That's when Julie opened up about her dreams and the mysterious deerman. When she finished, she downed the rest of her coffee and gazed thoughtfully out at the trees. Waiting for his response.

Finally, after a moment or two, he spoke. ""This man you're dreaming about reminds me of a story my grandpa Joe told me a few years back when we were out at his camp.""

Julie's interest suddenly piqued. ""Oh yeah? I don't think I've heard it. How does it go?""

He shivered in his jacket. ""Well, how about we head back, and I'll tell you on the way?""

She nodded, ""Deal.""

Waashkesh Nini

On a fall day back in the 70s, a chilling presence settled over the reserve. Word started spreading throughout the community: reports of an unusually large deer, unlike anything seen before. The first sighting happened in the woods just behind the apartment complex at the southern end of the community.

Hoofprints left behind, undeniably from an animal, like a deer or an elk, but much larger than that. The elders talked in quiet voices; their weathered faces etched with concern. A spirit animal, a visitor from the unknown.

Some villagers believed the deer was a kind of protector, while others viewed it as evidence of sorcery at play or a shapeshifter. Suspicion rippled through the tranquil reserve of what or who it could be.

One quiet evening, a young native woman named Lora stood outside her home wrapped in a wool blanket, as she so often did, to gaze up at the stars. Lately, a kind of loneliness had settled over her life.

At twenty-two, she lived alone in a house inherited from her late grandmother. Being adopted at the young age of three, she had no memories of her real birth family, and her shyness always made it difficult to get to know people. More than anything, she craved companionship and romance. Lora often wished for a handsome, tall man to come into her life and sweep her off her feet.

The following Saturday, after the sun sank over the horizon, Lora sat on the deck again with a cup of steeped tea, this time gazing at the distant glow of the local dancehall. She imagined people dancing there and having fun under the glowing lights and wondered what it must be like.

""If only someone would ask me to the dance,"" she whispered to the evening breeze, ignoring her late grandmother's wise counsel to always be careful what she wished for. Instead, whether or not she realized it, Lora sent her intent out into the void of all things. Her invitation beckoned to a place deep in the woods where the oldest things still lived. A shooting star trailed across the sky like a silver ribbon, and she felt a warm energy begin in the pit of her stomach. A familiar yearning emerged.

That evening, as she lay in bed staring at the tiled ceiling, images of couples dancing filled her mind. ""…handsome man,"" she murmured before drifting into a restless sleep. The stillness of the night thickened with anticipation. An intrusive rapping on her door echoed through her dreams like thunder. Lora jerked awake. It was strange for anyone to visit this late, but out of curiosity, she pulled on her shawl, cautiously approached the door, and turned on a light.

As the door swung open, she gasped in surprise. Before her stood, undoubtedly, the most attractive man she'd ever laid eyes on, his skin a warm tan, his eyes gleaming like polished obsidian. An air of mystery surrounded him.

""Hey, I'm Devin,"" he said, a charming smirk playing on his lips. ""I know it's *really* late, but I'm trying to get to a dance hall. Could I bother you for directions?"" A crop of dark hair fell over his eyes as though it were deliberate, catching. The fading light.

Lora swooned slightly and wondered if this was all a dream. A handsome man shows up at her door late at night, asking for directions. A feeling of doubt niggled at the pit of her stomach.

She suddenly remembered stories her grandmother told of mysterious, handsome young men in black who would seduce women and take them, never to be seen again.   

""Uh, look, I'm not up for going anywhere tonight. ,""Sorry, I can't help you,"" Lora replied hesitantly and started closing the door. His gaze locked onto hers with a magnetic pull. He stepped closer, and a mysterious air of energy hung around him. ""You should come to the dance with me. It'll be fun. Just forget everything else."" In that instant, the energy shifted, enveloping her in a heady aura of intoxicating and alluring magnetism. He was… irresistible. Lora felt her resolve melting away. ""Okay… I'll go,"" she said, despite the smallest protest in the back of her mind. I'll get ready.

As they climbed into his shiny, black pickup truck and drove off, her mind was floating lost somewhere in a white fog on the outer fringes of her consciousness, but she could still sense and feel things: the truck jolting along the dirt road, the smell of the vehicle's interior, and the warmth of a man's rough worn hand intermingled in hers. A single memory fragment floated past, and her mind latched on, holding fast. And then she remembered something. Devin. It's Devin, and then it all faded to black.

\---

As they arrived at the dance hall, her earlier memories had all but faded and been replaced by new ones: Devin knocked on the door, asking for directions. They hit it off, and then he graciously invited her to the dance, and she happily accepted.

The thrum of music pulsed from the speakers; under the warm lantern glow, the dance floor was alive with people adorned in cowboy hats and boots, moving and swaying with the music. Lora felt an overwhelming thrill in Devin's presence. Tonight, she felt like the prettiest woman in the room. As they moved across the dancefloor, all eyes drew to them. Women watched with envious sighs while men regarded Lora with looks of admiration.

Yet unease flickered to life within her as the night went on. She noticed Devin's eyes had changed–more comprehensively, with a new glint of darkness lurking in their depths. The atmosphere in the room shifted, but Lora tried to brush it all off as a side effect of the music. Still, an inexplicable tension now hung in the air; it was tangible enough that even the other dancers sensed something was off kilter.

As the music died, their dancing slowed to a stop. Devin leaned in close and whispered in her ear, ""Midnight's almost here. Time for us to go."" She broke free from his embrace and stepped back, confused. ""What do you mean? She turned and glanced at the clock, both hands now pointed to Midnight.

""Oh, oh. Too late!"" His tone dripped with amusement as he took a few steps back.

The crowd had now cleared a circle around them. In that instant, Devin's body contorted and shifted where a man once stood; a hideous creature now emerged. Antlers spawned grotesquely from his head, casting eerie shadows across the dance hall. His feet twisted into hooves and clattered noisily against the wooden floor as he took two steps towards Lora. Fear descended, replacing the buoyant atmosphere and sending ripples of horror through the crowd. Lora stumbled back in terror and awe.

The crowd erupted in utter panic. The frantic rush to get away turned the space into a scene of chaos. People stumbled into one another, sending fall harvest decorations and balloons twirling and swaying wildly in their mad rush to escape. Lora remained frozen, torn between fear and the haunting sense of connection she felt with this strange creature that now stood before her.

Devin looked around pleasantly, pleased, his arms raised to address an empty room. ""Ah, good. Now that we're alone. We can talk.""

""Wha… what?"" she asked, her voice croaking shakily. Then she cleared it and tried again to sound steadier this time."" What is it you want?""

""You've experienced the night's enchantment, but now I want something in return.""

Panic rose in Lora as the weight of his words settled in. She dared to ask,

""What is it?""

""You."" He mused. ""I have travelled far and wide to find a woman like you who will balance me. Someone worthy,"" he said. ""Come with me now. You will never be alone again.""

A wave of dread washed over her at the thought of being tied to Devin, a sorcerer and shapeshifter. Trembling, she stepped back and shouted, ""No!"" struggling to stay calm. ""I won't go with you!""

Devin's expression shifted from amusement to fury as the lights flickered. A hearty laugh reverberated off the walls of the dance hall.

""You dare refuse me, Lora? You'll face the consequences.""

 

""No one will love you, Lora. You'll always be alone, just like you always have been.""

 

Summoning all her courage, Lora declared, ""If I'm going to love someone, then it should be of my own choosing, not anyone's or any *thing* else'*s*.""

She turned on her heel and pushed through the hall doors, running out into the night. It no longer held any of its magic for her. Looming shadows seemed to stretch and stretch, morphing into eerie shapes. She could hear strange noises, rustling in the trees, and the familiar sound of hooves crunching on gravel from behind her, getting closer. Frightened, she ran on, never daring to look back.

Suddenly, to her great relief, a set of blurry car lights came into view half a mile down the road. Lora waved her hands frantically in the air until the vehicle slowed to a stop. Sweating and breathless, she stumbled over to the passenger side, glanced over her shoulder, and got in. As the car turned around, her eyes briefly scanned the road in the headlights, but thankfully, there was no sign of the creature anywhere.

 

After arriving home, she thanked the driver and got out. A wave of relief washed over her as she walked down the driveway. The familiar sight of the house, filled with precious memories of her grandmother, was a great comfort. Standing beneath the moon's glow, Lora realized, at that moment, that love wasn't merely something to wish for but a journey of self-discovery that she'd have to undertake to truly understand.

She began her first week of school at a nearby college a month later. The first bell buzzed as she slammed her locker shut. She rushed down the hall late for her first class, incidentally, colliding with another student exiting a room from the right. Books flew off in all directions.

""Oh, my god. I'm so sorry, ""a young man, Lora's age, glanced down apologetically. Without looking, she quickly bent to retrieve the textbooks.

The young man squatted beside her, grabbed one, and handed it back. ""Uh, here you go,"" he said nervously.

She looked down at the hand holding the book and raised her eyes to meet his. She noted their colour, sea green---her favourite color.

""Thanks,"" she replied shyly and took it.

""Um, I'm Stephen,"" he extended his right hand.

""Lora,"" she smiled.  

 

 

""The End.""

""Wow,"" Julie exclaimed. Clapping. ""That is an amazing story!""

Josh grinned, ""yeah, Gramps always was a skilled storyteller.""

Julie nodded thoughtfully. ""The story… it's not real, though, is it?""

According to Gramps, it happened back in the 70s; the girl Lora supposedly died in a car accident two years after it happened; it was long before we were born. In fact, you are living two houses away from where she did, Josh said matter-of-factly. He stopped and turned to face her; his expression was quizzical. ""You really never knew?""

Julie's eyebrows shot up in surprise. ""Uh, no,"" she replied, her voice inflecting slightly, ""I had no idea. And the name Lora. That's the name I heard in my dream.""

""Yeah, I know,"" Josh said and grew silent. They continued walking, each lost in their own quiet reflection.

Josh stopped dead in his tracks twenty meters from the woods' edge. His eyes riveted to the ground; with a murmured exclamation, he sank into a crouch.

""Why did you stop?"" Julie asked, coming to stand beside him. Josh hadn't replied, his attention focused on the ground. She traced his gaze to where he'd cleared away some leaves, revealing large hoofprints.

""Oh, my goodness."" Julie followed his lead and hunkered down to study the outline of the prints more closely. She splayed her hand over it; it was almost a perfect fit. Slowly, their eyes met, then turned to look at the house. Together, they brushed some more twigs and dried leaves out of the way, searching for more evidence of prints, but found none.

""How can that be?"" Josh asked, dumbfounded. They both exchanged bewildered glances.

Julie shook her head. ""That's so weird.""

""Julie, "" her mother called out to her, carrying an arm full of groceries in from the car. They both rose to their feet and walked back in silence.

Later that evening, **Josh texted:** Hey, my grandfather is back home from out west. You should come out for a visit. He brought back some homemade elk jerky! ;)

Julie knew that Josh's grandpa was a respected elder in the community.

It had been a long time since she'd sat with an elder. Amidst the growing peculiarities in her life lately, now was probably a good time as any to seek wisdom again.

**She texted back:** Okay, I'll be there soon.

With a trade blanket and some tobacco, Julie snuck out quietly and set off down the highway in her mother's car to Josh's grandfather's place on Mukwa Road. Just past Miigwan's Variety Store, the darkness suddenly thickened with unexpected fog. It seemed surreal to see fog in mid-November, but climate change was worsening. Julie slowed her speed, moving cautiously through the formless shapes in the mist. Until one shape became more solid and took the familiar form of a man. He stood off to the side of the road and waved his hand to get her attention. Despite her initial wariness, he seemed non-threatening and claimed to be headed in the same direction. Acting against her better judgment, perhaps because of sympathy, she gave him a ride.  

Julie dared a quick glance at him, her eyes refocused back on the road. There was something vaguely familiar about the guy, though she was sure she'd never seen him before. He looked young, about her age. Even with his mussed hair partially swept over his eyes, she could tell he was a handsome Nish, mysterious, and kind of sexy; her mind wandered, entertaining thoughts she hadn't had since school began. ""So, uh, what's your name?"" she asked, trying to keep her mind from lingering in places it probably shouldn't be.

His voice then dropped to a mumble; words indistinguishable as his hands moved as though they were signing in a type of unknown language. A wave of dizziness swept over Julie, and her skin became flushed.

They came to a fork in the road. ""Turn left here,"" he gestured toward a deserted dirt road opposite her turnoff. Though it was out of her way, she did as she was told, an inexplicable pull guiding her hands on the wheel.

""Stop here,"" he commanded. Julie pulled off to the side of the deserted road. It was pitch black out, and no other vehicles were in sight. Unable to move, Julie could only wait for whatever dark fate awaited her. From her peripheral vision, the man beside her appeared to be nothing more than a blurry shape in dark clothing, his face obscured by the shadows.

In the eerie silence that hung there between them, her phone rang, the high, shrill buzz temporarily breaking the spell of enchantment. She seized the moment to escape and flung open the car door and ran for the trees, her feet splashing through a partially frozen puddle. The cold water prickled at her damp feet, but she didn't care.

""Lora,"" He called out behind her. You can run but won't get away from me this time.""

Thin branches whipped at her face, stinging the newly healed cuts on her cheeks as she rushed further into the trees; the frozen earth crunched beneath her feet. Darkness engulfed her. She tripped on a loose deadwood in the path and fell to the ground with a thud. The earth felt cold and rough beneath her. Quickly, she struggled to her feet, leaning against an old oak for support. Its cold, twisted bark pressed to her back as she struggled to ascertain her thoughts. Why did he call her Lora? Was there any truth to this? Doubt crept into her thoughts. Or was this all an illusion? A cruel sorcerer's trick.

""Lora, there's no use hiding."" He called out.

With each step into the woods, the man's body shifts and contorts. His limbs lengthen, his torso narrowing as he takes on the tall, muscled form of a deerman. His transformation into a half-man, half-deer creature is a blend of flesh and wilderness magic. Branches cracked beneath the weight of his hooves as he came to stand in an open space 15 meters away from where Julie hid. Steam snorted through his nostrils as he turned his head, sniffed the air, and continued disappearing into the foliage.

She clung to the tree, desperate to keep from sight. Her heart pounded furiously, threatening to burst from her chest.

Three miles down the road, in a rustic log cabin beneath a tin roof, an elderly man sat before an open altar of sacred items; he picked up the turtle shell rattle handed down through generations and grasped it in his weathered hand. The rattle shakes, and he chants in a low, raspy voice, singing from his heart centre, imploring the ancestors to help shield Julie. The potent medicine from the rattle swirls about the cabin and goes forth into the night. In the meantime, Josh had already bolted from the cabin in search of Julie, racing against time to find her before it was too late.

Julie trembled behind the tree; the cold pricked at her toes like sewing needles and stung her blood-stained cheeks, but she dared not move a muscle until it was gone. After a few moments of unsettling silence, she mustered up enough courage to peer out, her eyes strained to see into the trees. When there was no sign of the creature, she made her way out into the open, cautiously looking around so more for fear that it might come back.

Josh peered over the dash in the headlights, looking for any sign of Julie. He spotted a car ahead parked off the roadside, the driver's door ajar. He immediately got out and grabbed his rifle and a flashlight, then ran after the footprints leading into the forest.

Twigs snapped and rustled behind Julie. Her heart leaped as she realized she wasn't alone. Slowly turning, her gaze met two glowing yellow eyes, like separate entities, hovering five feet above her. For the first time, she witnessed the thing chasing her. It was a partial man's body with the head of a deer, complete with gnarled antlers that twisted upward, grotesque and misshapen. His arms were sparsely covered in deer fur and had become more elongated. Looking down, she saw Hooven feet. Julie then screamed in sheer terror at the monstrous being that stood before her in all its horrifying glory. She thoroughly believed that the devil had come to steal her soul.

Joe sang with even greater intensity, his eyes still closed. He shook the rattle vigorously, its high-energy vibrations piercing the ether. Powerful chanting carried through the night to encircle the creature. The spiritual assault had begun; it stumbled back, shaking its enormous head in blind confusion and fury; antlers broke the nearby branches. Josh broke into the clearing, calling Julie in earnest. He spotted her a few feet away from the beast and raised his shotgun, firing a single shot at the creature, grazing its arm. The sound echoed through the night; the monster stumbled back, shrieking in pain. Josh ran to Julie. Dropping the shotgun, he grabbed her in his arms, shielding her.

The aura around the creature shivered and vibrated with preternatural intensity; suddenly, it let out a chilling scream–a horrifying cross between a man's cry and a deer's wail. Julie and Josh clamped their hands over their ears, recoiling from the sound. Then, in frantic desperation, accepting defeat, it bolted, crashing through the underbrush with mad abandon. The Deerman tore through the woods, driven by a primal urge to escape.

Julie collapsed in Josh's arms, and he held her close, rubbing her back with reassurance, ""it's over now, Julie, he said reassuringly, ""It's over.""

""Not this time, Waawasshkesh Nini, not this time,"" Grandpa Joe spoke, seeing that Julie and Josh were together and safe; he lowered his rattle, his face shining from perspiration. He nodded. It is done.

Yesterday I went to the encampment and handed out hot food, granola, vitamin, melatonin, tylenol.

But today I wanted to do something a little different, I had realised I still have about 6 tomatoes left so I put them in a bag and went back to give the camp then gave them a carton of native smokes, and 10 bucks. Then I began my morning adventure to a grocery and grabbed my breakfast then more granolas. I met an unhoused elderly named Noel in a coffee shop, I initially gave him two packs of smokes but he said he would only take one, and I gave him a 5 bucks, we fist bumped. I left to take the bus downtown, and then the street car.

I arrived at a liquor store and saw an elderly with a beer can, so I asked him if he wanted a pack of smoke, and he nodded so I gave him then a 5 bucks, but he wanted another and I gave him, he asked for my name and said his was Josh. I went to the store and grabbed two cans because I felt someone might ask. I walked down the street to a grocery and met Roger, he remembered me from the last time we met, I gave him a pack of smoke and a 5 bucks, we fist bumped.

I continued down the road and met an Asian youth who was crossing the street with a blanket, he seemed like just woke up. I asked if he wanted smoke, he thought I would charge him some amount and hesitated, but I shook my head, and took out a pack of smoke for him and a 5 bucks, I can see tears in his eyes.

I kept walking for a long time until I met three indigenous women, one was on a wheelchair and another was trying to stay warm under a layer of blankets. I gave the first woman a pack of smoke, and she said today is the birthday of the lady in the layer of blankets, I also gave her a pack along with 5 bucks. The two other women would like it also, so I gave them each a 5 bucks. Then I took out two cans of beer and gave to the lady in the blankets and wished her happy birthday. She said she's grateful for my presence. I then kept walking. Then I met an indigenous person standing in the cold, and gave him a pack, he said his name is Lawrence and thanked me, we shaked hand, and I kept walking.

In the busy intersection, I saw a person covered in a sleeping bag in cold, and I put a pack of smoke next to them. Then I saw another youth sitting below a street lamp in the freezing windchill, trying to have an eye shut sleep. I put a pack of smoke, a 5 bucks and a few granolas between their hands. I kept walking and walking until I met Henry and gave him a pack of smoke, he asked if I had two bucks, but I gave him a 5 bucks, he said that he is Chinese and said thank you in Cantonese. We parted way and I kept walking in the cold.

I finally got on a bus and sat right in front of another unhoused person. He was trying to not make eye contact, but I broke the silence and gave him a pack of smokes, then a 5 bucks, and asked if he wanted a can, he nodded. We talked for a while, and he said he's on his way to meet a friend, so I gave him another pack of smokes and another can for his friend. He was so excited. He said his name is Séamus but people around these part called him Baba. We fist bumped and he left the bus, that before he go Baba waved bye to me. I continued my journey to the subway station and saw a person on wheelchair, I walked to them and asked if they wanted smoke, and they said yes, so I gave them a pack, and a 5 bucks. They said their name is Dan but they don't drink.

I was pretty much in to the whole bodybuilding life style (without the steroids) but worked 12 hr shifts and was so tired that i would slam coffee after coffee at work and then abuse pre workout supplements for my gym workout to get through my workouts and doing that for 10 years straight wasn't too kind to the heart. There is no way of knowing what caused my acute pericarditis, but i feel like it was the abuse of pre workout supplements. I would sweat before i even touched the weights, sweat running down my arm while sitting on the bench at the gym without lifting a single weight. I was so addicted to feeling of being hyper with caffeine hits that i drinking coffee before bed would help me sleep lol



I dont know what the future holds, am i going to die an early death without my pericardium in me, will the swelling and water retention leave my stomach/leg/heart/lungs after the surgery, will the heart failure systems disappear? will the heart pump enough blood again? i know i should ask the doctors this and i will on the 4th of  this month as i go in to my pre-admission

Sucks big time =( from never going to the doctor even for a flu to having a major heart surgery... =(

My boyfriend of 1 year+ is suffering from depression and I think it is slowly taking toll on mine. I sometimes feel I am compromising my own needs so he can deal with his. There are times when I thought about breaking up with him for my own sanity but instantly feel bad about it as I understand the reason why he’s incoherent sometimes. I don’t want to be someone who dumps people when they are at their lowest.

However, some of his actions just don’t sit right with me. 

For example, whenever I invite him out and I need company, he will decline and would say that he is not in the mood or that he doesn’t like to be in crowded places. I understand that and that’s okay with me. However, what really struck me is when I invited him to a coffee shop one time when my mood was very low, he declined as it was far away from their residence (hence, not convenient for him 🫠).

There was also a time when I told him that we should watch THIS film together after his exams and he was just cool with it (I told him how excited I was to watch that film as I really love theatre musicals). I learned later, after their exams, he watched it with his friends.

I received no gift from him during our anniversary (I surprised him with a bouquet of flowers, a cake, and a book) and my birthday (I gave him my painting he really liked during his). I already told him some time these are big events for me (including Christmas) 🥹

Though, other than those things I’ve mentioned, he is all goods. I sometimes feel being the red flag because I still could not introduce him to my whole family (only my sister knows about our relationship) because I am not ready yet (we are both guys lol). But all his family knows me already and I am already comfortable around them.

I am not sure if he does these things unconsciously because he is too absorbed with what he’s struggling with or he is just becoming uninterested with me. I just feel like I’ll be the worse person if I break up with him because of these.

I spend most of my days at home hanging out with the cats, one of whom loves to play fetch. I've loved art ever since I was very young. I have big ambitions to have my own graphic design gig some day, but right now I don't currently work.

I love video games. I got a lot to play on. PS5, Xbox One, Switch, Meta Quest 2, and my iPad. So, like, pretty much everything but PC 😅 I'm a achievements/trophy hunter. I also collect PS1 & 2 games to play on my PlayStation 2. In recent years I've been very casual with my gaming, playing a lot of platformers and survival/crafting games. I'll play a bit of everthing, though, except for, like, sports games.

I love tabletop games. Star Wars Legion, Warhammer 40K/AoS, Magic: The Gathering, Pokémon TCG, Digimon TCG, and Lorcana. I love to paint miniatures as well, but it's a bit of a struggle to actually get people to play with me. Never really gotten the chance to play an TTRPG, but would love to. I suffer from a bit of learning curve.

I love music. Dance Gavin Dance, Papa Roach, Twenty-One Pilots, A Day To Remember, stuff like that. Bit of an elder emo. I wish I could play an instrument, but I fear I may be tone deaf 🙃

I love Marvel. Spider-Man's probably my favorite.

I love Harry Potter. Pretty sure my house is Hufflepuff.

Huge fan of The Office. I've seen the whole series countless times.

I love horror movies and got into true crime on YouTube few years ago. My favorite horror movie is probably The Blair Witch Project, second to the 2003 Texas Chainsaw Massacre. I watched all the SAW movies last month to kick off spooky season, and right now I'm making my way through the Friday the 13th movies.

I love anime and manga. Demon Slayer is by far my favorite. I also really love Fullmetal Alchemist, Attack on Titan, Digimon, Dragon Ball, and Sword Art Online.

I'm doin' a Japanese and a Spanish course on Duolingo right now.

I love baking, coffee, and grilling. I don't have too much confidence in my cooking skills 😅 But I'm trying new recipes all the time. I'm rather adept at baking though, and I love smoked meats 🤤

I want them to know I “see” them and feel heard. Examples: For my best friend’s birthday, every year, I bring her breakfast and coffee in the morning and then her birthday present with her current obsessions, favorite shows, favorite colors and a handwritten, heartwarming card. I even include her cat. For my husband, I usually just listen to him talk about things that he likes/wants and I buy periodically, not just for birthday/Christmas. Just things I know he likes/enjoys and I’ll cook it for him or find that one limited edition thing. Or even just a sweet handwritten, thoughtful card. For my mom & dad, I get them things they find hard to buy for themselves (like a new purse or a nice new jacket or shoes). Sometimes, I bring food over and have lunch/dinner. They really enjoy quality time. Or a sweet handwritten card every so often. Even for my MIL. I got her a custom clover necklace (because she LOVES green & clovers) a custom green sweat shirt with “Grandma” actually sewn in. The gift bag was green, light up green clovers all over. Green flowers, a sweet handwritten card…etc etc. I just feel like I’m really thoughtful with what I get my family &friends and I’ve never received anything “thoughtful”. I am extremely grateful for anything given to me, but it always feels like it was something last minute because they forgot. It never comes with even a note or my name on it. It’s usually a candle. etc. I want to say I don’t “expect” anything from anyone, but once in a while, I’d like to just LOVE the way a gift was put together, or a “just thinking about you”.  SOMETHING. I hope this doesn’t come off as snooty or anything. I really just want to feel seen and heard and I don’t think anyone could answer 10 questions about me. I hate to sound like a brat.

When I was in high school, I used to have a lot of friends. I was a theater and choir student which gave me a really easy way to bond quickly and deeply with a wide range of people. We all shared a common goal and passion which led me to meet a lot of different kids. The same was true when I left home to go to college where I was an acting major. I felt that the bonds I made in college were somehow deeper. I felt such a strong and real feeling of friendship there that I really came to cherish. The problem is that I struggle with a lot of mental health issues that I am currently unmedicated for. In my last month at college, I decided that I needed to step away for a semester which quickly turned to 2 and now it's been 3 years since I left. When I came home I had been away from my high school friends for so long that I found they weren't really my friends anymore. Now, I live too far away from my college friends to connect with them. So I have found myself sufficiently friendless and it is weighing on me so badly. I am so lonely. I long for human connection. I live at home with family so I'm constantly bothering my family members just so I have someone to spend time with. I talk too much at work and annoy customers because I just want someone to connect with. I have boxes full of keepsakes and photos from high school that I cry over remembering what it felt like to have friends. I am not part of any communities or groups and no matter how hard I look I can't find any near me anyways. I feel like I'm at a place in life where I need to make new friends but I have no way to meet new people. The loneliness I feel is beginning to suffocate me. When I was in a common program with people it was so easy to make friends but when it's up to me to connect with people it's like I can't do or say the right things to make people want to stay. I can't help but feel like I'm the problem and there's a reason no one wants to be my friend. I'm 22 years old and I am completely by myself. Being alone with my thoughts every night is exhausting. I miss coffee dates and thrift shopping and laughing over stupid inside jokes and sleepovers. I want that but I'm starting to believe it's something I'll never have again. What do I do?

After a lot of good thought about the state of the forum - Ive decided I will not be stepping down as Founder and Head Mod and I WILL NOT be deleting my Reddit account. 



Around 7-8 days ago my step daughter contacted one of our top mods and what she told him changed my entire mood, attitude, and bad, dark grey cloud lookout on the damn Earth and say on just the rest of everyone else - keep in mind for one minute while your reading the rest of this just remember that I have not talked to this girl my BunnieTrackerz my Baby Chickmunks for close to two years now. Can you even imagine what Hell that puts a father thru? Maybe a few of you here with your kids  can - we do have a few families here lets give a round of applause for u/OneHumanPeOple a mom to be remembered! 

  
So what the Girl Told Me ---- Oh....What the Girl Told ME and What did she say to me?

....She gave the Words the Vessels the Encouragements the Sweet Asks as I call them........Maddies Sweet Asks.....



  
1) DO NOT smoke weed gamble, or do drugs. \[CHECK\] 



2) Get rid of the Voles Reddit \[NOPE\]



3) Get rid of my Reddit account \[NOPE\]



  
I know damn well she (and other users here) thinks Voles is a hellspawn tearing up my brain or rotting it - even caterpillars and what not or  pretty well much maggots at that crawling around - not something she said but a visual from Me to give you a Idea of how she feels this place ruins my head. And at first I almost said yes but I have to say I can not do that at this time I am sorry. Knowing she still cares about me is enough that is what matters to me. If we see each other or not again that is for God to decide, not me. 



I want send a message to my step daughter. Baby Chickmunks if you read this I love you and I want to say with a proud Hello that my mental health has been cured after tonight. This is thanks to users like u/bandgo who are the only damn people who treat me with common human decency and respect and after years of getting harassed, hated on and trolled, well for all of that there are a few good friends out there too I have made. This Voles Reddit is the place for me and you will see honey one day Papa will be better and you can come back and live with me. I am saving thousands of dollars in food bills right now and by early Feb I will have thousands of dollars to remodel your bedroom in the trailer we can put up anything you want Lana del Ray Lorde anything 1975 anything damn thing you want and you can come stay here when you come home from college.

To everyone else who doubted me or wanted me pushed out - I AM NOT GOING ANYWHERE! VOLES.....WE OWN THE DAMN PLANET! 

  
So Act 1 Lets Rid the Filth! Over the last few days this place has been littered with garbage. That is going to change starting December 3rd. u/pronghornenthusiast and me are coming up with many ideas on how to deter trolls including banning at least one user every day. So with that we will need to stock the place up. We are adding several new moderators that will be announced during Voles 1000. Who will they be? Come and find out at 930pm EST. And to Toad - I am the One Owner and Founder of this Place. And if you Cant Get a Grip Around That Go Fxck Off to the West Swamp....

  
Next up. I am promoting u/im_not_davie to Moderator General for taking down Pebblez AKA Gordon Danimals and being the first to put this together months ago. I have always told Davie in mod chats - He is Mr SecretService Alerting GWB of 9/11 and I of course overall am George W Bush in that scenario. One of the smartest men you will ever meet and I am very sorry for the basterds, trolls, and pig guts out there because there is hell to pay and trust me you do not damn want to deal with him. 

  
Second up. u/goblinleg, I am giving Moderator General of r/7eleven to GoblinLeg. I cannot handle that place and this place at the same time one alone is already making me sweat at night. You are the best worker on this forum. Goblinleg is the definitionof the spinning gear on a wheelthat you can only be when...well lets just say when you smoke a special plant....Goblin will show the kids the ropes and watch that place end up being even more popular than Voles. 

  
WOW. Took me 3 hours to write this thing. Heart rate is actually up it has given me a full exercise and very weird but can actually feel every muscle in my skin bending taught with every movement. Its the effect of creatine with my coffee in the morning and at night. For Christmas I asked my nephew for Ghost Energy Creatine havent tried that yet for now its just the cheap stuff for me. Creatine on its own already tastes damn well on its own. 



Lastly I want to say this is the beginning of Bun Butler's Great Voles Reddit. Soon everyone out there will be talking about the Best Animal on the Planet - The Vole! Natures Best Damn Animal! New shirts, new stories....New Mascots, New Pet Voles....NEW EVERYTHING! To quote Elon Musk - It Is Going to Be Amazing!

My girlfriend LOVES Chinese landscape and/or nature paintings - she has several prints throughout her house and she has been searching for a book that has a collection of large, color prints (coffee-table style would be ideal - something similar to what Taschen offers, as an example). Since the holidays are coming up, I thought I'd try my luck as a Christmas present for her.

I've been searching online for books (including Taschen and notable museums - nothing specific to Chinese landscapes or nature anywhere, as far as I can tell). I am planning on searching local bookshops & museums as well. Does anyone have any recommended websites or specific authors I should look for?

I'd buy the book if it just had a section on Chinese landscape/nature paintings as opposed to the whole thing. Any help would be appreciated. I am the exact opposite of an artist (engineer lol) so I am out of my element.

Somewhere that I can sit in a couch for a few hours and do some work or read a book. Some food would be great. Any suggestions anywhere in NJ would be great. ,,1,1733026718.0,newjersey,1,1.0,False

For me I mostly get agitated, I feel like I can fix all my life’s problems and i actually must be able to do anything. My thoughts race, can’t settle on anything and I become activity focused impulsive. Feels like I’ve had about 8 shots of coffee but life is invincible.

On the flip side I also have times where I’m so paranoid. I feel that every person I interact with is judging me, or sometimes even just people I pass. Anxiety to the max, distrustful of everyone even those close to me. A couple of peaks have been hysterically crying locking myself in the bathroom fully convinced my husbands about to harm me, shouting and running out with the car and the only thing that stopped me from buying a case of beer was that I didn’t have my purse, panic attack and sobbing on the shower floor….and the like. These only happen every few months and have reduced since meds but still happen. EDIT: also to add I maintain very little memory of these extreme episodes they’re like a dream and I usually need them recounted to me 

Does this sound familiar to anyone? I’m trying to understand the variations of moods in myself but it’s been helpful reading other experiences on here and feeling not so alone…",5,1733026629.0,bipolar,2,1.0,False
