This expansion matters because it brings authentic Hawaiian coffee culture and premium products to Boulder residents and students, creating a new community gathering space while supporting local employment. For coffee enthusiasts, it offers access to rare Hawaiian-grown beans and unique island-inspired beverages that are typically hard to find outside Hawaii. The opening also signals the growing franchise's national expansion, making premium Hawaiian coffee more accessible across the US while preserving traditional sourcing and roasting methods that maintain quality and cultural authenticity.

1nkixl3,https://www.reddit.com/r/Marriage/comments/1nkixl3/clean_vs_messy_partner/,Clean vs Messy Partner,"I (26F) and my partner (36M) are recently engaged and going to be married. I am having a difficult time addressing this issue to him and would like some advice on how to go about it. 
I am generally a cleaner person, I have my days but two days MAX and everything then will be spotless. I clean so much to the point where it drains me but I can’t help loving a very clean home. My partner is very messy, and it’s not about leaving clothes on the ground or leaving dishes out because he does put things away in the sink, laundry basket etc, but his mess is staining things/chipped furniture etc. We had a period of time where I was gone for two months and when I came back, I just cried from the amount of filth I’ve seen. Not trash on the ground or rotten food, more so of the carpet needing to be replaced, coffee table stained with markers, rusting floor on the balcony, walls having chips and paint coming off. I mean a few window blinds got broken and I asked him what happened with a response of “I’m not sure.” He just doesn’t pay attention I guess to his surroundings but how can I go about this without fighting because anytime this conversation comes up, he gets annoyed and I get annoyed. Sometimes he tells me I’m too OCD but I never lived in a home where I needed to replace furniture every year. I will be traveling often between two states and I’m always worried arriving back because I know something will be in need of replacement. Is this normal or am I overreacting? Advice please.

My friend is also a little anxious and I just want to ensure we’re somewhere that feels comfortable. We’d be meeting up from 2-6pm.

Open to cafes, community spaces and even hotel lounges (where alcohol isn’t the main attraction).

Any suggestions would be really useful, thanks!",1,1758226203.0,london,0,1.0,False

1nkiubf,https://www.reddit.com/r/SuicideBereavement/comments/1nkiubf/2192004/,2.19.2004,"The date is forever in my memory. I was 16 years old when my grandma committed suicide. She was my mom’s mom, and they had a strained relationship and didn’t talk to each other for 5 years. When I was 15, they reconnected and my mom and I went to visit her at her apartment. I ran down the hall to her and gave her a hug. This was summer of 2003, and from then until her death I was attached to her. Nearly every weekend I was at her apartment and we would stay up late watching true crime shows on cable. The last few months she started acting odd but I was also aware at the time that my grandma suffered with mental health problems and assumed maybe she was just feeling down. In hindsight, two separate moments became clear something was wrong- she randomly gave me a piggy bank and some other trinkets, another time out of nowhere she turns to me and asks, “Are you doing okay?” I responded, “Yeah, I’m fine grandma.” One thing that haunted me for years after was not making it to her apartment to celebrate New Years together. 
That day in February my mom, younger brother, and I were out doing some shopping and everything was ordinary. We got home that evening and my mom noticed there was a message on the answering machine. I later find out it was from my grandma but I wasn’t allowed to listen to it. We had missed her call by several hours because a friend of hers called my mom and told her the news. 
My grandma cut the screen in her 2nd floor apartment window and threw herself backward onto the parking lot. I’ll never forget the scream my mom let out. 
A few days later I went with my mom and some relatives to the apartment. I can still see the busted lock when first responders kicked the door in. I can still see the long slash in the screen. I can still see the red snow in the parking lot below. Before entering the apartment, I was praying this was a sick joke and we would walk in and my grandma would be sitting at her little kitchen table with her coffee and cigarette. My prayers weren’t answered. 
More than 20 years has gone by and I haven’t forgotten, but the pain has lessened over time. I still miss her, but I’m grateful I had that time with her. ",1,1758226028.0,SuicideBereavement,0,1.0,False
1nkiub1,https://www.reddit.com/r/Dreams/comments/1nkiub1/relief_dream/,Relief dream,"I found myself in a foreign country where everyone spoke foreign, but I didn’t understand the language. I was following someone, a younger version of a person I usually think of as difficult, and he kept moving so fast I could hardly keep up. Sometimes he disappeared completely, and I had to chase through unfamiliar streets to find him again.

At one point I ended up on a roller coaster, not safely seated but clinging to the edges, trying to step off while it was still moving. Later, while running to get somewhere important, a family appeared in my path, their hands all tangled together, blocking the way. They were a little annoyed, but they didn’t move aside.

Eventually I caught up with the young man. We sat together, and I explained I wasn’t his enemy. He didn’t change instantly, but his fire seemed to soften a little. Around us was a party, full of young, vibrant people of his family moving quickly. Out of nowhere, someone tossed me a cup of coffee from about ten meters away, and to my amazement I caught it without spilling a drop.

All the while, I kept asking what time and day it was. Strangely, the time seemed stuck at exactly 7 p.m. The young man reassured me: “Don’t worry, we can take a day off.”",1,1758226027.0,Dreams,0,1.0,False

Kind of treating this like a retrospective to process the breakup, reflect and really learn something from it. Struggling with whether or not it was toxic vs. abusive and just generally hurting right now. What went wrong and where do I go from here? 


So I welcome feedback, *constructive* criticism, encouraging words, and advice regarding what I’ve shared. And I’m happy to provide more info if asked. Please know I strongly suspect that I’m also neurodivergent, but undiagnosed because of the uh… current climate. 


My relationship with my partner who I suspect lives with undiagnosed autism just ended. I’m fully aware that I’m not anywhere near qualified to formally diagnose anyone, and at the same time I’ve lived with him for two years and have intimate knowledge of his daily habits. Examples of why I think this: strict routine, eats the same foods regularly, unemployed for years (observation, not a criticism!) spends almost every day in his studio (special, all-consuming interest), shops in the same places, short temper, will not answer a question directly, and rarely wants to leave home unless he absolutely has to for special interest-related things, grocery shopping, medical appointments, etc. 


I’m not entirely sure where things went wrong. We used to have so much fun together and there was so much love. The  we ended up here. He fully believes I am 100% the problem, need therapy (while true, he thinks it’s solely me who needs it, not that he/our relationship could have benefitted as well), and that he didn’t contribute to any issues in the relationship. I know you shouldn’t speak in absolutes (always/never) when talking about relationship issues, but it’s not an exaggeration to say that he almost never apologized to me. The only instance I can remember is when we were horsing around and he accidentally hit me in the face which made me cry. Even though I knew it was truly an accident it was a bit startling and it also just straight up hurt. He apologized and hugged me and wiped away my tears. So he’s capable. 


At the risk of focusing only on the negative and not giving a decently fair picture of him: he brought me coffee in bed every day. When I was in a bad car accident, he took me to all of my doctor’s appointments. He might have given me a hard time about it, but he did get me there. I got hand made birthday and Christmas cards. He used to leave sweet notes in my work lunch box. We worked through some things together and I finally got him to wear a CGM (type 1 diabetic) as a safety measure.


I spent holidays with his family, and even told me he wanted to get married (which quite honestly shocked me). He had clearly thought about it in depth & even shared that while he would be honored for me to take his last name, he also wouldn’t be offended if I didn’t because he knows how independent I am. He referred to me as his fiancée and we even made a list of pros and cons re: wedding vs. elopement. 


Now for the bad: he is an insulin-dependent diabetic and he doesn’t always take great care of himself. He passed out drunk once and I checked his blood sugar. It was 600+ which I now know is a diabetic emergency. I did administer insulin, got him to drink water to flush his system, and helped him to the bathroom / cleaned him up when he vomited. I was honestly scared to death and probably should’ve called an ambulance, but I truly didn’t realize just how serious it was at the time.


The next day he accused me of purposely trying to kill him by overdosing him with insulin because I had recently found out he was talking to his ex-girlfriend behind my back. That absolutely crushed me. Note: I also knew his blood sugar might yo-yo because alcohol can do weird things with diabetics. So I stayed awake with him until daylight when he became coherent again. I checked his blood sugar regularly to make sure it was trending down & gave him juice when he dropped too low. And if it isn’t obvious, I didn’t intend any harm at all. I dosed him based on what he told me to do previously if he was in a situation where he couldn’t treat himself / self-administer. And I cried in relief when he was finally recovered and within range again. No matter how upset I might be at anyone, I would never ever physically harm them. 


Another big one is when I experienced an ectopic pregnancy while we were together and when we came home from the hospital & I was still at risk of rupture (opted for shots instead of surgery first), he said that I was “acting like a fucking bitch”. Because I asked him to turn on the shower for me and was still in bed when he turned the water on. He was mad that I was wasting water and that upset me so I was like please calm down and consider the circumstances. Then he made that comment. He never apologized for it, and only justified it by saying that he “didn’t call you a bitch, I just said that you were acting like one.” Keep in mind that even though I was at home, my fallopian tube still could’ve ruptured at any time. I was supposed to stay as stress-free as possible and my physical activity was severely limited. Definitely didn’t feel supported through that, but I knew it was scary for him too to see me go through that and he doesn’t like hospitals (he almost died once from diabetes-related complications and had a horrible experience with a long-term hospital stay) so I tried to cut him some slack and understand that this was hard on both of us. 


He also kinda confined me to one room of the house. Like, if you didn’t go into the guest bedroom you would have no idea I lived there. It was months before he loosened up at all about letting me decorate or making any small changes to the house layout. 


There are more positive and more negative aspects to share, but those are a few that jumped out. 
The things I wonder about are like, did this relationship seem abusive? Or are these behaviors consistent with someone autistic who leans more toward not being able to handle emotional situations so they lash out in anger? For that matter, could it be a little bit of both? 


Towards the end I really started feeling like he only kept me around for sex, and he took on a very… transactional is the best word I can think of, approach to things. He avoided anything that even resembled a serious conversation and DARVO’d the hell out of me. How can someone really be that blind to their hurtful words and actions even when I clearly communicated their impact on me? I think I’m neurodivergent too and yet I have no problem apologizing when I make a mistake. 


I’m hurting a lot and wondering if I could’ve better accommodated him somehow? But I always had to blindly guess what he might need and then just try different things until something seemed to stick. One day he would be so loving, and the would get so mad so fast while simultaneously denying that he was angry or upset at all when he very clearly was. I suggested therapy, different methods of communicating, and I tried to focus on owning my own shit and being better because it would be hypocritical to gently call him out on things while not working on myself too. 


Head is just spinning and I’m confused. He dropped me after talking about spending the rest of our lives together and refused any and all accountability. It just sucks. :( ",3,1758225816.0,autism,2,1.0,False
1nkiqli,https://www.reddit.com/r/SiliconValleyBayArea/comments/1nkiqli/south_bay_tech_campus_is_taken_by_lender_in_real/,South Bay tech campus is taken by lender in real estate foreclosure,"The recent foreclosure of a significant tech campus in Mountain View underscores a pivotal moment in the Bay Area’s real estate landscape, particularly within the context of the South Bay's tech economy. With the lender taking control of the property due to a loan failure, this event not only highlights the challenges faced by high-profile commercial real estate but also signals potential shifts in the region’s economic dynamics.

The implications of this foreclosure extend beyond the immediate loss of a tech campus. It reflects broader trends impacting the commercial real estate market, particularly in Silicon Valley, where the tech sector has historically driven demand for office space. Over the past few years, we have seen a pronounced shift in how businesses use office environments, accelerated by the COVID-19 pandemic. Many companies have adopted hybrid or fully remote work models, reducing their need for expansive office spaces. This change has led to increased vacancy rates across the Bay Area, with Mountain View and surrounding areas feeling the pinch as tech giants reassess their real estate footprints.

For residents, this foreclosure may seem like an abstract financial event, but it carries significant implications for the local economy. High-profile tech firms that vacate or reduce their office spaces may lead to decreased economic activity in surrounding areas. Local businesses that rely on foot traffic from tech employees could see a decline in customers, impacting everything from coffee shops to retail outlets. Furthermore, the loss of a major tech campus may dampen demand for residential properties nearby, potentially stabilizing or even decreasing home prices in a region that has been characterized by rising housing costs.

Investors keenly watch these developments, as the foreclosure signals a cautious approach to the commercial real estate market. Investors previously confident in the stability of office spaces are now reassessing risk profiles. This could lead to increased opportunities for bargain acquisitions, but also signifies a period of uncertainty. Properties that are foreclosed often enter the market at lower price points, creating opportunities for savvy investors to acquire assets at a discount. However, with continued volatility in the market, potential buyers will need to conduct thorough due diligence, assessing both the macroeconomic factors and the specific challenges of any property in question.

Moreover, this event raises questions about the future landscape of Silicon Valley as a whole. If the trend of corporate downsizing in office space continues, we may see a significant transformation in how tech companies operate. This could lead to repurposing of commercial real estate for mixed-use developments that incorporate residential, retail, and office spaces, promoting a more integrated community model. Such developments could invigorate local economies and provide more affordable housing options, addressing one of the Bay Area’s most pressing challenges.

Looking forward, the foreclosure also invites scrutiny of investment patterns and lending practices in the region. Lenders may become more conservative in their financing decisions, leading to stricter requirements for future developments. This, in turn, may slow down new construction projects, impacting the supply side of the real estate equation. With a potential oversupply of office space already on the market, the balance between supply and demand will be crucial in determining the future viability of the commercial real estate sector.

In conclusion, the foreclosure of a tech campus in Mountain View serves as a microcosm of the evolving economic and real estate landscape in the Bay Area. For residents, it signals potential shifts in local business dynamics and housing markets; for investors, it presents both opportunities and challenges amid a cautious approach to commercial real estate. As Silicon Valley navigates this period of adjustment, stakeholders across the spectrum will need to remain vigilant, adaptive, and forward-thinking to harness the changing tides of economic development in the region. The future of Silicon Valley’s real estate market hinges on how well businesses, investors, and policymakers respond to these emerging trends and opportunities.

I work remotely, so it can get a bit boring and lonely working from home most of the time. I go to coffee houses every once in a while.

I’ve been looking for nice co-working spaces but so far, I’ve only found ones that require at least a one-month commitment, and the prices are usually 200+ JOD.
I’m sure my research is lacking, and that there are more affordable and flexible options out there.

I don’t have specific areas in mind, but I’d prefer to avoid anywhere near Jordan University and Jubaiha, since my goal is to socialize a bit, and the demographics there are pretty young.

My brother bought me a small coffee because he said I looked tired which I wasn’t. I’m 21 and he’s 30, he lives on coffee and always thinks I need one and constantly tells me to go get one when coffee doesn’t affect me that much. Now he and I don’t have the best relationship due to past trauma and decisions he’s made that he never owned up to and apologised for. Naturally, I’m always a bit hesitant when he does small gestures like that but what happened afterwards really put a bad taste in my mouth.

Around lunch time when I got myself sushi and came back he immediately said “where’s mine” and “you didn’t get me any?” I was standing there confused because I was having my break. He then said “I got you a coffee the least you could do is get me food” and I straight up said no. Now my family isn’t perfect and has this thing where they think if they do something nice for you, you’re expected to do something in return. I’ve always found this pretty disgusting, it’s like we can’t do any acts of kindness just because we want to be nice. I do this a lot, I constantly tell my little sister she never has to pay me back for anything cause I want her to be happy, and whenever my mate picks me up I’ll shout him some food just because we negotiated instead of me paying him back fully. It works with my close friends because there’s no expectations and I like that. With my brother, every time he does something he’ll constantly annoy me until I go out and do what he says and when I politely say no he goes around telling our co workers I didn’t get him food.

The simple thing here is that I shouldn’t have gotten him food and could’ve if I wanted to. There shouldn’t be expectations on acts of kindness and gestures that immediately doesn’t make it those, it makes it a two way streak and it’s always bothered me how my family is like this.",2,1758225750.0,AITAH,9,0.75,False

1nkilby,https://www.reddit.com/r/SoundTried/comments/1nkilby/explore_best_cord_organizer_for_kitchen/,Explore Best Cord Organizer for Kitchen Appliances Daisyhome C2306 and See If It Fixes Clutter,"Daisyhome C2306 quickly caught my eye with its promise to tame the unruly mess of cords that seem to multiply in my kitchen. While I initially approached it with skepticism, thinking, ""What difference can a cord organizer make?"" I was in for a genuine surprise. As someone who frequently battles tangled appliance cords and wasted drawer space, this small but mighty tool has made everyday kitchen life a whole lot smoother. Having used it for weeks now, I’ve put it through a series of tests, sticking it on everything from coffee makers to blenders.

**DESIGN AND BUILD**  
The compact and sleek design of this cord organizer was a standout from the moment I unboxed it. Measuring just 7.28 x 4.34 x 1.34 inches, its minimalistic appearance blended seamlessly with all my kitchen appliances, whether the stainless-steel finish of my toaster or the matte black of my stand mixer. It's made with a specialized soft rubber material that feels surprisingly premium for such a small tool. Non-toxic and resistant to deformations, it survived a few accidental peel-offs and reapplications without losing its grip or form, which is crucial for something designed to stay attached to often-used gadgets.

**POSITIVE FEATURES**  
Having tried similar solutions in the past, where the adhesive was a major letdown, the Daisyhome C2306 impressed me with its upgraded nano-tape technology.  
- The adhesive sticks tightly, holding on even after multiple uses, yet it doesn’t leave any sticky residue behind when removed.  
- Its ability to accommodate cords as long as 7.2 feet with a diameter of up to 0.23 inches was another big win. My coffee maker and air fryer cords, which I could never seem to tame, now snugly wind up and stay in place.  
- It’s versatile. From hair dryers and kettles in the bathroom to pressure cookers and blenders in the kitchen, it handled a wide variety of appliances effortlessly.  

[**Check Daisyhome C2306 price on Amazon.**](https://gogeary.com/p/b0chrrr1hv/)

**REAL-WORLD FUNCTIONALITY**  
Sticking kitchen gadgets to the organizer became almost second nature. With how easy it is to apply, even my parents, who are forever intimidated by anything ""newfangled,"" took to it immediately. The extra-long cord-winding feature has particularly benefitted my messy toaster setup which perpetually looked like an electrical disaster zone. My office desk lamp, which has a habit of dancing with its trailing cord, now sits dignified thanks to Daisyhome's sturdy hold.

**DRAWBACKS**  
For all its positives, the adhesive, albeit strong, doesn’t work perfectly on every surface.  
- Smooth plastics were a breeze, but textured areas required extra pressure, and even then, occasionally the hold wasn’t as solid.  
- Another downside is the soft rubber material, which while durable, can attract dust over time. Frequent cleaning is necessary to maintain its appearance.  
- After weeks of use, I've realized it may fall short for thicker cables like vacuum cleaners or industrial kitchen appliances.  

**DURABILITY AND DAILY USE**  
Juggling multiple cords daily, I expected wear and tear to set in quickly. Surprisingly, Daisyhome’s build quality held up under considerable stress. Repeated attachment and detachment didn’t distort its structure, nor did it weaken the adhesive over time. However, extra care is needed in high-temperature environments; I avoided placing it near my coffee machine’s steam outlet after noticing a slight loosening effect.

**RIVAL BRANDS**  
While trying Daisyhome C2306, I couldn’t help but compare it to similar products from competitors like CordSafe and Cordtex Solutions. CordSafe, for instance, offers slightly larger organizers which work better for bulkier appliances, but the adhesive tends to fail faster. On the flip side, Daisyhome’s innovative nano tape and soft rubber make it more adaptable to different surfaces and appliances, even outperforming Cordtex in holding smaller cords tightly. However, this doesn’t fully cater to industrial appliance users, which is where some alternatives manage to edge out slightly.

**FINANCIAL VALUE**  
When assessing what you're getting for the price, Daisyhome C2306 offers impressive cost-effectiveness. Replacing shelves of tangled cords with an easy, long-lasting solution feels worth every penny. It’s surprising how something as simple as a cord organizer can streamline your space, save time, and reduce the frustration that comes with constantly dealing with messy wires. Considering that many alternative cord-winding gadgets lack the same adhesive quality and durability, this product strikes a solid price-to-quality ratio.

1nkijvb,https://www.reddit.com/r/PluggedInPicks/comments/1nkijvb/explore_the_best_coffee_maker_keurig_ksupreme_and/,Explore the best coffee maker Keurig K-Supreme and see if it’s worth it,"Testing and using the Keurig K-Supreme daily has given me a solid sense of its performance and quirks. This coffee maker does stand out in several ways, but a few aspects felt less than stellar. As a frequent coffee brewer, I enjoy diving into the nitty-gritty of such products, and this one had plenty to offer.

**Design and Build Quality**  
The Keurig K-Supreme hits the modern aesthetic nicely. Its sleek, silver metallic finish instantly catches the eye, blending well with any contemporary kitchen. The dimensions, at 10.6 inches in depth, 16.2 inches in width, and 14.7 inches in height, are relatively compact, fitting comfortably on my counter without monopolizing the precious space. Despite its manageable size, it does command a certain presence with an overall weight of 9.88 pounds, giving it a robust and durable feel. At first glance, it doesn’t just look like a showpiece—it looks practical.

**Features That Set It Apart**  
One thing I can’t stop appreciating about this coffee maker is its MultiStream Technology. With this feature, every K-Cup is optimized for flavor extraction, resulting in a well-balanced, aromatic cup of coffee. Choosing the right strength and temperature settings also becomes a breeze, thanks to its intuitive buttons. As someone who enjoys experimenting with coffee flavors and intensities, I found the programmable settings to be incredibly useful. The stainless steel Keurig bundle includes a reusable My K-Cup filter, and that was a game-changer; no more worrying about single-use pods every single day.

[See Keurig K-Supreme deals on Amazon now.](https://newcookware.com/p/b08nq3495f/)

**Coffee Brewing Experience**  
Brewing coffee with this machine felt effortless from day one. The fully automatic operation still puts you in control of your preferences. A vivid memory that sticks out is using it during a chaotic Monday morning while half-asleep. Even then, the straightforward button interface worked to my advantage. It brews K-Cup pods efficiently, and the drip coffee output was well above decent. Although it doesn’t support ground coffee directly without using the reusable filter, the convenience of the pods can’t be ignored.

**Key Benefits**  
• MultiStream Technology for consistent flavor extraction.  
• Programmable settings for strength and temperature preferences.  
• Sleek and compact design that doesn’t dominate counter space.  
• Reusable My K-Cup filter saves money and reduces waste.  

**Negatives You Should Know**  
Still, no product is perfect, and this one’s quirks stand out in some situations. I noticed:  
• It’s a bit noisy during the brewing process, which might bug light sleepers.  
• The 78-ounce removable reservoir is convenient but feels flimsy at times, especially during refills.  
• Water heating takes slightly longer than expected compared to other models.  

**Product Contenders**  
This Keurig does face competition in its league. One product that springs to mind is the Nespresso Vertuo Next. While the Vertuo line offers the luxury of different cup sizes with a more compact build, it lacks the user-friendly programmable features of the K-Supreme. On the flip side, the Breville BES870XL provides excellent espresso for hardcore coffee aficionados, but it’s pricier and doesn’t quite match the K-Supreme's ease of use. The Hamilton Beach Scoop Coffee Maker stands as a more budget-friendly alternative, although it doesn’t come anywhere near the MultiStream Technology, making the flavor extraction feel less thorough compared to the brews from this Keurig. 

**Affordable Quality**  
In terms of pricing, this coffee maker feels like it’s positioned fairly within the market. You’re paying for flexible features, modern design, and the convenience of reusable components. While it doesn’t aim for the budget-conscious end of the spectrum, the investment makes sense for daily coffee drinkers who value a solid balance of efficiency and quality. Seeing how this Keurig K-Supreme performs in action, its pricing feels justifiable—but only if you’re a frequent coffee consumer who loves customization.

1nkii8i,https://www.reddit.com/r/ValueInvesting/comments/1nkii8i/i_just_bought_100_shares_in_duol/,I just bought 100 shares in DUOL,"A month ago I wrote a post in this subreddit entitled [I just bought 1000 shares in INTC](https://www.reddit.com/r/ValueInvesting/s/UjOsd1RTrg), with an entry price under $20.

I was called a few choice names, none of which I take personally.

My favorites were: 
""may God have mercy on your soul"" and ""OK grandma"" LOL

Now that the FED has finally lowered rates, I've been looking for an AI hyperscaler that can actually deliver.

#Technicals

The first thing to catch my eye about DUOL was the quarterly revenue and gross profit curves. Can we all agree that they are a thing of beauty? 

This company now delivers operating margins of 13.5% and an ROE of 19.15%. Again, extremely impressive for a company that's only been profitable for 6 quarters. Their minimal debt shows disciplined execution.

But I don't think we're finished. I think DUOL has the AI-ready platform to scale to a ROE of 60%+ ...we could be talking about the next magnificent company here, a true compounder.

#The Courses

The next thing was to test the app. I had used it about 2 years previously, but now the improvements are enormous. 

They've obviously really thought about the course material, redoing it where necessary. I feel like they have some top PHDs designing the syllabus.

For example, it used to start with sentences like ""the dog drinks water""...

Now it starts with ""I want a coffee"" - literally the first thing you need to say in a new country. Sentence bridges like ""also"" and ""actually"" are introduced early as well, giving flow to sentences, building confidence.

The repetition is now broken up with AI voice calls, language games and podcasts, all hosted by their viral characters.

Recently they announced they would be expanding many more courses from A2 to B2 language proficiency level - even providing language proficiency certificates for employers.

I spoke to my 12 year old foreign nephew for the first time in English the other day. I asked him where he learned English? expecting him to say it was from school - NOPE, it was Duolingo - apparently it's simply fun...

#Unlimited Scalability

DUOL is right to focus on languages right now, but the courses they could add are endless. Here's just a few ideas:

- Sign language
- Personal finance (badly needed imho)
- Home/car maintenance
- Philosophy
- Business administration 
- Geography
- History 

They have already added Chess, Mathematics and Music - Where does it end?!

#AI Hyperscaler

Even without AI, this company is a gem, but with artificial intelligence it's a true beast. They can use AI for:

- Reducing human workload in writing repetitive course material (still human reviewed).
- Creating exciting upsells such as the ""Talk with Lily"" voice call feature.
- Initial drafting of illustrations (this feeds into their viral marketing).
- Directing customer service requests to the right human (my help ticket was responded to in under 2 hours!).

The idea of ChatGPT integrations competing with them is laughable. This isn't as easy to replicate at scale as it looks. They already have the user base momentum...

Actually, the fact most of us still use ChatGPT and Midjourney instead of Gemini, should tell us something about the significance of first-mover advantages in AI.

#Valuation

Now let’s address the high valuation. 

I'm not one of those morons that is going to tell you PE ratios don't matter - earnings absolutely do, and always will matter.

Normally as a value investor I wouldn't buy a company with such a high forward PE.

However, what I look at more is the TRAJECTORY of capital efficiency and operating margins - which in this case (given the clear AI runway) more than justifies the price.

This company is somewhat newly profitable. Some distortion of valuations are to be expected. Earnings in November are likely to continue showing improvement in capital efficiency.

This company is about to start really standing out in stock screeners...",1,1758225265.0,ValueInvesting,7,0.57,False

20^(th) of Arah, the second Month of Snow.

2291 years since the new gods came.

The banished gods

Maximilian, Mil to his friends, shot up from his lunch seat. “Did you guys feel that?”

Sarah looked up from her plate of food, swallowed, and gave him a half smile of annoyance, “That twist in the guts? That’s just the feeling of a living god getting into detection range. You get used to it.”

“The hells?” Mil asked.

“You know, when a god shows up in the living world, you can feel them when they approach. It’s a normal thing. You learn to suppress it when you’re trying to sneak up on demons.” Sarah replied, taking another bite and swallowing. “Even these…fake bodies radiate some of the same magic. I heard it called “mana leakage” once.”

Pendleton coughed, then spoke up, “But who would be showing up in their true form? Who would be that powerful?”

“That wasn’t powerful, that was miner small god stuff.” Sarah chewed another bite. “You really want to feel it, when the god of giants, halflings, and humans showed up for the end of the giant’s war, that was powerful. If he hadn’t been holding himself back, he could’ve cracked the continent.”

“How do you know that?” Pendleton asked, cocking an eye.

Sarah took a quick breath, “…Um, I read it in the library?”

“Aside from all that, who would be stupid enough to walk around in their true form?” Mil asked. “I mean, they could, in theory, be killed!”

Sarah blinked, then thought for a moment, “Hmm… Well, there is one guy, but why the hells would he be here?”

Mil’s jaw dropped open, “No! Not him!”

Pendleton glanced between the other two gods, “Who’s that?”

Sarah snickered, “Well, he has a penchant for shooting people in the foot.”

Mil slumped back to his seat, “Shit.”

\-

Sam, Molly, and Hesh walked slowly through the ancient graveyard, only taking a moment to crush the skull of any undead that had escaped the earlier battle. They took in the cracked and crumbling grave stones, the rotted doors on the mausoleums, and the ivy-covered trees.

Eventually Hesh spoke, “This place looks rattier than the last one. Are we hitting the graveyards from newest to oldest?”

Molly cocked her head to one side, then the other, “That would make the most sense. Dumping us into a fight like this would have been a death sentence for us, even with all those powers we had.”

Sam nodded, “I think you’re both right.” He poked the nearest gravestone with the tip of his sword, and was surprised when it didn’t crumble. “You ever think about what would happen if we died here? Would we be “dead dead”? Or would we just reappear where we were when we left?” He poked the dirt with his sword. “Will we remember this place? Will we have anything to prove we were here?”

Their good mood shattered by Sam’s morbidity, the three friends combed the rest of the graveyard in silence.

 

21^(st) of Arah,

The Fey realm

Brandywine fluttered on the edge of her great grandmother’s parlor. She watched the cousins’ flit around the large table where Gran, Grannie, mom, and the “old” man in the ink and coffee-stained robe sat scrabbling for letters and words for points.

The four elders played, drank tea, and talked; meanwhile the littles scampered to and fro, running, dancing, and flitting. A small group of the older cousins were tuning “Guitars” and plugging them into magical devices named “loudeners”. When the first cord of dissonant sound was struck, Gran pointed an old crooked finger at the door, and the attempted musicians fled to the out of doors.

Brandy sipped at her thimble of blackberry beverage, burped, and bolted before Grannie could pinpoint her with a deathly glare. Meanwhile, the “old” man played the word “Zimbabwe” while telling of Bear catching a trout with a newfangled lure called a “beetle-spin”; a lure of which he did not approve (and would be getting one for himself).

 

22^(nd) of Arah,

Pendleton crawled from the shared tent, stretched, and poked the embers of last night’s campfire. He meandered off to take care of business, and when he returned, the others were making themselves busy taking down the tent and attending to breakfast. As he assisted Sarah in taking down the tent, Pendleton relived his surprise at how well Mil could cook. Mil had told him it came from long travels on the campaign march, and wanting to eat something “good”, so he had learned.

They took their time over bowls of honey sweetened oats until Pendleton asked a question. “What direction is the Heretic going to go?”

“He hasn’t moved.” Sarah replied after thinking for a moment. “I won’t hazard a guess as to his destination, but I’m pretty sure he’s making the rounds of all the architecture in whatever city he landed in.”

Mil frowned, “Didn’t you have a tryst with him a while back? Is that when he told you about his hobbies?”

“Ha! I wish!” Sarah said, a frown crossing her face. “He turned me down so many times, I gave up.” Both Pendleton and Mil’s eyes became wide as saucers as she continued, “That’s why I slept with so many of his soldiers.”

An hour or so later, the three began to meander in a random direction, trying to locate the three heroes they had unleashed.

 

24^(th) of Arah,

“Hesh? How far to the next graveyard?” Molly asked as they followed the ancient road, a road that was only truly denoted by way of the broken pavers that could occasionally be seen.

Hesh looked at the map, then replied, “About three more days.”

“Is there a faster route? Or just a different one?” Sam asked. “This road is giving me the creeps.”

“Is it the moss hanging from the trees that seem to hold onto the morning fog?” Hesh asked. “Or the occasional root across the road that looks like it’s moving on its own?”

“It’s the statues just past the edge of the road that are overgrown, but always look like their gaze is following you.” Molly said, in a flat tone. “The things are probably going to give me nightmares.”

I thought today I’d sit down and make a blog – with all this vlogging stuff I do, blogging can’t be much harder, right!

Let’s talk about Holoport. I’m sure you all have seen it countless times in my vlogs, but I can’t overstate how beautiful this city is!

First off, Nitro state always feels alive, and this is especially true in Holoport. As you walk through the streets, you experience a bit of everything Nitro State offers: neon lights reflecting off wet pavement, street performers showcasing amazing tricks at almost every corner, and, of course, the dragons.

It never gets old knowing Nitro state is one of the main homes to the dragons, especially in times when most states shun them out. It’s amazing to look out the window and see one flying by.

Another thing about Holoport I love is just how it mixes old with new. You have these massive, towering, sleek skyscrapers covered in bright lights right across from the small cafés that smell like heaven. You can just grab a coffee and see the wonders this city has to offer.

And the people here! Holoport’s citizens are… a bit intense, but in the best way! Everyone has their own unique energy that adds to living here. You can just feel it buzzing around the lit-up streets. It's loud, chaotic, and full of surprises – kind of like me, if you think about it long enough.

The city really shines at night. It's like a light show whenever you step outside: neon signs, lit-up bridges, and fog rolling around the streets. The fog can get surprisingly thick here, making me feel at home, as if Spark is sitting next to me.

Everything just comes alive at night and it's a wonderful experience to see the energy this city brings to Nitro State.

So yeah… that’s my take on Holoport! It’s not always perfect, but who is? But for what it has going for it are vibrant colors and excitement around every corner. It’s all home to me. If you ever get the chance to visit, make sure you take your time, look around, and maybe you’ll even run into me!

1nkidku,https://www.reddit.com/r/shortstories/comments/1nkidku/mf_other_face/,[MF] other face," There are too many faces today.
None of them hers.

Morning starts before the sun decides to be decent. Cold tatami under bare feet.

The kind of cold that sits in the bones and makes them hum.

Rin Watanabe doesn't hum. Not when she's awake. Only on stage.
And maybe, maybe in the shower when she forgets that she's Rin Watanabe.

January 12, 2015.
Day off, supposedly.
That's what the manager said—""You've earned it, Rin-chan. Stay home, relax.""
She believed him. Idiot.

Phone buzzes.
It's the ugly buzz, the one that means bad news, or worse fan gossip.
Three messages from Kana in wardrobe. One from some number she doesn't know. All saying the same thing, different flavors:

Is this you?
Did you really say that?
Wtf Rin

She scrolls.

There it is.
A photo.

Her.
Except it's not.
Too much eyeliner, wrong shape to the jaw if you tilt your head and actually look. But she's wearing her Stage 4 Winter Tour jacket the one with the custom gold embroidery. The one that, as far as Rin knew, existed in exactly one copy. Hers.

The fake Rin is walking out of a convenience store in Ikebukuro, holding a canned coffee and a pack of cigarettes.

Rin doesn't smoke.
She hates coffee.

But the internet already believes it.
The tags are bad. #rinwatanabe #idolfallfromgrace #smokingidol #trashyqueen

She sits on the edge of her futon, staring at the picture like it's a puzzle she should be able to solve if she just... turns her head right.

There's a taste in her mouth like aluminum.

By 10 a.m., the agency knows.
By 10:15, her manager is calling.
By 10:16, she's not answering.

She doesn't want his voice right now. Doesn't want to hear that fake-polite panic. Doesn't want the ""Rin-chan, please cooperate, this is bad for everyone"" routine.

She opens the curtains instead.
Winter sun, thin and white like it's been washed too many times.
Tokyo outside is a muted mess concrete, steam from vents, crows laughing at something only crows find funny.

She checks the photo again. Zooms in.
The girl's smile small, almost private, like she's thinking of something only she knows. Rin hates it because she recognizes it. It's hers. That's her Stage 5 ending pose smile. How does someone steal that?

Her phone rings again.
She answers this time.

""Where are you?""
""Home.""
""Stay there. Don't go outside. We're... we're handling it.""

We're handling it.
Agency-speak for We have no idea what's going on but we're going to yell at a few interns until it looks like we're working.

At noon she caves and calls Kana.

Kana's voice is a low rush, the kind you get when you're talking in the back room where the boss can't hear.

""I swear to god, Rin, she looks exactly like you in person. I saw her yesterday at Shibuya crossing. Thought it was you until she looked me dead in the eye and walked away.""

""Could it be a fan?""
""Maybe, but fans don't get jackets made by our costume department. That's yours, right?""

Rin doesn't answer.

Because here's the thing 
That jacket wasn't in her closet last week. She'd assumed laundry or dry cleaning or some staff mix-up. Happens all the time.

Except maybe this time it didn't ""happen.""

She tries to eat lunch. Fails. Miso soup goes cold on the table.

Instead she opens her laptop. She types her own name into the search bar like a masochist.
Scrolling, scrolling. Tweets, threads, blurry paparazzi shots.

Someone's already made a ""Spot the Fake Rin"" compilation.
Three photos two of her, one of the impostor. The comments argue like it's a game show.

She closes the laptop.

Her apartment feels wrong now.
Like maybe she's the fake one.
Like maybe the real Rin Watanabe is outside somewhere, wearing her clothes, holding her smile, walking in the January air like she owns it.

By 2 p.m., she gives up on staying inside.

Coat, scarf, sunglasses, mask. She could be anyone.
She decides to be ""anyone.""

Ikebukuro first. She doesn't even know why. Maybe because the photo was there. Maybe because if she doesn't go, she'll feel like she's hiding.

The streets smell like fried chicken and exhaust. Kids in oversized coats, vending machines buzzing.

She stands outside the convenience store from the picture. Same bright orange sign, same crooked poster for oden by the door.

No fake Rin.

At 3:15, she's in a café, small enough that the steam from her tea fogs the window.

She wonders if the impostor is somewhere right now, drinking actual coffee and laughing about the chaos.
She wonders if they look alike when they're both alone.

There's a weight in her pocket  her phone. A text from an unknown number:

Nice coat.

She looks up.

And there she is.
Three tables over.

Same face.
Same hair, even the same way the fringe doesn't sit right unless you tilt your head.
But her eyes are different more amused, like she's been waiting for this moment.

The fake Rin raises her cup in a little toast.

Rin doesn't remember leaving the café.

She's walking fast, faster, past pachinko parlors and shuttered boutiques.
Her breath is sharp in the cold.

The phone buzzes again:

Don't be mad. I'm just making you interesting.

She wants to throw the phone into the gutter. She doesn't.

Back home, it's dark already.
The city outside is all lit windows and the hum of trains in the distance.

She sits on the floor, knees up, back against the wall.
The jacket her jacket is on the chair where she left it weeks ago. She stares at it like it's guilty.

Because maybe it is.

The agency calls again.
She lets it ring.

She's thinking about the other girl's smile.
She's thinking about how for one second, looking at her, she couldn't tell if she was seeing herself in a mirror or someone else entirely.

And she's thinking
If someone can wear your face better than you can...
What does that make you?

Outside, somewhere in the city, the fake Rin is probably laughing.
Probably wearing something she hasn't even noticed is missing yet.
Probably planning the next picture.

January 12, 2015—
Day off, supposedly.

Rin Watanabe closes her eyes.

Not sure how it's possible.

Anyway, after I disassembled the thing to clean it, I noticed the puck was not like what I see with my espresso machine. It is like if this was loose coffee grounds, very uneven and not a flat bed of coffee grounds, not a flat puck.

1nkic84,https://www.reddit.com/r/AlAnon/comments/1nkic84/breaking_the_cycle/,Breaking the Cycle....,"Good morning, I’m writing to seek support, to clarify my thoughts. I have been with a very tender, intelligent, and sensitive man for a year and a half. From the beginning, I understood that he had problems with cannabis and alcohol addiction, but since I had never been close to someone with addiction issues, I didn’t immediately gauge the impact it would have on me and my emotional well-being.

He stopped using cannabis during our relationship; it wasn’t easy for him, but he managed to do it. He is able to work and be “functional,” but I still experienced behaviors that I believe stem from his alcoholism: mood swings, depressive phases, social withdrawal, silence, as if he couldn’t enjoy life without drinking… We often argued because he would disappear, not answer his phone, and every time he was at the bar. I tried to set boundaries, talk about my needs; sometimes he would change his behavior, but then he would revert to old habits. Alcohol was often at the center of our arguments, but I never wanted to control his drinking. I was a healthy partner trying to have a healthy relationship—now I see, with someone addicted.

After three weeks in which things went relatively well (he drank, but in moderation), he suddenly withdrew, saying he wasn’t feeling well… only to be fine the next day (he had spent the night at a party). He even told me that finally he didn’t have to answer to anyone… which really hurt me. I no longer gave in to his attempts to “make things right” without taking responsibility. Usually, he tries to convince me to stay with him through tenderness, and so far he has succeeded… but now I have built a wall. I have broken the cycle.

In our last argument, he told me that I had to love him as he is, that he would die an alcoholic, completely denying his emotional responsibilities. I said no and ended it. The next day, he wrote to me saying he feels bad for what he did to me (I believe him; I saw in his eyes the night before that he felt guilty), and that he will make an appointment with a doctor and a psychologist to stop drinking. I replied that I don’t promise anything, that he shouldn’t do it to keep me with him, and that we could have a coffee one day, once he has done his work.

A large part of me knows I shouldn’t wait for him; another, much smaller part hopes that this time he is serious… I’m confused. He’s not a bad person… he doesn’t intend to hurt, but he also doesn’t have the will to stop hurting…",3,1758224887.0,AlAnon,4,1.0,False
1nkia2y,https://www.reddit.com/r/TrueOffMyChest/comments/1nkia2y/i_baby_trapped_my_fiance/,"I ""baby trapped"" my fiance","I (28f) met my fiance (29m) fourteen years ago. We started dating thirteen years ago. I was a freshman in highschool and he was a junior. We've been through thick and thin ever since: his mom leaving him behind for a man three hours away (he lived with my dad and I for his senior year), addressing his unresolved grief for his dad, dealing with loved ones on both sides that struggled with addiction and dangerous behavior, coping with his health and lack of healthcare, coping with my own mental health and BPD diagnosis, the loss of his oldest friend (our pitbull), the loss of both of my brothers, planning their funerals with less than two years in between, helping take care of our neice and nephew after their dad died, purchasing our home through probate, him prosping to me on our tenth anniversary in Italy, planning our wedding, postponing our wedding due to the immense grief of my big brother, postponing again when my baby brother died. The list goes on and on. We have always been there for each other and even when our relationship seemed to lose some hope, we worked on it and went to therapy and proved we are meant for each other. We are signing the marriage license in one week, and having our dream wedding in two years.

Over the years we talked about starting our family. We always wanted to be parents together. I felt I was ready since I addressed my mental health and grew from it. He kept telling me he wanted to be his best self before having a baby. He wanted to finally finish college and become a practicing psychiatrist, he wanted to get past all of his health issues, he wanted us to find a healthy and safe home to raise our family, etc. Well his health has been the best it ever has, we purchased my brother's house after his death, finances have never been a problem for us. But he still wanted to finish school and get his career started because, which I understand but his reasoning became more unhealthy in my opinion. He didn't want to seem like a ""loser dad."" It made me sad. 

After the death of my big brother, despit being in the best place I ever was in so many ways, the grief skewed my mindset a bit. I decided to stop taking my birth control. I did tell him I was off of it ""due to hormonal issues"" and that I would be off of it for about a month. I only told him once, while being intimate. I never mentioned it again. I actively initiated sex a lot more often during that time, but I also think my libido was higher because of the hormonal reset after being on birth control for over 12 years. A day before the first anniversary of my big brother's death, I was supposed to start my period, I took a pregnancy test. It was positive. I felt my stomach drop, I finally realized how real my actions were. I worried that I had betrayed the love of my life. I confirmed the pregnancy with my doctor. When I finally told my fiance, he was in shock and admitted that he forgot what I said about my birth control. 

By the end of the day he was glowing with joy and couldn't wait to tell our parents. I had a very easy pregnancy and he took such good care of me: rubbing my belly with oil every night, preparing healthy meals for us, building furniture for the nursery, yelling at me to ""get off that chair"" as I changed the batteries in a smoke detector. It was like a movie. He supported me during the birth and held his composure as both my and the baby's heart rate dropped. When she was placed on my chest he was so amazing. As our baby grew I knew I made the right choice. He takes such good care of her. He calms her when I can't. He took the responsibility of caring for her (other than breastfeeding) when my baby brother died. He encourages me to feel my grief (which I'm still struggling with) all while being the best dad and the best partner I could have ever asked for. 

Our baby is now eight months old. He's finishing up college and right now he's making me a coffee. I love him so much, but I never plan to tell him that the pregnancy was planned on my part. ",0,1758224752.0,TrueOffMyChest,5,0.46,False

Let's make something we can both be proud of. I am looking for someone who wants to build a real, long-term relationship. We can start online and see where it goes.

Pics of me: [https://imgur.com/a/pictures-XdqmQIl](https://imgur.com/a/pictures-XdqmQIl)

A little about me: I laugh easy and care deeply. A bit of a hopeless romantic. I value patience, loyalty, and honesty. Writing is my passion, and I'm an honors student going for my Master's in English: Creative Writing. I'm also pretty athletic myself, and I'm a big mental and physical health advocate.

What I bring to a relationship: I like to make sure my partner feels heard and can smile each day. We would have bookstore, coffee shop, or park dates in person. Online we could have calls watching anime, talking, gaming, reading, or anything else interesting! My long-term goal is that I'm considering teaching English in Japan one day.

The woman I'm looking for: You're a kind, loyal woman who shares my values and isn't into hookup culture. You enjoy nerdy things, meaningful talks, and being best friends with their partner. I'm most drawn to someone healthy or athletic, with a cute smile and eyes I can fall for. You want a genuine bond.

Some of my hobbies are writing, gaming, cooking, anime, weightlifting, and long walks in nature. Some major faves are Final Fantasy, Pokémon, NieR:Automata, Baldur's Gate, and pretty much any RPG. I also read (and write) fantasy! Think like Lord of the Rings, Mistborn, but also Star Wars novels. I'd love to find someone to do cosplay with, maybe a Cloud x Tifa or something!

I'm in Indiana (EST) and open to online in the US. So if you love calm calls, shared hobbies, and want a lasting connection, please feel free to message. I mainly use discord and will be most active there. Have a good day.",1,1758224749.0,r4r,1,1.0,False

I thought today I’d sit down and make a blog – with all this vlogging stuff I do, blogging can’t be much harder, right!

Let’s talk about Holoport. I’m sure you all have seen it countless times in my vlogs, but I can’t overstate how beautiful this city is!

First off, Nitro state always feels alive, and this is especially true in Holoport. As you walk through the streets, you experience a bit of everything Nitro State offers: neon lights reflecting off wet pavement, street performers showcasing amazing tricks at almost every corner, and, of course, the dragons.

It never gets old knowing Nitro state is one of the main homes to the dragons, especially in times when most states shun them out. It’s amazing to look out the window and see one flying by.

Another thing about Holoport I love is just how it mixes old with new. You have these massive, towering, sleek skyscrapers covered in bright lights right across from the small cafés that smell like heaven. You can just grab a coffee and see the wonders this city has to offer.

And the people here! Holoport’s citizens are… a bit intense, but in the best way! Everyone has their own unique energy that adds to living here. You can just feel it buzzing around the lit-up streets. It's loud, chaotic, and full of surprises – kind of like me, if you think about it long enough.


The city really shines at night. It's like a light show whenever you step outside: neon signs, lit-up bridges, and fog rolling around the streets. The fog can get surprisingly thick here, making me feel at home, as if Spark is sitting next to me.


Everything just comes alive at night and it's a wonderful experience to see the energy this city brings to Nitro State.


So yeah… that’s my take on Holoport! It’s not always perfect, but who is? But for what it has going for it are vibrant colors and excitement around every corner. It’s all home to me. If you ever get the chance to visit, make sure you take your time, look around, and maybe you’ll even run into me!

1nki4bt,https://www.reddit.com/r/u_bettermetips/comments/1nki4bt/betterme_intermittent_fasting_diet_plan/,BetterMe: Intermittent Fasting Diet Plan,"Thinking about trying intermittent fasting but not sure which plan fits you? There are several options, and picking one that matches your goals, lifestyle, and health situation makes a huge difference.

**What intermittent fasting (IF) looks like — main methods:**

* **Time-Restricted Eating (TRE)**: Eat all your daily calories within a specific window. Examples: 16:8 (fast for 16 hrs, eat in 8), 14:10, 18:6, even 20:4. 
* **Alternate-Day Fasting**: One full fasting day, one normal eating day. There’s also a modified version where “fasting” days allow \~20-25% of usual calories. 
* **5:2 Method**: Eat normally five days a week, restrict calories significantly (\~500-600) on two non-consecutive days. 
* **Extended Fasting**: 24 hours or more fasts (e.g. Eat-Stop-Eat). More aggressive so more care needed.

**What to eat (and avoid) during your eating windows:**

**Do include:**

* Protein-rich foods: chicken breast, fish, eggs, Greek yogurt, legumes, nuts/seeds. Helps preserve muscle & helps satiety. 
* Nutrient-dense whole foods: leafy greens, colorful vegetables, berries, whole grains (quinoa, brown rice, oats), healthy fats (avocado, fatty fish, olive oil). 
* Healthy fats to support hormones + energy. 
* Stay well hydrated: water, herbal teas, black coffee etc. 

**Avoid or minimize:**

* Ultra-processed foods: chips, fast food, processed snacks — these often spike hunger or cravings. 
* High-sugar foods & beverages (candies, sodas, sugary sauces, etc.) since they can lead to energy crashes. 
* Refined carbohydrates like white bread, instant rice, etc., especially if you’re trying to keep hunger/manage blood sugar.

❔❔ Which intermittent fasting method have you tried (or considered): 16:8, 5:2, alternate-day, etc., and how did it go for you?

I have a bit of a globus sensation, dry cough and SOB but my most debilitating symptom is the sore throat.

After being on a PPI twice a day, taking Gaviscon advance after every meal and at night as well as following a reflux friendly diet my symptoms were very slowly but surely improving - throat pain down from a 9/10 to 4/10 with moments in the day where I could almost forget my throat hurt. I was starting to go on gentle walks + practice yoga again. I'm normally very active and swim/weightlift 4-5x/week, not being able to do any of this due to the pain has been devastating on my mental health.

I made a really stupid decision yesterday and chose to eat a slice of coffee and walnut cake. Within 10 minutes my throat was on fire and I couldn't stop coughing. I took Gaviscon as soon as I could and went straight back to a very bland, strict diet. I couldn't sleep last night due to the pain being so severe.

Today the pain has been only minimally better and I'm exhausted. The sore throat is driving me crazy making me feel almost claustrophobic and raising my anxiety.

I'm terrified that I've undone all my hard work and I'm now facing another few weeks of severe sore throat before my throat goes back to how it was. This terrifies me.

1nki1ah,https://www.reddit.com/r/dustythunder/comments/1nki1ah/aita_for_not_helping_my_husbands_sister_even/,AITA for not helping my husband’s sister even though I have the money?,"So my husband David passed away a little over a year ago. It was tragic, yes, but he worked at the plant for 25 years and let’s just say he took VERY good care of me. I inherited his pension, life insurance, the house, the car — I’m not struggling. For once in my life, I can actually live comfortably. I can book a cruise without checking my bank account three times. I can spoil my sweet dog Tootsie rotten, as she deserves.

Now the issue is his sister, Brenda. Ever since I married David, she’s had a chip on her shoulder about me. People act like she’s “nice,” but she has never respected me. On my wedding day, she refused to wear the bridesmaid dress I picked (a gorgeous teal satin with puff sleeves that I ordered special from JCPenney). She actually called it “hideous” to my face. Who does that to a bride?? And when I said her husband couldn’t come to the wedding because they’d only been married a year and what if they divorced — I didn’t want some random man in all my wedding photos — she made a huge deal out of it. (They’re still together, whatever, but at the time I was being practical!)

And then she had kids, and don’t get me wrong, I love children in theory, but she lets them run wild. I once saw her let her daughter climb on a coffee table and I just said, “Wow, I guess you don’t believe in discipline,” and she acted like I insulted her parenting. I’m just honest! I’ve told her plenty of times she could dress her kids better if she didn’t shop at Walmart. That’s constructive, not mean. She just doesn’t like to hear the truth.

Anyway, now Brenda is apparently “struggling.” Her car broke down, she’s behind on rent, her kids need new shoes. And she has the nerve to come to ME and ask for money. She said, “David would have wanted me to be taken care of too.” Excuse me? David adored me, not her. He couldn’t stand when she came around nagging or making comments. He wanted me to have a good life, which is why he worked so hard. And if we’re being real, David always said he just wanted a hot wife. Which I am. So why should his hard-earned money go to her when it’s clearly meant for me?

I told her no. I said she needs to figure it out on her own. I’ve got a cruise coming up — balcony suite, all-inclusive — and Tootsie’s rhinestone stroller is already on the way (it cost more than her rent, but she’s worth it). Why would I waste my money on someone who’s never supported me, never respected me, and is only nice to me now because I have the money she wants?

Now the whole family is calling me selfish and heartless. They’re saying Brenda just needs a little help to get back on her feet, that it wouldn’t even make a dent in what I have. But I don’t see why I should give up MY comfort and MY plans for someone who’s treated me poorly from the start.

So, am I the asshole for putting myself (and Tootsie) first? Or is everyone just jealous that I finally get to enjoy life and don’t have to hand it over to people who never liked me in the first place? If you ask me, I think her husband should do better. David never struggled to care for me and him. ",0,1758224195.0,dustythunder,17,0.26,False

1nki07z,https://www.reddit.com/r/advisorcoffee/comments/1nki07z/arzum_okka_turkish_coffee_maker_worth_it/,Arzum Okka Turkish Coffee Maker – Worth It?,"I’ve been a long-time espresso drinker, but recently I’ve fallen in love with Turkish coffee. I wanted something quicker and more consistent than using a cezve on the stovetop, so I picked up the [Arzum Okka Turkish Coffee Maker ](https://coffeegearlab.com/arzum-okka-turkish-coffee-maker-review/)after seeing it recommended in a few coffee groups. Here’s my honest take after a few weeks:

# ☕ Brewing Experience

* The machine is super easy to use—add water, finely ground coffee, and (if you want) sugar, then press a button.
* It has both **fast brew** and **slow brew** options. The slow brew is great because it mimics the gentle heating of a cezve, which gives you that foamy top and deeper flavor.
* The consistency is impressive. Each cup comes out nearly identical, unlike stovetop brewing where it can vary a lot depending on heat control.

#  Heating System

* From what I can tell, it uses an **internal heating plate** that heats the brewing pot evenly.
* The “slow cooking” mode basically lowers the wattage to heat gradually, preventing burning and letting the foam build up.

# ✅ Pros

* Consistent results every time
* Easy to use (literally push a button)
* Sleek, modern design
* Great if you make multiple cups in a row
* Much quicker than manual brewing when you’re in a rush

# ❌ Cons

* Doesn’t feel as “ritualistic” as using a cezve
* Slightly different flavor depth vs. traditional stovetop method
* Pricey compared to other Turkish coffee makers
* Cleaning requires a bit of care (you need to rinse the pot and wipe the heating plate)

# 🧼 Cleaning & Maintenance

* The brewing pot is removable, so cleaning is easy—just rinse it under water.
* No complicated descaling like espresso machines.
* Just wipe the heating plate and keep the pot dry when not in use.",1,1758224129.0,advisorcoffee,0,1.0,False

So the building where I have been renting office space since 1994 from has been sold and the new owners are going to gut the entire building for a dentist office. So I need to be out by the end of October.  Obviously since 1994 IT businesses have evolved and I spend most of my time in the cloud as opposed to working on systems in the office.  There are times where the office is helpful like my recent rollout of 34 firewalls for a larger customer refresh and the office was nice for that.  But that is few and far between .

So I am considering going office-less for a bit or checking out one of those co-working facilities. I am really not interested in networking with others which is common at the co-working place.  I just need a place other than home where I can go and focus during the week.  I do not have any walking traffic and I would only be at this place for max 10 hours per week.  most of my time would be onsite projects and such. 

I know this is subjective based on business and needs but I am wondering what others are doing along these lines?  Do other IT/MSP providers have physical offices or working remote/co-work?

1nkhycq,https://worksfornature.org/nature-in-need,I created a political tracker for nature conservation [Update],"I posted in June about a political tracker I'm building for nature conservation. **I've just launched a new version.** Some notes about the project:

**1) Not Just Trump** \- I changed the focus of the tracker. Initially, I focused exclusively on Trump's impacts. But I've found that limiting. So I've broadened the focus to political issues at the Federal AND State levels. And I've changed the name from ""Nature Under Trump"" to ""Nature in Need""

**2) Threats vs. Opportunities** \- Another change, before I was tracking only threats to conservation. Now I am also tracking opportunities. Opportunities are things like ballot initiatives and pro-conservation legislation.

**3) Goals** \- My goal is to list every significant and current political battle in nature conservation at the federal and state scales. The point is: 

* give order and clarity to the chaos (a birds eye view)
* connect users to the latest news updates via the feed or email. 
* provide a road map for getting involved with the issues. 

**4) Tracker Updates  -** I will be regularly adding News Updates to tracker entries. So you can visit the tracker regularly - or subscribe - to stay connected to the latest political news. Very soon, I will be adding the ability to create custom alerts by issue.

**5) Action Guides -** Each entry in the tracker opens to an action guide for that issue. It gives an overview of what’s happening, why it matters, and how to get involved.  

**6) I Can Use Help** \- If you like this idea, below are some ways you can help

* **Subscribe** \- It's free to subscribe.  Your subscription helps me build an audience. 
* **Share** \- If you know anyone who you think would be interested, please share this resource.
* **Feedback** \- Let me know if you see typos or if you have any ideas for new entries, updates, or site improvements. 
* **Participate** \- If you have spare time, I could use help with different roles like tracking issues, outreach, proofreading, etc. Let me know if you're interested. 
* **Contribute** \- I started a [Buy Me a Coffee](https://buymeacoffee.com/worksfornature). I hate asking for money. But if you really like the idea and can afford it, any contribution - no matter the size - helps me cover costs and take a step forward. Thank you!",4,1758224013.0,conservation,1,0.83,False

Hey everyone!

Looks like tomorrow is going to be a pretty slow day for me, so I thought I’d put this out there: would anyone like to meet up for a coffee around 2? Nothing fancy, just a casual hangout.

I’m totally cool with however the vibe goes — whether it’s light chit-chat, swapping stories, or even if you’d rather just have someone to sit with quietly while enjoying your drink. Sometimes it’s just nice to break up the day with some company.

And don’t worry about the tab, I’ll happily cover the coffees ☕🙂. If you’ve been looking for a little mid-day break, this could be a nice way to do it.

I have a bit of a globus sensation, dry cough and SOB but my most debilitating symptom is the sore throat. 

After being on a PPI twice a day, taking Gaviscon advance after every meal and at night as well as following a reflux friendly diet my symptoms were very slowly but surely improving - throat pain down from a 9/10 to 4/10 with moments in the day where I could almost forget my throat hurt. I was starting to go on gentle walks + practice yoga again. I'm normally very active and swim/weightlift 4-5x/week, not being able to do any of this due to the pain has been devastating on my mental health. 

I made a really stupid decision yesterday and chose to eat a slice of coffee and walnut cake. Within 10 minutes my throat was on fire and I couldn't stop coughing. I took Gaviscon as soon as I could and went straight back to a very bland, strict diet. I couldn't sleep last night due to the pain being so severe. 

Today the pain has been only minimally better and I'm exhausted. The sore throat is driving me crazy making me feel almost claustrophobic and raising my anxiety. 

I'm terrified that I've undone all my hard work and I'm now facing another few weeks of severe sore throat before my throat goes back to how it was. This terrifies me.

1nkhtcd,https://i.redd.it/il2uizhr5zpf1.jpeg,Charlie Kirk: The Unmourned Prophet of American Vitriol,"The assassination of Charlie Kirk was not a tragedy; it was an inevibility. It was the logical, violent conclusion of the very rhetoric he and his ilk have pumped into the American bloodstream for years. He didn’t create the anti-Black sentiment, the xenophobia, or the coded hate—he simply monetized it. He was a megaphone for the silent prejudices too many white Americans and their buffer groups harbor but are too polite to say at the dinner table.

And let us be clear: the man who “unalived ol’ Charlie boy” was his logical creation. He was the same archetype as the shooter who grazed Donald Trump’s ear—not a marginalized “other,” but a product of the homegrown, white extremist violence that this country consistently coddles. Kirk peddled a spoonful of cod liver oil, claiming it was tough truth, but its core was always rancid. It was dehumanization disguised as debate.

His death forces a uncomfortable question: what exactly is free speech in America? We have a disturbing proclivity to protect speech that incites violence against the marginalized while simultaneously punishing the victims of that violence for speaking out against it. The First Amendment has been weaponized as a shield for hate, allowing figures like Kirk to traffic in dangerous propaganda under the guise of mere political disagreement. This is not dialogue; it is violence by proxy.

And who pays the price? We do.

I write these words knowing the weight they carry. As a Black journalist, to critique this system is to invite its wrath. The goalposts of acceptable discourse are constantly moved to silence us. Case in point: a rancid piece of filth on Reddit—likely the very archetype of the alienated, violent man Kirk’s rhetoric cultivates—succeeded in getting my “Buy Me a Coffee” account shut down. This is the modern digital violence: silencing the critics while mourning the agitators.

But I am not writing for them.

I am writing for you—the person who reads this and feels that same deep unease. The person who doesn’t want to practice prejudice and intolerance but might not know how to actively fight it. Supporting independent, marginalized voices is how we fight back. It is how we build a media landscape that doesn’t just glaze over the legacy of a “hateful peckerwood” but dismantles the very system that created him.

This is why I am asking for your support. I am financing a major media project to amplify this truth, and its total cost won’t exceed $500. I am counting on my newfound audience to help me build something powerful. If you’ve ever valued a perspective that challenges the comfortable status quo, I am asking you to invest in it.

The cost of a single coffee is all it takes to become a patron of a different narrative.

When this project succeeds—and it will—I will remember those who thought enough of a stranger to invest in him when no one else would. This is about more than one article or one donation; it is about choosing which side of history you stand on.

We can become perturbed by the anti-Black sentiment that Kirk represented, or we can build a future defined by positivity and prosperity over prejudice. The choice is yours. Decide which timeline you’re on.",1,1758223702.0,FeedSpot_BackLinks,0,1.0,False

Hey everyone, I’m a 31 year old female on a weight loss journey, as I’ve been my entire life. I’ve done the yoyo dieting, I did Keto, Weight Watchers, Fasting, therapy…my highest weight was 384. In November 2021 I had a gastric sleeve, and dropped down to 248. I have a terrible relationship with food, it’s my comfort when I’m stressed, my filler when I’m bored, it’s celebratory…all the things. I ended up gaining almost all of the weight back, mostly because of what I was eating, not necessarily how much because after the surgery I was pretty limited. I was drinking a large iced or blended coffee at least once if not twice a day. Fast food all the time. Anything sweet was also a downfall. About 4 weeks ago I weighed 335. My boyfriend and I had a long, emotional conversation of what we want our future to look like, and how we want to be able to experience life to the fullest, have children and be able to run around and keep up with them. He really helped push me to get motivated to start over and try and change my lifestyle. He’s doing it with me, even though he’s not really that heavy. 

Anyways, I decided to log all of my food and track my calories. I’ve given myself 1500 calories per day, and usually I’m between 1200-1350. I have one cheat meal a week and on those days I still don’t let myself go beyond 1800. I completely cut out the coffee and any sugary drinks. I stopped eating late at night/early morning (2-3am). Now I have dinner between 7-8 and then I’m done for the day. I’m telling you, I did a complete 180 and after that first week, the cravings subsided and I feel satiated and not hungry all the time. I was so happy to get on the scale and see 320! 

I was interested in trying out certain meds so I went to the doctor to see what they said. I’m not going to get into the whole conversation but I decided against them and she prescribed my phentermine. I did more research on that and decided against that as well, after I’d already picked it up. I feel like I’m doing well already and like my surgery is starting to work for me again. 

What bothered me is that she asked what I had done to lose the weight (14 pounds) and I told her about my logging and calorie deficit. She said it was great and asked what I’d been eating. For breakfast I’ve been having a fage Greek yogurt with honey and a cheese stick (I used to not eat breakfast) which is 260 calories total. For lunch if I’m at my clinic site I’ll have whatever the cafeteria offers that’s healthy (usually grilled chicken and veggies). When I get home, it varies but sometimes I’ll do shrimp with beans and a couple small tortillas (each is 50 calories) sometimes chicken sausage and veggies, I might have a wrap from California chicken cafe with no dressing. I’ve made chicken salad with homemade Greek yogurt dressing. But I still never go over 1500. She was like, “well you really don’t want to go over 5g of sugar per meal. For example if you have an apple, it has about 20g of sugar, you’d only want to have 1/4 to 1/3 of that or it can hinder your weight loss. The honey in my yogurt has 29g of sugar which is high. She said I shouldn’t be drinking the sugar free sodas, just drink water or tea. 

I know I’m no professional but isn’t a calorie deficit still going to make you lose weight whether or not I have more than 15g of sugar a day? I’m not saying I’m going to eat 1500 cal of cake and call it a day but I wanted to tell her “Girl I used to smash an entire package of golden Oreos in one sitting, I don’t think eating a whole apple is going to slow my weight loss”. I also told her I sliced a nectarine over my yogurt and she said it’s too high in sugar. She told me my cheat meal day should still be at 1500 calories. 

My thing is I need this to be sustainable for life. I know myself, if I cut all of the enjoyable things out, I will lose this battle. And I feel like I’m doing really well! I’ve never had high BP (knock on wood) but it was lower at this appt than I’ve ever seen it. My resting heart rate was lower too!

Last two afternoons I have dedicated to building a Telegram bot with n8n, which will save me a lot of time. It works like this: 

* send YouTube video URL with data, 
*  It gets a transcript, 
* makes a summary, 
* prepares data to save to Notion,
* chunks the transcription, and adds it to the vector database.

After such a process, you can get an overview in Notion and chat in Telegram, asking different questions.

I strongly believe that such a tool can increase productivity.

3 days. Three days. A short time for most, but a span so agonizingly long that I had to break my rule for writing numbers just to emphasize it. An endless fucking conga line of wizards, witches, GCs, angels, devils, fae—and basically any other magical creature that could offer a vaguely different perspective on my predicament—had tried their hand. And I was still in a cage.

Dispellation, incineration, teleportation, transmogrification, and a lot of other -ations were tried on me and/or my prison. One of the most promising was preservation, wherein I spend a long time at deep negative HP in the hopes that the barrier would fizzle out of existence. I should’ve figured it wouldn’t work, given that Jane custom-made the magic for my prison, *and* had access to someone who knew preservation magic. 

We figured as much from her notes, which had only shown so far that she’d done some really damn thorough work. Those pages had very little in the way of a weakness, or exploit to get me out. Instead, we had a nice long list of things we knew wouldn’t work… but were trying anyway because why not.

Everyone came and went. Chivos was off to oversee the filing of my legal case against the Dastardly 7, as we’d begrudgingly taken to calling them. *Cringe.* Some lackey cooked up the name and it spread like wildfire, as memetics often do. Matti was in for a lengthy hospital stay, most named heroes and villains had returned to their duties, and Theo took Pyroshir topside to party somewhere that didn’t smell like shit.

I don’t blame him for that. My luxury of a cordoned-off cell had run out as my toilet was starting to fill up, with no way to empty it, and no ventilation (yet still enough oxygen to complain with). Like I said, thank god for the lid. We did confirm that at least I wasn’t running out of air, which was something, I guess. For long stretches of time, I only had Hecate for company. Her, and the papers.

My eyes were half glazed, reading legal jargon couched in censorship and obfuscated translation. I thought the trial would be quick, given how efficient the gods were in some respects, but I had yet to run that speedboat aground on a vast reef of their own special flavor of bullshit. Because holy hell, could they argue *endlessly*, and they wrote most all of it down. If I could crawl through a portal in time and space to strangle any of them in particular, I’d gun it for the stenographer. *I don’t need to know the duration of the 35th pause in just as many lines, you pedantic fuck.*

I set the pages down, worn out from reading. “Hecate?”

“Yes?”

I looked at the document, then at her. “How much of this did you know?”

“What do you mean?” she asked in an innocent tone.

“I mean, after all the things you’ve told me, I feel like you would know more than you let on. You’ve been around a long time, since basically the start, right? I recall you not being a true angel, and I’ve caught you being savvy to cultural references from Earth as well. So, like, what are you really, and how much do you know?”

She was silent and still for a long few seconds. “Are you determined to pierce the veil and see the truth, even if it may be… dull, and disappointing?”

“I’m already disappointed, and bored. I want some clarity in my life.”

Hecate nodded wistfully. “On the subject of Earth references: The Matrix, seen it?” I nodded. “In that movie’s terms, I am a program. I am a development tool, from this Earthkit, meant to destroy and flatten and burn, given persona and agency. With a stable world, my services are not needed, and I am permitted to wander as I please, so long as I do not break anything. 

“Of course, a hammer need not know the foibles of its user, so I was never much savvy to the dramas and failings of the gods. I could only draw my own conclusions on them as they told me I would be needed perhaps 4 or 5 times, only to call me for over 20. Of course, I knew that something was amiss when gods I had never seen before came and asked me a great many pointed questions, like if I had ever harmed a class 3 soul.”

“So you didn’t know any sort of details, and this document is only confirming your suspicions?”

“More or less.” She blew a smoke ring. “Has that document delved into soul classifications yet?”

I sighed. “No, a lot of crap about souls is redacted. Why?”

“It may help you to understand things. A class 3 soul is the kind that reincarnates, lives many, many lives. They have rights, protections. If mistreated, there can be consequences. But class 1 and 2 souls are different. Gods can create them on demand, for every living being requires a soul of some sort. Without one, the body will wither and fail, the mind will fray, go blank.

“Such souls are to test the waters, so to speak. Class 1 souls are hardy, and simple. They stomach monotony like no other, and rarely fear death. They’re rather stupid, but provide valuable feedback when setting up a world. They also make good fodder, like the monsters and bandits you clash with.

“Class 2 souls are instead near indistinguishable from class 3, but their lives are attached to the world. No matter how vibrant they… *we* seem, we have no such rights, for we are only constructs, facsimiles of the real thing. When Nassur ends, so too will all class 2 souls attached to it.”

I didn’t know what to say to that for a moment. “Well, that… uh…. that’s bleak.”

“Better a life enjoyed than no life at all.”

“Okay, Shakespeare. If you’re a construct program thingy, can you read this crap?”

I held up the current page, and Hecate peeked at it. She immediately grimaced and covered her eyes again. “I could likely force myself to comprehend it, but those runes disgust me deeply.”

“Why’s that?”

“The language of the gods is… difficult to describe. Imagine a strand of DNA. Each base pair between the helixes is a kanji. Now picture that kanji in 3 dimensions. Strokes that come out, press back, writhing in and out of the foreground. 

“And there are 40 colors of ink, each brushstroke able to switch colors, changing the entire meaning of the word with even the slightest deviation in stroke order, coloration, and shape. Yet still, each formulation could mean a thousand different things, in a million tones determined by the shape of the sound that resonates in your mind when you smell it.”

She let out a breath. “All that esoteric structure, that beautiful nuance. Imagine the depth of detail that every word carries… compressed into binary. That document is an insult to the language with which I was written into existence, and I pity you for having to stomach a word of it. You would be better served sleeping.”

I raised a finger, then curled it. “You know what? You’re right..” I looked at the papers, then her, and quietly nodded. “I could use a sleep. Goodnight.”

“Goodnight, wayward soul.”

……

“Dennis? Wake up there, Hubs.”

I lifted my head to see Chivos. “Mm, ‘sgoinon? Did John keel over dead yet?”

“Unfortunately, no. The turns of fate clause will likely keep him alive indefinitely.”

He dropped his briefcase at his semi-permanent setup in the storage room and brought some papers to show me. “We have a meeting in 20 minutes with the Department of Prophecies and Plot Devices. They want to hear about the artifact’s details.”

I got up and popped my back. “Man, am I becoming one of those special dungeon rooms? Go here for info on your quest? And couldn’t they just get the information from the rest of the agencies? I thought they were part of this.”

“They’re more of the whistleblower that was told ‘we’ll take it from here’. It is quite typical for them to alert other agencies to important happenings, then sit in the proverbial corner until someone remembers they exist.” He stuck a sheet of paper to the crystal. “In better news, I went shopping and picked this up for you.”

I squinted. “Destroy Sewage? Oh, hell yeah. Thank you *so* much. Any news on food and water?”

“Nothing in your spell range. Pain cancellation and healing remain your best option.” He taped the spell in place for me to study it. “How are you holding up?”

I quietly read the spell for a moment. “Well, I’m parched, but I have a few more magic sandwiches before I starve. Haven’t tasted anything in days, though. It’s kinda… kinda fucking with my head, feeling full without eating. Not as much as these pages hurt my head, but… I could really go for some oatmeal right now.”

“Of all the foods we could afford, oatmeal?”

“Yeah. Oatmeal with milk tea. Then, later, grilled cheese sandwich.”

He looked up from his papers. “What would they think, if it got out that I married such a simpleton?”

“That you’re rich and can do whatever the hell you want?”

He popped a smirk for once in his life. “Likely.”

……

Guess what the Department of Prophecies and Plot Devices wanted? That’s right! Another recap! And what else, you might wonder? But of course, a detailed description and inspection of the macguffin. How original! Nobody had asked me that before. They requested that I turn over the artifact and its contents, and I hit them with the classic ‘I’ll consider it.’ Honestly, I don’t really know if I would willingly burden anyone with the full, unadulterated story.

I let them sketch out a copy of the first page. I told them it looked the same as the original, and they asked me if I could still read it. I reiterated that it looked the same. There was something missing about it on a deep level. It couldn’t itch my brain into understanding it.

So passed the daily chores. I practiced the new spell before me, for the warnings were clear; improper casting would have… explosive consequences. Some undignified things had to happen to train the spell. Clothes were soiled, walls were splattered, the air fouled little by little, until I grasped the words, the motions. A cast at a time, I liberated myself from the stench until there was nothing left.

There I sat, at my desk, still trapped, still nothing to do but wait or read. But it didn’t smell like crap anymore. Resigned, I read. Not because I wanted to, but because what else? The moment my eyes fell on the stupid, dry, excessively-worded prose, Hecate’s words echoed. *Fuck this. I’m skimming.*

……

Day 6. The celestial court case dragged on and on, but I felt free. My hatred for the stenographer fell away as I simply stopped giving him the time of day. I flipped through great swathes of black bars, rants, interviews, examinations. The case oscillated between boring retreadings and arcane information I could hardly begin to comprehend.

Matti, Pyro, Varia, and Theo came to visit. Told me she was cleared for release from medical care, and they were staying at an inn. Theo said he was helping her to learn social skills; a dubious claim. It was mostly yammering to keep me from losing my mind, though I did have a question gnawing at me.

“How did y’all find me, anyway?”

They paused. Theo was about to start, but Matti thumped his knee. “I’ll open. It was a disaster. You vanished into thin air and everyone freaked out. We used magic of all sorts, turned the whole city upside down, and there was not a trace of you. Come sunset, we got permission to search everywhere. Teams scattered in every direction, trying anything we could think of. It was… very familiar. Remember the search for Auseta?”

“Who?” Theo asked before being bapped into silence.

“I had a glimmer of hope, remembering that you broke through to her location, but then it sank in that we were *searching for you*. I even tried your dowsing rod.” She sighed. “After 16 hours we had nothing. I returned to Drominnus Tower for our big re-strategizing meeting when *this guy* came waltzing in on *that guy.* ”

She pointed to Theo and Pyro, who happily took over. “Yeah, that’s me, the *real* head-turner.”

“Flaming horses tend to do that,” Theo added. “So, remember the part where I said I might need to turn you over if I’m out of time or ideas? Yeah, that’s pretty much what happened. As much crap as I give you, I have to admit that I couldn’t keep up with those bunch of assholes alone.”

“Hey!”

“Okay, Pyro and I. Being the x factor was a lot more fun. They didn’t know me or what my deal was, but without you I took the spot of main target, and that really sucked. You made a better punching bag, that’s for sure. I tried some sneaky stuff, but we worked through our book of tricks faster than they did, so that was a wash. The water was about shin-deep by the time I had to throw in the towel. I ended up ‘accidentally’ leading them to the hideaway about 30 minutes before you were going to die.”

Theo cleared his throat. “They collapsed that mirror world spell pretty soon after they found you. That was a hectic couple seconds. Every living thing inside was brought into the same random forest clearing. There were some… explosions. I think I got paralyzed, but I was wearing your gear and *man,* that build! Overflowing your negative effect resistance? Genius.

“Pyro got us out of there fast. We found a road, got some directions, and made it to Liverpont at… what, 3am? Rode into town like Flint Westwood to a bunch of slack jaws. Of course, they thought I was you. I look and sound the part in your armor. That took some explaining.”

“YOU HAVE AN EVIL CLONE?” Matti burst out all of a sudden, like she had been holding it in for days. “WHY DIDN’T YOU MENTION THIS?”

“Yeah, he’s asleep most of the time.”

Theo smiled. “Life’s boring, repetitive. Hard to beat that lovely downy mattress.”

She looked at him, then me. “How did this happen?”

I shrugged. “On the job. It was a big score about 15 years back. Huge dungeon—hadn’t been touched in centuries—bounced around a whole dynasty of inheritors too scared to do anything with it. Until it lands in the hands of a rambunctious up-and-coming villain who thought it would be a great main lair with a bit of TLC.

“Long story short, I come in, clean house, get promised half the loot in the place. Well, I wasn’t as seasoned back then, didn’t have quite the sense for what to touch and what not. I came across a secret room with some odd magic items. Picked up this cute little silver hand mirror like an *idiot* and boom, there’s a Theo. Do you remember what you said?” I asked, holding back a chuckle.

Theo cupped his face. “Ugh, don’t make me think about it. I was not a good copy at first.”

“Well, yeah, that’s why I ended up looking into the mirror so long for you, let you copy all the details and polish a real personality for once in your existence. Now say the line!”

“Fine. What was it? Err. ‘Hello, me. Are you ready to face yourself?’”

I snickered. “And my tired ass, after back-to-back 12-hour shifts, said ‘no, I’m me, you’re you!’”

“To which I said… ‘Silence, fool! I am your shadow! Now we must battle!’”

“Of course, I was having none of it. I just asked ‘Do we gotta?’ and that was it. That caught him off guard enough that we ended up talking it out and deciding that no, we don’t gotta. I figured that he’s alright, and he gave me generally the same grace. Went on to explain that it’s really quite a painful and disconcerting to copy someone new, so I struck a deal that he could mirror me long-term. It’s been a peaceful life for him since.”

“That is… surprisingly altruistic of you,” Matti commented.

“Mmm, no. I stipulated that I could call him up to kick ass in an emergency. Second best deal I ever made.”

Theo squinted his eyes. “Second best?”

“Married Chivos.”

“Second best it is. Anyway, after I explained who I was, and what had happened, I joined the search for you. I really thought I would be the lynchpin in that effort, thanks to that crystal ball I stole that could track you down. Unfortunately, those assholes are exceptional at covering their tracks. We went without a lead for days, mostly only finding scattered pieces of lost gear.”

Matti raised her hand. “We found the Bottle of Endless Tide. You’ll be happy to know that the property damage is being covered by the LCE’s insurance. They drew the short straw.”

“And your cute vorpal beamer,” Theo threw in, patting my sword on his hip. “That was the best we could do, until Grif happened.”

“Ha! Haha, fuck, oh god. He’s okay, right?” They nodded, so I let myself laugh for a moment. “Aw, man. That’s karma at work. Carry on.”

Theo crossed his arms. “Right. The conservation office received him from that teleportation glyph they use to protect endangered species. He came with your name, and stone number attached, as well as the coordinates where he was harmed. They were getting their boots and billy clubs together when they called your number and were snatched up for questioning before they could finish buttoning their coats.

“That got us to Din-Haven, but not to you. See, Grif came with X and Y coordinates, but it took me checking the crystal ball and seeing it had a signal to find out you were underground. We hit the sewers pretty quick, and Madame Gossamer had the lead. We were in small groups sweeping the sewers stealthily, until we found a ferret.”

“*Squeak, squeak!*”

“Yes. She led us right to the perimeter set up by the Dastardly 7. While we were making a plan, Lechia intentionally tripped their alarm wards, caught the Thief, and kicked down the door to your room. You know what happened after that.”

I nodded pridefully. “God, I love my pets. Question, though. When did Lechia join the search?”

“About an hour after you vanished,” Matti answered. “We don’t know how she knew, but an informant is suspected. I… may be suspected, now that I consider it.”

“Rightfully?”

She elbowed Theo. “I only wrote her the letter, which was approved by my superior, might I add.”

……

Day 8. The court case finally got to some interesting things. Though the guilt was all but confirmed, the punishment was yet undecided, and the phase of their legal process was far outside what I would consider ‘normal people’ court business. They had brought in tutors to advise our pantheon on how to fix their mistakes. The current speaker, \[Ehecatl\] aka Quetzalcōātl was advising them on world generation.

He identified 16,552 dangerous anomalies spread across the world and created a plan to eliminate as many as possible without greatly changing existence in the eyes of its inhabitants. The catch being that not everything could be fixed. So what did they do for the rest of the errors? Why, the old Pat Pentahedron strategy of take the problem and push it somewhere else. It clicked in my head after rereading it.

“Hang on a minute.”

As I read more and more, it all coalesced. Earth’s no-magic rules improperly applied, generative terrain not switching off, locations not \[saving\] correctly? All pushed away from where people live? The Shimmerlands?

“It’s all their tech debt shoved to the edge of the world?” I considered it for a moment. “Hell, it makes a better world barrier than the stupid edge the flat earthers dreamed up.”

“Did you say something, sir?” a guard asked me.

“Nah, nothing.”

……

Day 12. A day I hoped would never come. A day where there is only suffering with no option to change it. A day with no escape, no solution, no joy. The magic can keep me from dying, but not wishing that I could.

I’m starving. Literally. The sandwiches ran out on day 10. My fluid intake has been nonexistent. The only thing keeping me alive is a regeneration spell renewed every hour. It’s hard to get out of bed. My hands are losing their precision. It hurts to speak, in a way. There is no pain, thanks to the ring, but I can feel my body not working.

Chivos checks on me. Matti, Theo, Pyro, and Varia visit, as they do every day, but I cannot muster a conversation. Another round of wizards filter by, unable to break my prison. I’m told that they’re searching for spells that handle nourishment and hydration, a rare and dying breed due to how much easier it is to just offer food and drink.

I try to read. It’s the only way I can tire myself out.

I fail.

……

Day 15. At my request, I had been under magical sleep. I was awoken, hopeful to be free. I was not.

“Good morning, Mr. Lawson.”

I hefted my head and spied a few figures. The most important being some nerdy LCE guy. Wore glasses, held a scroll.

“Sorry for waking you, but we think we’ve found some appropriate scrolls for your personal wellbeing. Say something if you feel better, or worse.”

Cue 5 minutes of spellcasting. Some failed, but midway through I started feeling… normal. I sat up and pinched my arm. The skin did not stand like a monument to dehydration. I felt my ribcage. Still not great.

“I think… I think that did something.”

The nerd threw up his hands, then punched his colleague in the shoulder. “YES! I told you, military archives!”

“Fine, you win. Now what about the master copies?”

“We’ll find them. We’ll find them, Mr. Lawson. Then you won’t have to worry about starvation or dehydration anymore!”

He sounded real heroic, for a nerd.

……

Day 16. I felt alright enough to keep reading. There was a lot that bears repeating, but I want to zone in on a particular finding. During the decisions phase on punishments, there was a particular line of interest. There must be a way for those displaced from Earth to learn the true nature of why they ended up on Nassur. 

Not only that, but it had to be hard to access, something that the common man would never find. It must be within the equilibrium that it is available information, but not accidentally findable. If one’s life goal would be to learn the truth, then they should find it, and be fulfilled.

Hang on a minute. That sounds familiar.

……

Day 21. A dispelling team hasn’t visited in a week. I read a great deal. I don’t really know what to make of it anymore. Like reading a user manual written by Cthulhu. Chivos brought me a lectern with a few fiction books, told me it reads them aloud, with voice commands. It was something nice to fall asleep to.

The nerds still hadn’t returned.

……

Day 35. I am awoken from a days-long artificial slumber feeling human again. The nerds were there. They apologized for taking so long to source the rare ingredients for the scrolls. They promised to be quicker on the next batch. Like how the angels promised to have me free by the end of the day.

They hadn’t even figured out how to move my prison.

Chivos came to see me as soon as he heard that I was awake again. He walked in, sent off the guards, and doffed his cap on the public hat rack that had been installed a few weeks back. Damn. A few weeks.

“Good afternoon.”

“Is it?”

He paused. “Good, or the afternoon?” I didn’t answer. “You might be pleased to know that the court case is proceeding well.”

I moved around the desk and sat against it on the floor. “Honestly, I find it difficult to care.”

“I understand. But there is a development. A debate is ongoing on whether to offer Jane a plea deal if she joins the research team to undo her own spell.”

“Mmm, great,” I mumbled, mulling the idea over. “What do you make of it?”

“Personally, I would see them convicted to the fullest extent of the law. However, psych-eval places Jane 2nd-place in honest regret for her actions, and you need freeing.”

I slow-nodded. “Maybe contingent on me actually being freed?”

“Already suggested. It’s in committee.” He sat on his desk. “I heard back from the ringmakers. They don’t have quite as exhaustive a documentation as I had hoped, but it may yet narrow down why reading still hurts you through the ring’s protection.”

“Mmm.”

“It did get me thinking, though. Do you recall disaster plan gamma?”

“Is that the one where you fake your death and come live with me?”

“No, I believe that’s tau.”

“We induce a crash of a faction’s workforce by mass-spreading pro-union propaganda and offering pro-bono legal representation?”

“Plan sigma, that one.”

“We hire a team to kidnap a member of royalty for leverage?”

“That’s not… you’re messing with me, aren’t you?”

“Yeah. I figured it from the ring talk. Plan gamma: Switch on the final spell in the ring, ‘Always a Way Out.’”

We both were silent.

“You think it’ll work?”

He gripped the edge of the desk. “We know the cage is directly tied to your life force. If one goes, so does the other, but this spell is as rare as they come. I doubt even Jane knew of it.”

I slowly spun the ring with my thumb. “Nobody’s ever resurrected before. Not for real.”

“Do you really believe that? The same was said of curing Madame Gossammer’s venom, until it happened. Who is to say Chosen, or genius wizards have not figured out the secrets long ago, and it is only the official narrative that it does not happen? Besides, nobody has ever perished under the effects of Always a Way Out.”

I paused, wondering a number of things to myself. “I don’t really think he cured it. Got rid of the paralysis? Sure. He probably pushed back the damage for later, slowed it down a bit. But ‘cure’ is a stretch.”

“Pedantics, dear.”

I sighed tiredly. “There’s a lot of risks in your suggestion. Are you willing to take them?”

“It doesn’t matter what I think.”

“Really? We are married.”

“Our marriage is no cage, but you are in one. I would, above all else, see you free.”

……

Day 36. Day 36 of no food, no water, nothing to do but read disappointment, or watch all the outside people. I was tired of it.

Matti knew what I was about to do. Theo knew. Pyro knew. Chivos knew. I knew.

Everything that I had read, I summarized to Chivos’ autoledger. Everything that I owned was willed. Everyone that I loved was told goodbye. Matti asked to be there, but I told her not to. It was mean, but it was for me.

The list of people wanting to talk me out of it was long. The few I listened to were unconvincing. It’s one of those times where you just know, deep down, that there is an inevitable conclusion. The greatest minds of the world had pooled their knowledge and came up wanting. Angels and demons that could bend reality at their fingertips could not even dent my prison. And the finest artificers picked their collections clean of anything that could possibly free me.

They weren’t going to find a way out. Bringing Jane on wasn’t going to change that. Maybe take a 0.01% chance to a 0.1% chance. And how long would that take? Months, years sitting in a featureless bubble, sleeping the days away as life passes by?

No, thank you.

I sat on the desk, toying with the ring.

“Cold feet?”

A bit of a loaded question for someone in my position.

“Do you want me to wait for the divination that has a 10% chance to return a vague, worthless hint at my future?”

“No. Forgive your spouse a worried question on the eve of your death.”

My fidgeting stalled. I flicked the ring into my palm. “Right,” I muttered. Words failed me for a moment. I took a breath and collected my thoughts.

“Well, don’t. You know how my life goes. Trust the process. Trust the Shadow Trickster with a luck build.” I took another, deeper breath and squeezed the ring. “Either I’m free… or I’m free.”

Chivos was silent for a moment. “Are you done talking to yourself?”

I toed the line between a laugh and a huff, then looked him in the eye. “Yeah, sure.” I paused, not having much to say. “If I don’t make it, I want the quote on my grave to be ‘Give me liberty, or give me death!’ with an exclamation point.”

He looked down with the faintest of smiles. “I presume this is one of the great Americanisms.”

“Yes indeed. Now, you got any booze, or coffee? I’d like to tell you cheers one last time.”

“Oh… yes, of course.” He rushed to his bag and retrieved a large bottle of whiskey and a crystal glass, pouring himself a shot and returning quickly.

I held out the ring and whispered the secret thought. The spell awoke, but did not take immediate effect. The first time I had activated it, the thing was in fakeout mode. Not anymore. As it glowed a shining orange, I raised it in próst.

“To all that we have done and been. To the mark we leave on the world. And the memories.”

He frowned, stalling a moment. “To fate. And all the *bullshit* it surely still has in store for you.”

“Hey, don’t you get all meta-prophetic on me now.”

And then we drank. He downed his liquor, and I tossed the ring in my mouth and swallowed it with an unglamorous helping of spit. It felt like swallowing a red-hot hula-hoop. I gagged and hacked as I fought it down. The fit took me to my knees as the first surge of pain racked my body.

Hi Charlotte, I recently joined your gangfan 😂😂and became addicted to your YouTube videos. Then I remembered that I had posted my story on Reddit, and I’d love to hear your opinion. I’ll add the update and what happened after that soon 💔😔

I will leave the original post link here too: 

Please excuse my spelling errors; English is not my native language, and also bear with me as this post will be long.

I am a 26-year-old male. 8 years ago, I went to my friend Julia’s birthday party and she introduced me to her friend named Chris, who was a 28-year-old male at the time. 

Chris and I talked a little and he was very attractive, and I was very happy to talk to him. Then, at the end of the party, he asked me to give him my Snapchat so we could stay in touch, and that’s how our friendship started.

At the time, he didn’t know I was gay, and I didn’t know he was bisexual, but talking to him was very enjoyable and I was happy, and I wished that he would be attracted to me as well.
As days went by, he invited me to visit his city since we didn’t live in the same city. I went to his apartment and we had a good time. 

The next morning, he said to me in a voice full of tension and anxiety that he had some feelings for me and couldn’t keep it to himself any longer. He then confessed to me that he was attracted to me and said he didn’t know if I was attracted to men or not.

At that time, I laughed a little, then I kissed him and said I had been attracted to him since the first time I saw him at the birthday party and I was just waiting for the right time to confess this, but he beat me to it.

Since then, we had been dating, and every weekend he came to me or I went to his apartment, and I was very happy with this. I was 19 at the time, and he was my first official romantic relationship, and it felt like I was living a dream.

After two years of our relationship, I went to his city to run some errands with a few friends, and afterwards we went to a restaurant to have a meal. There, I met a young girl, around 10 years old, who seemed familiar to me.

Then, I decided to go to the restroom and passed by the table where she was sitting with her mother and a man I recognized by his voice—it was Chris, yes, the father of the little girl. That’s why she seemed familiar. I greeted them, and his face turned red, and he seemed unable to speak.

Then, his wife spoke in a very gentle voice, which I cannot forget to this day, and asked if she could help me. I said hello to Chris and asked how he was doing, and he said in a fearful voice that it had been a long time since he had seen me.

He then told his wife that I was one of his old colleagues, and his wife invited me to join them for the meal. I said no, my friends were waiting for me in the back, and I left the restaurant, leaving my friends behind, and went back to the train station and returned to my city.

I then called Julia and asked her who Chris was. She said he is her cousin and he is married to one of her sister’s closest friends, and they have a daughter. Then she asked why I was asking all these questions about Chris.

I said nothing and hung up the phone, then I started crying, realizing that for all these years I had been living a huge lie created by Chris.

These past two years, he had been living a double life, thinking only of himself and his own happiness. When I remember that on vacations and weekends he was with me, and that his little daughter was without a father, my heart breaks with sadness, and I start crying again.

The constant crying gave me a headache, then I fell asleep. When I woke up, I charged my phone and found over 200 messages and more than 100 missed calls from Chris.

At that point, I sent him a message saying that what was between us was over, then I blocked his number and all his social media accounts. 

Until five days ago, ( now one year ago) I hadn’t heard anything about him and didn’t ask further. Then I received a call from Julia saying she wanted to meet me.

I expected she just missed me and wanted to see me. When I went to meet her at a coffee shop, she seemed nervous, and I had a feeling the matter was related to Chris.


Then she revealed that Chris and his wife were getting divorced, and that he has come out as bisexual, and that he was in love with me, and that he couldn’t get over me, and he wants me to give him a second chance.

But I rejected the idea and told her I have nothing to do with him, and he caused trauma and because of him I cannot be in a relationship with anyone else because I cannot trust anyone.


Ever since, all my friends have been calling me and sending me messages saying I’m wrong and I should give Chris another chance.

So, AITA for not giving my ex-boyfriend a second chance?

My parents have never been on a cruise or ever expressed any interest in cruises, but they do love all things Disney. I've talked up the cruises a lot so it piqued their interest.

I called and talked them into it and they are now SO excited.  They have been watching movies that the rooms are themed to and they're looking up dinner menus. 😆  I won't even get into my dad's idea for a pirate night costume. Oh I've noticed my mom is now talking about her ""first"" Disney cruise.

Okay I'm not just here to share excitement! Although I'm excited! I have a couple questions. 

- One of my parents has some mobility issues, so walking long distances would be rough. My understanding is that I can go to guest services and ask for transport from the ship to the tram on Lookout Cay. Yes?
- Which coffee bar(s) has pour over coffees on the *Wish*-class?

But for important things (like work, morning pet duties while I’m already at work, etc) she will say ‘my alarm didn’t go off’. She will say that she has no appointments for work that day, then I find out she just cancelled them all. She will literally wake up 3-4 minutes before work and lay in bed and call clients.

And I know it’s just being lazy because like I said if it’s something she wants to do (visit family, go get coffee, breakfast before they stop serving it at certain places etc) then she’s up no problem.

Cul-de-sac



Monday, June 5, 2006, 7:00 AM



It was a nice summer Monday morning in the cul-de-sac. A group of kids were playing soccer together right next to a person’s house. One of the kids kicked the ball into a trash can, which caused a loud noise. Mrs. Cruz, the woman who lived in this house, heard this, and came outside. “Shhhhhhh”, she told them to be quiet. The kids however ignored her and kept playing their game of soccer. Mrs. Cruz gave up and frustratedly went back into her house, trying her best to ignore them. In her bathroom, her young boy was alone in the bathtub taking a bath. Something began moving in and pushing against the closed toilet seat nearby. This caught the boy’s attention and he turned over to see what was in the toilet. Hissing could be heard inside and the toilet seat lifted up. A snake’s head came up from the toilet.



The theme song, intro, and opening titles roll…



State Office



7:30 AM



Meanwhile, at the State Office, Helena was taken into the maximum security wing, and put in an interrogation room with Kevin, and May, while a State Office guard watched from another room on camera. “You know, this technically counts as a kidnapping. Being brought to the State Office against my will. That’s criminal”, Helena claimed. “Well, Helena. Not necessarily. You’re officially declared dead. Therefore, that doesn’t count for someone that doesn’t officially exist to be kidnapped”, Kevin retorted. “Now, I want you to tell me, and May everything you know about the anomalies”, Kevin continued. “You remind me of a Utahraptor I encountered in the Jurassic. It must have came from another anomaly because Utahraptors were native to the Cretaceous”, she responded. “A refusal to cooperate, huh?”, Kevin asked. A State Office guard handed may a message. “We have another anomaly incursion in the cul-de-sac!”, May declared to Helena, and Kevin. “Satisfied?”, Kevin asked Helena. Helena gave him an evil smile and nodded yes.



Cul-de-sac



7:40 AM



Captain Jonny and his men rushed to the cul-de-sac. They pulled up at Mrs. Cruz’s house and headed in, fully-geared up, one-by-one, single-file. They passed by the group of kids who were still playing soccer, who comically froze with their hands up while the soldiers ran into the house. Ed, Edd, and Double D arrived by car and headed in after the soldiers. Edd caught the kid’s soccer ball and kicked it at the “no ball games” sign. The soldiers were inside the house and aimed their guns. “Should we knock on the bathroom door”, Jonny comically asked. “What are you doing here”, Mrs. Cruz asked after she answered the bathroom door. “We take pest control very seriously”, Ed told her as he came in. Ed, Edd, and the soldiers then walked into the bathroom and found that the snake creature inside was actually just a python. “Guys, it’s only a python!”, Ed called out to the rest of the team that were outside the bathroom. “Argh!”, Mrs. Cruz screamed. “You guys aren’t scared of pythons?”, she shouted. “Ouch! You just hurt my ears!”, Double D commented on her loud scream.



State Office



7:50 AM



Back in the State Office’s interrogation room, May, and Kevin were still interrogating Helena. “It was just a false alarm. The creature was just an illegally imported pet python that escaped into the cul-de-sac drains”, May confirmed to Kevin. “Did you already know it was a false alarm, Helena?”, Kevin asked. Helena did not respond and just smiled. “I heard that you told Ed that you knew how to find the anomalies. Is that true?”, Kevin pressed. “That’s none of your business”, Helena told him. “That kind of knowledge of how to pre-locate anomalies would be very valuable to us and it is a citizen’s duty to give such valuable knowledge to the government if they can”, Kevin told her. “I can’t be a citizen if I can’t exist, can I? Therefore, I don’t have to comply with that duty”, Helena remarked. “If you don’t comply, we will get your anomaly knowledge from you the hard way, Helena!”, Kevin angrily threatened, tired of her refusal to cooperate, and answer his questions. “How can you stand working with someone like this guy?” Helena asked May about her job with Kevin. “Our anomaly operation is about saving people’s lives and you can help with that by telling us all you know about the anomalies that they don’t”, May told her more calmly. Helena said nothing but thought about it to herself a second. “Bring Ed to me and I will reveal to you all everything I know about the anomalies”, Helena agreed.



Cul-de-sac house



8:00 AM



Back at the cul-de-sac house, Ed was walking through Mrs. Cruz’s house while on the phone with May Kanker. “‘I’m sorry for missing your calls. I’ve been busy interrogating Helena”, May apologized. “I’m the reason you’re still on the anomaly team at all”, May told him. “They need me too bad to get rid of me. I started this whole thing in the first place”, Ed told May. “Well, now, we need each other more than ever”, May told the Ed. “How is Helena’s interrogation going? I hope that she is infuriating and annoying Kevin to hell”, Ed asked. “Come over to the State Office at once!”, May demanded.



8:10 AM



Back in Mrs. Cruz’s bathroom, Edd handled the python with the help of Marie. “This python is luckily only a baby, as a full-grown one would be up to 20 feet long”, Double D told Edd. Edd was scared of the python. Marie noticed this fear, but Edd quickly covered it up. “I love snakes”, he claimed. Edd gave the python to Marie and headed off to get a big sack to put the python in. “We’ll just take it to a zoo”, Marie told him before he left. “Can I sleep on in your trailer for a few days until I sort out the issues with my house?”, Double D asked. “We’ll worry about that later”, Marie dismissed and told him. Edd had returned with the large sack. Marie put the python in it and then left for a coffee break, leaving Edd in charge of the python. Edd turned to Double D. “Erm, please can you do it, just this once?”, Double D asked the former.



State Office



8:15 AM



In the State Office’s interrogation room, Helena, and Ed were alone face-to-face together. “How are the State Office treating you”, Ed asked her. “Stop acting like you care about me. You don’t. All you did was set me up to be taken back to the modern day by force”, Helena told him. “That’s not true. I didn’t set you up yesterday”, Ed told the truth to her. “I don’t believe you”, Helena told him. Ed didn’t respond and didn’t care. Helena looked around the interrogation room as she was being watched on camera. “Our conversation is being monitored”, Helena told Ed. “That’s just great”, Ed remarked sarcastically. “I want you to help me escape”, Helena told Ed. “Look, if you want my help, tell me what you know about the anomalies, and how to find them”, Ed told her. “The question as to why the anomalies occur is the least of our concerns”, Helena commented to his confusion. She looked around once more as she was watched on camera. “Ok, I’ll agree to help you”, Helena agreed. “Within the next few hours, a pack of saber-toothed cats will begin rampaging through Central Peach Creek”, Helena told Ed, leaving him shocked, and horrified as he realized the chaos, and destruction the saber-toothed killers could, and would cause.



Park N’ Flush Trailer Park



8:20 AM



John and Gideon drove Double D to Marie’s trailer, in the Park N’ Flush Trailer Park. They drove him there in their camper van and gave him a lift over. “We would have been happy to let you stay at our house instead”, John told Double D. “Eh, staying at Marie’s was a better offer”, Double D told him. Eds was about to walk out into Marie’s trailer. “Hey! You forgot one of your bags!”, John told him. Double D retrieved his bag and saw that John, and Gideon had a Roswell alien keyring on it. “That’s a housewarming present from me and Gideon”, John told the confused Double D. Double D then walked out of the camper van towards Marie’s trailer. “You turned it on”, John told Gideon. The Roswell alien keyring was a disguised device which the two planned to use to find out Double D’s new secret life.



Marie’s trailer



8:25 AM



Marie was feeding Rex in her trailer. The doorbell rang and she quickly went to the door to answer it. She looked out the door to see who it was and found it was Double D. “Hi, Marie. I’m here to sleep. You said we would talk about it”, Double D explained. “I don’t remember ever telling you that”, Marie said. “Can you kiss me on the lips in front of them?”, Double D asked Marie. “Hell, no!”, Marie clearly, and openly refused. “I’ll pay you money if you do it”, Double D offered. The annoyed and shocked Marie opened the trailer door all the way. “Oh my god”, John, and Gideon saw Marie’s half-naked body, awestruck in shock. “If you don’t kiss me, I will tell the State Office that you are secretly keeping Rex”, Double D threatened. Marie reluctantly kissed Marie in front of John and Gideon in their camper van. “Wow”, they both said, awestruck with Double D’s luck with girls before he headed into the trailer with Marie. The Roswell alien keyring was actually a tracking device in disguise and John, and Gideon checked its signal on their sat nav. As they checked the signal, Double D waved to them before heading into the trailer.



Marie’s trailer



8:30 AM



“Wow! This place is so cool!”, Double D said excitedly. He was thrilled and excited to be staying here in Marie’s trailer. He enjoyed himself with her exercise gear and then relaxed on her couch with Rex. Back outside in the trailer park, John, and Gideon were bored in their camper van, and were waiting for the Roswell tracking device to tell them something was happening in the trailer. Suddenly, Edd had arrived. “Hey, Gideon! Edd’s here!”, John alerted his friend. “Double D’s in big trouble. That’s REALLY Marie’s boyfriend”, Gideon noted, in the belief that Marie, and Edd were together instead of her with Double D. Edd walked up to the door of Marie’s trailer and rang the doorbell. Marie answered the door and said, “Hello, Edd”. “Oh my god, look at you”, Edd commented on the way she was dressed. Marie then walked him in.



8:35 AM



“He’s cooked. Haha”, the two laughed. Marie quickly covered Rex up with a towel over his case before Edd could see him Marie went to get dressed for the day. “Am I interrupting something?’, Edd asked. “Nope”, Marie told him. “Oh, hey, Edd!”, Double D arrived. “You’re here, too?”, Edd said. “Me and Marie have grown pretty close”, Double D stated. “Why are you both only in underwear?”, Edd asked. “It’s because the thermostat is very high”, Marie told him. “It’s too hot”, Double D said. “It’s because it’s stuck on high”, Marie explained. “Hmmmmm… I think otherwise”, Edd suspected. Edd took a look around at all of Marie’s pet reptiles while Double D kept Rex’s case covered. “Get dressed and come over to the State Office, you two. Helena is just now beginning to talk”, Edd told them.



State Office



8:40 AM



Back at the State Office, Helena was alone in the interrogation room. “Helena warned me about saber-toothed cats. According to her, there is a pride of Smilodon on the other side of an anomaly in Central Peach Creek”, Ed explained to Kevin, and May. “We only have a matter of time before the pride go through the anomaly into the modern day into Peach Creek”, Ed continued. “Where in Peach Creek is the anomaly located?”, May asked him. “She refused to tell me and she said it’s a surprise. She wants to take us there herself”, Ed told her. “This is suspicious and it has to be a trick”, May told him. “I’m convinced that Helena is actually trying to attempt to prove that she’s not as callous as you two think”, Ed explained his beliefs to Kevin, and May. “I don’t believe that due to her keeping calm and collected in spite of the Smilodon incursion she warned us of”, Kevin said. “Helena is selfish, but that doesn’t mean she is truly evil”, Ed admitted. “I’m not sure you’re right, Ed. Helena has changed so much over the last 8 years and you haven’t seen her since then”, May doubted. “I don’t trust the woman at all”, Kevin said. “If Helena is telling the truth about the Smilodon, then there could be a bloody massacre out there in Peach Creek, as a consequence of your doubt, and distrust. Kevin and May thought about this for a minute, while Helena silently watched from the interrogation room.



Peach Creek Soccer Stadium



9:25 AM



The team and the soldiers drove to the Peach Creek Soccer Stadium in Central Peach Creek. Everyone got out of the car and Helena led Ed, May, and the soldiers into the stadium and into its kitchens. The State Office and the soldiers searched and scanned through the kitchens, while Helena walked up to look at a sealed, stainless steel fridge. May noticed this and came over. “The anomaly is in the fridge”, Helena told her. “Is this true, Ed?”, May asked. Ed came over to May and watched Helena very closely, and suspiciously. Double D walked up to the fridge and checked the magnetic interference with the supposed anomaly with his compass. However, his compass was unaffected. “The steel doors are too thick for the magnetic field”, Helena confirmed. “Is she telling the truth?”, May asked Ed. “It’s possible”, Ed noted. “Watch her”, May told Captain Jonny 2×4. Helena opened the fridge to see if the anomaly really was there.



9:30 AM



May went to reach for the doors. “Stop!”, Helena stopped her, much to her, and Ed’s annoyance. “The Smilodon pride may have already come through the anomaly and are waiting to ambush us in the fridge”, Helena justified her response to May and Ed. “I’m losing patience with her”, May told Ed. ” I can understand”, Ed told her. Edd just smiled at Ed’s remark. “She has to be lying about this”, May remarked. “Dare to try that belief”, Helena told her confidently. May had Edd go over to the fridge. “It’s padlocked”, he told her. “Here, use this”, Helena offered him a knife.

9:35 AM

Edd took the knife and used it to remove the padlock. The team and the soldiers gathered together. The soldier aimed their guns at the fridge, in preparation for the supposed saber-toothed killers that would come out according to Helena. Jonny 2×4 came over and he joined Edd in pulling the fridge doors open. Unbeknownst to the team, Helena, or the soldiers, several ladles began to move towards the fridge’s direction, continuing to do so as the fridge opened wider. All of a sudden, a spoon flew across the kitchen towards the fridge as the team, and all of the soldiers ducked. Edd grabbed the spoon before it could hit Double D’s head. “It’s time for you to duck”, Edd told Double D. Dozens of metal forks and spoons were caught in the magnetic field of the anomaly and flew across the kitchen, over the team’s, and the soldier’s heads, who luckily ducked in time. They all flew into the anomaly in the fridge. “You would be a bad at poker and auctions because of your wrong guess as to whether or not the anomaly was real!”, Helena joked to May, much to the latter’s annoyance.



9:40 AM



Meanwhile, John, and Gideon were in the parking lot of the stadium. They were spying on two soldiers guarding the stadium entrance from their camper van. As they spied, they pretended to read newspapers in their van. “This has to be a massive US government conspiracy similar to Roswell and Area 51. I think there is a secret government bunker that they’re hiding under the stadium”, John said. “Why would there be a top-secret government bunker in a soccer stadium of all places”, Gideon asked. However, this almost broke his, and John’s newspaper routine from the guards in the process. “Well, Gideon. The Peach Creek Soccer Stadium would be the last place anyone to expect to find a top-secret government base of operations. That reason alone would make it the perfect place for one”, John explained. The two kept spying as the two soldier guards headed into the stadium. “This top-secret government organization is very clever and intelligent”, John noted.



9:45 AM



Back in the stadium kitchens, Double D found a stack of delicious meat pies. “Who’s hungry?”, he asked. “GASP! The meat in those pies will draw the Smilodon through the anomaly!”, Helena claimed, horrified at this discovery. Captain Jonny and his men held Helena back and Ed went over to the fridge to remove the pies. “Act immediately if we intend to stop the Smilodon from coming through!”, Helena commanded to Jonny. Ed, Double D, and the soldier team began to remove all of the pies from the fridge as Helena stood by, and watched. She was clearly waiting for something. Unbeknownst to the team, she was planning an escape. As soon as she had a straight shot to the fridge, Helena suddenly ran at it, and escaped through the anomaly. Ed tried to go after her, but was stopped by one of the soldiers. “Go after her, Jonny!”, May ordered to the captain. As the same soldier continued to hold Ed back from going into the anomaly, Edd ran through the anomaly before any of the soldiers could stop him.



Unknown time period



9:50 AM



Edd came out on the other side of the anomaly and subsequently rolled down a hill to where Captain Jonny was. “What the hell?”, Edd said, amazed in awe. Jonny noticed Edd and the two looked around at a place the anomaly had sent them: a world of grassy hills in an unknown time period and location, surrounded by dozens of other anomalies.

Monday, June 5, 2006, 10:00 AM



Back in the stadium kitchens, Ed, and the team looked at pictures of the anomaly-filled hills on the other side of the stadium anomaly in amazement. “A Spaghetti Junction. That’s what I’ll name it”, Double D said. “Nice name, Double D”, Marie told him. “We have little to no chance of recapturing Helena because of all the anomalies back there. She could have gone through any one of them and that would make finding her in the Spaghetti Junction very difficult”, Edd noted. “There wasn’t a single saber-toothed cat in the Junction, so the incursion that Helena warned us about was a trick to escape”, Edd confirmed to May. “We stopped you back there Ed because I think you would have tried to follow her rather than stop her”, May firmly confronted. “I wouldn’t have tried to follow her. Plus, why would she want to escape when I want the answers most?”, Ed asked. May did not respond or reply.



10:05 AM



Suddenly, the squawk of a bird could be heard from the anomaly. Captain Jonny and his men took aim at the anomaly while the rest of the team watched, and waited as the squawks grew closer. Suddenly, a dodo came out from the anomaly, and quickly ran off between the team members, and the soldiers into the kitchen. The team were surprised by this, when all of a sudden, 4 more dodos came through the anomaly, and scattered past the team, and around the kitchen. “Catch them quick before they escape!”, Ed instructed. May found one of the dodos that was between two sets of ovens and cupboards, therefore meaning it could only move backwards, and she attempted to herd the bird toward her. Edd, Double D, Marie, and two State Office scientists located, and attempted to corner another dodo, but it was too fast, and slipped between them until it ran into a cupboard. In another part of the kitchen, a soldier ran into one dodo, and tried to grab it as it ran. One of the dodos avoided detection from the team and headed into the kitchen exit, where it found Double D’s bag. The dodo swallowed a toy banana in the bag and then also the Roswell alien tracker keyring.



10:10 AM



In the parking lot outside the stadium, John, and Gideon got out of their camper van, and spied on the stadium entrance as their Roswell tracker, which detected the dodo that swallowed it moving, indicated that Double D was also on the move. In the stadium kitchens, the dodo that swallowed the tracker wandered out through the kitchen exit. Two soldiers herded another dodo into the kitchen towards Ed, who used his coat as a barrier, and to keep its attention. The dodo that trapped itself in the cupboard got out, but was quickly caught by Edd who put a trash can over it. Ed used his coat barrier to force the dodo into a nurse’s office that was nearby before locking it in. The team were all thrilled and amazed at the sight of these dodos that came out of nowhere. Edd still had his dodo under the trash can and did a good job of catching it with this. In the stadium parking lot, the Roswell kept indicating that Double D had left the stadium, and was coming into the parking lot. John and Gideon saw that the dodo that ate the Roswell emerge from the stadium instead of Double D. “I think they turned Double D into a turkey”, Gideon said. “That’s not a turkey. That’s a dodo. A bird that went extinct way back in the 1600s. Let’s catch it”, John said. He and Gideon ran out to catch the dodo.



10:20 AM



In the stadium’s nurse office in the kitchens, Ed was with the dodos. He observed them with awe and happiness as the rest of the team watched from the doorway. “I love them. They’re so cute”, Marie said. “They’re very stupid”, Double D said. “They’re not stupid. They’re just very trusting because on their home island of Mauritius, they didn’t have any native predators It’s not their fault they went extinct”, Marie explained, in defense of the dodos. “You’re a lot more sentimental for the dodos than you were of the Gorgonops”, Double D pointed out. “All of the dodos have been rounded up”, Edd confirmed to May. “We should send the dodos back through before their absence from home causes a ripple effect. Everyone grab a dodo”, Ed instructed.



10:25 AM



Back in the stadium parking lot, John, and Gideon went back into their camper van. They had caught the missing dodo that had eaten the Roswell. “If he looks like a dodo, and it walks like a dodo, then it is in fact a living dodo”, John said. “That can only mean one thing: the government conspiracy from the Peach Creek Soccer Stadium is that they are secretly cloning extinct animals”, John continued. “Why would they choose a dodo to clone?”, Gideon asked. “It would be better to start with a dodo than a dangerous, predatory dinosaur like a raptor or a T-Rex”, John explained. The two then started up their camper van and drove off. The dodo was shocked and confused by the moving vehicle.



10:30 AM



In the kitchens of the Peach Creek Soccer Stadium, Ed, and the soldiers herded the dodos back into the anomaly. One of the dodos reached the anomaly and walked back through, while Edd, and Marie gently forced the next dodo back into the anomaly with a metal plate, which caught its curiosity. “I love these guys so much. They’re some of the cutest we’ve encountered”, Marie sentimentally commented. The dodo ran back through. “So, Double D’s moved in?”, Edd asked. “It’s only temporary”, Marie replied. Double D goofily played with a ladle, as Ed, Edd, and the soldiers got the next dodo to enter the anomaly. The dodo then ran back through. All of the dodos had returned back through the anomaly. “What you saw of me and Double D in my trailer earlier doesn’t mean that anything was going on between us”, Double D confirmed. “Over here!”, Captain Jonny called Ed, and May over to the nurse’s office where the team were holding the dodos to show them that the last dodo to be sent through the anomaly had sadly died, which saddened the team. “Poor little guy”, Ed said sadly. “What happened?”, Marie asked. “Maybe it died from eating one of the pies”, Double D commented, while monitoring the magnetic stability of the anomaly with his compass. “Double D! “, Marie scolded. “I’m sorry”, he apologized for his inappropriate joke. “We should do an autopsy on it to see what killed it”, Ed said. “It could have just been a side-effect of passing through the anomaly”, Edd suggested. “I don’t think so because you went through the anomaly and left with no ill symptoms”, Ed said. “The anomaly’s magnetic field is weakening”, Double D warned Ed, and Edd.



John and Gideon’s house



11:00 AM



John and Gideon were in their house in the cul-de-sac. They watched the missing dodo they had caught with excitement and awe. “Me and you are gonna use this dodo as evidence to expose this whole government conspiracy, and become mega rich”, John told Gideon excitedly. The dodo suddenly wrecked Gideon’s MP3 player and pulled it. “Not my MP3!”, Gideon exclaimed, upset by this. “We shouldn’t worry about the dodo messing up our stuff because think about it: we can buy even better versions of it to replace it once we get the money as a reward for exposing the conspiracy”, John explained. The dodo then frantically ran behind a nearby table and John and Gideon followed it. The dodo vomited on John’s converse shoe collection. “Not my Converse All-Stars!”, John exclaimed in frustration. “Now we’re even!”, Gideon remarked. “Ewwww! I feel sick!”, Gideon said, repulsed by the smell of the dodo vomit. “Don’t contaminate that vomit with your own. I intend to collect it and sell it online”, John told him.",1,1758222463.0,ededdneddy,0,1.0,False

i had just launched my app and was desperately thinking:

* should i start a tiktok? (too much effort, zero energy for content that day)
* should i throw money at instagram ads? (no creatives ready, no time)

i needed another channel. something different.

and then it hit me: tinder.

yep. tinder.

i fired up nano banana, generated a few photos of a pretty normal girl:

* one jogging in the woods
* one working on a macbook
* one sipping a long island

the profile? “marketing girl at stealth startup.”  
not “model-tier gorgeous” — i even added some realistic imperfections. tossed in a cliché like being a *friends* fan.

then i left my phone aside.  
20 minutes later: **99+ likes**. every swipe right = instant match. (oh, men…)

when they messaged, i “confessed” i was bummed because “our client's app wasn’t getting enough downloads.”  
cue the classic responses:

* *“send me the link, i’ll download. but you owe me a coffee 😉”*
* *“happy to support, what’s the app?”*

some even went as far as subscribing — maybe for the coffee, maybe for curiosity.

i played it cool (“going into a meeting, ttyl”) and bounced.

**ethical? nope.**  
**shady? probably.**  
**effective? 100%.**

I've been meaning to share my experience with electric kettles vs microwaves for heating water. After years of using both methods, I can confidently say that switching to an electric kettle was a game-changer for my daily routine.

I used to be that person who'd stick a mug of water in the microwave for my morning tea or instant coffee. Sure, it worked, but there were always those annoying hot spots, and sometimes the water wouldn't be hot enough. Plus, I'd have to guess the right time to get it to the right temperature.

The biggest difference I noticed when I switched to an electric kettle was the consistency. Every single time, I get perfectly heated water at exactly the right temperature. No more testing with my finger or having to reheat my mug! I found this amazing model at https://athometouch.com/electric-kettle that actually lets you choose different temperature settings for different types of drinks.

Here's what really sold me on electric kettles:

1. They're way faster than microwaves. My kettle boils water in about 3-4 minutes, while the microwave takes nearly twice as long.

2. Energy efficiency is better. Kettles are designed specifically for heating water, while microwaves use more power trying to heat everything inside.

3. Safety features are great - auto shut-off when water boils, boil-dry protection, and no risk of superheating (which can actually happen in microwaves!)

4. The capacity is bigger - I can make multiple cups at once instead of heating one mug at a time.

One thing I really love about modern electric kettles is their precise temperature control. When I'm making green tea, I can set it to 175°F, and for coffee, I bump it up to 200°F. You can check out different temperature settings on this model here: https://athometouch.com/electric-kettle

The only downside I've found is that kettles take up counter space, but honestly, I use mine so much that it's worth it. Plus, many modern ones look pretty sleek and actually add to your kitchen's appearance.

Cost-wise, electric kettles are super reasonable considering how much use you get out of them. Mine has lasted over two years now, and I use it multiple times daily for everything from tea and coffee to instant oatmeal and ramen.

For anyone still on the fence, I'd say give it a shot. It's one of those purchases that you don't realize how much you needed until you have it. The convenience factor alone makes it worth it, but the perfect temperature every time is what really makes me glad I made the switch.

Let me know if you have any questions about electric kettles vs microwaves - I'm happy to share more about my experience!",1,1758222252.0,HomePicks,0,1.0,False

i had just launched my app and was desperately thinking:

* should i start a tiktok? (too much effort, zero energy for content that day)
* should i throw money at instagram ads? (no creatives ready, no time)

i needed another channel. something different.

and then it hit me: tinder.

yep. tinder.

i fired up nano banana, generated a few photos of a pretty normal girl:

* one jogging in the woods
* one working on a macbook
* one sipping a long island

the profile? “marketing girl at stealth startup.”  
not “model-tier gorgeous” — i even added some realistic imperfections. tossed in a cliché like being a *friends* fan.

then i left my phone aside.  
20 minutes later: **99+ likes**. every swipe right = instant match. (oh, men…)

when they messaged, i “confessed” i was bummed because “our client's app wasn’t getting enough downloads.”  
cue the classic responses:

* *“send me the link, i’ll download. but you owe me a coffee 😉”*
* *“happy to support, what’s the app?”*

some even went as far as subscribing — maybe for the coffee, maybe for curiosity.

i played it cool (“going into a meeting, ttyl”) and bounced.

1nkh6ui,https://www.reddit.com/r/HomeStressTest/comments/1nkh6ui/should_you_buy_the_nsdirect_round_coffee_table/,Should You Buy the NSdirect Round Coffee Table for Your Living Room?,"NSdirect 1 coffee table entered my living room a few weeks ago, and its presence has genuinely transformed the space. I must admit the light walnut finish fits superbly, adding warmth and character. Its round design, with a 36-inch diameter and 18-inch height, is both practical and visually appealing. The piece feels sturdy yet lightweight enough to move around whenever I get that itch to rearrange furniture. Let me guide you through the good, the not-so-ideal, and how it compares to others in its segment.

**Style and Aesthetic Value**  
The rustic charm of this coffee table immediately caught my eye. Its light walnut finish, complemented by the wood grain veneer on the top, gives it a vintage farmhouse vibe. Whether you're going for a minimalist or bohemian setup, this table fits effortlessly into various design styles. The metal legs, coated in a matte finish, add a modern twist to the rustic feel. The combination truly enhances the room's overall aesthetic.

**Strengths**  
- The spacious 36-inch round tabletop is ideal for entertaining or casual family coffee sessions.  
- The additional bottom shelf—33.5 inches in diameter—is a lifesaver for keeping my space clutter-free. Toys, magazines, remotes—you name it; it fits.  
- Its multi-step waterproof and wear-resistant veneer ensures it doesn’t just look good but stays that way.  
 
**Build and Durability**  
One of the key things you notice when you put it together is how robust it feels. The MDF top, classified as P2 environmental grade, is paired with strong metal legs. During game nights or when my kids clamber on top (yes, they do this a lot), the coffee table stays rock solid. Unlike other dubious products, this one confidently supports up to 300 pounds. I’ve also spilled drinks on it already (who hasn’t?), and thanks to the veneer finish, clean-up has been as easy as a quick wipe with a soft cloth.

**Areas of Concern**  
- While the veneer is wear-resistant, it doesn’t take kindly to overly hot items unless you use a coaster.  
- For those seeking customizable furniture, this may disappoint as there are no adjustable features or options in terms of size.  

**Assembly Experience**  
Few things make me groan louder than overly complicated furniture assemblies. With this coffee table, though, even I had nothing to complain about. The boxed tools got the job done, and I wrapped it up well under 30 minutes. Pro tip: Just follow the included manual step-by-step, and you’ll be golden.  

[Score a deal on NSdirect 1 coffee table: Check Amazon.](https://verycosy.com/p/b0888jvzh4/)  

**Storage Utility**  
The extra shelf below isn’t just functional; it’s game-changing. This is where my living room stays sane. Board games, coloring books, and even a small basket with controllers all sit neatly in one place. When you’ve got limited space to spare, furniture with thoughtful storage options is invaluable.  

**Market Rivals**  
While NSdirect’s coffee table met most of my expectations, I did eyeball competitor tables before making my choice. There’s the Walker Edison Modern Round Coffee Table, which has a similarly clean design but lacks the sturdy metal legs that impressed me here. I was also tempted by the GreenForest Coffee Table, which has a contemporary glass top—a great option for modern spaces but perhaps less child-friendly and heavy on maintenance. Compared to such alternatives, this table strikes the right balance between durability and the desirable farmhouse aesthetic.

**Price to Quality Ratio**  
This table really doesn’t feel like something budget-friendly once you’ve set it up. Sure, there are cheaper options in bulk-produced furniture, but they rarely pull off the durable build or thoughtful design. If you’re on a budget but refuse to compromise on looks and stability, this is an investment that makes sense.

Personally,  I give a lot of liquid offerings like teas and coffees. Plus food when I make a homecooked meals, since I really love to cook. So, most of my offerings are food and drink.

How I do it is that I leave the offering and then light a stick of incense associated with that deity. Then I use that incense stick to time how long I leave the offering out. That's just how I do it. I'm not entirely sure where I got the idea from.

For instance, I just left out peach-orange twinning tea for Lord Hermes (That stuff is absolutely delicious by the way ) and lit a stick of frankincense incense and I'm letting it burn out completely then I'll ask Lord Hermes permission to drink it and share it between us once the stick is burnt out.

Yeah, using incense to time my offerings is my method. What is yours?",2,1758222237.0,Hellenism,3,1.0,False

1nkh4vf,https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/1nkh4vf/my_friend_found_a_device_that_lets_you_hear_god/,My friend found a device that lets you hear God. But the messages we received were… disturbing.,"Ms. Robinson called Tommy out three times during class. He kept opening and closing his notebook, spinning his pen between his fingers, and giving me that grin that said *I’ve got a secret too good to keep*.

“I found a device that lets you hear God,” he told me at lunch, after he finished ranting about how all the teachers sucked.

“What do you mean?” I asked, confused.

He told me he’d been chatting to people on mysticism forums, and they mailed him this gadget, saying it was a direct line to God’s voice. The Creator Himself.

I figured it was just another one of Tommy’s weird obsessions. We were two awkward, chronically online kids, and he had a thing for conspiracy theories.

I laughed and told him he was losing it. That’s when he dug into his pocket and pulled out the 'thing'.

It looked like a flash drive with a cheap earbud attached. Almost like an old MP3 player I’d once found in my mom’s junk box.

“Mark, this will blow your mind,” he said, grinning. “Just put it in your ear for a while when you’re home. For some reason it doesn’t always work, but at night it usually kicks in.”

Then he shoved the device into my hand and told me to bring it back the next day.

That night I went to bed early, feeling like an idiot for even putting the thing in my ear. But it was still better than lying awake listening to my parents fight like they did every night.

I lay there waiting, pretty sure it was all a prank Tommy cooked up to laugh at me in the morning. The device was metal, no labels, no lights, nothing to even prove it was on.

It was only when I was almost asleep that I heard something. A strange static, like a weak radio signal. Like wind blowing into a mic.

That lasted a few minutes, then a low voice started to come through.

It was calm, almost androgynous, barely loud enough to hear. A few lines stood out clear:

*You are my child.*  
*And one day we’ll be together again.*  
*Let my voice guide your way to the light.*

The same lines repeated a few times, and then silence.

The next day Tommy was just as restless in class and got just as many warnings from the teacher. This time because he couldn’t wait to hear what I thought.

At break I told him I heard it, though I still thought it was nothing special.

He swore it was. Said every night these words were different, new teachings or whatever. He told me his first time had been like mine, but that the voice was saying new things now. He was a few sessions ahead of me.

I asked what it said, and he shook his head. I’d have to hear it myself.

So we made a deal about the device: one night with him, one night with me.

And sure enough, the messages shifted. Still in that same pleasant, almost hypnotic tone, but the short phrases turned to themes of love, perseverance, and self-acceptance. We started calling them “the lessons,” and they rarely lasted more than fifteen minutes.

For both of us it turned out to be a pleasant escape. For me, from the endless fights between my parents and their neglect. For Tommy, from the fact that it was clear he was going to fail the year. His grades were a disaster, and he clashed with teachers constantly.

We spent whole classes daydreaming about the voice, and every break trading theories. The truth is, over time we started to believe it could actually be God.

That voice just had this pull and calm that you can’t really explain to anyone who hasn’t heard it. I could listen to it for hours.

But all that was before it turned... let’s say, *aggressive*.

\*\*\*

One day Tommy showed up at school with this serious look. He sat through class quiet and still, which was totally unlike him.

At break he told me he’d left the device at home and would give it to me the next day. I asked why he seemed so weird.

“He said my name,” he explained, staring at nothing like he was in a trance. “The voice said my name and said I was special. That I was a blessing against the unjust.”

Tommy was still a few lessons ahead of me in what the voice taught, but it had already started talking to me about what it called the 'unjust'. In my last session, it said:

*To the unjust there remains only the blessing of the light.*  
*The good must not merely walk away from them but face them.*

It sounded abstract, and I still had no idea what it meant.

“We were chosen,” Tommy finally said, grabbing my shoulders. ""He's giving us a path to him.""

He didn’t come to school the next day, or for the rest of that week. I called, texted, nothing. I wondered how many lessons he had gotten through by then.

I didn’t hear from him until the following Monday morning. I was half asleep from another night of my parents yelling at each other. When I opened the front door there was a brown paper bag on the porch.

Inside it was the device and a scrap of paper with a handwritten note.

*""hey mark*  
*please don't come to school today*  
*trust me please and remember we were chosen*  
*tommy""*

I didn’t get it, and tried calling Tommy again with no answer. Still, I felt I could not ignore his warning.

I tucked the thing in my pocket and walked to a local park so my parents wouldn’t know I was skipping class, not that they would care much.

\*\*\*

It's been two months since the horrible things Tommy did that day.

That morning he came to school very early, while the teachers were drinking coffee and preparing for classes.

Armed with his dad’s handgun, he opened fire, killing four of them. He emptied an entire magazine into Ms. Robinson.

Then Tommy ended his own life.

The cops, the news, and the whole town still haven't figured out why. People guessed mental health, bullying, politics, all that stuff. The truth is something I keep to myself: I know it was the voice.

I haven't shown anyone his note.

And I still have it with me. The device.

Although I didn’t have the courage to use it for a few weeks, I actually missed the peace it gave me. I only tried it again last night.

But the voice I heard from it wasn't the one I was used to. It was another one. *Tommy's voice*.

What he said must have lasted a little over a minute, but I'm sure it was him, because he called my name.

*Mark, we were chosen.*  
*The unjust were brought to the light by my hand.*  
*And you must come meet me too.*

Before he finished I ripped the device from my ear and threw it across the room, decided I was hallucinating.

After a few seconds, I regretted it and went to get it. Could it really be my friend?

I slowly put the device on again, and soon the voice returned. Not Tommy's. The other one.

And the last ""lesson"" still haunts me, because I know what it wants from me, and I'm afraid that if I keep listening to it, I'll believe him.

\*\*\*

*You are a blessed being, Mark.*  
*Born and raised to be light.*  
*Your father and mother fell to the path of the unjust.*  
*And it's your duty to do the right thing for them, just like your brother Thomas did.*  
*You are special.*

It is with a heavy heart and great sadness and disappointment that I bring to you the news that our landlords, King’s Red and White and VS Rich Property Services, have asked us to remove the community fridge and pantry in front of our building.

It is our experience at Omie’s that no one has been endangered or in harm’s way because of the fridge’s existence. We have been grateful to meet new neighbors this way, and have made connections with many people we otherwise may not have met. I was humbled daily to see the way our community showed up for their neighbors.

In a world that feels harsher than ever, the fridge was an extension of Omie’s big, unrelenting, inviting love.

I encourage you to love every member of your community, even those in crisis, with the same voracity. Our communities work best when everyone has a place at the table.

We are hoping to announce the new location of the fridge as soon as possible. It is very important to us and the wonderful folks at DCF to do everything in our power to keep the fridge in the neighborhood, as we’ve seen the huge need for it, and seen how well it can work.

To love is to resist the powers and systems that be – and that’s what we’ll keep doing.

1nkgypx,https://i.redd.it/czrl40hrzypf1.jpeg,"Strong Teeth, Naturally: How to Get More Calcium Every Day","Strong teeth aren’t just about brushing and flossing — they depend heavily on calcium. Calcium is the key mineral that gives your teeth and bones their hardness and durability. Without enough of it, teeth can weaken, enamel may erode, and cavities or sensitivity can creep in.

The good news? You don’t always need supplements to support your calcium levels. With the right diet and habits, you can naturally boost the calcium in your teeth and keep your smile strong for years to come.

# 🥛 1. Add More Dairy to Your Diet

Milk, cheese, and yogurt are classic calcium-rich foods. They not only supply calcium but also contain casein, a protein that helps strengthen enamel. Cheese, especially, raises the pH in your mouth, reducing acid attacks that cause decay.

**Tip:** A small cube of cheese after meals can act like a natural cavity fighter.

# 🌿 2. Go Beyond Dairy – Plant Sources of Calcium

Not a fan of dairy or lactose intolerant? No worries. Many plant-based foods are rich in calcium too.

* Leafy greens like kale, spinach, and bok choy
* Almonds
* Sesame seeds and tahini
* Figs
* Fortified plant milks (soy, almond, oat)

**Tip:** Pair plant calcium sources with Vitamin D (sunlight or fortified foods) to help your body absorb it better.

# 🐟 3. Include Fish With Edible Bones

Canned salmon or sardines with bones are surprisingly high in calcium. The tiny, soft bones are safe to eat and provide a mineral boost.

**Tip:** Add sardines on toast or mix salmon into salads for a calcium-rich meal.

# 🍊 4. Don’t Forget Vitamin D

Calcium won’t do much good if your body can’t absorb it properly. That’s where Vitamin D comes in. Without enough Vitamin D, calcium just passes through your system unused.

* Sunlight is the best natural source — just 15–20 minutes outdoors daily can help.
* Foods like egg yolks, fortified milk, and fatty fish also provide Vitamin D.

# 🥜 5. Snack on Nuts and Seeds

Almonds, chia seeds, sesame seeds, and flaxseeds all provide a calcium punch along with healthy fats that keep your gums healthy.

**Tip:** Sprinkle sesame seeds over salads or mix chia into smoothies.

# 🍵 6. Drink Less Soda and Caffeine

Soft drinks and excessive coffee or tea can strip calcium from your bones and teeth. Soda is acidic, which erodes enamel, and it also interferes with calcium absorption.

**Tip:** Replace soda with sparkling water or herbal teas for healthier hydration.

# 🦷 7. Use Fluoride Toothpaste

Fluoride doesn’t supply calcium, but it works with calcium and phosphate in your saliva to remineralize teeth. Think of it as a protective shield that helps calcium stay locked in your enamel.

**Tip:** Brush twice a day with fluoride toothpaste and rinse less often after brushing to let fluoride work longer.

# 🍳 8. Balanced Diet Is Key

Your body is a system — too much sugar, alcohol, or processed foods can throw calcium levels off balance. Instead, aim for a diet with:

* Whole grains
* Fruits and veggies
* Lean proteins
* Calcium- and Vitamin D-rich foods

This balance supports both oral and overall health.

# 🌞 9. Lifestyle Habits That Help

* Quit smoking: It interferes with calcium absorption and weakens gums.
* Exercise: Weight-bearing activities like walking or yoga improve bone health, which is linked to your jaw and teeth strength.
* Hydrate: Saliva itself helps remineralize enamel, and hydration keeps it flowing.

# Final Thoughts 💡

Increasing calcium in your teeth naturally isn’t about one miracle food or product. It’s about consistently including calcium-rich foods, supporting absorption with Vitamin D, limiting harmful drinks, and maintaining strong oral hygiene.

If you suspect low calcium or frequent tooth issues, it’s worth visiting your dentist for a check-up. They can guide you on whether diet alone is enough or if you need professional treatment like fluoride varnish or remineralization therapy.

👉 Remember: a strong smile starts with small daily choices — and boosting calcium is one of the best you can make.",2,1758221740.0,SmileBetterCommunity,1,1.0,False

Suspended in pale blue liquid, a teenage boy hung like a ghost in limbo. Wires and tubes slithered from his limbs and neck, glowing softly with rhythmic pulses of light. The tank enclosing him was scratched and fogged, faintly humming with outdated tech and neglected maintenance. A soft hiss escaped from a broken valve nearby, filling the cyberpunk med-bay with a high-pitched whine that barely registered through the layers of synthetic fluid in his ears.

The room around the tank was dimly lit, cluttered with medical debris, rusted panels, and half-dead monitors. Neon graffiti bled across cracked tiles. On the far wall, a ventilation fan creaked as it turned, coughing out smoke that smelled faintly like burnt oil and ozone. This was no hospital. This was a back-alley resurrection.

Then, the draining began.

With a gurgling churn, the fluid receded, swirling away into hidden pipes below. Mechanical arms clicked to life with cold precision. One by one, the tubes disengaged from his flesh, leaving behind faint red marks and the sting of sudden exposure. Metal clamps still held his wrists and ankles in place. His eyes fluttered open—first flickering, confused. Then wide, alert. Panicked.

*“Where…?”*

His gaze dropped to his body, seeing what shouldn't have been possible. The gash that had torn open his side—gone. The shattered leg—whole again. Even the burns across his arms and chest were smooth, like freshly grown skin.

He didn't get to scream.

A voice cut through the room, deep and cool as midnight whiskey, slicing through the static hum like a blade.

“Easy there, kid.”

Ren’s head snapped to the side, heart pounding against his ribs. In the corner of the room, veiled in the flickering gloom, stood a man. Tall. Still. Casually leaning against the wall like he owned the place. The soft flicker of overhead lights danced along the edge of his mirrored sunglasses, reflecting twin sparks in the dark.

“Glad you’re still breathin’,” the man said with a slow, almost lazy cadence. But there was something in his voice—something coiled, ready. “Most folks in your shoes wouldn’t have made it.”

Ren's breath hitched. His limbs trembled as he instinctively tried to push away, but the restraints kept him rooted in place. His hands slid against the slick metal floor, his fingers weak.

“W-who are you?” he rasped. His throat was dry, raw. The words scraped out like sandpaper.

The man didn’t answer immediately. Instead, he tilted his head, the corner of his mouth quirking into a half-smile. “The guy who dragged your sorry ass outta a crater after you went and killed that monster.”

He stepped forward. Each bootfall echoed with heavy finality. The closer he got, the more imposing he became—towering height, corded muscle, an aura like stormclouds before the thunder hits. His sleeveless shirt clung to his body, stained with oil and blood, revealing arms marked with faded scars like old war stories. A belt hung around his hips, trinkets dangling from it—dog tags, rings, a bullet casing that clicked against his thigh with each step.

Ren’s head throbbed. A sharp, electric sting lanced through his skull.

A roar. Claws. Fire. His own scream—

He gasped, clutching at his head. “I... ahhhh… What… what do you want from me? And where am I?” His voice was barely audible, strangled and hoarse.

The man clicked his tongue, then raised a finger to his lips. “Tsst. Wrong order, Ren.” Ren froze.

The man took another step closer. His voice dropped, warm but heavy with weight. “Ain’t how this works. I ask. You answer.”

Ren blinked. The pounding in his skull grew louder. “*He knows my name?”*

The man grinned, full of southern charm and just enough menace to leave a mark. “Ren Kurose. Born in Okutama, Japan. Sub-level seventeen, residential sector. Parents: Kouji and Mariko Kurose. Pops runs freight between sectors, mom used to teach synth music before—well... y’know.”

Ren’s mouth dropped open. “S-stop. Please stop—”

“Funny thing is,” the man continued, circling now, slow like a shark, “you were supposed to be dead*.* Yet here you are.” He leaned in close. “So how’d you do it, Ren? What’d you use to kill the thing?”

“I don’t—!” Ren’s voice cracked. “I don’t know!”

The room felt like it was closing in. His heart slammed in his chest. His skin burned. Flashes came in bursts—flames curling around his hands, a beast shrieking in the dark, a shadowy form cracking open beneath him.

“I don’t know,” he repeated, quieter this time, barely holding himself together. “I swear, I don’t remember anything…”

The man paused, then finally—finally—took a step back, letting the tension unravel just enough for Ren to breathe.

“Well then,” the man said, voice softening into something almost resembling sympathy. “Let’s help you remember*.*”

Ren gulped, his breath still uneven, chest tight like a vice had latched onto his ribs. The pain in his head hadn't left—if anything, it pulsed harder with each beat of his heart. His vision swam. Every nerve screamed flight, but his body remained frozen under the metallic arms.

 

Then the man lifted two fingers to his mouth and let out a sharp whistle—short, deliberate.

“Yo,” he called out, his voice drawing out with a smirk. “Get out here, you dusty-stringed siren.”

From the shadows behind him, something shifted.

A shape stepped into view, heels tapping softly against the metallic floor with the rhythm of rain on chrome. Her silhouette emerged slowly, like smoke slithering out of a bottle—graceful, poised, dangerous. In her hands was an instrument unlike anything Ren had ever seen. A modified ruan—its long neck sleek with chrome plating, its wooden body etched with glowing circuitry veins and wires like a heartbeat frozen in sound.

The woman—tall, sharp-jawed, with long silver-dyed locs pulled into a cascade over one shoulder—cast a lazy glance toward the man.

“‘Dusty-stringed’? How flattering,” she said, her voice low and lilting, like silk draped over broken glass. She stopped a few feet away, propping the armonia against her hip with practiced ease. “For a man who can't even tune a coffee machine, you sure love talkin’ about music.”

The man let out a rough chuckle, arms folding over his chest. “Ain’t about tuning, darlin’. I’m just givin’ him context. You? You give him color.”

She looked at Ren then—her eyes the color of old whiskey, unreadable. She clicked her tongue. “Let’s see what’s echoing in that head of yours.”

Ren recoiled slightly as she crouched near him. He wanted to move, to get away, but his limbs were still too weak. The armonia shifted in her hands. Her fingers, adorned with rings and chipped black nail polish, slid across its strings.

Then she played.

The first note was low—barely more than a hum, but it slithered into Ren’s ears, into his bones. The armonia didn’t just make music. It injected it—each sound a tendril of pressure that weaved through his body like electricity through copper.

His eyes widened. His breath caught.

The second chord hit harder.

Suddenly, images spilled into his mind—no, poured. Fractured, out of order. A beast of shadow lunging from smoke. Screams that weren’t his. A girl’s voice calling his name. His own hands—glowing, shaking, bleeding light. A blade of sound in his hand.

“Agh—!” Ren clutched at his temples, fingers digging into his scalp as the harmonics crashed through him—not cruelly, not maliciously, but like a river carving through stone. Inescapable. Inevitable.

The music didn’t scream. It whispered. It remembered.

And Symphony kept playing, her face as serene and detached as a statue carved from moonlight. Each stroke of her fingers peeled away another veil from his mind, slicing through layers of fear and fog like silk with a blade.

“I don’t want this—!” Ren cried out, his voice cracked and rising, panic curling at the edge of his every word. “Stop—stop it—please—!” But the music didn’t stop.

It deepened.

His breath grew ragged. His vision blurred. And then—tears.

Hot drops slid down his cheeks, vanishing into the collar of his ragged shirt. His eyes squeezed shut as his body shuddered, the flood of memory too much, too fast. And then, everything slowed.

The darkness came—not violent, but soft. Encroaching like twilight on a lonely street.

And in the silence, only his heart remained.

Thump-thump. Thump-thump.

The rhythm grew louder.

Faster.

Thump-thump. THUMP-thump.

His ears rang, and then—light.

Out of the void, she appeared.

A woman, alone, framed against an endless field of white lycoris radiata. The petals danced with the breeze beneath a brilliant blue sky, clouds drifting like dreams too distant to reach. She stood there—her back to him—still, ethereal. Her silhouette wavered as if not fully real.

Then… she turned.

Ren couldn’t see her face clearly—just the curve of her lips, the warmth of her smile. Something achingly familiar, something buried deep in his bones. A part of him knew her. A part of him mourned her.

“Wake up…”

Her voice was a whisper, soft and urgent, woven into the rhythm of his heartbeat. “Wake up…”

The petals stirred. The wind shifted.

“Ren! Wake up already!”

The voice *snapped*. Urgent. Real.

No longer a dream. A scolding reality.

His eyes flew open, breath caught mid-gasp.

The field vanished.

The sky collapsed.

And the world returned with brutal clarity.

Ren sat upright on a plush leather couch, chest heaving. The sprawling living room of his family’s modern villa basked in morning sunlight. It streamed through towering windows, painting golden bars across the glossy marble floor. Art pieces hung like whispers of wealth—polished, curated, cold.

His mother’s voice rang out from the open kitchen, sharp and impatient.

“Ren!”

“I’m up!” he called back, rubbing the sleep and tears from his eyes with the heel of his palm. His voice was thick—frustrated, confused—but his pulse hadn’t settled. Not yet.

He sat up, tossing a crumpled blanket aside, muttering under his breath. ""Her raspy voice is like nails on a chalkboard,"" he sneered, dragging himself to his feet. He shuffled toward the bathroom, grumbling. ""Can’t stand her. Always nagging about something.""

After a lazy, half-hearted routine in the bathroom, Ren trudged back into the living room. He passed the kitchen, ignoring the aroma of fresh toast and eggs wafting through the air. His mother, standing by the counter, caught his eye.

She shot him a glare. ""Hurry up and eat. You're going to be late.""

Ren rolled his eyes but dropped into the chair at the dining table. The plate of eggs and toast sat there, untouched. His stomach growled, but he wasn’t in the mood for small talk. He grabbed the toast, biting into it without a second thought, shoveling eggs into his mouth between chews.

A heavy sigh came from the other end of the table. His father, seated with his usual stoic expression, lowered his newspaper. ""Slow down. Eat properly,"" he ordered, his deep voice cutting through the tense silence.

Ren barely spared him a glance. ""I don’t have time for this,"" he mumbled, mouth halffull. He took another hurried bite, stuffing the rest of the toast into his mouth like he was in some kind of race.

His father narrowed his eyes. ""Don’t talk with your mouth full. Show some manners. You eat like a wild animal.""

Ren scoffed, gulping down his food. ""Maybe I’d eat slower if you weren’t breathing down my neck about every little thing.""

His father’s jaw tightened, but he didn’t respond. Instead, he folded his newspaper and set it aside. ""Discipline starts with the small things. If you can’t even eat properly, how do you expect to handle real responsibilities?""

Ren pushed back his chair with a screech, grabbing his bag off the floor. ""Yeah, yeah. Thanks, Dad."" He slung the bag over his shoulder and turned toward the door.

His mother frowned. ""What about your lun—""

""I’m going!"" he snapped, pulling the door open. A cold breeze rushed in as he stepped outside. He didn’t wait for another word, slamming the door behind him.

As he stalked down the street, hands stuffed in his pockets, his mind churned. Same old routine. Same nagging. Same pointless rules. One day, he’d be out of here for good.

He kicked a loose pebble, watching it skid across the pavement. For now, he just had to get through another useless day of school.

 

 

Ren arrived at school, his bag slung over one shoulder and a permanent scowl etched on his face. After swapping his shoes at the entrance, he stepped into the bustling corridors, the noise hitting him like a wave. Groups of students loitered around, chatting animatedly or rushing to their classrooms.

As he walked, snippets of conversations floated toward him.

“Did you see the new trailer for Soul Reaper Chronicles? It looks insane!” Sota exclaimed, showing his phone to his friend, Riku.

“Yeah, but the new arc seems like a filler,” Riku replied, shaking his head. “I hope they don’t ruin the pacing like last season.”

Nearby, two girls, Ayumi and Hana, leaned against their lockers, whispering conspiratorially.

“Did you hear about Kaede and Haruto? I saw them walking home together yesterday,” Ayumi said, smirking.

“No way,” Hana replied, her eyes wide. “Haruto’s been rejecting girls left and right. Kaede must be something special.”

At the same time, a trio of boys stood near the vending machines, arguing over weekend plans.

“I’m telling you, karaoke is the way to go,” Ryota insisted, crossing his arms.

“Not when you sing like a dying cat,” Takumi teased, earning a laugh from their friend Daiki.

“What about the arcade? They’ve got that new fighting game,” Daiki suggested. “I’ll destroy both of you.”

Ren walked past them all, his irritation growing with every step. He caught sight of a group of girls nearby, giggling over their phones.

“Have you seen his latest video? He’s so amazing,” Aiko gushed, holding up her phone to show Miki and Yuna.

“I know, right? He’s not like those cheesy street magicians,” Miki added, leaning in to get a better look. “And that mask he wears? It’s so mysterious.”

“I hard he’s performing at Shibuya this weekend,” Yuna chimed in, her cheeks slightly pink. “Imagine seeing him up close! That accent, that jawline—he’s like something out of a movie.”

Ren rolled his eyes as he passed them. “*Why do people always have to group up and chat about nonsense?*” he muttered under his breath. “*And why do they have to be so loud?*” Every day, it’s the same mindless gossip.

He clicked his tongue, shoving his hands in his pockets. But the irritation in his chest didn’t settle.

*“I’m just jealous, aren’t I?*

*That’s what this really is.*

*I hate that they have someone to talk to, and I don’t.”*



**Author's Note:** Hey HFY!

Anonymous One here. This is my first time posting on the subreddit, and *Verses: Origins* is the first story I'm ready to share publicly. I'm incredibly excited (and a little nervous!) to bring this Urban Fantasy/Sci-Fi serial to you all. I was heavily inspired by Japanese light novels and tons of shonen and seinen anime/manga, so if you enjoy those, I think you'll feel right at home here.

This story is a short story, running for about 50 chapters. I'll be posting one new chapter daily until it's fully uploaded.

Feedback and comments are always welcome and appreciated—I'd love to hear what you think!

If you prefer reading on Royal Road, the story is also available [there](https://www.royalroad.com/fiction/133008/verses-origins).",1,1758221572.0,HFY,2,1.0,False

And then there are the unused ammos where I should be breaking them down instead of selling them like in FO3 and FO4.  I am not sure if I should be buying certain ammo or just breakdown the ones I find for resources.

1nkgtp7,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/1nkgtp7/is_my_work_colleague_f25_flirting_with_me_m28/,Is my work colleague (F25) flirting with me (M28),"[Advertise on Reddit](https://ads.reddit.com/register?utm_source=web3x_consumer&utm_name=nav_cta)

We were both in relationships since we joined the company, so while I immedietaly found her attractive when she joined the company, I never thought to entertain those thoughts any further.

From what she had told met she was in a long, stable relationship, and I had been too so I never read into any of her behaviour around me much before.

But a few weeks ago, we were chatting together and she was tallking about a holiday which was cancelled, and without me pressing on why, as she became a bit awkard when she said this, she then told me it was because her and her boyfriend broke up. The conversation carried on a lot after that on many other things.

A couple of days after this in conversation between us it came up that I'm going on holiday. I wasn't saying who with, just gave details about where and how long. But she kept pressing who I was going with though and eventually I said my girlfriend and then the conversation carried on about other things.

For the couple of years we've worked together, we hadn't spoken much at all, apart from when she first joined and introduced herself to me. I've always wanted to talk with her more at work, but have felt it best not to, given my attraction to her and how it might come across.

There was one time when I bumped into her on the weekend, and she waved at me and I sort of smiled back. The next day she joked she was offended that I didn't wave back.

But the last few weeks, we seem to talk more and more, and she'll make an effort to use the same coffee machine as me, or come to me to ask questions about work now, whereas in the past she never did.

She commented a few times recently how I smell nice, which I had no idea how to respond too and also complimented my new haircut.

I recently came out of a relationship aften my girlfriend broke things off, so have gone back on dating apps. I stumbled across her profile and skipped past it, to avoid any weirdness at work. But as we live nearby, there's a high chance she's seen my on dating apps now too.

And since seing her on the dating app, everything went completely quiet in person. she's not spoken to me at all for over a couple of weeks, until today. I was told by another colleague to get in touch with her about something work related , but her responses to my quesitosn for a while were just short blunt messages like ""oh well"" or ""too bad"". I couldn't tell if she was annoyed or not, so I just didn''t play along or make a joke of it, until eventually she starting using lots of emojis and making jokes and she eventually come over to talk.

 I could be  overthinking this because I find her attractive and she's just being friendly.

If it does appead she's flirting with me  how can I go about it?

I don't want to make things awkard, but also it would feel like a missed opportunity if I didn't act on it",1,1758221419.0,relationship_advice,1,1.0,False
1nkgtmc,https://youtu.be/1p48aT7l7p8?si=ehOS0TAUzw3cSgh0,Ground Zero 0.0.1: Countdown to Alpha,"Hello future Autonomics. 

**I have a few important updates to share with you today.**

First of all, we’re incredibly super duper excited to finally let you experience our **very first Alpha** soon! The team is doing great, hard at work and pushing towards that initial release. There are a ton of systems behind the curtain that all need to be stitched together so everything feels smooth and coherent.

Unfortunately, we had a few bumps in the road after the Kickstarter, not serious, just the usual challenges that come up. Because of that, unfortunately, we have to shift the release of the Alpha slightly to **November 19th.**

This is an incredibly important update for us, and we want to make sure we do it right. Since we said that we’re ok for streamers to stream (even though the game still will not be ready for it, probably?!), we chose to go with full transparency as we always do.

The initial release - **Ground Zero: 0.0.1** is going to be challenging for us. Since it’s the first time ever that many of our systems need to activate and collaborate effectively. It feels like the anticipation before a spaceship launch, we’re super nervous and excited, hoping that your first experience is going to be as smooth as possible (but don’t expect it to be super polished).

**Check Out Alpha Island Fly Through Video**

[**https://youtu.be/1p48aT7l7p8?si=lgV-Jv\_p7YwsPAOW**](https://youtu.be/1p48aT7l7p8?si=lgV-Jv_p7YwsPAOW)

In general, I'm very against overworking my team, and I care a lot for their physical and mental health. I want to make sure we’re not pushing them past their limits. At the same time, I promise you guys we’re working really, really hard, putting in a ton of effort, bringing everything together in the game.

To help manage expectations, we put together a basic **Ground Zero 0.0.1 planned feature list**. Big emphasis on *planned*. I can’t stress enough how complicated what we’re building is, but your support is incredibly motivating and fuels our passion.

**Planned Core Features at Launch**

* Isolated open-world island
* Tutorial Que
* st System to help guide you through the game
* Character Vitals and Stats, including a few Buffs and Debuffs
* Farming with selected Crops (probably around 5–7)
   * Creation of plots
   * Plant Stages
   * Plant Health
   * Probably a few Fertilizers
   * Plants can see the sun
   * Plants hydration level
   * Potentially Plant Biome Boosts and Debuffs
* Automation (early stages) with selected machines and very complex conveyor line tools
* Electricity: Windmills, Solar panels
* Basic Weather Patterns: rain, snow, wind changes etc
* A few vehicles to try out: hoverboard, bicycle etc
* Blackbox integration
* Crafting tools and resources
* Tool Repair Station (craft repair kits for tools)
* Inventory and storage system
* Interactable Systems, including interaction indicators
* Looting system
* Advanced world environment lighting linked to weather controllers, potentially with moon phases
* Ability to cut trees (duh)
* Ability to mine ground resources: stone, iron, copper ore, quartz
* Super complex and detailed construction system (we are already proud of what we have). You’ll be able to build with selected materials: wood, stone, and glass. More advanced materials like steel, iron, and more will be introduced later. It probably will not have strong meta yet - later house and decoration will count towards your character stats (Home Pod)
* Progression system:
   * Manufacturing Station (unlock new technologies, \~3–5 tiers of unlocks)
   * Maybe Botanical Station (advances in farming)
   * Some basic character Masteries (levels)
   * Character leveling up system - Players skill levels grow based on actions they perform in the game. (highly wip)
* 6 preset characters to choose from to play as. (You’ll be able to customize and create your character fully a bit later in the development process)
* Manual Watering Mechanic (via water gun)
* A store with furniture and accessories where you can purchase props and furniture for your new homes.
* Basic Economy
* Dynamic Points of Interest - places that you can recover and restore.
* Delivery system (we might not have this one for the Ground Zero though, but we’re trying guys)
* Basic Cooking - meals from plants you have grown yourself.
* Basic construction customization - presets for now.

**What we will not have:**

* Fully integrated animals (probably disabled for the first Alpha)
* No Co-op or Multiplayer. Foundationally we have this working, but some systems don’t support it properly yet. Rather than just seeing your friend in the game without much else, we’d rather roll it out soon after release when it actually offers something meaningful.
* No NPCs yet. It’s a massive and very complex system, and we want NPCs to feel dimensional. This will take more work.
* More dynamic and complex weather patterns (like tornadoes, hail storms, infestations) will come later.
* No Phantoms yet. They’re super complex, similar to NPCs, and will probably roll out with co-op modes shortly after the first release.
* No character customization. The system is still in heavy development; the goal is to let you morph facial and body shapes.
* Additional Buffs and Debuffs (including some fun immersive ones) will be introduced later.
* Automatic Irrigation - Pipes, pumps, sprinklers, etc.
* No full gamepad support yet (we’re working on it, you’ll have it soon)
* More complex customization, where you can choose colors, patterns,s and materials for your construction elements coming soon.

# Audio

As we launch the alpha, some audio effects will be missing. We started working on audio kinda late (programmers usually don’t listen to their own games and get way too comfortable playing them silently, …silly fools that we are.). But we’re committed to adding audio to all the key elements so the world never feels muted. This is just the beginning of making the game feel truly alive.

Now for some exciting news: we’ve purchased a license for **Wwise**, The industry leading audio middleware that brings interactive sound within games to a whole new level. This will add a whole new dimension to our already rich world. Our new audio engineer is hard at work implementing systems that will make your experience truly feel immersive and alive.

We’re building dynamic soundtracks that are designed to change with the world around you. The weather will affect sound differently. In fog, sounds become softer; rain will add richer reverb to every step and action, and trees will rustle or roar depending on the wind and the movement of their leaves. Every sound will respond to the world… and to the actions you take.

It’s pretty, pretty cool.

⚠️ **Note on the lists** We’re 100% missing some things from these lists. They aren’t meant to give you a super accurate breakdown; the goal is just to give you an idea of what to expect. We’re also building a stronger roadmap to give you an even better glimpse on the journey ahead. It will outline upcoming features in more detail.**Important Note:** What we are doing with this release is unprecedented. I don’t know any team working on a game of the scale of Autonomica that has allowed their fans and backers to start playing the game this soon. Usually, it takes years of testing and planning before players get to experience anything playable after a Kickstarter. We, however, felt it was important to be open and transparent and let you into the experience as soon as we possibly could. 

With this in mind, it’s important to manage expectations and understand that the game is going to evolve over time and you’ll experience it from the first row seats. Our goal is to update, patch, fix bugs and introduce new features on a monthly basis. It’s going to be a lot of fun and every month or other month you’ll see new features rolling into the game. The game will offer you a new experience even after you’ve already sunk many, many hours into it.

Please, please, please — we’re asking for patience and support. The scale of this project for our team is massive, but I promise, we’re charging through it! I absolutely love how things are shaping up. It just needs a little more time to shine.

**Want to get into Alpha?** We’ve been getting new requests from people who missed our Kickstarter campaign and still want to join Alpha, Beta, and so on. We do plan to introduce some tiers on our website a bit later, but you’ll need to wait a little.

Right now we want to work closely with our community — the initial Alpha participants — to get feedback and make sure the game is ready for more people. My guess is it will take at least a few months before we offer a limited number of new Alpha seats.Sign-up to get notified: [https://mailchi.mp/crytivo/autonomica](https://mailchi.mp/crytivo/autonomica)

And before I go, how about we do another Q&A with me and some of our dev stars? We’re thinking about doing it on 24th (next week) on our Twitch Channel at [https://www.twitch.tv/crytivo](https://www.twitch.tv/crytivo), we will take questions from our Discord and Twitch Chat.

Don’t worry, we won't spoil too much of the game, but we can have a good, healthy chat. Let’s call it **Breakfast with Crytivo**. Grab your donut, cookie, and coffee (or milk!) and join us for some quality time together this Friday. I’ll be happy to answer your questions and hang out with you all.

I am great with socializing online, but not so much in person due to being sheltered as a child, sadly. I get awkward and anxious, and usually stay quiet to prevent saying something weird in front of other people.

This guy from my town followed me on Instagram, said I was in his recommended, said I was pretty, and asked me to go on a walk and get coffee sometime next week. I agreed to go but I’ve been stressing over the last few days about it. I have absolutely zero relationship experience, I’ve never even held hands with someone. I’m afraid he may judge me for my awkwardness or find me too inexperienced.

Should I tell him I’ve never really been in a relationship before when I meet up with him? I like him quite a bit from just talking to him online, but I worry he’ll find me too different in person since im not as talkative or confident as I am online.

1nkgrkr,https://www.reddit.com/r/ForceTech/comments/1nkgrkr/should_you_buy_the_best_mini_pc_beelink_eqr5_for/,Should You Buy the Best Mini PC Beelink EQR5 for Gaming and Work,"The Beelink EQR5 Mini PC landed on my desk with a promise of powerful performance and a compact design that seemed too good to be true. As someone who regularly test-drives tech gadgets, I dove into this mini computer, curious about its potential to replace bulkier desktops without skimping on performance. Needless to say, it intrigued me from the moment I unboxed it.

**Compact Yet Sturdy Build**  
This mini computer is surprisingly light, weighing just around two pounds, but don’t mistake its lightweight design for fragility. Built with a sleek, robust frame, it feels solid and well-constructed. Measuring a little over 6 inches on its longest side, it fits easily on any desk without hogging space. Its dual HDMI ports are strategically placed, making setup with multiple monitors more convenient than some of the other mini PCs I’ve used. What stood out is the built-in power supply. Say goodbye to messy, extra power adapters cluttering your space—it’s genius, really.  

[Check Beelink EQR5 price on Amazon.](https://headphonegeek.com/p/b0dlp5p62s/)  

**Performance That Packs a Punch**  
Armed with the AMD Ryzen 7 5825U processor, this gadget doesn’t hold back. To test its muscle, I threw some hefty tasks its way—video editing, streaming ultra-clear 4K, casual gaming, and even running multiple applications simultaneously. The 8-core, 16-thread processor with a max speed of 4.5 GHz handled it all like a champ. In terms of performance, the leap to 7nm technology really shows. Tasks were accomplished faster compared to my older Ryzen-powered machines, and I noticed barely any stuttering or lag. Its internal AMD Radeon Graphics also provided terrific rendering for tasks like graphic design and gaming, though it’s not suitable for hardcore gamers expecting RTX-level realism.

**Storage and Memory Flexibility**  
Its 32GB DDR4 RAM was a real head-turner for me. Few mini PCs offer RAM at this scale, and the system runs smoother than I expected even while multitasking. The 500GB NVMe PCIe SSD wasn’t just fast—it was lightning quick. Boot times were practically instantaneous, and applications launched faster than I could even consider grabbing my coffee mug. Plus, with upgrade slots available, you can crank the RAM up to 64GB if needed or expand the storage to a massive 8TB. That’s flexibility right there.

**Cooling and Noise**  
Overheating mini PCs are my pet peeve, but this little machine’s MSC2.0 cooling system was a deal changer. Using Vapor Chamber Technology, coupled with a silent fan, I could barely hear it working, even when pushing the system hard. I’m someone who’s picky about operational noise, especially during long work sessions, and the Beelink EQR5 was nearly inaudible. Also, the dustproof design was a pleasant surprise—no more periodic cleaning marathons to keep things running smoothly.

**Positives**  
- Compact design with a built-in power supply to keep workspace uncluttered  
- Exceptional processing power thanks to the AMD Ryzen 7 5825U  
- Generous 32GB RAM for seamless multitasking  
- 4K support with dual-screen capability for enhanced productivity  
- Efficient cooling system and whisper-quiet operation  

**Hurdles**  
- While the AMD Radeon Graphics performed well, it’s not meant for high-end gaming enthusiasts relying on cutting-edge GPUs  
- Limited USB 2.0 and USB 3.0 ports might restrict connectivity options for users needing extensive peripherals  
- Lacks a dedicated SD card slot, which could be useful for photographers or video editors  

**Broad Market Comparisons**  
Comparing this powerhouse machine with other mini PCs in its range, its most compelling rival is perhaps the Intel NUC series. The Intel NUC does offer phenomenal options for gamers and tech enthusiasts, with some models coming with dedicated GPUs. However, in terms of value and multitasking reliability, the Beelink EQR5 has a definite edge. Machines like the Apple Mac Mini are sleek and work seamlessly within the Apple ecosystem, but their prices typically skyrocket. For someone looking at all-around work productivity and casual gaming, the Beelink Mini PC holds steady ground.

**Bang for the Buck**  
Given everything from the processor speed down to its innovative cooling system, this computer delivers an experience that’s tough to rival in its price point. It manages to combine affordability with power in a way that feels almost unfair to larger desktop builds. While there are a few connectivity limitations, the powerhouse performance and premium RAM size make it well worth the investment for users who prioritize efficiency and space-saving.

* **Capital One Platinum Secured** – No credit check, low/flexible deposit, reports to all 3 bureaus, upgrade path. Best starter if you’re building from scratch.

>**💡** ***AI-generated breakdown, reviewed for accuracy.***

# Hey! 

Let's talk about credit cards for international students who don't have a U.S. Social Security Number (SSN) — this is such an important step in building financial stability and a credit history in the U.S. I know it can feel a bit overwhelming, but I’ll break it down for you and give you a few solid options to consider.

# Discover it® Student Cash Back

If you’re a full-time student at a U.S. college or university, the Discover it® Student Cash Back is a fantastic starting point. It’s designed specifically for students with no credit history or fair credit, and it doesn’t require a credit check — so that’s a big plus if you’re just beginning your journey.

Here’s what makes it stand out:

* **No annual fee**: That’s a win for any student trying to keep costs low.
* **Rotating 5% cash back categories**: You get to choose which categories you earn 5% in each quarter (like restaurants, gas, groceries, and Amazon), and you can earn up to $1,500 in those categories each quarter.
* **1% cash back on everything else**: Even if you don’t hit the bonus categories, you’re still earning something, which is better than many other student cards.
* **Unlimited Cashback Match**: At the end of your first year, Discover will double all the cash back you’ve earned — no minimums, no caps. If you earned $100, you get $200 back. That’s a powerful incentive.
* **0% intro APR for 6 months**: On both purchases and balance transfers, this helps you avoid interest if you’re just starting to manage credit or need to transfer a small debt.

This card is great for students who want to build credit while earning rewards on everyday purchases. The rotating categories mean you can tailor your spending to maximize cash back each quarter. Just remember to activate the bonus categories when they change — it’s easy to forget, but it’s worth the extra step.

# Capital One Quicksilver Student Cash Rewards

If you’re someone who travels for school trips, internships, or just for fun during breaks, the Capital One Quicksilver Student Cash Rewards card is a strong contender.

Why it’s good for you:

* **No annual fee**: Like the Discover, this keeps the cost low.
* **1.5% cash back on all purchases**: No need to track categories — just spend and earn. That’s a solid return for all your expenses.
* **0% intro APR for 6 months**: Same as the Discover, this gives you a buffer to build good habits.
* **No foreign transaction fees**: This is a big deal if you’re studying abroad or traveling internationally for school or personal trips. You won’t get hit with extra charges when you use it overseas.
* **$50 bonus after spending $100 in the first 3 months**: Quick and easy to hit if you’re already spending on school-related things.

This card is less complicated than the Discover if you don’t want to track rotating categories. It’s also a good long-term option because of its travel-friendly features and the fact that it’s a Mastercard — which is widely accepted around the world.

# Capital One Savor Student Cash Rewards

If dining out is a big part of your student life or if you enjoy streaming services and live events, the Capital One Savor Student Cash Rewards card is the one to get.

Here’s what it offers:

* **No annual fee**: Again, this is huge for students.
* **3% cash back on dining and entertainment**: Whether you’re grabbing coffee, eating out with friends, or catching a concert, you’ll earn more on what you already spend.
* **3% cash back on groceries (excluding superstores like Target or Walmart)**: This is great if you use regular grocery stores or buy your food in smaller, local shops.
* **5% cash back on travel bookings through Capital One Travel**: If you book flights, hotels, or rentals through their portal, you’ll get a nice bump in rewards.
* **8% cash back on Capital One Entertainment purchases**: This is perfect if you buy event tickets, like for sports games or theater, through their platform.
* **$50 bonus after $100 in first 3 months**: Same as the Quicksilver, but with a more targeted rewards structure.

This card is ideal if you spend a lot in the categories it rewards — dining, entertainment, and travel. It gives you a way to earn more on the things you already enjoy, and it’s a great tool to start building your credit with a secured or unsecured option.

# Capital One Platinum Secured Credit Card

If you’re struggling to get approved without an SSN or with no credit history, the Capital One Platinum Secured Credit Card is your best bet for building credit from the ground up.

Key features:

* **No credit check required**: You can qualify even with no credit history.
* **No bank account needed**: You can pay the deposit with a money order or through Western Union.
* **Flexible deposit options**: You can choose a $49, $99, or $200 deposit. You can even pay it in installments (minimum $20) if that’s easier for you.
* **Credit limit may exceed deposit**: Some applicants may be approved for a $200 limit with a $49 deposit, which is a great way to boost your available credit.
* **Reports to all three credit bureaus**: This is the most important part — it helps you build a U.S. credit profile.
* **Upgrade potential**: If you make on-time payments for 6 months or more, you may be eligible for an unsecured credit card with no deposit.

This card is more of a “starter” card than a rewards card, but it’s essential if you want to establish credit. Once you’ve built up some history, you can graduate to one of the other student cards or even apply for a regular credit card.

# Strategic Approval Tips

Since you don’t have an SSN, here’s what you should focus on to improve your chances of approval:

* **Apply with a U.S. co-signer**: This can help you qualify for unsecured cards like the Discover or Capital One Quicksilver/Savor. Make sure the co-signer has a good credit history and income.
* **Show proof of income**: Even if it’s part-time work or a scholarship, having a stable income source improves your eligibility.
* **Consider starting with the secured card**: The Capital One Platinum Secured is the most accessible and gives you a clear path to build credit. Once you see your score improve, you can apply for the other student cards.

# Which One Should You Get?

Here’s how to choose based on your spending habits and goals:

|If you…|Then get…|
|:-|:-|
|Want the combo **best cash back and credit-building** |**Discover it® Student Cash Back** — especially if you’re okay with tracking rotating categories. The Cashback Match is a game-changer.|
|Travel often or study abroad|**Capital One Quicksilver Student Cash Rewards** — the no foreign transaction fee and 1.5% on everything is a win for international spending.|
|Spend a lot on **dining, groceries, and entertainment**|**Capital One Savor Student Cash Rewards** — the 3-5-8% tiers in key student categories make this card very valuable for daily use.|

Fairly new in this sub, but am a long time coffee enthusiast.
I drink solely pour-over at home, and can't seem to find any roastery or subscription service which were able to keep their shipping prices decent.

I live in the middle-east, so US/Canadian roasters' shipping are usually expensive.
And very few european left which their shipping doesnt cost more than the coffees themselves.
Now, bear in mind - I don't mind paying premium for great coffee, assuming I can afford the retail shipping of several coffee bags.

I would like to ask whether you guys are familiar with roasteries or subscription services that you'd recommend with bearable international shipping price.

Some of my favorite roasteries are (for example):
La Cabra,

Three weeks ago, I left for a work trip. My husband didn’t want to come. “I’ll hang back, game a little, order pizza,” he said. He’s 41. I thought, “Fine, he’s an adult, he’ll be fine.”

He was not fine.

Day 2, he decided he was going to become a “grill master” even though we don’t own a grill. He stacked three baking sheets on top of each other, poured lighter fluid over them, and set off the smoke alarm for 40 minutes. The oven still smells like gasoline.

Then, he got really into “minimalist living” after a TikTok binge and threw away half our dishes, claiming “we only need one bowl each.” Unfortunately, he chose the salad bowl and the dog’s water dish. Everything else? Gone.

To feed himself, he bulk-ordered 20 frozen burritos and survived on those exclusively. By week two, he was eating them still partially frozen because “it’s basically a cold wrap.” His justification: “saves electricity.”

He stopped doing laundry entirely. Just rotated between two pairs of basketball shorts. By the time I got back, they had fused into what I can only describe as “denim-adjacent cardboard.” The dog started growling every time he sat down.

Last night, I walked in to find him shirtless, playing the recorder he ordered off Amazon because “Mozart slapped.” The living room smelled like burnt plastic and ranch dressing.

This morning, I woke up to him mumbling in his sleep: “I am the burrito.” The dog has relocated to the bathtub and won’t come out.

So now I’m sitting in a café, sipping coffee like it’s communion wine, with a dog who looks like he’s seen combat. The barista asked if I wanted almond milk. I just said no. My house is already nut-based chaos.

1nkgi4l,https://www.reddit.com/r/ReviewedAppliances/comments/1nkgi4l/find_out_if_the_best_single_serve_coffee_maker/,Find Out if the Best Single Serve Coffee Maker from Keurig Delivers,"The Keurig K-Compact 5000376527 entered my life as a game-changer for my mornings. I live for coffee—sometimes it’s the only thing keeping me functional before 9 a.m. Testing out this single-serve pod coffee maker was both fun and enlightening because I never knew how much I craved convenience and efficiency until I had it right in front of me. 

**Compact and Space-Saving Design**  
The first thing that caught my attention was just how slim it was. This coffee maker stands out not for bulkiness but for efficiency in design. My kitchen isn’t tiny, but countertop space vanishes quickly between my air fryer, blender, and toaster. At a mere 8.2 inches wide, it slid easily into an empty corner near my backsplash, leaving plenty of room for other essentials. Its minimalist matte-black exterior looks sleek and unfussy. It blends with modern kitchens and doesn’t scream for attention—an understated vibe I appreciate.  

**Brews in a Flash**  
It takes less than a minute to brew coffee with this little powerhouse, which felt unusually fast in my experience. As somebody who rushes every morning, there were no complaints on this front. Select 6, 8, or 10 ounces with button controls that are—you guessed it—the epitome of simplicity. There’s no science degree required here, and that’s what makes it approachable for less tech-savvy people like my parents.  

[Check Keurig 5000376527 price on Amazon.](https://cncgn.com/p/b0bv9hkmnt/)  

**Smart Start: A Handy Feature**  
The Smart Start functionality wowed me in ways I didn’t expect. Instead of waiting for a separate preheat cycle before brewing (so many other coffee makers have this hurdle), it heats up and brews seamlessly in a single step. It removed a layer of impatience from my daily routine. I didn’t realize how much I disliked waiting around until that wait was gone.  

**Boons**  
Here’s what I appreciated most while using it:  
- Brewing multiple sizes (6, 8, 10 ounces) gives flexibility for different mug needs.  
- Auto-off after two hours saves energy, and frankly, I have a history of forgetting to turn appliances off, so this feature feels tailor-made for me.  
- The removable 36-ounce reservoir made refilling less annoying because I could prepare multiple cups without constantly adding water.  
- Let’s not overlook the removable drip tray. It takes travel mugs (up to 7 inches tall!), which opened up possibilities for brewing coffee on-the-go.   

**Pitfalls**  
No machine is perfect, and this coffee maker has some drawbacks worth mentioning.   
- The 36-ounce reservoir, while convenient, isn’t massive. If you plan to brew several cups frequently, count on quick refills—a minor inconvenience if you live for caffeine like me.  
- It’s not the quietest coffee maker I’ve used. Every brew process comes with a bit of noise. This isn’t a dealbreaker unless you’re brewing in hushed environments.  
- K-Cups are necessary, but not all are environmentally friendly. Sure, you can use the Keurig Universal My K-Cup Reusable Coffee Filter (purchased separately), but it does add a step for eco-conscious users.  

**Competing Products**  
Comparing this machine to others in its category, a couple of worthy rivals stood out. Take the Nespresso Essenza Mini, for instance. It’s equally slim and brews high-quality espresso, but the pod offerings are pricier, and the machine doesn’t support regular coffee. The Ninja DualBrew Pro also pops up in conversations, providing crazy versatility with both K-Cups and ground coffee. However, its larger size makes it unsuitable for small kitchens. The Keurig K-Compact strikes a balance—small, quick, and beginner-friendly without too many bells and whistles that complicate its purpose.  

**Cost Efficiency**  
On the cost front, this coffee maker leans toward affordable for what it offers. If you’re shopping for a single-serve machine, the combination of energy efficiency, space-saving design, and hassle-free coffee brewing justifies taking the plunge. I’d consider it a middle-ground investment, especially suited for students, young professionals, or even as an auxiliary machine for a home office.

So it was our mum’s birthday yesterday and my brother (24) didn’t get her anything minus a card which he didn’t even pay for himself, it was his boyfriend who bought and designed it. 

We just come back from a family holiday to Tenerife which was me, my mum, my brother, his boyfriend and his bfs mum and sister. We landed yesterday at 3am which also happened to be our mums birthday. On this whole holiday my brother never bought her one thing. I bought her perfume she wanted (it was much cheaper abroad), crocs before we came, paid for her dinner when we went out and more, she had her own money but as we didn’t have the opportunity to do much for her bday as it was a travel day I spot her via holiday gifts. 

For context, im an 18 year old girl who works in McDonald’s and has only just upped my hours meaning I only bring in about £230 a fortnight so im not the richest of the bunch. My brother was a manager at a coffee shop and was on about £26k a year, decided to chase his dreams of being a coach driver, failed his test and is now living off of universal credit because apparently he’s unable to work due to his severe adhd (he got diagnosed out of nowhere last week and they said he only just fit the criteria for a diagnosis and it’s only moderate). He was on about claiming PIP (a government benefit for those unable to work at all) and staying unemployed. He gets about £300 a month from universal credit. 

His boyfriend has also been paying for everything. Their car insurance, phone contracts, even one of the meals we went out for on holiday. My brother didn’t contribute once out of his gov benefits, didn’t even wanna pay for a McDonald’s milkshake my mum wanted when we landed back in the uk. 

I told him he needs to sort it out before Christmas as we have plans organised for my birthday and I’m annoyed that he didn’t seem to care about our mum’s birthday, he didn’t even say happy birthday in person or on socials. He said im being insensitive and don’t understand and need to stop bullying him. 

Edit to add: he used chat GPT for the answers during his adhd diagnosis meaning if he didn’t use ai he wouldn’t be eligible for any of the state benefits he’s claiming and would have to get a job anyways.

Most people don't struggle because they lack skills.

They struggle because LinkedIn seems to be a platform where everyone is shouting the same advice: ""Post daily, use the right keywords, follow the algorithm.""

What's the problem? This kind of approach often makes your profile more generic, not more authentic.

From what I've seen, these are the 5 biggest mistakes people make when it comes to personal branding on LinkedIn:

1. Posting because they feel they ""have to,"" not because they have something to say.
2. Writing headlines that sound like job titles, instead of telling people what they actually do.
3. Prioritising likes over conversations.
4. Copying others' posts instead of finding your own rhythm.
5. Hiding your story, opinions, or personality for fear of being ""too different.""

When you avoid these traps, LinkedIn feels less like a forum and more like a cafe table where honest conversations happen.

What small change have you made on LinkedIn that makes you feel more authentic? I'd love to know.",1,1758220491.0,personalbranding,0,1.0,False

I've agreed with my prescriber that I'll go back down to 36mg tomorrow but I'm having trouble distinguishing between a side effect that I should be worried about and something that is part of adjusting. Full disclosure I didnt stop caffeine until on 36mg as realised it was contributing to negative side effects so I need longer at 36mg to see how I feel.

How long did it take for people to adjust and decide if a medication was working or they needed to change?

# AITAH for how I reacted when my niece announced she was engaged?

I (33m) have a pretty big age difference with my brother (44m). He had a child at 25, which means that I became an uncle at 14. Because we were pretty close in age, I formed a special bond with my niece, Ella (now 18f).

When she was 16, my brother and his family moved away so I've been seeing them less recently, but we keep in touch and catch up at family events.

Last year, at Christmas, my niece told me that she had a boyfriend and told me a bit about him, but I didn't know the guy. He was invited for Easter and a couple of other events, but was never able to make it. When we were planning our mother's birthday, my brother decided to invite Ella's boyfriend so that we could all meet him.

Yesterday was the birthday. I was looking forward to meeting Mark (Ella's boyfriend), but was very confused when I saw her walk in with a man that looked double her age (spoiler alert: he is). She introduced him to me, and I politely smiled but was deep down very concerned. I went to my brother to ask how old Mark was and he told me that Mark is 36, so literally double Ella's age. She had told me that he was ""a bit older"" but I assumed like early to mid twenties, not almost 40. That's when they called us in the living room to share ""exciting news"". Ella showed us a ring and revealed that they were engaged.

I just said ""what the fuck"" and everyone turned around and looked at me like I was crazy. I told them that they were out of their minds if they thought this was normal, that there was no world in which a 30 something should date an 18yo, and that she shouldn't be getting married. All of them accused me of ruining Ella's happiness. Some even said that I was jealous of Mark, which is so fucking disgusting I can't even explain it. I mean, I'm younger than Mark, but never in a million years would I ever consider dating someone younger than 25. They told me that it was perfectly legal as they were both adults, which isn't true because they've been dating for a year and Ella turned 18 7 months ago, and that if they were happy that's all that matters.

I told them that they were sick for allowing this and that he was a predator but they wouldn't listen. I know this isn't my business, but I can't help but fear for Ella. She is young and doesn't really know what she's getting into. I'm really scared of her getting married and being unable to leave him when she realizes how sick it was. I then left and slammed the door, and have been receiving pretty wild messages and calls since then. I don't know if I was wrong for this and am just overreacting, and if I wasn't wrong I don't know what I can do to make them realize how wrong it is. AITAH?

>**RepresentativeGur250**

>NTA but teens will double down about the whole thing if you react negatively, generally speaking.

>Can you do some digging into this guy’s background? Has he ever been married, who are his friends, what does he do for a living, find out stuff about his ex’s. Check if any info comes up about him for any of the laws named for victims of domestic violence, abuse, etc. I think it’s likely you’d find something dodgy there. No decent man of that age would date an 18 year old. I’m a bit older than him and if any of my guy friends brought an 18 year old to something as his date, I’d be telling them exactly how creepy it is.

>Did your family say all of that in front of your niece? If it was, they could well be playing a long game, giving their ‘approval’ and hoping your niece will get over the initial thrill of dating a much older guy and that it will fizzle out. Or pretending so that she doesn’t push them away and cut them off, so they can keep an eye on the situation and help her if it goes south. Talk to a few in private, especially your brother. Maybe they do feel exactly the same way as you do but they have a plan. And if you do find sketchy things if you look into him, tactfully share them with her parents. Don’t go in guns blazing.

**OOP**: I quickly went over his facebook account so it’s not really verified info, but I saw pictures of him with his ex (I think?) and she looked 20-24 maybe? It’s still better but if the guy has a thing for younger girls that’s even more wrong. And it seems like he was still with his ex when he started dating my niece, so even weirder… 

>**No\_Addition\_5543**

>Is he rich?

**OOP**: Not that I know of. I know it doesn’t mean anything but he doesn’t look rich. And I’ve seen pictures of his house, it’s pretty normal. I’d say middle class, upper middle class at best. 

>**lizeken**

>OP how did they even meet? I mean I had some weird friends in their 20s as a teen because I grew up in a small town, but late 30s is absurd

**OOP**: Through sports apparently. My niece does tennis and so does he, in the same club and they met during a tournament (at least that’s what she told me the first time she told me she had a boyfriend)

>**ReginaldDwight**

>Was he her coach?

**OOP**: No I don’t think so. From what I understood, Ella was in a tournament in her club and she played against adults, she played against Mark and after he came to talk to her so they talked and that was basically it 

>**NHFNCFRE**

>Info: is there a religious or cultural expectation that would make this more acceptable to your family? I personally think it's gross, but I'm some areas and religions it's almost expected.

**OOP**: No, or at least not in my family. Some of them are vaguely Christian, but somewhat traditional, not anything weird that would explain enabling this relationship. But my niece and I are atheists (as far as I know)

>**TNJDude**

>How old was Ella when they started dating? People are assuming she was 17 when they started, though it's possible she was 18 since it's less than a year since she announced they were dating. If she was 17, I'd have serious concerns. I'd have those concerns if she was 18, but she'd have been an adult at the time and it would have been up to her. Since she IS an adult now and is capable of making her own decisions as to who to date, I have to go with YTA. It would be understandable to have concerns. It'd be understandable to talk to your brother and niece about your concerns. You could have talked to them about all of your concerns, but you didn't. You shouted and demanded and insulted all of them and slammed the door and even now have the attitude that they all need to do what you tell them with no discussion.

**OOP**: She announced they were dating last Christmas, so 11 months ago. She turned 18 7 months ago. She was 17 when she told me, and she said they had been dating a few months (like 3 or 4 I can’t remember). So she was around 17 and 4 or 5 months

>**versatiledork**

>I find it weird how you only just found out about all these details. Meeting him in person, his true age...is there any chance she was worried you'd think this way & tried to hide it from you? You just sound like a caring uncle looking out for their niece.

**OOP**: I’m not sure she was worried, but I think there’s a chance that that’s the reason why he was never able to make it when he was invited to a family gathering…

Tell her you trust her to put herself first and you are always there for her. This is important. It’s pretty much guaranteed that she is or will be a victim of this man’s abuse so make it clear you’re ride or die. This is part of your insurance against isolation. 

>call your brother and apologize for your reaction. Then, act like he must be concerned. Act concerned for him; “how are you managing this? You must be so scared for her.

>If you think the relationships overlapped, check for him on dating apps. He could still be trolling around for young women. If you do find him on one, don’t instantly show it. He could try and explain it away by saying it’s an old profile. You could potentially try and catfish him so there is more evidence, but I don’t know if that would have any legal ramifications where you are. Getting a screen shot with a current date showing he’s online in the app would be good, but might be difficult.

>Definitely run his details through Clare’s law and Sarah’s law or any similar/equivalent things in your country.

>Obviously there isn’t a guarantee you’d find anything incriminating, but if you’ve found pictures of him with other young women, it’s likely he’s a massive creep. Although he can still be a creep but be legally fine. But I still highly recommend quietly digging into him and his past as much as possible.

>I know some may think it’s an over reaction and intrusive, but honestly I’d rather do that and hope to find something rather than just letting it go.

# [UPDATE #1 - 1 DAY LATER]

So I've taken the past 24h to really reflect on all of this, I tried to take in most of the advice in the comments, and here's what I have decided. I don't think that me telling her and everyone that the relationship is weird was wrong, I do however think that I did it wrong and it was pretty harsh because it was in the heat of the moment. But I still find this very creepy and don't think she should get married.

What I've decided to do is:

1. Apologize to her. I sent her a text saying I was sorry for my outburst and that I should've thought it through beforehand. I told her that I never wanted to make her feel like I didn't want her to be happy, and that I loved her very much and had her best interests in mind.
2. Ask her if we could talk about this. I asked if she would be okay and free to hang out and maybe get coffee this week to talk about all of this with a clear head. I really want to try and get her to see why it's weird and that maybe marrying him is not a great choice.
3. Explain myself to my brother. I sent him a text saying that I was sorry for the way I said it, but that I still thought that it needed to be said. I explained to him why I think Mark is a predator and this relationship could have a very negative and damaging impact on Ella.

I'm still waiting on their replies. I'll update when they reply, or when I see Ella (if she accepts), depending on how long it would take.

In the meantime, I really want to thank everyone who gave me advice and was constructive, and really tried to help my niece out of this situation. I also send my best to all of the people in the comments sharing similar stories when they were the teenager getting groomed. I'm so sorry this happened to you and I really hope you're doing better now.

>**Mother\_Search3350**

>I would be doing a deep dive background check on that Mark guy if I were you. No 35 year old man  randomly dates a 17 year old girl and engages her as soon as she turns 18

**OOP**: Yeah, my friends and I are currently going through his socials. We’ve done facebook already and found his last ex was around 20-24 and their relationship overlapped with his relationship with my niece… 

We’ve also made multiple fake accounts on dating apps, as 18-22yo to see if he has a profile on there and if so, if he would also go for a younger girl. 

# [UPDATE #2 - 4 days of the Original Post]

So, following my text (see last post), Ella replied and told me she agreed to meet with me and talk. I just came back from seeing her.

Here's how it went. She asked me what I wanted to tell her and I started explaining that I didn't think her relationship was very healthy, and that no older guy should want to date a teenager. I told her that she was an incredible woman so I wasn't saying it was weird that someone would want to marry her, but that guys my age normally shouldn't even look at a teenager. She wasn't convinced and said that sometimes it's true but sometimes it's okay. I asked her how she would feel if I told her that someone born today could be her future partner, and she said it felt really weird. I also asked her if she would consider dating someone younger than 15, and she said no.

I could see her starting to realize that Mark maybe didnt have the best intentions. I also asked her if she knew about his previous relationship, and she said ""vaguely"" and just told me the girl's name. I asked her if she knew how old the girl was and she said she was 21. I also asked her if she knew that their relationships overlapped and she said that Mark always told her he was single since they met, but she kind of felt like that wasn't true. I told her that since his previous girlfriend was also significantly younger it seemed like he had a thing for younger girls, which is kind of weird.

After discussing that, she told me a bit more about her relationship. She told me she was starting to feel weird about it because of Mark's recent behavior. I asked what she meant and she said that he had been flirting with a lot of girls, who were all also younger, including some of Ella's friends. When she confronted him he sort of gaslit her into thinking it wasn't flirting. He was also making a lot of comments about having children with Ella and how cute it would be to see her raise them. She told me she was absolutely not ready for that and also wanted to go to college and work and not be a SAHM. Because of all of that she was doubting her relationship and I told her that I understood.

She said she was scared of breaking up with him because he had become her whole life recently and she didn't know what she would do without him. I told her that she was surrounded by people who loved her and would be there for her, and that she was a lot more than just Mark's girlfriend. I said that she knew my opinion on it, but that ultimately the choice was hers, and that I just wanted her to be happy. I also said I would be there for her no matter what. She told me that she will try to break up with him this week, and she'll let me know how it goes. I'll edit this post if I have more info.

Also, again, thank you to everyone who gave advice and tried to help us. I really appreciate it.

Edit: Okay so I just want to say, some people in the comments seem to think that this is fake, and you know what, I can understand. And I don't really care, I'm not asking you to believe that my life is real or fake, and it's great that you don't just believe everything you see online. But I just want to say this: there are hundreds of people on here or elsewhere that share similar stories. I'm not really affected by people thinking I'm lying, mainly because I'm not the one in that situation. But some people might be. Some people come on here to share something that might have traumatized them, and the last thing they want is for others to think they're lying. So if you don't want to believe me that's fine, but the next time keep that to yourself. It's fine to not believe something, but you don't have to say it, because it might make other people feel really bad.

# [RELEVANT COMMENTS OF THE 2ND UPDATE]

>**gmnitsua**

>Were you aware that the guy's previous relationship overlapped? I'm confused by the wording there.

**OOP**: To explain this in more details: 

I went through the guy’s socials with my friends a few days ago because we thought there might be other weird things going on and we ended up finding info about his previous relationship (the one right before Ella). 

So Ella told me at Christmas (so december 24th) that they had been dating for “a few months”, but when we searched his Facebook we saw a post wishing happy birthday to a girl who he called his “baby” on December 12th. And this girl appeared in other posts where they were kissing or he was calling her pet names so we assumed she was his gf. Which Ella confirmed afterwards.

And this girl also looked very young. He at one point wrote something about her and said “as soon as you’re done with college”, so we knew she was in college. And she looked between 20 and 25. And Ella then confirmed that she was 21. 

But yeah basically it seemed like he was still with his ex while dating Ella, so I asked her if she knew about that.

>**turBo246**

>It's interesting that in the first paragraph, Ella wasn't convinced, saying, ""Sometimes that's true, but sometimes it's ok.""

>In the next paragraph, she's telling you about the things that Mark has done that make her feel weird about the relationship.

>And ALL IT TOOK was you, her uncle, to say, ""Would you date a person that was born today?"", to make her realize that the 18-year age gap is weird....

>I was convinced the story was real until this update. 🙄 I can't wait to learn what your brother has to say!!

>Updateme

**OOP**: No, basically I was telling her that it was weird for him to date her and she was telling me that she understood that older men dating younger girls can be creepy as a whole, but sometimes it’s just because they’re in love. 

Then I talked for a while about how men our age normally perceive 18yo as literal children, so they don’t go after them unless they’re actually okay with dating children. And when I asked her that question it really hit her and she admitted that maybe it was actually weird. 

And then she talked about all the red flags, but it was kind of unrelated. I think it’s the addition of both of these things that made her really come to the realization that the relationship was a bit weird. 

But what I didn’t say in the post is, this took a really long time. We talked for over 3 hours and what I posted is just a really big summary of all we said. I just tried to keep it short but it wasn’t as quick as it seems to be. 

>**Puppet007**

>But since her family was so accepting of her relationship with Mark when she announced their engagement, they’ll either go after her saying she let go “such a great guy” and/or you for “putting your nose in where it didn’t belong”.

>Your niece is going to need all the support she can get to break away from him.

**OOP**: Yeah, I’m pretty sure if she ends up breaking up with him (which I hope) her dad will blame me for it… Which is the last thing she’ll need if she manages to get out of that relationship 

>**Pippet\_4**

>Take all the blame. Let them redirect any BS at you and not her. Your brother is an absolute failure as a parent. If it were me I’d not care one bit if he was mad at me as long as he leaves his daughter alone.

>You are a good man. Keep being there for your niece. Hopefully she gets away from that creep asap… but even if not, hope she gets there eventually.

>As a woman I wish I could tell her all about how this POS will ruin her life and how to see through his bullshit… but that is why he went after a child, so he can manipulate someone who cannot see him for what he is easily. There are so many women who could share their stories. It sucks to feel helpless to stop this. Like watching a kid chase a ball into the road who doesn’t see a car coming. But all you can do is exactly what you have already done, and continue to be there for her.

**OOP**: I will gladly take the blame, but I’m just scared she’ll feel guilty about it and blame herself if she sees that her dad is mad at me. She’s a very empathetic kid, which is a really great quality, but sometimes she hurts herself because of it…

# [UPDATE #3 - 1 month after the Original Post]

I know it's been a while since I posted the last update and a lot of people have been requesting updates on the whole situation, but until now I hadn't really received any news. So please forgive me if this update took a while to come.

Since my conversation with Ella, I would check in on her once or twice a week and ask how things were and she'd always tell me pretty much the same as what she told me a month ago. Basically, there were many red flags and she was getting more and more uncomfortable in her relationship but she also didn't know how to break up with him. I tried to give her some advice but eventually told her that I thought she should do it when she felt comfortable.

Yesterday I called her to know what she had planned on Christmas and if she'd be coming to the Christmas dinner that I was hosting, and if Mark would be coming. That's when she told me that she had broken up with him the evening before. She was pretty shaken up so I didn't ask for too much detail and asked if she wanted to come to my house for a while. She said that Mark had left to stay with his family when she told him, so she was okay staying home.

This is maybe not a very detailed update but here's what I know. She told me that he had been getting angry at her all week for small things. And then they were talking about Christmas and he insisted that they shouldn't go with Ella's family and instead spend a week with his family because they see them less often (they live out of state). And after that he made a comment about how he hoped that the next year as a present they could give his mother a grandchild, and Ella said that's what really made her break up with him. And she also told me that she would be coming alone for Christmas.

I don't know what she told him or how he reacted, and maybe she'll tell me more in a while when she feels better, and if not I won't ask her to. If I get more information I'll edit this post but for now that's it. Again, thank you to anyone who gave advice and tried to help with this situation.

# [UPDATE #4 - 6 MONTHS LATER]

I know it has been months since my last update, and to be honest I logged off reddit and completely forgot about it. My niece and I were just reminiscing about everything that happened and I decided to show her the posts I had made back then and the comments. She read a lot of it and wanted me to thank all of the people that were kind and gave advice or tried to help her. She also told me to tell all the people who shared similar stories how sorry she was that it happened to them.

Some people were also asking for updates so we wanted to let you know what the situation was. Since she broke up with him, Mark has tried to come back multiple times, apologizing for the things he said and trying everything to win her back. He was very insistent but she never took him back and I'm really proud of her for that. She managed to find a nice apartment and has cut all contact with him.

I guess you could say that all's well that ends well. It wasn't easy but Ella has been strong and now she's happier than ever, which is the only thing that matters.

Thank you to everyone who helped and supported her, your kindness means a lot to the both of us. Wishing you all the best.

Edit: I forgot to say this and I feel like it's important to share it. While we were talking Ella was originally telling me that she was very ashamed and felt stupid for not seeing how bad the relationship was. She somehow felt like it was her fault for being too naive. I reassured her and told her that in no way was it her fault, but what really helped her see that was reading all of the similar experiences that happened to other people. Maybe it seems stupid but she realized that it wasn't any of those people's fault so it wasn't hers either, and she wasn't the one who should be ashamed. All of this to say, this is the very reason why I think it's so important to talk about those things. Just knowing that you're not alone, that it happened to others can really help. To anyone out there going that went or is going through something similar, you are not alone.

# [RELEVANT COMMENTS IN THE 4TH UPDATE]

>**Far-Season-695**

>Good to hear! Did anything happen with your bro or family (ie they apologized or agreed with you)?

**OOP**: They didn't apologize directly but they had a big conversation with Ella and she told them about all of the things she realized were really weird and disturbing in the relationship so I guess it opened their eyes and they now agree that it was not really a normal relationship. Everything is good with them now

>**KaposiaDarcy**

>I just read all of this and I'm so happy it ended well for her.

>To those who insist on calling the whole thing fake because of a stupid trend where you declare all posts fake, I have something to say.

>Someday, you'll do that to someone who is vulnerable and looking for advice and they'll end up choosing to stay in a potentially dangerous situation because instead of advice and encouragement, they received harassing unsolicited ""reviews"" on their post and decided that no one cared and gave up. If you decide that risk is worth it for the sake of following a mindless trend rather than developing an actual personality of your own, that tells us everything we need to know about you as a person. You'll sell your humanity for some imaginary points on a social media site. Pathetic.

**OOP**: This needed to be said. Thank you

***TL;DR - OOP's 18 year old niece (Ella) at the time introduced her 36 year old boyfriend (Mark) in a family gathering and they announced their engagement. Everyone of the family congratulated the couple, except OOP who strongly opposed and he calls Mark a creepy and a predator for that. OOP got berated by his family for that. Later he talks to Ella and she confides to OOP that she saw some redflags in Mark like him flirting with some of her friends and pressuring her to be pregnant.

1nkgb2a,https://i.redd.it/yepu9spfvypf1.jpeg,Malaika Arora’s Morning Yoga Flow: Can It Really Boost Energy?,"When it comes to fitness inspiration in Bollywood, few names are as consistent as **Malaika Arora**. Whether it’s her headstands on Instagram or her glowing post-workout selfies, she has become the face of yoga for many in India. But beyond the glamour and hashtags, there’s a serious question: *does morning yoga actually boost energy, or is it just another celebrity fitness fad?*

Let’s break it down — both from Malaika’s perspective and what science has to say.

# Why Malaika Arora Swears by Morning Yoga

Malaika has openly said she prefers starting her day with yoga instead of hitting the gym first thing. According to her, yoga:

* **Centers her mind** before a busy schedule
* **Energizes her body** without making her feel drained
* **Improves flexibility** to balance her gym training sessions
* **Supports her skin and overall glow** (a benefit many fans often comment on)

Her yoga flow is typically a mix of:

* **Surya Namaskar (Sun Salutations):** A sequence of poses that gets the blood pumping and muscles warmed up.
* **Balancing Poses like Tree Pose:** Great for stability and focus, especially in the morning when you need clarity.
* **Core Strength Work (Planks, Boat Pose):** To build endurance and keep her abs strong.
* **Pranayama (Breathwork):** To regulate breath, increase oxygen, and calm the nervous system.

She often highlights **consistency** — doing a little every day rather than pushing herself to extremes.

# The Science Behind Morning Yoga

Yoga isn’t just about flexibility; it has real physiological benefits, especially in the morning.

# 1. Oxygen = Energy

Deep breathing and stretching improve oxygen delivery to your brain and muscles. More oxygen means better focus, less fatigue, and a natural wake-up effect.

# 2. Blood Circulation Boost

Gentle poses like sun salutations increase blood flow without straining the heart. Think of it as “warming up” your system for the day.

# 3. Stress Hormone Reset

Yoga lowers cortisol, the hormone that spikes in the morning and sometimes makes you feel anxious or groggy. Lower cortisol = calmer, more stable energy.

# 4. Digestion & Metabolism Kickstart

Certain poses (like twists) gently stimulate digestion and metabolism, helping your body process food more efficiently through the day.

# 5. Sustainable Consistency

Unlike high-intensity cardio, yoga is low-impact. That means you can do it daily without risking overtraining, making it easier to stay consistent.

# Morning Yoga vs. Coffee: Which Gives Better Energy?

Let’s be real — most of us reach for coffee when we feel sluggish in the morning. Malaika’s yoga practice offers a different path.

* **Coffee gives a quick spike, followed by a crash.**
* **Yoga builds energy gradually**, leaving you more awake and alert without dependency.
* Plus, yoga reduces the stress that caffeine can sometimes increase (jittery hands, racing thoughts).

In other words, yoga is about *sustainable energy*, not a temporary fix.

# How You Can Try Malaika’s Routine

The best part? You don’t need to be a celebrity or an advanced yogi to benefit. Even **10–15 minutes** can make a difference. Here’s a beginner-friendly version of Malaika’s flow:

1. **3–5 Rounds of Surya Namaskar** – Start slow, focus on breath.
2. **Tree Pose or Warrior II** – Hold for balance and stability.
3. **Plank to Side Plank** – Activate your core.
4. **Seated Twist** – Support digestion.
5. **5 Minutes of Pranayama** – Try alternate nostril breathing or simple deep belly breaths.

Do this before checking your phone or diving into work — you’ll feel more focused and awake.

# Is Yoga Enough for Fitness?

While Malaika credits yoga as a cornerstone of her health, it’s not the *only* thing she does. She also trains at the gym and follows a clean diet.

Yoga is excellent for energy, flexibility, stress management, and long-term sustainability. But for **cardiovascular fitness and strength building**, you’ll want to combine it with:

* Weight training or bodyweight exercises
* Walking, jogging, or cardio
* Balanced nutrition rich in protein, fiber, and healthy fats

So, think of yoga as the *foundation* of energy and balance, not the whole house.

# What People Say About Morning Yoga

Many who’ve tried switching from coffee to yoga in the morning report:

* Less afternoon fatigue
* More stable mood throughout the day
* Better focus at work
* Lower reliance on caffeine

One Redditor even joked: *“I thought I needed coffee to wake up, turns out I just needed to breathe.”*

# 🫀 Quick Takeaway

Malaika Arora’s morning yoga flow isn’t just for show. Science backs the idea that starting your day with mindful movement and breathwork can lead to:  
✅ More sustainable energy  
✅ Better focus  
✅ Lower stress  
✅ Improved metabolism

So no, yoga won’t magically give you Malaika’s abs — but it can absolutely help you feel more alive in the morning.

If you’ve never tried it, start with 10 minutes tomorrow and see how your body responds. Sometimes, the best energy booster isn’t in a cup — it’s already in your breath.",2,1758220252.0,Healthandlifetips,1,1.0,False

I run a travel planning company based in Whistler, and while I love my home mountain, I'm all too aware of how the rising costs and long lift lines are pushing many skiers/riders to look elsewhere. With winter fast approaching, I’m doing some supplier discovery for a BC-focused travel project, with the intention of steering travellers to other mountains that suit their vibe and preferences. To do that, I'm seeking the advice of locals: who are the small businesses and individuals in your community that make a ski holiday memorable? Think all those little gems that can't be discovered simply by searching Google or asking AI.

This could be anything from:

\-A vacation rental host who loves to share their local knowledge  
\-A café with not only outstanding coffee/food, but super friendly service  
\-A restaurant or pub known for a *specific dish*  
\-A private guide with a personality to match their gnarly skills

To be clear:

\-This is not to solicit partnerships as I do **not** take commissions or charge businesses to be included in my network of suppliers.  
\-My work is client-paid, so recommendations are shared only with travellers who will genuinely value them.

I know ski season is a lifeline for many BC communities, and my intention is to highlight locally owned/operated places that offer a ""feeling"" as much as a product or service. If there’s someone in your town (whether they're hosting, brewing, guiding, or cooking) who makes your town special, I’d be grateful to hear about them. And if you're a operator reading this, feel free to message me privately -- I'm always happy to chat!

Thanks in advance, and here’s to a safe, snowy season ahead!",1,1758220237.0,Revelstoke,6,0.67,False
1nkga23,https://www.reddit.com/r/gallbladders/comments/1nkga23/gallstones_and_weight_loss/,Gallstones and weight loss,"Hey everyone!  I’ve been suffering from GERD for years and over the past year it’s gotten much worse with these attacks that landed me in the ER once, so my doctor sent me to get a gallbladder ultrasound.  

I went today and the ultrasound tech kept asking me if I was sure I haven’t ate or drank anything for 8 hours, even coffee with cream.  I said no and asked her if she was seeing something.  She told me she saw gallstones and asked if I have a family history of gallbladder issues.  I said yes, my mom got her gallbladder taken out and my little sister recently started having severe stomach issues so got an ultrasound and they found stones on her gallbladder too.  We wrapped up and she said I’ll know the results within a few days, so I don’t know how severe my gallstones are yet.  

I’m not sure if they will recommend I have surgery or not,  but I’m worried because I’ve been trying to lose weight the last 4 months and I read that losing weight can cause gallstones.  I started trying to lose weight because I thought the attacks were my GERD and my weight was the highest it ever has been.  I’ve since lost weight at a rate of about 6 pounds per month, which I thought wouldn’t be so bad since I’m obese with a lot of weight to lose.  

Now that they’ve discovered gallstones I’m wondering if I should slow down the weight loss?  I go through the VA so even if they recommend a surgery it may take a while before I get it.  I have felt better since the weight loss and I want to keep going, but I don’t want to risk making things worse.  ",1,1758220191.0,gallbladders,0,1.0,False

Both machines are well-maintained, I believe. But suddenly all the coffee I make tastes... weak. The flavors I'm used to getting out of the machine just aren't there. 

I've cleaned the grinder thoroughly and fiddled with grind settings. I've replaced the brew basket (it was old and I wondered if a spring was going, therefore messing with the flow). And I've changed beans. It's gotten a *little* better but still underwhelming compared to how our coffee used to taste. 

Further context: 

* We're a light roast family -- currently brewing [Gimme! Stargazer](https://gimmecoffee.com/products/stargazer-fairtrade-organic?variant=44879402860763) through Trade. 

* The beans were roasted recently and ground on settings between 12 and 15 on the Baratza Encore, the range I normally use for light roast. 

* The Moccamaster is descaled every ~90 days as recommended. We're about halfway between cycles currently. The Baratza was recently fully cleaned. 

* For ratios I currently use ~35g ground coffee to 1/2 L water (the ""4"" mark on the Moccamaster). This makes about one and a half mugs of coffee. My understanding is this is *more* coffee than the 1/16 ratio would call for. 

* My wife drinks cold brew in the warm months, which I also grind and make for her in a carafe (not the Moccamaster of course), and she reports no change in the taste of her cold brew. 


Has this ever happened to you? What did you do to change things up? Is it possible to wind up with weak coffee because your grind is *too fine* or the grinder burr *too clean*? I did clean it very thoroughly recently.

Definitely a bit of an eccentric and on the spectrum. Work in tech but hate tech culture…I can’t take the blandness of Silicon Valley anymore. It’s beginning to grate on me whenever I go to a coffee shop and overhear people talking about their startups or AI (I work in both of these spaces, ironically). 

I’m also fully remote and my company has offices in both places so it would just be a formality to move. 

While I would like to meet somebody, I cannot stand online dating (I do get matches and can hold a conversation etc). You would think for somebody like me I would’ve found my person in Silicon Valley but I find most people I’d be interested in are already in relationships and tbf I don’t really fit in with most tech people either…I’ve been slowly trying to make peace with the idea that maybe finding somebody isn’t on the cards - and frankly the suburban-ness and tendency towards family orientation of the greater Bay Area isn’t for me. 

I want to be a place where I am not constantly reminded of my singledom every weekend - a place where it’s more normal to be single in late 30’s or 40’s and there’s more orientation towards singledom. 


I spent a month recently in both LA and NY…granted a month might be too short but here are my takeaways:

NY
Pros
1. Probably better for single people of my age if not for dating prospects, just for the fact that the place isn’t necessarily oriented towards families. 
2. Just being outside gives me the stimulation I need.
3. Management of my company is located here so moving might give me more FaceTime and be better for my career. 
4. Seems more geared towards eccentric people or at least it isn’t so out of place. 
5. Tech isn’t dominant industry. 

Cons
1. Would have to downsize substantially - ie go back to my 20’s/early 30’s standard of living. 
2. Move would be expensive and logistically difficult due to my stuff. 
3. No car - I’ve grown used to having a car. 
4. Would negatively affect my savings if I rent a decent place. 
5. Can be dirty/grimy
6. Weather sucks compared to California. 

LA
Pros
1. Easier move
2. Would keep my car 
3. Larger living spaces - wouldn’t have to downsize.
4. Tech isn’t dominant industry 
6. Lots of potential places to move - eg beach, city etc
7. Overall the city has more interesting stuff to do and more creative people. 

Cons
1. Not a huge difference from the bay - still kinda spread out and hard to meet people organically, though people seem more interesting. 
2. Fire risk - I can totally see why the place caught fire
3. In one month of being there my car got vandalized twice. 
4. Less grimy than NYC but still kind of grimy compared to the Bay Area. 

LA might be the more sensible move - however I don’t know if it would offer me the personal/emotional difference that NY would. 

So what do you think?

1nkg5dr,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1nkg5dr,Slaves - Robinsons from the island of Tromelin.,"Tromelin is a piece of land lost in the Indian Ocean; its closest neighbor, the island of Madagascar, is 350 kilometers away.

This story takes place in the distant past, when France was a thriving colonial empire. Beginning in the 16th century, the country expanded its overseas holdings. King Henry IV sent expeditions to Canada and sent parties of colonists there. Cardinal Richelieu organized the construction of a fleet and provided significant support to overseas trading companies. The French established control over vast territories, trade grew, and cotton, coffee, cocoa, and spices were shipped from the colonies to the mother country. Louis XIV's finance minister, Colbert, founded the West India Company for the Atlantic Ocean and the East India Company for the Indian Ocean, and later other companies for overseas trade.

Black slaves were brought from Africa to work on plantations. Although even at the dawn of the colonial empire, French humanists disapproved of colonial policy—Montaigne spoke of ""child-peoples"" being exterminated by Europeans, and Rabelais urged treating natives like newborns—merchants from Nantes, Rouen, and Bordeaux traded Africans. In 1686, Madagascar was declared a French possession. Other bases were established on the route to India in the Mascarene Islands—Bourbon (now Réunion) and Île-de-France (now Mauritius), where French plantations producing sugar, coffee, and cocoa were established using Black slave labor. The slave trade grew, reaching its peak in the 18th century.

On November 17, 1760, the sailing transport ship L'Utile (owned by the Royal Navy and later sold to the East India Company for trade in the Mascarene Islands in the Indian Ocean) departed from Bayonne, France, for Madagascar. It set out to collect provisions: beef, rice, and spices. However, the L'Utile was never destined to return to its home port. On July 31, 1761, the ship was wrecked off Tromelin Island (then known as Pesca), 350 kilometers from Madagascar. It was carrying 122 French crew members and, according to various sources, between 100 and 200 Malagasy slaves, illegally taken for sale on the island of Île-de-France.

According to logbook entries preserved in the archives of the coastal town of Lorient, most of the slaves were unable to escape from the hold and perished during the shipwreck because the ""hatchways were closed."" The 60 slaves who were lucky enough to survive, along with 122 crew members, found themselves stranded on an uninhabited island. But what an island! It was essentially a sandbank 1,700 meters long and 700 meters wide, surrounded by coral reefs and overgrown with low shrubs—a convenient nesting site for birds and sea turtles. The island was located in the path of cyclones and lacked abundant vegetation: large trees could not withstand the onslaught of strong winds. Fortunately, fresh water was found on the island, offering hope for survival.

Two months later, the French managed to build a small vessel and set off, promising the slaves they would return for them, but they did not keep their promise. Upon reaching Île-de-France, the French crew appealed to the local authorities to rescue the slaves, but they refused. Many were outraged by this decision, including the renowned French writer Bernardin de Saint-Pierre (who was on Île-de-France at the time), but to no avail. Soon, everyone forgot about the slaves.

Only 15 years later, on November 29, 1776, the Malagasy were sighted by sailors from the corvette ""La Dauphine."" Approaching the island proved difficult—three boats failed to dock, and only the fourth succeeded. It carried the ship's captain, Chevalier de Tromelin, after whom the island was later named. Of the 60 Malagasy, only eight survived the 15-year voyage—seven women and an eight-month-old child.

There are stories from the women, of the seven who managed to survive, that for 15 years they kept the fire going, wore loincloths made of bird feathers, ate small birds and turtles, and used copper utensils that had survived the shipwreck and been patched many times.",3,1758219893.0,pubhistory,3,1.0,False

At home I mostly use a V60, which I'd say that I still prefer over the Oxo overall, but the Oxo does make a really good cup and is a probably the best option when you don't have a gooseneck kettle available.

Normally, I travel with my Aeropress and I mostly do the 400g Coffee Chronicler method that's no bypass. I tried adapting that method and recipe to the Oxo and it worked pretty well (made a post about it on here if you care to search for it), but now I've just been doing americanos with a soup shot, which I feel I've gotten pretty dialed.

I've found that what works best is 20g of coffee at 5 on my K-Max. That's basically on the finer side of what I'll sometimes use with my V60. At that coarseness with the grounds tamped fairly lightly, I can usually get the puck fully soaked on the first pump, but I've found that the coffee still tastes very good if a second or even third light pump is required for the soak.

When I've tamped too hard I've noticed channeling and I've gotten bitter cups. Counter intuitively, I've also gotten less pressure build up on the first pump when I've tamped too hard. I'm not sure if that's the result of there being a lower grind volume when the tamp is firmer, or if the puck density makes it more difficult for water to get in and expand the grounds, or what the explanation might be.

Other than that, I'm using 80ish grams of water, which yields a shot that is around 60g, and then I'm topping if off with 180g of water.

Some considerations: 

* I got a shot mirror that almost fits in the lower chamber, but not quite. You can still screw it on most of the way so that it fits into the box with the Oxo for travel. It would be cool if Oxo does a future version that has a mirror that stashes away and it would also be cool if the catch cup screwed onto the top of of the Oxo so that the whole thing could stay together outside of the box.
* The catch cup often gets so steamed up from the hot water, that you can't see the bottom of the filter anyhow.",11,1758219854.0,pourover,1,0.92,False

# Hey there! 

Let’s break this down like we’re sitting at the kitchen table with a cup of coffee and your financial goals in front of us. If you're looking to tackle high-interest debt or finance a big purchase without racking up interest, the right balance transfer card can be a game-changer. I’m going to walk through four top options available right now with 0% intro APRs lasting until 2027 or longer, and we’ll see which one fits your situation best.

# 🏆 Citi® Diamond Preferred® Card

https://preview.redd.it/rfn5o3cvtypf1.png?width=222&format=png&auto=webp&s=750f3fbc941d9866468c2a43dfff259d7b289d24

Let’s start with the **Citi Diamond Preferred**. This one is a standout if you want **maximum time to pay off your debt**. It gives you **0% on purchases for 12 months** and a **massive 21 months of 0% on balance transfers**. That means if you move a balance over now, you won’t start paying interest until **late 2027** — perfect if you’re planning a slow, steady payoff.

But here’s the catch: the **balance transfer fee is 5%** (with a $5 minimum). So if you transfer $10,000, you’ll pay $500 in fees upfront. That’s a big chunk, but if you’re not in a rush, that $500 can save you **thousands in interest** over time. This card is **no annual fee**, which is a big plus, but it **doesn’t offer rewards**. So it’s all about the time, not the perks.

**Best for:** People with high-interest debt who want a **long runway** to pay it off without the pressure of interest.

# 🏆 Wells Fargo Reflect® Card

https://preview.redd.it/u2xgysswtypf1.png?width=349&format=png&auto=webp&s=e5f6c6268b2cbf993da83a13d92c91fee8c42212

Now, the **Wells Fargo Reflect** is another solid contender. It gives you **0% for 21 months on both purchases and balance transfers** — same as the Citi one. The big difference here is the **balance transfer fee**. For the **first 60 days**, it’s just **3%** (minimum $5), which is **cheaper than Citi**. After that, it goes up to **4%**.

Let’s do a quick math check. If you transfer $10,000 within the first 60 days, you’ll pay **$300 in fees**. If you wait a bit longer, it goes to **$400**. That’s a **$100 savings** if you act fast. Like the Citi card, it has **no annual fee** and **no rewards**, but the **lower transfer fee early on** can make a big difference in your savings.

**Best for:** People who want the **same 21-month payoff window**, but are looking to **minimize fees** if they can transfer early.

# 🏆 U.S. Bank Visa® Platinum Card

https://preview.redd.it/8itpsc7ytypf1.png?width=283&format=png&auto=webp&s=c873164ffb1af35fe85195a4f0d44cc7a48dee64

The **U.S. Bank Visa Platinum** is a bit of a legacy card. It used to be a go-to for the **18-month 0% intro APR** on both purchases and balance transfers. The **balance transfer fee is 3% or $5 minimum** for the first 60 days, then jumps to **5%**. It also has a **minor perk** — **cell phone insurance**. Not much else in terms of rewards or bonuses.

This card is **no longer accepting new applications**, which is a bummer because it was a solid option for those who wanted **flexibility** and **basic coverage**. But if you’re a current customer of U.S. Bank, you might already have it in your wallet. If not, it’s not a great new option to consider.

**Best for:** Current U.S. Bank customers who want to use the **18-month 0% offer** — not for new applicants.

# 🏆 Capital One Quicksilver Cash Rewards Credit Card

https://preview.redd.it/d3pibgqztypf1.png?width=300&format=png&auto=webp&s=9d34d69c7b4dbc6f1f5dd10ccab18a2f30dfa5cd

Here’s where things get a little different. The **Capital One Quicksilver** isn’t just a balance transfer card — it’s a **cash back card with a solid intro offer**. You get **0% APR for 15 months on purchases and balance transfers**, and you also get a **$300 sign-up bonus** — $200 in cash and $100 in travel credit.

That’s not bad if you plan to transfer a balance and **start earning rewards right away**. The card earns **1.5% cash back on all purchases**, which is a decent flat rate, especially for people who don’t want to track rotating categories. The **balance transfer fee** is standard (usually 3-5%, but not explicitly listed), and the **ongoing APR** is 19.24%–29.24%.

**Best for:** People who want to **combine debt relief with rewards** — especially if you spend $500 in the first 3 months and get the $300 bonus.

# 🤔 So, which should you pick?

Let’s walk through a few scenarios to help you decide.

# Scenario 1: You want to pay off a $10,000 balance with no rush

* **Citi Diamond Preferred** gives you **21 months to pay off** the balance. That’s a full year and a half.
* **Wells Fargo Reflect** also gives you **21 months**, but the **lower transfer fee** (3%) for the first 60 days is a big win.
* **Capital One Quicksilver** offers **15 months**, which is still good, but **shorter** than the other two.

**Verdict:** If you want **maximum time**, pick **Citi** or **Wells Fargo**. If you can transfer within the **first 60 days**, **Wells Fargo** is the **cheapest option**.

# Scenario 2: You want to transfer and start earning rewards

* **Capital One Quicksilver** wins here. Even though it’s a flat-rate 1.5%, it’s **1.5% on everything you spend**, including transfers.
* **Citi and Wells Fargo** give you **no rewards**, so you’re just using them to save on interest.

**Verdict:** If you want **rewards while you pay off debt**, go with **Quicksilver**. It’s the only one that gives you **cash back** and a **welcome bonus**.

# Scenario 3: You’re a forgetful payer and want a safety net

* **Wells Fargo Reflect** is the only card that **waives late fees and penalty APR** if you miss a payment. That’s huge if you’re not the most organized with your due dates.
* **Citi Simplicity** also has this benefit, but it’s not part of the data we have here.

**Verdict:** If you’re worried about missing a payment, **Wells Fargo** is your best bet.

Let’s say you apply **today, September 2025**. Here’s how each card would work:

* **Citi Diamond Preferred**: You get 21 months of 0% on transfers. That means you’d be interest-free **until April 2027**.
* **Wells Fargo Reflect**: Same 21-month window, but with **3% fee** for the first 60 days (until November 2025). After that, the fee jumps to 4%. So act fast if you want to save more.
* **Capital One Quicksilver**: You get 15 months of 0% on transfers, so you’d be in the clear **until December 2026**. But you’d earn **1.5% cash back** the whole time.

# 💰 Break-Even Math

Let’s assume you transfer **$10,000** and want to know when the **interest savings outweigh the transfer fee**.

* **Citi Diamond Preferred**:
   * Transfer fee: $500 (5% of $10,000)
   * If your ongoing APR is 20%, you’d save about **$500 in interest** by the time the 0% period ends in April 2027.
   * So you’d **break even at about 10 months** of interest-free use.
* **Wells Fargo Reflect**:
   * Transfer fee: $300 (3% of $10,000)
   * At 20% APR, you’d save $300 in interest by **June 2026**.
   * That’s **9 months faster** than Citi.
* **Capital One Quicksilver**:
   * Transfer fee: Let’s say 3% = $300
   * At 20% APR, you’d break even in **about 15 months**.
   * But you get **1.5% cash back** on all purchases, so if you spend $1,000/month, you’ll earn **$150/month** in rewards.

So if you **spend a lot**, Quicksilver can actually **earn you money** while you’re paying off the balance.

# 🧠 Strategic Approval Considerations

* **Citi Diamond Preferred**: You’ll need **good to excellent credit** (670+).
* **Wells Fargo Reflect**: Also looks for **good to excellent** (670+).
* **Capital One Quicksilver**: Same range. If you’ve applied to a Citi card recently, they might **pre-screen you** if you have a good score.

If you’re in the **mid-600s**, you might want to **build credit** first with a secured card or a credit-builder card before applying for these.

# 🛠️ Optimization Tips

* **Citi & Wells Fargo**: Use these **strictly for balance transfers** and **pay them off in full** during the 0% period. These cards are **debt-focused**, not rewards-focused.
* **Capital One Quicksilver**: Use this to transfer a balance and **keep it as your daily-use card**. The cash back is **simple and consistent**, and the bonus gives you a nice head start.

# Final Thoughts

If your main goal is to **avoid interest as long as possible**, go with the **Citi Diamond Preferred** or **Wells Fargo Reflect**. If you want **rewards while you pay off**, the **Capital One Quicksilver** is the best bet.",1,1758219759.0,BONCredit,0,1.0,False

He moved from a small college town to a big city to live with me and he's struggling finding any kind of connection outside of me and our son (step to me).

We both struggle with mental health issues. I go to therapy and take antidepressants. He hasn't sought medical intervention since moving in with me. I don't want to take on a role of mothering him and don't want to force him to do anything, but I'm at my wits end.

He hates his job, hates the city, hates our neighbors and all the negativity is really hard to be around. Especially because I chose to move to the city before we ever got serious a f he gave up his life to be with me.

I feel guilty for choosing this house. Guilty that I dont have a Friend circle he can join. Guilty that I can't fix our living situation.

I don't know how to help him, I've suggested going to events, making friends at work, just going out and writing in a coffee shop or something, but he doesn't take any initiative because of his depression and other mental health issue.

I wanted to share my story in case it helps someone else feel less alone.

I’ve been dealing with chronic pain and chronic fatigue for almost 20 years. I’ve always had heavy, painful periods that the world just normalized. About 10 years ago, I had a fibroid removed and was told it was due to estrogen dominance, but never given any real explanation about why I might have a hormone imbalance. I've always tried to eat healthy since then and stayed away from soy or other hormone disrupting foods. Then in 2019, I had a large cyst removed the doctor told me it was a “chocolate cyst,” but gave no explanation of what that actually meant. The reason she wanted to remove it was bc i was having pain and the cyst grew to a size that surgery was finally indicated after monitoring it for months. She reassured me that I was fine afterwards, that I could go on birth control if I wanted (or not if I didn’t), and that I could just go on with life as normal. No monitoring plan, no talk about how endometriosis might impact me long-term. I trusted her, but now I know how far from the truth that advice was.

Through all of this, I pushed myself. I managed to put myself through vet school, ran 10Ks and half marathons, and have worked as a veterinarian for the past 10 years. But I always felt like everything was so much harder for me than for everyone else. Training felt like pushing through mud compared to my peers. Work left me exhausted and burnt out in a way others didn’t seem to experience. I convinced myself maybe I had ADHD, c-PTSD, was just “too sensitive” or neurodivergent — anything to explain why I couldn’t keep up. Eventually, I had to switch to per diem work just to get long enough breaks to function.

On top of the fatigue, I had chronic abdominal and back pain. I took Advil, used heating pads, drank coffee, and pushed through, thinking that was normal. I ended up in the ER one year because a cysts likely burst and i was throwing up in so much pain and actually still drove myself to the ER (this was before uber). Then last year my periods became irregular, which sent me back to the doctor. An ultrasound led to an MRI and that’s when I was diagnosed with deep infiltrating endometriosis (DIE). The MRI report was shocking: endo everywhere, lighting up my pelvic organs like a Christmas tree.

It took 10 months from that MRI to get finally get excision surgery. In the meantime, several doctors told me not to worry, that im probably going into early menopause (my FSH was high and AMH was low) and menopause would “make it go away,” because hormones stop, so I didn’t need surgery. BUT ENDOMETRIOSIS LESION CREATE THEIR OWN INDEPENDENT HORMONES YA""LL !! Meaning it will never just ""go way"".  They said just to go on birth control and wait. I HATE HOW HEALTHCARE PROVIDERS JUST WANT TO THROW YOU ON BIRTH CONTROL ..ITS JUST A BANDAID AND MASKS YOUR DISEASE :(

When I dug into research myself, I found out that endo doesn’t just disappear with menopause, and it can even increase the risk of cancer because it’s an inflammatory autoimmune condition. My pain was getting worse, and I was dealing with bladder issues and bowel discomfort, so I knew I couldn’t wait.

This year, I finally found an amazing women’s health provider who believed me: Dr. Lora Liu in NJ/NYC. Last week, I had surgery with her team. They performed a hysterectomy, bladder and rectal resections, ureter repair with stent placement, appendectomy, and fixed an inguinal hernia on my left side i didnt even know i had, removed endo from my sciatic nerves and hypogastric nerve plexus. The surgeons said they couldn’t believe I had still been upright, working, and living with the extent of disease they found. One of them called me a ticking time bomb stating that he insisted we move up my surgery date because he believes NOBODY SHOULD HAVE TO WAIT FOR LONG to get surgery, I was nearly inoperable by the time they went in he said. Had I waited any longer i may have had permanent irreparable nerve , bladder, bowel damage leaving me permanently disabled. I'm not trying to scare anyone I just am sharing this to emphasize the importance of not giving up and advocating for yourself. When I was younger I was more complacent and as I've matured and gotten older I've gotten better at not takinng No for an answer and pushing for answers.

When I woke up, the constant back pain and hip, even abdominal pain I had carried for years was gone. They did have to do a nerve resection and graft on my bladder, so that will take longer to heal, but I already feel a difference. They also discovered appendicitis that could have ruptured and led to sepsis.

Now, I’m processing a mix of emotions...gratitude, shock, anger, and relief all at once. But what I do know is this: **don’t give up. Find someone who believes you. Excision surgery with a true specialist is the gold standard right now.**

I’m healing now, and for the first time in decades, I feel hopeful. Sending positive and healing thoughts to everyone here who is still fighting for answers. 💛

TLDR;I lived with pain and fatigue for 20 years, always told it was “normal.”  
An MRI finally revealed deep infiltrating endometriosis everywhere.

I mean, fictionally. There’s nothing to appreciate about the Gilded Age in the 21st century because it’s basically the same as now but with prettier clothing for the rich, I guess. And women have the right to vote. For you know, as long as we can hold on to that. Oh - modern medicine is nice. ~~Don’t look at what they’re trying to do to vaccines in the US.~~ 

I always like to start these posts with how I ended up here sharing reviews because I never set out to read an entire series in a month or take two years to finish another. This time, I am laying the blame at the feet of @napamy . She’s been on me to read more Harper St. George for over a year now, and when I said I was considering picking up *The Stranger I Wed* because [THAT COVER](https://images.penguinrandomhouse.com/cover/9780593441008) , and she was like “oh yeah, the hero’s blonde” which if you don’t know is kinda my kryptonite. Too many tall, dark and handsome heroes in the genre, I say. Give me all the blonde ones. 

That was in early July. 

But from there I had to go back and read *The Duchess Takes a Husband* because that couple was pretty prominent in *The Stranger I Wed* and I loved them, and then @napamy had told me that *The Devil and the Heiress* had one of the best grovels (it does), and at that point I needed to know how the brother fell in love with the widow in Book 3 and then my hold for the 2025 release of *Eliza and the Duke* came through and \*breathes\* after that I wanted to reread *The Heiress Gets the Duke* to see if I enjoyed it more this time around. I wrapped that bad boy up the first week of September. 

I’m going to go in publication order for these reviews, not the chaos order of my reading, but **all of these books are interconnected and the next-book’s couple meets in the book you’re currently reading.** If you don’t read them in order, the meet-cute will be revisited in the couple’s actual book, but it’ll be from a different POV - why not get both character’s thoughts on their first meeting? Just trust me - read them in order.



***The Gilded Age Heiresses Series:*** 

[The Heiress Gets a Duke](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/53283742-the-heiress-gets-a-duke)

**Reread Rating: 4 Stars**

**Original Rating: 2.5 Stars**



St. George opens her series with *“a feminine wail”* at the engagement party of an unwilling American heiress who has been essentially auctioned off to the highest-titled English Peer that would take her, and I think it’s a brilliant way to set the tone.

August Crenshaw, American Heiress and Bluestocking saw one of her best friends married off to an English Peer and for some reason thought her parents wouldn’t do the same. Six months later, the trip to London to see said friend - now a Duchess, albeit a miserable one - turns out to be a matchmaking endeavor for August’s little sister, but if an English Peer wants August, her parents will welcome that marriage as well.

Before we go any further, you need to understand how much I hate the Crenshaw parents. Congrats to St. George for writing these two on the level of Dolores Umbridge for me because I haven’t hated a fictional character like this in *awhile*. My hatred will be present in every review from the series because THEY ARE THE WORST!!!! Yes, their actions are why their children are in England and why we get to read their Romances - I👏DON’T👏CARE👏!!!

Enter Evan, the newest Duke of Rothschild. Saying he’s impoverished is putting it kindly. He inherited multiple crumbling estates, empty coffers, failing tenant farms, and a heavy weight upon his shoulders (very shapely) to fix it. Evan doesn’t want a wife, let alone a wife in the next four weeks, but it would be stupid of him to turn down the Crenshaw’s matchmaking attempts when the marriage settlement would more than cover the title’s debts. 

Before the Crenshaws were offering their daughters up on a platter, Evan was making ends meet by prize-fighting. It is at his most recent fight that August was in attendance, and they shared an anonymous and reckless kiss for luck. When Evan formally meets the Crenshaws soon after in hopes of a betrothal contract, both he and August are surprised. But it’s August that is more surprised when Evan says he wants to court her, not Violet.

What follows is really just a sweet, albeit quick, developing romance between two people who are forced together due to circumstances but come to find how well they suit. August is fiery and against the marriage suit from the get-go, but Evan loves her stubbornness and sense of self. August comes to learn that Evan has only done the best he could with the mess he inherited, and that <i>yes</i> he does need her family’s money, but he also has come to need her just as much in his life. 

The third-act conflict is presented three chapters from the end of the book, and the first time I read this I was enraged at the last-minute conflict and rapid resolution to the point I was put off reading St. George for a year. This time through, I still felt the ending was a bit rushed, but I also knew from reading other books in the series that that’s just what St. George does. I do think this conflict/ending is more rushed than any of the others, and I do think it’s quiet Over The Top, but it didn’t take away from my enjoyment of the rest of the book. 



[The Devil and the Heiress](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/55655073-the-devil-and-the-heiress)**: 4 Stars** 

Violet Crenshaw, the heroine and American heiress, is more naive than her elder and now married sister, August, but I didn’t think she was too stupid to live - she just wanted to escape the marriage and life her parents had sat out before her, and so she took Lord Leigh at his word. Despite having no real reason to believe him. Nor disbelieve him, to be fair.

I was partial to Christian, Lord Leigh, because that man was Kaz Brekker coded and I am a simple woman. (He’s got a limp, a fancy cane, he can fight, his dark hair is always slicked back, and he’s goT a cold demeanor I repeat: I AM A SIMPLE WOMAN). He also did offer for Violet’s hand before scheming to help her run away while hoping he can convince her to marry him in the end. And that is manipulative, but this is also fiction, so. Actually, I was told that this book has one of the best grovels, and while correct in terms of the third-act (I just love a man doing political machinations as part of the grovel I EAT THAT SHIT UP), but Christian regrets his part in Violet’s running away pretty early into their cross-country sojourn and spends half the book low-key groveling because of it. I don’t call this man-pain delicious lightly.

But because Violet and Christian did run away (and fall in love) though, Violet is super compromised and also suddenly understands the consequences of her actions while cranking up her naivete because how could she fall right into his evil plans!!! This characterization felt out of left field, but DRAMA and it leads to their rushed wedding and strained marriage in the last fourth of the book until Violet forgives Christian and then the book is done. I stg, the second that conflict is resolved it’s THE END when it’s a book by St. George and while I didn’t mind it so much here, it’s clearly been an issue for me before.

Some other notes:

\- The Crenshaw parents are the fucking worst I have read in awhile and deserve Gilded Age prison for not only their superior wealth but how they use their daughters as bargaining chips with the English aristocracy. I know it’s the whole plot of the series - American heiress being sold off for titles/respectability - but man did St. George do a great job making these two awful.

\- There’s a bonus chapter for the book on the author’s website for newsletter subscribers

\-I think this could be 5 stars upon reread, but I read this while on vacation so I wasn’t reading it at my normal pace and by the end I was like “will I ever be free” despite enjoying it! 



[The Lady Tempts an Heir](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/58214321-the-lady-tempts-an-heir)**: 5 Stars**

Idk why Maxwell Crenshaw nor I thought his parents wouldn’t be awful about him still being unattached or about them threatening to tear his sister’s project away from the family company, BUT the subversion of the heiress for sale here being the actual first-born son was 👌🏻. Feminism means equality, Max! You can be sold off just as well as your sisters! Because your parents SUCK! (Can you tell I hate them because my god I hate them)

Helena was widowed young, and has no want for a husband, but her charities are failing because Society doesn’t think young unwed mothers should have assistance and how dare a ~~widowed~~ single young Lady besmirch her own reputation by trying to aid them. But if she had a man in her life to guide her…

Since these two have a smidge of a past from when they had to go ‘rescue’ Violet from the Earl of Leigh in Book 2, and there was a spark then..

Yes, this is a fake engagement book. Yes, those are dime a dozen in Romance - and again I👏🏻 DON’T👏🏻 CARE👏🏻. When both these idiots are insistent nothing can come of their mutual attraction or agreement, but oh no! There’s a dramatic declaration of feelings before Max has to head back to New York unexpectedly AND THEN there’s desperate communication via telegram - I never thought telegrams could be romantic but St. George PROVED MY WRONG! (Also, there’s a whole bonus chapter of MORE letters and telegrams on Harper St. George’s website for newsletter subscribers just saaaaaaying)

I also really enjoyed that Helena was infertile and it wasn’t fixed by another man’s penis, as many a Romance that touches on the topic like to do. I don’t want to say it was ‘brave’ of St. George to have Helena remain infertile, but it was a choice that gave the third-act conflict more depth, and it was handled respectfully and realistically.

There was an attempt to redeem the Crenshaw parents in the epilogue which, okay Harper if you must but it didn’t work for me and they’re still evil cartoon villains. I say this with my full chest: I hate them. When Daddy Crenshaw had a heart attack the first time, I gave a little gasp, but it couldn't happen to a nicer character. Then he apparently had another and I was like ""only the good die young, huh.""

  


[The Duchess Takes a Husband](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/59681960-the-duchess-takes-a-husband)**: 5 Stars**

The premise here is simple: Camille’s a widow has never had good sex and Jacob needs some investors to think he’s engaged, and they come to a mutually beneficial agreement. However, the fake fiancée bit takes all of 2.5 seconds and Jacob becomes very invested in Camille finding pleasure and happiness, in and out of bed.

I’m not one for “lessons in sexual pleasure” plots because I think they are a too-easy road for sex scenes and lack the development emotionally between the MCs, but St. George spent *so* much time on Camille finding pleasure everywhere in her life which made the few sex lessons shine. They were also written very, *very* well. I think one of St. George’s strengths is her ability to write sex scenes.

Jacob was one of those “Love is not for me” heroes who then is so deeply in love before he realizes it. There was the five seconds where he tried to deny their connection, but St. George loves a dramatic third-act event to wake the hero up, and it did so here.

I have nothing to say about Camille other than that she deserves the world, and I'm glad she found a man who agrees.

  


  
***The Doves of New York Series:***

[The Stranger I Wed](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/194803825-the-stranger-i-wed)**: 4 Stars**

Cora Dove is the eldest of the Dove Sisters, bastard children of Charles Hathaway who is from the upper crust of Gilded Age New York society. When his mother died, it’s revealed that she had an ounce of guilt about how the Doves had been treated, and left them large inheritances that Daddy Hathaway decided to lock away behind the stipulation that the three women must marry men he deems acceptable. Which happened to all be in England. With titles.

Harper St. George looooves a shitty parent, and I love to hate the ones she gives me. 

So, it’s off to England for Cora, her sisters, and their well-meaning but slightly crass mother where Camille, the heroine from the last book, will introduce them into society. 

First of all - when both of the MCs love languages is Acts of Service.

Second of all - this couple's meet cute is them literally running into each other on the football pitch and crashing to the ground. That was the moment I knew I was in for a good time.

Sure, Leo and Cora have to properly meet at a ball a few days later. And yeah, she has the funds to fix his crumbling estate and he has the title to raise her social standing so it’s all very basic Marriage of Convenience. But what I really loved was how these two approached the marriage as an actual agreement and even though they didn’t know each other, it was clear that they respected the other enough to be honest…about most things. (There still had to be a plot, after all.) When that mutual respect carried on into their marriage and burgeoning friendship to mutual attraction? Delicious.

I agree with other reviewers that the last 10% really picked up the pacing and felt like a mad-dash to the end, but it didn’t take away from my enjoyment of watching Leo and Cora fall for one another.

  
[Eliza and the Duke](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/219520711-eliza-and-the-duke)**: 2.5 Stars**

I originally dnf’ed this book at the 30% mark, and I sincerely wish I had left it to rot, but then we wouldn’t be here and I wouldn’t be able to steer you away from this book. Which I am. 

When one reads an author’s body of work in a little over two months, one can indeed point out their writing quirks. St. George loves: fantastic sex scenes, third-act conflicts wrapping up too quickly, and second book heroines that are much more naive than their older sister and the heroine of the previous book. 

The book opens with Eliza, this book’s heroine, trying to sneak into the Montague Club (this club is in ALL of the previous books so it makes sense she’s there but it’s very much a iykyk situation) from the backrooms where she sees a young man dressed in all black (me: oh?) covered in blood (me, again, thinking about Kaz Brekker: ooooooh?), and decides to follow him instead of getting the hell out there (me, no longer excited: oh). After helping the man, seeing some of the back of the club, and then coming to her senses, all Eliza knows is that he goes by the name The Duke, is bleeding because of prize fighting, and that she is fascinated by him.

As luck would have it, The Duke, aka Simon, not only works for the Montague Club but because of Third-Act Plot Reasons in the previous book, he has been tasked with providing security for the Dove sisters and their mother until Eliza’s brother-in-law deems it unnecessary. While this is all well and good and honestly a bit expected in Romance, it’s the way that Eliza’s entire purpose in life turns away from anything that isn’t Getting Time Alone With Simon. Simon, who does find Eliza very pretty and intriguing, but is just trying to do his job. 

I really liked Simon as a main character. This man was orphaned as a baby in Whitechapel, watched his sister die after childbirth, escaped the gang he had been working for, and keeps paying the ransom the gang leader, Brody, ‘requires’ to keep his niece safe. He is doing His Best and now he’s got an heiress demanding that he take her to Whitechapel or she’ll reveal that he’s fighting for previously mentioned gang leader in an effort to pay down said ransom/debt. Of the two MCs, Simon is clearly more developed, more complex, and someone I could root for. So it’s too bad that he gives into Eliza’s demands and takes her to Whitechapel for “one night of freedom.”

I’ll get back to this “one night of freedom” in the next paragraph, but Eliza as a character needs to be examined on its own. By the end of the last book, she had secured a betrothal from a titled peer (Earl, maybe? IDC enough to look it up) that she didn’t care about BUT she wanted her inheritance. Said Peer goes off to tour the content and so their betrothal is on hold while he’s away, but that gives Eliza time to properly examine the speed in which she had been sold to this stranger and so it makes sense that she wants one night for herself and to see a different part of London than she would ever again. But it’s how she goes about it, and the choice St. George makes to interweave this want with her attraction to Simon, that throws the (somewhat) rational adventure idea into pure stupidity. There is also a rashness to Eliza’s decisions from the moment she saw Simon bleeding in a back hallway that lack all common sense and throw the idea that Eliza was a logical young woman who grew up on just enough and who sought to attend college ut the window. It’s like the second she saw Simon, she became like the pampered heiresses she claims to have nothing in common with. 

Eliza, if that was true you would LEAVE THE HELP ALONE. I’m not saying be a demon who treats him like he’s beneath you, but let people do their jobs without sexually harassing them!! 

Okay. So this “one night of freedom” occurs and throughout the course of this adventure, a run in with Simon’s former gang, and a heart to heart at a coffee house, both of these fools believe themselves to be in love with the other. Here is also where you learn that Eliza is 19 and Simon is maaaaybe 23 (remember - orphaned as a baby) and the impulsivity of their actions make so much sense. Of course you think you love each other - your hormones are raging.

I understand that this is a Romance, and as a Romance Reader, I should want these two to live HEA etc., etc., but I didn’t. I don’t. And the remaining half of the book is full of more irrational choices and immature behavior including following the other London in a hansom cab, attempting to throw a fight to escape a gang leader, running away to Scotland but not for marriage purposes, a betrothal/rescue plan from the last Dove Sister (the heroine of Book 3), a murder plot, and love declarations. 

By the end of this book, I was flabbergasted. I can see the potential here - sincerely. But I have no idea how this plot with this lack of depth made it all the way to publication when nothing else from St. George via Berkley has been like this. And this isn’t a case of me thinking a book is going to be X when it’s really Y - I went in with no idea of what to expect other than the brief mention of Eliza refusing to marry the Peer which was mentioned at the end of Book 1. 

That .5 of a star is for the set-up of Book 3 which had me biting at the bars of my cage like that cat meme on most celebrity photoshoots. You know the one.

But the entire book was not worth reading for those few pages. 

  


**Final Thoughts**:

After ending my reviews on a rant, there is a bit more I have to say. 

I should start by saying that I don’t hold *Eliza and the Duke* against St. George, but I can hold the quality of 2025 HRs that major publishers have been releasing up to previous years and find them lacking. We all know tradpub is moving away from HR, and St George shared that she was one of the authors that wasn’t offered another contract *despite* her releases earning out and her earning royalties. This is a much larger topic, and one I know R/Romancelandia has discussed multiple times, so I have nothing to add to it here. But I can still boo Berkley for cutting St. George free. (I believe her last book under contract is Book 3 of The Doves of New York but I also have not been able to confirm that other than on Goodreads.)

I found the Dollar Princesses/American heiresses to be an area in HR that is woefully underrepresented (you should see my desperate searches for more once I finished all these), and as such St. George was able to tell pretty standard stories but with new breath in them. I also appreciated that her FMCs were not 21st Century women thrown into the past, but were strong in their own right and historical time but had feminist tendencies/opinions. Her MMCs were all ass over tits in their own ways for their heroines and really, that’s what I want to read. They’re supportive, fairly progressive in their views, whether before or after meeting/loving the Heroine, and had struggles of their own besides needing $$$ from the dowries.

St. George does have a few Harlequin series for those interested - one with Old West Outlaws (this one is not on GR as a series, so [here’s a link to the first one](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/28688473-the-innocent-and-the-outlaw?ac=1&from_search=true&qid=zuEDTC3XWG&rank=1)), another with [Vikings](https://www.goodreads.com/series/163887-viking-warriors), and an[ Old West series on KU](https://www.goodreads.com/series/183676-outlaws-of-the-wild-west)  she got the rights back to and has been polishing up, and a few one-off Viking romances. I have not had luck with the ones I’ve tried, but I wanted to make mention for those who enjoy a Harlequin (it’s generally not me, no matter the author). She also has [a CR series with boxer heroes she co-wrote](https://www.goodreads.com/series/196174-blood-and-glory) which I haven’t even looked into, but we’ll see how desperate I get for more of her work!!

Lastly, when I reached out to St. George to tell her how much I enjoyed her books (email your favorite authors! They love it!) and ask for recommendations, she suggested Johanna Shupe for more Gilded Age Romance, Adrienne Herrera for something outside of the norm in HR, and Mimi Matthews. 

And that’s a wrap on this IRAO! If you’ve read any of Harper St. George’s work, I would love to know if you have a favorite or if you know of any authors similar to her! ",14,1758219335.0,romancelandia,3,0.95,False

I'm 30, from Pakistan, and looking for friends. I work in tech (mostly work in US time zone) and am a workaholic. 

Love coffee. Easygoing. Can chat about work, life, or anything that keeps the conversation going. More of a call person (not sure if ageing does that to you). 

I'm currently watching Sneaky Pete and love it. I usually find time for during work breaks. 

Feel free to DM!

1nkfvlc,https://i.redd.it/biw2uipmsypf1.jpeg,AIO to my sister getting engaged to a guy she just met?,"So my (20f) sister (also 20f) met a guy (28m) on tinder about a month and a half ago and moved in with him after the first date. Which is like, kinda crazy but whatever. We are, or were, very close and lived together so it was a jump scare for her to just be gone. We didn’t hear much from her until about a month after she met this guy. She came home and told us they got a Guinea pig and that she was engaged! It’s been about 2 weeks and she’s gone radio silent. She reads our messages and sometimes replies with a couple words, but she’s basically ghosted us. 

We’ve never met the guy (he doesn’t really want to meet us according to her I guess) so we don’t know anything about him other then what she tells us and are completely lost as to what’s going on. She’s always had like, impeccably bad test in men. But this is out of the ordinary. 

We share a close friend group and one of our best friends came back to our city for a visit and she won’t see him at all and won’t interact in our group chat. Now not only is the family concerned but all our friends. 

What I know: 
- She’s never met his family; his family still lives in Bangladesh (we are in Canada) 
- He’s never met her family (obviously) 
- He only ever wears a mask and hat when leaving the house because he’s very shy apparently. 
- He doesn’t leave the house often. She says he works in crypto and is again very shy so doesn’t like to leave the apartment. 
- There are religious and cultural differences (we are Indigenous and not religious, he is Bangladeshi and comes from a religious family) 
- He wants to get married soon, she wants to wait a bit.
- He has nice skin (idk why this is a factor, but the only thing she ever says about him is “he has such nice skin!”) 
- He goes by multiple different names apparently? We don’t know his real one.
- They have not yet talked about kids, where they want to live long term, work aspirations, and general goals. She said she would bring those up eventually. 

Our mom’s heartbroken, she keeps asking to take her out to coffee to just catch up but she just leaves her on read. She sends me reels on Instagram but won’t have a conversation with me or our friends. 

We are just keeping her bed here and letting her know she can always come back if she needs. We don’t know what else to do. Are we over reacting? Are we under reacting? Should we just let her go and hope someday she talks to us again? Should we wait outside the apartment building just to lay eyes on her and know she’s alive? (My mom’s idea) 

I’m sad that I’ve lost my sister basically overnight. We used to have weekly game nights and just hang out together. Now she’s just, gone. Shes autistic and has always had trouble with communication but this is out of character. ",0,1758219285.0,AmIOverreacting,17,0.5,False
