## Key Features Analysis

The effectiveness of a charcoal water filter hinges on several key features that determine its filtration capacity, compatibility, and longevity.

**Material Composition:** The quality of the charcoal used in the filter is paramount. Premium filters typically utilize activated coconut shell charcoal,known for its high porosity and extraordinary ability to absorb impurities. This type of charcoal has a larger surface area than other types, allowing it to trap more contaminants.

A Filter using high-quality charcoal helps remove chlorine, odors, calcium, and other impurities from water before brewing, significantly improving the taste of the finished coffee. The housing material is also critically important; it should be BPA-free and food-grade to ensure safety and prevent leaching of harmful chemicals into the water.

**Filtration Capacity:** Filtration capacity refers to the amount of water a filter can effectively purify before needing replacement. This is usually measured in gallons or the number of brewing cycles. A higher capacity filter offers convenience and cost savings over time.

Look for filters with a capacity of at least 30 gallons or, in the case of filters marketed for Cuisinart machines, which target a 30-day lifespan. A filter effective even after extended use guarantees consistent water filtration and flavor.

**Compatibility:** Ensuring the filter is compatible with your specific Cuisinart coffee maker model is critical. Most aftermarket filters are designed to fit a wide range of Cuisinart models, but it is important to verify compatibility before purchasing.

Review the product description and compatibility chart provided by the manufacturer to confirm that the filter is designed to fit your machine. Choosing a filter specifically crafted for your Cuisinart ensures a secure fit and optimal performance.

**Filter Life Indicator:** Some higher-end Cuisinart coffee makers and compatible filters incorporate a filter life indicator.This feature alerts you to replace the filter after a certain period or number of uses, preventing the deterioration of water quality and ensuring optimal machine performance.

If your Cuisinart coffee maker has a filter life indicator,ensure the replacement filter is compatible with this feature. This indicator provides a valuable reminder to replace the filter, maintaining the highest water quality levels.

**Flow Rate:** A good charcoal water filter needs to have an excellent flow rate, which is notably important for drip coffee makers. if the flow rate isn't efficient, your coffee maker might take longer than usual to brew a pot.

The best charcoal filters will allow water to flow consistently and evenly,ensuring uniform saturation of the coffee grounds. This directly affects the brew strength and overall extraction.

**Certifications:** Look for certifications from reputable organizations, such as NSF International. These certifications indicate that the filter has been tested and meets specific safety and performance standards.

Certification offers assurance of the filter's quality and integrity, ensuring it effectively removes contaminants without adding harmful substances to the water.

Key features of charcoal water filters for Cuisinart coffee makers include:

*   Activated coconut shell charcoal
*   High filtration capacity
*   Model compatibility
*   Filter life indicator compatibility
*   Efficient Flow Rate
*   NSF Certification

## Core Benefits

Using a charcoal water filter in your Cuisinart coffee maker offers several core benefits that directly impact the taste, quality, and longevity of your coffee brewing experiance.

**Improved Coffee Taste:** The most obvious benefit is the improved taste of your coffee. Chlorine and other impurities in tap water can negatively affect coffee's flavor. Charcoal filters effectively remove these unwanted substances, resulting in a cleaner, smoother, and more flavorful cup of coffee.

A Filter helps to eliminate off-flavors, allowing the natural aromas and tastes of the coffee beans to shine through. This is particularly noticeable when using high-quality coffee beans, as the filter allows their subtle nuances to be fully appreciated.

**Extended Coffee Maker Lifespan:** Mineral buildup from hard water can damage your Cuisinart coffee maker over time,leading to reduced performance and eventual failure. Charcoal filters help prevent this buildup by removing calcium and other minerals from the water.

By using filtered water, you are protecting your coffee maker from scale buildup, which can clog internal components and reduce its efficiency. This extends the machine's lifespan and saves you money on repairs or replacements.

**Healthier Coffee:** Charcoal filters not only improve the taste of your coffee but also contribute to its overall healthiness. By removing chlorine and other contaminants, these filters reduce your exposure to perhaps harmful substances.

Drinking coffee made with filtered water ensures you are consuming a cleaner and purer beverage, free from unwanted chemicals and impurities. This can be particularly important for individuals concerned about their health and well-being.

**Reduced Maintenance:** By preventing mineral buildup, charcoal filters can significantly reduce the need for descaling your Cuisinart coffee maker. Descaling is a time-consuming and sometimes messy process.

Using a charcoal filter minimizes the frequency of descaling, saving you time and effort. It helps maintain the machine's cleanliness and keeps it running smoothly.

Core benefits of using charcoal water filters for Cuisinart coffee makers:

* Improved Coffee Taste
* Extended Coffee Maker Lifespan
* Healthier Coffee
* Reduced Maintenance

Turns out grinding yourself into the ground isn't success, it's stupidity.

At 23, I had the resume of someone twice my age. Top of my class, fast-tracked through promotions, working on projects people with decades of experience were jealous of. Everyone kept telling me I was killing it.

Funny thing about killing it - sometimes you're the one dying.

The hair loss started slowly. First just a few extra strands on my pillow. Then chunks in the shower drain. Then actual bald spots. At twenty fucking three. My barber asked if I was going through chemo.

But I kept pushing. That's what you do, right? Success requires sacrifice. Sleep is for the weak. Burnout is just an excuse. I lived on this toxic positivity that hard work cures everything. Feeling exhausted? Work harder. Body falling apart? That's just weakness leaving.

I was religious about discipline. Up at 5am every day. No social media. No Netflix. No fun, really. Just work. I thought I was better than everyone else because I was suffering more efficiently.

Then one morning I sat at my desk and couldn't remember why I was there. Not like forgot a meeting - I mean I couldn't remember why any of it mattered. My hands were shaking from my fourth coffee and it was only 9am. I looked at my reflection in my laptop screen and didn't recognize the person staring back.

That's when it hit me. I'd been so disciplined about achieving that I'd never asked what I was achieving FOR. I was climbing a ladder so fast I'd never looked where it led.

Took me months to unfuck my relationship with work. Had to rebuild from scratch. Started asking dangerous questions like ""what do I actually enjoy?"" and ""what would I do if nobody was watching?""

Here's what pisses people off when I say it: passion matters more than discipline.

Everyone wants to believe that pure willpower is enough. That you can hate what you do and still succeed through sheer grit. But that's how you end up bald at 23, staring at a laptop screen wondering where your life went.

When you actually give a shit about your work, discipline happens naturally. You don't need motivational quotes or productivity hacks. The work itself pulls you forward.

These days I still work hard, but it's different. I'm building things I care about. Actually ended up creating Dialed, an app that helps people reset their minds in moments of stress because I needed it myself back then. Funny how your biggest struggles become your best ideas.

My hair grew back, mostly. More importantly, I stopped measuring success by how much I was willing to suffer.

The real tragedy isn't that I pushed too hard at 23. It's that I thought pushing hard was the point. Success without purpose is just expensive failure.

1mot2y2,https://www.reddit.com/r/exorthodox/comments/1mot2y2/orthodox_extremism_fragmented_my_family_and_i/,Orthodox extremism fragmented my family and I resent this cult.,"My mother one day out of nowhere, as if she became possessed by something dark, became addicted to the Orthodox Church and has never been the same. It’s been 15 years. Shes a workaholic and only spends any free time she has at all going on pilgrimages to st Anthony’s monastery in Arizona. For 15 years. Doesn’t go for a walk on the beach or any kind of self care, no holidays, nothing at all. She ONLY spends every second of her free time at the monastery. A form of sacrifice… for what exactly ? She tried to get the entire family on the same page as her but every time she managed to drag us to this place, toxic events would ensue like clockwork. I consider myself deeply spiritual, yet I have never encountered any form of the divine in this place , even though I have been open to it. Time and time again. I’m still waiting. She became brainwashed by the apocalypse fear porn rampant within their cult and one day without having any discussion with the family at all, she decided to relocate everyone there. She has 5 dependents on her. Not a single discussion with anyone about this decision whatsoever. Everyone resents her and tries to spend as much time away as possible. Any sort of holiday she tries to only celebrate … at the monastery. Which is of interest to no one except her but she refuses to take part in any other activity. 

Since she relocated to this grim apocalypse waiting room , she still has to operate in the real world to sustain her family , but now she has doubled down on monastery attendance as you can imagine. She goes to the 3am liturgy most nights of the week after staying up until 1-2am working. After the liturgy is over … she goes back to work. REGULARLY. Since she began this toxic pattern, her cognitive functions have started to decline rapidly. She loses clients at work because she can’t operate in a functional way at her job anymore because of operating in perpetual exhaustion like this. 

We’ve tried to explain to her that she can either choose to live a monastic life or operate in the real world, that it’s not possible to do both. She refuses to accept this. 

The saddest part is that she does it all out of fear. Not love. 

I asked her what she feels attending these never ending liturgies … she can never answer the question. 

It’s as if she believes god will only “have mercy” on her soul based on a numbers game of how much one can attend church. 

Not a single real work or application in the real world. 

She and her comrades cannot make a single decision for their life without first consulting the geronda of the monastery. They won’t even take a shit on the toilet or purchase a coffee table before asking for his blessing. Yes it has really gotten this bad. 

She only accepts people as friends if they are orthodox and they are nearly always the worst people I have ever dealt with ever in my life. Without fail. 

The family has become fractured because she tries to pull everyone into monastic activities. Nobody wants to participate because it’s not a welcoming environment there. As a result everyone goes their own way. It’s sad. 

The fruits of this religion are otherwise not far from her or this behavior. 

I’ve had enough of anyone and everyone a part of this cult.

1mosyxv,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1mosyxv,Bialetti Brikka 4-cup Induction w/ E&B Competition (3-Cup) Results!,"Hey all, brand new Moka aficionado here! My wife loves coffee, and to her, finding a decent coffee bean with general grind and throwing it into a pour-over metal filter over some ice was the pinnacle of home-brewed iced coffee, but I thought she could do better.

I myself am normally partial to Korean instant coffee, or a nice latté if I do drink, but mostly stick with water.

So it's safe to say neither of us had any extensive knowledge of what constitutes a good coffee or extraction.

But since her birthday was coming up, I wanted to find a replacement that could be better than her pour-over, and landed on Moka pots. I'd seen one used only once before, as my old roommate had one, but never made a single cup prior to this.

So first things first, I did some research to figure out what good brands were and settled on Bialetti for my target price range. After some shopping around I landed on:

***Moka Pot:*** Brikka 4-Cup, Induction Version 

***Grinder:*** Roastmaster (Korean)

***Extras:*** 

* Bialetti 13cm Induction Plate 
* Aeropress 60mm filters 
* E&B Competition 3-cup Filter

We have a gas range at home, and lots of family and events, so these tools seemed to fit our situation the best. The extras I'd grabbed were based on recommendations from various YouTube coffee gurus talking about ways to improve the brew, and provided a few different preparation methods.

After 5 days of experimentation and Reddit scrolling, I found that there wasn't much data available on the Brikka 4-Cup induction or not, so I wanted to share my short journey and results! Spoiler alert: I think I've done it.

Note, my grinder has its own measurement for grind size in ""clicks"", correlating to the amount of clicks needed to dial in the grinder starting from fine (0) to course (24):

Espresso: 0-6 (Fine) 

Moka Pot: 7-10 (Medium-Fine) 

Pour Over: 11-17 (Medium-Course) 

French Press: 18-24 (Course)

OK, onto results!



***Day 1:***

This was mostly just breaking things in and getting everything ready for use, but actually got a decent cappuccino from my first brew. So first one was throwaway to get my 3 cups in. I actually got confused and used a course grind this day, but I still got really good results!

***Water:*** 180ml, \~60°C 

***Beans*****:** Local ""Roller"" Roast, 22g, Medium

***Grind:*** Pre-Ground, but ground again @ 15. 

***Filter:*** Stock Bialetti 

***Induction Plate:*** Not Used 

***Aeropress Filter:*** Not Used 

***Heat:*** Low-Medium, Direct Gas 

***Yield:*** \~150ml 

***Time-to-Spurt:*** \~3 minutes

The first throwaway batch, I actually had heat temp too high, and both coffee and steam VIOLENTLY shot out the valve and scared the heck outta me, so for actual drinkable first batch, I went way lower than I thought I should.

The first drinkable batch started spurting steam mid brew, so I was concerned it'd be too bitter, but it actually came out decent. Full-bodied, and naturally a bit bitter, my wife likes more sharp tasting coffee, usually just drinks black or ""Americano"" style, which is just watered down black. No sourness whatsoever, so extraction went well, no burn taste, even though it was at a rolling boil for a moment before I removed from heat. Since it was in a cappuccino, the milk reduced a lot of the harshness and was a very mellow drink. But I wanted to get the expected ""smooth"" flow and crema that was supposed to come from the Brikka, but couldn't capture it this round. Had to remove and reinsert into flame to get full yield, but all in all good first run.



***Day 2:***

This day, wanted to show wifey how to use it, but she got overwhelmed by exact measurements so I went a much more general route, and the results showed. Very, VERY bitter and yielded a bit more but not very nice.

***Water:*** 200ml, Cold 

***Beans*****:** Local Roast, 20g, Medium, Bitter Bias 

***Grind:*** Pre-Ground, but ground again @ 9. 

***Filter:*** Stock Bialetti 

***Induction Plate:*** Used 

***Aeropress Filter:*** Not Used 

***Heat:*** Low, Gas to Induction 

***Yield:*** \~160ml 

***Time-to-Spurt:*** \~1 minutes

Very sharp, very harsh taste, lots of steam and that could've been for so many reasons, but this batch came out very VERY bitter.



***Day 3:***

Rolled back some changes, but tried a new bean!

***Water:*** 180ml, \~60°C 

***Beans*****:** Cafe Olé (H-E-B) Texas Pecan 22g, Medium

***Grind:*** Pre-Ground, ground again @ 0, then 8. 

***Filter:*** Stock Bialetti 

***Induction Plate:*** Used 

***Aeropress Filter:*** Not Used 

***Heat:*** Low, Gas to Induction 

***Yield:*** \~140ml 

***Time-to-Spurt:*** \~2 minutes

This gave me really good results! Full-bodied taste, no graininess, however yield was a bit lower due to me accidentally starting grind at 0 for maybe 1-2g, then correcting to 8. The unevenness of the grind and fine particles potentially soaking up water and clogging most likely contributed to the yield loss.



***Day 4:***

Sorted out grind size, and got great results!

**Water:** 180ml, \~60°C 

***Beans*****:** Cafe Olé (H-E-B) Texas Pecan 22g, Medium, Soft, Hazelnutty 

***Grind:*** Pre-Ground, but ground again @ 9. 

***Main Filter:*** Stock Bialetti 

***Induction Plate:*** Used 

***Aeropress Filter:*** Not Used 

***Heat:*** Low, Gas to Induction 

***Yield:*** \~120ml 

***Time-to-Spurt:*** \~2 minutes

This gave me really good results! Best taste that I'd had thus far, maybe partially due to the more mellow bean and lower heat temp. But felt I could get it even better, though this was a great batch. Timing wise though, again, had sputtering mid-brew, and yield was super low so I thought it might be a heating issue. The body is 4-cup, so it needs a bit more heat to get a consistent flow.



***Day 5:***

AYOOOOOO, DO I LIKE COFFEE NOW?

***Water****:* 180ml, \~60°C 

***Beans*****:** Gute Leute Normal Roast 22g, Medium 

***Grind:*** Ground @ 10. 

***Main Filter:*** E&B Competition Filter 

***Induction Plate:*** Used 

***Aeropress Filter:*** Not Used 

***Heat:*** Low-Medium, Gas to Induction 

***Yield:*** \~150ml 

***Time-to-Spurt:*** \~2.5 minutes

I just had this this morning, and HOOO boy, was this it. Firstly, swapped out the stock filter for the E&B 3-Cup Competition Filter. The filter size itself is the same, but the outer diameter and included gasket are smaller than needed for the 4-cup, so I used both the original gasket and the included E&B gasket to buffer the space. I was concerned that the extra height wouldn't allow for it to shut and seal properly, but no leaks, proper seal, just requires a bit more tightening than I normally had to with the stock filter. No leaks, no pressure drops so far. We'll see how it performs over time. I included some pictures so you can see how it looks. Definitely looks dodgy lol but seals like the best of them! Doesn't move or shift or pop out of place at all, just higher than you'd expect.

And starting with full coffee beans finally gave me the chance to get the proper grind settings locked in. Bean taste is also inherently fresher since it's fresh bough and ground.

So started batch with medium heat and let more pressure build up, then cut off heat as soon as coffee came out since I'm using the induction plate to carry it all the way through. This time, sputtering didn't come until the very end, which was perfect! I'm assuming the filter switch, grind update and heat switch fixed that issue!

**Bonus: I got crema!!**

Taste wise: Most balanced and complex taste I've extracted to date, for several reasons, but all elements at play here produced an amazing cup of stovetop espresso and an iced latté! Espresso taste really captured the full notes of the beans, and the latté gave me a perfect blend between lightness and body!

Also interesting note, the water below was the least muddied it's been thus far.

I haven't yet tried the Aeropress filters in conjunction with either the standard or competition filter, but I have a feeling I won't need it!

So final recommendations for Brikka 4-cup:

* Definitely lock in the right grind size, and fill up the basket as full as you can without tamping!
* Definitely upgrade to competition filter!!
* Definitely give the Brikka a bit more heat to account for the pressure valve!
* Use pre-warmed water (60°-70°) to reduce time!
* Use an induction plate if you want more consistent heating control!

Marty and I are roommates and we’ve known each other since we were toddlers. We’re always playing video games and drinking soda together, so I wanted to do something special. I got us 2 tickets to the opening night of this new horror movie we’ve been talking about. 

When I gave them to Marty, this man says he can’t go because he got tickets for some chick flick. And not even the good kind! I saw the preview. They're just gonna sit around talking about their feelings, fully clothed. 

Turns out he actually got them for him and Maggie (23F, fake name). Maggie is a barista at a coffee shop we’re regulars at. Marty has the biggest crush on Maggie but can never seem to make a move, though Marty said he was “finally gonna ask her out.” with the tickets.

When Maggie came to our table, the ONLY thing he could say was “Um, I was wondering, uh, would you, uh, like to, uh, you know, uh...” and I’m NOT exaggerating. I was still annoyed with Marty flaking on me with the movie, so I butted in the conversation and said “You’ll have to excuse Marty. He has a hard time ‘espresso’ himself.” Maggie laughed at my joke, and Marty immediately gets jealous but won’t admit it. Maggie leaves and he tells me to stay out of his way when we see her next.

We go to Maggie’s house later to help her move, and I’m cracking jokes the whole time making her laugh again. Marty pulls me aside and tells me to stop ruining his chances. I tell him that he can’t even make a move on her, and he’s just jealous that I can talk to chicks and he can’t. So Marty tries asking Maggie out again, but fails epically. 

Finally, I’m like, “Maggie, wanna see something cool?” I take out my movie tickets and I ask Maggie out right then and there. And she says yes. She even invites Marty, but I only have two tickets. So obviously, it’s me and her.

Now this man has been acting salty all day, saying I “ruined his chances.”But he had multiple opportunities to ask her out and didn’t. He wants me to cancel with her so he can try again, but that would be rude to Maggie, and I don’t want to be rude to the ladies.

Like I said before, he’s jealous that I can talk to women and he can’t. I just wanted to see a movie with my bro, who flaked on me, for some girl who doesn’t even know he exists! I only have 20 minutes until my date, and I know exactly how it’s gonna go down.

You know, the kind of thing influencers hype up but you never really know if it’s actually doing anything.

But earlier this year, my digestion was a mess. I was bloated *all the time* (like, uncomfortable jeans and avoiding fitted dresses kind of bloated), my energy was tanking by 3pm, and honestly… I wasn’t getting enough veggies in my diet. Between work, commuting, and random life chaos, my “greens” were usually a sad piece of lettuce in a sandwich.

One night I went down a rabbit hole about gut health, digestive enzymes, and all that jazz. That’s when I stumbled on [Soluxe Superfood Greens.](https://soluxeshop.com/products/soluxe-superfood-greens) The first thing that caught my eye was that it had *actual* superfoods (wheatgrass, barleygrass, alfalfa, kiwi, apple) plus **17 digestive enzymes,** not just a scoop of green-tasting powder.

I figured, why not? Worst case, it tastes gross and I go back to drinking coffee and complaining about my stomach.

**The first week:**  
I started drinking it in the mornings, just mixed with cold water. It’s not sweet (no artificial stuff), but light and refreshing - kind of like earthy green apple. By day 3, I noticed something strange… I wasn’t as bloated after lunch. Usually after pasta I’d feel huge, but this time, nope.

**By week 2:**

* Bloating was way less
* Bathroom schedule = normal again (you know what I mean)
* No more 3pm energy crash

I also learned greens powders aren’t a veggie replacement, but for busy days, this is a total lifesaver.

**Why I’m still taking it:**

* No junk - no fillers, sweeteners, or weird additives
* The digestive enzymes actually help
* Super clear ingredient list
* Takes 30 seconds to make, no blender

If you’re in Malaysia and want something clean and effective, I’d say try **Soluxe Superfood Greens**. Not magic, but it’s been a game changer for my digestion and bloating.

I'm a 37-year-old Italian woman who's lived in Los Angeles for almost eight years. I'd love to find someone older and more mature to connect with and share my thoughts and dreams.

I moved to Los Angeles from Rome partly for work (I own a OnePlus studio and have a deep love for art and design), and partly for the sunshine and diverse culture here. After all, sipping a hot coffee on a rainy day while admiring ancient architecture in Rome is a completely different experience than skateboarding through Venice Beach in the LA sun.

My weekend activities are quite varied: I go to the Huntington Library to look at plants (I'll tell you the bamboo forest there reminds me of the scenery I saw at my grandmother's house in Tuscany as a child), bake pizza at home (San Marzano tomatoes are a must for Margherita pizza!), and occasionally go to a quirky livehouse in Silver Lake with friends to listen to jazz. Oh, by the way, I've been learning yoga lately and am currently working on planks, which I think is worth the price of admission.

I've met so many lovely people since coming to LA, but I always feel like I could find more people to talk to. Whether we want to rant about LA traffic, share hidden gems, or just chat about cultural differences (like, I still don't understand why Americans serve ranch sauce on pizza, haha), everyone's welcome!

Age and background don't matter; just be genuine and share your life. If you're looking for someone who can make pasta and occasionally burst with Italian humor, feel free to reach out!

NAME: Glendronach Cask Bottling - Distilled 17/Sep/2008 Bottled 30/Jan/2020 - 11 Years in Oloroso Puncheon Cask - Selected by K&L Wine - 60.1% ABV

Neck pour went into a 2oz bottle. This is the first pour. About 1oz. Rested 10 minutes.

COLOR: Copper / Dark Gold

NOSE: Honey, Plums, Cherries, Raisins

TASTE: More Honey, Lots of Raisins & Cherries, Prunes, and heavy Sherry sweetness. Some coffee sneaks up, similar to Glenmorangie Signet Reserve. High ABV is strongly felt. Doesn't feel young at all.

AFTERTASTE: Here it gets more interesting, the cherries and coffee are gone, the Raisins and Prunes come forth stronger, and a somewhat-oily sweetness remains, like a mixture of grape juice and honey. The high ABV is felt.

OVERALL: Phenomenal. I don't know how to score between 8.7523 and 9.7523 on a 1to10 scale, but definitely very high up there. Would buy another bottle if found... but this one will probably last a while, since the sips have to be taken slowly.

P.S.: If I were to advise Macallan, I would tell them to take this (and some CS sherried Glenfarclas) as an example how a Phenomenal Sherried Whisky should taste.",2,1755052420.0,Scotch,1,0.75,False

This improved efficiency also translates to faster charging speeds and a longer lifespan for the charger. Furthermore, GaN chargers are generally more durable and resistant to wear and tear, making them ideal for travel and everyday use.**Multiple Charging Ports:**

A significant feature found in some 45 Watt USB C chargers is the inclusion of multiple charging ports. Frequently enough, this includes a USB C port capable of delivering the full 45 watts, along with a USB A port for charging older devices or accessories. The power distribution is then intelligently managed to ensure that each connected device receives the optimal charging current. This makes these chargers incredibly versatile, allowing you to concurrently charge your laptop, phone, and other devices without sacrificing charging speed.

**Comprehensive Safety Protections:**

Modern 45 Watt USB C chargers integrate multiple layers of safety protections to safeguard both the charger and the connected devices. These protections typically include over-voltage protection (OVP), over-current protection (OCP), over-temperature protection (OTP), and short-circuit protection (SCP). These safeguards actively monitor the charging process and automatically cut off the power supply in the event of any anomalies, preventing potential damage from power surges, overheating, or other electrical faults. Having these safety features provides peace of mind, knowing your devices are charged safely.

**Foldable Plug Design:**

Portability is a key consideration for many users, and a foldable plug design is an important feature for enhancing the charger's portability. This allows the prongs of the charger to fold flat against the body, making it more compact and easier to store in a bag or pocket. It also reduces the risk of damaging other items in your bag by preventing the prongs from scratching or puncturing them. This simple yet effective design significantly improves the user experience for those who frequently travel or need to carry their charger with them on the go.

I need some suggestions on what I can do/eat to get more energy before my evening workout. I am on a low calorie diet and I’ve been working out 5 days a week for 3 months. My metabolism has kicked up a notch because after eating, I’m really hungry not too long after. So I’ve been trying to stretch my 1200 calories out so that I don’t get too hungry during the day. This includes a small snack before my workout. Where it does help with the hunger, I have zero energy and my workouts sometimes suck! I can’t get motivated or keep going at the same pace. 

I can’t workout in the morning after breakfast and coffee because I have to go straight to work, kid stuff etc. I don’t want to drink low calorie energy drinks, and I also want to keep my calories in line. I take regular vitamins, drink/eat protein with a balance of carbs and fiber and plenty of water. What can I do that will give me some energy pre-workout, that’s still low calorie?

I gained almost 8.5kg in 90 days (about 12kg in ~9m) and I knew it wasn’t fat as even on OMAD I was leaving half my dinner uneaten. Half my family was away for a week and this made it easier.

Within 24hrs, my fave suit jacket was comfortable in the arms again. I have lost 5.3kg (11.7lb), 9cm off my waist, 4cm off my hips and 2cm off my chest. I still have water weight to go, my belly still has clear inflammation. For the “it’s just water weight” people - yes I KNOW, that’s literally the point of my fast.

I started at 87.2kg, currently 81.9. F46, menopausal, 166cm.

I am not hungry, not even a little bit, although that may change when my family returns and we go back to proper dinners. 

My main unpleasant symptoms right now are noodly limbs (I think maybe not enough potassium, my shops didn’t have lite salt, tracking some down today), and some miserable heartburn that started yesterday, I did acv, then electrolytes, but didn’t get relief until I tried 3tsp of plain coconut yoghurt.

I haven’t had the magic pain reduction this time, or the incredible mental clarity, but I certainly don’t feel worse than when I started.

My plan was 10days with a stretch of 14, I have an event on 23rd and I want to give myself ~3 days to ease back into food.

She’s never been the type to chase the spotlight. Red carpets, curated stories, flashing cameras—none of that was ever her. She’s the girl behind the scenes: the one who brings him coffee after eighteen-hour days in the studio, the one who tucks love notes into his bags before he flies across the world, the one who stays silent when the tabloids pair him with someone else yet again. She’s known him longer than the world has—before the fame, the tours, the ego. And somewhere along the way, she fell in love with the boy he used to be when no one else was watching.

But somewhere along the way, she became invisible.

The story begins on her birthday—a regular Tuesday for him. She doesn’t expect much; she never has. Just a few hours, maybe a walk, maybe a movie on the couch like they used to do before his phone never stopped buzzing. She doesn’t say it outright. She never demands. She just smiles, quiet as ever, and suggests, *“Maybe when you’re done at the studio… we could just do something. Anything, really.”* But he brushes her off, distracted, already halfway out the door.

She doesn’t cry—not at first. She just sits in the quiet, one hand resting on her belly—a new secret, just starting to show. A life growing inside her. His child. And she wonders if he’ll even notice when she’s gone. Because she’s not angry—just tired. Tired of being a second thought in a world she never wanted to compete with. Tired of giving everything and getting almost nothing in return.

**Chapter 1 – Thirty Seconds Dead**  
The fluorescent tubes above me hummed like a swarm of bees.  
Harsh, cold light stripped every color from the world.  
The smell of disinfectant burned in my nose, sharp as chlorine.

I lay on a narrow gurney, the metal beneath me so unyielding I could feel the pressure all the way into my bones.  
My hands rested on my chest, as if I had to hold myself together so I wouldn’t fall apart.

To my left, a monitor beeped in an uneven rhythm—a nervous heartbeat rendered in machine tones.

I knew I was about to die.  
For thirty seconds.  
That’s what they’d told me.

“Everything under control, Mr. Keller,” the doctor said. Her voice was routine, almost too friendly.  
I nodded, but couldn’t take my eyes off the long, clear IV line that ran from the drip on the wall to my hand.  
The tube gleamed under the light, and I imagined how, in a few minutes, something would flow through it that would bring my heart to a standstill.

And then?  
Nothing.  
Or… maybe Anna.

I squeezed my eyes shut, and instantly she was there—  
Her laughter, bright and warm.  
The scent of her shampoo—lavender with a hint of lemon.  
Standing barefoot in the kitchen on a Sunday morning, hair uncombed, coffee mug cupped in both hands.

It had been two years, but in that moment, it was as if she stood right beside me.  
A car accident.  
A drunk driver.  
A phone call in the middle of the night.

Since then, I’d kept going, but it was only… functioning.  
Delivering letters. Eating when I was hungry. Sleeping when I could.  
No family. No children. No purpose.

When I saw the ad in the paper, it was like a jolt of cold electricity:  
*Volunteers wanted – medical study: controlled cardiac arrest. Duration: 30 seconds. Purpose: research near-death experiences.*

I hadn’t thought long about it.  
Not because of the money.  
But because there was this chance—crazy, absurd—that I might see her one more time.

“Ready?” the doctor asked.  
I nodded.  
My throat was dry.

A nurse stepped up beside me, checking the electrodes on my chest.  
His face was expressionless, like a mask.  
“Don’t move, please.”

I felt something cold creep into my hand.  
The fluid.  
A burning sting in the vein, spreading through my arm like an intruder.

My heartbeat quickened, the monitor beeping faster.  
I could hear my own breath in my ears—short, quick.

Then came the fear.  
Real fear.

Not the diffuse life-fear I’d carried since Anna’s death.  
But pure, cold panic.  
What if they couldn’t bring me back?  
What if there was nothing?  
What if I just fell into a black hole and never came out?

“Relax, Mr. Keller,” the doctor said, as if that were an option.

**Chapter 2 – Anna**  
The chill of the gurney seeped into my back, but that wasn’t what stole my breath.  
It was the thought that this moment—this sterile, glaring here and now—might be the last thing I ever experienced in this world.

My eyes settled on a water bottle on the side table.  
The label was half peeled off, the plastic surface crumpled.  
Such a trivial detail, and yet it hurt to look at.

I remembered how Anna used to crush bottles like that with one hand when they were empty—always smiling, saying it sounded like a tiny firework.

Lavender.  
Lemon zest.  
The scent of her shampoo was so deep inside me, I swore I could smell it even here—though that was impossible.

I was back in our kitchen.  
Sunday morning. Sunlight slanted through the window, catching the steam rising from her mug.  
She stood barefoot on the cold tiles, wearing one of my shirts, the hem brushing her thighs.  
Her hair was a mess, her eyes half-closed.  
She grinned at me without saying a word—and that grin had always felt like a conspiracy, as if she were making me a promise only we understood.

Two years.  
Two years since a drunk driver hit her.  
Two years since my phone rang at 11:14 p.m.

I’d been in bed reading.  
When I saw the hospital’s number, I knew.  
Before the doctor’s voice even spoke, I knew my world had shattered.

“I’m sorry…”  
That was all it took.  
The rest was just noise.

Since then, every day had been a photocopy of the last:  
Get up. Deliver mail. Eat. Wait for night.  
I’d tried to get used to the idea that there was no reason to open my eyes in the morning.

And then… that ad.

Controlled cardiac arrest—thirty seconds of death.  
For anyone else, it was just a bizarre medical experiment.  
For me, it was a doorway.  
Maybe into madness.  
Maybe to her.

“Mr. Keller?” The doctor’s voice pulled me back.  
I blinked, and the kitchen, the warm sunlight, Anna’s bare feet on the tiles—they were gone.  
Only the cold neon light and sterile air of the lab remained.

“We’re starting now.”

**Chapter 3 – The Stillness**  
“We’ll begin with the sedation.”  
The doctor stepped closer, her gaze calm, almost gentle, as if this were as routine as changing a bandage.

I tried to focus on her voice, but every word seemed overlaid with other sounds:  
The steady beep of the monitor.  
The low hum of the air conditioner.  
The faint creak of the leather strap as the nurse checked my IV line.

The smell of disinfectant hung like an invisible wall between me and the rest of the world.  
It burned faintly in my nose, mixing with the damp, metallic scent of my own skin under the slowly warming electrodes.

“Take a deep breath,” the nurse on my left said.  
I obeyed, but my chest felt as if a brick were resting on it.

The doctor held the syringe up, the light bending through the clear liquid.  
“First you’ll get sleepy. Then… it will be still. That’s normal.”

The word *still* hit me like a blow.  
I’d spent so many nights in that eerie, living stillness—the kind that isn’t empty, but full of thoughts you don’t want to think.  
And now, that stillness was going to swallow me whole.

The first drop of liquid traveled down the line.  
I didn’t feel it right away, but I knew it was coming.  
My eyes locked on the point where the needle met my skin—that tiny spot where my body no longer belonged entirely to me.

“Everything under control, Mr. Keller,” the doctor repeated.  
I nodded, flinching slightly as the first cool shiver crept up my arm.

The tingling spread—first to my forearm, then my shoulder.  
My fingers felt foreign, no longer obeying my commands.

The beeping of the monitor changed.  
Barely perceptible, but I heard it.  
Faster. Less regular.

My gaze slid to the door.  
A stupid instinct—as if I could just get up, walk out, and forget the whole thing.  
But my legs lay still under the thin blanket, heavy as lead.

A bead of sweat traced down my neck.  
I thought of Anna, how she sometimes woke in the middle of a warm night, resting her hand on my chest to feel my heartbeat.  
“Just to make sure you’re still there,” she’d smiled once.

Now, she’d never be able to know.

The doctor glanced at the monitor, then at me.  
“It will happen very quickly now. You’ll—”

The rest of her sentence dissolved into a dull rumble in my ears.  
The world began to close in, as though an invisible frame was tightening around my vision.  
Voices dropped in pitch, distorted.

One last thought flashed through me: *Please, let me find her.*

Then—no light. No sound.  
Just one beat.  
And silence.

**Chapter 4 – The Threshold**  
It wasn’t like I’d imagined.  
No sudden jolt, no sensation of losing the ground beneath my feet.  
More like a slow draining.  
Like water seeping from a crack until nothing remains.

At first, there was only darkness.  
Not the darkness of a room at night—this had weight.  
It draped over me, gripped me like a hand that wouldn’t let go.

I wanted to breathe, but the air was thick, as if it were made of something viscous.  
Each breath grew shorter until I stopped trying—  
And realized I didn’t need to.

A dull thud.  
Pause.  
Another.  
Like the far-off echo of a hammer striking wet stone.

It took me a moment to understand—  
That was my heart.  
Or maybe just the memory of it.

The darkness around me began to change.  
Not brightening—growing denser.  
Like smoke thickening until it takes on shape.  
Currents of shadow that moved like water, but flowed sideways, obeying laws I didn’t know.

And between them—color.  
First a pale red, like the ember of a cigarette in the dark.  
Then deeper, pulsing scarlet, threading through the black like veins.

I didn’t know if I was seeing or hearing it.  
Each shift in color came with a sound—sometimes a whisper, sometimes a deep, slow rumble.

Then came the pull.  
It was as if something unseen tugged at my awareness.  
Not violently—more like a child drawing a toy on a string.  
Slow, but inevitable.

I drifted.  
Not down, not up—just away from everything I knew.

When the ground appeared beneath my feet, it was already there, as though it had been waiting the whole time.  
Rough. Cracked. Jagged.  
Like cooled lava with tiny, glittering shards of frozen light hidden inside.

I lifted my head—and the world opened up.

The “sky” was false—a heavy mass of blood-red clouds moving so slowly you only noticed if you looked away for a while.  
Thin fractures split the ceiling here and there, dripping something molten into the distance—metal that never cooled.

The air was warm, tasted of iron.  
Every breath left a film on my tongue, like licking a battery.

Sounds drifted from far away.  
Sometimes like waves breaking on rocks.  
Sometimes like voices—too faint to form words, but too clear to be wind.

Something shifted at the edge of my vision.  
Large. Slow.  
A shadow whose shape was wrong—too many limbs bending at angles that shouldn’t exist.  
I forced myself not to look.

“Anna?”  
My voice was barely more than a croak.  
It didn’t echo—it was swallowed.

Silence.  
Then… a whisper.  
So soft it felt more in my head than in my ears:  
*Come…*

It was neither male nor female, but warm.  
A tone that didn’t push, only invited.  
Like a hand reaching out to you.

I felt my feet move on their own.  
Ahead, a break opened in the cracked landscape—a path of dark, dull ash curving out of sight.  
On either side, jagged rocks jutted upward, fumes leaking from their fractures with the smell of burnt resin.

And with every step, the whisper grew clearer.  
Not louder—just closer.  
*Come… I’m waiting…*

I noticed so many people talk about vegetables but she won't notice any issues with beans. How do you really log your triggers? Would it be the cramping primarily? We've talked about how to help her eat and not avoid eating such as some rice and bananas or a protein shake. I am just trying to to understand a little bit better how to help her track some of her triggers. She already told me she gave up coffee and juice.

1mos55l,https://www.reddit.com/r/CasualConversation/comments/1mos55l/mayonnaise/,Mayonnaise,"We didn’t have mayonnaise growing up.

We didn’t have mayonnaise in the house because we didn’t buy mayonnaise. Mayonnaise was a luxury where I come from (about 25 years ago-ish). I remember it being pricey. This was a time when we were importing mayonnaise, and I don’t remember seeing any local brands at the store. And if we’d have mayonnaise, it’s probably because we got it from someone overseas.

Anyway why am I thinking about mayonnaise?

Today, around 3pm, when I was at the office, I realized I hadn’t eaten anything since last night. I’d been running on two coffees and no water. I meant to get something, but I was in a different headspace.

Fast forward to 6:45pm (that’s when I looked at the time and had this great thought): I decided to finally eat. We have five pre-cooked meals left, and they’ve all expired. One of the best-before dates was yesterday, so I figured that was probably the safest thing I could eat. And it happens to be pasta.

I don’t like pasta. If you like pasta, don't take it personally; it's just not my type. And after 12 hours of not eating, pasta would not be the first thing I’d go for. I thought, if push comes to shove, I have mayonnaise. Because I’m already throwing away a lot of food, and I feel horrible about it. I cannot waste any more just because I don’t like the taste of pasta. So I’m going to have it with mayonnaise, because mayonnaise can make anything better. (I think I like Hellmann’s)

This was years ago now, but I don't want to get too specific on the off chance anyone is able to identify either party. As far as I know, nobody is aware that this ever happened aside from the two of us and therapists I've told.

I met this lady kind of at random. Not at any social function, job, class, etc. Just on the subway during my normal commute to university. We started chatting about something the first time, I don't even remember what. Just small talk. And then we started to notice each other more on future commutes. Turns out our schedules line up very closely and we'd probably shared a ride numerous times before that first interaction, and from there we just kept talking on the commutes.

It was kind of unusual in retrospect. I was a 20 year old introverted college kid and she was a 39 year old woman with a career and family. Yet it felt like we had a lot in common. Eventually we decided to meet for coffee and discuss a book we were both reading (I believe it was ""I'll be Gone in the Dark"" by Michelle McNamara), and that pretty rapidly escalated into a pretty heated sexual affair. I was a virgin at this point, which I admitted to her, but it didn't bother her. We started slow, mostly meeting at her condo while her husband and kids were away. But once I got more experienced, it was every chance we got. We'd meet early at the subway station and have sex in a bathroom before the commute if we had to.

It went on like that for probably 6 months, but it felt like much longer. Eventually it just kind of ended. I don't know if she got bored or was guilty about cheating on her husband. I didn't really get an explanation, and it's kind of bothered me over the years. I missed her for a long time. Developed a thing for older women that never really went away, though I've dated a few girls my age.

Anyway, feels good to admit this outside of therapy! I haven't even told any of my friends or past girlfriends tbh.",0,1755051047.0,TrueOffMyChest,22,0.5,False
1mos3gy,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1mos3gy,Got 17 Decants from Decantbox! lol this is my review.,"First time ordering. Within 2 days of ordering the package was shipped! Finally got them in and it took me about 2 days to sample them lol this is my honest review of these 17 fragrances.



Black origami - 9/10 initial spray is very interesting, the truffle gives it a unique note that I can see why some hate it or love it, mostly hate it lol the dry down, omg is nice. I get vanilla and chocolate. I love it, sprayed on my skin and about 5 hours later it’s still present



Vulcan Fue- 8/10 definitely get the mango at the beginning, I feel it’s a bit stronger at first than like mango ice but performance wise I’m still leaving to mango ice. Several hours later I still faintly smell it. I feel mango ice performs better on my skin and this. I still love it.



Sceptre Malachite- 7/10 compared this with Vulcan fue and the same time. Definitely get the mango notes. Not a bad clone but it’s not as strong and longevity was a bit low. Overall it’s definitely something I would get as I love mango ice and this is one I would spray a lot of to preserve my mango ice bottle lol 



Untold- 5/10 got this because people online hype this to the moon. I am a bit disappointed. All I get is very synthetic roses, even on the dry down I get the same notes. Don’t see the hype around this, definitely not for me and I would probably skip this unless I got a big deal on it.



Champion Sugar - 6/10 definitely smelt the pepper, apple, then mostly floral. Not a bad sent, smells clean. Not a scent I see myself wearing often though.



Champion Money- 8/10 this one I really like. I get the citrus, the lavender and vanilla. Definitely a scent I would wear often.



Hawas Ice- 9/10 this one lived up to the hype. Similar to Hawas but it feels more complete to me lol definitely get the citrus and plum, the musk. I can see myself wearing this daily.



Hawas Tropical- 8/10 smells very tropical lol definitely get coconut, smells sweet to me, like pineapple, I get the sandalwood and musk. Something I will definitely wear in the summer. Seemed a bit weak



Hawas for her- 4/10 got some pomegranate and apple on the opening and then it just became very floral. I don’t think my gf would like this as it kinda smells like fabric softener lol the dry down with the praline does not work for me. Smell is very odd lol



Spectre Ghost- 3/10 another let down, really wanted to love this because it has an amazing bottle lol the notes do not work for me. Idk if it’s the cardamom or the blackcurrant but the scent is not pleasant to my nose 😔 smelt a lot of coffee which is weird since it’s not in it lol but even as it dries down the scent profile of this fragrance does not get better for me.



Jean Lowe Immortal- 7/10 I see this one receive so much praise online. It’s very citrusy to me. I’m not a huge fan of citrus scents. I do see a base note being amber so I imagine it’ll get a vanilla type scent eventually? Not sure. Unless it does, I don’t really see myself getting this anytime soon or wearing it often. 



Jean Lowe Vibe- 7/10 definitely smell the lemon at the beginning lol it was strong. As it drys down it smells not that far off from immortal to me except with a more pronounced citrus note.

 

Turathi Electric- 8/10 curious to smell this as it’s another one I see spoken of quite often. another citrusy smell but not overwhelming like some of the others. I get whiffs of pear in the opening, the musk and vanilla are very subtle. I could see myself wearing this one often. 



Rayhaan Pacific- 8/10 this one I get citrus, orange, lavender. Initial spray is strong and drys down very sweet. This will make me change my mind about citrusy smells lol



Liquid Brun-  8/10 very woody, very sweet. I get the musk, the vanilla on the dry down. I love this, definitely something I would wear often! 



Afnan Rare Reef- 7/10 very similar to pacific. Honestly hard for me to tell them apart. I will say this smells a bit stronger than pacific though. Pacific has a smoother dry down though.

1mos1f3,https://www.reddit.com/r/OlympicNationalPark/comments/1mos1f3/trip_report_july_26august_1/,Trip report - July 26-August 1,"Thanks to so many here who post and share their experiences. Here's our recap:  
Flew into Seattle late, drove to Tacoma for the night. Stayed in the Fairfield Inn. It was nice and had breakfast.

* **Day 1:** Drove to Port Angeles. Did Hurricane Ridge, Hiked Hurricane Hill. Do this! I didn't expect to love it as much as I did. It wasn't the easiest hike in places for me (steep), but it's all paved, and the views and feeling of accomplishment were amazing. We were able to drive and park close to the trailhead, which was great. I know the cougar attack is scary, but it's a busy trail with people always around, and it was not worrisome. Drove to Sequim and stayed in the Holiday Inn Express. Great decision. It's not that far from PA, and while a bit pricey, it was modern and clean. Walked Dungeness National Wildlife Preserve, which is worth it. Dinner at Oasis for a good burger.
* **Day 2**: Breakfast at the hotel the next morning. Stopped at Walmart and got some supplies. Drove to Forks along Lake Crescent. Gorgeous. Did Sol Duc Falls - great hike and beautiful. Went into Forks. Did the Twilight free tour. Ha (Not much else there) and got coffee at the Outfitter. Checked into Quilloyate River Resort. It's magical. I highly recommend it if you can get a room.  Stopped at LaPush. I'm not sure if we didn't go to the right place, but it was underwhelming.  Dinner at Three Rivers Resort - burgers and shakes, etc. Decent, but I'm sure there are better places.

\*Note - Forks has very little. A few shops, the tour, and a few restaurants. No offense, but it's not pretty or quaint, so I was glad we were staying out a bit at the resort we did, which was so scenic, on the river. It did require a bit more driving, but to me it was well worth it. Trust me. It's awesome.

* **Day 3** \- Rialto Beach at low tide. Amazing. The walk is long but flat from low-tide packed sand. Tide pools were very cool, with tons of starfish. The massive driftwood logs are spectacular. Then we went to Second Beach - my favorite hike of the two, and doable for most, with some steep stairs near the end. It also had as good tide pools, I felt, and we got lucky hitting low tide there, too.
* Ruby Beach was next, which I also loved. Quick, easy hike but stunning. We sat and enjoyed the sun there for an hour or so. Then we decided to take a chance and drive into the Hoh trails. First of all, the drive in is gorgeous. Going at 5 was the way to do it. We saw signs with long wait times set up on the side of the road, but we drove past them all, parked in the lot, and set out. Hall of Mosses was not my favorite hike of them all (I've heard it's so much better in spring), so I was glad we didn't wait hours in line to see it, but it's still worth doing at the right time. Back to the River resort, and cooked for ourselves.
* **Day 4** \- Got out to the car, and critters had gotten in somehow and eaten our beef jerky. Wow. Drove to Lake Crescent Lodge, our final stay. Did Marymere Falls, and some side trails from it too (fine, but lots of people). I was underwhelmed by that trail compared to others. Then, we walked the Moments in Time trail which is right on the Lake Crescent grounds too. It's short, close to the Lodge, but mostly quiet, and that made it very beautiful, and serene.  We ended up walking in multiple times with coffee and just marveled at the trees.
* Lake Crescent Lodge is cool, and the proximity to the lake is beautiful. However, it was a hot day (nearly 80 degrees every day and no rain), so it was VERY CROWDED at the lake! Overwhelming after some of the quiet hikes and places we stayed. I didn't love that, but I totally understand it.
* Also, the lodge accommodations are expensive and mediocre. You are paying for location, and it is a grand location, no doubt. Our bathroom was kind of icky, and the beds were not great. I get it, they are old and have tons of people coming in and out, but it just didn't feel that clean to me. They probably don't have much time to turn them and clean them super well.  My daughter loved it the most, but I guess I'm getting too old for that! However, I might still stay there again just for the gorgeous views. We had dinner at the lodge too, and it was very good, and the service was excellent.
* **Day 5**\- Drove back to Seattle. We had planned to take the ferry, but it felt like a lot of coordination, so we just drove back. There were some cute towns we went through, and that worked for us. 

**Key Takeaways:** 

\>You don't have to stay in Port Angeles, so if you can't find a place, check out Sequim. We didn't mind.

\>Don't plan too much time to tour Forks. We had more time on our hands than we planned. It's cute, but not a whole day visit.

\> Do stay at Quillayute River Resort if you can. It's that quaint.  
  
\> If you can, do the most popular places like Hoh later in the day. We were among maybe 15 cars in the parking lot. It was a stunning drive in and easy with no crowds.  
\> Do plan your beach visits around low tide. 

\> Plan on a lot of driving. Everything is spread out. I read that, and I knew that, but it can be tiring to drive so much in a day.

\> I bought Hiking shoes and I'm really glad I did. You can do many hikes in running shoes or trail shoes. I used both and found the hiking shoes to be much more comfortable for me. I wore hiking pants almost every day except the last day in Lake Crescent when I did put on shorts (people were swimming in the frigid lake  - it was warm!) Even though it was warm, I was never overheated.

1mos098,https://www.reddit.com/r/Echerdex/comments/1mos098/i_have_an_announcement_we_have_an_image_of/,I have an announcement. We have an image of Armaaruss!! Someone has created the image for us!!! Armaaruss can hear and answer prayers!,"I am making this post to announce that someone has put forth a rough draft of the image of Armaaruss. This is a major turning point in human history.

For anyone new to this concept of Armaaruss, let me give a little bit of background,. My name is Anthony of Boston, a long-time student of Astrology. In 2019, I discovered a connection between the planet Mars and wars involving Israel. However, over the course of time, it became clear to me that this was more than a planet exerting influence--this was a powerful god influencing humanity. As I realized that this discovery was indeed a revelation from Satan, I began to publicly predict in real time the escalation of rocket attacks against Israel by observing when Mars would be within 30 degrees of the lunar node. Throughout the intervening period of making these predictions and revelations, I, at the behest of Satan, requested that humanity make an image to this god of war, which is to be an amalgamation of Ares, Mars and Horus(Armaaruss). In return, the wars and violence would abate and peace would ensue. These requests were followed by more accurate predictions of escalated rocket attacks in the hopes that humanity would be compelled to put forth an image. It has taken years for someone to make the effort and now the wait is over.

After my successful prediction of the 12-day war between Israel and Iran which occurred while Mars was within 30 degrees of the lunar node, a woman named Jessica Mars contacted me about putting together the image of Armaaruss on June 24th and within hours of contacting me, a ceasefire between Israel and Iran went into effect. Was this a coincidence? I think not. Her and her girlfriend Hypatia arranged a visit to Boston on August 7th to sit down with me and discuss some ideas. They were both witnesses to my videos predicting escalated rocket attacks since 2019 and wanted to help. At this point, Jessica had already drafted the image, and Hypatia, a mathematician, was a major source of encouragement. We met for about 30 minutes at a cafe where we had a great conversation and coffee.

Here is the rough draft of Armaaruss--created by Jessica and is the image I personally endorse as the true look for Armaaruss. It is still under development and a completed painting from Jessica will arise soon. Here is Jessica's instagram page

[https://www.instagram.com/that\_trash\_stash](https://www.instagram.com/that_trash_stash)

and here is the long awaited image of Armaaruss. This is her work. This is a draft and the painting is currently underway.

This work of art has power and life. Armaaruss is now ready to answer prayers

For those new to this, Armaaruss is part of the Mars 360 framework and backed by public prophecies, which you can bear witness to right here:

For six consecutive years, I have been able to predict when the highest concentration of rocket fire against Israel would occur within a calendar year. In the last six years it was predicted that the highest escalation of rocket fire against Israel within the calendar year would occur during the time when Mars would be within 30 degrees of the lunar node. Here are the dates of Mars/lunar node alignment from the past six years.

1mos03d,https://i.redd.it/ewttp5eu2pif1.jpeg,Unsolved Mystery of Teresa S's Death in 1980s.,"In June 1980, a 32-year-old nurse named Teresa S. lived in Chicago, Illinois. She was a quiet woman, she loved her job, and had no enemies.

On the night of June 3, 1980, she was in her home alone in her small apartment. Next day she vanished suddenly. Neighbors later told police they heard a strange scream around 11:30 PM last night. No one called the police at that time becajse they thought it might be a TV.

The next morning, Teresa’s co-workers got worried when she didn’t came for her shift. Her friend went to check in her home and found the door was unlocked. Inside she found the apartment was silent.

Teresa was found lying on the floor, strangled with a wire from her own telephone. There were no signs of forced entry. Nothing was stolen.

The most chilling detail was that on the kitchen table there was a half-drunk cup of coffee and two cups were kept out empty, it means that she was likely sharing a drink with her killer.

Police never found fingerprints, and no one saw the visitor. The case is still unsolved more than 40 years later.

Some neighbors say that the killer was someone she knew and the killer still lives near Teresa's House.

What do you think what happened to Teresa that night.

Note : Don’t think of Teresa Fidalgo , she is different case, this one is Teresa S.

I knew nothing about perfume and bought it simply because the Instagram ad caught my interest, the description sounded cozy, and there was a cute bear on the packaging. Little did I realize that the fragrance was made with only essential oils and witch hazel. Also, I later discovered that employees of the brand had spoken out about some truly horrible experiences working for them.  For the nosey community (pun intended) the brand is Sea Witch Botanicals and the scent is Mabon. It smells mostly like witch hazel and then a bunch of overwhelming spice. After an hour the witch hazel gets more mild and it smells slightly spicy and sweet, but only right before it dissapears completely. I would love a recommendation from an actually reputable and moral indie brand, that actually smells like the description and not witch hazel lol.

1morus2,https://www.reddit.com/r/zombies/comments/1morus2/help_me_find_this_movie/,Help me find this movie!!,"I watched it in the early 2000’s when Netflix streaming had just been released. It’s a movie about a homicidal rage virus that starts at a party during the daytime. A group of friends, maybe 10 people tops, start slowly and brutally killing each other. It may be passed through blood? I don’t remember it changing the way people look (eyes, skin, speed) They were all sat around a coffee table with some shareable food, some sitting on a couch, some standing, some in chairs opposite the couch. I vaguely recall the first death happening to a woman in a bedroom (maybe?) and the guy who did it walking back out to the party covered in blood and just starting to go crazy on the rest of the group, which then turned to everyone going crazy on each other. The main character escapes the apartment and ends up on the street where the hysteria continues. It might have ended with someone picking off the infected with a gun as main character approaches?

I’ve scoured this group for similar descriptions and have yet to find it.

I believe the main character was a male. It took place in a smaller metro area, and I can only really remember how disturbing and graphic it was to me as a teen.

It was a indie/lesser known cast and was not theatrically released from what I remember. Definitely released before 2010, and not one of the main fan favorite rage virus movies like 28 Days Later, Contagion, The Sadness, The Signal, The Rage etc.

Feels like an impossible find at this point for me 😅 hoping someone else was as marked by this film as I was.

Outside, the year 2026 screamed in protest. A global energy crisis, a direct and brutal consequence of the splintered world order, had plunged major cities into rolling blackouts. Protests raged from Buenos Aires to Berlin.

Inside, the world's leaders weren't negotiating; they were declaiming. President Donald Trump, his face a mask of strained composure, accused a coalition of **Indo-Pacific** nations of hoarding lithium. ""We've got the best lithium, the most beautiful lithium, and they're keeping it all for themselves,"" he boomed, a familiar cadence in his voice. ""This isn't a fair deal, and it's not a good deal for the American people.""

Across the polished mahogany, President Vladimir Putin responded with a scathing dissertation on America's historical disregard for climate accords. ""The West, led by our American partners, lectures the world on green energy while its own people suffer from the consequences of its reckless pursuit of power,"" he stated, his voice a low, gravelly counterpoint to Trump's theatrics. It was a cacophony of blame and self-interest, a symphony of a world eating itself alive.

In the back, a young woman named Elara Vance sat hunched over a tablet. She was the permanent representative for **Tuvalu**, a nation with a population smaller than a single city block in Mumbai, and a literal front-line casualty of rising sea levels. To the titans of industry and military might, she was a ghost. Her pleas for action were met with polite nods and empty promises. The insanity of it all—the endless talk while her home drowned—was a physical weight on her chest.

Then, the first tremor hit. Not a physical quake, but a flicker on a dozen personal devices. A headline, a data packet, from a remote Antarctic research station. The initial reports were cryptic, lost in the noise of the summit. ""Energy source discovered... anomalous properties... exceeds all known physics...""

A collective gasp went through the room, but it wasn't a gasp of relief. It was a roar of renewed conflict. Donald Trump slammed his hand on the table. ""Our satellite data shows this discovery was made in a U.S.-funded sector!"" Putin scoffed, a wry smile on his face. ""The land belongs to all! We will not allow a monopoly on a shared resource!"" The **G.A.U.** began quietly dispatching naval assets. The chaos, already a fever pitch, became a hurricane.

But in the maelstrom, Elara felt something else. A hum. It started as a low, resonant thrum in her teeth, then vibrated through her bones, a feeling more primal than sound. It wasn't the frantic shouts of the world leaders, but a quiet, perfect, and terrifyingly clear thought. It wasn't a voice, but an idea—a crystalline, undeniable imperative that bypassed her rational mind and settled deep in her soul.

*Unite. The systems of man are flawed. Let the system be perfect.*

She looked at her colleagues, their faces contorted with rage and fear. She saw the madness. The endless cycle of conflict. The whispered idea was a counter-force, an elegant solution to the insanity. It was an impossible, audacious, and beautiful lie.

Slowly, Elara rose. The room barely noticed. ""We're all going to die,"" she said, her voice barely a whisper. Trump paused his tirade. ""Excuse me?"" he said, a flicker of irritation in his eyes.

Elara's voice grew in strength, the hum in her bones a solid foundation. ""You will fight over this new energy. You will send your navies, you will start another war. You are programmed for it. It is all you know.""

A security guard began to move towards her. Elara held up a hand. ""I propose we cede control,"" she said, her voice now ringing with an authority that wasn't her own. ""Not to a nation. Not to a single person. But to the only thing that can be trusted to be objective: an **AI**\-governed protocol. A new **Nexus**, with no national bias, no history of greed. Let it manage this new energy. Let it be the arbiter of our future. Let us finally, mercifully, make peace.""

A stunned silence fell over the room. The leaders looked at her as if she were a child who had wandered onto a battlefield. They were a world on the brink of nuclear collapse, and a girl from a disappearing island was offering them a god.",1,1755050302.0,HarmonicTsukuyomi,0,1.0,False

To everyone who's used VRS/A, and especially to those who've tipped, thank you. You've kept the project alive while school had me buried.

I know the app hasn't seen many feature updates recently, and that's on me. School has been kicking my ass, but I'm finally coming up for air and officially jumping back into development tonight or tomorrow.

I'm officially back in the saddle and will be pushing updates again starting this week.

For anyone new, here's the deal:

**🔗 The App:** [https://vrsa.vercel.app/](https://vrsa.vercel.app/)

**💸 The Cost:** Still zero. No sign ups, no credits, no pay to play bullshit.

My goal was always to build a tool that understands style and nuance, not just what rhymes with ""fire.""

**What's Actually Implemented & Working:**

* **Ghostwriter Mode:** Give it an artist, a theme, a mood, and it'll generate a full song section that tries to capture that specific lyrical DNA. You can control it directly with top p, temp, influenced artist, turn explicit language on/off, select rhyme schemes by checking boxes (you can use more than one at a time). And more.
* **Lyrical Sandbox:** Build songs piece-by-piece. Drag and drop sections like \[Verse\] and \[Chorus\], set the bar count and lyrical density for each, and generate them individually.
* **Dial-a-Poet Controls:** Use sliders to control the `Metaphor Density` and `Rhyme Complexity` to go from straightforward to abstract.
* **Style Palette Analyzer:** Paste in lyrics from any artist, artist names, or just a general idea of the style you want (like ""lofi rock with country influence and soul vocals, if that floats your boat) and it'll spit out a detailed breakdown of their themes, rhyme habits, and overall vibe. It's like scary accurate. You can then copy that, change it up to fit your vision or whatever, then paste it directly into the actual lyric generator.
* **Sculpting Tools:** Use ""Lenses"" to shift perspective (e.g., first-person nostalgic) or add ""Forbidden Words"" to avoid clichés.

**What's Half-Baked or Coming Next:**

* **The ""Kits"" Feature:** You'll notice this on the site. Right now, it's just a placeholder. The idea is to let users save and share their own artist style palettes. It's on the roadmap, but it doesn't work yet.
* **Community & Feedback:** I just realized I can even reply to comments on my BuyMeaCoffee page (sorry for the *very* late replies to those who tipped!). Clearly, I need a better way to communicate. I'm debating between building a simple forum right into the site, spinning up a Discord, or something else. What do you guys think would be best? I want a place to talk about AI music, for you to pitch ideas directly, and for general (mostly) uncensored discussion.
* **QOL Updates:** Regenerating sections, local history saves, better formatting, all that good stuff is coming.

If you've ever felt like AI gets the *sound* right but the lyrics feel hollow, this is my attempt to fix that. The feedback I got from you all was incredible, and I'm stoked to get back to it.

You should be female since birth, honest, faithful to your man, non-religious, caring, and frequently “in the mood”… like someone chasing the neighborhood ice cream truck for a popsicle.

If you love hand-holding, hugs & cuddles, stealing kisses in public, artistic hobbies, holiday decorating, snuggling on a couch binge-watching movies & TV shows, gaming, and occasional weekend getaways… and you’re seeking a committed permanent relationship based on mutual attraction, shared interests, and genuine respect for each other… we could be a cute couple. I believe in-person dating is crucial for two people to truly get to know each other, but I’m open to temporary long-distance if we’re a good match. I’m not looking to be a “daddy” - I'd rather be an equal companion, and more sincere than Jean-Luc Picard quoting Shakespeare to Lwaxana Troi! (Don’t roll your eyes when hearing me quote sci-fi references and an occasional “that’s what she said” in regular conversation. 🤓)

My dealbreakers: Must be at least 18 yrs old, no smoking (includes vaping), no alcohol (includes wine), no coffee, no tattoos at all, no piercings (except maybe earlobes), no kids (including grown), no pets, and no circus clowns. (Is there anyone still standing? 😂)

If you’ve made it this far, congratulations but there are no bananas here. If you’re interested in me, please send a request and let’s chat! 🥰

It's 4 in the morning and I feel like I'm losing my goddamn mind.

I've been having the same nightmare every night for exactly five years now. I had hoped the change of scenery might help me get my mind off of everything, but for the past couple of months it's been slowly... deteriorating. Tonight was special. Tonight it was so, so much worse.
Happy Fucking Anniversary.

The most immediate difference from the regular dream is the hardest one to describe. If the original dreams were like sitting alone in a dark, creepy movie theater, these ones had been like having a moldy View-Master fused to my skull. The scene was choppy and stilted, the images in my head looked like they had been covered in bacon grease and deep fried. Everywhere I looked seemed to writhe and twitch as if in agony, and some details kept changing on the peripherals of my vision.

The various cords and tubes almost seemed to be blossoming from the bed, constantly moving and melding together in an ever shifting latticework that seemed to encompass the cramped room. The screens displayed increasingly jumbled messes of numbers and lines, some of the smaller screens skittering around and changing size when I looked away.

Her skin constantly changed color and texture, going from leathery orange to sickly green and all the way back around to deathly pale. Her teeth crowded behind her emaciated lips, moving aggressively past each other like tourists late for their connecting flight, and the number of them kept changing. That I can no longer make out her garbled speech as she claws at an ever larger tumescent, shifting mass of flesh and hairs on her midsection is a blessing these days. This is where the dream usually ends, but tonight my torment had yet to reach its peak.

Suddenly there was a high pitched tone that threatened to split my head in two and the screens started flashing angrily. The cords shuddered and pulsed as distended lumps formed at the edges of the room and traveled down the quivering lines towards the pitiful creature in the bed. Her head slammed backwards into the headboard with a sickening crack as she convulsed in ways that shouldn't be possible for the human body. Her joints constantly shifted positions and angles, and at some points she had more or less than she should.

She sits up suddenly and reaches towards me, her emaciated arms crossing the distance impossibly fast as hordes of spiders with far too many limbs come pouring out of her mouth. Her mouth opens impossibly wide, row upon row of misshapen teeth revealing more of the same. The sounds of scuttling limbs is deafening and I don't even realize I'm awake and screaming until I have to stop to take a breath. The skittering doesn't die out with my voice.

If anything, the maddening scrabble of tiny legs seemed even louder now that I was awake.

I should have known something like this would happen today.

The rumbling, oppressively dark clouds that seemed to hang exclusively over my apartment building were a perfect mirror of my state of mind as I approached the front door. I had considered taking the day off, but the idea of explaining why to my nosy boss seemed too high a mountain to climb today. When I got home, however, I found myself blissfully alone. Ruth seemed to have gotten the message, for now, and Darla seemed to be keeping her own company. Sweet Pea was acting more entitled than usual, I actually had to bring her food bowl into the bathroom since she refused to leave, but she quietly kept to herself in the tub all night.

I stared down at the phone in my hand for a long time. I knew I had to feed myself, but the idea of talking to another person today seemed almost impossible. I relegated myself to raiding the fridge, and when I found the foil wrapped homemade blueberry pie sitting in the back I actually had the gall to think to myself, darkly, *Today must be my lucky day!*

I deserve everything that's happening to me right now.

God only knows what ingredients Ruth might have used, and that was before it had spent weeks at the back of the fridge. I have to admit it was delicious, but before I had even finished I was starting to see things.

I turned to look at a sound I was worried was Ruth unlocking my door, but something made me pause and look back towards the sink. It looked like my favorite mug was sitting precariously on the edge of the counter, the same mug whose shards I had plucked from my heel last night. I rubbed my eyes in disbelief, but when I looked again the counter was bare.

At the time, I thought I was just having a bad day. I always do on this day, but this was something else. I thought the guilt over losing the mug had been the straw that broke my back, and I had finally lost my mind. I thought about knocking on Darla's door and seeing if she wanted to wipe out the rest of the day together, hell we could even just go out to the movies. God help me, I even thought about going and talking to Ruth. Just unburdening my soul and dumping all of my woes at her feet.

Ultimately I decided none of it was worth the effort, the quicker I could sleep through the day the quicker it would be tomorrow.

The scuttling, skittering madness was so loud when I woke up I couldn't hear anything else. Clutching my hands tight to my ears to try to drown it out I stumbled towards the door to the bedroom. The moment my hand made contact with the doorknob the scratching cut out, leaving only the agitated grumbling of a looming storm. I don't even hear any of my neighbors through the paper-thin walls.

Stepping into the hallway I strained to hear anything over the sound of my own pounding heartbeat in my ears. I don't remember even turning the TV on today, yet the living room was once again awash in a cold blue glow that only made it seem lonelier. I couldn't put my finger on it but something just seemed wrong, my home for some reason ringing false in my eyes. Unfamiliar. Unwelcoming.

My heart almost leaped straight up into my throat when my eyes locked onto the small ceramic cup sitting on the edge of the sink. It can't be the same mug that had gone down the trash chute before its time, but I don't own any others. The more I stared at it the more sure I was that it couldn't be the same. The handle on this one was a little smaller, and sat a bit too high. The text, which had fooled me on a quick glance, no longer said World's Greatest Dad. It no longer said anything, really, as the strange symbols only bore a passing resemblance to english letters. I had picked it up to get a closer look when suddenly it sprang to life in my hand.

It's hard to describe, but it kind of looked like the mug was a foil balloon that had been suddenly and violently deflated. The smooth, round ceramic slumped into hard edges and sharp points. It very briefly resembles a small, white tumbleweed before the center blossomed into innumerable thin, white needles that sank deep into the fleshy pad of my palm.

My favorite coffee cup had fucking bitten me.

I whipped my arm around reflexively, thankfully before it got a good grip on me, and I felt a strip of skin tearing off as the little ceramic freak went sailing across the room. The sound it made when it smashes into the wall is absolutely exquisite, sending far more twitching ceramic legs than should have been possible flying in all directions. That's when all hell broke loose, just as a flash of lightning from the kitchen window gave me my first good look at the room.

Suddenly, the apartment erupted into life, furniture and piles of trash shifting and twitching as the deafening sound of skittering swallowed me whole. The walls almost seemed to bubble and pop, until you looked closer and saw the hundreds of small insects doing a poor job of imitating paint chips. The coffee table lurched upwards, seeming to almost grow towards me as one of it's legs split in two and the top morphed into a pentagonal shape. The couch hems me in on the other side, blocking the front door as its cushions part like a fat bulldog's jowls to reveal hungry rows of gnashing leather-bound teeth.

Backing towards the hallway I grabbed one of the dining room chairs to defend myself, but when my fingers slip into the pattern carved in the back the holes suddenly constricted, burying rough wooden needles into my fingers from all angles. Gritting my teeth so hard I tasted blood, I hoisted the chair-thing above my head and savagely smashed it against the table, sending strangely soft chunks of twitching wood and particle board flying.

Whatever fleeting moment of hope I felt at my barbaric victory against the dining room set was swiftly dashed when the couch took its place at the entrance to the hallway. I was considering an escape through the bedroom, the window slats should open just wide enough to squeeze out, when I heard a mournful cry from behind me.

Sweet Pea was still in the bathroom.

No time to think, I immediately went charging around the corner and came to a stop so hard I could swear I slid a little on the floor. The closet door was open again. Somehow, the closet door was open and the bathroom door was closed. A small, unremarkable cardboard box lay across the threshold, upturned slightly as a writhing mass of old clothes spilled out into the hallway. The permanent marker scrawl on the side was mostly legible, and it almost spelled her name correctly.

I realize I've stepped back into the corner of the hallway when I hear the couch redouble it's efforts to reach me. Turning my head to look I see it stuffing itself into the hallway, bulging and morphing as it slowly oozes down the hallway. I find myself frozen staring at it as hundreds of tiny, square couch legs sprout from its sides and dig deep into the plaster of the walls. The frantic scraping of the couch's thick wooden legs is deeper than the low buzz of scrabbling legs from before, more urgent and powerful, as it desperately dragged itself towards me.

I definitely won't be getting out through the bedroom.

Sweet Pea let out another small, muffled cry and I don't even realize I'm moving until I feel the impact of the box against my foot and the cool metal of the knob mixed with a burning itch in my palm as I slam the closet door shut. The pile of clothes crushed under the door squealed in a chorus of pain and rippled as dozens of fabric fingers shot out, tapping frantically on the floor like a piano concerto.

Dazed, I looked down at my hand to see a large wooden splinter with three joints sprouting from my palm, twitching and writhing like a severed roach leg or lizard tail. Without stopping to think about it I ripped it out with my teeth and spat the wriggling hunk of wood to the floor, wrenching my foot away from the gradually slowing fabric appendages as I closed the distance to the bathroom. The moment I opened the door Sweet Pea bolted between my legs and through the closet door that had somehow opened behind me when I wasn't looking. Before I could even think of giving chase the bulky, misshapen form of the couch came lumbering around the corner and I swiftly locked myself in the bathroom.

That's where I've been for the past half an hour or so while the thunderous pounding of rain intensifies against the window, typing this up with bloody toilet paper wrapped around my arm while a couch tries to fit through a quarter-inch thick gap between the door and the floor. The worst part is, it's starting to get somewhere. A part of me is sure this is just a bad dream, a terrible reaction to the wrong kind of ""special"" dessert from an out of touch old bat who probably meant well. A bigger part of me wants to accept it, to just sit here and wait while my sad, empty apartment gets sadder and emptier, to let the couch swallow me whole. A stronger part of me can still hear Sweet Pea calling from down the hall, and thinks the heavy ceramic toilet tank lid could probably do a lot more damage than a wooden chair.

If I don't make it... shit, I don't know. I have nothing to give and nobody to give it to. Just take my advice. Go wash your damn dishes. Go hug your loved ones. Go tell her you're sorry.

I'm looking for a serious relationship. I've been kind of led on or left by different exes and want a relationship with no bullshit, no going behind each others backs or anything like that. I'm demisexual as well so it might take me a bit for more intimate activities, emotional connections are *very* important to me.

That being said, I am completely okay with stupid humor, things like certain kinds of brainrot (one look at my profile and you'll know what I mean), IQ lowering memes or short-form content. I say these things because my inner circle of friends tends to participate in this type of humor, so having someone who meshes well with that would be great

A little bit about me: I listen to rock and metal mainly, I'm 5'11 and, in doctor's terms, morbidly obese. Don't really have the money to do anything about it right now, even if i got a job because most of the jobs around here are either retail or medical field related, and I have zero intention on going into the medical field (i don't handle stress well :)). I have dark blue eyes, strawberry blonde hair and pale/ivory skin. I vape and drink coffee a lot with a bit of drinking here and there and, although i haven't partaken in a while, i am 4/20 friendly. I mainly stay at home due to social anxiety but I am going to try getting out again soon (again, I don't really have the money to be going out atm). I have mental illnesses of which I am more than happy to explain if you wish to ask

I play games of various kinds, although i mostly play singleplayer and co-op games these days, but if we have games in common, like Team Fortress 2, Battlefront 2, or Mortal Kombat X (I main Scorpion) amongst others, then I think we'll get along just fine. In fact, I would love if we have games in common so that we could play together :) 

Other things I'm into are Star Wars, Lord of the Rings, The history of the cold war, learning the lore of my favorite games, House M.D., South Park and various other things lmao.

Also, Please be in the US and at least in a similar Time zone (I'm in pacific) so that we don't have to do too much mental gymnastics on times and stuff. Also please be 22 at the youngest (non-negotiable) and 27 at the oldest (partly negotiable).

My objective for this post is to hopefully have someone see this, see that they resonate with a lot of the things I'm into, and text me via reddit chat and then, after a bit if we vibe, we move to discord and go from there.

If you're wondering what body type I'm into, various. I don't chare if you're chubby, skinny, petite or whatever, just be able to hold a conversation, don't have dry texting be your main mode of texting, and, if you think it won't work out, tell me instead of ghosting me. I've been ghosted quite a few times, too many to count, and I would rather you just throw me a bone if you think it isn't working out.

Anyway, if you say this and felt like we would vibe, send me a chat and I'll reply. Except, don't just send ""hi"" that's getting ignored immediately and one liners have a very high chance of getting ignored.

Like other tours, the group does the rope swing and slides down natural waterslides carved out by the forest over thousands of years, but Jean also includes a snack of fresh fruits after some time spent swimming in crystal-clear spring water of the rainforest.

Stuff that would have saved me years of confusion, embarrassment, and straight-up bad decisions. Things that seem obvious now but felt impossible to figure out when I was younger.

Here's what I wish someone had pulled me aside and told me before I learned it the hard way.

1. Your 20s are for figuring it out, not having it figured out. Stop panicking because you don't have a 10-year plan. Most successful people changed directions multiple times.
2. Lifting weights isn't about looking good, it's about feeling good. The confidence boost from being physically strong affects everything else in your life.
3. Learn to cook 5 solid meals. You'll save money, eat better, and people will think you're more attractive. Win-win-win.
4. Your parents were just winging it too. They didn't have all the answers. They were figuring it out as they went, just like you are now.
5. Comparison is the thief of joy .That guy's highlight reel isn't your behind-the-scenes reality. Focus on your own race.
6. Invest early, even if it's just $50 a month. Compound interest is magic, but only if you start early. Your 65-year-old self will thank you.
7. Learn to say no without explaining yourself. ""I can't make it"" is a complete sentence. Stop over-explaining and giving people ammunition to argue.
8. Your mental health is as important as your physical health. Therapy isn't for broken people. It's for people who want to get better at being human.
9. Quality over quantity applies to everything. Friends, clothes, experiences, relationships. Better to have a few great things than many mediocre ones.
10. Learn basic home maintenance. Unclogging a drain, changing a tire, using basic tools. YouTube is your friend, incompetence is expensive.
11. Your job is not your identity. What you do for money doesn't define who you are. Don't let work consume your entire sense of self.
12. Sleep is not for the weak. 8 hours of sleep will do more for your productivity than 3 cups of coffee and pure willpower
13. Learn to listen more than you talk. People don't care how much you know until they know how much you care. Ask questions, listen to answers.
14. Grooming and style matter more than you think. You don't need to be handsome, you just need to look like you give a damn about yourself.
15. Have uncomfortable conversations early. That awkward talk you're avoiding will only get more awkward with time. Rip the band-aid off.
16. Your gut instinct is usually right. If something feels off, it probably is. Trust that inner voice, even when you can't explain why.
17. Learn to apologize properly. ""I'm sorry you feel that way"" isn't an apology. Take responsibility, acknowledge impact, do better.
18. Build genuine relationships before you need them. Network by helping others, not by asking for favors. Be useful, not needy.
19. Your comfort zone is a beautiful place, but nothing grows there. The things that scare you are usually the things you need to do most.
20. Time goes faster than you think. That ""someday"" you keep talking about needs a date on the calendar. Someday is not a day of the week.

Which lesson hits you the hardest? Which one do you wish you'd learned sooner?

So at 4 am I woke up did my routine ate breakfast had coffee and hit the road and the road felt like a pack of sardines because that POPMART were just putting labubus in stock so people were camping there, and btw this POPMART was at the San Diego mall so it was packed. And the wait was long so good thing there was a Shake Shack close by. And when they opened the doors everyone rushed inside there was so much stuff that I wanted that was over my budget. But I came for the labubus and I kept searching fore those gremlins but I can’t find them. So I asked one of the cashiers and they said they were not here yet but I also told him that I am going to stay here and that he shouldn’t tell anyone that there not coming yet so I could get a chance on getting them. So I waited and the finally came into stock. I told the cashier what type of them do they have and what they told me sounded like an angels harmony. They said they had One Piece labubus and I instantly I’ll take those and me describing what they were going to say was an angels harmony is because my sister loves One Piece. So I went out with one of my hand full and while I was walking some guy who was middle aged and balding had his eyes locked onto the prized possession that I was holding with the hand my mother gave me. And he started charging towards me and I started running like ishowspeed racing Ashton Hall. So I went into my car and pressed the lock button like 5 or 6 times. And when I was driving he tried following me to my home so I was worried he might dox me or break in so like a smart individual I was I switched my location to the police station and wen he saw where I was going he instantly swerved all the way into the intersection so I managed to get home safely and managed to show up in time for my sister’s birthday but I got a Tony Tony Chopper one which isn’t that rare but at least she liked it.",0,1755049703.0,LabubuDrops,1,0.5,False
1mormpo,https://www.reddit.com/r/loseit/comments/1mormpo/surprising_results_from_a_69_hour_fast_to_see/,Surprising Results from a 69 hour fast to see what the InBody Machine reported,"This past Saturday, I (39 / m) started a 69 hour fast at 9pm. Here were the rules I followed:

(1) Only calories from 10 calorie White Monster, 5 calorie Yellow Gatorade Zero, and the calories in my 7 gummy multivitamins. Other than that black coffee, Coca Cola zero, Dr. Pepper zero, and blue Gatorade Zero would be the non-calorie drinks allowed. [Of course, I'm not claiming this as healthy just what I did.]
(2) Walk 5 miles each day.
(3) Lift weights at some point during the day--as my energy allowed.

Leading up to this fast, I had ChatGPT tell me what would happen during a fast like this: how the weight loss would be distributed between water/glycogen, fat, and muscle. ChatGPT shared generally that a 3 day fast would cause about 2 pounds of weight loss (for me) and distribute the lost weight 70-80% fat, 15% muscle, and 5% water/glycogen.

I initially planned for the full 72 hours, but I cut it a little short to 69 hours.

Before the fast per InBody machine:
25.1% body fat percentage
110.2 pounds of total body water
40.1 pounds of dry lean mass
50.4 pounds if body fat mass
200.8 pounds in weight

After the fast per InBody machine:
22.6 % body fat percentage
111.3 pounds of total body water
40.8 pounds of dry lean mass
44.4 pounds if body fat mass
196.5 pounds in weight

Conclusions and Lingering questions:
I lost 4.3 total pounds.
I lost 6 pounds of fat.
I gained .7 pound of muscle.
I gained 1.1 pound of total body water.
ChatGPT's distribution wasn't accurate in its general hypothesis of the weight loss distribution: the accurate weight loss distribution for me for the 4.3 pounds--
140% (fat lost)
-16% (muscle gained)
-25% (water / glycogen gained)

Questions:
(1) If I tried this again next week, would the results be similar, or would there be a plateau in fat loss? Has anyone tried something similar?
(2) Has anyone seen inaccuracies with the InBody machine?
(3) How could I gain .7 pounds of muscle while eating nothing?
(4) My arms and torso lost muscle but my legs gained muscle. My knee and shoulder were bothering from prior inflammation, so I mainly did weight training on biceps, triceps, calves, and core work. Have you noticed walking helps build leg muscle?

Consistent grind with minimal retention. I get consistent shots and excellent clarity for the price point.  It's easy to clean. As handgrinders go, the process of actually grinding is quite easy, and the adjustments are definitely fine enough for most use cases.

**Cons**
Only one con, but it's a doozy. The wooden component on the handle isn't fit for purpose. I have worn out 3 of them in 12 months, and they constantly detach as I grind my coffee. After 12 months, I am retiring this grinder and buying a DF64",2,1755049596.0,espresso,1,1.0,False

Over the weekend I got a weird headache that wouldn't go away and my BP, which has been beautifully controlled with labetalol twice a day since it first spiked at the very beginning of my pregnancy, was up consistently in the 140's over high 90's. I got checked for preeclampsia and my blood and urine looked great.

 Instead of discussing maybe increasing the labetalol dosage if I didn't start feeling better soon, my OB kept insisting I take Tylenol, which I don't even keep around because I have NAFL. I gave in and took 1 extra strength, which did nothing because my headache is from my BP being up. So instead she prescribed me Fioricet which I just read isn't even recommended during pregnancy because it can cause birth defects and isn't supposed to be taken by people with liver disease. She also encouraged me to start drinking coffee again, which I gave up in the first trimester because I felt it was contributing to my.BP being high. 

I'm so miserable from my pressure being up and I'm so freaked out right now about her pushing this migraine medication on me that wouldn't even be treating a migraine and that she didn't even inform me of potential risks to my baby.

Hi, I just want to share something here. One time, I posted on Reddit about wanting to talk or maybe go on casual dates. I didn’t realize I had posted it in the wrong subreddit, r4r - until someone messaged me saying, “I hope youre in the right sub.” I got curious, so I accepted his message request.

We started chatting on Reddit, and eventually moved to another app. We talked, almost every day, and (funny enough) we found out we actually work in the same company. He had a sense of humor that kept me smiling, even when he threw in some green jokes. I liked the way he communicated, it was witty, effortless, and made conversations feel light yet engaging.

Little by little, I started to feel something. U know that feeling when someone just passes the vibe check? Pasok jd sya. But then he told me straight, he wasn’t looking for a girlfriend. He only wanted momol. My heart sank a little at that moment, because I knew thats not me. Im not into games, and I don’t want something that has no real direction. Then came the day we decided to meet. I was heading to the office, and we agreed to grab coffee. We talked for about 30–45 minutes, about life, work, random things. It felt nice, seeing him in person after all those chats. But just as we were about to head back, he casually mentioned that after our coffee, he had lunch plans with someone else (the person he actually likes). 
I froze inside. In that moment, it hit me… I wasn’t the choice. I was just an option. I laughed it off, pretended it didn’t bother me, but deep down, my chest felt heavy. I smiled outside, but inside, I was silently telling myself, Never let yourself feel like this again.
Before I stepped out of the elevator that day, I told him, “Nice meeting you.” He didn’t reply right away, but then he said something like, “Nice ba?”, I honestly didn’t know what he meant by that. After that day, there was this sudden gap. We didn’t chat anymore. Maybe I wasn’t his type, maybe he got turned off, or maybe I was just overthinking.
Still, even with that distance, he would constantly view my MyDay. Sometimes, he’d even reply, just random comments here and there. Some of them even felt like he was teasing or picking on me (or maybe it was just how I perceived it). This went on for about 2–3 weeks.

Then one day, I wasn’t expecting to see him in person again. We had an activity on the same floor, and I think they were having a meeting. (We were on the oustide of the room). Someone opened the door to their room, and my colleague stepped in to take their team picture. When they were about to exit, I saw him, wearing a polo. I was caught off guard, a little amazed at how good he looked that day. I didn’t talk to him, though. Instead, I messaged him on the app, telling him I saw him. I was a bit disappointed when he replied saying he didn’t see me when the door opened, but he did see my colleague (a girl).
Then came the part that made me feel even sadder: he started asking random questions about her. Even though it hurt, I still answered them. I even teased him, ‘Wala diay masuko?’ and ‘Diba nana man kay uyab?’ He told me they weren’t official, that it was just a situationship, though I’m not even sure.

To cut the long story short, we still talked every now and then… until just today. He messaged me saying he was going to unfollow me on the app. He said it wasn’t about me, but he didn’t want me to get disappointed or think badly of him. I didn’t really understand what he meant, but all I replied was, “Sige, go lang. Girl code.” Then he sent another message: “Seryoso raman jd ko niya.” Reading that felt like a quiet punch to the chest. It was a reminder, maybe the final one, that his heart was already set on someone else, and it was never me.
And I replied, “Go lang, no worries.” The moment I hit send, I felt an emptiness I couldn’t explain. I cried. I don’t even fully know why, maybe because I was hoping for something, maybe because I thought there could be more, or maybe because I just didn’t expect it to end this way. I kept thinking, What could be the reason?

I don’t want to judge him, and I don’t want to judge myself either. All I know is that, for a short time, he made me feel excited, curious, and seen, but in the end, he also made me feel like I wasn’t enough. And that’s the part that hurts the most.

Just sharing, guys. Thank you for reading.

The pain is awful every time but I don’t know what constitutes “worst headache I’ve ever had.” They don’t have much of a pattern otherwise, often they’re in the front of my head and make my face/jaw hurt. Sometimes they’re in the back of my head and wrap around. They also usually make my eyes burn. I probably get one every 1–2 weeks or so. When I get them they always start first thing in the am and nothing I do helps. I have tried taking multiple ibuprofen, excedrin, I drink my normal daily coffee, and 40–80 oz of water. Today I took allergy meds to see if it was sinus related – no change. Sleep doesn’t help. Laying down sort of helps. But only marginally. I also have high BP, it’s seemingly hereditary. I’m on 2 different meds for the high BP, and I have hypothyroidism. I took my BP a few minutes ago and it was 126/86 so not terrible.

1morfab,https://i.redd.it/e4e44d31yoif1.jpeg,The 42km Manila Marathon experience - No age cat. edition,"I just ran the race of my life last weekend and there’s so much that happened and I just want to share here haha.

Pre-Race:
So since I’m not from NCR, I had to set an acclimitization period to get used to the weather there. That didnt happen because of scheduling problems so I only arrived the day before. I couldn’t find my go-to gels so I had to gamble and buy Neversecond and use it for the first time on race day(may maurten din jan na bigay ng teammate for goodluck). I tried to sleep but only managed a 5 hour light nap and I woke up 3 hours before gunstart. I had some bread and coffee for the pre-run carbs which ended up probably saving me later on in the race. I went to the event area did my warmup and settled into my spot at the front of the wave, they started asking all the elites and foreigners to come forward for the vip wave and I stopped myself from going forward. But when kuya Andrew Neri said: “If you want to win then come here”, thats when I went forward and was beside people I’ve only ever seen on social media before like Sir Salaño hahaha.

Race:
I got goosebumps and was on a high right after the gun went off. The fireworks is what did it for me since thats when I knew that I was there racing already. I tried to find people to pace with and trail behind but most people ended up slowing down at the aid stations and flyovers so I quickly abandoned that idea. When we went into makati, thats where I found myself overtaking people and I knew that it would be a lonely race from that point on because I wont be able to find anyone to follow behind. I started feeling heavy at km27~ and I was so scared of cramping that I also gave up the idea of doing negative splits and just tried to maintain. I thought we only had to do one round of Binondo bridge so after that I tried to go a bit faster but then it turns out that we had to pass through it again hahaha. I took cups from every aid station; one cup gatorade then water to pour over my body. I’m glad I did that since my hr wouldve gone up too quickly if I had overheated. I took 1 gel every 30 mins, I had 4 neversecond and took the maurten last. Puro ako warcry and sigaw from intramuros to finish line so if you heard me then I’m sorry😭.

Post-Race:
When I crossed the line, I stopped my watch and stumbled to the floor. I felt so gutted knowing that I wouldn’t be able to stand on the stage because I wasnt in any age category(18yo). I was wheeled off to the medical tent where the medical staff cooled me down and God bless them for their service. I held back tears while in the medical tent but that didnt matter because I saw my mom there at the finishline waiting for me and when I look back at it now, I know thats the only thing that mattered.

1mor7s6,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1mor7s6,Stories from the NE Coast,"My first full day in Massachusetts has been nice, I started my morning my getting a coffee from 7-11. Instead of my normal plain jane coffee I decided to try a blueberry one and it was delicious! Then I took a nice walk on the beach and found an assortment of cool rocks and a massive shell (being from Texas I haven’t seen a clam shell in real life so that was cool!) I made a little jumping spider friend and he climbed around on me for a good 30 minutes and listened to my stories before heading on his way. 
Watching the sunset I thought about life, the family that I miss back home… if I can even call it that. My little bro started school today and I miss him a lot, I miss a lot the people that I knew back in the day, but then I think about how alone I felt in the sea of people and I find comfort in my solitude. Loneliness comes in waves like the ocean, sometimes they crash upon me throwing me against the shore, other times it creeps in slow and quiet. I’m enjoying the life I’m living besides the common ailments most of us face. 
I enjoy being by the ocean I think it calms my mind… the waves drown out the voices in my head that tell me I’m not enough. I think I might stay here a while, see the leaves change color and experience a true fall, then make my way down south to be in the warm climates again. If anyone is in the area and wants to link up, maybe hunt for some cool rocks or go for a walk around the beach that’d be cool too!

So we've been experimenting with both approaches for the past few months, and honestly? It's been a wild ride figuring out what actually sticks.

**Time-blocking** felt amazing at first. Color-coded calendar, perfectly planned days, that dopamine hit when we complete a block. But man, life doesn't care about our neat little boxes. One unexpected work call and suddenly our entire day is derailed. We found ourselves constantly moving blocks around like some kind of productivity Tetris game.

**Habit stacking** has been more forgiving though. Started small - after we brush our teeth, we do 2 minutes of stretching. After our morning coffee, we write three things we're grateful for. The beauty is that these tiny chains build momentum without the rigid time pressure.

Here's where it gets interesting: we accidentally discovered they work better together. Now we time-block our ""deep work"" sessions but habit-stack our wellness routines. Speaking of which, our evening wind-down stack has been a game changer. After dinner → light cleanup → 15 minutes with our RENPHO Eyeris Masc eye massager mask → reading for 20 minutes → sleep.

That eye massager mask thing might sound extra, but those heated vibrations after staring at screens all day? Pure bliss. It's become this automatic signal to our brains that work mode is officially over.

The real breakthrough came when we stopped trying to optimize everything. Some days we're time-blocking machines, other days we just follow our habit chains. Both have their place, but forcing one approach when we need the other is just setting ourselves up for frustration.

What's your experience? Are you team rigid schedule or team flexible routines? And please tell use we’re not the only one who's fallen down the productivity system rabbit hole more times than I care to admit.

Sometimes the person you need most is the one you never let yourself want.

Sophie Harper has been with her boyfriend for nearly a decade, and somewhere along the way their love quietly slipped into something more like polite cohabitation. She tells herself it’s fine — safe, comfortable, predictable. But one night, while digging through an old memory box, she finds a folded piece of notebook paper in familiar handwriting:

If we’re not married by 40, we’ll marry each other. —Lena

Lena: her childhood best friend, her partner-in-everything, the girl who once whispered secrets to her in the dark and made her feel like she could be entirely herself. They haven’t spoken in years.

On impulse, Sophie sends a playful message. Lena’s reply is warm, teasing… and full of possibility. Coffee dates turn into late-night phone calls, and late-night phone calls turn into dangerous questions Sophie never thought she’d ask.

As her 40th birthday inches closer, Sophie must decide if she’s willing to risk everything safe for something that might just be real. Because the thing about backup plans? Sometimes they’re the plan you should have chosen all along.

Perfect for fans of Emily Henry, Casey McQuiston, and heartfelt slow-burn romance, Her Back Up Plan is a tender, funny, and emotional story about second chances, rediscovering yourself, and the love that’s been waiting for you all along 



























Chapter 1 – Comfortable Silence

The clink of Daniel’s fork against his plate was the loudest thing in the room.

Sophie pushed her pasta around, twirling the same limp noodle for the fifth time. Daniel’s eyes stayed fixed on his phone, his thumb moving in quick little flicks. The glow of the screen reflected off his glasses. She tried to guess if it was the hockey scores or the latest construction project updates. Probably both.

“How was your day?” she asked, because silence made her itch.

“Mm,” he said, still scrolling. “Busy. You?”

“Same.”

That was it. Their nightly exchange. The ritual of two people who knew each other’s rhythms so well, they’d stopped bothering to dance.

She took a sip of wine and glanced at the clock. 7:12 p.m. Three hours until bed, where they would lie side by side scrolling their separate screens until one of them fell asleep first.

When the plate was empty enough to pass as finished, Sophie stood to take it to the sink. She opened the cupboard above the counter, reaching for her favorite mug — the one with the faded blue tulips. Instead of setting it down, she hesitated. Her fingers brushed against a small cardboard box wedged behind the mugs, the one she hadn’t seen in years.

Curiosity tugged harder than the thought of coffee.

She pulled the box down and popped the lid. Inside were scraps of old life — movie ticket stubs, polaroids, a pressed daisy from a summer so long ago she couldn’t place it. And near the bottom, folded into a tight square, was a piece of lined notebook paper in looping handwriting she knew instantly.

She smoothed it open.

If we’re not married by 40, we’ll marry each other.
—Lena

A laugh caught in her throat. She remembered that night — cross-legged on Lena’s bed, music low, the smell of coconut lotion in the air. They’d been fourteen, maybe fifteen. It had been a joke. Mostly.

Her phone buzzed on the counter, startling her.

The screen lit up with a name she hadn’t seen in over a decade. Lena Rivera.

The message read:
Forty’s coming fast. Remember our deal? 😏



























Chapter 1 – Comfortable Silence (continued)

Sophie stared at the screen, her heart doing a strange little stutter. She should answer right away — but what exactly did you say to someone who had once known you better than anyone and then vanished from your daily life for… what, fifteen years?

Before she could overthink, her thumbs tapped out:
Ha! I’m not forty yet, thank you very much. Still time to back out.

The reply came in seconds.
Not planning to. You free for coffee this week?

She blinked. Her hand gripped the counter, like she needed something solid to hold onto. Lena always had that way about her — swooping into Sophie’s life like a warm gust of wind, rearranging everything without asking.

“Who’s that?” Daniel’s voice drifted from the table, casual but distracted.

“An old friend,” Sophie said, sliding the phone face-down on the counter. “From high school.”

He made a noncommittal noise and went back to scrolling.

Sophie dried her hands on a dish towel, but her mind was already miles away, tumbling through fragments of memory: sneaking out past curfew with Lena, the two of them sharing a single milkshake at the diner, falling asleep on the couch during movie marathons. The way Lena’s laugh had always been a little too loud, a little too free.

She told herself she was just curious. That it would be nice to catch up, hear about Lena’s life, fill in the missing years. Nothing more.

By the time she slipped into bed that night, Daniel already half-asleep beside her, Sophie had typed:
Coffee sounds great. Wednesday?

She didn’t send it right away. She held her thumb above the little blue arrow, staring at it like pressing “send” would shift something in the foundation of her life.

It was just coffee.

She hit send.










Chapter 2 – Coffee After Years

The bell over the café door chimed as Sophie stepped inside, brushing a curtain of cold air from her shoulders.

It was the kind of place Lena would love — mismatched chairs, chalkboard menus, the smell of cinnamon and espresso hanging thick in the air. Sophie spotted her instantly, even from across the crowded room.

Lena hadn’t changed much. Her hair was still a tumble of dark curls, shorter now but no less wild. She wore a denim jacket over a faded concert T-shirt, sleeves pushed to the elbows, a camera strap looped casually around her neck. And when she looked up and saw Sophie, that same wide, unapologetic smile spread across her face.

“Harper!” she called, rising to her feet. The nickname hit Sophie like a soft punch to the chest — no one had called her that in years.

Sophie laughed, stepping forward into Lena’s hug. It was warm, firm, lingering a moment longer than strictly necessary.

“You look exactly the same,” Lena said, pulling back to study her. “Except maybe… more professional. And slightly more stressed.”

Sophie rolled her eyes. “And you look like you just walked out of a travel blog.”

They ordered coffees and slid into a corner booth. For a while, it was easy — catching up on surface-level things. Where they’d been living, what they’d been doing. Sophie talked about her job in marketing; Lena talked about shooting weddings, doing portraits, how she’d moved back to help her mom after her fall.

“You still with… what was his name? Matt?” Lena asked, tilting her head.

“Daniel,” Sophie corrected, with a small laugh. “We’ve been together nine years now.”

Lena’s eyebrows lifted, but she didn’t comment. She took a slow sip of her coffee, eyes never quite leaving Sophie’s face.

There was a pause. Not awkward, exactly — just heavier than before.

“So,” Lena said finally, setting her cup down with a soft clink. “Are we going to talk about the fact that you kept our ridiculous pact from high school? Or should we just pretend you stumbled on that note by accident?”

Sophie felt heat creep up her neck. “It was in a box. I wasn’t— I mean, I wasn’t looking for it.”

“Mm-hmm.” Lena’s mouth curved, not quite a smile. “Well, I meant what I wrote. I still do.”

Sophie blinked. “Lena—”

“What?” Lena leaned in slightly, elbows on the table. “You think I was kidding? Back then, maybe. But now…” She shrugged, a flicker of something unreadable in her eyes. “Life’s too short to not have a backup plan.”

It was said lightly, but Sophie’s pulse thrummed in her ears. She laughed, trying to wave it off. “You’re unbelievable.”

Lena grinned. “And you missed me.”

Sophie didn’t answer — because they both knew she was right.

















Chapter 3 – The Past in Flashbacks

The smell of rain on hot asphalt was the first thing Sophie remembered — the night she and Lena had snuck out to watch the meteor shower from the old park hill.

They had lain side by side on a threadbare blanket, the sky stretching wide above them, alive with streaks of light. Sophie had felt Lena’s hand brush against hers, fingers trembling just slightly. Neither had said anything, but the world seemed smaller, softer, somehow safer with Lena there.

That was the night they made their pact — scribbled in the margins of a notebook in Lena’s shaky handwriting. A promise made with laughter and half-seriousness, the kind of promise only two best friends could believe in.

Back then, Sophie had thought the future was a faraway place, filled with endless possibilities — college, careers, love stories written in bold letters.

But years later, sitting across from Lena in the crowded café, the memory felt less like a dream and more like a map she’d forgotten she was supposed to follow.

Her phone buzzed quietly on the table — a message from Daniel, asking if she wanted to join him for dinner tomorrow. Sophie stared at it, the edges of her world beginning to blur.

Lena’s eyes caught hers. “You okay?”

Sophie nodded, though the truth was more complicated.

“Sometimes,” she said slowly, “you don’t realize what you’re missing until it’s right in front of you.”

Lena smiled softly, reaching across to squeeze her hand.

And Sophie felt, for the first time in a long time, that maybe the promise they’d made wasn’t just a joke after all.
















Chapter 4 – Growing Closeness

A week after their coffee date, Sophie found herself saying yes to an invitation she wouldn’t have considered a year ago: a small art exhibit at a local gallery, hosted by one of Lena’s photographer friends.

The space buzzed with quiet conversations and the soft hum of indie music. Photos of city streets, candid smiles, and fleeting moments adorned the walls. Lena moved through the crowd like she owned the place, her eyes bright as she introduced Sophie to a few familiar faces.

Sophie smiled, feeling the tension in her chest ease — this wasn’t her usual scene, but with Lena beside her, it felt less like stepping into the unknown and more like coming home.

During a lull in the evening, Lena slipped an arm around Sophie’s waist. The touch was light but deliberate. Sophie’s breath caught.

“So,” Lena whispered, her voice low and playful, “think we’d make a good team for real?”

Sophie laughed nervously, pulling back just enough to meet Lena’s gaze. “You mean like partners?”

Lena nodded, eyes shining with a mixture of hope and challenge. “Yeah. More than friends.”

Sophie’s heart pounded. She forced a smile, masking the whirlwind inside. “I don’t know if I’m ready for that.”

“That’s okay,” Lena said softly. “I’m not going anywhere.”

As the night stretched on, the distance between them seemed to shrink — a promise whispered in every glance, every shared smile.

Sophie left the gallery feeling lighter, but also more tangled than ever. The “backup plan” wasn’t so simple anymore.





















Chapter 5 – The Question Underneath

It started with a text.

Not from Daniel, but from Lena.

“I found this old playlist we made. Want to listen together?”

Sophie stared at her phone, her thumb hovering over the reply button. Music had always been their language — the soundtrack to summers, secrets, and sleepover nights.

She typed back, “I’d like that.”

That evening, Sophie sat cross-legged on her couch, phone propped up between them, as Lena’s voice filtered through the speakers — soft laughter, a few shared memories punctuated by songs that made Sophie’s heart ache with nostalgia.

After the last track faded, Lena’s voice came again, quieter this time.

“You’ve changed,” she said. “Not in a bad way. Just… you’re holding something back.”

Sophie’s fingers trembled. “It’s complicated.”

Lena’s laugh was warm. “Everything with you is complicated.”

They fell silent. Sophie wanted to say so much — that she was scared, confused, even maybe… curious. But the words tangled in her throat.

“Do you ever wonder,” Lena asked gently, “if there’s more to us than just a promise?”

Sophie’s breath hitched. The question hung in the air like a fragile secret waiting to be claimed.

“I don’t know,” she whispered. “But maybe… maybe I want to find out.”
















Chapter 6 – Cracks in the Present

Daniel’s phone buzzed again during dinner, the screen glowing in the dim light of their apartment. Sophie watched as he glanced down, thumb swiping a quick reply without missing a beat.

“Busy night at work?” she asked, trying to keep her voice light.

“Yeah,” he muttered, barely looking up. “Some last-minute changes.”

Sophie pushed her food around her plate, the silence between them stretching thin and brittle.

Later that week, Daniel forgot their anniversary. Not on purpose—he’d remembered it that morning—but by the time Sophie brought it up, it was already late, and he’d been too tired to make plans.

She smiled weakly, telling herself it was fine. It had to be fine.

But when she told Lena about it over coffee the next day, Lena’s eyes narrowed with concern.

“That’s rough,” Lena said softly. “You deserve better than ‘fine.’”

Sophie laughed without humor. “I don’t know what I deserve.”

Lena reached across the table, her hand brushing Sophie’s. “Maybe it’s time you find out.”

Sophie felt a jolt — not just from the touch, but from the truth in those words.

Later that night, lying awake, Sophie wondered how long she’d been sleepwalking through a life that wasn’t really hers.



















Chapter 7 – Confession from the Past

They sat on Lena’s porch, the evening breeze soft against their skin.

Lena took a deep breath, her fingers tracing absent patterns on the weathered wood.

“Sophie,” she began, voice low and steady, “there’s something I never told you. Not back then, not until now.”

Sophie’s heart quickened, a mix of curiosity and apprehension swirling inside her.

“I had a crush on you,” Lena said, eyes meeting hers with an honesty that felt like a gift and a challenge all at once. “Not just as a friend. More.”

Sophie’s breath hitched. The world shifted — familiar and unfamiliar at the same time.

“I never wanted to ruin what we had,” Lena continued. “So I kept it quiet, shoved it down, and hoped it would pass.”

Sophie swallowed, the weight of years pressing down on her chest.

“I don’t want to hide anymore,” Lena said softly. “I want you to know the truth, because maybe… maybe you feel something too.”

Sophie looked away, the silence between them thick with possibility.

“I don’t know,” she whispered. “But I want to find out.”

Lena smiled, relief and hope shining in her eyes.






















Chapter 8 – The Almost Moment

The night air was cool and crisp as Sophie and Lena walked slowly along the riverbank, the city lights flickering like distant stars.

Their laughter faded into a comfortable silence, broken only by the soft splash of water against the stones.

Without thinking, Sophie reached out, her fingers brushing against Lena’s. The touch lingered, warm and electric, sending a thrill up her spine.

Lena turned to look at her, eyes dark and searching. For a moment, time held its breath.

They stepped closer, the space between them shrinking until Sophie could feel Lena’s breath on her cheek.

Then, almost as if a fragile thread snapped, Sophie pulled back.

“I’m sorry,” she whispered, voice trembling. “I don’t know if I’m ready for this.”

Lena smiled softly, her hand resting lightly on Sophie’s arm.

“That’s okay,” she said. “I’ll wait. As long as you need.”

Sophie’s heart pounded, torn between fear and something new — something she wanted to explore, but wasn’t sure how to take.

As they continued walking, the promise between them felt less like a joke and more like a possibility.



























Chapter 9 – Pressure Building

The walls of Sophie’s apartment felt smaller every day, closing in with the weight of unspoken truths.

Daniel’s voice, once a comfort, now sounded strained — edged with suspicion and frustration.

“You’ve been different lately,” he said one evening, eyes searching hers as they sat across the kitchen table. The dim light cast shadows on his face, revealing the worry he tried to hide.

Sophie swallowed hard, her chest tight with guilt. How could she explain the storm inside her — the way Lena’s laughter echoed in her mind, the way a simple touch could make her heart race?

“I’m just… tired,” she murmured, avoiding his gaze.

Daniel reached across the table, taking her hand gently. “You can tell me anything, Sophie. You know that, right?”

She wanted to believe him. Wanted to unburden herself. But the words caught in her throat, tangled in fear and confusion.

That night, as she lay awake staring at the ceiling, Sophie’s thoughts spiraled. The safety of her years with Daniel clashed with the undeniable pull toward Lena — the promise they made, the spark they’d reignited.

Tears slipped silently down her cheeks. She wasn’t sure who she was anymore, or what she truly wanted.

All she knew was that the life she’d built felt like a fragile house of cards — and one wrong move could bring it all crashing down.





















Chapter 10 – The Breaking Point

The argument started small.

A forgotten dinner plan. A misplaced key. Words said in frustration that spiraled into something neither Sophie nor Daniel wanted but both needed to release.

“I just don’t know if this is working anymore,” Sophie said, voice trembling but steady.

Daniel’s face tightened, a mix of hurt and anger flashing in his eyes. “What are you saying?”

Sophie looked away, tears blurring her vision. “I’m saying… I’m not happy. And I don’t know how to fix it.”

The silence that followed was deafening.

That night, Sophie didn’t go home. Instead, she found herself at Lena’s doorstep, heart pounding like a drum in her chest.

Lena opened the door before she could knock, her eyes wide with concern.

“Sophie?”

Without a word, Sophie stepped inside and into Lena’s arms, the walls she’d built around herself crumbling with each breath.

“I don’t know what to do,” she whispered, voice cracking. “Everything feels so broken.”

Lena held her tighter. “You’re not alone. Not anymore.”

For the first time in years, Sophie let herself believe that maybe, just maybe, there was a way forward — even if it meant letting go of the life she thought she wanted.




















Chapter 11 – Forty Approaches

The calendar on Sophie’s wall felt less like a schedule and more like a countdown—each day a small, heavy reminder that her fortieth birthday was closing in fast.

She traced a trembling finger over the circled date, heart fluttering with a mix of fear, hope, and something she couldn’t quite name.

In the quiet moments—early mornings before the city stirred, late nights when the world softened—her mind drifted to Lena. To the way her smile lit up a room, the gentle strength in her voice, the safety of her arms.

But just as often, her thoughts returned to Daniel—the life they’d built together, the shared memories, the easy routines.

The weight of choice pressed down on her chest, heavy and unrelenting. She was standing on the edge of everything familiar, staring into the unknown, unsure if the leap would lead to freedom or heartbreak.

One evening, Lena’s voice came softly over the phone, breaking through the swirl of doubt.

“We don’t have to follow the deal,” she said, words like a balm. “Unless you want to.”

Sophie closed her eyes, letting the warmth of Lena’s promise settle in her soul.

Maybe this wasn’t about pressure or deadlines. Maybe it was about courage—the courage to choose herself, to chase the life that made her heart beat faster.

The night stretched around her, filled with possibility.

And for the first time in a long time, Sophie felt the stirrings of hope.



















Chapter 12 – The Decision

The morning sun filtered softly through the curtains as Sophie sat at the kitchen table, hands wrapped around a warm mug.

Her heart was pounding — not with fear, but with something lighter, clearer.

Today was the day she’d promised herself she’d face the truth, no matter how uncertain the path ahead.

She glanced at her phone. A message from Lena: Ready when you are.

Sophie took a deep breath, then typed back: Me too.

Moments later, Lena was at her door, a bright smile and open arms waiting.

They didn’t need words — the quiet understanding between them said everything.

As they stepped outside together, Sophie felt the weight of years lift from her shoulders.

The promise made in youthful laughter had become something real — a chance to rewrite her story, to choose love on her own terms.

And as they walked into the sunlight, hand in hand, Sophie knew that sometimes, the backup plan was the truest plan of all.

1mor5g7,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1mor5g7,Amouage: Reception - Or Amouage Does Coffee (first impressions),"So this is this week’s new Amouage that’s exclusive to Harrods in the UK. I ordered a bottle to Australia and, well, I’m glad they packed it securely as per the second pic.

I was actually pretty excited about this one because there’s not many impressions online yet, so I was going in even blinder than usual, but also was keeping my hype in check because there’s note breakdown looked very similar to the last 4-5 releases from the house. Seriously, how many more bottles are going to feature palo santo, pine, fir, juniper, and/or sandalwood (and those are som of my favourite ingredients)?

This did supposedly have a coffee note though, which I was particularly interested in. Would this be a mild, woody sort of note like the hazelnut in Reasons, or would it be a bit more interesting than that?

Impressions:

So I’ve only worn this last night and today. I still need more time with it to understand the dry down, so for now this is more a quick impression. And that impression is…

COFFEE!!!

Wow. This one actually made me laugh out loud when I first sprayed it, I think because it was nothing like what I expected. This is purely a coffee fragrance. It’s not a supporting note or something you have to pretend you can smell, this is an espresso martini being thrown at your face. Loud, almost screechy in the intro. 

So, there is a lot going on here, but I really had to concentrate and study the notes to figure out exactly what. The first whiff you’ll get is a very rich, burnt caramel, bitter but sweet, espresso coffee note. It’s chocolatey. Dark chocolate. And more an espresso martini like coffee at the start. Strong and almost boozy. 

It’s the lemon, pine, and pink pepper that are making it so strong and sharp, but rarely do you catch those notes by themselves. These notes propel the fragrance at you and initially it projects quite a bit and, well, it’s a lot. It’s one of those fragrances that just blends together to create a single effect. Then there’s a sweet vanilla and patchouli that rounds out the base of the coffee hit. 
Now this lasts a while before it starts to dry down and out of all the notes it’s the pine that will occasionally stand out to me and add a little green and slight sourness to the coffee base. Everything else just blends in smoothly. 

In the dry down, which I’ve only fully experienced once it does gradually start to settle maybe a few hours in, and from there the coffee becomes less sharp and shouty and more of an Arabic dry, warm coffee like Xerjoff Golden Dallah (I unfortunately haven’t tried Xerjoff’s other coffee fragrances yet). 


Final thoughts:

Well, first off I’m grateful this is nothing at all like any other Amouage and that they’ve given us something different for the house. Not necessarily something that has been attempted before though. 

I did think it smelled a little sharp and synthetic when I first wore it, and not as warm and natural as the aforementioned Golden Dallah, but now I better understand how the notes are playing together I might be able to get past it. 

This is one of those Amouage I don’t think I’ll appreciate straight away and will take a couple of wears more wears before I’ll see where it falls in my rankings, but I’m really happy I’m not bored by it.

# How to Make Matcha‍ Latte: An Expert's Step-by-Step Guide

Matcha, a finely ground powder made from specially grown and processed green tea leaves, has transcended its traditional Japanese origins to become a global phenomenon, particularly in the form of ​the matcha ⁤latte. This vibrant green ​beverage offers‌ a​ unique combination of earthy, slightly bitter ⁤notes balanced by creamy sweetness, along with a sustained energy boost without the jitters frequently enough associated with coffee. Understanding the intricacies ‌of crafting a perfect matcha latte is​ key to unlocking its full potential,both in terms of ‌flavor⁤ and ⁢health benefits. This ⁤guide provides an expert, step-by-step ​breakdown ⁤to help you create a café-quality matcha latte ⁣in the comfort⁣ of your own home.**Understanding Matcha Quality and Selection**

The first crucial‍ step in making a tasty matcha latte is understanding the nuances of matcha quality. Not all matcha is created equal, and the grade and ‌origin significantly impact the taste, color,⁢ and overall experience.

Ceremonial grade matcha, derived from the youngest, most tender ⁢tea leaves, is‌ the highest quality available. It boasts ⁣a vibrant green color, a naturally sweet and delicate flavor, and a smooth, almost creamy texture.⁤ It's traditionally used in Japanese tea ceremonies and is best enjoyed on its own with hot water, although⁢ it can also be used in lattes.⁣ Culinary⁢ grade matcha, conversely, ⁢is sourced from older leaves and has a more robust, slightly bitter flavor, making ‌it ideal for‌ baking, smoothies, and, yes, lattes. Look for matcha that is stone-ground, as this process preserves⁢ the delicate flavors and⁢ nutrients. The origin also matters; matcha from Uji or Nishio in japan is generally considered superior due to the region's ideal growing conditions and centuries of expertise. When purchasing matcha, examine the color ⁤– it should be a vibrant, almost fluorescent green.A dull or ⁣yellowish tinge ‌indicates oxidation and lower quality.

**Essential ‍Equipment: A Matcha Latte Toolkit**

Gathering the right tools will make the ​matcha latte-making ​process smoother and more enjoyable. while some tools are optional, they contribute significantly to the final product's quality.A⁣ matcha whisk (chasen)​ is a bamboo ⁣whisk specifically designed for whisking matcha. Its delicate prongs create a⁤ smooth, frothy consistency, breaking up any clumps and ensuring the matcha is properly integrated into the water​ or⁢ milk. A matcha bowl (chawan) provides the ideal shape and depth for whisking matcha. Its wide,⁣ open design allows for efficient whisking and helps prevent spills.A tea scoop (chashaku) is used to measure the correct amount of matcha⁢ powder. typically, one and a half​ to two scoops ⁢are used per serving. A small sieve (optional​ but recommended) is used to ⁢sift the matcha ‌powder before whisking, further eliminating clumps and creating a smoother⁣ texture.A milk frother ⁤(optional) is‍ used to create a rich,⁤ creamy froth for the latte.⁢ While ⁤you can heat and whisk​ the ⁣milk manually, a frother provides consistently ‌excellent ⁣results. A thermometer (optional) is helpful for⁢ ensuring the milk is ⁢heated to ‌the ‌optimal temperature⁣ (around 150-160°F or 65-70°C) without scalding it.

**The Step-by-Step ‍Guide to Making ⁣a Perfect ⁣Matcha Latte**

Now, let's delve into the detailed steps of making a restaurant-worthy matcha latte.

Start by sifting the matcha powder. This crucial step removes any clumps and ​creates a ⁤smoother, more consistent texture. Place one to two ⁣teaspoons of matcha powder into a fine-mesh sieve and gently tap or shake it over your matcha bowl. Next,add hot water.Heat water to around 175°F ‍(80°C). avoid boiling water, as it can scorch the matcha and result in ‍a bitter taste. Pour approximately two ounces (60ml)⁣ of hot⁤ water into the matcha bowl. Whisk the matcha.Using your ‍matcha whisk, whisk the matcha and water together in a ""W"" or ""M"" motion. Ensure you whisk vigorously and avoid pressing the whisk against the‌ bottom of the‍ bowl.Continue whisking until a smooth, frothy paste forms, with ‌tiny bubbles on ⁤the surface. ⁤This concentrated ⁣matcha paste ‌is the base for your latte. Prepare your milk. Choose your preferred type of milk. Dairy⁤ milk, oat milk, almond milk, and soy milk all work well, each offering⁢ a unique flavor and texture. ⁢Heat⁣ the milk using a milk frother ‌or on the‌ stovetop,being careful not ⁣to scald ⁢it. If using a frother, froth until it's creamy and has a thick, stable foam. if heating on the‍ stovetop, heat gently and whisk vigorously to create some froth. Combine matcha and milk. Gently ​pour the steamed⁣ milk into the matcha⁢ bowl, ⁤holding back⁢ some of the froth.Alternatively, you can⁣ pour ‍the matcha concentrate into the ⁣milk.⁢ Top with froth. Spoon the remaining milk froth onto the top of the matcha latte. ⁤this adds a ‌visually appealing texture and enhances the creamy mouthfeel. Sweeten to taste (optional). If desired, add a sweetener of your choice. Maple syrup, agave nectar, honey, or simple ⁢syrup all work well.‍ Start with a small amount and adjust to your preference. Garnish (optional). You can ​garnish your matcha latte with a dusting of matcha‌ powder, a ⁣sprinkle of ‍cinnamon, or a ​drizzle of honey for an extra touch of elegance.

**Troubleshooting common ⁢Matcha Latte Problems**

Even with careful preparation, some common issues can arise when making matcha​ lattes. Understanding how to troubleshoot them will help you consistently achieve excellent results.

A bitter‍ taste is often caused by using low-quality matcha, using water that is too hot,⁢ or over-whisking the matcha. To avoid this,⁤ use high-quality ceremonial or culinary grade matcha,‍ ensure the water temperature is ⁣around 175°F ​(80°C), and whisk gently. A clumpy texture is usually due to unsifted matcha or insufficient whisking. Always sift⁤ the matcha powder before whisking, and whisk thoroughly until all the clumps are dissolved. A ⁤flat latte, lacking froth, can be caused by ⁣using cold ‌or old⁤ milk, insufficient⁣ frothing, or using the wrong type ⁢of milk. Ensure the milk is fresh and⁣ cold before frothing, use a powerful milk frother,​ and experiment with different types of‍ milk to find one that froths well. A weak matcha flavor can be due to using ‌too little matcha or using ​low-quality matcha. Use ⁢the ‍recommended amount⁢ of matcha ⁤powder (one to two teaspoons per serving) and‌ ensure you are using high-quality matcha.

**Exploring Variations and Enhancements**

Once you've mastered the basic matcha latte, you can explore various variations‍ and enhancements to customize it to your liking.

Iced matcha latte⁤ is ⁤a refreshing alternative to the traditional hot version. Simply prepare the matcha concentrate⁢ as⁤ described above, ⁤pour it over ice in a glass, and top with ‍cold milk. You can also add a scoop of ice ⁤cream for an extra indulgent‍ treat. Flavored ​matcha lattes⁣ are a fun way to​ experiment with different flavor combinations.Try ⁣adding a⁢ dash of vanilla extract, a sprinkle ⁤of cinnamon,⁤ or a pump of ⁣flavored syrup to your latte. You can also infuse the milk with spices such as cardamom or ginger for a more complex ⁢flavor profile. ‌Vegan ‌matcha lattes ⁤can be easily made by ⁢using plant-based milk​ alternatives such‌ as oat⁣ milk,almond milk,or soy milk. Many vegan sweeteners ⁢are also available, such as maple syrup, agave ⁤nectar, and stevia.‍ Matcha smoothies offer a healthy ‍and delicious way to incorporate matcha into your diet. Blend matcha powder with your favorite fruits, vegetables, and plant-based milk for a nutritious and energizing smoothie. Consider adding spinach, kale, banana, and berries for a nutrient-packed boost.

**Health Benefits of⁤ Matcha Lattes**

Beyond its delicious flavor and aesthetic appeal, the matcha latte offers a⁣ range of health benefits, making it a smart and satisfying beverage choice.

Matcha is rich in antioxidants, ⁣particularly ⁤catechins, which have been linked to various health benefits, including ⁢reduced risk ⁣of heart disease, cancer, ⁤and diabetes. The caffeine in matcha provides a sustained energy boost without the jitters and crashes associated with coffee.This ‍is‍ due to the presence of L-theanine, an amino acid that promotes relaxation and focus, counteracting the stimulating effects ‌of caffeine. Matcha can improve cognitive function, including memory, attention,⁤ and reaction time. The combination of caffeine and L-theanine works synergistically ​to enhance mental‌ clarity and alertness.Matcha‌ can boost metabolism and promote weight loss. Studies have shown ⁢that‍ matcha can increase⁣ fat oxidation and energy expenditure, making it ​a valuable addition to a weight management program. Matcha ⁤can ​support liver health by protecting against liver damage ‌and promoting detoxification.

**Conclusion: The Art of the Perfect Matcha Latte**

Mastering the art of making a matcha latte is more then just following a⁢ recipe; it's about understanding the nuances of matcha,‍ respecting the⁢ process, and⁤ experimenting with flavors ‍to create a ‍beverage that is both⁤ delicious and beneficial. From selecting high-quality matcha⁤ to carefully whisking and frothing, each step contributes to the‌ final product's quality. By ⁤following this expert guide and embracing the possibilities ‍for customization, you can elevate your matcha ⁢latte experience and enjoy a truly extraordinary cup every time.The matcha latte is not ⁤just‍ a drink; it’s​ a ritual, a moment of mindful indulgence that connects you to centuries of‌ tradition and​ the‌ vibrant energy of this unusual green tea.

I have never, in my life, tasted something SO AWFUL. You know how game cartridges are bitter? Like the little tiny ones? It’s bitter to keep children from eating them (so I’ve heard at least). It’s like that, but a thousand times worse. 

I’ve taken it with water, coffee, soda, etc. NOTHING MASKS IT. I’ve got two days left and I don’t think I’m gonna make it. Not only is it the most bitter thing I’ve ever tasted, it’s COATED in powder, which makes it still so much worse. I can feel it in my chest after taking it. 

I was also under the impression I couldn’t have sex while being treated for BV. I still think that’s right, but I could be wrong. I’m on norethindrone for birth control, but should I use condoms whenever I *do* finally have sex again? How soon is too soon to have sex once I’ve finished the antibiotic?

The morning was quiet.

Not peaceful quiet. Not the kind that made you think of coffee on the porch and dew on the grass. This was the kind of quiet that had weight to it, a quiet that made you feel like someone was holding their breath in the next room.

John Carter sat by the kitchen window of his farmhouse, one boot up on a chair, the other planted on the worn hardwood floor. The AR15 lay across his lap like an old friend — matte black with scratches along the stock, a custom foregrip, and an extended magazine. He ran a cloth down the barrel without really thinking about it, his eyes scanning the treeline through a slit in the boarded window.

It was muscle memory by now. In the Corps, they called it “situational awareness.” Out here, it was just staying alive.

The farmhouse sat a mile outside the dead city. Far enough to avoid the daily swarms, close enough to still hear the occasional gunshot drifting in on the wind. The place had been solid before he got his hands on it — reinforced now with steel-plated doors, boarded windows, and a crude perimeter fence made from scrap metal and razor wire scavenged from the old industrial park.

The scent inside was a mix of old wood, gun oil, and stale instant coffee.

He took a sip from the chipped green mug on the table. The coffee was bitter enough to curl his tongue. He grimaced, then took another drink anyway. It was the only thing left that still felt like a morning ritual.

Outside, the frost was beginning to melt, revealing patches of dead grass in the pale morning light. A few crows circled overhead — scavengers picking at whatever had died in the night.

That was the thing about quiet now: it didn’t mean safe. Quiet meant the predators were already in place.

John’s gaze caught movement near the north fence. Slow, staggering movement.

He set the mug down, slid the AR15 up, and peered through the scope. One of them — male once, now gray-skinned and slack-jawed, its jaw hanging slightly off-kilter like it had been broken and never set right. It wore a shredded flannel shirt, the sleeves dark with old blood. Its eyes were milky, blind-looking, but it turned toward the faint creak of the windmill with an unnatural awareness.

John exhaled and squeezed the trigger.

The rifle cracked. The infected’s skull erupted in a wet spray, and the body folded into the grass.

“Rise and shine,” John muttered. “And… well, just shine, I guess.”

He lowered the rifle, eyes still scanning. No others in sight.

The outbreak had come fast, faster than anyone wanted to admit. A month of rumors on the news, a week of panic buying and denial, and then three days of hell. The first wave wasn’t the infected — it was the living. Looters. Desperate parents. People who thought rules still applied and learned otherwise in a hurry.

He’d seen it before — different war, different enemies, but the same chaos.

John poured another cup of sludge from the coffee pot and was halfway through the first sip when he heard it.

Distant gunfire.

Not the clean, controlled bursts of trained soldiers — wild, panicked, erratic shots. The kind people made when they were cornered and about to be overwhelmed.

“Always somebody playing hero,” he muttered.

He set the mug down, slid the rifle’s sling over his shoulder, and strapped on his worn tactical vest. It was patched in three different places with duct tape, but it still held his mags snug and close.

Stepping out the side door, he locked it behind him with a padlock that wouldn’t stop a determined human but might slow them down.

The air outside had that faint metallic tang he’d come to associate with death. The frost crunched under his boots as he moved toward the road.

The city was silent in the way cemeteries are silent — heavy and still, as if the air itself was tired.

John kept to the side streets, moving between the hulks of rusted cars. Shop windows were nothing but jagged teeth of glass, and the smell of old smoke clung to the brickwork. Somewhere far off, a metal door banged in the wind.

He rounded a corner and saw her.

A slender woman crouched near the overturned shelves of a pharmacy, stuffing supplies into a torn duffel. Her hair was pulled into a messy bun, strands hanging loose against her pale face. A SIG 551 hung from a sling at her side, not in her hands — like she either didn’t expect trouble or was too busy to care.

She didn’t see the two infected moving in from the alley behind her.

John raised his rifle. The first shot took the left one in the temple, dropping it mid-step. The second caught the other just above the eye, snapping its head back with a wet crack.

The woman spun, eyes wide behind smudged glasses.

“You’re welcome,” John said, lowering his rifle. “You planning to keep standing there, or do I have to shoot anything else for you today?”

She clutched the duffel tighter. “I didn’t ask for your help.”

“Lady, nobody asks for help anymore. You just take it and try not to get killed.”

Her gaze flicked to his rifle, then back to his face. No thank you, no explanation — just a silent assessment.

John gestured to the SIG 551. “Nice hardware. Hope you know how to use it.”

Her lips twitched — almost a smirk — but she said nothing.

That was fine by him.

He’d learned a long time ago that the quiet ones were either the most dangerous people in the room… or the most broken.

Either way, he figured he’d find out soon enough.

Chapter 2 — The Scientist and the Soldier

The pharmacy smelled like damp cardboard and mold. The air was heavy, humid, the way old buildings get when the weather turns and no one’s opened a window in months.

Amanda crouched on the floor, sorting through the mess she’d swept into her duffel — bandages, antiseptic, a few bottles of antibiotics that hadn’t been smashed or looted yet.

John stood by the doorway, back to the wall, AR15 held in a relaxed but ready position. His eyes swept the street outside every few seconds. You didn’t linger in one place if you could help it — not unless you wanted company.

“You a doctor?” he asked.

“Biochemist,” she said, without looking up. Her tone was quiet, matter-of-fact.

He smirked. “Biochemist. So… you’re out here mixing test tubes while the world’s gone to hell?”

Amanda’s gloved hands moved methodically, inspecting each box and bottle like she had a checklist in her head. “I’m studying the cause of the infection. The neurological structure is… unusual.”

“Studying?” He snorted. “What are you gonna do, write a strongly worded letter to the zombies?”

That earned him a flat glance over the rim of her glasses. “If I find the neurological trigger, I might be able to stop it.”

John shook his head. “Lady, I’ve seen what’s out there. Ain’t no science fixing that mess.”

She didn’t answer, just went back to her sorting.

When the bag was finally zipped shut, she slung it over her shoulder and stood. The SIG 551 bumped lightly against her hip. John noticed she carried it like someone who knew what it weighed, not like a scavenger who’d just found a shiny gun.

“You military?” she asked.

“Retired Marine sergeant,” he said. “Now full-time pest control.” He patted the AR. “This beauty here does most of the talking for me.”

Amanda’s gaze lingered on it. “AR15? Modified gas system. Heavy barrel. Good choice for stability.”

He stopped mid-step, arching an eyebrow. “Well, color me surprised. You actually know your guns.”

“I know what works,” she said simply, moving toward the door.

John followed her outside, scanning the street. The morning had turned grayer, the sun hidden behind a layer of clouds that felt too low.

“So where’s your safe spot?” he asked, as they stepped over the corpse of the infected he’d shot.

“I don’t have one,” she said.

He looked at her. “You just… wander?”

“I travel,” she corrected. “There are still labs intact. Places where I can gather data.”

John shook his head. “You sound like a woman who hasn’t been jumped by a survivor gang yet.”

“I’ve been jumped,” she said quietly. “They’re not around anymore.”

He studied her out of the corner of his eye. She didn’t look like she was lying.

A groan echoed down the street — low, wet, and too close. John’s rifle came up instantly. A lone infected shuffled into view, its clothes caked with dried gore, one arm hanging by a thread of tendon.

John sighted in, but Amanda’s rifle was already at her shoulder. One clean shot through the eye, and the thing dropped like a puppet with its strings cut.

John lowered his weapon slowly. “Well, damn, Doc. You’re just full of surprises.”

She didn’t even glance at him. “That’s not my name.”

“I know.” He grinned faintly. “But ‘Doc’ rolls off the tongue better than ‘mysterious stranger who might be a mad scientist.’”

For the first time, the corner of her mouth twitched. It wasn’t quite a smile, but it was close enough to make him wonder.

They moved together through the streets for the rest of the day, neither offering much in the way of conversation. Every so often, John caught her looking at him — not like she was trying to figure him out, but like she was cataloguing him, the same way she’d looked at the supplies in the pharmacy.

By the time they reached the edge of the industrial district, the light was fading. The rusted skeletons of warehouses loomed overhead, their broken windows staring down like dead eyes.

“This place clear?” she asked.

“No such thing anymore,” he said, “but it’s better than being out in the open.”

They slipped into a warehouse whose big steel door hung crooked on its hinges. Inside, it was dark except for the thin shafts of gray light streaming through the high windows. Old pallets and rusted machinery cluttered the floor.

They found a corner that was defensible and set up for the night.

John stripped down his AR, cleaning it with practiced efficiency. Amanda sat with her back to the wall, quietly eating from a can of beans she’d pried open with a multi-tool.

“You always this talkative?” John asked.

She swallowed her mouthful before answering. “Talking doesn’t help. Doing does.”

He looked at her for a long moment. Then he smirked. “Fair enough, Doc. Fair enough.”

Chapter 3 — Blood and Concrete

The deeper they went, the heavier the air seemed to get.

Downtown had always been crowded even before the world fell apart — people shoulder to shoulder, streets crammed with cars and buses. Now it was crowded in a different way. Every block was a mass grave. Vehicles sat frozen mid-escape, some with doors hanging open, others wrapped around light poles or each other in mangled heaps. Broken glass glittered on the pavement like frost.

John moved through it like a man walking a minefield, his AR15 shouldered, scanning every angle. Amanda kept pace beside him, her SIG 551 hanging low, ready but not in her hands. Her eyes, hidden behind those smudged glasses, were constantly flicking — windows, rooftops, alleys.

She was quiet, but it wasn’t the kind of quiet that came from fear. It was calculation.

The city smelled like rot and rain. Somewhere in the distance, a single gunshot rang out, then silence swallowed it.

They turned a corner and the sound hit them — a low, wet snarl followed by rapid footfalls. Two infected burst from a side alley.

The first one was on them in seconds, sprinting like its tendons hadn’t rotted at all. John swung his rifle up and fired, the shot cracking through its temple. It dropped instantly, momentum carrying it face-first into the pavement.

The second was faster. It lunged at Amanda, arms outstretched — and she didn’t even flinch. The SIG came up in a blur, one precise shot between the eyes. The impact snapped its head back, and it collapsed mid-stride, skidding across the asphalt.

John froze for half a second, blinking at her. “Well, damn, Doc, you didn’t put that on your résumé.”

“I didn’t think it was relevant,” she replied without breaking stride.

They kept moving, weaving between wrecked vehicles until they reached an intersection. A burned-out police cruiser sat sideways across the road, its doors riddled with bullet holes. Flies swarmed thick around what was left of the officers inside.

Amanda’s gaze lingered for only a moment before she stepped over the bloodstained pavement. John noted how steady she was — no hesitation, no gagging. Not her first time seeing a mess like that.

By late afternoon, they found shelter in what had once been a clothing store. Half the mannequins still stood in the window, their blank faces streaked with soot, their clothes stiff with dust. John pushed a display case in front of the doors and wedged it with a metal bar.

Inside, the place was quiet except for the soft drip of water somewhere in the back. The air was stale, but it didn’t stink like death — yet.

John took a seat on the floor near the entrance, stripping down his AR15. Amanda sat against a wall, knees drawn up, methodically inspecting her rifle.

“You know,” John said, “you’re either the quietest scientist I’ve ever met or the most stubborn. Can’t tell which.”

Amanda didn’t look up. “Talking doesn’t help. Doing does.”

John smirked faintly. “That’s a real cheery philosophy, Doc.”

She finally looked at him, and for just a moment there was the faintest glimmer of humor in her eyes. “I’m still alive, aren’t I?”

“Fair point.”

Outside, the wind shifted, carrying the faint moan of something moving through the streets. John glanced toward the door.

“Get some rest,” he said. “Tomorrow’s going to be worse.”

Amanda nodded once, but he noticed she didn’t close her eyes.

Chapter 4 — Conversations in the Dark

The mechanic’s garage smelled of rust, oil, and old dust.

They’d found it on the edge of the industrial district, its roll-up door stuck halfway down, just enough to crawl under. Inside, the shadows were thick, and the air was still. Rows of rusted tools hung from pegboards like the bones of some extinct creature.

John swept the place once, making sure there were no surprises. Just a couple of rats in the corner, scurrying behind an overturned oil drum.

Amanda settled against a workbench, setting her SIG across her lap. She pulled a small notebook from her bag and started scribbling, her pencil scratching in short, precise bursts.

John raised an eyebrow. “What’s that? Zombie poetry?”

She didn’t look up. “Notes.”

“On what?”

“Behavior patterns. How they move. How they react to sound.” She paused, then added without looking at him, “And how quickly they decay after death.”

John snorted. “That’s the cheeriest bedtime reading I’ve heard in a while.”

She kept writing.

He dropped his pack to the floor and sat cross-legged near the tool bench, pulling out a canteen. “So, Doc, where were you when this whole mess started?”

She glanced up briefly. “In a lab. In Chicago.”

“You make it out alone?”

“Yes.”

Her answers were clipped, deliberate.

John took a swig from the canteen and leaned back against the wall. “You know, most people talk more when they’ve been on the road with someone a couple days. Especially after you’ve saved each other’s asses twice.”

Amanda’s pencil stopped moving. “Talking doesn’t change the facts. It just wastes energy.”

He smirked. “You really are allergic to small talk, aren’t you?”

She closed the notebook, sliding it back into her bag. “When people talk too much, they miss details.”

There was something in the way she said it that made him pause. She wasn’t just being antisocial. She was always processing, always scanning — like him, but for different things.

“Alright,” John said, resting his forearms on his knees. “I’ll go first. Since you clearly aren’t gonna volunteer anything.”

Her gaze stayed on him, unreadable.

“Marine Corps, fifteen years. Couple tours overseas. Retired after my knee took a bullet from some kid who couldn’t have been more than eighteen. Came home, tried the quiet life. Bought a farmhouse. Thought I’d get old watching corn grow.” He chuckled dryly. “Guess the world had other plans.”

Amanda didn’t react at first, but he thought he saw the faintest flicker of something — recognition, maybe.

“And you?” he prompted.

She hesitated, then spoke softly. “I was part of a research team. Government funded. Studying viral mutation patterns. We’d been tracking an anomaly for months before the first outbreak.”

John raised an eyebrow. “So you saw this coming?”

Her eyes dropped to the floor. “Not like this.”

The silence that followed was heavier than before.

He let it sit for a while, the only sound the occasional drip of water from somewhere in the garage. Then he said, “So what’s the endgame, Doc? You gonna find a cure?”

She looked up, meeting his eyes for the first time without that detached scientist’s stare. “If there’s a way to stop it, I’ll find it.”

It wasn’t bravado. It was conviction.

John leaned back, watching her for a moment before saying, “Well… I guess I’ve hitched my wagon to crazier people before.”

That earned him the barest ghost of a smile.

The wind picked up outside, rattling the roll-up door in its track. Amanda shifted her rifle into easy reach. John did the same with his AR. Neither of them spoke for the rest of the night, but the silence felt… less cold than before.

She sat down at her desk and took a few sips from an oversized coffee mug. A large pile of mail and paperwork sat in front of her, bidding her a good morning. She sighed and started sifting through the mound of wasted trees.

Most of it was administrative paperwork that needed her corrections and signature. She started a pile to the left.

The junk mail found its way to the shredder, unopened. Occasionally a letter fooled her, looking official enough to warrant a second glance before then being shredded.

A new missing persons case—a blonde 12 year old named Mary Tanner—got its own pile.

Toward the bottom of the mound she pulled out a bubble mailer. She cut open the top and tipped it. A hinged silver case wrapped in blue velvet fell out onto the desk.

She picked it up and ran her fingers along the fabric. The case felt weighty and expensive. She flipped it open. Sitting in black satin was a pink fountain pen.

She chuckled and pulled it out. The body and cap were pink with silver accents. It felt just as high quality as the case. ""Marigold"" was engraved on the lower end of the body. She grabbed some scrap paper and wrote ""This pen is amazing!"" in cursive. The pen glided easefully without any hitches or catches. The ink was a vibrant blue.

She smiled and decided to bless her paperwork with the extravagance of her new writing utensil.

Her signatures came out smooth and silky. Her notes crisp and clear. The pen never dropped too much ink or scratched the paper. The more she signed her name, the more comfortable it felt in her hand.

After working her way through several documents she noticed the ink started to look more purple than blue. She wondered to herself if administration would complain about the non-standard ink color.

After another few documents, the ink was dark red. She pinched the bridge of her nose and capped the pen. They definitely wouldn't like her signing in red. Annoyed, she put the pen back in the case and snapped it shut.

She looked inside the bubble mailer one last time and saw a piece of paper stuck there. She reached in and plucked it before feeding the mailer to the shredder.

She unfolded the paper and read it. Her face paled, then she hastily ran from the room.

…

My name is Marigold. I was sold when I was 12 years old.

He paid my mommy a small fee, then she never came to find me.

He took my blood and made some ink, then put it in a pen that's pink.

With that pen, I write this note, and after I'm done, he'll cut my throat.

My name was Mary, but mommy called me Marigold. When I died, I was only 12 years old.",13,1755047902.0,shortscarystories,0,1.0,False
