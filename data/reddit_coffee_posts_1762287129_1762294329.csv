1ookyaq,https://i.redd.it/8ifck4p3dbzf1.png,I built a sleep tracker that grows a virtual forest to keep you consistent. Lifetime premium free for first 500 people!,"What's up? I'm an indie dev who got tired of my own crappy sleep habits, so I made Sleep Forest. It's basically a sleep app that turns getting better rest into something fun by letting you grow a virtual forest. Hit your sleep goals each week, plant trees, unlock cool species, that kinda thing. No boring graphs, just watching your progress sprout up.

It helps with stuff like:

1. Knowing what to do for better sleep but sucking at sticking to it. The forest growth gives you that nudge to keep going without feeling like a chore.
2. Feeling like certain things mess with your sleep (late coffee? stress?) but not really nailing down why. It digs into your data to quantify what's actually throwing you off.
3. Building a routine that adapts over time. It looks at your past sleeps and tweaks suggestions, like shifting your wind-down or adding quick breathing stuff that worked before.

Takes about 1-2 weeks to get calibrated to you, then it starts giving real insights and maybe some changes if needed.Oh, and it's all phone-based right now, so great if you don't have an Apple Watch or anything. If folks end up liking it a ton, I'll look into adding HealthKit/Watch support down the line.

Normally premium's $9.99/month or $69.99/year (with a quick 3-day trial), but I'm unlocking lifetime access for free for the first 5000 people. No tricks, just download and sign up.

July 5, 2025 - 11:12PM

Worcester was starting to quiet down for the night when an ambulance sped through the mildly congested four lane road and the night crowd spilled onto the sidewalks from bars, walking sideways and laughing like hyenas as they made their way down Canal Street. A police cruiser sat idling in the Dunkin Donuts parking lot, two cops drank coffee while one of them bragged about slamming a guy’s head onto the hood of his car.

Miles moved like a ghost. His heavy work boots echoing as he passed beneath Pigeon Bridge, the railroad overpass cut over Southbridge Street carrying railcars full of lumber and steel to places like neighboring Auburn or further down the line to Providence. Tonight he was supposed to be on the clock but his mind wandered and he found himself thinking about his dreams. The forest and the moon, the earth itself opening wide and pulling him down into the abyss. 

They’ve been becoming a part of the routine these days and Miles was tired of waking up in the middle of the night in a cold sweat, his bedsheets clinging to him like the thick vines in his dreams. 

He was in South Worcester, about a half mile from College Hill when he spotted it. A tuned-up turbocharged Honda Civic that had been on his radar for months now. Miles stuffed his dreams into the back of his mind, the same dusty corner he kept memories of Afghanistan, prison and most of his childhood. 

Miles made note of the parking lights and studied his surroundings. The faint sound of music drifted into the summer night, the electric buzz of air conditioners and the sound of traffic drowned his footsteps as he moved closer to his target. He gripped the RD-30 radio frequency detector in his pocket and swept the car. Everyone these days was using Airtags to track everything: cell phones, luggage or cars. This one didn't appear to be tagged, no signals.

Clean. 

He took a final glance around the parking lot, pulled on a pair of white latex gloves and had the door open in under twenty seconds. Slim jim, quick slide, no wasted motion. Miles hadn’t broken a sweat, it had become almost automatic for him, like tying his shoes or rolling a joint. 

He slid the seat back and popped the steering column cover with his screwdriver. With a yank and a tug he found the ignition and ground and twisted the wires together with the wisdom of an electrician. The engine coughed once, then caught. The exhaust a low growl in the empty lot.

He sat for a moment, staring through the windshield at the empty block. Boredom crept in around the edges. This wasn’t hard. It wasn’t even interesting. But it was work, and work kept him moving. It helped to keep the dreams at bay. 

He rolled down his window and shut the door before shifting it into drive. He kept the halogens off until he hit the city streets, the Honda tearing off into the night past sagging triple-decker apartments, chain link fences and red brick buildings. The streets never really went to sleep in Worcester, Miles drifted up Jackson towards Hermon and Junction passing prostitutes and hordes of half-conscious junkies shuffling up and down the sidewalks. The summer air smelled like hot tar, garbage and the sharp edge of fried food from a 24-hour joint that had seen more overdoses than birthdays.

He drove without looking at the speedometer, hands loose on the wheel. He had a customer that was always looking for “discount” tuner parts. Miles did the math in his head as he mentally stripped the car into pieces. Engine Control Units, intake manifolds, exhaust headers - the engine and turbo could net him a pretty penny. It wasn’t hitting the lottery but it paid the bills.

He had forgotten about the forest and the roots reaching for him. He snapped the throttle and opened it up, letting the hot summer air whip through the car as he approached the operating table: a six bay garage that operated as a local shop by day and hummed with activity at night for mechanics who, like Miles, liked to put in the “extra hours”.

Junction and Hermon was a scab of warehouses and chain linked fences pressed up against the rail line. The place was a historic site dressed like an industrial graveyard. The city loomed in the distance, its lights polluting the night sky above while traffic and nightlife had become little more than an afterthought. 

The lot was empty when Miles turned in and killed the lights, the Honda crawled through like a thief in the night. He swung open the steel gate and then passed by shipping containers and heaping piles of scrap metal; a collection of exhaust parts and brake rotors, a wall of bald tires and engine blocks bleached under the moonlight. 

He killed the engine twenty feet out, letting momentum carry him to the bay. He gave the garage door a solid pound with his knuckles. A bolt scraped, a chain lifted, and Hector leaned out, cigarette glowing orange between two fingers.

“Oh man,” Santos said with a smile, “you finally got the Honda.” The Puerto Rican wore his stained coveralls half-zipped, his hands black with grease.

“My bike broke down,” he smiled. The bay door rattled closed and slammed on the concrete. Santos slid the bolt and locked the door.

The garage smelled like chemical solvents and diesel fuel, the perfume of auto mechanics everywhere between here and Saigon. Miles rolled the Civic to the center lift. Fluorescent bulbs buzzed to life overhead, painting every dent and drip in sanitized white light.

“You want coffee?” Hector asked as he shuffled over to his bay. 

“No,” Miles said, “I want that Charger and a blowjob from Sydney Sweeny,” he smiled. 

“Maybe tomorrow,” Hector said as he disappeared under the hood of a pickup truck. 

Miles punched in and went to work. He opened the red steel toolbox and placed the signal detector in its black plastic case before ditching the hoodie. Step one included removing and destroying the plates and any identifying paper work. The plates got crushed and the papers burned. Registration, proof of insurance, even the car handbook had to go. Personal effects were either burned or tossed in a dumpster off the property. 

Miles combed through the car, he kept the latex gloves on as he dove between the seats and the cup holders. Everything had to go. Auxiliary cables and change was about all he allowed himself to keep. In about ten minutes Miles had everything that wasn’t bolted down into a black plastic industrial trash bag.

Steps two and three tended to be one long process of stripping VIN numbers and salvaging valuable parts. This one had quite a few of both. Miles took a knee and set up the lift. The rims and tires, the brakes, the exhaust would all go. Miles had a whole network of opportunistic dealers and car enthusiasts that would pay a reasonable sum of money for expensive parts.

Hector came wandering over with a fresh cup of coffee in a mug stained with black fingerprints. “Jackpot, amigo, you hit gold with this one.”

“Help me with the hood,” Miles asked as he zipped off the mounting bolts. 

“Fiberglass. That will sell quick.”

The two men move without a word as they peel it off the car.  

Hector had a guy for everything Miles couldn’t move, it was a profitable and friendly business for the pair. They began running through parts and prices as Miles disconnected lines and drained fluids but when Santos had claimed his haul he found his way out of the garage and into his cluttered office where he sat making calls and drinking cold beer from his mini-fridge, leaving Miles alone with his thoughts. 

He pulled the wheels and began breaking the tires down. A grand easily between rims and tires. He could probably get more if he sold them online but that would be a risk and Miles didn't take unnecessary risks. His hands moved on autopilot as he dismantled the brake system. The rotors were scrap but the performance calipers would eventually move. Miles thought of his adopted mother and what she would think if she saw him now. She might even be proud of him and the way he tagged every part and meticulously kept his tools.

Mrs. Reed was one half of a couple too old to have kids of their own. A small town just outside of Coldwater, Maine. His adopted brother Lenny struggled to meet her particularly high standards while Miles adapted. Mr. Reed had been a soldier in Korea and a painter in northern Maine. There had been a proud smile on his face when Miles boarded the bus bound for Fort Benning, Georgia. It had been the last time he had seen either of them. 

He still talked to Lenny. Once a year, maybe. 

Miles put the car in the air and started pulling the exhaust. He didn’t waste time with any of it, he had the resonator and muffler on the ground in five minutes flat, he cut the catalytic out with a sawzall and tossed it on his tool cart. The aftermarket suspension came out next. Labelled and binned. He peeled VIN numbers as he went or chiseled them into nothingness with his air hammer. 

Cutting and pulling was mechanics. Moving it was business. His short time in prison had made him a few friends and a lot of business partners. Guys with a skillset like his were a rare find in certain circles and Miles didn’t have a problem getting his hands dirty or finding work. Depending on the job. He wasn’t a murderer but if it involved stealing from people, Miles was the man to call. 

He carefully removed the aftermarket lights, he tore the door panels off and pulled speakers. In the bucket it went. He pulled wiring harnesses, tagged them and bagged them. The aftermarket radio. Gone. Miles moved quickly, if it didn’t sell it was cut off or torn off. A collection of battered door panels collected on the oil-stained concrete beside countless body clips and useless components. Airbag and security system. Bag it and tag it. He pulled fuse boxes and control modules, laid them out like a nervous system.

The clock was ticking. By the witching hour he went to work pulling the engine and transmission. Subframe drop. Miles’ ratchet slipped off the motor mount bolt, his hand slipped and opened his knuckle. 

He cursed. 

As he wrapped his finger he leaned back on the sink and thought about Afghanistan. At first he thought about broken down Humvees. Overheating. Electrical issues and clogged air filters. Even the Ma Deuce was prone to jamming, gun oil turning to clay from dust and sand. He thought about his squad, faces in the desert and the day he went head first into an exploding steel door. A moment frozen in time like slow motion. The medic had told him he was lucky. He thought about cold nights, when those three pieces of shrapnel in his ribs sent waves of sharp, freezing pain through him. 

By five o’clock in the morning the Honda was gutted. Parts labelled and shelves stocked. All that remained was a skeletal husk and a black industrial trash bag.

He found Hector in his office, beer in hand watching highlights from last night's Red Sox game playing on a television the size of a shoebox. 

“Beer?” Hector nodded at the mini-fridge by his desk. 
Miles nodded, wiping his brow of sweat.

“I’m thinking five for all of it,” Miles said. He gave the bottle a twist, tossed the cap and knocked it back.

Santos sat motionless. “Two,” he said.

Miles narrowed his eyes and he made a face, “Yeah, Alright Hector,” he said. “I can get two for the wheels and tires alone. Shit, maybe I’ll piece it myself.”

A smile formed. Hector countered, “Tres, amigo.”

Miles laughed, “keep it coming.”

They settled at thirty-five. Not bad for an honest night’s work. Business settled, the deal was done. Miles would have another envelope coming his way by the end of the week. Probably.

The men moved methodically. A familiar routine. Whatever remained was placed into the shell of the car, panels, broken clips, floor mats and carpet. An unceremonious return. Hector opened the bay door and slipped out before he returned a moment later behind the wheels of an ancient forklift. 

“I love this part,” he grinned, his single gold tooth catching the fluorescent lights as he positioned the forks under the steel frame. 

Miles watched as he rolled away, carrying it away like a corpse and dumping the remains into the hydraulic baler. A clunk of a fuse box and the press of a button later and the metal skeleton was compressed into a cube the size of a bedframe. 

The morning air was refreshing after a humid night. 

Miles stretched his back and moved slowly to the rusty sink in the corner of the shop. The cold water squeaked out of a faucet that wobbled in its mounting. He was washing his hands and rebandaging his cut when the burner phone in his toolbox vibrated. 

Ray.

Headin to the Red Lite. Got Work

He was a character. One of the only friends Miles had on the street or above ground and he valued the man’s loyalty - even if his mouth never seemed to shut. Ray was like an autistic brother without the brainpower of Rain-Man. Ray’s super power was the uncanny ability to do cocaine and flirt with waitresses. 

It was seven o’clock when the day shift drifted into the garage. Miles opened a pill bottle pulled from his toolbox and swallowed a vicodin before finally locking up. He gave a nod to the head mechanic who shuffled in with a blank expression and a hot coffee before making a quick stop in the main office. 

“I’m out. I'll see you later,” he waved.

Hector gave him a nod.

Outside the sky was a pale blue with gray clouds. The news said the city was in the middle of a heat wave, the morning air heavy and humid already. 

Miles moved through the yard, his eyes locked on his one true love: a 1985 flat black Oldsmobile Cutlass. It had been a project of his for years now. The door opened with a clunk and he stepped into the maroon interior and turned the key over; the beast roared to life with a mean throaty growl. He shifted into gear and pulled off into the early morning traffic.

By Thornly.B.Siddhartha

© November 2025

 

This morning, I got up, made my breakfast, and while drinking Mother’s Milk—50-weight-industrial-strenght French Roasted black coffee with honey—I watched a quick video of a man who had an encounter with a Bigfoot.  (See video: [https://youtu.be/Qj6i5H7rrKo?si=Lk7qBFy2cPBQGiyD](https://youtu.be/Qj6i5H7rrKo?si=Lk7qBFy2cPBQGiyD) )

While I watched and listened to his story, I began to think about all the Star Trek and Sci-Fi conventions I’ve been to.  The one thing I find odd about these people, like me, is we seem to lack a cohesiveness with the different groupings of Sci-Fi-fans, yet we all love Sci-Fi.  No, it’s not all the crazy costumes, families speaking Vulcan, or the sexy Klingon women with th-th-their…*robustness*…naaa, it’s how we all treat one another, and that includes the UFO/UAP Group.

You want to know why it’s taken 8 decades to get this far, because we all attack one another.  If it isn’t a full-frontal *Argumentum Ad Hominem* assault, then it’s that calm, indirect, and subtle cynicism packaged all up, and passive-aggressively proffered.   You hear all the Podcasters and YouTubers say it.  Take Ross Coulthart on NewsNation, for example, he has stated many times that we’re “brutal” with one another.  You hear it from Richard Dolan, George Knapp, Linda Moultin Howel, and Jeremy Corbell. We can’t move forward with our movement because in order for something to move forward, you are going to proverbially get out of the car, walk around the back of it, and with all our strength, we, in unison, push.   We don’t have that, and until we support one another beyond just being under the umbrella of “UFO/UAP Disclosure,” this car won’t move the way we want it to move.

So, there I was watching this video, of a man trying to tell his Bigfoot story, and the next thought, after I fully realized that we really don’t have a well-organized, well-connected groupings of people, who won’t waste time attacking one another, the very next thought was:  was, “Boy!  I’m glad I’m not that guy.”

That’s when the content for this cartoon strip came to mind.  I told Google’s Gemini how I wanted it to look—I think I still have the window up—and Gemini did all the artwork.  Give credit where credit is due: I cannot draw, but I can write…and Gemini worked with me to produce this…

1ookpu4,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1ookpu4,"A question about covers, materials, and editions of a 1955 science book","Hello all! This is kind of a long shot but I was wondering if anyone had any information regarding this. If you happen to have this particular book it would help immensely!

The coffee-table Life natural history book ""The World We Live In"" (1955) appears to have been published in two editions. Both appear to use the same burgundy/red ""leather"" binding (more on the scare quotes later).

\- One of them is half bound in that ""leather"", the other half is cloth, with the title set to the left (see image). This seems to be the version that came with a cardboard slipcase.

\- The other is fully bound in ""leather"" with the title centered (see image). This one does not seem to have come with a slipcase, but it may have been the one that had a dust jacket. Dust jackets do not seem to have been attached to the slipcase edition, but then again they appear to be very rare.

So my questions are:

\- What exactly is the material the covers are made of? I'm assuming it's not real leather (hence the scare quotes) but what would it be considered? Plastic? Leatherette? Bonded leather? 

\- Knowing the above, would one version of the book be more valuable/higher quality than the other? I know half-cloth/leather bindings are compromises but if it's not proper leather does it really matter?

\- Finally, Time-Life is notoriously bad at cataloguing their own releases, but would anyone happen to know if those were released simultaneously? Or was one an earlier release and the other a later one? Would there be any way to know?

Any advice would help. Thank you!",1,1762293640.0,BookCollecting,1,1.0,False

We live two hours away from the nearest city or big town, so there’s really no temptation for things like take out, coffees or shopping runs. Our biggest spending area is groceries typically. 

All those factors included, we’re able to stretch our budget quite far and make it work. I’m a big fan of shopping second hand and hunting for sales and clearance bargains, which also helps. That leaves us with enough for one vacation a year and money left over for some “treat purchases”. I’ve seen some posts before that act like it’s basically impossible to be a SAHM on an income of less than 100k, and that’s probably true for many places that have high costs of living, maybe we’re just lucky where we are, but I’m curious to hear of others on similar incomes and how you also manage to make it work.

1ookngs,https://www.reddit.com/r/loseit/comments/1ookngs/is_there_anything_i_could_be_doing_differently/,Is there anything I could be doing differently?,"Hello All,

Recently I decided to finally get rid of my modest beer belly and get some more muscle. After the first few days I lost about 4 pounds of what I assume is water weight. It’s now been 3 weeks since that happened, and my weight has hovered around the same 233lbs and my stomach feels looser/flabby-er which I assume is a good sign but not really any change on the scale or my measurements. I don’t seem to be losing fat or gaining any noticeable muscle. I know it’s only been like 3 weeks so if I just need to wait it out longer, let me know. 

My plan has been:
1. Eating 300 calories less than my BMR
2. Progressive overload weights and 40 minutes walking incline treadmill 5 days a week.
3. Minimum of 180g of protein a day. 
4. Drinking 80oz of water minimum.
5. Trying to stay under 150g of carbs daily but not going down to Keto levels of carb-cutting.
6. Really only eating chicken and vegetables and a little fruit and some low carb/high fiber tortillas used for tacos some days.
7. Very low sugar in my diet, only drink coffee, almond milk, water and diet soda.
8. And yes, I’m using a food scale for my cooking at home, so I can’t be way off on my calorie intake.

Curious if anyone has suggestions or if I’m on the right track and just need to keep at it, thanks everyone!

1ookld4,https://www.reddit.com/r/confessions/comments/1ookld4/it_makes_me_happy_when_the_staff_gets_upset_about/,It makes me happy when the staff gets upset about my attendence.,"I work as a controller for a factory. We had a rough year, with economic headwinds, layoffs, and a number of challenges that I'm sure we all felt. From Feburary to August, I averaged 68 per week in office, and it burned me out. Lately, troubles have faded away. My team found creative solutions to our problems, we found more efficient processes, and we shifted to mostly domestic suppliers. In turn, we were able to recall 100% of the people laid off, and we ended up increasing revenue YoY. 

For the first 8 months of the year, while I was working my ass off, many of the functional managers had the opportunity to slack off. They had fewer people to manage, a slower pace, and plenty of excuses for doing as little as possible.

 ""We're out of x, so we can't really do anything today. Housekeeping is on the schedule, but I told the guys to bring some cards and something to do.""

""I know I don't have much to do today, but the project you're working on is outside of my area of expertise, and I'm afraid if I help out, I'll just drag progress down."" 

I didn't really mind. I prefer minding my own business. I would've done the same thing. 

At the beginning of October, I was given an individual award for my dedication and my effort. My team was all given bonuses for keeping the doors open at a time when our executive management was considering moving our operations elsewhere. 

And since then, I've been slacking off. I show up to work 4 days per week. Mondays and Fridays are slow anyways, so I spend one of them with my fiance or literally just hanging out. I take 2 hours in the middle of every day to myself. I go for a run with my dog. I meet a friend for some food. I stop off at my lady's work place and surprise her with a coffee. 

I have no set schedule. Doing my job correctly requires a lot of autonomy and fluidity. I attend meetings, I'm hands on often, and I do a good job (or so I've been told). Two of my bosses are fully remote, and my third boss stays in the loop, but I only see him two or three times a week, for an informal check in, usually standing in the break room while I fill up my water or something. I have the trust to do what I need to do to keep the doors open, and I take a little bit of pride in the quality of work, so no one feels the need to babysit me. 

My job continues to get done. My bosses know I'm not around and they don't care. I'm free. The two people who report to me directly are also enjoying a little R&R too. We earned it if you ask me. 

The best part is how angry and spiteful the other management teams have become. I love the random questions I receive... 

""So no one keeps track of how long you're gone for lunch?"" No, and no one cares. Neither should you, Cindy. Focus on health on safety.

""Hey did you see the email I sent you? You weren't in the office so I don't know."" Do you mean the email I responded to already? Did you refresh your inbox between yesterday and today? 

""We wanted to give you the opportunity to weigh in on this, but you weren't here."" You mean the item that pertains to your team, that I've never weighed in on before? 

I love it. I love the bitterness. I believe that most of these teams wish we did actually close down, and they're angry at us for keeping the factory open. Maybe they wanted to coast on unemployment, maybe they liked the lack of revenue. I don't know... I do very much enjoy the cold comments, the  random questions, and I especially enjoy shutting these angry people down almost daily about my whereabouts and habits. 

When our work load picks up again, I'll lock back in and do what I can. But for now, I'm going to keep relaxing. I'll likely keep it up through the holidays and new year. I don't care. I don't need to be at work for 40 hours per week to get my job done, so I won't be. Stay mad hoes. ",1,1762293354.0,confessions,0,1.0,False

Breakfast - the usual porridge, manuka honey, with soya milk alongside yogurt and berries and my coffee with sugar 10/10

Snack - greek yogurt, strawberries and raspberry jam 10/10 (inspired by you, I loved this)

Lunch - another chicken salad sourdough sandwich, still loving the mayo so much! lentil crisps, tomatoes and an orange 9/10

Snack - HU cashew chocolate, one of my new M&S Belgian curls and a shortbread tree with a cuppa 10/10

Dinner - Chicken, cheesy jacket potato and mixed veg with gravy 11/10 (this is gonna be a new favourite meal, I loved it!!)

Dessert - finally allowed myself cheesecake, it was vanilla with caramelised biscuit base 10/10 (I loved this so much, my brain was just VERY loud)

Extra - milk bottles, a Percy and fruit pastel 10/10 (felt this wasn't needed but gave myself a reality check, energy needs were NOT met today so any extras were a bonus!)

Snack - corn flakes, soya milk with yogurt and fruit 10/10

Today my brain was EXTREMELY loud and I won't lie I slipped back with some behaviours (MFP, smaller snacks etc) but managed to pull it back at dinner. I think it is stemming from anxiety about tomorrow's appointment. This is the longest I've been without weighing myself and I have challenged myself the most I ever have this week, so my brain is going WILD! I know I have done my best this week but I won't lie and say I am not nervous for how I will react to whatever happens tomorrow. My healthy self will be so annoyed if it hasn't gone up because I have worked SO hard this week and also it means I still have SO much more work to do to get to my goals, but then I am worried how my ED brain will react if its gone up loads. Even though I know my ED doesn't want the best for me and a drop/maintain could result in a readmission/more stricter controls. It is hard because I am so torn all the time. 

I also am getting panicked if the scale has gone up too much my dietician will take food away, but I am going to see her tomorrow and hopefully discuss some of my thoughts with her. Anyways today's food was pretty good, dinner was amazing and finally got my cheesecake, which I enjoyed DESPITE my ED brain giving off stink! Hope you all are well!

I am trying to get our living room organized in a very livible and functional way before going ham on decor (just bought first home). Winter is coming, which means we're on the cusp of dragging slush and salt through the white door into our amazing hardwood floors and new rug, and I need shoe storage help! 
This room opens up to our back deck and garage, so it gets heavy traffic. The walkway between the couch/wall, towards the back wall and record shelves, is pretty narrow. I intend to replace the coffee table with a round one to help with traffic flow when the white door is open.
1. Would you buy a shoe storage cabinet for the narrow space between the couch/wall, or a bench? We have about 6 pairs sitting by the white doors now, but I expect to need heavy winter boots there for snow soonish. Worried a bench won't store enough for us. 
2. Would you replace the TV stand with something that could also hold shoes? Because of outlets etc, our TV, speakers and turntable (everything you see basically) have to stay in this nook. (Stand will be replaced down the road anyway.)
3. Or, wildcard, would you get a cabinet to fill the space in the back of the room by our record shelving? These are not built ins. I ordered cube storage to mimic a room-wide shelving system and came up a bit short. My plan has been to order the final 4-cube shelf and finish out the look with a gallery wall overhead. But, I could basically scoot the whole shelving system over to start under the window, and buy a shoe cabinet to go in the windowless corner. That's going to mess up my gallery wall plans, and I'm worried I wouldn't like the contrast of continuous shelves next to a random one.

Most of what's taught about discipline is bullshit that looks good on Instagram but fails in real life.

After 15+ years of trial and error, here's what actually works:

The 2-Day Rule: Never miss the same habit two days in a row. This simple rule has been more effective than any complex tracking system.

Decision Minimization: I prep my workspace, clothes, and meals the night before. Eliminating these small decisions preserves mental energy for important work.

The 5-Minute Start: I commit to just 5 minutes of any difficult task. 90% of the time, I continue past 5 minutes once friction is gone.

Tools are your best friend. I use the normal notes app on my phone to write down things on my mind all the time. For planning my day, I use a tool which lets me turn a voice message into a to-do-list. I put the tools in my profile for anyone interested.

Trigger Stacking: I attach new habits to existing behaviors (e.g., stretching during coffee brewing, reading while on exercise bike).

Weekly Course Correction: Sunday evenings are sacred for reviewing what worked/didn't and adjusting for the coming week.

This isn't sexy advice. It won't get millions of likes on social media. But after thousands spent on books, courses, these simple principles have given me more progress than everything else combined.

One has abandonment issues, the other thinks affection is a federal crime, and together they form the perfect disaster couple.

They’ll swear they don’t need love, proceed to fall into it anyway, and drag the rest of us through 300 pages of repressed feelings and questionable decisions.

You know the beats. They meet in a totally unrealistic but “whimsical” scenario—maybe she spills coffee on his tragic backstory. They bicker out of unresolved childhood wounds. One of them smiles once and the other immediately writes their last name in a journal like it’s a blood pact. Cue tension, accidental hand brush, and sixteen internal monologues of “this is a terrible idea,” which is exactly why they do it.

Of course, because fate is petty, it all collapses. Someone leaves. Someone stays. Someone gives a heartfelt speech in the rain. Someone else needs therapy and maybe an exorcism. There’s crying, self-loathing, maybe a dramatic airport scene, or better—no closure at all. Just emotional wreckage, poetic metaphors about broken hearts, and a playlist titled “Pain But Make It Cinematic.”

So yes, that’s the formula: love, longing, psychological destruction, maybe a kiss, and no survivors. It’s toxic, it’s tragic, and readers will eat it up like it’s their last meal.

1ook95r,https://www.reddit.com/r/NorthAmericanPantheon/comments/1ook95r/dreams/,Dreams,"(Thank you once again to u/bisexual_villain for proofreading!!)

A cold breeze wafted in through the open window, carrying the sound of songbirds and the gentle rustling of leaves into the room. Elise, still floating in that serene space between sleep and waking, blinked a few times against the bright, golden rays of the morning sun and lifted her hand to wipe at her bleary eyes. From the kitchen, she could hear the muted sound of some generic pop song playing on the radio, periodically interrupted by the opening and closing of cabinet doors and drawers.

She stretched her limbs with a small grunt and reached for her phone. Almost 9:30 am! Thank God it was a Saturday. 

She unlocked the screen and discovered an unread text message from Sol.

*“hey girl you guys home later? vinny and i could come over for a coffee or something we havent hung out in ages”*

Elise smiled. She really had been missing her friends. Come to think of it, she couldn’t even remember the last time they talked! Clearly, a hangout was long overdue. She couldn’t wait to learn what Sol and Vinny had been up to. Last she’d heard, Vinny had started a new job working at his fiancé’s local theater, and Sol had moved into Gunnar’s fancy ass apartment in the city center.

*“Hey!! Omg yes I would love that! I don’t think we have anything planned for today so come over whenever!”*

She hit send and got ready to look at her Instagram feed, but before she could close the chat, something caught her eye. Sol’s profile picture. 

Sol looked exactly like she always did. A strand of puffy pink hair fell into her face, obscuring half of her toothy, happy grin, her slight blush frozen in time by the picture. Next to her, Gunnar was smiling as well, black hair pinned back out of his face by a pair of designer sunglasses he was wearing on his head, but… 

Elise’s eyes kept wandering back to the top of his head as she scrutinized the picture. Something was definitely different than usual, but she couldn’t put her finger on it. Had he gotten a new haircut or something? 

She shrugged and threw her phone on the bed, getting up to put on a baggy shirt and sweatpants. She would just have to ask Sol later.

As she walked into the kitchen, she was greeted by the savory smells of scrambled eggs and bacon, which made her mouth water. 

Stood at the stove was her husband. Elise still couldn’t understand how she had ever managed to get herself a man like that. He was perfect in every way: kind, funny, charismatic, he looked like a model too, and he had fallen in love with none other than plain, ordinary Elise.

They had been married for… how long now? She couldn’t really remember at the moment, but before she could even start doing the math, he turned around to greet her. His brilliant, disarming smile still gave her the same butterflies as on the first day they met. They met… wait, how did they-

“Good morning, Elise! Sit down, breakfast is almost ready!”

Elise gave him a goofy smile and walked over to him, pulling him into a hug. Orange, who had been sitting at his feet begging for a piece of bacon, meowed in outrage when Elise’s leg brushed his pumpkin colored fur.

“Morning, Trey. Thank you, you’re the best.”

Trey hummed and kissed the top of her head, his long black hair tickling her cheek.

“Did you sleep well?”

“Uh-huh.”

She could feel his lips splitting into a grin as his hand pressed into the small of her back.

“Did you have a nice dream?”

Elise pulled her face from his shirt and smiled up at him.

“I probably dreamed about you.”

“I’m sure you did, Elise. Sit down now, and I will serve you your eggs.”

She did as she was told, but not before patting Orange’s little head as an apology for ruining his bacon plans.

They made some easy conversation as they ate. Trey told her about some new thing he wanted to try out at his pest control company, and about how some of his employees disagreed with him about the specifics. Elise wasn’t overly interested, but she listened anyways, nodding along while enjoying the smooth sound of his voice.

When they were done eating, Elise got up, stacked their plates into the dishwasher and then came up behind Trey to loop her arms around his shoulders, burying her face into his long neck. 

“I love you, you know that? More than anything.”

He leaned back against her, raising his hand to stroke her arm. Goosebumps appeared on her flesh where he touched her. His hands were always so cold. He turned his head to press a gentle, sweet kiss to her lips.

“And I love you, mouse.”

Elise snorted, pulled back and gave him a funny look.

“Mouse? What kind of weird nickname is that for an exterminator’s wife? Bit morbid, don’t you think?”

He laughed, reaching out to brush an errand strand of hair behind her ear.

“I guess it is. I apologize. Old habits die hard, as they say, but that name doesn’t belong here, does it?”

Old habits? What?

…no, no. That didn’t belong here. 

She cleared her throat. Everything was okay. 

“Listen, uuh… Sol and Vinny are coming over this afternoon, is that okay with you?”

Trey cocked his head to the side, searching her face with a smile on his lips. His eyes flashed expectantly.

“Sure, if we’re still here by then. But either way, you will see them soon.”

Elise pushed down her discomfort. Everything was okay.

She laughed and teasingly poked her finger into his forehead.

“You’re such a weirdo sometimes! I’m going outside to do some work in the garden. Don’t forget to feed Orange!”

With that, she left the kitchen, put on a pair of old shoes she didn’t mind getting dirty, and left the house through the back door.

If she had to make a list of all of the things she loved, her garden would easily make the top five. Not top three, because she loved Trey, her quaint little house, and Orange more, but it was up there. 

The lawn, which was less lawn and more of a big expanse of moss and wildflowers, was covered in yellow and red leaves that had fallen off the two big chestnut trees framing the backyard on either side. Their branches still filtered the autumn sunlight and cast dancing shadows onto the ground, but in a few weeks, they would be barren.

Elise grabbed the rake from where it had been leaning against the wall of the house and started dragging all the fallen leaves and chestnuts into a big pile in the center of the lawn. It would make a cozy nest for hedgehogs, mice and squirrels to spend the cold season in.

She hummed as she worked, a little tune she made up as she went, enjoying the crisp autumn air and the musty smell of foliage.

Come spring, her flowers would bloom again, forget-me-nots, roses, lavender and chamomile; she would plant carrots and radishes and watch them grow, and she would pester Trey into putting a new layer of white paint on the wooden fence surrounding their property. But for now, her own piece of nature was getting ready for hibernation.

After a while, she heard the back door creak open and turned around in time to see Trey leaning against the doorframe with his hands in his pockets, watching her. She waved at him, threw the rake to the ground with an exaggerated oops-gesture and bent down to pick it up, intentionally angling her body so he would get a good look down the front of her sweater.

Trey scoffed, picked up a stray chestnut she had missed earlier and threw it at her. She giggled as it bounced off her stomach with a soft thump and watched as Orange emerged from behind Trey’s legs to investigate the projectile.

Elise squatted, petting the cat and admiring the way his black fur reflected the sunlight as he strode around her, headbutting her knees.

Hold on. Something wasn’t right.

White noise filled her ears as her laughter melted away.

“Trey,” she looked up at her husband, uncertainty tainting her voice, “why the fuck did we name a black cat Orange?”

Trey’s teasing smile didn’t look very friendly anymore.

“You never could quite decide on a color.”

Elise rose to her feet, unsteady, shaking.

Her phone buzzed. She took it out of her pocket and looked at the screen. One unread message from Sol. 

Horns. He should have horns.

*“how long can you keep up this fantasy?”*

Dread pooled in her stomach like ice water. What? What was going on? 

“Something isn’t right. Something hasn’t been right all day.”

“What is wrong? Are not you happy?”

The concern in his voice didn’t match his gleeful, eager expression.

“Of course I’m happy! I just feel like something is off, way off… you’ve been acting strange, and I’m dead sure this cat used to be orange, and there are things I don’t remember, things I should remember… Trey, when did we get married? When did we move into this house? Fuck, how do I even know you?”

“We met in the Court of Miracles. I turned you into a traitor, and you visited my palace, in which I cut you open and made you my mouse.”

Elise stumbled backwards. Trey stalked after her like a predator, his steps slow and measured as she squeezed her eyes shut, her breath racing, her fingernails clawing at her throat like a woman drowning.

Recollection pierced her brain like a bullet. Flashes like a chopped movie sequence playing on a broken projector, cries, screaming, blinding pain, her blood pouring out from under cold fingertips, pale, piercing, familiar eyes staring into her own.

“No. No. No, this is wrong, this doesn’t belong here, Trey, help me, make it go away, make it stop, please, I can’t-“

His chest collided with her face as he pulled her into a hug, and somewhere deep down, she knew that there would be no use in fighting him, so she let him hold her, collapsing into his body as he shushed and cooed into her ear.

“It doesn’t belong here, Elise. And yet you remember. Do you want to know why that is?”

“No, no, I just want it to stop, please…”

Trey kept talking as if she hadn’t said anything at all. His voice dripped with anticipation.

“It’s because none of this is real. This house is not real, your garden is not real, your friends are not real, not even the cat is real. Your past is not real, and neither is your future. You are not real. The only thing that is real is me. I gave you everything you have here; however, mouse, I am sorry to say, it’s time to wake up.”

That got Elise fighting again. She flailed against his grip, uselessly pawing at his chest and yanking his hair and scratching his face in raw panic as she begged incoherently.

“Please, please no, just let me stay, why can’t you just let me stay? I don’t want to go back, I can’t, I’ll die!”

“Greedy. You’ve been here for years. Is that not enough happiness? Well, technically, you’ve only been here for about five hours, but that is not what it feels like, is it? Do not worry. I will be there for you, always.”

With a last burst of adrenaline-fueled strength, she tried to tear free, to run, run where he wouldn’t find her, but he effortlessly caught her by the upper arm, fingers bruising, and pulled her close. His breath tickled her ear as he spoke with a low sing-song voice.

“Time to wake up!”

The world dissolved around her.

\-

Elise awoke in complete silence. The cell was uncomfortably warm, the air stale and oppressive. She blinked at the ceiling a few times, trying to clear her teary eyes as grey, dreary morning light filtered in through the tainted window.

For a moment, she didn’t know where she was or how she got here.

Then, the memories tore into her like a knife. It was gone. Everything she thought she had, it was gone, it had never been hers to begin with. A lie. A game. 

She dry-heaved, then she started sobbing. 

“Did you have a nice dream?” came a voice from her left.

She turned her head. Next to her on the bed sat Astraeus, his legs crossed, his eyes glued to her face, drinking in every reaction, every tear, every twitch of her lip. In the dim light of the room, he looked almost like a normal man.

Almost.

“Why did you do that?” she asked, her voice flat and defeated.

“And what did I do? I made your dream come true, did I not? As true as it could ever be, at least. Are not you happy?”

Elise shook her head in disbelief. Her voice shook with despair and rage.

“Don’t. You did this to torture me. Next time, just beat me like any other abuser and be done with it.”

He tutted.

“Disrespect. And here I was thinking you just might have learned your lesson.”

He reached out to her with a pale hand. Elise reared back, expecting pain, but he just grabbed her shoulder and pulled her in, cradling her in his arms like a child as she wept.

Even though he repulsed her, even though she was terrified, even though she hated him, his touch was welcome and soothing. She clung to him, burying her face in his shirt, hiding from this world that didn’t feel like hers anymore. He leaned down.

“I am all you have left, Elise. You should be grateful. Say ‘thank you, Your Highness.’”

Whatever. She had no pride left, no respect for herself, no worth. He had taken it all and left her with nothing, nothing to hope for but to drown in his endless, tar-like hatred.

“Thank you, Your Highness.”

“Good. Well done. You didn’t sound very genuine, but we will work on that. Now!”

He clapped his hands, making her flinch-

“You should get ready. Your friend, the whore, is getting married today, remember? Are you looking forward to the celebration?”

Elise just stared at his face for a long moment, empty-eyed, and watched as his mouth stretched into a smile.

He snorted, then he started cackling, high-pitched and ugly. She had never heard him laugh like that. It made her stomach churn.

Without another word, she got up, put her discarded clothes on and walked out of his cell. 

His laughter followed her down the hallway.

I am sure it could be a vicious cycle of spasms and stress. But I have tried calming exercises, outdoor light exercise, cut down on coffee, drinking more water, etc etc with no relief. 
My doctor said it’s just stress and to just rest. 
At what point should this be investigated further? I was told after 2 weeks but even then I am being told to get more rest.

1ook4qx,https://www.reddit.com/r/texas/comments/1ook4qx/reconsidering_homeownership/,Reconsidering homeownership,"Just got my property tax bill for this year and I nearly choked on my coffee. I knew Texas had high property taxes (no state income tax has to come from somewhere, right?) but this is getting out of hand.

I bought my house in the RGV about 3 years ago and my taxes have gone up like 30% since then. Between that, insurance going through the roof (thanks, random hailstorms), and maintenance costs, I'm starting to wonder if owning is even worth it anymore. My mortgage payment is basically pocket change compared to everything else at this point.

Don't get me wrong, I love Texas and I love my house, but I'm doing the math and it's just not mathing anymore if that makes sense. My salary sure as hell hasn't gone up 30% to match these increases.

I've been tossing around the idea of selling and maybe renting for a while, or relocating to a lower cost area. The thing is, my house needs some updating - roof is getting old, AC is original to the house (which in Texas heat is basically a death sentence waiting to happen), and I just don't have the cash to dump into repairs right now.

Been seeing ads from companies that buy houses as-is but idk, seems too good to be true? Anyone here actually worked with cash buyers in Texas? Or am I better off just sucking it up, making the repairs, and going traditional route?

Genuinely curious what other Texas homeowners are thinking right now. Are property taxes making anyone else reconsider their whole situation or is it just me being dramatic?",7,1762292287.0,texas,11,1.0,False

first 2 photos show the current kitchen.

our plan is to

1- break the wall separating the kitchen and dining room and add a peninsula

2- break the wall separating the kitchen and laundry room at the end of the kitchen to allow the window to let in more light into the kitchen

3 - switch the location of the fridge & stove so the fridge is not blocking the flow as much

4 - place wall mounted microwave/oven

5- add a coffee nook area across the peninsula. this is also what you look at as you walk in, so we want this to have a nicer backsplash and look pretty

any thoughts, suggestions??

1ook2fo,https://www.reddit.com/r/OnePieceTCG/comments/1ook2fo/one_piece_regional_simulation_op13_early_look/,One Piece Regional Simulation (OP-13 Early Look),"# 10 Leaders, 50,000 Tournaments

Hey everyone,

This is an **early look at the OP-13 metagame**, using the same large-scale simulation framework as before.  
The data has been refreshed with the **latest results from the official One Piece TCG simulator**, covering the **10 most-played leaders**, which still make up **over 80% of the field**.

Since some matchups still have **relatively low game counts**, treat this as an *initial snapshot* rather than a final ranking.  
Win rates will shift as more data rolls in and players refine their lists — but early trends are already emerging.

  
⚙️ **2.1 Data**

This analysis draws on thousands of recent high-level simulator matches from competitive environments (1B+ Beri prize pools).  
It focuses on the **10 most-played leaders** in OP-13 to ensure statistical coverage while avoiding noise from low-play-rate decks.

**Key inputs:**

* **📊 Matchup Win Rates:** The probability that one leader beats another, split by *going first vs second* — which has major implications in OP-13.
* **📈 Leader Play Rates:** How often each leader appears in the field, used to model a realistic player population for each event. (This is of course skewed online compared to in person)

# 🧮 2.2 Simulation Design

Each run simulates a **Regional-style tournament**, including both Swiss and playoffs:

* **50,000 total tournaments**
* **1,024 players per event**
* **10 Swiss rounds**
* **Top 32 single-elimination playoff**

Play rates vary slightly from tournament to tournament to reflect natural meta drift.  
Swiss rounds are resolved probabilistically — for example, a 53% matchup means a 53% chance to win that round.

In playoffs, the **higher seed chooses play/draw** in Game 1, and the **loser of each game chooses next**, with the model always making the *statistically optimal choice*.  
This allows the simulation to capture both **deck strength** and **strategic depth** across stages.

  
📊 **3. Results and Analysis**

After running all 50,000 tournaments, four core performance metrics were calculated for each leader:

* **Swiss Win Rate (SWR):** Average win rate across all Swiss matches.
* **Top 32 Conversion Rate (T32):** Likelihood of making playoffs.
* **Tournament Win Rate (TWR):** How often that leader wins an entire event.
* **Player Win Conversion Rate (WCR):** The chance an individual player wins the whole tournament if they register that deck.

🧭 **5. Conclusion and Next Steps**

This OP-13 simulation provides a **first quantitative snapshot** of the new environment, showing how leaders stack up in a full tournament structure rather than just isolated matchups.



Future updates will:

* Incorporate larger sample sizes as more OP-13 games are recorded
* Expand beyond the top 10 leaders
* Track how win rates evolve week to week as the meta settles

1oojzeo,https://cen.acs.org/policy/publishing/One-five-chemists-deliberately-added/103/web/2025/10,"1 in 5 chemists have deliberately added errors into their papers during peer review, study finds","More than 20% of chemistry researchers have deliberately added information they believe to be incorrect into their manuscripts during the peer review process, in order to get their papers published.

That’s one conclusion of a study surveying 982 chemistry researchers who were the corresponding authors of at least two papers published in journals of the Royal Society of Chemistry or the American Chemical Society between 2020 and 2023. (ACS [publishes C&EN](https://cen.acs.org/static/about/standards-practices.html).)

The study, published by *Accountability in Research*, [aimed to document how chemists react](https://doi.org/10.1080/08989621.2025.2564106) when they spot errors in other researchers’ studies or their own manuscripts and what action, if any, they take when they do so.

When asked if they felt they were forced to modify their manuscript with text they thought to be incorrect, 22% of survey respondents said yes. Study author Frédérique Bordignon, a bibliometrician and research integrity officer at École des ponts ParisTech, says one reason for making such a concession is to wrap up the review process and get a paper published. “It’s a bit concerning,” she says.

Most survey respondents—88%—said they had discovered errors in papers when reading them. Out of those who spotted errors, nearly four in five reported taking further action. 

While most researchers agree that formally correcting the scholarly record is the best practice, that’s often not what they do in practice, Bordignon says. “They prefer off-the-record activities like discussion with other peers,” she says.

Among those who took action, 42% mentioned the issue in private conversations to colleagues such as during coffee breaks or at conferences; around a third cited the problematic paper in their own future publication, highlighting the issue; and around 30% mentioned it to students during training courses.

While 28% reported talking to or emailing the authors of the problematic paper encouraging them to retract or correct the paper, the study found, 22% chose to simply ignore the error and never cite it. (Many participants were represented in multiple categories, as they reported carrying out more than one action in some instances.)

Among other actions, 13% wrote a letter, comment, or note to the journal; 4% started their own replication project; 4% published a formal refutation of the study; and 2% commented on PubPeer, [a website where scientists often discuss papers](https://cen.acs.org/people/Materials-scientist-explains-why-he-started-commenting-PubPeer/102/web/2024/06).

The survey found that 56% of researchers said errors should be corrected, as a matter of principle; that number rises to 82% when it comes to researchers’ own studies. Meanwhile, a third of survey respondents said an error should be corrected only if it changes the conclusions of the paper.

François-Xavier Coudert, a computational chemist at France’s National Center for Scientific Research who was not involved with the study, thinks all errors need to be fixed. “Identifying errors and their cause is often a lengthy and effort-consuming process, so the results should be made available to all readers,” he says. “This is the only way to have more reproducibility in research.”

Bordignon says more transparency is needed among chemists. “The problem is, it’s sometimes difficult to face the consequence of being critical of someone else,” she says. “I think we should encourage researchers to be more open to critiques and be more open to flag research of others as well because that’s part of science.”

That’s why Bordignon feels chemists should comment on PubPeer more often. Coudert agrees that more postpublication peer review of chemistry studies is needed. “PubPeer is one platform where that can happen, but it is not necessarily the only one,” he says.

One way to allow for easier communication of corrections or updates to research is to treat research papers as [“living” documents](https://doi.org/10.1038/nature.2015.17382) that can be dynamically edited if follow-up work yields new results. “This is exactly what happens with preprints, where all readers know that the ‘final’ published version of the article will be different from the preprint version,” Coudert says.",1,1762291966.0,academia,0,1.0,False
1oojys4,https://www.reddit.com/r/GraphicsProgramming/comments/1oojys4/how_to_render_drop_shadow_like_figma_in_metal/,How to render drop shadow like figma in Metal shader,"Hello everyone,

I am new to Graphic programming and shaders and I am working on a Metal fragment shader that downscales a video frame by 20% and adds a soft drop shadow around it to create a depth effect. The shadow should blend with the background layer beneath it, but I'm getting a solid/opaque background instead of transparency. After countless tries I am not being able to achieve any good results.

What I'm trying to achieve:

1. Render a video frame scaled to 80% of its original size, centered
2. Add a soft drop shadow around the scaled frame
3. The area outside the frame should be transparent (alpha channel) so the shadow blends naturally with whatever background texture is rendered in a previous layer
4. Inspired by Inigo Quilez's soft shadow techniques using signed distance fields: [https://iquilezles.org/articles/rmshadows/](https://iquilezles.org/articles/rmshadows/)

This is how I want the final result to be :-

In the image, the video is downscaled, and have a soft dropshadow applied to it, its perfeclty blending with the background ( grey ( which on previous layer we rendererd a image / color background ) )

I basically want to achieve the figma style dropshadow to any texture and it can be placed on top of anything and show the dropshadow

What I've tried:

I'm using a signed distance field approach to calculate smooth shadow falloff around the rectangular frame, also try adding the rounded corners:

\#include <metal\_stdlib>

using namespace metal;

struct VertexIn {

float2 position \[\[attribute(0)\]\];

float2 texCoord \[\[attribute(1)\]\];

};

struct VertexOut {

};

vertex VertexOut displayVertexShader(VertexIn in \[\[stage\_in\]\]) {

VertexOut out;

out.position = float4(in.position, 0.0, 1.0);

out.texCoord = in.texCoord;

return out;

}

float softShadow(float2 uv, float2 center, float2 size, float blur, float spread, float cornerRadius) {

float2 d = abs(uv - center) - size + cornerRadius;

float dist = length(max(d, 0.0)) + min(max(d.x, d.y), 0.0) - cornerRadius;

dist -= spread;

return 1.0 - smoothstep(0.0, blur, -dist);

}

float roundedRectangleMask(float2 uv, float2 center, float2 size, float cornerRadius) {

float2 d = abs(uv - center) - size + cornerRadius;

float dist = length(max(d, 0.0)) + min(max(d.x, d.y), 0.0) - cornerRadius;

return smoothstep(0.001, 0.0, dist);

}

fragment float4 displayFragmentShader(VertexOut in \[\[stage\_in\]\],

texture2d<float> inputTexture \[\[texture(0)\]\]) {

constexpr sampler textureSampler(mag\_filter::linear, min\_filter::linear);

float scale = 0.8;

float2 center = float2(0.5, 0.5);

float cornerRadius = 20.0 / 1000.0;

float2 shadowOffset = float2(0.0, 0.02);

float shadowBlur = 0.08;

float shadowSpread = 0.0;

float shadowIntensity = 0.6;

float3 shadowColor = float3(0.0);

float2 scaledCoord = (in.texCoord - center) / scale + center;

float2 frameSize = float2(scale \* 0.5);

// Check if inside the rounded rectangle

float mask = roundedRectangleMask(scaledCoord, center, frameSize, cornerRadius);

bool insideFrame = mask > 0.5;

float2 shadowUV = in.texCoord - shadowOffset;

float shadow = softShadow(shadowUV, center, frameSize, shadowBlur, shadowSpread, cornerRadius);

if (insideFrame) {

float4 color = inputTexture.sample(textureSampler, scaledCoord);

return color \* mask;

} else {

float shadowAlpha = shadow \* shadowIntensity;

return float4(shadowColor, shadowAlpha);

}

}

\`\`\`

This is the code I am being able to wrote up until this point, however, this is giving way off the results I want.

This is the result I got, the frame is trimmed, a weird white blur added, the rest of the part is darken ( the background was a light color )

I am new to Shader programming, and hardly wrote any metal code, and after countless tried, I am not being able to achieve the desired result I want.

**Platform(s):**  
I'm going to assume Windows, but I was basically a baby, so I can not say for certain.

**Genre:**

The main gameplay had a character facing you, and you were able to interact with them, such as giving them a hot coffee or a cold drink, which would cause them to react. The game had at least 1 minigame, and this minigame was a 2D endless runner. It kinda reminds me of an adventure game in hindsight.

**Estimated year of release:**  
I played this when I was likely around 5 years old. As I was born 2004, let's assume the game came out maybe around... 2008 or so.

**Graphics/art style:**

It was a cute art style that was cartoony and kid friendly. Think Starfall if you guys remember that website.

**Notable characters:**  
I got nothing, however I remember for sure there was a man of a darker skin tone and a clean haircut as one of the people you can interact with.

**Notable gameplay mechanics:**  
When with a character, you have a list of items to your right, and you can give these items to the person. With the man for example, I gave him a hot drink which caused a reaction. I also gave him a cold drink which turned him blue and cold lol.

The endless runner portion was 2D and I think you were dodging lasers and stuff. Liked the art style.

**Other details:**  
I made a quick mockup drawing.

If anyone has any information on this I would appreciate it heavily.",1,1762291879.0,tipofmyjoystick,0,1.0,False

The tin can analogy is pretty much spot on, and everything sounds....not so good sonically to be honest.  I'm here in hopes Suno can figure it out sooner than later because Udios model 1 is still miles ahead of Sunos Model 5 in so many ways (a lot of which are crucial).

I know many of these points have likely been pointed out before, but I'm kind of in a venting stage still.  I'm not here to hate on Suno in anyway, I want to see if become what it can become and always have.  Udio was simply on a different level when it came to audio quality and the creative process for me.

My guess, which many find obvious, is that Udio simply trained on a lot of great music while Suno has decided to take the ""high road"". I'm not a wiz when it comes to AI and the model training process, but the brute force approach simply yielded magical results sonically, compositionally, and creatively.  

My question, what does Suno or a competitor need to do to get on the same level and eventually surpass what Udio did with just its first 2 models without said training.  I imagine it's time, but if they don't train on REAL recordings throughout history, mixed and mastered by the best, it may never get there anytime soon.  Does this mean China will just inevitably win sooner than later?

I'm of the opinion you simply just need to train on actual good music to make it work anytime soon.  Negotiate with owners if thats how the legal battle plays out, but at the end of the day you'll need that massively large data set of S Tier music to make it magical again.  I hope I'm wrong, but I just feel this to be the case.

Suno has made some impressive strides, and I think from a compositional standpoint the ""one click wonder"" surpassed UDIO a long time ago.  It can make amazing compositions and arrangements, it just sounds like a lo-fi demo played through a coffee-tin speaker.

I'll be looking for prompt suggestions, but not being able to make personas out of uploaded music is a massive set back and downside for me.  

  
Here's to hoping yall figure it out soon, till then, I suppose we wait.  Much love.",2,1762291737.0,SunoAI,9,0.63,False

The artistry, the execution, quality of scents and projection/longevity are all excellent. I can see why they’re quickly gaining popularity! 

My likes: fruity, fresh, aquatic, green, vanilla, powder
 
Dislikes: super sweet gourmands, smoke, incense, soapy 

**It's Just Pears** – it’s simple, but well executed pear scent. On me, it’s a very realistic, ripe and juicy bartlett pear, skin and all. I don’t really smell brandy, it just contributes to the “ripe” aspect of the pear. I am a simple B, and this is great and can be an easy reach that works for anytime any place. 10/10

*A fresh, juicy, slightly overripe and musky Bartlett pear - spiked with brandy over a honeyed amber base (vegan)*

**It's Just Spiced Pears** – all the loveliness of the above, plus fall spices (cinnamon, clove, star anise, ginger) and caramel sauce. I don’t really smell caramel, just the pear + spices. Unfortunately, on my skin this one turns very masculine… not really sure why, but it could just be skin chemistry. I prefer the original. 6/10

*Notes: Bartlett pears, brandy, cinnamon, star anise, ginger, clove, caramel sauce, on a buttery chypre base.*

**Bellano** – smells like a fancy woman in diamonds walking out of a swanky hotel, holding a cup of coffee. It’s NICE, but nondescriptive, the notes are all blended very well. I like it, but not enough to upsize. 8/10

*Notes: Star jasmine , orange flower absolute, lavender, ambergris, clear lake water, ozone, chocolate, and a hint of coffee*

**The Idea of You** – an outdoorsy aquatic atmospheric, very relaxing. Like hiking by the water with a boyfriend wearing his flannel shirt that smells faintly of cannabis. I keep reaching for the sample, will likely upgrade to 10ml. Would be perfect for hiking. 9/10

*Notes: hinoki, cannabis terpenes, ocean mist, aldehydes, mimosa blossom, tonka bean, deer musk accord(vegan)*

**Snooze** – cozy and sweet, white chocolate is definitely present, it’s a little too sweet for my taste but gourmand lovers will enjoy this! 6/10

 *Notes: tonka bean, lilac, vanilla absolute, green cardamom, cashmere cardigans, white chocolate, and plumeria over a modernized chypre base.*

**The Strange Proclivities of Mr. Dickens** – fresh squeezed oranges and mulled wine. It smells really good and natural, but I would prefer this as a candle vs perfume. I think I just struggle with fall spices in perfume. 6/10

*Notes: Hot mulled red wine, flavored with cranberries, warm spices, and orange zest; layered over a traditional chypre perfume base, pipe tobacco, and woods.*
 

**Sea Anemone** – a very herby (maybe from the vetiver?) aquatic, very fresh… as it dries down, it gets sweeter and sharper. I am picky with my aquatics and had high hopes for this, sadly it’s not for me. I have now tried a number of perfumes with violet and don’t think I like it as a note. 4/10

*Notes: violet cotton candy, green apple, black currant, pineapple, sea brine, seaweed, red cedar leaf, and haitian vetiver.*

**Maravilla** – The belle of the ball this fall, it’s a beautiful chocolate heavy vanilla with hints of fall florals and soft spices. I really love how cocooning and gentle it is, the longevity is fantastic on me, I get whiffs throughout the day and still can faintly smell it in the morning if I spray it in the evening. Really lovely, it was a blind buy 10ml and I have zero regrets. 10/10

*Notes: Aged Vanilla Bean Tincture, Marigold Absolute, Amber, Blood Orange, Cocoa, Sugar, Cinnamon Leaf, Carnation*

I have a history with anorexia and binge eating but I have been a lot better recently. I still binge but not nearly as frequently or as much as I have in the past. I started seeing someone earlier this year and felt pretty good. In the past the thought is someone holding me or seeing my body would trigger me to relapse and not eat which didn’t happen with this guy so I was generally in a pretty good space. 

About a month ago things between us started to get weird which really set off my anxiety and suppressed my appetite. I didn’t notice too much but he made comments about how I wasn’t eating a lot when I was with him which just honestly made things between us worse (I felt attacked :/). he broke up with me this weekend (happy halloween lol) and I truly have not been able to eat since. I have had food but everything makes me feel so sick, I can barely even drink coffee in the morning. I am not too sad about the break up, I knew it was coming and we were both unhappy and anxious, but I wasn’t prepared  for the physical way my body would react. this is my first real break up too. I think the almost scarier though is me returning to binge eating. as bad as anorexia is, the height of my BED was probably the worst point of my life mentally. 

all this to say - I know my appetite will come back with time. What worries me is I like that I am not eating. I like being in control of something and seeing myself get smaller. I went to the doctors twice this month and lost enough weight in between each visit that they brought it up to me, and that was before we even broke up. I checked again today and I lost even more. I do not want to accidentally fall back into this disordered mindset as a way to cope or as a way of control and I guess I just don’t expect it. I am okay though!! really :) I am not sad and I have beat this before, I just need to get it off my chest and not feel so lonely ",2,1762291271.0,EDAnonymous,0,1.0,False

Made with melted butter so that the batter comes together in a flash, this is the cake you whip up when guests unexpectedly announce their imminent arrival. The joy in this cake, beyond the ease with which it is made (no bread dough required), is the cinnamon butter that you swirl into the batter, creating little pockets of spiced goodness in every slice.

		50g (1¾oz/3½ tablespoons) unsalted
		butter, diced, plus extra for greasing
		100g (3½oz/½ cup) caster (superfine
		or granulated) sugar
		1 large egg
		65ml 2½fl oz/¼ cup + 1 teaspoon
		double (heavy) cream
		¼ teaspoon vanilla bean paste
		100g 3½oz/¾ cup + 1 tablespoon
		plain (all-purpose) flour
		¾ teaspoon baking powder
		Pinch of fine sea salt
		25g (1oz/1¾ tablespoons) unsalted butter,
		at room temperature
		25g (1oz/2 tablespoons) light brown sugar
		2 teaspoons ground cinnamon
		Small pinch of fine sea salt
		FOR THE GLAZE
		50g 1¾oz/⅓ cup + 1 tablespoon
		icing (powdered) sugar, sifted
		1 tablespoon whole milk
		¼ teaspoon vanilla bean paste

		Preheat the oven to 180° (160°C Fan) 350°F, Gas Mark 4. Lightly grease a 23 x 13cm (9 x 5in) loaf tin and line with a strip of parchment paper that overhangs the long sides, securing it in place with metal binder clips.
		First make the cinnamon butter: place all the ingredients for it in a bowl and beat together until a very soft paste forms. Set aside.
		To make the cake, melt the diced butter in a small pan over a medium heat, then set aside. Place the sugar, egg, cream and vanilla in a bowl and whisk together until smooth and combined. Add the flour, baking powder and salt and whisk again, just until a smooth batter forms. Pour in the melted butter and stir gently with the whisk, just until fully combined. Scrape the batter into the prepared tin and spread evenly.
		Spoon little dollops of the cinnamon butter over the batter, then use a skewer or chopstick to gently swirl them in. Bake for about 25 minutes, or until the cake springs back to a light touch and is just starting to come away from the sides of the tin. Turn off the oven and set the cake aside for 15 minutes, before carefully transferring to a wire rack to cool completely.
		When the cake is cold, reheat the oven to 180° (160°C Fan) 350°F, Gas Mark 4. Combine the glaze ingredients in a bowl and mix together until smooth and pourable. Drizzle the glaze all over the cake, then return it to the oven for a couple of minutes, or until the glaze is set.
		Serve thin slices of the cake alongside big mugs of coffee. Once sliced, it is best eaten that day, but the slices can also be frozen for up to a month.

1oojhbg,https://www.reddit.com/r/OdysseyBookClub/comments/1oojhbg/routines_arent_boring_theyre_a_love_language_to/,Routines aren’t boring — they’re a love language to your future self,"We’re living in a world that worships spontaneity. “Just do whatever feels good.” “Go with the flow.” “Burn the 5-9, not the 9-5.” Everywhere I look, especially online, there’s this obsession with freedom, rejecting structure, and glorifying chaos as a personality trait. But the truth is, I’ve never met someone who’s thriving without some kind of structure behind the scenes.

If anything, routines are underrated. They’re not prison bars. They’re scaffolding. They hold you up when motivation fades. They make the hard things automatic. They’re future-proofing. And the wildest part? Most people avoid them because they think structure kills creativity. In reality, structure is what gives creativity a place to bloom. Neuroscientists like Dr. Andrew Huberman (Stanford) have even confirmed that the brain craves predictable rhythms to function optimally.

So no, routines aren’t boring. They’re a radical act of self-respect. And they’re a way to say “I’ve got you” to your future self. Here’s how to build one that actually sticks — and doesn’t suck.

- Build anchors, not timetables  
  Most people fail at routines because they try to micromanage every minute. But life doesn’t care about your neat little schedule. What works better: create “anchor points” instead. Think: a morning reset (coffee, sunlight, movement), a midday refocus (walk, journaling), an end-of-day wind-down (no screens, reflection, sleep). These are flexible yet dependable. According to behavioral scientist Katy Milkman, habits formed around consistent cues — not clocks — have higher success rates (read: *How to Change*).

- Start ridiculously small  
  People want to wake up at 5AM, read 50 pages, run 3 miles, meditate, and eat chia seeds — all on day one. That’s TikTok delusion. Real change starts embarrassingly small. B.J. Fogg at Stanford calls this “tiny habits.” Do a 2-minute journal. Walk five minutes. Stack this habit next to something you already do. That’s how it becomes automatic.

- Dopamine-proof your mornings  
  If you start your day scrolling, congrats — you’ve already fried your dopamine baseline. Dr. Anna Lembke’s research at Stanford shows that small dopamine hits (like checking your phone first thing) make it harder to focus and feel joy later in the day. Instead, build a slow, real-world morning: cold water, real food, slight discomfort, then flow. It’s not cute, but it works.

- Use the “effortless friction” trick  
  Want to journal more? Leave your notebook open on your desk. Want less screen time? Put your charger in another room. James Clear (author of *Atomic Habits*) explains that adding or removing “friction” can make or break a habit. Engineering your environment is a routine hack 99% of the internet still hasn’t figured out.

- Remember: energy, not time, is your real currency  
  What helps routines last isn’t just managing hours, it’s managing your energy. If you only work on your goals when you feel like it, you’ll never do anything important. Cal Newport’s *Deep Work* explains how focused time blocks, followed by true rest, helps build momentum. Focus is a muscle. And routines are your training plan.

Here are some insanely good resources that helped me refine my daily systems — after testing out way too many YouTube dopamine detox bros.

- *The Mountain Is You* by Brianna Wiest  
  NYT bestselling author. This book is a wake-up punch in the face and also a warm hug. It explores self-sabotage through the lens of neuroscience and emotional patterning. It's honest, deeply relatable, and unexpectedly poetic. This is the best book I’ve ever read for understanding how we unconsciously ruin our own routines — and how to stop.

- *Essentialism* by Greg McKeown  
  If your routines feel overwhelming or cluttered, this is your reset. It teaches you how to eliminate the noise and focus on less, but better. Greg’s concept of “protecting the asset” (aka you) changed how I build my schedule. It’s like minimalism, but for your time.

- *The Tim Ferriss Show* (podcast)  
  He interviews high performers and breaks down their routines, habits, and mental models. The episode with Jocko Willink on discipline and the one with Naval Ravikant on leverage gave me routines I still use years later.

- *Huberman Lab* (YouTube series + Podcast)  
  Dr. Andrew Huberman explains how your brain and body work best — and how routines can optimize dopamine, sleep, focus, and learning. Scientific, but accessible. Especially recommend his episodes on morning sunlight and circadian alignment. You’ll never see your morning the same way again.

- Insight Timer (app)  
  This is a super underrated app for building better wind-down routines. Free meditations, calming sleep music, body scans — way better than doomscrolling. My personal favorite: Yoga Nidra before bed, it puts your mind into deep rest without needing to meditate like a monk.

- BeFreed  
  This is like having an AI-powered self-improvement coach in your pocket. Built by a research team from Columbia, it turns books, podcasts, and expert insights into personalized learning plans based on what you care about. You can pick how deep you want to go — from 10 to 40-minute podcasts — and even pick the voice of your host to match your vibe. It’s honestly the best app I’ve used to build consistent learning routines. My favorite part: it adapts over time. The more you learn, the smarter it gets about what fuels your growth. And it has deep libraries on everything I recommended above — so you can turn reading into action. I use it to level up 1% a day. That’s 37x in one year.

- Finch (app)  
  Cute, gamified habit tracking. You get a pet that grows every time you complete small daily rituals. It’s lighthearted but surprisingly effective. Great for people who want to ease into routines without taking it all too seriously.

Routines aren’t a restriction. They’re a relief. They’re how you stop hoping to become the person you want to be — and start becoming them on autopilot.",2,1762290696.0,OdysseyBookClub,0,1.0,False

**Intro**

Long time reader and now first poster! 

 I (33M) have been running since 2020 when gyms were closed and would run 2-3x weekly to compliment my strength training. I’ve been lifting for 10+years and I’m a teacher so putting in the work are always a little tricky, but I have always made it work as anyone being ‘on’ all day with kids can be a run in and of itself. 

I began racing in 2023 with the NYC Half and began with a conservative 1:39 at about 30mpw. I have continued training throughout last 2 years at about 30-40 mpw while still compliment strength training. I have managed to bring my shorter distances down to a 18:5x 5K/ 39 10K and 1:26 HM this past March at the NYC half. I completed the 9+1 plan for the '25 NYC Marathon last year and began ramping up the mileage and using my PRs to give myself a marker of what I think I could hit. After the 1:26 HM I saw sub 3 as a reach goal for a BQ to give myself a chance and decided to train at those paces. 

**Training**.

So for my first Marathon plan after ferociously reading this subreddit, I decided on the 18/55 Pfitz plan as I thought it was the most laid out over the JD 2Q plan and I thought that would be helpful keep myself honest and regimented. I managed to keep up with the mileage in the plan and only had to modify the plan slightly for a trip to Vienna/Budapest so I just moved my first 20 miler a week earlier which holy hell felt tough with the humidity and what I found about poor fueling/ nutrition. I learned that Saltstick would become by new bff while running and drinking plenty of fluids as the early parts of the plans the Long Runs which were my new LRs each week once I passed 16 miles I would feel rather gassed/fatigued the rest of the day.

While I liked the plan the only cons with the plan as a whole that I had were the LT workouts, which I find early on rather unattainable in the summer heat just on heavy legs during peak weeks. I would spend most of these workouts by effort based on HR than strict paces to give myself that stimulus. I think this contributed to what I felt overtraining midway through, but took a couple days and off and felt better.

I really enjoyed the Medium Long/ Long runs of the plan as it built up my confidence to finish strong and help prep my mind mentally for completing 26.2 for the first time. I felt rather confident doing the MP workouts which early on I was hitting/near hitting my sub 3 goal paces when factored in for the heat/humidity. 

I did one official race that I used as a long run with warm up and cool downs before/after and finished at less than 5 seconds from my 10 mile PR with very heavy legs going in at the peak weeks of the plan and on a very warm September for NY. 

My last 20 miler went as well as it could have and I felt rather confident and I did last several at GMP and felt rather comfortable and not too hard. I really saw sub 3 as a possibility or around 3-3:05. I found it a bit ambitious but, I love a good challenge. I did do one quasi 10K TT 2 weeks out but tried to just steady at 6:25-6:30 where it would not feel too hard and I didn't risk injury so close to race day

Taper went as well as expected, only runs that felt weird were the last week with dress rehearsal where 2@MP felt like 1 hell mile for a strange reason and then the next one nice and relaxed,  and the first run after carb loading for I felt very bloated. Had a little bit of maranoia and some niggles that began popping up, but they did go away by race day. 

**Pre-race**

This is where things began to get interesting. I mightily struggled with carb load to 600g each day for the 3 day load and I think that made some effect on the actual day and hopefully anyone reading this far would have tips to get more liquid carbs to make it easier at high levels. 

I did all the simple carbs I could but to get it all in was I found hard even for someone that eats alot like myself. I ate as much as I could and calculated throughout the day 

The interesting part came 2 days when my mom came up to visit to come see me race. While I was planning an easy Friday night with plenty of sleep and a easy Saturday Halloween night rued its head when my mom fell and dislocated her wrist badly as we were walking home so we spent our night in the ER into the late hours while she got tended to. I was really upset that had happened to her. Good news is that she's okay but will need surgery in the next 7-10 days of this post. So good sleep went out the window Friday. Saturday managed to be easy and chill have some maurten 320 in the afternoon with simple carbs with a big pasta dinner and just get ready for race day.

Had an easy time getting to the village via the bus dressed in some layers. Had a bagel and Peanut butter when I woke up with coffee and 2 scoops of tailwind. Was sitting for quite a while and was shivering for a good 30-40 minutes trying to stay warm with hot water etc.. Not sure how much that affected me for the race.  I made sure to use the restroom a couple of times, and nibbled on another bagel while waiting and had a gel right before the start. 

**Race**

Race day came and managed to get here injury free which I was proud for and running the most mileage I have ever run! Race weather was also near perfect around light wind and about 50F at start. Plan was a Maurten 160 gel x4 with a caf gel @ halfway ,every 45 min and salt sticks every 30-45 min as needed. I also made sure to get a sip of water and gatorade at every station. I did still really need to pee, but I attributed that to nerves. 

I went on the top of the bridge in Blue Corral instead of with a the 3 hr pacer at the lower level of the bridge  because I was afraid of crashing out really early and going too hot as my previous attempts with a pacer have gone. I do think on my next NYC attempt I will go on the lower level though.

START-5K 

My race strategy was to run even splits if anything a slight negative split, sounds easy right?  

Well those plans went right out the window at the start. There was a huge bottleneck on top of the bridge and with minimal weaving had a 8 min first mile.  I planned to go slow but not like that. In addition my HR was through the roof ie 170 instead of my normal 140 at start. I've done many races but none of them had that kind of electricity so along of variables I didn't consider, I had a crazy stitch as well at the beginning on right side, it dissipated mostly after getting off the bridge. I had a relatively slow opening 5K, but hoping things would improve.

5-10K 

Things started improving but still alittle weaving involved. Was finding folks who were trying to run 3:00-3:05 and pace each other have some light conversation, but pretty uneventful. Saw a friend on mile 6 to lift the spirits.

10K-HALF 

This where I felt most comfortable, I settled in to a good pace/rhythm and was beginning to speed up. Saw my mom and gf at mile 11-12 and got a huge boost from that. Paces were above. GPS as many would say was off so wasn't sure if I was closed to 6:50-6:55, turns out I wasn't but knew I could hold this pace easily. 

HALF-30K 

At halfway I clocked in 1:32, I realized quickly that sub 3 was not in the cards today unless I had a huge second wind and at this point I said, I just wanted to stay with even splits at that point. 

Crossing Queensboro bridge was very cathartic with how quiet it was. All the footsteps sounded like a light drizzle. Was almost my favorite part because of the contrast. Saw a friend ahead stopped and not looking great and cheered her on to keep going and bring some positive energy. Was feeling good. On first ave, I began feeling the wheels slowly coming off as I was barely keeping with the 3:05 pace group which I had passed earlier around Mile 17-18.

30-35K 

By this time I was holding on to the pace I could maintain and keep up. At Mile 20, with simple math I realized unless I run a 40 min 10K I be in 3:02, but about Mile 21-22 I felt the wall crash in slow motion where I just couldn't get my legs to turn over anymore. All the while I see the wall knocking people out left and right with cramps, walking it out etc... My mom and gf saw me in Harlem  and I didn't even know they were there. I briefly stopped for about 5 seconds to get my stitch out that was intense and went back to running.  

35-42K 

By Mile 23 I was slogging, I bonked (I think from an endurance standpoint more than nutrition) and I just kept staying positive mentally keeping one foot in front of another. Pain cave was real and was trying to push through up 5th avenue. Once I got into Central Park I knew the end was close. I just wanted to keep going. As soon as I saw 800m to go I wanted to send but couldn't but was able to sprint at 400m to go as fast as I could go and finished with pride. 

Post-race/Reflections

When it all was over, I faced many emotions just finishing my first marathon and the PAIN trying to exit! The walk out was not great, the lockup was real and thanks to a guy named Stephen I was talking with to keep my mind off the pain as well as being a huge inspiration. Met my family and friends outside and grabbed some food and ate what I could.

It's been 2 days post marathon, and while my quads are still shredded, I am still proud of completing my first marathon and it's nothing to snuff at. I still a bit bummed on my performance as I felt it was a little weak to my HM time, but the experience will be instrumental going forward. 

My thoughts I do have so far the Pfitz 3 week taper felt too long even though I followed the intensity with reduced mileage, maybe I do a 2 week one instead? I think I might have been a little too pumped for the high HR and perhaps being freezing for an hour straight did something? 

I definitely have big questions if folks in this subreddit could help with such as: 

**How to carb load in the future effectively?** many different answers I found but nothing really concrete to an effective plan

**Did I overtrain during this cycle or just peak too early?** I never did this mileage or intensity prior to this cycle. 

**How to unpack on what aspects I can improve to not bonk?** Felt fine from a hydration standpoint and thought I was decent from nutrition, so maybe more gels, or just need more endurance for the distance.

In the meantime I'm going to focus on improving my 5K/10K/HM times and perhaps consider a spring marathon locally. I might also finally look at getting a coach after 5 years of running and 3+ years training on my own and using this subreddit to give me ideas of effective training. My goal would be to time qualify for NYC Marathon in the future with a sub 1:23 which could help be set my sights on sub 3 marathon in the future! 

If you read this much, I truly appreciate it and any guidance/suggestions help!

1oojen0,https://www.reddit.com/r/stories/comments/1oojen0/i_spent_approximately_10_minutes_almost_in_tears/,"I spent approximately 10 minutes almost in tears talking to my toaster, begging it to just give my toast back when the timer ended and the slot popped up, and to my horror, there was no toast inside.","So this happened a mere two months ago. It's 8:00 p.m. and I'm starving, and like any functional adult, I decide my dinner is going to be toast, specifically a single slice of rye bread slathered with an unholy amount of strawberry jam... Definitely not because that's all I had in the cupboard.... 

Anyways, I grab my slice of rye bread from the fridge and stick it in the toaster as you do. While I wait, I'm scrolling YouTube shorts, scrolling Instagram, scrolling Reddit, basically filling my brain with brain rot and an ungodly amount of ASMR content and cute penguin videos. 

Finally, which was no more than a minute in reality, the toaster slot containing my precious dinner pops up. I put my phone down an eagerly reach for my carbs, accept, there is nothing there. The slot is empty, just like my stomach. It's at this moment that I just stare. I simply cannot comprehend what reality is showing me. I lean over the counter and squint into the hot darkness. Nothing. No toast. 

I squint into the other three slots. Still nothing. I pick up the toaster and bring each slot directly to eye level and peer-in like they owe me rent. Definitely nothing. My toast was gone. Now my lip was trembling and all I could say was, 
""Where is it!? Where is it!?"" Over and over. I stood there, and interrogated that Chrome covered box like it would tell me the truth if I just begged long enough. I even shook it a few times, like maybe I could intimidate it into giving my toast back. 

Eventually, I had no choice but to admit defeat. I grabbed two Snickers bars on the way out of the kitchen. I went to bed without my toast. 

The next morning I go down to make my morning coffee, still pissed, and I open the microwave to heat my milk, and there's a hard slab of something just sitting directly inside, no plate...yeah, it was my toast,accept it wasn't toast, it was something that had apparently been microwaved by myself into oblivion and now looked like something closer to construction material than food. 

I somehow microwaved my bread and thought I put it in the toaster, and I never realized. It's not my proudest moment. 

I still haven't apologized to the toaster. ",27,1762290530.0,stories,18,0.81,False

Dinner at the Seafood Cafe

10:30am Irish Literary Museum

2pm Legal Eagle (Sunday roast)

This is our main drinking day, hoping to hit the pubs after lunch and have enough pints to work up an appetite for a spice bag. Where’s the best place to get one and are there any watering holes we’d be fools to miss?

Day 3:

11am Book of Kells Experience

3pm Guinness Storehouse

Is there anywhere worth a stop on our way from Trinity to the Guinness Storehouse? Either for sightseeing, or somewhere with good sandwiches and cakes for lunch?

No lunch dinner plans yet, where’s nice for something tasty that won’t break the bank? We love pub food and puddings.

Now, without further ado, let's get on with the chaos !

\-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

  
Alex's existence in the Brooklyn apartment with John, the definitely-immortal-but-won't-admit-it mastermind who ran Aegis Q, drank with Lucifer, and treated Excalibur like a paperweight, was a daily descent into absurdity punctuated by culinary bribery.

By now, Alex had accepted—no, he was **certain**—that John was some kind of eternal being who'd lived through centuries, maybe millennia. The evidence was suffocating: Victorian crowns, military papers from three wars, tea with the literal Grim Reaper, whiskey with the Devil, and yesterday's bombshell that John casually ran a trillion-dollar conglomerate as a ""side hustle.""

But here's what made Alex want to throw his laptop out the window: **John still wouldn't say it out loud.**

Every confrontation ended the same way—John would deflect with tacos, pivot to Netflix, or make a joke so disarming that Alex forgot he'd asked a question. It was psychological warfare disguised as roommate chitchat, and Alex was losing.

His Excel spreadsheet now had 47 entries under ""Evidence of Immortality,"" 31 under ""Deflections/Excuses,"" and a new tab labeled ""Billionaire Nonsense"" with exactly one entry: *CEO of Aegis Q, net worth 2.3 trillion, owns Mars drones.*

Alex was building an airtight case. He just needed someone—anyone—to confirm it.

Then a quintessentially English butler showed up to complain about John's excessive wealth and deliver a ruby the size of a Fabergé egg, and Alex's brain didn't just break—it filed for bankruptcy and fled to the Cayman Islands.

# The Super-Dapper Butler

It was a drizzly Sunday morning, and Alex was nursing a coffee, still reeling from yesterday's Aegis Q revelation. John was in the kitchen, flipping pancakes while wearing his ""prop"" Russian crown (because of course he was), humming what Alex now recognized as a Renaissance-era drinking song.

A knock at the door shattered the morning calm. Not a casual knock, but a precise, dignified tap-tap-tap that screamed, *I iron my socks and my ancestors served royalty.*

Alex shuffled over, expecting a delivery or maybe Sarah finally showing up to stage an intervention. Instead, he faced a man who could've stepped out of a Downton Abbey episode.

Tall, silver-haired, and ramrod straight, the man wore a black tailcoat that looked like it cost more than the building's deed. His white gloves were pristine, his bow tie was a geometric marvel, and his posture suggested he'd been trained by ballet instructors and drill sergeants in equal measure. A monogrammed leather satchel hung from his shoulder, embossed with a subtle ""J.H.""

Alex's stomach dropped. Another mythological figure? A time-traveling aristocrat? The ghost of Alfred Pennyworth?

""Good morning, sir,"" the man said, his English accent so polished it could've buffed the crown jewels. ""I am Percival Gladstone, Mr. Harrow's personal steward. Might I speak with him?""

*Personal steward?* Alex's brain did a backflip. John had a **butler**? Of course he did. Why wouldn't the immortal CEO of a trillion-dollar empire have a butler?

""Uh, yeah, he's... making pancakes,"" Alex managed, his voice cracking. ""Come in?""

Percival glided inside like a swan navigating a landfill, his eyes briefly scanning the peeling wallpaper, the thrift-store couch, and Excalibur leaning against a pizza box. His expression remained diplomatically neutral, but Alex swore he saw the faintest twitch of disapproval.

John looked up from the stove, crown slightly askew, spatula in hand. ""Percy! Good to see you, mate. Pancake?""

Percival declined with a slight bow. ""No, thank you, sir. I'm here regarding your... acquisitions.""

Alex hovered by the counter, pretending to wipe a nonexistent spill, his ears perked like a detective at a wire tap.

# The Too-Much-Money Problem

Percival set his satchel on the table with the reverence of someone handling a holy relic, then opened it to reveal a stack of documents and a velvet box that made Alex's net worth feel like pocket change.

""Sir,"" Percival began, his tone a perfect blend of deference and exasperation, ""your latest purchases are causing... logistical issues.""

John flipped a pancake with a casual flick. ""Issues? What kind of issues?""

Percival pulled out a leather-bound ledger, adjusting his reading glasses with the precision of a surgeon. ""The vaults in Geneva are at capacity—again. The yacht in Monaco requires a second crew due to its size, and the staffing costs are becoming prohibitive. The new estate in New Zealand, complete with private vineyard and heliport, is straining our personnel resources. We simply don't have enough staff to maintain all of your properties.""

Alex's coffee mug slipped, splashing his shirt. *Vaults?* Plural? *Yacht?* *New Zealand estate with a heliport?*

John shrugged, plating pancakes like Percival was complaining about a messy closet. ""Just sell one of the islands, Percy. The Maldives one—barely use it. Or donate a vault to a museum. Keeps things tidy.""

Percival sighed—a sound so refined it could've been bottled as an ASMR track. ""With respect, sir, your wealth is... unwieldy. The gold reserves alone could destabilize markets if mismanaged. And the art collection—Picasso, da Vinci, that troublesome Van Gogh you acquired last week—requires a new climate-controlled wing. We're running out of space.""

Alex's jaw hit the floor. *Da Vinci?* John, who once burned toast and blamed the toaster, owned a **da Vinci**? And was Percival **complaining about too much money**?

""Tell you what,"" John said, sliding a pancake onto a plate and offering it to Percival, who politely declined again. ""Move the Van Gogh to the Maldives villa. Merlin likes it there. And bump the Geneva staff—hire a few more vault managers. Problem solved.""

Percival made a note in his ledger, his pen strokes as precise as a calligrapher's. ""Very well, sir. But the board also requests your input on the lunar mining project. The prototype is ready for your review.""

*Lunar mining?* Alex wanted to scream. He settled for crushing his coffee mug slightly, foam dribbling onto the counter.

John waved a hand. ""Tell them I'll swing by next week. Or send Merlin. She's better with the tech stuff anyway.""

Percival nodded, then opened the velvet box with a flourish. Inside was a ruby the size of a Fabergé egg, blood-red and glinting like it had a heartbeat. The light from the window hit it, casting prismatic beams across the room that made the already-glowing Heart of Karnataka on the coffee table look jealous.

""Your latest purchase, sir,"" Percival said, presenting it like a sommelier offering a rare wine. ""The Heart of Karnataka, acquired at auction for $250 million. Shall I add it to the Singapore vault or the private display?""

John picked up the ruby, tossing it in his hand like it was a stress ball. ""Eh, leave it here for now. Looks cool on the coffee table.""

He set it next to the stack of pizza menus, where it pulsed with an ominous glow. Alex choked on his coffee.

""Two hundred and fifty **million**?"" he spluttered, pointing at the ruby like it might explode.

Percival glanced at him, mildly surprised, as if just noticing the mortal in the room. ""A modest sum for Mr. Harrow,"" he said, then turned back to John. ""Sir, the board also requests your input on the Mars rover situation. NASA's cooperation has been... lacking.""

John snorted. ""NASA's always behind schedule. Tell the team to just do it ourselves. We've got the budget.""

""Of course, sir."" Percival packed his satchel, adjusted his gloves, and bowed slightly. ""I'll resolve the yacht issue and coordinate the vault expansion. Shall I return next month for a full estate review?""

""Sounds good, Percy. Thanks for stopping by.""

Percival left with a promise to ""address the staffing concerns,"" gliding out the door like he'd just concluded a meeting with the Queen.

The door clicked shut, and Alex stood frozen in the kitchen, his coffee forgotten, his brain attempting to process that John's **butler** had just delivered a $250 million ruby while complaining about overflowing vaults and understaffed yachts.

# Alex's Wealth-Induced Breakdown

Alex didn't wait. He rounded on John, waving his arms like an air traffic controller having a breakdown.

""OKAY. NO. STOP."" His voice hit a pitch that could've summoned dolphins. ""Your **butler**—your ACTUAL BUTLER—just complained that you're TOO RICH. You have vaults—PLURAL—in Geneva that are OVERFLOWING. You own a yacht so big it needs TWO CREWS. You bought a $250 MILLION RUBY and you're using it as a PAPERWEIGHT next to PIZZA MENUS!""

John, flipping the last pancake onto a plate, didn't even look up. ""Percy's a bit dramatic. The vaults aren't *overflowing*—they're just... full. And the ruby was on sale.""

""ON SALE?!"" Alex's voice cracked. ""It's a QUARTER OF A BILLION DOLLARS!""

John shrugged, sliding the pancake plate toward Alex. ""Auctions are competitive. I bid, I won. It's a nice rock. Want syrup?""

Alex wanted to flip the table. He wanted to grab John by his flannel collar and shake him until the truth fell out like loose change. But instead, he did what he always did: he grabbed his phone and texted Sarah.

**""JOHN'S BUTLER COMPLAINED ABOUT TOO MUCH MONEY. $250M RUBY AS PAPERWEIGHT. OWNS DA VINCI. STILL WON'T ADMIT IMMORTALITY.""**

Sarah's reply was a video of her smashing a coffee mug, captioned: **""STEAL THE RUBY. WE'RE GOING TO SOTHEBY'S.""**

Alex pocketed his phone and collapsed onto the couch, staring at the Heart of Karnataka, which now sat next to a half-empty Red Bull can, mocking his entire existence.

""John,"" he said, his voice flat with exhaustion. ""You own islands. Plural. You have a butler who manages your overflowing vaults. You just casually bought a ruby worth more than some countries' GDPs. When—WHEN—are you going to admit you're not just some guy who likes history?""

John sat across from him, pouring coffee with the ease of a man who'd probably advised emperors on tax policy. ""I mean, I *do* like history. That part's true.""

""THAT'S NOT THE POINT!""

John's smile was infuriatingly calm. ""Look, Alex, money's just a tool. I've been around long enough to accumulate some. Percy handles the boring logistics—vaults, yachts, all that. I just live my life. Keeps things simple.""

""SIMPLE?!"" Alex gestured wildly at the ruby. ""You're using a CURSED SUMERIAN GEMSTONE as a COASTER!""

""It's not cursed,"" John said, taking a sip of coffee. ""Probably. And it's Babylonian, not Sumerian. Different empires.""

Alex screamed into a couch cushion.

**The Immortal Tycoon's Nonchalance**

The next morning, John acted like nothing had happened. He made coffee—some artisanal Colombian blend that probably cost more per ounce than Alex's car payment—and hummed what Alex now recognized as a medieval tavern song.

The ruby still sat on the coffee table, glowing faintly next to a stack of unpaid utility bills. Alex stared at it, wondering if it was judging him for his student loans.

""So,"" Alex ventured, clutching his coffee mug like a life preserver, ""Percival. Your butler. How long has he worked for you?""

John flipped a waffle with the precision of a man who'd probably cooked for Macedonian armies. ""Oh, Percy? Well he wasn’t working for me personally, but about 40 years, give or take. Great guy. Very organized.""

Alex blinked. ""Forty years?""

""Yeah, his grandfather worked for mine before that. The Gladstone family's been with my family for a few generations. Super loyal.""

""Generations,"" Alex repeated, his voice hollow. He opened his laptop, pulling up his spreadsheet.

**Sheet: ""Evidence of Immortality""**  
New entry: *Butler's family has served his ‘family’ for generations. Owns vaults (plural), yachts, islands, da Vinci. Bought $250M ruby casually.*

**Sheet: ""Deflections/Excuses""**  
New entry: *""Money's just a tool."" ""Percy handles the boring logistics."" ""Want syrup?""*

**Sheet: ""Food Bribes""**  
New entry: *Pancakes, waffles (pending).*

John slid a waffle onto a plate, perfectly golden, and handed it to Alex. ""You're updating the spreadsheet again, aren't you?""

Alex looked up, fork frozen mid-air. ""How do you know about the spreadsheet?""

John grinned, pouring syrup over his own waffle. ""You mutter about it in your sleep. 'Evidence tab... deflections tab...' It's endearing.""

Alex wanted to cry. Or laugh. Or both. He settled for eating the waffle, which was—of course—perfect.

The rent was still cheap. Merlin's cookies were still in the fridge. And John was still the most infuriating, enigmatic, deflection-champion billionaire immortal roommate in the history of Brooklyn.

Alex wasn't moving out. Not yet. But if the next visitor was the ghost of Andrew Carnegie asking John for investment tips, he was grabbing the ruby, Excalibur, and maybe Percy's phone number—because clearly, the butler knew more than he was letting on.",2,1762290467.0,redditserials,0,1.0,False
1oojdit,https://www.reddit.com/r/HeliumNetwork/comments/1oojdit/how_helium_hotspot_handle_your_mobile_data/,How Helium Hotspot Handle Your Mobile Data,"When your mobile phone connects through a Helium Hotspot, it’s not random Wi-Fi - it’s something called **offload**.

That means instead of sending your data through a big carrier tower (like [T-Mobile](https://www.fierce-network.com/5g/t-mobile-allows-helium-mobile-crypto-carrier-ride-its-5g-network), [AT&T](https://www.fierce-network.com/newswire/att-partners-helium-better-wi-fi-offload) etc), your phone *“offloads”* some of that traffic to a nearby Helium Hotspot. This helps take pressure off the main network and gives users better coverage - especially indoors or in areas with weak tower signal.

# Here’s how it works 👇

1. **Finding a better signal** Your phone checks in the background: “Is there a Helium Hotspot nearby that’s faster or closer than the tower?” If there is, it’ll automatically switch over - that’s the *offload*. Your carrier manages this seamlessly; you stay on their plan while using better infrastructure.  
2. **Secure handshake** The Hotspot doesn’t just let anyone connect. It authenticates through Helium Network to confirm your phone is a valid user - kind of like checking your ticket before letting you in.  
3. **Connection happens** Once approved, your phone starts using that Hotspot’s internet to send and receive data - watching videos, scrolling TikTok, whatever - just like normal. You probably wouldn’t even notice the switch.  
4. **Data is counted** Helium’s backend records how much data passed through that Hotspot. It doesn’t track what you did, only the total usage.  
5. **Hotspot owner gets rewarded** Because that Hotspot helped carry real mobile traffic, the owner earns HNT rewards for contributing to the network. The more actual offload that happens, the more useful the network becomes.  Here’s the clever part: When your data flows through Helium, HNT tokens are burned (removed from circulation), creating real utility.  
6. **If no hotspot’s nearby** Your phone just stays on the regular carrier towers - so you’re always connected either way.

**Real-World Example** 

Think of your favourite coffee shop with spotty service. A Helium Hotspot there could become your phone's preferred connection point - seamlessly improving your coverage while rewarding the shop owner for helping build the network.

**In simple terms** 

Helium uses offload to move your data through local Hotspots when possible, which helps expand coverage, reduce tower load, and reward regular people for helping power the network. It's basically turning coffee shops, apartment buildings, and businesses into part of the carrier infrastructure.   
  
**Who Benefits?** 

**Carriers**: 

Reduced infrastructure costs and better coverage in congested areas 

**Users**: Better coverage, especially indoors and in weak signal areas 

**Hotspot Owners**: Earn HNT tokens for providing coverage - the economic engine powering decentralized connectivity. 

**Have You Experienced It Yet?**

## ## Why Go Round? The Magic of Circular Rugs

👉 [Click here to check the product on Amazon](https://starton.pages.dev//?q=round%20machine%20washable%20rug)

Before we even get to the washable part, let's talk about the shape. The sharp lines and right angles of most furniture can make a room feel rigid. A round rug is an instant softening agent.

*   **Creates a Focal Point:** A round rug naturally draws the eye, anchoring a space and defining a specific zone, like a reading nook or a conversation area.
*   **Softens a Room:** The curves provide a beautiful contrast to rectangular furniture, windows, and doorways, adding a touch of organic flow.
*   **Perfect for Small Spaces:** Round rugs can make a small room feel larger because they don’t visually “cut off” the space the way a rectangular rug can.
*   **Ideal Under Round Tables:** This is a classic design rule for a reason! A round rug under a circular dining or coffee table creates a harmonious, balanced look.

This is the feature that converts skeptics into fans. The ability to wash an entire area rug is revolutionary for homeowners, pet owners, and parents.

Say goodbye to:
*   **Expensive professional cleanings.**
*   **Renting clunky steam cleaners.**
*   **Stubborn, lingering odors.**
*   **The anxiety of every little spill.**

A truly **machine washable rug** gives you freedom. It's a hygienic choice, eliminating dust mites, pet dander, and allergens that get trapped deep in the fibers of traditional rugs. For anyone with allergies, this is a game-changer.

> **Pro-Tip:** Not all ""washable"" rugs are created equal. Look for ones specifically designed to fit in a standard home washing machine (typically 5x8 or smaller).

## ## Where to Use Your Round Machine Washable Rug

👉 [Click here to check the product on Amazon](https://starton.pages.dev//?q=round%20machine%20washable%20rug)

The versatility of these rugs is astounding. Here are some of the best places to deploy them in your home.

### ### In the Living Room
Place a medium-sized round rug in the center of your main seating area. It should be large enough that the front legs of your sofa and chairs can sit on it, creating a cohesive and inviting space.

👉 [Click here to check the product on Amazon](https://starton.pages.dev//?q=round%20machine%20washable%20rug)

### ### In the Nursery or Kid's Room
This is a no-brainer. From spilled juice to play-doh accidents, a kid's room is a high-traffic zone for messes. A soft, washable rug provides a comfortable place to play and a sanity-saving solution for parents. Look for **low-pile, cotton options** for maximum softness and washability.

### ### Under the Dining Table
As mentioned, a round rug under a round dining table is a designer's dream. Choose one that is large enough so that chairs remain on the rug even when pulled out. When (not if) food drops, cleanup is as simple as shaking it off and tossing it in the wash.

👉 [Click here to check the product on Amazon](https://starton.pages.dev//?q=round%20machine%20washable%20rug)

### ### The Bedroom Oasis
Place a large round rug under your bed, allowing it to peek out from the bottom and sides. It gives your feet a soft, warm place to land every morning and adds a cozy, layered look to your decor.

### ### Entryways and Mudrooms
A smaller, durable round rug by the door is perfect for catching dirt and mud. Since it can be washed frequently, you can actually keep this high-traffic area clean without hassle. Look for a **rug with a non-slip backing** for safety.

Ready to find your perfect rug? Keep these key factors in mind to ensure you get one you’ll love for years to come.

### ### Material Matters
The material determines the rug's feel, durability, and how well it washes.
*   **Cotton:** Often soft, lightweight, and easy to wash. Great for casual spaces.
*   **Chenille:** Known for its plush, velvety feel. It's incredibly soft and often holds up well in the wash.
*   **Polyester/Recycled Materials:** Very durable, stain-resistant, and often the most affordable. They can be less soft than natural fibers but are champions of practicality.

👉 [Click here to check the product on Amazon](https://starton.pages.dev//?q=round%20machine%20washable%20rug)

### ### Check the Label (and Your Washer!)
Always double-check the care instructions. Most recommend washing in cold water on a gentle cycle and air-drying to prevent shrinking. Make sure the rug's dimensions and weight are suitable for your home machine's capacity.

### ### Non-Slip Backing is a Must
Safety first! Many machine washable rugs come with a built-in non-slip backing. This prevents the rug from bunching up or sliding on hard floors, which is a crucial feature, especially in high-traffic areas.

👉 [Click here to check the product on Amazon](https://starton.pages.dev//?q=round%20machine%20washable%20rug)

### ### Thickness and Pile
*   **Low-Pile:** Thin, flat weave. Easier to wash, dries faster, and great for placing under furniture or in dining areas.
*   **Plush/High-Pile:** Thicker and softer. More luxurious underfoot but may take longer to dry and could be too bulky for some washing machines.

I'm still shaking as I type this. I flew in Tuesday for my cousin's wedding this Saturday. We grew up together. My mom basically raised him after his parents divorced and his dad bailed. He's not just my cousin. He's my brother in every way that matters.

Wednesday night he texted asking if I wanted to grab drinks at this dive bar near his apartment. Just us. He said his fiancée was having a girls night and he needed to decompress before the wedding chaos really started. I said hell yeah. Haven't had real one on one time with him in months.

We're sitting at the bar talking about normal stuff. His new job. My disaster of a dating life. We're laughing. He seems good. Maybe a little tense but I figured that's just wedding jitters. Then around 9:30 his phone starts blowing up.

He checks it and his whole face changes. He goes white.

I ask what's wrong. He says his fiancée is pissed because apparently she's not at a girls night. She's at the same bar. Three tables behind us. With her friends.

I turn around and sure enough there she is. Staring daggers at us.

He didn't know she'd be there. I definitely didn't know. But she clearly thinks this was some kind of setup or that he was avoiding her or something. She gets up and starts walking over. Her friends are trying to grab her arm but she yanks away.

She gets to us and immediately starts. Loud enough that people are staring.

""So this is what you're doing? Hiding from me at a bar?""

My cousin tries to calm her down. ""Babe, I didn't know you'd be here. I texted you earlier about getting drinks with my cousin.""

""Bullshit. You're avoiding me.""

I stay quiet. This feels like a them thing. But then she turns on me.

""And you. You're helping him avoid me four days before our wedding.""

I say, very calmly, that I just got into town yesterday and wanted to catch up with my cousin. That's it.

She's not hearing it. She's getting louder. My cousin stands up and tries to guide her away from the bar. He's saying let's go outside and talk. Let's not do this here.

That's when it happens.

She shoves him. Hard. He stumbles back against the bar stool. Then she swings. Closed fist. Catches him right in the jaw. The crack is loud enough that the bartender looks over.

My cousin just freezes. He's not fighting back. He's got his hands up like he's trying to protect his face. She hits him again. Then she goes for his throat. Both hands. She's choking him.

I jump up and I'm yelling at her to stop. The bartender is coming around. Her friends are finally running over. Someone pulls her off him.

My cousin is coughing. There are red marks all over his neck. Scratches down his face where her nails caught him. His lip is bleeding.

The bartender asks if he wants to call the cops. My cousin says no. He's humiliated. Everyone in the bar watched this happen.

His fiancée is crying now. Saying she's sorry. She didn't mean it. She just got so scared when she saw him there and thought he was pulling away from her. The wedding stress made her snap. It won't happen again.

Her friends take her outside. The bartender gives my cousin some ice.

I'm sitting there in complete shock. I don't know what to say. Finally I just ask him if she's done this before.

He won't look at me. He says no. Never. This was totally out of character. The wedding planning has been really stressful for her. Her family is a lot. She's been overwhelmed.

I tell him that's not an excuse. I tell him that what I just watched was assault. That if the roles were reversed he'd be in handcuffs right now. That this is a massive red flag and he needs to seriously reconsider getting married on Saturday.

He gets defensive. Says I don't know her like he does. Says she's been nothing but loving and kind for the two years they've been together. Says this was a one time thing and they'll work through it.

I push back. I say this is not normal. This is not wedding jitters. This is abuse. And it's only going to get worse once they're married. Once she feels like she really has him locked down.

He tells me to drop it. He pays our tab and leaves. Doesn't even let me give him a ride. Just walks out.

I go back to my hotel and I can't sleep. All I can see is her hands around his throat. The scratches on his face. The way he just took it.

Thursday morning I call my mom. I tell her everything. I'm expecting her to freak out. To tell me we need to stop this wedding. To protect him.

Instead she gets quiet. Then she asks me why I'm stirring up drama right before his wedding. She says every couple fights. She says his fiancée probably just had too much to drink and got emotional. She says I need to let him handle his own relationship.

I'm floored. I tell her this wasn't a fight. This was physical violence. She choked him in public.

My mom says I'm exaggerating. That I'm too protective of him. That I need to stay out of it because if I cause problems and the wedding gets called off, he'll resent me forever. She'll resent me.

I hang up feeling insane. Like I imagined the whole thing.

Thursday afternoon my cousin texts me. Says he told his fiancée I was uncomfortable after what happened and she wants to apologize. Wants to meet for coffee. Just the three of us.

I don't want to go. But I also want to look her in the eye and see if she shows any real remorse.

We meet at a Starbucks. She's got sunglasses on even though we're inside. When she takes them off to dab at fake tears I can tell she's wearing way more makeup than necessary. Covering something maybe.

She apologizes. Says she was drunk. Says she has never done anything like that before and is horrified at herself. Says she's started therapy. Says she loves my cousin more than anything and would never hurt him.

The whole time she's talking she's got her hand on his arm. Squeezing it. He's nodding along. Backing up everything she says.

I don't believe a word of it. Something in my gut is screaming that this is an act. That she's done this before. That he's covering for her.

I tell her I appreciate the apology but that what she did was serious. That I'm worried about my cousin. That marriage is permanent and this kind of behavior can't happen again.

She gets teary. Says she knows. Says it won't. Then she looks at my cousin and says she thinks maybe the wedding is too much stress. Maybe they should postpone.

My cousin immediately says no. Says they're not postponing. Says everything is fine and they're getting married Saturday as planned.

She smiles at me. It doesn't reach her eyes. She says see, we're fine. Everything is fine.

I leave that coffee shop knowing I've just been played. She offered to postpone knowing he'd refuse. Now if anything goes wrong she can say she tried to slow things down and he pushed forward.

Friday my phone starts blowing up. Texts from aunts and uncles and cousins. All saying the same thing. That I'm trying to sabotage the wedding. That I'm jealous. That I need to apologize to the bride and keep my mouth shut tomorrow.

Apparently his fiancée told people I attacked her at the bar. That I was drunk and aggressive and made her feel unsafe. That my cousin had to defend her from me.

I'm getting called a liar. A troublemaker. A traitor.

My mom calls and says I'm not welcome to sit with the family at the ceremony. That I've caused enough damage.

I lose it. I tell her fine. I won't sit with the family. But I'm not staying quiet either.

Friday night I do something I'm not proud of but don't regret. I text my cousin one last time. I tell him I love him. That I'll always be there for him. And that I'm going to make sure he sees exactly who he's marrying before he makes the biggest mistake of his life.

Then I wait until 11pm when I know he's at his bachelor party. I drive to the venue where the rehearsal dinner was. I know his fiancée is there late with her mom doing last minute decoration setup.

I park across the street and I wait. Around midnight she comes out. She's on the phone. I start recording on my phone.

She's screaming at whoever is on the other end. Calling them a useless piece of shit. Saying if they fuck up one more thing she'll make sure they regret it. Her voice is pure venom. Nothing like the sweet apologetic woman from coffee.

Then her mom comes out. Asks who she's talking to. The fiancée snaps at her. Tells her to mind her own business. Calls her an overbearing bitch.

Her mom looks shocked. Tries to calm her down. The fiancée shoves her. Not hard enough to make her fall but hard enough to make her stumble. Then she gets in her car and peels out.

I've got it all on video. The yelling. The shove. The mask completely off.

I send the video to my cousin. No message. Just the video.

Then I send it to my mom.

Then I send it to the family group chat.

My phone explodes. Calls and texts coming in so fast it crashes. I turn it off.

Saturday morning I don't go to the wedding. I wait at my hotel. Around noon my cousin calls. I can hear crying in the background. Chaos.

He says the wedding is off. His fiancée came clean about everything after he showed her the video. This wasn't the first time she'd been violent. She'd hit him twice before but convinced him it was his fault. She'd been hiding a serious anger problem that got worse when she drank. Her ex has a restraining order against her that she never told my cousin about.

He says he's destroyed. Humiliated. Heartbroken. But he knows I saved him from something so much worse.

He also says half the family still hates me. They think I went too far. That I should have stayed out of it. That recording her without permission was a violation. That I humiliated them all by airing their dirty laundry.

My mom is barely speaking to me. She says I was right but I handled it wrong. That I've damaged family relationships that will take years to repair.

Some cousins have reached out saying I'm a hero. Others have blocked me.

The bride's family is threatening to sue me for defamation and invasion of privacy. My cousin says they won't actually do it because then everything becomes public record but they're pissed.

And I'm sitting here wondering if I just made everything worse. If I should have just let him marry her and figure it out on his own. If ruining a wedding and splitting a family apart makes me the asshole even if I was trying to protect someone I love.

So was I wrong to blow up his wedding to prove who she really was?

1ooj4v3,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1ooj4v3,"35M – Heart “skipping” sensation, Apple Watch ECG attached – PVCs?","Hi all,

About a week ago I started noticing what feels like a “skipped” or “hard” heartbeat every so often throughout the day. It happens randomly, usually when sitting or lying down, and can occur 1–2 times in a row, then stop for a while, then come back later. No chest pain, dizziness, or shortness of breath, just the strong heartbeat sensation.



**About me:**

• Age: 35

• Height/weight: 6’1”, 230 lbs

• Lifestyle: generally healthy diet, no smoking, mild exercise

• Caffeine: **used to drink** 1–2 Reign energy drinks + 1 coffee daily. Now cut back to 1 coffee AM and maybe 1 energy drink PM. Symptoms seem unchanged with or without caffeine.

• NSAID use: \~600mg Advil almost daily for headaches/body aches



**Current medications:**

• Fenofibrate 145mg daily

• Losartan potassium 50mg daily

• *Was* taking One-A-Day (blue bottle) multivitamin for about a week — stopped today, symptoms still happening

(No other supplements or recreational drugs)



**Symptoms timeline:**

• Started \~7 days ago

• Happens at rest, not during exertion

• Lasts a few seconds at a time, maybe happens randomly 10–20 times per day

• Feels like a pause + a hard thump afterward



**Apple Watch ECG:**

I was able to capture the sensation while recording an ECG. Watch labeled it “Sinus Rhythm” but I can see a noticeably early beat + long pause. (Looks like PVC?)



**Questions:**



1. Does this look like PVCs or PACs?
2. Is this something that can be benign, or worth urgent evaluation?
3. Could caffeine, NSAID use, or the multivitamin be a trigger?
4. Anything I should *stop immediately* or get checked (electrolytes, thyroid, etc.)?

Added the coffee grounds to the French press, then poured in the hot water.

Set a timer for 4 minutes, and at the end, gently broke the crust on top.

1ooiz7w,https://www.reddit.com/r/Coherance/comments/1ooiz7w/meta_pattern_5_information_flow/,Meta Pattern 5: Information Flow,"At the heart of every dynamic system—physical, biological, cognitive, or social—lies a tension between disorder and order, between entropy and coherence. Entropy disperses energy, pushing systems toward equilibrium and randomness. Coherence gathers information into organized patterns, resisting that decay. The interplay between these opposing tendencies gives rise to everything we call life, mind, and meaning. Every act of perception, every heartbeat, every storm, every civilization is an expression of information flowing toward coherence, even as it is ultimately dissolved back into entropy.

Entropy, in thermodynamic terms, measures the number of ways a system can be arranged without changing its overall energy. It is the statistical tendency of isolated systems to move from order to disorder, from concentrated energy to diffusion. A cup of hot coffee cools because thermal energy spreads into the surrounding air; mountains erode because gravity and wind gradually randomize their structure. The second law of thermodynamics—entropy always increases—appears to declare an inevitable doom for complexity.

Yet entropy is not evil; it is the background condition for creativity. Without the spreading of energy, there would be no motion, no reaction, no change. Entropy is the canvas upon which coherence paints.

Against this tide of disorder, local systems emerge that temporarily reverse it. Life is the prime example: an organism maintains internal order by consuming energy and exporting entropy. The physicist Erwin Schrödinger called this process *negative entropy*, or *neg-entropy*: the extraction of order from environmental flux. Plants convert sunlight into chemical structure; animals metabolize that structure into motion and thought. Each is a tiny vortex of coherence spinning within the wider river of entropy.

Coherence is not the opposite of entropy but its complement. Where entropy disperses, coherence condenses. The two form a dialectic, a cosmic heartbeat: expansion and contraction, dissolution and organization. The universe uses entropy as the raw material for complexity.

The link between energy and coherence is *information*. Information, in the sense defined by Claude Shannon, measures reduction of uncertainty—how much order or predictability is introduced into a system. A random signal has high entropy but low information; a structured signal has lower entropy and higher information.

Living systems process information continuously. DNA encodes instructions for maintaining structure; the nervous system converts sensory flux into patterns of meaning. Information does not negate entropy but organizes it into usable form. The brain, for example, consumes enormous energy to maintain a low-entropy state, continuously translating chaotic sensory input into coherent models of reality.

The philosopher Gregory Bateson defined information as “a difference that makes a difference.” Coherence arises when such differences are arranged into patterns that sustain themselves. The universe, seen this way, is a self-organizing field of differences folding into new configurations.

Feedback transforms random flow into structured behavior. Negative feedback stabilizes systems—thermostats regulating temperature, enzymes modulating metabolism, minds maintaining equilibrium. Positive feedback amplifies fluctuations—cultural fads, population booms, or neural reinforcement learning. Together, these loops create self-regulation and adaptation.

In thermodynamics, feedback appears in *dissipative structures*, a concept introduced by Ilya Prigogine. When energy flows through an open system far from equilibrium, new patterns emerge spontaneously: convection cells in heated fluids, chemical oscillations, or spiral galaxies. These structures persist not by defying entropy but by harnessing its flow—transforming disorder into rhythm. Coherence is therefore not imposed from outside but *arises from the very currents of decay*.

Evolution is a grand narrative of information flowing toward coherence. Random mutations—entropy at the genetic level—generate variability; natural selection filters that variability into adaptive order. Over billions of years, this feedback loop has produced organisms capable of perceiving and modifying their own environments. Each new level of complexity is a new form of coherence—cells, multicellular organisms, nervous systems, societies.

The process is not linear but rhythmic. Periods of stability alternate with bursts of diversification. Extinctions clear the field; new species radiate to fill it. Entropy clears; coherence rebuilds. This alternation is the signature of creative evolution: chaos fertilizing order.

The human mind is a neg-entropic machine par excellence. It continuously organizes chaotic sensory input into stable perceptions. Neural networks, both biological and artificial, achieve this by strengthening patterns that reduce prediction error. Every thought is an act of entropy reduction: the condensation of possible meanings into a coherent idea.

When coherence breaks down—through trauma, illness, or overload—mental experience becomes disordered. Psychosis, anxiety, and cognitive fragmentation can be understood as disruptions in the brain’s coherence-generating loops. Healing involves reestablishing synchrony between levels of information processing—between emotion, cognition, and physiology.

Meditation, art, and contemplation promote coherence by aligning neural oscillations and harmonizing attention. These states do not eliminate entropy but balance it, transforming inner noise into rhythm. Creativity, too, depends on oscillating between chaos and order: the free generation of ideas (entropy) followed by disciplined selection (coherence).

Civilizations, like organisms, sustain coherence through information flow. Communication networks, institutions, and shared myths act as feedback systems that regulate collective behavior. When information circulates freely and feedback functions efficiently, societies adapt; when it stagnates or amplifies noise, they destabilize.

Historically, cultural evolution mirrors thermodynamics. Empires rise by concentrating energy—economic, military, ideological—and fall when entropy overtakes their capacity to manage complexity. Technological and informational revolutions periodically reset the cycle, introducing new modes of coherence. The printing press, the internet, and artificial intelligence each represent jumps in the efficiency of information flow.

Yet coherence at one scale can produce entropy at another. Global communication connects minds but also amplifies noise. The challenge of the 21st century is maintaining coherent meaning structures amid accelerating information flow—a planetary feedback problem.

Systems thrive at the boundary between chaos and order—a state complexity theorists call the *edge of chaos*. Here, entropy and coherence balance to maximize adaptability. Too much order, and systems become rigid; too much disorder, and they dissolve. Life, thought, and creativity inhabit this narrow corridor. The brain, for example, oscillates between stability and instability; small fluctuations keep it responsive without descending into chaos.

At this edge, novelty arises. A stable equilibrium traps a system in repetition; pure chaos erases all pattern. The dance between entropy and coherence produces what mathematician Stuart Kauffman called the “adjacent possible”: new configurations that extend order without destroying it. Evolution, innovation, and learning all proceed by exploring this edge.

Physicist Rolf Landauer famously declared, “Information is physical.” Every bit of information has an energy cost to create or erase. This insight reveals a deep equivalence between knowledge and energy flow. The formation of memory, the crystallization of thought, the building of culture—all require work: the expenditure of energy to resist entropy.

Meaning, then, is not abstract but thermodynamic. It is the configuration of energy into patterns that persist long enough to be recognized. When you understand something—when disparate facts cohere into insight—you experience a local drop in entropy: uncertainty collapses into structure. This is why insight feels warm, luminous; it is an energetic condensation of understanding.

Zooming outward, the universe itself can be viewed as an immense information processor. From quantum fluctuations to galaxies, from chemistry to consciousness, it continuously transforms randomness into form. Physicist John Wheeler summarized this as *it from bit*: reality arises from information exchanges at the most fundamental level.

Quantum systems embody this tension directly. Before measurement, a particle exists as a superposition of possibilities—high entropy. Measurement collapses the wavefunction into a specific state—coherence. Observation thus transforms potential into actuality, linking consciousness and entropy in a shared process of information refinement.

At cosmic scales, gravitational feedback gathers diffuse matter into stars and galaxies, forging elements and structures that feed later cycles of complexity. Each star’s death disperses heavy elements, increasing entropy but seeding new worlds. Creation and dissolution alternate endlessly—entropy birthing coherence, coherence dissolving back into entropy.

Humans intuitively recognize the beauty of coherence emerging from chaos: the swirl of a hurricane, the veins of marble, the pattern of frost. Art mirrors this process by imposing form on flux. Painters, composers, and writers channel emotional entropy into structured expression. The creative act is the conversion of raw intensity into communicable order—a thermodynamic miracle at the level of meaning.

In music, harmony arises from the interference of sound waves; dissonance resolves into consonance. In visual art, contrast and balance generate coherence from visual noise. Every artistic creation is a small neg-entropic act—a pocket of order sustained by attention and care.

Seen through the lens of information flow, the universe is neither a machine winding down nor a chaos without direction. It is a field of constant transformation, where entropy and coherence interpenetrate. Complexity emerges when information flows efficiently enough to sustain feedback loops that delay equilibrium.

Life and mind are not exceptions to this process but its most refined expressions. We are the universe learning to concentrate information, reflecting on its own coherence, and radiating that insight back into the world. Every act of understanding extends the lifespan of order; every moment of awareness is the cosmos tightening its focus.

If coherence is the measure of life, then ethics can be framed as the art of sustaining meaningful information flow. Destruction, ignorance, and exploitation accelerate entropy; creativity, compassion, and communication cultivate coherence. A coherent society is one in which feedback between individuals and collectives functions harmoniously—where information is neither hoarded nor lost, but circulates to enrich all levels.

Sustainability, in this view, is thermodynamic as much as moral. To live well is to participate consciously in the flow of coherence: to take in disorder, organize it into value, and return it to the system enriched. Every ecosystem, every relationship, every creative act depends on this reciprocal movement.

Information flow toward coherence is the invisible rhythm of existence. Entropy disperses; feedback gathers; together they weave the pulse of becoming. The cosmos stabilizes itself not by resisting chaos but by dancing with it, shaping turbulence into form and form back into turbulence. Each moment of clarity, each spark of life, each act of love is a brief crystallization of coherence in an ocean of entropy.

To understand this dance is to recognize our role within it: not as masters of order but as participants in the great exchange between chaos and form. We are whirlpools of meaning in the flow of energy, temporary but radiant, gathering coherence just long enough to pass it on.",1,1762289589.0,Coherance,0,1.0,False

Yet deforestation, mining, industrial agriculture, and biomass harvesting continue to erode these vital ecosystems. 

Every purchase we make and habit we change at home can help reverse this trend. Becoming a forest-friendly household means consciously reducing demand for products and practices that destroy forests while supporting those that protect and restore them.


Why Forests Matter

~ Forests store immense amounts of carbon, helping stabilize the global climate.

~ They regulate rainfall, purify air, and anchor soils that prevent flooding and erosion.

~ Forest biodiversity supports pollinators, medicinal plants, and thousands of species that keep ecosystems balanced.

~ Protecting forests also protects Indigenous communities whose livelihoods and cultural heritage depend on them.


Here are ways to support forest health through your everday choices:


1. Address Agricultural Drivers of Deforestation

Over 70% of tropical deforestation is linked to agriculture — mostly livestock grazing and animal feed production.

~ Eat plant-based meals to reduce demand for soy and corn grown for livestock feed and forest clearing for cattle ranching.

~ Buy shade-grown coffee and cocoa that preserve forest canopy habitats.

~ Support regenerative farms that avoid clearing new land and restore soil health.

~ Compost food waste instead of sending it to landfills, reducing methane emissions and enriching soil naturally.

Dietary change is one of the most powerful levers for reducing pressure on forests worldwide.


2. Choose Tree-Free Household Products

Replace tree-based paper goods with recycled or plant-based alternatives.

~ Paper towels: Use reusable cloth kitchen towels or unpaper towels made from bamboo or hemp.

~ Toilet paper: Choose 100% recycled or bamboo brands (look for FSC or Rainforest Alliance certifications).

~ Tissues: Use handkerchiefs or 100% recycled paper tissue.

~ Notebooks and printer paper: Opt for 100% post-consumer recycled paper or tree-free paper (sugarcane, hemp, bamboo).

~ Napkins and wipes: Use washable cloth napkins and natural-fiber cleaning cloths.

Each of these swaps reduces the need for virgin wood pulp and helps protect primary forests from logging.


3. Limit Mining Impacts Through Conscious Consumption

Mining for metals and minerals devastates forest landscapes and watersheds.

~ Buy used or refurbished electronics and jewelry to reduce demand for new raw materials.

~ Recycle electronics properly at e-waste centers to recover valuable metals (search.earth911.com)

~ Support ethical brands that commit to fair-mined or recycled materials.

~ Advocate for stronger mining regulations that protect forest ecosystems.

~ Participate in (or launch) a local buynothingproject.org program.

Every time you repair, reuse, or recycle, you reduce the need for destructive extraction.


4. Oppose Biomass Forest Harvesting

Burning trees for energy may sound renewable, but large-scale biomass production is depleting forests and releasing stored carbon.

~ Support wind, solar, and geothermal energy, not biomass power plants.

~ Advocate against subsidies for forest biomass in your state or region.

~ Choose renewable electricity providers that exclude wood burning from their energy mix.

~ Spread awareness: many people don’t realize biomass energy often comes directly from clear-cut forests.


5. Support Reforestation, Conservation & Forest Justice

~ Donate to or volunteer with organizations protecting old-growth forests and restoring degraded ones (Rainforest Trust, One Tree Planted, Ecosystem Restoration Communities).

~ Plant native trees locally and advocate for urban canopy programs.

~ Buy FSC-certified wood and paper when you can’t avoid them.

~ Support Indigenous land rights movements, which are proven to protect forests more effectively than many government efforts.",2,1762289372.0,INFPIdeas,0,1.0,False

Someone acts a little *too* nice, lingers in conversations, stares a moment too long, and suddenly you’re spiraling. “Is he just polite or is he into me?” You're looking for signs. But if you search “signs he likes you” on TikTok, you’ll be fed a junk buffet of vague, unhelpful advice from influencers who turn every eye contact into a proposal. 

So, I dug into relationship psychology and communication science, books, behavioral studies, and neuroscience-backed sources, to figure out what the actual signs are when a guy likes you, especially when he’s not outright saying it. Some of this may feel subtle. That’s the point. Most guys won’t confess interest directly, but their body and behavior will betray what they feel. Here's what to look for.

Some are obvious. Some are micro-signals. But all are backed by real research, not vibes.

**If he does these things, odds are high he’s interested:**

- **He mirrors your body language unconsciously**  
  Research from *Psychology Today* and Dr. Albert Mehrabian’s work on nonverbal cues shows that people tend to mimic the posture and gestures of someone they’re attracted to. If he crosses his legs when you do, touches his face when you do, or shifts his head angle to match yours, that’s not just coincidence.

- **He finds excuses to be near you, even when there's no real reason**  
  From the book *Attached* by Amir Levine and Rachel Heller, people with romantic interest will subconsciously seek proximity to the object of their affection. If he’s always hovering around your desk, joining events he usually skips, or randomly appearing wherever you are, he’s not just “bored.”

- **He remembers tiny details you shared**  
  This is one of the strongest signs. Our brains prioritize info tied to potential emotional bonds. If he remembers your favorite coffee order, that offhand thing you said about your grandma, or the artist you mentioned liking once, it means he’s paying attention specifically to *you*, not just making polite conversation.

- **His voice changes subtly when talking to you**  
  According to a study in the *Journal of Nonverbal Behavior*, men will often unconsciously lower their voice tone when talking to someone they’re attracted to. It’s a primal cue of mating behavior. If his tone deepens, or if he tries to sound more “smooth”, he’s probably into you.

- **He gets protective or defensive around you**  
  If someone slightly insults you and he steps in or gets visibly tense, that’s not just “being nice.” This is tied to the neurochemical oxytocin, which fuels bonding behavior and makes people more sensitive to perceived threats. If he sticks up for you or gets annoyed when others treat you badly, it’s likely romantic.

- **He follows up, but subtly**  
  This one shows up through DMs like “Did you get home safe?” or “Made me think of you.” According to *Modern Romance* by Aziz Ansari (yes, the stand-up guy actually collaborated with legit sociologists), men who like you try to stay in your awareness even after the in-person interaction ends.

- **He’s weirdly engaged when you talk, even about boring stuff**  
  If you’re rambling about your group project or complaining about the DMV, and he’s nodding, asking follow-ups, and not checking his phone, that’s massive. Dr. John Gottman's research shows individuals show “bids for connection” by tuning into small emotional moments, even when the content isn’t exciting.

- **He acts nervous or fidgety around you**  
  According to *The Social Animal* by Elliot Aronson, anxiety and attraction often show up together. If he stumbles over words, touches his neck, adjusts his clothes or suddenly starts over-explaining, he’s probably not just awkward, he’s anxious *because* he likes you.

- **His friends act different when you’re around**  
  This is classic middle school behavior with a scientific basis. People often indirectly express romantic interest through their social group. If his friends tease him around you, glance at him when you speak, or suddenly become super smiley, it’s a group tell.

- **His energy spikes when you walk into the room**  
  Dopamine-driven responses mean that attraction energizes us. If he’s tired then suddenly lights up when you walk in, or becomes more animated, he’s not just having a sugar rush, it’s neuroscience.

- **He tries to impress you, but not in a show-off way**  
  Subtle flexing, talking about his job when he doesn’t usually, offering to help you with tasks, giving you music or book recs he thinks will make him look “deep.” It’s preening, but evolved. Biologically, we’re wired to display value when we’re courting.

**If you want to go beyond body language and decode intent, a few resources that are actually worth your time:**

- *What Every BODY Is Saying* by Joe Navarro  
  Navarro, a former FBI agent, breaks down how to read micro-signals. It's not for dating per se, but if you want to become a body language Sherlock, this book is pure gold. You’ll never unsee these signs again. Best nonverbal decoding book I’ve ever read.

- *Attached* by Amir Levine and Rachel Heller  
  It breaks down how different attachment styles play out in relationships. You'll start to recognize how someone shows interest based on how secure or avoidant they are. This book will make you question half the people you’ve dated. Insanely good read.

- *The Art of Charm* podcast  
  Has amazing interviews with relationship experts, body language scientists, and behavioral economists. One of the most practical pods for understanding attraction cues and social dynamics.

- *Matthew Hussey’s YouTube channel*  
  Love him or hate him, his short videos often actually hit on the behavioral patterns guys follow when they’re trying to hide (or not-so-hide) a crush. If you want to laugh while you learn, it’s surprisingly helpful.

- Insight Timer (app)  
  Has a bunch of guided talks and meditations around emotional resilience, self-worth, and dating confidence. If you’re constantly spiraling because of mixed signals, this app helps anchor you.

- Finch  
  This self-care app helps you build daily confidence rituals. From journaling about your interactions to tracking how someone made you feel. A great way to reflect without overthinking everything.

- BeFreed  
  This is a personalized learning app that basically turns the best relationship psychology books and expert podcasts into bite-sized audio tailored just for you. You set your goals (like emotional clarity, understanding attraction, etc.) and it builds an adaptive learning plan. It even lets you choose the podcast voice tone and duration, from 10 to 40 minutes. I picked a sarcastic-sounding host because it makes serious stuff more fun. What I love most is that it learns from what I listen to and builds my personal growth roadmap over time. It covers all the books I just mentioned and more. If you’re trying to grow 1% every day, this is a cheat code.

Understanding someone's interest isn't about decoding cryptic emojis or post-stalking habits. It’s science, psychology, and a little gut instinct. Learn to read behavior like a language. Once you do, you’ll never look at casual interactions the same again.

Loveland will probably forever be my favorite, no matter what gets added to my collection in the future. Everything about it is just perfect. Lonnie is the GOAT.

Mulatu got that high class, sexy spy vibe. Feels like it puts me in the middle of an Archer episode. 

Sonny is Sonny, I think his work kinda speaks for itself. Threw it on in a local coffee shop & realized I HAD to leave with it. Coffee at the house is even more enjoyable now.

The Venna project is 2025. I know it’s not vintage jazz, but man, does it compete! Just really beautiful music.

She said that she also had fun and that she's busy with family stuff for a bit, but would definitely like to again. Since last week I feel like we've barely spoken at work or over text. She is overall a quiet girl, but it seems like she is even more so now. I'm not sure what to think because I feel like we genuinely had a nice time hanging out but now I'm getting in my head about all of it.

We’re a team of about 10 people, and one of my coworkers, let’s call her Megan, is one of those people who always seems to “forget” her wallet or card.

The first time it happened, we were at lunch and she said she left her wallet at the office. No big deal, I paid for her food. She said she’d Venmo me later. She didn’t. I let it slide.

Then it started happening more often - Ubers to client meetings, group coffee runs, even groceries once when we stopped at Target on the way back from a shoot. Each time it was some excuse: “I’ll transfer you later,” “My card got blocked,” “Can you just spot me?”

After the 4th time, I stopped saying yes. I told her, nicely, that I couldn’t keep covering for her and that I was trying to stick to my own budget. She rolled her eyes and said I was being “cheap” and that I “make more than her anyway.”

That really pissed me off. I work hard, pay my own bills, and I’m still paying off student loans. I’m careful with money because I have to be. I told her straight up that it’s not about the amount, it’s about her assuming I’ll just pay every time.

Now she’s been acting weird in the office, making comments like “Oh, don’t ask her, she keeps track of every dollar.” Yeah, I do. Because I actually pay my own bills and my credit.

I’m just tired of people making you feel bad for having boundaries about money. I didn’t call her broke, I didn’t embarrass her, I just said no. Apparently that’s enough to make me “stingy.”",0,1762288756.0,EntitledBitch,25,0.49,False

A few years ago, I was deep in a Marvel binge during a rough stretch. Job sucking the life out of me, relationships fraying, the usual grind. Then Infinity War dropped, and Thanos wasn't just a villain; he was this tragic figure with a plan born from watching his home planet Titan crumble under overpopulation. Resources dried up, everyone suffered, and he thought, ""What if we balanced things out? Randomly wipe half the population, give the survivors room to thrive."" It's straight-up Malthusian economics. That old idea from the 1700s that population grows faster than resources, leading to famine and collapse. In the movies, he applies it universe-wide, collecting those Infinity Stones to make it happen. And the crazy part? He sees it as mercy. No remorse, just cold logic for the ""greater good.""

But here's where it gets real for me: Thanos's story forced me to confront how fragile abundance is. We scroll through feeds complaining about small stuff. Traffic, bad coffee, whatever. While ignoring the bigger picture. His ideology, twisted as it is, screams that nothing's guaranteed. Planets die, resources vanish, and if we're not careful, so do we. It's like a dark mirror to utilitarianism in philosophy: sacrifice some for the happiness of many. Think trolley problem. Pull the lever to save five, kill one. Thanos pulls it on a cosmic scale. Does it make him right? Hell no. It ignores innovation, human (or Titan) ingenuity, and the fact that killing half doesn't fix greed or waste. It just delays the crash. Plus, as Endgame shows, it leaves survivors broken and pissed.

So why gratitude? Because Thanos's world is a wake-up call. In our own mess of climate change, inequality, and endless scrolling, practicing thanks isn't fluffy. It's survival. It rewires you to notice the resources we do have: clean air today, a meal that didn't cost a war, connections that keep us from snapping our own fingers in frustration. Studies back this. Gratitude boosts resilience, cuts stress, even helps with long-term planning, kinda like what Thanos wished he'd focused on instead of mass murder.

This sub's about turning that awareness into action. Share a ""thanks"" that feels small but keeps the balance in your life. For me, right now? Grateful for storytellers like the MCU who make us think twice about the worlds we're building. Or snapping away.

What's one thing Thanos's snap made you rethink? Or just drop a quick thanks that's keeping you grounded. Let's build something better than balance through loss.",1,1762288683.0,ThanosTribe,0,1.0,False

She loves her home, and it shows. Her space is a reflection of her soul—comforting, beautiful, and filled with things that spark joy. These gifts are for her.

👉 [Click here to check the product on Amazon](https://starton.pages.dev//?q=christmas%20gifts%20for%20her)

*   **Smart Essential Oil Diffuser:** Go beyond a simple diffuser. Look for one with customizable light modes, a remote, and a large water reservoir for all-day scent. Pair it with a set of high-quality, therapeutic-grade essential oils like lavender, eucalyptus, or a festive winter blend.
*   **Weighted Blanket:** The hug she didn't know she needed. A 15-pound weighted blanket feels like a gentle, constant pressure that can reduce anxiety and improve sleep. It's the ultimate gift of comfort.
*   **Luxurious Loungewear Set:** Ditch the old sweats. Invest in a set made from Pima cotton, bamboo, or a cashmere blend. It’s a small luxury that makes everyday moments feel so much more special.
*   **A High-End Candle or Fireplace Diffuser:** Think beyond basic scents. Look for brands with complex, sophisticated fragrances like ""Leather & Tobacco"" or ""Sandalwood & Rose."" For a flame-free option, a smart fireplace diffuser that projects realistic flickering flames and mist is a stunning, modern choice.

## For the Trendsetter & Tech Enthusiast (The Gadget Guru)

She's always on the pulse of what's new and cool. She loves her devices, appreciates sleek design, and isn't afraid of a little innovation.

👉 [Click here to check the product on Amazon](https://starton.pages.dev//?q=christmas%20gifts%20for%20her)

*   **Portable Smart Projector:** Turn any wall into a movie night. A mini projector that connects to her phone or laptop is perfect for cozy nights in, backyard movie parties, or even a makeshift big screen for her favorite yoga tutorials.
*   **Digital Photo Frame:** This is a guaranteed heart-melter. Pre-load it with hundreds of your shared memories (family photos, vacation pics, candid shots). Many models allow family and friends to email new photos directly to the frame, so it's a gift that keeps on giving.
*   **Noise-Cancelling Headphones:** An escape pod for her ears. Whether she's commuting, working from a noisy home, or just trying to find some peace, a top-tier pair of noise-cancelling headphones (like Sony or Bose) is a game-changer.
*   **Smart Jewelry:** Functional and beautiful. A smart ring or bracelet can track her sleep, activity, and cycles in a way that's far more elegant than a standard fitness tracker. It’s tech she’ll actually want to wear.

## For the Sentimental Soul (The Keepsake Keeper)

She values stories, memories, and personal touches above all else. For her, the thought, effort, and meaning behind a gift are what truly matter.

👉 [Click here to check the product on Amazon](https://starton.pages.dev//?q=christmas%20gifts%20for%20her)

*   **Custom Star Map:** A beautiful print of what the night sky looked like on a significant date—the day you met, her birthday, your wedding day. It's a romantic and unique piece of art that's deeply personal.
*   **Experience Gifts, Not Things:** Give the gift of a memory. Book a weekend getaway, a class you can take together (pottery, cooking, cocktail making), or tickets to see her favorite band or play. The experience will last far longer than any physical object.
*   **A Handwritten Letter & Heirloom-Quality Jewelry Box:** Write a letter telling her what she means to you. Place it inside a beautiful, wooden or leather jewelry box that she can keep for a lifetime. The letter is the real gift; the box is its forever home.
*   **Personalized Jewelry:** Elevate this classic gift. Instead of just an initial, opt for a necklace with a handwritten message from you engraved on it, a bracelet with the coordinates of a special place, or a locket with photos inside.

👉 [Click here to check the product on Amazon](https://starton.pages.dev//?q=christmas%20gifts%20for%20her)

*   **A Luxury Bath Set:** Think bath bombs, body oils, and scrubs from a high-end, all-natural brand. Look for ingredients like Epsom salts, CBD, and essential oils to help her de-stress and unwind.
*   **Meditation or App Subscription:** A gift of peace. A premium subscription to an app like Calm, Headspace, or a yoga platform like Glo provides guided meditations, sleep stories, and wellness classes she can access anytime.
*   **Acupressure Mat and Pillow:** It looks like a bed of nails, but it feels amazing. Lying on an acupressure mat can help relieve muscle tension, improve circulation, and encourage deep relaxation. It's a perfect tool for her post-workout recovery or evening wind-down routine.
*   **Gourmet Tea or Coffee Collection:** If her morning ritual is sacred, upgrade it. Curate a selection of artisanal, single-origin coffees or a set of unique, organic herbal teas. Include a beautiful new mug to complete the experience.

1ooiio7,https://www.reddit.com/r/askdentists/comments/1ooiio7/whitening_products_from_the_us/,Whitening products from the US.,"I (35F) have been feeling self conscious about the colour of my teeth for some time. I don't drink coffee or cola, or wine. I don't smoke. I use whitening toothpaste, the kind that is available to buy in England but my teeth are still not as white as I would like.

I read about how the US is allowed to put a higher concentration of whitening ingredients in their toothpaste. So, I decided to order some Colgate Optic White from the US. I believe it had 5% hydrogen peroxide. It stated that it was suitable for every day use. In my head, I was thinking I was going to have that bright American smile that I'm so envious of.

I started brushing and after literally ten seconds, my gum started to burn. I brushed maybe three or four teeth before spitting it out and rinsing my mouth. My gum had turned white and I will admit, it scared me. My gum remained white for a couple of days and the outer layers kept peeling off, it felt like a chemical burn. Also my teeth were super sensitive.

I'm curious, is this normal? Like, is that what happens when Americans use it? How do you use that every day? Did I do something wrong? I can kind of see why we only let dentists use that high of a concentration of whitening product.",1,1762288499.0,askdentists,1,1.0,False

Hey Reddit fam,

Just joined today. I’m originally from Dehradun and have been working in Gurgaon for a while now. I work in the AI / deep tech space — one of those jobs that sounds exciting but keeps you glued to a screen most of the time.

I’m 30 now, from a Tier-1 college, doing well career-wise, but being away from home and living alone here sometimes feels… empty. Between work and deadlines, I barely get time to meet people, and honestly, haven’t built a circle here. No close friends, no relationship — just work and gym on repeat.

Sometimes I catch myself wondering — is this what success is supposed to feel like?

Would be great to connect with some like-minded folks around Delhi or Gurgaon — maybe for coffee, walks, or just conversations beyond work.

Don't get me wrong, I'm down to go out every now and then, but every single weekend is absolute insanity to me. I love staying inside and just relaxing, visiting coffee shops on the weekends where I don't feel rushed all the time, and maybe going on a hike or two. I just want that variety of things to do, AND also find friends who would be down to just chill out. I'm so tired of the hustle culture where people feel like they have to be on 24/7.  

Any recommendations for cities to live in? I've heard people recommend Seattle and Boston. I've also heard people recommend NYC just because of the sheer amount of things to do, along with the anonymity factor. I currently live in Chicago, and all people want to do is drink and eat, and I'm just over it at this point. The hustle culture also very much exists in Chicago, and I'm not the biggest fan. Maybe I'm just not a city person?

My family’s away, and my bank card got blocked a few days ago — which means all the money I have is stuck there. I’ve been trying to get through the week with what’s left in cash, which isn’t much.

This morning, on my way to school, I stopped by my usual café out of habit. (I can't start the day otherwise) When I realized I didn’t have enough to pay for my coffee, I just told the barista to cancel it. It was REALLY embarrassing, honestly.

Then, an old lady sitting nearby called out and told the barista she’d pay for it. I tried to refuse, but she smiled and said, “Just say a prayer for my late husband, and do the same for someone else someday.”

That small gesture completely changed my mood. What could’ve been a dull school day started with a reminder that kindness still exists — and that even a cup of coffee can carry warmth far beyond itself.",13,1762287973.0,goodnews,3,0.94,False

1ooi931,https://www.reddit.com/r/Gastritis/comments/1ooi931/update_2_years_later_gastritis_or_functional/,Update 2 years later - Gastritis or functional dyspepsia?,"Hey everyone. Been lurking here for 2 years since I initially got ""gastritis"". I'm at the point where I don't know if I actually have gastritis or if its something to do with brain-gut axis, or maybe its just something muscular. I'm posting this to see if anyone else has gone through something similar, or has any advice.

Symptoms started 2 years ago after stressful time, which are  
\- Epigastric tightness/squeezing feeling. Right in the center below my ribs. This is my number one symptom, and sometimes my only symptom, and it drives me insane. Feels like I did 1000 crunches.  
\- Nausea, feeling super full.  
\- Severe constipation.  
\- When I dont have nausea and feel super full, I feel like my stomach is completely empty no matter how much I eat. Constantly starving.  
\- Sometimes, VERY rarely, I will get a bit of burning but it stays in my stomach area and doesn't travel up esophagus.  
\- Ache that goes into my upper back and around my lower rib cage.

Tests I have had done / Medications tried

\- 2 complete abdominal ultrasounds, both normal.  
\- HIDA scan, normal.  
\- Endoscopy, normal. Doctor said functional dyspepsia.  
\- Stomach biopsy during endoscopy, no H. Pylori.  
\- Have tried Rabeprazole, Nexium, Pantoprazole, which gave me ACTUAL stomach pain and problems. Made me 1000x worse.  
\- Have tried sucralfate, gaviscon advanced, slippery elm, licorice root, cabbage juice, potato juice, aloe vera, nothing helped. But I never really had burning to begin with.  
\- I'm celiac, so I don't eat gluten.  
\- I don't smoke, drink alcohol, or coffee, ever.

I will be able to eat perfectly fine for months at a time, and then I will randomly and suddenly get this tightness in my upper abdomen and then it leads to weeks or months of discomfort and sometimes I'm able to eat normally, sometimes I'm not. One day I can eat a burger and fries with pickles and ketchup, cheese and chocolate and salami, and the next day I can hardly stomach water and it'll go on for weeks and weeks... Then I will wake up one day and be completely fine.  
  
Like for example, I've been in a flare up for the past month after I had to take a course of antibiotics for a week. Went out for dinner the other night and ate normal, lots of acidic stuff, was fine. Today I woke up with a bit of an ache in my upper stomach and had spinach for breakfast and kind of felt nauseous and achy all day. Then I came home and drank a pepsi and I feel better? I'm pretty sure if I had gastritis this wouldn't be the case, right?

Has anyone gone through something similar? I have been treating this like it's gastritis for the past 2 years because a doctor in ER told me thats what it was, but given the fact that no gastritis remedies actually help, I'm hesitant to believe it's even gastritis. I just got a new doctor who told me it could be diaphragm tightness causing essentially pinched nerve type feelings in my upper abdomen.",3,1762287870.0,Gastritis,7,1.0,False

I didn’t set out to do it, but I’ve been working on my chronic stress and trying to break my habit of using quick dopamine hits (scrolling, snacking, comfort food, etc.) to soothe myself.

What completely blindsided me was how *intense* my dopamine attachment to food actually is. If I hadn’t been paying attention to the stress piece, I don’t think I would’ve noticed how many of my eating habits are dopamine-driven, not hunger-driven — everything from “I need my coffee because it’s part of the routine” to feeling compelled to finish the last bites on my plate even when I’m full.

The wildest part has been noticing how my brain reacts when my **body** is done eating but food is still on the plate. The mental gymnastics, the fixation, the “just one more sip/bite,” even without physical hunger. I’ve had to literally sit through the frustration and not give in. It feels weirdly like withdrawal from a habit I didn’t realise was so ingrained.

To cope, I’ve been forcing myself to eat slowly, pausing between bites to actually check in with my body… which means it’s taking me an hour to eat a meal. It feels like starting from scratch and relearning something that should be simple. And honestly, by the end of the day, I’m emotionally and physically exhausted.

Has anyone else been through this part of intuitive eating? Does it get easier? I’d love to hear how long it took before the constant mental negotiating calmed down.",7,1762287721.0,intuitiveeating,4,0.77,False

About me, I’ve been heavily deconstructing the church for about a year now and told my spouse about my changing beliefs pretty early on. At first I thought things were going really well, she wanted to talk about the issues and we were committed to each other even if my religious views changed. 

For a month or so we talked about the things that hit me the most like racism, polygamy, or financial fraud and to her credit she would listen. But each conversation would turn into her defending the church and me telling her why it was wrong. So the conversations got less and less frequent and focused more on my changing actions. Again she was supportive about me taking off garments, skipping second hour, or drinking coffee and I supported her in her new calling and taking the kids to church. 

Now time has moved on and I have changed so much from where I was a year ago. But there is now this emotional divide growing between me and my spouse. We view the world differently and we don’t connect like we use to. I know counseling would help but with two young kids and both of us working full time it is hard on the schedule. 

For those in a successful mixed faith marriage, do you still talk about religion with your spouse or do you just ignore the subject? How do you have those conversations without either of you feeling defensive? ",11,1762287381.0,exmormon,8,1.0,False
