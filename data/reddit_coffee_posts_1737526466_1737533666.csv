* Drinking alcohol: when I do drink I don’t feel the same. It’s like I hardly get a buzz. I don’t drink more to get a buzz because I don’t want to overdo it. But the party is over. It kills the buzz of drinking alcohol. There is literary no payoff anymore. It slowly erases the addiction pathways in the brain by removing the ""reward"" of using dopamine releasing agents.  When I overdo it, in an attempt to catch a buzz I either get sleepy tired and go to bed and maybe get rewarded with an extra vicious hangover.
* Drinking coffee: My beloved coffee also don't feel the same.  Its missing that ""tingly feeling in the stumac, lets go and get this day started. "" I used to drink coffee all day, now I can hardly drink a cup or 2.  Overdo it I get 2 possible outcomes: or I get sleepy ( the opposite of the desired effect) or I get that jittery anxious feeling of to much noradrenaline.  II miss my coffee.
* 150 mg seems enough. I had a lot of side issues, when consulting my docter he prescribed me to double the dose. I trailed it but I don't get it.  The issues I had get magnified by 10 fold.
*  Hyperrealistic dreams settled down somewhat.  I still get them on occasion, but far less.
* Impossible to sleep in, I get jolted awake at 5-6 am.
* Hypervigilance to sound I had settled down ( thank god);  I do get tinnitus but it bothers me less then the issue I had with the hypervigilance ( the worlds audio volume seemed to be turned up all the way for some reason)
* Anxiety is weird feeling on Bupropion.  Like in a sense, Wellbutrin seems to put a damper on anxiety.  Like I get less anxious around people.  But on the other side I get this internal ""anxiety' .... its hard to describe.  Like a pit in the stomac, feeling of impending doom like something bad is going to happen any second now.   I once described it like so "" on Wellbutrin it feels like my basline anxiety is elevated so much, there isn't a lot of space for ""more anxiety"" as a result things don't seem to phase me as much ... because I'm already on edge all the time.
* Emotions are damped severely.  The good and the bad.  Bad news doesn't destabilize me as much anymore but its hard, actually impossible to get excited for good things as well.
* Doing sports, cardio, fitness: I still go out for running daily.  But I just seem to run as if its a job.  I miss that feeling of accomplishment.  Also that physical tingling at the back of your spine when you get ""in the zone"".  I'm sure its cause of the bupropion.  ( I was off the med for a few weeks last summer/fall and the ""reward"" of doing heavy exercise came back week 2,5)
* It still hard to wind down in the evening.  I remember my old days when I was medicated with Ritalin, you had 8 ish hours of productivity, ideally for work, and then you literary came down and could chill in the evening as the med effects wore out.  With this med its like im ON ON all the time.  it gets exhausting and is probably the most compelling reason for me to get off the med.

All said and done, I'm thankfull for what Buprorion did for me the last 2 years.  Nevertheless I don't plan on staying on for above said reasons.  But when I decide to get of, it will be controlled, tapered, and when this dark gloomy winter part is over ( its dead winter here and I get affected by SAD bigtime ).  So I think by the end of march imma ask my prescribing docter to figure out how to get off this med.  Maybe I get on this med again next winter who knows, because the last time I quit I had regrets and had to hop back on the Wellbutrin.  Also I think this med affects differently when depressed vs not depressed.  for example when I was depressed, the emotion sedation was welcome.  But now I think I'm not really depressed anymore, but its impossible to get excited about anything.  

TL:DR: I'm on Wellbutrin 150 mg for almost 2 years.  Some good effects, some negative.  All in all would recommend if you are depressed, depression with lethargy as main feature.  also works well for anxiety but in an weird way

(It’s a small van and gazebo is huge) I was at work so I couldn’t help but obviously I would have if wasn’t at work.

She yet again made a comment of ‘is she going to help you at these things?’ Hubby replied yes she is coming to more markets but she’s at work today and was poorly last time so couldn’t come. 

When this has been brought up before to his dad and I found out I messaged her saying  ‘I would be helping at big events this is just a small one and tbh I don’t need to lose money dropping work cos of it.’ She replied saying ‘I just wanted to give him moral support’ husband has already said he didn’t want anyone there at all.

Anyways husband told me what she said last night and I got upset. Because I told him next time she makes a comment like that to tell her I am upset that she makes these comments and I am going to help him what makes her think i wouldn’t help my husband when I can? 

Anyways husband messaged her told her to stop asking and it was upsetting me and she basically said that my response does not warrant what she said (like my feelings aren’t valid basically) and if I am that upset to message her. Which I’m absolutely not going to. If she messages me what the hell do I say? I hate confrontation but I want her to know that I feel like she thinks I’m not going to help when he is my husband ofcourse I’m going to help him!!!

I get a lot of strange look when I advise lads to switch over to decaf coffee.
Thought I'd share some of the benefits with you.

For men dealing with pelvic floor issues, whether that be pain or urinary frequency, even a daily cup of coffee can be a trigger. 

Caffeine can:
Increase muscle tension: This can worsen symptoms like urinary urgency, frequency, and even pain.

Aggravate anxiety: Anxiety can exacerbate pelvic floor dysfunction. Decaf can help reduce this stressor. 

Less bladder irritation.

Irritate the bowels: Caffeine can stimulate bowel movements, potentially worsening issues like diarrhea or urgency in those with sensitive bowels.

Try switching to decaf! You might notice the difference in taste.

1i7663u,https://www.reddit.com/r/CharlotteDobreYouTube/comments/1i7663u/aita_for_not_caring_about_an_abusive_ex_friend/,AITA for not caring about an abusive ex friend after she recieved a devastating diagnosis,"I (24 f) have an ex bestfriend (28 f) lets call her Trisha, who I fell out with quite some time ago after I realised she was being abusive to me for years. For context, she controlled everything I did, started fights and arguments when she didn't get her own way and made sure that I was never in a relationship so she could have all of my attention.
This girl made me feel like the most important person in the world, like I was wanted, worthy, loved, but this was all for her own self gratification. She bankrolled everything, wouldn't let me spend a penny on anything (this will become clear as to why as the story goes on), and helped me through the darkest time in my life.
As anyone would think, I thought she was the best friend ever. So selfless, so loving, but the day I realised she literally did this all to benefit herself, it broke me.
So, going back to the beginning, we became friends through a mutual group of people. As soon as we met, we clicked. We had so much in common and we both seemed to be very similar. We started spending everyday together, you never seen one without the other, we were just inseparable.  The first year of our friendship was amazing, travelled places together, had new experiences,  our boyfriends at the time really got a long. I couldn't ask for anything more. I had the perfect team. After that year my relationship with my boyfriend, lets call him Kyle, also 24, broke down, one day I came home, his bags were packed and he just left with no explanation or conversation. I was obviously devastated, but Trisha showed up, she was there.
As soon as my relationship was over, Trisha started to really bad mouth Kyle, which even at the time I found really strange because we actually never had any huge problems, he was a perfect gentleman and treated me like a queen. Whenever I got emotional over the breakup Trisha would've gotten really mad, often telling me to shut up and get over it. 
Me and Trisha's friendship then got alot tighter, I was always with her and her bf Marcus, 31. At the time I seen it as Trisha just being a good friend but this is when the abuse started.
Any time I wanted to be alone or didn't want to leave the house she started to get really bitchy and started to insult me. She would've told me I was pathetic and needed to grow up. My mental health started to deteriorate. When I was honest about how I felt, Trisha said to me ""it would be really pathetic of you to kill yourself you know that""
I never ever mentioned being suicidal or having suicidal thoughts, so when she said that, I was flabbergasted.
Anytime we went anywhere, whether it was for lunch/dinner, a spa day, a night away, she paid for everything and would not let me contribute. Any time I tried to, she returned the money back to me.
Anytime I went on dating apps or started to talk to men, she got really passive aggressive and picked on all of my insecurities saying things like ""you're not pretty enough for him"" knowing that would get me to stop replying. Eventually I just deleted all apps and stopped trying to make connections.
After the second year of our friendship, things just got worse. We were fighting almost every day, she argued with me when I had to go to work, saying things like ""you just work to get away from me"" ""you hate me"" ""if you really were my bestfriend, you would reduce your hours to be with me"". I did eventually get a new job with less hours because I couldn't take the arguments anymore.if I ever spent time with other friends or even my siblings without her, that turned into a 3 day argument about how I'm ashamed of being her friend and I don't want her to mix in with my other friends, when that wasn't the case. I seen her everyday, I could've went 6 months without seeing anyone else, including my own family. So when anyone reached out to me I would've shown up for them because I wanted to show them that I was still there for them. Trisha then started to isolate me from everyone. Making sure that anytime I had plans with someone else, she would've had an ""emergency""
I became a shell of myself. I didn't recognise who I was. It came to the point where I was then convinced I could not go anywhere or do anything without her.
As my mental state continued to spiral, Trisha suggested I moved in with her and Marcus for ""extra support"". I decided not to moved in with her but the 3 days a week I had off work, I did stay with them as a compromise. It came to a point that I felt like I couldn't do anything, go anywhere or talk to anyone without trishas permission. 
One day when Trisha and Marcus were out, I facetimed my older sister, Diana, 30. As soon as she answered the phone, she could tell something was wrong so she asked to meet me for coffee. When she asked this I said ""let me check if Trisha wants to come"" and Diana said ""no, I want you to come alone""
So I agreed and said I'd text trisha just to let her know I was out. Again Diana said ""no, just get dressed and meet me, she doesn't need to know your whereabouts 24/7""
Just for more context, we lost our mother when I was 18, but she was ill most of my life so Diana took on the mother roll and loved me as if I was her own child. Meaning she also very protective of me.
As soon as Diana seen me, she almost cried, I was a shell of myself. I was always the type of person who was very well presented when i left the house, no matter where i went, hair and nails done, nice clothes, makeup on. But when I went to meet Diana, I was wearing a tracksuit that was practically falling off of me because I had lost so much weight, no makeup, no nails and my hair scraped into a bun. I was not myself and it showed. 
While I was there, I was jumpy, anxious and very paranoid (which was out of character for me because I am a very bubbly and confident person) because Trisha wasn't with me.
Diana asked what exactly was going on, so I explained how my mental health was just getting worse but Trisha and Marcus were there for me and helping me, making sure I was never alone, about how they looked after me and wouldn't let me put my hand in my pocket. I started to go on about how I felt bad for not telling them where I was and Diana asked why. When I told her that trisha would argue with me, call me names, pick on my insecurities and make me feel as if she is the only one that cares about me, Diana lost it.
Diana broke it all down for me. Trisha was masking herself out as the supportive bestfriend, but she was actually controlling me and making sure my mental health stayed low so I would feel as if I needed her. 
I still had my own place, so Diana decided to drive me to Trishas (luckily she was still out) made me pack up whatever stuff I had there and took me home. Diana said she was going to stay with me for a few days because she knew I didn't want to be alone.
I was home about 3 hours and I get a call from Trish. I answered, but put her on speaker. I didn't even get to say hello and I was met with Trisha screaming down the phone ""WHERE THE FUCK ARE YOU""
I told her I had went home because I wanted to be alone. That's when the monster showed and she started to be very verbally abusive. She called me weak, ugly, fat, a freeloader, pathetic, ungrateful. Every insult she knew would get to me. She accused me of sleeping with Marcus and saying that was the real reason I left. She told me no one would ever care about me they way she did. But the one that really got me, ""after all of the money I spent on you and everything I've gotten you, this is how you treat me, you're mother would hate the person you've become""
I broke down because at that moment I realised exactly why she wouldn't let me spend a penny, she was controlling me. But mentioning my mom was where she really twisted the knife.
Diana took the phone and tore trisha a new a one. The mama bear in her came out and trisha knew not to fight back. Diana told trisha to leave me alone and to not contact me. She surprisingly listened and left me alone.
After getting away from her I decided to reach out to Kyle. It had been 4 years since we broke up, and I felt like the dust had settled enough for him to give me an explanation as to why he just moved out. He came over and had explained to me that Trisha had told him that we were having an affair and had shown him screenshots of conversations between us that were, let's just say, explicit via messenger. These conversations never happened. And were not in any way romabtically involved ever.So we were both confused. But I asked him why he just believed her. Kyle said trisha made it so convincing, especially since there were screenshots. After some deep diving and investigating we figured out that Trisha had made a fake account using my name and profile picture at the time and was sending the messages to herself. I deleted my Facebook and messenger about 3 years ago so you could imagine my surprise when an account for me actually did show up when kyle searched on his own account. She forgot to delete the account. Its still there with my profile picture at the time. It doesnt look like it has been used so it was opened and the account has no 1 friend. Trisha. So after a really good conversation,  me and Kyle are now friends and working on things slowly as I'm still very fragile.
It's now 9 months later, my mental health has massively improved as ive started therapy, I've gained weight, I've started taking care of myself again, I can honestly say I am on my way to being the best version of myself. I haven't spoke to trisha since that day, but a few days ago I seen a mutual friend of ours and she's told me that trisha is seriously ill. Although I wish her the best and hope she recovers I still don't want to reach out. Ill or not, she still mentally abused me for years, isolated me and had me become the lowest version of myself.

It’s great, she’s funny, she’s sweet, a lot of talk about meeting up. The problem is she hasn’t planned a date… it seems like every time I bring it up or try to suggest/plan it she pivots the conversation or has an excuse. I guess it’s important to note that we’re lesbians and she is more masc than I am.

It’s hard being the one who had to bear all the emotional brunt of it — spiralling into depression, going crazy, actually *dyeing your hair because looking at your previous self in selfies is a little too hard.*

So while songs like Coffee, Casual, and Picture You get my spirits up, it’s weird an upbeat number that’s supposed to be an anthem for rising above your exes like MKIK ends up being deflected back onto me in my mind. As if I wasn’t the one hurt in the situation.

So, graphic design, right ? Well, I don't have a pc (I don't really use that kind of stuff + I can't afford it) and they only have 1 pc here and the real graphic designer works on it all the time. 

Which means my boss gives me other stuff to do. Like, cutting stickers, 900, 1 by 1, individually, and yells at me if I take too long (3h).
Or welding ??? Like yesterday he told me to weld LEDs together. And today he's telling me to repaint something? I'm allergic to some paint and liquid glue fumes so I hope this isn't one of them. 

The thing is, after the 3 months, I have to write a 20 pages mini book about what I did during the 3 months then present it to my teachers, and if the things I did don't fit in what I was supposed to do (graphics stuff) I can't graduate and I have to redo the whole school year.

I want to be respectful. July of 2020. Ok. Please, I’m in front of you, on my knees, looking into your deep brown eyes. I don’t want to make any requests, but please it’s time to get back in touch. I want to casually make a plate of cheese and sausage for us to snack on as we watch soccer and you explain it to me, because I know almost everything about football now. I want to create moments that make you know you are cherished by me.



Please try trusting that I am being honest. You have not had good reasons to trust, and you have seen a lot of people die in the last decade. I have walked through many mental doors that have led me to understand that my adult kids are living with their adult partners now, except one, and she is old enough to be independent. But she has been faithful in paying bills when I cannot, which has been often lately with medical issues. 



I want to be casual with you. I don’t want this to be a big deal. I want it to be like this: I have surgery Friday (I do!) and it is in doctors park, and I do not have family to bring me there or home. A stranger will have to. But if I could be casual I could say….we could start here. Pick me up at 5:50 am and bring me home later? 



I miss you and never need to make the same mistakes twice because I do learn. Some mistakes needed to be made. Others we just painful. Do you think relationships should be good, with no pain, with never a betrayal or bad motive? We are all selfish people and if we ARE honest we all have a spectrum of things we do more or less purely. The only thing I am not going to stop doing is …. Learning how to be your friend, or more, if you will let me. Your submissive if you let me. I am a strong woman. That’s how I know I make a good submissive. 



Did you know I actually did write you a one hundred point plan? Since you are an 8 on the enneagram, someone said that was the way back into your heart.



Did you know I think of you and all the ways I want to just exist where you are? I think the perfect life for a man who gets stressed by change in his home, and the woman who is willing to be flexible, is two homes next door. Always someone there for the evening, or night, always a fresh cup of coffee waiting (we can take turns!)



Can you ever hear I love you enough? How about when you don’t deserve it? That is when I want to say it. Because no one deserves it, or else everyone deserves it, depending on your world view. If we are made in God’s image and have inherent value as human beings, we all deserve love as a birthright. 



Is someone else filling up the place I used to have with you? Are you making it be something you try to like, or would you like us to get back on the road with our books and poems, trucks and motorcycles, grills, messes, and maybe, gin and tonics.



If you’re casually dating, will you casually get back to dating me? I need your direction, my dear sir, to show me what would be the best thing…a call, a date invite….tell me? 



Can I be bold? It’s time to stop procrastinating and start following through on your promises from long ago. I will wait. I hold you to it. We made an agreement. Mine was to give you what the court wanted you to give me. Yours was never again to end our relationship without my consent and input in a conversation. You used up your rash endings. I don’t care how loud you can yell at the door, or whose fault it was. I am not leaving you again in that state of mind. You are your own worst enemy. 



Answer me please, will you please? So one day soon I can kiss your face?

It’s a great metaphor, but it doesn’t quite fit me. So, I came up with my own analogy I call Mug Theory.

Imagine I’m holding a server’s tray, like the kind used in a diner, and I’m going around picking up coffee mugs. The mugs represent anything that requires brainpower—like sensory processing, problem solving,  having a conversation, or even just trying to follow the plot of a show. Some things are small (a few mugs), while others are big (a lot of mugs).

At first, carrying a few mugs is easy. I can balance 10 or even 20 mugs with no problem. But as more are added, it gets harder to keep them steady. If I hit my limit—say, 50 mugs—the whole tray crashes down. That’s when I get overloaded and  experience a meltdown or shutdown.

Here’s what makes Mug Theory different from Spoon Theory: I can set down mugs if I recognize I'm holding them.  For example, if tight jeans are causing sensory issues and using up mugs, I can change into something more comfortable to free up space. Recognizing when my tray is getting full allows me to take steps to avoid a crash.

But sometimes, if I don’t pay attention to how many mugs I’m holding, or I keep pushing myself. I’ll be juggling 48 mugs, barely hanging on, even if I look fine on the outside, and then something small can happen—like the phone rings, the dog barks, or I stub my toe—and suddenly, everything comes crashing down.

This theory has helped me understand myself better and explain my needs to others. If someone who understands me, wants to talk to me, but I say, “I’m at 48 right now,” they know it means, “Give me a moment to set some mugs down and make space for you.”

Does this resonate with anyone else? I’d love to know if Mug Theory fits how your mind works or if it’s just me!

TL;DR: Instead of spoons, my energy is like mugs on a tray. I can carry a lot, but if I take on too much, the whole thing crashes. This metaphor helps explain how sensory and mental overload lead to meltdowns—and how I manage it by setting mugs down before reaching my limit.",0,1737531006.0,autism,2,0.5,False

 1. Guy has wood for sale, advertised for sale. Contact man for wood. Offer the price he wants for wood..Guy can't seem to figure out a way of getting the wood to me. Before you ask. I have offered to go pick up the wood and load it.. meaning all he has to do is take my money and watch ME load wood

 2. Go to a restaurant, maybe they are open maybe they are not. Maybe they moved location 2yrs ago... oddly their website has different ours or an entire other address

 3. Car for sale, contact seller. Offer to buy car. 
"" ive decided not to sell it"" fair enough
"" well it need x, x and O and i don't have the title""   HUH?
"" im actually looking for a trade""  i respond "" so you don't want this money I have im my hand?"" 

4. I've been standing in line in ACE with items in my hand for the teller to tell me.
""I gotta close the store, cuz I gotta go on break"" 

5. Barbershop sign says ""walk ins welcome"" go on a Tuesday at 10am it a graveyard. ""Sorry man, you gotta book on Booksly""  um ""ok, I have money and I'm standing in your empty shop""

6.  What kinda of Donut shop NEVER has powdered donuts?

 7. Ask for coffee, in a DINER. "" sorry sir, we are out and we would have to brew some""  its 1:45 and you serve breakfast

Not a top tier because it's pretty far out of my way and I don't think I've ever had their coffee while actually studying and doing homework. It's worth stopping by if you've never been, wonderful little place

  
McDonald's - Caramel iced coffee with multiple espresso shots is my go to when the going gets tough. Substantially less caffeine than Tim's but the flavor is much more palatable (even black/without cream). Not as cheap as it once was tho and, the past few times I've went, the espresso machine was ""broken.""

  
Nabob - Quite good but I prefer the Great Value. Not many negatives but for the price of 1kg I can get 2 or 3 of the Great Value. Solid choice when on sale, I wouldn't buy it at full price. This is the last one I enjoy taking black

  
Starbucks - I don't think I've ever just had a black coffee here. Frappuccinos are fine but wayyyyy too sweet for my liking. Price is absurd as well. Caffeine content per dollar is pathetic. They are drinkable beverages, not bad, but definitely not for me. This ignores the hour long line in the Murray Library every lunch break. Factoring that in may drop it to bottom tier. Not bad, but the negatives outweigh the positives for me personally

  
Maxwell House - I bought a can of this gutter trash just 2 days ago because it was cheap. Unfortunately, the price really reflects the quality. Currently mixing it with chocolate ice-cream to make it palatable, even then I'd rather have a Tim's or McD's coffee black. Nothing too awful to say, it just tastes overly bitter. I may have gotten a bad can. As I write this, the taste is growing on me but I will not be buying again. 

  
Folgers - My grandparents keep this hot garbage on hand and drink it every morning. If there were ever a coffee that we should give to prisoners, it's Folgers. Despite being almost 2 times the cost of Great Value, it tastes like a combination of dishwater, old socks and disappointment. It starts to taste acceptable when loaded with Baileys, white rum and vanilla ice-cream, or Amaretto. That said, I've only ever had it with booze after a few drinks so it might still taste like dishwater to a sober man.

  
Additional Coffees I didn't know how to label:

  
Flavored beans at the Bulk Barn (Incredible/Top Tier) - For \~$10/lb you can go to the Bulk Barn (probably other places too, no idea what the brand is) and get Salted Caramel, Dutch Chocolate and Chocolate Cake flavored coffee beans. The coffee itself is quite good and the flavor adds a nice compliment to an already wonderful cup of coffee. I'll drink it black for fun. Highly recommended if you enjoy coffee and want to switch things up a bit

  
Unknown Costa-Rican Coffee (Beyond Top Tier) - A 1lb bag of this was gifted to me when I told my dearest grandmother I needed to pick up a can of coffee on the way home to do some homework. It was smooth, flavorful and not bitter in the slightest. I drank it black because cream and sugar was making it worse. I have reason to believe this was a $50 bag of imported coffee. I can still taste it 2 years later. I'll have to ask if she remembers what it was next time I see her. 

  
Drop some recommendations (brands, places, etc). I like coffee and wouldn't mind updating this list with more gems. Alternatively, if someone can find a coffee that makes me hate life more than Folgers, I'd like to see that too",3,1737530141.0,usask,3,1.0,False

I need to vent and ask for help in a place where no one will find me, so Reddit seems best.

I feel like everything is going wrong and I’m too tired to fix any of it. I have a 10k hold on my student account at college which means I can’t sign up for classes this semester and it’s already been two weeks into the new semester. I want to talk to my therapist, but my treatment is through my school’s health care provider which I can’t access if I’m not an enrolled student. I tried to take out a parent plus federal loan with my father, but was denied due to my age. I tried applying for private loans but me and my parents do not meet the income requirements and have been denied. I’ve spent my days calling so many different departments at my school to see what can be done and the most I’ve been able to do is submit an appeal but there’s no guarantee that my school will give me the proper aid. I would work to pay off the balance, but it has been impossible to find a job and the only job I was able to get was a work study job, that I now can’t work because I’m no longer a student. 
I wish I had friends or family support here to get my mind off of things but I only have one friend here where I live. And I’ve been trying to meet people, (both friends and romantic partners) but it feels like I get to know someone and then when we meet in person or are about to, I just never hear from them again. I’m so tired of opening myself up and going on coffee hangouts just to be ghosted. Social interactions are very challenging for me, so I think that hasn’t been helping the exhaustion. 

 I had been trying so so hard to make a better life for myself. I was attending therapy regularly, taking my meds, staying sober for 2+ years, putting myself out there to make new connections, trying my best at school, but it just feels like nothing is getting better. I am so utterly exhausted and I don’t have any energy. I lay in bed all day, rarely get ready, and just spend the day sending emails to my school. I can’t focus on a book or tv show, I can’t write or do crafts; I’m just tired and there’s no relief.

What do you do when nothing is going right? How do you keep moving forward? Any tips or kind words are appreciated.

We want new plasma donors to be more informed and become safer donors. I have solid advice for new plasma donors who may be considering to try it out, earn extra money, and save lives:

* Plasma is 92% water and the rest is protein elements and electrolytes. With proper protein consumption and electrolyte drinks, your body is able to fully replenish the plasma you lost from donating within 24 to 48 hours. And that's a key reason there's a 48 hour wait in-between your two possible weekly donations.

* The plasma is separated from your blood and your red blood cells are returned to you in cycles.

* Per FDA regulations, you're only allowed to donate plasma twice in a 7 day period, with a 48 hour wait in-between those two times. Don't risk your health by hopping around to different plasma donation centers to circumvent these regulations, and you may get caught if you do.

1. Eat a meal high in protein 2-3 hours before donating, but your plasma protein levels depend on what you ate the day before.
2. Drink plenty of water and/or non-caffeinated juice before donating to stay hydrated. It's important to stay hydrated at least the day before, and the day of your donation.
3. Avoid caffeine such as in coffee or soda before donating or you may get nauseous and vomit or faint during your donation.
4. No alcohol 24 hours before, and for a little while after donating.
5. No exercising for at least 6 hours after donating as it can put too much stress on the vein.
6. Some people get away with smoking or vaping nicotine before and after donating, but it's recommended not to for 2 hours before and after. The nicotine can raise your heart's pulse rate.
7. If your pulse rate is 100 or above, you'll be able to do a vitals retake after a 15 minute wait. But if it's 100 or higher again you'll be deferred for the day. Taking sort of slower but deep breaths for 10 to 15 minutes before getting your vitals taken should help lower your pulse rate. If your pulse rate is an issue, listen to ""Pink Noise"" or ""Green Noise"" at a low volume before donating which may help reduce your pulse rate, along with its effect on lowering your blood pressure.
8. There is a risk of getting a blown vein if the worker is having a hard time finding your vein when they're sticking you with the needle or if you have small veins. You may get deferred until your vein heals if that happens. But it's ok, your body is able to regenerate your veins with a process called Angiogenesis.
9. There is a risk of blood clots, but when your blood is constantly moving through the machine it prevents that from happening.
10. You may be subject to drug screening. The drug screening tests for methamphetamines, cocaine, and heroin. Certain pharma prescription meds may show up as a false positive so you'll want to let the plasma center know what meds you're taking. Testing positive for these drugs can result in a permanent deferral from donating plasma.
11. A sample of your blood will be drawn periodically to test for certain sexually transmitted infections (STIs). A positive test will result in either a temporary or permanent deferral from donating plasma. If you've ever been diagnosed or received treatment for HIV/AIDS, Hepatitis B (HBV) or Hepatitis C (HCV) you will be permanently deferred from donating plasma.

Donating Plasma with Managed Diabetes

Individuals with well-controlled diabetes can contribute to plasma donation, but certain criteria need to be met:

Absence of Complications: This means no existing diabetic complications affecting your kidneys, heart, blood vessels, or eyes.

Insulin Independence: If you rely on insulin for diabetes management, a three-month waiting period is required after using needles for non-prescribed medications. Additionally, you must be free of symptoms or treatment needs related to blood sugar fluctuations (high or low) for the past three months.

1. Healthy Feet: Active foot ulcers requiring medical attention will disqualify you from donation.
2. Steady Balance: You shouldn't experience dizziness or lightheadedness upon standing.
3. Type 1 Consideration: For Type 1 diabetics, eating within two hours of donation is mandatory.



* Wait a few hours before taking the bandage wrap off of your arm after donating.
* It's recommended to use Vitamin E oil/Mineral oil on the needle site for the puncture area to heal better. A Q-tip can be used to apply it easier. I simply dip the Q-Tip in the bottle, but never dip the used cotton back into the bottle.
* Frequently donating over a prolonged period of time may lead to your body having decreased vitamin D levels.

* Red meats are particularly high in the protein vitamins and minerals found in plasma.
* Personally, I take a Now brand Vitamin D supplement that contains vitamin D3, Calcium, Magnesium, and Zinc. But I only take a half a dose, 1 gel capsule instead of 2, since I get these from eating meats and other foods as well. It's bad for your health if you take too much of these vitamins and minerals over time. I also take an Iron supplement once or twice a week. I also try to drink a protein shake before donating. Just to be safe.

We want new plasma donors to be more informed and become safer donors. I have solid advice for new plasma donors who may be considering to try it out, earn extra money, and save lives:

* Plasma is 92% water and the rest is protein elements and electrolytes. With proper protein consumption and electrolyte drinks, your body is able to fully replenish the plasma you lost from donating within 24 to 48 hours. And that's a key reason there's a 48 hour wait in-between your two possible weekly donations.

* The plasma is separated from your blood and your red blood cells are returned to you in cycles.

* Per FDA regulations, you're only allowed to donate plasma twice in a 7 day period, with a 48 hour wait in-between those two times. Don't risk your health by hopping around to different plasma donation centers to circumvent these regulations, and you may get caught if you do.

1. Eat a meal high in protein 2-3 hours before donating, but your plasma protein levels depend on what you ate the day before.
2. Drink plenty of water and/or non-caffeinated juice before donating to stay hydrated. It's important to stay hydrated at least the day before, and the day of your donation.
3. Avoid caffeine such as in coffee or soda before donating or you may get nauseous and vomit or faint during your donation.
4. No alcohol 24 hours before, and for a little while after donating.
5. No exercising for at least 6 hours after donating as it can put too much stress on the vein.
6. Some people get away with smoking or vaping nicotine before and after donating, but it's recommended not to for 2 hours before and after. The nicotine can raise your heart's pulse rate.
7. If your pulse rate is 100 or above, you'll be able to do a vitals retake after a 15 minute wait. But if it's 100 or higher again you'll be deferred for the day. Taking sort of slower but deep breaths for 10 to 15 minutes before getting your vitals taken should help lower your pulse rate. If your pulse rate is an issue, listen to ""Pink Noise"" or ""Green Noise"" at a low volume before donating which may help reduce your pulse rate, along with its effect on lowering your blood pressure.
8. There is a risk of getting a blown vein if the worker is having a hard time finding your vein when they're sticking you with the needle or if you have small veins. You may get deferred until your vein heals if that happens. But it's ok, your body is able to regenerate your veins with a process called Angiogenesis.
9. There is a risk of blood clots, but when your blood is constantly moving through the machine it prevents that from happening.
10. You may be subject to drug screening. The drug screening tests for methamphetamines, cocaine, and heroin. Certain pharma prescription meds may show up as a false positive so you'll want to let the plasma center know what meds you're taking. Testing positive for these drugs can result in a permanent deferral from donating plasma.
11. A sample of your blood will be drawn periodically to test for certain sexually transmitted infections (STIs). A positive test will result in either a temporary or permanent deferral from donating plasma. If you've ever been diagnosed or received treatment for HIV/AIDS, Hepatitis B (HBV) or Hepatitis C (HCV) you will be permanently deferred from donating plasma.

Donating Plasma with Managed Diabetes

Individuals with well-controlled diabetes can contribute to plasma donation, but certain criteria need to be met:

Absence of Complications: This means no existing diabetic complications affecting your kidneys, heart, blood vessels, or eyes.

Insulin Independence: If you rely on insulin for diabetes management, a three-month waiting period is required after using needles for non-prescribed medications. Additionally, you must be free of symptoms or treatment needs related to blood sugar fluctuations (high or low) for the past three months.

1. Healthy Feet: Active foot ulcers requiring medical attention will disqualify you from donation.
2. Steady Balance: You shouldn't experience dizziness or lightheadedness upon standing.
3. Type 1 Consideration: For Type 1 diabetics, eating within two hours of donation is mandatory.



* Wait a few hours before taking the bandage wrap off of your arm after donating.
* It's recommended to use Vitamin E oil/Mineral oil on the needle site for the puncture area to heal better. A Q-tip can be used to apply it easier. I simply dip the Q-Tip in the bottle, but never dip the used cotton back into the bottle.
* Frequently donating over a prolonged period of time may lead to your body having decreased vitamin D levels.

* Red meats are particularly high in the protein vitamins and minerals found in plasma.
* Personally, I take a Now brand Vitamin D supplement that contains vitamin D3, Calcium, Magnesium, and Zinc. But I only take a half a dose, 1 gel capsule instead of 2, since I get these from eating meats and other foods as well. It's bad for your health if you take too much of these vitamins and minerals over time. I also take an Iron supplement once or twice a week. I also try to drink a protein shake before donating. Just to be safe.

1i75abm,https://www.reddit.com/r/mrcreeps/comments/1i75abm/theres_something_out_there_underneath_the_ice_pt/,There's Something Out There Underneath the Ice [Pt. 2/3],"The wind ripped at my jacket, pulled at the length of rope connecting me to the plow. 

""Ed,"" I begged, ""we have to go!"" 

This time, he didn't say anything. He just stared at me, a blank look in his eyes. 

""Ed!"" I yelled. ""Nevermind, screw it!""

We didn't have time to stand around talking. Every second out there was another second closer to hypothermia. 

I pulled him away, back towards my Snow Cat. Edvard's feet stumbled against the ground, somewhat walking but mostly dragging. I forced him into the passenger seat of my plow and unhooked myself from the anchor rope. With the click of button, it retracted onto the reel. 

Climbing into the driver's seat, I closed the door and cranked the heat as high as it would go. I was exhausted. Felt as if I'd just finished a marathon. Really, we traveled less than a mile. 

I yanked the goggles off my head and wiped the sweat and tears away before taking hold of the control levers. Then, we started for my cabin. Along the way, I radioed the others to let them know what happened. 

""Is he alright?"" Mia asked. 

""What the hell was he doing?"" said Donovan. 

""I've got him, safe and sound. That's all that matters right now,"" I replied. ""I'll get back to you once were at the cabin."" Then, I turned off the radio to focus on the drive. 

The storm was picking up, smearing the landscape into a swirl of white. Antarctica could be a beautiful place if you ignored the cold. Glittering stretches of open terrain. An endless sky that sometimes was blue as the ocean or red as a fire. Pink in the early morning, maybe a shade of purple late at night with soft tinges of vibrant green. But most of the time, especially in the winter months, it was black. Dark as the bottom of the sea. 

In that moment, I felt a sense of nostalgia for my first week at the research station. Long before I had become inured to the boredom and treacherous nature of the artic. 

In a strange way, perhaps even in a nonsensical, inexplicable way, I had felt like an astronaut. As if I were exploring what few had seen before. A lone lifeform adrift in the barren void of space. Special. Not because of who I was or what I could do, but because of what I was in relation to my environment. An odd entity that existed somewhere it wasn't meant to be. A flower in the desert, a heartbeat amongst the dead. 

That feeling quickly abandoned me during my second or third week. My sense of awe had been combatted by the long hours of nothing, trapped inside my cabin for hours on end. 

My distaste for the artic, for the cold and the snow, came with relative ease. 

""Where are we?"" Edvard asked. 

""We''re heading back to my cabin."" 

He reached up and pulled the fur-lined hood from his head, peeled the goggles from his eyes, tugged the balaclava down around his neck. His cheeks were red; his lips chapped. 

Edvard was a handsome man in his early thirties. Tan skin that had taken a softer tone from his time in the north, time spent away from the sunlight. A hard jawline with cheeks stippled by the makings of a beard. Thick, tangled hair sat on his head. Brown as oakwood. Drenched from sweat and snow into a darker shade than usual. 

The thing I'd noticed about Edvard when we first met were his eyes. Glacial blue and intense. The kind that were easy to get lost in if you weren't careful. Always watching, observing, assessing every minute detail. 

We sometimes joked that he was a reptile because we never saw him blink. And at first, it might seem disquieting, off-putting to the average person, but you quickly adjusted to it, to him, because beneath that severity, beneath that intense gaze was a profound warmth. Kindness. Selflessness. Intellect that went beyond amassed knowledge to a deep, unfathomable grasp of empathy. Of emotions and compassion. 

If it weren't already apparent, I admired Edvard. Found his gentleness, his genuine nature, commendable. Especially during a period of time when society's norms did not always condone such behaviors. 

Furtively, though, I was also envious of him. Jealous to a caustic degree. He had somehow figured out the secret to happiness. Had discovered the path to not only fulfillment, but a level of content that I would never achieve no matter how great my aspirations or achievements. 

To put it simply, I woke up every morning intent on working to earn my paycheck like everybody else. Edvard, though, awoke with the sole purpose of enlightening himself. No grandiose expectations. No incessant grind in search of monetary success. He lived and breathed for the sole purpose of experience. To do the best he could, and at the end of the day, properly acknowledge his efforts regardless of the results. 

Maybe that's why I had been so surprised to hear Edvard say: ""You should've left me out there."" 

""What?"" 

""You should've left me on the ice, out in the storm."" 

""You would've froze. I'm surprised you're still alive, Ed. You'll be lucky if you don't contract anything serious."" 

""I'm already sick."" 

""Probably because you were standing in the middle of a snowstorm! What in God's name were you thinking?"" 

Edvard turned towards me then. That faraway look in his eyes. ""There was someone out there."" 

""You're imagining things. There's no one out here but us."" 

""They're out there!"" 

""No one is out there. The company would've told us if they were bringing anyone in. And as far as I'm aware, the next research station is almost thirty miles away."" 

The cold was making me irritable. I wanted nothing more than to get back, take a warm bath, and drink some hot chocolate. Maybe play another game of chess with Donovan if he was willing to lose again. Or listen to music while watching the snowfall. I was an avid fan of Low Roar. Their music was oddly redolent of the artic. Morbidly beautiful. Haunting and surreal. 

I exhaled my grievances. ""It's just us, Ed."" 

He didn't seem convinced, but he said nothing more of the matter and leaned back in his seat, closing his eyes. ""I've got a headache."" 

""We'll get you some aspirin when we get back."" 

Gently, he massaged his temples as if to work the kinks from his brain. ""Thank you, Emily."" 

I hated when people called me by the wrong name, but Edvard wasn't in a state of mind to be scolded or reprimanded. 

""I'll keep you overnight to monitor your status,"" I said, ""and assuming you haven't developed hypothermia by then, I'll take you back home in the morning. Maybe Donovan will help me retrieve your Snow Cat at some point."" 

Edvard showed no interest in the current subject, and instead, said: ""I had a dream about you last night."" 

I scoffed. ""For both our sakes, don't tell Mia that."" 

""You were dancing at the center of the sun,"" Edvard continued. ""I think you were laughing. Even as the inferno swallowed you whole, you looked as if you were laughing."" 

I blinked. The silence between us swelled, combated only by the sound of the wind as it thrashed the metal exterior of the Snow Cat. 

""Maybe we should just let this be a time of silent reflection,"" I suggested. ""Take a moment to really think before we speak."" 

Surprisingly, this made Edvard laugh. A subtle gradual thing that soon filled the inner cabin of the Snow Cat. 

""If nothing else,"" he said, ""you're funnier than...than me."" 

I shook my head in disbelief. ""Thanks. Glad to see the cabin fever hasn't completely turned you mad."" 

Again, he croaked with laughter. A small, humored chuckle that sat in his throat like the call of a toad. 

""Humor is a good trait to possess,"" he told me. ""From what I have surmised, the general population appreciates good humor over almost anything else. They find it charismatic, endearing."" 

The cold had corroded his brain, left him in a detached state trying to further distance hiself from the trauma he'd endured. From the realization that he had faced the distinct possibility of death not twenty minutes prior. 

I wasn't going to burst that bubble, wasn't going to ruin his method of coping. 

Simply, I told him: ""Ed, I think that is a very astute conclusion."" 

This seemed to invoke some semblance of joy within him. A hint of pride for his meager assessment. And we were able to finish the remainder of our drive in peace. 

When we finally reached my cabin, I killed the Snow Cat's engine and climbed out from the cab. I lagged behind, allowing Edvard to pass me and enter the cabin first, convinced that he might try to run away if I weren't there to block him. 

But now that I was with him, that he was no longer alone with his thoughts, he seemed cooperative, compliant. More so than usual. 

Edvard was the unofficial leader of our little group. The spokesman for the skeleton crew. He ordered our supplies and reported to the company whenever they reached out, which wasn't often since most back at headquarters were away for the holiday. 

He didn't have any real authority, not like our actual superiors. He couldn't orders us about or terminate our positions or anything like that. But he'd been taking on some of the responsibilities the rest of us wished to avoid, and for that, we were all grateful. Maybe that had been affecting him. Maybe that's what had driven him out into the storm. The surmounted pressure and additional stress coupled with the inevitable madness provoked by isolation, by a lack of sunlight and exercise. 

I would've asked him about it, not that he necessarily would've admitted this, but I was bone-cold and exhausted. I didn't want to have a serious conversation then. Didn't want to deal with the burden. I just wanted to call it a night and relax. Handle it in the morning after I had some rest. Or about as close to rest as I could get. 

So, instead of talking, I ran a hot shower and let Edvard wash up first. I threw his clothes into laundry and started cooking tomato soup and grilled cheese sandwiches for dinner. 

Then, I radioed the others to give them an update. They had more questions than I had answers. I told them what little I knew and promised to give any updates if I found out more. An empty promise. 

Edvard was an adult. Fully capable of making his own choices. If he wanted to talk, I was more than willing to listen. But in my mind, the last thing I would have wanted at a time like this was someone else poking and prodding, dissecting my every thought and decision as if I were no more than a hapless child. 

That didn't mean I wasn't going to keep an eye on him. He was in my cabin, and therefore, under my supervision. Until I felt comfortable enough with his current state of well-being, I wasn't going to let him leave. 

Some people might think I was being completely ignorant or stupid, and maybe I was to some degree, but I would tell those people you weren't there. You don't know Edvard like I do. Not that we're exactly close, but we've all been working together for the better part of a year. Forced to spend almost every day within close proximity. 

It's not like we just clocked out at the end of the workday. Not like we could go to the bar on the weekends. If we wanted to socialize, it was with each other. If we wanted to play games or share a drink or have a movie night, there were only so many people we could do that with. Friendship or not, we were victims of circumstance. Animals sharing the same exhibit. 

You either learned to appreciate the company of the other twenty-five individuals around you, or you spent all your time locked inside your cabin slowly losing your mind. 

At this point, I'd had more conversations with Edvard or Donovan or Mia or any of the other twenty-three analysts than I'd had with my actual friends, possibly even certain members of my family. We were more than familiar with each other. 

Edvard was whimsical, but he wasn't an idiot. He wasn't crazy or insane or anything like that. He was fully self-aware, more cognizant than ninety percent of the people I'd encountered throughout my life. And from what I could tell, he didn't seem depressed. Wasn't displaying negative behavior to lead me to suspect that he had gone out into the storm with the intention of dying. 

Still, despite my rationality, he had gone out there for a reason. There was an intention. 

""I don't know,"" he had admitted between bites of his grilled cheese. About half of his tomato soup still remained, wafting little streams of mist into the air. ""I just...I really thought someone was out there. I would've put all my money on it. Every last dollar."" 

""And your first instinct was to go after them?"" I said. 

""I didn't want them to freeze."" He took another bite and chewed. ""I mean, didn't you do the same thing for me?"" 

""That's different. I was almost certain you were out there. The transmitter even said so."" 

""Still. There was a slight chance that I wasn't."" 

""I guess."" 

""But you went out there anyway."" 

""Alright, Ed, you've convinced me. Next time I notice you're miles from your cabin in the middle of a snowstorm, I'll just leave you be."" 

He laughed. ""That's not what I'm getting at."" 

""What are you getting at then?"" 

He contemplated this as he chewed, going back and forth between his sandwich and soup until neither remained. 

""Human nature is self-destructive at its core,"" he finally said. ""They're...we're...it's practically intrinsic to do anything in our power to help another member of the species without any regard for our own well-being."" 

I looked at him for a long time without saying anything. Bemused by his statement, stupefied even. Then, when I did speak, I told him: ""You have severely misinterpreted human nature if that's what you believe."" 

""Oh?"" He seemed disappointed. ""Is that so? Enlighten me then."" 

""Gladly."" I set my sandwich on the plate and leaned back in my seat. ""Have I ever told you about my father?"" 

He wracked his brain for a memory that I already knew didn't exist. 

""He was a good person,"" I explained. ""Served in the army for about seven and a half years. Honorably discharged due to mental concerns. Spent the rest of his life working minimum wage at a steel mill during the week. Nighttime security gigs at a bar downtown on the weekends. 

""One day,"" I told him, ""he just dies. Heart failure. No warnings really. He was overweight and had been a smoker in his younger days, but other than that, fit as a fiddle."" 

""Okay?"" 

""Well, we didn't have much money growing up. We were just above the poverty line. So, as you might imagine, we struggled to pay the funeral charges. It's expensive to properly dispose of a body. Whether you cremate or bury."" 

""What did you do?"" 

""We went to the VA, but they weren't going to cover it. Started a fundraiser, online and in-person. That helped. People donated, more than I expected, but at the end of the day, my family was stuck with a substantial bill. One that we are still paying, and it's been almost three years."" 

Edvard frowned. ""I'm not fully grasping--"" 

""The point is, there are good people and bad people. Two sides to every coin. But self-destructive, in a selfess sacrificial way, I don't think so."" I pushed my plate away. My appetite had abandoned me. ""There's a reason humanity still exists while other species go extinct. We're hard-wired for survival. Our sense of self-preservation is greater than our innate emotional response to the condition of others."" 

""You think people should have donated more? Until they had nothing left to give?"" 

""Not at all. I don't hold a grudge, I don't have any grievances. Hell, I'd probably do the same thing they did in given circumstances. But if our empathy is as great as you want to believe, we wouldn't have struggled in the least to pay for my father's funeral. There wouldn't be homelessness or poverty or starving nations. Society wouldn't completely break at the first sight of a pandemic. But these things do exist, they happen because we're self-centered...most of us, at least. We worry about number one and hope number two or three or four never come knocking on our door in search of help."" 

""Then why did you come out looking for...me?"" 

""I don't know. I just couldn't stand the idea of a coworker--a friend, being out there. Left alone like that."" 

""Maybe you don't give the human race enough credit."" 

""Or maybe I'm just an idiot lacking the necessity for self-preservation."" 

""I'mnot entirely convinced."" He smiled then. A gentle pull at the corner of his lips. ""I possess enough knowledge, sufficient memories and experience to know that humanity can be full of destruction and hostility, but there's still compassion out there. Enough altruism to deem worthwhile. It's a species worth protecting, one worth being apart of. Don't you think?"" 

I scoffed. The conversation was absurd, but the question itself was beyond ridiculous. Not exactly what I expected from that night. 

It was commonplace to discuss politics or literature. Pop culture and movies. Weekend plans or outings with the family. The sanctity of humanity, the value of society, that just wasn't a popular topic. 

""I think it's getting late,"" I said. ""I think we're too tired to be discussing ethical dilemmas or analyzing human nature."" 

He put his hands up in surrender. ""Alright, fine. But let me ask you one last thing, and I'll leave it alone: what makes a person? What standards qualify someone as a human being?"" 

""Easy, they know when to drop a conversation."" I retrieved my dishes and carried them over to the sink. ""Looks like you've still got some learning to do."" 

""I guess so."" 

We cleaned up after dinner. I washed and he dried. Then, while Edvard looked through my collection of books and board games, I took a shower. The water was warm and thawed the cold from my body, melted away the stress that had pulled my muscles taut. Helped clear the fuzz from my mind. 

When I stepped out, I found Edvard waiting for me in the doorway of the bathroom. I don't know how long he'd been there, but the moment caught us both by surprise. 

""What the hell are you doing?"" I remarked. 

He lifted his hand, holding up a book for me to see, a casual expression across his face as if I hadn't caught him watching me shower. It might sound stupid, but his nonchalance made any internal alarms go silent. As if it were a misunderstanding. Bad timing kind of scenario. 

""Can I borrow this?"" he asked, holding out my father's copy of Thomas Ligotti's 'The Conspiracy Against the Human Race' on display. 

""Uh...sure."" I waited a moment, towel wrapped around my body, before asking: ""You mind getting out so I can change?"" 

He frowned. A reddish hue flooded his cheeks. ""Right, sorry. Yeah. Just one of those days."" He backed out of the bathroom. ""Again, sorry. Completely inappropriate of me."" 

Once the door was closed, I swapped my towel for a pair of checkered pajama bottoms and a plain gray sweatshirt. Cotton polymer that was softer than any pillow or cloud in existence. 

The small things in life are sometimes the most fruitful. Little pleasures to make the rest no more than a distant memory. That greasy fast food takeout after a long day at work. That cup of coco after spending the morning shoveling your driveway. A tub of cookie dough ice cream after getting dumped by the only girl you ever loved. Brief moments of reprieve from reality. Distractions to keep your sanity intact. Comfort in the simplest form. 

When I came out of the bathroom, I found Edvard sitting on the couch reading my father's book. He glanced at me and offered a soft smile. A strange way to clear the air, but for the life of me, I couldn't think of a better alternative. I'm sure one existed, but at the time, I was still in an awkward mindset of whether I should be upset, pissed, ashamed, or mortified. 

""I'm going to put the kettle on,"" I said. ""You want a cup of tea?"" 

""Tea?"" 

""Crushed leaves and hot water."" 

He chuckled. ""I know what tea is..."" He pondered a moment. ""Is it any good?"" 

""You've never had tea before?"" 

""No, yeah, I have, but what kind?"" 

""I've got Sleepytime Vanilla, peppermint, and Throat Coat."" I checked the cabinet. ""I've also got homebrew coffee and hot chocolate with marshmallows."" 

The variety in choice seemed to confuse him. ""Uh..."" 

""Is that an answer?"" 

Again, that warm, crooked smile. ""You know better than me. I'll let you decide."" 

I filled the kettle with water and set it on the burner. Then, I went to my rig to perform the nightly check in. 

Mia was getting ready for bed. It seemed a little early, but lately, she'd been laying in bed for hours on end, unable to fall asleep. Her theory was that if she lay down around eight or nine at night, she might be asleep by ten or eleven. 

Donovan was in the middle of a Studio Ghibli marathon. He'd been watching 'Nausicaa of the Valley of the Wind' when I radioed in. For those that don't know Donovan, the last thing you wanted to do was interrupt him during a movie. 

So, I skipped the niceties and any attempt at conversation. Told them I would check back in the morning. I wanted to mention Edvard, talk about the way he was acting, the things he'd been saying, but like with Donovan and Oscar, it was hard to broach the matter with him in the same room, listening to our conversation. 

After recording temperatures, weather conditions, and seismic activity, I muted my systems and grabbed the kettle from the stove. I poured a cup of Sleeptyime Vanilla for myself and Throat Coat for Edvard. 

When I came into the living room, Edvard dog-eared his current page and looked up at me. ""Can I ask you something?"" 

""Depends,"" I said, ""what's it about?"" 

""You're father."" 

""You can ask, but I can't promise to give an answer."" 

""Fair enough, all things considered."" 

I set the cup of Throat Coat on the coffee table in front of him and took a seat in my desk chair at the other end of the room. 

""Alright, shoot,"" I said. 

""Shoot?"" 

""Figure of speech, Ed. Never knew you to be so literal."" 

He tittered and shrugged helplessly. ""Like I said, weird day. Feeling a bit off. Like I've just awoken from a dream."" 

""I know that feeling. Sort of like deja vu."" 

His brow knitted with uncertainty. ""I guess so, yeah."" He set the book on the cushion beside him and took his mug by the handle, lifting it to his lips. 

""Wiat a minute, that's--"" 

But he was already gulping it down. Wisps of steam masked his face as he emptied the mug. Then, he set it back on the coffee table and exhaled. 

""Nevermind,"" I muttered. ""Guess you don't really need tastebuds anyway."" 

I blew on my coco before taking a drink. I don't know how he didn't react because I practically scorched the interior of my mouth with just one sip. 

""Anyways,"" I said, stifling a yelp, ""you had a question about my father?"" 

""Right. I was going to ask if you missed him."" 

""Of course. It'd be a crime not to."" 

""Would it?"" 

""Another figure of speech, Ed. Seriously, whats going on with you?"" 

""No, no. I understand. I just mean, what if I didn't miss my own father."" 

""I wasn't aware your father had passed."" 

He pursed his lips, forming a firm line across his mouth. ""Both of my parents...actually
They...uh...they died in a car accident."" 

I couldn't help the shocked expression on my face. Edvard was so vibrant and optimistic. Hard to imagine he had ever experienced any serious trauma. But that's just the way some people coped. Turn to the positive and leave the past behind. Let your shadow follow at your heels instead of plaguing your mind. 

""I don't really feel much of anything about their deaths,"" he confessed. ""Shouldn't I, though?"" 

""Well, when did it happen?"" 

""I was a child. They were coming back from a date, and I was stuck at home with the babysitter. A young neighbor girl from across the hall. 

""I remember hearing the police sirens from down the road,"" he recalled. ""When I looked out the window, I could see the lights flashing in the distance. I felt...helpless. Trapped. I don't know how I knew it was them, I just did. But now, I don't feel anything. It's like I'm watching that moment on TV. Like it was someone else's life."" 

""I'm not a psychologist, but it sounds like you're still in shock."" 

He shook his head. ""No. I remember being in shock at the time. I don't know what this is."" 

""You can be in shock more than once. Some realities take years to set in. It's not like you experience it once and it's done. These things come in waves. 

""Some days..."" I paused, wondering if this was something I wanted to share with him. Something I wanted to share with anybody. ""Some days, I get up and get out of bed like anybody else. I feel fine, normal. Just go through the motions and that's that. But then there are days when I might hear a certain song or watch a certain movie or read a certain book, and it feels like I've lost my father for the first time again. Like I'm back in that moment when my brother called to tell me..."" 

Edvard stared at me, wide-eyed and completely enthralled. As if we were sharing ghost stories around the campfire. 

""It comes and goes,"" I finished. ""You don't ever stop grieving, you just learn to carry that weight. To manage it so that it doesn't crush you."" 

""What if you could forget it?"" he asked. ""Lose those memories. Would you?"" 

That was a tough question. Well, I suppose the question itself wasn't harder than any other question, but the answer was complicated. Difficult to put into words, to explain outside of just feeling it. 

""I'm not sure, honestly,"" I said. ""I mean, that's why people drink or smoke or whatever. Because they want to distract themselves, want to forget their pain. But I don't think you can. Not without causing more issues for yourself."" 

""You'll have to expound on that a little more for me."" 

""Life isn't a steak,"" I explained. ""You can't just cut away the fatty bits. I wish you could, and I suppose some people really do try, but in my experience, it just doesn't work like that. It's a package deal. You get the good with the bad. Trying to eliminate that, to cut out the parts you don't like, it'll hurt you as a person. It would completely erase any tolerance for pain and leave you with unrealistic expectations. You wouldn't really be yourself if you removed the memories you didn't want."" 

""To suffer is a better alternative?"" 

""To suffer is to be human. Just like with love and hate, joy and anger. We have to experience all those emotions at some point or another, otherwise we become blind to reality."" 

He seemed enthralled by this notion. Completely absorbed by the topic at hand. 

""But I get where you're coming from,"" I admitted. ""I've been there. So overwhelmed by your grief that you almost finding yourself wishing you don't exist. That you weren't real because then, you wouldn't have to feel anything at all. All that heartbreak, all that confusion and madness just fades away if you aren't there to indulge it. It becomes illusory."" 

Edvard leaned back, resting his chin in between his forefinger and thumb. ""Interesting..."" 

""It's been a long day,"" I told him. ""Let's just call it an early night. Try to get some sleep and clear our heads."" 

Silently, he nodded. 

I retrieved an extra set of pillows and blankets from the closet. I offered to sleep on the couch, but Edvard refused. He'd already taken the better half of my day with his antics. He didn't want to put me out any further by taking my bed. I was too tired to argue. 

I turned out the lights and climbed beneath the covers. It took me a while to fall asleep. Partially because my brain wouldn't shut down. That's been a problem since childhood. Even when my body was on the brink of collapse, my mind stayed active. 

But also, I wanted to wait until Edvard had fallen asleep. Not that he would have done anything, not that I didn't feel safe around him, but there was just this feeling I had. I didn't know what it was, but I couldn't allow myself to go to bed until I knew he was asleep first. 

That eventually came when I heard his soft snores sneaking through the dark. Then, and only then, did I close my eyes and relax. 

It probably comes as no surprise that I dreamt of my father that night. I was outside, caught in the middle of an icestorm. There was nothing around me for miles. Empty fields laden with snow. Endless hills rolling in the distance like the gentle peeks of ebbing ocean waves. The sky was pitch-black. No sun, no moon, no stars. Just a blank void of darkness. 

I could hear my father calling out to me. It'd been so long since I heard his voice, but even then, I could tell that it wasn't him. It was a guttural sound. Sharp and grating, but inexplicably, I was convinced that it was my father. The way that dream logic makes no rational sense, but you accept it as fact anyways. 

I followed the voice through the storm until it came from directly beneath me. Then, I fell to my knees and started digging. I didn't have a shovel or gloves or any equipment. So, I dug with my bare hands. 

My fingers went from red to pale blue. My muscles ached and burned. But I kept digging, pushing away mound after mound of snow. I found his corpse buried beneath a thick wall of ice. Arms raised and hands poised as if trying to claw his way out. 

I blinked, and my father was replaced by Edvard. I blinked again, and this time, it was Donovan. Short black hair, and a thin mustache above his upper lip. Skin the color of milk. Then, it was Mia. Long, auburn-red hair and soft green eyes. Mouth partially open as if frozen mid-scream. 

Lifting my fist, I pounded on the ice, cracking the first layer with relative ease but struggling to break through anything deeper than that. 

The wind picked up. Snow pelted me at an incredible speed, dragging across my flesh like the edge of a razor blade. 

When I blinked again, Mia was gone. Instead, it was me beneath the ice. A reflection interspersed by a spiderweb of cracks. 

I awoke with a lump in my throat, wanting to scream but unable. My lips were locked together. I was paralyzed. 

At my bedside, Edvard loomed over me. He had a blank gaze in his eyes, looking without seeing. A lantern absent of light. 

""I am here,"" he said.",1,1737528688.0,mrcreeps,0,1.0,False
1i759zg,https://www.reddit.com/r/scaryjujuarmy/comments/1i759zg/theres_something_out_there_underneath_the_ice_pt/,There's Something Out There Underneath the Ice [Pt. 2/3],"The wind ripped at my jacket, pulled at the length of rope connecting me to the plow. 

""Ed,"" I begged, ""we have to go!"" 

This time, he didn't say anything. He just stared at me, a blank look in his eyes. 

""Ed!"" I yelled. ""Nevermind, screw it!""

We didn't have time to stand around talking. Every second out there was another second closer to hypothermia. 

I pulled him away, back towards my Snow Cat. Edvard's feet stumbled against the ground, somewhat walking but mostly dragging. I forced him into the passenger seat of my plow and unhooked myself from the anchor rope. With the click of button, it retracted onto the reel. 

Climbing into the driver's seat, I closed the door and cranked the heat as high as it would go. I was exhausted. Felt as if I'd just finished a marathon. Really, we traveled less than a mile. 

I yanked the goggles off my head and wiped the sweat and tears away before taking hold of the control levers. Then, we started for my cabin. Along the way, I radioed the others to let them know what happened. 

""Is he alright?"" Mia asked. 

""What the hell was he doing?"" said Donovan. 

""I've got him, safe and sound. That's all that matters right now,"" I replied. ""I'll get back to you once were at the cabin."" Then, I turned off the radio to focus on the drive. 

The storm was picking up, smearing the landscape into a swirl of white. Antarctica could be a beautiful place if you ignored the cold. Glittering stretches of open terrain. An endless sky that sometimes was blue as the ocean or red as a fire. Pink in the early morning, maybe a shade of purple late at night with soft tinges of vibrant green. But most of the time, especially in the winter months, it was black. Dark as the bottom of the sea. 

In that moment, I felt a sense of nostalgia for my first week at the research station. Long before I had become inured to the boredom and treacherous nature of the artic. 

In a strange way, perhaps even in a nonsensical, inexplicable way, I had felt like an astronaut. As if I were exploring what few had seen before. A lone lifeform adrift in the barren void of space. Special. Not because of who I was or what I could do, but because of what I was in relation to my environment. An odd entity that existed somewhere it wasn't meant to be. A flower in the desert, a heartbeat amongst the dead. 

That feeling quickly abandoned me during my second or third week. My sense of awe had been combatted by the long hours of nothing, trapped inside my cabin for hours on end. 

My distaste for the artic, for the cold and the snow, came with relative ease. 

""Where are we?"" Edvard asked. 

""We''re heading back to my cabin."" 

He reached up and pulled the fur-lined hood from his head, peeled the goggles from his eyes, tugged the balaclava down around his neck. His cheeks were red; his lips chapped. 

Edvard was a handsome man in his early thirties. Tan skin that had taken a softer tone from his time in the north, time spent away from the sunlight. A hard jawline with cheeks stippled by the makings of a beard. Thick, tangled hair sat on his head. Brown as oakwood. Drenched from sweat and snow into a darker shade than usual. 

The thing I'd noticed about Edvard when we first met were his eyes. Glacial blue and intense. The kind that were easy to get lost in if you weren't careful. Always watching, observing, assessing every minute detail. 

We sometimes joked that he was a reptile because we never saw him blink. And at first, it might seem disquieting, off-putting to the average person, but you quickly adjusted to it, to him, because beneath that severity, beneath that intense gaze was a profound warmth. Kindness. Selflessness. Intellect that went beyond amassed knowledge to a deep, unfathomable grasp of empathy. Of emotions and compassion. 

If it weren't already apparent, I admired Edvard. Found his gentleness, his genuine nature, commendable. Especially during a period of time when society's norms did not always condone such behaviors. 

Furtively, though, I was also envious of him. Jealous to a caustic degree. He had somehow figured out the secret to happiness. Had discovered the path to not only fulfillment, but a level of content that I would never achieve no matter how great my aspirations or achievements. 

To put it simply, I woke up every morning intent on working to earn my paycheck like everybody else. Edvard, though, awoke with the sole purpose of enlightening himself. No grandiose expectations. No incessant grind in search of monetary success. He lived and breathed for the sole purpose of experience. To do the best he could, and at the end of the day, properly acknowledge his efforts regardless of the results. 

Maybe that's why I had been so surprised to hear Edvard say: ""You should've left me out there."" 

""What?"" 

""You should've left me on the ice, out in the storm."" 

""You would've froze. I'm surprised you're still alive, Ed. You'll be lucky if you don't contract anything serious."" 

""I'm already sick."" 

""Probably because you were standing in the middle of a snowstorm! What in God's name were you thinking?"" 

Edvard turned towards me then. That faraway look in his eyes. ""There was someone out there."" 

""You're imagining things. There's no one out here but us."" 

""They're out there!"" 

""No one is out there. The company would've told us if they were bringing anyone in. And as far as I'm aware, the next research station is almost thirty miles away."" 

The cold was making me irritable. I wanted nothing more than to get back, take a warm bath, and drink some hot chocolate. Maybe play another game of chess with Donovan if he was willing to lose again. Or listen to music while watching the snowfall. I was an avid fan of Low Roar. Their music was oddly redolent of the artic. Morbidly beautiful. Haunting and surreal. 

I exhaled my grievances. ""It's just us, Ed."" 

He didn't seem convinced, but he said nothing more of the matter and leaned back in his seat, closing his eyes. ""I've got a headache."" 

""We'll get you some aspirin when we get back."" 

Gently, he massaged his temples as if to work the kinks from his brain. ""Thank you, Emily."" 

I hated when people called me by the wrong name, but Edvard wasn't in a state of mind to be scolded or reprimanded. 

""I'll keep you overnight to monitor your status,"" I said, ""and assuming you haven't developed hypothermia by then, I'll take you back home in the morning. Maybe Donovan will help me retrieve your Snow Cat at some point."" 

Edvard showed no interest in the current subject, and instead, said: ""I had a dream about you last night."" 

I scoffed. ""For both our sakes, don't tell Mia that."" 

""You were dancing at the center of the sun,"" Edvard continued. ""I think you were laughing. Even as the inferno swallowed you whole, you looked as if you were laughing."" 

I blinked. The silence between us swelled, combated only by the sound of the wind as it thrashed the metal exterior of the Snow Cat. 

""Maybe we should just let this be a time of silent reflection,"" I suggested. ""Take a moment to really think before we speak."" 

Surprisingly, this made Edvard laugh. A subtle gradual thing that soon filled the inner cabin of the Snow Cat. 

""If nothing else,"" he said, ""you're funnier than...than me."" 

I shook my head in disbelief. ""Thanks. Glad to see the cabin fever hasn't completely turned you mad."" 

Again, he croaked with laughter. A small, humored chuckle that sat in his throat like the call of a toad. 

""Humor is a good trait to possess,"" he told me. ""From what I have surmised, the general population appreciates good humor over almost anything else. They find it charismatic, endearing."" 

The cold had corroded his brain, left him in a detached state trying to further distance hiself from the trauma he'd endured. From the realization that he had faced the distinct possibility of death not twenty minutes prior. 

I wasn't going to burst that bubble, wasn't going to ruin his method of coping. 

Simply, I told him: ""Ed, I think that is a very astute conclusion."" 

This seemed to invoke some semblance of joy within him. A hint of pride for his meager assessment. And we were able to finish the remainder of our drive in peace. 

When we finally reached my cabin, I killed the Snow Cat's engine and climbed out from the cab. I lagged behind, allowing Edvard to pass me and enter the cabin first, convinced that he might try to run away if I weren't there to block him. 

But now that I was with him, that he was no longer alone with his thoughts, he seemed cooperative, compliant. More so than usual. 

Edvard was the unofficial leader of our little group. The spokesman for the skeleton crew. He ordered our supplies and reported to the company whenever they reached out, which wasn't often since most back at headquarters were away for the holiday. 

He didn't have any real authority, not like our actual superiors. He couldn't orders us about or terminate our positions or anything like that. But he'd been taking on some of the responsibilities the rest of us wished to avoid, and for that, we were all grateful. Maybe that had been affecting him. Maybe that's what had driven him out into the storm. The surmounted pressure and additional stress coupled with the inevitable madness provoked by isolation, by a lack of sunlight and exercise. 

I would've asked him about it, not that he necessarily would've admitted this, but I was bone-cold and exhausted. I didn't want to have a serious conversation then. Didn't want to deal with the burden. I just wanted to call it a night and relax. Handle it in the morning after I had some rest. Or about as close to rest as I could get. 

So, instead of talking, I ran a hot shower and let Edvard wash up first. I threw his clothes into laundry and started cooking tomato soup and grilled cheese sandwiches for dinner. 

Then, I radioed the others to give them an update. They had more questions than I had answers. I told them what little I knew and promised to give any updates if I found out more. An empty promise. 

Edvard was an adult. Fully capable of making his own choices. If he wanted to talk, I was more than willing to listen. But in my mind, the last thing I would have wanted at a time like this was someone else poking and prodding, dissecting my every thought and decision as if I were no more than a hapless child. 

That didn't mean I wasn't going to keep an eye on him. He was in my cabin, and therefore, under my supervision. Until I felt comfortable enough with his current state of well-being, I wasn't going to let him leave. 

Some people might think I was being completely ignorant or stupid, and maybe I was to some degree, but I would tell those people you weren't there. You don't know Edvard like I do. Not that we're exactly close, but we've all been working together for the better part of a year. Forced to spend almost every day within close proximity. 

It's not like we just clocked out at the end of the workday. Not like we could go to the bar on the weekends. If we wanted to socialize, it was with each other. If we wanted to play games or share a drink or have a movie night, there were only so many people we could do that with. Friendship or not, we were victims of circumstance. Animals sharing the same exhibit. 

You either learned to appreciate the company of the other twenty-five individuals around you, or you spent all your time locked inside your cabin slowly losing your mind. 

At this point, I'd had more conversations with Edvard or Donovan or Mia or any of the other twenty-three analysts than I'd had with my actual friends, possibly even certain members of my family. We were more than familiar with each other. 

Edvard was whimsical, but he wasn't an idiot. He wasn't crazy or insane or anything like that. He was fully self-aware, more cognizant than ninety percent of the people I'd encountered throughout my life. And from what I could tell, he didn't seem depressed. Wasn't displaying negative behavior to lead me to suspect that he had gone out into the storm with the intention of dying. 

Still, despite my rationality, he had gone out there for a reason. There was an intention. 

""I don't know,"" he had admitted between bites of his grilled cheese. About half of his tomato soup still remained, wafting little streams of mist into the air. ""I just...I really thought someone was out there. I would've put all my money on it. Every last dollar."" 

""And your first instinct was to go after them?"" I said. 

""I didn't want them to freeze."" He took another bite and chewed. ""I mean, didn't you do the same thing for me?"" 

""That's different. I was almost certain you were out there. The transmitter even said so."" 

""Still. There was a slight chance that I wasn't."" 

""I guess."" 

""But you went out there anyway."" 

""Alright, Ed, you've convinced me. Next time I notice you're miles from your cabin in the middle of a snowstorm, I'll just leave you be."" 

He laughed. ""That's not what I'm getting at."" 

""What are you getting at then?"" 

He contemplated this as he chewed, going back and forth between his sandwich and soup until neither remained. 

""Human nature is self-destructive at its core,"" he finally said. ""They're...we're...it's practically intrinsic to do anything in our power to help another member of the species without any regard for our own well-being."" 

I looked at him for a long time without saying anything. Bemused by his statement, stupefied even. Then, when I did speak, I told him: ""You have severely misinterpreted human nature if that's what you believe."" 

""Oh?"" He seemed disappointed. ""Is that so? Enlighten me then."" 

""Gladly."" I set my sandwich on the plate and leaned back in my seat. ""Have I ever told you about my father?"" 

He wracked his brain for a memory that I already knew didn't exist. 

""He was a good person,"" I explained. ""Served in the army for about seven and a half years. Honorably discharged due to mental concerns. Spent the rest of his life working minimum wage at a steel mill during the week. Nighttime security gigs at a bar downtown on the weekends. 

""One day,"" I told him, ""he just dies. Heart failure. No warnings really. He was overweight and had been a smoker in his younger days, but other than that, fit as a fiddle."" 

""Okay?"" 

""Well, we didn't have much money growing up. We were just above the poverty line. So, as you might imagine, we struggled to pay the funeral charges. It's expensive to properly dispose of a body. Whether you cremate or bury."" 

""What did you do?"" 

""We went to the VA, but they weren't going to cover it. Started a fundraiser, online and in-person. That helped. People donated, more than I expected, but at the end of the day, my family was stuck with a substantial bill. One that we are still paying, and it's been almost three years."" 

Edvard frowned. ""I'm not fully grasping--"" 

""The point is, there are good people and bad people. Two sides to every coin. But self-destructive, in a selfess sacrificial way, I don't think so."" I pushed my plate away. My appetite had abandoned me. ""There's a reason humanity still exists while other species go extinct. We're hard-wired for survival. Our sense of self-preservation is greater than our innate emotional response to the condition of others."" 

""You think people should have donated more? Until they had nothing left to give?"" 

""Not at all. I don't hold a grudge, I don't have any grievances. Hell, I'd probably do the same thing they did in given circumstances. But if our empathy is as great as you want to believe, we wouldn't have struggled in the least to pay for my father's funeral. There wouldn't be homelessness or poverty or starving nations. Society wouldn't completely break at the first sight of a pandemic. But these things do exist, they happen because we're self-centered...most of us, at least. We worry about number one and hope number two or three or four never come knocking on our door in search of help."" 

""Then why did you come out looking for...me?"" 

""I don't know. I just couldn't stand the idea of a coworker--a friend, being out there. Left alone like that."" 

""Maybe you don't give the human race enough credit."" 

""Or maybe I'm just an idiot lacking the necessity for self-preservation."" 

""I'mnot entirely convinced."" He smiled then. A gentle pull at the corner of his lips. ""I possess enough knowledge, sufficient memories and experience to know that humanity can be full of destruction and hostility, but there's still compassion out there. Enough altruism to deem worthwhile. It's a species worth protecting, one worth being apart of. Don't you think?"" 

I scoffed. The conversation was absurd, but the question itself was beyond ridiculous. Not exactly what I expected from that night. 

It was commonplace to discuss politics or literature. Pop culture and movies. Weekend plans or outings with the family. The sanctity of humanity, the value of society, that just wasn't a popular topic. 

""I think it's getting late,"" I said. ""I think we're too tired to be discussing ethical dilemmas or analyzing human nature."" 

He put his hands up in surrender. ""Alright, fine. But let me ask you one last thing, and I'll leave it alone: what makes a person? What standards qualify someone as a human being?"" 

""Easy, they know when to drop a conversation."" I retrieved my dishes and carried them over to the sink. ""Looks like you've still got some learning to do."" 

""I guess so."" 

We cleaned up after dinner. I washed and he dried. Then, while Edvard looked through my collection of books and board games, I took a shower. The water was warm and thawed the cold from my body, melted away the stress that had pulled my muscles taut. Helped clear the fuzz from my mind. 

When I stepped out, I found Edvard waiting for me in the doorway of the bathroom. I don't know how long he'd been there, but the moment caught us both by surprise. 

""What the hell are you doing?"" I remarked. 

He lifted his hand, holding up a book for me to see, a casual expression across his face as if I hadn't caught him watching me shower. It might sound stupid, but his nonchalance made any internal alarms go silent. As if it were a misunderstanding. Bad timing kind of scenario. 

""Can I borrow this?"" he asked, holding out my father's copy of Thomas Ligotti's 'The Conspiracy Against the Human Race' on display. 

""Uh...sure."" I waited a moment, towel wrapped around my body, before asking: ""You mind getting out so I can change?"" 

He frowned. A reddish hue flooded his cheeks. ""Right, sorry. Yeah. Just one of those days."" He backed out of the bathroom. ""Again, sorry. Completely inappropriate of me."" 

Once the door was closed, I swapped my towel for a pair of checkered pajama bottoms and a plain gray sweatshirt. Cotton polymer that was softer than any pillow or cloud in existence. 

The small things in life are sometimes the most fruitful. Little pleasures to make the rest no more than a distant memory. That greasy fast food takeout after a long day at work. That cup of coco after spending the morning shoveling your driveway. A tub of cookie dough ice cream after getting dumped by the only girl you ever loved. Brief moments of reprieve from reality. Distractions to keep your sanity intact. Comfort in the simplest form. 

When I came out of the bathroom, I found Edvard sitting on the couch reading my father's book. He glanced at me and offered a soft smile. A strange way to clear the air, but for the life of me, I couldn't think of a better alternative. I'm sure one existed, but at the time, I was still in an awkward mindset of whether I should be upset, pissed, ashamed, or mortified. 

""I'm going to put the kettle on,"" I said. ""You want a cup of tea?"" 

""Tea?"" 

""Crushed leaves and hot water."" 

He chuckled. ""I know what tea is..."" He pondered a moment. ""Is it any good?"" 

""You've never had tea before?"" 

""No, yeah, I have, but what kind?"" 

""I've got Sleepytime Vanilla, peppermint, and Throat Coat."" I checked the cabinet. ""I've also got homebrew coffee and hot chocolate with marshmallows."" 

The variety in choice seemed to confuse him. ""Uh..."" 

""Is that an answer?"" 

Again, that warm, crooked smile. ""You know better than me. I'll let you decide."" 

I filled the kettle with water and set it on the burner. Then, I went to my rig to perform the nightly check in. 

Mia was getting ready for bed. It seemed a little early, but lately, she'd been laying in bed for hours on end, unable to fall asleep. Her theory was that if she lay down around eight or nine at night, she might be asleep by ten or eleven. 

Donovan was in the middle of a Studio Ghibli marathon. He'd been watching 'Nausicaa of the Valley of the Wind' when I radioed in. For those that don't know Donovan, the last thing you wanted to do was interrupt him during a movie. 

So, I skipped the niceties and any attempt at conversation. Told them I would check back in the morning. I wanted to mention Edvard, talk about the way he was acting, the things he'd been saying, but like with Donovan and Oscar, it was hard to broach the matter with him in the same room, listening to our conversation. 

After recording temperatures, weather conditions, and seismic activity, I muted my systems and grabbed the kettle from the stove. I poured a cup of Sleeptyime Vanilla for myself and Throat Coat for Edvard. 

When I came into the living room, Edvard dog-eared his current page and looked up at me. ""Can I ask you something?"" 

""Depends,"" I said, ""what's it about?"" 

""You're father."" 

""You can ask, but I can't promise to give an answer."" 

""Fair enough, all things considered."" 

I set the cup of Throat Coat on the coffee table in front of him and took a seat in my desk chair at the other end of the room. 

""Alright, shoot,"" I said. 

""Shoot?"" 

""Figure of speech, Ed. Never knew you to be so literal."" 

He tittered and shrugged helplessly. ""Like I said, weird day. Feeling a bit off. Like I've just awoken from a dream."" 

""I know that feeling. Sort of like deja vu."" 

His brow knitted with uncertainty. ""I guess so, yeah."" He set the book on the cushion beside him and took his mug by the handle, lifting it to his lips. 

""Wiat a minute, that's--"" 

But he was already gulping it down. Wisps of steam masked his face as he emptied the mug. Then, he set it back on the coffee table and exhaled. 

""Nevermind,"" I muttered. ""Guess you don't really need tastebuds anyway."" 

I blew on my coco before taking a drink. I don't know how he didn't react because I practically scorched the interior of my mouth with just one sip. 

""Anyways,"" I said, stifling a yelp, ""you had a question about my father?"" 

""Right. I was going to ask if you missed him."" 

""Of course. It'd be a crime not to."" 

""Would it?"" 

""Another figure of speech, Ed. Seriously, whats going on with you?"" 

""No, no. I understand. I just mean, what if I didn't miss my own father."" 

""I wasn't aware your father had passed."" 

He pursed his lips, forming a firm line across his mouth. ""Both of my parents...actually
They...uh...they died in a car accident."" 

I couldn't help the shocked expression on my face. Edvard was so vibrant and optimistic. Hard to imagine he had ever experienced any serious trauma. But that's just the way some people coped. Turn to the positive and leave the past behind. Let your shadow follow at your heels instead of plaguing your mind. 

""I don't really feel much of anything about their deaths,"" he confessed. ""Shouldn't I, though?"" 

""Well, when did it happen?"" 

""I was a child. They were coming back from a date, and I was stuck at home with the babysitter. A young neighbor girl from across the hall. 

""I remember hearing the police sirens from down the road,"" he recalled. ""When I looked out the window, I could see the lights flashing in the distance. I felt...helpless. Trapped. I don't know how I knew it was them, I just did. But now, I don't feel anything. It's like I'm watching that moment on TV. Like it was someone else's life."" 

""I'm not a psychologist, but it sounds like you're still in shock."" 

He shook his head. ""No. I remember being in shock at the time. I don't know what this is."" 

""You can be in shock more than once. Some realities take years to set in. It's not like you experience it once and it's done. These things come in waves. 

""Some days..."" I paused, wondering if this was something I wanted to share with him. Something I wanted to share with anybody. ""Some days, I get up and get out of bed like anybody else. I feel fine, normal. Just go through the motions and that's that. But then there are days when I might hear a certain song or watch a certain movie or read a certain book, and it feels like I've lost my father for the first time again. Like I'm back in that moment when my brother called to tell me..."" 

Edvard stared at me, wide-eyed and completely enthralled. As if we were sharing ghost stories around the campfire. 

""It comes and goes,"" I finished. ""You don't ever stop grieving, you just learn to carry that weight. To manage it so that it doesn't crush you."" 

""What if you could forget it?"" he asked. ""Lose those memories. Would you?"" 

That was a tough question. Well, I suppose the question itself wasn't harder than any other question, but the answer was complicated. Difficult to put into words, to explain outside of just feeling it. 

""I'm not sure, honestly,"" I said. ""I mean, that's why people drink or smoke or whatever. Because they want to distract themselves, want to forget their pain. But I don't think you can. Not without causing more issues for yourself."" 

""You'll have to expound on that a little more for me."" 

""Life isn't a steak,"" I explained. ""You can't just cut away the fatty bits. I wish you could, and I suppose some people really do try, but in my experience, it just doesn't work like that. It's a package deal. You get the good with the bad. Trying to eliminate that, to cut out the parts you don't like, it'll hurt you as a person. It would completely erase any tolerance for pain and leave you with unrealistic expectations. You wouldn't really be yourself if you removed the memories you didn't want."" 

""To suffer is a better alternative?"" 

""To suffer is to be human. Just like with love and hate, joy and anger. We have to experience all those emotions at some point or another, otherwise we become blind to reality."" 

He seemed enthralled by this notion. Completely absorbed by the topic at hand. 

""But I get where you're coming from,"" I admitted. ""I've been there. So overwhelmed by your grief that you almost finding yourself wishing you don't exist. That you weren't real because then, you wouldn't have to feel anything at all. All that heartbreak, all that confusion and madness just fades away if you aren't there to indulge it. It becomes illusory."" 

Edvard leaned back, resting his chin in between his forefinger and thumb. ""Interesting..."" 

""It's been a long day,"" I told him. ""Let's just call it an early night. Try to get some sleep and clear our heads."" 

Silently, he nodded. 

I retrieved an extra set of pillows and blankets from the closet. I offered to sleep on the couch, but Edvard refused. He'd already taken the better half of my day with his antics. He didn't want to put me out any further by taking my bed. I was too tired to argue. 

I turned out the lights and climbed beneath the covers. It took me a while to fall asleep. Partially because my brain wouldn't shut down. That's been a problem since childhood. Even when my body was on the brink of collapse, my mind stayed active. 

But also, I wanted to wait until Edvard had fallen asleep. Not that he would have done anything, not that I didn't feel safe around him, but there was just this feeling I had. I didn't know what it was, but I couldn't allow myself to go to bed until I knew he was asleep first. 

That eventually came when I heard his soft snores sneaking through the dark. Then, and only then, did I close my eyes and relax. 

It probably comes as no surprise that I dreamt of my father that night. I was outside, caught in the middle of an icestorm. There was nothing around me for miles. Empty fields laden with snow. Endless hills rolling in the distance like the gentle peeks of ebbing ocean waves. The sky was pitch-black. No sun, no moon, no stars. Just a blank void of darkness. 

I could hear my father calling out to me. It'd been so long since I heard his voice, but even then, I could tell that it wasn't him. It was a guttural sound. Sharp and grating, but inexplicably, I was convinced that it was my father. The way that dream logic makes no rational sense, but you accept it as fact anyways. 

I followed the voice through the storm until it came from directly beneath me. Then, I fell to my knees and started digging. I didn't have a shovel or gloves or any equipment. So, I dug with my bare hands. 

My fingers went from red to pale blue. My muscles ached and burned. But I kept digging, pushing away mound after mound of snow. I found his corpse buried beneath a thick wall of ice. Arms raised and hands poised as if trying to claw his way out. 

I blinked, and my father was replaced by Edvard. I blinked again, and this time, it was Donovan. Short black hair, and a thin mustache above his upper lip. Skin the color of milk. Then, it was Mia. Long, auburn-red hair and soft green eyes. Mouth partially open as if frozen mid-scream. 

Lifting my fist, I pounded on the ice, cracking the first layer with relative ease but struggling to break through anything deeper than that. 

The wind picked up. Snow pelted me at an incredible speed, dragging across my flesh like the edge of a razor blade. 

When I blinked again, Mia was gone. Instead, it was me beneath the ice. A reflection interspersed by a spiderweb of cracks. 

I awoke with a lump in my throat, wanting to scream but unable. My lips were locked together. I was paralyzed. 

At my bedside, Edvard loomed over me. He had a blank gaze in his eyes, looking without seeing. A lantern absent of light. 

""I am here,"" he said.",1,1737528650.0,scaryjujuarmy,0,1.0,False
1i759pn,https://www.reddit.com/r/ZakBabyTV_Stories/comments/1i759pn/theres_something_out_there_underneath_the_ice_pt/,There's Something Out There Underneath the Ice [Pt. 2 /3],"The wind ripped at my jacket, pulled at the length of rope connecting me to the plow. 

""Ed,"" I begged, ""we have to go!"" 

This time, he didn't say anything. He just stared at me, a blank look in his eyes. 

""Ed!"" I yelled. ""Nevermind, screw it!""

We didn't have time to stand around talking. Every second out there was another second closer to hypothermia. 

I pulled him away, back towards my Snow Cat. Edvard's feet stumbled against the ground, somewhat walking but mostly dragging. I forced him into the passenger seat of my plow and unhooked myself from the anchor rope. With the click of button, it retracted onto the reel. 

Climbing into the driver's seat, I closed the door and cranked the heat as high as it would go. I was exhausted. Felt as if I'd just finished a marathon. Really, we traveled less than a mile. 

I yanked the goggles off my head and wiped the sweat and tears away before taking hold of the control levers. Then, we started for my cabin. Along the way, I radioed the others to let them know what happened. 

""Is he alright?"" Mia asked. 

""What the hell was he doing?"" said Donovan. 

""I've got him, safe and sound. That's all that matters right now,"" I replied. ""I'll get back to you once were at the cabin."" Then, I turned off the radio to focus on the drive. 

The storm was picking up, smearing the landscape into a swirl of white. Antarctica could be a beautiful place if you ignored the cold. Glittering stretches of open terrain. An endless sky that sometimes was blue as the ocean or red as a fire. Pink in the early morning, maybe a shade of purple late at night with soft tinges of vibrant green. But most of the time, especially in the winter months, it was black. Dark as the bottom of the sea. 

In that moment, I felt a sense of nostalgia for my first week at the research station. Long before I had become inured to the boredom and treacherous nature of the artic. 

In a strange way, perhaps even in a nonsensical, inexplicable way, I had felt like an astronaut. As if I were exploring what few had seen before. A lone lifeform adrift in the barren void of space. Special. Not because of who I was or what I could do, but because of what I was in relation to my environment. An odd entity that existed somewhere it wasn't meant to be. A flower in the desert, a heartbeat amongst the dead. 

That feeling quickly abandoned me during my second or third week. My sense of awe had been combatted by the long hours of nothing, trapped inside my cabin for hours on end. 

My distaste for the artic, for the cold and the snow, came with relative ease. 

""Where are we?"" Edvard asked. 

""We''re heading back to my cabin."" 

He reached up and pulled the fur-lined hood from his head, peeled the goggles from his eyes, tugged the balaclava down around his neck. His cheeks were red; his lips chapped. 

Edvard was a handsome man in his early thirties. Tan skin that had taken a softer tone from his time in the north, time spent away from the sunlight. A hard jawline with cheeks stippled by the makings of a beard. Thick, tangled hair sat on his head. Brown as oakwood. Drenched from sweat and snow into a darker shade than usual. 

The thing I'd noticed about Edvard when we first met were his eyes. Glacial blue and intense. The kind that were easy to get lost in if you weren't careful. Always watching, observing, assessing every minute detail. 

We sometimes joked that he was a reptile because we never saw him blink. And at first, it might seem disquieting, off-putting to the average person, but you quickly adjusted to it, to him, because beneath that severity, beneath that intense gaze was a profound warmth. Kindness. Selflessness. Intellect that went beyond amassed knowledge to a deep, unfathomable grasp of empathy. Of emotions and compassion. 

If it weren't already apparent, I admired Edvard. Found his gentleness, his genuine nature, commendable. Especially during a period of time when society's norms did not always condone such behaviors. 

Furtively, though, I was also envious of him. Jealous to a caustic degree. He had somehow figured out the secret to happiness. Had discovered the path to not only fulfillment, but a level of content that I would never achieve no matter how great my aspirations or achievements. 

To put it simply, I woke up every morning intent on working to earn my paycheck like everybody else. Edvard, though, awoke with the sole purpose of enlightening himself. No grandiose expectations. No incessant grind in search of monetary success. He lived and breathed for the sole purpose of experience. To do the best he could, and at the end of the day, properly acknowledge his efforts regardless of the results. 

Maybe that's why I had been so surprised to hear Edvard say: ""You should've left me out there."" 

""What?"" 

""You should've left me on the ice, out in the storm."" 

""You would've froze. I'm surprised you're still alive, Ed. You'll be lucky if you don't contract anything serious."" 

""I'm already sick."" 

""Probably because you were standing in the middle of a snowstorm! What in God's name were you thinking?"" 

Edvard turned towards me then. That faraway look in his eyes. ""There was someone out there."" 

""You're imagining things. There's no one out here but us."" 

""They're out there!"" 

""No one is out there. The company would've told us if they were bringing anyone in. And as far as I'm aware, the next research station is almost thirty miles away."" 

The cold was making me irritable. I wanted nothing more than to get back, take a warm bath, and drink some hot chocolate. Maybe play another game of chess with Donovan if he was willing to lose again. Or listen to music while watching the snowfall. I was an avid fan of Low Roar. Their music was oddly redolent of the artic. Morbidly beautiful. Haunting and surreal. 

I exhaled my grievances. ""It's just us, Ed."" 

He didn't seem convinced, but he said nothing more of the matter and leaned back in his seat, closing his eyes. ""I've got a headache."" 

""We'll get you some aspirin when we get back."" 

Gently, he massaged his temples as if to work the kinks from his brain. ""Thank you, Emily."" 

I hated when people called me by the wrong name, but Edvard wasn't in a state of mind to be scolded or reprimanded. 

""I'll keep you overnight to monitor your status,"" I said, ""and assuming you haven't developed hypothermia by then, I'll take you back home in the morning. Maybe Donovan will help me retrieve your Snow Cat at some point."" 

Edvard showed no interest in the current subject, and instead, said: ""I had a dream about you last night."" 

I scoffed. ""For both our sakes, don't tell Mia that."" 

""You were dancing at the center of the sun,"" Edvard continued. ""I think you were laughing. Even as the inferno swallowed you whole, you looked as if you were laughing."" 

I blinked. The silence between us swelled, combated only by the sound of the wind as it thrashed the metal exterior of the Snow Cat. 

""Maybe we should just let this be a time of silent reflection,"" I suggested. ""Take a moment to really think before we speak."" 

Surprisingly, this made Edvard laugh. A subtle gradual thing that soon filled the inner cabin of the Snow Cat. 

""If nothing else,"" he said, ""you're funnier than...than me."" 

I shook my head in disbelief. ""Thanks. Glad to see the cabin fever hasn't completely turned you mad."" 

Again, he croaked with laughter. A small, humored chuckle that sat in his throat like the call of a toad. 

""Humor is a good trait to possess,"" he told me. ""From what I have surmised, the general population appreciates good humor over almost anything else. They find it charismatic, endearing."" 

The cold had corroded his brain, left him in a detached state trying to further distance hiself from the trauma he'd endured. From the realization that he had faced the distinct possibility of death not twenty minutes prior. 

I wasn't going to burst that bubble, wasn't going to ruin his method of coping. 

Simply, I told him: ""Ed, I think that is a very astute conclusion."" 

This seemed to invoke some semblance of joy within him. A hint of pride for his meager assessment. And we were able to finish the remainder of our drive in peace. 

When we finally reached my cabin, I killed the Snow Cat's engine and climbed out from the cab. I lagged behind, allowing Edvard to pass me and enter the cabin first, convinced that he might try to run away if I weren't there to block him. 

But now that I was with him, that he was no longer alone with his thoughts, he seemed cooperative, compliant. More so than usual. 

Edvard was the unofficial leader of our little group. The spokesman for the skeleton crew. He ordered our supplies and reported to the company whenever they reached out, which wasn't often since most back at headquarters were away for the holiday. 

He didn't have any real authority, not like our actual superiors. He couldn't orders us about or terminate our positions or anything like that. But he'd been taking on some of the responsibilities the rest of us wished to avoid, and for that, we were all grateful. Maybe that had been affecting him. Maybe that's what had driven him out into the storm. The surmounted pressure and additional stress coupled with the inevitable madness provoked by isolation, by a lack of sunlight and exercise. 

I would've asked him about it, not that he necessarily would've admitted this, but I was bone-cold and exhausted. I didn't want to have a serious conversation then. Didn't want to deal with the burden. I just wanted to call it a night and relax. Handle it in the morning after I had some rest. Or about as close to rest as I could get. 

So, instead of talking, I ran a hot shower and let Edvard wash up first. I threw his clothes into laundry and started cooking tomato soup and grilled cheese sandwiches for dinner. 

Then, I radioed the others to give them an update. They had more questions than I had answers. I told them what little I knew and promised to give any updates if I found out more. An empty promise. 

Edvard was an adult. Fully capable of making his own choices. If he wanted to talk, I was more than willing to listen. But in my mind, the last thing I would have wanted at a time like this was someone else poking and prodding, dissecting my every thought and decision as if I were no more than a hapless child. 

That didn't mean I wasn't going to keep an eye on him. He was in my cabin, and therefore, under my supervision. Until I felt comfortable enough with his current state of well-being, I wasn't going to let him leave. 

Some people might think I was being completely ignorant or stupid, and maybe I was to some degree, but I would tell those people you weren't there. You don't know Edvard like I do. Not that we're exactly close, but we've all been working together for the better part of a year. Forced to spend almost every day within close proximity. 

It's not like we just clocked out at the end of the workday. Not like we could go to the bar on the weekends. If we wanted to socialize, it was with each other. If we wanted to play games or share a drink or have a movie night, there were only so many people we could do that with. Friendship or not, we were victims of circumstance. Animals sharing the same exhibit. 

You either learned to appreciate the company of the other twenty-five individuals around you, or you spent all your time locked inside your cabin slowly losing your mind. 

At this point, I'd had more conversations with Edvard or Donovan or Mia or any of the other twenty-three analysts than I'd had with my actual friends, possibly even certain members of my family. We were more than familiar with each other. 

Edvard was whimsical, but he wasn't an idiot. He wasn't crazy or insane or anything like that. He was fully self-aware, more cognizant than ninety percent of the people I'd encountered throughout my life. And from what I could tell, he didn't seem depressed. Wasn't displaying negative behavior to lead me to suspect that he had gone out into the storm with the intention of dying. 

Still, despite my rationality, he had gone out there for a reason. There was an intention. 

""I don't know,"" he had admitted between bites of his grilled cheese. About half of his tomato soup still remained, wafting little streams of mist into the air. ""I just...I really thought someone was out there. I would've put all my money on it. Every last dollar."" 

""And your first instinct was to go after them?"" I said. 

""I didn't want them to freeze."" He took another bite and chewed. ""I mean, didn't you do the same thing for me?"" 

""That's different. I was almost certain you were out there. The transmitter even said so."" 

""Still. There was a slight chance that I wasn't."" 

""I guess."" 

""But you went out there anyway."" 

""Alright, Ed, you've convinced me. Next time I notice you're miles from your cabin in the middle of a snowstorm, I'll just leave you be."" 

He laughed. ""That's not what I'm getting at."" 

""What are you getting at then?"" 

He contemplated this as he chewed, going back and forth between his sandwich and soup until neither remained. 

""Human nature is self-destructive at its core,"" he finally said. ""They're...we're...it's practically intrinsic to do anything in our power to help another member of the species without any regard for our own well-being."" 

I looked at him for a long time without saying anything. Bemused by his statement, stupefied even. Then, when I did speak, I told him: ""You have severely misinterpreted human nature if that's what you believe."" 

""Oh?"" He seemed disappointed. ""Is that so? Enlighten me then."" 

""Gladly."" I set my sandwich on the plate and leaned back in my seat. ""Have I ever told you about my father?"" 

He wracked his brain for a memory that I already knew didn't exist. 

""He was a good person,"" I explained. ""Served in the army for about seven and a half years. Honorably discharged due to mental concerns. Spent the rest of his life working minimum wage at a steel mill during the week. Nighttime security gigs at a bar downtown on the weekends. 

""One day,"" I told him, ""he just dies. Heart failure. No warnings really. He was overweight and had been a smoker in his younger days, but other than that, fit as a fiddle."" 

""Okay?"" 

""Well, we didn't have much money growing up. We were just above the poverty line. So, as you might imagine, we struggled to pay the funeral charges. It's expensive to properly dispose of a body. Whether you cremate or bury."" 

""What did you do?"" 

""We went to the VA, but they weren't going to cover it. Started a fundraiser, online and in-person. That helped. People donated, more than I expected, but at the end of the day, my family was stuck with a substantial bill. One that we are still paying, and it's been almost three years."" 

Edvard frowned. ""I'm not fully grasping--"" 

""The point is, there are good people and bad people. Two sides to every coin. But self-destructive, in a selfess sacrificial way, I don't think so."" I pushed my plate away. My appetite had abandoned me. ""There's a reason humanity still exists while other species go extinct. We're hard-wired for survival. Our sense of self-preservation is greater than our innate emotional response to the condition of others."" 

""You think people should have donated more? Until they had nothing left to give?"" 

""Not at all. I don't hold a grudge, I don't have any grievances. Hell, I'd probably do the same thing they did in given circumstances. But if our empathy is as great as you want to believe, we wouldn't have struggled in the least to pay for my father's funeral. There wouldn't be homelessness or poverty or starving nations. Society wouldn't completely break at the first sight of a pandemic. But these things do exist, they happen because we're self-centered...most of us, at least. We worry about number one and hope number two or three or four never come knocking on our door in search of help."" 

""Then why did you come out looking for...me?"" 

""I don't know. I just couldn't stand the idea of a coworker--a friend, being out there. Left alone like that."" 

""Maybe you don't give the human race enough credit."" 

""Or maybe I'm just an idiot lacking the necessity for self-preservation."" 

""I'mnot entirely convinced."" He smiled then. A gentle pull at the corner of his lips. ""I possess enough knowledge, sufficient memories and experience to know that humanity can be full of destruction and hostility, but there's still compassion out there. Enough altruism to deem worthwhile. It's a species worth protecting, one worth being apart of. Don't you think?"" 

I scoffed. The conversation was absurd, but the question itself was beyond ridiculous. Not exactly what I expected from that night. 

It was commonplace to discuss politics or literature. Pop culture and movies. Weekend plans or outings with the family. The sanctity of humanity, the value of society, that just wasn't a popular topic. 

""I think it's getting late,"" I said. ""I think we're too tired to be discussing ethical dilemmas or analyzing human nature."" 

He put his hands up in surrender. ""Alright, fine. But let me ask you one last thing, and I'll leave it alone: what makes a person? What standards qualify someone as a human being?"" 

""Easy, they know when to drop a conversation."" I retrieved my dishes and carried them over to the sink. ""Looks like you've still got some learning to do."" 

""I guess so."" 

We cleaned up after dinner. I washed and he dried. Then, while Edvard looked through my collection of books and board games, I took a shower. The water was warm and thawed the cold from my body, melted away the stress that had pulled my muscles taut. Helped clear the fuzz from my mind. 

When I stepped out, I found Edvard waiting for me in the doorway of the bathroom. I don't know how long he'd been there, but the moment caught us both by surprise. 

""What the hell are you doing?"" I remarked. 

He lifted his hand, holding up a book for me to see, a casual expression across his face as if I hadn't caught him watching me shower. It might sound stupid, but his nonchalance made any internal alarms go silent. As if it were a misunderstanding. Bad timing kind of scenario. 

""Can I borrow this?"" he asked, holding out my father's copy of Thomas Ligotti's 'The Conspiracy Against the Human Race' on display. 

""Uh...sure."" I waited a moment, towel wrapped around my body, before asking: ""You mind getting out so I can change?"" 

He frowned. A reddish hue flooded his cheeks. ""Right, sorry. Yeah. Just one of those days."" He backed out of the bathroom. ""Again, sorry. Completely inappropriate of me."" 

Once the door was closed, I swapped my towel for a pair of checkered pajama bottoms and a plain gray sweatshirt. Cotton polymer that was softer than any pillow or cloud in existence. 

The small things in life are sometimes the most fruitful. Little pleasures to make the rest no more than a distant memory. That greasy fast food takeout after a long day at work. That cup of coco after spending the morning shoveling your driveway. A tub of cookie dough ice cream after getting dumped by the only girl you ever loved. Brief moments of reprieve from reality. Distractions to keep your sanity intact. Comfort in the simplest form. 

When I came out of the bathroom, I found Edvard sitting on the couch reading my father's book. He glanced at me and offered a soft smile. A strange way to clear the air, but for the life of me, I couldn't think of a better alternative. I'm sure one existed, but at the time, I was still in an awkward mindset of whether I should be upset, pissed, ashamed, or mortified. 

""I'm going to put the kettle on,"" I said. ""You want a cup of tea?"" 

""Tea?"" 

""Crushed leaves and hot water."" 

He chuckled. ""I know what tea is..."" He pondered a moment. ""Is it any good?"" 

""You've never had tea before?"" 

""No, yeah, I have, but what kind?"" 

""I've got Sleepytime Vanilla, peppermint, and Throat Coat."" I checked the cabinet. ""I've also got homebrew coffee and hot chocolate with marshmallows."" 

The variety in choice seemed to confuse him. ""Uh..."" 

""Is that an answer?"" 

Again, that warm, crooked smile. ""You know better than me. I'll let you decide."" 

I filled the kettle with water and set it on the burner. Then, I went to my rig to perform the nightly check in. 

Mia was getting ready for bed. It seemed a little early, but lately, she'd been laying in bed for hours on end, unable to fall asleep. Her theory was that if she lay down around eight or nine at night, she might be asleep by ten or eleven. 

Donovan was in the middle of a Studio Ghibli marathon. He'd been watching 'Nausicaa of the Valley of the Wind' when I radioed in. For those that don't know Donovan, the last thing you wanted to do was interrupt him during a movie. 

So, I skipped the niceties and any attempt at conversation. Told them I would check back in the morning. I wanted to mention Edvard, talk about the way he was acting, the things he'd been saying, but like with Donovan and Oscar, it was hard to broach the matter with him in the same room, listening to our conversation. 

After recording temperatures, weather conditions, and seismic activity, I muted my systems and grabbed the kettle from the stove. I poured a cup of Sleeptyime Vanilla for myself and Throat Coat for Edvard. 

When I came into the living room, Edvard dog-eared his current page and looked up at me. ""Can I ask you something?"" 

""Depends,"" I said, ""what's it about?"" 

""You're father."" 

""You can ask, but I can't promise to give an answer."" 

""Fair enough, all things considered."" 

I set the cup of Throat Coat on the coffee table in front of him and took a seat in my desk chair at the other end of the room. 

""Alright, shoot,"" I said. 

""Shoot?"" 

""Figure of speech, Ed. Never knew you to be so literal."" 

He tittered and shrugged helplessly. ""Like I said, weird day. Feeling a bit off. Like I've just awoken from a dream."" 

""I know that feeling. Sort of like deja vu."" 

His brow knitted with uncertainty. ""I guess so, yeah."" He set the book on the cushion beside him and took his mug by the handle, lifting it to his lips. 

""Wiat a minute, that's--"" 

But he was already gulping it down. Wisps of steam masked his face as he emptied the mug. Then, he set it back on the coffee table and exhaled. 

""Nevermind,"" I muttered. ""Guess you don't really need tastebuds anyway."" 

I blew on my coco before taking a drink. I don't know how he didn't react because I practically scorched the interior of my mouth with just one sip. 

""Anyways,"" I said, stifling a yelp, ""you had a question about my father?"" 

""Right. I was going to ask if you missed him."" 

""Of course. It'd be a crime not to."" 

""Would it?"" 

""Another figure of speech, Ed. Seriously, whats going on with you?"" 

""No, no. I understand. I just mean, what if I didn't miss my own father."" 

""I wasn't aware your father had passed."" 

He pursed his lips, forming a firm line across his mouth. ""Both of my parents...actually
They...uh...they died in a car accident."" 

I couldn't help the shocked expression on my face. Edvard was so vibrant and optimistic. Hard to imagine he had ever experienced any serious trauma. But that's just the way some people coped. Turn to the positive and leave the past behind. Let your shadow follow at your heels instead of plaguing your mind. 

""I don't really feel much of anything about their deaths,"" he confessed. ""Shouldn't I, though?"" 

""Well, when did it happen?"" 

""I was a child. They were coming back from a date, and I was stuck at home with the babysitter. A young neighbor girl from across the hall. 

""I remember hearing the police sirens from down the road,"" he recalled. ""When I looked out the window, I could see the lights flashing in the distance. I felt...helpless. Trapped. I don't know how I knew it was them, I just did. But now, I don't feel anything. It's like I'm watching that moment on TV. Like it was someone else's life."" 

""I'm not a psychologist, but it sounds like you're still in shock."" 

He shook his head. ""No. I remember being in shock at the time. I don't know what this is."" 

""You can be in shock more than once. Some realities take years to set in. It's not like you experience it once and it's done. These things come in waves. 

""Some days..."" I paused, wondering if this was something I wanted to share with him. Something I wanted to share with anybody. ""Some days, I get up and get out of bed like anybody else. I feel fine, normal. Just go through the motions and that's that. But then there are days when I might hear a certain song or watch a certain movie or read a certain book, and it feels like I've lost my father for the first time again. Like I'm back in that moment when my brother called to tell me..."" 

Edvard stared at me, wide-eyed and completely enthralled. As if we were sharing ghost stories around the campfire. 

""It comes and goes,"" I finished. ""You don't ever stop grieving, you just learn to carry that weight. To manage it so that it doesn't crush you."" 

""What if you could forget it?"" he asked. ""Lose those memories. Would you?"" 

That was a tough question. Well, I suppose the question itself wasn't harder than any other question, but the answer was complicated. Difficult to put into words, to explain outside of just feeling it. 

""I'm not sure, honestly,"" I said. ""I mean, that's why people drink or smoke or whatever. Because they want to distract themselves, want to forget their pain. But I don't think you can. Not without causing more issues for yourself."" 

""You'll have to expound on that a little more for me."" 

""Life isn't a steak,"" I explained. ""You can't just cut away the fatty bits. I wish you could, and I suppose some people really do try, but in my experience, it just doesn't work like that. It's a package deal. You get the good with the bad. Trying to eliminate that, to cut out the parts you don't like, it'll hurt you as a person. It would completely erase any tolerance for pain and leave you with unrealistic expectations. You wouldn't really be yourself if you removed the memories you didn't want."" 

""To suffer is a better alternative?"" 

""To suffer is to be human. Just like with love and hate, joy and anger. We have to experience all those emotions at some point or another, otherwise we become blind to reality."" 

He seemed enthralled by this notion. Completely absorbed by the topic at hand. 

""But I get where you're coming from,"" I admitted. ""I've been there. So overwhelmed by your grief that you almost finding yourself wishing you don't exist. That you weren't real because then, you wouldn't have to feel anything at all. All that heartbreak, all that confusion and madness just fades away if you aren't there to indulge it. It becomes illusory."" 

Edvard leaned back, resting his chin in between his forefinger and thumb. ""Interesting..."" 

""It's been a long day,"" I told him. ""Let's just call it an early night. Try to get some sleep and clear our heads."" 

Silently, he nodded. 

I retrieved an extra set of pillows and blankets from the closet. I offered to sleep on the couch, but Edvard refused. He'd already taken the better half of my day with his antics. He didn't want to put me out any further by taking my bed. I was too tired to argue. 

I turned out the lights and climbed beneath the covers. It took me a while to fall asleep. Partially because my brain wouldn't shut down. That's been a problem since childhood. Even when my body was on the brink of collapse, my mind stayed active. 

But also, I wanted to wait until Edvard had fallen asleep. Not that he would have done anything, not that I didn't feel safe around him, but there was just this feeling I had. I didn't know what it was, but I couldn't allow myself to go to bed until I knew he was asleep first. 

That eventually came when I heard his soft snores sneaking through the dark. Then, and only then, did I close my eyes and relax. 

It probably comes as no surprise that I dreamt of my father that night. I was outside, caught in the middle of an icestorm. There was nothing around me for miles. Empty fields laden with snow. Endless hills rolling in the distance like the gentle peeks of ebbing ocean waves. The sky was pitch-black. No sun, no moon, no stars. Just a blank void of darkness. 

I could hear my father calling out to me. It'd been so long since I heard his voice, but even then, I could tell that it wasn't him. It was a guttural sound. Sharp and grating, but inexplicably, I was convinced that it was my father. The way that dream logic makes no rational sense, but you accept it as fact anyways. 

I followed the voice through the storm until it came from directly beneath me. Then, I fell to my knees and started digging. I didn't have a shovel or gloves or any equipment. So, I dug with my bare hands. 

My fingers went from red to pale blue. My muscles ached and burned. But I kept digging, pushing away mound after mound of snow. I found his corpse buried beneath a thick wall of ice. Arms raised and hands poised as if trying to claw his way out. 

I blinked, and my father was replaced by Edvard. I blinked again, and this time, it was Donovan. Short black hair, and a thin mustache above his upper lip. Skin the color of milk. Then, it was Mia. Long, auburn-red hair and soft green eyes. Mouth partially open as if frozen mid-scream. 

Lifting my fist, I pounded on the ice, cracking the first layer with relative ease but struggling to break through anything deeper than that. 

The wind picked up. Snow pelted me at an incredible speed, dragging across my flesh like the edge of a razor blade. 

When I blinked again, Mia was gone. Instead, it was me beneath the ice. A reflection interspersed by a spiderweb of cracks. 

I awoke with a lump in my throat, wanting to scream but unable. My lips were locked together. I was paralyzed. 

At my bedside, Edvard loomed over me. He had a blank gaze in his eyes, looking without seeing. A lantern absent of light. 

""I am here,"" he said.",1,1737528620.0,ZakBabyTV_Stories,0,1.0,False
1i759dl,https://www.reddit.com/r/DrCreepensVault/comments/1i759dl/theres_something_out_there_underneath_the_ice_pt/,There's Something Out There Underneath the Ice [Pt. 2/3],"The wind ripped at my jacket, pulled at the length of rope connecting me to the plow. 

""Ed,"" I begged, ""we have to go!"" 

This time, he didn't say anything. He just stared at me, a blank look in his eyes. 

""Ed!"" I yelled. ""Nevermind, screw it!""

We didn't have time to stand around talking. Every second out there was another second closer to hypothermia. 

I pulled him away, back towards my Snow Cat. Edvard's feet stumbled against the ground, somewhat walking but mostly dragging. I forced him into the passenger seat of my plow and unhooked myself from the anchor rope. With the click of button, it retracted onto the reel. 

Climbing into the driver's seat, I closed the door and cranked the heat as high as it would go. I was exhausted. Felt as if I'd just finished a marathon. Really, we traveled less than a mile. 

I yanked the goggles off my head and wiped the sweat and tears away before taking hold of the control levers. Then, we started for my cabin. Along the way, I radioed the others to let them know what happened. 

""Is he alright?"" Mia asked. 

""What the hell was he doing?"" said Donovan. 

""I've got him, safe and sound. That's all that matters right now,"" I replied. ""I'll get back to you once were at the cabin."" Then, I turned off the radio to focus on the drive. 

The storm was picking up, smearing the landscape into a swirl of white. Antarctica could be a beautiful place if you ignored the cold. Glittering stretches of open terrain. An endless sky that sometimes was blue as the ocean or red as a fire. Pink in the early morning, maybe a shade of purple late at night with soft tinges of vibrant green. But most of the time, especially in the winter months, it was black. Dark as the bottom of the sea. 

In that moment, I felt a sense of nostalgia for my first week at the research station. Long before I had become inured to the boredom and treacherous nature of the artic. 

In a strange way, perhaps even in a nonsensical, inexplicable way, I had felt like an astronaut. As if I were exploring what few had seen before. A lone lifeform adrift in the barren void of space. Special. Not because of who I was or what I could do, but because of what I was in relation to my environment. An odd entity that existed somewhere it wasn't meant to be. A flower in the desert, a heartbeat amongst the dead. 

That feeling quickly abandoned me during my second or third week. My sense of awe had been combatted by the long hours of nothing, trapped inside my cabin for hours on end. 

My distaste for the artic, for the cold and the snow, came with relative ease. 

""Where are we?"" Edvard asked. 

""We''re heading back to my cabin."" 

He reached up and pulled the fur-lined hood from his head, peeled the goggles from his eyes, tugged the balaclava down around his neck. His cheeks were red; his lips chapped. 

Edvard was a handsome man in his early thirties. Tan skin that had taken a softer tone from his time in the north, time spent away from the sunlight. A hard jawline with cheeks stippled by the makings of a beard. Thick, tangled hair sat on his head. Brown as oakwood. Drenched from sweat and snow into a darker shade than usual. 

The thing I'd noticed about Edvard when we first met were his eyes. Glacial blue and intense. The kind that were easy to get lost in if you weren't careful. Always watching, observing, assessing every minute detail. 

We sometimes joked that he was a reptile because we never saw him blink. And at first, it might seem disquieting, off-putting to the average person, but you quickly adjusted to it, to him, because beneath that severity, beneath that intense gaze was a profound warmth. Kindness. Selflessness. Intellect that went beyond amassed knowledge to a deep, unfathomable grasp of empathy. Of emotions and compassion. 

If it weren't already apparent, I admired Edvard. Found his gentleness, his genuine nature, commendable. Especially during a period of time when society's norms did not always condone such behaviors. 

Furtively, though, I was also envious of him. Jealous to a caustic degree. He had somehow figured out the secret to happiness. Had discovered the path to not only fulfillment, but a level of content that I would never achieve no matter how great my aspirations or achievements. 

To put it simply, I woke up every morning intent on working to earn my paycheck like everybody else. Edvard, though, awoke with the sole purpose of enlightening himself. No grandiose expectations. No incessant grind in search of monetary success. He lived and breathed for the sole purpose of experience. To do the best he could, and at the end of the day, properly acknowledge his efforts regardless of the results. 

Maybe that's why I had been so surprised to hear Edvard say: ""You should've left me out there."" 

""What?"" 

""You should've left me on the ice, out in the storm."" 

""You would've froze. I'm surprised you're still alive, Ed. You'll be lucky if you don't contract anything serious."" 

""I'm already sick."" 

""Probably because you were standing in the middle of a snowstorm! What in God's name were you thinking?"" 

Edvard turned towards me then. That faraway look in his eyes. ""There was someone out there."" 

""You're imagining things. There's no one out here but us."" 

""They're out there!"" 

""No one is out there. The company would've told us if they were bringing anyone in. And as far as I'm aware, the next research station is almost thirty miles away."" 

The cold was making me irritable. I wanted nothing more than to get back, take a warm bath, and drink some hot chocolate. Maybe play another game of chess with Donovan if he was willing to lose again. Or listen to music while watching the snowfall. I was an avid fan of Low Roar. Their music was oddly redolent of the artic. Morbidly beautiful. Haunting and surreal. 

I exhaled my grievances. ""It's just us, Ed."" 

He didn't seem convinced, but he said nothing more of the matter and leaned back in his seat, closing his eyes. ""I've got a headache."" 

""We'll get you some aspirin when we get back."" 

Gently, he massaged his temples as if to work the kinks from his brain. ""Thank you, Emily."" 

I hated when people called me by the wrong name, but Edvard wasn't in a state of mind to be scolded or reprimanded. 

""I'll keep you overnight to monitor your status,"" I said, ""and assuming you haven't developed hypothermia by then, I'll take you back home in the morning. Maybe Donovan will help me retrieve your Snow Cat at some point."" 

Edvard showed no interest in the current subject, and instead, said: ""I had a dream about you last night."" 

I scoffed. ""For both our sakes, don't tell Mia that."" 

""You were dancing at the center of the sun,"" Edvard continued. ""I think you were laughing. Even as the inferno swallowed you whole, you looked as if you were laughing."" 

I blinked. The silence between us swelled, combated only by the sound of the wind as it thrashed the metal exterior of the Snow Cat. 

""Maybe we should just let this be a time of silent reflection,"" I suggested. ""Take a moment to really think before we speak."" 

Surprisingly, this made Edvard laugh. A subtle gradual thing that soon filled the inner cabin of the Snow Cat. 

""If nothing else,"" he said, ""you're funnier than...than me."" 

I shook my head in disbelief. ""Thanks. Glad to see the cabin fever hasn't completely turned you mad."" 

Again, he croaked with laughter. A small, humored chuckle that sat in his throat like the call of a toad. 

""Humor is a good trait to possess,"" he told me. ""From what I have surmised, the general population appreciates good humor over almost anything else. They find it charismatic, endearing."" 

The cold had corroded his brain, left him in a detached state trying to further distance hiself from the trauma he'd endured. From the realization that he had faced the distinct possibility of death not twenty minutes prior. 

I wasn't going to burst that bubble, wasn't going to ruin his method of coping. 

Simply, I told him: ""Ed, I think that is a very astute conclusion."" 

This seemed to invoke some semblance of joy within him. A hint of pride for his meager assessment. And we were able to finish the remainder of our drive in peace. 

When we finally reached my cabin, I killed the Snow Cat's engine and climbed out from the cab. I lagged behind, allowing Edvard to pass me and enter the cabin first, convinced that he might try to run away if I weren't there to block him. 

But now that I was with him, that he was no longer alone with his thoughts, he seemed cooperative, compliant. More so than usual. 

Edvard was the unofficial leader of our little group. The spokesman for the skeleton crew. He ordered our supplies and reported to the company whenever they reached out, which wasn't often since most back at headquarters were away for the holiday. 

He didn't have any real authority, not like our actual superiors. He couldn't orders us about or terminate our positions or anything like that. But he'd been taking on some of the responsibilities the rest of us wished to avoid, and for that, we were all grateful. Maybe that had been affecting him. Maybe that's what had driven him out into the storm. The surmounted pressure and additional stress coupled with the inevitable madness provoked by isolation, by a lack of sunlight and exercise. 

I would've asked him about it, not that he necessarily would've admitted this, but I was bone-cold and exhausted. I didn't want to have a serious conversation then. Didn't want to deal with the burden. I just wanted to call it a night and relax. Handle it in the morning after I had some rest. Or about as close to rest as I could get. 

So, instead of talking, I ran a hot shower and let Edvard wash up first. I threw his clothes into laundry and started cooking tomato soup and grilled cheese sandwiches for dinner. 

Then, I radioed the others to give them an update. They had more questions than I had answers. I told them what little I knew and promised to give any updates if I found out more. An empty promise. 

Edvard was an adult. Fully capable of making his own choices. If he wanted to talk, I was more than willing to listen. But in my mind, the last thing I would have wanted at a time like this was someone else poking and prodding, dissecting my every thought and decision as if I were no more than a hapless child. 

That didn't mean I wasn't going to keep an eye on him. He was in my cabin, and therefore, under my supervision. Until I felt comfortable enough with his current state of well-being, I wasn't going to let him leave. 

Some people might think I was being completely ignorant or stupid, and maybe I was to some degree, but I would tell those people you weren't there. You don't know Edvard like I do. Not that we're exactly close, but we've all been working together for the better part of a year. Forced to spend almost every day within close proximity. 

It's not like we just clocked out at the end of the workday. Not like we could go to the bar on the weekends. If we wanted to socialize, it was with each other. If we wanted to play games or share a drink or have a movie night, there were only so many people we could do that with. Friendship or not, we were victims of circumstance. Animals sharing the same exhibit. 

You either learned to appreciate the company of the other twenty-five individuals around you, or you spent all your time locked inside your cabin slowly losing your mind. 

At this point, I'd had more conversations with Edvard or Donovan or Mia or any of the other twenty-three analysts than I'd had with my actual friends, possibly even certain members of my family. We were more than familiar with each other. 

Edvard was whimsical, but he wasn't an idiot. He wasn't crazy or insane or anything like that. He was fully self-aware, more cognizant than ninety percent of the people I'd encountered throughout my life. And from what I could tell, he didn't seem depressed. Wasn't displaying negative behavior to lead me to suspect that he had gone out into the storm with the intention of dying. 

Still, despite my rationality, he had gone out there for a reason. There was an intention. 

""I don't know,"" he had admitted between bites of his grilled cheese. About half of his tomato soup still remained, wafting little streams of mist into the air. ""I just...I really thought someone was out there. I would've put all my money on it. Every last dollar."" 

""And your first instinct was to go after them?"" I said. 

""I didn't want them to freeze."" He took another bite and chewed. ""I mean, didn't you do the same thing for me?"" 

""That's different. I was almost certain you were out there. The transmitter even said so."" 

""Still. There was a slight chance that I wasn't."" 

""I guess."" 

""But you went out there anyway."" 

""Alright, Ed, you've convinced me. Next time I notice you're miles from your cabin in the middle of a snowstorm, I'll just leave you be."" 

He laughed. ""That's not what I'm getting at."" 

""What are you getting at then?"" 

He contemplated this as he chewed, going back and forth between his sandwich and soup until neither remained. 

""Human nature is self-destructive at its core,"" he finally said. ""They're...we're...it's practically intrinsic to do anything in our power to help another member of the species without any regard for our own well-being."" 

I looked at him for a long time without saying anything. Bemused by his statement, stupefied even. Then, when I did speak, I told him: ""You have severely misinterpreted human nature if that's what you believe."" 

""Oh?"" He seemed disappointed. ""Is that so? Enlighten me then."" 

""Gladly."" I set my sandwich on the plate and leaned back in my seat. ""Have I ever told you about my father?"" 

He wracked his brain for a memory that I already knew didn't exist. 

""He was a good person,"" I explained. ""Served in the army for about seven and a half years. Honorably discharged due to mental concerns. Spent the rest of his life working minimum wage at a steel mill during the week. Nighttime security gigs at a bar downtown on the weekends. 

""One day,"" I told him, ""he just dies. Heart failure. No warnings really. He was overweight and had been a smoker in his younger days, but other than that, fit as a fiddle."" 

""Okay?"" 

""Well, we didn't have much money growing up. We were just above the poverty line. So, as you might imagine, we struggled to pay the funeral charges. It's expensive to properly dispose of a body. Whether you cremate or bury."" 

""What did you do?"" 

""We went to the VA, but they weren't going to cover it. Started a fundraiser, online and in-person. That helped. People donated, more than I expected, but at the end of the day, my family was stuck with a substantial bill. One that we are still paying, and it's been almost three years."" 

Edvard frowned. ""I'm not fully grasping--"" 

""The point is, there are good people and bad people. Two sides to every coin. But self-destructive, in a selfess sacrificial way, I don't think so."" I pushed my plate away. My appetite had abandoned me. ""There's a reason humanity still exists while other species go extinct. We're hard-wired for survival. Our sense of self-preservation is greater than our innate emotional response to the condition of others."" 

""You think people should have donated more? Until they had nothing left to give?"" 

""Not at all. I don't hold a grudge, I don't have any grievances. Hell, I'd probably do the same thing they did in given circumstances. But if our empathy is as great as you want to believe, we wouldn't have struggled in the least to pay for my father's funeral. There wouldn't be homelessness or poverty or starving nations. Society wouldn't completely break at the first sight of a pandemic. But these things do exist, they happen because we're self-centered...most of us, at least. We worry about number one and hope number two or three or four never come knocking on our door in search of help."" 

""Then why did you come out looking for...me?"" 

""I don't know. I just couldn't stand the idea of a coworker--a friend, being out there. Left alone like that."" 

""Maybe you don't give the human race enough credit."" 

""Or maybe I'm just an idiot lacking the necessity for self-preservation."" 

""I'mnot entirely convinced."" He smiled then. A gentle pull at the corner of his lips. ""I possess enough knowledge, sufficient memories and experience to know that humanity can be full of destruction and hostility, but there's still compassion out there. Enough altruism to deem worthwhile. It's a species worth protecting, one worth being apart of. Don't you think?"" 

I scoffed. The conversation was absurd, but the question itself was beyond ridiculous. Not exactly what I expected from that night. 

It was commonplace to discuss politics or literature. Pop culture and movies. Weekend plans or outings with the family. The sanctity of humanity, the value of society, that just wasn't a popular topic. 

""I think it's getting late,"" I said. ""I think we're too tired to be discussing ethical dilemmas or analyzing human nature."" 

He put his hands up in surrender. ""Alright, fine. But let me ask you one last thing, and I'll leave it alone: what makes a person? What standards qualify someone as a human being?"" 

""Easy, they know when to drop a conversation."" I retrieved my dishes and carried them over to the sink. ""Looks like you've still got some learning to do."" 

""I guess so."" 

We cleaned up after dinner. I washed and he dried. Then, while Edvard looked through my collection of books and board games, I took a shower. The water was warm and thawed the cold from my body, melted away the stress that had pulled my muscles taut. Helped clear the fuzz from my mind. 

When I stepped out, I found Edvard waiting for me in the doorway of the bathroom. I don't know how long he'd been there, but the moment caught us both by surprise. 

""What the hell are you doing?"" I remarked. 

He lifted his hand, holding up a book for me to see, a casual expression across his face as if I hadn't caught him watching me shower. It might sound stupid, but his nonchalance made any internal alarms go silent. As if it were a misunderstanding. Bad timing kind of scenario. 

""Can I borrow this?"" he asked, holding out my father's copy of Thomas Ligotti's 'The Conspiracy Against the Human Race' on display. 

""Uh...sure."" I waited a moment, towel wrapped around my body, before asking: ""You mind getting out so I can change?"" 

He frowned. A reddish hue flooded his cheeks. ""Right, sorry. Yeah. Just one of those days."" He backed out of the bathroom. ""Again, sorry. Completely inappropriate of me."" 

Once the door was closed, I swapped my towel for a pair of checkered pajama bottoms and a plain gray sweatshirt. Cotton polymer that was softer than any pillow or cloud in existence. 

The small things in life are sometimes the most fruitful. Little pleasures to make the rest no more than a distant memory. That greasy fast food takeout after a long day at work. That cup of coco after spending the morning shoveling your driveway. A tub of cookie dough ice cream after getting dumped by the only girl you ever loved. Brief moments of reprieve from reality. Distractions to keep your sanity intact. Comfort in the simplest form. 

When I came out of the bathroom, I found Edvard sitting on the couch reading my father's book. He glanced at me and offered a soft smile. A strange way to clear the air, but for the life of me, I couldn't think of a better alternative. I'm sure one existed, but at the time, I was still in an awkward mindset of whether I should be upset, pissed, ashamed, or mortified. 

""I'm going to put the kettle on,"" I said. ""You want a cup of tea?"" 

""Tea?"" 

""Crushed leaves and hot water."" 

He chuckled. ""I know what tea is..."" He pondered a moment. ""Is it any good?"" 

""You've never had tea before?"" 

""No, yeah, I have, but what kind?"" 

""I've got Sleepytime Vanilla, peppermint, and Throat Coat."" I checked the cabinet. ""I've also got homebrew coffee and hot chocolate with marshmallows."" 

The variety in choice seemed to confuse him. ""Uh..."" 

""Is that an answer?"" 

Again, that warm, crooked smile. ""You know better than me. I'll let you decide."" 

I filled the kettle with water and set it on the burner. Then, I went to my rig to perform the nightly check in. 

Mia was getting ready for bed. It seemed a little early, but lately, she'd been laying in bed for hours on end, unable to fall asleep. Her theory was that if she lay down around eight or nine at night, she might be asleep by ten or eleven. 

Donovan was in the middle of a Studio Ghibli marathon. He'd been watching 'Nausicaa of the Valley of the Wind' when I radioed in. For those that don't know Donovan, the last thing you wanted to do was interrupt him during a movie. 

So, I skipped the niceties and any attempt at conversation. Told them I would check back in the morning. I wanted to mention Edvard, talk about the way he was acting, the things he'd been saying, but like with Donovan and Oscar, it was hard to broach the matter with him in the same room, listening to our conversation. 

After recording temperatures, weather conditions, and seismic activity, I muted my systems and grabbed the kettle from the stove. I poured a cup of Sleeptyime Vanilla for myself and Throat Coat for Edvard. 

When I came into the living room, Edvard dog-eared his current page and looked up at me. ""Can I ask you something?"" 

""Depends,"" I said, ""what's it about?"" 

""You're father."" 

""You can ask, but I can't promise to give an answer."" 

""Fair enough, all things considered."" 

I set the cup of Throat Coat on the coffee table in front of him and took a seat in my desk chair at the other end of the room. 

""Alright, shoot,"" I said. 

""Shoot?"" 

""Figure of speech, Ed. Never knew you to be so literal."" 

He tittered and shrugged helplessly. ""Like I said, weird day. Feeling a bit off. Like I've just awoken from a dream."" 

""I know that feeling. Sort of like deja vu."" 

His brow knitted with uncertainty. ""I guess so, yeah."" He set the book on the cushion beside him and took his mug by the handle, lifting it to his lips. 

""Wiat a minute, that's--"" 

But he was already gulping it down. Wisps of steam masked his face as he emptied the mug. Then, he set it back on the coffee table and exhaled. 

""Nevermind,"" I muttered. ""Guess you don't really need tastebuds anyway."" 

I blew on my coco before taking a drink. I don't know how he didn't react because I practically scorched the interior of my mouth with just one sip. 

""Anyways,"" I said, stifling a yelp, ""you had a question about my father?"" 

""Right. I was going to ask if you missed him."" 

""Of course. It'd be a crime not to."" 

""Would it?"" 

""Another figure of speech, Ed. Seriously, whats going on with you?"" 

""No, no. I understand. I just mean, what if I didn't miss my own father."" 

""I wasn't aware your father had passed."" 

He pursed his lips, forming a firm line across his mouth. ""Both of my parents...actually
They...uh...they died in a car accident."" 

I couldn't help the shocked expression on my face. Edvard was so vibrant and optimistic. Hard to imagine he had ever experienced any serious trauma. But that's just the way some people coped. Turn to the positive and leave the past behind. Let your shadow follow at your heels instead of plaguing your mind. 

""I don't really feel much of anything about their deaths,"" he confessed. ""Shouldn't I, though?"" 

""Well, when did it happen?"" 

""I was a child. They were coming back from a date, and I was stuck at home with the babysitter. A young neighbor girl from across the hall. 

""I remember hearing the police sirens from down the road,"" he recalled. ""When I looked out the window, I could see the lights flashing in the distance. I felt...helpless. Trapped. I don't know how I knew it was them, I just did. But now, I don't feel anything. It's like I'm watching that moment on TV. Like it was someone else's life."" 

""I'm not a psychologist, but it sounds like you're still in shock."" 

He shook his head. ""No. I remember being in shock at the time. I don't know what this is."" 

""You can be in shock more than once. Some realities take years to set in. It's not like you experience it once and it's done. These things come in waves. 

""Some days..."" I paused, wondering if this was something I wanted to share with him. Something I wanted to share with anybody. ""Some days, I get up and get out of bed like anybody else. I feel fine, normal. Just go through the motions and that's that. But then there are days when I might hear a certain song or watch a certain movie or read a certain book, and it feels like I've lost my father for the first time again. Like I'm back in that moment when my brother called to tell me..."" 

Edvard stared at me, wide-eyed and completely enthralled. As if we were sharing ghost stories around the campfire. 

""It comes and goes,"" I finished. ""You don't ever stop grieving, you just learn to carry that weight. To manage it so that it doesn't crush you."" 

""What if you could forget it?"" he asked. ""Lose those memories. Would you?"" 

That was a tough question. Well, I suppose the question itself wasn't harder than any other question, but the answer was complicated. Difficult to put into words, to explain outside of just feeling it. 

""I'm not sure, honestly,"" I said. ""I mean, that's why people drink or smoke or whatever. Because they want to distract themselves, want to forget their pain. But I don't think you can. Not without causing more issues for yourself."" 

""You'll have to expound on that a little more for me."" 

""Life isn't a steak,"" I explained. ""You can't just cut away the fatty bits. I wish you could, and I suppose some people really do try, but in my experience, it just doesn't work like that. It's a package deal. You get the good with the bad. Trying to eliminate that, to cut out the parts you don't like, it'll hurt you as a person. It would completely erase any tolerance for pain and leave you with unrealistic expectations. You wouldn't really be yourself if you removed the memories you didn't want."" 

""To suffer is a better alternative?"" 

""To suffer is to be human. Just like with love and hate, joy and anger. We have to experience all those emotions at some point or another, otherwise we become blind to reality."" 

He seemed enthralled by this notion. Completely absorbed by the topic at hand. 

""But I get where you're coming from,"" I admitted. ""I've been there. So overwhelmed by your grief that you almost finding yourself wishing you don't exist. That you weren't real because then, you wouldn't have to feel anything at all. All that heartbreak, all that confusion and madness just fades away if you aren't there to indulge it. It becomes illusory."" 

Edvard leaned back, resting his chin in between his forefinger and thumb. ""Interesting..."" 

""It's been a long day,"" I told him. ""Let's just call it an early night. Try to get some sleep and clear our heads."" 

Silently, he nodded. 

I retrieved an extra set of pillows and blankets from the closet. I offered to sleep on the couch, but Edvard refused. He'd already taken the better half of my day with his antics. He didn't want to put me out any further by taking my bed. I was too tired to argue. 

I turned out the lights and climbed beneath the covers. It took me a while to fall asleep. Partially because my brain wouldn't shut down. That's been a problem since childhood. Even when my body was on the brink of collapse, my mind stayed active. 

But also, I wanted to wait until Edvard had fallen asleep. Not that he would have done anything, not that I didn't feel safe around him, but there was just this feeling I had. I didn't know what it was, but I couldn't allow myself to go to bed until I knew he was asleep first. 

That eventually came when I heard his soft snores sneaking through the dark. Then, and only then, did I close my eyes and relax. 

It probably comes as no surprise that I dreamt of my father that night. I was outside, caught in the middle of an icestorm. There was nothing around me for miles. Empty fields laden with snow. Endless hills rolling in the distance like the gentle peeks of ebbing ocean waves. The sky was pitch-black. No sun, no moon, no stars. Just a blank void of darkness. 

I could hear my father calling out to me. It'd been so long since I heard his voice, but even then, I could tell that it wasn't him. It was a guttural sound. Sharp and grating, but inexplicably, I was convinced that it was my father. The way that dream logic makes no rational sense, but you accept it as fact anyways. 

I followed the voice through the storm until it came from directly beneath me. Then, I fell to my knees and started digging. I didn't have a shovel or gloves or any equipment. So, I dug with my bare hands. 

My fingers went from red to pale blue. My muscles ached and burned. But I kept digging, pushing away mound after mound of snow. I found his corpse buried beneath a thick wall of ice. Arms raised and hands poised as if trying to claw his way out. 

I blinked, and my father was replaced by Edvard. I blinked again, and this time, it was Donovan. Short black hair, and a thin mustache above his upper lip. Skin the color of milk. Then, it was Mia. Long, auburn-red hair and soft green eyes. Mouth partially open as if frozen mid-scream. 

Lifting my fist, I pounded on the ice, cracking the first layer with relative ease but struggling to break through anything deeper than that. 

The wind picked up. Snow pelted me at an incredible speed, dragging across my flesh like the edge of a razor blade. 

When I blinked again, Mia was gone. Instead, it was me beneath the ice. A reflection interspersed by a spiderweb of cracks. 

I awoke with a lump in my throat, wanting to scream but unable. My lips were locked together. I was paralyzed. 

At my bedside, Edvard loomed over me. He had a blank gaze in his eyes, looking without seeing. A lantern absent of light. 

""I am here,"" he said.",1,1737528575.0,DrCreepensVault,0,1.0,False

1i75643,https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/1i75643/theres_something_in_my_grandmas_house/,There’s Something in my Grandma’s House,"I spend most of my waking hours caring for my elderly grandmother, who suffers from Alzheimer's disease, which has taken increasingly more and more from her.

I dont do anything requiring advanced medical knowledge. A nurse comes by the house twice a week to help with that sort of stuff. I have zero medical training other than a CPR course I took a few months ago in case of an emergency, but something tells me that I am already forgetting the basics with each passing day.

I dont mind taking care of her. My grandma took me in when I was 11 years old after my father and mother split. Neither of them really wanted a child. 

That was evident from the beginning. I think my mother loved me, but she was never fit to raise a kid, and she knew it. My father, on the other hand, was never fit to be around children, let alone take care of one himself. He was always in and out of jail.

Before my grandmother took me in, my fondest childhood memories were when my dad was doing time. Things weren't so bad when it was just my mother and me. But whenever he returned from his imprisonment, things would always end up falling apart again. When my parents finally did divorce, I was about as dejected as a child could be. The bright beam of childhood innocence had long since faded from my eyes.

That all changed when I went to live with my grandma. Her house was clean and big and had an acre of land. I had a room to myself and more than two changes of clothes. I thought we must have been rich.

Raising me increased her financial burden, but she never let it show on her face. That woman always had a smile on. I wish that smile would come back. Ever since the disease started taking a firm hold on her, she mostly just stares. 

She allows me to take care of her on the good days, and we spend quality time enjoying novels and her black-and-white TV shows. On the bad days, she won't let me help at all. I dont quite understand what sets her off, but some days she wakes up paranoid and scared.

**Day 1: Sunday**

My alarm went off at 5:55 AM. What the hell? I thought. I always set my alarm for 9:00 AM. Although many old people enjoy waking up earlier than the sun, my grandma will sleep all day if I let her. I usually start my day at 9:00, get myself ready, make breakfast, and then get grandma out of bed around 10:00.

So why was my alarm going off at 5:55? I turned it off and rolled over, trying to fall back asleep. But before I could, I heard a crash from upstairs. I live in the basement, and Grandma lives in the master bedroom on the main floor. I rushed out of my room and up the stairs as quickly as possible.

Was Grandma hurt? Did she fall? What was she doing out of bed? My mind was racing. When I reached the top of the stairs, I expected to see my grandmother somewhere on the floor, but instead, I saw an empty living room. 

The sun hadn't come up yet, making the room barely visible. I peered into the master bedroom and found Grandma still fast asleep. I closed the door slowly, trying not to wake her. With Grandma safe in her room, I decided to check the house to see if I could locate the source of the crashing sound. The kitchen looked normal, except for a knife in the sink, which I was pretty sure I had cleaned and put away the night before.

Next, I checked the living room and found a book on the floor. I keep the house pretty tidy so that Grandma doesn't trip over anything, so it was definitely odd to find the book in the middle of the room. I picked it up and opened it. It was a scrapbook. One of the many my grandmother had put together over the years. 

This one mainly consisted of photos of my mother when she was young. Closing the book, I walked a few feet to the bookshelf and returned it, where dust had revealed its usual resting place.

I still felt a little groggy, and with my tired mind, I rationalized that my grandma had been looking at it earlier and left it on the floor without me realizing it. That's the thing about the human mind. We will do anything to rationalize the unexplainable.

Remembering it was still early and I had about 3 hours before I needed to get on with my day, I snuck out of the house for a quick run. I don’t typically leave my grandmother unattended, but she wouldn't wake up for a while, and it was nice to get some time to myself. I returned to the house half an hour later.

Stepping into the bathroom, I got a text from my girlfriend, Jane. She works at a bakery and always texts me when she heads off to work, though I usually dont reply for a couple of hours because, like I said before, I'm never up this early. 

The text read, “Good Morning Paul! I'm leaving for work, but maybe I can swing by later and hang out for a bit?”

I smiled and decided I'd surprise her by texting back immediately, “Have fun at work! I love you!”

 “Wow! You're up early!” she replied. 

“Yeah, I got woken up by a loud noise and decided to get a jump start on my day.” I left out the part about my alarm going off 3 hours early.

When it was time to wake up Grandma, I went into her bedroom softly and turned on the light, but to my surprise, Grandma was already awake. She sat at the foot of her bed staring at me, not with her usual blank stare, but a fearful one.

“Hey, Grandma, what's wrong?” I asked.

She didn't reply. She just kept staring at me. I decided to give her some privacy after making sure she was safe. 

I went to the kitchen to make some breakfast. As I glanced into the sink, ready to wash the knife I had forgotten about the night before, it was gone. I figured I was tired when I noticed it earlier and was probably mistaken. 

There is a window above the kitchen sink, which gives a beautiful view of the lawn. As I stared out, a bluebird flew by and rested on the back porch. The beautiful bird looked almost out of place in our little backyard. I had never seen a bird like it in our area.

When I turned around, I almost jumped out of my skin to see my Grandmother an inch from my face.

“Geez, Grandma!” My fear quickly turned to laughter as I chuckled, “Granny, you nearly scared me half to death! Are you feeling any better?” She still had that scared and angry look on her face. It was almost as if… “Hey, grandma…” I said nervously. “You know who I am, right? It's me, Paul. Your grandson.” 

Quietly, she said without taking her eyes off me, “There's someone in the house.”

A feeling of awful guilt spread over me as I told her, “No, Grandma, you know me. I live here with you, remember?” Her anger turned to disappointment. 

She leaned closer to my face and, in a hushed tone, whispered, “No, Paul. I know who you are. I am telling you that there is someone in our house.”

My heart sank, and the guilty pit in my stomach became a sinkhole of fear. “Where?! Grandma, where did you see this person? My God, are they still here?” I instantly believed her, as I always have, but then, for a moment, I thought, Is this the disease? Is she seeing things now? I didn’t remember the doctor saying anything about hallucinations. 

I pushed the thoughts out of my head. I reached for my phone to dial 911, but grandma put her hand on mine before I could unlock it. 

“He's in my room.” She said it almost as if it was an afterthought.

My heart raced, and without thinking, I picked her up and shuffled towards the front door. Once outside, I sat her on the porch bench. “Stay here,” I said. She wasn't looking me in the eyes. 

I rushed back into the house and to her bedroom. The door was shut. I went to reach for the handle, but I stopped. 

Adrenaline had gotten me this far, but it seemed to run dry when it came time to investigate. What would I even do if I found someone in there? I thought. But I needed to make sure that we were safe.

I slowly turned the knob and pushed my way inside. Everything looked normal, other than a bit of clutter. Hadn't I picked up her room the night before? I checked everywhere, but there was no sign of anyone. 

I felt relieved and almost smiled at how worked up I'd been. That feeling soon left me as I remembered the master bathroom with its door still shut. I flung the door open, but what I saw didn't scare me. It was confusing. The walls, the mirror, the floor, all of it. It was all covered in a black sludge. 

The smell reminded me of the many hot summer days I spent walking the empty road as a kid. It was the smell of tar and tobacco. After standing in shock for what must have been minutes, I checked the rest of the house but found nothing.

I walked outside to find Grandma still on the bench. Her attention had turned to a small pile of ants on the concrete. “Hey, Grandma, I checked the house. There's no one there.” She didn't reply. 

“Did something happen in the bathroom? What is all that stuff?” Still no reply. I wasn't totally convinced that there had been an intruder, but I also wasn't totally convinced my Grandma had made the mess herself. 

The rest of the day passed by quickly. Grandma hadn't said a word to me since the incident, but honestly, I didn't really have time for conversation anyway. Cleaning the sludge was nearly impossible. 

It took me well into the afternoon to clear away the black stain. The tar was warm to the touch initially but soon completely dried, making it hard and resistant to my efforts.

I didn't even realize what time it was when I heard a knock at the door. Jane! I ran to the door and opened it to see her face beaming at me. 

“Jane! I am so sorry I forgot you were coming over.” 

She looked disappointed, “Oh, sorry. Do you want me to leave? I should have texted to remind you I was coming.” 

“No! Please come in. I'm sorry. I just feel bad that I haven't showered or made dinner or anything. I've been so busy today. 

“How's Grandma doing?” she asked. 

“It's been a bad day for her today.” She knew what I meant. I had often confided in her about Grandma’s previous “bad days,” she knew from interacting with Grandma how quiet and off she could seem when her mind wasn't at its best. 

“Aw, Granny,” she said, turning a sympathetic face to Grandma. She really did love my grandma.

We ordered Chinese food, and I told Jane about the day's events. “That's so weird!” she said between bites of orange chicken. “Where do you think she got the black stuff?” 

“I dont know. I'm not even 100 percent sure it was her. I mean, who knows, maybe someone was in our house. I did notice a few things out of place.”

We sat silently for a few seconds. We turned our attention to the black and white film we had put on for Grandma, and soon, the night started to feel like any other. When the movie ended, I tucked Grandma into bed. Jane and I turned on a show with actual color and cuddled on the couch.

**Day 2: Monday**

My alarm woke me up at 5:55 AM. I looked at my phone, puzzled that it had happened twice. Before I had time to go back to bed, a loud bang from upstairs startled me. I was on my feet in an instant. 

This sound was much louder than the one the day before. I barreled up the stairs and peered into Grandma’s room. She was asleep. Stepping back into the living room, I found the same scrapbook on the floor.

I started turning on all the lights. Once the room was well-lit, I opened the scrapbook. A sinister feeling crept into my bones as I flipped through page after page. Every picture that included my mother had been ruined, her face cut from each photo. 

I called the police, and the operator said they would be there as soon as possible. I was convinced that there had been someone in the house. While waiting for the police, I woke up Grandma and walked her out to my car, where she sat while I looked the house over. In the 6 minutes it took for the police to arrive, I noticed a drawer open in the kitchen. I also found more black goo in the garage. 

The police walked through the house, checking every place a person could hide. They didn't find anyone and there was no evidence of forced entry. 

“Sounds like someone might be looking to hurt your mom, seeing as her face was cut out of all the pictures.” said the officer. 

“Well, if someone had it out for her, they had the wrong house. We haven't seen her in nearly 17 years.” I replied. The officers offered to check up on us later tonight to make sure there wasn't anyone lurking around the property and said to call again if there were any further disturbances. 

“Thanks, officers,” I said. I ushered Grandma back into the house as they pulled out of the driveway. 

“You alright, Grandma?” I asked. No response. We stepped into the living room, and I was helping her sit on the couch when I noticed something out of the corner of my eye. I turned to face the kitchen window. That same bluebird from the day before was staring right at me. 

The bird was so beautiful, but looking at it, I couldn't help but feel like I was in some sort of danger. Like a bad omen. It continued to stare for a few moments and then flew away. 

The day dragged on. Grandma hadn't said a word; worse, she hadn't even looked me in the eyes. I was worried.

The sun dipped over the horizon, and suddenly, it was night. Time to put Grandma to bed. As I helped her get comfortable, she looked at me. It was a welcomed surprise, and I smiled at her, but she didn't smile back. 

She only whispered the words, “Someone is in the kitchen.”

Ice went down my spine. “What? Grandma, we were both just in there, and I didn't see anybody.” She looked terrified. Obviously, my words were of no comfort to her. 

She just repeated, “In the kitchen…the kitchen…kitchen.” Then she rolled over, closed her eyes, and stopped speaking. She was really starting to make me worried, and I really couldn't decide whether to believe her or not.

I left the room and headed for the kitchen. Upon arrival, I didn't notice anything out of the ordinary right away. Other than the drawer with the bags and wrap. It was open again. I turned to walk out and turned the light off, but the room didn't get dark. 

I flicked the switch on and off, but the room remained illuminated. In fact, it was getting brighter. Panicked, I did the first thing that came to my mind and reached for the big knife in the knife block, but I froze when I noticed the knife block was empty. Sweat washed over me, and I saw all the knives in the sink. 

The room continued to illuminate brighter and brighter as I dashed for a knife and cut myself on one of the smaller blades before finally grabbing hold of the bread knife. My attention briefly turned to my bloody hand as I attempted to wrap a rag around the wound. 

Just then, the room went completely quiet, and I saw it. A large figure, maybe 8 feet tall. The creature was completely naked except for a plastic film - plastic wrap, covering it from head to toe. The light emanating from the figure seemed to give me tunnel vision, blurring my surroundings. I couldn't make out the face, as it was completely masked in the plastic wrapping, but there was a protrusion where the nose was underneath. 

Petrified, I felt my blood run cold. I was so scared that I was physically unable to move. The dread filled me like molasses in a glass, slowing my thoughts. I dropped the knife, which crashed to the tile floor with a metallic clang. 

I wanted to run, but my legs felt like stone. I stared in horror at the bright monster, and just when I thought it might attack, it began to speak.

“Fear not, sweet boy,” its voice sounded frail and weak as if trying to convince me I was safe. It reminded me how an old person might talk to a child, almost mimicking their innocent tone. It continued to speak, “Sweet Paul. Sweet…Paul.” 

“Who are you?” I managed to say in a shaky voice. 

“Sweet Paul, I am your guardian angel. Your guide in the darkness. Your friend from above.” I wasn’t convinced. An angel? This thing looked demonic. It was the stuff of my nightmares. 

“Okay…well, I’m good, actually. I don’t need a guardian angel.” The angel began breathing heavily, and in a much deeper voice than before, it said, 

“Yes, my sweet boy. You do.” Just then, the knives in the sink flew straight up in the air and stuck into the ceiling. The noise startled me, and I turned to see the knives dangling. With my eyes briefly off the creature, I immediately heard footsteps running toward me. 

I screamed and turned back to face the monster. Raising my arms to shield my face, I braced for impact, but…it never came. 

I opened my eyes to a dark, empty room. It was gone, and I was all alone. I quickly flipped on the light and grabbed my phone to call Jane. It went straight to voicemail. 

She must have been asleep. With no one to talk to, I paced around my room until exhaustion took its toll, and I went to bed.

**Day 3: Tuesday**

The next day, my alarm went off at 5:55 AM. This time, I was ready. I bolted up the stairs before any noise alerted me to action, hoping to catch the creature who had been terrorizing us. I started my investigation by checking on Grandma. 

Asleep. Good, I thought as I shut the door and turned my attention to the rest of the house. The first thing I noticed was the scrapbook on the floor, with its pages torn out and strewn across the floor. I needed to clean that up before my grandmother had a chance to see the pitiful state of her treasured photo album, but that would have to wait until I scoured the rest of the house. 

Next, I went to the kitchen. Nothing looked too out of the ordinary, but I noticed that one knife remained stuck to the ceiling while the rest had fallen to the ground. I was about to check the rest of the house when I heard a loud slam coming from the basement. 

The noise was louder than the previous days, and I was sure it had woken Grandma, so I decided to check on her again before investigating. Just as I suspected, Grandma was sitting upright when I walked through the door. She hadn't turned to look at me when I walked in. 

“You okay, Grandma?” I asked. I wasn't expecting a response since she had been nearly mute the past few days. Despite my expectations, she answered immediately. 

“It's okay, Paul. They can't hurt us today. Hank will protect us.” Hank was the name of my grandfather, who had been dead for over 20 years. I didn't have the heart to remind her of his passing, so I said nothing and walked towards the stairs. As I took the first step down, the loud banging noise repeated, sending a chill down my spine. 

I went to take the next step but stood frozen for several seconds. I managed to break through my terror and continue my plunge to the basement. Other than my room, there are two other rooms downstairs. A guest bedroom and a family room which had slowly morphed into my personal mancave over the years. 

The sound happened a third time, and it was clearing coming from the family room. I peeked my head through the door but quickly shot back behind the wall. I had expected to see my not-so-angelic guardian angel, but crouched in the middle of the room was something far worse. 

It was bigger than the angel, maybe 10 feet tall. It had to slouch just to fit in the room. Instead of light, the creature emanated a blinding darkness, which seemed to be battling for space with the soft light of the moon coming through the window. Its hands were disproportionally large for its body, with long bony fingers. 

The most notable characteristic of the monster was what was covering its body. From head to toe, the creature was soaked in hot black sludge, which dripped down to the floor. The chemical smell was overwhelmingly potent, and I found myself struggling not to gag as I sat still and listened to the beast breathe. 

I shifted my weight, preparing to take another look. Before I could peer around the corner, the monster screamed, which sounded like the mix of a man and a dog. I booked it to the staircase, looking behind me, only to watch as the creature tumbled toward me with impressive speed. 

I reached the top of the stairs and almost ran for the front door when I remembered Grandma, who was still in her room. Thinking quickly, I leaped behind the island counter in the middle of the kitchen and hid myself, trying to make as little sound as I could. I heard the tar monster reach the top of the stairs and pause. Thankfully, it didn't know where I was, but soon began searching for me. 

I caught a glimpse of it as its back was turned to me, and I noticed it was carrying something large. Is that…a rug? I thought to myself. Then I recognized it. The thing was carrying my rug from underneath my coffee table. 

What on earth does it want with that? I turned my attention back to my hiding place and scanned for a weapon. As my eyes darted around the kitchen, I became transfixed on the window, or rather what was behind the window. A little blue bird. 

Just then, I heard something crash against the floor, and I spun around. The creature was gone, and my rug lay rolled up in the living room. The rest of the day felt foggy. My head was aching, and no amount of acetaminophen could dull the throbbing. 

Grandma stayed in her room, not letting me in other than to bring her meals and make sure she was taking her medication. By the time night rolled around, I was ready to call it a day, but Jane came over for dinner, and her contagious, unending energy started to rub off on me. 

“So what did you do today? Find any more objects in weird places?” she asked innocently. 

I had almost forgotten that I hadn't told her about the bizarre monsters I'd been seeing. I thought about keeping it to myself, but I could never lie to her. We had been friends since elementary school and together since high school. She was the one person on earth I expected to believe my story. 

So I told her about the Tar Monster and the Plastic Angel from the night before. When I finished, she stared at me with her jaw open. 

“Oh my goodness, Paul…this is just like that show Ghost Adventure or something!” she had a huge smile on her face, which was not the reaction I was expecting. 

“Um…maybe not just like Ghost Adventures, but it is pretty freaky,” I said. 

“We should like set up some cameras and catch them the next time they appear! We could be like famous or something.” she really did seem genuinely excited about the idea. 

“I'd like to see how excited you are when they appear in your kitchen.” I shot back, now smiling myself. 

“It's okay, Paul, I'll stay the night to protect you.” she offered. 

“Dont you work in the morning?” I asked. 

“Nope! We’re closed tomorrow, silly.""

I didn't say it, but I was actually extremely relieved to not have to spend the night alone. I started to get seriously terrified of my own home. “Well, it’s settled then.” I told her, “You can deal with the big evil monsters, and I will get some much-needed beauty sleep.” 

The rest of the night actually felt normal. We watched a horror movie at Jane’s request (what is it with her and this spooky shit?) and went to bed. 

I had this really weird dream that night about my mom. In the dream, I was young, maybe 7 or 8, and was helping her mop the kitchen. She showed me how to fill the bucket with water and how much cleaner to pour in. She handed me the mop and said, “Give it a try!”

I was so eager to help I nearly tripped over the mop as I swished it from side to side. We were cleaning up something wet, and I figured maybe I had spilled some grape soda again. “And then you dip it into the water again,” she told me. I plunged the mop into the bucket and was about to pull it back out when I saw the water turn a light red color. 

Confused, I looked at the ground I had just mopped and was horrified to see that the liquid I had been smearing around the tile was a thick, shimmering pool of blood. I screamed and looked up at my mother for her to comfort me, but I stumbled backward over the bucket when I saw her. As I lay soaked in soap, water, and blood, I watched my mom stare at me with the biggest smile. Her head was bleeding. 

I shot up in bed, free from the nightmare. I must have been gasping for air because Jane sat up as well and started rubbing my back. 

“Hey, hey! What's the matter?” she asked. 

Catching my breath, I started to laugh a bit as I said, “I just had the weirdest, most morbid dream of my life. I was a kid, and my mom was letting me help with chores, but she was bleeding everywhere, and I think that she was going to die.” 

Jane continued to comfort me, and said, “That is weird. Your mom is fine though right? I mean as far as we know?” 

To be honest, I wasn't sure how my mom was doing. The last time I saw her was just before she went to rehab when I was 8. From that time forward, I only communicated with her through letters. When I was 13, the letters stopped. “I'm sure she’s okay,” I said, more to reassure myself than Jane. 

We went back to sleep, and I didn't have any more dreams that night. 

**Day 4: Wednesday**

My alarm woke Jane and me up at 5:55 AM. 

“Why did you set the alarm so early?” she asked, pulling a pillow over her ears. 

I turned off the alarm. “I didn't set it. It's just been doing that. There should be a loud sound, kind of like banging, in a minute or two.” We sat in complete silence, waiting for something to happen. 

About 10 minutes passed, and I started to feel relieved. “Maybe nothing will happen today,” I said. Moments later, we heard a scream coming from upstairs. 

“Granny!” Jane shouted as the two of us sprang into action. I stumbled on the stairs but recovered quickly as I bear-crawled the rest of my way up with tremendous speed. When I reached Grandma’s door, Jane was close behind me. I burst through the door and looked side to side for my grandmother. 

She was gone. I ran to her bed and checked underneath, but there was nothing. We searched everywhere: the closet, the bathroom, the kitchen. Everywhere. She had just vanished. 

“Call the police, I'm gonna drive around the neighborhood in case she left the house!” I shouted.

Jane began dialing 911, and I heard her give the operator the address as I left the house. 

I spent the next 15 minutes driving up and down the roads close to home, but there was no sign of my grandma. Jane texted me that the police had arrived, and I returned to the house. The police re-checked the house and talked to someone on their radio about having all officers on the lookout for a wandering and confused elderly woman. 

I explained to them that her scream sounded frightened and that I thought she might have been taken. They listened to me explain as much as I could without making me sound crazy, and when I had finished my story, they told me the most likely scenario was that she had left the house on her own. I didn't try to argue. I knew how my story must have sounded, and there was nothing I could say to get them to believe me. 

On top of that, I wanted them to be correct. If Grandma were out on her own, as dangerous as that would be, it would be better than being taken. The officers left the house to search for Grandma. While they drove away, I held Jane, who was sobbing into my shirt. 

The rest of the day, Jane and I drove around town looking for her. When we would get tired of driving we would go back to the house and search there again. We repeated this cycle until it started to get dark and we decided to try again the next day and allow the police to do their jobs. 

We remained in contact with them throughout the day, but they turned up nothing. I was devastated, and I felt like crying, but I had held back the tears all day. I was not afraid to cry in front of Jane, but I felt like I needed all my energy to go toward finding Grandma. I couldn't waste any time crying. 

While at home Jane passed out on the couch, exhausted from the emotionally taxing day. I stayed up on my computer creating a flyer to put up around town the next day. I kept my phone ringer on so I would get all updates from the police. Eventually, I started to drift off while sitting upright on my chair. 

I felt the world getting fuzzy as my eyelids slowly fell, fluttering back open a few times and falling again. I was seconds away from total unconsciousness when I heard a voice whisper, 

“You don’t remember, do you sweet boy?” 

I jolted awake to find the Plastic Angel peering its head from behind the sofa that Jane was sleeping on. Its long fingers wrapped around the back of the couch. “J….Jane…” I managed to squeak out. 

“Jane wake up!” She didn't move. I knew she was a deep sleeper but come on Jane! “You need to remember.” The Angel's voice was shrill, like nails on a chalkboard. 

“Remember what?” I asked. 

“You need to remember Paul. You were young. Your mind was easily molded. But it was not the truth.” 

The Angel began inching toward me as it continued. “You need to see what you were forced to forget.” When the Angel had reached my chair, it slowly lifted its pointer finger which began to glow brighter than any light I had ever seen. The finger landed on my forehead, and I fell into a deep sleep. 

**17 Years Ago**

When I was 8, my parents fought a lot. One summer, when my father finished his 3rd stint in prison, he returned home to find that my mother was not conducting their finances the way she had before he went away. She spent more money on groceries and less on pills. She bought me new shoes and even took me to the movies once. 

This caused them to fight to no end. Whenever they would argue, I would sit outside our mobile home on a concrete slab and wait for it to be over. One day, I sat out in the sweltering sun and played with a group of ants that found a small splash of grape soda I had spilled. I let them crawl on my fingers and then back to the hot ground. 

The air was wet, making it hard to swallow. The yelling from inside became unbearably loud, so I stood up and began walking. I didn't know where I was walking to. I just wanted to be somewhere safe. 

After about a half mile of wandering aimlessly, I saw a girl sitting on a tire swing, that hung from a solitary tree. I tried not to make eye contact because I was 8 and girls were icky. 

As I was walking past, she called out to me, “Hey, kid!” 

Shocked, I turned to see her with a warm smile on her face from ear to ear. 

“Hi,” I replied sheepishly. 

“Could you push me? I'm not very good at pumping my legs.” 

I felt a little weird about it, but I didn't really have anything else to do. I decided to comply since pushing a girl on a swing seemed more interesting than walking. 

“What's your name?” she asked. 

“Paul,” I said, warming up to her more and more by the minute. “What's your name?” I asked. 

“Jane.” she said matter of factly. We played for around an hour, and I decided it was probably time to head back home. My parents didn't like when I was gone for long. After that day, every time my parents would fight, I'd walk over to Jane’s house, and we’d push each other on the old tireswing. 

On one particularly rainy day, my parents began to get into another one of their heated arguments. I put on my rain boots and was about to go to my room to get my coat in hopes I could meet up with Jane. Maybe we could find some big puddles to splash in, I thought. 

As I trodded over to my bedroom, I heard my mother scream. It wasn't a scream out of anger (that wouldn't have been novel enough to catch my attention). It was a scream of pain. 

I ran into the kitchen, where I saw my mother holding her face, which was quickly turning a dark color. My father was standing over her with rage in his eyes. Fear held me in its grasp. 

I wanted to turn, to run! But the fear held me in place, staring at the violent scene before me. Wide eyes filling with tears, I looked at my mother, then at my father, and back at my mother. 

My dad looked at me and shouted, “You see, Paul! This is what happens when you step out of line!”

I was paralyzed. I wanted to help my mother. I wanted to tell her that everything would be okay. I wanted to hurt my father for hurting her. 

But most of all, I wanted to scream! I wanted to scream so badly, but I couldn't. All that came out was a sob. My crying only made my father angrier. 

He took a step towards me, but my mother shot up off the ground like lightning and lashed at him, screaming, “Stay away from him, you monster!”

My dad shoved her off and went to hit her again, but my lungs finally released the death grip they had held on my oxygen, and I screamed, “Stop it!” This caught him off guard, and as he turned to face me, my mother jumped to her feet once more and rushed to the knife block, pulling out the biggest one. 

Before she had a chance to use it, my father grabbed her from behind and threw her down. Her head slammed the counter on her way to the floor. With a thud, she landed on the ground. She lay motionless as a pool of blood formed around her. 

“Oh shit!” my dad yelled. He started grabbing at her head in a feeble attempt to stop the bleeding. “No, no, no, no…” his voice trailed off. As I watched this unfold, my vision became blurry, and my peripheral vision began fading out, locking my gaze on the crimson stream flooding from my mother’s skull. We sat in silence. 

Minutes passed, then an hour. I didn't dare say a word. I couldn't. There was nothing in my 8-year-old mind that could understand what had happened. My mother never woke up. 

When my father finally composed himself, he stood up off the ground and began rummaging through drawers in the kitchen. After a minute of searching, he found what he was looking for. He dropped to his knees next to my mother with a package of plastic wrap in his hands. He lifted her head a few inches and carefully wrapped the plastic around her head. 

He was thorough, making sure the blood couldn't continue to drip from her wound. Once he was satisfied with his patch-up job, my mother looked like a shiny manikin. He laid her head back down and left the room, returning a moment later with the rug from under our coffee table. He wrapped her tightly. 

He snapped at me to grab the mop, and soon I was cleaning the kitchen floor. I had to stand up to avoid him as he dragged my mother out of the kitchen and through the front door. He latched the deadbolt behind him, and a moment later, I heard the ignition of his truck. Peering out the window, I watched him drive away. 

He didn't come back for several hours. The whole time he was gone, I stayed in my corner of the kitchen, curled into a ball. The evening turned to night. Eventually, I fell asleep on the kitchen tile. 

I awoke when he returned, walking in slowly. I looked at the digital clock on the stove. 5:55 AM. He was sweaty and tired and wore a look of sadness on his face. 

He took a shower, got dressed, and then called me into the living room. I did as I was told and shuffled my little feet until I found myself sitting on the couch next to the man who had raised me. He was quiet for a while and seemed to be lost in thought. 

He looked at me and said, “Pauly, you know mommy had to go away for a little bit, right?” I looked at him, confused. He continued, “Mom has been fighting some tough battles these past few months. She used a lot of drugs. You know she uses drugs, dont you?” I nodded. 

I had seen her on many occasions, high as she would lay in bed for what seemed like days. I said nothing as he thought for a minute before telling me, “Mom had to go somewhere to get help. A rehab center. It's kind of like a hospital.” The more he spoke, the less I understood. 

“But she was bleeding! Where did you take her?” I felt more lost than I had ever felt. 

“No, Paul,” he said sternly. “She wasn't bleeding.” 

“But, but you-” I stammered. 

“No! Paul, no!” he shouted. “Mom is fine. She just had to go away for a while.” he sounded really frustrated. “She had to go away,” he reiterated. “So when someone asks you where your mom is, what do you tell them?” He was looking me right in the eyes now. 

“I..” I thought for a minute. “I..tell them she had to go away for a while.” 

“Yes! Yes, Paul, that's right!” he buried my face in his chest as he forced an embrace. “That's right, son. Mom just had to go away for a little while, and that's all we know.” When he left the room, I sat there a little longer before standing shakily to my feet and walking out the front door. 

I sat on the wet concrete slap, unsure if I should cry. I was so confused. I really wasn't sure what had happened, but I wanted to believe my father. If he were telling the truth, then Mom would be okay. The rain had stopped, but the clouds still loomed overhead. 

Just then, I heard a quiet tap on the concrete beside me. I turned my head to see the most beautiful blue bird. 

I awoke drenched in sweat. I was in the living room chair where I had been before the Angel had touched me. Jane was still curled up on the couch. I pulled out my phone and checked the time. It was 5:50 AM.

**Day 5: Thursday**

When my alarm went off at 5:55 AM, I silenced it and woke Jane up. “What's going on?” she asked, rubbing her eyes. 

“We have to hide. This is when it always happens.” Confused but terrified, she sat up and began looking around. “Where should we hide?” she was starting to sound panicked, and I wanted to comfort her, but to be honest, I was scared shitless. 

“The pantry!” I exclaimed, pointing towards the kitchen. We scrambled to the door and hid inside just before a booming sound stopped us in our tracks. 

Just as we closed the door we heard a bloodcurling roar coming from the basement. We held each other tightly, neither of us daring to breathe too loudly. Pounding. Footsteps pounded up the stairs as the hate-filled roars continued. 

Through the slits in the pantry door, I could see a large black personage launch itself from the top step into the living room, black sludge spilling onto all surfaces as it frantically searched around the room. It carried my rolled-up rug from the basement. This time it looked a little thicker. The creature slammed the rug onto the floor of the living room and with a scream it fled down the stairs on all fours. 

After a few moments, we ventured outside the pantry. We couldn't hear the monster anymore, and we panted back the oxygen we had lost while holding our breath. Frantically I ran to the living room. I needed to see what was inside that rug. 

Something in my gut told me it would be the decayed body of my mother. But when I opened it up, she wasn't inside. Instead was my sweet grandma, still and cold. I let out a sob. 

Tears streamed from my face and I began performing CPR. 30 chest compressions and 2 breaths. I remembered. But it wasn't enough. My grandmother, the woman who had raised me most of my life, the only caretaker who ever gave me any sense of stability, lay dead on the floor of our living room.

At the funeral a few days later Jane held me as we cried together. I was a mess. I had never felt the sting of death quite like this before. 

I had been to funerals before, and they were sad. But this was different. Death didn't just take a life from me, it took my whole heart. Could I really say that death took my grandmother? 

Sure, death might have been waiting in the wings, but what took her was my past. If I had remembered what my father had done to my mother sooner, would all of this have been bypassed? Did it take the loss of my dear matriarch to deliver the truth? These are questions that I dont think will ever be graced with answers. 

Everything ended the night my grandmother was taken from me.

As they readied the casket to be lowered, a small blue bird perched near the head of the grave. It seemed to bow its head in reverence. 

Walking back to our car, Jane broke the silence, “I haven't smoked in years, but I think I'll need a cigarette today. You want one?” She pulled out a pack that I didn't even know she bought. 

“No thanks,” I replied. “My dad used to smoke 2 packs a day.”",4,1737528207.0,nosleep,1,1.0,False

1i754xl,https://www.reddit.com/r/deepnightsociety/comments/1i754xl/theres_something_in_my_grandmas_house/,There's Something in my Grandma's House,"I spend most of my waking hours caring for my elderly grandmother, who suffers from Alzheimer's disease, which has taken increasingly more and more from her.

I dont do anything requiring advanced medical knowledge. A nurse comes by the house twice a week to help with that sort of stuff. I have zero medical training other than a CPR course I took a few months ago in case of an emergency, but something tells me that I am already forgetting the basics with each passing day.

I dont mind taking care of her. My grandma took me in when I was 11 years old after my father and mother split. Neither of them really wanted a child. 

That was evident from the beginning. I think my mother loved me, but she was never fit to raise a kid, and she knew it. My father, on the other hand, was never fit to be around children, let alone take care of one himself. He was always in and out of jail.

Before my grandmother took me in, my fondest childhood memories were when my dad was doing time. Things weren't so bad when it was just my mother and me. But whenever he returned from his imprisonment, things would always end up falling apart again. When my parents finally did divorce, I was about as dejected as a child could be. The bright beam of childhood innocence had long since faded from my eyes.

That all changed when I went to live with my grandma. Her house was clean and big and had an acre of land. I had a room to myself and more than two changes of clothes. I thought we must have been rich.

Raising me increased her financial burden, but she never let it show on her face. That woman always had a smile on. I wish that smile would come back. Ever since the disease started taking a firm hold on her, she mostly just stares. 

She allows me to take care of her on the good days, and we spend quality time enjoying novels and her black-and-white TV shows. On the bad days, she won't let me help at all. I dont quite understand what sets her off, but some days she wakes up paranoid and scared.

**Day 1: Sunday**

My alarm went off at 5:55 AM. What the hell? I thought. I always set my alarm for 9:00 AM. Although many old people enjoy waking up earlier than the sun, my grandma will sleep all day if I let her. I usually start my day at 9:00, get myself ready, make breakfast, and then get grandma out of bed around 10:00.

So why was my alarm going off at 5:55? I turned it off and rolled over, trying to fall back asleep. But before I could, I heard a crash from upstairs. I live in the basement, and Grandma lives in the master bedroom on the main floor. I rushed out of my room and up the stairs as quickly as possible.

Was Grandma hurt? Did she fall? What was she doing out of bed? My mind was racing. When I reached the top of the stairs, I expected to see my grandmother somewhere on the floor, but instead, I saw an empty living room. 

The sun hadn't come up yet, making the room barely visible. I peered into the master bedroom and found Grandma still fast asleep. I closed the door slowly, trying not to wake her. With Grandma safe in her room, I decided to check the house to see if I could locate the source of the crashing sound. The kitchen looked normal, except for a knife in the sink, which I was pretty sure I had cleaned and put away the night before.

Next, I checked the living room and found a book on the floor. I keep the house pretty tidy so that Grandma doesn't trip over anything, so it was definitely odd to find the book in the middle of the room. I picked it up and opened it. It was a scrapbook. One of the many my grandmother had put together over the years. 

This one mainly consisted of photos of my mother when she was young. Closing the book, I walked a few feet to the bookshelf and returned it, where dust had revealed its usual resting place.

I still felt a little groggy, and with my tired mind, I rationalized that my grandma had been looking at it earlier and left it on the floor without me realizing it. That's the thing about the human mind. We will do anything to rationalize the unexplainable.

Remembering it was still early and I had about 3 hours before I needed to get on with my day, I snuck out of the house for a quick run. I don’t typically leave my grandmother unattended, but she wouldn't wake up for a while, and it was nice to get some time to myself. I returned to the house half an hour later.

Stepping into the bathroom, I got a text from my girlfriend, Jane. She works at a bakery and always texts me when she heads off to work, though I usually dont reply for a couple of hours because, like I said before, I'm never up this early. 

The text read, “Good Morning Paul! I'm leaving for work, but maybe I can swing by later and hang out for a bit?”

I smiled and decided I'd surprise her by texting back immediately, “Have fun at work! I love you!”

 “Wow! You're up early!” she replied. 

“Yeah, I got woken up by a loud noise and decided to get a jump start on my day.” I left out the part about my alarm going off 3 hours early.

When it was time to wake up Grandma, I went into her bedroom softly and turned on the light, but to my surprise, Grandma was already awake. She sat at the foot of her bed staring at me, not with her usual blank stare, but a fearful one.

“Hey, Grandma, what's wrong?” I asked.

She didn't reply. She just kept staring at me. I decided to give her some privacy after making sure she was safe. 

I went to the kitchen to make some breakfast. As I glanced into the sink, ready to wash the knife I had forgotten about the night before, it was gone. I figured I was tired when I noticed it earlier and was probably mistaken. 

There is a window above the kitchen sink, which gives a beautiful view of the lawn. As I stared out, a bluebird flew by and rested on the back porch. The beautiful bird looked almost out of place in our little backyard. I had never seen a bird like it in our area.

When I turned around, I almost jumped out of my skin to see my Grandmother an inch from my face.

“Geez, Grandma!” My fear quickly turned to laughter as I chuckled, “Granny, you nearly scared me half to death! Are you feeling any better?” She still had that scared and angry look on her face. It was almost as if… “Hey, grandma…” I said nervously. “You know who I am, right? It's me, Paul. Your grandson.” 

Quietly, she said without taking her eyes off me, “There's someone in the house.”

A feeling of awful guilt spread over me as I told her, “No, Grandma, you know me. I live here with you, remember?” Her anger turned to disappointment. 

She leaned closer to my face and, in a hushed tone, whispered, “No, Paul. I know who you are. I am telling you that there is someone in our house.”

My heart sank, and the guilty pit in my stomach became a sinkhole of fear. “Where?! Grandma, where did you see this person? My God, are they still here?” I instantly believed her, as I always have, but then, for a moment, I thought, Is this the disease? Is she seeing things now? I didn’t remember the doctor saying anything about hallucinations. 

I pushed the thoughts out of my head. I reached for my phone to dial 911, but grandma put her hand on mine before I could unlock it. 

“He's in my room.” She said it almost as if it was an afterthought.

My heart raced, and without thinking, I picked her up and shuffled towards the front door. Once outside, I sat her on the porch bench. “Stay here,” I said. She wasn't looking me in the eyes. 

I rushed back into the house and to her bedroom. The door was shut. I went to reach for the handle, but I stopped. 

Adrenaline had gotten me this far, but it seemed to run dry when it came time to investigate. What would I even do if I found someone in there? I thought. But I needed to make sure that we were safe.

I slowly turned the knob and pushed my way inside. Everything looked normal, other than a bit of clutter. Hadn't I picked up her room the night before? I checked everywhere, but there was no sign of anyone. 

I felt relieved and almost smiled at how worked up I'd been. That feeling soon left me as I remembered the master bathroom with its door still shut. I flung the door open, but what I saw didn't scare me. It was confusing. The walls, the mirror, the floor, all of it. It was all covered in a black sludge. 

The smell reminded me of the many hot summer days I spent walking the empty road as a kid. It was the smell of tar and tobacco. After standing in shock for what must have been minutes, I checked the rest of the house but found nothing.

I walked outside to find Grandma still on the bench. Her attention had turned to a small pile of ants on the concrete. “Hey, Grandma, I checked the house. There's no one there.” She didn't reply. 

“Did something happen in the bathroom? What is all that stuff?” Still no reply. I wasn't totally convinced that there had been an intruder, but I also wasn't totally convinced my Grandma had made the mess herself. 

The rest of the day passed by quickly. Grandma hadn't said a word to me since the incident, but honestly, I didn't really have time for conversation anyway. Cleaning the sludge was nearly impossible. 

It took me well into the afternoon to clear away the black stain. The tar was warm to the touch initially but soon completely dried, making it hard and resistant to my efforts.

I didn't even realize what time it was when I heard a knock at the door. Jane! I ran to the door and opened it to see her face beaming at me. 

“Jane! I am so sorry I forgot you were coming over.” 

She looked disappointed, “Oh, sorry. Do you want me to leave? I should have texted to remind you I was coming.” 

“No! Please come in. I'm sorry. I just feel bad that I haven't showered or made dinner or anything. I've been so busy today. 

“How's Grandma doing?” she asked. 

“It's been a bad day for her today.” She knew what I meant. I had often confided in her about Grandma’s previous “bad days,” she knew from interacting with Grandma how quiet and off she could seem when her mind wasn't at its best. 

“Aw, Granny,” she said, turning a sympathetic face to Grandma. She really did love my grandma.

We ordered Chinese food, and I told Jane about the day's events. “That's so weird!” she said between bites of orange chicken. “Where do you think she got the black stuff?” 

“I dont know. I'm not even 100 percent sure it was her. I mean, who knows, maybe someone was in our house. I did notice a few things out of place.”

We sat silently for a few seconds. We turned our attention to the black and white film we had put on for Grandma, and soon, the night started to feel like any other. When the movie ended, I tucked Grandma into bed. Jane and I turned on a show with actual color and cuddled on the couch.

**Day 2: Monday**

My alarm woke me up at 5:55 AM. I looked at my phone, puzzled that it had happened twice. Before I had time to go back to bed, a loud bang from upstairs startled me. I was on my feet in an instant. 

This sound was much louder than the one the day before. I barreled up the stairs and peered into Grandma’s room. She was asleep. Stepping back into the living room, I found the same scrapbook on the floor.

I started turning on all the lights. Once the room was well-lit, I opened the scrapbook. A sinister feeling crept into my bones as I flipped through page after page. Every picture that included my mother had been ruined, her face cut from each photo. 

I called the police, and the operator said they would be there as soon as possible. I was convinced that there had been someone in the house. While waiting for the police, I woke up Grandma and walked her out to my car, where she sat while I looked the house over. In the 6 minutes it took for the police to arrive, I noticed a drawer open in the kitchen. I also found more black goo in the garage. 

The police walked through the house, checking every place a person could hide. They didn't find anyone and there was no evidence of forced entry. 

“Sounds like someone might be looking to hurt your mom, seeing as her face was cut out of all the pictures.” said the officer. 

“Well, if someone had it out for her, they had the wrong house. We haven't seen her in nearly 17 years.” I replied. The officers offered to check up on us later tonight to make sure there wasn't anyone lurking around the property and said to call again if there were any further disturbances. 

“Thanks, officers,” I said. I ushered Grandma back into the house as they pulled out of the driveway. 

“You alright, Grandma?” I asked. No response. We stepped into the living room, and I was helping her sit on the couch when I noticed something out of the corner of my eye. I turned to face the kitchen window. That same bluebird from the day before was staring right at me. 

The bird was so beautiful, but looking at it, I couldn't help but feel like I was in some sort of danger. Like a bad omen. It continued to stare for a few moments and then flew away. 

The day dragged on. Grandma hadn't said a word; worse, she hadn't even looked me in the eyes. I was worried.

The sun dipped over the horizon, and suddenly, it was night. Time to put Grandma to bed. As I helped her get comfortable, she looked at me. It was a welcomed surprise, and I smiled at her, but she didn't smile back. 

She only whispered the words, “Someone is in the kitchen.”

Ice went down my spine. “What? Grandma, we were both just in there, and I didn't see anybody.” She looked terrified. Obviously, my words were of no comfort to her. 

She just repeated, “In the kitchen…the kitchen…kitchen.” Then she rolled over, closed her eyes, and stopped speaking. She was really starting to make me worried, and I really couldn't decide whether to believe her or not.

I left the room and headed for the kitchen. Upon arrival, I didn't notice anything out of the ordinary right away. Other than the drawer with the bags and wrap. It was open again. I turned to walk out and turned the light off, but the room didn't get dark. 

I flicked the switch on and off, but the room remained illuminated. In fact, it was getting brighter. Panicked, I did the first thing that came to my mind and reached for the big knife in the knife block, but I froze when I noticed the knife block was empty. Sweat washed over me, and I saw all the knives in the sink. 

The room continued to illuminate brighter and brighter as I dashed for a knife and cut myself on one of the smaller blades before finally grabbing hold of the bread knife. My attention briefly turned to my bloody hand as I attempted to wrap a rag around the wound. 

Just then, the room went completely quiet, and I saw it. A large figure, maybe 8 feet tall. The creature was completely naked except for a plastic film - plastic wrap, covering it from head to toe. The light emanating from the figure seemed to give me tunnel vision, blurring my surroundings. I couldn't make out the face, as it was completely masked in the plastic wrapping, but there was a protrusion where the nose was underneath. 

Petrified, I felt my blood run cold. I was so scared that I was physically unable to move. The dread filled me like molasses in a glass, slowing my thoughts. I dropped the knife, which crashed to the tile floor with a metallic clang. 

I wanted to run, but my legs felt like stone. I stared in horror at the bright monster, and just when I thought it might attack, it began to speak.

“Fear not, sweet boy,” its voice sounded frail and weak as if trying to convince me I was safe. It reminded me how an old person might talk to a child, almost mimicking their innocent tone. It continued to speak, “Sweet Paul. Sweet…Paul.” 

“Who are you?” I managed to say in a shaky voice. 

“Sweet Paul, I am your guardian angel. Your guide in the darkness. Your friend from above.” I wasn’t convinced. An angel? This thing looked demonic. It was the stuff of my nightmares. 

“Okay…well, I’m good, actually. I don’t need a guardian angel.” The angel began breathing heavily, and in a much deeper voice than before, it said, 

“Yes, my sweet boy. You do.” Just then, the knives in the sink flew straight up in the air and stuck into the ceiling. The noise startled me, and I turned to see the knives dangling. With my eyes briefly off the creature, I immediately heard footsteps running toward me. 

I screamed and turned back to face the monster. Raising my arms to shield my face, I braced for impact, but…it never came. 

I opened my eyes to a dark, empty room. It was gone, and I was all alone. I quickly flipped on the light and grabbed my phone to call Jane. It went straight to voicemail. 

She must have been asleep. With no one to talk to, I paced around my room until exhaustion took its toll, and I went to bed.

**Day 3: Tuesday**

The next day, my alarm went off at 5:55 AM. This time, I was ready. I bolted up the stairs before any noise alerted me to action, hoping to catch the creature who had been terrorizing us. I started my investigation by checking on Grandma. 

Asleep. Good, I thought as I shut the door and turned my attention to the rest of the house. The first thing I noticed was the scrapbook on the floor, with its pages torn out and strewn across the floor. I needed to clean that up before my grandmother had a chance to see the pitiful state of her treasured photo album, but that would have to wait until I scoured the rest of the house. 

Next, I went to the kitchen. Nothing looked too out of the ordinary, but I noticed that one knife remained stuck to the ceiling while the rest had fallen to the ground. I was about to check the rest of the house when I heard a loud slam coming from the basement. 

The noise was louder than the previous days, and I was sure it had woken Grandma, so I decided to check on her again before investigating. Just as I suspected, Grandma was sitting upright when I walked through the door. She hadn't turned to look at me when I walked in. 

“You okay, Grandma?” I asked. I wasn't expecting a response since she had been nearly mute the past few days. Despite my expectations, she answered immediately. 

“It's okay, Paul. They can't hurt us today. Hank will protect us.” Hank was the name of my grandfather, who had been dead for over 20 years. I didn't have the heart to remind her of his passing, so I said nothing and walked towards the stairs. As I took the first step down, the loud banging noise repeated, sending a chill down my spine. 

I went to take the next step but stood frozen for several seconds. I managed to break through my terror and continue my plunge to the basement. Other than my room, there are two other rooms downstairs. A guest bedroom and a family room which had slowly morphed into my personal mancave over the years. 

The sound happened a third time, and it was clearing coming from the family room. I peeked my head through the door but quickly shot back behind the wall. I had expected to see my not-so-angelic guardian angel, but crouched in the middle of the room was something far worse. 

It was bigger than the angel, maybe 10 feet tall. It had to slouch just to fit in the room. Instead of light, the creature emanated a blinding darkness, which seemed to be battling for space with the soft light of the moon coming through the window. Its hands were disproportionally large for its body, with long bony fingers. 

The most notable characteristic of the monster was what was covering its body. From head to toe, the creature was soaked in hot black sludge, which dripped down to the floor. The chemical smell was overwhelmingly potent, and I found myself struggling not to gag as I sat still and listened to the beast breathe. 

I shifted my weight, preparing to take another look. Before I could peer around the corner, the monster screamed, which sounded like the mix of a man and a dog. I booked it to the staircase, looking behind me, only to watch as the creature tumbled toward me with impressive speed. 

I reached the top of the stairs and almost ran for the front door when I remembered Grandma, who was still in her room. Thinking quickly, I leaped behind the island counter in the middle of the kitchen and hid myself, trying to make as little sound as I could. I heard the tar monster reach the top of the stairs and pause. Thankfully, it didn't know where I was, but soon began searching for me. 

I caught a glimpse of it as its back was turned to me, and I noticed it was carrying something large. Is that…a rug? I thought to myself. Then I recognized it. The thing was carrying my rug from underneath my coffee table. 

What on earth does it want with that? I turned my attention back to my hiding place and scanned for a weapon. As my eyes darted around the kitchen, I became transfixed on the window, or rather what was behind the window. A little blue bird. 

Just then, I heard something crash against the floor, and I spun around. The creature was gone, and my rug lay rolled up in the living room. The rest of the day felt foggy. My head was aching, and no amount of acetaminophen could dull the throbbing. 

Grandma stayed in her room, not letting me in other than to bring her meals and make sure she was taking her medication. By the time night rolled around, I was ready to call it a day, but Jane came over for dinner, and her contagious, unending energy started to rub off on me. 

“So what did you do today? Find any more objects in weird places?” she asked innocently. 

I had almost forgotten that I hadn't told her about the bizarre monsters I'd been seeing. I thought about keeping it to myself, but I could never lie to her. We had been friends since elementary school and together since high school. She was the one person on earth I expected to believe my story. 

So I told her about the Tar Monster and the Plastic Angel from the night before. When I finished, she stared at me with her jaw open. 

“Oh my goodness, Paul…this is just like that show Ghost Adventure or something!” she had a huge smile on her face, which was not the reaction I was expecting. 

“Um…maybe not just like Ghost Adventures, but it is pretty freaky,” I said. 

“We should like set up some cameras and catch them the next time they appear! We could be like famous or something.” she really did seem genuinely excited about the idea. 

“I'd like to see how excited you are when they appear in your kitchen.” I shot back, now smiling myself. 

“It's okay, Paul, I'll stay the night to protect you.” she offered. 

“Dont you work in the morning?” I asked. 

“Nope! We’re closed tomorrow, silly.""

I didn't say it, but I was actually extremely relieved to not have to spend the night alone. I started to get seriously terrified of my own home. “Well, it’s settled then.” I told her, “You can deal with the big evil monsters, and I will get some much-needed beauty sleep.” 

The rest of the night actually felt normal. We watched a horror movie at Jane’s request (what is it with her and this spooky shit?) and went to bed. 

I had this really weird dream that night about my mom. In the dream, I was young, maybe 7 or 8, and was helping her mop the kitchen. She showed me how to fill the bucket with water and how much cleaner to pour in. She handed me the mop and said, “Give it a try!”

I was so eager to help I nearly tripped over the mop as I swished it from side to side. We were cleaning up something wet, and I figured maybe I had spilled some grape soda again. “And then you dip it into the water again,” she told me. I plunged the mop into the bucket and was about to pull it back out when I saw the water turn a light red color. 

Confused, I looked at the ground I had just mopped and was horrified to see that the liquid I had been smearing around the tile was a thick, shimmering pool of blood. I screamed and looked up at my mother for her to comfort me, but I stumbled backward over the bucket when I saw her. As I lay soaked in soap, water, and blood, I watched my mom stare at me with the biggest smile. Her head was bleeding. 

I shot up in bed, free from the nightmare. I must have been gasping for air because Jane sat up as well and started rubbing my back. 

“Hey, hey! What's the matter?” she asked. 

Catching my breath, I started to laugh a bit as I said, “I just had the weirdest, most morbid dream of my life. I was a kid, and my mom was letting me help with chores, but she was bleeding everywhere, and I think that she was going to die.” 

Jane continued to comfort me, and said, “That is weird. Your mom is fine though right? I mean as far as we know?” 

To be honest, I wasn't sure how my mom was doing. The last time I saw her was just before she went to rehab when I was 8. From that time forward, I only communicated with her through letters. When I was 13, the letters stopped. “I'm sure she’s okay,” I said, more to reassure myself than Jane. 

We went back to sleep, and I didn't have any more dreams that night. 

**Day 4: Wednesday**

My alarm woke Jane and me up at 5:55 AM. 

“Why did you set the alarm so early?” she asked, pulling a pillow over her ears. 

I turned off the alarm. “I didn't set it. It's just been doing that. There should be a loud sound, kind of like banging, in a minute or two.” We sat in complete silence, waiting for something to happen. 

About 10 minutes passed, and I started to feel relieved. “Maybe nothing will happen today,” I said. Moments later, we heard a scream coming from upstairs. 

“Granny!” Jane shouted as the two of us sprang into action. I stumbled on the stairs but recovered quickly as I bear-crawled the rest of my way up with tremendous speed. When I reached Grandma’s door, Jane was close behind me. I burst through the door and looked side to side for my grandmother. 

She was gone. I ran to her bed and checked underneath, but there was nothing. We searched everywhere: the closet, the bathroom, the kitchen. Everywhere. She had just vanished. 

“Call the police, I'm gonna drive around the neighborhood in case she left the house!” I shouted.

Jane began dialing 911, and I heard her give the operator the address as I left the house. 

I spent the next 15 minutes driving up and down the roads close to home, but there was no sign of my grandma. Jane texted me that the police had arrived, and I returned to the house. The police re-checked the house and talked to someone on their radio about having all officers on the lookout for a wandering and confused elderly woman. 

I explained to them that her scream sounded frightened and that I thought she might have been taken. They listened to me explain as much as I could without making me sound crazy, and when I had finished my story, they told me the most likely scenario was that she had left the house on her own. I didn't try to argue. I knew how my story must have sounded, and there was nothing I could say to get them to believe me. 

On top of that, I wanted them to be correct. If Grandma were out on her own, as dangerous as that would be, it would be better than being taken. The officers left the house to search for Grandma. While they drove away, I held Jane, who was sobbing into my shirt. 

The rest of the day, Jane and I drove around town looking for her. When we would get tired of driving we would go back to the house and search there again. We repeated this cycle until it started to get dark and we decided to try again the next day and allow the police to do their jobs. 

We remained in contact with them throughout the day, but they turned up nothing. I was devastated, and I felt like crying, but I had held back the tears all day. I was not afraid to cry in front of Jane, but I felt like I needed all my energy to go toward finding Grandma. I couldn't waste any time crying. 

While at home Jane passed out on the couch, exhausted from the emotionally taxing day. I stayed up on my computer creating a flyer to put up around town the next day. I kept my phone ringer on so I would get all updates from the police. Eventually, I started to drift off while sitting upright on my chair. 

I felt the world getting fuzzy as my eyelids slowly fell, fluttering back open a few times and falling again. I was seconds away from total unconsciousness when I heard a voice whisper, 

“You don’t remember, do you sweet boy?” 

I jolted awake to find the Plastic Angel peering its head from behind the sofa that Jane was sleeping on. Its long fingers wrapped around the back of the couch. “J….Jane…” I managed to squeak out. 

“Jane wake up!” She didn't move. I knew she was a deep sleeper but come on Jane! “You need to remember.” The Angel's voice was shrill, like nails on a chalkboard. 

“Remember what?” I asked. 

“You need to remember Paul. You were young. Your mind was easily molded. But it was not the truth.” 

The Angel began inching toward me as it continued. “You need to see what you were forced to forget.” When the Angel had reached my chair, it slowly lifted its pointer finger which began to glow brighter than any light I had ever seen. The finger landed on my forehead, and I fell into a deep sleep. 

**17 Years Ago**

When I was 8, my parents fought a lot. One summer, when my father finished his 3rd stint in prison, he returned home to find that my mother was not conducting their finances the way she had before he went away. She spent more money on groceries and less on pills. She bought me new shoes and even took me to the movies once. 

This caused them to fight to no end. Whenever they would argue, I would sit outside our mobile home on a concrete slab and wait for it to be over. One day, I sat out in the sweltering sun and played with a group of ants that found a small splash of grape soda I had spilled. I let them crawl on my fingers and then back to the hot ground. 

The air was wet, making it hard to swallow. The yelling from inside became unbearably loud, so I stood up and began walking. I didn't know where I was walking to. I just wanted to be somewhere safe. 

After about a half mile of wandering aimlessly, I saw a girl sitting on a tire swing, that hung from a solitary tree. I tried not to make eye contact because I was 8 and girls were icky. 

As I was walking past, she called out to me, “Hey, kid!” 

Shocked, I turned to see her with a warm smile on her face from ear to ear. 

“Hi,” I replied sheepishly. 

“Could you push me? I'm not very good at pumping my legs.” 

I felt a little weird about it, but I didn't really have anything else to do. I decided to comply since pushing a girl on a swing seemed more interesting than walking. 

“What's your name?” she asked. 

“Paul,” I said, warming up to her more and more by the minute. “What's your name?” I asked. 

“Jane.” she said matter of factly. We played for around an hour, and I decided it was probably time to head back home. My parents didn't like when I was gone for long. After that day, every time my parents would fight, I'd walk over to Jane’s house, and we’d push each other on the old tireswing. 

On one particularly rainy day, my parents began to get into another one of their heated arguments. I put on my rain boots and was about to go to my room to get my coat in hopes I could meet up with Jane. Maybe we could find some big puddles to splash in, I thought. 

As I trodded over to my bedroom, I heard my mother scream. It wasn't a scream out of anger (that wouldn't have been novel enough to catch my attention). It was a scream of pain. 

I ran into the kitchen, where I saw my mother holding her face, which was quickly turning a dark color. My father was standing over her with rage in his eyes. Fear held me in its grasp. 

I wanted to turn, to run! But the fear held me in place, staring at the violent scene before me. Wide eyes filling with tears, I looked at my mother, then at my father, and back at my mother. 

My dad looked at me and shouted, “You see, Paul! This is what happens when you step out of line!”

I was paralyzed. I wanted to help my mother. I wanted to tell her that everything would be okay. I wanted to hurt my father for hurting her. 

But most of all, I wanted to scream! I wanted to scream so badly, but I couldn't. All that came out was a sob. My crying only made my father angrier. 

He took a step towards me, but my mother shot up off the ground like lightning and lashed at him, screaming, “Stay away from him, you monster!”

My dad shoved her off and went to hit her again, but my lungs finally released the death grip they had held on my oxygen, and I screamed, “Stop it!” This caught him off guard, and as he turned to face me, my mother jumped to her feet once more and rushed to the knife block, pulling out the biggest one. 

Before she had a chance to use it, my father grabbed her from behind and threw her down. Her head slammed the counter on her way to the floor. With a thud, she landed on the ground. She lay motionless as a pool of blood formed around her. 

“Oh shit!” my dad yelled. He started grabbing at her head in a feeble attempt to stop the bleeding. “No, no, no, no…” his voice trailed off. As I watched this unfold, my vision became blurry, and my peripheral vision began fading out, locking my gaze on the crimson stream flooding from my mother’s skull. We sat in silence. 

Minutes passed, then an hour. I didn't dare say a word. I couldn't. There was nothing in my 8-year-old mind that could understand what had happened. My mother never woke up. 

When my father finally composed himself, he stood up off the ground and began rummaging through drawers in the kitchen. After a minute of searching, he found what he was looking for. He dropped to his knees next to my mother with a package of plastic wrap in his hands. He lifted her head a few inches and carefully wrapped the plastic around her head. 

He was thorough, making sure the blood couldn't continue to drip from her wound. Once he was satisfied with his patch-up job, my mother looked like a shiny manikin. He laid her head back down and left the room, returning a moment later with the rug from under our coffee table. He wrapped her tightly. 

He snapped at me to grab the mop, and soon I was cleaning the kitchen floor. I had to stand up to avoid him as he dragged my mother out of the kitchen and through the front door. He latched the deadbolt behind him, and a moment later, I heard the ignition of his truck. Peering out the window, I watched him drive away. 

He didn't come back for several hours. The whole time he was gone, I stayed in my corner of the kitchen, curled into a ball. The evening turned to night. Eventually, I fell asleep on the kitchen tile. 

I awoke when he returned, walking in slowly. I looked at the digital clock on the stove. 5:55 AM. He was sweaty and tired and wore a look of sadness on his face. 

He took a shower, got dressed, and then called me into the living room. I did as I was told and shuffled my little feet until I found myself sitting on the couch next to the man who had raised me. He was quiet for a while and seemed to be lost in thought. 

He looked at me and said, “Pauly, you know mommy had to go away for a little bit, right?” I looked at him, confused. He continued, “Mom has been fighting some tough battles these past few months. She used a lot of drugs. You know she uses drugs, dont you?” I nodded. 

I had seen her on many occasions, high as she would lay in bed for what seemed like days. I said nothing as he thought for a minute before telling me, “Mom had to go somewhere to get help. A rehab center. It's kind of like a hospital.” The more he spoke, the less I understood. 

“But she was bleeding! Where did you take her?” I felt more lost than I had ever felt. 

“No, Paul,” he said sternly. “She wasn't bleeding.” 

“But, but you-” I stammered. 

“No! Paul, no!” he shouted. “Mom is fine. She just had to go away for a while.” he sounded really frustrated. “She had to go away,” he reiterated. “So when someone asks you where your mom is, what do you tell them?” He was looking me right in the eyes now. 

“I..” I thought for a minute. “I..tell them she had to go away for a while.” 

“Yes! Yes, Paul, that's right!” he buried my face in his chest as he forced an embrace. “That's right, son. Mom just had to go away for a little while, and that's all we know.” When he left the room, I sat there a little longer before standing shakily to my feet and walking out the front door. 

I sat on the wet concrete slap, unsure if I should cry. I was so confused. I really wasn't sure what had happened, but I wanted to believe my father. If he were telling the truth, then Mom would be okay. The rain had stopped, but the clouds still loomed overhead. 

Just then, I heard a quiet tap on the concrete beside me. I turned my head to see the most beautiful blue bird. 

I awoke drenched in sweat. I was in the living room chair where I had been before the Angel had touched me. Jane was still curled up on the couch. I pulled out my phone and checked the time. It was 5:50 AM.

**Day 5: Thursday**

When my alarm went off at 5:55 AM, I silenced it and woke Jane up. “What's going on?” she asked, rubbing her eyes. 

“We have to hide. This is when it always happens.” Confused but terrified, she sat up and began looking around. “Where should we hide?” she was starting to sound panicked, and I wanted to comfort her, but to be honest, I was scared shitless. 

“The pantry!” I exclaimed, pointing towards the kitchen. We scrambled to the door and hid inside just before a booming sound stopped us in our tracks. 

Just as we closed the door we heard a bloodcurling roar coming from the basement. We held each other tightly, neither of us daring to breathe too loudly. Pounding. Footsteps pounded up the stairs as the hate-filled roars continued. 

Through the slits in the pantry door, I could see a large black personage launch itself from the top step into the living room, black sludge spilling onto all surfaces as it frantically searched around the room. It carried my rolled-up rug from the basement. This time it looked a little thicker. The creature slammed the rug onto the floor of the living room and with a scream it fled down the stairs on all fours. 

After a few moments, we ventured outside the pantry. We couldn't hear the monster anymore, and we panted back the oxygen we had lost while holding our breath. Frantically I ran to the living room. I needed to see what was inside that rug. 

Something in my gut told me it would be the decayed body of my mother. But when I opened it up, she wasn't inside. Instead was my sweet grandma, still and cold. I let out a sob. 

Tears streamed from my face and I began performing CPR. 30 chest compressions and 2 breaths. I remembered. But it wasn't enough. My grandmother, the woman who had raised me most of my life, the only caretaker who ever gave me any sense of stability, lay dead on the floor of our living room.

At the funeral a few days later Jane held me as we cried together. I was a mess. I had never felt the sting of death quite like this before. 

I had been to funerals before, and they were sad. But this was different. Death didn't just take a life from me, it took my whole heart. Could I really say that death took my grandmother? 

Sure, death might have been waiting in the wings, but what took her was my past. If I had remembered what my father had done to my mother sooner, would all of this have been bypassed? Did it take the loss of my dear matriarch to deliver the truth? These are questions that I dont think will ever be graced with answers. 

Everything ended the night my grandmother was taken from me.

As they readied the casket to be lowered, a small blue bird perched near the head of the grave. It seemed to bow its head in reverence. 

Walking back to our car, Jane broke the silence, “I haven't smoked in years, but I think I'll need a cigarette today. You want one?” She pulled out a pack that I didn't even know she bought. 

“No thanks,” I replied. “My dad used to smoke 2 packs a day.”",1,1737528063.0,deepnightsociety,0,1.0,False

It might deserve it.","Okay, hear me out. I’ve owned this pair of sneakers for about three years, and they’ve been through everything: hiking trips, coffee spills, questionable late-night Taco Bell runs—basically, they’ve seen some things.

But recently, I noticed something peculiar. My left shoe has started to wear out in oddly specific ways—like the sole is slanted, the laces fray faster, and the toe has this weird indent, as if it’s been holding in existential dread. Meanwhile, my right shoe? Looks like it came straight out of the box.

I started paying attention to my walking habits (as one does when their footwear develops a personality), and apparently, I put my entire life’s stress on the left side. The poor thing takes every uneven step, every angry stomp, every overenthusiastic dance move at weddings.

So now I’m sitting here, staring at my shoes like they’re old war buddies, realizing my left shoe might need therapy more than I do. I’m considering crocheting it a little blanket or maybe giving it a retirement party.

TL;DR: My left shoe has endured more emotional labor than some people in my life, and I don’t know how to make it up to it. Ideas?",2,1737527928.0,TheLeftHandedSpoon,0,1.0,False

It feels so good to be able to dream consistently again!

Over the past weeks i've managed to become lucid here and there, which was mostly awesome so far. Tonight it got really really strange though. I would like to know if someone here has encountered something similar.

So, the dream started off with me moving to a small village. I'm 29, but it felt like i was a young adult again.

I made a great friend there and he and i went to the local village pub to get a few drinks.

We had lots of fun, and there where some female dream characters too. I could sense that one in particular liked me, and she seemed really cute but thats it. We didn't talk.

Now to the part where it gets weird.

I was calling my mum to pick me up, and the next thing i remember is that i'm in this huuuuuuuuuge parking lot with multiple floors.

I asked myself why should there be a gigantic thing like this parking lot in a small village. I became lucid when i noticed that the tires of the few cars that where parked there had really weird shapes.

I've enjoyed the weird liminal space this parking lot was, and played around a bit with the physics.

Suddenly few dream characters came around the corner. I've let one of them know that he is just that, a dream character. He stared at me, becoming quite angry. Then he just opened his mouth and his eyes started to glow bright orange. Thats when i decided to wake up because it was really scary tbh.

Next thing i know is i'm lying in my real bed thinking how weird that was, but grateful for being able to control my dream a while before i fucked it up.

Suddenly i hear someone entering my flat, I couldnt move. It just like when i had sleep paralysis back then. I had them semi regurarly back when i was 22-23. But never again since then.

I heard the person making themselves a coffee in the kitchen, and just laid there.

Suddenly i hear my mums voice saying: ''Alright, i'm heading out!'' and i hear the door opening and closing again. Thats when i was able to move again. I look at my phone, and the clock's saying 02:22.

I went back to sleep.

Sooooo .. what i'm really confused is everything at the end. My mother definitely wasn't there, and also no one else. I think it might have been that i woke up, and slipped into another dream which took place in my actual bedroom. Inception style?

Did i wake up into a sleep paralysis? Where my eyes where open but i still dreamed that someone is in my home?

OOF that weird. i hope y'all might have some insight for me.

I had my first date with a girl. It wasn’t really pleasant because she was busy and had to take two calls and answer an email over lunch and coffee. I mean she was apologetic enough about it, even letting me see her email. Aside from that we actually got to discuss a lot of stuff about us even love languages, childhood memories, aspirations, that stuff. 

That evening, I asked if she got home safe. We chatted a bit. She said she had fun and would go out with me again. No plans yet.

Two days after our date. She and her parents went on a vacation. It was planned months in advance. We even talked about it over the date. I texted her “have a safe trip” a few hours before her flight. Inserted a subtle flirt which she ignored. Perhaps she’s not feeling it because she hates planes and airports and is pressured to be the one planning the entire trip. We had no communication during her vacation. I didn’t message either to give her space with family. 

She texted me upon returning home and we chatted as usual. But then she fell ill to food poisoning. I wished her well. She joked that she’s probably dead. I  said i must be talking to an angel then (okay i think this one is witty lmao). It seems like she ignored my flirt once again and left me on read.

I feel like im pushing it too hard on the flirting these days. But she enjoyed it so much days before our first meeting so i thought it’s something she likes.  I understand my bad timing though.

I’m also probably overthinking if she’s losing interest because she ignored my flirts and we had no communication for a while because of the trip.

A less than pleasant first date is messing me up too.

Should i converse with her normally and ease up on the flirting? Perhaps just check in if she’s feeling better.

\- For food, I'm aiming to cook food on my own mostly, but of course I will be eating outside food sometimes. I don't drink coffee like apart from like once a month so that's a big expense saved lol, and I don't drink much either

\- I'd like to travel as well, locally in the UK and across Europe, but I'd like to fly cheap and ideally with people so I save $$ on accom

Considering this, could anyone give a ballpark figure?
