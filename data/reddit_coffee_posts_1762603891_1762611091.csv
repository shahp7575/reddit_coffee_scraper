I’m new to Curtin and just started in the IT course (second semester). I haven’t really had a chance to make friends yet, so I thought I’d reach out here!

1orqaef,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1orqaef,Grounds in vertuo coffee after bearing replacement,"My Nespresso Vertuo machine was increasingly loud while brewing coffee. I’ve had it for about seven years now and it’s brewed probably thousands of cups at this point. I looked up the problem and saw that it was a bearing issue and seemed easy enough to fix. I ordered a new bearing, took the machine apart, replaced the bearing, and put everything back together exactly as it had been before.

Now the machine brews whisper quiet, but the piercing mechanism seems to be faulty - it doesn’t pierce the pod correctly and is causing tons of grounds to be brewed into my cup. I’ve taken the machine apart again to figure out the issue, but everything looks correct. I’ve run multiple descaling and self cleaning cycles and I’m at a loss. 

I’m about to trash the whole machine but wanted to ask here if there’s an obvious solution that I’m overlooking. Has anybody run into this and if so, how did you fix it?",1,1762610870.0,nespresso,0,1.0,False

Property 2: Medium sized terrace,  not as old. Minimal reno if any. Not many choices in terms of food without driving- only one mamak stall within walking distance. A little harder to get Grab especially in the early am. Less traffic in this area. More greeneries-air is cleaner. Nearest to my parents.

Property 3: Medium size condo with 3 rooms. Lots of food choices, within walking distance though not as near as Prop 1 . Guarded and feels more secure when I'm on my own but have to pay maintenance fee every month which includes insurance. Difficult to move furniture in and out as I need to get permission every time and pay a deposit. Easy to get Grab but it's in a very busy area where dust accumulate quickly.

1orq0zp,https://voice.somervillema.gov/inner-belt-brickbottom-crossing,Inner Belt–Brickbottom Crossing,"**About the project:**

Residents and visitors, looking to move between the Inner Belt and Brick Bottom neighborhoods must follow a lengthy route that uses an underpass on Washington Street. To make getting around easier—the City of Somerville is looking to develop a new crossing across the Green Line Extension tracks that more directly links the two neighborhoods. 

With the support of a [MassWorks Infrastructure Program Grant(External link)](https://www.mass.gov/info-details/massworks-infrastructure-program), the City of Somerville’s Division of Infrastructure and Asset Management will be exploring options for the crossing andadvancing early-stage design through 2026. 

Creating a better connection for people walking, rolling, or riding a bike between the two neighborhood was identified as a key community priority in the recent [Brickbottom Neighborhood Plan](https://voice.somervillema.gov/9455/widgets/26917/documents/59288) (adopted September 2024). An improved crossing will both positively impactresidents’ quality of life and support economic growth. 

**Project Goals:**

As part of this project, we intend to:

* Create an accessible pathway for those who walk, roll or bike 
* Support neighborhood economic growth
* Ensure the design reflects community input, and supports long term sustainability

Join us at an upcoming **Community Open House** to learn more about the project, share your experiences moving around the neighborhood, review preliminary design concepts, and provide feedback. 



* **Date and time**: Tuesday November 18, 2025, 4:30-6:30PM
* **Location**: Triangle Coffee Bar, [100 Chestnut Street, Somerville, MA 02145(External link)](https://maps.app.goo.gl/PeJb4VeTCcBmWWD39)

At the open house, community members can explore different stations describing aspects of the project and talk directly to the project team about their questions and comments. 

If community members cannot attend, there will be multiple other ways to share feedback such as through an online feedback survey, virtual office hours, and more. 

**Interpretation notice**

The City of Somerville can provide you with an interpreter in your language for free. To request an interpreter, please contact us at [languageaccess@somervillema.gov(External link)](mailto:languageaccess@somervillema.gov) or call 311 (617-666-3311) at least 7 days in advance of this event.

**More About the Design Process and Preliminary Concepts**

The City and their engineering consultant Arup are currently progressing the preliminary design of six (6) alternatives, as outlined below. The two (2) that rank the highest in the multi-criteria analysis will be toadvanced to 10% design in early 2026, with a preferred alternative expected to be chosen in Summer 2026. 

The 6 alternatives are provided below:

1orq0lc,https://www.reddit.com/r/picoSaaS/comments/1orq0lc/just_launched_premium_tier_for_muz11_music/,Just launched Premium tier for MUZ11 - Music streaming with human curation instead of algorithms (50% off intro offer),"Hey r/picoSaaS!

After weeks of running MUZ11 as a free service, I've just launched our Premium tier and wanted to share with fellow indie makers.

**The concept:** Music playlists curated by professional radio DJs, not algorithms. Every playlist has up to 100 songs - long enough to be substantial, short enough to actually finish.

**The model:**

* **Free tier** (forever free): 1 premium playlist monthly, full player controls, zero ads, no credit card required
* **Premium tier**: $4.99/month for 100 curated playlists with new ones added weekly

**Currently offering 50% off** with code **INTRO25** for early adopters.

**What makes it different:**

* 100% human-curated by actual radio professionals
* Completely ad-free (even on free tier)
* No algorithmic recommendations - just intentionally crafted playlists
* Clean, minimalist interface focused on the music
* All genres covered: Jazz, Rock, Electronic, Indie, World Music, Classical, and more

**Why this pricing:** Wanted to keep it accessible while being sustainable. At $4.99/month (intro price), it's less than a single coffee but covers our curation costs and infrastructure.

**The numbers:**

* 100 playlists × up to 100 songs each = thousands of hand-picked tracks at launch
* New playlists added weekly for premium members
* Zero ads across all tiers

**The tech stack** is pretty simple - focused more on the curation quality than complex features. Cancel anytime, no lock-ins.

Would love to hear your thoughts on the freemium model and pricing strategy. Happy to answer any questions about building a music SaaS without VC funding!

* 21, 198 cm, athletic build. I have dark hair, brown eyes, and I'm told I'm kinda cute, but I’ll let you be the judge of that
* I'm finishing my law degree next month in a dual-study program with public administration
* I’m a calm, confident presence in public, but affectionately playful in private. I show love through making you killer carbonara, thoughtful gifts, and making sure you feel cared for

**What I’m into**

* **My hobbies:** Books, working out, cooking, co-op games (love co-op horror if that's your vibe), shows (anything from Gravity Falls to Chernobyl), martial arts newbie (getting less foldable). I also love fragrances and taking care of myself
* **Spontaneity is welcome:** I'm actually writing this from Seoul, a trip I booked just three days before flying
* **My vibe:** I'm a bit of a homebody who loves adventure. My ideal winter night is cuddling up to watch a show, and my ideal holiday is touring through Europe in a van (maybe one we build together?) or staying in one of those glass igloo hotels in Lapland (please look them up, you won't regret it!)

**What I’m looking for**

* **Deep, mature, mutual devotion.** A relationship where we give to each other because it makes us happy. I want to build something with a genuine friendship at its core
* **You're around my age (18-25) and in Germany (NRW)/Netherlands/Belgium** so meeting up is easy. I value good communication, equal effort, and consistency

I’ve been using it for a bit and I’m still in awe of how simple it feels. I grab my Kindle in the morning and my personal feed is already sitting there, formatted as an ebook. No syncing, no uploads, nothing. It’s just there.

I wanted something that actually felt personal and worth reading, something that matched how I think and what I care about. When I saw how cheap it was, I didn’t even think twice about adding another subscription. It’s about a quarter of what I spend on toilet paper every month, and somehow feels way more valuable. It builds a calm, clean morning edition around the subjects I like and it just feels natural.

Just the other day I tried the story feature and made a version of my own life set on the moon. It was oddly fun to read, though I’m not even sure that’s what this feature was meant for. I love how smooth it all feels. I ended up with a 71 page book in a few minutes. I wrote what I wanted, went to make coffee, and when I came back it was already on my Kindle, perfectly formatted. I honestly wish there was an ios app for it or is there one that I’m missing?

So in short TLDR:
Is there an ios app of epubshelf or is it named differently, anyone know?

1. Got back to the rhythm after a long time cuz of my calf injury. Last 2 months was all rest and recovery. Restarting was tough on different levels. But i am not able to push my limits because of the injury. This subconscious fear of injuring myself again is just worse than injury itself. I can’t sit idle for another 2 months. 

2. Most important thing. I had quit smoking for more than a year before the injury. Staying idle during these last 2 months made me relapse and have been smoking atleast a pack per day since. My day starts with a cigarette and black coffee. I always thought I’d be able to quit once i restart running but i failed. I’m smoking as i write this.

PS: I’m a doctor and i know all the hazards. I don’t want people resorting to fear mongering cuz tbh it never worked for me. Give me hacks, like “scamming myself from not doing it” kinda hack.

Since I’m not a native English speaker, I asked GPT to help me adapt my story and make the text clearer for you all.  


\--------  
**TL;DR:**  
I did 20 weekly 36-hour fasts, then a **5-day extended fast**.  
Kept working out and following my normal routine. Felt mostly normal, with occasional focus boosts.  
Broke the fast with **miso, tofu, and sprouted lentils**, then ate a normal meal two hours later.

**Results (after 16 days):**

* Body fat: **↓ from 25.8% to 22%**
* Muscle mass: **↑ from 34.8% to 37.2%**
* Body age: **↓ from 49 to 45**
* Belly visibly smaller, arms more defined



\-------------------------  
I’m a 34-year-old male, 1.82m tall (about 6’0”) and 80kg (176 lbs). I’ve been lifting for about 2 years, training 4–5 times per week, focusing on consistency rather than lifting heavy.

Before I started working out, I weighed 67kg (148 lbs).

My diet is pesco-vegetarian — I eat fish, eggs, dairy, and cheese, but no red meat or chicken. I sleep well (\~8h/night), don’t drink coffee, and rarely drink alcohol.

I supplement with creatine, vitamin B12, whey protein and vitamin D.

For several months, I practiced a **36-hour fast every Monday**, my rest day from the gym. I completed **20 consecutive weekly 36-hour fasts**, keeping a balanced diet during the rest of the week.  
After that period, I decided to check my **body composition**, and the results were disappointing:  


📅 **Oct 23, 2025**

* Weight: **81.1 kg (179 lbs)**
* Body fat: **25.8%**
* Skeletal muscle: **34.8%**
* Basal metabolism: **1745 kcal**
* Body age: **49 years**

Even with a healthy routine, I was surprised by how high my body fat was. So I decided to try something different: a **5-day extended fast**.

# The 5-day fast

I kept my **normal work routine**, went to the gym, and took daily walks. Overall, I felt fine — no major energy spikes or crashes.  
I didn’t experience the extreme “mental clarity” that some people talk about — I just felt **normal**, with a few moments of focus that I used for **meditation**.

During my usual meal times (lunch and dinner), I took **a pinch of sea salt** for electrolytes.  
To help with sleep — since fasting makes it harder for me to rest — I used a **sleep aid**.

I broke my fast with **miso and tofu**, plus a small portion of **sprouted lentils**.  
Two hours later, I had a **normal meal**.

After **16 days**, I repeated my body composition test:

📅 **Nov 7, 2025**

* Weight: **79.8 kg (176 lbs)**
* Body fat: **22%**
* Skeletal muscle: **37.2%**
* Basal metabolism: **1741 kcal**
* Body age: **45 years**

# Results

In just **16 days**, my **body fat dropped almost 4%**, my **muscle mass increased**, and my **body age dropped by 4 years**.  
My **belly got visibly smaller**, and my **arms looked more defined** — nothing dramatic, but clearly noticeable.

1orpqxp,https://www.reddit.com/r/espresso/comments/1orpqxp/compact_espresso_machine_150/,Compact Espresso Machine [$150],"Hi everyone 👋

I’m new to this subreddit and looking for some advice. I currently use a Nespresso machine and it’s been great for convenience, but I’m getting a bit bored of the same capsules. I’d like to add a new compact espresso machine to my setup so I can experiment with different beans and brewing styles.

I have a very small kitchen, so space is limited. Ideally, I’m looking for:

- A compact or even portable espresso machine that makes great coffee.
- Something with a built-in grinder would be perfect, so I can grind beans fresh and make espresso from start to finish.
- I mainly drink espresso or ice latte, so a milk frother isn’t essential, just a nice bonus.

If anyone has experience with small espresso setups or recommendations for good machines and grinders that don’t take up too much space, I’d really appreciate your suggestions.

Thanks in advance for your help! ☕

My wife will still laugh at the pettiness of it to this day and will tell people about how ridiculous I can be.  


Back when I worked at this fire department it was 2 man stations an engineer (driver/operator) and a firefighter. There used to be this one dude who was a foul mouthed rude new yorker we'll call him ""Gino"". This department is in the deep south and if you could imagine his reception wasn't well met.


This dude would act like a complete ass and talk to people like dog shit he was a bigger dude in his 40's and fairly muscular. Everyone who was stationed with him would eventually have a falling out and would complain about him but always cave to his shit. The guy knew the job very well and along with intimidating people would leverage that in his favor to get by. I mean even to the point of berating lower level officers when doing drills and having them done his way ""you stupid hillbillies this is how we did it in New York"" and take something out of their hand and do it.


Well you have me a skinny 20 year old know it all rookie with a red ass neck and a strong opinion. After finishing my probationary period my first detail from our headquarters station was with Gino as the last guy had forced the chief to move him and he was just getting a string of people who were coming in on overtime.


Day 1 I roll up and make coffee and start checking off trucks.. gino rolls up just a few minutes before shift change with his front license plate that has some tag that says ""mafia"" and is made it look like a new York tag (I remember that catching my eye and thinking wtf is this?). I say good morning and doesn't even acknowledge I'm even speaking. ""Yep this is gonna be interesting"" I think to myself.


I'll never forget it was mid morning and I hear him yelling from the bathroom area ""stop leaving the toilet seat down there isn't any fucking women in here!!""... I think to myself what in the hell? Is this guy joking"" I barley say two words to him the entire shift and vise versa.


Next shift rolls around about mid morning I hear him yelling again and actually happen to walk by the doors wide open and he literally kicks the seat I can hear it bang on the porcelain. I laugh to myself and think ""yeah fuck this guy"" and make it a point to make sure I put both seats down and throughout the day even if I didn't have to use the bathroom to walk by and set them both down. I'd take a piss both seats would go down... id happen to hear the toilet flush when he'd walk out I'd walk in and put it down....Dude just kept getting madder and maader, then by the evening he comes to me and says ""hey you need to stop leaving the toilet seat down unless your taking a shit and people don't take more than 1 a day theirs no women in here so just fucking stop"".... I stare at him for a few seconds and look at him and just say ""nah bo"" and walk off to the engine bay with him standing there fuming.


The next shift and again mid morning rolls around and I hear him yelling so I start laughing and do the same thing. I'd walk by and lower the seat and say ""fuck you"" to myself as I do it.
By that afternoon I walk back into the inside for lunch and dude is sitting there and gets up and stands inches from me saying ""I know your doing this to get under my skin you'd better fucking stop you dumbass hillbilly if I wanna piss I don't want to have to pick the fucking seat up all the time""... I look him dead in his eyes and say ""how about carry your yankee ass back to where you came from, and I'm going to tell you right now you ain't gonna tell me what the hell I'm gonna do with the toilet thats my business!"".... The dude looked absolutely shocked and appalled I said anything. I walk outside and the dude follows me to me a few minutes later I'm so mad I'm standing by my truck and threw in a pinch of dip (tobacco) he walks up to me again and says ""you don't speak to a superior like that I run this station""... I look over at him and say ""I don't give a good God damn who you are carry your ass away from me before I beat the stupid outta you boy!!!"" I then grab a piece of iron that was sitting in the bed of my truck and spit the tobacco juice towards his feet. The dude no joke turns around a runs inside and 20 minutes later I see our battalion chief roll up hauling ass and stops in front of the bay. He hops out and looks at me and throws his hands up ""what's going on?!?!?"" Gino then walks out and says ""this millennial fuck bag doesn't have any respect"" I then look over and start yelling derogatory things and it just gets nasty.
We both start yelling and our battalion chief literally has to stand between the both of us yelling ""shut up!!! Stop!!!"" 


We both calm down and he says ""okay what's going on?"". The Gino dude literally goes into a long diatribe about being old school, brotherhood, and the whole thing about the toilet. Before I can start talking the old chief looks dismayed and says ""y'all tell each other sorry I don't make enough for this bullshit"" and drives away. 

Many many shifts went by dude wouldn't say a word much less even look at me outside of calls. I kept doing the toilet seat as I saw fit and eventually he started talking. Turns out the dude had really bad alcohol and martial issues. We never became friends but had a mutual understanding and things smoothed over which shocked alot of my coworkers who absolutely couldn't even be near the dude. eventually I got detailed to a really busy station and he got fired for cussing out a chief.",1,1762609167.0,coworkerstories,0,1.0,False

[**Context (Battle of Chosin Reservoir)**:](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Battle_of_Chosin_Reservoir)

* **On 27 November 1950, the Chinese 9th Corps surprised the US X Corps in the Chosin Reservoir area.** A brutal 17-day battle in freezing weather soon followed. Between 27 November and 13 December, **30,000 United Nations troops were encircled and attacked by about 120,000 Chinese troops**. The UN forces were nevertheless able to break out of the encirclement and to make a fighting withdrawal to the port of Hungnam, inflicting heavy casualties on the Chinese.
* Although the 9th Corps was one of China's elite formations, composed of veterans and former POWs from the Huaihai Campaign, several deficiencies hampered its ability during the battle. **As a result, the 9th Corps had almost no winter clothing for the harsh Korean winter.** Similarly, poor logistics forced the 9th Corps to abandon heavy artillery, while working with little food and ammunition. The food shortage forced the 9th Corps to initially station a third of its strength away from the Chosin Reservoir in reserve, and **starvation and exposure weakened the Chinese units,** since foraging was not an option in the sparsely populated area. **By the end of the battle, more Chinese troops had died from the cold than from combat and air raids.**

1orpnds,https://www.reddit.com/r/heartbreak/comments/1orpnds/day_16_morning/,Day 16 – Morning,"

It’s about 830AM. I came to work as I usually do on Saturday’s. I went to sleep last night without taking any medication. I guess, that’s a good thing. However, woke up at 1:30AM. Tossing and turning. In my mind replaying everything. Thinking of all the things I would say to her if she called, all of the hurt this has caused me.

Went back to sleep and woke up around 6AM. She use always tell me on weekends, take it easy. You don’t have to rush anywhere, give your body a break. But for me now, moving is all I can think of doing. Trying to stay focused on a task.

Had some oatmeal, and having my morning coffee now. I am starting to debate about blocking her on my phone as well. I had blocked her on social media and our mutual fitness app.

Do I really need this person coming back into my life? It’s been six days since we last met, where in one way or another I ended it. She won’t ever see the light. She’s not a sixteen year old, but acts like a sixteen year old. At this age, after all the failed relationships she has had, if she can’t figure out how to make this better. Than this is not someone that should be in my life.

The fact, is that people we know will of course give us their thoughts, advice etc., They might hate the person we dated. They might have said we should leave them. Perhaps, in these moments we only speak about their negative flaws. But those of in the relationship often remember, the good as well. The hope of course, that the good being presented by the other person is not manufactured.

Was this all just convenience for her? The only spare time she had, we would usually meet. She would call me all day, let me know what was up, and I would always pick up. But relationships require work as well. Even when she decided to meet me for dinner last week. It was on her schedule. In her eyes, it would be I had no time, the time I had I decided to meet with him. My view is, no. When you first wanted to reconnect, it should have been immediate. I want to see you.

I guess, I am asking things of a person that just can’t give it. She will drift through life, and at her age while she still looks great. The looks will eventually start to fade for her. In her quiet moments is she thinking about me? Is she thinking I want to say something to him. Or is it still, that her view that she made an effort and I wouldn’t accept it.

In any event, it doesn’t matter. These are things I will never know the answer to. Al lI can do is deal with the hourly torture and doom and gloom. I think to myself I am not even one bit better since this happened. Other than a few minutes here and there over the last few days.

This has become my new norm. And while I appreciate my friends. I know eventually they will grow tired. I know she’s probably busy with her kids, making plans with friends to distract herself. I can’t even meet up with friends. I mean I am in no position to be out in public.

Friends say, come on man just snap out of it. It will be good for you. But we all know ourselves. And I know me. It won’t be good for me. It will just be worse for me.

1orpie5,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1orpie5,I built ScreenLapse — a free Android app that helps parents control kids’ screen time using timer locks and fingerprint unlock,"Hey everyone 

I recently finished working on my side project called ScreenLapse — an Android app designed to help parents manage their children’s screen time in a simple, reliable way.

The idea came from seeing how difficult it is for parents to balance trust and control when it comes to phone use. So, I decided to build something practical that could help.

Main Features:

 App timer locks that automatically restrict usage

Fingerprint unlock (for parents only)

 Usage stats and activity insights

 Works even after reboot


Tech stack:

Built with Android Studio (Kotlim + XML)

Uses foreground services, shared preferences, and usage access APIs

Tested on multiple Android devices


 Goal:
I wanted to create something lightweight and free that genuinely helps families develop healthier phone habits.

 GitHub Repo (Open Source):
https://github.com/naklevaar/ScreenLapse


It’s currently stable and functional — I’d really appreciate any feedback, code suggestions, or feature ideas from fellow devs. 🙏

I’d love your help to understand what people really want and how to best tailor this concept for Bangalore.
Please take a few minutes to complete this short survey:

Your input will influence product selection, store design, menu, and location choices.
Some questions you’ll see:
•	Your familiarity with Korean and Japanese brands and cuisines
•	What food and drink products you’d like to find in such stores
•	Features and ambiance you value in convenience store cafés
•	Locations in Bangalore that would be convenient for you
•	Willingness to pay a premium for authentic products

I’ll never forget when he borrowed almost half of my first salary to cover some “emergencies” he had. It really disappointed me because even after earning a decent amount from his coffee this year and promising to repay me, he never did.

Today, he was asking me how mobile loan apps work, and it honestly made me sad. I told him their interest rates are high and that lenders check your credit score, hoping it might discourage him. What worries me is that just a few weeks ago, he took a loan meant to boost his coffee farming, but now he keeps saying he’s broke(He also likes kauji IYKYK😂). Even his monthly pension stipend goes toward repaying other loans. It’s wild.

Part of me wants to help, but another part knows I can’t keep enabling this pattern. I’m trying to build my own stability, but it’s painful to watch a parent struggle like this.

My grandparents on both sides of the family passed a long while ago, and there was some beef with the extended family on both sides and a break in contact that I don't know much about (i think it was some inheritance issues), so we only really had each other.

When I returned from work this Monday, I was confused when I couldn't find him at first, and got no answer when calling out to him. He was a homebody, and didn't really go out with his mobility issues. I had called home earlier today and was confused why no one answered, but at the time I thought he was napping. Now, I was worried he had to call an ambulance for himself, or had to get help from a neighbor and couldn't return yet.

When I decided to freshen up a bit before I would go looking for him in the apartment complex, I found him, lying on the bathroom floor, fully clothed, looking peaceful, as if he was sleeping; at the time, that was what I thought. That he, for some reason, laid down, couldn't get back up, and decided to sleep until help arrived. That hope was dashed when I touched him, after he wouldn't answer me. He was ice cold.

Looking back, it very well looks like he might've not felt well in the morning, shortly after my mom went to work, and went to the bathroom to throw up. He still managed to do that, but must've felt so bad that he laid down flat on the ground... he sometimes did that when not feeling well... and there, he may have had another stroke, a heart attack, or something completely different... we're not sure, and will probably never have the full picture...

I could only scream and cry as I rushed out to get my phone, and, in a panic, desperately tried calling my mom, who couldn't answer as her phone was on mute and she was in a seminar. Thankfully, a neighbor heard my screams and cries and was able to take over from here. I don't know what I would've done if she didn't. I was inconsolable for at least an hour or two, even when the EMTs and the police came. My mom wasn't much different; my neighbor lied to her in order to get her here safely, so that she could drive without possibly fatal mistakes, telling her that there was something wrong with *me*, but she already had a bad feeling. We cried in each others arms for a while.

I was given the rest of the week off by my boss, who was very understanding. He even invited me to have a birthday dinner with him, to talk, so that was nice. The day after things happened my mom's best friend came to visit for moral support, as the funeral director came to plan things. That helped calm things down a bit...

On Wednesday, I was pouring through my phone gallery, as well as the gallery of my old Nintendo 3DS, to look for any pictures that I could save anywhere I could for archival purposes; I never wanted to forget any of this, so I'd make sure. I also had some random bouts of sobbing here and there...

Yesterday was my birthday. Really bad timing, huh? My dad dies just a few days before my birthday... We made plans, but we couldn't really do this anymore... I remember that we argued about what cake I should get on Sunday, just a day before he passed, since the one I wanted wasn't to his taste. We got some slices of traybake cakes instead. We were watching a movie on TV, eating them and drinking coffee, talking about Dad, and how he'd probably call my mom out again for being on the phone all the time. She cried, while I just held her hand.

...I just worry, since by Thursday... my waterworks seemingly have run dry. I haven't really been able to cry. I still tear up, but I no longer cry... I don't know if it's because I'm subconsciously repressing things, or because finding him broke something in me, or simply because I went through more stages of grief at the same time compared to my mom due to finding him... I am still sad, I KNOW this. I still have this awful feeling in my chest and stomach. My mind keeps racing back to what happened. But... I can eat again, I can even laugh at silly YouTube videos again... While my mom still just... cries, and has to force herself to do anything, even eat.

I don't know if all of this means that I am dealing with things better than her... or quite possibly worse. And that worries me.",4,1762607476.0,offmychest,2,1.0,False

 I have a decent job, I manage to get on by myself and this year I went on holiday twice.   
 Once in Portugal and once back home to my home country but in my home town I didn't feel at home like I used to feel. 

 I had this feeling twice when I went to Portugal and Easter Europe that I miss Mannheim and Germany. I was in both places for one week but I kept missing Mannheim for some reason.   
 I missed the trams coming on time ( this is a big thing for me and I can tell you guys are lucky to have such a good public transport system, NO not you DB I am talking about Mannheim's RNV). 

 I missed going to bakery every morning to get cappuccino and croissants, the cappuccino at the bakery shops is pretty decent compared to other speciality coffee places in other countries. 

 Germany is efficient in many things and I am happy that I moved here, I made the right decision, I know things are not perfect here either but it's truly an honour and a privilege to live here.

 I feel like I missed the vibe in Mannheim, they say each city has it's own spirit and that was very true about my home town and I felt it immediately after I moved to Mannheim as well, but now when I moved to my home town I didn't feel it as much as I feel it here in Mannheim. 

I am not saying that my vacation was bad, I enjoyed every little bit of it but I felt that my home now is in Mannheim.

 It was hard in the beginning but with time I made myself comfortable here, I met nice people and the vibe and spirit in the city is truly different even compared to other cities in Germany.

Transplant to Utah from southern California. Enjoy the mountains and a good hike, but endlessly miss the  crashing waves of the ocean. Athletic but not the gym type, ride a bit, go for a walk, play a sport is more my groove. Drink way too much coffee so that I can watch a movie after the day ends (keep a running watchlist on imdb and its currently getting to an unmanageable length). Have some tattoos and plans to get more. Baseball is my favorite sport but follow most the major ones to some degree. I say I read but what it really is while out and about I have an audio book going and get read to. Love getting to a concert but lately have been bands my kids enjoy or to watch a kid in a school band (marching band has to be the most demanding high school sport!). Did I mention I enjoy being sports entertained and identify as ""sicko"" vs the mainstream in that regard. Prefer a road trip for my travel then airports.

1orowjv,https://www.reddit.com/r/Necesse/comments/1orowjv/my_compact_settlement_20_all_settler_automation/,"My compact settlement 2.0, all settler automation explained.","Hello, I wanted to share my final version of my settlement, and all the stuff that's going on with automation. This may help to pick ideas for your own automation, or some kind of reference or guide.

https://preview.redd.it/i7y782cm710g1.png?width=4048&format=png&auto=webp&s=1307404e21bd0734fe008da889cbbdfb174fc86a

**On layout:**

I only expanded settlement borders once, the thing is quite compact, here are the general details:

\- 23 villagers (one less to biggest size): one of each including a villager, three guards, two of animal keeper, fishermen, miner, trader, explorer.

\- Houses are usually 6x7 tiles, that's 15 happiness due to room size, and have some decorations inside, usually other 15-20 happiness due to that. I have more than enough happiness to have everyone on max happiness.

\- On the center we have the workshop area, where I craft most stuff manually, but also where settlers may craft potions and material bars. The fridges with the food ingredients and plants, plus meals (anything that gets spoiled over time) at on the left side of the workshop, near the cooking pots, and the cooking station, so I can craft any meal on demand without carrying the ingredients.

\- The workshop chests if I go clockwise: Stone, Ore, Bars, Incursion Materials, Incursion Shards, Seeds, Saplings, Misc (Coins and other things like pouches, bees, grass...), Magic, Physical and Equip Scrolls (I have to sort them manually from time to time), Armor, Trinkets, Melee / Ranged / Magic & Summon Weapons, Tools & Ammo, Flowers Fridge, Vegetables Fridge, Cooked and byproducts Fridge, Fruit and raw meat & fish fridge, buff potions, non-combat potions and health/mana potions, materials and drops, mineral, logs.

\- There is a storage area nearby at 5 o'clock from the workshop, there I have the extra materials + many non-workshop items, I won't go in full detail, but I have old gear chests, trinket chests, personal gear and stuff chests, boss items, pets and mounts, cosmetics, walls, doors, tiles, landscaping items, vinyls.

\- There's a incursion room on the right side o the workshop, the bone chests down are T1 to T10 tablets, the Bone chest on the left side of the room just to settlers to dump tables and altar dust.

\- The farm are patches of 6x5, I adjusted it to keep my meals going while over-producing a bit of everything. As you can see, lots of wheat needed, as is used for feeding trails, bread and flour. Extra tomatoes, carrots and sugar beet due to my food selection. Extra iceblossom for the fridges.

\- There's a wood area on the northeast, with 12 of each different wood tree (ten total).

\- Also a thorns area on the north. You need to get mud from the swamp or swamp cave in order to plant it. I think it cannot be automated.

\- In the source on the bananas, there are also some cactus, you need sand from the desert in order to plan cactus, and can be automated.

\- I also have an armory (in violet on the north), there I stored one-of-each weapons and armor.

**All the automation that's going on:**

\- First there are three dump chests (chests with management included, but no items allowed), and one extra chest called ""last storage"", that allows all items but on lowest priority. If any chest goes full everything overflowing goes there, then I can address it adding extra chests, or removing excess manually.

\- On the work zones, what you would expect, a zone for the wood, exactly one square with a cactus, as I rarely use them, one zone for each cattle, pigs go on 50% male and female, the rest usually 30/60 or even I have one with 15/85 for cows, for extra milk I need for my recipes. The fertilizer zone is just all the farm zone, excluding the sunflowers on elder house (is very rarely used).

\- All the feeding trails are automated, on high priority, so they get filled often. The quantity is usually 20% more then wanted number of cattle (IE 20 cows, would have 24 wheat).

\- On food support: windmills: I have one with 98 Honey 100 sugar beet (so they use both for sugar), one with 100 rice and 100 ground coffee, the other with 100 flour. One cheese press with 60 cheese.

\- On food, 17 gourmet meals automated with 10 rations each, keep in mind you only need 12 different to make the best food variety (and maybe a few more to avoid going short if one ingredient is scarce), but went the extra mile. Lots of different recipes, I tried to use every single ingredient and as few as possible, but I end up using tons of sugar and milk. No onion is used, usually tied to expensive meat dishes.

\- On the mission boards, I got missions for: rare fish, basically terrorfish, swampfish, rockfish and icefish. Most ores are set to automatic, if there's less than 50 available, 120 for mats like amber or quartz. A few missions for exploration that i send manually from time to time to get missing trinkets and vynils.

\- On food storage: I usually keep a few stacks of everything (means 500 max on most veggies, fruit and meat), and a few extra stacks for flowers. The rest goes into shipping crate specific for extra food. Probably the best move is just to keep 100 or 150 each, I just kept higher stacks to watch out with plenty of time if one product is going down over time. Common fish my fishermen brings every day is set to 120 each of the tree common fish types.

\- I have 9 compost bins, some of them have the recipe to convert spoiled food into fertilizer. I have a sack nearby on low priority with seeds and fertilizer. The seeds chests on the workshop has max two stacks (always max 1000) of each on the seeds.

\- My workshop log chest has a max of 4 stacks (max 2000), and a secondary chest on the warehouse with another 4 stacks in lower priority. The rest goes to my second automated shipping chest. TIP: when both log chests are full, you can set both on normal priority, so settlers are not moving logs from the warehouse to the workshop as you use the workshops ones.

\- My materials (drops and minerals) have a top of 2 stacks sometimes three (wool, leather), I have a secondary chest in lower priority for those mats in the warehouse without limit (I manually send things on a shipping chest from time to time).

\- Same with ammo, throwing items (ninja star, ice javelin) and bombs: I keep two stacks on the workshop, and there's a secondary chest on the warehouse I manage manually).

\- Vynils: I have two of each (max 2) in 5 chests, the last one is unrestricted with unknown vynils. The rest goes to a shipping chest.

\- Cosmetics: two of each, 4 for runebound boots, in two chests, each one with 50 cosmetics, the rest goes into the shipping chest. Seems too little chests, but most stets are already on dresses stored manually as I complete sets.

\- Potions: I have three alchemy tables, one fallen, one void, one caveglow. Most potions are on recipes, usually up to 20 or 30. I manually craft and upgrade health, mana potions, plus building potion. I also make bottles up to 250 (one full stack).

\- The two forges, each one has a limit of 300 to 500 bars. I rise values from time to time when i stack too much ore. broken iron and copper tools are set with a forever option instead. I also make glass until 250 (one full stack), with stone limited to deep cave stone (the ones you get tons of due to incursions).

\- Trinkets, I have 3 chests with the ones i use on the workshop. Also 4 trinket chests on normal priority, with max 2 of each trinket, about 26 each chest. Any extra trinket goes to the shipping chest.

\- Shipping chests to sum it up, one exclusive for food ""Food Exports"" (any excess from the fridges), one for all the rest of the excess from other automated stuff (logs, trinkets, cosmetics, vynils), called extra exports, and one without item placement outside management, so I place there what I want to sell manually. Both shipping chests are set on 20 items before shipping off, on lower priority.

**What I don't automate:**

\- I place lots of iceblossoms on the fridges and lots of logs on the furnaces and the cooking pots/cooking station. This prevents them from placing some logs and iceblossoms to keep things going, little by little.

\- I tried to add the different extra seeds into the compost bins, I ended doing it manually, from time to time. My setters could do that, but was too much hauling management for them, so I prefer to do it myself.

\- As mentioned before, extra materials, saplings, ammo, is sold manually on demand. They fill up quite slow, so is not a big deal, even if I'm distracted they will start appearing on my ""last storage"" chest, set on lowest priority.

\- I could also automate some landscaping stuff you may get over and over from incursions, I just didn't bother with it and do it manually from time to time.

\- I manage workstation, landscaping and carpenter bench manually, while is great early game to make some beds or basic walls as materials come in, or to equip your settlers on latest armor, does add little value on incursions.

\- I manage strolls and tablets manually, because there's no distinction in storage options.

**Final Tip:** If you break one of the automated containers, put the ""last storage"" on lower priority and the related shipping chest on lowest, until you fix the mess (so easy because things breaking in one hit with pickaxe, or careless bomb management xd).

Let me know if missed something, probably I overlooked it.

I got $30/person per day ($60 per room total) for the breakfast credit from Amex, $50 per day with the Hilton Gold food credit, and $100 experience credit which could be used on the spa or dining.

In room dining for breakfast was $26 to $55 for the different meal options. Coffee or fresh squeezed juice was ~$15. Get the French toast, even for $34 for one big slice of bread… it was amazing. Portions were on the smaller side. The bill included a 23% fee (18% gratuity and 5% in room dining administration fee). I didn’t end up paying extra for any food because of all the credits.

1orovj6,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1orovj6,NBD: Russell Professional Hunters,"After three long months of anticipation, my custom pair of Russell Moccasin Joe’s PH boots finally arrived yesterday, and I couldn’t be happier with how they turned out. I went with the Vibram 360 sole, Pecos Chamois leather, and Coffee Twill quarters — a combo I hadn’t seen anyone else try. It felt like a bit of a gamble at the time, but seeing them in person, I’m glad I took the chance. The mix of woodsy color, texture, and tone is perfect to my eye.

What really stands out to me is the craftsmanship. Everything about these boots feels intentional and skillfully executed. You can tell they’re handmade, and that’s part of the charm. They’re not the flawless, machine-perfect builds you get from something like Viberg or Grant Stone, nor are they the rough-hewn, tank-like construction of Whites. Instead, they strike this perfect middle ground — meticulous, balanced, and deeply human in their construction if that makes any sense. The amount of complex stitching alone is kind of unreal; you can just pick them up, look over the seams and panels, and get lost thinking about the sheer amount of handwork that went into them. It’s funny, since these are built to put in hard miles and beaten up, but I can’t help appreciating the artistry behind them.

I’ve got several acres of woods behind my home, and these will be my go-to boots for tromping around during the warmer months. What really blows me away is how feather-light they are — they feel almost sneaker-light yet still manage to offer a reassuring level of support. They’re also remarkably quiet, which makes sense given their roots as stalking boots for safaris.

The feel reminds me a lot of my old Vivobarefoot Snow Trackers — super flexible with a minimal drop, giving that near-barefoot sensation but without the punishment of every root and rock. I can already tell these are going to see a lot of miles. Here’s hoping they hold up as well as my beloved RM Backcountry boots have over the years.",1,1762606959.0,Boots,1,0.67,False

Boiler: I think Heat-Exchanging will be a better for me, but you’ll tell me based on my answers down here if a double-boiler is a better fit for me. 

Drink frequency: As for myself, probably around 2-3 espressos. But I ain’t the only one at home, so my parents might also pull themselves, and say we guests — they’ll be welcomed with decent espresso, or milk-based coffee. So yes: Pulling shots Back-to-Back is going to be there. But not everyday… 

Space: I don’t think so.

Experience level: I am not new to that world, but I have had an entry espresso machine (Breville BEI), and it isn’t enough for me.



Electric only.


As for the grinder. I’d rather acquiring a single-dose grinder, as I am not a fan of keeping the coffee beans inside the grinder, but rather in their original package.

1orolme,https://i.redd.it/4whxems1510g1.png,The Long and Final Autumn,"  “I’m glad that I’m able to walk you down the aisle, Sonya.”

  “Yeah… I’m glad too, dad.”

  The bride wore a ball-gown – patterned white, a long train, and the one she had her eyes on since she was in high school. She’d saved it for someone special, her one and only. And right now, it was only him that she saw in her eyes, standing at the altar. Curly dark hair and clean shaven, he wore a bright tuxedo, with that smile to boot. The violins played Wedding March and the guests – family and friends all stood with big smiles; they gave this couple their silent blessing, as the bride’s father had too.

  It was an indoor venue. The windows are sealed well, with little sign left behind of ever being ones there. No expense was spared, it did well to stave off that heat from the outside with little noise.

 The father's boots landed heavy and slow up the marble steps, the old man that held the hands of his daughter adjusting his leg to find surer footing on the ground. Bride and groom now faced each other – childhood friends, to highschool sweethearts, and soon to be husband and wife.

  Deep and gruff, his voice tried hard to carry a weight of authority as he pulled himself close to the groom, “You take ca- You make sure you and Sonya live a happy life… You hear me, Peter?”

 But no words came. None yet, anyways. The old man looked up and saw the man biting his lips, trying to push up a smile, eyes glossed over with tears. Peter gave a single sniff, then said, “That I will, sir. You take care of your own daughter just fine, yeah?” 

  And this time, tears welled up in the old man’s eyes. He couldn’t bear to let this young man see him cry then, and pulled him in closer, hugging him. 

  “I will, son… I will.”

  It was the picture-perfect wedding. Young love triumphed, and none would object. None possibly could. They kissed, now spouses two in the month of March – under the first Autumn leaves that fell in Spring.

  The sun was dipping now behind the distant buildings. Still, when the rooftop door opened to Sonya, a blast of prickling heat followed, with that glow of red in the sky. She pushed open the door with her shoulders, cake in one hand and an open umbrella in the other. She saw the young man sitting near the edge of the roof staring at that setting sun, unburdened by its rays. Speechless, both from the stunning beauty of the star of day, and the fact that Peter was sitting there without any protection, eating a slice of cake. He turned around, seeing the look on her face.

  “Cooler today, ain’t it? Don’t even need an umbrella.”

  “Mmhm.”

  Sonya uses her feet to drag a brick to hold the door open, before propping her umbrella against the entrance there and entering with wine in her left hand. She takes a seat, leaning against the man. His hair felt nice – the softest and most comfortable.

  “Is that all supposed to be for me?”

  “Mmhm.”

  “Cause you know you can’t drink with th-”

  “I know. I know, it’s not that strong. And at least one of us should be drinking the wine we bought for this>’

  She presses up against the cork, thumbing it open with a loud pop. Peter accepts the bottled red from her, taking his first sip. It was sweet like grape juice, and just how he liked it.

  “I-is something wrong honey?”

  Sonya moved a piece of cake around her plate without having taken a single bite out of it. She only snapped back to that present moment after hearing her husband’s words.

  “Yeah… sorry Peter hah… It’s just the same thing I talked to you about the night we found out about the baby. I’m just a lil’ worried about some stuff, that’s all.”

  “We’re gonna be just fine, Sonya. The state mandates that your employer has to give you paid maternity leave later on, even if you’re quite a new hire. Plus, we’ve got your dad, my dad, my mom, my sister… Point is, we’ll be just fine-”

  “I know, I know,” she turns away just enough to hide the slight annoyance in her eyes. Sometimes, he didn’t know how exactly to help, “I guess… It’s just that I don’t know if I’m gonna be a good mother, is all. Some friends tell me that they feel this inexplicable joy and… I don’t think I’ve felt it, y’know?”

  Peter pulls her in closer, resting his head on hers now before turning his torso to give her a small hug, which turned into him holding both her shoulders, “Well I’m scared too. Dunno how much it’s worth but I think I get less scared that I’m gonna be a father of a child that’s gonna have you as a mom. And you gotta know that I’m gonna be there, aight? Throughout the entire way. You know that, right?”

  Sonya turns back. Some other times, he knew exactly what to say.

  “I know.”

  Sonya feels his hand come to rest on her belly. Hers follow suit. She wondered if the baby, even then, could feel the odd stillness in the air – like the world holding its breath.

  “So… how drunk’s dad right now?”

  “Oh,” Sonya says, blowing a raspberry, and making a drinking motion with her hand, “Already showing my uncles photos of his past camping trips.”

  Peter laughed. And things would be good for a while.

The First Trimester 

  “Scientists are now saying that the early Autumn is actually a sign of warmer Summers to come. Let’s hear more fro- Psshhhhat- I voted for you because I thought you could stop the fires, Mr. President. I thought we’d finally get permanent homes.. WHERE ARE OUR HOMES MR- Psshhhhat- Kyrieee, Eleisooon. Let us join our hands in prayer, and pray for all of those stricken by the new droughts around the world. May God sa- Pssssheu- zzz”

  The front door opens and Sonya turns the television off. She turns around from the sofa, “Did’ja manage to fit the crib in the car, Peter?”

  He pokes his head in, from the side of the living room entrance, the box filled with planks and screws rattling around as he gives that goofy smile. Unsurprisingly, his light grey stubble gives it a goofier quality of sorts.

  “You betcha. Got you those donuts you like so much too.”

  “Thanks, Pete. Just leave them in the kitchen for now.”

  A coat, a sweater, then scarf and beanie were tossed onto the other chair in the living room. Peter sits himself down on the chair with a tired sigh. He was soaked with sweat, and thus adjusted his seating to the edge of the leather.

  “Where’s your dad?” Peter says, cracking open a can of Fanta, and taking a few sips from it, “didn’t see him in his room.”

  “He’s closing shop downtown right now. Not exactly the best time to be running a sauna with… everything that’s happening.”

  “Good on him. The guy could’ve retired a good while back. Poor man deserves a break.”

  “Hey could you also get me o-”

  Peter waves his hands in front of him, and takes out another cold can of soda with a silent ‘tadaa!’

  “Thanks,” Sonya responds flatly, taking the can and cracking it open to drink, “I bet the kids in the Kindergarten love it when you do stuff like that, huh? Are your parents able to make it today?”

  “My mom had to cancel because of some work stuff. Says she’ll come during the later half of dad’s trip though. Dad says he’ll be coming a bit later on tonight. The radiation keeps messing with his GPS or something.”

  “I see.”

  They both take a sip from their cans of drink. Their blinds and curtains were drawn open, allowing filtered light to pour in through the windows. The weather wasn’t hot per se. It was standard for autumn, and perhaps the freshest and cleanest air the two had breathed their entire life – clean as water in the ice caps. But the light was becoming poison. It distilled slower where the two lived, but still it grew in toxicity, day-by-day. Already, they’d given up on painting the walls outside, the paint discolouring under the afternoon sun.

  “Hey, I’ll just put something on the telly while I go whip up something for us to eat, alright?”

  “N-nah, that won’t be necessary I think. Just tune the old radio to something nice for yourself. I haven’t showered yet.”

  The front door opens again, this time, slower steps enter. A voice called out from the entrance, “Finished up at the old place. Found some old photos as well… I think.” His voice was strained, and so Sonya rushed to the door, offering to help him carry his things. It’d only been two months, but not many would’ve guessed, looking at the guy.

  His skin, still bronzed from days of work under the sun, now shone more clearly with the gloss of old age and splotches of white and purple that came with no real reason. The stocky and built frame he had on the day of the wedding had withered away into less meat, and just… less.

  “This is why… dad.. I’ve told you many times to just… bring Peter along with you.”

  The weight turns light as a third person takes the load off for both of them, carrying the box to the other room. 

  “W-when did you tell me that, now? You never said anything about that.”

  “Just this morning, dad. I thought you were going to call him after you were done cleaning up the stall.”

  “A-ah…”

  The silence lasted for a few seconds before Sonya turned on the TV and changed the channel from the religious one, “Which one do you want to watch Pa?”

  “The documentary one. My favourite program should be over already but the one that runs at six is pretty good. They’re showing reruns of Ocean Planet around this time I think.”

  The screen flashed to a shot of a marine mammal – one of many that existed before the surface waters got too hot. This one grew bigger than the many large beasts of land and even the giant squid that emerged since those times before, drawn to the warmer waters above. Narrating it all was a deep and accented man’s voice, carrying with it the awe and reverence the world should have warranted from man. These things were enough already to set the old man into a comfortable haze, slouching back into the couch and watching the drifting currents on the screen. It was left to Sonya to take off the many layers of clothing he still kept on.

  He uttered a small and perfunctory thank you to his daughter before continuing, “I usually hate these broadcasting services. All no-good peddlers of their agenda, fearmongers and the fakest shit you’ve had ever seen in your life. And I’ve lived for my fair share of those. But one thing these guys did right was stopping this show after the honourable man who voiced it all passed on. Hats off to them I say.”

  “Hats off to them,” Sonya agrees.

  The evening ran quick after Peter’s father came. He arrived in his jeep and emerged from the garage.

  “Howdy! Is that Greg watching that show again?”

  “Hey. All goes well, Mateo,” replied Grigor, to his neighbour of many years, from times passed, “Catch anything today?”

  Mateo raises up a blue and white cooler box, “Squid again.”

  They were friends in high school, friends in the military, and then friends again as fathers to the married couple. It was a small world in a big city. And it helped that half the apartments were left derelict and abandoned. They ate, talked and then reminisced for a while longer. The night held the day’s warmth and vigour well. The alcohol helped the two old men much to do this. The heat helped make it difficult for much rest to be found until some hours past midnight.

  And then it was two in the morning. Sonya couldn’t sleep. She just found herself reviewing her case notes in bed. Paying clients paid their lawyers well to do a good job; they paid top dollar to warrant attorneys like Sonya just to simplify and shorten documents for them to read. Patience and attention were rare commodities today — they said it depended on whose parents had switched early from plastic to glass. Most men were stripped of finer intellectual faculties but really, it had been a whole fiasco overblown. There had even been people that warned of the bioaccumulation of microplastics to lead to the extinction of man. No, no, man didn’t go extinct, so things were still good.

  Then it was three in the morning. Sonya shuts her laptop off, feeling her eyelids heavy at last. She had to stop herself from continuing. It was only the coughs of the old men in the other room that stirred her from her nods off.

  She kept the glossy black device under her desk, catching sight of the glow that burnt into the night sky. It was a pretty glow, embers thrown into the atmosphere from the forests and fires of midtown. Sonya smiled. Really, dread was something only afforded to a people that were running out of time to fix a problem. Only tranquility was left to the people of this time.
The Second Trimester

  “Oh my god! Sonya! You’re still so thin, darling! You have got… to eat more,” the lady, equally tall and loud in a floral blouse with naturally curly hair dyed a light brown, started, “Is it him? Is it because Peter starves you? Just tell, m’kay? B’cause I’ve whooped his ass before and I’ll do it again. Lemme te-”

  She trailed on for a good while. And she was certainly a very talkative woman. Her name was Donna. Everyone has that one aunt whom your mother takes you to shop with once or twice a year. Everyone but Peter. That aunt was his mother.

 It was at the tail-end of Autumn now. The leaves that fell were gray and translucent. So was the dirty glass that hid the interior of the showrooms of rows upon rows of bunkers. They varied from the more affordable and functional one-room types that would protect you from the sun unveiled, to the slightly less dull mansionettes that ran for two or three floors, luxury where it could be found these days.

  “How’s about this one now? Looks kind of like the old house, doesn’t it, son?”

  The house Mateo pointed to had a concrete exterior, though it kept a thin lining of wood plastered on the inside. It looked quite homely. It even had a sloped ceiling and those open-layout built-in furniture. It made it look larger than it actually was.

  “It does, pa. I don’t think rustic’s what we’re looking for though.”

  Sonya was clinging to Peter’s side. Maybe it was just her, but she didn’t fancy shopping for housing nowadays. The National Department of Housing and Development and realtors assure the people that such enclosed layouts didn’t pose any dangers to the health of their occupants. 

  And maybe they were right. For years now, people have cloistered themselves in their houses, either living at work or working at home. Food no longer demanded one to step foot in the streets – for day found blistering heat from above, from the rays that had perforated the sky’s fine lining, while night felt that same heat come from cracked concrete skeletons and sticky tarmac. In truth, it had been like this even before the summers had gotten this bad. Ultraviolet showers gave you and your plants everything the sun could – the new normal, people called it. Sonya caressed the now visible bump that showed through her woolen sweater, looking at it. She wondered if her baby would ever get to see a first snow.

  She whispered to Peter, “Hey, honey. I think I need to sit down somewhere for a bit.”

  “S-should I come with?”

  “You go on ahead.”

  Sonya had only begun to walk away from the group when she felt Donna clasp her hands around her arm.

  “Come on. Let’s you an’ me go together then, spend some girl time away from the boys, hmm?”

  They found the display area for the recliner chairs and took their seats there. The store’s speaker systems were playing the amateur-ish voice of a young woman with a difficult accent repeating the deals they had on for the new pay-to-install insulant lining as they sat in silence for some time. Donna did so to give Sonya some rest. Sonya did so, having noticed that Donna already had her phone out with pictures of what she could only assume was yet another baby product. Those moments didn’t last for long, Donna shifting her chair closer to Sonya, and leaning in close to show her a photo of what looked like a small jar of cream.

  “So what you’re gonna want to do is apply this over wh-”

  Sonya snorted, and then began giggling, pulling her hand up to cover her mouth.

  “Ah… I’m sorry dear. It is a bit weird for me to be showing you this he-”

  “No… hahahah- No you’re perfectly good, Mrs Smith. And I’m sorry, Mrs Smith. It’s just you’re the first person whose gotten something for me, and not the baby.”

  On her phone, she was showing an opaque white container of cream, labelled ‘Breastfeeding Ointment’, sealed with a metal lid.

  “Ohh… so you were saying something about how to use it, is that right?”

  “Yes, that’s right dear. So this is for after the pregnancy but I’d suggest stocking up now before things get too bad outside. What you’re gonna want to do is…”

  They talked together about things, Donna sharing some stories Sonya hadn’t heard before during her own pregnancy with Peter.

  “Y’know… I wish that you would just call me mum, after so many years.”

  Sonya lets out a small hiss of air out of her nose, and smiled, staring down, “I know Peter does that for dad already but I think I’ve just gotten way to used to calling you and Mateo, Mr. and Mrs. Smith already.”

  “Ahh know, ah know. Just sayin.”

  The store hummed softly under fluorescent light, nearly empty now. Sonya was still staring at her shoes when she said, “You know you’re my mom, though.”

  And this time, it was Donna’s turn to smile, letting out that sniffling laugh, nodding in response. And they let the moment hang for a bit there, before Donna spoke again, “How’s Greg holding up these days at home?”

  “Oh… well I think he’s still doing fine. He helps around the house quite a bit still, though I am glad we made him close up shop when he did. He forgets the names of people he sees on television a lot of the time now though.”

  Donna opened her mouth to say something but closed it, placing her hand on Sonya’s lap instead, rubbing it.

  “You’re being very strong about all of this business y’know?”

  “Yeah. Maybe not dad’s ex-wife but I do wish a lot of the time that he would have someone who connects with him better to accompany him on his worse days.”

  “Ah know darling. Ah know.”

  The three men came back not long after this. They’d done everything they came to the store to settle that day and were just about ready to head back home.

  They pushed open the door to the airlock connected to the building. It smelt flatly of sweat and warehouse, Peter pulling open the locker to place the radiation poncho on Sonya as it was harder to fit on with the baby. She put on the mask and goggles on herself just fine. And then they left the building to the sheer temperature outside – to streets of barren trees of late fall.

  They stepped out into the late evening. Though it wasn’t light that touched them anymore, no, it was something closer to memory.
The Third Trimester

  The three – Sonya, Grigor and Peter – sat at their couch in the living room. They waited, breaths bated, while they listened to snippets of the conversation the visiting Mateo was having with Donna on the phone. They could only hear his side of it all, and he had done a good job to hide the worry in it.

  “I- I see. Yes, I still have my key to it. Have you checked the garage door? It’s closed right? You’re certain it’s closed… Alright then.”

  The bunker had a rather minimalistic Scandinavian design. Light wooded browns complemented blue fabric furniture and curtains – ones that covered the false sunlight from the outside. It was only a little smaller than Grigor’s house. This was the house Sonya, Peter, and Grigor would live in and prepare for the baby boy that was soon to come a month from then. Mateo and Donna lived in a separate bunker, not too far from theirs, in case anything happened to any one of them, so they could help each other out.

  Peter didn’t say the first words, for he’d already gone to his room. The folks in the living room heard him ruffling through the clothes on hangers in the wardrobe, no doubt looking for his radiation poncho. So Sonya was the first to speak, “Wh- What did she say? Is she fine right now?”

  Mateo’s voice hung grim and low, the kind of gravel that filled the room, “She’s safe, Sonya. She’s in the garage of our bunker and well… It’s still night out.”

  At this, some relief washed over Sonya’s face, her pupils no longer pinpricks. Her sigh was followed by Mateo continuing on, “But she let some young kid, a girl wearing a jacket I think… The girl asked for shelter from Donna when Donna was heading back to the bunker. Donna said all she did was ask her where her parents were. That sent the young girl into all sorts of panic, locking herself inside of the bunker, screaming that she didn’t want to be taken back to her father. She took Donna’s key inside with her.”

  Sonya nodded, her mouth open, “O-okay. If Peter can’t make it back here from your place safely before dawn, please just tell him to stay at your place, okay? Grigor and I will be fine here for a day.”

  Mateo nodded. His poncho was on the coat rack, and began to wear it. Peter came out of the room soon after, already in the silvery coat that reflected the yellow lights of the house in every direction. Sonya saw him packing items in his duffel bag, looking for that one thing he always misplaced somewhere in the house. Sonya saw herself moving to find it – the water bottle that was always in the top cabinet of the kitchen, and always somehow invisible to Peter – handing it to him. Sonya saw an opportunity for her to touch his hands with hers. Peter held it back. Her skin was smooth, and his skin soft with hair. Peter was the one to move his hand away first this time, a rare first, continuing to finish packing everything up for the excursion. 

  Sharp and red – alarms rang in dragged high notes as the button was pushed by Mateo to open the doors to the garage.

  “Use the landline at their place to call me when you get there okay?”

  “I will honey.”

  “What are you gonna do with the girl?”

  “Maybe nothing at all. Hopefully, she would’ve let Mom in by the time we get there.”

  “Maybe.”

  Peter hung close to Sonya, pressing himself against her belly as he kissed her for a good few seconds. He said something about them having more than four times the amount of time needed to get to the bunker, only an hour and a half away, and not to worry so much. The car engine started, its sporadic bursts of activity heard loud and clearly from the living room. The young father was about to leave, until he stopped at the door, hanging on the door frame.

  “Hey, dad! Greg!”

  At this, the man that sat in a grooved and stretchy singlet that sat on the sofa became lucid again, staring up to look at Peter. His face painted with a coat of confusion.

  “You’ll take care of your daughter just fine until I get back, yeah?”

  Nobody said anything for a few seconds. The car the only one that didn’t hold their breaths under the heavy air. 

  “I will, son. That I will.”

  Peter’s face turned into a smile for the first time in an hour as he gave the wall of the living room two last smacks for good luck, “We’ll be off then. See you guys!”

  “Remember to take your boots off before you get into their place! You always forget!”

  And they were gone.

  Sonya found herself pacing around the living room after taking out a book to read initially. The sound of the television could be heard behind her, the deep voice of an old and British knight narrating the hunt of the giant cats of the Serengeti – residents of an old house of cards, folded, waterlogged and burnt now all the same. They were made vagrants, doomed to humble artificial abodes, or made docile to “preserve biodiversity” in bunkers with hairless aliens.

  These were the young days of a new kind of Summer. Tar and varnished wooding are made fuel under the daylight, and signals that combat the surface radiation come and go distorted and warped. Fall, Winter and Autumn are events as the Woolly Mammoth, Dodo and whales are – they all were – things made antiques. People were advised to weather the first five decades of the new era until all the major sources of “difficult fuel” have dried up, enabling folks to reinhabit the surface assuming scientists finish up their discovery of a machine that would stop radioactive decay. This, this and certainly nothing more, had to be the new normal. All things considered, it wasn’t that bad, because they still could be so much worse. The friendly and honeyed words that men on the cable television said that they’d actually been lucky to have been afforded the luxuries of a nuclear energy generator that could be fitted into a storeroom. They were lucky that the miracle tonics and tisanes of the future could save them from the slew of new monsters that emerged from the ice-caps and tiny plastic knives that laced every water source. It might have just been indulgence then, that Sonya found herself wondering if her child would ever grow to see the blue sky of day in his entire life.

  Sonya didn’t know how long she’d been ruminating to herself, the still stagnant nighttime lighting of the bunker giving no indicator. She was only snapped out of it when she had heard her father start to reminisce again, for the first time in weeks at this point, “I served in the Annexation War of Mongolia… before I settled down and had a daughter in the United States.”

  Sonya knew about this one already. He set it up this same specific way each time, leading into the story about how he learned to make milk tea the same way the Mongols did – mixing tea leaves with ox milk, instead of water. She liked it though, and so she listened. He continued, voice interrupted by his phlegm-ruined throat.

  “We came in… from the northern border near Baikal. It took some time before we saw it, but we saw it- it-... all of it was beautiful.”

  The story was different.

  “Golden stalks of grass that carpeted rolling hills and flats as far as the eye could see. All with no tree, nor sea in sight. And above it, lied the clearest, and bluest sky any man could have ever laid their eyes on. It was midday, and so the sun was up high but it didn’t make light of that deepness. There were no oceans there, but the sky still held the reflection of one. Blue skies! As far as my eyes could take me.”

  He recalled all of this, his dried eyes wetting with tears – hands rubbing the fabric of the sofa as if it were a map he was reading. Sonya was the first to speak next.

  “Sir?”

  “Yeah?”

  “May I have your name again? I must have forgotten it.”

  “It’s uhh…”

  Grigor paused there, his voice trailing off as he stared into the distance that didn’t exist – straight into the wooden floor. He looked up again, some shock in his eyes now as he said, “W-wh- why are you crying young lady?”

  “I-it’s nothing. Uhh… You were telling me about your daughter before I think.. Maybe we could continue with that?”

  “No, nonsense. I’ll tell you all about her later. Maybe we could talk about what’s bothering you first, young lady.”

  Sonya knew she shouldn’t try this line of talk right now. Her mouth said differently.

  “I’m… I’m going to become a mother soon, you see? And things are kind of scary right now.”

  “You seem like a perfectly capable young lady. I mean… looking at your place, it looks like you’re doing quite well for yourself.”

  “I was, I- I really was. I worked in a law firm before, and it fetched good money I suppose. I don’t think any of what I learnt translated over here at home though. That’s more of my husband’s thing.”

  “Well! Well there you have it. It sounds like you have yourself a nice husband right? Good family too?”


  “Only the best I could hope for. But I have to take care of my dad as well… And he’s sick.”

  “I can’t speak for you, but it sounds like you’re going to be okay then, right? Your dad raised a fine young lady. I trust you’ll do a fine job taking care of him with your family.”

  “Mmhm.”

  “O-oh no… You’re crying again. Did I say something wrong?”

  “No, no you didn’t. I think I’m just being unreasonably worried right now… my husband’s gone on a trip and I’m worried something will happen to him on the way there. I don’t know what I’m gonna do then.”

  “Mother? Siblings?”

  “It’ll just be me and my dad..”


  The tears couldn’t stop then. They came, choked and interrupted only by stiff inhales through her mucus-caked nostrils. The old man just sat there, the tightest pang of pity in his heart. He didn’t know what he could do to help this nice stranger. This went on for several minutes.

  “I’m just being stupid. He should be reaching there in less than an hour. I-”

  She stopped, and quickly turned to hold her breath and wipe the tears off her face. Grigor’s face had blanked out again at that time. He was staring into a wall this time.

  An hour and a half had passed, then two. Eventually, it was only two hours till dawn. Then the call finally came. The exhausted woman drifted off in her recliner, woken up by the thin strip of red light that flashed urgently from the wall, signalling an incoming call. She’d tripped over the coffee table, almost waking up Grigor in the process trying to get to the button. She pressed the button, and heard nothing but heavy breathing for the first few seconds. Her smile vanished.

  “H-hey did we manage to connect to you guys?”

  “Peter?”

  He sounded muffled and somewhat tired, though it was happiness that Sonya heard cut through, if only for one moment.

  “Sonya, you have to listen to me okay. S-stay where you are. We’re going to be okay, you hear? We’ve contacted the local search and rescue guys and they’re saying they’re gonna make it here so-”

  “Wait… What the fuck happened, Peter?”

  Only his breathing punctuated the silence.

  “... We ran across a patch of melted tarmac. Our truck got stuck, and I don’t think we’re able to make the jump to the side of the freeway. You have to li-”

  “Bring Mateo on the line.”

  Her voice cut off what was bound to be another round of rambling. Hers was a tone so quick and clinical. Details were the only cure for her condition then, breaths hastening, every hair on her body raising all too discernably.

  “Wh- What?”

  “Bring your dad on the line, Peter,” She repeated herself, this time a little more firmly.

  The line clacked and crackled, the device being passed over to the other man there.

  “Hey, is thi-”

  “Mr. Smith, where are you and Peter? I need the precise location shown on your car’s GPS.”

  “GPS’ broken, Sonya. Has been for months now.”

  “DAMN IT, YOU WERE ABLE TO REACH ME RIGHT? J-”

  Sonya wiped the tiny rivulets of sweat off her face and started pacing again, more awake that she had ever been in her entire life. Sicker than she’d ever felt in the mornings so far.

  “Mr. Smith… try. It. Again. And keep me on the line.”

  “I-I will Sonya.”

  Sonya already didn’t waste any time searching for her belongings, taking with her only what she needed for what would be a very fast drive to this freeway. A rustling could be heard from the speakers, Peter on the call now.

  “Sonya, please. We will be fine, the search and rescue will be here before you even get here. What will you do then? How are you even going to reach us? The road is still sticky and actual tar right now. Stay pu-”

  “SHUT THE FUCK UP… Alright? You don’t get to tell me what to do right now. You don’t know if they’ll even reach you in time and there’s more than enough time for me to reach wherever you are and back… Besides, your dad’s truck doesn’t have very good radiation shielding, only ours does.”

  “Sonya… Even with that, it’ll still be at least five hundred x-rays of radiation when day comes. I don’t think Max could handle that.”

  Sonya froze. Max. He’d used the name they’d whispered to each other in the dark, the name no one else knew. The sound of it on his lips now, as a weapon to stop her, made her see white.

  “You don’t ge- You don’t get to use that to tell me not to come! Alright? How fucking dare you use him to make me stay here?! H-”

  Nobody said a word for a while.

  “Mateo. What’s your coordinates? Where are you guys at?”

  “The GPS isn’t working… And the city’s become a fair bit different since the surface closed up. I don’t think you’ll know the way he-”

  “Try me.”

  It was the freeway they’d usually take to pass through the central business district. There were two voices fighting for her attention to get her not to leave but they were silenced with a single button. She was already in a radiation poncho, nearly out the door.

  “Sonya?”

  The voice was weak and sleepy. And it came from the physical space in the living room. A ghost had said them.

  “Dad?”

  “Sonya… where am I?”

  “Dad, you’re home alright. Just stay put. And don’t go anywhere, I have to go no-”

  “Sonya, where are you going?”

  “Outside! Okay?! I have to go fast or else.”

  “Sonya… Please stay. I don’t want to be alone.”

  The words were glass and steel tempered well at the same time; the words were a father’s last sword and shield. One he held rubbing the fabric of the couch in trembling hands – like a soldier that traced the contours of a map.

  Sonya was suddenly aware of everything besides the sights around the bunker. It smelt like piss-soaked diapers, the sound of documentary reruns on the television. And all of this before Max had even been born.

  Day came. Only Sonya and Grigor remained.

  September, the twenty-eighth was Sonya’s original due date; but as Autumn had, Max came early. His first cries punctured the solemnity.




Epilogue

  Scissors snipped as strips of meat, a woman preparing the bird and laying it on plates for a drooling man and herself. In the background, was only the humming of the microwave that warmed a bottle of milk. It dinged as dinner began.

  The woman had to lift both hands of the two boys that sat before their carer then. She said grace – and it was said well.

  Dinner began with a kiss to both cheeks of the men left in the room, Sonya whispering to Max just two words.

  “Happy Thanksgiving.”

1oroig6,https://www.reddit.com/r/nosurf/comments/1oroig6/youre_not_lazy_youre_overstimulated_heres_how_you/,You’re not lazy. You’re overstimulated. Here’s how you can take back control of your life,"Everyone's talking about dopamine detoxes and how modern life is frying our brains. And yeah, there's truth to that. I’ve been trying to rebuild better habits myself and I’ve even been checking out [r/soothfy](https://www.reddit.com/r/soothfy/) here and there since people share simple daily routines that actually feel doable in real life.

But what nobody tells you is: dopamine isn’t the problem, it’s how you’re using it.

Your brain's reward system is actually your best tool for building habits. You just need to stop fighting it and start working with it.

How dopamine actually works (simple version):

Dopamine is anticipation. It's what makes you want to do something, not what makes you enjoy it.

When you get a dopamine hit from scrolling, your brain is predicting a reward. You keep scrolling because your brain keeps expecting the next post to be good.

You can hijack this same system to make good habits addictive.

How to use dopamine to build habits:

Make the reward immediate and visible  
Let’s say you work out today, but the results show up in 3 months. Your brain sees no reward, so it doesn't want to repeat the behavior. To fix this create immediate micro-rewards. Check off a box, move a marble to a “done” jar, give yourself a literal gold star. Sounds childish, but your brain loves it. Dopamine responds to immediate feedback. Visual progress = dopamine hit = want to do it again tomorrow.

Stack boring habits before things you actually want  
Make your bed, then check your phone  
Do 10 pushups, then have coffee  
Read one page, then watch Netflix  
Your brain starts associating the boring habit with the upcoming reward. Eventually, starting the boring habit itself triggers dopamine.

Track weekly wins, not perfect streaks  
Breaking a streak feels like failure, so you give up entirely. Instead of tracking streaks, track how many times you do something per week. You still get the dopamine from progress without the all-or-nothing pressure that makes you quit.

Celebrate the start, not just the finish  
Put on gym clothes is a win. Opening the book is success. If the start feels good, your brain will crave starting more often.

Make it satisfying, not just productive  
If you hate the habit, your brain will avoid it forever. Find the version that feels good now, not someday in the future.

Use temptation bundling  
Only listen to your favorite podcast while exercising  
Only watch your show while meal prepping  
Only have that nice coffee while working on your side project  
Your brain will start craving the hard habit because it leads to something enjoyable.

Your brain is designed to repeat behaviors that feel rewarding. If your habits don’t feel rewarding, your brain won’t want to repeat them.

Living in the US, we're surrounded by tempting, processed foods, and our busy schedules often leave us too exhausted for the gym. For years, I struggled with the cycle: strong start, inevitable burnout, and the dreaded **plateau** that lasts forever. I needed an edge, but I refused to take those high-caffeine ""diet pills"" that made me feel like my heart was racing.

I started looking for a **natural, stimulant-light** solution that could truly help manage the *root causes* of weight gain: **cravings** and a **slow metabolism**. That's how I found the **KeySlim Drops** liquid formula.

# 2. Why This Liquid Formula Works (The Science)

The advantage of a liquid drop is two-fold: easier absorption and a specific focus on natural metabolism boosters. This formula contains several high-impact ingredients often mentioned in positive reviews:

* **African Mango Extract:** This is key for natural **appetite suppression** and helping manage blood sugar swings that lead to junk food cravings. This made the biggest difference in my daily adherence.
* **Green Coffee Bean Extract:** Provides a gentle, natural metabolic boost through chlorogenic acid, supporting fat oxidation *without* the high caffeine jitters of roasted coffee.
* **B Vitamins (B6 & B12) & Zinc:** Essential for **energy metabolism**. These helped turn the food I ate into usable energy, rather than stored fat, which eliminated my afternoon energy dips.

# 3. My Honest 4-Week Results and Transformation

I've been using the drops consistently every morning before breakfast.

* **Week 1:** The most immediate change was the **control over my cravings**. I could walk past the office donuts or the snack aisle without feeling compelled to indulge.
* **Week 2-3:** I noticed a clear, sustainable increase in energy that helped me power through my workouts. The best part? **Zero jitters, no crashes.**
* **Week 4:** The scale finally moved past the 6-week plateau I was stuck on. I saw a noticeable reduction in belly fat and felt lighter and more confident. The simplicity of the liquid drops made adherence effortless.

This formula isn't a miracle, but it's the most effective **natural tool** I've found to support diet and exercise. It provided the metabolic kick and appetite control I needed to win the daily battle against cravings.

# 4. Take Control of Your Metabolism (The Direct CTA and Link)

If you're in the US and looking for a simple, natural way to support your weight loss goals, curb your toughest cravings, and boost your metabolism without the side effects of traditional pills, I highly recommend watching the presentation on the KeySlim Drops formula.

How many times have you started a recipe, full of excitement, only to hit a wall that says ""finely diced onions"" or ""1 cup of chopped nuts""? Ten minutes later, your cutting board is a mess, your eyes are watering, and your motivation is gone.

We've all been there. But what if I told you there's a single tool that can handle that job in ten seconds? Not just that, but a tool that can make dough, pesto, hummus, veggie burgers, and even baby food?

That tool is the **food processor**, and it’s the single most underrated piece of equipment in the modern home kitchen.

## It's More Than a Chopper: What a Food Processor *Really* Does

Most people think a **food processor** is just for chopping vegetables. That's like saying a car is just for driving to the grocery store. It’s true, but it completely misses the point.

Here’s a quick rundown of the magic you can unlock:

- **Chopping & Dicing:** From onions and garlic to carrots and celery. It's the ultimate time-saver for your soup bases and mirepoix.
- **Slicing & Shredding:** Many models come with discs that can perfectly slice potatoes for gratins or shred a block of cheese in seconds. No more knuckle-grating.
- **Making Dough & Batters:** Yes, you read that right. A good **food processor** can mix pizza dough, pie crust, or even cookie dough in under a minute.
- **Creating Dips & Spreads:** Hummus, pesto, guacamole, tapenades. If you can blend it, a **food processor** can make it smoother and faster than manual methods.
- **Pureeing & Grinding:** Turn steamed veggies into silky purees for soups or sauces. Grind your own nut flours, breadcrumbs, or coffee beans.

> **Community Pro Tip:** When making something like pesto, don't just dump everything in at once. Start with the garlic and nuts, pulse to chop them, then add the greens and cheese, and finally, slowly drizzle in the oil while the blade is running. This creates a much better texture.

## The Classic Debate: Food Processor vs. Blender

This is the most common question I get, and the answer is simpler than you think. They are not interchangeable. They are teammates.

👉 [Click here to check the product on Amazon](https://starton.pages.dev//?q=food%20processor)

Think of it this way:

- A **blender** is all about *liquids*. It uses high speed and a vortex to pull ingredients down into its sharp blades, perfect for smoothies, soups, and sauces.
- A **food processor** is all about *solids*. It uses a wider, flatter bowl and a slower, more powerful motor with a pulsing function. It’s designed to cut, chop, and mix without turning everything into a liquid puree.

You can make hummus in both, but the **food processor** will give you a better, grainier texture. You can make a smoothie in a **food processor**, but you’ll probably struggle and have to add way too much liquid. My advice? If you have the counter space, get both. But if you have to choose one, the **food processor** offers far more versatility for a wider range of cooking tasks.

## Finding the Right Food Processor for *Your* Kitchen

Not all food processors are created equal. Choosing the right one depends entirely on how you cook.

👉 [Click here to check the product on Amazon](https://starton.pages.dev//?q=food%20processor)

### Size Matters: Compact, Full-Size, and Everything In-Between

- **Compact / Mini Food Processors (3-5 cups):** Don't sleep on these. If you're a single person, a couple, or just need to chop garlic, make a small batch of pesto, or grind some nuts, this is a game-changer. They're easy to store and clean.
- **Full-Size Food Processors (8-14 cups):** This is the workhorse. If you cook for a family, do a lot of batch cooking, or want to make dough, this is your pick. The larger capacity means you won't have to process in multiple batches.

### The ""I Wish I'd Known Sooner"" Feature to Look For

Beyond the basics of power and capacity, here is the one feature that separates a good **food processor** from a great one: **multiple cutting discs.**

Most basic models come with one standard S-shaped chopping blade. But a truly versatile machine will come with a set of discs. Look for one with at least:

- A reversible shredding/slicing disc.
- A julienne disc for creating matchstick vegetables.
- A French fry disc (if you're into that).

👉 [Click here to check the product on Amazon](https://starton.pages.dev//?q=food%20processor)

These discs turn tedious prep work into a task that takes literally seconds. Being able to shred a head of cabbage for coleslaw or slice ten potatoes for a gratin in under a minute is a feeling that never gets old.

## Level Up Your Cooking Game with a Food Processor

If you’re still on the fence, just consider this: a **food processor** doesn't just save you time. It removes the barriers that make complex recipes feel intimidating.

Want to try making your own ravioli from scratch? The **food processor** makes the filling and the dough.

Want to start making your own veggie burgers to cut down on waste? The **food processor** binds all the ingredients perfectly.

It empowers you to try new things and cook more often because it takes the drudgery out of prep. It’s not just a tool; it’s an invitation to become a more creative and confident cook. If you take your time in the kitchen seriously, it's time to let a **food processor** take some of the work off your hands.",1,1762605606.0,bestkitchentool,0,1.0,False

While tolerance toward four-legged companions is growing rapidly in Georgia finding a truly doп-friendly spot can be quite a quest. So here are some good places, me and my 2-year-old aussie have approved.

The first one is Gabriadze Cafe, a legendary place on Shavteli 13, created by great Georgian playwright Rezo Gabridze (eponymous theatre is near). The interior is curious and the atmosphere is very calm, we love this place. You may notice a tiny door at the entrance - it's specially for restaurateurs little Pomeranian. So yes, they really love dogs here :)

Another good choice is Chaduna on Tabidze street - it's literally an old apartment, very calm place, full of Tbilisi signature charm - soulful mix of the old school and contemporary. Oh, and they also have snack for dogs (it's a rare thing here).

Right behind the corner is Black Dog Bar - officially the first dog-friendly venue in Tbilisi, classical craft beer, simple snacks. Local stray dogs often come here to warm up and chill - they're absolutely nice, but if your dog's more of an introvert, this might not be their scene.

Move on. There are two cute places near loud Rustaveli ave - Erti Kava, a cozy coffee shop, and Stamba Cafe, which is part of eponymous hotel (built in a former print house, it has magnificent postindustrial inetriors).

If you're in Vake, check out Kikliko and CHITI, and don't forget the dogs playground in Vake park - it's a gem!

# Choosing Coffee Beans

Choosing the right coffee beans is the first step to making a great cup at home. The beans affect every part of the flavor and aroma. Knowing how to pick quality beans helps you enjoy coffee that suits your taste.

# Bean Quality And Origin

High-quality beans come from reputable farms. The origin plays a big role in flavor. Coffee from different countries has unique tastes. For example, beans from Ethiopia often have fruity notes. Beans from Brazil tend to be nutty and chocolatey. Choose beans that match the flavor you enjoy.

# Freshness And Roast Date

Freshness is key for good coffee. Look for beans with a clear roast date on the package. Fresh beans give brighter and richer flavors. Avoid beans that are too old or stale. Grinding beans just before brewing keeps the coffee flavorful and aromatic.

# Single Origin Vs Blends

Single origin beans come from one place. They offer distinct and pure flavors. Blends mix beans from different regions. They create balanced and complex tastes. Pick single origin to explore unique flavors. Choose blends for a smooth and consistent cup.

# Water Matters

Water is the main ingredient in coffee. Its quality and temperature shape your coffee’s flavor.

Pure, clean water helps bring out the best taste in your brew. Bad water can ruin good beans.

Paying attention to how much water you use matters too. The right amount balances strength and flavor.

# Water Quality And Filtration

Use fresh, clean water free of strong odors or tastes. Tap water often contains minerals and chemicals.

These can change coffee flavor and mask the bean’s natural notes. Filtering water removes many impurities.

A simple charcoal or carbon filter improves taste without costing much. Avoid distilled water; it lacks minerals needed for extraction.

# Ideal Water Temperature

Heat water between 195°F and 205°F for best results. Too hot water burns coffee, making it bitter.

Too cool water leads to weak, sour coffee. Boil water, then wait 30 seconds before brewing.

This range helps extract flavors evenly and fully. Consistent temperature keeps your coffee tasting great every time.

I like to have it at .8oz, full strength, with body strong. I keep my grinder on setting two from the finest.

Now, here is where it really shines. Use it for other drinks if you want them stronger and more coffee forward. It will be a two a step process, but if you want to make stronger milk drinks and Americano's, it might be worth it to you. Want a stronger Latte Macchiato? Dispense frothed milk, then add a single or dual ristretto shot into it depending on the size drink you are making. For Americano's, dispense a single or dual ristretto and then add hot water. Same for a cortado. Dual ristretto and steamed milk. Play around with different recipes depending on the size of drink you want and see what you think.

If anyone’s up for meeting for a coffee, a walk, or a tech chat (or even a random discussion about life in Birmingham), I’d really appreciate it.

Thanks for reading, and I’d love to hear your suggestions or even join any social or language groups you know about.",4,1762604739.0,BirminghamUK,0,1.0,False

1oro4k4,https://www.reddit.com/r/ProductAmazon/comments/1oro4k4/why_is_my_backpacking_stove_leaking_fuel/,Why is my backpacking stove leaking fuel?,"Hey everyone,

So I've been dealing with a frustrating problem lately – my backpacking stove kept leaking fuel. If you're here reading this, chances are you're having the same issue. Trust me, I get it. There's nothing worse than getting to your campsite and realizing your gear isn't working right.

Let me share what I learned after troubleshooting this problem for weeks.

**The Most Common Reasons Your Stove Leaks**

First thing I checked was the O-rings and seals. These little rubber pieces wear out over time, especially if you use your camping stove a lot. They get dried out, cracked, or just plain old. If your stove is a few years old, this is probably your issue.

Next up – cross-threading. I hate admitting this, but I was screwing the fuel canister on wrong sometimes. When you're tired after hiking all day, it's easy to force things at the wrong angle. Always make sure everything lines up straight before you tighten it.

Dirt and debris can also cause leaks. Even tiny particles on the connection point can prevent a good seal. I started wiping down the threads and connection areas before each trip, and it made a huge difference.

**Temperature Problems**

Here's something I didn't know at first – extreme cold or heat affects how your portable camping stove works. Cold weather can make seals brittle, while heat can cause pressure issues inside fuel canisters. If you're camping in rough conditions, this might be your problem.

**When It's Time for a New Stove**

Sometimes your gear is just done. I fought with my old stove for way too long before accepting it was time to upgrade. If you've tried everything and it's still leaking, it might be safer to get a new one rather than risk a fuel leak during your trip.

I spent a bunch of time researching reliable options that don't leak, and I found some solid choices here: https://athomewave.com/backpacking-stove

**Quick Fixes to Try First**

Before you replace anything, try these:

- Replace all O-rings and gaskets (you can usually buy these separately)
- Clean all connection points with rubbing alcohol
- Check for visible cracks in the fuel line or stove body
- Make sure your fuel canister isn't damaged
- Test the stove at home before your trip

**Safety First**

Real talk – fuel leaks are dangerous. If you smell gas or see liquid fuel anywhere it shouldn't be, don't light that stove. It's not worth risking a fire or explosion just to boil water. Always test your outdoor cooking equipment in a well-ventilated area before heading into the backcountry.

**My Final Thoughts**

After dealing with this headache, I learned that regular maintenance is key. Check your stove before every season, replace worn parts, and keep everything clean. A good quality backpacking stove should last years if you take care of it.

If your current setup keeps giving you problems even after trying these fixes, it's probably time to look at newer models. The technology has improved a lot, and modern lightweight stoves are way more reliable than older ones.

Although i'm sure the title is by no means controversial, I still want to expand on my point. 

I've always been insecure. That's nowhere near new. Ever since i was 6 years old and i began to observe the people around me, i compared myself to them to the point it was bordering on obsession - their mannerisms, personalities, the way they carried themselves etc. I didn't understand why i felt so disconnected from the people around me, what made me so different, and how to get rid of that nauseating wrongness that radiated from my entire being. Painstakingly, i changed myself. I copied their habits, the way they carried themselves, to the point i felt like a self-made chameleon. 

But it wasn't enough. Once i got my act down, i began to obsess over physical aspects as well. It's like... whenever i get rid of a problem, my brain goes on and creates another one, like it *needs* an obsession to cling onto. 

Same story. I lost weight until my hair started falling out and i lost my period. Granted, i was never fat or even chubby to begin with, my starting weight being 44 kilos. 

My issue lies within the fact that... people ADORED my sick and underweight body. I kept a public instagram account for friends and acquaintances, and one of the photos i posted when i was at my lowest blew up. 

I got tons of dm's from creeps and other guys (even girls), tons of likes and comments, and it just made me angry. I was wearing long blouses and jeans IN AUGUST. My arms and feet were turning purple from how col i was. My life was plagued by chronic fatigue and digestive issues. I hated it so, so much, but i couldn't let go of it. And people LIKED that. 

I got the most attention when i was 80 pounds. EIGHTY pounds. Maybe even less, i stopped weighing myself after a point. I was smoking a pack of cigarettes a day and downing black coffee until I was shaking. Hell, people ENCOURAGED me. I was constantly told that i looked so beautiful, so elegant and ""tiny"". 

I looked like a child. My face was sunken and my cheeks were hollow. I felt like a shell of a person, i wasn't even engaging in my hobbies anymore because of how drained i felt.  

How am i supposed to get better if everyone around me only encourages me to get sicker? I guess the only option left is to run away and become a hermit somewhere in the mountains. ",1,1762604705.0,offmychest,4,1.0,False

1oro0k1,https://www.reddit.com/r/motherinlawsfromhell/comments/1oro0k1/my_inlaws_ignored_my_son_on_his_2nd_birthday_do_i/,"My in-laws ignored my son on his 2nd birthday, do I have to ever forgive them?","My mother in-law has been a challenge I was willing to tackle for 6 years, but things have escalated beyond my comprehension. My husband has a child from a prior relationship, and when we started dating (again, we dated for a short bit in college) I found it intense how often my now MIL wanted to talk badly about his ex-girlfriend. My MIL created enough tension in my husband’s relationship with his child’s mother after they had their baby that they went no contact for a year. She told me about it herself, multiple times, highlighting her disdain for his ex-girlfriend. Red flags were flying, but my husband warned me she just loved to yap and to ignore it. He’s a great guy so some things are bearable, what started to rub me the wrong way was when MIL started spending time with his ex-girlfriend and her grandchild (their child together). They would go shopping for clothes for grandchild, pedicures, and lunches out. All paid by my MIL under the guise of “school clothes shopping.” I was never invited, or asked about it.

Lots of meet ups with the ex-girlfriend to pick up and drop off our daughter, so sometimes people run a little late. His ex started calling my MIL to complain if my husband ran late, ironically he works full time in a respectable field while his ex-girlfriend was unemployed starting up freelance photography. He travels for work A LOT, the fact that he can schedule down to the quarter hour like she requests is down right incredible accommodation and cooperation on his end in the first place. His mother would then call us, both, one after another to let us know both her and his ex’s displeasure. This continued even after we had a baby together, which we felt deserved a bit of grace if we were loading a car up with 2 kids to meet his ex-girlfriend who needed to get herself only to point B. She too, had had her fair share of running late so complaining about it is hypocritical.

There are quite literally so many micro aggressions I could post about, so I’ll try to keep it to main points. My pregnancy was hard, I was diagnosed with polyhydramnios (way too much amniotic fluid) and pregnancy-induced cholestasis (basically third trimester liver failure and the baby being delivered is the only thing to stop it). My baby was in the NICU 9 days, and we returned home for the first time on the 10th day, I had a C-section so I was overwhelmed with joy to be comfy and with my family. Insert, MIL from hell… two days after being home my MIL came to my house to pick up my (step) child. She said they were going “school clothes shopping,” which I knew exactly who she was going to meet with, husband’s ex-girlfriend. Child didn’t want to go, because the new baby was exciting. MIL started raising her voice about how she should just go all by herself, get her nails done by herself, have a day she deserves with a coffee and all sorts of bullshit, going off on a 6 year old. In my home, while I’m holding my newborn. Horrified, I watched them finally leave, my (step) child crying and reluctant. I knew this was not normal at all at that point.

It came to a head for me after years of manipulation when they planned a photo shoot with my son behind my back. My father in law picked up my son for the day to spend time together, which was normal. A month prior, we all went to a school performance for step child where my MIL sat next to my husbands ex, and I heard them yapping about an upcoming photography session she was offering. My MIL liked to pester me to take the kids to get photos done by my husband’s ex, she would tell me it’s healthy for my step child to see us getting along. Overbearing, considering she is nasty, spiteful, and speaks horribly of her ex-husband of 27 years ago… and she is seemingly happily remarried. I obliged earlier that year with some Christmas photos, so I was a little surprised when she didn’t hound me to sign up for this session. Doing it behind my back seemed more fun! My husband’s ex went to their house with her child to take pictures of the two of them together. It was without my knowledge until my stepchild mentioned a few days later that she had gone and seen her brother and took photos with mommy. I furiously sent a text to my MIL about how I was done being treated like garbage, and my step child notices it’s unequal how I never get invited and it’s inappropriate. The next day I had a 3 hour phone call with my father in law, where he tore me to shreds. I am basically not the type of daughter in law they want, so my MIL is entitled to act nasty upon her opinions in their eyes. They gave my husband an heirloom vintage ring for my wedding ring, which the jeweler who repaired it for me (yep, we had to repair a snapped band… I believe this was another sign of her growing resentment of me) told me it was not for daily wear. My father in law demanded it back because I didn’t wear it enough. It has been 6 months since I have spoken to them, and they have called my husband twice to argue. He does not contact them either.

My son’s birthday was 3 months ago. Formerly involved aunts and uncles on his dad’s side are no contact with us now over my argument with my in laws, but I was surprised when nobody reached out to even say happy birthday. I was too nervous to navigate a birthday party, so we had a small gathering at my mom’s house with minimal birthday pizazz. My in-laws didn’t call or send a card to say happy birthday, but gave gifts to my step child at her mother’s house for her birthday. It just doesn’t add up to me, it feels like they are now treating my son like he isn’t their grandchild to punish me. I think I never want to speak to them again, but my husband could make amends and he could visit with the children for their sakes. He has no desire to speak to them either at this time. My MIL regularly sees my step child at her mothers house and remains in contact with my husbands ex, and husbands ex is now treating me cold. What do I do next?

Struggling to find that perfect spark for your next track? No worries! Getting cool ideas doesn't have to be a drag. Here are a few simple tips with a little wink:

* **Ears Open, World In:** Imagine your life is a movie and you're collecting soundbites. Listen in on conversations (subtly, of course 😉), a funny sound, or a catchy phrase. Boom, there's your next song title or hook!
* **Your Life is the Party:** Who needs fiction when your own life is the coolest story? Whether it's heartbreak, a high five moment, or the struggle with the coffee machine – write about it! Authentic is always the most awesome.
* **Bookworm Meets Beatmaker:** Treat yourself to a good movie, a novel, or check out some art. Characters, quotes, or moods can give you the perfect vibe for your song. 🍿
* **Instrument Swap Shop:** Grab a ukulele instead of your guitar, or try a totally weird chord progression. A little chaos often creates the coolest melodies. Think outside the box!
* **Just Do It!:** Don't wait for the perfect idea; it usually hits you when you're in the shower anyway. Just start writing without overthinking. The first draft is rarely perfect, but perfectly imperfect for building on! ✍️
* **The Idea Vault:** Always have a notebook (or your phone) ready to go. Ideas are like popcorn – they pop up everywhere. Be ready to catch them before they're gone!

With these tricks, you'll be the idea-catcher-in-chief, and your tracks will just pour out! Have fun grooving! 🥳

Grief is never invited, but it comes by anyway 

Grief is faceless, but always recognisable

Grief peers over my shoulder when I’m ascending the elevator to work, or in the steam of my morning cup of coffee 

Grief is in the eyes of my loved ones, reflected back at me, ruminating from their loving hugs 

Grief lives all around me, sometimes it’s very loud and refuses to be ignored or made numb. It also likes to visit on a quiet day, tip toeing inside for a brief moment, or in the faces of passing strangers on the tube. 

Grief is the pangs in my belly when I hear my dad’s favourite songs while doing the laundry. It is my tear stains on my husband’s shirt while he holds me in my darkest hours. 

Grief never learnt boundaries, it frequents my dreams and disrupts my waking day conversations. Grief wriggles under my shower curtain and plonks itself right on my nose. 

Grief is a party of two, forever entwined, cupping my hand and always my invisible plus one (just in case it wishes to join).
