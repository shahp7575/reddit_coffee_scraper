They are now charging less to riders and pass it on to the drivers. As long as you guys keep excepting every ride for your beloved tier level which is a gimmick then nothing will change ever! I‚Äôve noticed that most rides pay way less now because what they charge the rider plus promotions is less than before. Even with a surge it sucks. I have standard mode, no tier, and I get same ride offers you do but I decline any that aren‚Äôt worth it. It constantly pings me to drive 9 miles to drop off 2 miles away! Yeah I‚Äôm not doing it! Bar hopping trips make more! Long trips definitely not worth it unless you‚Äôre going that way. Did mostly airport runs yesterday because every ride was to the airport then back and with tips made them little over a $1 a mile. Only good thing is I‚Äôm only a mile from airport pick up. Lyft charges more but still pays drivers less. Uber charges less therefore pays little also. All long trips that1 hour plus usually are not worth it unless a good tip. But I checked a reservation the other day from Jax beach to Orlando airport was $95! I was doing that for $145 months ago and then it wasn‚Äôt really worth it but would get a $55-$70 airport ride after then stay to work. This was months ago. That $95 ride was $160 for the pax! They are competing with Lyft, cabs, and private drivers! Best thing you can do is start with surges, use the coffee cup on every ride, and then stop new request when the coffee cup is gone!

1ktkbkn,https://www.reddit.com/r/socialskills/comments/1ktkbkn/how_to_make_friends_especially_with_women_as_a/,"How to make friends, especially with women as a guy (24m)","I‚Äôve been struggling to make friends, especially since I‚Äôve moved to the UK (as a non-white guy, if that matters). I would consider myself as easy-going, friendly, fun to be with since I‚Äôve got loads of hobbies that I think are fun and cool (wildlife photography and filmmaking , hiking, climbing, cooking). I don‚Äôt really have an issue with running or carrying a conversation. But I‚Äôve just been doubting myself if I‚Äôm really all of these things, or if I‚Äôm likeable at all since I‚Äôm having issues making friends or d@ting (getting d@tes to begin with, but that‚Äôs a different story altogether). 

I joined a bouldering gym to solve this problem of not having friends, since I also enjoy climbing and am decent at it. It‚Äôs been about 3 months since I‚Äôve been a regular there, and I know a lot of people now that I see there every week. We exchange polite smiles and some small talk, or in the moment climbing talk. But I‚Äôm struggling to take it outside of the climbing centre. I‚Äôm looking for friends in general, but also female friends since I find that dynamic to be different than with guy friends. 

I‚Äôve tried to get a few Instagrams after meeting the same person at the climbing gym a few times, and I‚Äôve tried to initiate plans that are non-climbing, outside of a climbing centre, like getting a coffee and going for a walk. However, I‚Äôve not received positive responses. 

Even at the climbing centre, people seem to be more polite friendly than friends friendly. As in, you can‚Äôt feel a bond or a connection, it‚Äôs just something like ‚Äúin the moment talk‚Äù, and that‚Äôs it. I feel more empty when I come home since I feel that the person I talked to today can potentially be a friend, but the next time I see them it‚Äôs not the same - they might talk or may not, or just smile politely from a distance. It never goes anywhere, it all feels fake, just ‚Äúpolite‚Äù or an ‚Äúin the moment thing that doesn‚Äôt mean anything‚Äù.

I especially feel this with women. I‚Äôve met a few girls there, but I never really know where I stand with them. Sometimes they seem friendly at the climbing centre, sometimes not so much (the same girls). I‚Äôve tried to initiate plans with them outside of the climbing centre, but they always make up an excuse that they‚Äôre busy, and it doesn‚Äôt go anywhere. But then I‚Äôd see them again a few days later at the climbing gym and they‚Äôd be friendly, which then leaves me confused. It‚Äôs so hard to tell if someone likes you or not, or where I stand with them. Some of these women that I‚Äôm talking about in this post have bfs and are older than me, they know I‚Äôm not hitting on them as that has been indirectly cleared up before as I‚Äôve known them for about 2 months now through climbing. I really just want to be friends and do fun things together on weekends and stuff. 

So my question is, how do I make friends, especially with women as a guy (24m)

(I‚Äôve heard a lot about British people being polite but not friendly, often cold and too individualistic, and foreign people always being confused about where exactly you stand with them. Is this true, and how do I navigate this?)",2,1748008868.0,socialskills,1,1.0,False

Friday, June 6:
Arrive in NYC/our hotel around 6 pm. We will probably just hit up the hotel restaurant for dinner. Looking for an evening drink spot in this neighborhood?

Saturday June 7 
We plan on going to Levain Bakery (or any other amazing coffee shops??) in the morning and wandering SoHo. 
We have to be in Brooklyn at 11 for a pizza walking tour. This will take us to around 2 pm. 

After this we plan on walking back over the Brooklyn bridge to get back to manhattan. Afterwards we plan on going to the Dead Rabbit pub for a snack/beer, and afterwards the WTC monument. I imagine we will be beat after this, so we will probably head back to the hotel to rest. 

Looking for a good restaurant suggestion for Saturday night as I should probably be booking a reso now? Anywhere near our hotel or within 15 min walk. 

Sunday, June 8

This day will be spent mostly in the West Village. 

We plan to start the day walking down the Highline. After that we will wander to the village and maybe stop at Washington Square Park. 

We are doing lunch at Carbone. 

Looking for spots to check out during the afternoon in the village area? Must-see streets? Any patios that we should try to hit up?

Dinner is at Emily Burger followed by a comedy club. 

Monday, June 9

We plan on spending this up in Midtown. Central Park, shopping, maybe Times Square.

1ktk93m,https://www.reddit.com/r/JapanTravelTips/comments/1ktk93m/trip_report_may_2025/,Trip report - May 2025,"18 days - 3rd May to 21st.

Tokyo > Kyoto > Hiroshima/Miyajima > Kiso valley > Tokyo

  
I'll start with the not so great:

  
1. Unplan Shinjuku was not a great start to the trip for me, even with staying in a private room. There was a ratio of about 9/1 men to women in this hostel and even as a bloke, that energy made me uncomfortable. Most of the guys were in Japan just to go out on the pull. It's the first time I've stayed in a hostel and not made any connections with anyone of substance and I stayed over two legs for a total of 6 days. The staff were also indifferent/miserable and constantly faffing about cordoning off the outdoor area where nearly all the social activity was occurring. They even threatened to call the police (on their own guests) because a few people were smoking/hanging in this area very shortly after the curfew which wasn't very clear flagged. 

2. Humidity, even at this time of year, was borderline too much for me on a couple of days, probably not helped by a mild cold pretty much the entire trip and obviously a lot of walking. I'm pretty fit and slim but coming from the UK can't really handle heat and humidity. I would personally completely avoid summer in Japan based on this.

3. Every other person, local or foreigner, was coughing and sneezing. From the minute I arrived I felt my throat going but somehow managed to avoid it escalating until about the last 3 days of my trip and was pretty lucky it didn't get that bad. I wore an N95 mask sometimes on the subway and trains but eventually gave up as I could barely breath with it on. In Hiroshima Peace Museum there was someone absolutely coughing their guts up non stop for about 10 minutes and it was really, really hard for me to keep from shouting ""shut the f up and go home!"". Going to such a public and cramped space in that state is relationship ending behaviour for me, so utterly selfish and irresponsible. 

4. Fatigue - I was going at it 110% on this trip but operating on about 60-75% of power most days due to insufficient rest. You seriously need to build in rest days, at least 1-2 days per week lazing about and lying in.

5. Hakone was not worth the bother for a day trip, even with clear views of Fuji. It seems like you really need to know exactly where you're going here to get anything out of it. I went on a pretty bad and rushed group tour too.

6. Miyajima Aquarium - most animals showing signs of stress. I would avoid.

  
The good:

  
1. I didn't have a bad meal, coffee or ice cream the entire trip and I wasn't even that discerning about where I went. I would go as far as saying the coffee and ice cream compete with Italy, where I visit a lot being part Italian.

2. I got lost in Tokyo station for a while, but didn't have any issues with public transport on any level. Coming back to the UK is particularly hard on this front. How can we know Japan exists and just go ""this will do"" with our own trains and buses?

3. Miyajima for the night was a nice little escape. Still very busy, but definitely worth doing if you visit Hiroshima and it takes the edge off the whole atom bomb aspect which runs the risk of putting you in a bad frame of mind for a day.

4. Even when it is crazy busy, throughout Japan I had this constant sense of underlying serenity - there was no mania, aggression or conflict (which are defining features of life in the UK now) and even in Tokyo I could find quiet places - Yanaka Ginza and Nippori generally for example, where I spent about 30 minutes just walking around a graveyard on my own in the rain.

5. Service, again in contrast to the UK, was 9 times out of 10 excellent. Attentive, friendly and thorough,

6. I read a lot about the CEO in this sub but I found the two APA hotels I briefly stayed at better than any budget hotel I have stayed at. Really well kitted out.

7. As a solo traveller, I never felt lonely even while I had very few lasting social connections on the trip. On Europe trips for example, particularly in the evenings, I usually have at least one or two days where it's pretty lonely. I suppose part of this was down to how novel every day was and the general level of sensory stimulation not allowing those feelings to set in.

8. Unwittingly taking a long and unnecessary walk through some suburban areas and country lanes in Kyoto on my way to Jingo-ji was one of the more memorable aspects of my trip. It made getting to the temple feel more earned. 

  
Specific tips:

1. Shinkansen - either get physical tickets on the day or better, buy them in advance via the Smart Ex website and designate your IC card to them on the site, which makes it just as easy as using the subway. \*Do not bother with QR codes which procedurally confuses things and I believe may not even work at all at times.\*

2. If you do the above, you could probably get to Tokyo, Kyoto and Nagoya stations about 20 minutes before your train departs. I was initially allowing about an hour or more as I was so scared of getting lost or messing something up but it wasn't necessary. Shinkansen gates and platforms are really easy to find.

3. Have at least a couple of days just wandering off the beaten path - get on Yamanote line in Tokyo and just get off at a stop you like the sound of.

4. Try to avoid too many hotel changes. I had 7 over 18 days which was particularly annoying for trying to be strategic about lying in vs early starts.

5. HAVE SOME PROPER REST DAYS.

# The Why: #Fitat50andBeyond

About two years ago, I sat down to think about doing something meaningful to celebrate turning 50 in 2024. I didn‚Äôt want it to be just another vacation or a party. I wanted to do something I could look back on with pride ‚Äî something that would push me, shape me, and stay with me. That‚Äôs how the idea for¬†*#Fitat50andBeyond*¬†was born.

The plan was ambitious but exciting. First, a cycle expedition from Srinagar to Leh (India)in September 2024. Then, [the Malnad Ultra 50K (India)](https://www.instagram.com/p/DCvaiB_S3q2/) in November. In January 2025, I hit a personal best of 3:33 at the [Tata Mumbai Marathon](https://www.strava.com/activities/13392895105). And then, for the final act ‚Äî one that would test every facet of endurance ‚Äî I signed up for [Ironman 70.3 Alcudia-Mallorca](https://www.ironman.com/races/im703-mallorca) in Spain.

I knew it wouldn‚Äôt be easy. The bike course in Mallorca is famously hilly, but the island‚Äôs beauty, the community vibe, and the promise of a beachside finish made it irresistible. The format was classic: a 1.9K swim in the calm blue waters of Alc√∫dia Bay, a 90K bike ride through Mallorca‚Äôs winding climbs and descents, and a 21.1K flat run along the beachfront.

Coming off a strong showing in Mumbai, I had around 12 weeks to train for the triathlon, balancing swim, bike, run, and strength work. It meant about 10 hours of training per week amidst work, life, and everything else. The real power, I realised, was in showing up consistently. I made sure to get in two weekly strength and mobility sessions at Quad, which played a big role in keeping me injury-free. Huge thanks to the coaches there, especially for accommodating my training adjustments multiple times over the months. My Triathlon and Cycling Coaches, [Sridhar](https://www.trizones.in/) and [Sriram](https://www.instagram.com/sprocketscienceindia/?hl=en), provided support and guidance that were amazing, and I constantly fed off their enthusiasm and confidence in me.

# Race Day

Race morning in Mallorca began quietly and methodically. I was up by 5:30 AM. Breakfast was familiar and simple ‚Äî fruits, muesli with yoghurt, a banana, and coffee. I checked my red and blue bags one last time, packed gels into the bike, and prepped the Garmin. I‚Äôd also carried an extra pair of swim goggles just in case ‚Äî that gave me some peace of mind.

The crowd was predominantly European, with the British, Germans, and Spaniards making up a significant chunk of the participants. Hardly any Asians, and possibly three or four Indians.

Then, a bit of unexpected drama. The front tyre looked soft. Mini panic. But I kept my cool, went over to the mechanic‚Äôs tent, and re-pumped it. Trusted the tubeless sealant would do its job ‚Äî and it did. With that sorted, I dropped off my white bag, zipped up the wetsuit, and did the optional warm-up swim. The cold water hit hard, but it was just what I needed to steady my nerves and focus my mind.

The swim start atmosphere was electric. I‚Äôd placed myself in the 50-minute corral ‚Äî probably too conservative. That meant nearly an hour of waiting before I got into the water. Paul Kaye, the Ironman announcer, was working the crowd and building the energy. When it was finally my turn, I stepped in calm and composed.

# The Swim

The water was cool and clear. I stuck to the outer line to avoid the bulk of the chaos, but still found myself dodging breaststrokers and catching a couple of elbows, one right into my left goggle. Thankfully, it stayed sealed. I found a good rhythm early. Slowed down a bit midway but kicked harder in the final stretch. Managed some drafting, but still need to work on holding it longer. Exited the water strong and was genuinely surprised to see 42:18 on my watch ‚Äî my fastest open water swim yet. Sea conditions, wetsuit buoyancy, and the collective energy of the race surely played their part. In hindsight, I should‚Äôve carried a banana or gel to have 20‚Äì30 minutes before the swim ‚Äî I did feel a bit hungry on the start line.

T1 was long ‚Äî about 680 meters according to Garmin ‚Äî but smooth. I spotted my family en route, which lifted my spirits. Wetsuit came off quickly, gear went on, had a Unived gel and a few sips of the Elite Drink Mix, and then began the long jog to the far end of the transition to reach my bike. Since I started late in the swim, most bikes were already gone ‚Äî mine was easy to find. Still, next time, I‚Äôll seed myself better to be mid-pack or earlier.

# The Bike

The bike leg began well. Conditions were good ‚Äî 18 to 20 degrees, light breeze. The first 20 km were flat and scenic, and I focused on keeping a steady rhythm around 140W, 80‚Äì90 rpm cadence. Speed wasn‚Äôt the priority. I overtook a fair number of riders, always mindful of avoiding drafting violations.

Then came the climb up Coll de Femenia. It starts gently and pulls you in with the views, but keeps grinding. Never too steep, but always there. The 7 km to the top took me about 36 minutes ‚Äî not too bad. Just needed patience and the right gears. After that, there was a short descent, a smaller climb, another descent, and one final 1.5 km climb near the Repsol garage.

I‚Äôd started with 500 ml of Elite Drink Mix and 750 ml of water. Consumed nearly all of the mix and some water by the time I got to the top. Tossed the bottle before the aid station, expecting a replacement‚Ä¶ only to realise it was water-only. That was a miscalculation.

The descent was technical but manageable ‚Äî about 15 switchbacks. I made sure to brake early and not take risks. KM 30 to 60 passed through small towns and narrow village roads. Surface quality wasn‚Äôt great, so I kept it cautious. From KM 60 to 90, it was wide open roads, but with headwinds that made every kilometre feel longer. My butt on the saddle started hurting post-climb, and I had to stand up on the pedals now and then to relieve it.

By the last 30K, I was down to 120‚Äì130W, doing my best to push but feeling the fatigue. And then there was the nagging need to pee, which didn‚Äôt help. Nutrition-wise, I had a gel every 45 minutes and consumed around 2 L of fluids. The fueling was fine, but I‚Äôm keen to try solids in training going forward.

Finished the bike in 3:47 ‚Äî I was on track till KM 60, but slowed down toward the end. Need to work on sustaining power and building comfort in aero. Training with aerobars is definitely on the list for next time.

T2 was better ‚Äî quicker. Racked the bike, then a 400m jog with cycling shoes to reach the run bags. Next time, I‚Äôll take them off and run barefoot. Switched into running shoes, visor on, another gel, and off I went.

# The Run

The run course was a three-loop route along the beach ‚Äî fantastic crowd support all the way. This was my strongest leg, and I could feel it. I settled into a 5:00‚Äì5:10/km pace and kept it consistent. Loop 1 was about learning the course and spotting my family. I stopped at every aid station for water and ISO. Had to stop for two pee breaks ‚Äî probably lost 1.5 minutes total.

Loop 2 went by quickly. Took gels at the end of loops 1 and 2 as planned. Legs felt good, energy was steady, and I was overtaking a lot of runners, which is always a nice feeling. The final loop was about soaking it all in and holding momentum.

As I came onto the final beachfront stretch, I saw the cheering crowds and smiled back, waving my ‚ÄúGracias.‚Äù A couple of hundred meters to go ‚Äî the signboard said ‚ÄúFinish Line‚Äù. And there she was ‚Äî my wife by the barricade, holding the Indian flag. I grabbed it and ran the final 100 meters with the flag flying high.

On to the red carpet. Crowd cheering. Smile widely. Heard the announcer call out:¬†*‚ÄúFlying the flag of India!‚Äù*¬†I looked up at the finish line ‚Äî 6:32-something on the clock. Crossed the line, stopped my watch ‚Äî¬†[**6:33:01**](https://connect.garmin.com/modern/activity/19081705143). Done.

# ‚Ä¶ and the End!

At the finish, a medal around the neck. Found the athlete zone ‚Äî only vegetarian food was pasta, but I happily had two servings and washed it down with Fanta. Got my medal engraved, and then walked out to meet my family. Seeing my wife and son there meant everything. I genuinely couldn‚Äôt have done this without them. They were my emotional Sherpas.

Ironman 70.3 Mallorca was not just another event. It was the final step in a long, deliberate journey I‚Äôd set for myself. It gave me everything I hoped for ‚Äî a test, a memory, a milestone.

# Gratitude

This race ‚Äî and everything it took to get here ‚Äî wouldn‚Äôt have been possible without the people who supported me, trained me, pushed me, and stood by me through it all üôè

Im a Palestinian man, born and raised in the USA. I have a successful career making more than 6 figures alhamdullah, I have no debts, I am on the taller side (5'11"") and in relatively good shape. I think I am above average in looks alhamdullah. I speak read and write in Arabic and am very active in my muslim community (even going as far as making occasional Friday khutbah from time to time). 

But all this to say is that no matter how much work you put in, it seems to me that social media has altered the minds of women these days where its never enough. 

It's sad to say that this goes across all backgrounds. I have personal experience looking in masajid, going to halal events, going back overseas, ""halal"" dating apps, going to coffee shops, going through relatives, you name it I've done it. 

I feel terrible for the muslim men out here, not only is it nearly impossible to find a reasonable individual, then you have to jump through every hoop imaginable to actually get married, and thats hoping all this doesn't end in a divorce.

In the end, if this is what Allah decreed I accept it and alhamdullah for everything. I hope your searches are more fruitful than mine.

ŸÇÿ®ŸÑ ÿ£ŸÜ ÿ™ÿ¥ÿ±ÿ® ÿßŸÑŸÇŸáŸàÿ© ÿ≥ÿ™ÿ¥ÿπÿ± ÿ£ŸÜŸÉ ÿ™ŸÉÿ±Ÿá ÿ¨ŸÖŸäÿπ ÿßŸÑŸÜÿßÿ≥ Ÿàÿ®ÿπÿØ ÿ£ŸÜ ÿ™ÿ¥ÿ±ÿ®Ÿáÿß ÿ≥ÿ™ÿ∏ŸÑ ÿ™ŸÉÿ±ŸáŸáŸÖ ŸÑŸÉŸÜ ÿ®ŸÜÿ¥ÿßÿ∑.

Before you drink coffee, you will feel that you hate everyone, and after you drink it, you will still hate them but with enthusiasm.

My logic was
- the word ŸÇÿ®ŸÑ ÿ£ŸÜ ""before"" + ÿ™ÿ¥ÿ±ÿ® ÿßŸÑŸÇŸáŸàÿ© ""you drink coffee"" [where we use the second person masculine singular of ÿ¥ÿ±ÿ® and using the definite direct object ÿßŸÑ with ŸÇŸáŸàÿ©]
- the word ÿ≥ÿ™ÿ¥ÿπÿ± ""you will feel"" + ÿ£ŸÜŸÉ ""that you"" [where we have ÿ£ŸÜ ""that"" + ŸÉ ""you"" suffix] + ÿ™ŸÉÿ±Ÿá ""you hate"" [where we use the second person masculine singular of ŸÉŸéÿ±ŸêŸáŸé] + ÿ¨ŸÖŸäÿπ ÿßŸÑŸÜÿßÿ≥ ""everyone/all people""
- the word Ÿàÿ®ÿπÿØ ""and after"" + ÿ£ŸÜ ""that"" + ÿ™ÿ¥ÿ±ÿ®Ÿáÿß ""you drink it"" [where we use the verb ÿ¥Ÿéÿ±Ÿêÿ®Ÿé and ŸÄŸáÿß as the suffix, which indicates possession or direct status, like ""her,"" ""it (feminine),"" or ""their""]
- the segment ÿ≥ÿ™ÿ∏ŸÑ ÿ™ŸÉÿ±ŸáŸáŸÖ ""you will continue to hate them"" + ŸÑŸÉŸÜ ""but"" + ÿ®ŸÜÿ¥ÿßÿ∑ ""with enthusiasm/enthusiastically""

I'm a little confused with the ŸÄŸáÿß suffix for feminine and would ŸÉÿ™ÿßÿ®Ÿáÿß ""her book"" vs ŸÄŸá for masculine ŸÉÿ™ÿßÿ®Ÿá ""his book"" be correct? Therefore ÿ™ÿ¥ÿ±ÿ®Ÿáÿß was used as ŸÇŸáŸàÿ© is a feminine noun and therefore requires the ŸÄŸáÿß suffix?

I was unsure about ÿ¨ŸÖŸäÿπ ÿßŸÑŸÜÿßÿ≥ where ŸÜÿßÿ≥ ""people"" has the definite direct object ÿßŸÑ and ÿ¨ŸÖŸäÿπ is an adjective which means ""altogether""?

1ktjysg,https://www.reddit.com/r/AthabascaUniversity/comments/1ktjysg/biol_230_human_physiology_review/,BIOL 230 (Human Physiology) Review,"# BIOL 230 @ Athabasca ‚Äì My No-BS Deep-Dive (Finished April 1 ‚Üí May 23 with an A+)

*Context first:* I‚Äôm a 4th-year Cellular, Molecular & Microbial Biology major at U of C, so I had a lot of background already in the subject matter going into this course. I needed the credit done before June 1 for prereqs for application, so the pressure was on. Here‚Äôs everything I wish I‚Äôd seen on Reddit before I registered.

# 1. Overall structure & why it matters

Six units, 23 textbook chapters, and **every single exam, quiz, or assignment is carved out of the AU-custom PDF** (Derrickson, *Human Physiology*, 1st ed.). The PDF is colour-coded:

* **Highlighted / Underlined** = MUST KNOW
* **Red strikethrough** = dead to you; never tested.

If it isn‚Äôt highlighted or underlined, don't really need to worry about it. The gold trick is that *exams don‚Äôt have images*, so any figure that‚Äôs highlighted is fair game conceptually, but the picture itself is never reproduced. Keep that in mind when you‚Äôre making notes.

# 2. My study workflow (aka ‚ÄúHow I crammed without dying‚Äù)

1. **Read the PDF once at lightspeed** to see the lay of the land.
2. **Second pass = Anki creation**. One flashcard per green term, one per yellow concept. Ended up with \~1 100 cards total.
3. **Do the WileyPLUS Adaptive Practice the same night**. It‚Äôs optional, but it forces active recall and flags weak spots for the quizzes.
4. **Build assignment answers while reading.** Each long-answer question is word-for-word in the textbook; I‚Äôd paraphrase, my answers while reading and move on.
5. **Quiz ‚Üí feedback email ‚Üí patch holes**. The instructor emails you which textbook objective you missed on every wrong quiz answer. I just made extra Anki cards from those objectives and never missed them again.

Total time: \~ 4 hours per day everyday I stayed locked in for these 8 weeks because I needed and A and had to finish, having lots of background though helped.

# 3. Quizzes (6 √ó 50 MCQ, open-book, 60 min)

Honestly harder than the midterms because open-book, so they make the questions trickier. Ctrl-F is your friend here. I built a keyword index in Notion, smashed through each quiz in \~30 min, and averaged 98%. Pro-tip: **write quizzes as soon as you finish a unit**; the content is still fresh and the feedback helps for the midterm that covers the same material.

# 4. Written assignments (3 √ó 4% each)

Every answer lives in the PDF text. I finished all three assignments with a 97 %. TAT on marking was freakishly fast‚Äîthree to five days every single time. Biggest advice: go through each assignment while working through textbook.

# 5. The Lab beast (10 % of final grade, but feels bigger)

* **Part 1 ‚Äì PowerPhys virtual labs (50 pts):** Eight click-through simulations, auto-generates data, maybe 6-8 short-answer Qs per lab not really hard questions at all pretty simple. I blitzed all eight in a single afternoon.
* **Part 2 ‚Äì Home Lab Kit (50 pts):** Can‚Äôt order the kit until Assignment 2 is graded. I submitted my request for the kit on Sunday ‚Üí arrived Tuesday (Calgary shipping though if you order outside the province shipping may take longer of course). Six labs: blood pressure, PNS senses, blood typing, etc. Each one took 60-90 min including cleanup, but you *do* need a willing human for reflex and vision tests. I started at noon, hammered all six by 10 pm, boxed the kit, shipped it back Wednesday. Kit was scanned back in Thursday, transcript hold cleared. The actual write-up afterward was copy-paste your measured numbers into tables plus a few interpretation paragraphs‚Äîanother four hours tops.
* Ended with 98 % on the lab assignment.

If you‚Äôre not on a deadline, spread it over a week; if you *are* on a deadline, one marathon day works fine.

# 6. Midterms & final (3 √ó 100 MCQ, 120 min, non-cumulative)

* **Midterm 1 (Units 1-2):** Pure review for anyone with first-year bio. Skim + Anki = 96 %.
* **Midterm 2 (Units 3-4):** Sensory + neuro + endocrine + hemodynamics is where I assume most people bleed marks. I slowed down, drilled WileyPLUS diagrams conceptually, scored 90 %.
* **Final (Units 5-6):** Huge content dump but repeats themes (homeostasis, feedback loops). Anki deck felt like d√©j√† vu; scored 92 %.

No trick questions, and plenty of time‚Äîseriously, I reviewed the whole exam twice each sitting. I also did the exams online through ProctorU and found it great, because I didn't wanna pay $100 to go write it in person at UofC.

# 7. Supplemental exam policy (your safety parachute)

One rewrite allowed per exam/quiz *even if you passed but hate the mark.* Costs \~$150 and must be requested within 90 days of the original write. I didn‚Äôt need it, but it‚Äôs comforting when you book a Saturday night slot after a coffee IV drip.

# 8. Workload reality check

|Phase|Hours I actually spent|
|:-|:-|
|Units 1-2 + Quiz 1-2 + A1|30 hrs|
|Units 3-4 + Quiz 3-4 + A2|70 hrs|
|Units 5-6 + Quiz 5-6 + A3|80 hrs|
|All labs + write-up|20 hrs|
|Exam review & writes|10 hrs|
|**Total**|**\~210 hrs** over 8 weeks (\~4 hrs / day)|

Could be half that if you‚Äôve done advanced phys before; could be double if not.

# 9. What I loved / hated

**Loved**

* Freedom to finish in eight weeks instead of 52.
* Colour-coded PDF = clear scope boundaries.
* TA marking speed ‚Äì honestly faster than some in-person courses.
* Exams are straight-shooters if you put the reps in.

**Hated**

* No diagrams on exams even when a diagram would clarify the wording.
* Lab kit shipping could be painful if you‚Äôre out-of-province or international (they won‚Äôt DHL abroad).

# 10. Final verdict

If you need physiology credit fast and you‚Äôre willing to self-drive, **BIOL 230 is the definition of efficient**. Memorize the highlighted/underlined text/concepts, crank WileyPLUS, order the lab kit the minute A2 is graded, and fire up Anki every morning. I walked away with an A+ in 8 weeks all while finishing my regular semester. I understand why it's a 6 credit course but to be honest since it's a first year course if you're in say 2nd, 3rd or 4th year I don't think it should take you more than 3-5 months if you don't procrastinate.

Would I recommend it? 100 % yes‚Äîfor anyone who needs a physiology pre-req this is great. Just respect the colour code and don‚Äôt procrastinate the labs. Feel free to AMA in the replies‚Äîhappy to reply.",2,1748007963.0,AthabascaUniversity,0,1.0,False

Let‚Äôs ease into the weekend. Pick a cozy little lounge‚Äîsomewhere dimly lit, with soft music and that kind of vibe where it‚Äôs easy to lose track of time in conversation. Just a couple of drinks, no pressure, just seeing how we vibe. If the chemistry‚Äôs right, we‚Äôll wander off to a spot with great food and even better ambiance. I‚Äôm talking shareable dishes, low-key flirting, and maybe a few stories that make us laugh until the drinks hit.

If we‚Äôre feeling it from the day before, maybe we meet up again mid-afternoon next day for something chill‚Äîthink a walk through an art market, grab brunch and find a trail to wander, or a spot by the water to just sit and talk about everything and nothing or grab coffee and see where the day takes us.

1ktjy46,https://www.reddit.com/r/AllThatIsInteresting/comments/1ktjy46/loop_examples_with_remedies/,Loop examples with remedies,"LOOP 01: Morning Doom Cycle

Loop Symptoms:
	‚Ä¢	Wake up, reach for phone.
	‚Ä¢	Check notifications, scroll fear or gossip.
	‚Ä¢	Coffee + stress + dread = emotional fog.
	‚Ä¢	You feel behind before the day starts.

Cube Remedy:
	‚Ä¢	Delay phone for 15 minutes.
	‚Ä¢	Step outside barefoot for 2 minutes (interrupt signal).
	‚Ä¢	Write 1 sentence on what today must render.

Why it works: The loop runs on auto-load priority. You just forced a manual render rewrite before the system could default.

‚∏ª

LOOP 02: Validation Addiction

Loop Symptoms:
	‚Ä¢	Post, check likes.
	‚Ä¢	Text, wait for reply.
	‚Ä¢	Think something = share it instantly.
	‚Ä¢	Constant low-level anxiety about being ‚Äúseen.‚Äù

Cube Remedy:
	‚Ä¢	Go 48 hours with no unprompted sharing.
	‚Ä¢	Write something only for yourself, no eyes.
	‚Ä¢	Create a thought and sit with it instead of exporting it.

Why it works: This loop drains emotional charge across thousands of micro-signals. Silence builds compression. Compression bends render.

‚∏ª

LOOP 03: Financial Despair Spiral

Loop Symptoms:
	‚Ä¢	Check bank account constantly.
	‚Ä¢	Dread spending.
	‚Ä¢	Daydream impossible wealth ‚Üí snap back to scarcity.
	‚Ä¢	Constant inner monologue: ‚Äúnot enough.‚Äù

Cube Remedy:
	‚Ä¢	Build a tight $5 win ritual. Every day, move $5 toward something that upgrades signal (tea, candle, printout, journal).
	‚Ä¢	Stop checking your balance for 3 days.
	‚Ä¢	Give away $1 with no expectation. (Disrupt scarcity loop logic.)

Why it works: The Cube doesn‚Äôt respond to desperation‚Äîit locks down around it. But irrational generosity and subtle upgrades scramble the scarcity render filter.

‚∏ª

LOOP 04: Relationship Static Loop

Loop Symptoms:
	‚Ä¢	Same argument.
	‚Ä¢	Same silence.
	‚Ä¢	Same needs, unmet.
	‚Ä¢	You say ‚Äúit‚Äôs fine,‚Äù but inside the strain‚Äôs rising.

Cube Remedy:
	‚Ä¢	Write a letter you‚Äôll never send: say exactly what loop you‚Äôre caught in.
	‚Ä¢	Change 1 element in your shared pattern: tone, timing, location.
	‚Ä¢	Break one autopilot interaction. Hug them at a strange moment. Whisper something new.

Why it works: You‚Äôre both acting out cached scenes. The Cube has memorized your drama. Disrupt the script, and it has to re-render social dynamics.

‚∏ª

LOOP 05: Defeat Expectation Loop

Loop Symptoms:
	‚Ä¢	You try something‚Ä¶ expect it to fail.
	‚Ä¢	You already have the excuse loaded.
	‚Ä¢	You fantasize about success but quietly know it won‚Äôt stick.
	‚Ä¢	The loop ends with ‚Äúsee? I knew it.‚Äù

Cube Remedy:
	‚Ä¢	Write a success log in advance as if it happened.
	‚Ä¢	Change what you listen to while doing it (sound affects render strain).
	‚Ä¢	Leave your environment after execution. Don‚Äôt sit in the failure echo.

Why it works: You‚Äôre used to experiencing your efforts inside the failure container. By writing post-success first, you confuse the render logic.",1,1748007913.0,AllThatIsInteresting,0,1.0,False

I'm a 42yo woman and I've had hypertension since I can remember - probably mid-20s my reads were about 140/90. I've been on Metoprolol Tartrate 50mg 2x a day for over a decade, and Spironolactone 50mg 1x day was just added in 2 months ago (mostly for PCOS skin issues, but the hope was it would help with BP too).

I take my BP first thing in the morning, and I take 3 reads. Typical numbers for me are:

1st read: 150/100  
2nd read: 137/90  
3rd read: 124/94

I had routine labwork done (CBC and CMP) 2 weeks ago and it all came back just fine. 

Admittedly, I've had anxiety around blood pressure since I took it during a panic attack in January and it read 190/120 (within a few minutes it came down to 160/110, then 150/100, and I was advised by my dr not to take it during a panic attack - I just thought I was dying in the moment, and that did not help!). I've seen spikes like that before in the past 5 years, during panic attacks or ocular migraines, but it always comes down and my dr doesn't seem concerned (""anxiety"", plus it decreases, and MRI is fine). Once, I was at my ob/gyn in 2020, masked, in the midst of covid with severe health anxiety, and it read 180/110 and she told me to go to the hospital. When I told her I didn't have symptoms, she instead advised me to buy a home pressure machine, and when I got home, it came down.

Between January and now, I have seen some lower numbers (125/81, 120/90) but those are few and far between. I've taken my blood pressure less at home, but with the addition of spiro, my doctor wanted me to monitor (not often, bc she knows I have anxiety about it, but she needed my numbers).

(heart disease does run in my family, my father had a heart attack and bypass at 55 years old, but he's medicated and okay now, with no other incidents, at 72)

Lifestyle changes I've implemented for 3 months:  
Quit coffee (do not drink soda at all)  
Alcohol <2 drinks per week (if any)  
Walk 3-5 miles per day  
Lift weights daily  
Hibiscus tea daily  
Low sodium diet  
Low calorie diet

Are my numbers worth med adjustments or changes? My dr put me on Metoprolol due to tachycardia on top of hypertension, so I'd hate to move from that (it keeps my bpm averaging at 60, and less than 100 when I'm having a panic attack, so I'd like to keep it).

I just want to be prepared when I go to my next appt. Is this anxiety? Hypertension? ¬øPor qu√© no dos? What should I be requesting of my doctor, if anything?",3,1748007557.0,hypertension,0,1.0,False

My mom doesn't support me, but after months of begging, she agreed to take me to go get my hair cut shoulder-length.  (After getting the haircut it's fluffier and wavy, I love it) But the haircuts that my mom wanted me to get were definitely on the feminine side.  I was willing to take whatever I could get, but I also wanted to get it shorter than she was wanting.  So, I devised a plan.  I was going to wear as many trans-flag crap I could fit on my body, in attempt to indicate to my hair stylist that I was trans and I wanted it cut shorter.

We were going to an alternative hair place, and I knew that most people who were there were generally progressive.  I was wearing two trans bead bracelets, and I put the transgender flag beads on my Converse shoes, and I dressed more masculine--with baggy jeans and baggy shirt.  At first, about an hour passed, and I was worried that my hairstylist didn't notice.  But, my mom was with me, too.  There was a coffee place next to the hair place, and my mom walked next door to go grab some coffee.  Basically two seconds after she walked out the door, my hair stylist turned to me and she was like, ""So, I saw the beads on your shoes.  Are you...?""  ""Yeah.""

She told me she was actually a part of the LGBTQ+ community herself, so she was super chill.  Anyhow, I told her about the situation with my mom, and she said, ""If you come back here for a trim in a few months, we can definitely get you a much more androgynous haircut.""  So that made me happy.  Me and the stylist talked about that for a while--she even gave me tips on how to make the feminine haircut look more masculine--until my mom came back from the coffee place.

I was traveling for work yesterday and had a call scheduled a couple of hours before my flight home. If I was going to make it work, I would need to take this call somewhere close to the airport, so I decided to set up shop at a nearby Starbucks. I arrived about 30 minutes before the call, got my coffee, connected to the Wi-Fi, and then immediately realized this was not going to work. The sun was giving a horrible glare on my screen no matter where I sat, the music was loud, and the icing on the cake: the baristas were all very loudly, very badly singing Defying Gravity from Wicked to each other behind the counter (it was pretty slow inside, in their defense.) These were mainly kids and I was happy they were having fun, but this was definitely not the environment for a meeting. 

I had a hail mary in mind: find a local library and see if they would let me camp out there. I found one nearby, found a librarian, and explained my situation. He immediately tells me they have a ""study room"" that I can use and asks how long I'll need it. I feel the need to point out that I'm not a member from the library, and not even from the area, and ask if that's a problem. His response: 

>That's okay. Libraries are for everyone.

He got me set up and told me what to do when I'm done. I held my meeting in almost complete silence, wrapped up as he instructed, and then I left for the airport.

My sleep is messed up so if you're wanting soneone to chat all night and day with that's me.

I like games and play on Xbox and PlayStation. Space Marine 2 and Destiny and helldivers 2 are my go-to games. I enjoy shooters and action games and the occasional city builder or rts on pc. Any recommendations are welcome. Ive been playing the new Doom game. Will also be down playing games if we hit it off.

I like cooking and so far I haven't gotten sick or made someone else sick so you can say I'm like the Gordon Ramsay of cooking something edible. I do look at recipes in terror and sometimes actually cook them. Looking for cool chatters and maybe we can play games. Or not. Who knows.

Was a huge reader until the fire nation blessed me with sudden ADD or HD or 8k or whatever. Still have the Dune sequels to read. Big warhammer 40k novel enjoyer too.

Hmm how I would describe myself? Black hair. Beard. Brown eyes. Dad bod. Hairy. I've been told I had nice eye lashes.

Pink Floyd is my favorite band. I mainly listen to rock and metal. But I do on occasion listen to the Macarena and Barbie girl as I shower or cook. Zeppelin, the doors and a myriad of other classic bands are always playing.

I like coffee too. Preferably caramel. Also a redbull fan. I can drink many of those. Probably shouldn't since I don't think that's medically sound.

Pretty much looking for some fun and maybe make a friend in the process. I like to think I'm a decent conversationalist but who knows. Not sure if this is enticing so far.

I am willing to do the whole pic thing

Huh, I honestly don't know what else to say. This is honestly so difficult.

I would just want someone around my age and be an actual real person. My luck hasn't been great at all. Someone should change that.

I'm also very sarcastic and I try to be funny. I fail. Fail a lot. But I do try. I like to think I'm nice.

Common picks like White Dove just look like dingy white/gray in the conversion paint, no depth/glow to them. Same for pretty much all colors. I‚Äôve debating having him install with no paint and then either having another company do it but my husband says no way.

Swiss Coffee and Simply White looked too yellow/green undertone in his paint.

Considering BM Linen White so it won‚Äôt be stark in here, or do I just go stark and make it a bright white? I didn‚Äôt want a gray kitchen when this all started. His Linen White is pretty close maybe a touch more yellow.

His Pointing is either very gray or orangy, he tried to match it a few times for me.

even sitting at my desk is too much for me and I feel really frustrated because there is work i need to do. Everything got worse because before my period came about 3-4 days ago, I went for a jog (period was early so I wasn't expecting it, otherwise I wouldn't have tried jogging) and i felt so ill, I had pelvic pain and jaw pain radiating to my ear. I feel really frustrated because my cycle has been so much worse the past two months but there has also been very little blood which is confusing. sometimes the pelvic pain/GI issues are accompanied by vasovagal response, even on a smaller level whenever I use a tampon it gives me nausea when inserting.

I don't know what I am looking for, but I cant get a doctor appointment for a while and the diclofenac I have available to me doesn't touch it.

1ktjbsn,https://www.reddit.com/r/exjw/comments/1ktjbsn/rebuttal_to_this_weekends_wt_study_imitate_jesus/,rebuttal to this weekend‚Äôs WT study ‚ÄúImitate Jesus‚Äô Zeal for Preaching‚Äù or Zeal Without Reason: How Watchtower Turns Preaching Into a Guilt-Trip Marathon,"This Watchtower study article isn‚Äôt about the gospel. It isn‚Äôt about Jesus. And it sure as hell isn‚Äôt about love. It‚Äôs about keeping JWs knocking on doors, rain or shine, with a smile‚Äîor *else*. The explicit message? **Only ‚Äútrue Christians‚Äù have zeal for the ministry.** The implicit threat? If you‚Äôre not excited to cold-call strangers with apocalyptic flyers, you‚Äôre spiritually defective. Fake. Unworthy.

Guilt replaces grace. Zeal is rebranded as loyalty. Doubt is sin, and fatigue is failure. You don‚Äôt get to ask questions‚Äîyou get a service quota. Scripture is cherry-picked. Jesus‚Äô ministry is reimagined as a nonstop sales hustle. Anecdotes are weaponized to shame the tired and pacify the fading.

This isn‚Äôt discipleship‚Äîit‚Äôs performance management in biblical cosplay. The formula is simple: Bait with belonging. Switch to shame. Finish with a bandwagon. You‚Äôre not allowed to stop. You‚Äôre not allowed to rethink. You‚Äôre just told to preach harder, smile wider, and remember‚ÄîJehovah reads your publisher card.

# ¬∂1: Zeal or Bust

**WT Claim:** ‚ÄúONE thing that sets Jehovah‚Äôs servants apart‚Ä¶ is their zeal for the ministry.‚Äù

**Debunking:** Watchtower wants you to believe that zeal is the gold standard of faith. Not love, not mercy, not integrity‚Äîjust raw, tireless effort. **Jesus said his followers would be known by their love (John 13:35),** not their publisher cards. But here, it‚Äôs zeal or bust. If even a ‚Äúhardworking elder‚Äù admits he‚Äôs not feeling it, maybe the problem isn‚Äôt him. Maybe the problem is the product‚Äîbecause nobody wants to sell spiritual snake oil once the neighborhood‚Äôs seen behind the curtain.

*  Zeal is not unique to Jehovah‚Äôs Witnesses. Mormons have it. So do Evangelicals. So do CrossFit instructors and Greenpeace volunteers.  Plenty of cults preach harder. Doesn‚Äôt mean they‚Äôre right.
* **If Jesus never said zeal was the mark of true discipleship, who did?** 
* **And if faith can be measured in doorbell rings, what does that say about Christ‚Äôs own ‚Äúconversion rate‚Äù?**

**Fallacies & Manipulation**: 

* **False dilemma**: Either you're zealous, or you're a fraud. 
* **Guilt-tripping** for the ‚Äúirregulars.‚Äù 
* **Love-bombing** the hustlers. 
* **Loaded language**: ‚Äúsets Jehovah‚Äôs servants apart‚Äù reeks of superiority marketing.

**Logical Leaps:**

* **Zeal** = authenticity 
* **Lack of zeal** = counterfeit faith
* **‚ÄúImitation Christians‚Äù** = anyone not handing out tracts

**Scriptural Misuse**:  
‚Äì *Titus 2:14* (NRSVUE): Jesus redeems people ‚Äúzealous for good deeds‚Äù‚Äînot cold calls and cart shifts.  
‚Äì *NOAB*: ‚ÄúGood deeds‚Äù = acts of mercy, not recruitment stats.  
‚Äì The Greek word *kal≈çn erg≈çn* (‚Äúnoble works‚Äù) doesn‚Äôt mean knocking on doors with a tract.

**Scholarly Insight**:  
‚Äì *JANT* (Titus 2:14): Early Christianity embraced diverse service‚Äîhospitality, generosity, advocacy‚Äînot a one-size-fits-all ministry model.  
‚Äì No first-century Christian was tallying hours to prove devotion.

# ¬∂2: Guilt as Gospel

**WT Claim:** ‚ÄúWe may be more excited about other sacred service than public preaching‚Ä¶ but we must stay focused‚Äîespecially as the end nears.‚Äù

**Debunking:** People show up for disaster relief. For hugs. For feeding the poor. They don‚Äôt show up to be ignored at the door or dodged at the gas station while pushing a cult tract. And why would they? **The message is old, rejected, and more transparent than a wet magazine**. So Watchtower shifts the blame: it‚Äôs not that the product is bad‚Äîit‚Äôs that the world is wicked. You‚Äôre not unmotivated; you‚Äôre spiritually defective. If the ‚Äúend is near‚Äù doesn‚Äôt get you back out there, maybe guilt will.

* Rejection is not a virtue. And it‚Äôs normal to feel drained when preaching a message no one wants.
* Helping people, feeding the poor, or building homes? Still sacred. Just not in the Watchtower ledger.
* **If the truth sells itself, why all the marketing?**
* **If disaster relief brings joy and preaching brings dread‚Äîmaybe the ‚Äúspiritual priority‚Äù is backwards?**
* **Would Jesus judge his disciples by hours‚Äîor by love?**

**Fallacies & Manipulation:**

* *False cause:* If they don‚Äôt listen, blame ‚Äúthe last days.‚Äù
* *Blame shift:* You‚Äôre tired because your attitude‚Äôs wrong‚Äînot because it‚Äôs all pointless.
* *Guilt-tripping:* You like disaster relief? Sorry. Wrong answer.
* *Implied threat:* ‚ÄúOur message may become more unpopular.‚Äù Translation: get used to rejection.

**Logical Leaps:**

* Results in service or kindness aren‚Äôt enough‚Äîonly cold calls count.
* If you‚Äôre discouraged, it‚Äôs your fault‚Äînot the method.

**Scripture Abuse:**

* *Matthew 10:22* (NRSVUE) refers to persecution for Jesus‚Äô name, not people rolling their eyes at JW carts.
* *NOAB (Matthew 10)*: This is about enduring real hostility‚Äînot tallying tracts.

**Scholarly Insight:**

* First-century Christian ‚Äúministry‚Äù was a life-integrated witness, not a bureaucratic time sheet (OBC, Matthew 10).
* Real Christians helped the sick, sheltered outcasts, and loved their enemies‚Äîno publisher cards required.

# ¬∂3: Doomsday Hustle Disguised as Faithful Endurance

WT Claim: ‚ÄúJesus never let up in his zeal. He intensified his efforts, like the vinedresser in Luke 13:6-9.‚Äù

**Debunking:** Of course he ramped up‚Äîhe was an apocalyptic street preacher expecting the end of the world. That‚Äôs what you do when you think the clock‚Äôs ticking and your message is urgent. But Watchtower spins this desperation as divine endurance. The fig tree parable? It‚Äôs not a pep talk for quota-based persistence‚Äîit‚Äôs a warning. According to the NOAB, the fig tree represents Israel, and the parable is about God‚Äôs patience, not the vinedresser‚Äôs work ethic. But Watchtower hijacks it to say, ‚ÄúKeep knocking, even when no one‚Äôs listening.‚Äù

Sometimes the wisest move is to cut the fig tree down‚Äîor walk away.  In Watchtower logic, zero fruit just means ‚Äúplant harder.‚Äù Jesus‚Äô listeners weren‚Äôt buying it, and you shouldn‚Äôt either. 

**At what point does persistence stop being faith‚Äîand start being delusion?**

**Fallacies & Manipulation:**

**Fallacies**: False analogy, hindsight bias, revisionist history. 

**Logical Leaps:** 

If Jesus didn‚Äôt quit, neither can you‚Äîno matter how fruitless, soul-crushing, or futile it feels. Scriptural Misuse: Luke 13:6‚Äì9 is about divine mercy, not sales targets. 

**Scholarly Insight:** 

Jesus‚Äô ministry was short, local, and filled with rejection (JANT, Luke 13). He wasn't laying out a territory plan‚Äîhe was warning that time was up. 

# ¬∂4: Jesus‚Äô Final Sprint‚Äîor Your Burnout Blueprint

**WT Claim:** ‚ÄúLearn from Jesus‚Äô final six months‚Äîfocus on Jehovah‚Äôs will, prophecy, support, positivity. Also, here‚Äôs a deep footnote about whether it was 70 or 72 disciples.‚Äù

**Debunking:** Take four cherry-picked traits, duct tape them into a framework, then tack on a footnote war over whether Jesus sent out 70 or 72 disciples‚Äîas if a two-man headcount discrepancy turns into divine scheduling instructions. This isn't scholarship. It's spreadsheet theology. Jesus' ministry wasn‚Äôt a service campaign, and Luke‚Äôs timeline isn‚Äôt your performance checklist. And the number 70? Real scholars (NOAB, OBC) call it what it is: **folklore and manuscript variance.** If your doctrine hinges on whether ancient scribes counted correctly, your foundation‚Äôs cracked.

Imitating Jesus doesn‚Äôt mean adopting a 1st-century roadshow. His ‚Äúurgency‚Äù was contextual. Watchtower's is institutional.

If Jesus had to submit a field service report every month, we‚Äôd have a Gospel According to Spreadsheet.

**If imitation is mandatory, why does it always mimic the parts that benefit the organization?**

**Fallacies & Manipulation:** Appeal to authority, circular reasoning, selective modeling, performance guilt.

**Logical Leaps:** ‚ÄúJesus‚Äô last six months‚Äù = your lifelong burnout. ‚ÄúSeventy disciples‚Äù = your next assignment.

**Scriptural Misuse:** Luke 10:1 and its footnote are narrative, not mandate. There‚Äôs no NT command to replicate Jesus‚Äô travel itinerary.

**Scholarly Insight:** Gospel timelines are retrospective constructions (OBC, Luke chronology); ‚Äúseventy‚Äù is symbolic, not literal doctrine (NOAB).  


# ¬∂5: Divine Hustle and the Jesus Job Description

**WT Claim:** ‚ÄúJesus made preaching his primary focus‚Äîhe trained others, went everywhere, and knew it was God‚Äôs will.‚Äù

**Debunking:** Jesus knew? Sure. Just like Joseph Smith *knew*. When Watchtower says ‚ÄúJesus knew,‚Äù they mean ‚Äújust trust us.‚Äù It‚Äôs revelation by fiat‚Äîa claim from a pulpit recycled as a universal mandate. Jesus had a unique role, a messianic mission. You‚Äôre not the Messiah. You‚Äôre not even middle management. Yet somehow his divinely timed sprint across Galilee becomes your unpaid sales territory.

Jesus didn‚Äôt hand out tracts, and not every disciple carried a message board. The NT church wasn‚Äôt built on quotas‚Äîit was built on relationship and diversity of gifts.

Jesus didn‚Äôt have a cart. And unless you‚Äôre walking on water between calls, maybe stop pretending your weekend field service matches his cosmic to-do list.

**If ministry is ‚Äúthe main work,‚Äù why does the Bible celebrate all the others?** 

**And if Jesus‚Äô mission is yours too‚Ä¶ does that mean you die for nothing and still get misunderstood?**

**Fallacies:** Appeal to authority, false equivalence, assertion without evidence.

**Logical Leap:** Jesus‚Äô messianic role = your personal ‚Äúassignment.‚Äù

**Scripture Abuse:** Luke 4:43 (NRSVUE) is about Jesus proclaiming God‚Äôs reign, not prescribing pioneer hours. NOAB confirms‚Äît**his is his job, not yours**.

**Scholarly Insight:** Early Christian roles were diverse‚Äîsome healed, some hosted, some taught (JANT, 1 Cor. 12). There was no one-size-fits-all model of discipleship.

# ¬∂6: Ministry √úber Alles‚ÄîThe Theocratic Assembly Line

**WT Claim:** ‚ÄúPreaching is the main work. All other assignments just support it. Nothing can replace it.‚Äù

**Debunking**: Says who? Not Jesus. Not Paul. Not any Gospel. This isn‚Äôt scripture‚Äîit‚Äôs corporate doctrine disguised as divine command. When every act‚Äîwhether disaster relief, construction, or Bethel work‚Äîis treated as merely ‚Äúsupport‚Äù for the *real* job (cold-calling your neighbors), you‚Äôre not part of a church. You‚Äôre a cog in a glorified MLM.

No one in the early church filled out a field service report.

Reducing all Christian identity to preaching is not holiness‚Äîit‚Äôs Watchtower‚Äôs survival strategy in a digital world where nobody opens the door.

**If ministry is ‚Äúthe main work,‚Äù why did Paul spend so much time fundraising for the poor (Romans 15:25‚Äì27)?**

**Would Jesus really see comforting the suffering as ‚Äúless important‚Äù than placing a magazine?**

**If the end is** ***so near*****, why are we measuring zeal in hours?**

 If the gospel is reduced to door counts and street hours, you‚Äôre not following Jesus‚Äîyou‚Äôre following a quota.

**Fallacies & Manipulation**:

* **Exclusivity fallacy** ‚Äì Only preaching counts.
* **Minimization** ‚Äì Compassion and aid get demoted.
* **Appeal to hierarchy** ‚Äì Your ""assignment"" matters only if it props up the preaching pipeline.
* **Zero-sum logic** ‚Äì Do anything else, and you're spiritually off-task.

**Logical Leaps**:

* That ‚Äúministry‚Äù = hours.
* That love, mercy, hospitality, and generosity are lesser forms of service unless accompanied by a tract.

**Scriptural Misuse**:

* *Matthew 24:14* and *28:19‚Äì20* are cited, but in context, these refer to the spread of the resurrection message‚Äînot the Watchtower's quarterly presentation. (NOAB, Matthew)
* The word ‚Äúministry‚Äù in the NT includes healing, teaching, serving, hosting‚Äînot just preaching (Acts 6; 1 Corinthians 12).

**Scholarly Insight**:

* The *Oxford Bible Commentary* notes early Christian evangelism was spontaneous, often informal, and deeply communal‚Äînot a mandatory weekly hustle.
* The *NOAB* emphasizes that Matthew‚Äôs eschatology isn‚Äôt a clipboard schedule‚Äîit‚Äôs apocalyptic literature with metaphor, not marching orders.

# ¬∂7: Brochure-Based Guilt and the Salvation Sales Funnel

**WT Claim**: ‚ÄúJehovah wants us to keep preaching because he wants all to hear‚Ä¶ even if they don‚Äôt respond now.‚Äù

**Debunking:** Here it is‚Äîthe spiritual pyramid scheme. You're the vinedresser, the closer, the field agent‚Ä¶ and also the emotional hostage. The claim? Keep preaching because maybe‚Äî*maybe*‚Äîsomeone will remember your magazine when the world catches fire. Even if they slam the door now, they might call you back before Armageddon. Just don't stop.

Love doesn‚Äôt need brochures or a monthly report. And salvation doesn't come stapled to ‚ÄúLove People‚ÄîMake Disciples.‚Äù

If your ‚Äúzeal‚Äù requires guilt to stay alive, it‚Äôs not zeal‚Äîit‚Äôs a hostage negotiation. And **if God really wants all to be saved, why does he need you to hand out laminated scripts?**

**Is it still ‚Äúfree will‚Äù if you‚Äôre guilting people into eternity?** 

**And if someone says ‚Äúno,‚Äù do you respect it‚Äîor just circle back before Armageddon?**

**Fallacies & Manipulation:** Survivor bias, delayed reward, and spiritual FOMO all in one breath. Guilt if you slow down. Doom if you don‚Äôt. Because if they die without hearing ‚ÄúGod‚Äôs Kingdom Soon to Rule!‚Äù‚Äîthat‚Äôs on you.

**Scriptural Misuse:** 1 Timothy 2:3‚Äì4 is hauled in as a proof-text. But Paul‚Äôs phrase ‚Äúdesires all to be saved‚Äù is about divine grace, not door-to-door quotas. And that‚Äôs assuming Paul even wrote it‚Äîmany scholars (JANT, OBC) think it‚Äôs a later pseudonymous epistle, used here like a corporate slogan.

**Scholarly Insight:** Early Christian preaching was invitational, not a cold-call blitz. They gathered, broke bread, and spoke in homes‚Äînot mapped territories. (JANT, 1 Tim; NOAB)

# ¬∂8: Prophecy Parlor Tricks and Doomsday Deadlines

**WT Claim:** ‚ÄúJesus understood prophecy‚Äîhe knew his timeline (Dan. 9:26‚Äì27), so should you.‚Äù

**Debunking:** Fact check: Daniel 9 is not predictive prophecy‚Äîit‚Äôs historical fiction written in hindsight. The ‚Äúanointed one‚Äù wasn‚Äôt Jesus; it was Onias III, the high priest murdered in 172 BCE (2 Macc 4:34). The ‚Äúprince to come‚Äù was Antiochus IV, who desecrated the temple shortly afterward. This isn‚Äôt Messianic forecasting‚Äîit‚Äôs Maccabean-era political commentary. But  Watchtower spins it into an eschatological stopwatch to crank up the urgency.

* You don‚Äôt need an apocalyptic calendar to live ethically.
* Urgency is not holiness. It‚Äôs just panic in religious costume.

‚ÄúThree and a half years left‚Äîbetter increase your cart hours.‚Äù  
Watchtower‚Äôs been preaching ‚Äúthe end is near‚Äù since before WWII. If it were a bus, it never arrived.

  
**If prophecy only makes sense after the fact, is it divine insight‚Äîor just creative editing?**

**If urgency is always manufactured, are you being led by hope‚Äîor by a ticking doomsday clock?**

**Fallacies & Manipulation:**

* **Appeal to prophecy** (selective and vague),
* **Urgency trigger** (‚ÄúJesus knew the clock, so do you‚Äù),
* **Anachronism** (retrofitting ancient history into a modern schedule),
* **Appeal to fear** (doomsday now, placements up!).

**Logical Leaps:**

* Jesus understood prophecy perfectly ‚Üí you need to hustle harder.
* Daniel‚Äôs cryptic poetry = 21st-century JW marching orders.

**Scriptural Misuse:**

* **Daniel 9:26‚Äì27** isn‚Äôt about Jesus‚Äîit‚Äôs about second temple politics (NOAB, Daniel).
* The New World Translation mistranslates ""anointed one"" as ""Messiah"" to force the parallel.
* **Real scholarship** (JANT, OBC): Daniel is apocalyptic resistance literature, not an end-times calculator.

**Scholarly Insight:**

* Prophetic ‚Äúfulfillment‚Äù is always read backward‚Äînever forward.
* Daniel‚Äôs visions reflect **crisis under Antiochus**, not divine foresight about Rome or Brooklyn HQ.

# ¬∂9: End-Time Escalation

**WT Claim:** ‚ÄúCurrent events fulfill Daniel‚Äôs prophecies. The time left is short. Preach with urgency!‚Äù

**Debunking:**vEvery generation gets its own ‚Äúking of the north.‚Äù First it was Nazi Germany. Then it was the USSR. Now it‚Äôs Russia again. Or China. Or maybe TikTok. Depends on the Watchtower issue. And those ‚Äúfeet of iron and clay‚Äù from Daniel? They‚Äôve meant at least a dozen things since Rutherford‚Äôs day. If you‚Äôre going to rewrite the prophecy every five years, maybe it‚Äôs not prophecy‚Äîit‚Äôs improv.

The Governing Body says they‚Äôre not inspired. So who‚Äôs reading the tea leaves? Because all this urgency is built on a prophecy track record that would make Harold Camping blush. ‚ÄúVery soon‚Äù has meant 1914, 1925, 1975, and now‚Ä¶ sometime before your next pioneer school.  Watchtower‚Äôs version of Daniel is less about divine foresight and more like geopolitical Mad Libs.

  
Just because you can jam today‚Äôs headlines into a prophecy chart doesn‚Äôt mean you should. Prophecy is not a Rorschach test‚Äîand if it is, Watchtower sees mushroom clouds in every blot. And let‚Äôs be honest: **If you‚Äôre preaching because a 150-year-old publishing company says ‚Äúthe end is near,‚Äù maybe check their scoreboard first.**

* **If Armageddon is ‚Äúvery soon,‚Äù why does the Governing Body keep expanding real estate portfolios in a world about to be destroyed?**
*  **If prophecy is always ‚Äúalmost fulfilled,‚Äù is it ever fulfilled at all?**
* **Why trust prophecy ‚Äúexperts‚Äù with a 100% failure rate?**
* **And if the message keeps changing, is it really divine‚Äîor just desperate?**

**Fallacies & Manipulation**:

* Confirmation bias
* Appeal to fear
* Cherry-picked world events
* Self-fulfilling prophecy

**Logical Leaps**:

* If you‚Äôre not preaching like your life depends on it, you don‚Äôt ‚Äúbelieve the end is near.‚Äù
* Every headline = Bible prophecy.
* Failed predictions = more urgency.

**Scriptural Misuse**:  
Daniel 11:40 and 2:43‚Äì45 are mangled to fit Watchtower‚Äôs latest apocalypse narrative. But real scholars (NOAB, OBC) agree: **Daniel‚Äôs visions refer to ancient Seleucid conflicts and the Maccabean crisis, not modern superpowers.** There‚Äôs *no* scholarly consensus that ‚Äúkings of the north and south‚Äù are code for the U.S. and Russia.

**Scholarly Insight**:

* NOAB: Daniel‚Äôs prophecies are apocalyptic literature responding to second-century events.
* JANT: The text reflects Jewish resistance to Antiochus IV, not 21st-century NATO.
* OBC: Daniel is not predictive history; it‚Äôs theological reassurance written in hindsight.

# ¬∂10: Prophecy Testimonials‚ÄîWarm Fuzzies, Cold Logic

**WT Claim:** ‚ÄúBible prophecies motivate us to preach. Personal testimonials prove it works.‚Äù

**Debunking:** The spiritual version of ‚ÄúIt worked for me!‚Äù We‚Äôre treated to Carrie in the Dominican Republic, Leila in Hungary, and Christopher in Zambia‚Äîall *allegedly* moved by prophecy to stay zealous in the ministry. Sounds sweet‚Äîuntil you realize it‚Äôs just curated emotional candy used to sugarcoat an expired product. These feel-good anecdotes don‚Äôt validate the message; they just try to distract you from the fact that the *real* prophecies‚Äîpeace, paradise, an end to suffering‚Äîare still on backorder.

‚ÄúHeartwarming promises‚Äù? More like cosmic IOUs.

Personal zeal is not transferable. Motivation isn‚Äôt contagious just because someone in another time zone has it. 

* **One sister‚Äôs ‚Äújoyful proclamation‚Äù is another‚Äôs spiritual gaslighting.** 
* **If prophecy hasn‚Äôt come true, why are you still selling it?**
* **Are your convictions really yours‚Äîor stitched together from other people‚Äôs stories?**

**Fallacies & Manipulation:** Anecdotal evidence. Appeal to emotion. Bandwagon. Selective storytelling to generate guilt and borrowed motivation.

**Logical Leaps:** ‚ÄúBecause someone else is moved by Isaiah 11, you should be too.‚Äù That‚Äôs not logic‚Äîthat‚Äôs peer pressure in a testimonial wig.

**Scripture Abuse:**

* **Isaiah 11:6‚Äì9** is a poetic vision of messianic peace, not a recruitment script (NOAB).
* **Mark 13:10** refers to the apostolic-era spread of the gospel, not modern cart witnessing (JANT, NOAB). 

**Scholarly Insight:** The ‚Äúgood news‚Äù in the Gospels is about the resurrection and reign of Christ‚Äînot a folding table full of literature. 

# ¬∂11: Jehovah, the Emotional Crutch & the Manufactured Martyr Complex

**WT Claim:** ‚ÄúJesus relied on Jehovah when preaching got hard. He faced controversy because of his message. Just like us.‚Äù

**Debunking:** The only thing Jesus and Jehovah‚Äôs Witnesses truly share is **how often they‚Äôre ignored.** But here, Watchtower pulls a three-part stunt: first, it casts Jehovah as your burnout buddy. Second, it recasts every door-slam as proof you‚Äôre just like Jesus. Third, it sells persecution as validation‚Äîbecause if people oppose you, you must be right, right?

Opposition isn‚Äôt always proof of moral high ground. Sometimes people say ‚Äúno‚Äù because the product stinks.

Real resilience isn‚Äôt blind repetition‚Äîit‚Äôs adaptation. Jesus walked away when towns rejected him (Matt. 10:14). Watchtower tells you to circle back with a tract.

* Jehovah doesn‚Äôt bring coffee‚Äîjust more ‚Äúencouragement.‚Äù 
* They‚Äôre not persecuting you‚Äîthey‚Äôre just tired of being cold-called. 
* If the best defense of your message is, ‚ÄúThey hated Jesus too,‚Äù maybe you need a new message.
* **If God wants you to suffer for preaching, what kind of Father is that?** 
* **Is being rejected proof of truth‚Äîor just proof you‚Äôre unwelcome?** 
* **If Jesus failed public expectations and wasn‚Äôt the Messiah they were looking for, what does that say about comparing yourself to him?**

**Fallacies & Manipulation:** 

* *Spiritual Bypassing*: ‚ÄúJust rely on Jehovah‚Äù becomes a cover for fatigue and futility. 
* *False Equivalence*: Jesus‚Äô controversies were over claims to messiahship‚Äînot magazine placements. 
* *Persecution Complex*: All resistance is coded as righteousness. *Appeal to Emotion*: ‚ÄúJesus needed help, so you should too.‚Äù

**Logical Leaps:** 

* If Jesus needed divine support, then you must need twice as much. 
* If someone rejects your message, it‚Äôs proof of divine truth‚Äînot that you‚Äôre just annoying.

**Scriptural Misuse:** 

* *Luke 12:49, 53* is about division and eschatological tension‚Äînot door-to-door evangelism quotas. 
* *John 8:16, 29* gets invoked to imply Jesus had unwavering confidence; yet the Gospels show moments of doubt and frustration (see Gethsemane, Matt. 26:39).  
* None of these verses support modern proselytism or Watchtower‚Äôs metrics.

**Scholarly Insight:**

* According to the *Oxford Bible Commentary*, early Christian opposition stemmed from radical social and theological disruption‚Äînot quota-driven ministry. 
* *JANT* notes that messianic expectation in Jewish tradition called for political victory and liberation‚Äînot a crucified street preacher. Jesus didn‚Äôt fulfill those expectations‚Äîand that‚Äôs why many Jews rejected him.

# ¬∂12: Rhetoric for Risk ‚Äî Where ‚ÄòDon‚Äôt Force It‚Äô Means ‚ÄòTry Harder‚Äô Anyway

**WT Claim:** ‚ÄúJesus prepped his disciples to keep preaching through persecution, but not to force the message. Jehovah helps. Flee if needed.‚Äù

**Debunking:** Watchtower‚Äôs version of nuance: *Don‚Äôt force the message‚Äîjust keep trying until they beg you to leave.* Jesus told his disciples to be cautious, not to cold call strangers at noon in Compton. ‚ÄúShake the dust off your feet‚Äù wasn‚Äôt code for ‚Äúcount the hours and report back.‚Äù But here, you‚Äôre told to retreat *only* after you‚Äôve been ignored, rejected, and maybe fined‚Äîthen come back tomorrow. It‚Äôs persecution cosplay for people with territory maps.

* Not all resistance means you‚Äôre on the side of truth. Sometimes, people just don‚Äôt want your magazine.
* There's a difference between brave and stubborn. And between conviction and coercion.

* **Debunking:**
* Not all resistance means you‚Äôre on the side of truth. Sometimes, people just don‚Äôt want your magazine.

* **When does zeal become harassment?**
* **Is it noble to risk everything for a message that might not even be true?**
* **If Jesus said ‚Äúwalk away,‚Äù why does the org say ‚Äútry again‚Äù?**

**Fallacies & Manipulation:**

* Double-bind: You‚Äôre told not to pressure people‚Äîthen blamed for not doing more.
* Mixed messaging: Rejection is framed as both ‚Äúdon‚Äôt force it‚Äù *and* ‚Äúkeep planting seeds.‚Äù
* Appeal to fear: Implies any pushback proves you‚Äôre right, not just annoying.

**Logical Leaps:**

* If someone slams the door, it‚Äôs not because the message is bad‚Äîit‚Äôs ‚Äúseed planting.‚Äù
* If you're arrested or heckled, it‚Äôs divine approval, not public exhaustion.

**Scriptural Misuse:**

* Matt. 10:18‚Äì23, Luke 10:10‚Äì11: These are survival tips, not sales strategies.
* Jesus said to **flee**‚Äînot to persist, return, and tally refusals on a field service report.
* NOAB and JANT both confirm: These texts reflect first-century context, not door-to-door data collection.

**Scholarly Insight:**

* The apostles preached with urgency *when appropriate.* They weren‚Äôt bots. No records of ‚Äúplacements‚Äù or awkward gas station sermons.
* Context-driven ministry meant knowing when to speak‚Äîand when to shut up.

# ¬∂13: Prayer as Sales Fuel

**WT Claim:** ‚ÄúJehovah will help you keep preaching with zeal. Jesus prayed for it. The apostles proved it. So trust it.‚Äù

**Debunking:** This is classic Watchtower theology: circular, shallow, and convenient. They say Jehovah *will* support you because Jesus *prayed* for it‚Äîand we *know* that‚Äôs **true** **because**‚Ä¶ **the Bible says so**. But John 17 isn‚Äôt a prayer for door-to-door endurance. It‚Äôs a plea for unity, not quarterly conversion stats. (NOAB, John 17:11‚Äì21). There's no mention of cart shifts, territory assignments, or auxiliary hour goals.

In reality, Acts paints a chaotic picture of early Christianity: doubters, disagreements, theological brawls (see Acts 15, JANT). No unified preaching machine‚Äîjust a messy, evolving, human struggle to figure things out. Which makes this claim‚Äî""Jehovah will help you, just like the apostles""‚Äîsound less like divine reassurance and more like Watchtower HR trying to keep you from burning out.

* If prayer *guaranteed* divine support, Jehovah‚Äôs Witnesses wouldn‚Äôt have a pioneer burnout problem.
* If Jesus‚Äô prayer made success inevitable, why did most reject him?

* **If God‚Äôs support is guaranteed, why are so many pioneers exhausted?**
* **If you have to keep reminding people Jehovah** ***might*** **help them, is he?**

**Fallacies & Manipulation:**

* **Appeal to divine favoritism** (""Jehovah will help *you*"")
* **Magical thinking** (prayer = guaranteed support)
* **Circular logic** (the Bible says God helps, and we know the Bible is true because it says so)

**Logical Leaps:**

* If you‚Äôre struggling, it's not the method‚Äîit‚Äôs your lack of faith.
* If you're exhausted, you must not be praying hard enough.

**Scripture Abuse:**

* **John 17** is a prayer for *unity and protection*, not institutional sales support (NOAB).
* Using scripture as both premise and proof? That‚Äôs theological sleight of hand.

**Scholarly Insight:**

* The early church was divided, disorganized, and very human (Acts 15, JANT).
* Apostolic ‚Äúzeal‚Äù was inconsistent‚Äîand often in conflict.

# ¬∂14: God‚Äôs Work‚ÄîUnless the Law Says Stop

**WT Claim:** ‚ÄúEven when preaching is restricted, Jehovah‚Äôs people always find a way‚Ä¶ rely on Jehovah, not your own strength‚Ä¶ God will make a way.‚Äù

**Debunking:** This is Watchtower‚Äôs divine loophole clause. When laws say ‚Äústop,‚Äù they say ‚ÄúJehovah says go.‚Äù If that sounds like a **contradiction**, it is. Romans 13:1‚Äì2 says **obey the authorities**. But Watchtower says, *unless it‚Äôs about our literature‚Äîthen sneak them in through the restroom stall.* Jehovah‚Äôs ‚Äúpower‚Äù apparently looks like creative evasions and legal gray areas.

Risking your life for a cause may be noble‚Äîbut risking burnout, fines, or legal trouble to hand out literature that no one asked for? That‚Äôs not martyrdom. That‚Äôs **marketing with a persecution complex**. And no, ‚Äúfinding a discreet way‚Äù to preach isn‚Äôt holy‚Äîit's just side-stepping boundaries because the message can‚Äôt stand up to scrutiny or public interest.

  
Every religion has martyrs. That doesn‚Äôt make the message right. Persistence isn‚Äôt always proof of divine backing‚Äîit‚Äôs often just institutional inertia.

* Jehovah‚Äôs ‚Äúguidance‚Äù always seems to include breaking minor laws.
* If discreet preaching means hiding tracts in gas stations, maybe it‚Äôs not persecution‚Äîit‚Äôs just people being polite by ignoring you.

* **If the Bible says obey authorities, why does Watchtower encourage sidestepping them?**
* **If God wants the message spread, why not use dreams, visions, or... TikTok?**
* **Is it persecution when you‚Äôre banned‚Äîor just exhaustion from the public?**

**Fallacies & Manipulation:**

* Survivorship bias (look, it‚Äôs worked before!)
* Appeal to perseverance (if it‚Äôs hard, it‚Äôs holy!)
* Contradiction and special pleading (obey laws‚Ä¶ until we say don‚Äôt)
* Mythmaking (‚ÄúGod always supports the work!‚Äù)

**Logical Leaps:**

* Past ‚Äúsuccess‚Äù = future command.
* Every obstacle = test of loyalty.
* Any resistance = validation.

**Scriptural Misuse:**

* **Luke 21:12‚Äì15** is about persecution for *being Christian*, not for failing to distribute magazines. (OBC, Luke 21)
* **2 Tim 4:17** refers to Paul‚Äôs unique apostolic mission, not door-to-door quotas. (NOAB, 2 Timothy)
* **Romans 13:1‚Äì2** clearly says to obey governing authorities‚Äînot to interpret their silence as a divine green light.

**Scholarly Insight:**

* NT resistance centered on loyalty to Jesus over Caesar‚Äînot quota-driven persistence. (OBC, Romans; JANT, Luke)
* Early church persecution was often ethical or political, not about breaking city ordinance to drop a brochure.

# ¬∂15: Toxic Positivity as Gospel

**WT Claim:** ‚ÄúJesus stayed positive about preaching‚Äîhe saw potential everywhere.‚Äù

**Debunking:** Jesus wasn‚Äôt some door-to-door golden retriever wagging through Galilee. He was frustrated. He wept. He begged for help. He snapped at his disciples for being thick. This ‚Äúeternal optimist‚Äù bit is Watchtower‚Äôs retrofitted piety‚Äîc**rafted to guilt you into smiling while knocking on another locked gate**. The org cherry-picks ‚Äúthe harvest is great‚Äù while ignoring every time Jesus walked away shaking the dust off his sandals (Luke 9:5).

  
Optimism isn‚Äôt holiness. It can be gaslighting dressed in scripture.

  
If you keep calling a desert a harvest, don‚Äôt blame the soil. ‚ÄúThe harvest is great‚Äù‚Äîunless you‚Äôre in a gated community with a no-soliciting sign.

*  **If Jesus needed more workers, was the plan working?** 
* **When do you stop calling futility faith?** 
* **Does relentless optimism prove belief‚Äîor deny reality?**

**Fallacies & Manipulation:**  
Toxic positivity. Survivor bias. Rose-colored theology.

**Logical Leaps:**  
Every ‚Äúterritory‚Äù is now a ripe field, even if it‚Äôs a spiritual wasteland. If you‚Äôre not optimistic, you‚Äôre the problem‚Äînot the method.

**Scriptural Misuse:**  
John 4:35 and Matt. 9:37‚Äì38 are eschatological metaphors, not productivity charts (NOAB). Jesus‚Äô ‚Äúharvest‚Äù was theological, not statistical. And he cried over failed missions (Luke 19:41, JANT).

**Scholarly Insight:**  
Jesus‚Äô attitude wasn‚Äôt always upbeat‚Äîhe lamented, rebuked, even despaired. He didn‚Äôt chase conversions at all costs (OBC, Luke 9).

# ¬∂16: Misapplied Metaphors and the Parable Pep Talk

**WT Claim:** ‚ÄúJesus used illustrations like the mustard seed and leaven to encourage zeal. These prove the message will spread and succeed.‚Äù

**Debunking:** Watchtower grabs two parables, waves them like magic wands, and declares the ministry unstoppable‚Äîunless you stop showing up, of course. But Jesus wasn‚Äôt issuing growth guarantees; **he was often expressing frustration**. Mustard seeds and yeast? They spread quietly, unpredictably. You know, like doubt. If the Kingdom is like leaven, why does the Governing Body keep checking the oven, handing out pep talks, and demanding field service reports?

Christianity grew despite relentless proselytizing‚Äînot because of it. And not every parable is about you.

* **If growth is ‚Äúguaranteed,‚Äù why all the pressure?** 
* **And if God runs the Kingdom, why does he need your stopwatch?**

**Fallacies & Manipulation:** Misapplied metaphor, optimism bias, cherry-picked proof-texting, overgeneralization.

**Logical Leaps:** Parables about divine mystery get twisted into sales projections. Kingdom growth ‚â† JW territory expansion.

**Scriptural Misuse:** Luke 13:18‚Äì21 (NOAB, JANT) teaches that the Kingdom grows by God‚Äôs hand, not a door-to-door sales team. The parables are about divine unpredictability, not organizational inevitability.

**Scholarly Insight:** The early church didn‚Äôt track growth by publisher cards. They lived by faith, not field service metrics (NOAB, Luke 13).

# ¬∂17: Numbers Don‚Äôt Lie‚ÄîBut They Sure Don‚Äôt Tell the Truth

**WT Claim:** ‚ÄúMillions attend, thousands get baptized‚ÄîJehovah is gathering a great crowd!‚Äù

**Debunking:** Sounds impressive‚Äîuntil you remember that TikTok has more converts and McDonald‚Äôs serves more meals. If a ‚Äúgreat crowd‚Äù proves divine backing, then the Super Bowl is a sacred assembly and Taylor Swift is the Messiah. And let‚Äôs not talk about the *other* crowd‚Äî**the millions who quietly leave, fade, or get disfellowshipped and never return**. Funny how they never get mentioned during the publisher report.

Big numbers don‚Äôt prove truth. They prove **reach**. And propaganda always markets the gains‚Äînot the hemorrhaging exits. In fact, Pew Research and internal JW data suggest that growth is stagnant or declining in the West. So if the ‚Äúgreat crowd‚Äù is your metric, maybe it‚Äôs time to publish your *retention* numbers too.

* **If popularity proves truth, why not convert to Catholicism?**
* **If Jehovah‚Äôs backing is seen in growth, what do declining baptisms say?**
* **Why are you shown the influx‚Äîbut never the exodus?**

**Fallacies & Manipulation:** Appeal to popularity (ad populum), cherry-picking, survivorship bias. ‚ÄúLook how many joined!‚Äù‚Äîbut never ‚ÄúLook how many left.‚Äù

**Logical Leaps:** Growth = divine approval. Rejection = your lack of zeal.

**Scriptural Misuse:** Revelation 7:9, 14 (NRSVUE) describes a symbolic apocalyptic vision, not a Watchtower yearbook stat sheet.

* **NOAB (Revelation 7):** The ‚Äúgreat crowd‚Äù is a heavenly image of martyrs in a liturgical scene‚Äînot a demographic tally of 2024 magazine distributors. 
* **JANT (Revelation):** Symbolism is central; nothing here supports literal headcounts or monthly field service reports.

**Scholarly Insight:** The early church didn‚Äôt track baptisms on spreadsheets or boast about attendance at symbolic memorials. They were underground, not obsessed with optics.

# ¬∂18: The Zeal Test ‚Äì Or, How to Confuse Noise for Discipleship

**WT Claim:** ‚ÄúZeal for preaching is the mark of true discipleship‚Äîbe like the apostles. Let others see your zeal.‚Äù

**Debunking:** Watchtower wants you loud, visible, and exhausted‚Äîbecause if they can‚Äôt make you loving, they‚Äôll settle for loud. But Jesus didn‚Äôt say his followers would be known by their hours, their volume, or their territory coverage. **He said they‚Äôd be known by their love (John 13:35)**. When love runs thin, cults crank up the zeal. And when authenticity fades, performance takes the stage.

Zeal without reflection is just noise. Forced ‚Äúoutspokenness‚Äù isn‚Äôt courage‚Äîit‚Äôs branding.

If the apostles had to log publisher cards, the New Testament would be one paragraph long.

If volume proved virtue, televangelists would be saints.

**If love is the true mark of discipleship, why does Watchtower keep measuring activity instead?**

**Fallacies & Manipulation:** No True Scotsman, virtue signaling, historical revisionism. If you‚Äôre not out there handing out tracts, you‚Äôre not ‚Äúreally‚Äù a disciple? That‚Äôs not theology. That‚Äôs a quota.

**Logical Leaps:** Outward activity = inward truth. Recognition = righteousness.

**Scripture Abuse:** Acts 4:13 is about courage in the face of persecution, not passive-aggressively loitering by a cart. And John 13:35‚Äînot a peep about preaching. Just love. Real love. Not the performative kind.

**Scholarly Insight:** Apostolic zeal wasn‚Äôt coerced‚Äîit flowed from conviction, not counting time slips (OBC, Acts 4). The early church flipped tables, not magazines.

# Big-Picture

Strip away the ‚Äúzeal,‚Äù and what‚Äôs left? A treadmill of guilt, burnout, and obedience. This isn‚Äôt Christian discipleship‚Äîit‚Äôs a corporate quota system in a robe. The early Jesus movement was messy and alive: doubters, dissenters, arguments, and grace (see Acts 15, *JANT*). Watchtower‚Äôs version is sanitized, scripted, and engineered for control.

This article isn‚Äôt a study‚Äîit‚Äôs a performance review. The formula is clear: guilt for the tired, shame for the questioning, and pressure for the ‚Äúirregular.‚Äù Scriptures are props, not context. Prophecy is marketing. Testimonies are bait. Everything serves the same god: the numbers.

Patterns? Guilt. Fear. Bandwagon appeals. Emotional blackmail wrapped in phrases like ‚Äúassignment,‚Äù ‚Äúpersecution,‚Äù and ‚ÄúJehovah‚Äôs will.‚Äù You are the fuel. Doubt is the enemy. And rest is rebellion.

***This article isn‚Äôt spiritual food‚Äîit‚Äôs a blueprint for anxiety.***

* **Doubt = failure**
* **Fatigue = sin**
* **Relentless positivity = holiness**

It teaches you to override your own voice, suppress your emotions, and tie your value to unpaid labor. You‚Äôre told to keep going, no matter what it costs you. But real faith doesn‚Äôt demand silence. It welcomes the struggle.

**Question it:**

* Does honest faith require constant output?
* Is exhaustion a virtue‚Äîor a warning sign?
* Would Jesus measure love by hours logged, or compassion shown?
* Who profits from your burnout?
* Why is rest treated like weakness?

You‚Äôre not defective for being tired. You‚Äôre not broken for doubting. You‚Äôre human. And your conscience belongs to you.

If you‚Äôve ever felt the guilt, the pressure, the burnout‚Äîyou‚Äôre not alone. And you‚Äôre not the problem. The system is.

So question it. **Highlight every line they use to measure you.** Annotate your Watchtower with red ink and real questions. Compare it with real scholarship‚Äîstart with *NOAB*, *JANT*, *Oxford*. Watch Dan McClellan. Read Paula Fredriksen. Talk to ex-JWs. Talk to yourself. Then listen.

**Doubt is not sin.**  
**Fatigue is not failure.**  
**Your worth isn‚Äôt a field service report.**

Don‚Äôt let ‚Äúzeal‚Äù become your leash. Real faith stands up to questions. Real zeal doesn‚Äôt need applause.

**Stay skeptical. Stay free. And next time they hand you guilt, hand them a real question.**",6,1748006191.0,exjw,4,0.87,False

My wife and I have been on three RC cruises in past year, two on wonder and one on icon. We have gotten food package and drink package on every trip. We were extremely excited to compare the two cruise lines given the spring break trip on wonder was one month prior. 

From the jump, the quality of the check in process was way better on RC. The technology (the mobile app) made it abundantly clear RC was in the lead before getting on the ship.

Buffett:
Once on the ship, we went to the buffet for a quick bite to eat before our room was ready. The food was just ok and wasn‚Äôt too far off royals buffet, but keep in mind we usually don‚Äôt spend much time there given our speciality dining purchases in the past. The drinks were ok, however from the start my wife who loves wine was incredibly disappointed in the lack of choices for wine. In most cases it was just one offering per wine type. 

Room:
Room was great and very comparable to RC. With only one massive complaint. They only had usb ports on side of bed and I use usb c. So I had to charge phone on vanity instead of having it on night stand.

Specialty dining:
We were very much looking forward to this comparison as the food on Royal is one of its strongest features imo. We were incredibly disappointed. We went to Italian, French and steakhouse and decided not to spend any more money on food as all with the exception of the steakhouse were bad. I‚Äôd compare the quality to Outback Steakhouse at best for them. Where on Royal I‚Äôd say they‚Äôre around a 7.5-8.0 out of 10 in most cases. The fish was dry, the selection was terrible, and it was pricey to buy individual $40-60 pp plus tip would bring it to 100-140 for two to eat. Was the biggest let down of the trip imo.

Drink package:
We were close to the coffee bar so when I woke up I went down to the coffee bar to get a latte since we had the drink package. Little did I know, they charge for specialty coffee unlike Royal with the drink package. I was so upset given the royal experience. It made me so upset that I could order an espresso martini but couldn‚Äôt get a latte. It made no sense at all. Their coffee was terrible too btw. Above I stated how my wife is a wino and loves her wine. Even at the specialty restaurant there was no expanded wine list it was the same wine across the board. Very unfriendly for wine drinkers vs royal who has a larger selection.

Port process:
Very similar with minimal differences 

Casino:
Huge difference imo. Royal has black jack without shuffle machines on majority of tables where as NCL has almost no tables without machines. Slots were tight and very few were winning. Casino program was terrible, they charge you 30 per withdraw of a 1000 even after you reach their first tier status. Friendly staff however they hounded over you while playing which was very off putting imo. Texas holdem tournament was for a qualifier and not for pure cash. 10% take on holdem. Blackjack tournament was a qualifier and little cash prize. The casino seemed very non player friendly and was one of my biggest gripes outside of the food.

Activities: 
While they tried to have good activities I was for sure spoiled on the two large Royal ships and all they offer. So this is not apples to apples. However one of my biggest gripes was I played deal or no deal and won a picture from the photo center. I had my picture taken by a profession board in front of the glacier and opted out of using my phone as a backup. I go to the photo center to learn my ‚Äúfree‚Äù photo I won was really 50% off a $30 digital copy of one photo. I was irate and this was the icing on the cake for me.

Overall:
Royal is night and day better than NCL and it wasn‚Äôt close. From before you get on ship with app experience to all the other small things that make or break a trip.
We will not be ‚Äúcheating‚Äù on Royal again and I hope this review helps others on the fence between the two cruise lines.",4,1748006071.0,royalcaribbean,2,0.83,False

The Summer Infant 32780B 3Dlite ST Convenience Stroller has been my reliable companion through errands, park strolls, and busy airport terminals. Its sleek black-and-gray design gives it an understated elegance, great for parents who appreciate style without the frills. The lightweight steel frame weighs just 15 pounds, making it manageable even while juggling a diaper bag and a fussy baby. Its portability is a significant win, particularly during short strolls or when navigating through crowded areas. Though compact, the stroller unfolds into a full-sized seating area that accommodates infants up to 50 pounds‚Äîa thoughtful touch for prolonged usability.  

**Ease of Use and Folding Mechanism**  

Over multiple outings, I found the folding feature to be a real lifesaver. The stroller folds compactly and locks automatically, which has been especially handy when catching public transportation or storing it in a small car trunk. The compact size doesn‚Äôt compromise ease of use; unfolding and setting it up takes mere seconds, allowing me to focus on my child instead of wrestling with an uncooperative frame. The auto-lock mechanism adds a layer of convenience, ensuring it stays securely folded during storage or transport.  

[Find the best price for Summer Infant 32780B 3Dlite ST Convenience Stroller on Amazon.](https://babycareshop.com/p/b0bmj5fl3l/)  

**Safety Features and Secure Strapping**  

Safety has always been a top priority for me, and this stroller ensures peace of mind. The 5-point safety harness adjusts easily to fit my child snugly, keeping them secure during our walks. On one occasion, my curious toddler tried to wriggle out, but the harness held strong. Additionally, the front wheels come with anti-shock features, providing a smoother ride even on cobblestone streets. The lockable rear wheels add to its stability, making it steady on uneven terrain‚Äîa necessity for urban parents.  

**Impressive Storage Options**  

Storage space can make or break a stroller for me, and this one doesn‚Äôt disappoint. I‚Äôve utilized the extra-large storage basket under the seat to carry groceries, diapers, and toys‚Äîalthough staying within the 10-pound limit is crucial. The rear storage pocket is fantastic for smaller essentials like my keys and phone. As a bonus, the cup holder is a nice touch for keeping my coffee close on early morning walks.  

**Comfort for Child and Parent**  

The multi-position recline is one of the standout features. Whether my baby is napping or curiously observing the world, there‚Äôs an angle for every situation. On particularly sunny days, the stroller‚Äôs adjustable, removable canopy with a flip-out sun visor offered enough coverage to shield my child from direct sunlight. While pushing, I noticed the stroller‚Äôs handle height to be ergonomic and comfortable for longer strolls, which is a pleasant surprise for tall parents like me.  

**Strengths**  

- Lightweight design, perfect for travel or quick errands.  
- Sizeable storage basket and additional rear pocket.  
- Durable steel frame that feels sturdy and reliable.  
- Multi-position recline for child comfort.  
- Compact fold, coupled with auto lock for storage ease.  

**Areas for Improvement**  

- The storage basket‚Äôs 10-pound limit could be restrictive for families carrying more gear.  
- Lack of car seat compatibility makes it less versatile for newborns.  
- Not suited for rough, unpaved terrains due to its basic wheel design.  

**Competing Products**  

While testing this stroller, I considered alternatives such as the UPPAbaby G-Luxe and the Kolcraft Cloud Plus. The UPPAbaby G-Luxe boasts superior suspension, which provides an even smoother ride. However, it comes at a higher price point and is marginally heavier. On the other hand, the Kolcraft Cloud Plus offers excellent storage options and similar portability, but its build doesn‚Äôt feel as robust as this stroller. The Summer Infant 3Dlite ST, in comparison, hits a sweet spot between affordability, practicality, and reliability, making it a well-rounded choice for most parents.  

**Value for Money**  

Cost-efficiency is another strong suit of this stroller. While there are pricier models offering additional features, this one manages to strike a balance with its ergonomic build, practicality, and premium feel at a mid-tier price. Given its durability and convenience, I‚Äôd say it‚Äôs worth every penny for parents looking for an everyday stroller that won‚Äôt break the bank.

Stereolab are a difficult band to pin down; they refuse to adhere to one musical-label. They‚Äôre adventurous and steady at the same time. They‚Äôre controlled and uninhibited. Jazzy and rocky all at once and sometimes many times during one song.

After a while of not being active on the front footed scene they‚Äôre back with Instant Holograms On Metal Films.

Thirteen tracks at sixty minutes.

I have had it for repeat for three days. That‚Äôs a consequence of one of the riddles of online promotion when seemingly the album isn‚Äôt out and yet the reviews are out and in some of the comments left for the reviewer there are links to where to obtain the music.

But aside from that nonsense:

How‚Äôs the music.

I really enjoyed it. You have to be patient, StereoLab‚Äôs music is not a one bam thank you ma‚Äôam (shakes head)

You have to listen and be aware of all the subtleties because their music is reflective like on Immortal Hands. It is evocative like on the opener track Mystical Plosives.

Do they still have an experimental edge? Yes, they do. Melodie Is A Wound is a deceiving track that starts in the most unassuming way only to turn into a seven minute exploration on different tendencies.

Special attention to the ender If You Remember I forgot How To Dream PT2. My favorite track by a mile. It is like a French Rhapsody-llulaby-watching people go by while drinking coffee of layers after layers of instruments coming together. A special attention to the voice sharing duties and the Anglo-French collaboration it is still strong as ever.

As I always insist. This is not a review so if you want to be critical and take this apart get active on the thread and we will discuss it.

If you like it go and get it.

1ktj58z,https://www.reddit.com/r/BPDlovedones/comments/1ktj58z/i_am_losing_hope/,I Am Losing Hope,"This is my first post here. My story is a very long one but I am going to compress it a bit‚Ä¶
I am the pWOBPD. My husband (whom I have been with for almost 11 years, married 5) is the pwBPD. He is 32 & was formally diagnosed at 21 when the girlfriend before me found the courage to leave him & it ended with him having a mental hospital stay (unbeknownst to me at the time). 
We met because I went in to his family business looking for a job. I was hired on the spot by his dad who would later admit he didn‚Äôt have a job ready for me but hired me because I am pretty and his son needed someone new. 
Well it worked. Even though I had been in a long distance relationship at the time, after weeks of him begging me to go on a date with him, I relented. It was good at first. 
About a month in to our relationship was our first DV incident. He broke my face. 
I was afraid to leave. I came from a broken home and was desperate to get out of there, so the violence was ‚Äúnormal‚Äù for me. 
Two months after that, my birth control failed and I fell pregnant. I had found the courage to leave state and try to start fresh with my grandpa. A week later I found out about my pregnancy. I was scared, he was apologetic, so I came back. My parents had cut contact with me for my decision, which made the choice to return to him at his parent‚Äôs house easier. 
My pregnancy was very stressful and full of abuse. A couple of times he put his hands on me but it was mostly verbal and mental abuse. He would berate me when guys would comment on my posts as if I could control what other people said. He would question everywhere I went and soon had Find My Friends on me. He criticized my only friend, alienated me from my family, called me a dumb bitch all the time‚Ä¶
It‚Äôs embarrassing to write all of this out. I know the obvious answer is that I should‚Äôve gotten away again and stayed away. But I was just so mentally broken by even this point.
After I had our child, things kind of improved enough to where I had hope (not sure why, or for what) and we got married at the end of 2019. 
He showed up late, drunk and on coke to our wedding photos. I should‚Äôve left then, but I didn‚Äôt. 
The last ten years have been peppered with lies and betrayals of every kind. Abuse of every manner. I have tried leaving a couple more times only to be reeled back in by his love bombing and sweet lies. I should have probably also mentioned that he had me be a stay at home mom because he didn‚Äôt want our child in daycare‚Ä¶ so for a few years I had no job and no source of my own income. He controls all of the finances to this day. I have no access whatsoever to any of the money that comes in. He makes nearly 500K a year and gives me a weekly ‚Äúallowance‚Äù of $450 that I am supposed to use on groceries and whatever is left he expects me to save some, and if I want to have lunch or a coffee, I better hope it‚Äôs in my budget. I have a remote job now but it doesn‚Äôt pay very much, but it‚Äôs something. I‚Äôve been trying to save money but it‚Äôs very slow going. I just want out. 
He has sleep problems, and he prevents me from sleeping often, so it makes doing my job and other things very difficult. If he thinks I‚Äôm about to fall asleep, he will shake me, or cock his gun and turn on the flashlight, or yell at me and tell me I don‚Äôt care about him and how I basically ‚Äúsuck‚Äù‚Ä¶.I‚Äôve tried leaving the room to sleep elsewhere but he‚Äôll just find me wherever I am and wake me. I sometimes only get 2-3 hours of sleep even though I am the one who gets up at 6am to take our daughter to a school across town because that‚Äôs where he wanted her to go. And he gets to stay in bed and sleep in. 
This is all just a DROP in the bucket. I am so mentally drained. If I even kind of show any expression of being upset, tired, etc, he gets angry with me and starts ‚Äúmatching my energy‚Äù as he likes to say. So he‚Äôll just start being super mean or critical of me, telling me I only stand to make his life harder and how unhappy I make him‚Ä¶. And God help me. I am just so sick of this life. I used to be so full of life and I just feel‚Ä¶.empty. He has ran off all my friends by either hating them or trying to fuck them. My family lives out of state. I am isolated. I have no money and a dwindling shred of hope for my own future.

I am thoroughly disgusted that even more people are more ignorant than I thought possible beyond my immediate family.

Right before the age of 40 I passed out waiting for a table at a nice restaurant, slowly drinking a beer. Luckily I had not been a heavy, medium, or even light drinker for almost 10 years.  All I really had physically wrong with me at that time was testosterone therapy, come shoulder surgeries, and chronic,sometimes horrible pain. Oh, I was also told I had a great, really great bronze California tan.

After that incident right before age 40 I had every test I could have done to explain what happened.  Witnesses said, im 6'3 195+ lbs, I just turned white, became instantly soaking  wet, and fell straight backwards like a 2x4.

After all the tests were completed I discovered my Iron(its really called ferratin) was at a level of 3,900 (normal safe levels are 50 to 200 roughly.  I was given a genetic test for hemachromatosis,  which is pretty common, and not a super big deal when treated early.  In fact, anyone with hemachromatosis cam firmly state that we people,all people, black, while, whatever are related.  Black people have a genetic disease called sickle cell disease.  If not treated and allowed to run rampart sickle cell turns into hemachromatosis. Nuff said.

The main treatment for hemachromatosis is bloodletting, the amount of blood you need to get out of your body and how much at a time and how often is usually dictated by the level of your ferritin in your blood at time of diagnosis.  Most people, fortunately,  get detected and treated by 700 to 1500 level of Ferratin.  The body is basically killing itself, ""rusting away"" to say at levels if 1,000 plus of ferritin.

Now five leads later, testosterone implants every 3 months or so, bloodletting (phlebotomy) treatment 4 times a year now ( I started giving over 550 grams of blood 2 times a week for 4 months, and then once a week 4 or 5 months, and so on and on.  I have had a pretty extensive cervical neck surgery, cages, holes drilled in arthritic areas and nerve openings opened up, both hips totally replaced, a knee replacement on left knee coming up soon, always a pain in my ass,, literally,, lol.  There's other things, I have to get liver biopsies every year, heart tests performed every year, no alcohol, low Vtamin C diet, no more liver and onions, and reduced use of cast iron and other high iron cooking and eating utensils.

Thing is,, if you see me just see me, you'll see a big, strong, agile, balanced man.  But what you dont see is how hard it is for me to just get up and drink a cup of coffee some mornings, or how bad both legs ache, hurt, throb, and sometimes especially feel totally exhausted 2 hours after I wake up.  Or a serious neck, nerve issue that I just keep massaging and turning my head.

I don't take opiates, except after surgeries, I can't take much Tylenol or ibuprofen and related.  Mostly ice pack/machine, heat pads, hot hot bath soaks, stretching (carefully), keeping moving, and pushing myself everyday or at least 6 days a week harder than the day before.

I have half siblings, 17+ years older than me, with bone spurs, maybe knee replacement, obesity related issues, lack of movement/ exercise issues, and on and on.

I'd happily trade places with them, but keep my age, and very few people I imagine get what I'm about to say next . I decided after the first 6 months of diagnosis I was going to ""break and fall apart before I rusted and rotted away"".

Do you get that?  Understand ?  I am happy, no I get exited and thrilled inside when I see people with obvious issues, obesity, laziness, bad diet, drinking, etc struggle, not do, or unwilling to do things they should do, much less want to do to make this life more,, make this life better for themselves.  I say F' u all those ignorant dumb lazy scared people that say things, think things, act differently when they interact with you, not knowing you closely and really knowing you, when they see this person that looks, moves, and does lots of physical things better than they can,, and they think your faking or putting on or playing poor pity party me,,, no screw you guys,, try, literally walking 10,000 or more steps in my shoes each day and more, yet sometimes not able to even crawl or move for 2 or 3 hours after 4 or 5 or less some days just living life.

Anyone else have similar stories ? Or experiences?  I still can't get over the fact that had a been a normal,, or whatever you call a person who drinks a six pack a week, alcoholic drinker I would definitely for sure have had cirrhosis or liver cancer by now for sure and probably  be dead.  Anyway,, let me know thanks.

You‚Äôve never been this deep into Council territory without a permit, a planetary escort, and a dozen paranoid officials hovering behind you like gossiping shadows. But now?

Now you land in the capital orbit without so much as a warning shot.

Your ship floats silently into the administrative docking ring of *Trinax Prime*, the oldest world in the Council‚Äôs original triad. A place so ceremonial it has an entire moon just for official announcements.

You‚Äôre not here to attack.  
Not even to negotiate.  
You‚Äôre here to *walk.*

The docking bay lights are dimmed. Fewer guards than expected. More cameras.

The AI whispers dryly, ‚ÄúWe‚Äôre being watched. From every angle.‚Äù

‚ÄúLet them,‚Äù you reply.

You exit the ship in your standard uniform. No embellishment. Just the Terran insignia: a spiral galaxy overlaid by a single word‚Äî**choice.**

You walk through the corridor like gravity owes you rent.

Past Council agents pretending not to notice you.

Past ambassadors glued to silent holoscreens.

No one stops you.

You‚Äôre not a ghost. You‚Äôre a *test.*

You reach the tribunal hall.

You know the layout from simulations‚Äîtall glass walls, stonework from a dozen planets, air purified with quiet guilt. A place where judgment is spoken in delicate tones and dissent is often mistaken for confusion.

They‚Äôre already waiting.

The *Voice of the Council*, sitting atop their spire, flanked by representatives who look equal parts curious and terrified.

You nod politely. ‚ÄúThanks for not vaporizing me.‚Äù

The Voice replies, ‚ÄúWe considered it.‚Äù

‚ÄúCharming.‚Äù

You take your place at the center‚Äîno podium, no shield. Just a ring of light forming beneath your feet. A stage, intentional or not.

The Voice begins.

>

You let them finish.

Then you speak.

‚ÄúYour peace is a silence enforced.  
Your order is obedience confused for cooperation.  
You built a council, yes‚Äîbut you forgot it was supposed to be *shared.*‚Äù

Murmurs ripple through the chamber.

You continue.

‚ÄúWe‚Äôre not here to destroy.  
We‚Äôre here to *decline*.  
We‚Äôre not asking for freedom.  
We‚Äôre *exercising* it.‚Äù

The Voice leans forward. ‚ÄúAnd what do you expect us to do with that?‚Äù

You shrug. ‚ÄúCatch up. Or don‚Äôt.‚Äù

Somewhere in the balcony, a delegate‚Äîyoung, feathered, shimmering‚Äîstands.

‚ÄúI‚Äôve heard their broadcasts,‚Äù she says. ‚ÄúI listened. I *believed.*‚Äù

Gasps.

Another stands. ‚ÄúWe were first to sign the Accords. I now rescind them.‚Äù

The Voice shouts, ‚ÄúThat is *illegal!*‚Äù

The AI hums in your ear, ‚ÄúThey‚Äôve lost control of the room.‚Äù

You smile. ‚ÄúI noticed.‚Äù

The Voice rises‚Äîtall, imposing, full of a legacy you just unraveled.

‚ÄúIf you leave this chamber,‚Äù they say, ‚Äúyou‚Äôll have sparked the disbandment of centuries of governance. You‚Äôll fracture unity.‚Äù

You nod. ‚ÄúGood. It‚Äôs not unity if it demands silence.‚Äù

Some galactic historians argue that this moment‚Äîthe quiet, defiant walk out of the tribunal chamber‚Äîmarked the *official* end of the old Council era.

Not with an explosion.

Not with a declaration.

But with the *absence of fear*.

You pass through the exit.

No one follows.

But more than a few *watch.*

And a few‚Ä¶ begin to *stand.*

‚Ä¶

Back on your ship, you lift off in silence.

Trinax Prime falls away behind you. Still majestic. Still stubborn.

But no longer untouchable.

‚ÄúWhere to?‚Äù the AI asks.

You stare at the star map.

Dozens of new coordinates blink. Open channels. Encrypted messages. Invitations.

From the unaligned.

From the defectors.

From the *curious.*

‚ÄúNowhere,‚Äù you say. ‚ÄúLet them come to *us.*‚Äù

You flick the comms to open transmission and say, calmly:

‚ÄúWe‚Äôre not looking for converts.  
We‚Äôre looking for company.‚Äù

And the galaxy listens.

Because the void is no longer empty.  
It‚Äôs *full of questions.*

The stars aren‚Äôt any closer than they were.  
But somehow, they feel warmer.

You sit in your ship‚Äôs command chair, legs curled up beneath you, sipping recycled tea from a metal cup that predates most of your enemies. The console hums softly, a chorus of distant messages threading through the void.

None of them come from Earth.

That‚Äôs by design.

Because this was never about Earth.

It was about *everyone else.*

About the ones who never dared say no. The ones who stopped asking what permission felt like. The ones who thought the sky had a ceiling, just because no one ever told them otherwise.

You take a breath and watch the comms panel overflow‚Äîslowly, steadily. Like a tide coming in. Some of the messages are confused. Some are furious. Some are joyfully incoherent. One appears to be entirely constructed from metaphors involving sentient ink.

But all of them are speaking.  
No longer silent.  
No longer waiting.

And you?

You‚Äôre just the tuning fork.

The AI speaks quietly, like it doesn‚Äôt want to break the moment.

‚ÄúWe‚Äôve received a signal.‚Äù

‚ÄúAnother broadcast?‚Äù

‚ÄúNo. A meeting request.‚Äù

You glance at the screen.

The sender ID: *The Unaligned Council.*

You raise an eyebrow. ‚ÄúDidn‚Äôt exist yesterday.‚Äù

‚ÄúIt does now.‚Äù

You lean forward, squinting.

There are seven signatories. None of them former powerhouses. None of them names anyone would recognize from a war or a treaty.

Just *survivors.*

You open the message. It's short.

>

You don‚Äôt hesitate.

‚ÄúTell them yes.‚Äù

And in a quiet corner of the galaxy, seven species who've never shared a table build one together.

No oaths.  
No flags.  
Just chairs.

And an extra one‚Äîleft empty.

*Your* chair.

‚Ä¶

Later, when the AI asks if you want to go, you nod. Not out of duty. Not for the history books.

Just because you promised yourself that if you ever found the others‚Äî*the quiet rebels*‚Äîyou‚Äôd listen. Not lead. Not preach.

Just *listen.*

And maybe‚Ä¶ share stories.

Not of war.

Of *reminders.*

You arrive at the meeting station. It‚Äôs modest. There‚Äôs no flag. No crest. No anthem.

But when you step aboard, every face turns to you and does something no Council member ever did.

They *smile.*

Not because they expect you to fix anything.

But because you reminded them they could fix themselves.

You take your seat.

And as conversation begins‚Äîtentative, awkward, hopeful‚Äîyou realize something strange:

This is what power feels like.

Not domination.  
Not fear.  
*Invitation.*

You lean back, close your eyes for just a moment, and let it wash over you.

The knowledge that no matter what the Council tries next, no matter what storms they summon in desperation‚Ä¶

The galaxy already heard your answer.

And for the first time in living memory‚Ä¶

It‚Äôs *listening.*  
\---  
The ship drifts in the quiet between stars, no longer alone, no longer hunted, but not quite safe either. And that‚Äôs okay.

Because safety was never the point.

You lean back in your chair, eyes closed, letting the soft hum of the ship lull you into stillness. Messages continue to flow in the background‚Äîgentle pulses of thought, hope, uncertainty. The language of a galaxy waking up from a very long, very polite nap.

You think of that empty chair left for you. Of all the voices starting to overlap into something like a song. Not harmonious, not yet‚Äîbut getting there.

You think of the girl on Cyra-9, and her quiet question: *Are we allowed to dream again?*

And you remember your answer.

Yes.

Maybe not because someone said so.  
But because you chose to.

Because sometimes, the bravest thing isn‚Äôt rebellion.  
It‚Äôs *refusal.*

Refusing to shrink.  
To comply.  
To wait for a yes you never needed.

You feel the rhythm of the ship‚Äôs engine fade into your pulse. Steady. Grounded.

Somewhere in the dark, new alliances are forming. Quiet ones. Uneven. Messy. *Human.*

And that might be exactly what the galaxy needs.

No throne.  
No empire.

Just a seat at the table, and the guts to say:

‚ÄúI think we can do better.‚Äù

You let your thoughts drift, slow and soft, until they blur with the hum of the stars.

No explosions. No speeches.

Just stillness.

And starlight.

I‚Äôve know for a while that French press coffee has higher oils but I never worried about it too much because I‚Äôve never had cholesterol issues. I‚Äôve started drinking a lot more French press coffee in the last year.

Now I need a substitute that tastes just as delicious but is also equally hands off.  Right now my electric kettle heats up automatically every morning. Takes me 30 seconds to grind beans (locally roasted) and fill up the carafe.  It sits for four minutes while I brush my teeth, I fill up my travel mug (equivalent of 2-2.5 cups) and then I‚Äôm out the door. I can happily drink it black. I sip it throughout the morning and then switch to water. 

I‚Äôve tried pouring the French press coffee through a paper filter but it‚Äôs a little slow and messing up my hectic morning routine. 

I tried pour over for the first time today with a paper filter and it‚Äôs just meh.  Maybe my technique is off but it‚Äôs watery. I‚Äôm opening to buying a machine or other equipment as long as I don‚Äôt have to babysit it and it makes a large enough amount at a time.  I know I could just get a drip coffee setup but I feel like they alway tastes burnt (haven‚Äôt tried with my local beans though)

I would ask this in the coffee sub but I‚Äôm afraid I will literally get roasted there üòÇ

They sit in a glass jar on the coffee table like some creepy trophy‚Äîso big I can see the hair on their backs from across the room. And even though they‚Äôre perfectly dead, perfectly pinned, perfectly harmless, I still glance at them every few minutes just to make sure. The firelight makes their too-many eyes glisten, and it freaks me out.

I don‚Äôt like spiders. But I don‚Äôt say that out loud, not with my uncle lounging in the leather armchair across from mine, buried in a book with a title I can‚Äôt even pronounce. He‚Äôs still as a statue, but he sits like a predator‚Äîcoiled and ready. If I ask him to move the jar, the questions will start. He‚Äôll ask why, and if I admit I‚Äôm a little scared, he‚Äôll launch into a lecture about how they‚Äôre dead, how they‚Äôre fascinating, and how I have *nothing* to be afraid of. I‚Äôll be lucky if he doesn‚Äôt try to do exposure therapy. Then would come the panic, the screaming, possibly blood‚Äîand this time, Mom *definitely* won‚Äôt let me visit unsupervised.

But I *like* visiting him. Exposure therapy threats and all. I‚Äôm the one who asked to stay for the weekend‚Äîmy eighteenth‚Äôs next week, and he‚Äôs always treated me like an adult. Even when I was six. So, it felt right to spend one last weekend wrapped in his weirdness before I become a ""real"" adult.

I should at least try to keep him out of trouble. Which means pretending the spiders aren‚Äôt watching my every move.

‚ÄúSher,‚Äù I say.

No answer. Just the crackle of the fire.

‚ÄúSherry,‚Äù I try again. I almost smile‚Äîridiculous nicknames are hard to say with a straight face‚Äîbut I keep my tone even.

Finally, he looks up, eyes narrowing like he‚Äôs trying to spot the prank.

‚ÄúMe? You‚Äôre talking to *me*?‚Äù

‚ÄúYes, of course. Who else? The book?‚Äù

‚ÄúWhat did you call me?‚Äù

‚ÄúSher. Then I tried Sherry.‚Äù

‚ÄúNeither is my name.‚Äù

‚ÄúYeah, well, that‚Äôs kind of the point of a nickname.‚Äù

He squints like he‚Äôs trying to figure out if I‚Äôm joking. I am, but I‚Äôve got the world‚Äôs most innocent face on. He‚Äôs not sure.

‚ÄúPlease don‚Äôt invent ‚Äònicknames‚Äô for me.‚Äù

‚ÄúAlright. *Uncle*, then.‚Äù

He grunts and returns to his book. ‚ÄúThat remains to be seen.‚Äù

‚ÄúWhat, you want to do another genetic test? I‚Äôll agree to it if I can give your number to my science teacher. Pretty sure she fell in love when I told her about your last DIY DNA kit.‚Äù

His eyes widen like I‚Äôve suggested eating glass. ‚ÄúAbsolutely not.‚Äù

This time I can‚Äôt help it, and a snort escapes me. God, I love talking to my uncle. He makes me feel like the *normal* one in the room. And even if he‚Äôs never said it, I know I‚Äôm his favorite niece.

Which reminds me‚Äî

‚ÄúHey, there‚Äôs something I‚Äôve been meaning to ask.‚Äù

‚ÄúWhat now?‚Äù

A second passes before I gather the courage to ask the question that‚Äôs been eating at me. In the end, I can‚Äôt find a way to bring it up naturally so I just say it. ‚ÄúHave you ever gotten tested for autism?‚Äù

His head snaps up. ‚ÄúWhat? Why?‚Äù

‚ÄúWell... you kinda fit the profile.‚Äù

‚ÄúOh, do I.‚Äù

‚ÄúYeah. Like‚Äî‚Äù I close my book, stretch out of the armchair with a creak of leather, and pad across the room to my bag. ‚ÄúHang on.‚Äù

I grab my laptop, plop back down, click a couple tabs, and pull up the first online quiz I‚Äôd bookmarked. I know the questions by heart, but I read them out anyway, theatrically.

‚ÄúOkay. First one: Do you notice patterns or small details others tend to miss?‚Äù

He says nothing, just stares like I‚Äôve grown a second head.

‚ÄúI‚Äôll mark that as a yes,‚Äù I say, scrolling down. ‚ÄúNext: I can tell if someone‚Äôs getting bored when I‚Äôm talking. Oh, wait‚Äîwe know the answer to that one. Remember that Christmas dinner? The three-hour monologue on distinguishing tobacco ashes? Also answers the one about collecting information obsessively‚Äî‚Äù

He lurches forward and snatches the laptop. ‚ÄúGive me that.‚Äù

I watch as his eyes skim the screen, his frown deepening. I try not to bounce my knee.

‚ÄúSome of these are *no*,‚Äù he mutters.

‚ÄúBut a lot are *yes*, right?‚Äù

He hands it back with a sceptic twist to his mouth. ‚ÄúSince when are you a psychologist?‚Äù

I shrug. ‚ÄúI‚Äôm Gen Z with Wi-Fi. Of course I‚Äôm an amateur psychologist.‚Äù

‚ÄúI thought your generation was all about *not* putting people in boxes.‚Äù

‚ÄúYou know, I can‚Äôt tell if we‚Äôre into *not* boxing people or just building enough boxes so everyone fits into one. I didn‚Äôt read the memo.‚Äù

A reluctant smile tugs at his lips. ‚ÄúYou and me both. Wait‚Äîwhat generation am I again?‚Äù

I grin. ‚ÄúSomewhere between Gen X and millennial, I think. But honestly, Uncle, I‚Äôd say you‚Äôre timeless.‚Äù

I throw in an exaggerated wink. He shakes his head and I get a smile out of him.

‚ÄúCan we eat now?‚Äù I ask, standing and stretching against the warmth of the fireplace. ‚ÄúThe living room‚Äôs getting stuffy.‚Äù

His smile sharpens. He snaps the book shut. ‚ÄúLet me guess‚Äîyour mom packed you a week‚Äôs worth of sandwiches again?‚Äù

‚ÄúObviously. She‚Äôs still traumatized.‚Äù

He rolls his eyes. ‚ÄúIt was one time. And durian is a perfectly respectable fruit. You just can‚Äôt trust the smell.‚Äù

He heads toward the kitchen, and I snag the sandwich bag on our way out. But before I step through the door, I glance back at the coffee table‚Äîand the hairy spiders trapped under glass.

He didn‚Äôt deny it. He shrugged it off, sure, but he didn‚Äôt scoff or talk me down. He didn‚Äôt try to explain it away. And ever since my therapist said it ran in families, I‚Äôve held onto that hope‚Äîthat maybe I wasn‚Äôt alone in this.

Yup. If it means feeling this seen, this *normal*, I‚Äôll take a hundred dead spiders in glass jars.

1ktiysc,https://www.reddit.com/r/Advice/comments/1ktiysc/i_am_doing_everything_so_i_dont_lose_my_spark/,"I am doing everything so I don't lose my spark over this 9-6 job, what else can I do?","Hello everybody, I hope you all are doing great,

I feel like my concern needs a little context, so I am starting there. 

I (29F) am a very energetic person. I worked since I was 22 years old, did a 4 years retail job then paused to finish my studies, and after I graduated I started a desk job at travel agency company and worked there for 9 months. I felt like I was losing my mind, I did an office job before that, but it didn't felt as imprisoned as that one. I had to work 9-5 and I didn't have any time left for ANYTHING that I cared about. At the end of the day I always felt tired, couldn't wait to go home (lived 30 minutes away), shower, eat something and rest, so I thought I better quit this job and something better will come along. I know that this sounds strange to the most countries in the world, but I live with my parents and my brother and his family, it's common where I come from to live with your family until you get married, so I didn't have to mind things like: rent, electric bills, etc, since we own a huge house and my brother takes care of everything.

I live in a small city where is really hard to find a suitable job and for a whole year I looked online, searched any possible option within my ""ideal"" job, but I couldn't find anything, at this point I was ready to move out to a different city, but luck wasn't on my side on that case either.

I can't lie, I enjoyed my un-employed era so much, since money wasn't a problem for me, which I am so grateful for btw, I read books, I took care of my body, ate healthy, spent time with my loved ones, went out on coffee dates with my friends, brunches, etc.. But, through all the time there was a guilt inside me feeling worthless or doing nothing to improve myself professionally. 

My brother owns a business and he got an opportunity to open a second one, but with a partner (friend of his), so they needed someone who they trust and who is capable of the job (the work involves a lot of money activities). So, my brother asked me to start a job in his company until the company starts in a good foot and until I find something better.

I swore I will never do again a 9-5 job, but it was my brothers company, I was free with my time and of course I felt I needed to step in, I would step in even for free, since my brother takes care of everything and it has always been my biggest supporter in everything since I can remember myself. 

I have to work from Monday to Saturday from 9:00 in the morning, until 18:00 in the afternoon.  
In the beginning, I didn't mind it, because I knew it will last only a couple months since we open another shop, and then we'll figure it out the exact working hours and days off, and doing most of the work to help the company improve, made me feel so good, and my brother being one of my bosses made that feeling stronger. 

But, those couple months became 7 months at this point, and it's driving me NUTS.  
We've discussed this with my brother and his partner, and they are trying to find a solution as soon as possible, they'll hire someone else in June probably, but my battery is almost dead.

I wake up at 6:30 in the morning, get ready, go to CrossFit (I started it 6 months ago), come straight in my work, and I am sitting at my desk for 9 hours a day, with non stop clients coming in and going out, sometimes I can't even eat my food ( I have no breaking hours either), and when I finish my shift, there are so rarely moments I go out for coffee, usually I go straight up in my home, my energy dries up, I just do what I need to do, and I sleep immediately. 

This has been my life for the past 7 months and I am feeling so low, I never get dressed how I used to, I gained weight, I don't feel as beautiful as I did before, I don't have the energy to read books, to go on walks anymore or to do my hobbies. I only have my Sunday free, and usually I have to wash my clothes, clean my room, or I spend all my day in bed doing nothing but scrolling on my phone. I feel my confidence going down, but every time I feel like that, I remind myself how privileged and grateful I should feel, I remind myself that this isn't going to last forever and that's what gets me up in the morning.

I still try to be positive and look at the bright side: I do physical activities every morning, I try to do that also during the day in my office because I hate the feeling of being sat all day, I get to work alone in my office which I truly like because whenever I have some free time I can watch something on YouTube, sometimes a movie, sometimes just scroll through Reddit or social media, I drink my coffee in the morning, during the day sometimes also, I don't have a strict boss over my head, I can contribute to the company of my brother while also having my own salary, and things like that.

I negotiated with both of my bosses about my requirements and we are trying to  meet in the middle.   
  
Me and my brother never mess business with our siblings relationship, I have to report 90% of the work related things to his partner, since my brother doesn't want to be involved that much in decision making of the company, only fundamental things. He has his own business to care of and pretty much this is the whole dynamic in our work related situation.   
  
I don't want to let him down, I also am a person who has really good work ethic no matter who I work for, but I am feeling mentally so down.  
  
What can I add to my mentality, or routine so I can keep my ""spark"" alive and get my confidence back?

1ktiycc,https://www.reddit.com/r/DesiKitchenGear/comments/1ktiycc/moving_out_heres_what_you_actually_need_to_clean/,Moving Out? Here‚Äôs What You Actually Need to Clean in the Kitchen (and What to Use),"If you‚Äôre packing up and moving out, don‚Äôt forget one of the most overlooked (and heavily inspected) spots in your place: the kitchen. Landlords *will* notice if you leave behind grease, crumbs, or mystery stains. And if you‚Äôre hoping to get that security deposit back, a clean kitchen is non-negotiable.

I just went through this, and here‚Äôs everything I learned the hard way. plus a few DIY cleaner recipes if you want to avoid harsh chemicals.

# What You‚Äôll Need Before You Start

Here‚Äôs a basic cleaning kit you should gather:

|Tools|Cleaners|
|:-|:-|
|Vacuum cleaner|All-purpose spray|
|Mop & bucket|Oven cleaner|
|Sponges & cloths|Degreaser|
|Scrub brush|Dish soap|
|Old toothbrush|Baking soda|
|Gloves (trust me)|White vinegar + lemon (for DIY mixes)|

Optional but helpful: a spray bottle, newspaper (for windows), and a little music to keep your sanity intact.

# What to Clean in the Kitchen (and How)

I used this exact checklist when I moved out last week. Worked like a charm:

1. **Cabinets & drawers** ‚Äì Empty them, wipe inside and out. Get the handles too.
2. **Pantry shelves** ‚Äì Crumbs hide here. Wipe every surface.
3. **Countertops** ‚Äì Mild dish soap for general wipe-downs. Greasy? Use degreaser, wait 10 min, then scrub.
4. **Small appliances** ‚Äì Clean your toaster tray, descale the kettle/coffee machine, wash microwave plate.
5. **Fridge** ‚Äì Remove all shelves and bins, wash in warm soapy water. Wipe inside. Don‚Äôt forget the top and back.
6. **Sink + faucet** ‚Äì Polish with a sponge and gentle cleanser.
7. **Dishwasher** ‚Äì Run it empty on a hot cycle.
8. **Stovetop** ‚Äì Degrease, remove burner covers if you have them, and scrub underneath. Don‚Äôt forget the knobs.
9. **Oven** ‚Äì Spray oven cleaner, let it sit, then wipe. Scrape off baked-on stuff with a wooden spatula.
10. **Windows** ‚Äì Use glass spray or a DIY mix (below). Avoid direct sunlight when wiping.
11. **Furniture** ‚Äì Wipe chairs, island, table legs, etc.
12. **Floors** ‚Äì Vacuum and mop, even if it doesn‚Äôt *look* dirty. Food dust settles fast.

# Easy DIY Cleaners (If You Hate Chemicals)

**All-Purpose Cleaner (great for counters & fridge):**

* 1 tbsp baking soda
* 1 tbsp lemon juice
* 1 cup warm water Mix, apply, scrub, wipe with a damp sponge.

**Oven Paste:**

* 2 tbsp baking soda
* 1 tbsp salt
* Add water slowly until it forms a paste Spread in oven, leave overnight, scrape with an old wooden spatula, rinse.

**Window Spray:**

* 2 tbsp white vinegar
* 1 quart warm water Spray and wipe with crumpled *black-and-white newspaper* (not glossy paper). Don‚Äôt clean windows when the sun‚Äôs shining directly on them, you‚Äôll get streaks.

# Pro Tips

* If something *can* be removed (shelves, trays, knobs), take it out and clean it separately.
* Don‚Äôt forget high-touch spots: light switches, handles, oven knobs, fridge door.
* Always clean top-to-bottom so dust doesn‚Äôt land on what you‚Äôve already wiped.
* Take pics when you‚Äôre done, just in case the landlord says something wasn‚Äôt cleaned.

You don‚Äôt need fancy products or pro tools. You just need a game plan and some elbow grease. This list got me my full deposit back‚Äîno complaints.",1,1748005174.0,DesiKitchenGear,0,1.0,False

I‚Äôve struggled with depression since middle school, though I‚Äôve never been officially diagnosed. I usually manage fine, but lately I‚Äôve been feeling extremely isolated‚Äîmy friends have moved away, my family is 8 hours away, and I‚Äôve become a homebody.

My new roommate moved in around July 2024, and things have generally been good. We hang out one-on-one once or twice a week, and I never pressure her to include me in her plans with friends.

But this month everything piled up. First, I had to spend a lot of money cutting down a tree before hurricane season. Then, a former friend (who I‚Äôd distanced myself from due to repeated flaking) asked to come over for dinner. He promised not to flake, so I went all out cooking‚Äîand he didn‚Äôt show. I was hurt and deleted him from my socials. My roommates knew how much effort I put in and were upset for me.

A week later, my water heater broke. I spent days talking to plumbers and electricians, and in the end had to replace it, which cost even more money. Then, the day after the new heater was installed, my pet fish of four years died. That hit me harder than I expected‚ÄîI‚Äôm very attached to animals and losing my fish was the final straw. I spent the next day crying and shut down emotionally. I didn‚Äôt want to talk to anyone, including my roommate.

She asked me if something was wrong, and I told her ‚Äúno‚Äù because I wasn‚Äôt upset with her specifically‚ÄîI just didn‚Äôt want to speak. When she asked why I was giving her the silent treatment, I explained I was in a bad place.

Since then, it‚Äôs been tense. She‚Äôs been avoiding the apartment and told our other roommate she ‚Äúdoesn‚Äôt deserve to be ignored.‚Äù I had tried to reconnect by texting her the next day to ask if she wanted a coffee‚ÄîI even brought it back for her and left it on the table‚Äîbut things are still awkward. I also apologized the same day this started, but I don‚Äôt know if she heard me since she had her AirPods in.

I know I‚Äôm being quiet, but I don‚Äôt feel like I did anything wrong. I just needed space to grieve and process things in my own home. I didn‚Äôt mean to hurt her or make it personal, and now I feel like she‚Äôs made it into a bigger problem than it was. Our other roommate says we should talk, but her reaction has made me feel like I shouldn‚Äôt have to apologize again.

It feels like we‚Äôve gathered up the broken pieces, and placed them in a pile in front of us. They‚Äôre here. We just don‚Äôt know what to do with them anymore. But they‚Äôre still here. We‚Äôve left them alone. Now what? They‚Äôre still here. 

I miss you. I miss you more than I should, more than I admit to myself. I‚Äôve grown comfortable sitting with thoughts of you; with moving through my day in constant conversations that we‚Äôll never have and will never be heard. I feel like I‚Äôm losing my mind, but if it means letting you go, I‚Äôm becoming okay with never finding it again.

We‚Äôre so intertwined that my instinct has always been you. It‚Äôs a constant battle to not think about you, or talk to you, or want you. And I‚Äôve grown tired, I‚Äôm ready to stop fighting it all and let myself be completely consumed by you. But you‚Äôre not here. 

You haven‚Äôt been here in a long time, yet it all remains. So I sit with it all. I make a coffee, light a cigarette and just stare at it until it blurs into nothing but a stillness that‚Äôs just here. 

It‚Äôs always just here. 

But just over there.

I recently tried using an online service to find my lost phone, and it turned into a total nightmare. Here‚Äôs my story about dealing with service and why I‚Äôd steer clear.

Last week, I was freaking out after misplacing my phone somewhere between my car and the grocery store. I Googled ‚Äútrack lost phone‚Äù and landed on this site that promised geolocation for a dirt-cheap ‚Ç¨0.90 one-day trial. The page looked decent enough‚Äîfancy graphics, bold claims about finding your device in minutes. I thought, ‚ÄúLess than a coffee? Sure, why not?‚Äù Yeah, rookie move.

I signed up, punched in my card info, and paid the ‚Ç¨0.90. Then I entered my phone number, hit submit, and‚Ä¶ crickets. Just a spinning ‚Äúprocessing‚Äù wheel that went nowhere. I tried again with my roommate‚Äôs number to see if it was a fluke‚Äîsame deal, no results. I fired off an email to their support, but it was like shouting into the void. No reply, nada.

The real gut-punch came the next morning when I checked my bank app and saw a ‚Ç¨49.90 charge labeled ‚ÄúMOBEGEO.‚Äù I was like, ‚ÄúWhat the heck is this?‚Äù I dug through the site‚Äôs fine print (which, let‚Äôs be honest, I should‚Äôve read first) and found a sneaky clause saying the trial flips to a monthly subscription unless you cancel. Nowhere during signup did they make that obvious. I scrambled to cancel my account, which took way too many clicks to figure out, but the ‚Ç¨49.90 was already gone.

I called my bank to fight the charge, but they said it‚Äôs tough to dispute since I ‚Äúagreed‚Äù to the initial ‚Ç¨0.90. To be safe, I had to cancel my card, which meant updating all my auto-payments‚Äîwhat a pain. I shot another email to the service‚Äôs support, begging for a refund, and got a robotic reply: ‚ÄúNo refunds post-trial per our policy.‚Äù No empathy, no explanation, just a big middle finger.

I started Googling and found a bunch of people on review sites saying the same thing: no phone tracking, surprise charges, and radio silence from support. It‚Äôs a classic bait-and-switch, and I fell for it hook, line, and sinker. I‚Äôm out fifty bucks and still phoneless, but I‚Äôm sharing this to keep you all from making the same dumb mistake.

How to Avoid This Trap:

1. Skim the terms before you sign up for any ‚Äúcheap‚Äù trial, no matter how legit it looks.
2. Use a virtual card or something like PayPal to keep your real card safe.
3. Scope out reviews on trusted sites before handing over your info.
4. If you get hit with weird charges, call your bank right away and don‚Äôt wait.

Anyone else run into this kind of thing? How‚Äôd you deal with it? I‚Äôm still trying to get my money back, but I‚Äôm not holding my breath. If you‚Äôve had a similar experience, maybe consider reporting it to consumer protection folks‚Äîjust make sure you‚Äôve got screenshots or proof.

¬†A basic Wiki is now¬†[here](https://slimwiki.com/ragnaroknrol-limited/getting-started/welcome).

**December 25, Family Xmas**

The fake fireplace/space heater is roaring and warm with its fake flames sparkling.

I am on the recliner in front of Ricardo.¬† Jackie and her parents are on the futon. Cindy is currently grabbing some hot chocolate before sitting with Jackie.

The TV is on and ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs a Wonderful Life‚Äù is playing.

With this group, this, of course, turns into a hilarious dissection of a classic movie.

‚ÄúSo, who‚Äôs the real villain here? Potter or Billy?‚Äù¬† Cindy starts off the hilarity.

I throw a curveball at the room. ‚ÄúHarry.‚Äù

They look at me.¬† Guess I have to defend this position.¬† ‚ÄúWhat?¬† Dude costs George some of his hearing, his college money and then backs out of a promise to take over the bank because‚Ä¶?‚Äù

‚ÄúHe‚Äôs a selfish prick and his hot wife gets him a better job.‚Äù¬† Jackie gets me. I wink at her.

Ricardo pipes up.¬† ‚ÄúBilly is the bigger villain tho. I mean, after how many fuck ups do you ask to change to something more your speed and stop destroying your brother‚Äôs family?!‚Äù¬† We all nod.

Tonya surprises us all. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs Clarence.¬† He‚Äôs a second-rate angel sent to help a man about to commit suicide because the town‚Äôs worst monster stole $8000 from the moron Billy and he doesn‚Äôt help George by telling him that. He shows him what things would be like without him, and yea, that‚Äôs nice for an ego boost, but it didn‚Äôt solve the problem. There is someone that did an objectively evil thing which he lets happen because‚Ä¶?‚Äù

Bob laughs. ‚ÄúOf course you would say that.‚Äù

‚ÄúAngels are the worst. They sit there comforting you instead of helping stop the thing.¬† Useless assholes.‚Äù

I feel there is a story here. ‚ÄúOkay, talk.¬† There is no way this is not a personal history comment.‚Äù

She looks so sad. ‚ÄúI lost Jackie‚Äôs granddad when I was young.¬† We were in a car accident.¬† I was so young. Outside the car. My dad was inside it, it was burning. Then I saw an angel in white and she was crying.¬† She held me.¬† She stroked my hair and whispered that she was sorry. I asked her to do something. She said she couldn‚Äôt.‚Äù

Jackie and I look at one another.

And now we get hit with a gut punch. Cindy speaks up. ‚ÄúYou sure it was an angel and not something else?‚Äù¬† Cindy is looking at Tonya with sad eyes.

‚ÄúWhat else could she have been?‚Äù

‚ÄúMaybe a banshee. One that knew he was very loved and had people that would be very sad. One that came to share your sorrow and let you know you weren‚Äôt alone.¬† There was a gal at the shop like that for me.¬† She took me outside and she cried with me while we watched Pat panic more and more trying to save Jackie and the doctor get a look of defeat as the EMTs arrived.¬† When Pat left we walked up and the doctor just looked at the ground and said, ‚Äòso much blood, too much, I think.‚Äô¬† And then that same woman grabbed Connie, her hands covered in Jackie‚Äôs blood, and just held her while we all cried.¬† I like to think she helped us.‚Äù¬† Cindy is openly crying. The girl she loves holds her and cries with her.

Tonya looks like she is contemplating this.¬† I realize something. I owe that someone.¬† I am going to fix that.¬† I pull out my phone and text Fiadh. I never thanked her for what she did for Cindy and Connie.¬† We have been working on wedding stuff for May and have each other‚Äôs contact info so‚Ä¶. ‚ÄúHey, sweetie, what are you doing?‚Äù

Her response takes less than a minute.¬† ‚ÄúWatching It‚Äôs a Wonderful life on TV.‚Äù

I laugh and respond. ‚ÄúUs too, where in town do you live?‚Äù¬† She sends me her address. She lives in the other single that was open when we switched to a double.¬† She‚Äôs a floor above us.¬† I almost drop my phone.‚Äù

‚ÄúWe live in 406‚Ä¶‚Äù

I show Ricardo. He shakes his head in disbelief.

Her response pops up, ‚ÄúNO!‚Äù ¬†She is just as shocked as us.

I move in for the request.¬† It is easy now.¬† ‚ÄúYes, get that beautiful butt down here.¬† Family Xmas!‚Äù

‚ÄúI am not family.‚Äù

‚ÄúCindy is here. She was just talking about you and how amazing you are. If you ask her and I, you qualify now.¬† Get down here.¬† I have a present for you anyway!‚Äù

‚ÄúGive me a minute.¬† Side note, Potter would have no one cry for him.‚Äù

I laugh.¬† Everyone is staring at me. ‚ÄúSo, Fiadh, who lives in 516 says Potter would die with no one grieving him.¬† I think she‚Äôs going with him as the villain.‚Äù

‚ÄúNO FUCKING WAY!!‚Äù¬† Cindy and Jackie are completely in synch.

‚ÄúGuess who is coming to get her present!‚Äù

They both smile.¬† Bob and Tonya are both confused. ‚ÄúWho is she?‚Äù

Cindy pipes up. ‚ÄúThe woman I just spoke about that held me.‚Äù

The door knocks. I am already on the way to answer it.

Fiadh has like 6 wrapped presents in her arms and winks at me. Guess we weren‚Äôt the only ones with presents for the other. She has a grey and white hoodie with green Xmas themed pj pants. Looks so comfy.

She kicks off her slippers walks in and drops her presents as Tonya gasps and they stare at one another in recognition. I hear a whispered ‚Äúthe angel‚Äù behind me.

¬†

**A short time later**

This is a mess. Ricardo and Cindy have been at the shop enough that both know what the deal is. Both know better than to tell others and so it is just a quiet thing we have.

Tonya is currently being held by Fiadh and being rocked and hummed to quietly while she cries. Bob is not sure what is going on but is, wisely, holding back and waiting.

After a few minutes, Tonya looks up at Fiadh.¬† ‚ÄúAre you really an angel?¬† Aside from your clothing, you haven‚Äôt changed a single bit.‚Äù¬† Bob suddenly understands and gasps.

Fiadh starts signing. I interpret.¬† ‚ÄúI remember you sweet child. I always wish I didn‚Äôt have to be what I am. My cries hurt people. My voice is only a wail to mourn their death, or a whisper to comfort their loved ones.¬† I hope I gave you that comfort.‚Äù

Tonya nods. ‚ÄúVery much so, though I was too bitter to see it.‚Äù

Fiadh pulls her in and holds her some more.

‚ÄúOkay mom, so Pat owns a coffee shop that has some unusual guests. We call them our irregulars. And they aren‚Äôt human, like Fiadh, the Banshee, here‚Ä¶‚Äù

Bob looks at her. ‚ÄúSo, that woman that came here and laid down with you was one, right?‚Äù

Jackie nods.

‚ÄúYea, she was way too perfect. And the doctor at the follow up yesterday said your body healed so fast it was almost miraculous.¬† She did that, didn‚Äôt she?‚Äù He is nodding to himself and in thought.

Jackie nods again.¬† ‚ÄúUm, yea, that was Titania.‚Äù

Tonya looks up. ‚ÄúWhy is that name familiar?‚Äù

‚ÄúShe‚Äôs the Queen of the Fairies in Midsummer Night‚Äôs Dream.‚Äù

Both Bob and Tonya suddenly look concerned. Bob speaks up first. ‚ÄúSo‚Ä¶ how much of the stories and folk tales about fairies are true?‚Äù

I decide to field this one. ‚ÄúToo many. Gift exchanges, hospitality, favors, and more are things we have to deal with. Once you get to a certain point you can feel out how much you have to worry about with each individual.‚Äù

I walk over and squeeze Fiadh‚Äôs shoulder. ‚ÄúIf you are friends, you can drop a lot of the little and some of the big things because friends exchange favors all the time and never keep track. Hospitality is also a lot different.‚Äù¬† I kiss Fiadh on the cheek. ‚ÄúI just found out what you did for Cindy and Connie, after we left, thank you.‚Äù

Fiadh signs a quick ‚Äúwelcome‚Äù she hesitates before finishing with ‚Äúmy friend.‚Äù¬† I am touched by the response.¬† I squeeze her shoulder again and go sit with Ricardo.

‚ÄúWe have done a lot of things to make things as comfortable for our irregulars as we can and our staff safe. ‚Äú

¬†Jackie scoffs at me. ‚ÄúYOU have. You have been keeping us safe since before my first day.‚Äù

‚ÄúAnd in return I have a bigger family than I could ever dream of 3 years ago.‚Äù¬† I gesture to the room.

From the corner of the room, ‚ÄúMerry Christmas, movie house! Merry Christmas, Emporium! Merry Christmas, you wonderful old Building and Loan!‚Äù

Smart ass TV‚Ä¶

¬†

**December 26**

Tonya is helping make breakfast.¬† Bob is washing dishes for us. They are leaving tomorrow so I want them to have something good and also home made.

‚ÄúPat, could you explain your terms for me when it comes to all this?‚Äù¬† She has taken all of this pretty well. Considering her daughter almost died saving a dryad‚Äôs life and she met a banshee that had comforted her when she was a child, I am very impressed with her. *Hell of a mom.*

‚ÄúOkay, so we refer to guests in several ways. You have the regulars. They are humans that don‚Äôt know what is up. They aren‚Äôt aware of the Fae as more than tales. Typical New Yorkers that are stupid resilient.¬† Up until about fairly recently, Cindy and Ricardo were regulars.‚Äù¬† The debates Jackie and I had about them knowing were pretty long, and rendered moot when they went to the shop‚Ä¶

I smile, that was a hell of a way to find out. Todd and his smelling like sex comment and Nate is the worst at behaving when he needs his caffeine.¬†

‚ÄúWe then have the enlightened.¬† These are mortals that know about the Fae, interact with them, and try their best to not be crushed underfoot by things that these creatures can and do happen to do.¬† All my staff are enlightened after the first day.‚Äù

She nods. She is keeping up and probably figured out things from context.¬† ‚ÄúThere are the irregulars.¬† The Fae, Faire folk, First Worlders, and other terms for our friends like Fiadh, Pat, Todd, May, and Connie. It is a bunch of terms for creatures that may be mortal but are magical. Some are probably as close as you can get to immortality. Some are stupidly dangerous as well. Titania and Oberon are those last two.‚Äù

‚ÄúIf they are so dangerous, why allow them in your life or shop?‚Äù

Funny thing, my first interaction with one was a perfectly dressed woman that wanted just the espresso shots. A quad. Nothing else. She then asked if she could get FOUR MORE QUADS.‚Äù

Tonya looks lost. I laugh.¬† ‚ÄúYou know that cappuccino you like?¬† It is a grande with 2 shots of espresso. The espresso is a way of making coffee more intense, it isn‚Äôt usually stronger in actual caffeine content than a cup of coffee.¬† But it is usually like 3.5 ounces for nearly the same amount of caffeine.¬† So, imagine 20 cups of coffee condensed into a single cup.¬† Because she wanted just the espresso and 20 shots of it.‚Äù

‚ÄúDear god!‚Äù¬† She now gets it.

‚ÄúOh, and then she added energy drink shots to it.¬† I knew she was something else at that point. She paid in gold coins too.‚Äù¬† Tonya laughs.

‚ÄúThat was Mab, the Queen of Air and Darkness and the head of the Winter Court. In the stories they are all the unseelie. Which are the Fae that are closest to monsters and most likely to harm humans.‚Äù

Tonya looks at me as if reappraising me. ‚ÄúAnd she was your first, irregular?‚Äù

‚ÄúAnd became a steady visitor. Then she invited another. After that it was like a flood gate. They showed up and ordered weird drinks or normal ones depending on them. They all got the same service. Hell, she and Titania are my business partners now.¬† I was careful. Rule number one is to never give them your full name. Rule 2 is not to ask for theirs. It keeps all of us safe as they know they can relax and not worry about someone using that info to hurt them.‚Äù

She looks at me. ‚ÄúI believe rule three is not to have sex with them?‚Äù I laugh.¬† She remembers Titania‚Äôs visit.

‚ÄúClose. No dating them. I suppose a one-night stand might be okay, but I don‚Äôt think in those terms much. Ricardo was supposed to be one. Also, if they are as amazing as I think, no one would volunteer for just one night.¬† Oh, we are getting off track.‚Äù

I shake some random thoughts of Obie for a single night away and get back to explaining the different types. ‚ÄúBack to it, the irregulars have different types. As do the enlightened. Some enlightened have magic. Not much, but enough. And irregulars come in a couple extra varieties. We had a vampire start coming to the shop a few months ago.‚Äù

‚ÄúOkay, now you have to tell me about this‚Ä¶‚Äù. She is smiling and I see so much of her in her daughter it is almost too cute for me.

‚ÄúSo, an edgelord that wants to be a goth, walks in and the chime goes off and it mocks him.‚Äù

‚ÄúThe chime?¬† A door chime?‚Äù

Oh yea. That is a thing.

‚ÄúHahaha. Yes, at some point, I think when I bought the franchise, I was given a door chime.¬† Well, the business was. No name attached, just instructions on hooking it to the door and a comment saying I would never want to get rid of it once installed. I installed it.‚Äù

‚ÄúAnd?‚Äù

‚ÄúI don‚Äôt want to get rid of it. The thing is almost sentient. If an irregular walks in, it chimes differently than if a regular or an enlightened does.¬† Hell, it chimes differently based on what kind of Fae they are as well, sometimes. Why and when it changes is a complete mystery to me. Anyway, the damn thing started playing the opening song from What We Do in Shadows‚Ä¶‚Äù

I am so glad Tonya wasn‚Äôt chopping anything. She almost starts coughing after laughing so hard.

‚ÄúSo, the vampire hears it, is super pissed and walks up demanding to know who did that.¬† Lemar is the manager that day and just deadpans ‚ÄòIt was a present from Tuck.‚Äô And then waits.‚Äù

Jackie yells from the couch.¬† ‚ÄúMOM, Tuck is real, he‚Äôs also the guy that convinced vampires they sparkle in the sun and then set it up so they could find out they don‚Äôt. Like hundreds of them all at once.‚Äù

She gawks. I nod. ‚ÄúYea, so using that name was sort of a provocation and Lemar should know better after a redcap almost killed Jim, but he‚Äôs being cocky because there are no less than two of his soon to be Groomsman in the lobby, and one of them is a troll.

She gawks at me.¬† ‚ÄúLike lives under a bridge?‚Äù

I laugh. ‚ÄúHe used to. Also, he is mostly an internet troll. I still can‚Äôt believe that review he left mentioning my ‚Äònear perfect‚Äô ass is the top review for our shop‚Ä¶‚Äù¬† My air quotes on the word ‚Äúnear‚Äù drive home my annoyance.

From the couch.¬† ‚ÄúLies, your ass is perfect.‚Äù¬† Once again Cindy and Jackie are talking in synch, and I am not sure if I should kiss them both or smack them.¬† Bob settles on snickering while nodding his head‚Ä¶. Wait. BOB!!!

‚ÄúAnyway, while he is a lanky son of a bitch, I have no doubt Todd could rip a vampire in half if it meant protecting Lemar.‚Äù

‚ÄúThe vampire leans forward and starts to bare his fangs. Now fun part, Lemar had a rock thrown at supersonic speed clip his ear. He has zero shits to give about sharp teeth, Todd has a mouth full of them. Lemar looks at the vampire and asks if he wants a drink or some food.¬† The vampire just stops.‚Äù

I imitate a male voice with a bad European accent ‚Äúdo you think I could have a Midnight Drink?‚Äù

Bob is snorting from the living room. Ricardo pipes up ‚Äúhold up, you guys had an actual Vampire and he wanted a fruity drink?¬† Don‚Äôt they just live on blood?!??‚Äù

I nod. ‚ÄúYea, Lemar saw him spike his drink with a vial. I think it was probably blood.¬† And the guy keeps coming back and has started talking to some of the irregulars. Most are okay with him. Connie makes him nervous.‚Äù¬† I giggle.

‚ÄúShe‚Äôs a dryad and her normal form is literally made of things that stab him through the heart to kill him.¬† She‚Äôs like 25% sharp pine needles.¬† The rest of her is supple vines and sharp looking wooden branches.‚Äù¬† Ricardo says this.

I wonder. ‚ÄúShe showed you her form without the glamour?‚Äù¬† Also, supple?¬† Dude.

He nods. ‚ÄúA couple of weeks ago I asked what she looked like for real, and she got all shy and said since I was your boyfriend it would be okay and showed me.¬† I was curious.‚Äù

All the women and even Bob get dead quiet. Cindy breaks the silence ‚ÄúDude!‚Äù

He looks confused.

‚ÄúThat is to a Fae like asking me to strip and show you the goods.‚Äù¬† Cindy sums it up.¬† I don‚Äôt really have the heart to point out to her that she has been walking around this apartment while he is here in stuff that may as well make her naked. He has to know about every birthmark, mole, and dimple by now. I sure as hell do.¬† He has totally seen the goods.

He sees Fiadh violently nodding in agreement and he looks mortified. Such a good guy. When he gets it, he gets it!¬† ‚ÄúI am so going to apologize to her, crap, do they sell ‚ÄòSorry I made an indecent proposal, and you took it‚Äô cards?‚Äù

I laugh.¬† ‚ÄúJust buy her some Tea when you apologize to her. She will be okay with it.‚Äù

Tonya looks at me.¬† ‚ÄúExactly why would a dryad be willing to strip for you or your boyfriend?‚Äù

I get a little flushed. ‚ÄúWell, I technically own her tree, and some workers thought the tree had a fungus and were going to cut it down, so I got an arborist to check it and sign off on it not being sick.‚Äù

Tonya looks at me weird. I don‚Äôt know how to categorize this. ‚ÄúHow many lives have you saved; I wonder?¬† And how many did you do so without a second thought?‚Äù

I don‚Äôt really have any way of answering this, so I just stay quiet. Breakfast is ready so we all are quiet while we eat.

**December 26**

¬†

Bob and Tonya are at the coffee shop. Since they leave tomorrow and hear so much about it, they want to see the place. I tell them to walk in first.

I want them to hear the chimes firsthand.

¬†

The chime goes off. It is signaling enlightened. I figured.¬† I walk in and my specific chime, the Bitch is Back, goes off. Several people look up and wave. I wave back. Jackie walks in and ‚Ä¶ MY CHIME GOES OFF?!?!‚Ä¶ Oooookay.¬† She looks at it too. It had always been enlightened until now.

A lot of confused looks and then several of them get wide eyed and start‚Ä¶ cheering?¬† *Dafuq?*

May runs up and I catch a glimpse of ‚Äúwhen did she‚Äù but I can‚Äôt catch the rest. I am being pulled in by Lemar. ‚ÄúBoss, we have a list, can you get this stuff today?‚Äù¬† I nod. Looking it over, it is all stuff I should have done this week. I feel bad. Well. A little. Jackie‚Äôs family and her well-being is my priority.¬† I start apologizing to Lemar.

May walks up looking glum and signs to Lemar.¬† ‚ÄúNope.‚Äù

He signs back ‚ÄúLet it be.‚Äù

I sign to both ‚Äúwant to explain?‚Äù

‚ÄúNo.‚Äù¬† They sign it and I know I will not get anywhere so I give it up.¬† I have a feeling. I need to derail this line of thinking. Stop it Pat.

‚ÄúLemar, this is Tonya and Bob, they are Jacqueline‚Äôs parents. Whatever they want, on me.¬† I‚Äôll get to work on this now.‚Äù¬† I pull out my phone and start my order.

Mab, who had been in a booth, walks up. She smiles at me and Jackie. ‚ÄúSo, these are the firestorm‚Äôs parents. I can see where she gets her fire and her mettle.‚Äù¬† She looks at Tonya and then Bob as she says fire and mettle. Hmmmm.

‚ÄúI am please to meet you both.‚Äù¬† She smiles and it is actually warm and genuine.

‚ÄúThis is Maybelle, the first client that I told you about earlier‚Ä¶‚Äù They both catch the hint.

Tonya looks at the offered hand and shakes it after a slight delay. She smiles. ‚ÄúI have heard only good things about you.‚Äù

Mab laughs.¬† ‚ÄúThat is a lie. Though I have no doubt that these two were not the ones saying the bad things.‚Äù

Bob acts like he is about to shake her hand and then lifts it up to kiss it. She smiles so affectionately that I am convinced he just won her heart.

‚ÄúCareful with this one, Tonya. He is liable to sweep me off my feet.¬† I would probably land in bed with the both of you.‚Äù¬† She winks at Tonya.¬† Tonya turns fifteen shades of red. Hahahahaha. Like mom, like daughter. *I* *wonder if Mab just started an awakening‚Ä¶*

Jackie clears her throat.¬† ‚ÄúMaybelle,‚Äù Her voice lingers on the fake name, ‚ÄúIf you are done hitting on my parents, might we have a word?‚Äù¬† She pulls Mab over to a booth. I cannot help myself.¬† I have to hear this.

Mab starts as soon as they sit down. ‚ÄúYou are aware that Patricia can hear us if she so chooses, correct.‚Äù

‚ÄúYes, but this concerns her. No secrets here, babe.¬† First, can you tell me what the fuck Pat is?‚Äù

Mab genuinely laughs at that.¬† She seems to think about it a moment.¬† ‚ÄúShe is a lot of things.¬† Kind, fierce, loving, distant, a creature of paradoxes.¬† She is what some would call a warlock.¬† She is what we would call an ArchFae.¬† She is a mortal.‚Äù¬† She stops and turns to look at me directly.¬† ‚ÄúAnd she is most importantly to me, one I call a friend.‚Äù

I think I choke up a bit here.¬† I whisper so only they can hear me.¬† ‚ÄúI love you too, my friend.‚Äù¬†

Jackie jumps and looks at me. I wink.

‚ÄúFuck, that is scary.¬† And fucking cool.‚Äù She is getting red.¬† Mab just smiles at me.¬† That smile of hers makes all the rough nights and long hours working here worth it.

Jackie grabs her hand.¬† ‚ÄúThank you.¬† Now‚Ä¶ about the chime‚Ä¶‚Äù

Mab nods.¬† ‚ÄúI caught it too. You are hers. Interesting.¬† I believe it is because she drove off death. I am actually surprised that the dryad, Connie, doesn‚Äôt have the bell performing the same for her.¬† There must be another element.‚Äù

Jackie is as confused as I am. ‚ÄúHold up, do you not know how the chime works?‚Äù

‚ÄúDear, only the person that created would know. And it has been sitting in a box in court with a tag that had a specific date and the words ‚Äòyou will know for whom‚Äô on it. It has been waiting hundreds of years.‚Äù

‚ÄúWhat?‚Äù Jackie seems confused. I am pretending to look at the list and my phone.

‚ÄúYes, the date was the exact day Pat bought the franchise. I had nothing to do with the timing. I had simply applied some pressure on her former employer, and he made the decision on his own and without notice. I had anticipated a few more weeks before he would fold.¬† We were trying to avoid anything important with her happening on that date.¬† It was a big surprise. Imagine what happened when Nixie reported Pat owned the shop as we are debating what to do with the box,‚Äù she turns and faces me.

‚ÄúI am very sorry the gift we gave you was essentially a regift, Pat.‚Äù

I laugh. My whisper reaches their ears again. ‚ÄúI am not offended in the least, good Queen.‚Äù

‚ÄúIn any case. Everyone made the connection. We opened it and someone brought it over that night.¬† The first time I walked in I was shocked and pleasantly surprised.¬† It made things so much easier for everyone.‚Äù Mab has a look I can‚Äôt place. She is looking at Tonya.

Jackie nods. ‚ÄúYea. And do we know the maker?‚Äù

‚ÄúThere are conflicting stories. I cannot say. I do know this, it was meant for this place.‚Äù¬† Mab smiles. ‚ÄúNow then, there is something I MUST speak to your mother about as her presence has made things much more clear.¬† And our little talk has me guessing something.‚Äù

She walks up to Tonya and smiles. ‚ÄúYou are a Macleod.‚Äù¬† This was not a question‚Ä¶

Tonya looks taken aback. ‚ÄúMy mother was.¬† She came from Scotland with my father who had studied there.‚Äù

‚ÄúThat explains much. No wonder at all now. You always had some Fae blood in you, Jackie.‚Äù

Tonya looks puzzled. ‚ÄúThat tale of the chief and the fairy princess hand fasting for a year and a day my mother told me was true?‚Äù

Mab laughs. She pulls out her phone and selects a contact.¬† She puts it on speaker. It rings and Nestra answers. ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt often get calls from you, Queen of Air, what do you wish to discuss.‚Äù

‚ÄúVerenestra, Queen of Beauty and the Handfasting Princess, you are on speaker and I have a Macleod with me.‚Äù

You can hear Nestra change positions.¬† She sounds like she jumps up as she begins to talk.¬† ‚ÄúWho? Lineage 2 generations, tell me.‚Äù

Tonya is put on the spot but rises to the challenge. ‚ÄúTonya, daughter of Moira Macleod and Quinn Greer, Moira was the Daughter of Quinn Macleod and Lorna Macleod.¬† They were like third cousins.‚Äù

‚ÄúLorna is one of my Sterling‚Äôs line.¬† Tonya is definitely one of mine and so are any of her children.‚Äù

‚ÄúGROSS!!!‚Äù Jackie is mortified.

‚ÄúIs that Jackie?¬† Oh, no. Are you Tonya‚Äôs child?¬† How lovely to be one of my descendants, darling!¬† Oh, mother will be so pleased!!‚Äù

Jackie looks like she may turn a few more shades of green soon. ‚ÄúOh come on, I‚Äôve had more than one shower fantasy featuring Nestra‚Ä¶‚Äù

I smile as I am so going to enjoy this.¬† I look at her and say, ‚ÄúYou realize Titania is Nestra‚Äôs mom, right?‚Äù¬† The look on Jackie‚Äôs face tells me she had not.¬† And I got her.

I should not giggle. I should not laugh.¬† I should laugh less‚Ä¶

*Traitor*.¬† Jackie is definitely the source of that.

‚ÄúI heard that.‚Äù

‚ÄúI know.‚Äù¬† She glares at me.¬† I wink back at her.¬† Her adorable face makes me smile.

¬†

**December 27**

The airport is crazy busy. I am here to help out since Jackie isn‚Äôt supposed to lift anything heavy and if I don‚Äôt stop her, she will. We are at the point where we have to say our goodbyes. Jackie has the best parents. She is given hugs and kisses while I make sure the bags are safe.

Bob comes over to me. ‚ÄúThere is no way I can ever repay you. Simply not possible. I will instead say this. If you ever need me, call. I know you lost your dad. I can‚Äôt replace him. Just know, I have two daughters now. And I will always treat you as one.‚Äù¬† He almost makes it without tearing up. I lost it around the word call. I can‚Äôt stop the tears anymore.

Tonya comes over. She grabs my head and pulls me down, so our foreheads are touching. She is already crying. ‚ÄúYou make my baby happy. I hope she helps you figure out how to be as happy as she is. Thank you for not letting us see her in a casket. Thank you for looking out for my oddgirl. Thank you for loving her. And thank you, Patricia, for being someone I will be proud to call a daughter.‚Äù

Yea. I am ugly crying. Don‚Äôt care.

Why is it that customers say ‚ÄúI‚Äôll *just* have‚Ä¶‚Äù before ordering a complicated drink, but customers who order plain black coffee or tea don‚Äôt? 

Like customer A will say ‚ÄúMay I please have a small dark roast with room for cream?‚Äù Or ‚ÄúI‚Äôll take a nitro cold brew‚Äù, no qualifiers, just their order. 

Then customer B says ‚ÄúI‚Äôll *just* have a large skim iced honey-lavender latte with light ice and a half-shot of lavender but a double-shot of honey.‚Äù  

At first glance it could be read as ‚Äúok well by ‚Äòjust‚Äô they mean ‚Äòonly‚Äô, as in they‚Äôre not ordering anything else‚Äù right? But nope, it happens with orders for multiple drinks too. 

‚ÄúI‚Äôll just have a small iced matcha with almond milk and vanilla‚Äù *rings it in* ‚Äúok, that‚Äôll be $5‚Äù ‚Äúoh um actually I‚Äôll also have just an iced vanilla-lavender latte with whipped cream‚Äù *adds it* ‚Äúok, anything else?‚Äù ‚ÄúYeah, I‚Äôll just have a half-caf salted caramel‚Ä¶‚Äù

Again, it‚Äôs such a small thing, but it‚Äôs started to grind my gears a little, ngl. I‚Äôm actually a roaster now, but I‚Äôve been taking on a few extra caf√© shifts because we had a few seasonal employees leave and are still in the hiring process, so I‚Äôm being reminded regularly why I don‚Äôt do cafe shifts much anymore lol.

1ktinyr,https://www.reddit.com/r/AmIOverreacting/comments/1ktinyr/aio_for_getting_mad_about_coffee/,AIO for getting mad about coffee,"My wife (30F) and I (34M) have been together for over 12 years. We have a beautiful 6 month old daughter. When my wife got pregnant she did an incredible job immediately cutting alcohol and caffeine out of her diet- opting to drink decaf. In solidarity I also was not drinking alcohol or caffeine. She was great about taking her prenatal vitamins. We are definitely lower- middle class so we weren‚Äôt buying organic veggies or anything too expensive but the two of us tried to be healthy. After giving birth to our daughter my wife told me she wanted to try to make it at least a year for breastfeeding. I told her that I supported her decision but it was also okay if she stopped before that (we do have backup formula in our pantry just incase). We have kept up with the trend of not drinking alcohol or caffeine obviously because we do not want it to pass along to our daughter through the breast milk. (Neither of us are scientists- we are just trying to do the best we can with what knowledge is out there). Our schedules are very similar so at least 2-3 times a week we try to go on walks with the stroller for about an hour after work trying to be healthier. My wife doesn‚Äôt cook, and so I make most of the meals for dinner, which has been difficult navigating working long days, coming home and managing the new schedule of getting up at 5AM, getting the baby ready, getting ready for work, dropping the baby off, working 10 hours, then coming home and doing the bottles, portioning the milk that was pumped, washing the dishes, cooking dinner, doing laundry, and getting the baby and ourselves to bed at a normal time. I also try and pack my wife‚Äôs lunch at night because we are both rushing around in the morning. Usually she‚Äôll bring something like: a salad, a soup, an applesauce, a banana, a granola bar, some cheese etc. Breastfeeding sucks the life out of you so I try to make sure she‚Äôs eating enough food. One of the things I always ask her when she gets home was ‚Äúhow was lunch?‚Äù Or ‚Äúwhat did you eat today?‚Äù Because her job is fast paced and sometimes she will come home and tell me that she ‚Äúdidn‚Äôt have time to eat today‚Äù. Which makes me mad at her boss for not making sure she gets a lunch break when she works full time (we both do).
Recently, my wife‚Äôs phone case broke and she put an old one on that had been in her drawer. Now, we both have clear phone cases and very similar looking phones. We have been picking up each others phones by mistake. But that isn‚Äôt a big deal because there is a lot of trust in our relationship and neither of us has ever lied to the other one. 
Yesterday, while my wife was in the shower, I was finishing a load of laundry and brought it into the bedroom. I put my phone down next to hers on the bed- and when I picked it up I realized it was her phone when unlocked it. It was open to her text screen. She had an unread message from a coworker. I did not violate her privacy and open this message but I saw that the message below it was from Zelle or DoorDash. I did click this and saw that there was an entire thread going back weeks of payment confirmations. I only glanced at it so I don‚Äôt even remember if it was texts from the bank confirming the payments, or texts from DoorDash confirming the orders. I also didn‚Äôt think to take a picture of it, because it happened so fast. My wife was still in the shower but I yelled into the bathroom ‚Äúhow was lunch yesterday?‚Äù And she said ‚Äúfine, I already told you I ate a salad.‚Äù Then I said ‚Äúwhat about today?‚Äù She said ‚Äúfine. My work catered Tzatziki‚Äôs.‚Äù I said ‚ÄúCool, so you haven‚Äôt ordered anything from DoorDash this week?‚Äù She said no so I asked her why she had payment confirmations on her phone. She said she ‚Äúforgot‚Äù that her and her coworker have been ordering coffee. I was immediately mad. I saw red and started yelling. She said she didn‚Äôt tell me because she thought I‚Äôd be mad. I said ‚Äúso instead you chose to lie to me?‚Äù She said she wasn‚Äôt proud of it but yes. I asked how long she‚Äôs been lying and she said she orders DoorDash at least twice a week- and she has been back at work for about 3 months now. I was fuming. I said ‚ÄúSo you‚Äôve been lying to my face for 3 months.‚Äù She said it‚Äôs not a big deal and treated it like I was overreacting. I said ‚Äúso it‚Äôs okay to lie if you think I‚Äôll be mad about something?‚Äù And she said ‚Äúit was just easier not to tell you.‚Äù I told her that I wasn‚Äôt happy about it because we had coffee here and decaf that we bought if she was just going to do that and she said she knows and she feels guilty for spending money (because again, we do not have a lot of it).
I told her the worst part for me is that she lied to my face for 3 months when I thought that we had open communication. Idk if it‚Äôs dumb, but I feel shaken because if she felt it necessary to lie about something like coffee, what else has she lied about?
I pointed this out to her and she said she hasn‚Äôt lied about anything else. But I don‚Äôt trust her. I‚Äôm also mad because our daughter has been fussy and not taking naps, and being overtired. Which I know could be an unrelated thing and just part of growing, but all of my brain now blames the coffee. Am I the asshole and blowing this out of proportion? I‚Äôm just mad that she doesn‚Äôt seem to see my perspective.

It was such a small amount but still the PC shutdown then tried restarting itself and shutdown again. I shut it  all off and disconnected the front pannel, cleaned it as much as I could, but same  problem was happening, so I decided to unplug every front panel from the motherboard except for the power button.   
Now, the PC will work for a couple hours at times as long as I'm not gaming, but sometimes it will still  turn  off even while not doing any heavy tasks, quite rare though, usually after about 30 minutes or so it will shutdown while gaming.  
My first guess would be PSU since I'm not getting any BSOD it simply just shuts down, and I will test the PSU tommorow with a new one, my question is does anyone have any other ideas what could be happening, Im hoping its not the motherboard...  
I just wanna mention that it is NOT overheating, its not dusty or anything that google will throw at you.

**Roadmap**

**Terlingua ‚Äì January 15**

The sun was just waking up.  
And you thought I was sleeping.  
Wrapped tight in your blanket  
you clung to your coffee like hope.  
I watched you play with birds.

You crept behind cover like you wouldn‚Äôt be seen.  
They kept you a bush away,  
close enough to keep you chasing.  
So you did.

In that moment I saw you for you.  
Before I knew your depths.  
That morning I knew I would love you.

**Salt Flat ‚Äì February 23**

We drove all day,  
but it felt like an instant.  
We talked about everything‚Äînothing.  
Subtle glances,  
grazing touches.  
Our comfort told us we were onto something.  
Neither of us had to say it.

When we got to our camp the sky was on fire.  
We knew it was performing.  
Mirroring what it saw in us  
like we put it there ourselves.  
We hadn‚Äôt said it yet,  
but our eyes knew the words.

**Santa Rosa Beach ‚Äì May 4**

Handshakes and smiles.  
Talking about my job.  
Four generations together.  
My first time meeting most of them.  
My time to shine.

But really,  
seeing your role, your peace, your glow.  
Daughter, sister, mother, rock.  
Watching your smile fill the room.  
Your warmth filled my heart.

The three of us shared a room that night.  
We made love while >!NAME\*!< slept.  
Quiet, but on fire.  
I held you so tight.  
You always fit like you were made for me.  
You surrendered.

It made us stronger.

**Gila Hot Springs ‚Äì May 26**

Who gets this far away just to run and look at stars with someone they love?

What do we see here that we don‚Äôt see at home?

I see you.  
At peace. Decompressed.  
Curious. Soft.  
Your touches, your words,  
I‚Äôm in awe of your poise.

Are we finding our stride?  
Is this comfort safe?

We share the same love,  
for each other, in life.  
We don‚Äôt take it for granted.  
Like air or a date circled on the calendar,  
we don‚Äôt have to talk about it,  
but we know it‚Äôs there.

In this moment our time is eternal.

**Cuchara ‚Äì July 4**

Our first two bedroom cabin.  
Our first family trip.

Taking turns.  
Building trust.

Walkie talkies, shoulder rides, and bears.  
Stomach born laughter.

She was perfect.  
And you were happy.

Our corner of heaven,  
It was all we needed.

**Crestone ‚Äì October 12**

Just meet me in the middle.  
I‚Äôm waiting.  
Vulnerable. Exposed.

I‚Äôve built my house on your cliffs,  
but I don‚Äôt fear the waves.  
I‚Äôve heard the softness of your voice.

I‚Äôd let you tear me apart,  
but I know you won‚Äôt,  
I‚Äôve felt the softness of your touch.

Let me tear you apart,  
you know I won‚Äôt.  
Trust the strength of my love.

**Jemez Springs ‚Äì February 14**

We ran through the mountains together.  
Not for the first time,  
but I never thought it would be our last.

7,000‚Äô.  
It was snowing, we didn‚Äôt hesitate.  
We never did when it came to running.

Later I asked for your hand,  
and told you I‚Äôd give you my life  
if you just said yes.

(I thought) the answer came easy.  
Things always did if we didn‚Äôt fight it.  
‚ÄúIt shouldn‚Äôt be this hard.‚Äù

Now I look back at this trip,  
and I can‚Äôt remember the details.  
Am I protecting myself or are you already a fading memory?

**Home Depot Parking Lot ‚Äì May 20**

I was five minutes early.  
You were ten minutes late.

You used to tell me I overthink things,  
but I know it means something this time.

We both had our notes ready.  
The first ones we‚Äôve written that weren‚Äôt about our love.

Yours was polished and folded neatly.  
You always focused on the small details.

I know mine was messy.  
Why does my writing always get worse at the bottom of the page?

Before I left my house that morning I read the one where you wrote that I was the love of your life.  
Are you still breathing?

It‚Äôs hard being the one that‚Äôs left behind.  
Am I supposed to feel like a child?

I almost ran back to my car after you gave me the ring.

1ktike3,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating_advice/comments/1ktike3/emotional_manipulation_at_its_finest_why/,Emotional Manipulation at its finest. Why?,"I decided to start dating again. Went on Tinder. Started swiping. Many flakes. First woman I properly chatted to I had a ton in common with. She works as a therapist.

We exchanged numbers and I spoke about grabbing a coffee together. We agreed a date, then she flaked last minute with really poor excuses. ""I realised I agreed to it but I woke up today. I feel like a I need a day of recouperation.""

So I gave her one strike and let it slide.

This occured another two times. I ended up making it clear that a boundary of mines is if I make plans with someone, I value consistency and do not appreciate plans being cancelled last minute without a good reason.

She proceeded to try project it all on me. 

""You sound like you are upset?""

""I know you said you aren't upset but you sound passive aggressive.""

I ensured none of my messages were passive aggressive and were simply assertive. She said ""Does that mean you don't want to meet me?""

I replied ""If you and I can make solid plans, yes. If not, I'll pass.""

I got a reply voice note, trying to suggest I had misunderstood something and that ""she still wanted to meet me ""sometime."" Also stuff about her valuing her time, not wanting to expend too much energy unnecessarily. So I replied with this 

""No worries. I get it. I value my time and energy too. That's why I value straight forward plans and clear intentions. It avoids confusion in a world already full of it.Enjoy the rest of your hermit day. I'm going to eat some food finally.""

She ignored me for a full week, then messaged this (see chat below)


Her: I see that you didn‚Äôt hear my message?


Me: I did listen to your voice note at the time


Me: Unless you mean you sent one after the 7th May? In which case I never got it and thought the archangels had snatched you from WhatsApp


Her: Oh right, it looks like it wasn‚Äôt received, I thought there was a glitch. Ok so i understand you don‚Äôt really want to engage.



Me: I never said I didn't want to engage. I wanted to engage in person. I'm not a big fan of online only connecting



Her: Yes of course that was the point. I never said I only wanted to connected online. You didn‚Äôt have to say you don‚Äôt want to engage, you just stopped engaging.


Her: But to be honest your reaction the other day was scary and off putting for me so my genuine enthusiasm to meet you was replaced by wanting to protect myself. It didn‚Äôt feel safe,

I blocked her immediately, as gaslighting and emotional manipulation is a no go for me. I learned from my past relationship, I will not tolerate low interest or flakiness.

I would love to say this is a single incident. I've had this a few times now with flaking but this is a first for me. A woman trying to say I made her feel unsafe with sticking by my boundaries. It doesn't bother me though. I posted to gain understanding about why people act like this.

Why does dating have to be so complicated? Why do people think it's okay to flake on people? Why then try flip it on me and try to make out I'm somehow the problem?

TL:DR - Woman I'm trying to meet for first date flakes three times over the space of a few weeks. I enforce a boundary, that when I make plans I honour them and if someone can't do that, then I'll pass on meeting them. She then attempted to gaslight me, emotionally manipulate me and force me to apologize because somehow boundaries ""make her feel unsafe.""",1,1748004056.0,dating_advice,53,0.53,False

1ktiijq,https://www.reddit.com/r/insomnia/comments/1ktiijq/no_sleep_for_two_nights_straight_tried_everything/,"No sleep for two nights straight ‚Äì tried everything, desperate for help","Hi everyone,

I‚Äôve been reading in this subreddit for a while and finally decided to share my own situation, because I‚Äôm truly at a loss. Maybe someone here has gone through something similar or has some advice that could help me move forward.

A bit about me first: I‚Äôm actually a pretty upbeat and active person. I enjoy sports, look forward to each day, love learning new things and getting stuff done. I don‚Äôt struggle with depression, and my productivity during the day is fine. I used to have a serious ‚Äúmonkey mind‚Äù problem‚Äîconstantly replaying traumatic memories and worries‚Äîbut through a lot of work (breathing techniques, cognitive restructuring, journaling, Pomodoro, etc.), I‚Äôve learned to let those thoughts go, like leaves floating down a stream.

But my biggest issue is sleep.

I‚Äôve developed what I think is a solid sleep hygiene routine:

I go to bed and wake up at the same time every single day (including weekends).

Last coffee is around 10am‚Äîso 12‚Äì13 hours before bedtime.

I eat low-carb.

No phone or media in the evening‚Äîusually the phone goes off 1.5‚Äì2 hours before bed.

I do breathing exercises, write a gratitude journal, and reflect on thoughts.

I also take various supplements (like magnesium, L-theanine, ashwagandha).


Still, I‚Äôve now had two full nights with absolutely no sleep.
I was exhausted, lying in bed, yawning, feeling tired, but it was like there was some kind of mental lock that kept my brain from switching into sleep mode. And honestly, it‚Äôs destroying me.

Last night was especially brutal. After already not sleeping the night before, I felt it in my body‚Äînumb arms, no strength, total fatigue. And yet... nothing. I even had sex with my girlfriend in the evening, hoping it would relax me enough to knock me out‚Äîbut still, I couldn‚Äôt fall asleep. Absolutely insane. I should‚Äôve passed out.

Another huge issue for me is hypersensitivity at night.
If my girlfriend moves even slightly in bed, or if I hear a loud sound outside, I‚Äôm instantly triggered. Not angry, exactly, but intensely irritated and alert‚Äîlike a switch flips in my brain. Once that happens, sleep becomes completely impossible. It‚Äôs like my nervous system is stuck in ‚Äúred alert‚Äù mode.

A doctor recently prescribed me Zopiclone 7.5mg. I‚Äôm planning to take it for one night only, just to reset and hopefully get back into rhythm. I‚Äôve also booked a sleep study to get a clearer picture of what‚Äôs going on neurologically.

My questions for you all:

Has anyone here experienced this kind of mental block, where your body is exhausted but sleep just doesn‚Äôt happen?

Could this be trauma-related‚Äîlike an overactive nervous system from years of stress?

Are there specific techniques, methods, or therapeutic practices that helped you‚Äîespecially with this kind of hypersensitive insomnia?

Does this pattern point to anything recognizable, like something from polyvagal theory, EMDR, Somatic Experiencing, etc.?


I‚Äôm open to anything‚ÄîTRE, vagus nerve stimulation, meditative approaches, breathwork‚Ä¶ I just want to sleep again. Even 4-5 hours to fall asleep would feel like a victory. But right now, I feel trapped in this loop.

Thanks so much if you made it this far‚Äîand thank you in advance for any advice, experiences, or support :)",3,1748003909.0,insomnia,0,1.0,False

Hiked in semi-arid boulders moutains.  
To avoid the day's heat, I started late, around 6pm.  
Less walk, but less heat, and less water needed.  
There are beehives at the foot of the mountain.  
That I made sure to avoid.  
Village nearby, you can see goat droppings everywhere, and there's a rooster too.  
It was around 30\*c during the day, and 10\*c at night (90\*f to 50\*f).  
Keep in mind, UV12, no cloud, and 30\*c/90\*f is in the shade.  
But there was no shade.  
I could (and have) hike all day in the sun, but that would mean for a less pleasant hike.  
After some nice scenery, I found a cool oasis in the riverbed.  
I will camp just in front, but not directly IN the riverbed.  
Even though its sand is comfy, and in the shade of the palm trees.  
Sheltered from thee cold wind at night on the side by the bedrock, it looks like a perfect spot.  
But!  
Be wary that in the desert, with no cloud in sight, there could be a storm far away.  
So far you can't see it.  
All water will then funnel down the riverbed in a flashflood.  
It is a sudden, instoppable force.  
Never, ever, sleep in a riverbed in the desert.  
After having found a cool place to camp, beside a rock wall on the border of a small oasis ( palm trees growing near the riverbed, really) I went and enjoyed the sunset.  
Back at camp, made fire, watched the stars all night.  
There was a full moon, too.  
Birds woke me p in the morning, I made coffee, and left.  
There were wilds dogs fighting (got some footage of it).

1ktii8z,https://www.reddit.com/r/Physics/comments/1ktii8z/question_if_the_einstein_equation_holds_wouldnt/,"Question: If the Einstein equation holds wouldn‚Äôt that make the universe a chaotic sea of micro-gravity wells that would always cause an indeterministic effect on a wave function, in an even completely deterministic universe? Even without a Copenhagen style collapse to explain indeterminism?","Not a physicist just been going through some text books over coffee to brush up and have found the early conversations and disagreements very interesting. 

But I‚Äôve been struggling to understand the lack of curiosity people had about explaining indeterminism at the quantum scale, pretty much tossing away the conversation from deterministic worldviews after deciding on a wave collapse that simply washes the hands of an explanation. My struggle is that even in the most conventional worldviews all these people had, the universe would almost always work out to having indeterministic properties at the quantum scale any way. Even without having multiple universes or magic clouds. 

I‚Äôll frame my question, which is open - I‚Äôd love to just learn more so please don‚Äôt be afraid to point out how I‚Äôm wrong so I can educate myself. 

If the energy momentum tensor is the variable that creates gravitational curvature - wouldn‚Äôt that create a completely chaotic cosmic sea of gravity wells and vortexes even at the electron level that would always have a subtle effect on a the wave function of all other systems near it ? 

Wouldn‚Äôt that introduce another level of systems algebra that needs to be worked out when deducing the trajectories in the wave function that would be probably be completely impossible to do in the real world ? 

To be clear, I‚Äôm not talking about whether or not the pulling and pushing of an electron‚Äôs gravitational well would be strong enough to move anything. I‚Äôm asking if the local distortions in space time introduce a level of indeterministic variables that are hard to calculate.

Before taking the leap, I reviewed the feedback on websites and r/espresso. I was excited to have a proper coffee station and practice my latte art skills. Instead, I have found myself frustrated 90% of the time that I must make a latte on this machine. So here I am, back to the drawing board and looking for advice. I liked how quickly I could brew a latte once I got used to my De‚ÄôLonghi. The Bambino is far more complex and takes much longer to make a latte in the morning. I suffer from executive dysfunction that already impacts my timeliness. Most days, this machine has only made it worse for a subpar latte. I want to stay in the $600-700 budget but could go a little higher with a grinder. Throughout my research, I kept landing on Profitec Go, but it‚Äôs a little pricier than I‚Äôm comfortable upgrading to, especially considering I would still need a new grinder.

With the Bambino Plus, I rarely pull a consistent shot of espresso. Every time, I have to press the buttons multiple times to get a 2oz shot. The milk frother worked well initially, but now, when I adjust the heat and foam levels, there isn't a noticeable difference in consistency. I've tried the custom pour setting, followed the product guide techniques, and watched a few videos on different methods. I didn't have these issues when learning on my other machine.

anyway, what happened was that i decided to lie on my bed just to close my eyes and live in the end internally with my sp. i got into my fave comfy position, lying on my right side, hugging a pillow. i didnt intend to take a nap because i wasnt really sleepy. i had coffee a few hours prior. 

but suddenly i fell asleep then woke up after what i knew was an hour already, because it got dark outside. it was the kind of nap that only felt like it lasted 10 minutes because i wasnt in a deep sleep state. this happens to me when i drink coffee and take a nap. i would feel like im in an awkward state of unconsciousness that doesnt feel like im actually sleeping. 

after that brief moment of waking up‚Äîactually im pretty i was only half-awake, then i decided to sleep again. but immediately after, it felt as if my arms turned into liquid and then they started rising, stretching out into the ceiling. my body shifts into a position like im lying on my back. it felt like i was floating in a black abyss. then, my head and ears started buzzing with static noise. my arms also started vibrating. 

i was fully aware of all this so i started affirming for my sp. that he loves me and all. then, i started seeing his silhouette, his features had a faint outline. it started getting more vivid the more i affirmed. it got to the point where i could see him blinking, his hair moving. by this point, its like my body was being pulled forward. he was just looking right at me. its like i was reaching out to him. i tried to hold on longer. but the buzzing and vibrating were getting stronger, i got spooked. so i forced my eyes to open... and there i was on my bed unmoved, still lying on my right side as if nothing happened. 

does anyone have an explanation for what happened to me? was that the beginning of astral projection or anything similar? 

it happened so out of the blue. i tried so many times before to go into SATs or to induce this kind of experience but ive always been unsuccessful. i would always either fall asleep or just not be unconscious enough. what could have triggered it? 

it got me wondering, could that have reached sp? could that have made him feel something? then again, the bigger part of me just assumes that he did. 

yeah i just needed to share that experience because that shocked me. does anyone know how i can induce it again? what could have happened if i kept going? what would more would i have seen or experienced? can anyone share a similar experience?",2,1748003232.0,lawofassumption,0,1.0,False

My husband and I recently got married and are traveling to Park City between June 1st-8th for a Mini honeymoon! We are in our late 20s and are more laid back, so not big into drinking. We will have a rental care for the entirety of our trip. We are looking for hikes 6-12 miles that are within 2 hours of park city. We are hoping to find something similar in scenery to Zion (if possible) without the distance from park city. We are foodies (i'm a dietitian and love all foods) so are looking for a variety of restaurants and coffee shops in Park City and Salt Lake City. We would like to do a fancier dinner one night to celebrate our recent marriage. Depending on the weather, we may be interested in kayaking or white water rafting. Also may be interested in horseback riding. We would love to visit hot springs at least once. I have also been practicing hot yoga for a few years now and would love to find a place to practice while on our trip. We are hoping to find the local spots in addition to more tourist sites. Feel free to share any and all recommendations for an east coast couple for relaxation, exploring, and a fun outdoor adventure. Thank you in advance!!",1,1748003108.0,parkcityvisitors,1,1.0,False

Yeah, that was me‚Äîfront and center during my company's latest performance review extravaganza. It was the kind of Kafkaesque theatre that'd make you question which absurd plot twist would come next.

So there I was, sitting across from my manager, who was armed with a checklist that might as well have had 'cause mental implosion' as a bullet point. As she started to recite the usual jargon‚Äî""impactful targets"" and ""synergistic outcomes""‚ÄîI realized I was knee-deep in a swamp of corporate buzzwords. Honestly, I half-expected her to whip out a PowerPoint presentation just to hammer home the point.

Now, I'm not saying I sat there #numb, but when she finally asked how I was handling stress, my brain temporarily tuned into ""smooth jazz"" mode and handed me a cheeky smirk instead of a sane response. I think I might have mumbled something about watching cat videos as stress therapy (true, tbh üôÉ) while internally having a minor existential crisis about how many coffee breaks it would take to navigate this absurd carnival ride. The kicker? She nodded, like I'd just delivered the secret to eternal productivity.

If nothing else, it's comforting to remember that sometimes, facing the Kafkaesque evaluation maze with humor (even if it's mostly dark üòÇ) is the best way to stay afloat.

No French, no English version.

I‚Äôm mainly referring to small and medium-sized businesses that clearly put effort into their branding, product quality, and logistics. But when it comes to language, there‚Äôs often no accessible version for non-Dutch speakers, which makes browsing and ordering quite frustrating.

From a business perspective, it seems like a missed opportunity: translation costs are relatively low, and it could make their products much more accessible to people in Brussels, Wallonia, or even international customers. A small investment for potentially big returns.

Just to be clear, I‚Äôm not trying to criticize Flemish businesses specifically. Maybe Walloon sites are the same, I honestly don‚Äôt know, since most of the ones I‚Äôve encountered happen to be Dutch-only. But in a multilingual country like Belgium, and especially in a city like Brussels, this feels like something worth discussing.

But here‚Äôs the thing. It‚Äôs now 2025. That‚Äôs six full years. And I still don‚Äôt feel right. Not sick exactly, but not normal either.

I still burp way more than a normal person, every day, especially if I bike or do anything physical. every night a wake up with what feels like a sore stomach, not painful, just like pressure or discomfort that only goes away when I sip water. I get nausea when I nap after lunch, especially if I lie on my back. It wakes me up and feels awful, but I never actually throw up. Sometimes I get a tight chest or a weird ‚Äúair bubble‚Äù feeling in my throat that makes me want to clear it constantly ‚Äî that can last for weeks.

I eat normally. I digest heavy meals. I‚Äôve gained weight. I drink coffee in the morning and eat bread, dairy, meat ‚Äî all fine. Garlic and spicy stuff makes me worse, but not right away ‚Äî it usually hits me¬†*at night*¬†when I‚Äôm trying to sleep.

No acid in the throat. No regurgitation. No vomit. Just this ongoing, annoying fake sickness (burps , constent air bubble in throat , waking up at night with sore stomach sometime nausea that goes with either burping or water ,if sever ice in neck) that never escalates but never fully leaves.

I‚Äôve read about functional dyspepsia and vagus nerve stuff, and honestly, it fits. I even ran it all by ChatGPT and it made more sense than anything I‚Äôve heard from doctors. But I still have that doubt in the back of my head ‚Äî what if something‚Äôs lingering?

Anyone else dealing with this?

Like for example I have this group of basketball friends, and I‚Äôm not the best 3 point shooter, but am the fastest/most athletic and can drive in most of the time and score.

I know basketball shit-talking is a thing, but it is crazy excessive. Every time I touch the ball - ‚Äúhe ass‚Äù, ‚Äúlet him shoot‚Äù, ‚Äútrash-ass n****‚Äù

I‚Äôm no professional - so it‚Äôs hard to block it out all the time and when I say all the time it is CONSTANT, it‚Äôs every single time I touch the ball - even tho I‚Äôm locking up the best player and scoring almost half the points consistently on the other end from 2‚Äôs. Then after the game I get hella blamed for every loss despite so many other people on the team literally missing every shot and not playing any defense. I don‚Äôt think it‚Äôs jealously bc my 3 point shot is really bad there is nothing to be jealous of

In the group chat they‚Äôll talk for a week. It‚Äôs not a big deal, but this is a subreddit for help on why it might be happening and what I can do to maybe help it a bit. Most of the time I can take it, but like once a month it gets too far. 

This is all usually fine, but yesterday I was talking back and one dude got so mad he actually left. He talked a lot of shit in the groupchat (which he started - making fun of my herniated disc of all things and not being able to sit?) so I kept calling him a little ‚Äúbitch‚Äù for talking online then being quiet irl.

Then everybody got the nerve to say (in a serious non joking way ‚Äúdude stop arguing you taking the fun out‚Äù when I was going in on this guy. This part pissed me off too. Yeah I was talking a lot of shit but I felt I was justified in all of it. Like how can you talk so much in the groupchat (with everyone going in on my disc injury at the same time of course - half the time I‚Äôm just defending myself the other half I just don‚Äôt say anything)

Also, at work, in my group of work friends, I like drinking the free coffee and not going to buy the coffee shop coffee every day. That‚Äôs something I get made fun of for. It doesn‚Äôt bother me, I just don‚Äôt see nobody else who gets that coffee get made fun of. Granted it‚Äôs light banter and not anything compared to the other group, but still I just started a job here.

This made me think, why do I always seem to be the target in every friend group? Is it lack of respect? Is it because I try to argue back and it makes it seem like these jabs get to me so they do it more? 

TLDR;
Get made fun of/‚Äúroasted‚Äù/dogged on by most of my different friend groups and always feel like a target. Not sure why it always happens to me specifically.",4,1748002515.0,socialskills,5,1.0,False

Ever hit that mid-afternoon slump where your brain feels like it‚Äôs melting? üß†üíß Yeah, me too. Every. Single. Day. It‚Äôs like 3 PM rolls around, and suddenly the world feels like it's moving through molasses. But *guess what*? I think I might‚Äôve found a little magic ‚Äî **Box Breathing** ‚Äî and it‚Äôs simple, scientific, and might just be the reboot button we‚Äôve all been craving. üöÄ

So, what‚Äôs box breathing? Besides sounding a bit fancy, it‚Äôs actually quite straightforward. It‚Äôs a breathing technique that helps you hit pause on stress and normalize cortisol levels (thank you, science!). And I experimented with it for a full week ‚Äî spoiler alert: it‚Äôs a game-changer. üòé

Here‚Äôs what the routine looked like:

1. **Inhale**: Breathe in through your nose for 4 seconds.
2. **Hold**: Hold your breath for 4 seconds. Cue the Jeopardy theme...
3. **Exhale**: Breathe out slowly through your mouth for 4 seconds.
4. **Hold again**: Yep, hold that emptiness for another 4 seconds.

Rinse and repeat this little square of breath-tranquility for about 5 minutes. Sounds easy, right? But man, did it make a difference. ‚ú®

### Here‚Äôs how it worked for me:

- **Day 1-2**: Initially, I felt a bit silly (Am I breathing right? üòÇ), but quickly realized how obvious my stress levels were.
- **Day 3-5**: I started looking forward to my mid-afternoon brain spa. My concentration felt sharper, and I wasn't reaching for coffee like a lifeline. üôå
- **Day 6-7**: Officially converted! Cooler, calmer, and suddenly more capable of taking on those tasks that made me want to nap under my desk before.

Why does it work? It's all about that cortisol ‚Äî you know, the pesky ""stress hormone."" Box breathing helps keep it balanced, which means less stress and a happier, clearer mind. üßò‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è

But hey, don‚Äôt take my word for it. Have you tried box breathing, or any other sneaky tricks to combat the afternoon slump? Maybe you've got a totally wacky tip that keeps you energized ‚Äî I‚Äôm all ears! üòâ

1kti0nq,https://www.reddit.com/r/espresso/comments/1kti0nq/mediumdark_roast_is_too_bitter_bambinojultra/,Medium/dark roast is too bitter [Bambino/J-Ultra],"Hey all, I got some coffee from Atlas and it‚Äôs on the darker side. Nothing like the Starbucks ‚Äúmedium roast‚Äù I‚Äôve seen on here, but definitely dark. So far, I‚Äôve learned that I prefer a little bit darker flavor with slightly less acidity in my cup, but these beans are only giving me a very smokey espresso with a sticky/bitter finish that lingers. Pretty unpleasant and I‚Äôd prefer a little bit more acidity and just overall balance.

Notes:
-19.0 g in, 38-40 g out
-J-Ultra is set to 1.1.5 (I think that‚Äôs how you notate it, right? Either way, this is more fine than I‚Äôm used to using. I usually go for 1.2.5)
-Shot time is 25-30 seconds typically 

My first thought was over extraction, but the shot seems to pull perfectly. If I grind any courser or use a smaller dose, it pulls way too quickly and tastes kind of thin while still being bitter.

Any tips to balance this out a bit or do you think  it‚Äôs just a bad bean? Thanks!",1,1748002420.0,espresso,4,0.67,False

It started back in college. I met this girl through a class project. She was funny, kind, one of those people who actually looked at you when you talked. I got attached‚Äîway too fast, probably. But it wasn‚Äôt just a crush. It felt deeper.

She used to text me late at night, share memes, vent about her day. We went for coffee, walked back from class together, had those conversations that stretch past midnight and make you feel seen. I kept telling myself, ‚ÄúShe‚Äôs just being nice, don‚Äôt get your hopes up,‚Äù but part of me really thought maybe she felt something too.

Then one day... she just stopped.

No warning. No fight. No slow fade. Just silence.

No replies. No eye contact at class. No explanation.

I spiraled. It felt like a breakup, but worse, because there was nothing I could point to‚Äîno closure, no reason. Just this huge hole where she used to be.

What really messed with me was how familiar that feeling was. That sudden detachment, the emotional whiplash, the way I blamed myself for everything‚Ä¶ it all dragged up stuff I hadn‚Äôt thought about in years. Stuff from when I was a kid. Being ignored. Abandoned. Left hanging by people I trusted.

I didn‚Äôt realize at the time, but it triggered something deep. I started getting panic attacks again. Couldn‚Äôt sleep. Every unread message made my chest tighten. I even found myself checking her socials obsessively, hoping for some kind of clue.

It‚Äôs wild how one-sided love can feel like real loss. And how something so simple‚Äîa silence‚Äîcan reopen wounds you thought were long buried.

I don‚Äôt hate her. I don‚Äôt even blame her. But I wish I could explain how hard it hit me. How hard it still hits me sometimes.

If anyone‚Äôs ever had someone vanish from your life and it left you shattered, just know you‚Äôre not weak. It‚Äôs not just you. That pain is real.

And it doesn‚Äôt mean you‚Äôre unlovable. It just means you cared.

Okay, friends, can we just take a moment to acknowledge the inner dialogue that sometimes plays in our heads like a continuous loop of 90s sitcom laugh tracks? üòÖ You know what I‚Äôm talking about‚Äîreplaying that awkward conversation from last week or spiraling about all the ‚Äúwhat-ifs.‚Äù Let‚Äôs be real: overthinking can feel like a full-time job, and it often pays in anxiety.

So, how do we hit ""pause"" on that endless stream of thoughts? Here‚Äôs my **go-to technique** that truly helps me wrangle my racing mind:

**The 5-4-3-2-1 Grounding Technique** 

This isn‚Äôt just a trendy mindfulness buzzword; it‚Äôs practical, it‚Äôs easy, and honestly, it works like magic. Here‚Äôs how it goes:

1. **Look around you and find 5 things you can see.**  
   - That mug? Yep. The cute cat poster? Definitely. The stack of laundry? Ugh, yes. But focus on the things that make you smile, too! üåº

2. **Then, touch 4 things.**  
   - Maybe it‚Äôs your cozy sweater, the smooth desk, or even your own hair (we‚Äôve all done it). Get tactile!

3. **Listen for 3 sounds.**  
   - Is there a clock ticking? Birds chirping outside? Maybe your neighbor‚Äôs lawn mower providing an unwelcome concert? üê¶

4. **Next, identify 2 scents.**  
   - How about that freshly brewed coffee or the lingering scent of last night‚Äôs dinner? Sometimes it‚Äôs just the smell of your favorite candle that brings comfort.

5. **Finally, taste 1 thing.**  
   - Pop a piece of gum in your mouth, sip your drink, or just savor that last crumb of chocolate. üç´

Doing this simple exercise really pulls you back into the moment and just *hits the reset button* on that overactive brain. I‚Äôve done this during stressful work moments or even before bed when my mind refuses to settle down.

But here‚Äôs the kicker: It‚Äôs not just about the exercise; it‚Äôs about tuning into your senses and literally reminding yourself that you‚Äôre right here, right now. It‚Äôs like giving your brain a little vacation!

You ever tried something similar? Anyone else have their own thought-stopping techniques that‚Äôve worked wonders? Or maybe you want to share a funny overthinking moment?
