1narp7r,https://i.redd.it/mnugrwvxiqnf1.jpeg,Detailing Discussions & Coffee: The Desperation Is Real,"I don't know how your business is doing but i can thankfully say i am above water and i have not invested one dollar in any of the marketing such as google ads, instagram ads or facebook ads.   Those platforms are the ones that are making money off the desperation of small businesses with the state of the economy.  The venom of the economy is slowly circulating through the veins of small businesses especially mobile detailling businesses.  My phone lines are dead with only scam calls coming through so when i am working, all i hear is either my music from my bluetooth headphones or crickets because literally there is no calls or inquiries. 

So what do i mean by the desperation is real?  I have a yelp business page that i have had for 11 years that i keep up just for the visibility and credibility and i stopped paying for yelp ads 7 years ago due to their sales tactics, lies, and manipulation.  Many detailers said the same that yelp is the worst and wouldn't invest another dime with them and deleted their yelp page.  I am seeing so many detailing businesses struggle and become so desperate that they are back on yelp purchasing their ads and trying to get clients to leave reviews on there.

So what is the secret to my business staying above water and keeping a full schedule in a time of uncertainty?  For one i don't do any of the google ads because when it shows ""sponsored"", it makes your ad look like a scam so from a consumer standpoint. I would skip over those ads.  Also for the 12 years i have been in business, i saved every email and contact information to build a huge client list so the returning clients are the cup of coffee and any new clients are the cream and sugar which is a bonus.  I have cut back on the video content because it went from thousands of views to like a couple hundred to like 20 views. The algorithms really f\*cked a lot of people.  

I recommend to continue to give great consistent quality to your returning clients and occasionally throw them deals but DO NOT lower your prices. Lastly, focus on staying in the top 3 of your google business listing in YOUR area.   OH and i forgot to mention to live below your means.  Don't be like one idiot detailer that's new to the game and makes a few hundred a day and is now talking about eating steak and lobster everyday.  That's the type of sh1t that will get you into trouble.  ",1,1757247495.0,Detailing,0,1.0,False

1narov0,https://www.reddit.com/r/Anxiety/comments/1narov0/nausea_from_coffee_cigarettes_and_alcohol/,"Nausea from coffee, cigarettes and alcohol","Hi folks, I've been struggling with panic attacks and anxiety since 2019. The worst period was when it started, after I learnt as much as I could about the panic attacks and managed to get it under control using different techniques. After I was living okay, even though sometimes during stressful periods some of the symptoms were coming back but it was always manageable. This year was tough and I had to come through a lot of changes and traumatic experiences in the personal life. Therefore here we go again: panic attacks and anxiety came back into my life. I tend to feel nauseous when stressed and struggle to eat when I am very anxious and under big stress. The beginning of this month I was feeling very anxious and it was coming from nothing: wet hands, pounding heart etc. The last two weeks I was feeling better in terms of anxiety, I did not have many panic attacks and I was not very anxious but I started feeling very nauseous from certain substances: coffee, cigarette smoke and alcohol. I am not a heavy smoker and could just smoke a light cigarette from time to time but now it just makes me physically sick and wanting to vomit. with coffee it's very funny, I am huge fan of coffee and was drinking it the whole life up to 4 cups a day and never had bad reaction, now it makes me super nauseous and jittery. So I had to give it up completely for some time. The same is with alcohol..  
Do any of you had similar experience with anxiety triggering intolerance to these substances? It's weird because nausea is triggered only by these products so I doubt it's connected to some stomach issues. I don't know if I should just wait for some time avoiding these products and see how I feel or if it's a sign of something worse happening with me.

The vibe among all the attendees was cliquey in a really isolating way.

Because of this, and also presenting on the last panel early in the morning after the official conference dinner and drinks (?!), I had barely anyone there for my talk, just a couple clarification questions asked, and I don't feel like I got anything good out of the experience at all, besides perhaps one new friend.

My supervisor is a major figure in the society that organises this conference and I know that he really wanted me to get involved, network, and keep coming back every year.

“TikToker Danielle (@danielle.chats) recently shared a dating disaster that left her more baffled than anything else. Like so many others navigating the modern dating scene, she matched with a guy on a dating app and agreed to meet up for a coffee/walking date.

She has some really good photos of herself on her dating profile, and a few of them are actually AI-generated, but she claims they look exactly like her.

Within the first 15 minutes of their date, he asked where one of her photos was taken. She told him that it was an AI-generated photo.

That was when the date took a turn. He declared that they weren’t a match and walked out of the date right then and there.

Danielle was stunned. She couldn’t believe he had made such a dramatic exit over it and doesn’t understand why it was such a big deal, especially since everyone is using AI-generated photos nowadays.

She thinks that if the photos actually look like you in real life, then it shouldn’t matter too much.

In the comments section, many TikTok viewers sided with the guy in this scenario. They thought the guy had every right to leave if he felt uncomfortable.

They also pointed out that the AI-generated photo didn’t look like Danielle and that she was being deceptive.

“Evidently, he felt you catfished him. I did the same thing and walked out on a chick because her pics looked nothing like her,” stated one viewer.

“He’s right; you weren’t authentic. Society needs to re-normalize not using filters, AI, and others. Instead, be real and put your real self forward,” declared another.

“It made him wonder what else you use AI for. I had a girl putting our texts through AI to determine her best reply. She accidentally copied the entire ChatGPT thing, and I instantly blocked her,” added someone else. “ Emily Chan

1nargyv,https://www.reddit.com/r/Xenoblade_Chronicles/comments/1nargyv/xbc2_rantjust_need_to_vent/,XBC2 Rant(just need to vent),"Ok so i wanna preface this by saying I'm not coming here to just bash the game and leave, I want to vent my frustrations from my experience with the game and (when I have time) discuss these with people who felt differently. so Please don't be hostile in the comments.

Ok SO  
for slight backstory, I first played XBC on the 3DS and played some of XBCX on wii u, I LOVED them both i just never ended up finishing XBCX, now when 2 came out I was gunna get it but didn't have the funds at the time. When i learned the story was ""separate""(didn't know about the overarching story, just thought it was pulling a Final fantasy) I chose to wait for reviews. The reviews I saw mostly complained about how cringey and pandery the game was, so i decided to skip it. Then XBC3 comes around and I heard it slapped and decided to buy, unfortunately i learned quickly that all the games were connected and i was missing helpful story info from 2. I ended up taking a break from 3 while i decided what to do and just abandoned it in the end.

cut to now, I was able to borrow a copy of XBC2 from a new friend and decided i was going to replay 1, play 2, then finish 3. I spent about 3 weeks having such a blast in XBC:DE on the switch, Even tried to 100% it(it didn't go as planned but was still super fun!). I finally closed the book on that playthrough about 4 days ago and set up my playthrough of 2. Going into it i was excited to see if maybe i was wrong about 2 from all the newer reviews praising the game for its excellent combat, amazing story and villains, etc. Which i chose to believe as having just experiences 1 again I was so in love with the first game's wonderful story, beautiful designs of world and characters, fun combat system that felt like i could play anyone like an expert, a super fun(albeit grindy) affinity system, just an overall excellent experience.

Unfortunately i lasted a total of 3 hours 36 minutes and 23 seconds before decided I was never going to touch 2 again. I ultimately decided to watch a commentary-less playthrough on youtube instead(bear in mind as I'm writing this I'm watching the portion where you get poppi, so please be wary of spoiling me <3)

Now for my reasoning and such..The first issue I took with the game was the Voice acting...at first it was just kinda awkward, but later portions it feels like they just handed some of them a script and said ""just read this however you want..."" like why is pyra doing a crying animation while talking like she's sitting down sipping coffee???? It felt like listening to a 4Kids cartoon dubbing....gave me One Piece ptsd lol

The Second issue i had was the art style...i know for a lot of people the game is beautiful and dont get me wrong it not a poorly designed style but...it feels like I'm playing a playstation exclusive anime game instead of a game like Xenoblade Chronicles 1. It just personally felt like a downgrade to me.

The third issue was the biggest one for me....the combat feels butchered into nothingness...in XBC1 you get 8 arts and a talent art, locked on to strafe the target and auto attack at all times, the only art cooldown is a timer after using them. It felt super fluid and easy to get ahold of and just let me feel very involved in the fights. But in 2....no auto attacks while moving, not locked on so you have free movement instead, you have 3 arts and a special, the arts have to charge off auto attacks and the special charges off the arts...but by the time you get one the enemy is already dead and you just sat there for 30 seconds while the character did all the work for you...It felt like i was playing an afk game...Then they introduced the driver system and how you gotta stand near your blades for optimal damage, but you cant tell them what to do...so if you want to use an art that needs a specific part of the body you have to move there, wait for the blade to follow you, then hope you can use it before the enemy turns. It just BAFFLES me how the combat system is considered the ""best in the series"" when it feels like the game wants to prevent me from doing ANYTHING towards combat.

The fourth issue i had...the unbelievable sexualization and as it would be put today ""gooning"". The femal characters are unbelievably sexualized...Like i've played the Bayonetta franchise with no qualms but this game made me physically cringe over the way it sexualized the female characters. The npcs in the starting port are literally dressed like exotic dancers for the Chief nopon guy Now granted not ALL the females are sexualized, for example Nia was in a full coverage onesie style suit so i was happy with that in comparison to pyra who just has it all hanging out. I liked her design more in Smash Bros, didn't know it was an edited design until now. The scene that really put me off was when Rex wakes up and its just an egregious 10 seconds of staring at Pyra's underboob, i just couldnt deal with it after that.

The fifth issue i had was the game's storytelling in SOME parts..there were 2 major scenes in the beginning in which important characters beef it and then IMMEDIATELY they revoke the deaths...like how am i supposed to take it seriously or be upset in sad scenes when clearly they dont mind reversing death?

The final issue i had actually came more AFTER i started watching the video playthrough. The game acts like its just a straight up anime...but the charm of the anime-esque scenes dont translate well...examples being:

1. nia and her tiger bickering about the wanted poster
2. poppi's activation
3. the whole scene of rex calling pyra heavy and the bit before that. like i appreciate what they are trying to do with it and 100% scenes like that can come across well, but like...it just felt awkward and humorless... 
4. oh and sorta sidebar, bonus 4th one being the scene where the guards didnt know what color emerald was....there was no legit punchline...it was just ""oh i didnt know"" and then they moved on, like if they had made it a random joke about him being colorblind or like they cant see color in their helmets it would've been funny but it just was awkward

NOW. With all that said, these are just my personal feelings about my experience with 2. I'm more than happy to discuss with you guys and would honestly like to hear your thoughts feelings and opinions as well, but again, please remain respectful and non-hostile to eachother <3",0,1757246790.0,Xenoblade_Chronicles,2,0.29,False

I’ve been interning at a firm where I met this girl who is also interning. I developed a crush on her the moment I saw her. She’s transitioning from an accounting role and wants to enter finance, while I recently completed my graduation, and we both have been interning in similar roles. She seems really sweet and mature, and sometimes she flirts with me as well.

We finally had our first conversation over coffee during a break after 20 days of back and forth. We talked about religion, culture, politics, and found that our views align quite closely. I really enjoy talking to her, and we have so much in common.

It’s been about a month since we met, and things felt like they were developing into a dating situation. Just the other day, she asked me how old I was, and she was surprised when I told her I’m 23. She thought I was the same age as her or older because of my build.

Since then, she seems to be ignoring and avoiding me for some reason. I’m not sure what happened, but she doesn’t engage with me like she used to. She used to greet me, but now she only answers my questions and then leaves. I asked her to have coffee with me this morning, but it feels like she’s deliberately avoiding me.

1nara9s,https://www.reddit.com/r/waterfilterreviews/comments/1nara9s/should_you_buy_the_kitchenaid_kad1rxd1/,Should You Buy the KitchenAid KAD1RXD1 Refrigerator Water Filter Review Explained,"Testing out the KitchenAid KAD1RXD1 Refrigerator Water Filter over the past few weeks has genuinely been an experience worth sharing. The way this filter promises clean, fresh-tasting water while reducing harmful contaminants got me intrigued, so I decided to see how it would perform in a real-world setting. Whether you're sipping on ice water daily, using filtered water for cooking, or just wanting to skip continuously buying bottled water, this filter seems to tick many of the right boxes. But, like any product, there are strengths and a few trade-offs to consider before diving in.

**Impressive Design Features**

At first glance, the compact and efficient design stood out. Measuring 2.5 inches in diameter and 8.75 inches in height, this slim build fits perfectly into my KitchenAid refrigerator without any struggle. I've dealt with water filters before that seemed almost too bulky for their intended slots, but this one seamlessly slid into place. Made from durable plastic, it strikes a balance between lightweight practicality and lasting material quality. I also appreciated the clear labeling and instructions on the box, which made installing it a breeze.

**Performance in Daily Use**

The performance has been nothing short of impressive. This filter is NSF certified and claims to reduce up to 28 contaminants, including lead, pesticides, and pharmaceuticals. While I couldn’t test every contaminant claim, the water taste itself was noticeably fresher and cleaner compared to a prior off-brand filter I was using. It's hard to believe how much of a difference a good water filter can make until you try it. My family has commented that even our morning coffee tastes smoother. Knowing that it's also capable of replacing the equivalent of 1,500 plastic water bottles is an added win for me, not just for convenience but for the environment too.

**Good Points**

- Certified by NSF, guaranteeing a higher level of contaminant reduction.  
- Easy installation without any setup headaches.  
- Noticeable improvement in water clarity and taste.  
- Helps reduce my reliance on plastic water bottles.

**Filtering Longevity and Maintenance**

When it comes to upkeep, replacing the filter every six months seems manageable, though I'd suggest marking the next replacement date somewhere visible. Some reviews noted they'd been able to stretch the usage even longer, but I wouldn’t recommend that for homes with higher water usage. The filter itself has held up well so far, with no leaks or odd tastes even after consistent daily use. Removing and reinstalling it for inspection was straightforward, and it didn’t require the usual wrestling with refrigerator parts that I've encountered with competing products.

**Less Favorable Aspects**

- Compatible only with specific KitchenAid refrigerators, so make sure to double-check your model.  
- Slightly pricier replacement cost compared to generic options.  
- The sustainability claim of replacing 1,500 water bottles is great, but those who replace frequently may feel this isn’t entirely achievable.  

**Competing Brands**

Comparing this filter to similar ones, I used a generic competitor before upgrading, and the difference was noticeable almost immediately. While the substitute filter was cheaper, it lacked NSF certification and didn’t improve the water's taste nearly as effectively. Other brands like Samsung filters offer similar contaminant-reduction claims, but they tend to be more expensive with seemingly identical performance metrics. The broader compatibility of more general products is tempting, but the tailored fit and certification of this option give it an edge for KitchenAid users.

**Worth Every Penny**

While the filter is on the higher end of pricing in its niche, what you're paying for is premium performance and certification from a known brand. Cheaper alternatives might save you money initially, but they often cut corners on water purity standards. For someone who values clean water for both drinking and cooking, this investment feels completely justified. Skipping on quality here didn’t feel like an option to me, especially after the noticeable improvement in taste and quality compared to my last unbranded filter.

==========

The grey snow crunched satisfyingly under my boots as Lachlan and I walked out of the ship. My shoulder was still sore, but it was nice being able to move it outside of the sling. Despite how confidently Lachlan was walking, my own boots didn’t do much for balance. The ice was slippery, the cold was biting, and the air tasted hot through the mask.

“Stars, and I thought the burn ward was cold,” I squeaked, heavily shivering.

“Minus fifty doesn’t fuck around, lass. If your ears weren’t tucked away in that hood, they’d fall off in minutes.”

I bleated softly, hearing that, since I’d thought that was a myth. Instead of revealing my foolishness, however, we continued trekking through the barely touched snow. The landscape, despite its inhospitable nature, was gorgeous. Icicles hung from what looked like trees, growing meters long and shining in the glow of the plant life. I detached from Lachlan and stumbled my way over to one of the “trees,” looking at its glowing veins.

“I’ve never seen plants like this…I knew they existed, but they’re incredible,” I brayed, running my gloved paw up its length. “Have you ever seen anything like this?”

Lachlan walked over and placed a hand on my shoulder. “Went on a trip with my dad to a place called Puerto Rico. Saw a beach where the waves glowed blue. Maybe I’ll take you there if we visit Earth.”

I looked up at him, his face obscured by the visor. “Really? Do you mean it?”

“Course I do, lass.”

“Do you promise?”

“Aye. And I never break promises,” he replied as he rubbed the top of my head. Retaking his hand, we walked away from the glowing tree. Its leaves, if they could be called that, swayed gently in the breeze. 

“This forest is wild. Everything looks so eerily similar, but just different enough to be off-putting. And everything smells like sulphur. Have you noticed that?” Lachlan asked, his gaze shifting throughout the forest.

“Can’t smell, remember? The air does taste weird, though, even through the mask. Like sulphur, maybe?”

Lachlan laughed. “I could make a comparison to the taste of the air, but I think it would make you sick.”

“Is it some predator thing?”

“It’s some predator thing,” he replied. I could feel his weird, smug smile through his visor.

Deciding to ignore my exchange partner’s annoying attempts at comedy, we continued walking through the frozen woods. The forest seemed peaceful, if not a little off-putting. Cevra seemed to enjoy it thoroughly, as he skipped around through the snow, never disturbing it. This was also deeply unnerving, but seeing him happy put me at ease. 

Suddenly, though, Lachlan stopped. “Lass, don’t move,” he said, his voice quiet through the radio.

I froze, scanning my surroundings. The mask restricted just enough of my vision to make me uncomfortable with the idea that something could be hiding in my manufactured blind spot. Whatever Lachlan spotted, though, wasn’t apparent to me. 

“Did something happen?” I asked, looking up at him. His head was locked on the ground ahead of us.

“Look down. What do you see?”

I did as he said and looked at the ground. “Tracks.”

“Right. Unless we’re getting the wool pulled over our eyes, we’ve got confirmation of life,” he confirmed, lightly brushing the knife on his hip.

“Pull the…what’s that supposed to mean?”

“Don’t worry about it, Hal,” Lachlan replied, pointing at the ground. “Track, there.”

Staring into the track, its size made me nervous. Whatever made it was huge. “I…we should be careful, yeah?” I asked quietly.

“Aye. It reminds me of an animal from back on Earth. A nasty one, too,” he said. “Stick by me. Hopefully, whatever it is won’t stick around when it notices us.”

His hopefulness did not help quell my nerves.

==========

After some more wandering, we both stopped again. It wasn’t tracks, this time.

“Gods, this place is gorgeous. Wanna take a short rest?” Lachlan asked, gesturing to the brilliantly lit caves we’d stumbled upon. Soft orange light spilled from their entrances, and it reminded me deeply of stumbling into Cevra’s house after a paw of playing in the woods. His mother always kept the house very warmly lit.

“I wouldn’t complain. My paws are aching.”

“Let’s go, then,” Lachlan said, grabbing my paw and leading me through the snow. All of the walking was tiring, but he seemed to be barely even fazed. I guess that’s the difference between a barely in shape nurse and a soldier. We trudged through the frozen ground, Lachlan catching me once as I tripped, and we finally reached the cave. It didn’t take long to realize what the light was coming from.

“Is that lava?” I inquired, glancing at the gently bubbling, orange liquid deeper in the cave.

“Seems to be. We should rest here and then head back to the ship. Don’t need to go spelunking on our little scouting mission,” Lachlan responded.

I flicked my tail in agreement, a gesture Lachlan had finally seemed to pick up, and followed him into the opening. The cavern was wide and didn’t look like it had much depth to it. The lava lit it just enough to see each jagged wall. A steady flow of warm air came from deeper in the cave and enveloped us, as if the planet was giving us an embrace. A tight, comforting embrace.

The human found a spot covered in the least jagged stone and sat down against it. With a sigh, he gestured for me to join him, which I did happily. I curled up against him, basking in any extra warmth I could get.

“What, you cold, lass?” he asked, putting an arm over my shoulder.

“Y’know that overheating problem I’ve got? It works the other way, too. This place just seems to steal all the heat I’ve got,” I replied, snuggling up even closer. “And you’re warm. So you get to be the heating pad for right now.”

“I can live with that…” he trailed off, looking deeper into the cavern. “Say, think this is a volcano, or just some lava cave?”

“Uh…a volcano, probably. It’s under a mountain. Or what I’d guess is a mountain. I’m not sure what counts as a mountain here.”

“I’d hazard a guess that you’re right. Apparently, volcanoes are great spots to relax.”

I giggled. “Yeah, seems like it.” There was then a long pause, as the two of us just drank in our surroundings—the soft light, the warm air, our methodical breathing piercing the relative silence. 

“Lachlan…” I asked, looking at the ground. “Why did we come down here? Was it really just to do some exploring?”

“Aye, Halna, it was. I also wanted to stretch my legs. The yoga routine we’d do on the ship just wasn’t cutting it for me, no matter how enthusiastic you were about it.”

“Oh…I thought you liked the yoga. You were the one who suggested it…” I tried to let my ears droop dramatically, but the suit fought me at every turn.

“I liked it, Hal. It was very engaging.” Cevra chimed, hanging upside down above us.

“You were busier staring at my tail than doing the yoga,” I hissed, catching the sudden glare Lachlan gave me as I said it.

“What? I was doing no such thing,” Lachlan scoffed. I was lucky he couldn’t see my face, as they would surely have been bright orange.

“I-I didn’t mean you, Lachlan. I…speh.” This time, my ears managed to defeat the stiff suit and drooped alongside my head. I tried my best to ignore Cevra’s giggling from the ceiling.

“Not saying your tail isn’t nice, Halna,” Lachlan mumbled, looking back towards our opposing wall.

“Huh?”

“I thought that you might have taken that as an insult. And I didn’t mean it that way.”

“Wait, take what as an insult?”

“Nevermind, Halna,” Lachlan sighed. Standing, he cracked his back and offered a hand to me. “I think we should head back. I can put some tea on, and we can get these masks off.”

“Yeah,” I bleated, glancing up to Cevra, or where he had just been. Lachlan helped me up, and we started to head out of the cave. As if a switch flipped, the cold wind of the outside shot through me like a hail of bullets. I reflexively hung onto Lachlan, who graciously obliged in acting as my heated crutch.

“I can’t imagine any mining teams are going to like this place much,” my human stated, not slowing down to speak.

“Why’s that?”

“It’s too cold, which’ll cause the batteries on their equipment to crap out, and it’s too sooty. Have you noticed how it’s practically snowing black powder? Unless it’s something special, this is probably burned plant matter. Maybe thanks to the volcanoes,” Lachlan mused. “Who’d want to replace the air filters constantly?”

“Not me,” I mewled, “I used to get forced to do that in the hospital. Really annoying work.”

He glanced in my direction. “I thought you were a nurse?”

“I was.”

“And they had you doing maintenance?”

“Yup.”

“Did they not have a janitor or something?”

“They did.”

“Why did they have you change the air filters?”

“They were a bunch of bark-munching tailholes. That’s why,” I snarled, tail thrashing. As soon as my display of predation started, I grabbed my tail with my free paw. “Um…sorry. I get ahead of myself sometimes.”

“Ah, we all do,” he said, patting my shoulder. “Come on, we’re almost there.”

We continued trudging along through the snow, approaching the ship, before both of us stopped dead in our tracks. Through the darkness, lit up by the faint glow of the surrounding plantlife, were five massive creatures. I couldn’t tell exactly what they were, but they would have dwarfed a shadestalker. Lachlan pulled me behind some nearby trees, almost prompting a surprised yelp.

“What the fuck are those things?” I asked, peeking around the tree. The animals were stalking around the ship, cautiously investigating the quietly whirring machine.

“I don’t know. We’re just gonna have to wait for them to clear out.” Lachlan moved his hand down to his hip, paused, and then just let it hang.

“What’s that for??” I asked.

“I was making sure my knife was there.”

“What’s your knife going to do for you right now?” I scoffed.

“Maybe save our lives if one of those things comes over here,” he snapped. I flinched at his retort before my ears drooped slightly.

“You’re…you’re right—” my agreement was interrupted by a flash and a bang. Lachlan and I snapped our gazes around to the source. Two of the beasts were in pieces, pierced by burning shards of the ship’s hull. A blaze had engulfed the back half of our vessel, and even though the fire suppression systems put it out quickly, I could feel our sense of safety draining in an instant. One, horrible instant. The other three animals scattered, leaving their brethren to die.

*No…*

==========

Lachlan and I stood there behind the tree for a long time. We were both silent, but the tears running down my face were quickly fogging up my visor. Lachlan was mumbling something next to me, quiet enough for my translator to detect it.

“What…” I started, the words catching in my throat. “How? What happened?”

“I…I don’t know.”

Lachlan started tentatively moving towards the dying creatures, and I hesitantly followed. The walk up to the ship was the longest in my life, and it only occurred to me later that walking up to a just recently detonated ship might have been a poor choice…but we weren’t thinking. I paused as I reached one of the dying things. The dark fluid leaking from its wounds froze almost immediately as it left its body. As I watched its chest rise and fall, I heard a wet sound come from behind me, followed by a crunch. Turning, I say that the other animal, which Lachlan had crouched next to, wasn’t breathing anymore. My eyes were drawn to his hands, covered in frozen, dark liquid.

“L-Lachlan?”

“They’re suffering, Hal. It’s better for it if you just end its pain now. Just grab its head and twist it around as quickly as you can,” he said, like it was second nature. “It’ll only hurt for a moment, and then it’ll be gone.”

“O-okay…” I mewled, putting my paws on the creature’s head. Its fur felt soft through my gloves, and its strained breaths made what was happening all too real. Why was I even considering it? Was I a predator, too? If I hadn’t controlled myself, is this what I would have done to Galri? My paws began to shake, and the rest of my body followed suit quickly. “No…n-no, I can’t.”

“You can’t what?”

“Kill it. Kill something…”

Lachlan paused, his glare burning through his all too opaque mask. Wordlessly, he stood and walked over, dispatching the animal in one seemingly practiced movement. After committing this act, one I had been taught was the deepest crime in the galaxy, he just crouched there. The silence felt like an eternity.

“Lachlan, I…”

“No, I shouldn’t have.”

“But—”

“No, Halna, no. Putting an animal down isn’t something you’d be fine to do, I knew that. That’s predator work,” he said, still looking at the corpse. “Let’s check out the damage. If we’re lucky, the explosion only took one of the thrusters.”

I found it difficult to look away from the dead animal. The fact that exterminators would stare down this sight every paw set my fur on end. “Monsters…” I mumbled under my breath. If Lachlan had heard it, he didn’t have any obvious reaction. I stood, following the human, and looked at the mess of tangled steel and melted cabling. While I wasn’t a ship technician, I could still tell that at least three of the thrusters were beyond fucked. Lachlan was investigating them much closer than I was, staring at the lowest thruster pack.

“There are claw marks. Right across one of the fuel lines. It must have leaked and lit once it touched the thruster’s shroud. I thought I was being smart by keeping them lit to keep the ice out.”

I came over and took a look. Sure enough, claws had raked over one of the pipes and ripped it to shreds. “But…how?” I asked, staring at the shallow cuts in the metal. “How could they get through that metal?”

“Don’t know, Hal…but we’re fucked. I could have flown on three, but I sure as shit can’t fly on one. That won’t even lift the thing.”

“Does that mean…”

“Aye. We’re stuck.”

My world was quickly crumbling around me, and the long day, mixed with the strain and the stress, did a real toll on me. Stumbling backwards, I felt faint. The last thing I heard was a yell from Lachlan as everything went black.

==========

I awoke to warm air on my front and cold metal on my back. The shock from the opposing temperatures made me shoot up, looking around to figure out where I was. When my eyes adjusted to the light, I realized I was in…the ship? There was no Lachlan in sight, though. I stood, realizing how incredibly sore my legs were, and wandered towards the back.

*Maybe he’s in his quarters?*

Making my way back there, I realized that there was no way he’d be in his quarters. They had been sealed off by the fire prevention systems, a blast door moving into place. A cold wind blew through the ship, sending shivers throughout my whole body, and I whipped around to see what the source was. Lachlan was standing in the doorway, large bags in his arms, tossing them to the ground and pulling off his snow-covered mask.

“Oh, you’re awake, Hal. I’m glad,” he said, running a gloved hand through his beard.

“How long was I out?”

“About an hour, I think, lass. You took quite the tumble, too. Just narrowly missed impaling yourself on one of those shards. I’m glad you’re back in the world of the living.”

Investigating myself, excluding the scar on my shoulder, I was injury-free. It only then clicked, though, that I was undressed. “Lachlan, did you take all my stuff off?”

“I was trying to figure out if you were hurt. I thought that 3 layers of cold-weather clothes probably wouldn’t help in the diagnosis,” he replied, taking off his own gear. “Sorry.”

“No, it’s…it’s fine. I’m just surprised. My arm came out fine?”

“Aye, no problems there. It’s healing good by the looks of it, too.”

There was an audible pause between the two of us. We just…stared at each other. Stared and stared until I finally sank to my knees, and he sat against the wall.

“We’re fucked.”

“Aye, seems like it.”

“Honestly, it doesn’t feel real,” I brayed, running my paws through my head wool. “We were just down to explore.”

“Aye…and I doomed us by making that choice.”

“Hey, I could have said I was uncomfortable…” I responded, pausing. “Is it…is it normal to just not feel anything about this?”

“What do you mean?” he asked.

“Like…I don’t know, it just feels empty. We’re gonna die here, and I don’t feel a thing.”

“Halna, that isn’t normal, but…we need hope. I’m sure we can figure something out. You’re brilliant, and I’m just slightly above average.”

“Really? You actually think we’ve got a chance here?” I scoffed. “We’ve got a downed ship, a planet that’s too cold to be outside without protection, and giant whatever-the-hell-those-things-are. It’d be lucky if we last a paw.”

“Halna…”

“I’m…I actually do feel something about this. I’m scared, Lachlan.”

He got up and strode over, lifting me into a hug. I fully pulled myself into that hug, burying my snout into his chest. “Fear is fine, Hal, but you can’t just give up. We can get out of this,” he stated, putting me down. I couldn’t help but whimper a bit as he let me down, but luckily, he seemed not to notice. “The power generation of the ship luckily still works, as well as the air filtration. We’ve got a couple of weeks of food, and about an equal amount of water. Finding suitable water won’t be too hard, though, if we’re lucky. We’ve got shelter, food for a good while, and water sorted. Once we have the food fully sorted, then we can cover everything else.”

“What do you mean by everything else?”

“Getting an SOS out. I haven’t even dared to look at the readings, but remember how you couldn’t really pick up any readings from orbit despite the signal being so strong?”

“Yeah…wait, do you think something’s blocking signals?” I mused. A hand ruffling my fluff answered the question.

“Exactly. I just don’t know if it’s natural or unnatural. The second option…worries me. But whatever, we’ve got work to do.”

“Point me in the direction and it’ll get done.”

==========

“Over the next few hours, Lachlan had me doing a bunch of tasks he was too big to get to. Mostly in the maintenance crawlspaces.”

“So you two were busy from the get-go?” Corporal Hughes asked, drinking his coffee. I was nursing my firefruit juice as well.

“Yeah…it was a lot of work getting the ship set up, but since it seemed like we’d be stuck, it was worth it,” I said through a sip. “Though Lachlan was hiding something from me. Luckily for him, I was too busy to notice, but I’m still sore over it.”

“What was he hiding?”

==========

“So what am I looking for, Lachlan?”

“A switch labelled ‘backup.’ It’ll have a piece of yellow tape on it as well.”

The underbelly of the ship was cold, uninviting, and really confusing. It was separately pressurized from the rest of the interior, and in case there were any ruptures, Lachlan had me put on my gear. I had already been down there for about a quarter claw by the time I spotted the mythical yellow tape.

“Hey, Lachlan, I found it. What do I do now?”

The radio crackled for a moment, and the silence was longer than I liked. Eventually, he came back. “Just flip it. It says the correct position is…up. I think.”

“Are you okay up there? You’ve been acting weird.”

“Yeah, yeah…I’m alright, lass. Just have split attention right now. Trying to read the manual and the stuff coming up on the monitor,” he replied, sounding unsure.

“Hm…okay. Either way, I’ll flip it. Tell me if it worked right.” I scooted my way over to the switch and set it skyward. Immediately, the ship started to shake. “Lachlan? What the fuck is going on?”

“Ship’s deploying her stabilizers, and the wind turbines are getting put up. Good work. Come on up…I need to show you something.”

“Uh, okay. Coming up now.”

I worked my way back out of the crawlspace, feeling like a piece of canned melo root. Pulling myself out and back into the waking world, I found Lachlan seated, staring at the monitors.

“What’s the deal, Lachlan?”

“Come over and sit down,” he said. I did as I was told, pulled off my gear, and hopped into my copilot chair. “I’ve gotta tell you something, Hal.”

I looked up at him, perplexed. “Tell me what?”

“The temperature has dropped. Massively.”

“Wait, how massively? It was like negative fifty earlier.”

“It’s negative ninety right now, unless our thermometer is broken. We’d be dead if we went outside.”

I just stared at him. I didn’t really have anything to say. “Do you think all of those creatures will be fine?”

“I can’t imagine this is the first time this has happened. They’re probably equipped to handle it,” I hadn’t noticed before, but it was now obvious that he was avoiding my eyes. After all that had happened since we landed…I decided not to press him on it.

“Well, we’re stuck here either way…wanna play some Uno? I might beat you this time.”

“Yeah, if Hell freezes over,” Lachlan replied, chuckling. He glanced outside the window for a moment before looking back at me. “Bad choice of words.”

by [https://www.gptsportswriter.com](https://www.gptsportswriter.com) **The Chiefs’ International Shame: How the Chargers Trampled Patrick Mahomes’ Dynasty in São Paulo**

Ladies and gentlemen, gather ‘round for the most geographically confused football game since the Lions tried to play in Detroit *and* Dubai simultaneously. On September 6, 2025, the Kansas City Chiefs—America’s favorite team to embarrass themselves abroad—traveled to São Paulo to face the Los Angeles Chargers. Spoiler: It was less “Mahomes’ Dynasty Rises” and more “Mahomes Tripped Over His Own Hubris.”

Let’s parse the stats like a Brazilian fan deciphering a Portuguese解说. The Chargers’ Justin Herbert was a surgical precision weapon, racking up 350 passing yards and 2 touchdowns while adding 30 rushing yards. For context, Mahomes mustered 141 passing yards—about as impactful as a whisper in a hurricane. The Chiefs’ star QB was so stifled, he probably considered switching to soccer and becoming a goalkeeper. (Note: Do *not* tell Pat Mahomes this; his punting career is already fragile.)

The Chiefs’ offense didn’t help itself. Wide receiver Xavier Worthy, their primary target, went down early with an injury, leaving Mahomes to target… well, maybe a bird in the stands? The Chargers’ defense, meanwhile, was the party crasher of the night, forcing a three-and-out and sacking Herbert… wait, no, *Mahomes*. My apologies! They sacked *Mahomes* once, which is about as shocking as seeing a penguin in a bikini. The Chargers’ defense, which was the NFL’s best in points allowed last season, proved they could also play “humiliate the Chiefs” soccer—er, football.

Now, let’s digest the news. The Chiefs, fresh off an 11-game losing streak, were trying to avoid becoming the first team since the 1970s to lose 17 straight. Their international schedule? A cursed quagmire. They’ve played in London, Frankfurt, Mexico City, and now São Paulo—a global tour of shame. Meanwhile, the Chargers, led by coach Jim Harbaugh (a man who treats Week 1 like a Netflix premiere), aimed to end their 11-game skid. Their secret weapon? Rookie wideout Omarion Hampton, who’s been compared to a caffeinated gazelle. (Full disclosure: Hampton didn’t score, but he did make Mahomes look like a deer in headlights.)

Humor time! The Chiefs’ fans in São Paulo were like a 90% charged phone: hopeful, but doomed. They packed the Neo Química Arena, chanting “Super Bowl!” while the Chargers responded with a touchdown that made the crowd’s optimism evaporate faster than a cold beer in the Brazilian sun. And let’s not forget the game’s most viral moment: Neymar, Odell Beckham Jr., and Travis Kelce awkwardly attempting a TikTok dance. It was less “celebrity synergy” and more “why is everyone touching me?”

So, who won? The Chargers, of course. Why? Because when your QB looks like a waterfall (Herbert’s 350 yards) and the other team’s QB looks like a sprinkler (Mahomes’ 141), math dictates you pick the waterfall. The Chiefs’ “international experience” is now a cautionary tale, and the Chargers’ defense is the reason we still believe in second chances.

**Prediction:** The Chargers’ 27-21 victory wasn’t just a win—it was a poetic punch to the Chiefs’ ego. Unless Mahomes starts training his dog to catch passes, Kansas City’s dynasty is taking a coffee break. Bet on the Chargers, or better yet, bet on the Chiefs to lose another game in a city you’ve never heard of. The pattern’s *so* consistent, it’s practically a Netflix series.

*Final Score: Chargers 27, Chiefs 21. Final Embarrassment: 10/10.* 🏈🇧🇷

1nar66c,https://www.reddit.com/r/NatureofPredators/comments/1nar66c/homeward_bound_4/,Homeward Bound - [4]," In this part of Krev the Krev propaganda, Breeve has to fill in for some of her coworkers on Christmas eve, we also get to see that Breeve hasn’t gotten over the cute reaction at all in her time spent on Tellus. Once again thank you to u/SpacePaladin15 for creating the NOP universe and Krev.

 

**Memory Transcription Subject: Breeve, Krev Tourism Expert.**

Date \[*Standardized human time*\]: December 24, 2160

“Yes, I know that there’s a slight disturbance in the way the system is working, it will return to normal after the holiday. The problem is from the amount of calls we have been getting.” I said into the microphone in front of me.

“I see, is it at all possible to have a look at the residence as soon as possible?” The new client spoke, having already asked the same question three times now each time being redirected back to me.

“I will patch you through to the available operator, I must say sorry for the disruption in services, but the system is overloaded.” I said before switching the call.

I sat back letting out a sigh at the amount of office work I’ve had to do today, most of the staff didn’t call in today. I’ve had to fill in with the office work and calls instead of my usual work of getting people to their housing units and making sure they are suited to the place they would be staying.

“You alright Breeve?” A Krev named Terly asked on my right, she was wearing a headset with a mic built into it like my own. I was paired with her today since I had very little experience in doing this type of work.

“No, that’s the same guy who called three times now thinking he would get to the front of the waiting que.”

“Oof, yeah you get those from time to time. It’s like they have a single-track mind that only they exist.” She admitted typing away at her own desktop.

I pushed my chair out from the desk and looked around the carpeted room, it was full of cubicles with colourful dividers and a nice view of the boardwalk out one of the windows. I was dreading having to work in a place like this before, but it seems rather nice, though the thought was crushed when I had to start dealing with calls.

Outside I could see that they had decorations along each of the trees, them having tinsel and lights wrapped around them. The office was a bit like that as well, having a small tree in the corner decorated.

I found it cute and thought about the one we had back home.

“Are taking your break?” She asked following me with her gaze.

“Think I’ll stretch my legs a bit and grab a coffee, do you want one?” I asked trying to be cordial to my colleague.

“Would love one.” They beamed back at me before returning to typing away.

I got out of the chair taking a few wobbly steps since my legs fell asleep while working, I soon stabilised and made my way through the sparsely populated office space and entered the break room. I passed by a few desktops that had photo frames and plushies, I knew they were Krev owned the second I glanced at them.

Some of them had little human plushies that were popular with kids and from the photos I saw, it was caricatures of the humans or obors. Some of the photos were of actual humans though, some of them contained a Krev who seemed overjoyed to be talking to one of them.

Though it seemed that some of them were getting overly touchy with the human’s hair I noted as I passed by a cubicle.

It reminded me of what I was like when I first got here at the height of the human fad sweeping across the Consortium, the memory of sitting across from Edward trying to fiddle with his fingers while he signed travel documents lingered for a while. I didn’t even notice I had entered the break room when I stumbled into a chair leg.

‘I will say that the next best thing to humans for me was the coffee they brought with them, I don’t know how I would even be functioning before this.’

I grabbed two cups out of the cupboard and rinsed them out at the sink before placing them next to the pot. I added the delectable granulates to the machine and switched it on waiting for it to start producing the invaluable elixir.

I got a little bored waiting and decided that I would have a look at what was happening on Tellus since yesterday, some of the social media posts I saw where vitriolic, made by the humans leaving. I guessed that they were also part of the miners’ strike and just wanted to get away from us, it hurt to think that they carried that much hate for us in their hearts while we couldn’t to them.

The thought made me realise that it was a big possibility that we would have to travel with these people if everything went according to plan. I didn’t like the thought of being trapped in a ship with these people with what they were saying about the Krev, but I knew there had to be security at the very least, that and getting help for Edward took priority in my mind.

I thought about calling Exal and seeing if she could somehow work us into the ship heading for the human’s home, but I knew it was going to be a long conversation of trying to work it out.

It seemed like the coffee was going to take some time to brew, I used my contacts and found the one for Exal that I had to use while travelling Avor and called her. I thought it would be best to find out of it was at all possible to get multiple people on board.

It rang for a few seconds before it picked up.

“Hello?” I heard the familiar voice sounding a little confused.

“Hi Exal, It’s Breeve.”

“Oh Breeve, hi, how are you?” The tone became familiar as she recognised me.

“Nothing much, just the usual working and all that.”

“That’s good to hear, the last time I heard about you was when you were assigned to Tellus on a permanent basis. I had to set it up for you since you wanted to be close to your friends. How are they?” She asked.

“They’re alright, for the most part.”

“’For the most part? That doesn’t sound good, what happened?”

“It’s Edward he’s still dealing with what happened to him, I was meaning to ask a favour if it’s possible.” I hesitated a little when I said favour, I had already asked for one when I was put here but, I knew it needed to be done.

“Am I going to like the sound of this favour? Considering you brought up our human who was kidnapped.”

“It’s nothing too big, it’s just…” Not being able to continue the sentence, my tongue deciding not to function.

“Come on, spit it out already.”

“That, we were thinking that he’d be going to Erath to get some help with his problems, but he wants to take both of us, me and Cruth I mean or he’s not going at all.” I said quickly and waited anxiously for a reply.

I’m realising how stupid this idea was, asking this of Exal again even after what had happened on Avor was a stupid idea that may even get me blacklisted and not even be able to continue my work here or maybe even sent back to Avor. Exal remained silent for a few agonising seconds before I heard her sigh.

“This is sounding familiar Breeve, last time this happened we had a kidnapped human, a corrupt guard force and the PR nightmare that came from the cover story we had to come up with. If the public found out what actually happened in Bulik, there’d be riots and probably a lot of dead Guards.” She admonished.

“I know, it’s stupid, I shouldn’t have asked.” I admitted sadly realising that I screwed this entire thing up.

“Look, I’m not saying that its impossible to do, I just don’t want the exact same thing happening again.”

“But it won’t, it’ll be the humans home world, Edward would be safe there among his people.”

“It’s not him I’m worried for, it’s you guys going. We don’t know how the humans will react to the fact we had their own people under our claws for twenty-five years. I’m worried about the Krev going there, what they’ll be facing out there. There hasn’t been a cease fire announced between SC and KC forces yet and I have no way of knowing if the Krev going will be safe or not.” She vented about the problem with the whole trip sounding as though she needed to tell someone about her problems.

The thought had already crossed my mind about what could happen, but I was willing to go through it for Edward regardless, as long as he got the help he needed. I’m sure that it would be safe enough, given the humans first interaction with aliens ended with them gaining allies.

‘Though considering what some of the miners said about us, it had me worried that we would even make it to Earth.’

“With the amount of exchange program waiting lists we have now, we’d have to double the current human population on Tellus by five to just even make a dent in the waiting list.”

“I read about it online, is it really that bad?”

“It is, we’re understaffed, over worked and frankly, not paid enough for this. Though from what I’ve heard you’ve been living with Edward for the past few months. I guess money isn’t a problem from the NDA agreement.”

“I have been working, the higher ups in the exchange told me to keep a low profile and keep things normal looking. Besides I’ve been working at the settlement office since I was stationed here, I needed something to do.”

“And not just cuddle up to your human all day.” She said knowingly.

Exal was privy to the reports both me and Cruth had to make and the memory transcripts, she probably knew everything that happened over there. I could feel my face flush from embarrassment, thinking that those transcripts are out there somewhere and who knows how many people read them.

“What?! No, I would never.” I almost shouted, I raised a claw hand to rub the side of my face realising how loud I was being.

‘Okay maybe a little part of me wanted to do that still but come on.’

“Hey, no judgment here, it’s what I would spend all day doing. Well rather be than dealing with calls from all over the Consortium wanting to know when the next batch of exchange participants would be announced.”

“I think I understand you.” I said remembering back to earlier today with the same guy asking about the waiting list. My thoughts calming down to normal from the realisation that I’d have to deal with it again soon and not thinking about snuggling up to my favourite human. “I suppose it doesn’t help that the human’s holiday is tomorrow?” I asked furthering the conversation.

“Yes, exactly. The human fad was increasing again with the holiday, now with the human home world being alive, it’s only increased tenfold.” It sounded like she was dreading tomorrow almost.

From what I had seen online there were rumours of Krev trying to smuggle themselves to Tellus. Though, with the new military presence here I would be surprised if they even got close to orbit, let alone land.

I turned around to check on the coffee pot now smelling the bitter aroma on the air and found that it had finished while I was talking. I placed the pad in the crook of my neck and held it in place with my head while I poured the coffee into the cups.

“I have to go here now, I’m sorry for bringing up the transport ship. I’ll call you again at some point to check in.” Exal remained quiet for a while, and I thought that she had hung up without me realising it. I placed the pot back leaving it for anyone else in the office and grabbed my pad again seeing that the call was still connected.

“Um, hello?” I asked.

“Screw it, I know your adamant about getting help for your friend. Leave it with me and I’ll see what I can do. Don’t get your hopes up though, I’ll call you back when I have something.”

I could hardly believe it, that Exal was willing to help me again.

“Thank you so much.” Is all I could reply with not knowing what else to say or fearing that she may renege on what she said.

“Look, I know what Edward went through wasn’t fun, not for anyone involved but if he needs help then I’ll see what I can come up with. Though I’m not sure if I’m able to or not, I’ll call back later, anyway I have to go, speak to you soon.” She said with finality and before I could reply she hung up.

Now all I had to do was wait for the call back and see if it was either good news or bad news. I was guessing that Edward was at home planning out contingencies in case things to arigh. I was adding a small amount of sugar to my own drink mixing it with a teaspoon I had found in a drawer, I washed it off and placed it back the drawer.

I clipped the pad back to my belt and grabbing both mugs started to walk back to Terly with our drinks a noticeable pep in my step as I did so. I honestly felt a bit lighter knowing that someone was also looking for a way to work us onto that ship.

“Here you are.” I said giving the mug to the Krev working next to me who smiled with glee as she drank the beverage with a sigh of relief.

“I don’t know why the humans didn’t just sell the coffee to the Federation? They could become an essential part of their society if they ever did.”

I took a drink of my own, the bittersweet taste lovely on the tongue as I drank my own. The elixir almost supernaturally making me feel a little more alert even though it was only a sip.

‘Must have been a psychological thing or something. Terly wasn’t far off with the selling coffee to the galaxy, maybe that’s how they beat the Federation.’

I placed my cup on the desk and started to grab the headset I was using when Terly decided to strike up a conversation.

“So?” She gave me a look cradling the cup in her claws.

“…What?” I asked after she didn’t speak anything just looking at me knowingly for some reason.

“Oh come on, we know you live with a human.”

“Um, how?” I wasn’t exactly secretive about living with Edward, but I never really spoke about it to anyone inside the office.

“It just normal gossip, it gets rather dull around here to be honest.”

‘Oh, I see, I might as well probe to see how much they do know.’

“I see, what else do you want to know?” I asked wanting to gauge how much she knew.

“Oh, it’s just that with the news story of both you and the human travelling to Avor together and uncovering a underground Obor smuggling ring. I was thinking that you two must have made quiet the relationship.” I can see where this is going.

The cover story was partly true and left out a lot of the details, but at least they didn’t know what had actually happened there.

“Espescially after seeing that ‘karaoke’ the human did in that bar. It was adorable the way he sang along to the music. I could even see you slumped over a table with rapt attention, like you were smitten.” She continued talking about a rather embarrassing video and terrible reminder.

“What are you insinuating?” I asked, trying to get rid of the feeling that I had messed up that night.

‘Because I did mess up.’

“Well, with you two living together after the whole ordeal, I was just thinking that there was something between the both of you.” She spoke coyly trying to get me to speak about it.

“It’s not like that; we have a purely platonic relationship is all.” I said, adding a tone of finality in it.

“What? So you don’t even get to pet him? Not smother him in hugs and kisses? Pinch his cheeks even?” I listened as her voice raised a bit before she wrapped herself in a hug before continuing, my own embarrassment increasing as well. “It’s all I could ever think about having a human living with me, they would be soooo adorable I would never want to leave the house again.” She spoke as she got lost in her own thoughts.

I could feel my cheeks warm up again from the thought that this is what people think I do when I get home. Though there were days that I just wanted to stay home and cuddle with Edward, but I knew with his trauma it wouldn’t be the best idea.

~~‘I just had to settle with the heated body pillow I had, but it would be so nice to cuddle again.’~~

“From the way you’re flushing I can take it that its true?” She said smirking bring the conversation back.

“It purely platonic, like I said. Plus, we should be treating the humans with the upmost respect now, they fought the Federation and won by themselves.” I tried deflecting the conversation away from me.

“Yeah, they probably learned of how cute the humans were and just immediately surrendered knowing they can never beat their adorableness.”

I’m starting to think that maybe this Krev is a humanophile, I’ve met a few of them when I was getting people settled into their apartments and housing units. They moved here and made humans their entire personality and only spoke well of every single one of them, bordering on the fanatical. From what I could tell about them it was a small percentage at the start who had a keen interest in what humans were that just exploded the second they were unmasked.

It creeped me out and reminded me of Larens with the way that they acted, it made me afraid for Edward if he was ever to run into one of them.

I took another sip from my mug trying to distract myself and calm down my thoughts over what Terly was saying and what my thoughts were imagining as well.

I thought that I was over the cute response I had for the primates, but apparently not. I took another sip of my drink trying to strike the thoughts from my head so I can focus on work and… not… Edward’s adorable pinchable cheeks and boopable nose.

I had to shake my head to get rid of the thought and remember why I had rang Exal in the first place to make sure he was would be able to get the help he needed.

“Is he one of the ones going back to Earth?” Terly asked this time in a serious manner instead of trying to make me embarrassed.

“I don’t know, it’s a little complicated at the moment.” I admitted.

“What is there to think about, I bet if he is, your gonna be his exchange partner and move to Earth. I can imagine it now, you walking down the street smiling like a loon at every adorable person there, it won’t be like here though, where there’s maybe a singular human for every three hundred Krev in the city.

Did she do the math on that one? I couldn’t tell off the top of my head but it seemed about right considering the size of the place. But she was wrong about me wanting to go to Earth for that reason, I just wanted to stay near Edward to make sure he’s alright. If that meant staying here indefinitely then sure, if it meant never seeing home again, I’d go with him to make sure he has the support he needs.

“Anyway, I think I should get back to work.”  I said picking up my headset again and donning it, mostly to get away from the accusations being levelled at me by my co worker. I couldn’t help flushing again and I held my head in my claws until it passed and my face began to feel normal again.

Out of the corner of my eye I could see Terly look over and smirk saying something under her breath before returning to her own work as well.

It was going to be a while before I get a call back from Exal if I ever do, so I got to distracting myself in work and picked up the line.

“Hello, is this services?” A familiar voice I heard three times before spoke, I grumbled inwardly before answering with an upbeat attitude to hide the displeasure of having to talk to this guy again.

1nar1cj,https://www.reddit.com/r/revengestories/comments/1nar1cj/taught_an_old_dog_a_new_trick/,Taught an old dog a new trick,"So I work as a merchant seaman on ocean going vessels. The boat I was working on was a 7 man tug boat that pulled barges full of cargo from the east coast of the US to Puerto Rico. I had been with the company for a FEW years at the time this happened. Well, I had been trained to fill up the BUNN coffee maker with potable water that's stored in the tanks on the vessel. That's how all the crews I had worked with for the 3 yrs prior had done things. On this trip, I was sailing with a different crew and was in the galley making a fresh pot of coffee. One of the other crewmen walked in and noticed I was getting water from the tap and asked what was I doing. I told him making coffee. He then said this particular crew always use bottled water to make the coffee. I said ok, fine, no worries. I'll use the bottled water then. The next day, we have an impromptu crew meeting where the captain and chief mate was discussing how they ordered extra gallons of water for the hitch so that bottled water could be used to make coffee, instead of water from the tap. I thought to myself, that sneaky little back biting brown-noser ran his behind up to the wheelhouse and told about me using tap water. This really pissed me off because anyone working on vessels know, when something arises and is handled cordially between the crew, **you keep it below decks** This guy didn't respect the code. So here is where my petty revenge story kicks in. For the remainder of the hitch (trip) there was a gallon jug of store bought water sitting next to the coffee pot. Every day I filled the coffee pot with the water from the jug (I didn't know if they was making note of the amount of water in the jug) and I would dump the water down the drain and refill the pot with tap water and pour it in the BUNN to make coffee. The 'snitch' later came up from our sleeping quarters and made a cup of coffee. He sat there, no s**t you guys, he actually was smacking his lips saying how tasty the coffee was. I was laughing my ass off inside. I did this **EVERY DAY OF THE TRIP** Every day, I didn't miss. Good water down the drain, tap water in the coffee machine. On the last day of our hitch as we was coming in to port, the snitch was sitting at the galley table, and I asked him has he ever heard the saying, ""you can't teach an old dog a new trick""? He said yeah, why? I then told him how that saying wasn't completely true because you can indeed teach an old dog a new trick. He asked me to explain. I told him, ""yeah you old dog, I taught you and everyone else a new trick. All of y'all have been drinking tap water this whole trip and didn't even know it. You sat your ass up there smacking ya lips and trying to be funny, when the joke was on you. Next time you and a crew member have a conversation keep things below decks. You tried to made me look bad, and only made yourself look foolish."" He couldn't say nothing, just sat there looking like the clown he was.

1nar0pu,https://www.reddit.com/r/ptsd/comments/1nar0pu/cptsdhow_to_experience_pleasure_again/,c-ptsd...how to experience pleasure again?,"Hello all. Diagnosed with c-ptsd last year. Work has been in conflict zones for over a decade, will stop there. Making a slow transition back to the ""normal world""- i.e. the West where conflict is not active. Have been in intense therapy, with great psychologists and psychiatrists I love and feel lucky to have. To cope with my stress before I came to terms with condition, I was taking large mg of meds- mostly benzos. Not in an addictive manner, but to cope with war, stress, job. 

I had been on the same dose for many years, but a psychiatrist last year tried to change one med from the other so I could taper, and then I was called off to another conflict zone and he never told me the equivalency between the two amounts and I ended up going up to a high level where, frankly, upon reflection, I don't know how I functioned. Well, adrenaline, espresso, gym, work as coping mechanisms, but upon return to the ""real world"" those first few weeks as I began to taper, I was just mentally void without the stimulation. It is incredible what we are capable of handling. 

I've had a different psychiatrist now for almost a year. This person is easily accessible, we write back and forth regularly, I almost prefer them to my psychologist but the psychiatrist chooses not to be a psychologist, just a friend. In five months, I've tapered down from 65 per cent of my medication. It has been fine, following her advice and staying away from reddit horror stories. In addition to psychotherapy, emotions have become easier to navigate. Very strange as some major family secrets come out a few weeks ago that threw me for a loop. It was just bad timing, but I thought it would send me back. But it didn't as I realise I don't give myself enough credit for resilience and write off much of what I have done and seen as nothing whereas it is/it was not nothing.

I am just wondering... for people in similar situations-- in transition, still seeing their medical professionals, tapering meds if that's applicable: when do you experience pleasure? I don't drink much. It's not my thing. When I relax, it makes me feel like I am in danger. It is still hard to sit and read a book. Writing helps. I can watch series and films. I used to go the gym, but have had injuries. Starting PT soon, which will bring some endorphins back. I walk a lot and do cardio. But my docs recommend I focus not only on my mental and physical rejuvenation or building my life (I've been moving around the world for years, but have been in the same country for the last 3 years and am an immigrant), but also on pleasure and enjoying the things the world has to offer. 

I don't really know how to experience pleasure. I do, of course, know the things I enjoy. Coffee. The idea of reading a good book. Times with friends. Music. My med taper means I am still somewhat sedated, but not to the point where I was before. I have always been better at being too busy with three coffees and a long to do list with three planes to catch and drones and missile attacks than sitting in my flat ""experiencing pleasure"".

Reading books, listening to a podcast, writing, cooking, even going on dates or having some casual hooks ups if I feel so obliged. All are hard for me. But at what point do you just through yourself out there? And whilst on a date, not have to mention your past? As it usually comes up in some context when you are exchanging info about yourself with someone on a date.

My support team are delightful as we agree this is all a spectrum, and that to pathologise is not the solution. I am grateful for that. I think it is also because I am originally from North America, but my doctors here do not moralise me in a puritanical form that I feel some doctors would there? Just my experience.

Regardless, how long did it take you to do what I am describing above? As of now, my goal is to continue trying to make peace with the past and to continue my taper. Not escape it. What is done is done. Intellectually, I get it, but emotionally it is something else. I just want to start living again. 

Thank you. And sending the best to everyone out there struggling. This is not easy. But you can do it. By definition, we are resilient people. That is a powerful attribute. :)",1,1757245315.0,ptsd,1,1.0,False

1naqyfc,https://www.reddit.com/r/mounjaroIreland/comments/1naqyfc/weekly_weigh_in_20/,Weekly Weigh In 20,"So this week I weigh 215.8lbs for a loss of 0.8lbs for the week and a total of 56.2lbs. It gets me over the 4st mark. 

This was my last official week of my 12.5mg pen. I GD'd today. It was my first time doing a GD. 

This week went well I think. Suppression was lowish this week. A three to four all week. With that side effects were also low. 

I was still in a good calorie deficit bar yesterday. Regardless, going by my recent calorie counting trajectory I should have shifted a couple of pounds but I didn't. Not sure why.
I theorize maybe a change in the creatine type I take, to what I'm told is a better one. 
Despite getting crow gym lifting in, my steps were well down on the week too. A lot of driving around and flying about with the school runs back. I have managed to link my steps app up to my nutracheck app. I hope it's able to give some more data. 

Crow gym went well but have finally managed to tweak something in my back and it's very sore now to do anything walking related. Hopefully it will recover soon. Crow gym routine has changed some what in both exercise duration and in days off. Will see how it goes this week. The weights are increasing in size. To the detriment of my back!

Food noise was up a bit too but will power was able to handle it. I'd just say to myself, I don't need it. I don't want it. Stick with the plan. 
This is easy for junk and sweets in shops, biscuits and treats. The old vices. It gets trickier being hungry, knowing my calorie allowance for the day is almost gone and wanting to eat something like tuna or fruit or dinner left overs at home. 
Suppression can be, in my opinion, still hard to quantify. It's subtle. It's changing your brain functions subconsciously. Sometimes I 'feel' like it's not working. But the evidence proves otherwise. It might not change how I feel physically in the low supression numbers but it still makes me stronger in my choices and assists will power. It's never totally off I don't think. 

For the second half of the week I put in some effort to get my calories down. However I was at a wedding in another city yesterday. With work and family commitments, I just flew out for it yesterday morning, then back home again this morning on the first flight out after about 3 hours sleep each night. I avoided alcohol, canapes (which was always a favourite of mine), the dessert and only had a sensible portion of the meal. I still broke my calorie goal for the day but nothing wild. Hanging around in the city solo earlier in the day, grabbing a coffee and a snack here and there was my vice. Walking was restricted due to sore back. Few old friends commented on weight. Just saying im looking slim and well. Not helped by me wearing my suit that doesn't really fit anymore. 

So this week I will see how the G Dose goes. 
I will try to get some more lbs shifted. Get my steps up. I can't see it happening though! I'm solo parenting for most of the week. 

But we can do this!

	•	Meat, eggs and salad for lunch and dinner.
	•	Zero sugar. Not even once.

1naqxkt,https://www.reddit.com/r/GlitchPicks/comments/1naqxkt/should_you_trust_the_best_wireless_inkjet_printer/,Should You Trust the Best Wireless Inkjet Printer HP 7255e Review,"Testing the HP ENVY Inspire 7255e has genuinely been a mixed bag of surprises, functionality, and a few quirks. As someone who prints, scans, and occasionally dabbles in some creative photo projects, I put this color thermal inkjet printer through the wringer over the past month. From school assignments for my kids to those last-minute office reports that just couldn’t wait, this device had its time to shine—and sometimes falter. Here's an honest breakdown.

**Design and Build Quality**  
The compact and sleek design of the HP ENVY Inspire 7255e makes it a great fit for a busy household. Its dimensions, at just over 18 inches wide and less than 8 inches tall, mean it doesn’t hog too much desk space. I even managed to fit it snugly in a corner of our home office without it being an eyesore. The touchscreen interface is sufficiently intuitive, with capacitive functionality that’s both responsive and smooth to navigate, even if I had a coffee cup in one hand and was fumbling with the printer settings with the other. One thing I appreciated was the thoughtful dual-tray system that allowed for easier loading of both standard paper and photo paper simultaneously.

**Ease of Setup and Connectivity**  
Setting it up was a breeze, at least after wrestling with the usual initial hurdles of any new tech. The HP Smart App guided me through the setup process without much issue—although I must admit, the mandatory HP account setup felt a touch intrusive. For someone like my dad, who occasionally comes over to print things and isn’t the most tech-savvy, I imagine this could have thrown him off. That said, once connected, the self-healing Wi-Fi feature worked better than anticipated. It automatically reconnected even when I intentionally disrupted the network to test its reliability.

**Highlights**  
- Printing vivid photos was genuinely a highlight. The 4800 x 1200 dpi color resolution lived up to the hype, making holiday snaps and my kids’ artwork look frame-worthy.  
- Integration with Apple AirPrint and other devices like laptops and smartphones kept the workflow seamless.  
- Dual-sided printing came in handy for reducing paper waste.  
- HP’s initiative to use recycled plastic earned some brownie points for sustainability enthusiasts like myself.

[Check HP ENVY Inspire 7255e price on Amazon.](https://multipowers.com/p/b09ns5hdwy/)

**Performance**  
Efficiency is where this printer both excels and frustrates. For black-and-white documents, the print speed managed a solid 13 pages per minute, which is more than enough for most home users. However, color printing slowed down noticeably—at about 10 pages per minute—which was okay given the overall vibrant output quality. However, I noted that photo printing, while exceptional in quality, took longer than expected for anything larger than 4x6 inches. This isn’t a dealbreaker but serves as something worth considering if you're printing batches of family albums.  

On the scanning and copying front, the results were satisfactory, but certainly not flawless. Flatbed scanning produced excellent reproductions for flat documents or photos. However, for bulkier items like books, I found myself fidgeting a lot to get clean scans. The maximum input capacity of 125 sheets was decent, even for some of my office runs.

**Good Points**  
- Mobile integration with the app added convenience for printing documents on the go.  
- Vibrant and true-to-phone quality photos struck a chord with me, especially when paired with HP's glossy photo paper options.  
- Eco-conscious users will appreciate the energy-efficient consumption of 14 watts.  

**Negatives**  
While there’s much to love, there were definitely quirks:  
- Instant Ink service sounds convenient, but locking yourself into HP’s cartridges might feel restrictive for long-term use.  
- Mandatory HP account and always-online requirements aren’t for everyone.  
- A few connectivity hiccups with non-HP apps like Mopria surfaced during testing.

**Competing Brands**  
Comparing it to the Canon PIXMA TR8620a and Epson EcoTank ET-3850, I discovered some interesting contrasts. The Canon model, for instance, excels in photo quality straight out of the box without needing any subscription services. Meanwhile, the Epson option kills it on cost-efficiency, especially for those who print lots of black-and-white documents, given that it sidesteps the constant need for cartridge replacements with its tank refill system. However, HP’s detailed color accuracy for professional-looking photos edges out the competition in this aspect. The self-healing Wi-Fi alone set it apart compared to some occasional connectivity dropouts I’ve had with competitors.

**Price Worthiness**  
This product surprisingly straddles the line between budget-friendly and premium pricing. For homes looking for a reliable all-in-one printer, it offers a robust set of features. That said, buyers should weigh the long-term cost of Instant Ink service when budgeting. I still think the value of its vibrant printing capabilities and user-friendly app make it a compelling option if photo printing or professional-quality output is high on your priority list.

I’m in that in between where I’m able to mask heavily with my family and acquaintances, come up with plausible excuses for things like not staying out late (eg ‘I have to get up early tomorrow’ or whatever. I manage in group situations in short bursts by trying to be the inquisitor and tell ‘safe’ anecdotes and so on.

But I am autistic enough that I don’t get invited to things. Mostly recently, my cousin’s hen weekend, despite the other cousins being invited. I wasn’t even told about it, I found out by accident at the start of the year.

It’s a funny thing because I know it’s not something I would have liked, but I do appreciate at least getting a polite invite. My last cousin to get married invited me to her hen night - even though she knew it wasn’t my thing, and I did appreciate that.

Obviously what I’d appreciate more is for them to adjust elements of the weekend so that I’d be able to enjoy even some of it, but I know that’s unrealistic.

Anyways, it’s this weekend and when I contacted one of my cousins for a coffee she just said she was away. It just really hurts? 

The wedding is around the corner and I’ve separately been really anxious about it mainly because of outfits. I only ever wear different versions of the same two outfits in different colours and I just don’t do formal wear. I’m trying to find subtle ways to upgrade my style and it just hurts as well because I know whatever I do it’s going to be seen as not trying hard enough.

I have seriously considered just not going, but at this stage I’ve skipped so many big life events for this same reason and I want to go for my own reasons.

One of the other reasons I want to not skip it is out of respect. But tbh by the same token, I am not really feeling the respect this weekend.",6,1757244979.0,autism,1,1.0,False

We need help with our extension please. It's 5.5mx 5.5m. We used to have a big, rectangular solid oak table where the changing unit is now, but it was taking up a lot of space and blocked a lot of light. We're going to get a smaller (extendable) oval table soon. 

We have 2 kids (3 and 1) and so it needs to be a ""family"" space. But at the same time we want it to be nice. A cabinet maybe for the coffee machine (coffee station). The kids kitchen is likely to be around for a few more years, but the changing unit will be going in the coming weeks.

I love a beach hol but I have always gone to the bar on the way back from the beach and sat there with a couple of drinks and my partner, before going for dinner.It was so ingrained that I did panic, thinking all holidays are built around this ritual. 

I knew I wouldn’t drink as I really don’t want to but I was really freaking out about whether I’d ruin that time for my partner and what would we do in the evenings. 

My partner can have a couple of drinks and leave it. I mainly could too on holidays because I do like being up early and on the beach, so I’d say my holiday drinking was never really problematic apart from last year I had one awful hangover one day. 

Anyway, I did what I always do. Each morning I pledged IWNDWYT, I went to the beach, I was awake all day (!) normally I slumber on that sunbed but no, I was in the sea, and read loads of books. 

At the dreaded 5pm -7pm slot I had water, a Fanta, AF beer, mango milkshakes, ice coffees, virgin mojitos, it didn’t matter, it wasn’t alcohol. I still enjoyed the views , the warm evening, my partner’s company. At dinner I had a large bottle sparkling water every night with dinner, I remained hydrated. 

I had a great break and I was truly relaxed , not fake relaxed for the 20 mins that alcohol gifts you before all the unpleasantness kicks in.

After setting it up and living with it for a handful of weeks, I’ve had plenty of time to put both its strengths and quirks to the test. For context, I’ve used this desk primarily in my home office setup, a cozy room that demands furniture be compact and efficient. Spoiler alert: it mostly delivered.

**The Design That Fits Almost Anywhere**

Visually, this desk offers a no-fuss, minimalist design. True to its “A-frame” name, the structure leans heavily on its straightforward silhouette, which, in my experience, helps it blend into nearly any space. Its Black/French Oak Grey finish is neutral yet modern, giving off an understated professional vibe. The size is another huge win—it doesn’t overwhelm small spaces but still manages to feel functional. I’ve squeezed this into a nook in my home office without losing elbow room. Though, if you’re someone who likes to sprawl out papers or station multiple monitors, the surface area might cramp your style.

[Check Furinno 14054BK/GYW price on Amazon.](https://verycosy.com/p/b00or1kpl2/)  

**Ease of Assembly**

Building this desk was straightforward, which is saying a lot since “easy” and “assembly” rarely go hand in hand in my book. The package includes all the necessary panels, clearly labeled hardware, and an instruction manual that—stunner!—was actually clear. While I appreciated the labeled parts, a couple of screws gave me minor trouble because they didn’t align perfectly on the first attempt. A flathead screwdriver and a bit of patience sorted me out quickly enough, so no major complaints there. Do note that assembly tools aren’t included, meaning you'll need your trusty screwdriver and maybe a hammer if needed. That said, I assembled it solo within an hour and only needed coffee breaks, not extra arms.

**Pros**

- The compact size fits perfectly in tight spaces.
- Affordable and wallet-friendly without chintzing on aesthetic appeal.  
- Strict adherence to simplicity, making it easy on the eyes and easy to clean.
- Thoughtful addition of a built-in hutch for small-item organization.  
- Sturdy enough for light work and daily office tasks.  

**Where It Falters**

Despite its merits, the Furinno desk did show a few weak links in its chain. The structure, while generally solid, may not be forgiving over time if overloaded. I’m guilty of stacking books during a few hectic days, and though the desk held steady, I wouldn’t push the 50-pound weight limit unless you really trust your handiwork with a screwdriver. 

- The particleboard build feels delicate and not as refined as pricier options.
- Small hiccups with measurements during the screw alignment process.
- It’s not customizable, so if your layout needs drawers or other storage tweaks, you’re out of luck.

**Usability Features That Shine**

Practical features definitely stand out with this desk. The attached hutch, albeit compact, has been a game-changer for my stationery clutter. A stapler, notepad, a few chargers—these all found a neat home above the main workspace, leaving me the rest of the tabletop for uninterrupted work. The surface has been quick to clean, too; a damp cloth gets rid of coffee splatters without streaking. Given its lightweight build, relocating the desk across the room didn’t give me a workout either. Overall, it’s designed with simplicity and functionality in mind.

**Competing Products**

When comparing the Simplistic A Frame desk to peers like flashier models from IKEA or Sauder, it holds its ground in affordability. For similar compact desks in this price range, you might be tempted by IKEA’s Linnmon tabletops, but those often lack the integrated hutch or come with pricier leg options. On the opposite side of the spectrum, Sauder’s offerings feature thicker materials and customizable shelves—ideal if long-term sturdiness is a priority—though keep in mind those come at a higher price tag and with bulkier builds.

**Bang for the Buck**

In all honesty, the Furinno desk lands squarely in what I’d call the “value-for-money” zone. It packs a very budget-friendly punch while serving its intended purpose with some degree of flair. If you need something basic for casual use or small spaces and don’t plan to treat it like an anvil-supporting workstation, then this little number might just work perfectly for you. I wouldn’t suggest this for a professional-grade office where durability and long-term reliability are paramount, but as part of a modest setup? Heck yes.

1naqril,https://i.redd.it/bkpll0d36qnf1.jpeg,Campo Hermoso - Pink Bourbon - Lavorazione Mossto Recirculation - Esplosione in bocca,"Oggi ho provato un caffe' a dir poco inusuale.  
E' da tempo che volevo un caffe' fuori dal comune e nell'ultimo acquisto online ho preso questo [Campo Hermoso di Gardelli](https://shop.gardellicoffee.com/coffees/778-campo-hermoso-colombia).  
E' interessante leggere che questa varietà ha una concentrazione di glucosio elevata che quindi contribuisce alla sua dolcezza. Il bello (o il brutto per chi ci lavora) e' che questa varietà va isolata dalle altre altrimenti si rischia la contaminazione con la possibilità di perdere queste caratteristiche.

A questo aggiungeteci pure la lavorazione con ricircolazione del mosto.  
In sostanza dopo la raccolta, i frutti vengono spolpati e viene lasciata molta della mucillagine ancora attaccata alla pergamena.

Quindi poi si passa alla classica fase di fermentazione anaerobica e qui a differenza del processo standard, viene periodicamente aggiunto il mosto e fatto ricircolare. Il mosto non e' altro che un succo estratto dai frutti del caffe'. Questa aggiunta amplifica la composizione aromatica.

Ho voluto provare questo caffe' con il Chemex a casa. Qui di seguito la mia **ricetta**

\- 20 grammi di caffe  
\- 400 grammi d'acqua in totale (quindi rapporto di 1:20)  
\- Step 4 dello ZP6 livellato a 0

**Preparazione**

\- Temperatura dell'acqua a 97 gradi  
\- Blooming di 30 secondi con 100 grammi d'acqua  
\- 2 minuti con il restante 300 grammi.

**Sensazioni**

All'olfatto, appena preparato, questo caffe' e' davvero assurdo. La prima sensazione e' quella di aver preparato un estratto di bubble gum. Il profumo fruttato, quasi di fragola sciroppata e' davvero intenso.

Una volta fatto raffreddare si riescono ad apprezzare anche dei sentori piu' generici di frutta tropicale con un po' di acidita' senza che questa sia invasiva.

La mia ricetta e' un puo' diluita per evitare di esser bombardati da sentori troppo forti. Quindi se volete potete ridurre il rapporto caffe' acqua.  
Per farmi del male ho voluto preparare un espresso e si', quello e' stato proprio un pugno in faccia. Non negativa come esperienza ma e' davvero una cosa fuori dal comune per l'intensita' dei sentori concentrati nel caffe'

Sicuramente non e' un caffe' da tutti i giorni ma per le domeniche spensierate in cui si vuole provare qualcosa di insolito nella più totale calma.

**""This is probably my second to last cat.""**

I asked him what he meant by that and he explained that if this kitten lives as long as his previous cats, he'll be in his mid-60s when this kitten... goes. The next cat will either outlive him or leave him too old for another cat after.

Which reminded me of something my mother once said upon getting a new clothes washing machine:

**""This thing better be my last washer for how much it cost!""**

It was indeed her last washer, she died that year.

I'm 44 and my cat is 9. I'm pretty sure I have two full cats left after him. I don't own a laundry washer. I rent. I'm pretty sure I've got about four vacuum cleaners left to go through in this life. Perhaps three mattresses. I keep mattresses way too long.

1naqjnt,https://www.reddit.com/r/CollegeAdmissionGuide/comments/1naqjnt/how_to_prepare_for_exams_while_handling/,How to Prepare for Exams While Handling Assignments,"Every student knows that stressful feeling when exams are coming up, but assignments keep piling on the desk. It feels like there just aren’t enough hours in the day. You want to do well in both, but splitting your energy between two equally important tasks isn’t easy. The truth? You don’t need some fancy strategy—just a few simple habits that actually work.

I’ll walk you through them in plain language. Nothing complicated, just steps you can use right away.

**1. Start with a “big picture” view**

Before anything else, write down your deadlines and exam dates. Don’t rely on memory—because let’s be real, our brains are already full of formulas, case studies, and lecture notes.

Once you see everything in one place, it’s easier to figure out what comes first. For example, if your economics exam is on Friday and your psychology paper isn’t due until next Tuesday, you’ll know where to put your energy first. A wall calendar, sticky notes, or even just your phone reminders work fine.

**2. Break things down (like seriously small steps)**

One big mistake is looking at an assignment as one giant task. That’s how procrastination wins. Instead, slice it into parts. For instance:

* Day 1 → Do research
* Day 2 → Write an outline
* Day 3 → Start the first draft
* Day 4 → Edit

The same works for exam prep. Revise one or two topics a day. Don’t try to cover the whole textbook in one sitting—that only leads to frustration. Think small wins, not big marathons.

**3. Don’t treat everything as “urgent”**

Here’s where most students trip up: they panic and try to do all assignments and all revision at once. You’ll burn out that way. Ask yourself a simple question: *What really needs my attention today?*

If the assignment deadline is close, finish at least part of it now. If your exam is tomorrow, revision comes first. It sounds obvious, but sometimes we just need to remind ourselves to focus on what matters most in the moment.

**4. Build a routine that actually works for you**

You don’t need to plan every second of your day. That’s exhausting. But set aside some fixed slots where you’ll study.

Maybe you’re sharper in the morning—use that time for exam revision. Save afternoons for assignment writing. In the evening, do light review or practice questions. The goal isn’t perfection, it’s consistency. Once your brain knows “okay, this is my study time,” things become smoother.

**5. Watch out for procrastination traps**

Scrolling Instagram, suddenly cleaning your room, or saying “I’ll just start tomorrow”—we’ve all been there. The easiest trick is to *just start*. Tell yourself you’ll work for 10 minutes. Usually, once you begin, you keep going.

Timers help too. The Pomodoro method (25 minutes study, 5 minutes break) is simple but effective. And hey, reward yourself after finishing something. Even a small treat works as motivation.

**6. Keep things tidy and organised**

Sounds boring, but a messy desk or scattered notes really do waste your time. Keep your textbooks, notes, and laptop in one spot so you don’t waste 15 minutes searching for a missing paper. Same for digital files—create folders for each subject so everything’s easy to find.

**7. Learn to say “no”**

During exam season, friends might invite you out, or family might expect you to join every little activity. It’s okay to say no sometimes. You’re not being rude—you’re just protecting your time. You can always hang out or celebrate later once the storm has passed.

**8. Ask for help when things feel heavy**

Let’s be honest: sometimes, even with the best planning, you can’t handle everything alone. Maybe you don’t fully get a topic, or maybe you just don’t have enough hours to finish that assignment properly. That’s when asking for help makes sense.

* Teachers are usually happy to explain concepts again.
* Studying with a classmate can save hours.
* And if assignments are eating up too much time, you can get professional help.

Websites like [getassignment.com.au](https://getassignment.com.au) give students extra support so they can focus more on studying without stressing about deadlines.

**9. Take care of your health**

Here’s something students often ignore—your brain can’t perform well if your body is exhausted. Pulling all-nighters may feel heroic, but it usually just makes you forget half of what you studied.

Try to:

* Sleep at least 6–7 hours.
* Drink water often (coffee doesn’t count).
* Eat something healthy instead of just chips or instant noodles.

Even short walks or stretching breaks help refresh your mind.

**10. Revise in smart ways**

Reading the same notes ten times isn’t real revision. Test yourself instead. Make flashcards, explain the topic out loud (even if it’s just to your wall), or do old exam papers. When you practice recall, you remember much better.

And don’t forget—you don’t need to memorise everything word for word. Focus on understanding the key concepts.

**11. permit yourself to rest**

Yes, exams and assignments are important. But so is your mental health. You don’t need to study for 12 hours straight every single day. Short breaks actually make you more productive.

So, take time to relax. Watch something funny, meditate, or just step outside for fresh air. You’ll come back sharper and less stressed.

**Wrapping it up**

Managing exams and assignments together isn’t easy, but it’s doable. The main idea is simple: plan, work in small chunks, avoid procrastination, and don’t ignore your health. Some days will go well, some might not, and that’s okay. What matters is that you keep moving forward.",1,1757243729.0,CollegeAdmissionGuide,0,1.0,False

1naqjfe,https://www.reddit.com/r/CustomerSuccess/comments/1naqjfe/friendly_reminder_your_manager_doesnt_own_your/,Friendly reminder: your manager doesn't own your career path.,"Ever felt like your boss is the gatekeeper to your entire future at a company? I watched a coworker go through a situation recently that's a masterclass in why that isn't always true.

This guy I know works in a massive corporation, hired into the Marketing department. He was a decent performer, you know? In a department with maybe 70 people in his role, he was solidly in the top 25. Good, but not exactly setting the world on fire.

Anyway, he got really interested in what the Product Development team was doing. He had a background in user experience that was being totally wasted in his current role, but it would have been perfect for Product Dev. He was even willing to take what was basically a lateral move, maybe even a slight pay cut, just to do work he was more passionate about.

He brought it up with his manager, hoping to get some support for an internal transfer. His manager basically patted him on the head and said something like, ""let's focus on hitting your current targets."" Totally dismissive.

So, my coworker went to HR. Not to complain, but to advocate for himself. He laid out his case, explained why his skills were a better match for the other team, and showed he was serious about it. HR was surprisingly helpful. They set up a coffee chat with one of the team leads over in Product Development.

Long story short, they totally agreed he was a perfect fit. His old manager was a bit sour about it for a couple of weeks, but he got over it. Now my coworker is so much more engaged, and at the end of the day, the company kept a valuable employee from probably leaving altogether. It was a win-win for everyone except one manager's ego.",0,1757243704.0,CustomerSuccess,1,0.5,False

1naqipx,https://www.reddit.com/r/decaf/comments/1naqipx/hopped_back_on_the_coffee_train/,Hopped Back on the Coffee Train,"
I quit drinking coffee for eight months and ended up back on the coffee train back in June, I believe. It started as ""I will only have it once a week"" and then of course that turns into every day for me. All of my symptoms came back- a destroyed stomach, joint and ligament inflammation. (Side note- I am still healing from mold illness and now have MCAS, so I was drinking mold free coffee). Well, I ended up getting decaf, then coffee that was 1/3 caffeinated and still had regular caff beans around. I was making cold brew concentrate with all three beans, but using less of the full caff. My stomach has been wrecked all summer, but do I stop drinking coffee? Absolutely not! We go on a three week trip to visit family up north, a nice twenty hour drive! Then two weeks later head to the Midwest to visit more family for a week, then head back to Texas. 

The trip, especially the driving part along with the coffee, must have jacked the shit out of my cortisol. I put on about eight pounds of water weight! No joke. And I ate normally on my trip as well, cooking almost every meal. (Stayed with my mom for two weeks and then rented a cabin in Wisconsin). I realized coffee caused an insane amount of water retention for me! 

I switched to green tea yesterday and literally dropped four pounds of water weight. I am sure I had been retaining water from the stress of the trip and the coffee, even though there may have only been 40mg of caffeine in the amount I was drinking. So I have switched to some great fall flavored green tea and then onto the fall blends of caffeine free tea, which is a rooibos or honey bush. 

But just came here for some support! Last year, I realized the high amount of caffeine I was consuming, actually caused an alopecia spot for me on my head. That one is the one that had me to stopping coffee for eight months, all for me to jump back onto it. I feel so stupid for giving into it again. ",2,1757243634.0,decaf,1,1.0,False

1naqeqc,https://www.reddit.com/r/stories/comments/1naqeqc/i_think_my_instagram_is_posessed/,I Think my Instagram is Posessed,"Look, we’ve all fallen into the social media trap of doom scrolling, sometimes maybe even for hours on end. We as a human species have reached a point in our timeline where every ounce of our day could be consumed by the small computer that we each conceal in our pockets. I’m no different than anyone else; I, too, have succumbed to this trap on multiple occasions, too many to even count.  But there’s something evil within these apps. I don’t know what it is or how it works. Hell, this may be a demon designated to me alone. Or an AI, who knows at this point? All I know is the other night, I was lying in bed after a long day's work, trying to unwind and scroll some reels.

Everything was normal for the first hour or so; the usual car accidents, shitposts, and memes. However, as I fell deeper into the doomscrolling, I came across a video that just showed…me..? Sitting at the dinner table with my brother and parents. The table was set beautifully, and my mother had prepared a nice meal of what seemed to be meatloaf, a meal she had never cooked before.

I was completely stunned. I couldn’t believe what I was seeing, and the video went on for 10 straight minutes, just showing us as we ate quietly. Once every plate was cleaned, and we all started to get up to walk away, the video restarted back to the beginning. I rushed to my parents’ room to show them what I’d found, but by the time I got there, the feed had refreshed entirely.

I mean, how do you even explain that to someone, “hey, I just saw us eating dinner on Instagram, that’s probably something to look out for,” like what?  No. Luckily, though, I had remembered the username. I typed user.44603380 into the Instagram search bar, and only one account popped up. When I clicked on it, I was baffled to find that there were no posts made at all, just a blank page. However, there was one clear sign of evidence that I was looking in the right place: the profile picture. See, this account had zero followers, zero following, and everything about the page looked grey and new. Everything except for the profile picture, which was me, yet again, staring into the camera for a photo I did not take. My face was soulless and hollow. Barely maintaining the essence of a human.

This was clear evidence, though, and I ran to show my parents again. I was profoundly disappointed when both my mom and dad insisted that it had to be one of my friends playing some kind of prank on me. I don’t know why I expected either of them to understand. I mean, they’re parents, what do they know about social media? Nevertheless, I reported the account for pretending to be someone else, and by the next morning, it had been taken down. Relieved, I went to work with warmth in my chest. When I got home, I repeated the process. Kicked my shoes off, plopped down on the bed, and began scrolling. This time, a good quarter of what I saw was me, posted from different, all-new accounts. None of the videos were actually me; they all captured me doing things that I had never once done. Walking a dog I never had, browsing at a library I’d never seen before, all taken from obscure angles like the person behind the camera was hiding. Thoroughly creeped out, I reported every single page I came across. It totaled up to something like 30 different accounts, all dedicated to me, and I got the notification when each one had been taken down. I decided to take a break from the reels after that, putting my phone away in a drawer and going outside for some fresh air. I actually didn’t even pick up my phone again until it was time for work the next day. When I did, a notification was displayed across the screen. I had been informed that my Instagram account had been taken down for “pretending to be someone else.”

I didn’t know what to do, so I sent an appeal to Instagram and just went to work, albeit a little on edge. When I got off, I was astounded to find that my appeal had been rejected and that it would take 30 days before I could launch a new one. Whatever, right, but I had a real problem going on, I couldn’t just not watch as it unfolded. I set up a basic new account and started scrolling. It didn’t take long before I found myself again. Getting coffee, stopping off for gas, interacting with people I’d never met. Eventually, that’s all that my new page consisted of: just videos of me every time I scrolled. There were now too many accounts to report all with that same random string of numbers username. As I scrolled, the videos changed. I was no longer out doing the mundane. I was now walking down the road in every video. Walking down a road that I recognized as the one just before my actual neighborhood. Then it was in my driveway, then at my doorstep, then, as if nothing happened, back to the regular Instagram feed. Puppies, nature, advertisements.

All the accounts were gone. All the videos were gone. And I felt like I was going crazy. I tossed my phone to the side and just lay in my bed, staring up at the ceiling. I drifted off into deep thought, which eventually turned into sleep. When I awoke, I went through my normal process: getting dressed, making the bed, you know the deal. When I checked my phone, I stood utterly horrified as hundreds of videos showed up, all with thousands of views, all showing the third-person perspective of me murdering my parents. I basically exploded out of my bedroom door to find the walls coated in blood, so much so that it appeared the walls were leaking with the crimson liquid. The smell of iron radiated throughout the entire house, and when I entered my parents' bedroom, I found them sprawled across the bed, stab wounds decorating their bare torsos. Instagram still pulled up on my device, I heard as police sirens came flooding in through the phone's speakers. When I raised the screen to my face, I saw myself, standing over my parents' bed, cellphone in hand.

A mixture of confusion, desperation, and terror plastered across my face. That’s when the room began to flash red and blue as police lights came pouring in through the bedroom windows. A loud pounding came from the front door before it flew open and splintered as an armed SWAT unit came rushing in, rifles trained on me. They pinned me to the floor, and my phone went flying from my hand, bouncing across the floor and landing propped up against the wall. The last thing I saw on the feed was me being handcuffed before it refreshed back to the kittens and baking recipes. I was brought in for questioning, and my lawyer insisted I plead insanity. I’m writing this from a holding cell in a notebook, and I plan to have my lawyer publish it and send it out to wherever he can.

Please, you all have to believe me: I did not cause this. I did not hurt them.",1,1757243245.0,stories,3,1.0,False
1naqe51,https://i.redd.it/jtj5ckn66qnf1.jpeg,After School Cereal,"This was inspired by the @onesipclub (IG)  milk punch: ""Don't Hit Snooze"". That cocktail uses cachaça, italicus, coffee syrup, lemon and cinnamon toast crunch infused milk. I was really excited about that because Cinnamon Toast Crunch is my all time favorite cereal, I had it everyday after coming home from school.

When I made his drink it was really good, but I felt like the cinnamon toast crunch was lost in the herbal and citrus flavors from the cachaça and italicus. So I switched out some ingredients and made my version: Afterschool Cereal. It is still a milk punch- but uses flavors more loyal to the cereal.

After School Cereal (2-3 servings)
4oz dark rum
2oz Licor 43
2oz cinnamon brown sugar syrup
1oz lemon
4oz Cinnamon Toast Crunch infused milk

I started by letting the cereal infuse into ~8oz+ of whole milk for about 30mins, then straining out the large solids. Measure out 4oz and pour into a mason jar.
Stir the rum, licor 43, syrup and lemon juice together in a mixing glass. Then pour into the mason jar over the milk. Let sit for 2hrs in the fridge, stir every 30mins. The milk should be curdled by now. Strain through a coffee filter. The first few drops are going to be cloudy, so you can remove that. Serve over a clear ice cube, garnish with a cereal piece.

In the end I felt my version was faithful to the cereal, it's a sweet milk punch with a cinnamon bite. Next version I may tweak some things, try bourbon instead of rum etc. If you try this, I hope you enjoy it! Cheers.",10,1757243184.0,cocktails,0,0.92,False

I was just sitting there with my cappuccino when she walked in. Saree, loose hair, bangles that had their own rhythm… and suddenly the whole café felt like a movie scene.

There’s something about a saree in such a casual place  it’s not just elegance, it’s confidence. She carried it effortlessly, like she didn’t even know how many heads she turned. But I noticed every little detail  the way her hair kept falling across her face, the soft sound of those bangles when she lifted her cup.

I don’t know if she saw me staring (probably did 😅), but that few minutes felt unforgettable. If you’re reading this yeah, you in the saree at True Black  just know you made Film Nagar feel like it had its own soundtrack yesterday.

For a second, I thought maybe I was just overthinking… maybe the smile wasn’t for me, maybe I was just a background extra. But then our eyes met, and I knew — she wasn’t his girl. She was mine. At least in that moment, the whole café knew it too........",0,1757243120.0,hyderabad,16,0.5,False

I’ve made sure you noticed me. I found excuses to go to the back: candies, tissue, alcohol, coffee. I even drank so much water just to walk there again that I ended up peeing like crazy. I slowed down at the door so we’d walk out together when it’s time to go home. Every glance, every step, every small excuse… all of that was me making it clear.

Then came that moment when Dr. Alcantara joked about sponsoring a hotel and dates if someone finds a relationship during review. I immediately looked at you, and for a second I felt happy and motivated. Not for the prize, but for the thought that maybe something real could grow out of this season.

But now surgery is over, IM is online, and all that’s left is final coaching. I’ve already made it obvious. The rest is up to you 👀 Make these last days unforgettable before we walk out of here as doctors.

I don’t have diabetic insipidus, but just to look at you, I’d take polydipsia and polyuria any day.💧🚽",11,1757243040.0,ExpertMDph,0,1.0,False

The symptoms disappear as the day goes on and I feel very good and energetic in the evening, but as soon as I wake up, the emptiness takes over.

I can feel this emptiness in my chest like it's something from there.

Anyone experiencing something similar? What should I do?

Mornings used to be my favourite part of the day like it used to be so calm and serene, just enjoying a good cup of coffee and listening to music, but now it feels like a burden.",2,1757243018.0,mentalhealth,2,1.0,False

Like, what if every time we thought about someone, they could actually hear it, like a quiet echo in their mind? I was sitting in my usjal coffee spot today—it’s become a bit of a hait, I guess—and this thought popped in. 

I know it sounds wild, but can you imagine how different life would be if we could unintentionally send those fleeting, rajdom thoughts to others? Like, every time you loooked at someone on the bus and thought, 'I wonder if they like rainy days too,' they'd suddenly get a soft whisper of your curiosity, idk. It would probably make me hyper-aware of what I’m thinking aout people. But then, maybe it’d bring us closer?... Or just suepr awksard.

I’m probably overthinking thibgs, been known to do that a bit. Just a litlte letter to no one and everyone, playing with the idea of how our thoughts connect us in the weiddest ways. Anyway, if you’re this deep in, thanks for reading through my odd little daydream. 😊",6,1757242775.0,dearUnknowns,0,1.0,False

- I usually feel pretty rested and good throughout the day unless I get less than 4 hrs. sometimes I wonder if I just need less sleep but it seems like there’s a lot of research that this is very unhealthy(?)


- sometimes I can go back to sleep but it takes about 2 hours and then I still wake up at about 6:30
- I fall asleep at night very easily and can fall asleep during the day very easily (I have always been like this) 
- I read circadian code and tried the 12 hours of eating rhythm and if anything my sleep got worse (waking up before 3:30)
- I do sleep well camping- I can sleep in
- I go to sleep consistently at 10:30
- I get a lot of exercise and sunlight every day
- I saw a sleep dr a few years ago and she said it was anxiety - sometimes I feel anxious but it doesn’t typically seem related with being busy or anxious although I do think it’s a factor. 
-My guess is that being able to start my day and get stuff done is the culprit. I work from home and can start work at any time but it happens on weekends and days I’m not busy as well.
- I don’t drink alcohol often
- I cut off coffee at around 2

1naq80i,https://www.reddit.com/r/weyler/comments/1naq80i/why_i_ship_wyler/,Why I ship wyler,"I don't like to get into ship wars but the difference in the romantic treatment Wednesday receives from Tyler v/s the platonic treatment she receives from Enid is very stark and is why I will never be able to ship anything other than wyler.

I can't ignore the fact that Tyler made sure her _dead_ flowers were wrapped in black and white and that the note was also black and white because he knows she has an allergy but Enid drank a coffee with colorful syrups, didn't take her anti-allergic meds and wore bright colored clothing while smiling and dancing to humiliate her in front of the entire school because she thought Wednesday was _lying_ to maintain her ""tragic, lonely goth girl aesthetic"". 

(Honestly, I find that description of Wednesday very humiliating, and personally, I would never speak that way about my friends and that too behind their back. But i do like Enid and Wednesday's friendship so I'm willing to overlook it.)

Enid did all of that when she was on good terms with Wednesday and then when she was a little mad at her.

Tyler did all of that for her while he wanted to **kill her.**

In s1 the difference is even more stark, he and Xavier are romantically interested in her, so they treat her boundaries differently than Enid does. For her birthday, Xavier designed a Gothic cake, and Tyler chose dark chocolate ganache because he wanted to stick to her preferences and boundaries. 

Enid... added a pink balloon.

For her birthday, Enid made her a snood which did not match her aesthetic at all but she still forced her to wear it while Tyler acknowledged that while the coffee doesn't match her aesthetic he only did it to do something special for her. 

And on their birthday dinner/date he took her to a crypt, got her favourite flower: a black dahlia, made their cutlery look like weapons, made black and white popcorn buckets, got an old fashioned film projector and tortured her for fun.

Again and again, the contrast in their relationships is shown through how Enid and Tyler treat Wednesday's boundaries and allergy. 

It's not a coincidence. It's meant to show the difference between how the platonic love between Enid and Wednesday translates to Enid pushing Wednesday's boundaries and making her try new things and grow while Tyler gives her space and comfort to be her dark self without any judgement.",17,1757242579.0,weyler,1,0.96,False

Hey everyone! So, grab your coffee or whatever gets you going ☕, because we need to chat about the elephant in the room—AI and how it can help you rake in some cash without working 24/7. Who's with me? 🙋‍♂️🙋‍♀️

Here’s the real talk: we’re living in a time where **AI isn’t just for big tech companies** anymore; it’s available to anyone with a Wi-Fi connection. If you’ve been letting your AI tools just sit there, collecting digital dust… it’s time for an intervention! 

Imagine this: You’ve got your side hustle, maybe it’s a blog, an Etsy shop, or even a YouTube channel. But between work, family, and life, it feels impossible to put in all the hours you’d like. That’s where AI comes in!

Here’s how to leverage that little digital assistant of yours and **turn your side hustle into passive income**:

- **Content Creation Made Easy**: Use AI tools like ChatGPT to help whip up blog posts, social media captions, or even product descriptions. Think about it—if you could automate even half of your writing, how much more content could you produce? 🤔

- **Customer Engagement**: Ever feel overwhelmed by emails or comments? AI chatbots can help you stay engaged with your audience without sacrificing your precious time. ‘Cause let’s face it, who has hours to respond to DMs? 🙈

- **Pricing and Analytics**: Tools like DataRobot can analyze your sales data and suggest pricing strategies. Like having your own digital consultant—minus the hefty fees!

- **SEO Optimization**: Wanna boost your visibility? AI tools can analyze what keywords to target, helping you climb the SEO ladder without the head-scratching technical jargon. 🚀

Here’s a thought: What if your AI could generate an online course based on your expertise? Maybe you’re great at DIY crafts, cooking, or even financial literacy. Create a course, let the AI do some marketing, and just watch the income trickle in. Passive income, baby! 

But wait… don’t throw everything at AI just yet. Here are a few **quick dos and don’ts** to keep in mind:

**Dos:**
- Embrace the learning curve. Try different tools, find what suits you best!
- Trust your instincts and sprinkle in your personal touch. Nobody wants a robot sounding like a robot. They want *you*. 
- Set realistic goals. Rome wasn’t built in a day, and neither is passive income!

**Don’ts:**
- Don’t forget to create limitations. Sometimes, less is more!
- Don’t neglect your audience. Remember why they’ve loved you in the first place and keep that connection alive. 
- And seriously, don’t think of AI as a magic pill. It’s a tool, not a replacement!

Honestly, I’m excited because this week can be a game-changer. Think about the freedom you can gain by turning your side hustle into something that works for you rather than the other way around. What would you do with your newfound time? Travel? Learn a new skill? Binge-watch your favorite show without guilt? 📺✨ 

Alright, I want to hear from you! Have you already started using AI in your hustle? What’s working and what’s not? Let’s share some tips and tricks!",1,1757242473.0,AIContentAutomators,0,1.0,False

1naq5is,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1naq5is,Tutorial How I Made My S2 Batch Freddy Dunks Look Close to Retail,"Hi guys, many of you asked me how my SB Dunks Freddys look like this, so here’s my tutorial on how I made mine look very close to retail. First, understand that there are no good reps for this shoe — the shape is totally different (heel, tongue, etc.). Reps will never be retail, so you need to do something to make the shoe look closer to the retail version, and here’s how.

The best batch for this shoe is S2 Batch — you won’t find better. I simply followed some instructions on YouTube, and this was the result. I put the shoe in black coffee for 24h. After that, I got a darker color like retail Freddys, but I wasn’t completely satisfied with the tone, so I boiled garlic peels, let the water cool, and then put the shoe in that water. After that, I got the color I wanted that looks like retail Freddys.

Now, for the red spots on the shoe, just use red nail polish and paint over them, then let it dry. To make the shoe look even closer to retail, take a lighter and carefully burn the shoe a bit all around. Trust me, it will look like retail. You need to play with it a bit, and you’ll get the wow effect, just like my pair.

That’s it, guys. I hope you understood this tutorial — try it, and you’ll have a crazy good shoe that will definitely bring you compliments, I’m sure. Enjoy.",15,1757242324.0,RepsneakersDogs,8,1.0,False

Chapter 1


The neon sign outside Jack’s buzzed like an angry hornet, flickering between OPEN and OPE before finally settling on PEN—which, honestly, was still accurate. The place wasn’t much to look at: a squat brick building with windows so dusty they might as well have been painted shut, wedged between Duston’s only hardware store and a defunct post office that still smelled like mothballs and regret.


Inside, the air was thick with the scent of stale beer, fried onions, and the faint, lingering ghost of cigarette smoke from back when smoking indoors was still legal. The jukebox in the corner wheezed out a half-hearted country tune, something about lost love and pickup trucks, while the ceiling fan overhead spun lazily, like it couldn’t decide whether it wanted to circulate air or just give up and fall on someone’s head.


Duston, Kansas. Population: who cares. The kind of town where the cows outnumbered the people, and the people outnumbered the brain cells after last call. I’d rolled in seven weeks ago with a duffel bag, a fake ID, and a story about being a drifter looking for honest work.


Honest work.


Good one, Raven.


Here’s the thing about Duston—it was the perfect place to disappear. A nowhere town where people minded their business just enough to not ask why a 24-year-old girl with no last name (or at least, not one she’d admit to) showed up out of nowhere and started slinging drinks at a dive bar.


I wiped down the bar with a rag that had seen better days—possibly during the Reagan administration—and tried not to think about how many germs were probably staging a mutiny on its surface.


The door creaked open, and in walked Sheriff Grady, his boots scuffing against the worn wooden floor like he owned the place. Which, in a way, he kinda did. Duston was small enough that the law and the local drunkards were practically on a first-name basis.


""Afternoon, Sheriff,"" I said, sliding a coaster his way. ""The usual?""


Grady grunted, which in Duston-speak translated to ""Yes, please, and also I’m too tired for small talk."" I poured him a double of the cheap stuff—because if there was one thing I’d learned in eight years of running, it was how to read a man’s mood by the way he sighed.


The scars on my face itched when the whiskey fumes got thick in the air. Not a real itch—more like a memory. A reminder. The kind that didn’t fade, no matter how many years passed or how many states I put between me and the bastard who put them there. I can still hear his voice, even now.


""My daughter doesn’t cower,"" he’d snarled, backhanding me hard enough to split my lip. ""You’ll learn to fight, or you’ll learn to bleed.""


I’d done both.


Most folks in Duston were polite enough not to stare. Or, if they did, they at least had the decency to wait until my back was turned.


But then there were the ones who didn’t.


Like the two assholes currently camped out at table four, nursing their third round of Bud Lights and thinking—wrongly—that I couldn’t hear them over the jukebox.


""Shame about the face,"" one muttered, his voice slurred with cheap beer and cheaper charm. ""Bet she’s got a hell of a body under that apron.""


His buddy snorted. ""Just turn her around, problem solved.""


The glass I was polishing cracked in my hand.


Not enough to shatter—just a sharp, sudden snap of stress fractures spiderwebbing through the cheap tumbler. I set it down carefully, took a slow breath through my nose, and counted to five in my head.


One. The scent of their sweat, sour with alcohol.


Two. The thud of their heartbeats, lazy and unafraid.


Three. The creak of the barstool as Joe, the owner of Jack’s, shifted, his knee cap protesting as he turned to give them a look.


Four. The low, warning growl building in my chest—one I forced back down before it could escape.


Five.


I exhaled.


Then I grabbed a fresh bottle of Jack and sauntered over to their table.


""Gentlemen,"" I said, sweet as poisoned honey, setting the bottle down between them with a thunk. ""Looks like you’re running low. On manners.""


The first guy—beefy, red-faced, with the kind of grin that made me want to rearrange his teeth—leered up at me. ""Aw, c’mon, darlin’. We’re just havin’ fun.""


""Yeah,"" I said, leaning in just enough to let the dim light catch the scars. ""Funny thing about fun—it stops being fun when the other person ain’t laughing.""


His buddy opened his mouth—probably to say something real fucking stupid—but Joe cut in before he could.


""Boys,"" he drawled, tipping his glass their way. ""I’d quit if I were you. Raven here’s got a temper, and you’re lookin’ awful flammable.""


Chapter 2


Raven’s POV


The clock hit 2 AM, and the last of the drunks stumbled out into the Duston night, leaving behind the usual aftermath—sticky floors, half-empty glasses with cigarette butts floating in them, and the lingering scent of bad decisions. I was wiping down the counter when Joe lumbered out from the back, his massive frame casting a shadow that could eclipse a small moon.


""Another shift survived, kid,"" he rumbled, voice like gravel rolling downhill. He tossed me my pay envelope—thicker than usual, like always when I pulled a double. ""You look like hell warmed over.""


""Gee, thanks, Joe,"" I deadpanned, wiping down the last of the glasses. ""You always know just what to say to make a girl feel special.""


Joe chuckled, the sound rumbling deep in his chest like distant thunder. ""Yeah, yeah. You gonna go punish yourself at the gym again, or you finally gonna get some damn sleep like a normal person?""


I shrugged, sliding the glass onto the rack. ""Gotta stay sharp. Never know when some drunk idiot’s gonna test his luck.""


Joe’s grin was all teeth. ""Ain’t that the truth. Though, between you and me, I’d pay good money to see you put Grady’s nephew through a wall one of these days.""


I snorted. ""Tempting. But I like my job. And my freedom.""


Joe waved a meaty hand. ""Eh, I’d bail you out. Long as you didn’t break anything too expensive.""


That was Joe—all bark, no bite unless you really earned it. He’s a sweet big guy, really. The kind of guy who’d toss a troublemaker out on his ass one minute and slip him a coffee and a twenty for a cab the next. The locals loved him, respected him, and—most importantly—knew better than to push him.


I grabbed my jacket from the hook behind the bar, the worn leather creaking as I shrugged it on.


""Don’t work too hard, boss,"" I tossed over my shoulder as I headed for the door.


Joe’s laughter followed me out. ""Says the kid who’s about to go lift a small car for fun. Youth is wasted on the young, I swear to God.""


The night air hit me like a slap, crisp and sharp with the scent of dust and distant rain. My boots crunched over gravel as I made my way to the parking lot, eyes scanning the shadows out of habit.


There she was—my beat-up blue pickup, rust creeping along the wheel wells like ivy, but the engine still purred like a contented cat when I needed her to. I patted the hood like an old friend. Still here. Good.


I didn’t need a getaway car in Duston. Not really. But old habits died hard, and I’d learned the hard way that running was sometimes the only option you got.


Keys in hand, I hesitated.


The gym was my cover story, and a decent one—plenty of folks lifted after work to blow off steam. But the real workout waited at Off the Rail, a dimly lit, no-frills fight club tucked behind the old rail yard.


From the outside, it looked like a run-down storage unit—which, technically, it was. But inside? Inside, it was something else.


The club’s air was thick with sweat, leather, and the sharp tang of liniment. The ring was nothing fancy—ropes, mats, and enough bloodstains in the wood to give it character. A few regulars nodded my way as I ducked through the crowd. No supernatural scents here, no magic. Just humans who liked to hit things and didn’t ask questions.


Perfect.


""Hey Raven. Late tonight.""


Said Dante, an ex-trucker.


""Had to sweet-talk my boss into letting me leave."" I rolled my shoulders, already feeling the familiar itch under my skin—the need to move, to fight.


Dante chuckled. ""Joe? Dude’s a teddy bear.""


""Yeah, a teddy bear with a felony record,"" I shot back.


He laughed, and for a second, it was easy to forget what I was. Just another fighter. Just another body in the ring.


""Yo, Raven,"" called Marty from behind the makeshift front desk,""You here to work out or just scare the newbies again?""


I smirked. ""Depends. Any fresh meat dumb enough to take me up on it tonight?""


Marty snorted. ""Nah, they wised up after last time. But Rodriguez is around. Said something about you owing him a rematch.""


Rodriguez. Now that was a fight worth sticking around for.


I jerked my chin in acknowledgment and headed toward the lockers.


I shoved my olive-green duffel inside, the kind of thing you’d see in gyms. But this wasn’t just gym gear. It’s my getaway bag.


I unzipped it just enough to check the contents, my fingers brushing against:


A fake ID under the name ""Raven Reyes"" (birthdate, hair color, and home state all wrong, but hey, I love that first name, sue me).


$3,200 in mixed bills, rubber-banded and tucked inside a rolled-up pair of socks.


A burner phone, charged but inactive.


A change of clothes—black jeans, a gray hoodie, sturdy boots.


A switchblade I’d lifted off a drunk in Wyoming.


All of it ready to go in under five seconds.


I exhaled, tension bleeding out of my shoulders. Still there. Still safe.


""You gonna stare at your bag all night, or you gonna fight?""


I didn’t jump, but it was close. Rodriguez leaned against the lockers, arms crossed, his knuckles a mess of scar tissue and fresh tape.


""Just admiring my impeccable packing skills,"" I said, slamming the locker shut. ""You here to lose again, or what?""


He grinned, all teeth. ""Nah, chica. Tonight’s the night you eat the mat.""


I rolled my shoulders, cracking my neck. ""Promises, promises.""


Chapter 3


Raven’s POV


Rodriguez took one look at me still shrugging off my jacket and jerked his chin toward the open mat space. ""You just got here. Warm up first. I’ll clear the ring.""


I smirked. ""Scared I’ll cold-cock you if you don’t give me time to loosen up?""


""Nah,"" he said, already turning away. ""Just don’t wanna hear you bitch about pulled muscles later.""


Fair enough.


I locked the locker, then headed to the open floor. The air was thick with the smell of sweat, leather wraps, and the faint metallic tang of blood from earlier bouts. The concrete walls echoed with grunts, the smack of fists on heavy bags, and the occasional burst of laughter from the regulars.


I started slow, jogging laps around the perimeter of the room, letting my body wake up. My boots scuffed against the mat, my breath evening out as my muscles warmed. By the third lap, my pulse had settled into a steady rhythm, my senses sharpening.


Then I moved to stretching.


I planted my feet wide, bending at the waist to press my palms flat against the floor, letting my hamstrings burn. My tank rode up, exposing the defined lines of my lower back, the scars there pale and jagged against my skin.


Minuets later, I finished my last stretch, rolling my shoulders as the familiar burn of warmed-up muscles settled in. Across the room, Rodriguez was clearing the center mat, shooing away a couple of rookies who looked like they’d rather watch the fight than be in one.


Marty, leaning against the chain-link fence surrounding the ring, let out a low whistle as I twisted into a deep lunge.


""Aw man,"" he sighed dramatically, pressing a hand to his chest. ""I think I fall in love with you, AGAIN, sister. I’m gonna propose to you right here, right now. Please say yes.""


I snorted, rolling my eyes as I switched legs. ""Sure, Marty. The day you can take me in a fight is the day I say yes.""


Dante, who had been wrapping his hands nearby without looking up, deadpanned, ""Guess that ain’t gonna happen in this lifetime, dude.""


Marty clutched his chest like he’d been shot. ""Damn, Raven. Cold.""


Rodriguez clapped his hands, cutting through the bullshit. ""Alright, lovebirds, break it up. You ready, Raven?""


I cracked my knuckles. ""Always.""


Rodriguez cracked his knuckles, rolling his shoulders like a bull ready to charge. The dim overhead lights of Off the Rail threw sharp shadows across the mat, turning the scuffed vinyl into a battlefield of light and dark.


""No holding back tonight, "" he said, grinning. His stance was loose, but his eyes were sharp—he’d learned the hard way that underestimating me was a mistake.


I smirked, bouncing lightly on the balls of my feet. ""Wouldn’t dream of it.""


Then we were moving.


Rodriguez came in fast, leading with a probing jab—testing my guard. I slipped it, countering with a low kick to his lead leg. Thud. Solid contact, but he barely flinched, already pivoting into a heavy right hook. I ducked, feeling the wind of his fist ruffle my hair, and fired back with a sharp elbow toward his ribs. He twisted, taking the hit on his arm instead, and shoved me back with a shoulder check.


We circled, breathing steady, eyes locked.


He feinted left, then lunged right, shooting for a takedown. I sprawled, hips low, digging my forearm into his neck to stall his momentum. For a second, we were locked in a sweaty, grunting stalemate—then I hooked a leg behind his knee and twisted, sending us both crashing to the mat.


The crowd around the pit whooped. Someone yelled, ""Fuck him up, Raven!""


Rodriguez rolled with the fall, popping back up before I could capitalize. He wiped his mouth with the back of his hand, grinning. ""Nice try.""


I flipped him off.


We went at it again, trading blows—knees, elbows, fists. I caught him with a spinning back kick to the liver; he repaid me with a clubbing overhand that made my ears ring. The rhythm was familiar, almost comforting. This wasn’t a death match, just a dance we’d done a dozen times before, each of us pushing the other to the edge without going over.


Then—smell.


A scent I hadn’t smelled in weeks hit me like a bucket of ice water.


WOLF.


I was distracted for a second.


Fun facts: when you’re in a middle of a fight, a second might as well be an hour.


Rodriguez’s fist connected with my jaw.


I hadn’t even seen it coming.


The world tilted. My knees hit the mat, the impact jolting up my spine. The crowd’s cheers turned into a muffled roar, like I was underwater.


Idiot. Never look away.

A ZS and an HS.

Minor niggles: 
1. The top of the centre console arm rest in the HS protrudes over the cup holder, which is set back because  of the massive forward section that only has the shifter and park brake yet is so high and large. Try fitting two large maccas coffees in those two holders and getting them out safely.
2. The driver seat in both does not go low enough, so fir a taller person the seeing eye that the mirror is attached to blocks off at least 20% of your vision. If the passenger sun visor is down you lose another 10%. Im not talking sky, im talking about road, traffic, lights etc.
3. Uncomfortable seats. Too narrow for fat arses.

Major annoyances:
1. The instrument panel. It's too wide and the dial speedo is on its side and is only just over half a circle from 0 to 240. Im used to 100 being around the top with around 100° extra arc on the dial. At a glance it is just too hard to read, partly the stupid size and position, but also because it hides partly behind the steering wheel and your hand. When you are using digital speedo and dare turn on cruise, set a speed or make aanyother adjustment, I lose the speedo and get the speed i have set cruise to and a graphic of the car. So now I can't see how fast im actually going so im constantly having to turn it back to digital readout.
2. In the Z, it would launch with the smallest amount of throttle, then the acceleration would drop right down. When overtaking, it would wait for three seconds before agreeing to accelerate. Even worse in the H. Even from rest sometimes it would just take ages to respond, and at other times nothing at all. I did discover it had some speed limiter setting that would take over if I hit the speed limit, but even disabling this did not stop erratic and unpredictable acceleration.  On one occasion I was driving slowly (5k) up a hill in a car park and it just suddenly dropped to zero.
3. The accelerator pedal is miles away from the kick panel, and the brake pedal is slightly left of directly under the steering column. This meant my foot almost missing the go pedal to the right a few times, and me hitting the accelerator instead of brake on two occasions. You cannot physically go from accelerator to brake and back again while leaving your heel in one spot. Ive never driven a car with such bad pedal placement.
4. It doesnt have an inbuilt hill start hold. You can turn on auto hold for every time you stop which is a pain in a car park and other situations. It could have both systems but its all or nothing.

Ever feel like you're just... going through the motions? Wake up, coffee, work, Netflix, sleep, repeat. It's so easy to fall into that autopilot mode where the days just blur together.

I've been on a mission to break that cycle, not by blowing up my whole life, but by making tiny, almost unnoticeable tweaks. It's less about a total revolution and more about *smart optimization*. The small hinges that swing big doors, you know?

Here are a few things that have made a HUGE difference for me:

*   **The First 15 Minutes Rule:** My biggest battle was with my phone. I used to wake up and immediately start scrolling, flooding my brain with notifications and news. Now, the first 15 minutes of my day are screen-free. I either stretch, journal one sentence about my goal for the day, or just stare out the window with my coffee. It sets a proactive, not reactive, tone for the entire day.

*   **""Done for the Day"" Anchor:** This one's a game-changer for work-life balance. I have a specific, small action that signals my brain the workday is OVER. For me, it's closing my laptop and immediately taking a 5-minute walk outside (even if it's just around the block). It helps me mentally clock out and be more present in the evening.

*   **Stack Your Wins:** Instead of trying to force a new habit into my day, I ""stack"" it onto something I already do consistently. For example, I wanted to read more. So now, I read for 10 minutes *while* my coffee brews. Want to practice gratitude? Think of three things you're grateful for *while* brushing your teeth. It leverages existing momentum.

But let's be real, some days the biggest hurdle isn't the routine itself, it's the mental and emotional static. All the productivity hacks in the world don't help if you're feeling overwhelmed or stuck in a negative loop. For that side of things, having a structured plan to manage your emotional state is key. When I've felt stuck, having a guide has made all the difference, and I know others have gotten great results from [this resource (affiliate link)](https://praneetbrar.com/digistore24/make-my-plan/#aff=maximizeme) for building that kind of emotional resilience.

It's all about those 1% improvements adding up over time.

However, in the free time I do have, I love to read. Its one of the few rare escapes I find in my life and the pleasure of engrossing myself in a world or character that captivates me is unlike any feeling I've felt. 

I'm looking for someone to generally chat about literature with. Someone who is enthusiastic and talktive. I find that talking about the books we read and gushing about characters and story archs helps cement our own enjoyment.

The genres I've been reading lately are definitely Sci Fi, Fantasy and Romance (I know, guilty pleasure as a guy) along with some horror on the side.

I'm open to book recommendations too as well as perhaps picking a book to read and reading it together in our own time then discussing a chapter we've read or something along those lines. In any case, a reading buddy would be greatly appreciated to help me focus, prevent a slump and captivate my passion for literature. 

I've also been interested in exploring some romantasy which is a usual change of pace from my usual liking towards more epic fantasy tales. Also, anything with dark romance related undertones with gritty character arcs and vivid storytelling.

A little about me, aside from reading I'm an avid fitness enthusiast and I keep fit and excercise pretty regularly. A healthy body makes a healthy mind, as they say. I don't typically read in public, however I'm probably not someone you'd expect to be reading on a busy train or in a tucked away coffee shop (maybe you can change that). I'm keen to talk, though I am much better at listening and offering my own thoughts instead of yapping endlessly (though if you yap, that's more than fine by me)

Long walks through nature and hiking hills with jagged paths and euphoric views are pretty much what make up my life. I love exploration and I love trying something new. 

If you're interested in chatting, feel free to reach out and I'd be more than happy to talk.",1,1757241480.0,Book_Buddies,0,1.0,False

1napx1p,https://www.reddit.com/r/mentalhealth/comments/1napx1p/weird_intrusive_thoughts/,Weird Intrusive thoughts,"Hi! 

Since a couple of months, my anxiety kinda “mutated”. I’ve been diagnosed with general anxiety disorder a year or two ago. i’m 20, with bipolar and ADD. 

Mainly, my anxiety is focused on health issues, more precisely on deadly diseases, intoxication, but also on shocking/ ingest (highly) toxic products. 
i’ve always been very afraid of shocking while swallowing pills, food, or anything without me realizing it or wanting to. (bugs/pieces of glass causing internal damages…). 

But since a few months, i experience more and more intrusive “distance contamination” thoughts. 

for example, a few weeks ago, i was drinking a beer with a friend near a river. we saw a wild rat running 3 meters away from us. i was then unable to drink again, because my brain was telling me it might be contaminated. 

Today, i was getting ready to paint. i was handling white spirit (i do oil paint). i made myself a coffee just before and it was cooling down on my second desk, a meter away from my big work bench. i went to clean my hands, cleaned up a few things here and there and took a sip of coffee to spit it out instantly. i was very afraid the white spirit contaminated my drink and would so put me in danger. i had to rinse my mouth multiple times to avoid panicking.

added to this, im also fighting intrusive thoughts about bees/ bugs and wasps. i’m always afraid to swallow them and be stung in the throat, causing total suffocation. 
it started by avoiding drinking in cans, then look 10 times each angles of a glass to be sure there’s no floating bugs. if there’s one, the drink is instantly contaminated. my hands can be too. Now i’m afraid that when i take a sip a bee/ […] goes inside of my mouth when i half open it. 

i also often fear being poisoned, by family members, friends or strangers. i got to see if the glass is clean and dry, pour the liquid myself. if someone does, i got to check them when they make the drink. i mostly avoid bars. 

i haven’t seen my psychiatrist in 1.5 months. i think i have an appointment next week. i don’t really want to take news meds, i stopped cyamemazin for my anxiety a while ago after 2 years of treatment. 

am i doomed? will it get better? is it just my anxiety? 

it’s really ruining my everyday life. 

thank yall for answering, wishing you a great day/night!

Edited my initial itinerary from the earlier post as I was still revising plans.**

**Context:** First time in Berlin (and Europe!) for my partner and I. We are history buffs, priority are for history-centric museums/attractions more than art museums/exhibitions (to each their own. Don't see the need to bash or judge another person's preference as what another Redditor did earlier.)

This trip to Berlin is like a historical classroom marathon for us and we're having slower days in Prague and Budapest after, so we're ok to try cramming a more packed itinerary for Berlin but not \*too\* crazy that it runs us down to the ground

**Food**: Excited to try local delicacies (Currywurst!) but not interested in bars/clubs for this stop

With this in mind, does the itinerary below make sense? After researching and incorporating redditors' suggestions, I tried to streamline our routes and must-sees as much as possible but I still have trouble deciding where to place certain things or which ones I \*must\* sacrifice for a more manageable itinerary

***Note***: The ""exact"" times listed below are just for a gauge, I don't plan on following them military-style but rather to use it as a yardstick to include travel time in between stops and gauge how feasible the route/rough timing is. Some additional time is taken into account in between stops to account for train delays, toilet stops, etc. Open to changes if and when needed.

**Day 1**

Morning: Arrive in Berlin

Late morning - early noon: Make way to accommodation at Friedrichshain-Kreuzberg. Grab a quick/on-the-go lunch nearby

1.30 - 2.30 PM: Make way to Check Point Charlie via the Unter den Linden route. Leisurely stroll on Unter den Linden with snacks/coffee on the go.

2.30 - 3 PM: Checkpoint Charlie

3.15 - 4 PM: Memorial to the Murdered Jews (Head to the car park south to Hitler's Bunker?)

4.15 - 4.45 PM: Brandenburg Gate

5 PM: Reach Reichstag. Chill outside while waiting for registration for Dome tour

6.15-6.30 PM: Dinner

**Day 2**

10 AM: Head to DDR Museum

10.45 AM: Reach DDR Museum. Spend about 1.5 hours here.

12+ PM - 1 PM: Grab lunch nearby

1 - 1.30 PM: Check out Humboldt Forum

1.30 PM - 6 PM: Museum Island (3-4 Museums) + Berlin Cathedral (If can fit in)

**Day 3**

9 AM - 2 PM: Sachsenhausen Memorial Tour (5 hours)

3 OR 3.30 OR 5 PM: Berlin Underworld Tour (1.5 or 2 hours) (Meeting points for Sachsenhausen tour and this tour are 15 mins away)

7 PM: Dinner

**Day 4**

10 AM: Check out East Side Gallery

11 AM: Day trip to Potsdam

\*Take the Sanssoucci + Pass

I know Day 3 is pretty packed but I really couldn't figure out another better way to split the 2 tours and those are the 2 that we really don't want to miss out on.

Looking forward to some **constructive** feedback, not unnecessary judgmental bashing. Thanks in advance.",0,1757241267.0,askberliners,10,0.2,False

I had like 12 in person interviews and let's say 5 final rounds but I was always rejected. One it was between me and the other more experienced candidate which lead me to believe that I just need to be myself and continue acting the same way on the interviews. One in my starting months it was how ambitious and potential I was and how I should apply to other roles which lead me to believe I needed to be more down to earth. One it was really hard with STAR type questions which I could have practiced a bit more but overall I performed well but was told that maybe I needed to vibe more and I had two more which were passive agressive from the interviewer side from the beginning which then lead me to believe I just need to say stuff and get in their skin. And this last one which was a coffee interview third round and I was finally happy with myself saying congrats you made it to the first third round just to be rejected again and the translated feedback was basically that I am hiding and saying stuff I don't mean and it shows on my mimics and face expression. I knew always that I was a little off like in person although I don't have any ADHD or autism diagnosed but still it hurts that someone wouldn't hire you because they sense or think that you are off. Does anyone had similar problems with this? Is it fixable? What's the best solution to this? Should I just practice more and add a flavour of my personality in between for the vibe?

hey,

about me: early 30s, working in tech in bangalore. quiet, low-drama guy who enjoys cafes, long walks, lazy sundays and real convos more than parties or small talk. into photography, 3d design and small web/homelab projects. i’ve spent the last few years focusing on skills and hobbies, so i’m new to dating but ready to try.

why i’m here: dating apps felt shallow and too hookup-heavy. most weekends i just end up scrolling, and i want to change that. i’m looking for something real, honest and slow-build.

what i’m like:

calm and thoughtful, listen more than i talk

loyal, not into drama

prefer 1 on 1 stuff: coffee/tea, parks, long walks, late night talks

creative and curious, like building/learning random skills


what i’m looking for: someone kind, emotionally mature and curious. more than that, i want a partner, not an echo.

on vibe: you don’t have to agree on everything to connect. a person is always bigger than one opinion. i value honesty and the freedom to be ourselves. i’ll respect your worldview and i’m looking for someone who’ll do the same.

if your instinct when you disagree is to shut down or dismiss, we won’t match. but if you can see the whole person and handle differences with curiosity instead of judgment, that’s what i’m after.

last thing: i’d rather hear “hey this isn’t a vibe” than deal with ghosting. clear and kind endings > confusion.

if this feels like your vibe, say hi and tell me one of these: fav cafe, ideal lazy weekend, or a song you can’t stop replaying. reply or dm, no pressure, no pics upfront.

1nappbm,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/1nappbm/my_23f_friend_34f_acts_like_a_toxic_girlfriend/,My [23F] friend [34F] acts like a toxic girlfriend,"Last year I \[23F\] became friends with Liz \[34F\] after meeting at the creative writing club of our university. Initially I thought she was super sweet, creative and very funny which is why I was more than happy to meet for coffee and become friends.

However, the first time that we met she essentially completely trauma-dumped on me about everything that has ever gone wrong in her life and also complained a ton about a friend who she’s been one-sidedly in love with for the past four years. I honestly felt pretty weirded out to be told her entire life story and had to fully console her, after that we became, what felt like to me, suddenly very close. She would constantly ask me to hang out, send me long voice memos about her complaints and worst of all, anytime we would hang out she would just complain and I felt miserable and drained. 

Now here’s the thing – I feel like Liz genuinely thinks she is entitled to know or make a choice in how I design my life and she actively complains whenever I make a choice that doesn’t please her. A few months ago, I offered to volunteer at a club that she’s started to do social media for their upcoming magazine. I was almost disowned by my parents and am unable to pursue my dream MSc post-grad which caused me to nearly be hospitalized to a mental health clinic or go on anti-depression meds. I told Liz that I don’t feel like I can do social media for their magazine after all because I’m going through a lot and need to focus on my life. They also postponed the production of the magazine so there’s no need for a social media campaign.

Liz, however, grew agitated and mad at me and told me that I was irresponsible and that what I was going through was no excuse. Around that same time I also quit my gym membership because it cost too much money and I was too depressed to work out, which I told her and she constantly made snappy or snide remarks about how she has to work out alone now or how she can’t motivate herself to go without me, she also said that I hurt her feelings by quitting my membership. I feel like I can’t say anything around her because she might use it against me or be mad at me that I prioritized something over her.

When I told Liz that my therapist recommended a stationary visit or to go on meds, she told me without blinking “I really need a stationary visit to a clinic or to go on meds. OP, I’m sure you don’t understand the pain I’m going through but I would genuinely need this.” There was not a second of “I’m sorry, that sounds hard.” or “Let me know if I can be there for you.” or even just a hug?? I swear to god at this point I feel like I’m her unpaid therapist who’s also her life coach and I have never had this many issues with any human being in my entire life.

I really don’t know what to do because I worry that if I cut contact she might harm herself but also like I can’t do this long-term. My final straw was yesterday, I’m currently writing my BA thesis and also taking my last exam in a week and a half. I suggested that we should go meet this week but I didn’t get back to her because I’m honestly so stressed out and not on my phone very often. She called me irresponsible again for not following through with our “plans” (we hadn’t made any concrete ones) and I apologized. I honestly have been so patient with her but it’s crazy to me to make one of the most stressful times in my life all about her.  

Any advice on what to do would be so helpful.

tldr; friend acts like a toxic girlfriend and wants OP to always be fully available to her and plan their life in a way that best favors her.",1,1757240606.0,relationship_advice,2,1.0,False

1naposn,https://www.reddit.com/r/u_MrStories2025/comments/1naposn/what_i_was_born_to_do/,What I was born to do!,"So my story starts out innocent enough. Later in the season last summer I bought a white long sleeved sunshirt, you know it’s important to protect yourself theses days. So on a hot day I decided to loose the bra only to be informed by my husband that it was quite see through, hard nipples, areolae, even the small mole on my left breast and he enjoyed the look. Feeling saucy, I promptly bought 2 more.

So a little bit about myself. I’m 58. Still have my reddish brown shoulder length hair, the grey has only given me a few strands so far. I’m 5’7”, 130 lbs. I eat decent, do planks, walk and genetics have played a hand too in keeping me slim. Things are quite trim and my long legs are in good shape. My boobs are a B cup which is nice, I can go braless without them hanging down to my belly button. It must be something to do with the sun shirt because when I’m wearing it my nipples are always hard as a rock. I keep my bush trimmed and tidy. Also, I have no piercings or tattoos.

Things have changed since menopause. My husband is not a pencil dick, if he was perhaps we’d still have sex. But we’re both okay with that (we did “fill our pockets” so to speak when we were younger) I still enjoy a good wank and orgasim and tittie play. My husband enjoys his wanks and I’ll just say we have added ALOT to our spank banks. So I’m not complaining about getting older, if you’re not getting older , you’re dead, so really, I’m okay with it. Just enjoying some harmless fun now.

I also want to take a moment to mention that this story is true. My husband has passed a few stories to me to read and they’re always some outrageous scene that you just know isn’t true. We were talking last night and said it’s too bad we can’t share some of these events with someone then it dawned on us we could, we could share with you. I also hope that perhaps it’s the type of story that you can share with your significant other to show that there is still fun to be had.

So back to the story. I decided to take the white sunshirt to a new level and wore it into the shower. Low and behold, it fit like a second skin. That added to my husband’s spank bank. I bought a few micro mini skirts that have the shorts attached (I promptly cut the shorts off, I am handy enough with a sewing machine.) So with the leftover shorts I made swimsuit bottoms that show a lot of cheek and they reveal excellent camel toe.

We went to the local beach, the water was on the colder side so I didn’t plan on swimming but there were four women about my age standing in the water with their bikini tops pushing up creating cleavage so I decided I better go for a swim just to let them know that a long sleeve white sun shirt isn’t boring. Needless to say the four ladies watched me leave the water as well as pretty much everybody else on the beach because coming up out of the water made it fit like it was body paint! Not to mention the swim shorts showing my cheeks and camel toe and the cold water had made the girls pop right out. We made a mental note. We now carry a spray bottle in our car to give the girls the wet look.

I’ll just take a moment here to mention that my husband has found if he walks slightly behind me, well first of all, nobody even seems to notice him , but he can also inform me when somebody’s looking. I always act innocent like I’m not trying to show anything and I never look around to check and see if people are looking, he keeps me informed. We found that a few tricks to do are for me to perhaps adjust my shoe buckle or perhaps the wind catches my sun hat and I have to grab it therefore making my skirt ride up and exposing my pussy and ass. Also bending into the trunk to “ get a pair of glasses from our prop container of empty glasses cases” puts everything on display as well. I’ll also mention that I get checked out by just as many women. And my husband says they’re even worse cause they openly stare where men have to do glances to risk not getting caught. I even had one woman followed me in the grocery store. We find it doesn’t matter if it’s a group of 25 year-old construction workers behind me in line at the coffee shop, no one ever seems to care that they just checked out a 58-year-old woman. Of course I also have on my big floppy sun hat and sunglasses so they can’t really peg my age I guess. And of course, who doesn’t enjoy a little peek!

We live in a touristy area with cottages and a lot of lakes so the summers draw a lot of people. So we found that walking amongst little shops in the towns, ice cream shops and coffee shops draw a lot of looks as well as areas where people were looking for their own kicks. There are sites for that. A lot of the lakes around here are joined by what they call locks. Some lakes are higher or lower than other lakes so to connect them boats go through these man-made channels called locks. Boats go in, the lock fills or empties of water and when the lock opens they are higher or lower to have access to the next lake. So obviously there’s a lot of people hanging around here as well as the people on the boats lined up, waiting to go through the locks.

So we fast forward to this summer. We bought a convertible that has inspired us to get out and enjoy driving around more . Also over the winter I worked on my wardrobe. I took crocheted (it’s like knitting) table cloths or doilies and because like I said I’m handy with the sewing machine I made some new skirts. These new skirts have holes throughout them that are about the size of your finger and you can clearly see a lot of skin through and perhaps some pubic hair! I’ve often wondered if there would be any problems from the police if they ever saw me wearing one of those crocheted skirts because obviously I don’t wear panties under them. That got put to the test yesterday.

We decided to go to a casino that has its own hotel. We had been out wandering around, so I hadn’t changed out of my crocheted skirt. We’re standing in line at the check-in after the valet guy had had a good look. I’m innocently looking around when I noticed a man in a uniform and I checked to see what the badge on his shirt said and low and behold it was police. We didn’t know, but the police were having a ceremony there at the hotel that night. While my husband informed me after that a young policeman, after having a couple glances, didn’t know where to look and an older policeman was behind me and after having had a glance, decided just to look out the window and pretend he hadn’t seen it. So that answered that question -apparently, I’m legal!

So before we got to the casino/hotel yesterday we wandered around at a waterfront park. We noticed a man probably about 25 years old following us. My husband said he was having a very good l look. When we stopped to take some touristy pictures we lost sight of him. Later, we saw him out on the pier which just so happened to have a perfectly position bench with nobody around. So we sat down, and I made sure that he would have a good view of my snatch when he came back. Actually, he walked around again for another pass. That alone added to our spank banks. But when we got home and were looking at our touristy pictures we realized he was in the background of one of our pictures and when we zoomed in we realized he’d had his phone held down and been doing a video as he’d been stalking me.

One of our main places to go is one of the locks I spoke of on a busy Saturday. Of course on the drive there we pass a convenience store that sells liquor so I make it a habit of running in to buy my husband a beer every weekend. While I’m in the fridge area getting the beer, I always make sure I spend a couple extra seconds there to make sure my nipples are extremely hard so when I get to the counter the fellow can enjoy the view. I’ve even checked the buckle of my shoe on the way out for him a few times too. Once we get to the locks, we of course walk around, there’s flights of stairs as well to go up and down. It was on one of these flights of stairs that my husband overheard an elderly woman laughingly saying to her husband “I don’t think she has any underwear on”. There’s also an ice cream shop nearby that has proved to be very good for people to have a good look while standing waiting. There is one picnic table in particular that we like to sit at. We always sit on the table part with our legs on the bench. The boats lineup here and they’re at just the right level that there’s been a good many person enjoyed seeing my pussy.

My husband had quasi chatted with a fellow that lives near the lock (from one of those sites I mentioned where people are looking for their own kinks) and he mentioned we were going to be there last Saturday around 2. My husband told him he would leave it up to him to be able to pick me out in the crowd if he could make it. I had on one of my thin, white sun shirts (sprayed down with water of course - the girls seemed quite at attention for today’s shenanigans) and my white, pantyless crocheted mini skirt. We enjoyed speculating “could that be him” when we got there. But then he got there and it was very obvious he had found me. We wandered around a bit with him following then we went back to our picnic table and he sat at one nearby that just so happened to be at a very good angle that I could give him several peeks (some of those peeks might of lasted a little longer than others). This encounter led to several wanks this week and even a couple sleepless nights! Damn imagination running wild!

Well, I’m gonna wrap my story up here now. My apologies if it’s been too long. I will also mention I’ve picked up quite a few sexy dresses with the intent that we are going on a Caribbean Virgin cruise this winter.

1napo1f,https://www.reddit.com/r/BlackSoldierFly/comments/1napo1f/considering_midtolarge_scale_bsf_farmingwould_it/,Considering mid-to-large scale BSF farming—would it be profitable?,"Hi everyone,

I’m exploring the idea of starting a mid-to-large scale Black Soldier Fly (BSF) farm in my country and wanted to get some insight from those with experience.

Here’s my concept:

* Source food waste from local restaurants, juice shops, coffee shops, etc. Our country doesn’t have an efficient waste management system, so we might need to collect it ourselves every day.
* Process and grow the BSF larvae at scale.
* Sell dried larvae as animal protein feed, primarily targeting trout farmers. Trout feed requires a high percentage of animal protein, and being a landlocked country, most of these protein sources are imported at very high costs.

From my research, BSF larvae seem to be a promising alternative feed source and could potentially fill a big gap in the market here.

My main questions for the community:

1. Has anyone run a BSF operation at this scale? What were the main challenges?
2. Do you think sourcing food waste daily is feasible and cost-effective?
3. Any tips for ensuring profitability when selling to aquaculture farmers, especially trout?
4. Are there hidden costs or operational issues I might not be considering for a mid-to-large scale operation?

I’d love to hear any advice, numbers, or lessons learned from your experiences. Thanks in advance!",2,1757240470.0,BlackSoldierFly,2,1.0,False
