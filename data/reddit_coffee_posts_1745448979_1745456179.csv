1k6ffvi,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1k6ffvi,I made an NES controller coffee table with hidden storage for my light guns,"I found the coffee table on facebook marketplace. It's metal with wood veneer and the top board had some moisture damage which made the MDF material swell up. I removed the top portion of the table and replaced it with a slab of pine, cut it to size, painted it, and sealed it with a few coats of polyacrylic.

I absolutely love light guns on a real CRT TV so i wanted to have a creative use of storage for them at the ready. There are many more I couldn't fit here but these are the most common ones I would use for myself and when friends come over. My inspiration from this was the scene in the Matrix when Neo says he needs lots of guns. The foam inserts i got on Amazon. They are pick and pull 16""x12""x2"" slabs that are precut in a grid pattern. You simply just pick out the shapes you want.",2,1745456067.0,gamecollecting,2,1.0,False

Here we have the Rocky Mudslide! pint 2/6 from the collection

Rating- 9.5

Pro’s- keep in mind, i’m not the biggest fan of coffee ice cream. i thought i was going to hate this. i always thought they were always way too coffee forward, terrible texture, either super sweet and fake tasting, and weird. this pint was the EXACT opposite. the coffee flavor was present in such a graceful, silky, and balanced flavor & texture. not too sweet, not too bitter. so rich and balanced, super creamy, and the mix-in’s were the biggest compliments to this ice cream. i loveeeeee cafe panna’s oreo brittle, it’s a delightful treat and i had it in every bite. the chocolate coated almonds are like crack to me. i could inhale those. i loved them in this pint entirely. the flavor of the fudge was so spot on, it was silky, evenly distributed throughout the pint as well. it was great. i’d so splurge on this pint again

Con’s- the fudge could have been a weeeeee bit thicker in consistency. but that’s just personal preference, i love goop",1,1745456041.0,icecream,0,1.0,False

Marcqwuan’s POV:

“Listen, I know I’m a mess. Honestly, I know it better than anyone else. I know what I’m doing is wrong. The right thing for me to do would be to step back, be rational, and judge from a distance—but I can’t. I love her, and I can’t picture a future without her. I don’t want to settle for a future where we’re just friends, where I spend the rest of my life wondering, What if we’d just given it a chance? What if she’s the one? What if she’s my person? And you’re right, I know it probably kills you to see me keep making the same mistakes. I might learn my lesson eventually, but right now? I don’t think it’s time for me to figure it out. I’m not gonna drag you into this mess if you don’t want to be a part of it. I went in there to cancel the date, and I just couldn’t do it. I tried, man, I really did, but at the end of the day, I just couldn’t. Honestly, I’m kinda proud of myself for not backing out. Maybe it’s a small win, but I’ll take it. Your best friend is actually going on a date after years of being a complete recluse.”

I sigh heavily into the phone, the weight of my words sinking in. I can almost hear Jaylin’s reaction through the silence.

“That’s because you’re a straight-up whore. You just swipe right on dating apps, or you run into women at the gym, or in the grocery store, or whatever. You get their number, and somehow—I still don’t get it—you take them out for boba, and fifteen minutes later, you’re fucking. So, I gotta admit, with you actually taking her on a real date, I’m definitely more okay with this than your usual casual relationships.” Jaylin’s voice crackles with disbelief through the speaker, followed by a short laugh.

“And isn’t that enough to get you to help me out with this date? I haven’t been on one in years, and I have no clue what to say or even how to talk to her,” I plead into the phone, feeling the pressure mount, a mix of nervousness and frustration. I try to imagine what it will be like—what if I mess it up?

“Bro, you two have been talking every damn day for the past three weeks. What do you mean you don’t know what to talk about?” Jaylin’s voice is almost incredulous, like I’m missing the obvious. I feel the heat creep up my neck, suddenly self-conscious.

“That’s us just catching up on the usual stuff, talking about our days, therapy sessions. This is different. This is the first time we’re actually going out together, outside of my apartment. Yeah, we’ll probably talk about therapy, but I can’t make that the whole conversation. I need to think of some other stuff to say.” I pace a little as I speak, the phone pressed against my ear, trying to get my thoughts straight.

“Alright, well, what do you usually talk about when you’re out with girls for boba? What’s your game plan?” Jaylin sounds a little smug, like he’s waiting for me to reveal some secret. His tone grates on me slightly—like he knows something I don’t.

“Honestly, bro, it’s been so long since I’ve had a ‘real’ date. But I know that eye contact is key. It’s like an automatic way to create that spark, you know? They ask me what I’m looking for. I ask them what they’re looking for. They’ll say something like, ‘I’m just a go-with-the-flow kind of girl,’ and I’ll tell them, ‘I just want to slut someone out and treat them like a princess till something happens.’ And then they look at me, all wide-eyed like, ‘Oh my God, that’s exactly what I’ve been waiting for.’ And then I’ll just say, ‘Let’s get out of here.’ After that, there’s not much talking, man. We walk to my place, and I go straight into fucking,” I say, chuckling, knowing how simple it sounds, but it’s the truth. It always works.

“Wait, are you being dead-ass with me right now?” Jaylin sounds like he’s trying to process what I just said, the shock in his voice obvious even through the phone. I wonder if he’s actually shocked, or if he’s just used to me making ridiculous claims.

“I’m completely serious. That’s the routine, man, with every woman.” I shrug, though he can’t see it, but the casualness in my tone is real. I don't even feel bad about it—this is just how things go.

“And that works every time? You’ve had success with all of them?” Jaylin’s disbelief is even clearer now, his voice rising slightly. He probably thinks I'm lying—or at least exaggerating.

“Yeah, I mean, there are some girls who want the whole dinner-and-a-movie thing, and I’ll tell them that I want something low-pressure. If things get weird, we’re not stuck. Boba or coffee allows for both of us to just bail. I’ll tell them, ‘If you don’t get it, I bounce. Simple as that,’” I say matter-of-factly, feeling a little more confident about the situation. I’ve said it enough times that it feels like second nature.

“Wait, you’ve cracked the code to dating, and now you’re asking me for advice?” Jaylin laughs, his voice full of disbelief, clearly finding this whole thing a bit ridiculous. I can't help but chuckle, too—this whole thing is pretty absurd, but I need to get it right for her.

“Bro, that’s not even real dating. That’s just hookup culture. But when it comes to an actual date, where we actually have to talk and get to know each other? That’s where I need your help. That’s your thing.” I feel the need to clarify, tapping my fingers on the table nervously as I speak. I don't want him to think I don't appreciate his advice.

“Alright, bro, first thing you need to do is get her talking about herself. Women love talking about themselves so much, they invented a word for it—‘yappers.’ Seriously, they’ll yap about anything.”

I don’t like how quick Jaylin is to call Jasmine just another woman. I know she’s not like that.

“Ask her a question, let her answer, and then try to come up with a joke based on what she says. Bonus points if you can tease her a little in a playful way. Keep the conversation going on that topic for as long as possible, until she asks you a question or you see the conversation dying down. You’re funny, so it should come easy to you. And, whatever you do, keep that eye contact to build some sexual tension.” Jaylin’s voice has a certain confidence now, like he knows exactly how it’ll play out. It’s like he’s already got the whole thing planned out in his head.

“There is absolutely no sexual tension on this date. It’s just a friendly hangout,” I emphasize, trying to sound firm, but it’s clear from my voice that I’m second-guessing myself. I just don’t want things to get complicated.

“Bro, I couldn’t pay you to keep it in your pants.” Jaylin laughs, the sound of his amusement almost contagious through the phone. I shake my head, feeling myself relax a little.

“Thanks, fam. I really appreciate it.” I laugh along, shaking my head, feeling more relaxed after hearing his familiar tone.

“You’ve got this, bro. I believe in you.” Jaylin’s voice is supportive, as always, and I can almost feel the reassurance coming through the phone.",1,1745456035.0,u_TheseMeasurement2064,0,1.0,False

<div>### Creative Uses of Horse Apples Decor in Rustic Interiors

 Embracing the charm of natural elements has become a popular trend in home design, and **horse apples decor** offers a unique twist for rustic and farmhouse-style interiors. Often overlooked, these ornamental seed pods bring a raw, earthy texture that complements wood, leather, and metal accents beautifully. The warm, neutral tones of horse apples enrich any space, making them an ideal choice for accent pieces and decorative arrangements.

### Incorporating Horse Apples in Seasonal Display Themes

 Using horse apples as part of seasonal decor adds a distinctive flair to fall and winter settings. Their rugged appearance naturally enhances autumn wreaths, table centerpieces, and mantel displays.

This approach not only highlights sustainable decorating choices but also adds an organic focal point to festive designs.

### How to Highlight Horse Apples as Statement Pieces

 To maximize the visual impact of horse apples decor, consider showcasing them in clear glass bowls or rustic wooden trays. Grouping several horse apples together can create a sculptural effect, perfect for coffee tables or sideboards. Their unique shape and texture invite touch, making them ideal conversation starters. Additionally, horse apples can be painted or lightly distressed to match specific color schemes, allowing versatile customization for any decor style.

### Benefits of Choosing Horse Apples for Eco-Friendly Decoration

 Selecting *horse apples decor* supports sustainable decorating practices due to their natural origin and biodegradability.

The Setup: Ambitious Agent, Meet Complex Cloud

A few months ago, I built a neat AI agent using LangChain that could research and summarize docs for our team. It worked great on my laptop. Naturally, we wanted to deploy it so everyone in the company could use it. Easy, right? Just throw it on AWS and call it a day.

Well, **spoiler alert**: it was *not* easy.  
I underestimated how many moving parts would be involved:

* Packaging the agent into a Docker container (half a day tweaking Dockerfiles).
* Setting up an EC2 server with the right dependencies (another day of *“it works on my machine!”* frustration).
* Exposing it as an API, securing it, managing environment variables... (lost track of time here).

By mid-week, my simple agent had ballooned into a mini DevOps project. I was writing more Terraform than Python. **The cloud infra was officially more complex than the AI agent itself.**

# Hitting the Wall: When Agents Demand DevOps

Once it *was* finally running on AWS, new issues popped up. The agent sometimes hung or crashed under load, but CloudWatch logs were as clear as mud. I'd wake up to Slack alerts at 3 AM saying *“Agent down 😢*”. Debugging meant SSH-ing into the server, tailing logs, and sacrificing a few cups of coffee to the DevOps gods.

Scaling was another adventure. A few teammates started using the agent concurrently, and performance tanked. I tried adding another server, then a load balancer… suddenly I’m managing a mini cluster for one darn AI agent! It felt like swatting flies with a sledgehammer.

At this point, I had spent **5 days** on deployment/infra for a LangChain agent that took maybe 2 days to code. The irony? The whole point of the agent was to save time for our team, yet *I* was losing a week of productivity just babysitting it in production.

# A Crazy Idea: Purpose-Built Cloud for AI Agents

Over beers (the traditional problem-solving elixir), I vented to my co-founder about how deploying this agent was far harder than building it. We joked, *“If only there was a Heroku, but for AI agents.”* That joke turned into an idea we couldn’t shake off.

Why not create a platform specifically for deploying and scaling AI agents? Something that abstracts away all the Docker/Kubernetes/server nonsense and lets you go from notebook to cloud with minimal fuss. We imagined:

* **One command deployment:** like `agentuity deploy` and boom, it's live.
* **Auto-scaling** tuned for agent workloads (spin up more instances when the agent gets busy, scale down when idle so you're not burning cash).
* **Built-in observability:** real-time logs, tracking the agent's moves, maybe even a UI to see what the agent is thinking (okay, not literally reading its mind, but close).

The more we talked, the more it sounded *actually doable*. We had both dealt with deploying ML and LLM apps before; the pain was real and common. So, instead of complaining into our beers, we wrote some code.

Jasmine's POV:

It’s been a week since my last therapy session, and everything with Marc has been… perfect. Like, *too* perfect. It feels like I’ve stepped into one of my romance novels—only this time, my book boyfriend is real, and he’s my roommate. I can’t wait to tell my therapist!

But as soon as I sit down, her expression says it all—this isn’t going to go the way I imagined.

“I’m going to recap what I just heard,” she starts, her brows slightly furrowed, voice calm but edged with concern. “We had a conversation about how it’s not the smartest idea for you to pursue a relationship with your roommate, Marc, because you’re not over Kendrick. You agreed with me on that. And then, right after our session, you tried to perform oral sex on him?”

Hearing it laid out like that feels like a slap. My face heats up instantly. “Well… when you put it like *that,* it sounds awful,” I mumble, shrinking into the couch, trying to disappear into the cushions. The shame creeps in like an unwelcome guest, heavy and suffocating.

She softens her tone, and her eyes are kind. “I’m just summarizing the events, Jasmine. That’s all.”

I sigh, realizing she’s right. It’s not like she twisted the facts—I just didn’t expect them to sound so reckless when said out loud.

“I can’t explain it,” I blurt out, hands gesturing wildly as they can somehow catch the words before they hit the air. “He’s just so attractive! The sexual tension is *there,* you know? And we’re always in such close quarters. It’s so easy to get caught up in it!” I lean forward, searching her face for some sign of understanding, hoping she’ll say something like, *‘Oh yeah, totally relatable.’*

She nods slowly. “I understand what that’s like.”

Relief floods through me. *Finally,* someone gets it. But before I can bask in that validation, she continues:

“It sounds like there’s a huge emotional contingency tied to this ‘couch’ or ‘safe zone’ you’ve created with Marc.” She tilts her head slightly, studying me. “You do realize you don’t *have* to do that, right?”

I blink at her, trying to process what she just said. *Doesn’t have to?* She’s out of her mind if she thinks I’m going to give up our nightly couch talks. That’s like saying, *‘Hey, why don’t you stop breathing for a bit?’*

“I *want* to,” I declare, sitting up straighter. “I’ve never felt so seen, so heard.”

As soon as the words leave my mouth, her posture shifts. She grabs her pen and notepad, scribbling something down with quick, deliberate strokes. My stomach knots. *Great.* Now I’m officially a case study.

She pauses, pen hovering mid-air. “What’s going to happen when you two get closer and Kendrick comes back?”

Her words hit harder than I expected like she’s peeled back a layer I didn’t want exposed. She even *sounds* like Marc when she says it, which only makes it worse. I bite back the urge to roll my eyes so hard they might get stuck.

“You sound exactly like Marc,” I snap, frustration bleeding into my voice.

She doesn’t flinch. Instead, she sets her notepad aside, her expression calm—like she’s been expecting this reaction all along.

“There’s a lot to unpack here, and we’ll circle back to it,” she says evenly. “But for now, let’s talk about your homework. Did you get a chance to do it?”

I exhale sharply, grateful for the subject change. “You mean researching trauma bonding and what love looks like to me?”

“That’s correct.”

I nod, trying to shift gears. “I looked up trauma bonding. It’s basically when you form a deep emotional connection with someone who causes you harm.”

And just like that, the conversation shifts again—peeling back more layers than I’m ready for.

“That’s one way to describe it. Did you look up what the cycle looks like? Did it seem familiar?” she asks, her tone calm but pointed.

I already know where she’s steering this conversation. She wants me to connect the dots, to see it for myself. And I do. The dynamic between Kendrick and me mirrors the cycle of trauma bonding almost perfectly. I remember looking it up the morning after my first therapy session—reading those words felt like a punch to the gut.

*‘Step one: love bombing—overly affectionate.’* In Kendrick’s case, it wasn’t flowers and grand gestures; it was relentless apologies, and exaggerated kindness, like he was trying to drown out the damage he caused with temporary sweetness. Then the final step: *‘leaving.’* Over and over. Wash, rinse, repeat. And everything in between? *‘Feelings of inadequacy.’* That’s where I lived—constantly questioning my worth.

“Yes,” I finally say, my voice low, thick with frustration. “It’s exactly what Kendrick and I went through—almost word for word. I didn’t even realize our relationship could be broken down to a science like that. It sucks, you know? Knowing what I thought was special is so common it has a name. I used to tell people they didn’t understand us, that what we had was different. Now I just feel like… a statistic.”

Her voice softens, the gentleness in it cutting through my frustration like a balm. “There’s nothing to be ashamed of. Every relationship is unique in its own way. But patterns, especially the harmful ones, are everywhere. Recognizing them doesn’t diminish your experience—it helps you understand it.”

I nod, her words landing somewhere deep, but there’s something heavier pressing against my chest.

“Speaking of feeling ashamed,” I say with a sigh, my breath shaky as guilt starts to wrap around me like a tight thread. “There’s something I need to tell you.”

“I’m listening,” she replies, setting down her notepad and pen. Her posture shifts slightly, leaning in just enough to show she’s present, fully engaged. The look in her eyes says she’s bracing for something heavy, and I can’t blame her.

“I left out some parts,” I blurt, the words tumbling out faster than I intended. “About… about me being raped. And Kendrick coming to my aid.”

Her face tightens, the concern immediate and palpable. “What did you leave out?”

I swallow hard, feeling the heat of embarrassment rise from my chest to my cheeks. “Marc said Kendrick pressured me to have sex with him after he came to comfort me.” The words feel jagged in my throat like they shouldn’t be spoken out loud. But now they’re hanging in the air, undeniable.

Her face shifts, the concern deepening, etched into every line. “What does he mean by ‘pressure’?” she asks gently, her voice a threadbare whisper, soft enough to keep me from unraveling.

“Kendrick kept asking me to sleep with him. Over and over. Until I gave in,” I admit, my eyes fixed on some invisible point on the floor. “I… enjoyed the sex, so I didn’t think of it as ‘pressure.’ I thought it was just something I wanted. I didn’t tell you because—I didn’t want you to say anything else bad about him.” My voice cracks slightly at the end, the shame threading itself into every syllable.

She takes a breath, her voice even softer, almost like she’s afraid to break me. “I’m sorry to hear that. Are you okay?”

I let out a shaky breath, my chest tightening. “Honestly? That hurts more than the rape.”

She doesn’t rush in with reassurances or platitudes. Instead, she lets the silence hold space for the weight of my words. Then, with the same steady gentleness, she says, “Before we unpack that, I just want to say—this is important. You’re aware now that, on some level, you were still defending Kendrick. Did you come to that realization on your own?”

And just like that, the walls I’ve been holding upstart to crack.

“No, Marc helped me come to this realization,” I reply, my voice softening without me even meaning to. As the words leave my mouth, it hits me—Marc, the guy who never takes anything seriously and turns every situation into a joke, is the one person who’s always attentive and present with me. It’s like my heart is catching up to something my brain already knew.

“Did you have this conversation on the couch?” she asks, tilting her head slightly, her curiosity piqued.

“Yes, I did,” I say, a small smile tugging at the corner of my lips. I tuck a stray piece of hair behind my ear, feeling this subtle warmth in my chest that wasn’t there a second ago.

“How did you feel when you came to this realization?” she presses gently.

I lean back into the chair, my fingers absentmindedly tracing patterns along the seam of my jeans. “At first, I didn’t believe it,” I admit, letting out a soft, breathy laugh. “I fought it—like I always do when it comes to Kendrick. Then I felt angry. Then betrayed. Then sad.” I pause, my gaze drifting to the floor for a beat before lifting again, a quiet smile creeping in. “Then… loved.”

Her eyebrows raise slightly. “Loved? Why did we feel loved?” she asks, her voice light but curious like she’s already piecing the answer together.

“Marc held me the rest of the night,” I say, my fingers now fiddling with the hem of my sleeve, trying to contain the little burst of warmth spreading through me. “He just… stayed there. Reassured me until I fell asleep.”

“You two slept in the same bed?” she asks, her tone playful, one brow arched.

I shake my head, smiling despite myself. “No, I fell asleep on the couch, and when I woke up, I was in my bed… holding my teddy bear.” The memory makes me chuckle softly, my heart doing this little skip like it’s in on the joke too.

She leans forward slightly, her eyes narrowing with that therapist's precision. “I want to come back to you saying that you felt loved. I think it’s a good segue into the other homework assignment—about what love feels like to you.”

I let out a slow breath, slumping back into the cushion like it might swallow me whole. “What love feels like to me…” I drag out, stalling as my mind scrambles for an answer. I glance up at the ceiling like it holds the key, but all it does is remind me that I haven’t thought about this—not until now.

My first instinct is to think of my parents. They've been together for over 30 years, so they should be the blueprint, right? But somewhere along the way, they slipped into a routine where passion faded into the background. Growing up, I started noticing the cracks—my dad’s inability to communicate, like you’d have to bribe him just to get a full sentence, and my mom’s short fuse, the way her anger flares up and he just shuts down, leaving the room like it’s his only defense. It’s hard to tell if they’re still in love or just stuck in a loop of quiet resentment.

So, where does that leave me? The only love I’ve ever wanted is the kind I’ve read about in books. The book boyfriends show their love in the little things—making coffee in the morning, remembering anniversaries without a calendar reminder, and doing all the big, sweeping gestures but never forgetting the small, meaningful ones.

Then it hits me.

“Yes. What does love feel like to you?” she repeats, her voice soft but steady, pulling me back to the moment.

I glance down at my hands, now resting still in my lap, then back up, feeling this little flutter in my chest that I can’t ignore.

1k6faiy,https://www.reddit.com/r/Vent/comments/1k6faiy/friend_taking_advantage_of_my_hospitality/,"""Friend"" taking advantage of my hospitality.","I start this by saying that my wife and I are on the spectrum and our understanding of social interactions is more academic than practical. Because of being lonely or not understanding how to make friends as kids we both dove into different sources to navigate the hundred unspoken rules of socializing. 

That being said we live by the spirit of medieval and Victorian etiquette and hospitality. If invited to my home you will be met with warmth, generosity and safety. We tend to make ourselves available and rarely ask for anything in return except to be a good guest and when possible return the love in some way. Yeah we also believe in decorum and propriety it's not exactly a Ridgid rule structure but just expectations. We tell anyone that has us or come over that this is how we are and we take it very seriously but literally every guest we have has been a nightmare. 

So for this particular guest. We consider her a good friend and we've housed her before for short stints. From back when we just rented a room and had to sneak her emotional support animal in the room, and she was present when we moved into our own place. She usually isn't this bad and though we are always happy when she has left it's never because of her actions but because our social meter has hit empty. 

Now my friend is homeless and lives out of her car and she needed a place to park it and crash while waiting on parts and for it to be fit. She has the worst tendencies to give unnecessary information and numbers to explain a direct question. I asked how long she needed and from what I understood we agreed to 3-4 days but she said that was the minimum could be a week. She confirmed the 3-4 not correcting me and it has now been 7 calendar days. In the first couple of days she was fine. She got us high and we just chilled and had a good time just hanging out. She offered to clean and do dishes. She brought some of her stuff up from her car to make a spot for herself in the corner of the living room (we live in a 1 bedroom apartment). She had tooth pain that we helped her get care for that just required us doing legwork but nothing financially. When that cleared by day 2 or three that is when things went south. 

Slowly yet surely she brought more and more stuff up and has taken over the living room and dining room full of her stuff. She stopped cleaning up after herself and using anything and everything as for garbage and cigarette butts. I ordered a magic bullet from Walmart and they delivered the floor display. I repeatedly said do not take it apart it'll make a funny story because she didn't believe me that it's not functional she took it apart and didn't understand why I was upset afterwards. 

She doesn't take no well. She has this whole thing about being able to get out of dodge when ""They"" come for us and how she wants to homestead. I've let her go on about this in the past but I've had to repeatedly tell her those topics don't interest me and rather not talk about it. She has repeatedly just talked over us about the thing we said stop to until she finishes her thought. She has to be the center of attention. If my wife and I are obviously talking among ourselves she's either yelling what or she'll start cussing at her phone until we ask what's wrong. 

She also can never be wrong and of you tell her the ""fact"" she is saying isn't right or if you have a difference of opinion or source you automatically think she knows nothing of worth. She wanted us to watch a documentary about some guy who built a house outta trash and I told her that a subject that you are really into but I don't want to watch that and I don't want to possibly hurt your feelings by being visibly disengaged. She didn't let it go until we got into one of many yelling matches during her stay and she waited till I was working from home in the living room to drag my wife who showed no interest in the subject but is accommodating to watch it at which point I put on headphones and spent my break in the next room to prove a point. 

She saw a wooden table top by the dumpster and no matter how disinterested or said that's okay she pushed and pushed saying she can make us a coffee table while we wait for the car part. Now I have half a table in my shower with a huge pile of sawdust. We haven't been able to wash ourselves in going on 3 days. It finally came to a head where I took today off work despite being on disciplinary action for attendance and having 0 vacation time to get a exit strategy with her and to make sure she actually works on the car because she will get distracted and the whole day will be gone with nothing done. 

She lacks empathy, is insecure and wants to force topics that we've expressed we don't want to talk about. Because I work and my wife is a stay at home we have defined expectations of each other and because she monopolize my wife time and doesn't clean after herself I didn't realize til this morning in the clear lights (I have smart bulbs and she insists on keeping the main rooms dark even though my wife and I expressed that we aren't fond of it) that my home that my wife takes immaculate care of is trashed. 

So after I tried to broach what if this part doesn't fix the issue, which she deflected and refused to talk about she's been outside all day. She bitched when I told her I'm not coming out there because my wife and I are photosenstive and can't be in the sun all day she started playing victim. She's only been back inside once and according to my wife who she eventually convinced to come help, she doesn't have the right tools to fix this part (though she assured us she did) and she's no closer to fixing the problem. Our apartment has rules about guests and she's to the point they can force the issue about putting her on the leases and we'd have to pay a pet deposit and extra in rent for both of them. She's gone out to her car everyday she's been here doing a bunch of shit taking stuff in and out so it's not like she's been flying under the radar and I don't want to just kick her out on her ass but I'm over not having my space be my own. There's more but honestly this is the jist of it. 

TL:DR because my wife and I follow outdated customs a person we call friend has overstayed their welcome trashing my house and disrupting our lives. ",2,1745455620.0,Vent,1,1.0,False
1k6fa9s,https://www.reddit.com/r/CharlotteDobreYouTube/comments/1k6fa9s/aita_for_cancellig_a_double_wedding_with_my/,AITA for cancellig a double wedding with my bestie 2 days before the event?,"Me (27 f) and my best friend (28 f) -lets call her Amy- had known eachother for about a year before getting engaged in the same month. I was getting engaged to my long time partner, (28 m) who was very supportive of me and my wishes.
My previous best friend -lets call her Janet- had died when I was 25 (I'm 26 now), and it was really hard, especially since I was going to be married in two weeks, as we had planned to have a double wedding. We had gone through drama together, and we were even planning transfer to another university in New York together.
I met Amy a few months ago, and although that isn't a long time, we are still really close. She knows all my secrets and I know all hers. We attend the same university in a different country, and we have met eachother's families - we've even gone on holiday together. Now that you know how close we are, I'll explain the story.
Not too long ago, me and Amy got engaged  - in the same week! We were both delighted, as our finacés are best friends, so we thought that this was litteraly the perfect scenario. 
As a cherry on top, Amy fell pregnant around the same time, and we are both so excited for her little baby to be welconed to the world.
A couple of weeks after our engagements, Amy sat me down in a local coffee shop, and put on her 'I am serious' face. My smile dissapeared, and so I asked, did anything happen? She told me that she knows it's difficult that we're getting married and it's not with Janet, but if it's ok, could we have a double wedding. I started getting upset, and she quickly stammered 'in memory of her, obviously'.
I was reluctant, and I knew she was lying, but I felt bad. The reason she was asking was because she doesn't really have many friends. Plenty of family, not so many friends. That's what I think anyway.
I left the shop later that day, and out of pity I agreed to have a double wedding. We started planning, we had the venue, the theme, the dresses for the bridesmaids, suits for the men and so on so forth. I'd just like to add, I paid for alot of it - and by alot I mean like 90% of it. Yeah, ALOT. I was ok with it, since I'm doing quite well finacially, however she is too, so I found it kind of odd, but I said nothing.
2 days before the wedding, after all the guests had been invited, I suddenly had a horrible panic attack. I was at a loss for breath, I was paler than usual, and I was crying. My fiancé is a medical profesional, so he knew exactly what would help. He lay me down and got me some water. I explained to him why it happened, after it had happened of course - I felt like a horrible friend to Janet. I was imagining how she would feel if she was still with us, and I just couldn't continue with the wedding. 
I called Amy and told her how I was feeling, and her response was just plain shouting. I couldn't make out ehat she was saying but I did pick up 'of course you're bailing on me bitch' and 'I hope you rot'. Even though she wasn't on speaker, my husband could hear her from UPSTAIRS. He rushed down, and at this point I was a waterfall of tears. He hung up the phone and comforted me. A few hours later Amy called me. I reluctantly picked up the phone, and the first words that came out of her mouth were 'but like can you pay for it anyway?' 
I hung up, but I'm starting to feel really bad for her. I don't know what to do - my finacé said he would post bone our wedding (without including Amy). I just keep thinking that it eould have been so fun, and maybe I should pay, I don't know. I keep thinking that pregnancy can make your emotions alot more dramatic. I know it's my fault, I just don't know. My fiancé had told mr not to apologise, and that anxiety and grrif should be enough to stop a wedding.

“It’s nice to meet you finally, Jasmine,”  my therapist says warmly, extending her hand toward me. “I’m Kahina.”

“Thank you, it’s nice meeting you too, Kahina,” I say with a smile, doing my best to mask any awkwardness. From the very first moments, she feels like my opposite—her steady eye contact, the effortless sincerity in her smile. Nothing about her seems fake. 

The room itself radiates a quiet warmth, its ambiance both calming and inviting. Soft, golden light casts a gentle glow over beige walls, deepening their natural tone into something richer, almost honey-like. A sleek black desk anchors one corner, its sharp lines softened by the vibrant green of a nearby potted plant. The furniture completes the room’s grounding palette: The couch is a soft, reddish-brown color, like clay, and the chair is a peaceful deep green, like leaves. A simple black coffee table rests between them, tying everything together.

“This is our first session. Nothing groundbreaking is gonna happen today,” Kahina says, her smile fading into a calm, serious expression. Her tone shifts, steady and deliberate, signaling that I now have her full and undivided attention. She leans down and pulls a notepad and pen from under her chair, a movement so seamless I didn’t even notice the items were there.

“Let’s start with why you decided to come to therapy,” she says, composed and ready.

“Oh, wow, just diving right in, huh?” I reply, caught slightly off guard.

“Well,” she says, her lips curving into a faint smile, “you are paying me by the hour.” 

“Good point,” I mumble, stalling for a moment. “Umm… I’m in love with my ex, Kendrick,” I finally admit, feeling heat rush to my cheeks as embarrassment sets in.

“Mhm,” she hums, encouraging me to continue.

“And he doesn’t love me the way I love him,” I say, the words tumbling out in a rush. “There’s this… cycle. He comes in and out of my life whenever it suits him. He won’t let me go, but he won’t love me back either. And now I’ve met this guy—my roommate, Marcqwuan—who honestly doesn’t even feel real. He’s like something out of one of my books, just… perfect.” I pause, biting my lip. “But the thing is, I know if Kendrick saw me happy or even trying to move on, he’d come right back and try to ruin it.”

Kahina tilts her head slightly, her pen hovering over the notepad. “That’s not how that works,” she says firmly.

“What do you mean?” I ask, furrowing my brow.

“Attraction is a two-way street,” Kahina says, her voice calm yet pointed. “It takes two to tango. The only way he could come back into your life is if you allowed him back.”

“I’ve tried not to let him come back, but it doesn’t work,” I counter, frustration lacing my tone.

“So, every guy who wants to be in your life—do you let them in?” she asks, raising an eyebrow.

“No, of course not. I didn’t say that. Just him.”

“Exactly,” she says, leaning back slightly. “You have control over who you allow into your life. As you just admitted, it’s not every man—just him. Regardless, it’s a choice, and you’ve chosen to allow it.”

“I guess,” I mutter, my cheeks flushing with embarrassment.

“So,” she continues, her pen poised over her notepad, “you want to move on from your ex—for this guy?”

“For me too,” I add quickly, my voice softening.

“Mhm,” she hums, a flicker of doubt crossing her face as she writes something down. “You mentioned that he doesn’t love you the way you love him. How do you love him, compared to how he loves you?”

I take a deep breath, the words spilling out faster than I expect. “I’d do anything for him. I *have* done everything for him. I’ve drained my bank account for him, wrecked my sleep schedule, done things I was uncomfortable with just to make him happy. I stayed by his side at his worst, only for him to make me cry more times than I can count—and he never lost a minute of sleep over it.”

Kahina tilts her head slightly, her expression thoughtful. “I just met you, so I don’t have much to go on yet, but from what you’re saying, it sounds like you believe love is about sacrifice.”

“I think that’s part of it,” I reply, shifting in my seat. “Not all of it, but definitely part of it.”

Her gaze sharpens, and she leans forward, folding her hands neatly in her lap. “I find it interesting. You say love requires sacrifice, but it doesn’t sound like he sacrifices anything for you. And yet, you believe he loves you. How can both be true?”

I hesitate, her question hanging in the air. “It wasn’t always like this. When we were dating, everything was perfect,” I say, my thoughts drifting back to those moments.

“When did you date?” she asks, her tone steady but probing.

“Four years ago,” I admit, the words falling heavy between us.

Without a word, Kahina shifts her notepad back into her lap and begins writing again, her pen moving with purpose.

“How long were you together?” Kahina asks, her pen still moving across the notepad, not sparing me a glance.

“Eight months,” I reply.

“Mhm.” She pauses briefly, still jotting something down before continuing. “So, you’ve known each other for four years, and eight of those months were perfect. What about the other three years and four months?” She sets her pen and notepad aside, leaning back into her attentive stance.

I freeze, her question hitting me like a spotlight I wasn’t ready for. My mind blanks, my confidence evaporating as I stare at her, wide-eyed, like a deer caught in headlights. No one has ever asked me that before, and worse, I’ve never dared to ask myself.

“I…” My voice falters before I finally muster, “I was just chasing those first eight months, trying to get them back,” the words tumbling out in a mix of sadness and shame.

“Can you share an example from those eight months? A moment you’d want to relive?”

“He took me on a date,” I say, the memory surfacing, bittersweet and raw. “The only date we ever went on. Back then, it wasn’t all about sex. He wanted to spend time with me—just me. He didn’t expect me to fuck him or suck his dick.” The frustration in my tone surprises even me as it bubbles to the surface.

“Interesting.” Kahina picks up her notepad again, her gaze sharpening as she writes something down. “What’s the dynamic been like between you two since the relationship ended?”

I shift uncomfortably but push myself to answer. “It’s a cycle. I keep trying to convince him we should get back together, and he keeps throwing it in my face that he doesn’t want to, that we’re better off as friends. Then he’ll ghost me—sometimes for another woman—and eventually come back when it doesn’t work out.”

Her pen doesn’t stop moving as she probes further. “Can you elaborate on what he means by ‘better off as friends’? What does this so-called friendship look like?”

She’s writing more now than before, her pen practically flying across the page. “Don’t worry, I’m still listening,” she reassures me.

“To him, it means I’m there to support him emotionally and have sex with him whenever he wants,” I admit, my voice heavy with bitterness.

“And the ghosting?” she asks, her tone steady as ever.

I sigh, the memories cutting deeper than I’d like. “Whenever I annoy him or make him mad, he yells at me, says *this* is the reason we can’t be together, and then ghosts me for a few days. Other times, he’ll start seeing someone new, and to be ‘respectful’ of their relationship, I won’t hear from him for months.”

“And the coming back?” Her question hangs in the air, her pen paused to capture my response.

“Well, when he ghosted me after an argument, technically I’d be the one to come back. I’d apologize for making him mad or being annoying. When he ghosted me for months to be with another girl, it usually meant things didn’t work out with her—or the sex was bad—and then he’d come back, acting all nice and apologetic.”

“Did he ever cheat on those other women with you?” Kahina asks, locking eyes with me. There’s something in her gaze, almost like she’s hoping I’ll deny it, as if she wants me to say, *No, I’m a girl’s girl. I would never.*

“Yeah, sometimes he would,” I admit, my voice low.

“And you were okay with this?” she asks, setting her notepad and pen aside, her posture now more direct, her focus entirely on me.

“Obviously not,” I say, the frustration bubbling in my chest. “But…I guess I thought it meant something. Like eventually, he’d realize that coming back every time was proof we were destined to be together.”

Kahina doesn’t blink, her voice steady but firm. “You know, I don’t know everything about your dynamic with Kendrick, but what you’re describing? It shows signs of abuse.”

“Abuse?” I repeat, her words hitting me like a slap. My mind races, my defenses rising instinctively. “That’s…wild. It wasn’t abusive. He never laid a hand on me or anything like that,” I say, the need to defend him—and us—overwhelming.

“Abuse isn’t just physical,” Kahina explains calmly. “It can also be emotional. The pattern of anger, leaving, and then coming back with nice gestures or apologies to get back into your good graces—that’s a form of manipulation.”

“Him being apologetic and nice is manipulation?” I ask, the confusion clear in my voice.

“Not inherently,” she says, leaning forward slightly. “But being nice to *get something*? That’s manipulative. Think of it this way: imagine a kid who wants to go out with their friends or get money from their parents. Before they ask, they do all their chores and act extra sweet, staying on their best behavior. The kindness isn’t genuine—it’s a strategy to get what they want. Does that make sense?”

Her analogy sinks in like a rock in my stomach. My jaw tightens as my heart races. I scramble to find a way to defend Kendrick, to defend myself. There’s no way he’s been doing this *on purpose.* And worse—no way I’ve been *this* gullible.

“Everyone gets angry,” I say, my voice rising slightly as my frustration builds. “Everyone gets annoyed. Everyone apologizes. That doesn’t make it abusive,” I add, as if saying it out loud will make it true.

*Kendrick? Abusive?* The thought lodges itself in my chest, sharp and impossible to ignore.

“But making you feel small, abandoning you, and then coming back full of kindness and gratitude? That’s abusive,” Kahina says firmly, her voice unwavering. “Patterns matter. If someone consistently puts you on the back burner, yells at you, or does things that upset you, only to turn around and be sweet and apologetic when they need something—then that’s manipulation. You already see the pattern. You’ve described it yourself: he doesn’t treat you the way you deserve, he leaves, and when he returns, he’s on his best behavior just long enough to win you back. That is the cycle of abuse.”

Her words settle over me like a lead blanket. My chest tightens as my heart sinks to the pit of my stomach. My throat itches and dries out, and I feel a creeping heat across my skin. Then come the tears—blurring my vision, a dam breaking despite my will to hold it together.

“Oh,” I whisper, my voice faint, barely audible.

Kahina stands and moves to her desk, returning with a box of tissues, which she places gently beside me. “Take your time,” she says softly, her tone careful, measured. “I know this is a lot to process, but this is progress. You’re doing great.”

I clutch a tissue but don’t use it, the weight of her words anchoring me in place. The idea that I’ve been in something abusive—a relationship, friendship, situationship, whatever—is suffocating. Has it always been like this? When things were good, I told myself they were really good. During the bad, I convinced myself I was just chasing those good times.

Does Kendrick even know what he’s doing? Could he know? Would he hurt me on purpose? He loves me. Doesn’t he?

The silence stretches until Kahina interrupts my spiraling thoughts. “Would you like to share what you’re thinking?” she asks gently.

“There’s no way our relationship is toxic,” I say, my voice defensive, shaky. “We’ve always been there for each other.”

“Can you give me an example of Kendrick being there for you?” she prompts, leaning forward slightly.

“I was in a dark place, and he was the only one who showed up for me. He dropped everything to be with me,” I reply, my gaze fixed on the floor as memories resurface.

“What happened?” she asks, her voice careful, compassionate.

“I was raped,” I say, the words spilling out with a heaviness I hadn’t anticipated. “He was the first person I told. I called him, and he picked up immediately. He drove two and a half hours to be with me.”

Kahina’s expression softens, and her eyes fill with empathy. “I’m so sorry that happened to you. Is this your first time telling someone other than Kendrick?”

“No,” I answer. “This is my second time in therapy. The first was to deal with the trauma of my rape. That’s when I learned that my hypersexuality was a trauma response. It’s how I take back control of what happened. That’s why I like CNC. I’ve already worked through all of this with my old therapist.”

She nods, her gaze steady. “Hypersexuality is indeed a common response to trauma, and CNC can be a way to regain a sense of control. I’m glad you’ve explored this with a professional. But I couldn’t help noticing how your body tensed when you mentioned your trauma just now. Are there still parts of it you haven’t fully processed?”

I shake my head slightly, though I can feel the tension in my shoulders. “I’ve made peace with it. It doesn’t trigger me anymore. But Kendrick? He wouldn’t have gone out of his way to be there for me if he didn’t love me. There’s no way he’d choose to abuse me.”

Kahina tilts her head slightly. “Have you ever heard the term ‘trauma bonding’?”

“No,” I reply, the phrase unfamiliar, unsettling.

She glances at the clock and sighs lightly. “We’re out of time for today. But I want to commend you—this is excellent progress. Can I see you again next week at the same time?”

“Yeah, sure,” I reply, exhausted by the emotional weight of the session.

“One last thing,” she says, reaching for her notepad. “I have some homework for you.”

“Homework?” I echo, caught off guard.

“Yes. I want you to research trauma bonding. Look for examples and see if any resonate with you. Most importantly, I want you to reflect on this: what does love look like to you? We’ll discuss it next time.”

But I also know that centrality and walkability isn't really critical since the tube is so convenient, and it seems like some of the less central areas are cuter, quainter neighborhoods that people choose for the picturesque ambience. We already live in a modern/industrial city normally, and I'm wondering if Waterloo feels generically similar to that, and whether it would be more fun and romantic and different to stay somewhere more quintessentially London-y (whatever that might mean lol). We loved sitting outside our hotel in Amsterdam drinking coffee by the canals, for example, because it felt so darn picturesque and iconic. In general we love history, historical architecture, and cultural experiences that feel unique or quintessential.

Which would you prioritize? Centrality/walkability or pretty neighborhood vibes? Or am I way off in understanding Waterloo's vibe to begin with?

Here's the thing. I could actually use a new scale. When my very old one finally cracked last year (not the cat's fault, truly), I bought a water-resistant Taylor model locally.

I don’t know why, but I get the feeling you’ve had more than a few relationships that quietly fizzled out once your interest packed its bags and left. Like, one minute you’re all in, and the next you’re emotionally ghosting while still technically replying to texts. Maybe I’m wrong—but your vibe kind of screams “intense eye contact for three weeks and then radio silence.”

Meanwhile, I’ve only had one long-term relationship…loyal to a fault, emotionally stubborn, ride-or-die energy. I stayed even when the red flags were basically tap dancing in front of me. So for me to catch actual feelings again? It’s a rare occasion. 

And that’s what freaks me out. Because if we ever did see each other in that way, I’m afraid I’d fall…hard. And I don’t know if you’d catch me or just gently sidestep while sipping your iced coffee like, “Yikes.”

But hey—maybe I’m overthinking it. Maybe this is just a casual crush and not some cosmic test of my emotional growth. Or maybe I’m just romantically delusional with excellent taste.

I'm an incoming freshman to Queen's University (QU) in Canada for economics starting in September. I will begin an internship for my province's Premier (equivalent to a state governor) in a few weeks. I have also previously interned for about a year in Canada's federal Parliament working on government estimates and public accounts (I didn't work on this file directly but we actually investigated McKinsey's contracts to the Government of Canada - haha). I also worked on quite a few election campaigns as a junior strategist and campaigner, and have been engaged extracurricular as the head of a few political/youth organizations over my time in high school. I've also volunteered on a few US elections before the Republicans threatened to take over my country (Senate, House, governorship, and even presidential).

I'm a little stressed right now since I graduated 1 year early (going into uni at 16 - would this be a disadvantge? my friend on bay street mentioned some jobs may require to be 18+) packing grade 11 and grade 12 into a single year and only applied to economics programs and no business programs originally anticipating to work in Canada's government. However it's become clearer to me that I would like to begin my career in the private sector preferably in the financial sector. QU is considered a target school but mainly for its Smith School of Business/Commerce - not sure how much it carries to its econ department (which is still top in Canada for econ). QU has a ""applied"" econ major where you do some classes with the target school Comm faculty mainly in 3rd/4th year, and I know it is def possible for some QU econ students to land MBB or even IB jobs on Bay Street. A little nervous though as I'm not sure if OCR or campus pipelines are available to econ majors beyond social networks/clubs. Transferring to a comm program generally isn't possible or worth it in Canada, and I am not willing to do another year of hs.

However I don't know where to begin, how to use my exp/profile to get a first year internship summer 26? I have a contact at KPMG I'm planning to coffee chat and am planning to network a bit more this summer in my free time particularly with QU clubs. Also would it be possible to look for a part-time, remote, possibly unpaid search fund or small/boutique firm internship? As my basketball teammate used to say ""what's the game plan?""?

I recognize political ""consulting"" (i.e. lobbying) is a very real and possibly prosperous career in Canada. In fact I've worked with and know a few prominent Canadian lobbyists but the thing is the industry isn't as well-funded or respected as K street in Washington (which even then is probably not as well-funded as people think from my limited understanding).",1,1745454462.0,careerguidance,0,1.0,False

After getting in a relationship and also stress eating during my thesis writing (and maybe being on an SSRI but my doctor insists the weight gain is unrelated, idk) I gained about 10kg which hasn't put me in an overweight category but I'm definitely not comfortable in my body any more and none of my clothes fit. 

I got my first big girl job about a month ago and decided now I have more income to afford healthier food (albeit less time to cook) that I'll be trying to get back in shape. I move house next month and my new place has a free gym for residents so I'm looking forward to using that, too. I dropped about 3kg so far but then, shock horror, on Monday I fell over and badly sprained my ankle. I'm sporting a fashionable bandage and blue/black foot.

My doctor warned me to take it easy for a few weeks while it heals. My job also doesn't do sickdays. I can't elevate it or ice it during the day at the office and I do about 3,000 steps in my commute (walk from home to the subway, subway to office). I had been getting off a stop earlier and adding a few thousand steps to my day but I can't do that right now without being in additional pain.

What's the best way to make sure I don't gain a bunch of wait back for a few weeks? I think I'm going to erase all my progress.

1k6esj8,https://www.reddit.com/r/RothIRA/comments/1k6esj8/diversification_a_popular_concept_misunderstood/,"Diversification, a popular concept misunderstood.","
In the world of investing, “diversification” is one of the most misunderstood buzzwords. Many investors think owning more stocks or ETFs means they’re diversified — but that’s only part of the story. True diversification lies not in the quantity of holdings, but in their relationship to each other — and more specifically, their correlation.

Let’s break this down.

1. Correlation: The Heart of Real Diversification

Correlation measures how two assets move relative to each other. A correlation of +1 means they move in perfect sync; -1 means they move in opposite directions.

Imagine you’re running a business that sells umbrellas and sunglasses. When it rains, umbrella sales go up — sunglasses drop. On sunny days, it’s the reverse. That’s diversification with low correlation. If you only sold umbrellas and raincoats, you're diversified in product count, but not in outcome — both depend on rain.

Owning 100 tech stocks isn’t diversification — it’s just 100 ways to bet on the same macro narrative. But pairing tech stocks with assets like U.S. Treasuries, managed futures, or dividend-yielding utilities introduces diversified return drivers, not just holdings.

2. Risk-Adjusted Returns: Not All Growth Is Equal

Performance alone doesn’t tell the whole story. A portfolio that grows 10% per year but swings wildly might feel exciting — until a 30% drawdown wipes out your confidence. That’s where risk-adjusted return metrics like the Sharpe Ratio come in.

Example:
Portfolio A returns 10% with 20% volatility.
Portfolio B returns 8% with only 5% volatility.
Which is better? In pure return, A wins. But on a risk-adjusted basis, B is far more efficient — delivering more return per unit of risk.
Clients don’t live on returns alone — they live through the ride. A smoother, more predictable return path leads to better outcomes (and fewer panic-driven mistakes).

3. True Diversification Is About Behavior, Not Breadth

Investors often think, “I have 50 holdings — I’m diversified.” But if those 50 holdings all crash when the S&P 500 drops, you’re not diversified — you’re duplicated.

Owning 10 different coffee shops in the same neighborhood isn't diversification — it's concentration in disguise. But owning a coffee shop, a solar panel business, and an insurance agency? That’s diversified by revenue drivers, not just count.

Adding assets with different risk premiums — like international bonds, alternatives, or long/short strategies — creates true diversification by reducing correlated downside, not just expanding your spreadsheet.

4. Limiting Downside > Beating the Market
Here’s a harsh truth: avoiding big losses matters more than hitting big wins.

Why?
Because of math.
Lose 50% → need a 100% gain just to break even.
Avoid the 50% drop? You’re already ahead.

Example:
Investor A: Gains 20% in up markets, loses 40% in downturns.
Investor B: Gains only 12%, but limits drawdowns to 5%.
Over a decade? Investor B ends up with a better compound return — and far more peace of mind.

This is where disciplined strategies shine. Risk-aware, model-driven portfolios that focus on preserving capital during downturns often outperform over full cycles, even if they underperform in bull markets.

Real investing success isn't about owning more. It's about owning better, less-correlated, risk-aware assets.
It's about building a portfolio designed to survive the storm, not just sail fast in clear skies.

1. Great stirrup cay, having come from coco cay and it being all refurbished with a water park, swim up bars, and just allover a really cool vibe, how does Great stirrup cay compare? is there anything special about it? is it similar? the island map doesn't seem too exciting or is stirrup more about the excursions they offer?
2. The ""free at sea"" or rather more at sea deal, i once thought that (or maybe it did) only apply to ""sea"" days and not port days. but I've heard different things from people in person who have claimed to sail on NCL. As far as i can tell from the PDF i got on NCL website the ""more at sea"" offers an open bar with a variety of drinks every day, 3 specialty dining offers on a 7 night cruise with a balcony, 2.5 hours of WIFI. That's all just included in the ticket price, yes? How about coffee other than ""cream and sugar"" but not Starbucks. on RCL i could get the cheap drink package that didn't include alcohol and i could get coffee and smoothies from non brand locations like in the dining buffet area they had a small little coffee area where i could get a cappuccino or hastily made caramel macchiato
3. How does their dining work? i saw their ""freestyle dining"" video that says dine with ""whoever, wherever, whatever"" slogan but it didn't exactly explain it. do they have like a selection of ""main"" dining areas that are included and you can basically walk up, ask for a table with the cruise friends you just made and like a restaurant wait to be seated with however many are in your party? with options for buffets and quick bites around the ship?
4. What kind of activities are around the ship on a day to day basis? there's obviously go-karting, the arcade seems better than anything I've seen on royal so far (even though odyssey has a whole VR thing the arcade as whole felt meh) but Royal has a lot of things like trivia or little shows/games to make use of their small venues throughout the day, does NCL do similar? I'm not against relaxing but i always like having something to do, i occasionally get bored on cruises but i beats working so i can't really complain

These are just some questions i had coming into a cruise that are a little more specific than i could find online atm. Feel free to share anything you enjoy or stands out for you. I'd love to know more that maybe isn't directly advertised. i don't know what i don't know so let me know what your favorite parts of NCL or the Bliss are!",2,1745454097.0,NCL,1,1.0,False

I know the only way to really find out is to continue being dairy free for a few days and then eat dairy and see what happens, but I just want to know if anyone else has experienced this. 

TLDR: I consumed dairy for the first time in a month and now have an itchy scalp, itchy palms, and red itchy splotches on my face. I haven’t used anything new. ",3,1745453850.0,dairyfree,1,1.0,False

1k6ens4,https://www.reddit.com/r/Anemic/comments/1k6ens4/was_i_wrong_to_push_for_iv_iron/,Was I wrong to push for IV Iron?,"Hey all! Been feeling really weak and tired for quiet some time. Just found out over the weekend that I have an iron deficiency.  I've been so fatigue, high heart rate doing normal things, struggling to workout due to heart rate, brain fog, and honestly feeling depressed. I thought I wasnt pushing myself enough until I saw these results. I wake up tired and only coffee and ltheanine give me enough boost to get through the day.

After some research on here I nudged my doctor to refer me to a hematologist for IV Iron instead of waiting for Iron supplements to kick in. Does that seem like overkill in my scenario? I was proud of myself for advocating for myself then had second thoughts/was wondering if it's maybe not warranted. Anyone with similar numbers get it?

Yesterday at dinner for some bizarre reason I completely forgot and also somehow assumed that Diet Coke didn't have caffeine. Well 2/3 of the way into the bottle it hit me and into the garbage it went. Literally only five minutes or so later I developed a pretty wicked headache that lasted me for the rest of the night. The bottle itself was a smaller one, filled with 30mg's of caffeine. I estimate that I had around 10mg over four or so gulps. Meanwhile I hadn't had more than probably 20mg of caffeine in the last four MONTHS.

Then last night I woke up at 3:00am and felt wide awake for a good hour before getting sleepy again. My sleep has struggled since getting off caffeine, but waking at this time was very unusual for me. Its just crazy how sensitive I always was and still obviously am to caffeine.

1k6ehji,https://www.reddit.com/r/alberta/comments/1k6ehji/wcb_discharging_me_despite_reinjury_caused_due_to/,"WCB discharging me despite re-injury caused due to them trying to force me back to work too soon - I have recorded proof of my case worker making up evidence and refusing to answer my questions to try to force me out of the program - please, please help, I can't afford treatment on my own","Just wanted to start this off by saying thank you so much to anyone who is reading this, I don't know what to do here and I'm extremely worried, especially since I can't afford treatment myself and my case manager and kinesiologist are openly and verifiably lying about various things to try to get me out of the program and I have recordings to prove it - I'll elaborate on this a bit later when it fits into the story. TLDR is at bottom, but would recommend reading as there are important details which can't really be shortened.

I have been off work for an injury since January, seeing a PT for most of that, but then a few weeks ago they moved me into the return to work program at CBI health. This did not go well at all. CBI health employees were horrible, the ""tests"" they gave to assess my injury were basically ""lift this 5 pound box with handles that are specifically designed to make carrying it as easy as humanly possible"" and ""lift your arm with no weight"", and after those assessments they dismissed pretty much everything I said and just parroted ""there will be pain, that is normal"" and other stuff like that. I get some pain is normal, but pain worse than what I had on the day of the injury? That is not normal.

For my job I carry lots of heavy things like tables and chairs and industrial coffee machines around, set them all up, and then the rest of the shift is usually just making sure nothing goes wrong for those making use of them. It is very demanding, and the return to work meeting person from CBI even stated that. My first week back with modified duties I was only working 3 hrs, despite that I was in a fair bit of pain after doing the lifting stuff at the start, but it got better after a day or so of rest. Second week I was in constant severe pain (5-7/10 pain) and also had severe pain flair ups (7-8/10 pain) whenever I would move my upper body, my neck or my arms, and this was after being at work for just a couple hours. This hasn't gone away in the two weeks since, if anything it has gotten worse and spread to different places, so I called my WCB person the a couple days after my shift and they told me to get a doctors note saying I am unable to work at this time. I did that, the doctor agreed I was unable to work at this time, so he gave me the WCB note which I submitted.

I then spent a whole week and a half trying to get in contact with my case manager. I called every 5-15mins for my case manager's whole shift duration for multiple days and left voicemails as well. Thankfully someone let me know that I can do a legal request for callback where they are required to call back within one day, which I did. During this time my PT who had been seeing me previously had heard from my aunt who was seeing him that I was not doing well. He contacted me, asked me some questions, and said that I didn't have the right tests done (had xray done, just did what the doctor told..) and said I should probably get an ultrasound or something like that done.

I got a call back finally and my case manager is trying to kick me out of wcb, stating ""we have medical evidence that means it is resolved, there is no objective evidence to prove your claim"" despite the fact that WCB told me to see a doctor, get assessed by them, and get a note from them saying I am unable to continue work, which I did and which I also sent in and know they have. I was also told by the person at CBI that we could extend the return to work program more, which meant I was really surprised when my case manager didn't even tell me about that option, she just said was going to discharge me from WCB and that's that.

A few more things she said: ""your type of injury generally takes 4-8 weeks to heal and you have been out way past that"", ""WCB is covering a back injury, not a shoulder injury"" which was truly a stupid fucking thing to say as she said that because I got an xray done on both my back and shoulder AT THE REQUEST OF MY DOCTOR, I had no say in it, I just did what my medical professional told me to, and I honestly still cant believe she had the audacity to say such a thing. She also said ""we can't have a case based on pain because pain is different for everyone"" as if my entire case wasn't based on the fact that I had extreme back pain following something that had potential to injure me, and as if I wasn't literally begging her to tell me what tests I needed done to prove that I am still not okay. Isn't pretty much every single case that doesn't include a broken bone based off of pain?

As I said above, I had asked her many, many times to tell me what tests or forms I needed to prove my injury to them, and my case manager outright refused to tell me. She lied and said various things like ""i dont know"", ""wcb doesnt ask for these things, your doctor tells you"", ""wcb doesn't know these things"", etc. So I called up the WCB generic line immediately, told them my case number, asked them to tell me what tests I would need to prove my injury and they IMMEDIATELY told me what assessments I needed and the exact forms with the exact form numbers that I needed filled out, as well as the REAL reason my case manager wasn't accepting my doctors note, which is because a specific form was needed to be filled out when I saw my doctor, one which I was NEVER TOLD ABOUT.

And on top of that, the ""medical evidence"" they have is completely irrelevant, all of it was from before my ""re-injury"", like a month ago when I first went into the program, except for piece of ""evidence"" which was my case worker saying ""the people at CBI have been watching you while you were there and have said you are fine and are able to return to work"" despite the fact that I literally have not stepped foot within 15 kilometers of their building since the ""re-injury"", which was two weeks ago now. How the hell would my kinesiologist know if my condition is getting better or worse when they haven't seen me since the re-injury, and the only things they've heard from me is talking on the phone saying ""i'm doing really badly, I'm in severe pain and things are getting worse and spreading"" when they called me every other day???? And this is all despite the fact that my kinesiologist herself told me before things got so bad with my injury that she agrees that I seem to be having problems and said that we should maybe add in more weeks to the program (but with continued modified 3-4hr/day work, which I am unable to do). Unfortunately that was a short in-person conversation and so I do not have a recording of it.

Anyways, I never said yes or accepted anything my case worker or CBI said regarding my discharge, but let her go because it was futile, it honestly felt exactly how I felt when I was trying to express my difficulties to the CBI people. Completely ignored, disregarded, and disrespected. She said that she will be sending me the discharge papers shortly. Now I of course expected this, thankfully everyone who I talked to about WCB and CBI both online and in real life said that WCB and CBI are complete scumbags and will try to fuck you over at every chance they get, so I have been recording calls, writing down my condition day by day, writing down issues I've had with WCB and CBI day by day, etc.

With that I have a recording of my case manager telling me that she can't tell me what forms/tests I need to get done and a recording from 15 minutes later with WCB's generic help line where not one, but two (yes, i called back to get a different person just to confirm that the first person was right) of their WCB people immediately tell me what forms and tests I need done, as well as why my previous note wasn't fully accepted. I also have a recording of my case manager lying and saying my kinesiologist has been ""watching my progress and says I'm okay"" despite the fact that I literally had not been within 15km of their facilities since re-injury, which is two weeks now. There's other cases too, but those are the ones I have 100% fool proof evidence of. On top of that, I have her in recording openly dismissing my constant attempts to get some tests/assessments done, saying ""the month old outdated and irrelevant evidence says otherwise""

I just don't know what to do. Knowing what I know now from the people who helped me on the WCB generic line and from what my PT had said, as well as re-listening to how my case worker has been talking to me in the past, it is very, very clear that my case worker is intentionally leaving out critical details so that she can try to bully me into accepting an early discharge despite still being injured. She knows that I have these rights, but is refusing to let me make use of them and telling me I don't have these rights even though the generic WCB help line has confirmed that I do. The whole time I could tell she was getting very upset with me asking these completely reasonable questions too, which was very unprofessional.

TLDR: My case manager is openly and verifiably lying to me and has been withholding very important information regarding my recovery, and is now trying use that to try to bully me out of the program. The CBI return-to-work program kineseologist is in on it too, which I am not surprised by, as she is on their payroll and everyone who I've talked to says this is the CBI and WCB signature move. The case manager is processing the discharge and said I can contest it once it is sent to me, which I will of course do, but I don't really know how to move forwards from here.

What do I do here? I can't really afford treatment, but I would really like it so I am probably going to try to go to my PT on Friday since that is literally all I can afford. Is there anything I could do to get that partially covered? Is it time to get a lawyer involved? Do I escalate to her supervisor first? If so, do I tell the supervisor about my case worker lying and the proof that I have of it? Do I report my case manager to any regulatory body? I honestly have no idea what to do next other than just contest it, which I'm sure they'll deny since my case worker clearly doesn't care about rules or regulations and just wants me gone.

That's really all I can think of, if there is anything you have questions or want clarification on anything I would be very happy to answer, I am going to be checking back here every now and then for the next \~6 hours, and then again the next day.

Thank you so much to everyone who has taken time to read this and see if they are able to help me in any way. Whether you are able to help me with this shitty situation or not, I truly, truly appreciate you taking time out of your day to try to help a stranger who is really struggling.

1k6egv6,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1k6egv6,ISO Female Roommate,"*June 1st Private room and Bathroom available in Teele square (Close to Redline)*

Hi everyone! My roommate is moving to Philly and I am currently looking for someone to take her spot in our 3 bedroom 2 bath apartment on Teele square (15min walk from Davis station) with a June 1st start date (year-long lease) for $1650 per month

About the apt:
- open kitchen concept with dishwasher
- front porch and sun room in the back!
- 2 bathrooms! So we each get our own private bathroom
- one extra room to share between us that I currently use as a home office and my roommate uses as a guest bedroom
-quiet residential street
-plenty of street parking (no offstreet parking unfortunately)
- coin washer/dryer in basement (that we use as storage!)
- the apartment itself is pet friendly, however I would consider anyone that has a pet on a case by case basis
-your private room will be unfurnished and so will common areas since most of the furniture is hers, however I am actively looking for furniture/waiting to see if my next roommate has furniture already

About me:
I’m a 25 year old professional working as an electrical engineer at amazon! I moved here one year ago from San Diego, CA. Im very quiet and clean. I have a bunch of cozy hobbies like reading, playing board games or just hanging out in the living room. I go out every once in a while and have friends over but not too frequently. I love doing daytime activities on the weekends like getting coffee or going to one of Bostons many museums! Im also really into indoor cycling!

My ideal roommate:
- woman only please around the same age as me
- mindful of sleeping times and friendly! I would like to be friends with my roommate and hang out every now and then!
-keeps common areas clean
- is also a professinal, but grad students will be considered

Please reach out if interested and we can have a chat/ I can show the apt in person or through ft!",2,1745453144.0,bostonhousing,0,1.0,False

I know this might sound silly, but there is a person who I considered my friend. Not too close, but we would hang out every once in a while, say birthday wishes for birthdays. He had feelings for me previously, but I was clear about not wanting a relationship and he didn't seem too unhappy with it. Last time we saw each other was when we went out for a coffee and then it started raining so he came round to mine, chatted to my mom for 2 hours, we had a beer and then he left. Then, I wished him a happy birthday a week afterwards and it was our last conversation. He said thank you and that's it. Today, I realized that he unfollowed me and removed from followers (although still follows some people he previously expressed his dislike to) and I'm not really sure what to do and whether I've done something wrong. Also I have an exhibition coming up soon and I promised him I'll invite him to my next one but considering that I am not sure if I should. The most realistic option is probably just to ignore iand let him be but it does for some reason bother me, because I thought we had a good relationship and I liked chatting to him.

1k6ee41,https://www.reddit.com/r/barista/comments/1k6ee41/lack_of_training_makes_me_lose_all_hope/,Lack of training makes me lose all hope,"I just need to know if anyone out there is in the same boat as me. I around 7 years of specialty coffee experience, including management and ownership. Located in the US.

After being in the industry for a few years, I started noticing things at other coffee shops when I would go out and around town, and other places when I would travel. Things that the baristas weren't doing correctly, just small things that I would notice. This can be applied for most jobs though, once you know you know, and you notice others in your industry and how they do things.

But for some reason, coffee like no other, has the absolute WORST training standards... and the thing that appalls me the most about it, is how prevalent it is. 9/10 of the coffee shops I visit these days have absolutely no standards and it really really sucks. It's so hard to go out and get a good cup of coffee. 

My problem lies in that I don't frequent any given place. I operate my own cafe, so I really don't need to find a good spot and just stick to it. I only visit cafe's when I travel, and it seems I have to always do so much research to determine if a spot is worth visiting or not. Half the time I travel, I honestly just go to Starbucks, no matter how ""bad"" it may be, at least I know of a drink I will like there, as it is consistent. 

Just the other day, I visited a shop where the barista steamed milk, then proceeded to pour this steamed milk into a cup of ice, put the syrup and shots in, and give it to the customers. When they steamed it, it screamed so loud my ears felt like they would burst. They repeated this for all the iced drinks I witnessed while I was there.  
This is just one example of many I often see, including:

* Not clearing or wiping down the steam wand (ever)
* Dirty, filthy rancid hoppers probably never cleaned
* Portafilters and baskets not being cleaned
* All torani syrups (i cant stand these premade syrups)
* No frothing technique. Either loud & screeching, or frothing all foam the entire time
* Disgusting shots running like dirty water
* Asking for any drink and receiving it wrong. Example: asking for a cappuccino, getting no foam. asking for a cortado, receiving a 12oz drink. Asking for a double shot and receiving a 10oz beverage which I'm assuming is just an extremely watered down espresso. Baristas not knowing very standard coffee drinks.

  
I understand that coffee shops often have a young, rotating staff, but I would never let any of my baristas serve drinks if they were not up to my standards. And my staff is also young, mostly college students. They are all trained on everything else in the store before finally being trained on bar, which takes 2-3 additional weeks. I make them all pass ""tests"" before they're allowed on bar alone, and we have standards that are not only taught but written out for them. Quality control is of top priority for me. I just dont understand WHY so many shops have NO IDEA what they're doing.  
  
I'm also in a Facebook group with other ""coffee shop operators/owners"" (around 25k people), and the amount of really insanely simple and stupid questions these people ask astonishes me. Like these people seriously never even spent a day as a barista and have no idea what they're doing. They just wanna run a coffee shop because its fun and cute.   
Its not. When you have to change all of your water filters, when the roof starts leaking, when the ice machine stops working during a rush, when the fridge runs hot, when you're short staffed, when you need to train your staff on your bean & roast types, how to dial in your espresso & drip grinders and machines, how to operate everything effectively, when your baristas need to look to YOU for leadership, its not just fun and games. Its no wonder so many shops are so bad. Its like the blind leading the blind.

1k6ebcf,https://www.reddit.com/r/AutismInWomen/comments/1k6ebcf/speed_dating/,Speed dating,"Ok guys .. not sure if this is more likely to resonate with those of us who eventually realize we are ‘high masking’ .. 

But I went to a speed dating event in my 30s when I was damned and determined to not be single anymore. 

I mean I was 35 and had never had a boyfriend (I’m straight - as far as I know 😆) 

All of the guys - there were 8 of them - either bored me or gave me the ick.

The next day I got a call from the speed dating event organizer to tell me that 7 out of 8 of them said they were interested in getting my contact info.

I had checked off zero. 

She kind of pleaded with me to reconsider .. ‘it’s just a coffee’ .. she must have really been keen to get ‘matches’ so her business could get testimonials or something.

Anyways looking back I’m so sad for my undiagnosed self as I now realize I was always always always performing to make every else comfortable. 😭😭

I mean I’m finally aware - I’m 62 - of how much this costs me in terms of my health and well being, but it’s still such a hard thing to unlearn. 

Anyone relate ? Any suggestions on how to unlearn this ? I’ve got an autistic therapist finally but I’m impatient as I only have 25 percent of my life left to live (based on average mortality). 

I know that last sentence sounds pretty autistic ..

She died in a car crash this morning.""","She was on her way to work, just like any other Tuesday. She kissed me goodbye, said, “See you tonight,” and left.

Forty minutes later, I got the call. Drunk driver. Head-on collision. She died on impact.

I don’t remember much after that. Just sitting on the kitchen floor, staring at nothing.

Then, her name popped up on my phone.

“hey, want me to grab coffee for you?”

I thought it was a delayed message. Denial is a powerful thing. But then another came in:

“traffic’s bad. might be a little late. love you.”

I didn’t respond. Couldn’t.

But the messages kept coming. All day. Normal stuff. Like she was just... living her day.

“client bailed on the meeting. ugh.”
“thinking pasta for dinner?”
“do you ever think about that night in Vermont?”

That last one stopped me cold.

Vermont was where we had our honeymoon. And something happened there. Something no one else knows.

One night, we were hiking and got lost. We found an abandoned cabin and broke in to wait out the storm. In the morning, something had followed us back to the trail. It never spoke. Just watched. A shape in the trees. We never talked about it again.

Now, 15 years later, she texts me:

“it followed me. i think it’s here.”

I called her number. It rang twice, then clicked to voicemail.

Her voice. Happy. Alive.

“Hey! It’s me. Leave a message and I’ll get back to you—""

The message says (rephrased so he doesn’t find me) 

“Thanks for the coffees I’ve been getting more since you’ve started making them, I had to add this stunning girl” and some emojis which I don’t even wanna add

1k6e622,https://www.reddit.com/r/exmormon/comments/1k6e622/advice_needed_as_a_confused_21year_old/,Advice needed as a confused 21-year old,"Hi guys! This honestly might end up being a really long post, but I’ll try my best to keep it short lol.

I (F21) was raised in the church by my father (my parents divorced when I was young, my mother had never converted, but my step mother ended up converting and my dad kept raising us in the church after his initial divorce (I was around 4yo). He was also my primary parent.)

I honestly wasn’t too into the church growing up, since I saw my mom every other weekend, and didn’t have to go to church then. I’ve had a lot of experience through other churches through my mom (Methodist, Protestant, basic Christian, etc.), but i was still technically a Mormon, and my father was very strict about that. Modesty was a huge deal, dating, coffee/tea, going to girls camp and everything like that. 

Through the church, I did believe in God and Jesus Christ, but I never really understand the Book of Mormon and its “importance”. I honestly never even read that thing lol. However, I honestly did feel a connection with God, and always found myself praying to Him.

Once I left for college, I obviously stopped going to church (thankfully my dad never pushed me on going on a mission). This break gave me space between God, but after my first semester, I found myself wanting to rekindle my connection with God. However, I really didn’t want to go back to the LDS church, but rather experience other churches. I never got around to doing that since I was scared of going alone. However, once I started my junior year of college, my BF (who’s catholic), invited me to his church a few times. 

The first time going was very scary, but afterwards, I found it pretty nice. However, only going a few times, I’m not sure of everything they believe. My BF has mentioned that he would help me go through the process of converting if I wanted to (he’s not forcing it or anything lol), but I just don’t know. I’m not sure what my dad would do, but Im also not sure about converting since I still don’t know much about the Catholic Church.

Now, this recent Easter, I decided to go to my local LDS church. I had never gone to this one, but when I went, it felt so nice. I felt so comforting to go back to where I used to go every (other) Sunday, and everyone there was so nice to me. Obviously for Easter the service was only 1 hr, but if i were to go again, i would also have to start going to Relief Society, which I’ve never done. Im worried that if i start going more often, they would start to push me on getting endowed and paying tithing (and as a broke college student, no wayyy). I honestly just don’t know if I should just try going back to the LDS church, just to keep that comfortable feeling going, or if I should try going to the Catholic Church. Another reason I want to go to the LDS church is to be able to take the sacrament, which I can’t do at the Catholic Church until im confirmed.

Anyways, I don’t have many religious friends so i didn’t know who to bring this up to. I thought about talking to a bishop, but I think he would just be biased and tell me to stay with his church.

1k6e59c,https://www.reddit.com/r/step1/comments/1k6e59c/passed_old_img/,Passed (Old IMG),"As an old IMG actively working in a hospital, my preparation felt like a rollercoaster, and there were significant pauses along the way. I began with Pathoma, watching all the videos and finishing the book.  (I think it is unnecessary because I forget all of them completely.) After that, I started UWorld in random time mode and completed half of the questions, annotating on FA.( it was also unnecessary). I then reviewed FA and finished the other half of the UWorld questions, maintaining an approximate correct rate of 50%. Unfortunately, I couldn't study for a while after that. When I reset UWorld, I only completed 28% of the questions before leaving it entirely. I also struggled to read FA thoroughly again and felt like I was forgetting almost everything. Deciding to switch strategies, I turned to Mehlman's PDFs. I covered high-yield topics including arrows, biochemistry, microbiology, pharmacology, renal, endocrinology, neuroanatomy, biostatistics, and ethics. I then focused on my NBME exams (25-31), scoring 66.5, 66.5, 70, 63.5, 66, 71.5, and 70.5, respectively. A week before the exam, someone mentioned the importance of repro topics, so I worked through Mehlman's content on that as well. During the exam, I was grateful for that advice, as many questions related to repro appeared. In the last week, I completed all UWorld questions and Amboss high-yield questions on ethics and biostatistics. I scored 70% on the Free 120 practice exam. The exam questions were not vague, but I felt a bit sleepy while taking it. I managed to finish all the questions on time but couldn’t go back to review my flagged questions. For my exam, the topics that came up most frequently included ethics (at least 5 q's in every block), repro, psych, and immuno. During breaks, protein bars, bananas, and coffee helped me a lot.

The workers threw their water bottles, coffee cups, wrappers, ropes, string in the yard. They left gloves and face masks. There are 2 garbage cans in the yard, which were not used by them, at all. We picked up whatever they left out after they left each day. Apparently we missed some items that were left out but not noticed by us. They had either blown or were thrown behind shrubs, bushes or a wall. 

I spoke to the owner and told him that his crew cannot leave their garbage and gloves, etc laying around because the dogs are tempted to chew and possibly eat stuff like that. His crew continued to leave garbage and stuff on the ground daily. 

Our dogs got a hold of a glove and coffee cup. We had no idea until one pup got very sick and went to the vet. 

The pup was treated and monitored, as the glove fingers caused an obstruction. In the end, the vet recommended euthanasia because her bowel became diseased to the point of rupture while they treated and monitored her. 

Our second dog became sick a two days later. He defecated a glove, missing fingers, and a lot of blood was coming from his rectum. The vet did an examination and xray. His stomach had contents but because his bowels were clear and he was not vomiting, they sent him home to be monitored and return for another xray the next day. 

Overnight, he threw up a large amount of his food including a large wadded paper coffee cup. He returned to the vet for an xray and they noted his entire GI tract was inflamed and full of gas but there was less content in his stomach.His bowels were clear. He was treated, prescribed an pre/probiotic medication and an antibiotic to treat his GI, stomach inflamation and rectal bleeding. The emergency vet recommended he be seen by his regular vet the next day for another xray to ensure his stomach and bowels were empty and there was no obstruction. Luckily, he was cleared.

We lost a pup and the law considers pets property. I get that. 

My daughter is out a total veterinary cost of over $6k.

I've got questions about both dialing in and steaming, but since one can only use a single flair, the steaming is the more important issue out of the two so I'll start there.

I've watched about a dozen videos, many featuring the exact same machine, on how to steam and pour art. Try as I may, I cannot get it right. Milk poured to bottom of spout. I have the wand heated, purged and inserted slightly to one side. Inserted just below the surface of the milk (so far I've tried 0% and 2%) on start, then lower the provided pitcher slightly to get that paper tearing sound. I increase the volume from the starting point for a few seconds until the moving milk vortex reaches about halfway up the sides of the pitxher (measured from top to milk level). I continue to swirl with tip lowered back into the starting position, heat until the pitcher is too hot to touch. I then shut off the steam and remove once the steam and noise had ceased, set it aside and clean the wand. I tap the bubbles on the surface, swirl it around, at this point it *looks* fine like wet paint. I swirl the milk, tilt my cup, swirl it too and pour from a height which allows the milk to fall right through the crema. I then bring the pitcher into contact with the cup and one of two things happen. Either the milk makes the tiniest foam contrast blob while mostly still falling through like regular milk, or it falls through and then leaves an unpourable blob of motionless microfoam.

Try as I may I just cannot figure out what I'm missing here. Any thoughts and help would be appreciated!",1,1745451638.0,espresso,5,1.0,False

It sounds almost too simple, right? But if it’s true, it would be huge. Imagine not needing to convert your crypto to cash just to buy something. You just swipe and go.

I was torn about leaving my job where I was pretty miserable and undervalued for something more challenging and a growth opportunity. I ultimately decided to take the new job.

Literally three weeks into the new gig, I got thrown into this enormous, incredibly urgent, very high visibility, substantial business-impact firefighting problem. For five weeks now, my days are absolutely nonstop. I am lucky if I find a break to take a shit. 

Forget about my daily 20 minutes on the treadmill. 

Forget about my 100oz water hydration goal. 

Forget about making it to my weekly (telehealth in the car) therapy appointment that I made to help me navigate some other stressors I am dealing with (that have most definitely not gone away). 

Forget about being home on time to cook dinner. 

Forget about keeping up with the laundry. 

Really forget the fuck about cleaning the house beyond the absolute bare minimum. 

Forget about seeing my friends for our monthly lunch dates. 

Forget about the feeling of having any semblance of control over my time. The ONE, and I mean ONE, time of day no-fucking-body needs me for any-fucking-thing is my 22 minute morning commute, because for my evening commute I have to call into a daily standup while I drive home.

Forget about having a single microgram of energy left for my husband after being employee and mom all day.

At this point I am on the verge of tears every day (and I want to have a big cry!!!!) about giving up the sweet setup I had as the “little helper” engineer who just kind of did her own thing and had self care routines fucking NAILED!

What the fuck was I thinking when I signed up for this dumpster fire of a company that conveniently mentioned only AFTER my first day that the reason my skills to manage multiple high-priority projects were valued is because this place hasn’t released a new product in EIGHT FUCKING YEARS and is in scramble mode to get things out to the market.

Please, PLEASE can I go back and have a redo. Yes, my coworkers are pleasant and respectful. No, I am not being sexually harassed on a regular basis. 

I just miss my old balance TERRIBLY and I am drowning in misery all-day, every day.

My boss randomly scheduled a 1-1 tomorrow. Do I bring this up? I truly do not know what the fuck to do.

To add some context, a quality issue was identified at the 11th hour of what is supposed to be our new flagship product. I have to provide schedules and results TO THE HOUR every single fucking day. And regularly conversing with the SVP of R&D.

I am tired and I want out.

But really, what can I actually do?

My husband also games a LOT. He is huge into warhammer as well, and goes to meta most Wednesdays. He’ll do pretty much anything with company. Down to bike, build a deck, fish, go to the arcade etc. He really would be down to do just about anything if he found someone he cliques with.

She has worked for the same company for over 20 years and has a corporate position in that company. She has worked for corporate for over a decade now. Her husband also has a decent job but she makes more than her husband. My younger sisters still live with her but it would not surprise me at all if she is also financially abusive to them like she was to me. She also acted weird when she told me that one my younger sisters is moving out. (Probably cause she knows that if my sisters don't live with her she won't have an excuse to take their money)

But she acts extremely weird about my money even though I don't live with her. I am an adult and rent a room somewhere else without her. She gets mad that I don't tell her how much I have in my bank account. She also pays close attention to what I buy (even if its just starbucks coffee!) And she organized my room without asking me. She rearranged everything in my closet and moved my furniture around without asking me. She says she did it to ""help"" me but I did not need her to do that and I did not ask her to do that either. I think her real motive was to be nosey. And more recently when we were talking about pets she gave me a scary look when I said ""I don't want any pets cause I can't afford any right now"". Her eyes turned slightly yellow when I said that and were extremely dramatic. She also waited 8 years to tell me that my great grandma left me an inheritance. She waited until 8 years after my great grandma died to tell me that. I eventually got it but I think my mom wanted it for herself.

My bio dad use to also accuse my mom of being a golddigger when I was a kid (she got remarried a decade after she divorced my bio dad). I am starting to think my bio dad is right though. I don't think he knew about everything she took from me though because she did not start to steal from me until years after their divorce.

My store manager, and other managers and I would store use candy for everyone to help themselves as a treat from time to time. I explained that we have a candy basket where we help ourselves to a treat. It’s not just for personal consumption. 

I was also asked why I stored used honey. I explained that in the break room we have teas, coffees, and other things for employees to help themselves with. I recently cleaned out the break room and I threw they expired or to be expired honey away. 

My RX manager asked if we sold honey I said yes and she asked me to store use a bottle. I did in replacement of the honey that was already in the break room.

Another incident is that I store used a bottle of soda. For my pharmacy manager with the approval of my store manager because she had brought pizza to celebrate our work. So I did for him. 

I had an interview with AP last week and he said that he needs to send everything to colleague relations and my DL. I asked him how long this would take he said a week. It’s been a week. He said it’s up to the DL to make a decision but he said he doubts anything will happen or in worst case senario I go on suspension.

But if you're involved in Monad because you're interested in learning more, excited and/or curious about the technology, the energy and excitement and unique hype of internet culture blending with real infrastructure, then you're in for a real treat.

The people in the community who rise to the top are unique and special. They're not regurgitating the same content, they're doing something different.

Point is, be yourself, be unique, it's great to stand out in your own weird and authentic way. This community is accepting and open and excited about innovation and being real.

Make sure to speak your mind, pitch your ideas. Some of the most insane ideas became incredible projects with lots of love from community members. Want to spread the word? Maybe organize a local meetup?  Do you have a challenge idea or a cool community quest or a twitter or meme  that could go viral? Don’t wait for permission and ask around, dive in and just do it.

Don't be a lurker. There's a lot going on in the Discord daily. And there's tons of incredibly interesting Discords and accepting communities.  Make sure to lift people up, welcome  new folks, and just be yourself.  If you're on Twitter or wherever you post, go nuts with replying, tagging, hyping Monad and your fellow community members. We love it. Positivity is contagious. 

With so many new community members knowing the ins and out of the ecosystem helps as well. If you’re knowledgeable about running testnet dApps, make sure to give feedback. If you have a smart take on Monad, take the time to write it out. People notice thoughtful contributions over just saying Gmonad in every channel. Have content? Make stuff that slaps. Memes? Critiques? Analytics? It doesn’t matter as long as it adds something.

A great way to build credibility is to meet people, to host things, could be a little online hangout, a local coffee-and-crypto get together, or hosting a community game. You have everything to gain by bringing people together, educating and engaging. That’s leadership in the most fun way.

Make sure to hype up others. When you see something cool, boost it, retweet it, talk about it. If someone confused or looking for guidance, help them. Positivity and good vibes are contagious. Karma is real and you give, the more it comes back around.

Most importantly don’t compare your progress to someone else’s. Roles come from *impact*, not from being early or loud. There is not one path. Everyone’s path is different. Just because someone is shining, doesn't mean you're less than them, it just shows you what is possible. 

Experiment in Monad. There's so much going on and this is just the beginning of the story. Not everything you do will be home runs, but finding your voice and your niche will be easier than you expect. And just know, that if the community *misses you* when you’re gone and get excited when you show back up, you're doing it right.

Finally, theres over there are over 600,000 people in the main Monad server. It takes time to stand out and become recognizable. Ironically despite dozens of role across discords, I personally still do not have Full Access to the Main Monad Discord. But that's never going to stop me from doing my best. Put in the work and believe in yourself. Stay focused and determined, you have a whole community excited to meet you and root you on in your Monad journey.

I had a gift card in my wallet and decided to use it that day. After my wife and I were done looking at the menu, I went up to the cashier.

The cashier was a Russian lady with a thick accent, and I don't think she was in training. We told her our food and drink order, and I handed her the gift card. To my surprise, this turned out to be a problem. She took the card with a confused look.

She looked down at the card, bewildered, then back at me and said, ""What's this?""

A bit concerned, I replied, ""A gift card.""
She responded, ""What's a gift card?""

So, I had to spend some time explaining to her what a gift card was. I don't think she could understand me that quite well, nor could I understand what she was saying either. She then called over what I assumed was a supervisor and handed the card to them, trying to figure out what it was. Both of them had no idea.

After a bit of them looking at me, then back at the card, and talking to each other, a teenage girl who was making coffee behind them stopped what she was doing, took the card from them, and proceeded to complete my order. She then started explaining to the two of them what a gift card was.

I'm honestly shocked this even happened. Gift cards are, I think, used pretty frequently. For an employee not in training, and especially a supervisor, to not know what a gift card is? That’s just weird, shocking and mostly funny.",31,1745450827.0,mildlyinfuriating,5,0.86,False

I was fuming. I responded with “weird I haven’t posted a full body picture in a while” and of course she doesn’t respond. I don’t understand how people can not just say congratulations and move on…. Such disgusting and negative comments and coming from women who are moms themselves.

There was this guy leaving class about 20 mins early. And on his way out, he stopped at one of the back rows and started speaking to the girl in the aisle seat who he usually sits with in class (I assumed she was his girlfriend or friend.) He offered her some coffee and food he had presumably bought before class and kept insisting she take it even thought she was taking notes and kinda busy with class. She kept saying no. And then he stomped his feet rlly hard at the last few stairs, threw the food rlly aggressively in the trash, slammed the door loudly on his way out. To ensure that everyone, including her, knew and heard just how pissed he was.

I, along with another classmate, actually spoke to the girl after class and asked her if she was fine and if she needed to talk. I also asked her if she was in a relationship with him and she said no (although she could be too afraid to admit to it. She seemed kinda traditional.) I basically said she shouldn’t hang out with him and should feel free to reach out if she needs to.

But I’m still kinda concerned because she seems meek and she doesn’t seem like the kind who would speak out. And I’m worried that this behavior could escalate quickly.

But turns out, it barely lasts a month, she was just too toxic for me, never ran on her decisions, used to say ""meri dost keh rhi hai isliye main ye karungi"", desperate me used to apologise to her like 2-3 times a day, used to bring other guys in the convo (which I didn't mind sm back then) and eventually she asks to break up after a month(apparently her friend told her to). I too agreed for the best of my mental health. (I later found out she was in a situationship with someone else whilst being in a ""relationship"" with me)

1k6djlo,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskHR/comments/1k6djlo/co_misconduct_in_communication_with_coworkers/,[CO] Misconduct in communication with co-workers,"Hey Everyone -

I've been put on a paid suspension (now for nearly 2 weeks) pending investigation of inappropriate communication with co-workers. Essentially, two women, both of whom are in subordinate, supporting roles to me - but not direct reports, have gone to HR claiming that I have created a hostile work environment through my communication with them. Additionally, they're also claiming that I've made attempts to hang out with them out side of work.

Some Context:

My role: I'm an Account Executive in my mid-30's primarily responsible for generating new sales for a SaaS company that employs less than 200 people. I've been at the organization for two years and received two good annual reviews, with the most recent as ""exceeds expectations."" Last year I was the highest performing salesperson at the company and I'm frequently on the road representing the company at conferences and meeting with clients. I work remotely in Colorado and my company is based on the east coast.

Woman #1 - Let's call her Lisa. Lisa is in a sales support function in technical sales. She's been with the company for approximately a year. On a recent (a few weeks ago) call with a prospective client, she asked a rather uninformed question and pursued down a path of questioning that was, in my opinion, unfruitful. As such, I provided her direct feedback after the call that I would like to review questions with her first before we ask the client. This seemed like a reasonable request on my end as the AE ultimately owns the client relationship.

Lisa immediately got defensive and started saying that I was blocking her from doing her job. I tried to stay reasonable and asked multiple times for her to provide me a list of questions so we could work through it together, and any questions I could not answer, I'd forward to the client. But she stayed in her defensive state of mind. Eventually, frustrated, I mentioned that I could just pull her from the deal at this stage as I believe we could make progress with the client without a demo - which would be her primary contribution to the effort. She took that as a ""threat"" and stopped messaging me back.

A week later I was informed that HR was launching an investigation.

The allegations were, one: creating a hostile work place environment and two: predatory behavior in trying to seeking 1:1 meetings with women who were in subordinate roles. I was stunned by both, but especially, the second one. Lisa essentially suggested that I was seeking 1:1 connection with her outside of work and that she didn't feel comfortable explicitly saying ""no"" but would make up excuses because she thought it could be punitive to her career (reminder that I'm not her direct manager).

Lisa and I never previously had a contentious relationship at work and generally have been friendly. As such, occasionally when I'd travel to the mountain town she lived in, I'd ask her if we wanted to meet up. They've always been friendly requests (e.g. meeting at a public ski resort during the weekend to ski or meeting up at a coffee shop during working hours). However, we've never once actually linked up outside of work. She was once out of town, and once working on the mountain (side gig). On one occasion, she even suggested we meet for cycling in her town. In total, I made 3 attempts to see Lisa over the past year, and only when I was visiting her town. None were suggested as 1-on-1 ""dates.""

Lisa augmented her claim because she was aware I had a 1:1 dinner with Woman #2 - Let's call her Sue. Sue also supports the sales function and is in her first job out of college. Her primary responsibility is handling proposal responses. When she joined the team, I was visiting the city our company is HQ'd in and I invited a few people out to dinner. However, given that it was the Thursday before a long weekend, few folks were in the office and the only person who was available was Sue. She seemed on the fence about grabbing dinner, but she ultimately agreed. We grabbed a drink and dinner, chatted mostly about work and the industry we're in, and I estimate she was on her way home by 10:30PM. I made no sexual advances nor suggested any quid pro quo behavior. There is nothing that could have been misconstrued as inappropriate. In the following months there was no indication that Sue felt our interaction was inappropriate or crossed the line. The tension with her only began after she produced the first work product for me...

We had a healthy working relationship for her first 3 months on the job. However, during her first proposal response in support of one of my deals, she botched the execution close to the deadline. I received a draft, 2 days before the due date, that still needed 20-30 hours of work. I worked with my manager to clear schedules and take over the response drafting/finalization so we could get the proposal out the door in time and up to company standards. While I wasn't happy about the situation, I tried to work with Sue however she became standoffish declining my meetings and taking the inadequate work product feedback personally. Her response to this situation was to create a direct line of communication with our Sales VP. As such, she always had a way to circumvent working with me directly.

Over the next few months, our working relationship improved but it was never perfect. More so, I never spent time with Sue 1:1 again nor made any attempts to see her outside of work.

Sue also just announced that she has accepted another role outside the company.

I believe Lisa and Sue are struggling with work product feedback and instead of taking that feedback to improve and work collaboratively, they've opted to place me in their crosshairs as a scapegoat and set up a smokescreen with the quasi-harassment allegations.

I have cooperated with the HR investigation and supplied all supporting evidence that fights these allegations. In total, over 8 documents including Slack screenshots, email chains, and deal flow context. I've also asked HR to reach out to the broader group of folks I work with regularly to substantiate any such behavioral patterns. To my knowledge they have not conducted any other interviews.

Other important facts:  
\- I have successful working relationships with other women, younger and older in the work place; moreso the previous proposal lead was also the same demographic (younger woman, first job out of college) and we had a successful working engagement

\- I have no prior fact pattern of predatory behavior towards women nor creating a hostile work environment at this company or any other prior.

\- All the transactions that there have been consternations around have resulted in booked business for the company or business that is in the contracting process.

\- I've never formally complained about or brought up work product concerns for either Sue or Lisa directly to their managers. Only occasionally giving them direct feedback.

\- I have also never received any form of progressive discipline from the Company.

It has now been over a week since my interview with HR (and nearly two on the paid suspension). Based on what I've shared, am I missing something obvious? Do the accusers have a strong case that I'm blind to?

Today I found out that my ferritin is still low - 39. I was told to follow up with my hematologist (who I’ve seen about 10 times in the last two years.) I honestly feel so depressed because I’m just sooo over seeing doctors but getting nowhere. He told me a year ago that he treats it like cancer until it proves not to be.. so far, no one has found the cause. 

All other tests have been within normal range. Tested negative for arthritis, autoimmune diseases, and everything else. 

My daily diet consists of fruits, coffee, chicken, beans, veggies, oatmeal, peanut butter, etc. I don’t eat red meat, but I was told by many doctors that it wouldn’t cause consistently low ferritin, especially since my diet is mostly normal. Also, I don’t donate blood, I lift weight but not in excess. 

Do any of you have similar experiences? What ended up happening in your case? Thank you for any feedback you can give!

I'm an indie dev who went through a rough patch last year — I was diagnosed with cancer in October 2024 and had to put a lot of things on hold. During recovery, I poured my energy into creating a small project to stay sane and creative… and that project eventually became a full game called **Rotem**.

**Rotem** is a minimalist puzzle game built in Godot. It features 240 handcrafted image-based puzzles, including tile swapping, rotation, and a unique mode I call the “Rotem puzzle.” It’s meant to be relaxing, beautiful, and gently challenging — like something you can enjoy over coffee or late at night.

The art and music were both created using AI tools, which helped me focus more on gameplay while still keeping the vibe aesthetic and immersive.

**Steam page here:**  
[https://store.steampowered.com/app/3660540/Rotem/](https://store.steampowered.com/app/3660540/Rotem/)

I’d love your feedback, support, or just a share if you think someone you know might enjoy this kind of game. It's been a deeply personal project and getting it out into the world already feels like a win ❤️

Thanks for reading.

I started with cabbage soup : boiled cabbage with onions and garlic for flavor 

But now I just boil cabbage with salt, blend it to make a pureé, and eat it first thing in the morning. Since my stomach is empty at that time

Now I can even drink coffee, not too much though

With cabbage and God my stomach has healed

I do get some symptoms from time to time, when I decide to drink soda for example, then
I start eating the cabbage again and it's all gone

Hope this helps because I know how bad it is to not be able to sleep at night, or eat whatever you want

Not even 10 minutes later, my heart started racing to around 150bpm. It stayed like this for 12 hours, and after this I had difficulty breathing.

Fast forward months later, I'm still experiencing:

* Constant yawning (can't get enough air even when yawning)
* Persistent difficulty breathing that only stops when I sleep and reappears randomly after waking up
* Severe and CONSTANT dry mouth on awakening that has not gone away for a single day since the incident
* Occasional dizziness and light-headedness (feels like I'm going to faint)
* Initially had lack of appetite that resolved after a few weeks
* One random episode of feeling really cold

I had a 2-week period where symptoms disappeared completely, which occurred about 3 weeks after they began. Then I suddenly started getting a bad coughing fit 2 hours after waking up, and all symptoms returned.

My digestive system has also been affected, I've had alternating constipation and diarrhea, and recently noticed black specks (possibly seeds) in my stool.

I've been told this is probably anxiety, but I find it hard to believe since it's constant, every single day, and never happened before the alcohol incident. The only similar experience I've had is sometimes getting shortness of breath for a few hours after drinking coffee. My stress tolerance has drastically decreased, if I get even slightly scared, I feel like I'm going to faint.

Tests completed (all normal):

* Echocardiogram
* ECG
* Blood analysis
* Evaluation by a cardiologist who said symptoms are ""subjective""

Interestingly, two things have helped somewhat:

1. Probiotics seemed to improve my symptoms
2. A herbal supplement containing passion flower, valerian, lemon balm, California poppy, and melatonin also reduced symptoms

I've been looking into acetaldehyde sensitivity and the connection between alcohol, mucosal barrier damage, and chronic symptoms. Could this be a case where the alcohol triggered acetaldehyde buildup that damaged my mucosal barriers, leading to systemic effects including breathing issues and dry mouth?

I tried to start exercising to deal with the symptoms but could barely manage 2 minutes of HIIT on the first day. I also wake up with dry mouth every single morning.

Has anyone experienced anything similar or have any insights into this connection between alcohol, acetaldehyde, and persistent symptoms? What specialists should I see beyond cardiology?",2,1745450196.0,PanicAttack,0,1.0,False

A friend made a brisket and a couple weeks later I had some wine with a girlfriend, which equals sassy mischief. He told me to make my own brisket, and of course I responded with ""I will, and it'll be better than yours"". Which led into days of smack talking, which grew into a challenge, spread to several friends, and became a war. 

  
Winner gets a t-shirt and a crown from the other person, not to mention serious bragging. I then realized I'd never made a brisket, started researching, and $1200 later I had a Weber Smoky Mountain Cooker Smoker, a bunch of gear and a half brisket to do a test run. It's fueled by charcoal and wood chips. I decided to do a test brisket (half of one) a few weeks ago. It tasted good and had a nice bark, but the feedback from friends was it was a little dry and not as tender as my opponents.

  
The Brisket war is this Saturday (April 26) and I have a 30 lb. brisket I plan to brine tonight (Wednesday), then add dry rub tomorrow night (Thursday), and start smoking Friday at noon to be done by Saturday when it's good and ready, then rest for 2-3 hours. Below, I listed what I did for my test brisket and am looking for advice to make this the brisket that earns me a crown (not a tiara, a dang crown). 

Test Brisket Steps I used last time, but I NEED to improve this for juiciness and tenderness:  
Night before: trimmed fat and applied a dry rub of coarse salt, pepper, and garlic. Put trimmed fat and bacon grease in a crock pot overnight until fully melted, then strained through a cheese cloth (tallow).   
Morning at 5am: Removed brisket from fridge to rest on counter for 2 hours.  Started smoker with charcoal and wood chips.    
7am: Injected brisket with tallow and placed in smoker. 

Smoked brisket for 11 hours. After the first 3 hours I started to spray it every 45-60 minutes with a mix of Worcestershire, coffee, and water to create a nice bark. \*\*\*I had A LOT of difficulty getting the temperature of the smoker up to 225, it was cooked at 180 for the majority of this process. At about 5 hours, it stalled.   
\-I removed the brisket and wrapped in butcher paper, then put back in the smoker. Continued to struggle to get heat past 180. I cooked it for another 4 hours while wrapped, still struggling to get temperature past 180.  

I started really laying on wood chips and cardboard to get a better flame and got the heat up to 215. Unwrapped brisket and cooked 2 more hours until it finally reached internal temp of 202. Removed from the smoker and left wrapped on the counter for an hour before slicing. It did have a great bark, just a bit salty in my opinion but others liked it. 

\*\*\*Major concerns: 

1. How do I make it juicier and fall apart tender? 

2. Am I missing something in this process?

3. How do I get the heat of the smoker up or is it okay to plan on cooking it longer at the lower temp of 180? With a 30lb brisket (pre-trim) how many hours should I plan?

5. Should I inject more than once, or just once prior to putting in the smoker?

6. What is the best way to rest a brisket? I heard sticking it in a cooler tends to make it tougher as it continues to cook with the trapped heat. 

7. Any recommendations of charcoal briquettes and wood chips? I didn't have a charcoal chimney starter, so I spread them along the bottom and topped with wood chips. Had to refill every couple hours, but really struggled to keep heat of smoker up. 

Any and all advice would be appreciated. ",0,1745449923.0,smoking,8,0.4,False

So this morning my cockatiel stopped using his left foot entirely. There's no sign of injury on his foot, but he cannot open or close it very well. He woke me up early this morning falling from one of his branches, which he's been out of his cage sitting on a stand next to me or on me all day. His condition hasn't worsened, but based on vibes alone I think he's now needing extra care. He's eating and drinking and his poop looks fine, but I think his age is finally getting to him and he needs some extra help now.

Do you guys have any tips on how to care for a elderly bird in his condition? He cleans himself just fine, but his lack of balance may make it hard for him to clean his tail feathers in the future. Is there any way to help him? 

I plan to set up a small area for him to safely sleep nearby so that I can assist him if he needs anything, and prevent him from falling from a great height in his cage. Are there any recommendations for set-ups? 

Along with this, are there any ways to make sure his spirit stays up? I usually take him outside to drink coffee every morning in the backyard, he listens to music while I'm at school, and we spend the evening watching TV together every day, but is there any extra things I can do for him now that his movement is more impaired? I don't want him to get bored.

Any other tips you all have are greatly appreciated. I would love to give everything I can for this guy, since he pretty much raised me. I owe this little old man everything. Thanks.",2,1745449787.0,cockatiel,7,1.0,False

/r/mildlyinfuriating is an image based subreddit to share things that infuriated you, but only mildly, however, it tends to get more posts of things actually *extremely* infuriating or pure WTF based.

# OP’s post

OP [shares an image of them working in a fast food restaurant,](https://www.reddit.com/r/mildlyinfuriating/s/Cyk2Edv06v ) where they received a drive-thru order of 20 chicken tender sandwiches. When an order is very large, an employee will usually direct the customer to park in a space nearby in order to allow the restaurant to continue taking and making other orders along with the big one.

In this case, OP states the customer *refused* to drive to a spot, causing the drive-thru to come to a complete standstill.

[Not parking is asshole behavior:](https://www.reddit.com/r/mildlyinfuriating/s/byHJzkPepj)

> My dad would do stuff like this. If they asked him to pull ahead he would just say no. I am lucky to not have taken after him as far as lack of empathy.
> 
> This is just one example of a pattern of asshole behavior.

> How is it a lack of empathy? *[downvoted]*

> I guess just not caring that you’re going to be holding other people up from getting their food.

> He’s not holding up anyone, the employees are. If there are 4 other complete orders waiting to be given out, why weren’t those other people making those orders, focusing on assisting with the 1 larger order? *[more downvotes]*

> I’m thinking more like if someone ordered chicken sandwiches and they had to wait for those but if there are hamburgers ready to go sitting in the warmer. So if the person behind them had food orders that were ready to go. And then these days if you order on an app your order may be bagged and ready so if someone refuses to pull up your food is just sitting there.

> Sounds like all the app orders need to be picked up in the lobby and not the drive through. *[downvoted again]*

> Are you the one who placed this order and refused to pull forward? 😂 You are really trying hard to justify asshole behavior.

> Nope. But I also have no problem with it either. Fast food needs to be fast.

[Calling out the above user:](https://www.reddit.com/r/mildlyinfuriating/s/I7nnV72e1d)

> I don’t think you have any clue whatsoever about how food service works.

> I do.
> 
> I order. You make it. That’s literally your only job. Make the order that’s on the screen, put it in a bag and move onto the next order. You’re literally being paid to follow instructions on a screen.

> So if you could then explain to everyone in the audience how 4 people would all work on producing a bunch of the same item on a station that only allows for 2 people to work it that would be great.
> 
> You think the lady behind you ordering a coffee and a muffin are cutting into the time it takes to make your 25 burgers?  It doesn’t.  They cannot all be working on the same production.  There isn’t room for that.

> You’re talking about spacing and personnel See how there are a bunch of completed sandwiches just sitting there? Why hasn’t even 1 sandwich been wrapped up or put into a bag? Is the person prepping the only person in the entire restaurant that can wrap and put into a bag?
> 
> Why are they waiting until all 20 are complete to bag them?

> You replied to someone speaking of a completely unrelated incident about their father, not OP, it was a general comment about people refusing to pull forward when asked, not about this specific scenario.

[OP is the mildly infuriating one here:](https://www.reddit.com/r/mildlyinfuriating/s/BOOVG7E7FT)

> Make sure to stop working, take a picture and complain before you finish the order though. Yes, mildly infuriating. *[downvoted]*

> It takes like 5 seconds to take a picture. We also have this amazing technology that stores that picture on a device so you can later post it online.

> Guess I’m just different. I would have finished the order first at least.

> You aren't different, you're just wanting to complain about something. That picture took 5 seconds, that order probably took 10+ minutes.

[Cancel an order that huge:](https://www.reddit.com/r/mildlyinfuriating/s/VZGtFXYkCU)

> THEN DO NOT SERVE THEM IF THEY CAN NOT FOLLOW SIMPLE DIRECTIONS AT A FAST FOOD RESTAURANT!!

> And what do you do with the 16 ish sandwiches that are already made?

> Have you ever heard of a no sale? Or return... or refund... or the most likely outcome would be that one person moves their damn car.... or they could just say fuck em and cancel the order and issue a refund (likely to a card)

> It shows about 16 or so sandwiches already made. Give him the sandwiches that were ready and refund for the rest. Call 911 and get the license #. My boss would show me the door if I threw away unpaid product. Btw, how are those anger management classes going for ya.

[No park, no food:](https://www.reddit.com/r/mildlyinfuriating/s/JXpTW2YH1s)

> Then they don't get their food.

> Maybe not in your imaginary world but in real world they are obviously getting their food.

> If they don't want to listen to the rules they can go someplace else. Wtf are you on *[downvoted]*

> The post is literally a photo of the food being made for them. They didn’t go somewhere else and they are getting their food.

> I meant if I was the manager and the customer refused to pull forward. Obviously the food is being made and being served in the photo. *[downvoted again]*

A right and sane mind would never think about the whole Gwen adjustments and I honestly think riot has some good shit in their coffees everyday. 

I do love Gwen, everything about her, expect for her kit. It’s so stupid just make her a hyperscaler again and end this bullshit.   

Please please just revert idgaf about anything else. I can’t believe rito is making a loyal fan base stop playing Gwen because of this shitass shinanigans. 

And finally, I say this with full respect but phroxzon, I hope you get fired ASAP and I hope you never touch or go near the gaming industry. As a game developer and data scientist myself, I’m gonna be clear but ur decision making is just poor, off the mark and unprofessional. 

Phroxzon, go work at construction sites now.
