1mm87ol,https://www.reddit.com/r/bodylanguage/comments/1mm87ol/is_this_something_what_do_i_do/,Is this something? What do i do?,"Last summer I did an internship with a few other interns. We were given assigned seats and I was seated across from this one guy. At that point I had been in a relationship for a few months. Me and this guy I was interning with became friends pretty quickly, as we worked long hours, and would pick up dinner's together, help eachother with problems at work and just talk about whatever throughout the day. From the start we always had a lot of good banter and to this day are always kind of making fun of eachother/teasing. I never really thought of him as more than a friend last summer bc of my relationship, even though there were moments where I felt a little spark, times when he would go out of his way/offer to help me, or a time he got really flustered when a barista at a coffee shop said to him “isn’t she gorgeous.”
It is now a year later though and something feels different. We just started full time at this job, and while I am still in the same relationship, I find myself feeling attracted to this other guy I have been friends with. We still make playful banter at eachother, but it feels different than before, and I have noticed my girlfriends picking up on how close we are as friends.
A few days ago me, him, and a couple friends went clubbing. I always felt like he was nearby to me, and when a random guy came up to me to talk to me he was nearby and when I got out of the convo he said “we should’ve had a signal, it would make me so annoyed if someone did that to my girlfriend."" Idk i took notice of that especially, bc my boyfriend has never cared much about other guys approaching me, in the sense that he feels there is nothing for him to feel insecure about.
Later as we were walking to another bar, random people on the street yelled at us that we should be a couple and we looked great together, and we both immediately awkwardly kinda walked away from eachother and tried to ignore the comment. I have noticed whenever we talk I feel like we end up grazing hands or knees a lot and there is always pretty intense eye contact. At the end of the night he texted me ""text me when u are home safe,"" which i'm probs reading into.
He knows I am in a relationship, and I am not sure if I am just creating something out of nothing. I also know that thinking about any of this is unfair to my boyfriend. My boyfriend and I have been having some long term challenges in our relationship that actually can't be resolved, and I can't help but wonder if this is just another sign we should end things? Maybe I am overthinking? Is this guy interested in me or am I just creating something out of nothing? I am in a relationship with a guy that I really do care about, but I feel like I havent been able to get my intern friend off my mind.

I'm having it now and it is heavenly! Made with a specialty coffee base and Michelin-star ingredients like hazelnut, rose, vanilla, and black sugar syrup, it offers a taste that’s anything but ordinary.

The smooth texture effortlessly glides over your palate, and unlike some commercial lattes which are so milky that you hardly taste the coffee at all (*shame on you, Starbucks!*), the coffee flavour is allowed to shine through.

The hazelnut and rose work in harmony with the coffee, enhancing it without overwhelming, while the brown sugar syrup adds the perfect amount of sweetness, balanced by a touch of vanilla for a luxurious finish.

For coffee lovers who appreciate complexity, depth, and nuance, this latte is a game-changer. It’s indulgent without being over the top. Highly recommended!

Yes, you saw the title right. My name is Maeve Corinth and I work for the stereotypical “shadow government” who hides conspiracies and secrets from the billions of people that live in the world. Hollow Earth is real, 9/11 was executed by the government, and there are lizards and aliens underneath the Denver Airport.  
Now most of you may be asking, why did I choose this? Well I didn’t necessarily choose it but was more so recruited for it. My parents, well my dad started working for it, so he thought it would be nice to have it run in the family, I guess. Now honestly, I love hiding conspiracies. And I like who I work with. Most days. 

Sometimes we have to remote control someone's mind, other times terminate their memory. With no repercussions, sometimes. Other times, my boss, Andrew, is an ass and gets on me and my team about it.

For example, when my co-worker said that the earth was flat to a coffee barista. Yeah, everyone in there spat out their oatmilk lattes, jaws dropped to the floor. We had to get a team in there to wipe their memories of that, which is so annoying sometimes. 

Or when someone once said that our green screen for the moon landing scene broke at work because Andy had a rage fit.Let's just say the higher-ups had words with Andy, and so did I.  

Now you're probably wondering, since I keep mentioning the word ""team"", you're probably wondering who's part of it. 

The Shadow Dream Team: 

Amanda- sassy but bossy, tries to cover up any conspiracies around 9/11 or flat earth 

Josh- an asshole, literally just disses off everyone in the office, even stood up to Andy once. Tough move, but I respect him for it. 

Conrad (I call him Con)-usually high off something, probably half the time using something to get someone to forget their worries, ""relax man""

Sloan- part slenderman (none of us know what happened to her except she got lured out to the woods by some weird freak), always has her face covered and dresses particularly nice, covers up celebrity reincarnation 

Yep. I work with these people on a 9-5 basis, 7 days a week, 365 days a year until the end of time. I honestly don't know how I put up with them every day, but I do and it's exhausting. 

So that's the first out of a lot about me. Log 1, finished.

P.S. Wipe the computer disc if Josh touches this. I don't know what's going on with him.",1,1754796374.0,creepcast,0,1.0,False

This morning, at precisely 6:02 a.m., the High Chair Syndicate convened. The boss (Don Drool-io) sat at the head of the table in his dinosaur pajamas, sippy cup in hand like a loaded weapon.



The agenda?

Item 1: Demand warm milk now, not after coffee.

Item 2: Reinstate cookie service at 6:45 a.m. sharp.

Item 3: Full pardon for all crayon-related wall art.

When I hesitated, his enforcer  (Babyface Biscuit) tipped his high chair back and gave me the kind of slow head shake you only see in mob movies. I caved instantly.

I delivered the milk. I delivered the cookies. I delivered my dignity on a plastic Paw Patrol plate.

1mm84r9,https://www.reddit.com/r/hometheater/comments/1mm84r9/mixing_subwoofers_ported_and_sealed_the_biggest/,Mixing subwoofers? Ported and sealed? The biggest sin in Home Theater history? Maybe not? Results inside.,"I know this is considered a sin, but I don't really have too many options.   
My open floor plan has a 9ft wide wall for my front sound stage. Left of that there is a long hallway. On the right side is a conveniently (....NOT) placed front door that we don't use.   
I barely have enough space for two small subwoofers between the front speakers and the tv stand. The biggest issue is the depth, so changing the tv stand to even smaller one wouldn't achieve anything. We do not use the door, but we still need some space between the coffee table and TV stand.   
I ended up finding some rare and imho really cool Klipsch subs that I was able to snatch very cheap. (msrp was $1600 each, and I got them for 250 each!, new but open box) These are the c310aswi subs which are not exactly sealed since they have passive radiators so they are closer in terms of phase rotation to the ported subs, so the title is somewhat a clickbait. I am mixing a large ported sub and two smaller subs with passive radiators. Not sealed.   
Both ported and PR subs (passive radiator) have a steep 180 degree phase rotation near their tuning frequency, while sealed subs have a 90 degree phase rotation that happens more gradually. Unfortunately, I don't actually have a way of testing true sealed and ported subwoofer mixing.   
Mixing actual ported and sealed subs might be harder, with worse results.

What you gonna see on the image below:  
First, the rp1400sw by itself. There are some HUGE dips or nulls because of the hallway. I have measured the sub in the front right location and [it looked fine](https://imgur.com/rYFTX6d).  
Second: both small subs individually.   
Third: Comparing the rp1400sw vs both small subs combined.   
Fourth:  3 subs playing together without any Parametric EQ.   
There is a big peak around 46 hz area, so on the   
Fifth split image: you can see I have applied some PEQ to those subs. (Yes.. These Klipsch subs have a mobile app like SVS does!)  
6th image, you can see the final results with PEQ applied to small sub (red) and the original combined spl without PEQ. (green)  
7th image shows the 46hz peak is present because of the rp1400sw itself. I have removed enough that the two small subwoofer would add to the total SPL in this region using the PEQ filters.   
I will also play around with the Low pass filter for the 2 subs to have them roll them off earlier. Maybe even lower the LPF to 100hz or apply more PEQ in the 90hz region. I don't think It  needs too much fiddling, to be honest.

By the way, the system sounds crazy. Almost overwhelming even though I calibrated and level matched everything. I almost feel like my lungs are being shaken or massaged while watching a movie, and I have a weird sensation even when there is no bass playing.  Hard to explain. And this sub doesn't even go under 15hz.  People say they love their big subs going to single digits and how infrasonic sounds just shake them. It's already a weird sensation for me, and I am not %100 if I would like more of this. 

If anyone needs help with multiple subwoofer calibration, I[ made a guide here](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1cStcDWXE2LHJzNmhCrbIW0Zo82kXpLh5x5JgJ0Ui4sU/edit?usp=drive_link).  
Working on a video too, but it's not allowed to post your own video on here... I think it's rather crazy that you can't post a helpful video if you made it yourself, but I understand mods don't want everyone to spam post about their YT videos.

## FAQs Section

**What are the best wax types for decorative candles?**

Soy wax, beeswax, and coconut wax are considered the best wax types for decorative candles. Soy wax is a sustainable and renewable resource, offering a clean and even burn with excellent fragrance throw. Beeswax is a natural wax that produces a bright, clean flame and releases negative ions to purify the air. Coconut wax is another eco-friendly option known for its slow burn and ability to hold a high fragrance load.**how do I ensure a long and even burn for my decorative candle?**

To ensure a long and even burn for your decorative candle, trim the wick to ¼ inch before each use to prevent smoking and uneven burning. Allow the candle to burn for at least two hours during the first use to create a full melt pool across the surface. This prevents tunneling and ensures that the candle burns evenly down the sides. Avoid burning the candle for more than four hours at a time to prevent overheating.

**Can I reuse the container of my decorative candle after the candle has burned out?**

Yes, you can absolutely reuse the container of your decorative candle after the candle has burned out. Clean out any remaining wax by placing the container in the freezer for a few hours, then gently remove the frozen wax. Wash the container with soap and water to remove any residue. You can then repurpose the container as a decorative storage jar, a planter for small plants, or a stylish desk organizer.

**How do I choose the right scent for my space?**

Choosing the right scent for your space depends on your personal preferences and the desired ambiance. For a relaxing bedroom, consider calming scents like lavender, chamomile, or sandalwood. For a lively living room, opt for invigorating scents like citrus, ocean breeze, or fresh linen. For a cozy dining area, try warm and inviting scents like vanilla, cinnamon, or baked goods. Experiment with different scents to find what works best for you and your space.

i’m really scared that my teeth are going to fall out and i’m only 25. i need to go for my bi yearly cleaning in a month and i’m scared my dentist is going to tell me that all my teeth are done for, or will be done for in the next five years. even though i don’t bleed when i brush/floss like i used to, i just can’t help but shake the feeling that my teeth are bad. i already have a lot of recession from overbrushing. it makes me wake up in a panic and sometimes i end up crying. i started taking care of my teeth and i feel like it’s not enough, it’ll never be enough, and all my effort was for nothing. i don’t know if it’s all in my head or if i have some serious gum disease / gingivitis. i spend my time in the mirror a lot obsessing over my teeth. i can’t even enjoy sweets anymore out of fear that it’s going to make my teeth worse.

dentists of reddit, i am wondering how i can improve my oral hygiene from what these pictures show. are my teeth that bad? okay? could be better? anything to ensure that all my teeth aren’t going to fall out? i’m almost resigned to the idea that i’ll end up getting dentures at 30. please help.

Example: You want a simple cocktail bar caption? GPT will hit you with:   
*“Cocktails that refresh and tell a story, whether you’re winding down after work or celebrating the night ahead…”*

  
Example 2: ""Create a caption for running shoes post""  
AI: ""Every step tells a story. Whether you're conquering your morning jog or chasing your marathon dreams...""

This has become so common that everyone almost sounds the same and predictable. To me, I view it as the famous GPT hyphen (—), a sign that screams 'AI wrote this.'

  
**When Did Everything Become a ""Story""?**  
The 'storytelling' wave in marketing took off in the early to mid-2010s when brands realized emotional hooks worked better. When AI tools started training on billions of marketing texts, this narrative style got baked into their DNA. As a result, most AIs often defaults to these story arcs.

**The problem: It's everywhere now!**  
This template has become so overused that every product supposedly ""tells a story,"" and almost everyone is now a storyteller or actively storytelling. 

**How to fix it:**  
Be more specific on your prompts. Instead of asking ""Write a caption for my coffee shop,"" try this instead: ""Write a direct, energetic caption for my coffee shop. Skip the storytelling. Focus on taste and quality. Keep it under 15 words.""  
The more specific your prompt, the less generic your output. Tell the AI exactly what tone, length, and style you want, and what clichés to avoid.",0,1754795771.0,ChatGPT,1,0.5,False

I want to tell you about a life. I've been writing it all down, piece by piece, because it's a life we should have lived. I saw us in Egypt, standing by the pyramids as the sun turned the sky to fire. We were laughing, dusted with sand, our hands clasped together, and I could feel a future stretched out before us. I saw us in a small, warm house, the scent of fresh coffee in the air, holding our firstborn child. I remember how you looked, the awe on your face as their tiny hand wrapped around your finger. And I remember watching you, our faces wrinkled with the memories of a thousand laughs, as we grew old together. It was a beautiful life, full of love, adventure, and joy.

I'm telling you this not because it happened, but because it didn't. I spent the last years of my life imagining it, dreaming of a future that never came. I was here, waiting, while you were over there, too busy being angry about things that didn't matter. I waited for you to let go of your anger and join me in living the rest of our lives. But you never did.

Now I'm gone. I'm not traveling the world, holding our child, or growing old with you. I'm just a memory, and you're left with nothing but regret.

The truth is, life doesn't wait for you to be ready. It doesn't pause for your anger, your pride, or your hurt. It just keeps going, and if you're not careful, you'll miss it. You'll miss the moments that matter, the people who love you, and the life you were meant to live. Don't let your anger steal your future. Don't let it steal your joy. Don't let it steal your lover. Don't let it steal your life.

---

This piece is a reflection of a deep-seated feeling, a testament to how even in fiction, we often find our own truth. It began years ago, a jumble of emotions in my heart, in the quiet aftermath of a near-death experience. I was left to navigate that difficult time alone, without a friend I thought I could count on. That feeling of absence, and the ""what if,"" never really left.

Recently, a new inspiration opened that old wound, and this story just flowed out. This isn't my reality, but it's an exploration of the painful questions of an unlived life—a way to process a longing that words alone couldn't capture.

Sometimes, the most meaningful stories aren't the ones we live, but the ones we create to make sense of what we've lost, what we stand to lose, and what happens when we stand by and find that regret was all that remained.

No VC money, no team—just me, some coffee, and a borderline unhealthy relationship with ChatGPT.

The idea was simple: take AI-generated text (which most people use raw) and make it sound like a human actually wrote it. I didn’t even think it’d take off—figured maybe a few students or copywriters would use it.

Fast forward and it’s now sitting at $7k MRR. No crazy ads, just organic traffic, word of mouth, and a handful of Reddit comments here and there. I still host it on a pretty cheap setup.

Honestly, I call it “AI slop” because under the hood, it’s not that pretty. But people don’t care—they care about the results.

If you’re building a SaaS, here’s what worked for me:

* **Solve a pain people actually have** (in my case, AI detection killing people’s work).
* **Ship ugly, fix later.** I didn’t wait until it was “perfect.”
* **Hang out where your users are.** Reddit, Discord, niche forums.
* **Give them a quick win**—if they can try it and see value in 30 seconds, they’ll stick around.

I averaged near a 22% tip rate at 2 different serving jobs. I also took a job as a barista. I’ve been seeing things pop up about tipping lately and had some input. This is a bit of rant, but I wanted to tell someone!

I provided SERVICE. I was attentive. If someone’s water got below 1/2, I was refilling it. Within a couple minutes of a plate being finished, it was removed from the table. I checked on my tables, I got the correct orders to the correct spots EVERY time. Not asking who got what. The food would arrive and within 30 seconds I was checking on them to ensure they didn’t need anything and I’d check back again a couple minutes later (because people start eating and forget to ask for something) then I’m available, I’m walking around and watching the tables and I want to be available if anyone needs me. I tried to be friendly and attentive without being overbearing. I updated them on when their food should be coming up. I was always requested. Why? Because I gave a crap about what I was doing. I cared about people’s experience. It’s what a SERVER does. They SERVE.

It’s crazy that people just EXPECT 20%+ doing the bare minimum. Being a server, it wasn’t always easy. I get it. BUT, it’s SERVICE industry. So….SERVE. Create a welcoming environment and create a good experience.

I rarely get the type of service I was giving and i could honestly care less if society has put it the standard at 20%. I’m not tipping 20% for doing so much less than I would have done in the same position. Tipping in my eyes should be a motivator for someone else to earn more, in turn, put in more effort and work harder.

Even working in the coffee shop, I learned everything I could. I made latte art and made sure my shots were poured exactly how it was supposed to taste. Not bitter. Not acidic. I wanted my milk frothed exactly how it was supposed to. It’s wild that’s not the standard.

No tipping is silly though. Especially at a restaurant. It’s the way it is and not tipping is hurting those in the service industry. tip accordingly and use your best judgment. But if they don’t deserve 20% don’t do 20%.",15,1754795098.0,tipping,15,0.94,False

The selection of a large ornamental bowl frequently enough hinges on several key features that influence both its aesthetic appeal and functional suitability.

**Material Composition:** The material from which an ornamental bowl is crafted substantially impacts its durability, visual characteristics, and overall value. Common materials include ceramic, glass, metal (such as brass or copper), wood, and even composite materials. Each material offers a distinct aesthetic; for example, ceramic bowls frequently enough offer intricate detailing and vibrant colors, while glass bowls provide a sense of transparency and lightness. metal bowls can project a modern or rustic appeal depending on their finish and texturing. The choice of material should align with the desired aesthetic and the intended use of the bowl.

**Size and Dimensions:** Large ornamental bowls typically range from 12 inches to over 24 inches in diameter and can vary in height depending on the design. Accurate consideration of the bowl's size is crucial to ensure it fits appropriately within the intended space and serves its purpose effectively.A bowl that is too small may appear insignificant, while one that is excessively large might overwhelm the surrounding decor.Furthermore, the depth of the bowl is a vital factor to consider, especially if it's intended for displaying items such as fruit or decorative objects.

**Design and Style:** The design of an ornamental bowl is arguably the moast significant aspect, as it dictates its aesthetic appeal and its capacity to complement the existing décor. Design styles can range from classic and customary, featuring ornate embellishments and intricate patterns, to modern and minimalist, characterized by clean lines and understated elegance.

**Finish and Texture:** The finish and texture of an ornamental bowl play an integral role in its visual impact and tactile experience. Finishes can range from glossy and reflective to matte and textured. A glossy finish tends to accentuate the bowl's color and shape, while a matte finish imparts a sense of sophistication and subtlety. The texture can also vary considerably, from smooth and polished surfaces to rough and tactile ones. The choice of finish and texture should complement the material of the bowl and the overall design aesthetic.**Weight and Stability:** The weight and stability of a large ornamental bowl are crucial considerations,especially if it's intended for displaying heavy items or positioning in high-traffic areas. A heavier bowl is less likely to be accidentally knocked over, ensuring the safety of both the bowl itself and anything displayed within it. The base of the bowl should be designed to provide a stable foundation, preventing wobbling or tipping.

**Craftsmanship and Quality:** The craftsmanship of an ornamental bowl is a direct reflection of its overall quality and durability. Bowls crafted with meticulous attention to detail, using high-quality materials and employing skillful techniques, are more likely to withstand the test of time and retain their aesthetic appeal.Identifying indicators of quality craftsmanship, such as precise detailing, seamless joints, and a consistent finish, is key to selecting an ornamental bowl that represents a worthwhile investment.

## FAQs Section

**What is the best material for a large ornamental bowl if I want it to be durable and easy to clean?**
durable and easy-to-clean options typically include ceramic, metal, and certain types of glass. Ceramic bowls are often resistant to scratches and chips and can be easily wiped clean with a damp cloth. Metal bowls, such as those made from stainless steel or aluminum, are highly durable and resistant to corrosion. Tempered glass bowls are also relatively durable and easy to clean, although they may be more susceptible to breakage than ceramic or metal.

**How do I choose the right size of ornamental bowl for my coffee table?**
Consider the size of your coffee table and the surrounding decor. Generally, a bowl that takes up approximately one-third to one-half of the table's surface area is a good starting point. Measure the table's dimensions and visualize different bowl sizes to ensure the proportions are balanced. Avoid selecting a bowl that is too large, as it may overwhelm the space, or too small, as it may appear insignificant.

**Can I use a large ornamental bowl to display fresh flowers?**
Yes, many large ornamental bowls can be used to display fresh flowers; however, you need to ensure the bowl is watertight or use a separate container inside to hold the water for the flowers. choose a bowl with a wide opening to accommodate the flower stems and consider the bowl's depth to ensure it provides adequate support for the flowers.Regularly change the water to prolong the life of the flowers and prevent bacterial growth.

**How do I care for a large ornamental bowl to ensure it lasts for many years?**
The care requirements for an ornamental bowl depend on its material. For ceramic bowls, avoid using abrasive cleaners or scrub brushes that could scratch the surface. Metal bowls should be cleaned with a soft cloth and a mild detergent, avoiding harsh chemicals that could damage the finish. Glass bowls can be cleaned with a glass cleaner and a soft cloth, taking care to avoid dropping or bumping them. Regularly dust the bowl to prevent the buildup of dirt and grime and store it in a safe place when not in use.

1mm7r1o,https://www.reddit.com/r/Prague/comments/1mm7r1o/does_anyone_know_antonio_b/,Does anyone know Antonio B?,"Not sure if this is allowed, but worth a shot. 

Back in June, I caught my wife sexting her ex. Things got bad. Then they got worse. Back then, I thought they couldn’t get worse than they had. I was wrong. 

We had been trying for reconciliation. She said she wanted to. Stringing me on. We also have a five (almost six year-old).

Tonight. She went outside for a walk with a mutual friend of ours and our kids and… I guess she was a bit drunk because she left her phone behind. Unusual since she’s been guarding it like a hawk lately. She never changed the password though.  Maybe she wanted to get caught again?!

Anyway. When I got home I texted to see when they were all coming back and I heard the phone buzz in the kitchen. I went over to it and there were two messages in notifications. Mine and some guy saved in her phone as “Antonio B.”

I didn’t click the message to see his number but I wish I had. 

When she came back I said, “someone named Antonio wants to know what you’re doing now.” She absolutely flipped out on me. Told me it was totally inappropriate that I looked at her phone. This is typical of cheaters. They deflect and want to shame you because they know they’re busted. 

Eventually, she admits… some of it. She’s been chatting with “Antonio B.” for months. It started EVEN BEFORE I caught her sexting with her ex back in June and our lives blew up the first time. 

She said “Antonio B.” has no idea I exist. She said they haven’t kissed or slept together. That they met once for coffee somewhere. 

She said he travels a lot for work. 

She wouldn’t tell me where or how they met. 

I had to get my kid to bed and, when I came back, she was in the process of deleting his text and contact and even WhatsApp altogether. Then she changed her passcode… 

Her iCloud stuff was all under my name so I got into the phone. But I wasn’t able to get his number back. She had turned off iCloud backup. 

Seems I can’t attach photos here but the one I took of his WhatsApp profile pic is a bit blurry. 

He’s got short brown-ish hair. Wears prescription glasses and has a mustache and maybe a soul patch under his bottom lip. He looks… vaguely Pedro Pascal-ish to me. He’s got on a v-neck tee on in the pic that’s either yellow or white. 

Familiar to anyone? I know it’s a long-shot. 

To be very clear: I have nothing against this guy. If what she says is true, and he really doesn’t know I exist, then I’d just like to make him aware. Because if that’s the case, she’s been lying to him (or lying by omission) to him too. For months now. 

Frankly, I’d also like to try to cancel him as an option for her (if he’s a decent person) so I’d like him to know who (and what) she is: A liar and a cheat. 

DM if you might know him. I can share the photo and tell you my wife’s first name (it’s a fairly common Czech name).

I’m off now to figure out how to salvage my son’s life and my life after all this deception. Fortunately I already talked to a lawyer after the last DDay.

I've posted here before and had a few fun and interesting chats, but I'm still looking for a real connection. Anything real or worthwhile is hard to find in the sea of ""fakeness"" these days. That goes for real life and on dating apps. There's a lot of people who like to ghost and not say anything. It's unfortunate that a lot of people are so fake but I'm holding out hope that I can meet the right person either IRL or online eventually. :)

**About me:**

I'm a 30 year old average looking white dude with an average physique from North Carolina. I'm not hellbent on staying here either. I look pretty young and still get carded all the time, lol. College educated with a bachelors degree, a decent career in sales and own my own business. No debt or kids & financially responsible, but I love to have fun too.

I love camping/hiking and traveling! I think I've been to over 30 states! I love listening to music & playing PC games. I also enjoy reading and listening to audiobooks/podcasts. I would like to get a motorcycle at some point. I'm pretty easygoing generally. I'm also open to trying any new hobbies with my partner that they'd like to introduce me to. I enjoy going to food festivals and trying new types of food too. One day, I'd like to have a house in the mountains with a few acres of land that is completely paid off. I've also thought about figuring out how to work from home and do the whole camper van travelling thing and work from my laptop. Have a streak of free-spirted energy in me I guess. I'm 420 friendly but I don't really partake with the exception of the rare edible a few times per year just to relax.

Honestly I am a pretty social and goofy guy. I would describe myself as an ambivert. INTJ, dry/dark sense of humor, I love making people laugh when I can. A bit nerdy at times, mainly about PC games and history.

**What I'm looking for:**

I am looking to connect with someone worthwhile and sane between the ages of 22-35 with no kids. Preferably inside the USA! I like text chatting but calling is ideal and better in my opinion. Obviously I don't expect you to call me right away but it's a much better way of actually getting to know someone. Which if we aren't doing that, then what are we doing?

I am a very dedicated and affectionate person in relationships, and really try my best even though I am nowhere near perfect. (Not even close.) I try to understand the other person I'm with to the best of my ability and be thoughtful and caring. I just want to find something peaceful with someone one day. I love hugs.

I want to be around someone who gives me peace and to be able to sit around a campfire with you sipping coffee and making smores or having a picnic having a deep hearty laugh. Maybe play video games together too. I'd love to feel completely comfortable around you. I would like to get to know eachother on a deeper level than ever before, if it feels right. I'd like to find someone who is okay with me showing emotions even though I am a guy. Someone I could take on cute dates and treat well. At this phase I am dating with intent. Honestly just looking for my best friend that I haven't met yet.

I would like to one day find the person I am meant to be with, and if there are things wrong, we can fix them together hopefully.

Anyway, that should give you a good taste of what you're in for if you decide to reach out. If you like the sounds of any of this, shoot me a message and we'll chat. :)",0,1754794801.0,R4R30Plus,0,0.5,False

WTF?","From the very beginning when I met my ex, she used to invite me over to have cake with her and her friends. Anyway, some time passed and we did a video call she didn’t want to show herself, she never did, always saying her hair was messy. Later, I ended up finding out (according to her) that she had autism. Our conversations were kind of one-sided. We planned to meet at the park once, but she canceled, saying she had hurt her leg.

She told me I was treating her differently because she had told me about her autism. She also said her ex had abandoned her, that she had been seeing some guy who replaced her for someone else. One day, after I got mugged, I almost lost her number and the funny thing is, she didn’t seem to care. She was kind of indifferent and even said she wouldn’t text me unless I texted her first. She would tell me about her cats, and about how her nephews also had autism. She once got really mad when her cousin said she used to drink with her ex.

After a while, I invited her to the movies because she had said we never went out anywhere. At first, she said she wouldn’t go because she was embarrassed. After I insisted, she agreed, but the next day she suddenly said, “Wouldn’t it be better if we were just friends?” Anyway, we still went to the movies. We met there, bought candy, kissed during the film, and spent the afternoon being romantic.

She never let me see her phone and was always very withdrawn. She wouldn’t even give me her Instagram, only sharing it after we broke up. After the movie, she went home. Another time, we went to the mall and she gave me chocolate. We ended up going to a motel, and when we got there she said she was embarrassed and couldn’t have the lights on. I told her it was fine, but she quickly became reactive and her mood changed. We stayed there for a while and then went home.

Before that, we had gone to the park and were being affectionate, and when she was about to head home, I walked her. The strange thing is she made it pretty obvious she didn’t want me to meet her family. I still went with her and then left. Another time, her sister came to drop her off at my place, and I ended up saying that we never went out because she was always making a fuss she got really mad at me that day.

We went to play a game once, and when I said something bad about it, she got upset and stopped playing. She brought me chocolate, we spent time together, and right after she started talking about breaking up. She invited me to a party with her, then said she wasn’t going, then changed her mind and said she was. I got annoyed and asked if she didn’t want me to go with her. Eventually, I said I’d go and asked if I could come earlier, but she made it very clear I should only arrive at 6 p.m.

I ended up arriving earlier, and her sister saw me on the street and asked me to come up. We ended up going to one of her friend’s parties. She introduced me as her boyfriend, and then out of nowhere she said, “Let’s download an app to find you a hot girl?” After that, we went to her place, and she wanted me to spend the night, but I went home.

After all these problems, I called her and broke up. She started crying and blocked me. Later, she said I had “sent her to the psych ward” and that I had taken away her happiness. Soon after, she messaged me saying she missed me more than she thought she would. We started talking again, and while we were chatting, I found her on a dating app. She told me to “go find someone else.” I got mad and questioned her, and she said she was looking for a friend’s ex.

In the end, I told her I loved her. She said it would pass, that she had gone somewhere and wished I’d been there. Then she called me, inviting me to her mother’s birthday party. I didn’t go. Her mother called me asking if I loved her. Later, her mom invited me over for coffee. We started talking again, and she told me her dad was mad at me. I ended up feeling bad and venting online. She found it and told me I had deceived and used her, that she only acted the way she did because she was insecure and had autism, and that she had prayed for me every day. Then she blocked me and disappeared.



TL;DR:
From the start, my ex was distant, avoided showing herself on video calls, and often canceled plans with vague excuses. She said she had autism, was insecure, and had a history of being abandoned. Our relationship was full of mixed signals moments of affection followed by sudden mood changes, secrecy with her phone and social media, and reluctance for me to meet her family. Plans were constantly changed or canceled, and she sometimes made strange or hurtful comments. Eventually, after multiple arguments, breakups, and reconciliations, I found her on a dating app. Things ended for good when she accused me of deceiving and using her, said she had prayed for me daily, and then blocked me.

I can't understand, what should I do?

by [https://www.gptsportswriter.com](https://www.gptsportswriter.com) **The Reds vs. Pirates Showdown: A Tale of Two Teams (and a Lot of Missed Home Runs)**

Ladies and gentlemen, prepare for a clash of the titans—by which I mean two teams that only *technically* qualify as “competitive.” The Cincinnati Reds (-123) and Pittsburgh Pirates (+104) meet at PNC Park, where the air is thick with the scent of roasted nuts, nostalgia, and the faint whiff of “what if?” Let’s break this down with the precision of a umpire and the humor of a concession stand receipt.

**Parsing the Odds: A Math Wizard’s Nightmare**  
The Reds, at 60-57, are your garden-variety overachievers, while the Pirates (51-66) are the baseball version of a group project that forgot the assignment. Cincinnati’s starter, Nick Martinez (9-9, 4.66 ERA), is like a leaky faucet—occasionally useful, but you’ll end up with a soggy floor. Opposite him, Braxton Ashcraft (3-2, 3.24 ERA) is the math whiz in the class, sporting a 2.33 strikeout-to-walk ratio that makes him the Billy Gates of pitching (if Bill Gates had a curveball).

Implied probabilities? The Reds are favored at 55.1% (thanks to those -123 odds), while the Pirates’ 48.8% (from +104) suggests they’re about as reliable as a weather forecast in Pittsburgh. Historically, the Reds win 51% when favored, and the Pirates? A modest 42.5% as underdogs. Not exactly the confidence of a team that’s built a time machine to win the 2025 World Series.

**Digesting the News: Injuries, Home Runs, and Oneil Cruz’s Existence**  
Let’s start with the good news: The Reds’ Elly De La Cruz is still upright, which is more than we can say for the team’s home run numbers. Cincinnati ranks 21st in MLB with 117 HRs—about as impactful as a screen door on a submarine. Meanwhile, the Pirates’ 83 HRs are last in baseball, which explains why their offense resembles a diet soda: full of fizz, but zero flavor.

On the injury front? The Reds’ biggest problem is Spencer Steer’s habit of mistaking third base for a coffee table. The Pirates? Oneil Cruz remains the lone bright spot, a human highlight reel who could probably hit a home run… if the ball wasn’t made of concrete. And let’s not forget Andrew McCutchen, the 35-year-old “Grandpa McCutch” who still pretends he’s dodging fastballs in the 2010s.

**Humorous Spin: When Baseball Meets Absurdity**  
The Reds’ offense is like a treasure hunt: You bring the map, but the pirates (Pittsburgh’s, obviously) forgot to bring the gold. Martinez’s 4.66 ERA? That’s not a number—it’s a slow drip of despair. Conversely, Ashcraft is the guy who aced your high school algebra class, while Martinez is the kid who used a calculator to add 2+2.

PNC Park, that pitcher’s paradise, should theoretically help the Pirates. But with a lineup that can’t hit a home run if you paid them in Bitcoin, they might as well be playing in a cave with a “No Hits Allowed” sign. The Reds, meanwhile, have the power of a wet noodle but the speed of a caffeinated cheetah—Elly De La Cruz could steal a base so fast, he’d make a shadow blush.

**Prediction: The Reds Win, But Don’t Celebrate Yet**  
Putting it all together: The Reds’ slightly better record, Martinez’s “meh” ERA (which is somehow better than Ashcraft’s “meh” ERA), and PNC Park’s pitcher-friendly vibes create a statistical cocktail that favors Cincinnati. The Pirates’ lone edge? Their 3-2 win yesterday, which should be treated like a one-time fluke—like betting on a squirrel to win a chess tournament because it knocked over your pieces once.

**Final Verdict:** The Reds (+123) should scrape together enough runs to win, but the Pirates (+104) will make fans everywhere question why baseball allows teams to hit *fewer than 90 home runs*. Bet on Cincinnati, but keep a contingency fund for when the Pirates pull off another “we did it, grandpa” upset. After all, in this series, anything’s possible—even a game where the most exciting play is a double play.

1mm7buw,https://www.reddit.com/r/KitchenConfidential/comments/1mm7buw/does_my_manager_think_im_on_meth/,Does my manager think I’m on meth?,"I understand kitchen life is rife with drug use, including stimulants, but I’m fairly new to working in a restaurant and I could use some insight about an interaction I had with my manager today. Also I apologize if this subreddit is only for cooks/chefs, if my question is impertinent to the subreddit feel free to remove it.


So basically, I (22M) closed last night and returned home at 12 AM, slept for a few hours, and then woke up really early to open. On the way, I had a monster, and one of my coworkers offered me a coffee when I arrived, which I accepted. I then worked my entire shift afterwords and was about to clock out before my manager asked to see me in his office. I went inside, and he then asked me if I was “nervous” because I was acting a little funny. Besides the caffeine, the only other thing I can note is that I was sweating profusely throughout the day, and had to frequently dab my head with a paper towel. I was initially confused, since I wasn’t aware of myself doing anything unusual (besides the sweating), but I basically told him that I think I had too much coffee in the morning. He immediately shot back “Oh, what kind of coffee?” I answered truthfully, but his tone made it seem he was attempting to catch me in a lie. He then proceeded to praise my performance (???) and then stated that “I shouldn’t think too hard about this” and that he’ll see me next shift. I tried to press a little bit harder about what exactly about my behavior indicated I was nervous, and he said something along the lines of I was walking with my head down when I usually don’t. I responded to that with “well, I also didn’t sleep well last night” and he seemed to accept that explanation.


I left the room and starting thinking about how an office visit was a little bit excessive for what was ostensibly a simple check-in, and it didn’t take me too long to suspect that he believed I was doing some kind of stimulant besides my usual caffeine and nicotine. I asked some friends of mine who formerly worked for the same restaurant about this interaction and they seemed to agree that this manager wasn’t likely to do something like this out of altruism alone. 


The funny part about this whole experience was that I was actually really nervous today. I understand I kinda sound like a pussy, but this was my first day actually carrying hot plates of food out to people and I was petrified that I would lose control of the tray and burn someone, or that I would contaminate some of the food with my sweat. I didn’t say this to him because I didn’t wanna lose face and seem incompetent, but now I’m thinking blaming the coffee may have made everything worse and now he thinks I’m a meth head. I don’t need this job too badly (as in it’s not the last thing between me and homelessness), but I am honestly really upset that I made a poor first impression this early into my employment. Do you guys think I’m blowing all of this out of proportion?

The performance and suitability of a laptop keyboard cover depend on its design, materials, and additional functionalities. This section explores the critical features to consider when selecting the best keyboard cover for your needs.

A thicker cover offers more robust protection against spills and impacts, but it may also reduce the tactile feedback of the keys and make typing feel mushy. Transparency is also important, allowing the keyboard backlight to shine through and maintaining visibility in low-light conditions. A balance between protection and transparency should be sought.Blank Line

## Key Features Analysis

Superior creams candies have a fine, delicate structure that dissolves easily on the tongue, releasing their flavors gradually. this texture is achieved through careful control of the cooking process and the proper ratio of ingredients.

Whether it's a classic vanilla cream or a more adventurous salted caramel, the flavor should be true to its description and not overly sweet or artificial. The intensity of the flavor should also be well-calibrated, providing a satisfying taste experience without being overwhelming.

**Variety of Flavors:** Many brands offer creams candies in assorted flavors.

This provides an prospect to sample diffrent tastes and find personal favorites. A diverse selection of flavors, ranging from traditional to innovative, can enhance the overall experience. However, the quality of each flavor must be consistent; even in an assortment, each cream should be appetizing and true to its intended taste.

**Packaging and Presentation:** The packaging of creams candy can significantly impact the overall experience, especially when giving as a gift.

Attractive and functional packaging helps to preserve the freshness and integrity of the candy while also adding visual appeal. Individual wrapping can also keep the candies fresh until they are ready to be consumed one at a time.

1mm7aqq,https://www.reddit.com/r/rescuedogs/comments/1mm7aqq/i_miss_my_dog/,I miss my dog,"So my best bud crossed over almost a year ago. A rescued English mastiff   8 years 4months, his hips went. He was fine in the morning then not. Tried everything, was already on a medication regime for joints given his size and the fact that mastiffs have issues, started a few months  prior the new joint medication lybreca or something like that , acupuncture and massages. 

Finally I could see it in his eyes it was no longer fun being here.  Had a week to cry, have the neighbor kids come say good by, got his last pup cup from our favorite coffee shop( who knew his name but not mine 😊) and then drove to our vet who had a quiet room, pizza and apples.  He laid his head on my lap, breathed deeply and left.  It took me 3 hours to go into our home. I’m sorry this is a long back story to get my question but there goes.  

I’m 73, good health, and my promise to my last guy was I wouldn’t check out before he did.  I help up my end but I’m unsure realistically if I could with another. I’ve only ever had rescued mastiffs. Very expensive at the beginning and the end. I miss the snoring, the weight of the head on my lap, the joy in his eyes when I get home.  Our home is quiet and it needs another I’m just not sure if it’s fair for the furr guy? 

Would love any thoughts or suggestions to go through this again or be happy in the memories I hold onto. Thanks ",3,1754793596.0,rescuedogs,1,1.0,False
1mm7ah0,https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/1mm7ah0/the_dahlia_well/,The Dahlia Well,"Part I

I was a socially awkward kid, the kind who ate lunch away from everyone and rarely said a word. Making friends seemed like something everyone but me could do, until I met Seth. We were at school and I happened to hear him talking about the new game his mom bought him. It was a game I happened to be really into so I jumped into the conversation before I could talk myself out of it. We bonded over our love of the game and he invited me over. We’ve been best friends ever since. Lately though—because of everything that’s happened—I’ve been looking back on these early days a little less fondly.

Seth and I spent most of our summers talking about things we’d never actually do. We made big plans and never followed through. But one day, we decided we were really going to build a treehouse. After convincing both our parents, all that was left was finding the right spot. Behind Seth’s house was a dense pine forest, so that was the obvious choice. We searched for about half an hour through the humid, sticky, air. Trees of all shapes and sizes surrounded us as the crickets and birds sang. Eventually we stumbled into a clearing.

It looked almost too perfect—a circle, maybe fifty or seventy-five feet across. Right in the center stood an old stone well, nearly swallowed by moss. The moss was reminiscent of a giant snake, slithering its way up and down the well. The moment I saw it, I felt something shift. Not fear exactly, but a pull. Like it had been waiting for us.

“Dude, this is perfect!” he said walking up to the well as if it was another blade of grass, “We can build the tree house over there—away from the creepy stone thing.”

I wasn’t looking at the tree line though, I was still staring at the well. Seth kept rambling about treehouse ideas, but I kept drifting toward the well. As I got closer, I noticed the stone around the rim had been chiseled in a ripple pattern that spread toward the water hole. The well was about ten feet deep before dropping off into an even darker pit. I almost missed it—but as I stared at the far wall, transfixed, I saw something. There, on a narrow ledge of dirt jutting from the inner wall, sat a single black dahlia.

“Travis, what’re you doing?” Seth’s voice broke me from the trance as I staggered backwards.

“I was just looking at this well. It’s beautiful.”

“The well is beautiful?”

“Yeah…” Seth gave a short laugh, but it didn’t sound amused. “You’re kinda freaking me out man, are you getting enough sleep?”

“Yeah,” I said, not even sure if I believed it myself. “I’m fine.” Seth walked up to me and looked at the well. “Is there anything down there?”

“Nothing really, just a flower and water.” Seth walked closer and peeked into the hole. “What flower?” I blinked. The flower was gone. Not fallen—gone. No trace of it on the stones below, no sign of it ever being there at all. I didn’t answer him. My eyes were still locked on the place where it had been. My skin crawled. “Let’s just go back to your place, we can do this tomorrow. You’re not looking so good.” I nodded, still not fully looking away from the well. It felt like turning your back on something you’re not sure is real—or worse, something you were sure was.

We walked back to my house in near silence, occasionally breaking it to point out an animal or make some half-hearted comment about the woods. The summer heat was still heavy, but it was suddenly a lot less noticeable. The trees whispered above us, branches swaying as the wind blew across them. The air felt different—not colder or thicker, but wrong. Like something had shifted in the clearing. Something I couldn’t name, let alone understand.

When we got to my place I told my mom I wasn’t feeling well. She offered me some soup and ginger ale but I declined. My room was familiar—posters on the wall, controller wires tangled together on the carpet, the ceiling fan clicking with every rotation, but I couldn’t settle. My mind kept circling back to the well. The flower. The way it vanished, like it had never existed at all. Seth booted up Mortal Kombat and handed me a controller. I lost every match we played. I couldn’t focus, I felt anxious, like I was being watched.

That night, I dreamt of the clearing and the well. The sky was grey and dreary and the forest was covered in shadows. I looked around and saw nothing strange so I started walking towards the well. As I approached it, black, thorny vines started slithering out of the well and approaching me. I tried to run but vines came up from the ground and wrapped around my feet. I was stuck in place as the vines started to wrap around me, cutting into my flesh. Hundreds of thorns poked into me as I collapsed into a bed of vines. The vines slowly made their way up my body.

I screamed as thorns tore through my skin, sharp and endless. I thrashed and struggled but it only pushed them deeper into me. I eventually gave up, tears rolling down my face as I accepted my fate. Right before I was completely swallowed by the vines I saw something. A silhouette behind the tree line, human-like in shape. There was something off about it though. I stared at it as the vines slowly engulfed my entire body.

I jolted upright, chest heaving, heart slamming against my ribs. It took minutes to steady my breath, to remind myself I was safe. I grounded myself, counting each breath until I felt stable again. As I got out of bed I looked around my room. Nothing was out of the ordinary and there was nothing going on. I let out a sigh of relief before turning around. What I saw still haunts me. Sitting right there on the outside of my window, was a single Black Dahlia.

Part II

I opened my windotw, heart still pounding from the nightmare. The flower was still there. I reached out and grabbed it, my fingers brushing the petals—and I felt dizzy. My knees buckled slightly as I placed the flower on my nightstand and sat back down. I took deep breaths until the black dots faded from my vision.

When I stood again, the flower was gone. Not wilted or on the floor. Just… gone. My heart sank. Maybe I was just tired. Maybe the heat had gotten to me yesterday and now my brain was playing tricks. I told myself that over and over as I got dressed—trying to believe it. I called Seth. We agreed to hang out at his place that afternoon.

Until then, I just lay around the house, trying not to think about the well. About the flower. About the way it vanished right in front of me—again. As time passed I looked at the clock, 10:07, I sighed heavily as I waited for time to pass. It felt like maybe ten minutes had passed—but when I looked again, it was 11:02. I was confused—how had so much time passed in what felt like a moment?

As 12 o’clock approached I got my shoes on and got ready to leave. As I was about to walk out I saw my cat, King, eating out of his food bowl. I walked up to him to try to pet him but his tail raised up as he slowly backed away. He hissed repeatedly before running away incredibly fast. I had known King since he was a kitten, he’d never hissed at me before, not even when I’d accidentally stepped on his tail. I stared down the hallway that King had vanished in, there was a shadow, a black figure that dragged something behind it as it disappeared into the darkness. I tried to shake it off and as I walked out the front door.

The sky was cold and grey when I stepped outside. By the time I crossed the street, the drizzle had turned to a downpour. Then thunder cracked, low and heavy, and rain fell in sheets. I walked into Seth’s house soaked to the bone, water dripping from my sleeves. I shivered as I climbed the stairs, only stopping to wave at his mom who was making her famous French onion soup. He laughed when I stepped into his room and tossed me a towel. “You look like you got hit by a wave,” he said. I forced a smile as I started drying off.

“The weather hates me. What can I say?” I peeled off my coat, letting it hit the floor with a wet flop. “I think this thing’s done for.” Seth slid further onto his bed, getting comfortable.

“You’ve had that coat since, what—sixth grade? Just burn it already. Put it out of its misery.”

“I can’t. It’s sentimental.”

“Dude, it smells like that well water from yesterday.” I tried to laugh, but it came out thin. “I’m surprised mom even let you in the house looking like that,” Seth added.

“She offered soup. I said no.”

“Bro. You turned down my mom’s soup? You’re actually crazy.”

“Maybe.”

He raised an eyebrow. “Maybe?”

I shrugged.

“I don’t know. I didn’t sleep much.”

“Nightmares?”I hesitated.

“Sort of.”

“About the well that freaked you out?”

“About what was in the well.” He didn’t respond instantly. He just looked at me for a second—longer than usual—and then handed me the game controller.

“Nightmares are weird man, try not to think about it too much. One time I dreamed about my dad with a horse head. Freaky shit. What you should think about is who you’re going to play while you lose like ten times in a row.” I tried to shake it off and sat across from him while he started navigating the menu; talking about new combos he discovered. I wasn’t really listening though, I was letting my attention wander around the room. It was all familiar—posters we’d both picked out, a bookshelf full of comics we collected, and on top sat photos of summers and birthdays gone.

One picture caught my eye. It was us—maybe ten or eleven—standing in his backyard. I remembered that day: water balloons, grilled hot dogs, the rusty old trampoline with a few broken springs. But something was off.

The background looked darker than it should’ve. The trees behind us—too many. Thicker. Tangled. And near my leg, in the bottom corner of the frame, I saw something I didn’t remember: a line of black, like vines creeping through the grass.

I leaned closer. One of the vines curled upward, almost touching my ankle. “Hey, Seth,” I said, my voice low. “When was this picture taken?”

“Uhm… I’m not sure, years ago.”

“You need to see this.” I walked over and held the frame up to his face. He took it, glanced down, then back at me.

“What’s the big deal? This looks fine.” I blinked, the vines were still there, plain as day.

“You don’t see those thorny vines?” His brow furrowed.

“What are you talking about? I don’t see anything, man. Maybe you’re just—y’know—still wound up from yesterday?”

“I’m telling you, they’re right there. You seriously can’t see those vines?” Seth hesitated for a moment.

“No. And you’re kinda freaking me out.” I opened my mouth, closed it, then stared at the frame again. The vines were still there. Crawling. Twisting. Almost reaching me. Why couldn’t he see them?

“I had a dream last night…” I said, the words fumbling out of my mouth faster than I had intended. “The well was there. The flower. Black vines—these vines—coming out of the ground, wrapping around me. Cutting into me.” Seth stayed silent, expression on his face still as I talked. “They had sharp thorns. I couldn’t move. I couldn’t breathe. They squeezed tighter as they moved higher up my body. And right before they covered my face-“ I looked up at him. “There was something in the trees… watching.” Seth shifted in the bed as he spoke.

“Okay… maybe you need to just-“

“And this morning,” I interrupted. “There was a black flower sitting on my window ledge.” I held his gaze as he looked at me confused. “It disappeared. Twice.” Seth exhaled slowly while rubbing the back of his neck.

“You really didn’t sleep much last night did you?” I didn’t respond, I just stared at the photo. The vines seemingly got longer with each glance I took.

“Maybe you shouldn’t go back there,” he added. That’s when I stood up.

“No. I have to.”

“What?”

“I need to see it again. The well. The clearing. All of it.”

“Dude—why?”

“Because I’m not crazy,” I snapped back. “Or if I am, I need to know for sure.”Seth stood up.

“Think about what you’re saying. If the well really is what you think it is, then there’s no point in going straight to it.” I opened my mouth to argue—but nothing came out. He wasn’t wrong. Not exactly.

“So what do I do?” I asked.

“Start small,” he said. “You wanna know what it is? Then figure out where it came from first.” I looked at the photo again, the vines still twisting toward my leg. I knew what I saw.

“Fine,” I muttered. “But I’m not letting this go.” I didn’t argue. Not out loud. But even as we sat back down and the game flickered on, my thoughts kept circling. The dream. The flower. The vines crawling into that photograph like they belonged there. Seth couldn’t see them—but I could. And I didn’t care if it meant I was losing it. I had to know why. I left an hour later, walking home under the dull gray sky, the wind pushing dead leaves into the street. The clearing was off-limits—for now—but maybe there was another way to get answers.

When I got home I opened my laptop, typed “old stone well Pinewood Forest,” and hit enter. And there it was—on the first page: “The Mouth of Dahlia—Urban Legends and Vanishing Boys.” I stared at the blue website name—scared to click on it. The page loaded slowly. It looked like a blog—basic white background, outdated fonts, barely readable. The article was dated 2009.

“Hidden deep in Pinewood Forest sits a moss-covered well known to some locals as ‘The Mouth of Dahlia.’” It talked about disappearances—three boys in the ‘40s, a hiking group in ‘78, another kid in the ‘90s. No bodies. No signs. Just a black flower found near where they vanished. I kept scrolling. “Some believe the well isn’t a structure but a living thing—a mouth that feeds on people. A boundary between our world and something older. Others claim the well to be a portal to hell or an otherworldly plane.” My stomach turned. A figure in the trees. Dreams. The flower. “The flower doesn’t grow naturally in this region. But it keeps appearing. Those who see it—never forget.”

I sat back in my chair, hands clammy. I wasn’t crazy or delusional, I was being hunted. It wasn’t just a nightmare anymore. I had seen that flower, and now I knew its name.

I couldn’t sleep that night. I kept seeing the flower every time I closed my eyes. By morning, I’d memorized the article. But it wasn’t enough. I needed something older. Something real. The local library opened at 10:00. I was waiting outside by 9:45.

I was at the library when the doors opened. No sleep. No appetite. Just a buzzing need to know. The reference section smelled like dust and forgotten things. The librarian barely looked up when I asked about Pinewood’s history—just pointed toward a shelf marked “Local Archives.” Most of the books looked untouched. Brown covers, warped spines, handwritten call numbers in faded ink. I scanned titles until one caught my eye:

“Structures of Significance: Settlements and Monuments of Pinewood County.” I pulled it down and flipped through yellowing pages until I found a section labeled: The Dahlia Well

“Constructed in 1885 by Harold Millen, a local stoneworker, the well was originally intended to supply water to the southern edge of what was then known as Millen Farm. It was named after his wife, Dahlia Wren Millen, whose favorite flower inspired both the name and the carved vine motifs still visible on the structure today.” I paused. Vines. “According to local accounts, Dahlia Millen died under unclear circumstances shortly after the well was completed.”

“After her death, strange reports began circulating—missing animals, inexplicable dreams, and sightings of a ‘woman in black’ near the forest’s edge. Though never confirmed, these incidents led some to believe Dahlia’s spirit had become bound to the well, either by grief, or by something darker.” There was no conclusion. No resolution. Just a final line: “While skeptics dismiss these tales as rural superstition, the well has remained a source of quiet fascination—and quiet fear—for over a century.”

I closed the book slowly, my fingers tight around the cover. The carving. The dreams. The flower. Maybe it was just a story. But maybe she was still there.

Part III

I walked out of the library in the hot hours of the afternoon. The clouds parting and sun shining reminding me of what life was like before the well. I should have felt comforted by the warmth. But I didn’t.

The air felt too bright, like the world had overcorrected. Everything was golden and gleaming—too clean, too alive. I blinked into the sunlight, and for a second I felt like I was looking at something I didn’t belong in anymore.

People walked past me without noticing, laughing, talking, chewing on the ends of iced coffee straws and complaining about the heat. I wondered if they’d ever seen the flower—if they’d remember that they had. Or maybe I was the only person to feel this way.

I didn’t go home. I walked—no direction in mind. I passed a broken streetlamp with a vine coiled around it. One of the leaves looked… different. Almost shaped like a mouth. I stopped walking. I took a photo. Zoomed in. It was just a leaf. But no—was it?

When I got home I laid everything out. Notes, print-outs, hand-drawn maps I had made. I circled the location of the well, my house, and the street lamp. I drew a line—and then another. The intersections didn’t mean anything yet, but something in my bones said they would. I stood back. looked at the angles. Measured distances with a ruler I hadn’t touched in forever.

The paper didn’t give answers, but it started to hum. Not literally. Not out loud. Just beneath the surface of the silence, like the house itself was listening. That’s when I remembered the archive box.

Last week, tucked in a back room of the library, there had been a stack of unlabeled cartons—donated by the First Presbyterian Church when they’d cleared out their basement. Most were full of hymns and yellowed bulletins. But one had older material. Parish logs, burial certificates, handwritten sermon notes. I’d flipped through it without care. It wasn’t catalogued. Not even alphabetized. I’d only opened it because the box was broken and sagging at the corners.

There’d been a letter inside, folded between two brittle sheets of cemetery records. I don’t remember reading the whole thing at the time—just the date, the name of the author, and the strange scrawl of handwriting like he’d written it with a broken nail. I only brought it home because it looked out of place. An instinct. Or maybe the well had already started nudging. Now it was on the table, waiting. I unfolded the page, and read the letter in full for the first time.

14 August, 1872 Rectory of St. Bellamy's Parish Crook’s Hollow, County Wexford To whomever should, by Providence or misfortune, come upon this missive— I write not as a man of sound standing, but as one—

by knowledge that ought never have been touched. I have seen a thing which the earth has no name for. The villagers speak of a woman. They say her spirit lingers in the old well—that her sorrow poisons the ground, that she hungers for company. I have heard the tales, and I tell you now: they are wrong. The well is not haunted. It is—

…I have stood upon its stones and felt a warmth rise that is not the lord’s doing. I have looked into its depths and dreamed things I do not believe were ever mine to dream. Prayers spoken near it echo strangely, as though some other mouth repeats them with a voice just slightly behind my own. It listens. I have seen vines grow in spirals that mimic the shapes I later found—

I am watched. I am used. I have tried all rites known to me. Salt, fire, the blessing of the ground, the breaking of stone. It returns. It always returns—

…I dare not speak of this to the bishop. Let them think me mad. Perhaps I am. But if you are reading this—if this letter still breathes in your hands—then it is not yet satisfied. It waits. Do not trace its paths. Do not name it. And above all— In dwindling faith, Fr. Elias Grange

I read the letter once. Then again. Then again. I tried not to assign meaning to the parts I couldn’t read, but that only made them louder. I filled in gaps with instinct, with memory, with my own thoughts. I didn’t write anything down, but I started repeating certain phrases in my head, over and over: It is not haunted. It listens. Do not name it.

At first I told myself it was historical context—just context, that’s all. But I knew better. I felt better. This wasn't a coincidence. This wasn’t superstition. The priest had seen the vines too. He’d felt that same wrong warmth. He’d drawn something, or dreamed something, or spoken words that didn’t sound like his own.

And now he’s gone. Just a cracked letter, buried in the wrong box, misfiled in the basement of a library where no one ever looked. I laid it out beside my maps. The ones I’d drawn. I looked at the spirals again. I didn’t remember drawing them either—not consciously—but there they were, repeating across three separate pages. The lines converged near the well, but more than that… they grew. Each time, the spirals were longer. Thicker. As if they were spreading.

I pulled the light closer and started sketching again. Carefully. No ruler, no measuring. Just my hand. It felt natural. Almost like copying. When I blinked, it was almost dark. I hadn’t eaten. My phone buzzed—four unread texts, missed call, low battery. I didn’t answer. I barely registered the names. Instead, I turned the priest’s letter over. Nothing written. But the paper was warped, stained in one corner like it had been held too tightly in a damp palm. I touched the spot. Cold.

That night, I dreamt of the well. But not like before—not a memory. Not something I could rationalize later as a reconstruction. The dream was inside the well. There was no light, no ground, no sky. Just slow movement, like being suspended in something thick, something not water. Something that labored up and down in a near perfect rhythm. Then, a voice—not loud, not sharp. A whisper, just near the edge of my ear, as though it were spoken from within me. “It’s waiting for you.”

The morning after the dream, I found a crack in the living room wall. It started near the ceiling and curved downward—not jagged, not haphazard. It curled. A wide, deliberate arc, looping once like something hand-drawn. Like something I’d drawn. I didn’t touch it. I didn’t even go near it. Just stared at the shape for a while, half expecting it to keep growing right in front of me. When I blinked and looked again, it was just a crack. Drywall split from heat or pressure or old age. But I could swear it hadn’t been there the day before. I could swear it was growing.

I got a pencil and sketched the shape in my notebook. That was the first entry. By the end of the week, I had filled four pages with notes. Strange sights, small sounds, shapes that reappeared in places they didn’t belong. There was a vine outside the bathroom window, coiled in the same spiral I’d drawn on one of the maps. Dust gathered in the corner of the kitchen that looked—if I stared too long—like the shape of a mouth. A floorboard near the hallway seemed to pulse, just slightly, like something was breathing under it. Sometimes I felt it at night when I walked barefoot to the kitchen. The house began creaking at odd hours, but never the usual kind—this wasn’t the random shift of old wood in heat. This was rhythmic. Intentional. Like footsteps or a slow drag of something heavy just beneath the floor.

I started writing down everything. Not because I thought it would help me understand, but because I was afraid that if I didn’t, I’d start forgetting what was real. Some nights I’d wake up not knowing if the dream had ended. Other times I’d be completely awake and hear things I couldn’t place. Low, scraping sounds like something was clawing at the pipes. The voice came back too. Always in dreams at first. A woman’s voice—soft, urgent, whispering close enough that I felt the warmth of breath on the back of my neck. She said things like “deeper,” or “closer,” or “you’ve already seen it.” She never shouted. She never begged. Just said those things again and again until I woke up soaked in sweat, heart pounding, unsure whether I’d screamed.

Eventually, I stopped trying to sleep. The cracks were in every room now. Most were small, just hairline fractures, but some had started curling into distinct shapes. Spirals, mostly. I measured a few of them and compared them to the ones I’d drawn in my earliest sketches. They matched exactly—same size, same curve, even the same direction. That shouldn’t have been possible. I hadn’t used a compass or ruler for any of them. They were just instinctive drawings. But something about them was being mirrored in the house itself.

I began keeping field notes. Every incident had a time stamp. I noted what I saw, what I heard, where in the house it happened, and what I might’ve done to trigger it. Sometimes I could hear the voice during the day too, not just in dreams. Whispered just low enough that I couldn’t catch every word. I wrote those down too. Sometimes just fragments: “It’s hungry,” “We remember,” “You’re close,” “He failed,” and once, just once, “Don’t leave.”

One night while going through the pages again, I remembered something from the archive box. Buried beneath the priest’s letter and the church logs, there had been a bundle of handwritten sermon drafts—most of them incomprehensible—but one of them had a different handwriting and included diagrams. Badly drawn circles, strange patterns, and Latin phrases scribbled in the margins. At the time I’d dismissed it as nonsense, but now I found myself digging through the pile to find it again. And when I did, I realized it wasn’t just a sermon. It was something else.

The handwriting matched the priest’s signature from the letter—Fr. Elias Grange. A final note from him, possibly unfinished. One page near the end had been marked with a faint ink circle and the words “Counter-Circle” underlined three times. There were references to a ritual—elements of protection, maybe. It wasn’t clear. The Latin was fragmented, and the diagrams seemed incomplete. But I pieced together enough to try it.

I waited until night. Cleared the living room, pushed the furniture to the edges, and chalked the rough shape of the circle onto the floor. I placed salt where the lines met, as best I could make sense of it. I read the incantation aloud, quietly at first, then louder. My voice cracked during the third repetition. By the end of it, my vision had gone blurry and my hands were shaking. I felt like I was on the verge of throwing up.

But then—nothing happened. The room stayed still. No whispers. No cracking walls. No strange movements in the shadows. I sat there for hours, waiting for something to shift. Nothing did. It was the first quiet I’d experienced in days. That night I slept straight through. No dreams. No voice. Just sleep.

The next morning I found blood in the bathroom sink. It was faint—almost diluted—but real. I checked myself over. No cuts. No dried blood in my mouth. The drain wasn’t rusted. It wasn’t some old residue. It was fresh. I turned the tap on and watched it swirl down.

When I stepped outside, I noticed something I hadn’t before. Every house on the street—every single one—had a vine growing near the base. Most people probably wouldn’t have noticed it. Just one thin strand curling around a pipe or sprouting from a crack in the driveway. But I looked closer. They all curved the same way. All spiraled in the same direction.

I opened my notebook and flipped back through the pages. My earliest maps had started warping. The ink was thicker now. The spirals are darker, fuller. The paper almost felt damp in some places, like the lines were still alive. Still growing. Even the ones I hadn’t touched were changing, reshaping themselves slightly when I looked away. The lines were converging on something. A center point I already knew. The priest’s letter said it always returns. He tried fire, salt, and prayer. All of it failed. His letter had survived. But he hadn’t.

That evening, while I sat at the kitchen table, I heard the voice again. This time I was fully awake. It didn’t come from a dream, and it wasn’t outside. It was in the room with me, just behind my ear. No warmth this time. No breath.

“Why would you do that?” Then silence.

But I could feel something beneath the house. Something scraping from underneath the floor boards. It wasn’t scraping the flooring though—the sound was coming from deeper in the earth. It sounded like grinding. Like two pieces of iron scraping against eachother

I packed a bag. The letter. My notes. A flashlight. A map. I took matches. A knife. A jar of salt. I don’t know what I thought I’d need. But I knew staying here was no longer an option. The lines were crawling toward me now, not outward. Inward. Always toward where I stood. The spirals in my drawings had started looping into themselves like they were folding reality.

The well had been whispering. Now it was listening. And whatever was at the bottom was finally awake. I was going back. I had to. Not to stop it. I don’t know if that’s even possible. But I had to see it. I had to know what it wanted. Because I think it’s always known what I am. And it’s been waiting.

Part IIII

I returned to the edge of the pine clearing just before dusk. The woods were quiet—too quiet. The usual buzzing of summer insects and rustling of small animals seemed to have stilled. I felt like I was being watched, and I suppose in a way I was, because Seth was already there, sitting on a fallen log with his arms crossed and an expression somewhere between worry and disappointment. He stood as I approached, and I could see that he’d been waiting a while. “You’re serious about this,” he said flatly, not even offering a greeting.

I nodded, not slowing my step. “I have to go back. Everything leads here. I’ve seen the symbols, the vines, the way the cracks form in the house—they all converge. It’s not random. It’s real. I think it always was.” Seth stared at me for a long time, like he was waiting for a punchline that never came.

“You hear yourself? You’re talking about cracks and vines like they mean something. Like they’re some kind of sign. You don’t think maybe you’re just... seeing what you want to see?”

“It’s not what I want to see,” I snapped, more sharply than I intended. “Do you think I want to believe any of this? That I want to be haunted, sleepless, surrounded by symbols that keep growing every time I look away? You didn’t read the priest’s letter. You didn’t hear the voice. You didn’t see the flowers on your pillow at night.” Seth rubbed his face with both hands and let out a breath.

“Jesus. I thought this would pass. I thought maybe if you just let it sit, it’d fade out like a bad dream. But you’re only getting worse. This is a suicide mission.”

“I’m not going to die,” I said. “Not if someone’s up here to help pull me out.” He looked away and shook his head, muttering something I couldn’t hear, then sighed.

“Fine. But if anything goes wrong, I’m pulling you up. No arguments. No excuses.”

“Agreed.” We walked to his house to grab some rope, not speaking much. There was tension in the air, the kind that didn’t come from fear but from resignation. I knew I couldn’t explain it well enough for him to understand. And he knew I wouldn’t be talked out of it. He fetched a long coil of sturdy rope from the garage, along with a flashlight and gloves. We each carried one end as we made our way back toward the clearing. The forest felt tighter this time, the trees leaning inward, the light dimming faster than it should have. We barely said a word the entire walk.

At the well, we paused. The stones looked the same, but I could feel something else—like the very air around us had thickened. The birds had gone silent. Even the insects had stopped. Seth tied one end of the rope to a heavy branch nearby, anchoring it securely, then looked at me. “This is your last chance to not be a complete idiot,” he said. “You sure about this?” I tightened the straps on my backpack and took a breath.

“Yeah. I need to know.” He tied the rope around my waist and gave it a few strong tugs, testing the tension.

“I’ll be right here. If you shout, I’ll pull. If the rope jerks, I’ll pull. If you’re quiet for too long, I’m pulling.”

“Understood.” I climbed onto the edge of the well and slowly began my descent. The rope held firm as I lowered myself hand-over-hand into the dark shaft. At first, it was just damp stone and the faint echo of my breathing. Seth’s voice drifted down after me.

“You good?”

“Yeah,” I called back. “About ten feet down.” The stones started to feel slick, and the smell hit me—moisture and rot, like wet meat left out in the sun. After another few feet, I saw small holes in the stone walls—perfectly round, about the size of golf balls. They were spaced irregularly, as if bored into the well after its construction.

“I see holes,” I called up. “They weren’t in the old construction. Maybe... something bored through.” “Don’t start speculating down there,” Seth called. “Just keep track of where you are.”

I nodded to myself and kept going. At around twenty feet, the stone gave way to something else—dark, reddish, and fibrous. It wasn’t just damp. It glistened. The texture shifted beneath my hands, pliable but firm, like hardened muscle. My flashlight beam caught threads of some kind of tissue running along the walls in spirals. The air got denser. Every breath was harder to take, like I was inhaling steam laced with copper and mildew.

“I think I hit the bottom,” I lied. “Going a little farther.”

“Be careful.” Another five feet down, I saw a ring embedded into the wall—a full circle, maybe three feet across, made entirely of the same fleshy material. It pulsed, slow and steady, like the beat of a buried heart. And then I heard it. A sound like breathing—not mine, not wind—something deeper, heavier. Inhale. Exhaled.

I felt a gust of hot air from below. I jerked the rope. “Pull me up!” There was no response at first. Then the rope shifted, tightening. As I ascended, I passed the holes again, and something shot out—vines. Slick, fast, they darted from the holes and lashed toward my legs. I kicked hard, trying to swing out of the way, but more shot up from below. I screamed to Seth. “Vines! They’re coming! Pull faster!”

I felt the rope jerk violently. Seth was pulling with everything he had. As I cleared the edge of the stone section, the vines thrashed and whipped, lashing at my boots and legs. I was nearly out when I saw Seth’s face at the top, strained with effort. “Come on! You’re almost—” he started, then screamed.

A vine had wrapped around his ankle. He kicked at it, shouting as he lost his grip on the rope. I tried to grab his arm as I neared the top, but another vine coiled around his thigh and yanked. He fought, cursing, eyes wide with panic. I pulled at him, but there were too many—vines snaking from the well, wrapping his arms, his chest, dragging him toward the mouth. “Don’t let go!” I yelled, clutching him with both hands.

His grip slipped. I tried to hold on. I tried. But he screamed my name as the vines yanked him into the dark, his voice echoing down the shaft before it was swallowed whole. And then there was nothing. Only my ragged breath and the faint creak of the rope swaying.

I ran. I stumbled through the trees until my legs gave out and I collapsed against a moss-covered rock. I sobbed there for what felt like hours. I didn’t know what to do. I couldn’t think. My friend—my only real friend—was gone, because of me. Because I believed in something I didn’t understand. Because I thought I could face it.

When I finally made it home, I climbed into my window and collapsed on my bed, still wearing the same dirt-streaked clothes, hands trembling. I didn’t sleep. I just stared at the ceiling, listening to the silence.

The police questioned me for days. I told them the truth, or at least a version of it. That we’d gone hiking, that Seth slipped. That I couldn’t reach him. They searched the woods, the well, everything. They found no signs of foul play. They found no signs of Seth.

The case was ruled accidental. A tragic fall. Maybe a cover-up. Maybe they didn’t want to know the truth. Maybe they couldn’t. His family stopped speaking to me. Friends from school distanced themselves. I became a pariah. The boy who got his best friend killed. I told myself I’d never go back. That it was over. But it wasn’t.

It’s been eight years. I’m twenty-five now. I’ve kept quiet. I’ve moved twice. I tried to live a normal life. But I never really escaped that clearing. That well. Not really. The guilt has followed me like a shadow I can’t outrun. I see Seth’s face in dreams. Sometimes I hear him screaming. Sometimes I see him staring from the bottom of the well, not screaming at all. Just watching

I’m going back. Not because I think I’ll survive it. Not because I believe I can stop it. I’m going back because I can’t live with what I did. Or what I didn’t do. Seth deserved better. And I think whatever’s down there knows that. Maybe it’s always known.",1,1754793570.0,nosleep,0,1.0,False

Like, you know those annoying “Select all the traffic lights” things? Apparently folks are turning those brain cells into COLD HARD CASH.  

But hold on—there's more to it than just clicking boxes and living the dream. This whole ""app testing gateways"" thing, especially sites like **https://goodnovel.org/testapp**, is either the *weirdest goldmine ever* or just another bizarre internet hustle!

Here’s what blew my mind after diving deep:  

- There are apps literally recruiting everyday users just to help them train their AI and bots by solving CAPTCHAS or doing brain-less testing.
- Sites like **https://goodnovel.org/testapp** promise money—or gift cards!—for every successfully finished task. YES, you read that right.
- But wait! The payout isn’t always what you’d hope. Sometimes it’s pennies…like, you couldn’t even buy a pack of gum after a frantic hour of clicking.  
- Some users share *big wins* doing short “test tasks” on **https://goodnovel.org/testapp**, while others warn it can be a massive time sink with low returns.

I'm SERIOUSLY torn and honestly can’t figure out if this is genius or desperate LOL! 😂

Let’s break down what I learned from my confounding journey into these “get paid to click things” land:

- **Easy to Start:** No weird interviews, no skills. As long as you can spot a “bike” in a grainy photo, you’re ready.
- **Zero-commitment Zone:** Do it while binging a Netflix series. No shame.  
- **Sketch Factor:** Some apps, like the ones using **https://goodnovel.org/testapp**, promise quick rewards but their payout system can be confusing. Always look for reviews—legit ones!
- **Potential Benefit:** If you’ve got five boredom-filled minutes waiting for your coffee to brew, a few clicks won’t hurt. But please, DON’T quit your day job chasing this “get-rich-quick” fever dream.

I’m *SHOCKED* at how many people are on TikTok, YouTube, and Discord bragging about their earnings (or lack of earnings) from these app gateways. Like, is this a real revolution in side-hustle culture? Or have we truly run out of ways to make cash on the internet?

Honest question to y’all: Have you ACTUALLY tried **https://goodnovel.org/testapp** or something like it? Did you cash out—or just end up fighting an army of CAPTCHAS, questioning your life decisions? 😆

Drop your hottest takes below! Are we sleepwalking into a low-stakes CAPTCHA-fueled renaissance or is this the new gig economy joke? Either way, I’m maybe…*just maybe*…hyped and tempted to click that **https://goodnovel.org/testapp** “Test Now” button one more time.

Simply had to say it FOUR times. Now it’s your turn—sound off!

Well, when ur a fan of it, u can tell by the colour itself. Since then, jadi habit once my order sudah siap, I simply took the straw and taste it in front of the staffs. Every branch I went to order, I do this. Some were perfectly blended up to the taste. But some simply slip off.

I did make a direct complaint upon tasting and they are willing to replace it with a new one…with a sour face 😅 and the Drink that they wrongly made, they just throw into the trash. Ada yg tau hukum membazir, they gave to us and made us a new one.

Latest was when I went to join their promotion on 08/08, ordered my same fav drink..and guess what? Rasa ICE 😗 and tawar macam no caramel. So complaint lagi and I just tell them to modify my drink instead of buang ke sampah and they did. So they masukkan my 2 cups of drink dalam blender, add coffee and caramel. And there u go. Rupanya they awal buat the caramel mixture, so tau add ice and coffee saja. Not the usual freshly made. Yes, atu I understand they had a lot of customers coming for their promotion.

Beware of unruly and irresponsible behaviour by children and their parents/caregivers at public parks.

This evening, I took my children to a local splash pad and I was disappointed with an incident that unfolded. I say disappointed because the child's caretaker was there and permitted the violation to go on.

I noticed a boy, probably around 8-10 years old, walk up to the splash pad area and look around. He  wasn't interested in talking/playing with other children, but instead he stumbled upon a girl's bag (pink Crossbody bag), picked it up and went to sit down at the bench where his caregiver was watching him from.

He proceeded to take out items from the bag and stuff some in this pockets. Now, this was a little girl's bag...not even a toy truck, or car, or something that boys would be obviously interested in.

The most shocking thing was that the caregiver was not phased at all, and watched him do this. Any  sensible human being with values or morals would have stopped the child, right? Not this one. Think of the lost lesson for this child. Well.... I wasn't about to let it slip by.

I went up the girls that were playing with my child, and asked them if they had lost their bag. One of them ran up to the boy and demanded for her stuff & bag back. I told her mother who was completely lost in conversation with other Moms (same culture/same cultural clothes on)... it was as if they were having their daily coffee chit-chat, and totally forgetting that they're not at home, but outside in public. Her mother also, went up and talked to the boy and helped her daughter gather back her belongings. She was so grateful that I spoke up and alerted her and her little daughter.

After a few minutes, the boy and his caregiver walked away from the park with their heads down. Were they ashamed? I hope so.  (I used the word caregiver because the boy and the man were of completely different skin colours; big difference.) I won't mention the skin colours because I do not want to highlight that, but I don't believe they were blood-related, that's all.

My advice here: Please watch your children when you're outside in public. Some adults really do not have any values/morals/OR convictions and apparently are totally okay with permitting disorderly behaviour by little children. This is how children continue risky behaviours and turn into dishonest people (maybe even thieves (rampant car thefts, home invasions in the recent years.... yeah all those behaviours started when they were YOUNG!). I'm not being overly dramatic, this is just reality in 2025 unfortunately.

My sister was over with my niece a few days ago. The four of us all went to lunch and it was nice. Sister then came back to the house to hang out more. My mom mentioned going to a cafe near our house for coffee or ice cream. I said I’ll pass but my sister wanted to go. She asked me if I wouldn’t mind watching my niece and I happily said yes. Said they’d be gone no more than an hour and a half. 

Soon after they left, I realized my nieces diaper was dirty so I changed her. We then went for a walk around the neighborhood and came back and started watching a movie. My mom and sister returned after two hours, which didn’t bother me at all because I love spending time with my niece. 

Sister asked if she had been good and I said yes and I told her what we did, and also mentioned that she had pooped because I thought parents ought to know that kind of stuff about their babies. My sister was like “oh ok I’ll change her now” and I told her I already did, over an hour ago. She looked absolutely horrified. Said I should not have done and “crossed a boundary.” I was genuinely confused. My sister has never acted like this before. I asked why and she said that a man shouldn’t be changing a girls diaper. She went on to say that even her own husband (nieces dad) only changes her “in emergencies.” I asked if she would have rather I let her sit in a dirty diaper and she didn’t respond. 

They left soon after this and my sister was like “I’m not mad anymore, but ask me before doing something like that next time, ok?” I told her there wouldn’t be a next time and I wouldn’t be watching my niece again. I said I’m not watching a child if I have to “ask” whether it’s ok for me to change their diaper. If a child under my care has a dirty diaper I’m changing it. So I won’t watch her again. She left upset. 

My mom was witness to all this but stayed quiet. When my sister left, I asked what she thought. She said I absolutely did nothing wrong, but that she also “understands where sister is coming from.” 

I feel gross about this whole thing. Makes me feel weird that my sister acted this way about me changing a literal diaper. I love kids and I’m going to college for a career in healthcare and will literally be working with children. Some of which diapers I will undoubtedly be changing. And this isn’t even a matter of not knowing how to properly change diapers for female anatomy. My girlfriend and I babysit her little cousins probably at least every other week and I have learned to change their diapers if needed, male or female. 

TLDR: I changed my nieces diaper while babysitting and she got upset with me. I told her I wouldn’t be babysitting for her again.

1mm6i3e,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1mm6i3e,My first sprint triathlon - a novel 😂,"So, I’ve seen a few short versions of these… but decided to write a longer one for any new person that might be where I was (feeling very lost).

I was in the hospital 3 months ago. I was rethinking life and decided just under 2 months ago that I was going to do a sprint triathlon. My sister and I have talked about it for 10+ years, so why not now.

The Prep - I trained in my local gym. The lap pool is short, but I made it work. Stationary bikes are nice. Treadmills are good (if not noisy). I also don’t really have money. So a friend gave me his old bike (I named Boko, a chocobo from Final Fantasy V). I had it tuned up. I got a triathlon suit. I got a helmet. I got goggles and a swimsuit to practice. All together about $200. I read online that there are people with thousand dollar bikes… but that it doesn’t matter, especially for your first. I also scoped out the park a few days before the race, just to get acquainted with it. I had 3 panic attacks in the two days before the race. Imposter syndrome really set in and I just couldn’t believe what I had signed myself up for. I wanted to back out, but my friends and sister kept encouraging me, “even if I got last place, which you won’t!”. Last night, I slept about 2-3 hours.

The Morning - I got out of bed at 5:45 to have a bagel and coffee (I had heard to have carbs 2 hours before the race. I almost wish I had done 3 hours just because I was so nervous). I then got my stuff together and headed to the site. I figured an hour early was fine. The venue was pretty packed! I panicked that I should have gotten there earlier, but the line to pick up your packet moved quickly. For newbies, apparently you pick up a packet beforehand. It has your bib(?) for the run and safety pins, a number tag for your bike, a chip anklet to track your time, a sticker for your helmet, and then a colored swim cap which coincided with my start group. I then got my number written on my arms and my division/race type written on my legs. I found my way to the bike racks and got everything set up. I just followed other people as far as sticker placements went. The announcer started giving instruction on where to exit/enter for each part of the race. Super helpful! I stuck around to listen to that until he told sprinters to head to the start line. I walked away from my bike a good distance, then turned around to find it again (I took a shark towel and a kid’s backpack that I could notice easily)… and I lost track of my bike. That is why I did this, I knew I would get nervous and forget where it was buuut if I found it once, I’d remember going forward. I then headed to the beach (about a 5-10 minute walk) where it started and noticed everyone was wearing their colored swim caps, which I didn’t have with me. This made me panic a little, I didn’t have time to run back to my stuff to grab it. A volunteer explained it was a buoy start based on age groups (mine was first). After his announcement, I ran up and asked about my swim cap, it wasn’t a big deal. I stretched for the remainder of my time.

The Swim - We lined up on the beach and headed down a ramp into the water. The water was pretty shallow and there were lots of underwater obstacles to avoid. As I got to the buoy, the race was pretty much starting. I am a decently strong swimmer, but the second I started, I got kicked pretty hard on the shoulder. A few seconds later I got tangled up in seaweed (that literally went around my neck). This made me start having a panic attack in the water. I was having to breathe with each stroke and it was wearing me out really quickly. I decided to abandon freestyle for backstroke (my second strongest swimming technique… but I’m pretty awful at it). I didn’t like this decision because I used my legs a LOT, which I wanted to save for the bike race. Because I was going backwards, I semi ran into the shore which I had to hard-correct. It felt like an hour, but before I knew it, I was finishing the swim. I walked out of the water and up the sand and jogged to my bike once I was away from sand (I know how hard it is to run in sand).

The Bike - I immediately found my bike, took my goggles off, threw my helmet on, took a sip of water to change the river-water taste in my mouth, put on socks and shoes (I cannot run in shoes without socks… it grosses me out 🫠 but it only took 5 seconds to dry off my feet and throw socks on). I used my running shoes to bike, I didn’t buy clip-in shoes… to save money, but I also always hear people talk about how they unclip during the race… so with my ADD, I figured I would do without.) They warned us about speed bumps on the first/last part of the bike route. I had put my bike in a gear that I was happy with. I picked up my bike 2 weeks before the race, and I hadn’t ridden a bike in 25 years. This is what I was most nervous about. I kept watching videos on what gear to do in a pretty flat sprint triathlon… but every video was confusing and very technical so I started feeling very ignorant. I just found a gear that I was happy with and could set a consistent pace. Kinda mid range, I think. I also have an interesting gear system where it is controlled by tapping this button on the handlebar. It was weird to me, but I actually really like that. Now, something I didn’t find online, cycling takes a lot of upper body strength (and my strength comes from my legs, not my upper body). My arms got so tired almost immediately, I just kept adjusting up and down and it actually went away after a bit. Another thing is that my hands kept falling asleep from being wrapped around the handles. So I gently readjusted them occasionally. I didn’t take water to drink during the bike ride, it would have absolutely caused me to wreck. I did not even scratch my face during the race for fear of crashing. I assume stability will come with time. We had 2 turnarounds in our course. I had scoped out the bike route before and thought I knew where the turnarounds were… I was wrong. We had to turnaround on the narrow country road, which almost caused me to crash twice. So, big advice for the cycling portion, practice sharp turnarounds! It wasn’t just a time suck, I also felt panicked that there were people behind me that I could cause to crash. I took one of the final turns of the course a bit wide and almost hit someone trying to pass, which made me feel super guilty. I almost shattered my pelvis hitting a speed bump on the way back, which I hadn’t heard anyone mention… your lower pelvis is gonna hurt! That is honestly what is most sore post-race. After finishing the bike portion, I had a hard time getting off my bike. My legs disappeared from my body which made dismounting tricky. But I stumbled back to my shark towel with Boko. 

The Run - running is my best sport of the three. I did track in highschool and marathon trained in my early 20’s. I was confident in my run. I didn’t have to change shoes after I put my bike up. I took my helmet off and started jogging out… I forgot my bib-thing. I turned around and grabbed it, but the person next to me had hit my stuff after returning, and the safety pins were gone. I had to search through the grass for 2-3 minutes looking for them. I got 2, and figured that would have to do. I jogged off as I pinned it to my chest (although most people had it around their waist). I found a pace I liked and started jogging. It was tricky to pass people as we were being passed by bikers (which were given most of the road). Eventually I got to a sidewalk where I could find a rhythm and go. I passed people, and kept passing people. Eventually I was offered water, which I took, which I regretted after. I didn’t want to stop and drink the water, so I threw it into my mouth and kept going as I threw the cup into a trash can (which most people just threw on the ground… even though they had a trash can at a perfect distance away). My friends came to cheer me on and this is where they were able to find me in the crowd of runners. Before I knew it I was heading up the hill to the finish line. I kicked it into high gear and finished really strong (the announcer even called me out by saying “that’s what I like to see!”). My grandpa was a track coach and he always told me you can finish strong or you can start strong, but either way you’re gonna be tired.” And he was right. I walked back to my bike as a few people gave me fist bumps and complimented my finish, which was strange to me and I found it so sweet. I was handed a medal as I went back to my stuff. I gathered my belongings and took a picture of my medal to send my friends.

The People - everybody was so nice. I took up conversation with a super nice girl while waiting for my packet. All the volunteers were so sweet and patient as I asked so many stupid questions. I can be very shy around a lot of people, but my friends kept saying “you’re so sweet, you’re going to end up finding a race friend!”. I didn’t, but that’s okay. I thought I was going to get looks for my bike or looking nervous, but nobody said anything mean to me the entire day, which I had prepared for. Everybody was lovely.😂

The End - I took my bike out and they checked my number to the number on the bike to make sure I was leaving with Boko. I let me close friends and family know I was done and that I had so much fun. I then headed back to my car and went home. On the way, I pondered if I should have done a full triathlon since I didn’t feel that tired. A “post-race high” is what a friend called it. As I opened my car door to exit, I literally fell to the pavement. I almost didn’t make it up the stairs to my apartment, but I told myself this was the true end of the triathlon. I got lunch and took one heck of a nap, and feel good now. Will definitely take a bath later.

The Emotions - I hadn’t expected to be so nervous beforehand. It had seemed so fun up until the 2 days prior. I cried more times than I’d like to admit leading up to the race. I also almost cried while looking at my medal once I finished. I have had a very rough year mentally, and this was such a physical and mental challenge. I wanted to quit before the race and during the race (dang swim! 😂). But I challenged myself, and I did it. I was so happy and so proud of myself, and so glad that I finally did a triathlon. I kinda want to make this into a little YouTube video for other people who feel lost doing their first race because I kinda want others to experience the high of finishing a sprint triathlon. 

The Takeaways - I heard people talk about how they’d been training for 6+ months. I went in with 1.5 months and I think that was good. More is better. If I had trained for 5 years, I still would have been nervous… and I still would have made mistakes. The best way to learn in this is to experience it 🤷🏻‍♂️. I would advise people training to find COLD water to swim in. I had only swam in a heated lap pool. I didn’t have a wetsuit (not sure if I’d ever get one, they seem hard to get in and out of if you’re doing it solo). I think swimming in cold water caught me off guard. I wish I could recreate the nervousness around preparing for each new segment. Definitely find a way to get that bib on quicker! I had gone through the full distance twice in my gym before the race. I am so glad I did that, it made the race feel easy. I will probably do that twice a month going into next year. 

The Stats - I didn’t know this until the night before, but they keep track of your times during each section. So, I got 118th overall. 14th in my age group (not sure how those other skeletons and mummies went so fast!). I was 173rd after the swim and the bike. I was 74th in the run (obviously what saved my butt). Even though the swim felt like an eternity, it took 15 minutes. I also ran an 8 minute mile pace… which shocked me the most. I was in midrange overall and in my group. I would love to get a time down to 1:10, but 1:15 seems more achievable. I will take 1:25ish for my first sprint triathlon. 😊

The Final Question - Will I do another one? Definitely 😁",37,1754791187.0,triathlon,2,0.95,False

Plus, even if I see potential for improvement, it's unlikely I could persuade any girl to step out of her comfort zone & glow up.

But I recently met this girl Lanie (18f) who is making me see things differently. My gf had gone to her parents' & I was making drive home & stopping by quaint small towns along the way. I went to get coffee & breakfast for takeout one morning at the diner she worked. She suggested homemade muffin, but I declined. I didn't tip her either as I rarely tip for takeout. But when gave me coffee, I reevaluated her & felt mean. So I told her I was dining in after all & would have a scone.

She looked like your average farmers daughter. Short with some meat on her, pale with freckles & some pimples, long brown hair braided into pigtail, light makeup, round chubby face. I could tell she's painfully shy as she giggled & bit nails when we talked. She's not my type, yet she seemed like such a nice simple girl that I felt protective.

Surprisingly, she reached out & we've been texting with occasional selfies. She told me some of her insecurities & I reassured her (even promised I'll help her get her teeth fixed). Apparently, she still cuddles with her stuffed sheep & I sent a jellycat bunny to her house (she reluctantly shared her address).

>***I noticed recently the topic of water usage has come up again so I thought I'd share this  blog post.  The data should still be accurate.***

I keep seeing these posts about AI water usage that make it sound like ChatGPT is sucking our planet dry. The numbers they throw around sound pretty scary at first. You’ll see reports claiming ChatGPT uses around 5ml of water per query [1](https://www.seangoedecke.com/water-impact-of-ai/), then another article says it’s actually 30ml for a single question [2](https://nationalcentreforai.jiscinvolve.org/wp/2025/05/02/artificial-intelligence-and-the-environment-putting-the-numbers-into-perspective/).

But here’s the thing – when you actually look at the numbers, it gets way more interesting. Yeah, training something like GPT-3 can use between 2 and 15 million liters of water [1](https://www.seangoedecke.com/water-impact-of-ai/). That sounds massive. But your actual daily ChatGPT usage? It’s pretty tiny compared to stuff you do without thinking twice about it.

If you ask ChatGPT five questions a day, you’re looking at about 150ml of water[2](https://nationalcentreforai.jiscinvolve.org/wp/2025/05/02/artificial-intelligence-and-the-environment-putting-the-numbers-into-perspective/). That’s less than a small cup of coffee.

So I’m going to break down what these numbers actually mean – em dashes included – and compare them to things you probably do every day. You might be suprised to find out that your shower uses way more water than all your AI conversations combined. I’ll also explain why some of these numbers you see in headlines can be pretty misleading, and what we should really be paying attention to when we talk about AI’s environmental impact.

# How much water does AI really use?

When researchers started digging into AI’s water footprint, the numbers were all over the place. Let me walk you through what the actual data shows.

**The origin of the 500ml claim**

That “500ml bottle” number everyone talks about came from a 2023 paper by Li et al. Basically, they suggested GPT-3 uses around 500ml of water for every 10-50 medium-length responses [3](https://generative-ai-newsroom.com/the-often-overlooked-water-footprint-of-ai-models-46991e3094b6). But here’s where it gets intresting – location matters a lot. In Arizona, you might hit 500ml after just 17 responses, while in Ireland it would take about 70 responses [3](https://generative-ai-newsroom.com/the-often-overlooked-water-footprint-of-ai-models-46991e3094b6).

The media ran with this estimate pretty hard. You started seeing headlines about ChatGPT “drinking” water with every interaction. Some publications even claimed that generating a 100-word email with GPT-4 could consume more than a full bottle of water (519 milliliters) [4](https://www.businessenergyuk.com/knowledge-hub/chatgpt-energy-consumption-visualized/).

**Updated estimates for ChatGPT water usage**

More recent data suggests those initial numbers were probably too high. Sam Altman from OpenAI recently said each ChatGPT query uses about 0.00032 liters of water – roughly one-fifteenth of a teaspoon [5](https://www.hindustantimes.com/technology/every-chatgpt-query-you-make-uses-water-and-sam-altman-has-revealed-the-exact-figure-101749632092992.html). So you’d need about 1,000 queries to use just 0.32 liters [5](https://www.hindustantimes.com/technology/every-chatgpt-query-you-make-uses-water-and-sam-altman-has-revealed-the-exact-figure-101749632092992.html).

Several researchers have pushed back on the original estimates too. One analysis suggests that when you factor in current model efficiency and typical conversation length, the actual water consumption is closer to 5ml per average conversation, not 500ml [1](https://www.seangoedecke.com/water-impact-of-ai/).

**Inference vs training: which uses more water?**

Here’s something most people don’t realize – training these models uses way more water than actually running them. Training GPT-3 alone probably consumed around 700,000 liters of water at Microsoft’s data centers [3](https://generative-ai-newsroom.com/the-often-overlooked-water-footprint-of-ai-models-46991e3094b6). For something like GPT-4, the water footprint could be about 10 times higher [1](https://www.seangoedecke.com/water-impact-of-ai/).

The water usage comes from three main sources: direct server cooling (which can evaporate 1-9 liters per kWh), electricity generation (averaging 7.6 liters per kWh), and manufacturing components like microchips (8-10 liters per chip) [6](https://cee.illinois.edu/news/AIs-Challenging-Waters).

Data centers globally already consume about 560 billion liters of water annually. Projections suggest this could more than double to 1,200 billion liters by 2030 as AI development ramps up[7](https://www.bloomberg.com/graphics/2025-ai-impacts-data-centers-water-data/).

# How AI water use compares to your daily habits

Alright, so now let’s see how these AI numbers actually stack up against stuff you do every day. Trust me, some of these comparisons are going to surprise you.

**Showering and bathing**

That 8-minute shower you take every morning? It uses about 60,000 milliliters of water[8](https://keryc.com/en/fact-check/ai-consumes-water-daily-habits-myth-reality-23r0PK). That’s like asking ChatGPT 2,000 questions.

And if you’re a bath person, filling up that tub takes around 136 liters [3](https://generative-ai-newsroom.com/the-often-overlooked-water-footprint-of-ai-models-46991e3094b6) – equivalent to over 4,500 AI queries. Even though about 90% of your shower water just goes straight down the drain[9](https://www.kjzz.org/the-show/2025-02-28/how-artificial-intelligence-uses-a-lot-of-water-and-why-thats-a-concern-for-states-like-arizona), you’re still using way more water than any reasonable amount of ChatGPT usage.

**Streaming video and music**

Your digital entertainment habits add up too. Stream music for an hour and you’re looking at about 250ml of water [10](https://www.warpnews.org/artificial-intelligence/ai-usage-has-less-environmental-impact-than-claimed-2/) – roughly 8 times what a single ChatGPT query uses.

That evening Netflix binge? One hour of video streaming or videoconferencing needs between 2-12 liters of water [2](https://nationalcentreforai.jiscinvolve.org/wp/2025/05/02/artificial-intelligence-and-the-environment-putting-the-numbers-into-perspective/). So your typical movie night probably uses more water than dozens of AI conversations combined.

**Using social media and Zoom**

Here’s one that caught me off guard. Scrolling through social media for an hour uses approximately 430ml of water [10](https://www.warpnews.org/artificial-intelligence/ai-usage-has-less-environmental-impact-than-claimed-2/) – about 14 times more than asking ChatGPT a single question.

But the real kicker? A one-hour Zoom call consumes around 1,720ml of water [10](https://www.warpnews.org/artificial-intelligence/ai-usage-has-less-environmental-impact-than-claimed-2/). That’s equivalent to about 57 ChatGPT queries. Remember, if you’re asking ChatGPT five questions daily, that’s only 150ml of water [2](https://nationalcentreforai.jiscinvolve.org/wp/2025/05/02/artificial-intelligence-and-the-environment-putting-the-numbers-into-perspective/) – way less than a single video call.

**Washing clothes and dishes**

Now we’re getting to the heavy hitters. A single load of laundry uses approximately 117,000ml of water [8](https://keryc.com/en/fact-check/ai-consumes-water-daily-habits-myth-reality-23r0PK). To put that in perspective, that’s equivalent to roughly 3,900 AI queries.

Washing dishes consumes around 23,000ml [8](https://keryc.com/en/fact-check/ai-consumes-water-daily-habits-myth-reality-23r0PK) – same as about 766 ChatGPT interactions. Even a single toilet flush uses 6,000ml of water [8](https://keryc.com/en/fact-check/ai-consumes-water-daily-habits-myth-reality-23r0PK), which equals 200 AI queries.

When you look at the big picture, the average person uses anywhere from 175-384 liters of water daily[8](https://keryc.com/en/fact-check/ai-consumes-water-daily-habits-myth-reality-23r0PK). Your ChatGPT usage barely shows up on that scale.

# Why the numbers can be misleading

You’ve probably noticed that different articles give wildly different numbers for AI water usage. There’s a good reason for that confusion – measuring this stuff accurately is actually pretty tricky.

**Different models, different footprints**

The huge differences in AI water usage estimates come down to researchers using completely different approaches [11](https://fas.org/publication/measuring-and-standardizing-ais-energy-footprint/). Some focus on counting AI queries, others look at hardware supply data [11](https://fas.org/publication/measuring-and-standardizing-ais-energy-footprint/). The models themselves vary massively too – a 1 MW data center might consume up to 25.5 million liters of water annually just for cooling [12](https://www.weforum.org/stories/2024/11/circular-water-solutions-sustainable-data-centers/), but smaller, more efficient models can use way less. The current metrics we use to measure data center efficiency often completely miss water consumption [11](https://fas.org/publication/measuring-and-standardizing-ais-energy-footprint/).

**Location and time of day matter**

Here’s something that surprised me – where and when you run AI makes a huge difference. Training the same model uses less water in Iowa than Arizona because of climate differences [13](https://www.globalwaterforum.org/2023/11/02/a-double-edged-sword-ais-energy-water-footprint-and-its-role-in-resource-conservation/). It gets even more specific than that. Running AI operations at midday in California might be great for carbon efficiency due to solar power, but terrible for water efficiency because of the heat [14](https://themarkup.org/hello-world/2023/04/15/the-secret-water-footprint-of-ai-technology). So the “when” and “where” of AI usage can really change its water footprint [14](https://themarkup.org/hello-world/2023/04/15/the-secret-water-footprint-of-ai-technology).

**Cooling systems and water recycling**

The cooling tech makes a massive difference in water usage. Traditional cooling towers use drinking water and lose about 80% of it to evaporation [15](https://www.foodandwaterwatch.org/2025/04/09/artificial-intelligence-water-climate/). But newer tech like air-side economization can cut water usage by 80-90% compared to old methods [16](https://www.gigenet.com/blog/ai-water-consumption-the-hidden-environmental-cost-of-artificial-intelligence/). You’ve got closed-loop systems that recirculate water and immersion cooling that doesn’t need water at all [16](https://www.gigenet.com/blog/ai-water-consumption-the-hidden-environmental-cost-of-artificial-intelligence/). Problem is, less than a third of data center operators actually track their water usage [12](https://www.weforum.org/stories/2024/11/circular-water-solutions-sustainable-data-centers/), so getting clear info about what companies are really doing is pretty challenging.

# What this means for your AI usage

Now that you know where AI actually sits in your water usage, let’s talk about what you can actually do about it. Your individual impact might seem tiny, but when millions of people are using these tools, it does add up.

**Being mindful of unnecessary prompts**

Each time you chat with ChatGPT, you’re using water – roughly 500ml for a conversation of 20-50 questions and answers [14](https://themarkup.org/hello-world/2023/04/15/the-secret-water-footprint-of-ai-technology). So yeah, cutting down on the random “tell me a joke” prompts actually makes a difference. Before you hit send, just ask yourself if this query is actually useful to you.

Plus, being more specific with your questions not only saves water but gets you better answers anyway. Win-win.

**Balancing AI use with other water-saving habits**

Look, AI is just one piece of your environmental footprint. You don’t need to stop using ChatGPT entirely – that’s not realistic. What researchers are saying is that each ChatGPT request is like pouring out a bottle of water [17](https://medium.com/cictwvsu-online/the-environmental-cost-of-ai-why-efficient-prompts-matter-e038186133c3). But remember, your shower this morning used way more.

Instead of avoiding AI tools, I’d focus on supporting companies that are actually investing in better cooling technologies [18](https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/ai-use-water-consumption-conservation-strategies-chester-beard-cungc). And there are AI applications out there helping people save water elsewhere – smart irrigation systems, leak detection, stuff like that.

**The role of transparency from tech companies**

Here’s what’s frustrating – less than one-third of data center operators even track their water usage [19](https://www.whitecase.com/insight-our-thinking/ai-water-management-balancing-innovation-and-consumption). How are we supposed to make good choices when we don’t have the data? The US Government Accountability Office called this out too, saying AI systems are basically “black boxes” even to the people building them [20](https://news.slashdot.org/story/25/04/24/1556239/even-the-us-government-says-ai-requires-massive-amounts-of-water).

Things might change with regulations like the AI Environmental Impacts Act pushing for better reporting [6](https://cee.illinois.edu/news/AIs-Challenging-Waters). Until then, we’re kind of flying blind on the actual numbers.

# Conclusion

Look, most of the conversation around AI water usage misses the bigger picture. Yeah, AI systems use water – that part’s true. But when you actually compare it to your daily routine, it’s pretty small. Those five ChatGPT queries you might do each day? 150ml of water. Your 8-minute shower? 60,000ml. Even a single Zoom call uses 1,720ml.

Don’t get me wrong – I’m not saying we should ignore AI’s environmental impact completely. Training these big models like GPT-4 takes serious resources, and data centers keep using more water every year. But getting worked up about your ChatGPT usage while not thinking about your shower habits doesn’t make much sense.

The real issue here is that tech companies aren’t being transparent about this stuff. You can’t make good choices about your AI use when you don’t have the actual numbers. Less than a third of data center operators even track their water usage. That needs to change.

For most of us, the math is pretty straightforward. Your morning shower or washing machine uses way more water than asking AI questions. Still, being mindful about all your habits – digital and otherwise – is part of being responsible.

I think the key is keeping perspective. AI can be incredibly useful when you use it thoughtfully. Understanding what it actually costs helps you make better decisions instead of just reacting to scary headlines. Next time you use ChatGPT, you’ll know that your coffee probably has a bigger water footprint.

The tech companies need to do better with transparency and efficiency. But in the meantime, you don’t need to feel guilty about using these tools when they genuinely help you get things done.

I used a lot of dating apps, made cold approach outside, talked with couple girls at coffee shops but I didn't gain any success in getting a date. Whenever I approach girls, they are either married, not attracted or minors. I want somebody in my age or older but it seems everybody is segregated from each other.
I have had people telling me to wait for the right person but I do not believe in that theory because if I don't work on myself, I won't be the right person for her. I used Hinge, Tinder, Tantan, and even Feeld with HookUp to get at least casual sex. But afterwards, I realized that I want a real connection with passionate feelings to each other like in romantic anime. My type is mostly Japanese girls since I like their physical appearance but it turns out they're mostly tourists from Japan or already married. I tried to go to  MeetUp events related to Japanese language but I didn't go there and I looked at profile, didn't see any girls around my age. 
I decided to go to other races, like blacks, whites, Hispanics, but all of them don't give a chance to go out on a date. I see a lot of couples outside in LA holding hands and I want to be recognized and loved, I want to build a beautiful future with future spouse. Despite being young, I have a strong desire for mutual and emotional connection with a beautiful woman. I do not consider myself as ""ugly"" but rather as average Azerbaijani guy who looks decent to get a girl. 
I speak 6 languages and I am currently pursuing Business Administration; I tried to talk to girls I liked at my college(Korean and Taiwanese) but it turns out one of them is already engaged while other girl didn't match my interests(she was kind of annoying).
One white girl smiled at me twice on subway while going home and I initiated a conversation with ""what happened to your eyes? Somebody have beaten u? She said no but it's rather because of exhausting work. We had a nice conversation on a train and she said she would love to have a conversation with me again. So, I gave her my Instagram where we continued our conversation. When I was about to arrange a date, she said she's not looking for romantic relationship right now but I said we can be friends, which she agreed. After, I said that maybe we can hang out as friends and she replied with: ""I will let u know on Monday/Tuesday when I am free"". Guess what? She didn't reply back.
Before her, I felt in love with a girl on the bus with SEA appearance and I loved her face covered with mask and ponytail hairstyle along with perfect body. I came up to her while being shy and she was happy to hear my compliments, we talked about our hobbies and studies. She even gave me her Instagram first and we continued a conversation there. It turns out that she already had a husband from the UK and she came back from London. I looked at her Instagram and I saw bunch of boys with her at night club while listening to Cardi B.

My parents and other people persuade me to wait for the right person and build a career but I think I will get only golddiggers. So, do you have any tips of how can I get a girl I like? I don't ask too much and I want a genuine connection with somebody in LA area. I am an international student so I may not be rich for local girls but I promise to be loyal and get a first woman in my life.

At 2 months she smiled for everyone but me. I swore it up and down and everyone said I was crazy. Now at 4 months, she screams when I hold her. She takes an hour to fall asleep when trying to give her naps and doesn’t stay asleep. And She refuses to sleep if I put her to bed at night. 

I sound crazy. But tonight my husband put her down. She can almost self soothe and she was so close to sleeping, just need a little reassurance. I go in there and very gently rub her tummy. She immediately wakes up screaming. I finally get her to calm down only for it to start right back up. My husband comes in the room and she immediately settles because he’s there. He swears that’s not the case but it is. 

She will settle for my mom and my close friends. Even total strangers can settle her better than I can. I’m feeling like I should never have been a mom even though it’s been my dream since I was a little girl. Today I went out alone and got a coffee and went to visit my dad’s grave hoping I could come back with less weight on my chest and be a better mom. Immediately she starts crying when I picked her up but she was fine the whole time I was gone.

Concrete and stone offer a natural, rustic look, while tile provides a more polished and customizable option. Metal tabletops are often powder-coated for weather resistance and come in various colors and finishes. The best tabletops will be heat-resistant and easy to clean.

**Fuel Source:** Most round fire tables utilize either propane or natural gas as their fuel source. Propane models are typically more portable, as they can be connected to a standard propane tank. Natural gas models require a permanent connection to a natural gas line, but they offer a continuous fuel supply without the need for tank refills. Consider your specific needs and available gas connections when choosing a fuel source.

**Construction and Frame:** The construction and frame of the fire table determine its stability and longevity. Look for models with sturdy frames made from rust-proof materials like aluminum or steel. The frame should be able to withstand the elements and provide a stable base for the tabletop and burner system. Some models may also include adjustable feet for leveling on uneven surfaces.

**Safety Features:** Safety is paramount when dealing with open flames. The best round fire tables will incorporate multiple safety features, including flame failure devices, heat shields, and spark screens. Flame failure devices automatically shut off the gas supply if the flame is extinguished, preventing gas leaks. Heat shields protect the surrounding area from excessive heat, while spark screens prevent embers from escaping and causing fires.

**Aesthetics and Design:** Round fire tables come in a wide range of styles to complement any outdoor décor. From modern and minimalist designs to rustic and traditional styles, there's a fire table to suit every taste. Consider the overall aesthetic of your outdoor space and choose a fire table that enhances the existing décor. Some models may also include decorative elements like lava rocks, glass beads, or ceramic logs to enhance the ambiance.

## FAQs Section

**What size round fire table is best for my patio?**
The ideal size depends on the size of your patio and the number of people you typically entertain. A smaller patio may benefit from a 30-inch diameter table, while larger patios can accommodate 48-inch or larger tables. Consider the seating arrangement around the table and ensure there is enough space for people to move comfortably.

**Can I use a round fire table on a wooden deck?**
It depends on the specific fire table and the deck's construction. Always check the manufacturer's instructions and local building codes. Some fire tables are certified for use on wooden decks with proper heat shielding. It's also important to ensure that the deck is structurally sound and can support the weight of the fire table.

**How often should I clean my round fire table?**
Regular cleaning is essential to maintain the appearance and performance of your fire table. Clean the tabletop and burner area regularly with a mild soap and water solution. Remove any debris or buildup from the burner ports to ensure proper gas flow. Refer to the manufacturer's instructions for specific cleaning recommendations.

**What type of fuel is best for a round fire table?**
The best fuel depends on your preferences and available resources. Propane is more portable and convenient for those without a natural gas line. Natural gas provides a continuous fuel supply without the need for tank refills. Consider the cost of each fuel source and the convenience of refilling or connecting to a gas line.

1mm67qf,https://www.reddit.com/r/Discipline/comments/1mm67qf/12_simple_habits_that_completely_changed_my_life/,12 simple habits that completely changed my life (wish I started these sooner),"Two years ago, I was that person who had zero routine, felt constantly overwhelmed, and wondered why successful people seemed to have their shit together while I was barely surviving.

Turns out, it wasn't about motivation or talent. It was about the small things I did (or didn't do) every single day.

Here are the 12 habits that literally transformed my life:

1. Making my bed every morning. Sounds stupid, but it's an instant win before 7AM. Sets the tone that today, I get things done.

2. Writing down 3 priorities the night before. No more waking up wondering ""what should I do today?"" Your brain already knows the plan.

3. Reading for 20 minutes instead of scrolling. Swapped mindless scrolling for actual books. My focus improved, anxiety dropped. Also helped me stop being overwhelmed all the time.

4. Walking without headphones. Gave my brain time to process instead of constantly consuming. Best ideas come during these walks.

5. Drinking water before coffee. Your body is dehydrated after 8 hours. Hydrate first, then caffeinate. More energy, less crashes. Best if you drink at the afternoon.

6. Saying ""no"" without explaining why. ""I can't make it"" is a complete sentence. Stopped over-justifying and people respected my boundaries more.

7. Batch cooking on Sundays. Removed the daily ""what am I eating?"" stress. Healthier choices became automatic.

8. Setting a phone curfew at 9PM. Best sleep of my life. No more 2AM rabbit holes that left me exhausted the next day.

9. Writing down wins at the end of each day. Even tiny ones. It rewired my brain to notice progress instead of just problems.

10. Taking cold showers. Builds mental toughness for everything else. If you can handle 2 minutes of cold water, you can handle difficult conversations.

11. Cleaning as I go. Instead of letting dishes pile up, I wash as I cook. Small effort, massive peace of mind. Same as bathing. I clean my clothes while I bath.

12. Asking ""Will this matter in 5 years? stopped me from stressing about 90% of things. Perspective is everything.

This didn't change my life overnight but after 30 days I noticed a significant result. Hope this motivates you to do the same habits as well.",40,1754790306.0,Discipline,0,1.0,False

We had both gotten out of relationships a few months prior to us meeting and didn’t have high expectations when we decided to meet in person. It was summer, I was about to move back to my hometown, and he had started traveling more often because he had started driving trucks over the road. 

Well, when there are no expectations, that seems to be when life surprises you. 

To summarize things, I ended up going over the road with him and we traveled around the USA all summer. Most states we both had never been to so it was an amazing experience for us both. I don’t regret it and it’s the happiest time of my life. 

Once I went home, he faded away. Our 4 and 5 hour calls once I got off of work dwindled down to 45 minutes or less, then just ended. I was depressed for a few months then realized I had to move on, so I did. 

Fastforward to 10 years later and he has found me on social media. After spending my 20s going through things and meeting people who made me appreciate my solitude and not need a partner, it’s safe to say that him reaching out has jarred me. He ended up living out his dreams and doing exactly what he said he was going to do. I am so happy for him. 

He finally told me what happened with us, too. He was only 22 at the time. Immature. Had big feelings for me but knew he would probably mess it up. He also wasn’t ready because he knew he couldn’t provide or give me what I needed. He said he knew if he didn’t walk away he would have disappointed me and he also couldn’t have just told me he wasn’t ready because no one should be waiting around on someone to be ready. 

I accepted the explanation because he has always known me too well and I knew deep down he was right. I would have tried to wait. 

He also had some mental health issues that hadn’t been addressed, and I did, too. Which I’m now wondering if that’s how we ended up in the whirlwind “romance” situation we ended up in in the first place. 

But here’s the issue. 

He got married last year to someone he met about 4 years after me. 

I found out myself by looking him up. His wife is beautiful, but he looked miserable in the wedding photos. 

I realized he was miserable when he kept mentioning how much he thought about me and what we could have been. Mentioned how they have a few differences and they almost didn’t get married. Then, he asked me out twice. First just for coffee, then for dinner. I rejected him both times and finally just had to block him. 

But he has thrown my calm little world upside down. I keep looking at long forgotten pictures. Remember and dreaming of real experiences and conversations from our past. I have never been as connected to a person as I was connected to him. 

We spent over 3 months in close proximity, and still both cried when I knew I had to get back to my life. We never tired of each other. 

I guess what I’m asking for is advice on getting my footing back. How do I get over this and go back to the person I was before I read his first returning message? 

I already grieved him once when he left my life the first time. How do I grieve the life that could’ve been? The life that won’t be? It almost feels like I’m that 19 year old girl again, wondering where I went wrong (I AM in therapy, btw, so I have talked about it. I just want to hear some opinions and advice from people who can absolutely be as unprofessional as possible toward me). 

TL;DR: Lover from 10 years ago returns. He is married but regrets it. He has been blocked, but he has shook up my emotions in a way they haven’t been shook up in in 10 years. I need advice on how to work through these emotions.

I’m looking for a native English speaker to help me review the English translation of my novel.  
The original was written in Portuguese, and I translated using my own knowledge plus the help of AI. Now I’d love to hear if it flows naturally to a native reader.

No need to read the whole thing, just 3 chapters will do. I’m mainly looking for feedback on flow, dialogue authenticity, and whether any phrases feel “off” to someone who grew up speaking English.

The story is a historical romance set in early 20th-century Brazil,  during the coffee empire days, with a mix of humor, social commentary, and a slow-burn romance. 

**About the book:**  
*São Paulo, 1913. Emilia Anastasia Junqueira has been raised to be the picture of perfection: beautiful, educated, obedient — but with far too many ideas for a young woman of her standing. When she crosses paths with Samuel, a gifted artisan from a humble background, Emilia discovers a kind of love that neither grand balls nor family arrangements can explain.*  
*Torn between the conveniences of her name and desires she barely dares to name, she begins to test the limits of the society that shaped her. Beneath the masks of Carnival, amid whispered promises and silences that shout, The Heart and the Society reveals what lies behind every family’s façade — and shows that some feelings, once awakened, can never be hidden again.*

I love book recommendations and good cups of coffee or tea. I have a wide range of interests and hobbies, but never enough time to do them all or to become an expert in them (which honestly is fine by me - it makes things more interesting!) I love to travel and explore museums to learn new things. I also enjoy inappropriate jokes - for instance, the word of the day is legs - want to go spread them? 

I'm 5'8 and of a similar size to Melissa McCarthy the actress, with thick red hair and blue eyes and I wear glasses.  I have my ears pierced and four tattoos that are personally meaningful and I've helped design. 

• I am a mezzo soprano and have sung in choirs as well as on stage as a part of an ensemble.
• I love to bake, and make some of the best chocolate chip cookies you'll ever eat
• I love to play board games and own over 150 games, with a range of area control, Euro, deck builders, racing games, large group games and dice games.
• I love to read and devour many books a year. I also love book recommendations.  
• I enjoy bowling, mini-golf, and slow but steady hiking or long walks.

I love learning new things - some which make me hyperfocus for hours on end and some that I simply love to get into because others are into it and are teaching me. In that regard, I'm happy to be brought on a learning journey. 

I'm a high school history teacher and I'm about to start my 17th year teaching. I've worked retail before and been a National Scorekeeper for volleyball. I tend to put in 60-70 hour work weeks during the school year because I love my job so much and never want to stay stagnant.  But that doesn't mean I don't have time for someone - I have time to both get to know and to date someone.

I love quality time with people - both in person and in messages to one another. I love depth and complexity - I want to know you and who you are. I love dates where we lose track of time because we're lost in conversation with one another.

I'm an out-going extrovert who often gets asked to be in leadership roles. I enjoy initiating and helping lead, but I also have another side to me. I am kinky and a submissive. I see it as a part of me and something that is always there, even if I don't show it often in my day to day life (though I can argue it's said I'm a good teacher soldier because I refuse to move towards administration.)

My friends describe me as positive, optimistic,  creative, compassionate, and on occasion mischievous. I am good at matching moods and needs and have been told I can remember things that friends don't remember ever telling me. 

**My poly journey**

I've been poly for the past 6 and a half years which is when I met my now nesting partner. I did a lot of work and research to be comfortable with not just him being poly but to also try it myself. My NP leans parallel and I'm also fine with parallel or in meeting your polycule.

**What I can offer:**

* Feelings
* Frequent dates
* Even more frequent communication
* Overnights and the occasional weekends, potentially vacations after a while
 
**What I can't offer:**

* I'm not looking to cohabitate, combine finances, or have children. I am happy with where I am with my NP and I have no desire to have children at this stage in my life.
* I wouldn't be able to host at my house at this point in time - my home is my NP and my place together. If you have a place that is more conducive to sharing, I am also more than happy to contribute groceries, cooking, cleaning, etc.
* I am not 420 friendly - the smoke and smell give me strong headaches. I'm ok with alcohol and caffeine, but that's about it.

**What I'm looking for:**

I am hoping to find someone who also has a partner or some sort of hierarchy in their own lives. While you don't have to be married (as I'm not), I hope you're in a serious relationship or solo poly who values independence. I'm also open to being a comet, if you're someone who travels often to the Dallas/Fort Worth area of Texas, or who wants to meet up within a 3-4 hour driving radius. 
  
I'm open to a variety of personalities and types. I get along well with people who love math and science even if I'm not a math or science person myself. I am someone who loves to listen and learn, and I am very accepting and non-judgemental.

My girlfriend (27F) and I (30M) are looking for 2-3 other roommates to apartment hunt with for a mid-to-late-August or September 1st move-in at the latest. We've already been looking at units and would like to sign a lease within the next 10 days.

✨ Where we're looking: Primarily Bushwick, Ridgewood, Williamsburg, and East Williamsburg (ideally anywhere within an 8-10 minute walk to at least two train lines).

💸 Money stuff: We're looking for roommates who have a budget of at least $1100. My gf and I would pay a higher rent for our shared room (ideally between $1600-$2000), and we have a guarantor ready if needed.

👥 About us: I bartend a karaoke bar and keep a pretty well-stocked home bar that we can all enjoy. I'm originally from South Texas but have lived in Brooklyn since 2018. I'm also a bit of a coffee hobbyist, so I have a pretty solid espresso setup that I'd be happy to share with roommates, as well as a french press, V60, and moka pot.

My gf is a barista and works the front desk at a preschool while finishing up her Master's in International Migration Studies. She's originally from California but has lived in nyc since 2016. She loves keeping plants around the apartment and also pole dances for fun/exercise, so we have a pole that could be kept in the common area if anyone else is interested in using it.

💥 Other info: We are very leftist and pro-Palestine, so we’re definitely looking for people who align with those values. Fellow queer people and BIPOC are also preferred, but we’d be happy to hear from anyone who thinks they’d be a good fit with us. We are relatively clean and keep late hours due to work. We’d love the occasional roommate dinner, game or movie night but totally respect personal space and quiet time. 420 friendly and generally open minded about most things.

While we don’t currently have any pets, we have fostered cats in the past and would love roommates open to us fostering or who have a cat of their own. We also have a lot of living room furniture and kitchen supplies but we’re open to mixing our things or using yours instead.

Feel free to pm me and share your social media handles (if you feel comfortable doing so). We’re totally down to text, video chat, or meet up to get to know each other better before committing to anything.",1,1754789705.0,NYCroommates,1,1.0,False

1mm5yco,https://i.redd.it/3phwtqg5i3if1.jpeg,"Struggling with rude, disrespectful in-laws","Hi everyone!

Sorry for huge post. I just need space to rant! Would love to hear any different perspectives/suggestions.

I'm (24F) seeking advice on dealing with rude and inconsiderate in-laws. For the sake of my partner (27M), I tried to maintain a good relationship with them even when they failed to respect our relationship and after continuous disrespect. I have tried hard to appease them, but they fail to acknowledge any of my efforts and continue to treat me with hostility. **I want their behaviour to change because it is putting a strain on my relationship with my partner, and I don't want him to lose his relationship with his family purely for my sake.** However, for the sake of my peace and mental health, I want to cut contact with them until they can show us some respect.

**Background**

The specific in-laws are a triad consisting of BIL (30M), SIL (30F), and MIL (60F). BIL, SIL and partner (from here on, 'X') had lived together for a number of years and were very close. BIL and SIL met when they were both 17 and were each other's first relationship. X, 3 years younger, had grown up in this dynamic and became close with SIL. SIL regularly texted and called X until later events (which I'll later describe). SIL and X shared a close bond, but it was seemingly one-sided. SIL would call X to talk about her problems, but X felt as if he could not do the same. I believe she felt entitled to X's time and attention, but did not see him as an individual with his own life.

I am X's first relationship. Things were fine when we first started dating re in-laws. I thought they were being inappropriate in the amount of attention they were giving me; however, I can understand that they were excited that X finally got a girlfriend. For example, they sent me friend requests on all my social media accounts within the first month of my dating X. It felt less like they wanted to get to know me and more like they wanted to gather intel about me. Then, they added me to the family group chat -- something I had no interest in being part of, especially that early within our relationship.

It was overbearing, and I felt it was inappropriate for them to continue injecting themselves into our new relationship. As someone who doesn't have a close relationship with my family, I was overwhelmed with this new family dynamic I had entered into. However, they were generally pleasant to deal with. I tried to keep a polite distance.

Within the third month of our relationship, they pressured me into visiting them after Christmas. Of course, I was glad to do it because I wanted to be with my partner. The problem was that X and I live very far away from the in-laws -- at least 5 hours by plane (incl. a 3 hr journey to the nearest airport that could take us there). As a 21 yo student working minimum wage jobs, going there was a substantial financial sacrifice. It was around $500AUD for a return flight to X's family, as well as a $90AUD bus journey to get to and from the airport.

They were generally passive-aggressive when I met them for the first time. They had little interest in my life. BIL was obviously rude to me, but everyone (incl. X) made excuses for him by saying he was just 'trying to act like a brother to me' or was just 'trying to break the ice'. I thought it was inappropriate, especially when I felt like it was borderline harassing me. He called me a 'stupid bitch' and would make comments designed to demonstrate his superior knowledge/intellect. I ignored these comments, but they really bothered me. X did not defend me or tell BIL off, which annoyed me.

After the first trip, his family repeatedly pressured us to come up for 'family events.' They ignored the financial strain this would put on us. When we suggested we could not go for these reasons, they would call us and beg us to come. They would accuse X of not caring about his family or ignoring them.  When I could not go to 'family events' because of uni or work-related commitments, they would repeatedly bring it up and ask why I could not go. They would not accept my excuses. Most egregiously, they criticised me and X for failing to attend a *distant* relative's celebration (celebrating his career in politics) because it was in our city. They implied that we do not care about the family, and were neglecting our familial duties -- whatever those may be.

During my first Christmas with X, SIL and BIL got pregnant. We were excited for them. However, they acted to assert their top position within a 'family hierarchy.' They dictated when we should go up to see them and for how long. In one instance, SIL begged X to stay with her because she suspected she was about to give birth, even though we had booked flights for the next day and could not receive a refund if we cancelled them. There was no suggestion from anyone that they would compensate us for the flights. Regardless, I didn't think X needed to be there for his niece's birth. I wouldn't have done the same for BIL because that is not within the nature of our relationship.

BIL and SIL would continue to harass us about seeing them and their baby, 'A'. If we could not make a family event, they would accuse us to their friends and others of 'hating baby A.'

SIL's bio sister also got pregnant around the same time and gave birth to a son. SIL would disparage her sister's baby by calling it 'uglier' than hers, not as bright, and not as cute. She accused her brother's wife of mistreating A, and of course also said that their baby was not as cute as 'baby A.' Everything centred around them and their baby. They refused to accept that anyone else (incl. us and X's bio sister, 24F) had their own lives, and could not rush to see 'baby A' whenever they wanted.

Since MIL was the only other member of the family living in that city, she formed an intensely close bond with BIL and SIL. When we went up to see them, they would typically sit around the couch and gossip about their friends. SIL, while maintaining a facade of friendliness, was incredibly snarky and bitchy about others. I wondered what they were saying about me and X, particularly when they were often bold enough to insult me in front of everyone. MIL would also accuse X (but implicating me because X had somehow 'changed') of not caring enough about 'baby A' or calling them enough. She would comment on our perceived lack of support for them. She would hint that X had changed since meeting me.

I felt uncomfortable around them because I felt like they were always judging me. They seemed to have an issue with the fact that I was a 'southerner' (in Australia?? As if that matters...) and projected this opinion onto me that they were 'bogans' -- something I had never even slightly suggested. They like to portray themselves as more sophisticated than everyone else, particularly within their city. I think they are insecure about how they are perceived, and they project that insecurity onto me as a 'southerner' who they believe considers them bogans. X confirmed this with me, saying that he was afraid of judgment in the 'south' when he first came down. Safe to assume this 'northerner' inferiority complex came from them.

In sum, I have been uncomfortable with them since I met them because:

* They acted inappropriately when X and I first started dating by inserting themselves into our new relationship
* They ostracised me and X for failing to be more present in the family, or for not supporting SIL and BIL enough with 'baby A'
* They would pressure us into visiting them even when it came at great financial cost, would not acknowledge the financial burden it put on us -- would shame us when we could not go up to see them
* They would directly insult me
* They viewed me and X as extensions of themselves rather than as individuals/a couple with a distinct life -- this dictated their attitude towards us

**Christmas 2024**

Last Christmas (2024), their family friend had a wedding in a different state. MIL, BIL and SIL had the idea of hosting us all in Victoria for Christmas. They wanted to have a big 'family' Christmas, centring themselves and 'baby A.'

MIL paid for everything (except our transport to and from Victoria). However, BIL and SIL started acting as if it were solely their vacation. Everything we did centred around 'baby A' (who was around 15 months), and they would get very passive-aggressive when we took too long to go somewhere or when we said we did not want to go. For example, on the day of the wedding, SIL decided that everyone must go to a zoo for 'baby A' and accused us of being lazy and disorganised when we did not get ready on time. When I told her I was ready to go, SIL said, 'Really?' and pressured me into changing out of what I was wearing, a basic t-shirt and shorts. When I quickly went to change, she got openly frustrated about how slow we were being and how we were threatening 'baby A's' time at the zoo.

At the zoo, SIL and BIL would get upset whenever X and I would leave them. She would comment on how we did not spend time with the family and A. Later, she would moan about how she felt the family was drifting apart. They rejected that X and I could spend time together alone. As an introvert, it was exhausting for me to go to all of these 'family events.' I was frustrated at the lack of consideration for our needs.

When we arrived at our accommodation after the wedding, BIL and SIL immediately claimed the master bedroom (which is natural for new parents). They then pressured me and X into taking the bedroom with two twin beds instead of MIL, who was single and happy to sleep in a single bed by herself. SIL would loudly talk about how the MIL 'deserved' the other double bedroom because she had booked the holiday, how it would be nice for her to enjoy a coffee there, etc. Very virtue-signal-y. MIL rejected this, saying that X and I should take the double bed since we are a couple. However, SIL continued to press this issue, even when X and I accepted taking the single beds.

Eventually, MIL told X and I to take the double bed, which angered SIL. SIL would continue to talk about how MIL's holiday was ruined by taking the single bed, and how she had paid for everything and how we were ungrateful. There were three double bedrooms and one bedroom with two single beds for 3 couples and 1 single MIL. X's sister and her partner were not pressured into taking the single beds, only me and X. Not to mention that they had also claimed a double bedroom for themselves without consulting MIL. They placed the burden on us to give up sleeping in the same bed so that MIL could take a larger bed. Of course, I understood that as MIL paid for accommodation, she could claim whichever bedroom she liked. However, it was insulting that they expected me and X to sacrifice sleeping together in the same bed, and did not press the issue with anyone else. They did not respect us or our relationship enough to concede the double bed to us, even at the insistence of MIL.

Every night, SIL would insist that the entire family watch her bathe 'baby A.' SIL would announce to everyone, 'time for baby A's bath!' and MIL would pressure us into watching it. If we decided we didn't want to watch A's bath, we were accused of hating her. This would happen every single night; however, eventually, the majority of us came to ignore her.

One night, I did the dishes after dinner because everyone had gone to watch baby A's bath. I did them all without being asked. Not only did they refuse to acknowledge that I had done this, but the next day they complained that X and I 'never helped.' BIL insisted everyone clean up after dinner that day, but the sink was so small that only 2 people could stand around it at a time. When we did not help wash the dishes (impossible to do without literally stepping on people's toes), BIL said, 'You guys are being so selfish; I can't believe you're not going to help us; etc.' I felt really annoyed about this, especially given that I had always helped around their house when we came to visit them.

X and I put a lot of effort into picking out gifts for them (and spent a lot of money, too). We came with around 20-25 gifts, including 'joke' gifts that didn't have any real gifts in them (they were not addressed to anyone). I want to emphasise that we brought almost an absurd amount of gifts; however, the majority of the gifts were directed towards each other, and we brought at least 5 'joke' gifts. For the others, we gave them 2-3 little gifts each -- hardly that generous. We did this because we were committed to having a fun Christmas with everyone.

However, this seemed to annoy SIL and BIL a lot. Before we unloaded the presents, SIL and BIL claimed they were 'too poor' to get anyone gifts. Fine, I guess -- but they were about to sell their house and had lived as DINKs for the past 10 years. When we revealed all the presents we got for everyone, they seemed embarrassed and quickly went to buy everyone gifts themselves. Before they did that, they would say (unprompted), 'There actually aren't that many presents this year; it's just because we have so many people.'

Once they had all their gifts, they hid the gifts we brought behind theirs. They had wrapped theirs better and with more expensive wrapping paper, as if to emphasise their sophistication. I placed a small gift on the makeshift Christmas tree they made, and they removed it. Why did it matter to them where I placed the gifts I got them? I couldn't understand it.

SIL also booked a 'girls' spa day' for everyone, stressing that it was her 'treat' to us. The 'girls' consisted of me, X's bio sister, SIL and MIL. When she announced to everyone that she did this, she asked me whether I could wake up on time for it. Admittedly, I had just broken my sobriety to celebrate Christmas and overindulged a lot, so I would often wake up after them. But X's sister and partner would wake up around the same time as me, too, which was hardly that late in the day (around 10 am).

On this spa day, SIL insisted on taking photos as a group. X's bio sister and I wanted to do a pose. When I did the pose, SIL physically batted my hands down and told me to stop. All I did was raise my hands to my chest to imitate a begging dog. I thought, why does she care what I do in a photo I don't even want to be in?

There were too many annoying instances to talk about. Whenever we didn't spend time with them, they guilted us and accused us of not caring about their baby. Eventually, they started excluding US from events! They then twisted the narrative into us being withdrawn, implicating me.

X confronted them about their behaviour months later over text. At the time, I did not want anything to do with them so I didn't read it. I let him sort out their behaviour and told him I was going NC with them because it was affecting my mental health. As someone who has a multitude of mental and social issues as well as general life stresses (uni, work, etc.), I did not have the emotional capacity to deal with them. I wanted them gone from my life. I also wanted X to show me support. It was difficult for him because they are his family, but I was frequently disappointed in his failure to take action and set firm boundaries with them.

I just saw the texts he sent to them. He was respectful, and made it clear that he wanted reconciliation. However, they completely misinterpreted the texts he sent them. When X brought up SIL's competitiveness re MIL and passive aggression towards me, they twisted that into my being jealous of their relationship! I have no interest in a relationship with my MIL at this point, particularly one of the sort SIL has with her. They gave us insincere apologies and reiterated that they 'genuinely like' me. Their actions do not support that statement. Since then, there was little effort towards reconciliation. They still expected X to drop everything for them. Most frustratingly, they did not understand their behaviour at all and so have made no effort to 'improve' (as they told X they would). 

**Main Issue**

SIL and BIL moved to the 'south' this year. They are now 3 hrs away by bus. We have had no end of grief since because we no longer have an excuse for not visiting them. Our roommate's family lives in their new city, and we often go up to visit. For obvious reasons, I did not see them any time we went up. But I did not stop X from seeing them, and often urged him to do so just to maintain civility.

SIL and BIL scheduled A's christening the day after my birthday. It would have been difficult for X to go up on the day of the christening, so the scheduling essentially meant that X would either have to leave me on my birthday night (obviously, I wanted him to be there with me) or not attend. They guilted X into going after he told them he might not be able to attend. 

I wanted to compromise, so I told X that I wanted to have my birthday in their city anyway. I told him that I would prefer it because I could go to a restaurant I liked. However, I was deeply upset that I was forced to change my plans to accommodate their needs. I felt devalued. I was so frustrated because I felt like they were never going to change. I thought they were going to keep trying to interfere with my life even when I went NC and X went LC.

I had a huge fight with X the night of the christening. It triggered some deep emotional wounds, and I acted terribly. I regret how I acted, and my actions taught me that I need to address my mental health urgently. Because of everything, I have entered a really poor emotional state. I neglected my uni duties for days in order to write this post lol.

X confronted them around a week later, essentially telling them to fuck off and leave us alone. He told them that their behaviour has not changed and that he refuses to engage with them until they show a genuine attempt to reconcile. 

BIL sent X an emotionally charged text accusing us of being crazy and sad. Photo is attached. 

**Sorry for long post everyone. I needed space to vent. I want to call them out publicly for their actions, but I know that is an unhealthy response. I thought it would be better to post it here. Also, please enjoy BIL outburst.**",0,1754789513.0,inlaws,1,0.5,False
