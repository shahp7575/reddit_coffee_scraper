1qcrk0k,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/1qcrk0k/having_trouble_deciding_if_i33m_was_cheated_on_by/,Having trouble deciding if I(33M) was cheated on by my girlfriend(34F),"My girlfriend and I had a argument one night and the next day she was on a work shift for 3 days. I could tell certain little things did not add up which led to me confronting her. She lied and lied continuously ALL NIGHT and even tried to insinuate that I was going crazy until eventually when I gave her a safe ""out"" and said something like ""but I could understand if you lied because we got in an argument and I would understand if you needed space"", then finally she admitted that yes she lied to me about going to work because she wanted space. she is a flight attendent so she had to use her FMLA which she only can use once a month to call out of work.

She said that she ran errands, hung out with a couple whom I've met, and took a train into the city to see an old friend to get her Macbook fixed.

Most of her guy friends are past hookups so I asked about the old friend and it was a dude I never heard her mention before.

She initiated contact with him, and her text convo was like this:

Her: are you free the next few days?

Him: maybe why?

Her: im sad

Him: hmm gimmie the context

Her: but im just sad. He was the closest I was looking for in a relationship. But sigh, I cant. Anyway what you up to the next couple of days we can hang out or get coffee

Him: right but what time?

It sounds like she made it seem like we broke up! it also looks like a text was deleted before the ""but im just sad"" text because she started a sentence with ""but"" and referred to me as ""he"" without any context.

Its so suspicious that she initiated contact and first thing she tells him is insinuating that we broke up when we didnt? It also seems like he is a previous fuck-buddy and thats why he immediately was like ""right what time?"", because he knows his role and just wants to talk about logistics like when we meeting up. When I bring this up to her she just denies denies denies and said she was just emotionally venting.

Her chat history with him was deleted and it said she blocked him on December 26th and un-blocked him on December 28th. Whats strange is that Dec25th was the day she made our 1 year relationship official on instagram so I am wondering if there is a connection? Her excuse was that he made fun of our matching pajamas. 

Also she never wanted to make our relationship public there was always an excuse, I had to practically beg her to make that insta post. Any ""insta story"" with us was always a ""close friend"" story and never fully public so to me it was a big deal when she made an actual post of us together.

The instagram picture post of us is still up to this day so that guy would have seen it. They also have disappearing messages turned on to expire after 24hours. Which further makes me think this dude is just a fuck-buddy she goes to whenever she feels like it and he accepts his role.

Her excuse was hes just an old friend and she wanted to get her macbook fixed because he gave it to her and he had to get the admin password reset which he did not remember, I read their entire text convo and NOWHERE did they talk about a Macbook.

The only reasons I have doubt that she cheated is because:

1. She admitted she went to see this guy when she really didn't have to, I never would have guessed 
2. Her laptop being broken was a topic of discussion in the past and that an old friend  gave it to her
3. She showed me the text messages. (even though she technically had a 30second window to delete some texts if she wanted to, I have no idea if she did though), and there is literally nothing else suspicious about her text convo, they just talked like friends and the guy even sent her a screenshot of a girl he was talking to on a dating app and went on a date with.

After a couple days I reached out to the guy and he never got back to me, but he told my girlfriend.

I spent a few hours one day with her, no drama, and I finally asked her about the guy again because I still had some questions and thats when she started packing up her shit from my place and saying that contacting the guy without her consent was crossing a line. That she wants to break up and after we went back and forth she said she will stay but that I can't keep talking about the guy and accusing me of ""youll never believe me or forgive me so whats the point"". 

She wouldnt even show me the texts of the guy telling her I contacted him which I think is suspicious because she showed me the other texts before so why not now? Also why did she wait until I brought up the guy to have this grandiose reaction? She had all day to have that reaction but it seemed like it was ""staged"" and waiting for me whenever I brought him up. I feel like I am being manipulated like shouldnt she WANT to give me reassurance since I am in the middle of a trust crisis instead of denying me transparency?

She also refuses to admit that this guy was a past hookup which I have a strong feeling is a lie because:

1.  she said they met at a party and just became friends and nothing ever escalated beyond friendship (like cmon who the fuck meets at a party and just becomes friends). its like she doesnt want to admit they met on a dating app 

2. I saw some of her instagram comments on his pics from around 2021 when they met, he has a pic of city graffiti of a woman captioned ""found this beautiful girl"" and she commented on it saying ""well...shit""

3. she is in some of his pics at restaurants because his instagram is mostly a ""food blog"" 

4. Dude only has 1 picture of himself on his instagram and its allll the way back in 2015 and its him smiling and she liked that picture. he does look attractive enough.

5. all the guy-friends she has are previous hookups except this one? what a coincidence. (I  know how this sounds but she really does only text them, they never hang out. I know this because she spends every second of her free time with me and she uses her once a month FMLA to hang out with me also. Which is how I even knew something was off in the first place that she didnt go to work because her patterns changed. I always let her having ""text-only friends"" with previous hookups slide because she literally has no actual friends and her family lives in another country so I felt pity for her and accepted this as a weird quirk)

  
Am I being totally fucked with? I know that I should break up with her because I shouldnt be under so much stress its just I really wish I had CONCRETE PROOF ya know?",1,1768407530.0,relationship_advice,0,1.0,False
1qcrjuq,https://www.reddit.com/r/Advice/comments/1qcrjuq/depression_and_isolation_friendship/,"Depression and isolation, friendship","Hi all,  
  
I need external perspectives.  
Please be kind! There will be a lot of contradictions in what I say. It’s literally an inner struggle between the voice of depression and the voice of reason fighting back.  
  
I am currently having one of the hardest time of my life.   
I am literally hitting the bottom rock. I have been diagnosed with depression. I must say it's kind of severe since I have had intrusive thoughts. It has been 1,5 monts that I am under medication. It helped in the 2 first weeks with my energy level but not anymore. I am trying to be patient to see if it evolves positively.  
I have been truly reluctant to the idea of taking antidepressants but at the end, I felt like it was necessary, especially while having dark thoughts.  
  
I am suffering from my situation. Health wise I also have other issues which impact my chronic fatigue. I am always exhausted. I feel like life is heavy and I lost my spark.  
I have always been a solar person. The one that brings joy and some good vibes. My mission for a long time was at least to make one person smiles per day. I have been always told that I carry a warmth and light that are rare. Yet, I have always suffered deep down from sadness, an extreme solitude and/or a void feeling (no one saw it, let's say it something I was dealing with internally).  
Since kid, I question friendships. I often ask myself if I am too demanding. I know I carry a rejection fear. I am actively working on it with a therapist. I have regularly felt people were more attached/close to me that I am to them. I have been bridesmaid a few time.  
My love language is quality time and act of service. I always make sure those friends were able to rely on me and spend good time while being together. I have never been shallow and my connections are on a deep level.   
The way I love being loved is by gifting and quality time. For a long time, I barely received any gifts from friends. I was the first one in the year to have my bday and I wasn't organizing any parties. I didn't get engaged, married, pregnant or having a house... What I wanna say is  ppl used to gift on special occasions. I feel appreciated when I am receiving small gestures. It doesn't have to be big. It's more the thought of it that matters. The fact someone took time to think what can make me happy. I always felt left out. Even during my milestone, I didn't get any gifts. I have always been added to group chat to offer common gifts but no one ever created a group chat for a common gift for me.

Anyways, since the depression got worse, I barely go outside and I don't speak to anyone. My environment is toxic which is not helping me to recover. But I don't have the energy atm to change it.   
Responding to text messages seems like a mountain to climb. I freeze. And I hate replying to texts which ask me how am I while I am struggling to keep myself alive. I am not purposely ignoring friends who text me but the idea of having to reply to them seems draining. It's absurd since I feel guilty for not replying. This ambivalence is killing me inside.   
  
I am so lonely. I promised myself to reply to friends who offer to hang out. I need to distract myself to escape from my own thoughts. Yet only 2 friends occasionally asked me to hang out in the past months ( I am grateful for that). No one seems to care about me. At least that's my thoughts but rationally I know some friends do but just don't know to act.  
I just wish they will be more involved and acting. They say good things like if you need help or anything, we are here for you.  
But tbh it doesn't feel like it. No one bother to try to call me, or my family member to know what's going on while I didn't reply for months.  
No one came at my house to visit.  
All my friends went on silent mode except to text every two months or so to know how am I.   
Is it too much of me to expect my friends to take action and initiate an outing, offer to go to brunch, have a coffee, invite me over to watch a movie?   
You might think it's easy just ask them to take the lead and explain you have to rely on someone, don't plan anything since it's almost impossible for me take action.  
It actually costs me a lot of my energy to do so. I have expressed it to some but it seems like they forget about me or do not care.   
I am tired of not having a supportive circle. I wish people will show me that I matter instead of just saying it.  
Is it too much to ask for?

I know no one is coming to save me. I am not asking for that. I am just in need of kindness.  
I tried to find communities, support group in my region but I still don't have a lead.",1,1768407520.0,Advice,1,1.0,False
1qcrjqg,https://www.reddit.com/r/datingoverfifty/comments/1qcrjqg/heres_one_for_the_books/,Here's one for the books!,"I took the past year off from dating after a LTR ended, and in November decided to get on the apps.  This was my first time trying OLD, and I set out with clear expectations of what I was looking for + no rush to get into a relationship…taking it slow, but optimistic.

I narrowed my scope and within a week made plans with someone who stood out.  His profile intrigued me.  He was 14 years older (a youthful looking 64), generally handsome, with kind eyes and a great smile.  He was semi-retired from a family jewelry business, and mentioned that during the 80’s he’d lived in LA and worked at The Gauntlet, which he explained was a popular scene sort of place back in the day, famous for piercings and tattoos.  I have none of those except for the same pierced ears I’ve had since I was 12.   I didn’t think much of this, or why he specifically added that piece of his life to his dating bio, until later.  

The week leading up to our date, we had a couple of fun banter video chats.  On balance, our conversations were really interesting.  He asked great questions, was engaging and curious, and openly shared many things about himself.  There was a fair amount of flirting, but nothing over the top.  We expressed our excitement about meeting one another, and decided he would come visit me on my turf, about 45 minutes from where he lives.  

Behind the scenes, my assistant had already done a full background check.  No problems there.  In doing so, she found his social media, and that’s when it was discovered we had a mutual friend.  This was a great surprise for me, so of course I reached out to have her give me the scoop.  She said he was a good guy, but that he was “a big Trumper” and she was surprised at our matching because I am deeply the opposite.  My OLD profile clearly states my political view, with an earnest request that no MAGA need apply.  I found this out the day of our date, so I took a deep breath and reconsidered meeting him altogether…but morbid curiosity won out.  

We decided he would bring his dog in case things turned into overnight.  I was on a Zoom meeting when he pulled in my driveway, so I waved him inside and wrapped up my call.  We greeted each other with a hug and smiles, but immediately I picked up on…something strange.  I watched him eye me up, then down, then up again - it was very noticeable, and not in a good way.  I saw disappointment in his face, and I knew exactly why.

I’m a size 12, perfectly average, and confident in my looks and body.  Having said that, I understand some men prefer a smaller build, and that’s fine.  Again, I had full body pics on my profile, and we had long video chats where he saw all of me.  He’d complimented me several times throughout the week, saying he thought I was beautiful, etc.  But in person - it was obvious he was surprised, somehow.  Also, he came across surprisingly shy and even awkward, which I didn’t expect.  I felt slightly shook by this in the moment, but brushed it off and moved on.  

I took him on a tour of my property, where his dog met my dogs.  A few minutes later, we left in his car to take a walk at a cove behind my house before sunset.  The plan was to play it by ear after, with no grand plans for the evening…just see where things went.  Once at the beach, the vibe seemed to improve, assisted by a joint he took from his pocket.  We sat on a rock and smoked, laughing and joking that it was a great first date so far - very chill.  I told him about our mutual friend, was open about the background check, etc.  He was fine with it and also said kind things back about our friend.  I let him know what she told me about his politics, and joked that he had flown under the radar - had he missed that part of my bio?  He said no, but that he hoped it ultimately wouldn’t matter.  I assured him it did, but I wasn’t going to stress about it for now.

On the walk back, I offered to take the dog’s leash, when suddenly the dog lunged at something, causing me to fall down on the rocky shore.  I still held the leash, and recovered fine, but he did nothing - didn’t offer to help me up or even ask if I was alright - it was so strange.  Even though we were having fun, at that moment I thought to myself, fuck this.  I was processing the absurdity of his rudeness in one moment, when in the next, I glanced over and realized….he was MISSING A HAND.  His entire hand and forearm.  Nothing below the elbow.  We were wearing jackets, and through our first meeting, hug, the short drive, the joint, the dog walking…I had NEVER noticed.  

I was baked, and for a second thought maybe it was just REALLY good weed.  But no - he was missing a limb and I was just…shocked.  He didn’t notice; I was dying inside in a ridiculously humorous way, and made a decision to say nothing.  We got back to my place and watched the dogs play, and the conversation continued to flow.  I made us some food and we ended up going through a bottle of wine pretty quickly, and began making out on the sofa.  We were super into it - at this point the missing limb was apparent but I quickly realized it didn’t impact anything essential.   

We got naked, and I was pleased to see and feel everything in good working order despite his age.  That’s when I noticed he had a VERY large Prince Albert piercing, which I had never seen in person before.  He enjoyed my shy reaction, reminding me about his time in the 80’s working at the Gauntlet and began to talk more about his numerous kinks, none of which I shared or desired.  Keeping in the moment, I was down for the experience, and we had a good time.  The following morning, he said his piercing was missing - was it lost in the sheets?  No, it was lost inside ME.  I panicked, almost angry - but was able to retrieve it, questioning my life choices.

In the morning light and a bit hung over, I was ready for him to go.  We showered and had coffee, and that’s when I gently asked about his hand.  I said I was surprised he hadn't mentioned it prior to meeting, and he admitted he thought it would be a barrier for some people.  He explained he’d blown it off with fireworks on accident when he was 17, and somehow this turned into a three hour conversation about all kinds of things.  I was confused at myself, knowing I had no plans to date this person, but somehow still liked him.  I was about to tell him this, and decided to let him down easy by leading with a brief kiss.  

He wasn’t into the kiss at all - noticeable.  I laughed, and said to him, “You are NOT into me…” He smiled and deflected, and I assured him it was ok, but I wanted him to say why.  He replied that he thought I was beautiful, but “you’re just a little outside the weight I’m comfortable with, but I really hope we can still hang out and be friends.”

I had clocked this in an instant when we first met, and found myself sitting there across from a mid-60’s, overweight, never married, pierced dick, balding dude who had straight catfished me with a missing limb… the comedy of it all was hilarious to me.  I decided there wasn’t enough value for me to say anything other than I agreed - we should just be friends and not try to date.  

A few days later, he called and asked if I would drive to his house, as he wanted to have a fire and make me dinner.  I had no plans to even see him again, but found my dumb ass naked on the rug in front of a fire, listening to actual CD’s and puffing weed from this crazy long Gandalf-looking pipe.  No alcohol this time.  Forget dating…we were really just enjoying each other.  HOW did I get here?

He got up to change the music, and I began to move a very large, heavy glass coffee table that we’d repeatedly bumped into while making out on the floor.  His house was full of Baroque antiques, some on the table.  I pictured them crashing down, so I lifted one end of the table carefully to scoot it towards the sofa.  Suddenly he goes, “What are you doing!!?” I said I’m….moving this just a little so we don’t keep bumping into it.  In a shit tone, he literally shouted “You CAN’T DO THAT!  It could tear the rug!”  I was stunned at his tone, and asked if he was being serious.  He doubled down, saying “You ask PERMISSION before you do something like that in someone’s HOME.”  I just stood there, and said, “Really?  Are you really acting like this right now? Of course I’m being careful. - I was trying to be helpful.”  He told me he was “stating his boundaries”, and that I was a poor guest.  WTF.  Nothing had prepared me for this acute change in the mood of the evening, and the way he spoke to me.  I began to gather my things, thinking how I didn’t want to drive an hour back home late at night, and told him I needed a moment.  

We sat in silence on the sofa, and after a few minutes I said, “Look, I want to stay, but the way you just talked to me was SO crappy.  I don’t understand why you blew up like that over me trying to move a table three inches.”  He responded by saying he didn’t need to explain himself, and I could accept that or not.  At that moment, I finally had a full picture of this asshole, and asked him once more if this was the hill he wanted to die on.  He said he was sorry I got upset, but it was my own fault.  Shaking my head, I said adios dude - I’m out of here.

The following day, before I blocked him, he texted the following:  “Maybe next time put pictures of yourself in a bikini on your profile so people will know what they’re getting!”

And that concludes my first and only attempt at OLD, at least for now.

She had the same car as mine so I said Hi and spoke to her a bit and later learned we both share the same love for cars and motorcycles. We went on the group ride and stopped at the end and my dumb was still figuring out a way to her name or instagram. I walk up to her and started rambling about the ride instead of asking her insta or phone number and before I could do that she herself asked for it and i shared it.

I went back home and sent her a message that it was nice meeting her and would like to tag along if she goes out for another spin - she didn't respond for two days and then replied that we'll plan something around new years but she didn't plan anything. I didn't think much as I thought she might be spending time with her family, I later messaged her for a ride up and she agreed to meet the next day. I picked a popular cafe and she said she likes that place too.

I wasn't sure if I should go for a hug or just say Hi but she leaned in for a hug and it was the warmest hug I received in a long time.

At the cafe, she shared a little about her life and work and I did too. I had complemented her taste in car to get a smile and she did. I tried to make some jokes, once or twice maybe not that funny to get a laugh. We have shared interest in motorcycle and hiking - spoke about it for sometime. We did have some silences her and there not sure if that is bad. We chatted for 30 minutes and she said she had to go back to drop off her family to some place so she had to come back in 3 hours. I had planned for a little walk after the ride but instead grabbed food from a grab and go store.

Now before we left she reached for another hug and it was again warm and nice. I messaged her again and she said she had a nice time and even a sent a picture of my car while we went for a ride.

She has a very calming presence and i'm all for it. How do I know if this was like a date and not just a car meet? How do I know if she feels the same? any clues that I should be looking for?

I agree with alot you said. Wasn't expecting that video to make me reflect on myself. We are just viewers with an opinion while you are out doing and building amazing things. Try to keep your head up and consider having someone vet comments for to read. Reading comments online can put you into a bad head space. This can make reaching goals more difficult.  

To touch on the Jesse situation. Glad to hear he is stepping up. You talking about him in your video made Jesse have to take action. Which is healthy. You love your friend want him to succeed. A little inspiration from outside sources (internet) and friends can go a long way. one big thing I've learned going to therapy for over 5 years (I'm a nub) is encouragement can push things much further than negativity. Top that with praise fromttt their growth and improvement and you have a fantastic person to help reach both if your goals. Use this tool to help Jesse help himself.

Also how tf does the heated bed draw smoke and push it out the chimny?? Wouldn't the slope up in the chimney cause resistence, pushing smoke out the entrance instead of UP a pipe? EXPLAINNNNNN!

You two have given me inspiration in my own life to get out of flow. Sleep, work, eat, sleep..... bought a tent and the wife and I have been doing some back yard camping to try it out. Have plans to start visiting state parks soon as weekenders. Who knows. Maybe I'll make a short about it lmfao. 

Will, love you man. Thanks for the inspiration to do something other than the norm. Or ""easy"" as you would say. 

I'll keep saying it. Get a patreon. Start stacking income methods. YouTube membership, Patreon, Buy me a coffee (one time, easy, quick donation method). I want to see what you do with your land!

I currently have bladder cancer. It is painful to do the surgeries and the following BCG treatments. But! Pain, in these situations, is not something you can always do anything about. But misery! Misery is something you can change. The point? I could choose to make my situation worse by wallowing in the fact that I have cancer, being upset, and wailing, ""woe is me!"" But why? The pain will be there regardless of how I feel about it. So why choose to be miserable? In my drinking, I would have loved this shit. I would have soaked in the pain and added painkillers to my regimen. I would have made everyone around miserable and then complained that nobody wanted to be around me. Hey, don't get me wrong, it still sucks to have the cancer, I do get sad and depressed, but I do have a choice in how I manage it today. I am thankful for that...

I have so many things that I'm ashamed of and problems that I don't know how to solve.

I feel stuck and I can't really see a future where things will be better.

I studied electronics in college and I finished second in my class, and while this can be seen as an achievement, I'm not proud of it because I always studied at the very last minute and I didn't get a very profound understanding of any subject that I had.

I have always been a procrastinator. For my graduation thesis, I had hopes of doing it ""right"". I wanted to put in effort and make it the best. I wanted it to be something that I would be proud of in the future, but I also procrastinated here, I didn't give it my all.

I didn't achieve the full functionality that it was supposed to have, only some basic stuff. While I did get a 10 on that thesis, it feels like a lie, like I don't really deserved it. The teachers who graded it knew me to be a ""good"" student and they didn't ask me that many question about it. I am so sad and ashamed about it and I didn't even print a copy for myself.

After college I had an interview at a large software company and they accepted me, but I decided to decline because I was so afraid of making a change. I was supposed to move to a new city and study for my master's there.

Instead, I stayed in my hometown with my parents and I got a bullshit programming job at a no name firm, making minimum wage. There I was bullied by a lot of my colleagues and every day felt like torture. Covid came around after I've been there for 4 months. Then we started working from home and things were more manageable this way, but the bullying still continued.

Again, I was afraid to make a change, to try interviewing somewhere else, and I stayed there for 2 years, making very little money in this time, and most importantly not learning anything useful and not advancing my career.

Around 2021 I think I hit my lowest point, I was so sad and depressed all the time. I was doing bullshit tasks where I wasn't learning anything useful, I was being paid barely above minimum wage, and I was being bullied daily. This is around the time when I finished my master's, and my mom stepped in more and pushed me to interview somewhere else.

I managed to get a job in the biggest city in my country, where I currently work, and I've been here for 4 years. I escaped that hell hole, got a good paying job and moved to a big city, thanks to my mom's support.

Things are better here, my colleagues are ok, and I am satisfied with my salary.

I was able to buy an apartment 2 years ago and I am about 1 year away from paying off the mortgage. This is something I'm proud of, that I can stand on my own feet.

Even though I have learned a lot here at my new job, I still feel like it isn't enough. I'm not particularly passionate about my job and I'm not pushing myself forward, and I think I should be a bit further up in my career than I currently am.

Even though I would like to learn more in my spare time, I just can't seem to do it. Making a plan and sticking to it is something that I need, but I haven't been able to do. I feel so stuck... I want to do things, but in the end what I'm doing most days is to just waste time on my laptop or on my phone. I'm just rotting away.

Moving out of my parent's house (where the atmosphere was tense, especially with my dad, and where we were having fights regularly) and not being bullied at work improved my mental health and gave me some stability. Things are peaceful in my own home.

So I've been in here for 4 years, which is quite a while, but I haven't made a single friend. In the first years here I didn't really go anywhere, I was staying mostly at home, talking only to my work colleagues on the daily call (I work from home here too). I know the most common advice in this situation - go out and do something, some group activity, and you'll meet people there. Well, I'm scared as hell to do that.

I have always been the shy, anxious and quiet one. I was quite severely bullied throughout middle school, which I think contributed the most towards my low self esteem.

I had friends in the past and I liked spending time with them, but after college we haven't spoken to each other and we drifted apart. They're also not living in my city. This means I'm completely alone... and I've been like this for a long time.

I also never had a girlfriend, never even kissed a girl, and this is the thing which I'm most ashamed of, and which pains me the most. Being 30 and never having done things which most people start experiencing in their teenage years.

There have been girls who liked me in the past, when I was in high school and college, but either I didn't like them, or I was worried/ashamed that my friends and acquaintances would judge/mock me if I were to be together with one of them because they weren't ""pretty enough"", even though I liked them. And where that wasn't the case, I was simply afraid or making a step forward.

So I went through my 20s mostly alone and without love. I don't know how to describe the pain that I'm feeling when I think about this. There's so much regret.. It feels like I have a void inside me where everything is mixed together and I feel nothing but pain and despair. I feel worthless, unlovable, unfixable.

I have to say that I don't consider myself to be an incel. I don't hate women, and of course, I don't think they're responsible for my current situation. Why would they be? I'm also not into that manosphere Andrew Tate stuff. I think it's toxic, and in fact Tate is a convicted criminal.

I am trying to meet someone through dating apps. At first I was amazed that I got some likes. I thought I wouldn't get any because... why would anyone like me? I wouldn't say I'm good looking, but not very bad either. Anyway, most of the conversations die off after a few replies.

I'm not sending them any inappropriate messages, I'm just trying to have a conversation and eventually invite her to a coffee date. A problem is that I'm not that good at conversations, I don't really know what to say most of the time, and I'm not funny either.

I'm looking through their profile and I'm trying to come up with topics/questions based on what their interests are. I'm mostly getting back short answers, which shows a lack of interest, meaning that maybe they didn't like the topic I brought up, or maybe they changed their mind and actually they don't really want to talk to me... I don't really know. There could be a million reasons.

But there are a few who go in more detail with their answers sometimes.

This is really stressful for me and I think my lack of conversation skills is a big problem. I can ask questions, but if you asked me what I did last week, I wouldn't really know what to tell you. There isn't much going on in my life. I'm not going out and meeting with people, and doing stuff together.

I do have a few hobbies, if you could call them that. I enjoy running, I have quite a few plants that I like to take care of, and I play the guitar sometimes (less than I would like to). There isn't much that I could say about these things.

I just feel like I don't have much to give the other person.

And if somehow I'll find someone who likes me, I don't know who would accept me, knowing my past. Isn't that a huge red flag?

So, I've been self-isolating for the past couple of years, starting with covid, but around 2 years ago I started get out of the house regularly, either to visit a museum, go shopping, or to just go for a walk. Sometimes I try to do this every day.

I also found some courage and went on a few solo trips. I think I missed out by not doing this earlier because I didn't have someone to go with.

Also, just to get out of the house and do something, I sometimes go to restaurants by myself. All in all, I think these things help me remain sane, but making friends and/or finding a girlfriend is still a huge scary thing.

I just wanted to share with someone the things that pain me and that I struggle with the most. I wrote this when I felt very low, so some things might be overly accentuated. I do feel like that, but not constantly.

I'd like to ask you - what do you think about what I wrote and what would you do in my situation? How can I stop being stuck and actually do the things that I know will help me, and how can I get over my fear of talking to people?

Criticism is welcome.

I felt scared, hurt, and didn’t have anyone to talk to so I told my best friends. Fiancée is now unbelievably angry and feels betrayed. 

I ( 37F ) have been with my fiancée ( 38M ) for almost 7 years. This last year has been the hardest year of his life. He lost his mother, and that brought on very intense but normal grief symptoms. Anger, depression, lack of motivation, etc.. 

I have tried to just be there and be encouraging and supportive. Letting him go through the emotions as they come. Trying to just remain steady and normal. Keeping the house clean, making sure we have groceries and food, giving him back scratches.. stuff like that. 

Random side note that is relevant. We were gifted a really nice automatic coffee machine about 2 months ago. A used “Jura.” I had never heard of one, but essentially it’s a fancy automatic coffee machine. We install the Jura and my fiancée LOVES this thing. It does make really good coffee. 

Okay, so now we’re in present day. It’s been about 6 months since his mother passed. He seems to be doing better. Improved mood, his motivation is back, and things are going well. Then the “incident” happened. Last week, the Jura stopped working ( for the second time mind you ) and it essentially made fiancées grief/anger come flooding back with a vengeance. 

While in a rage, he broke the Jura on accident. He was hyper fixated on trying to fix it, while angry and not caffeinated, and the Jura broke. The thing is in multiple pieces now. 

What followed was him so upset and depressed, he said to me “I might as well kill myself”. I didn’t know what to say except tell him I love him and that it will be okay. But when he’s in that state of anger I find it’s best to just separate myself from the situation and give him space. Trying to calm him down or comfort him doesn’t help. 

So the following day I told my closest friend what happened. I truly needed to talk about it, get some advice, and just get it off my chest. I wasn’t trying to “make him look bad.” I just needed someone to talk to. 

Fast forward a few days and he’s in a better headspace. I tell another friend a very shortened version ( omitting the sucicide details ) and she just said she was so glad he was feeling better and proceeded to tell me about the time she beat the crap out of a simple human trash can. We were just friends catching up on each other’s lives and again, I wasn’t trying to make him look bad or paint him in a bad light. 

So last night he asks me who knows about the incident and I tell him honestly and he immediately gets angry. My knee jerk response was to say “you tell your friends when things happen with me.” That upset him even more because he feels like that was me saying I was trying to “get even” with him. 

That is not true at all, I literally just meant, when big shit happens in a relationship, it’s normal to talk to your friends about it. 

He is genuinely disgusted with me right now. He was screaming at me last night. He just kept saying “that’s not what best friends do” .. meaning him and I are best friends and you don’t tell people about your best friends darkest moments. 

I feel terrible he’s hurt so bad but also don’t feel like I did anything wrong. So, AITAH? ",2,1768406884.0,AITAH,6,1.0,False

I had an appointment today with a specialist orthodontist. He states that invisalign or ceramic braces would provide similar end results and in terms of what is achievable, both are very similar.

I am a 41 year old male, and I am less interested in invisalign due to the hassle of continual removal, avoiding eating, drinking hot drinks etc. I think I'd just rather get braces installed and forget about them (as much as is possible!).

**Questions**

1. I enjoy red wine occasionally and unsure how much this would stain the teeth. The Dentist advised drinking water after or brushing teeth but honestly, I am less likely to do that, particualrly if I am drinking more than one glass.
2. Same question about coffee really. I love black coffee and concerned about staining. Some recommend using a straw, but just wondering what you do?
3. Do the ceramic braces make your lips or mouth bulge out due to the bulkiness of them? Or is it fairly discreet.
4. Those that had ceramic braces, did you opt for a metal or ceramic-coated wire across the top teeth? I know it can chip but I looked at some in the surgery and it didn't even look that noticable.
5. Have you had any issues with food and drink? I saw something that even warned against eating crunchy apples

After months of building, I finally launched Bloka today on Product Hunt and would love your support 🙏

What is Bloka?

It’s an iOS app that helps you stay focused by combining AI object recognition with NFC technology. Place an object (like your AirPods case or a coffee mug) in front of your camera to start a focus session, and Bloka blocks distracting apps until you’re done.

Why I built this:

As someone with ADHD juggling college and running a startup, I was constantly breaking my own focus sessions in other apps. Bloka makes it physically harder to quit - you need to show that same object again to end the session. No more “I’ll just check Instagram real quick.”

Key features:

\- AI-powered object recognition for session control

\- NFC tag support as an alternative

\- Customizable app blocking via Apple’s Screen Time API

\- Streak tracking and milestone rewards

\- Clean, minimal interface

Would really appreciate your upvote and feedback! 🚀

That’s the number of times the light above my hospital bed has flickered in the past hour. I had to find something to do while I waited for someone to find my phone in my car. The occasional doctor stopping by to check on me wasn’t enough to fill the void. They finally found it and brought it to me a little bit after 12 as some of the staff left for the night, so now I turn my short attention span to it instead. And while I have it, I wanna tell you guys about what happened, and what caused me to be laying in a hospital bed.

When I finished college a few years back I immediately started job searching. A heads up, when a place says they hiring, they usually aren’t. That’s what I went through for a good month and a half before I kinda just gave up. Then my friend suggested I could start doing Uber driving. I wasn’t too keen on the idea, driving a stranger from point A to B is just a sure fire way for something to happen. He kept reassuring me that they have all these safety measures for the driver and after looking into it, he wasn’t lying.

It took some convincing but I begrudgingly downloaded the app and started to Uber for people. It was a quick way to get some money while I continued to look for a job. The first few trips were odd, I had never done something like it before and my passengers didn’t help the awkward atmosphere that had been created because of that factor. After a few weeks, I slowly got more in touch with the stereotypical friendly Uber driver. I got so good I had gotten 5 stars in the first 5 months, which then went to 4.5 cause some lady didn’t understand why she couldn’t bring an open coffee in my car. 

I did this for about 2 years. When I finally did find a job I only ever did it when I needed some extra cash, always making sure to turn off my availability when I wasn't doing it. I had a pretty good routine going until yesterday, which is where my story starts to get strange.

I had taken a trip up north to Vermont for a few days in late fall, I had always wanted to see the leaves up there and so I decided to bite the bullet and go. It was the night I was leaving to head back down when I got a notification on my phone.

\*Selected to drive for nearby passenger\*

I kinda just stared at it dumbfounded as I had never seen that before. The way it works is that the app will tell me if I’m in the area of a nearby person and I can go pick them up. The only problem with that is I had turned my availability off. I shouldn’t have even been an option to pop up. 

I tried calling customer service and kept getting put on hold, all while my phone kept reminding me that I had a passenger waiting to get picked up. I sat in my car and thought for a bit. 

“I mean, it wouldn’t be that hard to do it right?”

Sure it was weird that it choose me but all apps have some bugs. And it’s not like I could just leave this person hanging, my rating would go down. I eventually opened the app and confirmed I was on my way, driving down the dark back woods of Vermont to finally meet my passenger.

I pulled up to an old church parking lot as my phone notification went off, letting me know I was near my passenger. The headlights illuminated the darkness in front as small thin raindrops started to appear in they beams. I kinda just stared forward watching them fall as a knock on my window nearly made jump from my skin. I turned to see a man standing at my passenger door.

“Uber for…” I looked at the phone to confirm the name before he interrupted. “Um, your back seats are full.” I turned around and realized that I never even checked to see if I could drive someone. My car was filled in the back due to my trip, I just cursed myself and looked back at the guy.

“Oh shit. I’m sorry man I never even thought of that. Um… I can see if I can reconnect you with another driver if you want?” He scanned the car and pointed to the passenger seat. “What about up front? It’s clear there.” 

I looked up front and agreed in my head. The front is clear, but it’s not really normal for the driver to sit right next to the passenger. It’s kinda like a safety thing just in case something happens. I tried to politely brush it off “Yeah but I’m not really-“ before I could finish he cut me off “It’s fine with me, I don’t mind.”

I bit my lip as I contemplated. Slowly agreeing and saying sure, I mean he was the one to suggest it. He opened the door and slid into the seat. His slightly wet clothes mixed with the air of the heater as the windows started to fog up a bit. “Sorry, old car.” I chuckled a little as I put the car in drive.

I switched the heater to defogger as the windows slowly regained their transparency. I checked my phone, confirmed I got him and started to make my way to his destination. Following the directions on the device.

I tried to lighten the awkwardness with some small talk, like all good Ubers do. “So, what brings you all the way out here this late?” He stared out the window before answering ”I was just out. Didn’t realize it was getting so late and I didn’t wanna try to walk back in this dark.”

“Oh I get it. I wouldn’t either, or more likely I’m not sure I could. I'm not from around here.” He turned to me and chuckled, “I'm not either, I was just visiting for work.” I nodded my head in some form of politeness “Oh that’s good, yeah I was up here for a needed vacation. Always wanted to see these leaves.” He offered me the same nod back “Very nice, this time of year is beautiful.” He added as I agreed with him.

The conversation kinda died out there as I focused a bit more on the road. The rain had started to come down in more thicker drops and with it being night I was barely in a state to start up a lot of conversations when he started to talk again. “So, you’re from Boston? Nice town but I’m more of a Salem guy.”

“Yeah it’s not so-“ I paused as I turned slightly to look at him confused “Wait…how did you-”

“Earlier you had mentioned it. While the falls can get nice down there you can’t beat this.”

“Oh… Yeah no you’re right. And yeah the falls in Boston are no match for this one. I’m pretty sure Iv seen some colors on these leaves I didn’t know existed.” He chuckled a bit before it went quiet again. 

A few more minutes had passed before I noticed I had been driving for about an hour. In my entire time doing this, I had never had a drive that long. “Hey man, you know this drive is gonna be a pricey one right?” He shook his head in understanding. “Oh yeah don’t worry, I’m not too concerned with that.”

“Alright just making sure. Don’t want us to stop and you think somehow you got over charged.” He chuckled a bit. “Yeah don’t worry, I know you’re a trustworthy guy. I mean, you did get that promotion because of it.”

I didn’t answer him. My body kinda felt hot after his statement, like something was very wrong.

He broke my silence with a quick response.“You mentioned you had gotten a promotion at your job. I was talking about my work and you mentioned it.”

“I-I did?” Had I mentioned it? It was late and I was tired from my trip. Maybe I did mention and my brain just kinda zoned it out, saving energy to make sure I didn’t crash into a tree. 

“Hey man don’t worry, I forget stuff a lot of times too. It’s normal.” He said, almost like he was reassuring me that everything was ok. “Heh, guess you’re right. Sorry I must be sleepy.” He nodded silently. “No problem. I’ll keep quiet for a bit to let you focus.” 

His helping silence just made the ride feel more awkward and made me focus less. I kept my eyes on the road, only occasionally checking the phone to make sure I was on the right road.

It was my last check that something caught my eye. It was the destination. I waited till I got on a straight way before I scrolled to see the full name of the destination. I stared at the phone as I could feel my spine freeze in place from dread. It was my address. The destination that this man had picked was my address. 

I tried to stay calm as I just scrolled up and went back to driving, looking to see if he noticed my sudden change in mood. He didn’t, he was just looking out the window at the now visible streetlights as the surroundings slowly went from quiet town to busy street. I just kept driving as my mind went though what was happening.

How did he get my address? How did he know I was up here? Why did the app mess up? Then more alarming things started to pop up. I didn’t tell him I was from Boston. I didn’t tell him I got a promotion at my work, hell I never told him I even worked somewhere. Then my eyes slowly started to widen as I thought of the worst thing that could have happened. Did I even confirm if he was the right guy? Was this just a random person I had picked up? I slowly licked my lips as I started to talk again, dreading to ask him this. “H-Hey, um by the way, did I ask your name?”

“Hm? Oh yeah, no. No you never did. Kinda weird right?” I just stared at the road as my body started to shiver with fear. I thought I was going to die of a heart attack as I felt his hand grab my shoulder. I turned to face him as he grinned at me. “Thanks for the ride though.”

My phone loudly chimed in.

\*YOU HAVE REACHED YOUR DESTINATION\*

I turned to look at the phone just as my windshield was filled with blinding light. My vision immediately interrupted by the airbag as I heard my cars front crush with the force of a thousand pounds. It flipped, rolled, slid and finally stopped as it hit the guard rail. I could feel the blood dripping from my head and arms as I turned to look at the passenger seat, sure to see the body of that man there. It was empty. My already labored breathing getting heavier as I could hear people rushing over and screaming to call 911.

And that’s where we are now, as I continue to sit in this hospital. The doctors said I only had a few minor breaks and sprains and that I was luck to be alive, although there was no concussion, which they found weird because of what I was saying. No one believed me as I rambled that there was a guy in the car with me, even the police looked at me like I was crazy. And maybe they’re right. Maybe I did imagine a strange man that somehow knew what city I lived in. That knew things about my job. That knew my address. These are things I would be agreeing with if I didn’t see the notification I just got on my phone as I type this, my fingers shaking as I do. It reads…

A questi andrebbero aggiunti i cicloturisti, che spesso viaggiano in gruppo e hanno esigenze particolari rispetto a pendolari e ciclisti per svago.](https://preview.redd.it/q49k561xtmue1.png?width=1024&format=png&auto=webp&s=e3ea2a4bb09a7f2fa26f17aa7b0d225b4823da0f)



# Quando si parla di ciclisti spesso molti fanno un calderone di ‘ciclisti 100% indisciplinati’ alimentando uno sciocco pregiudizio secondo cui chi va in bicicletta è un anarchico senza patente ([non è vero](https://benzinazero.wordpress.com/2018/10/11/i-ciclisti-guidano-meglio-lauto-e-hanno-meno-incidenti-degli-automobilisti-che-non-vanno-in-bici-accident-analysis-prevention-study/)) mentre l’automobilista è un disciplinato cultore della legge (e anche questo non è vero).

Entrambe le categorie commettono numerose infrazioni, con la differenza che chi guida un suv da 2,5 tonnellate ma anche un'utilitaria da una tonnellata è molto più pericoloso della stessa identica persona quando va in bicicletta. [Un’auto che a 50 km/h investe un pedone ha un impatto pari a circa cento ciclisti che vanno a 20 km/h](https://benzinazero.wordpress.com/2019/09/10/essere-investiti-da-unauto-a-50-km-h-e-come-essere-investiti-da-tutto-il-plotone-del-giro-ditalia/).

Il punto importante è che ci sono molte categorie di ciclisti, illustrate nell’immagine sopra, e cioè:

1. **Ciclista quotidiano.** È il ciclista, uomo o donna, che usa tutti i giorni la bici per andare al lavoro, a scuola e per fare commissioni familiari. Si va dall’impiegato che lavora dalle 9 alle 18 [all’agente di commercio](https://benzinazero.wordpress.com/2018/09/18/lagente-di-commercio-che-fa-50-km-ogni-giorno-in-bicicletta-elettrica/) che visita numerosi clienti tutti i giorni, dallo studente all’insegnante.
2. **Ciclista sportivo.** È il ciclista che usa la bicicletta per allenamento sportivo, professionale, semiprofessionale o amatoriale, ma anche per esplorare i dintorni della sua città, facendo spesso centinaia di km alla settimana. Di questa categoria fanno parte anche i paraciclisti che si allenano con biciclette speciali. Il codice della strada italiano è particolarmente impietoso nei suoi confronti, con una normativa particolarmente confusa sia a proposito dei [gruppi](https://benzinazero.wordpress.com/2017/04/08/codice-della-strada-lart-182-comma-1-e-contraddittorio-pericoloso-scritto-male/), sia a proposito delle [piste ciclabli](https://benzinazero.wordpress.com/2016/11/29/quiz-i-ciclisti-sono-sempre-obbligati-ad-usare-le-piste-ciclabili-e-ciclopedonali/).
3. **Ciclista del tempo libero.** Chi usa la bici per fare un giro, per andare al caffè, uscire la sera o passare un pomeriggio festivo, tanto nella propria città quanto in vacanza
4. **Ciclista attento.** È il ciclista che vuole circolare in sicurezza, desidera seguire le regole del codice (che però in italia sono spesso [confuse](https://benzinazero.wordpress.com/2017/04/08/codice-della-strada-lart-182-comma-1-e-contraddittorio-pericoloso-scritto-male/), contraddittorie e [controproducenti](https://benzinazero.wordpress.com/2017/12/20/perche-la-norma-dei-gilet-riflettenti-per-ciclisti-e-assurda-e-vessatoria/)) e ha bisogno di segnaletica chiara e intersezioni sicure. È il ciclista che più facilmente rinuncia alla bicicletta se pensa di essere in una situazione di pericolo. Spesso [le donne preferiscono non usare la bicicletta](https://benzinazero.wordpress.com/2019/12/30/come-sarebbe-una-citta-progettata-dalle-donne-bbc-video/) se pensano che gli automobilisti siano troppo pericolosi e aggressivi. Molti italiani vorrebbero usare la bicicletta per lavoro o per commissioni, ma non lo fa perché ha paura del traffico.
5. **Ciclista vulnerabile.** Si tratta principalmente di bambini, [disabili](https://benzinazero.wordpress.com/2018/04/27/ma-e-gli-anziani-e-i-disabili-come-fanno-ad-andare-in-bicicletta/) con bici a due o tre ruote, e [anziani](https://benzinazero.wordpress.com/2018/09/07/perche-tutti-tutelano-gli-anziani-costretti-a-usare-lauto-per-andare-in-farmacia-o-in-parrocchia-ma-nessuno-tutela-gli-anziani-in-bicicletta/), sempre con bici a due o tre ruote. Hanno bisogno di percorsi particolarmente sicuri, e particolare rispetto da parte degli utenti motorizzati.
6. **Corrieri in bici.** Sono persone che lavorano in bici per fare consegne o per trasportare la propria attrezzatura: corrieri, fattorini, postini, [artigiani](https://benzinazero.wordpress.com/2018/06/19/si-puo-fare-lidraulico-in-bicicletta-e-senza-furgone-a-roma-si/), [tuttofare](https://benzinazero.wordpress.com/2019/02/19/alessandria-il-caso-dellartigiano-aggiustatutto-con-la-cargo-bike-che-lavora-e-vive-meglio-senza-furgone/) in bicicletta. Da notare che, mentre i corrieri con furgone quando parcheggiano sui marciapiedi, in doppia fila o sulle piste ciclabili sono sempre giustificati con ‘solo cinque minuti, sto lavorando’, i corrieri in bici vengono spesso etichettati come delinquenti che non rispettano il codice della strada. Come mai questo doppio standard?
7. **I** **cicloturisti**. Categoria non prevista nell’illustrazione sopra, sta diventando sempre più importante in Europa anche per [il giro d’affari che comincia a muovere](https://benzinazero.wordpress.com/2014/01/12/miliardi-di-euro-per-il-cicloturismo-in-europa-e-in-italia/). I cicloturisti viaggiano spesso in gruppo, hanno spesso bisogno di usare anche il treno, e hanno bisogno di servizi e assistenza lungo la strada. Fortunatamente molti alberghi si stanno attrezzando per servire al meglio questo tipo di clientela che, in proporzione, spende di più e pesa di meno sul territorio rispetto agli ingombranti turisti in automobile. [I cicloturisti si suddividono a loro volta in almeno tre categorie](https://benzinazero.wordpress.com/2021/04/11/ci-sono-3-tipi-di-cicloturisti-e-molti-albergatori-non-lo-sanno-perdendo-clienti/).

È evidente che queste sette categorie di ciclisti hanno caratteristiche particolari e hanno bisogno di una attenzione specifica da parte delle amministrazioni pubbliche, delle aziende, delle scuole e anche un’attenzione particolare da parte di chi guida mezzi motore. [I ciclisti, per il codice della strada, sono utenti vulnerabili, come pedoni e disabili](https://benzinazero.wordpress.com/2017/06/26/la-bici-e-un-veicolo-ma-il-ciclista-e-un-utente-debole-come-pedoni-e-disabili/).

È altrettanto evidente che è del tutto inutile e anche stupido dipingere sempre i ciclisti come anarchici che non rispettano il codice della strada. Nessuna delle categorie di utenti della strada rispetta tutte le norme: gli automobilisti fanno le loro infrazioni, i motociclisti le loro infrazioni, i pedoni le loro infrazioni e i ciclisti le loro infrazioni. Non è con l’invito astratto a rispettare il codice della strada che si riducono gli incidenti, ma riprogettando le strade, realizzando più piste ciclabili e potenziando i mezzi pubblici.

È invece utile progettare strade sicure anche per queste categorie di ciclisti, che pesano meno su ambiente e territorio ma portano più benessere e una mobilità migliore.

Quando una città è progettata per bambini, pedoni, ciclisti è meglio per tutti, compresi gli automobilisti. Quando una città è progettata prioritariamente per l’automobile, con autostrade urbane e parcheggi dappertutto, è peggio per tutti, compresi gli automobilisti.

I (28F) live in the suburbs and I have been on a mission to swap name brands for generics wherever I can. Paper towels? Fine. Cereal? Fine. Shampoo? Questionable but survivable. So when our usual detergent ran out, I grabbed a giant jug of a store brand that had a label screaming things like ""ultra clean"" and ""fresh breeze"" and cost way less. I felt smug.

  
This morning I decided to be extra productive and do laundry before errands. My husband (30M) had work clothes in the hamper, I had a load of light sweaters, and there were some random towels. Normally I separate, but the whole point of simplifying my life is not turning laundry into a spreadsheet. The new detergent was also a different color than our usual one, kind of a bright blue gel. I figured that was just marketing.

  
I poured in what I thought was a normal amount, hit start, and went to make coffee. About ten minutes later, I walked back through the laundry room and saw blue suds creeping out from under the washer like a low budget horror movie. I opened the lid and got hit with the sight of my beige sweater turning the exact shade of a swimming pool.

  
I had accidentally used the detergent meant for dark clothes that ""refreshes color"". It was not refreshing the color. It was donating new color.

  
Now my husband (30M) has pale blue undershirts, my towels look tie-dyed, and my favorite neutral sweater is officially an ocean-themed statement piece. I spent the rest of the day re-washing everything, scrubbing the washer, and trying not to cry while staring at the money I saved versus the clothes I may have ruined.

Why did he get mad at what I said when he done the same thing but he actually did it and I didn’t even go out with anyone else?,I 39f and boyfriend/ex 36 have been on a break but really not i spent the weekend with him then he asked me back over on Monday night so I went and worked from his house tuesday. I am not talking to anyone else nor am I on and other sites. he however is on a site that I am aware of and knew he had talked to someone Sunday. so when I get to his Monday he is spraying stuff on the bed and their is a wine bottle beside the bed I asked why the wine was in the bedroom he said bc he had been drinking the night before and had sprayed the bed bc he had really bad gas. we watch some tv together then I go into the bedroom and workout do my devotional and go to bed. next morning everything is fine I make him breakfast and coffee and get him off to work he calls while working and we are fine then he ask me to stay again but I said I had a few things at home I needed to get done he got mad and thats where I goes down hill. we get into over something he accuses me of having someone else which I say I don’t bc I legit don’t. but as the convo to he tells me he can get someone that night and I say I could have to I had 2exs text me but I blocked them he says how did they text you if they was blocked I said bc they had been deleted first then when they texted and I found out it was them I blocked them. he then accused me of hoeing around and demanded that I get the rest of my stuff out of his house so I gather everything up and try to leave before he got off but he wanted me to wait he went through everything to make sure I hadn’t taken anything of his. our first Christmas he bought me a certain stuff animal that I would sleep with when I was there and I bought him the girl one matched mine. so we have had these for about 2 years now. I tried to take mine and he wouldn’t let me said he was going to put them in his safe. but why would he want to keep something that was so personal to me? he told me he hated me and never wanted me back at his house. then later when I got home he called to see what I had of his at my house and then he told me he just needed sometime. so I’m so confused. help me out why did he keep my stuff animal and what’s his deal why get made at me for telling him the truth about the exs that I did block when he is clearly talking to other people? it’s like it’s okay he does it but not me.,1,1768406017.0,BreakUps,0,1.0,False

I’ve been following this sub for a while and I see the same story every week: someone is desperate for housing or asking if a ""too good to be true"" Facebook ad is a scam (Spoiler: It usually is! 🚩).

I’ve been there. I almost sent money for a room in Limpertsberg that didn't even exist. That frustration made me realize that traditional portals are too cold and Facebook groups are a minefield of fake profiles.

So, I decided to launch **Roomie-Radar.com**. 💻

My goal isn’t to compete with the real estate giants, but to create a space where **verification** comes first. I wanted a site where you could see who you’ll be sharing your morning coffee with and have the peace of mind that the profile has been checked. 🏡✨

I’ve focused on Luxembourg because it’s where I live and where I know the struggle is real.

**I’d love to get your thoughts:**

1. What’s your biggest ""horror story"" while looking for a room in Lux? 😱
2. What filters do you wish housing websites had? (e.g., cleaning schedules, WFH friendly, pet lovers...) 🐾

The platform is free for individual users—I just want the community to grow so we all have safer options.

1qcqrux,https://i.redd.it/x5ks97c55cdg1.jpeg,Men's walk this Sunday in Hyde Park at 11am,"Hello lovely people of Reddit,

Wanted to share details of our free Shoulder to Shoulder mens community walk and coffee event in Hyde Park this Sunday at 11am. These happen every fortnight and the last one we had a record turn-out with 75 guys. The whole r/london community has been super supportive in helping us grow this.  

🕦  Please try and arrive promptly for 11am, we normally set off at 11.20 latest

📍 The meet point is the statue of Achilles (nearest tube, Hyde Park Corner). Please grab a coffee from the lodge cafe or even bring your own if you fancy one, and make your way to the meet point :) 

🙏🏻 Tom and Dan, the founders, will do a little intro, and then we divide into smaller circles led by some of our amazing leadership group. In these groups we all intro ourselves and say why we’re there and then share something (like a challenge or a pain point) we’d like to discuss on the walk - this is helpful because it means people can find common ground very easily.

🥾 We’ll grab our quick traditional photo, and then we’ll do our normal route around the park, and at halfway we’ll take a pause for a little reshuffle. This means you can connect with some different people if you’d like too 

👊🏻 We’ll finish back where we started (normally around 13:00) at which point we'll close. 

🔆It’s looking like dry weather but this is the UK so bring something waterproof or a brolly. 

A final note from me, if you’re on the fence about coming for the first time, and the thought of a big group of guys is intimidating, we fully understand. 

It can be nerve wracking showing up. 

What I’ll say is, we structure the group so that everyone gets a chance to connect more intimately with different guys, and we’re SO proud of how welcoming every member of our community is. 

We can make you a promise that whatever you’re feeling before you show up, you won’t be feeling when we finish. It can be a transformational experience for a lot of the guys.

1qcqra0,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1qcqra0,"L'Osier, Tokyo, Jan 2026 ***","So after lurking (and eating!) this sub for many years I finally decided to perhaps make a post. This lunch was planned on the basis of continuing the high after a wild weekend in Toyohashi for an annual personal matter. Just about all of it was perfect. There are 9999 L'Effervescence posts here and my previous to such was January 2025. If that was intellectual, then this is indulgent, the devil to the angel. 

I will freely admit the ¥55k truffle menu was not my first choice as I wanted the Belles Gourmands, but my dining companion insisted after a waiter left a  rather large truffle at the table as bait. We also went with a glass of 2008 Delamotte and the mid tier (¥30k) pairing which included a white Beaucastel CdP, Brane-Cantenac Bordeaux and Clos Vougeot Musigni, and a spoon of Eszencia. With any good pairing, there was a harmony rather than the drink or food dominating, and while I won't get into detailed notes, they all worked. There were also some absolutely crazy wines by the glass but my wallet can only withstand so many assaults after the weekend. Maybe next time. Explanations were given in japanese since my companion and I were yapping in japanese to them, so some may have flown over my head due to my actually limited japanese ability and I didn't have the heart to request english (even if it's a 3 star, I felt guilty). I will go by my observations to supplement the descriptions. 

To begin, a tuille of pumpkin with a citrus hint (I swear that leaf mould is everywhere), a bite of beetroot, parsnip-like thing and chorizo, and a truffle and cheese sable. There's not much to say other than they were very petite and impressive in how much they could jam in such a small thing.
Next we were offered choices of bread including a fresh baked sourdough, butter bread, baguette, olive bread, etc. It was fine. It's bread and I prefer big baguettes in slices. But the olive oil was as good as the wanky text on its coaster. 

The first course was baked Nagasaki egg with truffle, sauce violine and mushroom etc with a biscuit of jamon and truffle. I skipped breakfast and as my ""breakfast"" this perversion of eggs and toast was transcendentally good. The sauce with its savoury ring of sauce and truffle friendly contents. Sweet, salty, umami, delicious, 11/10. 

Next was crab two ways with items such as straight crab, a truffle dome of crab in crab(?) sauce, nanohana puree and dabs of a citrusy gel and crab jelly. The truffle chopped to look like nori was a cute touch. If there was a low dish, this was it. The crab tasted clean, worked with the truffle and was generally pleasant, but it didn't really move me the way the egg did. The plate design was also just weird and arguably uncharacteristic of such a place. I get they wanted to break the monotony of white plates but this was ugly. The curious CdP had notes of nashi, pear, golden apples and caramel. 

The final savoury course was beef with vegetable medley cooked in butter. Beef and vegetables done perfectly and made better with truffle. They left the saucepan of sauce perigueux which was much appreciated (though rushing over to apply it when I reached for it!). The double pairing worked such that the burgundy responded to the truffle, while the bordeaux did the beef. 

Before dessert was cheeses. I forgot which was which but perhaps the images help. One was from hokkaido. They served the spoon of Eszencia from here which I slowly sipped to the very end (liquid sunshine). Cheese is cheese.

What's iinteresting is that effectively half the courses are dessert. I love dessert so this is fine. First is a medley of tropical fruit with coconut ice cream and guava sorbet. Normally I'd reach for the Sauternes here but the Eszencia's power shone through. I'm not sure what the truffle really does here outside of working with the coconut component, and the dish is great without it. 

Petit fours of coconut and white chocolat, pistache, meringue with peach and apple, and tonka bean and kumquat(?). These are tiny but I really appreciate what a pastry chef can do. 

The second dessert is coffee with more truffle, amaretto jelly, mascarpone sorbet and foams. This responded better to the truffle than the fruit dish. Not much else to say. It's a nice dessert.
Finally, the sweets trolley. Top 3 best caneles I've had. The other 2 were Tetsuya's (rip) and my boyfriend's. 

I've been wanting to dine here for a long time and I'm glad I finally got there. It feels like the classical image of fine dining and I left full and satisfied. The usage of truffle was just right besides with the fruit. What has me curious is how they manage their mise en place. The booking gave the option to select a course or go seat only, which I went for. They let us choose a course at the table and somehow the dishes were all delivered in a timely manner. The chef Olivier Chaignon also paid every table a visit and the staff were absolutely charming. I must however come back more prepared for wine such as the La Tâche by the glass...",11,1768405790.0,finedining,0,0.87,False

No windows. No way to tell if it was day or night outside, not that it mattered in a place like this. The air tasted like stale cigarettes and burning circuits, that particular flavor of obsession that comes when people forget to eat but never to smoke. Cartons of cigarettes scattered across every available surface like some kind of nicotine shrine. Not a scrap of blood in sight, because blood was for people who still remembered their bodies had needs beyond nicotine and vengeance.

He stood there in that inkblot mask, fedora casting shadows that had no buisness existing under fluorescent light. Rorschach's bastard cousin, all trenchcoat and righteous tension. The kind of man who wore his convictions like armor and his paranoia like a second skin. His gloved hands gripped the edge of a console, knuckles tight enough to make the leather creak. Every line of his body screamed that he was wound too tight, a spring compressed past its breaking point and still holding.

Next to him, she was something else entirely. Nineteen years old and drowning in a nightgown soaked through with blood that probably wasn't hers. Couldn't be hers, not with how she stood there calm as Sunday morning. Her skin was white, the kind of white that made you think of things that never saw sunlight, almost luminescent in the glow of ten thousand LED screens. Platinum blonde hair fell around her shoulders like spilled moonlight. She didn't look real. Maybe she wasn't. Maybe nothing in this room was real except the cigarette smoke and the hatred burning through fiber optic cables.

The screens told their own stories. New York City spread out in a thousand fractured perspectives, a digital god's eye view of everything wrong with the world. Street corners where deals went down in the spaces between streetlights. Storefronts that were fronts for something else, always something else. Storage facilities that stored things you didn't ask about if you valued your continued existence. Some screens moved, showing the world through the eyes of surveillance drones that circled the city like technological vultures, patient and hungry and tireless.

Radio equipment crackled with intercepted chatter, voices discussing things that would never make it to official reports. Facial recognition software traced faces through crowds, algorithims churning through data like hungry machines looking for patterns in the chaos. Numbers scrolled across monitors, calculations that would take a normal person years displayed in microseconds. This was information warfare, and they were sitting in the war room.

He didn't want to leave. You could see it in the way he kept looking at the screens, then at her, then back again. The kind of tension that comes from knowing you're walking away from the control panel right when everything's about to go sideways. When you're trusting someone else to hold the line while you go get your hands dirty somewhere else.

*""I need to take Mint,""* he said, voice muffled behind that mask, turned into something less than human by the fabric. *""Meet with Lizzie and the others. The ritual won't start itself.""*

She barely glanced at him, fingers dancing across keyboards with the kind of fluency that came from living your life in digital space. Her movements were precise, economical, each keystroke deliberate. Blood from her nightgown had dried in dark patches, but the keys remained clean.

*""I've got this, big bro.""* Her voice was soft, gentle. A strange contrast to the blood and the screens and the weight of what they were doing. *""Every camera locked on the Dragon and his little entourage of nightmares. The warghouls, the human assets, their contacts in law enforcement who think they're still on the right side.""*

She pulled up a screen, fingers flying. Images flashed past, surveillance footage of things that moved wrong, that bent physics in ways that made your eyes hurt. Creatures that wore human skin like ill-fitting suits. Men in uniforms who'd sold their badges to something older than the city itself.

*""Alfred can help if things get complicated,""* she added, almost as an afterthought. Like it was nothing. Like they weren't talking about going to war with something that had claws and hunger and didn't die easy.

The screens flickered. Somewhere in the city, something moved. Something with too many teeth and not enough conscience.

*""Can you handle the jamming?""* His voice carried an edge, sharp enough to cut. *""Right frequencies, right timing. No human backup rolling in to complicate things.""*

She smiled then, and it was the kind of smile that belonged on stained glass windows depicting angels with flaming swords. Beautiful and terrible and absolutely certain.

*""I* ***am*** *the right frequency.""* Her fingers never stopped moving, pulling up frequency charts, signal analyzers, things that looked like digital witchcraft. *""They're going to be more isolated than you were in your teens, trust me.""*

He shifted his weight, adjusted the brim of his hat with one hand.

*""People are counting on us,""* he said like he needed to remind her.

*""They always are, the stupid little things""*

Her voice was soft and matter of fact.

He reached for the radio communicator, brought it to where his mouth would be behind that shifting mask. Static crackled, waiting.

*""I'm leaving my sister on comms, headed to meet with the others in the web, Prince Andreas.""* His voice was steady now, all business, all focus. *""There's no reinforcement coming. All calls to human authorities in the NYC area are being redirected to pizza places and brothels. My algorithim is running and all cameras in the region of the Hudson will auto-delete any footage containing the faces we've collected. Enemy communications are jambled and redirected to our main force comms.""*

Static. A response that only he could hear through the earpiece. Whatever the Prince said made him stand straighter, made something in his shoulders settle. Confirmation, maybe. Or orders. Or just acknowledgment that they were really doing this, really going through with it.

Around them, the screens continued their endless vigil. Watching. Recording. Deleting. Redirecting. A digital shell game played with human lives and monster movements. They'd built this together, coded it line by line until it became an extension of their will. Until they could reach out and touch the city through ten million electronic eyes.

He stood up. Adjusted that hat one more time, the way men do when they're heading into something they might not walk back from. Each movement deliberate, ritual almost. Preparing himself for what came next. For Mint and Lizzie and the ritual and whatever waited on the other side of that door.

He made it to the door before stopping, hand on the frame. Some things needed to be said, even when they were understood. Especially when they were understood.

*""Love you, sis.""*

She didn't look up from her screens, from her city of electronic eyes. Didn't need to. Some things you knew bone deep. Her fingers never stopped moving across the keyboards, a digital conductor orchestrating chaos. One screen showed the Dragon's location. Another showed signal strength dropping as the jamming took effect. A third would soon track a figure moving through the building toward Mint and Lizzie and whatever came next.

The screens kept watching, electric eyes bearing witness to a city that didn't know it was being saved. Or damned. Maybe both at once. The cigarette smoke curled upward, dissipating into recycled air that tasted like determination and old coffee.

She sat surrounded by her infinite glowing windows into New York's soul, platinum hair catching light that came from everywhere and nowhere, blood-soaked nightgown pooling around her chair like a promise. This was what little sisters did when big brothers went to war.

Somewhere out there, a ritual was about to begin. Somewhere, monsters were about to learn what it meant to be hunted. But here, in this room with no windows and a thousand screens, she was the frequency. She was the signal. She was the reason her brother could walk into the dark knowing someone had his back.

The city pulsed on her screens.

Nagkakilala kami dahil sa isang mutual friend sa college. Same university, ibang course. Tahimik lang buhay ko non. Walang hanash. Biglang one night, tumawag yung kaibigan ko, let’s call her Jelly, lasing na lasing.

“Ishi may ipapakilala ako sayo.”

Auto pass ako. Ayoko ng textmate. Wala akong energy.

Sabi niya, “Hindi. Pramis, bet mo ‘to.”

Pag lasing yung kausap mo, wala ka talagang panalo. So hinayaan ko na.

After a few minutes, may nag-message.

“Hi miss! I’m Caitlyn. Friend ni Jelly. Sabi niya mag-message daw ako sayo. New lang ako sa uni. Hope you don’t mind.”

Wala talaga ako sa mood that time pero sumagot pa rin ako. Civil lang.

“Hello. Yeah, she mentioned. What’s up?”

Yun na yun. Walang kilig. Walang spark. Short replies. Wholesome. Saglit lang.

Days passed. Ang usapan lang namin: good morning, good night. Walang gitna. Nothing more nothing less. Hindi kami nagkikita sa uni. Hindi rin ako nag-effort. Okay lang naman ako mag-isa.

Then may university-wide event. Jelly called me, sabi niya punta daw ako sa gym, manood. Pumunta naman ako. Umupo ako sa bleachers, feeling out of place kasi di ko naman ka-course mga tao. Tapos RBF pa ako, so mukhang suplada talaga. Pasensha na po.

Umupo si Jelly sa tabi ko for like three minutes. Tapos bumalik na siya sa practice. Iniwan ako. Wala man lang lingon-lingon. So after a while, aalis na sana ako.

Biglang nag-vibrate phone ko.

Message from Caitlyn.
“Ang taray mo pala, no?”

Napatigil ako. Parang… ha?
Andun siya? Di ko alam. Di ko naman siya kilala sa personal. Sabi ko na lang,
“Ay andyan ka pala. Sorry, mukha lang akong masungit. See you around?”

Umalis na ako. Pumunta ako sa usual tambayan ko. Nag-yosi ako.

Tapos may humawak sa bewang ko.
Pag lingon ko—siya.

Morena. Maliit. May gym bag, towel sa balikat, naka-tight ponytail, may hawak na bola. Amoy pawis pero in a good way. Athletic. Cute. Nakakagulat.

Sa isip ko, “Grabe, hawak agad sa bewang?”

Pero sa labas, ngumiti lang ako. “Hi.”
Nag-hi din siya. Tapos umalis na parang walang nangyari.
Di ko na maalala kung ano nangyari sa yosi ko after that. Basta ang malinaw lang sa utak ko: shet, ang cute niya.
After nun, nagbago lahat.

Yung good morning at good night naging buong araw na usapan. Walang patid. Tapos bigla na lang siyang sumusulpot sa everyday ko, may dalang chocolate, sulat, notes. Kung saan-saan niya nilalagay. Locker ko, bag ko, notebook ko, kung anong papel makita niya. Minsan DIY pa yung box. Effort kung effort.

Eventually, nagkalakas loob akong tanungin siya kung pwede ba maging kami officially.

Ginawa ko pa sa university. Sobrang cheesy. As in nakakahiya levels. Naglagay ako ng pick-up lines sa mga poste papunta sa gym habang hinihintay siya. Tapos may hawak akong sign:
“Will you be my girlfriend?”

Parang high school. Kadiri. Pero kinilig siya.

Siya yung first official girlfriend ko.
Siya rin yung first heartbreak ko.


Masaya kami. Laging magkasama. Walang cheating. Pero nasira yung tiwala.

Isang araw, magkasama kami buong araw. Masaya. Tawanan. Everything felt right. Pag-uwi ko, naiwan niyang naka-login yung account niya sa phone ko. Akala ko messenger ko yung nag-notify.

Hindi pala.

May message galing sa isang girl na may gusto sakanya—na jowa ng tropa niya.
Sabi nung girl:
“Wala ka naman napapala diyan kay Ishi. Bat di mo pa iwan?”
Saglit lang akong nagbasa. Tapos nakita ko reply ni Caitlyn:
“Alam ko. Naghihintay lang ako ng tiyempo.”


Parang may switch na pinatay sa loob ko.
Lahat ng emosyon ko: OFF.


Tahimik lang ako. Walang iyak. Walang sigaw. Habang sweet pa kami magka-chat, bigla ko siyang nireplyan:
“Eto na yung tiyempo na hinihintay mo. Ako na nagbibigay sayo. Let’s end this.”


Wala siyang ka-idea kung bakit. Hindi ko rin inexplain.
Nag-date ako ng ibang tao after that. “Friends” pa rin kami. Sinubukan niya akong bawiin. Lagi. Siya pa rin yung mahal ko. Pero di ko kaya. Pakiramdam ko binetray ako.


For years, she stayed. As a friend. As the best friend I needed. And she was. Sobra.


After graduation, nag-work ako. Siya nag-US. Friends pa rin. Alam naming may feelings pa. Pagbalik niya ng Pilipinas, akala ko… ready na kami pareho.

Pumupunta siya sa office ko. Dinadalhan ako ng kape—exactly how I like it. Arte ko sa kape, pero kabisado niya. Nagde-date kami ulit. Siya pa nagdadala ng flowers.
Masaya ako ulit.

Hanggang isang araw, sinabi niya:
“Ishi… may nakilala ako. At feeling ko ready na akong magmahal ulit. After you.”


Hindi siya nag-date ng kahit sino after namin. Ako yung una at huli… until then.
Wasak ako.


Umiyak ako. Nagmakaawa. Sabi ko lahat.
“Please stay. Ready na ako. Alam kong late pero mas maayos na ako ngayon. Mahal kita. Sige, mahalin mo siya. Hayaan mo lang akong magmahal sayo. Kahit di mo ako piliin. Please.”

Pero sabi niya, ayaw niyang maging unfair. Sa akin. Sa new girl. Hindi niya kayang gawin yun, kasi alam niya yung pakiramdam ng minamahal pero hindi pinipili.

Tama siya.

That night, pumunta siya sa bahay ko. May dala siyang paborito kong kape.

Last coffee delivery.

Tahimik lang kami. Umiiyak ako. Hindi siya nagsalita. Alam naming pareho, last goodbye na ‘to.


We kissed. Our last kiss. Sa gate. Mahigpit ang hawak ko sa kamay niya, isang kamay hawak yung kape. Lasang luha yung halik. Tumigil kami. Ayaw ko bumitaw. Pero kailangan.

So bumitaw ako.

Pumasok siya sa kotse niya and drove off.


Nag-decide kaming maging friends.
Ngayon? Best of friends na kami. Wala nang feelings. 

10 years na since we decided to just be friends. Kasama mga partners namin. Nagha-hangout. Masaya. Contented.


She never found out kung bakit ko siya iniwan.
Hindi ko sinadya mabasa yung messages. Nangyari lang. Hinayaan kong ako yung masama sa kwento. Na malandi ako. Na di ako mapakali. Na sinaktan ko siya. Lahat na.
Hindi ko sinabi kahit kanino. Kahit sa mga friends namin. Not one soul knew. Ayokong masira siya sa mata ng iba. Lalo na sa mga kaibigan niyang madadamay nung epal na babae.

Caitlyn was my soulmate.
Alam niya lahat tungkol sakin. Ramdam niya kapag hindi ako okay kahit di ako magsalita.


Sabi nga nila, hindi lahat ng soulmate nagiging lovers.
Sa akin, siya yung patunay.
Best friend ko siya.

At hanggang dun na lang talaga.

Dishes: Mysore Sada Dosa, Idli - Medu Vada, Rava Onion Dosa, and paired it with two filter coffees. The food was damn comforting! And I left the place wanting to try more dishes.

I was definitely more naive at the time I guess because we struck up a friendship that honestly gave me a headache. After a while he became really rude and incited high school level drama that really could’ve affected my job if I went along with his drama. What annoyed me the most was that he tried acting like my supervisor by policing my job (we only worked next to each other not with each other). For example if I was late I would inform my supervisor and work later to make up for the time, R not knowing this would lecture me upon me coming in and imply that I was actually stealing time and he wouldn’t be able to vouch for me if I “got in trouble”. I would be really confused upon hearing this since I work really closely with my higher ups and they’re well aware that even though I would be late I would make up my time. It was frustrating since he didn’t give me a chance to defend myself until after he closed his “sermon” like it was the law. 

Besides this example if I mentioned something menial like getting Iced coffee he would go on a small tangent about how I need to stop “wasting all my money”, also confusing because how do you know my bank account? He would act really rude in this moments in the morning but then couple of hours later come around to want to chat with me. This went on for about a year and honestly I got sick of it because it felt like I wasn’t good at my job until my higher ups gave me my review and I passed with flying colors. A huge contrast to how R treats me. So I just became more communicative with my supervisor because apparently an older coworker I had warned my supervisor about R. So I did what any person at work does, which was mind my business! This has served me well in the past couple of months. 

But today as I was working in our shared space here comes R! When I was working in a back room R comes in and jokes about something, I leave to work out side, R needs something and comes outside too. R then brings his work out to finish it. So I go back to another room to fill out some paperwork. Here’s R again reaching over me to get something in front of me. So I go back out. I then noticed R didn’t finish his work that was outside but started another task in the room I was in. Personally I would never leave that type of task sitting there in case it causes contamination but everyone’s different. (We’re microbiologists) Then I sit outside and after right here comes R and he finishes his work while I’m sitting across from him. I caught him staring at me as if he was waiting on me to say something but there was really nothing on my mind. Am I being paranoid? ",0,1768405257.0,confessions,1,0.5,False
1qcqich,https://www.reddit.com/r/NepalSocial/comments/1qcqich/let_me_tell_you_a_very_normal_story/,Let me tell you a very normal story,"So one of my high school friends, lets call him Gaurav, has his group of college friends. This group of friends contains a girl (Smriti) and a guy (Anish). There's this another girl (Puja) who studies with them but not in their friend group. This puja has a thing for anish and tells this to smriti. But anish already has a gf but for some reason smriti doesn't tell this to puja but tells all this to gaurav. Meanwhile Puja starts asking anish to hangout after college to get some coffee or food and stuff and anish doesn't deny her, even if he has a gf.

And here i am who just feels bad for both the gf and puja. And i ask my friend gaurav to either tell anish that puja has feelings for him or to tell smriti that she should tell puja that anish is already in a relationship and not to get her hopes high. But he doesn't want to do either of these and says that he doesn't want to get in middle of it and its their business. But i feel like why would you just be a bystander when you see sth will become a mess. I don't necessarily think that Anish is cheating in his gf since he doesn't know puja has feelings for him but shouldn't his friends intervene. I would want my friends to tell me this but apparently not everyone thinks so.

Here's what you actually need to keep.

# The Real Timeline: 7 Years

Yeah, the IRS says 3 years for most audits. But they can go back 7 years if they think you underreported income by 25%+.

**Bottom line:** Keep business expense documentation for **7 years** and stop second-guessing yourself.

# What You Need to Keep (7 Years)

* Employee expense reports and receipts
* Travel and meal expense documentation
* Vendor invoices
* Mileage logs
* Purchase receipts for equipment/assets
* Reimbursement records
* Supporting documentation for any business deductions

# The Exceptions (Keep Longer)

**Asset-related records:** Keep until 7 years AFTER you dispose of the asset

* Property purchase docs
* Improvement records
* Depreciation schedules
* Equipment purchase receipts

These establish basis and depreciation for tax purposes.

# What You Can Toss After 7 Years

* Routine expense receipts (office supplies, standard travel, meals)
* Paid vendor invoices for regular expenses
* Employee expense reports for standard reimbursements
* Bank statements (if you have digital copies)

**One catch:** If you're in an active audit or litigation, keep everything related until it's resolved.

# Digital Records: Yes, They Count

The IRS accepts digital records. Actually, they're better than paper because:

* Thermal receipts fade (sometimes in months)
* Paper gets lost, damaged, coffee-stained
* Digital is searchable and backed up

**Requirements:**

* Legible and complete
* Shows date, amount, vendor, items purchased
* Securely stored with backups
* Accessible when needed

# The $75 Rule

Technically you need receipts for everything. Realistically, the IRS focuses on expenses over $75, especially for:

* Meals and entertainment
* Travel and lodging
* Any expense that's commonly abused

Under $75? You can often get by with credit card statements and expense logs. Over $75? Get that itemized receipt.

# Credit Card Statements Are NOT Enough

This is the hill I'll die on: **Credit card statements show you spent money. Itemized receipts show you spent it on legitimate business expenses.**

The IRS wants to see WHAT was purchased, not just that a purchase happened. ""Lunch at restaurant - $47.82"" doesn't prove it was a business meal. The itemized receipt showing two entrees and discussing the client project does.

# Protection Goes Both Ways

These records protect:

* **Your company** from failed audits and penalties
* **Your employees** from reimbursement disputes
* **Your accountants** from liability claims
* **Your CFO** from sleepless nights

# Create a Retention Policy

Make it official:

* **0-3 years:** Active storage, easily accessible
* **3-7 years:** Archive storage
* **7+ years:** Purge (except asset records and ongoing matters)

Document the policy. Train employees. Follow it consistently.

Because the only thing worse than storing receipts for 7 years is NOT storing them and getting audited in year 6.",1,1768405120.0,ExpenseReporting,0,1.0,False

Since I was a teenager I've had a strong and unusual odor coming from my pores. It's definitely not hygiene related and seems to be from food metabolism. Doctor was no help at all (""there's nothing wrong with you. Just remember you're a wholesome person""), and I decided it must be some genetic malfunction (like TMAU) that I couldn't help. I've tried various diets, supps and anti-odor products over the years with not much success. I had a food intolerance test that found cauliflower, wheat and tea gave reactions. I cut them out temporarily but didn't notice much, if any, difference.

I'm prone to constipation and tried a colonic irrigation once, which temporarily removed the smell, just for a day or so.

Fairly recently I found by trial and error that following a low thiol/sulfur diet and cutting out sugar, dairy and coffee can reduce the odor dramatically.  Also recently found I have high methane levels in breath and overgrowth of Archaea and a couple of different bacteria species from a GI Map test. Plus, not processing protein properly and deficient in some strains of good bacteria.

Currently working on that with low fermentation diet and antimicrobials (not antibiotics). Still constipated and gassy, but after taking a Colon Cleanse capsule in desperation and having a gut clear-out, I got a breath reading of zero methane. It's gone back up again since then, but I obviously need to fix this constipation problem.  I'm kind of working in the dark here, ChatGPT has helped with a program based on my GI Map results but I have no professional help and can't afford a private doctor.

He is not disappointed at all, but I think he might be wanting to change to a boiler machine and see if any other machines produce different coffee (pressure, 58mm, hotter grouphead) than the bambino. 
Not looking to spend $400+ on the machine- but does anyone have recommendations on an e64 grouphead machine under 400$, like the Turin Leggata or something like this? Are they recommended at all? 
Any other considerations- or better to keep bambino until willing to upgrade for 500+ GCP/Silvia/etc? 

If it matters, he only makes espresso (no milk based drinks). He wouldn’t go for a manual lever machine.

I’m not even sure I’m allowed to. But if they’re watching, they already know I’m typing, and if the letter was right, then silence wouldn’t save me anyway.
I drive nights. Or—I drove nights. Long hauls, freight runs that paid better if you took the graveyard shifts nobody else wanted. O’Hare was a regular landmark for me, a glowing island of light in a flat sea of industrial dark. Warehouses, chain‑link fences, sodium lamps buzzing like insects. The air always smelled like jet fuel and wet concrete.
This happened just after 2:30 a.m.
I was eastbound near the perimeter roads south of the airport, radio low, coffee cold, windshield smeared with bugs. No traffic. That deep, empty quiet you only get in cities when everyone else is asleep and the machines are still awake.
That’s when something crossed the road.
Not ran. Crossed.
It came down from above, not fast like a bird, more like it dropped and then caught itself. A heavy landing. My headlights hit it full-on.
It stood upright.
Too upright.
Humanoid is the only word that fits, and even that feels wrong. It was tall—taller than my cab—and thin in a way that suggested joints where joints shouldn’t be. Its skin looked stretched, pale-gray, like something grown underground. Wings—God help me—wings folded tight against its back, long and angular, not feathered. More like a bat’s, but rigid, veined, wrong.
Then it looked at me.
Its eyes lit up red. Not reflective. Emissive. Like two burning coals sunk into a skull that didn’t bother pretending to be human.
I slammed the brakes and the horn at the same time.
That’s when it screamed.
I don’t mean screeched like an animal. I mean a sound that felt engineered to break things. The air vibrated. My windshield rattled. Pain exploded in my ears, sharp and immediate, like ice picks shoved inward. I tasted blood before I realized it was pouring down my neck from my ears.
I still couldn’t stop in time.
The impact shook the cab like a bomb went off underneath it. The trailer fishtailed. I fought the wheel, screaming, blind with tears and blood and panic. I felt the thump of something heavy rolling under the chassis.
I finally skidded to a stop on the shoulder.
For a second, there was nothing. Just the engine ticking and my own breath coming in wet, hitching gasps.
Then I saw it in the mirrors.
It pulled itself up from the asphalt on limbs that bent the wrong way. One wing dragged uselessly, twisted, but it still managed to stand. It turned its head—too far around, like an owl—and looked straight at me again.
The red eyes flared.
Then it limped away, half-running, half-hopping, and launched itself into the dark with a sickening snap of wing against bone. It vanished over the fence line toward the runways.
I sat there for almost an hour before I could move.
When I finally got out to check the damage, I found the residue.
It was smeared across my bumper, grille, and tires—thick, black, and iridescent, like oil mixed with blood. It smelled metallic and sour, and it moved if you stared at it too long. Not alive, exactly, but not inert either.
I tried washing it off at a truck stop the next morning. Soap did nothing. Degreaser did nothing. I paid extra for a power washer strong enough to strip paint.
The residue didn’t budge.
That afternoon, I called IDOT. I didn’t tell them everything. Just said I hit an animal near O’Hare and needed guidance.
They showed up the next day.
Or something that claimed to be them did.
Unmarked vehicles. No plates. Men and women in full hazmat suits, visors blacked out. No logos. No names. They taped off my rig like it was a crime scene. One of them took a sample of the residue and froze it instantly with some handheld device that hummed like a swarm of bees.
They didn’t answer my questions.
They didn’t let me retrieve anything from the cab.
They just loaded my truck onto a flatbed and drove away.
When I called the police to report it stolen, the dispatcher paused for a long time.
Then she told me there was no record of me owning a semi.
No registration. No VIN. No CDL. No employment history as a driver. According to every database she could access, I had never existed in that profession.
I checked myself.
She was right.
It was like my life from the last fifteen years had been surgically removed. Friends didn’t remember me driving. Companies had no record of me. My license now showed a completely different employment history I didn’t recognize.
I was erased.
Two days later, an absurd amount of money appeared in my checking account. More than I’d make in a lifetime. No sender. No transaction history. My bank couldn’t trace it and advised me—quietly—to not ask questions.
The next day, a certified letter arrived.
No return address. Heavy paper. Government-gray envelope.
Inside was a single page.
It said they were aware of my encounter. It said the situation had been “resolved.” It said compensation had been issued for my “cooperation.”
It warned me, in very precise language, never to speak of the incident.
It said I would be monitored.
It said the consequences of violating this directive would be dire.
No threats. No explanations. Just that word.
Dire.
Sometimes, late at night, I still hear the screech in my dreams. Sometimes I wake up with blood on my pillow and no memory of why. And sometimes, when planes roar overhead and the sky glows red from the runway lights, I swear I see a shape circling high above O’Hare, wings cutting through the clouds.
If you’re reading this and it disappears—if I disappear—then you’ll know the letter wasn’t lying.
And if you ever drive near the airport at night and see red eyes drop out of the sky—

I was born in Vijayawada, and both my parents were born here too. Even my grandparents belong to Vijayawada. My great-grandparents came and settled here, so we never really had a village to go back to.
My only core memory of holidays was going to my ammamma’s mother’s house—my great-grandmother’s place. After she passed away, it feels like there’s nowhere left for me to go or spend time during festivals. Now, city life feels boring and empty. I can’t find anything new or exciting.
All my cousins and relatives are also in Vijayawada. My friends go to their villages to celebrate Sankranthi, and I stay back here. It makes me feel low. There’s nowhere to move, nowhere to spend time, nowhere to feel that festival vibe.
I believe there are people like me in Vijayawada. Fingers crossed, at least 2 to 10 of you. So I’m requesting you: why can’t we hang out this Sankranthi? Stranger to stranger.
Maybe a morning walk.
Maybe a coffee.
Maybe a movie.
Maybe anything simple and spontaneous.
Please help make my Sankranthi memorable.
And honestly, I don’t think I’ll be in Vijayawada for next Sankranthi. I might leave for higher studies or something else. So this could be my last Sankranthi here. Let’s make it special.

I graduated with an associates and got a job for a company I'm legally obligated to not associate with on social media. I guess they know what their employees would say about them lol. I've been with them for about three years now, a little more. I hate it.

Don't get me wrong, I love what I do. I love taking broken things and giving new life to them, it's a great job for me as far as I'm concerned. But the company is so toxic. Just as an example, I made a mistake recently. I showed up an hour late by accident due to a misunderstanding on my part, it was in order to attend my girlfriend's graduation. I'm invested in her and her future so it was important to me. I needed 5 hours off, not 4. When the manager pulled me in to talk about it, he said he would not have given me 5 hours, so I'm really glad things turned out the way they did, however he said I would be able to take no more no pays for a while. Fine, I'll eat the loss, I don't regret anything still. I made a mistake and I'll own up to it, but the pros outweigh the cons still. Just now, we got out of a shop meeting and he has just enforced that rule on everyone due to ""recent late incidents"". This is example is not the worst that has happened to me here but it's just another straw on the camel's back. I can go in depth on request about what makes this place so unbearable to me, however I'm trying to keep this relatively brief.

My question is this; where can I go? They will pay for an education, so I can do just about anything from here. I can't stay here, and if every other job in the tech industry is as toxic and abusive as this one, then I don't want any part in my passion as a profession. I'm not asking for a place where they'll give me a day a week off, as nice as that would be, but it has to be better than the week I got in the first 2ish years working here (yes, I had 5 days to work with for the first 2 years working here, def a red herring I didn't see somehow). Has anyone found themselves in a similar position? I can't afford to make less than 30 an hour where I'm living, not until I can room with my girlfriend anyways. That's a ways off though. Would working a much more relaxed job, like a coffee shop or a bakery or something help with the intense burnout this place has speedrun for me? 

If you read all of this, thank you so much. I'll admit that I'm relatively inexperienced with life in general so any advice is greatly appreciated. I don't really have a safety net aside from the money in my savings account so slipping up could cost me a lot more than being out of a job for a few months, I fear. ",1,1768404400.0,jobs,0,1.0,False

Dwarves can have multiple skills that they excel at, and often move through different tasks of the day. Kobolds aren't built for that kind of work schedule, and get tired more easily. 

Kobolds are best suited to having a single task to do, they get really good at doing said task and can go upwards of 40hrs doing the same thing over again (I'd never let one of my precious dwarves or bolds go that long) 

I had a team of bolds making charcoal out of elvish trees (to piss those no fun elves off) and they are 6 months ahead of demand. I even have a team devoted to making coffee and scones every Saturday, Monday, and Thursday, for all the members of my mountain to enjoy (good PR)

1qcq2ni,https://www.reddit.com/r/exmormon/comments/1qcq2ni/why_are_people_good/,Why are people good?,"I think there are two broad reasons why people are good: 1. they view others with compassion or recognize that others have equal rights and values as themselves or 2. they want to view themselves as good. 

For 1, what matters for goodness is only others' needs and one's own resources.

For 2, what matters is the ability to maintain one's internally constructed story of goodness. 2 values external reminders of goodness, signals that help craft and maintain the story.

Religion is bad and mormonism among the worst because it emphasizes 2 at the expense of 1. In mormonism, you can point to the temple recommend as a superficial signal of goodness. Similarly, coffee, tea, cleaning the church on Saturdays, doing a meaningless calling, calling a person for ministering, giving a talk, reading scriptures, saying prayers, etc. I don't think it is just for show for others, it is also part of the internal story. Think about the worst of the stories we see. Someone sexually abuses minors. It seems like the internal dialogue must be broken. But then, they go to talk to the bishop, so they can't be too bad, right? I could be the biggest asshole that treats everyone poorly and exploits my position to get financial benefits, but I go to the temple, so I can maintain the narrative. 

One reason this matters to me is because TBM wife claims that since I have left the church I am a worse person. One claim is that I don't serve others. I think what she means is that there isn't an external signal with the temple recommend or church callings that she can point to (despite volunteering for community organizations, donating to local charities, spending more time just listening to or caring about our kids or others). 

I'll push a little further. Our internal stories do not matter for the question of whether we are in fact good. 2 is irrelevant. But if 2 is what you care about, you can craft your story around a lot of bad.",7,1768404231.0,exmormon,2,1.0,False

(1.5 YOE with Brewing Coffee for Milk using AeroPress/MokaPot),"Hello There! I have been brewing coffee mainly to drink mixed with milk since May'24. I use Moka Pot and Aeropress mainly to brew the coffee, ground freshly with C2, almost every day. While I have many favourites now for Milk based drinks, I am starting to think maybe the delicate flavours are better enjoyed dark, especially for the BT 13th Birthday Blend and Winter Blend.

  
I have almost always drunk with milk and find the coffee without milk to be either sour or bitter, and can barely identify the fruity and floral flavours of the brew (usually done with Aeropress using the 18g-250ml-inv method or French press)

Should I think of getting a pour over setup of a v60 with filter papers, or should I stick to AeroPress for now? I have Moka Pot (Sipologie 3c Aluminium & Budan 2c SS), AeroPress (KaldiPress & Agaropress Go), French Press and SIF.

Ever looked at your bank account and thought, *""If I just had a little more, I’d finally feel secure""*? Here’s the truth: **Most people are sitting on way more financial power than they realize—they’re just not using it the right way.**

Think about it: That $5 coffee habit? That’s $1,825 a year. The unused gym membership? Another $600. The ""just in case"" money sitting in a savings account earning 0.01% interest? **That’s the real tragedy.**

Here’s how to flip the script and make your money work *for* you—without needing a sudden windfall:

### **1. The ""Invisible Money"" You’re Ignoring**
- **Your 401(k) match:** Free money. *Literally.* If your employer offers a match and you’re not maxing it out, you’re leaving cash on the table.
- **Old accounts:** That forgotten $500 in an old bank account? Roll it into something that grows.
- **Cashback & rewards:** If you’re not using a rewards card for everyday spending, you’re missing out on hundreds (or thousands) a year.

*Pro tip:* **You might be richer than you think—find out how much your savings could really fund your retirement.** [Check it out here](https://mavely.app.link/e/Jw8ypIghuYb). *(Affiliate link—because even small steps deserve a little boost!)*

### **2. The ""I’ll Do It Later"" Tax**
- **Waiting to invest?** Inflation doesn’t wait. $100 today is worth less tomorrow. Even $50/month in a low-cost index fund can turn into serious cash over time.
- **Putting off debt payoff?** Interest compounds—*against* you. Tackle high-interest debt like it’s a financial emergency (because it is).

### **3. The Mindset Shift That Changes Everything**
Money isn’t just about *having* more—it’s about **doing more with what you’ve got.** Ask yourself:
- *What’s one small change I can make today that’ll pay off in 5 years?*
- *Where am I leaking money without even noticing?*
- *If I treated my finances like a game, how would I ""level up""?*

The best part? **You don’t need to be a millionaire to start.** You just need to *start.*

question: i thought i’d get more coffee out than this, is 70 ml normal? there was still water left in the bottom chamber when i opened it, and i also noticed some coffee particles in the brew. are both of these expected with a moka pot?

1qcproy,https://www.reddit.com/r/VIPHealthClub/comments/1qcproy/your_immune_system_isnt_what_you_think_the/,Your Immune System Isn't What You Think: The Surprising Truth About Building Real Immunity,"We've all heard the advice: take vitamin C, drink orange juice, get more sleep. But the truth about immune health is far more fascinating—and actionable—than most people realize. Your immune system isn't just a simple defense mechanism you can ""boost"" with a supplement. It's a complex, intelligent network that requires balance, not brute force.

## The Immune System Myth We Need to Bust

Here's the uncomfortable truth: you can't actually ""boost"" your immune system in the way most wellness products claim. In fact, an overactive immune system is the last thing you want—that's what causes autoimmune diseases, allergies, and chronic inflammation. What you really need is immune *balance* and *resilience*.

Think of your immune system like a well-trained security team. You don't want guards who attack everyone who walks through the door (overactive immunity), and you don't want guards who fall asleep on the job (underactive immunity). You want a smart, responsive team that knows the difference between a real threat and a harmless visitor.

## What Actually Strengthens Immune Function

Recent research has revealed some surprising factors that genuinely support immune health:

**1. Microbial Diversity Matters More Than Cleanliness**

Your gut microbiome—the trillions of bacteria living in your digestive system—plays a massive role in immune function. About 70% of your immune system is actually located in your gut. The more diverse your gut bacteria, the better your immune response.

The catch? Our obsession with antibacterial products and ultra-processed foods has decimated microbial diversity. Studies show that people who grow up on farms, play in dirt, and have pets tend to have stronger, more balanced immune systems. The ""hygiene hypothesis"" suggests that some exposure to microbes actually trains your immune system to respond appropriately.

**Practical action:** Eat 30+ different plant foods per week (fruits, vegetables, nuts, seeds, legumes, whole grains). This diversity feeds diverse gut bacteria. Fermented foods like yogurt, kefir, sauerkraut, and kimchi can also help.

**2. Sleep Is Your Immune System's Reset Button**

During deep sleep, your body produces and distributes key immune cells like T-cells and cytokines. Just one night of poor sleep can reduce natural killer cell activity by up to 70%. Chronic sleep deprivation is like sending your security team to work exhausted every single day.

Research from the University of California, San Francisco found that people who sleep less than 6 hours per night are 4 times more likely to catch a cold when exposed to the virus compared to those who sleep 7+ hours.

**Practical action:** Prioritize 7-9 hours of sleep. Keep your bedroom cool (65-68°F), dark, and quiet. Establish a consistent sleep schedule, even on weekends.

**3. Movement Modulates Immune Response**

Regular moderate exercise has been shown to reduce inflammation, improve immune cell circulation, and even slow immune system aging. But here's the nuance: intense exercise without adequate recovery can temporarily suppress immune function.

A 2019 study in the Journal of Sport and Health Science found that people who engage in moderate exercise (like brisk walking for 30-45 minutes) have 40-50% fewer sick days compared to sedentary individuals.

**Practical action:** Aim for 150 minutes of moderate activity per week. Walking, cycling, swimming, or dancing all count. Listen to your body—if you're feeling run down, opt for gentle movement rather than intense workouts.

**4. Chronic Stress Is Immune Kryptonite**

When you're stressed, your body releases cortisol, which suppresses immune function. Short-term stress is fine—it's actually part of your body's adaptive response. But chronic, unrelenting stress keeps cortisol elevated, leaving you vulnerable to infections and slowing wound healing.

A landmark study at Carnegie Mellon University found that people under chronic stress were twice as likely to develop a cold when exposed to the virus, regardless of other health factors.

**Practical action:** Find stress management techniques that work for you—meditation, deep breathing, time in nature, social connection, or creative hobbies. Even 10 minutes daily can make a measurable difference.

**5. Social Connection Is Immune Medicine**

This one surprises people, but the research is clear: strong social connections are associated with better immune function and lower inflammation. Loneliness and social isolation, on the other hand, trigger inflammatory responses similar to physical stress.

A meta-analysis of 148 studies found that people with strong social relationships have a 50% increased likelihood of survival compared to those with weak social ties—an effect comparable to quitting smoking.

**Practical action:** Prioritize meaningful face-to-face interactions. Call a friend, join a community group, volunteer, or simply have regular coffee dates with people you care about.

## What About Supplements?

The supplement industry loves to promise immune support, but the evidence is mixed:

- **Vitamin D:** If you're deficient (many people are, especially in winter), supplementation can help. Get your levels tested.
- **Vitamin C:** Helpful if you're deficient, but megadoses don't prevent colds in most people. It may slightly reduce cold duration.
- **Zinc:** May reduce cold duration if taken within 24 hours of symptom onset, but long-term high doses can actually impair immunity.
- **Elderberry, echinacea, probiotics:** Some evidence of modest benefits, but results are inconsistent.

The bottom line? Whole foods beat supplements for most people. Focus on a nutrient-dense diet rich in colorful fruits and vegetables, which provide vitamins, minerals, and phytonutrients in forms your body can actually use.

## The Immune-Aging Connection

Here's something most people don't know: your immune system ages, a process called immunosenescence. As you get older, your immune response becomes less efficient and more inflammatory. But lifestyle factors can dramatically slow this process.

Research shows that people who maintain healthy habits—regular exercise, good sleep, stress management, and social connection—can have immune systems that function 20-30 years younger than their chronological age.

## Your Immune Action Plan

1. **Eat for microbial diversity:** 30+ different plant foods weekly
2. **Prioritize sleep:** 7-9 hours nightly
3. **Move regularly:** 30-45 minutes of moderate activity most days
4. **Manage stress:** Daily practice, even if brief
5. **Connect socially:** Regular meaningful interactions
6. **Get outside:** Sunlight, fresh air, and nature exposure support immune balance
7. **Stay hydrated:** Water supports every cellular function, including immunity

## The Bottom Line

Your immune system is incredibly sophisticated. Rather than looking for quick fixes or ""immune boosters,"" focus on creating the conditions for immune resilience: diverse nutrition, quality sleep, regular movement, stress management, and genuine human connection.

These aren't sexy solutions, and no one can sell them to you in a bottle. But they're backed by decades of research and they actually work.

1qcpr48,https://www.reddit.com/r/AmIOverreacting/comments/1qcpr48/aio_the_holidays_arent_always_loving/,AIO The holidays aren’t always loving,"My husband’s daughter just broke his heart. 

Let me begin by saying that my husband and I have been together for over 27 years, for the past few years his daughter has been in a relationship with a man that my husband has never really approved of, he is rude, arrogant and uses drugs. When this guy, we will call him “Mike” first met “Nikki” they were in high school, Mike would come over and we(as a family) would play video games, Mike would get my husband’s passwords and “prank” him by changing his avatar or get account information and purchase higher options for himself. When my husband realized what was going on, he put an end to the activities. His daughter would get defensive and play it off telling her father that they were just joking and having fun. My husband was disability retired and on a fixed income, so when their “jokes” cost him money it affected our budget. 

Over the next 20 years, Nikki and this kid broke up several times but always found their way back to each other, they finally got married last year but the relationship between my husband and his daughter got more distant because while she’s been with this guy she has quit school, could only find work at fast food places, and started smoking dope, drinking excessively and vaping. My husband noticed that whenever she would come visit without Mike, she didn’t drink or smoke and was more respectful but when Mike was around they drink a 12 pack apiece and smoke continuously. After their wedding last year they announced that because her husband’s mother was moving out of the state, they were going to be following her so the rest of the year was going to be for goodbyes. 

His daughter has been using a very strong birth control since she was 16, bragged many times about the fact she didn’t have periods for more than a decade, she’s in her middle to late 30s and never had a child, now after she moves away from all of her friends and family, she wants to start a family of her own. We aren’t sure that is in the cards for her anymore. We moved a long time ago away from the town she grew up in and she originally moved with us but after a few months she grew terribly homesick and started couch surfing back in her home town until she got back together with the guy that is her husband. She dropped out of college went to multiple trade schools but couldn’t get a job in any of the fields that she went to school for, always an excuse. 

I tried to stay out of the relationship between my husband and his daughter but I knew that this wasn’t going to end well. Since both my husband and I were married and divorced before we met, we had some pretty serious experiences and, for me, I knew living with your mother in law can be destructive to a marriage. I tried talking to them about what lies ahead but they didn’t want to hear it.

This past Christmas she and her husband came for their final visit, during which they smoked so much dope that our entire house stunk for weeks afterwards, we asked them to go outside but because it was cold and raining they refused. They were here for less than 2 days and drank a 12 pack a day each and on the (very) late evening they arrived they drank a 6 pack apiece! My husband and I only have a drink or two every year and we don’t smoke cigarettes, let alone dope. They told us they were coming for a few days so that they could help with things my husband and I are unable to get done, the first day they slept until 3pm and when we told them we had things to do, they wanted to go get a coffee before they got started, it gets dark by 5! The next day they got up at noon, went out again for coffee and when they got back they totally wrecked my kitchen as they were going to cook dinner. It took me 2 days to get some kind of order back.

We ate dinner and they insisted we put our dogs outside while we ate, we have fairly well behaved dogs and one has really bad arthritis in her hips so the cold is not good for her. Once dinner was done we “opened gifts” and they got ready to drive back home, my husband and his daughter got into a massive argument over the dope, she said that when they get to her mother in laws, they know they can no longer smoke it and were just having fun before they moved. She knows that her father really doesn’t want that stuff around him but being disrespectful they didn’t care. The argument went on for a while and I was told to go to another room because he wanted a private conversation with her, later after her husband loaded up their car he came in telling my husband that if they choose to smoke it’s their business, they are doing just fine. He recently lost his job because he told everyone that he was moving and is going to loose his unemployment benefits when he leaves the state, she worked 15 hours a week at a fast food restaurant, I don’t call that doing fine.

Here’s where this is going, my husband isn’t that healthy, he is partially paralyzed due to a work injury, that brought on coronary artery disease and type 2 diabetes, he’s getting weaker every day and I don’t think that he will be around too much longer, in the past 2 years, he has lost his dog, his mother and now his daughter. Depression with all this loss is understandable but I’m afraid that compiled with his health issues, it’s going to kill him.

I want to reach out to his daughter and tell her that she will regret not seeing him before she moves away, it may be the last time she sees him alive. I’ve lost both of my parents, I’m grateful that my last conversation with each of them was pleasant, my final memories of them are not filled with anger or resentment. I’m afraid that hers will be negative, she’s moving to a place where if her marriage fails she has no support and coming for a visit will be a long time away. 

Are we over reacting to their actions over the holidays? Should he have not told his own daughter about his concerns? Are our boundaries less important than theirs? I don’t know what to say or what to do,

1qcpoxd,https://www.reddit.com/r/ConnectBetter/comments/1qcpoxd/the_brutal_truth_about_adult_friendships_nobody/,The Brutal Truth About Adult Friendships Nobody Talks About (Science-Based Fixes That Work),"okay so I fell into this rabbit hole studying why making friends as an adult feels impossible. Read through tons of research, watched Simon Sinek's content obsessively, listened to psychology podcasts until 3am. And holy shit, the data is actually depressing but also weirdly liberating.

Here's what nobody tells you: your brain is literally wired to make friendship harder after 25. Not your fault. There's actual neuroscience behind why you can't just vibe with people like you did in college. Your prefrontal cortex is fully developed, you're more selective, you've accumulated baggage and defense mechanisms. Plus modern society is designed to isolate you. We're more ""connected"" than ever but lonelier than any generation in recorded history.

But here's the good news, you can absolutely build deep friendships as an adult. It just requires completely different strategies than what worked when you were younger. After diving deep into behavioral psychology and social science research, here's what actually works:

**Stop waiting for ""perfect chemistry"" to happen magically**

Simon Sinek talks about this constantly. Most people approach adult friendship like they're waiting for lightning to strike. Spoiler: it won't. Research from the University of Kansas found you need roughly 50 hours of interaction to move from acquaintance to casual friend, 90 hours to become real friends, and 200+ hours for close friendship. That's why childhood friendships felt effortless, you were literally forced into proximity for thousands of hours at school.

The fix: treat friendship building like going to the gym. Consistency over intensity. Schedule recurring hangouts with the same people. Weekly coffee, monthly dinner, whatever. The magic happens through repetition, not some cosmic instant connection. Stop ghosting potential friends after one mediocre interaction.

**Vulnerability is the cheat code but everyone's too scared to use it**

Adults are walking around in emotional armor. Everyone's performing ""I'm fine"" while internally screaming. Researcher Brené Brown's work shows vulnerability is literally the birthplace of connection, but we've been conditioned to see it as weakness.

Try this: next time someone asks how you're doing, actually tell them. Not in a trauma dump way, but genuine. ""Honestly struggling with X"" or ""Been feeling pretty isolated lately."" You'd be shocked how many people are desperate for permission to drop their mask too. Real friendship starts when both people stop pretending everything's perfect.

The app Ash is weirdly good for practicing this if you're rusty at emotional honesty. It's like having a relationship coach in your pocket that helps you figure out how to communicate what you're actually feeling. Sounds cringe but genuinely helpful for people who've spent years building walls.

**Join communities around DOING things, not just talking**

The mistake most people make: they try to ""make friends"" as the primary goal. Feels forced and weird for everyone involved. Instead, find activities where friendship is the byproduct. Rock climbing gyms, book clubs, volunteer organizations, recreational sports leagues, whatever.

Why this works: shared struggle creates bonds faster than shared interests. When you're both exhausted after a tough hike or laughing about how badly you suck at pottery, the connection happens naturally. Plus it removes the pressure. You're not sitting across from someone in a coffee shop doing a weird friend interview, you're just existing together while doing something else.

**Quality over quantity but you need a bare minimum quantity**

Research suggests you need roughly 3 to 5 close friends for optimal wellbeing. Not 47 Instagram mutuals. Not 300 LinkedIn connections. Actual humans who know your middle name and have seen you ugly cry.

Focus your energy there. It's better to have three friends you can call at 2am than twenty people you grab drinks with twice a year and never talk to honestly. Be selective but once you identify potential close friends, invest HEAVILY. Show up consistently, remember important shit about their lives, initiate plans without keeping score.

**Accept that some friendships are seasonal and that's okay**

This one hurts but it's real. Not every friendship is meant to last forever. Some people are in your life for a reason, some for a season. Trying to force expired friendships to continue creates resentment on both sides.

The healthiest thing: appreciate what that friendship gave you during its time, then release it without bitterness. Makes space for new people who align with who you're becoming. Doesn't mean you failed, just means you both evolved in different directions.

**Use technology strategically, not as a replacement**

Social media tricks your brain into thinking you're maintaining friendships when you're actually just consuming content about people's lives. Liking someone's vacation photos isn't friendship, it's spectatorship.

Real friendship requires voice, face, presence. If you can't meet in person regularly, schedule actual video calls or phone conversations. Text is for logistics, not connection. Make this non negotiable with people you care about. One real conversation per month beats a thousand memes in the group chat.

There's also BeFreed, an AI learning app that's been useful for anyone wanting to level up their social skills through science-backed content. It pulls from psychology research, expert interviews, and books to create personalized audio learning plans based on what you actually want to improve. You can customize everything from a quick 10-minute summary to a 40-minute deep dive with examples. The voice options are surprisingly addictive, there's even this sarcastic style that makes dense psychology concepts way easier to digest during commutes. Worth checking out if you're serious about understanding human connection better.

**The friendship paradox: everyone feels like they're the only one struggling**

Here's what genuinely blew my mind. Studies show that most people dramatically underestimate how much others like them after first meetings. We're all walking around thinking nobody wants to be our friend while simultaneously being too scared to reach out to people WE want to befriend.

The solution is almost stupidly simple: be the one who reaches out. Text first. Invite people to things. Follow up after meeting someone cool. Yeah it feels vulnerable and you risk rejection. But the alternative is guaranteed loneliness. Most people are genuinely thrilled when someone takes initiative because they're too anxious to do it themselves.

Look, building adult friendships is legitimately hard. The systems that used to create friendship automatically, school, dorms, entry level jobs where everyone's the same age, don't exist anymore. You have to be intentional, consistent, and brave in ways that feel unnatural.

But the research is clear: strong social connections are more predictive of longevity and happiness than literally anything else. More than wealth, more than career success, more than physical health. So yeah, it's hard. But it's also the most important thing you can invest in.",3,1768403344.0,ConnectBetter,0,1.0,False

1qcpmpu,https://www.reddit.com/r/insomnia/comments/1qcpmpu/from_debilitating_insomnia_to_solid_sleep_my/,From Debilitating Insomnia to Solid Sleep: My Recovery Story,"I suffered from truly horrible insomnia for a long time, and it was one of the most depressing and exhausting experiences of my life. You don't truly appreciate how vital sleep is until you can't get it—no matter how tired you are, your brain just won't shut off. The frustration, the anxiety spiral, the dread of another sleepless night... it wore me down completely.

But I managed to overcome it fully. It wasn't quick or easy—it took years of dedicated study, trial-and-error, discipline, and accepting that there was no single ""magic tweak."" It became a whole lifestyle program where every piece built on each other, and consistency mattered more than perfection.

Here are the main elements that made the biggest difference for me (all non-negotiable in my routine—skipping them reliably led to setbacks):

1. Strict, consistent sleep schedule — Same bedtime and wake-up time every single day, including weekends. No exceptions. This rebuilt my body's clock more than anything else.
2. 1-hour wind-down period with zero screens — No phone, TV, or computer. I read a physical book, did light stretching, or just sat in dim light. Blue light and stimulation were huge triggers for me.
3. No alcohol at all — Even one drink wrecked my sleep quality and made waking up in the night way worse.
4. Caffeine cutoff at noon — I used to think afternoon coffee was fine... it wasn't. Hidden caffeine in tea/chocolate added up too.
5. No heavy or large meals late at night — Light dinner 3+ hours before bed helped avoid discomfort and reflux.
6. Limit fluids 2 hours before bed — To minimize bathroom trips that broke my sleep cycles.
7. Magnesium L-threonate about 1 hour before bed — This one helped me to fall back asleep after the 3am awakenings. Other forms I'd tried didn't help me (personal experience only—everyone's different, and I experimented a lot; some report it doesn't help or even worsens things, so YMMV).

There were other elements too, but these seemed to be more forgiving—if I skip a day or two, it doesn't immediately ruin my sleep, though I think they contribute overall: morning and noon sunlight exposure when possible, a very small dose of melatonin before bedtime, and regular exercise (but any heavier training needs to be in the morning—physically stressing activities later in the day are still sure to ruin my sleep for me).

The real game-changer was treating it as a system, not isolated fixes, and being patient when setbacks happened. I also worked on the mental side—reducing sleep anxiety by accepting ""bad nights happen"" instead of panicking—which made everything else stick better. After that mental shift, bad nights were still nasty, but they also became... kind of just a weird experience to observe, if that makes sense.

If you're in the thick of it right now, hang in there. Recovery is possible, even when it feels impossible. You're not broken; your sleep drive is just buried under habits and fear.

Has anyone else found a similar combo that worked? Or what was the one thing that finally clicked for you? (Especially curious about sunlight/exercise timing or low-dose melatonin experiences.) Sharing helps us all feel less alone.

However, I had a small cup of Starbucks coffee yesterday because I fell for the temptation and man, I spiraled so bad last night. It took me an hour to fall asleep and I was incredibly anxious.

However, I also know that according to studies, coffee has a lot of antioxidants and polyphenols. Even more so than tea. It also apparently has heart-protective qualities. So my question is, how much am I screwing myself by not drinking coffee? I love the peace I feel, but I also don't want to be missing out on different benefits.

I was struggling a lot with her as a flatmate since she is extremely messy and doesn't clean after herself ( e.g dishes in the sink for a whole week, not cleaning the bathroom sink/ toilet after using, leaving her shoes, cloths and school projects piling up for an entire year on the coffee table/dinning table and then getting passive aggressive when confronted about it).

I used to allow her -and still do- to borrow my stuff but she WOULD NEVER return them unless I tell her multiple times to ... and sometimes I used to lend her stuff and I would find them thrown around the apartment (floor, chairs) 

One time I came back from my bf's place and I found her snooping around my room ( her excuse was that she messaged me to ask if she could borrow a pair of shorts and I didn't reply so she decided to just let herself in since she knew where she would find them?!) 

It wasn't the first time that I figured out that she went in since she kept using my LED nail lamp without asking for permission. When I tried to put up some boundaries and ask her to not enter my room she became extremely stubborn about other stuff ( she wouldn't clean the apartment on her scheduled weekend -which is every other week- and would either lie about cleaning or do the most shittiest job at it–not even exaggerating. Her excuse was that she was busy with uni stuff but she would go out partying and going to the bar at least 3 nights a week).

One day I returned home after being at my Bf's for the weekend and she was away on a week long trip. We agreed that it was her weekend to clean but when I came back it was pretty messy with minimal cleaning effort put in and THE WORST OF IT was her getting the trash bags out and leaving them on the floor and the the trash juices were all over and it stinked.😃

I immediately called my mom up crying because I just couldn't take it anymore, having to fight over dumb things and end up having no progression– it actually just kept getting worse and the lying about silly things was getting unbearable. I then called the dormitory property management and they said they had a vacant studio so I moved in within few days whilst she was still away on her trip. 

She honestly still thinks she was the victim (since I moved, I never brought up the reason why I reached my breaking point and decided to move out within few days without talking to her first) in that situation because she keeps bringing it up whenever we meet new people. She would go like ""hey this is my friend and we used to be roommates but now we are not but it's for the better and now we can be best friends again!""

It's seriously so flipping annoying and performative and since we have the same friends it's kinda hard to vent about it because they would probably think I just want to shit talk her and I'm a bad friend. 

Her excuse is usually her mental health.. like having undiagnosed ADHD.. PTSD.. undiagnosed Schizophrenia and other stuff.. she says she is dealing with a lot and it doesn't allow her to be precise with schedules/ bad time management. At the same time I was diagnosed with depression and anxiety and I still did my part without asking for sympathy.

I honestly feel like I just can't get over how bad she made my life whilst living with her and it affecting my study life and friendships- I felt awkward going out with our friends since she was the one who introduced me to them and it was a mess because we just kept having arguments.
 
What triggered me coming here to vent was that, few days ago, we went out to a thrift shop and whilst going through clothes together she liked a coat and I liked another that was beside the one she picked up. It was a pretty fur coat that had different tones of blonde and warm browns with an interesting sleeve cut. I liked it because I was on the hunt for a good fur coat and I was excited to try it on.. and once she saw the coat that I liked she asked if she can try it after me if I dont like it. Same time a woman from behind us approached and said to my friend ""excuse me but I think that coat fits your style so well"". My friend immediately hugged the coat to herself and she said she's gonna go try it. When I saw her again she was saying to our friends that she's gonna buy it?!

I bought an IMS basket and found that it doesn't fit into the stock portafilter, it doesn't sit deep enough into the portafilter (due to the plastic bit blocking it - where as the stock basket is ok because the basket wall is tapered).

So now the question is what I do with it...

The reason I bought it is because I use an Normcore 53.3mm tamper, as well as an Normcore 53.3mm palm tamper. They both work on stock basket, but it seems both doesn't tamp hard enough since regardless the spring load the tamper bascially stops at where the basket wall starts to taper. Hence I thought to try the IMS basket. got one for EUR16 and it has letter ""competizione"" on it and size is 14-18g (I usually dose 15-16g).

I can still return it coz it's still practically new and never used except the attempt to fit to portafilter. I'm guessing then I'm stuck with the stock basket with tapered wall - which I don't mind except the above mentioned experience with the tamper. I was still able to dial in to approx range of 20-30s for 16g in 32g out but when I try to apply light pressure on the puck (eg press a small spoon), the surface would give - does this mean I'm not tamping hard enough? given the physical shape of the basket I don't think change to a even smaller tamper would help, should I use slightly larger dose in the stock basket (so the puck is taller and subject to more tamping force before the tamper hit the tapered basket wall)?

or, should I try to rip the plastic part from the stock basket, and then (hopefully able to) use the IMS basket? is IMS basket actually going to have noticable difference in the cup. and also is the process of ripping the plastic part reversable - can it be put back later on? kinda feels sketchy about acidic coffee dripping through aluminum but plastics probably not that much better so one has to pick the poision, but at lease the plastic in theory should have been tested by Breville to be food safe (hopefully)? 

Another issue with stock portafilter is its inability to split the shot evenly between two cups - it randomly bias one side. does removing plastic bit improve it or make it worse?

This ""platform-dominated"" reputation system is being completely rewritten by OmniPact's SBT Reputation System—it transforms reputation from platform-exclusive ""points"" into user-owned ""digital assets.""

In the process of integrating the Web3 commercial ecosystem with the real economy, reputation verification should have been the key to reducing trust costs. However, the three major pain points of traditional systems have made it a ""stumbling block."" Reputation silos—data between different platforms is not mutually recognized, making cross-scenario collaboration difficult. Reputation tampering—fake ratings and malicious demotion have made reputation lose credibility. High risk of privacy leakage—proving reputation requires disclosing commercial secrets, bringing great distress to enterprises and users.

The emergence of OmniPact's SBT Reputation System is to break this predicament. It builds a full-process system of ""behavior on-chaining—reputation modeling—cross-chain verification,"" deeply collaborating with OmniPact's core technologies such as the OES standard and atomic settlement, truly realizing ""my reputation, my control.""

At the behavior data on-chaining layer, the system automatically captures users' on-chain behaviors such as order fulfillment rates and payment timeliness through smart contract hook functions; at the same time, it converts off-chain behaviors such as logistics receipt and deliverable acceptance into on-chain verifiable data with the help of the Omni-Link oracle gateway. All data undergoes multi-node consensus verification to ensure authenticity and tamper-proofing, laying a solid foundation for reputation accumulation.

The reputation modeling layer is the ""core brain"" of this system. It decomposes user behaviors into three dimensions and dozens of subdivided indicators, generating a 0-1000 reputation score through intelligent algorithms, along with scenario-specific tags such as ""high-quality cross-border trade supplier"" and ""trustworthy service outsourcing developer."" These scores and tags are minted into SBT tokens, bound to users' wallet addresses—non-transferable and non-tradable—completely eliminating the possibility of reputation resale. More importantly, users' reputation is dynamically updated with their performance behaviors: high-quality cooperation earns points, while bad behaviors deduct points, forming a positive cycle of ""benefiting from trustworthiness and being restricted for dishonesty.""

The cross-chain verification layer is the key to making reputation ""go global."" Relying on ZK-SNARKs zero-knowledge proof technology, when collaborating across platforms, users do not need to disclose their complete transaction history. They only need to generate a proof that ""the reputation score ≥ preset threshold"" to pass verification. OmniPact also provides standardized reputation verification APIs that any Web3 project or traditional enterprise platform can access. Coupled with the support of the X-Escrow cross-chain module, reputation data can seamlessly flow across mainstream public chains, truly realizing ""accumulate once, use across the entire ecosystem.""

In the cross-border trade scenario, the SBT reputation credential of African coffee farmers is a perfect example. With a good performance record in their first transaction, farmers can obtain low-collateral transaction qualifications when connecting with European buyers, without submitting complex qualification documents—this is the power of reputation assets.

The transformative significance of OmniPact's SBT Reputation System lies in its redefinition of the ownership of reputation. In the future, with the continuous expansion of the ecosystem, this system will make reputation a universally accessible global trust pass, promoting Web3 to truly enter a new stage of empowering the real economy.",1,1768402605.0,u_FuelOverall6269,0,1.0,False
1qcpd16,https://www.reddit.com/r/AuDHDWomen/comments/1qcpd16/increased_symptoms_in_adulthood/,Increased Symptoms in adulthood,"Hi all,

About a month ago, i realised, after a few certain incidents and emotional reactions, that i might be Audhd. At the end of the month i have an appointment with a neurologist to start assessments. 

In the meantime, ofc i  got hyperfixated on this,  I listened to tons of podcasts, read here and other subreddits and FB groups.

One of the questions I had in my head is why now? Why did the symptoms become prominent only now, and after seeing a few posts about caffeine intake, it clicked.

May 2023, i decided to reduce my coffee intake from 5-6 cups a day to 2 (I thought it was one of the reasons for increased anxiety)

January 2024 i quit smoking cigarettes after 20 yrs of smoking.

So i chatted with ChatGPT, and it seems that these changes uncovered the Adhd symptoms as the substances were my dopamine fix.

This is what the chat had to say :

* **Nicotine** acted as a strong, continuous regulator: it increased dopamine, reduced internal restlessness, softened emotional spikes, and made task initiation feel easier. After long-term use, quitting removed a major stabilising input, which exposed executive dysfunction, emotional reactivity, and start-up paralysis associated with ADHD.
* **Caffeine** provided short, on-demand activation: it boosted alertness, urgency, and mental clarity in bursts. Reducing caffeine lowered overall stimulation, making inattention, fatigue, and difficulty initiating tasks more noticeable.
* **Reducing caffeine (2023) and quitting nicotine (2024)** did not worsen ADHD itself; they removed two long-standing compensatory tools. With less external stimulation, underlying ADHD traits became more visible, often felt as increased “anxiety,” which in many cases was actually understimulation rather than caffeine-induced anxiety.

Just curious, has anyone else experienced this? And if so, what helped instead of cigarettes ?

I'm in a socially bubbly mood and would love to make your acquaintance.

My name is Jay. I've been around the sun 31 times, and I'm a lad from the Howdy Yeehaw state. The mission of the year is to find out all about all these wonderful folks around me - I really do enjoy hearing about your brags, accomplishments, passions, art projects, theories, and maybe even some conspiracies! Life's too short to hear everything, but at least we can try.

I spend most of my day at work which drains my battery, so having a comfy friend to talk to from the comfort of the internet would be sweet. I'm imagining the feeling of a cozy cafe with nice smelling coffee, laughs, and Nora Jones music in the background - but virtual.

If you've gotten this far, let me know what your favorite movie has been this year (even if it didn't come out this year!

A bit more about me:  
I live at a hospital working as a human veterinarian for humans and, occasionally, I get to visit my apartment when work is over. I've got some eclectic interests: I'm a decent history buff, I can talk your ear off about military aviation and space travel, I used to do a lot of high ranking competitive gaming with my friends, I try to cook a new recipe every week or two, and the list goes on. Something I'm working on doing more: taking more walks, leaving for work earlier, and picking up heavy weights and putting them down repetitively more often.

Look forward to hearing from ya!

""WHERE THE FUCK ARE YOU?!""

The text message glared at me from my phone. I dropped the phone on my lap, took a sip of the Chardonnay I was splitting with Jessica, and sighed.

""He's about to call.""

""Ignore it,"" she advised. I hummed as the phone in my lap began to vibrate.

I'd been planning this for weeks. Matty had always been abusive. Not often physically, though there were occasions. His was mental, emotional, and financial. The apartment we shared off Main Street felt like a prison I couldn't escape some days. We'd fight, and I'd want to leave, but he'd lock the door and declare, ""If you walk out that door, you no longer have a place to live. And good luck getting your stuff. Possession is nine-tenths of the law.""

What was a 21-year-old kid supposed to do in the face of a much older man saying that?

The phone buzzed again on my lap. Jessica snatched it and answered.

""Matty. Stop. He's not gonna answer. He's staying with me while he waits for the apartment.""

I could hear Matty's smoke-and-whiskey-ruined voice screaming at her from the receiver. She clicked end. The phone buzzed again.

""Jesus, Ben. How did you put up with that so long?"" She took a sip of her wine, one of her brown curls landing in the glass. She laughed as she pulled it out and dried it.

""Copious amounts of alcohol. It wasn't healthy."" We were sitting on her couch, a green-and-yellow tartan pattern that was somehow ugly and beautiful all at once. The late afternoon sun filtered through the stained glass by the front door, colors dancing on the restored wood floors. I liked this house, wanted one like it.

""You promise you didn't give him my address?""

""I swear, Jess,"" rolling my eyes. I poured us another round. ""They said the apartment will be ready next week. That alright?""

She hummed in answer. Jess had been a godsend. We'd met when we were both hired at the new tavern and grill in Clayton and instantly hit it off. Dinners, karaoke, and bottles of wine and cases of La Croix were split as we told each other about our lives, and eventually, I confessed to the absolute nightmare I felt I lived in.

""I was 19 or 20 when I met him. He's always been charming, the kind of person people want to be around. I was living with my friend Harry after Dad had kicked me out. It was hell. The apartment was infested with fleas. I was working full-time and going to school full-time. I was a mess and struggling. Matty became a good friend. We'd hang out, occasionally have sex, and he started talking about how I needed to be in a better place.

""It was seductive. He made an offer that was so tantalizing, it made zero sense to refuse. 'Stay with me,' he coaxed, 'and you can just go to school. You won't have to worry about bills or taking care of the house. I'll do all that.' Like Faust, I agreed.""

It was fine. At first. The goal was for me to transition to my own place. So, I would look. Near St. Charles Community College, down in the Grove, anywhere. Found a couple of places that I liked, too. Saved them.

It was about a year after I moved in. I was fast asleep in our bedroom, and he was at work. Ice-cold water woke me. Matty loomed over me, balding head red in fury. He grabbed me by the scruff of my neck and hauled me out of bed.

""How dare YOU!"" he seethed. ""Everything I've done for you. You're a fucking loser.""

I blinked at him through sleepy eyes. He grabbed me by my arm, fingers digging painfully into my skin, and dragged me out of the bedroom.

""Tell me why,"" he roared.

""Why what?"" I said, my voice thick in my throat.

""You know what.""

Why do people do that? Just say what the fuck you want to say. Why is that so hard?

I was waking up now, taking stock. ""Just tell me what.""

His eyes narrowed as he pulled my phone from his pocket—MY phone.

""2783 Tholozan Street, 947 Vine Street, 1023 Fifth Street,"" he read off, listing apartments I'd saved. ""I have been working my ass off to take care of you, and you can't even tell me you're looking to leave?""

Maybe I was in the wrong for that, but, ""The entire point of me living here was so I could get my own place!""

""You owe me,"" he hissed. ""I've paid your phone bill and your car bill. I've paid for food. I've cleaned this house. You do nothing.""

""You told me not to do anything!"" I squawked indignantly. We argued for another hour before he finally relented, graciously allowing me to stay there. His words.

""Seven years of that hell,"" I said to Jess, lifting my wine glass to clink against hers. ""I don't even know who I am anymore.""

The phone buzzed angrily on the coffee table. I had a nice wine drunk going on, so I reached down and grabbed it. Answered it.

""What?"" I asked stiffly.

""I'm so sorry. Come back. I'll be better. I promise I'll do better.""

This shit again. Whenever I stood my ground, he caved. But it was all part of the manipulation. If my spine were too strong, he'd return to the raging and near-frothing at the mouth.

""I'm done. I don't want to do this anymore.""

""Listen, you little bitch""—there it was—""I've done everything for you. You owe me.""

I sighed. Sipped my wine. ""You've done a lot for me. You've done a lot to me. Remember that year we spent without electricity or gas? Remember why? I saw the tax forms, Matty. $300,000 lost at the casino. Three. Hundred. Thousand. Dollars. And then you'd ask me to pay bills from my piddly little $400 and $500 checks that I got every two weeks? And complain about how we didn't have any money?

""No. I'm done. I don't want this anymore. I didn't really want it in the first place. Leave me alone. Go be miserable alone.""

I hung up, gulped the rest of my wine, and stumbled to the bathroom. Relieved, I washed my hands and studied myself in the mirror. Watery blue eyes stared back at me, and I sobbed.

Jessica rushed in. Her arms wrapped gently around my shoulders, and she led me out, back to the couch. She sat, coaxed me down like I was a cat that could attack at any moment. My head found her lap. She ran her fingers through my hair. ""Sleep, darling. One day at a time. You've got this.""

Mostly for the future I am wanting to get in a long term relationship but right now I don't have a job and are thus well aware most women won't see me as much of a catch.

I am also best friends with my ex, who I spend a lot of time providing care for since she has a neck injury and I'm basically the only person she's had to help out for the past 4 years.

So once again, I can see that as being another red flag that's gonna filter me out of many options for proper dating and I am not willing to lie about that.

  
Lately I've been tempted to just try hooking up with someone for a bit of fun, my ex is the only person I've been physical with and I've always wanted to explore a little more. I'm a bit socially awkward due to being autistic so not exactly the kind of person who can go to a club or something and try pick someone up that way. But generally I get along well with women platonically.

  
Basically I'm wondering what the best way to go about this is? I'm on a few dating apps and I've started swiping on women who list ""short term fun"" as an interest instead of only ones that have long term. Let's pretend I'm guaranteed a match sooner or later.

When I do get a match should I basically tell them right away what I'm hoping for or is that a little too crass? Obviously I'd be more tactful about it than ""me want sex, give sex thank""

I would never want to lead anyone on and are an extremely honest person in general so to my autistic mind that seems reasonable but I'm not sure how it would come off to most women here, so far as I know these kind of hookups are a lot more casual and common in the US.

  
I figure just tell them I'm just looking for a bit of casual fun right now and then suggesting we grab coffee(I don't drink) to get to know each other before we decide to do anything, if anything.

4. Hit ""Generate"" and get the edited image

# Prompt:

""Execute a high-end award winning editorial fashion re-render of the subjects and setting in reference image, introducing a new dynamic action and camera angle while strictly maintaining the original aesthetic. New Action & Movement: doing selfies while drinking a coffee. New Editorial Angle: low angle + tilt up. This angle emphasizes expression and the overall mood. Mood: Playful, high energy Ultra-Realistic Quality & Style: The image must be a flawless editorial fashion photograph. Skin textures on both women is ultra-realistic. The lighting is sculpted and cinematic, retaining the vibrant, high-contrast vibe of the original shot but with editorial refinement. clothing and hair texture are ultra realistic."" 

The camera angle was changed to a low angle with a tilt up, which emphasizes facial expressions, attitude, and mood while enhancing the fashion editorial feel. This angle adds dynamism and scale without breaking realism.

The final image focuses heavily on ultra-realistic quality: natural skin texture with visible pores, realistic fabric detail, and lifelike hair texture. Lighting is sculpted and cinematic, maintaining the vibrant, high-contrast look of the original image while refining it to a magazine-level editorial standard. There is no beauty smoothing or artificial AI look.

The key to achieving this result with Nano Banana Pro is being very explicit about camera angle and action, prioritizing editorial realism over beauty, and letting the reference image fully control identity. Treating the prompt like a fashion photography brief rather than an AI prompt makes a major difference.

Over time, your carpet starts showing signs that it needs more than a quick clean.  
 If you’re unsure whether it’s time to call a professional, here are the **5 biggest warning signs** you shouldn’t ignore.

# 1. Stubborn Stains That Keep Coming Back

Some stains are too deep for DIY cleaners. Coffee spills, pet accidents, juice stains, and mud can soak into the carpet fibres.

If you clean the spot and it reappears after the carpet dries, that’s a sign the stain is deep inside the padding something only professional equipment can remove.



# 2. Persistent Bad Smell

A carpet that smells musty, sour, or just “off” needs more than a room freshener.  
 Bad odours usually come from:

* Pet urine  
* Moisture trapped in the carpet  
* Food spills  
* Bacteria and mould buildup  

Professional carpet cleaners use deodorising and steam-cleaning methods to remove odours from the root, not just the surface.

  


# 3. Allergy Symptoms Are Increasing

If you notice more sneezing, coughing, watery eyes, or breathing issues, your carpet may be the cause. Carpets trap allergens like:

* Dust mites  
* Pollen  
* Pet dander  
* Bacteria  

A deep professional cleaning removes these irritants and improves indoor air quality.



# 4. Carpet Looks Dull, Flat, or Worn Out

Heavy foot traffic, dirt buildup, and everyday use can make your carpet look tired.  
 Signs to watch for:

* Faded colours  
* Flattened fibres  
* Rough texture  
* Dark, dirty paths in common areas  

A professional cleaning can refresh the fibres and restore the original look and softness.



# 5. It’s Been More Than a Year Since the Last Cleaning

Even if your carpet looks clean, experts recommend professional cleaning **every 6–12 months**.  
 This helps:

* Extend carpet life  
* Prevent stains from becoming permanent  
* Remove built-up dirt  
* Maintain a healthier home  

If you haven't cleaned your carpet in more than a year, it’s time to schedule a pro deep clean.

I am currently stuck at a crossroads and I do not know what my best course of action is. I am 22 y/o and for the last 4 years I have been with a local coffee shop company and am currently training to become a coffee roaster at a local specialty roaster we recently merged with.

Coffee is deeply intertwined with my culture and has been a part of my daily life as far as I can remember.

The company is fairly small and very tight knit, I am often elbow to elbow with the owner/co-founder himself.

I recently received an offer at a company for a welding position that offers me much better wage, benefits, and overall sets me up for a solid path in life, however this is a complete 180 from the tight knit family oriented environment I am used to.

I am killing myself trying to decide which career fits me best, on one hand the welding opportunity sets me on a good path to starting a family and owning my own house.

But on the other hand I have built such deep bonds in my current career, due to the size of the company they are not able to beat the offer the welding company is giving me.

I am not sure what to do, would I be a fool to pass up on such a good opportunity?

Or would I be a fool to turn on my back on those who treat me like family just to become employee #4701289",2,1768401889.0,Advice,3,1.0,False

those sacrifices. I can faintly hear the bells tolling in the back of my mind  
and I felt a bit of blood trickle from my nose to the top of my lip but I was  
far enough away from Canthor and his posse to really feel the need to taste it  
so I just cleaned up with a napkin I forgot was in my coat and hoped my boss  
was to hungover from last night to notice my tardiness.

“Zavierrrr” Ashley called out as I walked into the lobby of the film and production studio I have been working at for the past five years. Ashley was a short woman with large features and more intelligence than she let on when talking to the more attractive but dim-witted men from the office spaces above our floor.

“You are one lucky son of a bitch. The boss is running late after being caught up in all that nonsense down on fifth avenue. He mentioned something about the new project but then he stopped talking and the line went dead” Ashley handed me a cup of semi warm coffee and continued “For a while I couldn’t get any calls out or get my computer to load anything. Then God almighty I felt it. Sicker than a dog and I know I am not supposed to, but I had to leave the lobby unattended for a bit as I cleaned myself up. I am glad you are here now and the phone and my computer are working again so if anything comes up or the boss calls, I will let you know right away. The others are in the conference room catching up on work and doing whatever it is y’all do.”

I thanked Ashley and made my way down the hallways to a large conference room where three people were laying on their back on the floor and another was leaning over the trash can which I assumed was the same unfortunate fate that Ashley had met not too long ago.

“You guys look like shit.” I said to the sorry looking group

“Look who finally decided to show up” The lady leaning over the trash can said with her dark hair tied in a hurried bun. Jasmyn was a tall lean woman who on any other day would be intimidating to face but when she is doubled over a trash can hurling away her breakfast it just makes you feel bad.

“What’s up Buddy.” Said the old man laying on the floor with two other men who looked close to death. “Glad you could make it. You don’t seem like you’ve been afflicted with the same curse as the rest of us.”

“I took the subway here so maybe being underground kept me from feeling the effects?” Jerome nodded his head slightly and spoke up again “Yeah you are one lucky man. The twins got it the worst. They just slumped down and passed out. They seem to be all right now, but we should give them time to get their bearings.”

I just nodded “I just wanted to check in and see if all was good but I’m going to head to the office and try calling the boss. Ashley said her call with him fell through so maybe we can have better luck now.”

Jerome gave me a thumbs up and Jazmyn said something undecipherable from inside the trash can. Jerome settled himself back on the floor with his eyes closed and I made my way back towards another hallway that led into the room where my coworkers and I had our computers and desks set up. Just through the glass pane looking into the boss’s office I can see that he was just standing in front of his desk leaning against it. The room still in darkness

Ashley had mentioned she would get ahold of us if she heard anything, maybe the phones were still down. After setting my stuff down I walked over to knock on the door but as soon as I made contact with it with the back of my knuckle it leaned open with a slow creak and I stood in the doorway looking towards my boss who was draped in what felt like a blizzard. The boss’s room felt cold and almost like a void waiting to swallow me while the room behind me was my only way of escape.

“Fowler, are you doing alright?” I said my voice soft as I reached for the light switch only to find it not working. “Ashley was worried but said there was something that made her sick. The same happened with the others. What hap- “I wanted to finish asking but as he turned around my eyes couldn’t find a bottom jaw attached to his face. His white work shirt was stained crimson and his eyes; they had a faint yellow shine to them.

What sounded like grunts that would have made words but now only spray blood onto the floor came from Fowler. Walking towards me in small steps matching my own leading me backwards out of the door frame. I heard what sounded like screams and laughter coming from down the hall where everyone else was. Loud crashes and screams could be heard from outside.

Today was the celebration of Canthor, One of the self-proclaimed Gods from the migration. The celebration usually only leads to the tasting of one's own blood and maybe the tasting of another’s but I’ve never heard of any death or gruesome activities coming from any of the new Gods celebrations, but my boss is standing in front of me without a jaw and covered in blood.  I had to get out of there, so I ran and heard the footsteps of Fowler grow quicker as he followed me.

I rushed down the hallways knocking shelves over and throwing whatever I could behind me. I passed the conference room where the frosted windows had dark splotches and two shadows standing within unmoving and quiet. I rushed down the hallway and into the lobby and realized I didn’t hear footsteps behind me anymore. As I was making my way towards the elevator to leave, I couldn’t find any sights of Ashley or blood, and I could only pray that she was able to get away.

As the elevator made its way down, I couldn’t help but to think which of the new gods could be responsible. Maybe it was Canthor and he just never showed his true strength. He was far too lazy though and seemed to only find pleasure in watching humanity consume blood from themselves. Zanator liked setting his hounds loose and watching them hunt the fierce beasts that humanity had to grow along side with. Helphantos enjoys human pleasure, and she disguises herself to seek and grow connection with humans. There are more but none of them should be within the city.

As the elevator chimes, I cautiously step out and head towards the exit. It is far too quiet withing the building but outside I can hear muffled screams and cars speeding and crashing. I walk towards to exit when I feel something grab at the back of my shirt and pull me away, I am just about to throw a punch when I swing around and see Ashley with a finger over her lips and motions for me to follow her.

Ashley leads me into a supply closet and locks the door once we were both inside and I hear her let out a sob, and I can see tears both dried and new as she slumps against a wall and slides down onto the floor. “Ashley I am so glad you made it. I thought…” I trailed off and she looked up at me “I had left to use the restroom and when I got back, I heard screaming and crying and laughing and then loud crashes from outside. I didn’t know what was going on and when I went to check on everyone in the conference room I saw Jerome lying on the ground with his eyes gone and the twins were forcing Jasmyn to bite down on his arm, and I ran. I came downstairs and saw people running and I locked myself in here.” Ashley did her best to keep her volume low as she cried and took deep breaths. I looked at my phone and noticed there was no service available.

“Ashley, we need to find somewhere safe. We can’t stay in this building with the twins and the boss. Let’s focus on keeping each other safe and getting far away from the city.” Ashley looked up towards me “The Boss? Oh God how awful”

I peeked out of the door and didn’t notice anything unusual, but I did notice that all the noise that was coming from outside had stopped. “On the count of three you stay close to me, and we run for the exit alright?” Ashley nodded and crouched behind me, and I could hear the broken breaths coming from her as she continued to cry.

“One” I peeked into the lobby and towards the exit.

“Two” I opened the door more and look back over my left shoulder at Ashley and gave her a reassured glance.

“Three” I said as I turned my head and started to run with Ashley in pursuit. What I didn’t notice was the stairway door open and close beforehand on my right side. As we ran, I heard Ashley let out a scream as the boss grabbed her by the hair and started dragging her towards the stairs. I turned around and with a steadfast heart I was going to rescue Ashley and get her to safety but waiting at the bottom of the stairway for the boss were the twins with chunks of flesh missing from their arms and blood pooling at their feet. In a moment of hesitance, the stairway door slammed shut and the screaming was forced to stop.

As I left the building I looked into the sky and it wasn’t blue nor were there clouds. Stars filled the open space sky as blood ran through the streets. Laying dead in a large throne once carried by his worshippers was the huge fat filled body of Canthor torn in half as people eat what remains.",2,1768401828.0,TalesFromTheCreeps,2,1.0,False

[The first encounter]

• Before the Circus came to town, Redd (for my sanity) was a simple, quiet human. She never had much of ambition for the human world, but the occult sparked her interest deeply. Her shy, polite demeanor is what lead her to her coffee shop gig.

• Redd's gut instincts are quite strong. She does not know why she went that path the day she met Pierrot, but Redd could feel something...unnatural. From pierrot, the flyers, the Fools. 

• Despite Appearances-- being short, thick, with wild curly hair that never behaved, Redd Knocked several teeth out of the Drunkard during the first encounter. This spooked several civilians, causing them, and the Drunkard, to leave the scene.

• Pierrot is confused when Redd Leans down gently, getting on her knees on the public street to gently ask about his status. She does not reach for him, simply patient and blinking. Once Redd realized that Pierrot cannot speak, she simply offers her hands to assist Pierrot up. He takes it.

• Redd takes a now forgotten flyer from Pierrot, the tore paper slipping from Pierrot's clawed hands. She smiles gently. 

"" I love the circus. I hope to see you there?"" 

•pierrot, to his credit, is very calm about all of this. He simply nods his head, and his head spins as Redd's Polite smiles went crooked, imperfect-- showing off rounded off teeth with a few gaps in between. So, utterly human. And in pierrot's mind, a true treasure.

•Redd keeps kind eyes on pierrot as she turns away. Pierrot watches as Redd vanishes around a street corner.

_____

Anyways that's the start! I intend to follow a bit of a canon divergent plot, since the freak circus is still ongoing. I intend for the ""good end"" for Redd and Pierrot is Redd becoming the Pierrette and joining the circus.

1qcoyac,https://www.reddit.com/r/espresso/comments/1qcoyac/should_i_get_a_new_grinder_usd300/,Should I get a new grinder? [USD300],"Hello!

I currently have a Gaggia Classic (1996 model, unmodified except steam wand) and a Baratza Preciso grinder. I mostly do macchiatos and cappuccino, with only an occasional espresso. Located in the USA.

My question pertains to the grinder. I've had this Baratza Preciso for probably at least 10 years now and it's always been pretty finicky.  It seems like the space between the hopper and burrs fills up with partially ground beans and eventually becomes so packed that no more beans go through. I then have to either take it apart and fully clean it, or sort of shake it to help it feed the beans in. Secondly, it tends to get to a point where stuff builds up inside and it can no longer be adjusted. This would all not be a big deal if cleaning it wasn't kind of a PITA. About half the time when I put it back together, it seems like it does not want to adjust the grind properly and I have to take it apart again and re-assemble. This has been going on pretty much ever since I've had this grinder and I've just learned to live with it. I do clean it periodically obviously, but this seems to happen more quickly that I feel it should.

The impetus for looking at replacing it now is that I see it has been discontinued a while ago and I am having trouble sourcing parts. Their customer service seems to have gone down hill as well, as I messaged them over the weekend and still have not received a response to my parts question. I remember working with them in the past and having a much better experience.

I am wondering though, are these issues I am describing typical of most grinders or grinders of a specific type or segment, or can I expect a better experience if I replace this grinder with something different?

I am thinking for my use case a single dose grinder is maybe not needed (I pretty much always pull 2 double shots everytime I make coffee) but maybe I can / should be convinced otherwise? From my research on here, it seems that a good option might be the Eureka Mignon Crono with the espresso burrs. Would that grinder be better with the issues I described?

Thanks, I appreciate any help with this!",1,1768401595.0,espresso,2,1.0,False

1qcouwn,https://www.reddit.com/r/MakeNewFriendsHere/comments/1qcouwn/35m_im_so_tired_of_being_alone_and_empty/,35M I'm so tired of being alone and empty,"Hi all. I'm a mix of sarcastic banter, softness and gentleness, steadiness, nerdy shit and the kind of conversations that leave you gasping for air from laughing and nonsense. I love people and conversations and good company. 

My friends call me a Bard because I am always looking to uplift others. I call myself a Hobbit cuz I like to eat about 14 times a day and I am a short chubby cutie pie. I've told I'm a model for how to practice radical compassion. 

I have many passions and interests and frankly I have no idea how to half ass anything. I either do it or I don't. I love Space and Sci-Fi and Star Trek. I love to play Warhammer 40K and I DM/GM for TTRPGs. I am in the midst of creating a new Sci-Fi world of my own for games. Pokemon is something I enjoy as well and I am always down for coffee, tea and gossip. 

I am person of wild abandon, deep passions and much curiosity. I love to learn, I try to leave people and places better than I found them and I thrive on connection and joy. 

But the last few weeks have seen me....eating myself alive. I cannot get out of my head. My life is so empty. I work and come home and that's it. I want to adopt a dog but I can't afford to. I need...something. Anything or anyone to help me snap out of this waking coma. I am always pouring into others...I just need someone to pour into me. 

I know a little about a lot and I love to be info dumped. Talk to me. Tell me about yourself, or your special interest or your trauma. Tell me which carb you would pick if you could only eat one for the rest of your life. Tell me your favorite thing about yourself. Anything, everything. I'm here.

For many open wheel fans and drivers, 61\* might just be the new 33. What was once seen a few years ago as a noteworthy mark in the resurgence of the Rolex 24 at Daytona has now become an annual expectation, the perfect size of a grid which so many hypercar, prototype, and GT teams long to find themselves in at the end of January. And while many of our open wheel stars and alumni may not have to worry about being bumped off of this grid, it’s still just as impressive a feat to go the distance and be on a team in the running to claim a Rolex as it is to drink milk on Memorial Day weekend.

(\*Aside from one late withdrawal which struck former ChampCar driver Tonis Kasemets from the list, but 60 is still a great field size nonetheless.)

It’s always an exciting part of the IndyCar offseason to run down the list of those that American open wheel fans may pay a little extra attention to over the course of this grand race. When all it takes is at least one start in a past or present top tier of open wheel racing to see how this web of drivers are all connected, the pool becomes quite deep and friendly to choose from, so there’s no shortage of notoriety.

So what were many of our favorite drivers doing during the 2025 IMSA calendar? You may recall Tom Blomqvist and Colin Braun finishing second at Daytona in the GTP class with Scott Dixon, Felix Rosenqvist and Meyer Shank Racing, or the duo’s big win at Watkins Glen, and Alex Palou finally shook off his sports car demons with a podium at Sebring. Benjamin Pedersen snuck onto the LMP2 podium at Daytona, but Sebastien Bourdais upped that with second place at Sebring and Hunter McElrea’s cup of coffee in IndyCar was enough to warrant highlight winning at Indy and Petit Le Mans to end the season. Jack Hawksworth was a podium machine in the GTD class for Vasser Sullivan en route to fourth in the class standings, and Robert Wickens even made his presence known in the sprint races, including a fourth place finish in his hometown race at Mosport.

**The usual disclaimers!** 

As always, the maximum entry list for teams is dictated by the cars entered for the Roar Before the 24 test sessions in January. I do my best to continually read up on last minute changes which may necessitate this post to be edited, and to handle those edits as necessary. When all else is in doubt, consult any comments at the bottom of this post.

# Grand Touring Prototype (GTP) class

*Cadillac Wayne Taylor Racing*

40 - Colton Herta

One of the biggest IndyCar names to watch for in 2026 is one who *won’t* be racing full-time in the series (if at all!), as Colton Herta will be challenging the Formula 2 grid and serving as a test driver for Cadillac’s first year in Formula 1. But this jump comes with a great perk on the side as Herta gets set to run with their factory GTP program in Florida. Despite a surprising down year for the GM gang in IMSA last year, headed by only a trio of second place finishes (including one for the #40 at Watkins Glen), Herta comes in as a driver with a history of going big in this race, having won in both prototype and GT classes in the past, including one with the Taylor team in their Acura years. Looking at their loftiest season on the motorsports calendar in a very long time, many eyes will be on Cadillac to see if WTR sets them off on a dream start to 2026.

*BMW M Team WRT*

25 - Kevin Magnussen

While BMW has parted ways with the Rahal Letterman Lanigan fraternity in IMSA, there is still room in the GTP class for a pair of their hypercars courtesy of Belgium’s Team WRT. This is a team whose best success in prototype-bodied cars came in their LMP2 years, including a dominant class championship with three race wins in the 2023 WEC season at Spa, Fuji, and Bahrain. While they have yet to claim their first win after two seasons in the top class, each of those has included a runner up finish (Fuji 2024, Imola 2025). As luck would have it, BMW did score a GTP 1-2 in RLL’s final season at Road America, which of course was the setting for Magnussen’s sole IndyCar start, who likewise finished fourth with the team at Daytona last year as well. The pieces are there for a breakthrough, can they make it work?

*Acura Meyer Shank Racing with Curb-Agajanian*

60 - AJ Allmendinger / Tom Blomqvist / Colin Braun / Scott Dixon

93 - Alex Palou

We swap out Felix Rosenqvist for a guy who may need little more than a handshake to get behind the wheel of the 60, but otherwise we’re running it back, and why not? The Acura factory team is always an easy squad to set eyes on at Daytona with their colorful cars and bold driver lineups, and 2026 carries on that streak. Blomqvist and Braun return for another full-time season on the flagship 60 car with three podiums in the 2025 enduros (2nd at Daytona with Dixon, a win at Watkins Glen, and 3rd at Indianapolis) and third place in class in the Michelin Endurance Cup. Despite this being his first Rolex start since 2021, AJ Allmendinger needs little introduction to the team or IMSA’s faithful fans, as he was the man who drove them to Victory Lane back in 2012, as well as a GTD runner-up in 2018, and remains one of Shank’s best friends in his garage. Alex Palou can finally breathe a sigh of relief from the bad breaks which have suffered his sports car cameos, having picked up a podium at Sebring in the 93 car last year. This second car claimed a win of their own in the Detroit 100-minute dash, and third place at Road America. Now that Palou has paired his grip on the Astor Challenge Cup with a Borg-Warner Trophy, can he make it stylish with a Rolex on his wrist?

# Le Mans Prototype 2 (LMP2) class

*CrowdStrike Racing by APR*

04 - Toby Sowery

Okay, we all know there’s going to be jokes about the CrowdStrike car crashing and breaking down, and to be fair, 2025 was an inconsistent season for the team. Their only podium was a third place at Watkins Glen, but the team has seen prior wins in IMSA and close calls at Daytona as well with Sowery on hand. And perhaps there is a sign of a, ahem, reboot after a pair of third places in Sepang to open the latest Asian Le Mans Series season, a series where they do have a prior win in Abu Dhabi. Just keep pounding away at it and it’ll start working again!

*United Autosports USA*

2 - Ben Hanley / Hunter McElrea

United Autosports is another team with some head-scratching results looking to get both of their cars on the same level. Hanley and the 2 car languished midpack for much of the year, failing to score a single podium, but their team car, the 22, won at Daytona and Watkins Glen while scoring a further podium at Mosport (with Tom Blomqvist notably co-driving that car, as GTPs were not running that race) and taking third place in the LMP2 Endurance Cup standings. The European Le Mans results were even more flustering, with a best finish of sixth at Catalunya to open the season. McElrea meanwhile shined in his stint with fellow LMP2 team TDS Motorsports, which included wins at Indy and Petit Le Mans to cap off their season with Endurance Cup gold and second in LMP2 owner’s points to boot. This could be a great chance for the team to climb back to the top.

*Tower Motorsports*

8 - Sebastien Bourdais / Kyffin Simpson

Tower Motorsports was another LMP2 team with a surprising down year in 2025, even with Bourdais’ contributions behind the wheel. It all seemed to start off in a frenzy, a win at Daytona shuttered by technical infractions before rallying back to finish second at Sebring…only to fall flat for the rest of the year with a best finish of seventh in the remaining five rounds. For a team that has seen plenty of glory in LMP2 before and a driver used to so many clutch wins in Indy cars and sports cars, surely there has to be a turnaround point. And maybe Simpson will help guide them back? While he has yet to run an IMSA race since finishing seventh in class at the 2024 Rolex, the islander had an affable breakthrough season in IndyCar, and his maturation as a driver could boost this team just as well.

*Era Motorsport*

18 - Jacob Abel

Jacob Abel looks to reset his young motorsports career after a season in IndyCar by moving over to a stalwart LMP2 team. Era Motorsport is most notable for open wheel fans as the longtime home for ChampCar alumnus Ryan Dalziel, and have spent the past several seasons as a solid midpack team at worst. While their best 2025 finish was a single third place at Road Atlanta, they never finished worse than seventh out of eleven when they went the distance, and their four prior seasons have all seen multiple podiums, including a Florida sweep in 2024 and a second Daytona win further back in 2021. It’s a solid ground for Abel to land on for sure.

*Inter Europol Competition*

343 - Nolan Siegel

Inter Europol can stand pretty tall looking into 2026 with their success in recent years, but some might say they need just a little bit more. Not necessarily because they brought on Nolan Siegel, but for the team’s incredible rate of second place finishes across the 2025 IMSA and European Le Mans Series schedules (eight out of 13 combined races), leading to third in IMSA points and second in the Michelin Endurance Cup and ELMS standings. Fortunately, with all those close calls they did power through with wins in two of the biggest races of the year–Sebring and Le Mans. 

*Pratt Miller Motorsports*

73 - Pietro Fittipaldi

PMM and Fittipaldi are another pairing that didn’t quite have what it took in 2025, but keeping in mind it was the team’s first season in LMP2, it may have just been growing pains for the established Corvette showrunners. The team’s best finish was sixth place (out of eleven) in Mosport, however they only had one retirement in Sebring as well. Not that Fittipaldi hasn’t had a chance to shine either–he has had a prior fourth place finish in the LMP2 class before, so there’s still a chance to set things right in 2026.

*AO Racing*

99 - Christian Rasmussen

Speaking of LMP2 teams who set things right in their second year on the grid, the sophomore season for Spike was a (literal) sweeping success on both sides of the pond, claiming class titles in both IMSA and ELMS. While the team only had one podium in the IMSA enduros (second at Watkins Glen), their five-for-six podium rate in the European four hours have given them plenty to strive for in the middle-length races, and on top of that, they got their first LMP2 pro-am win at Le Mans (third among all LMP2 entries). 2025 may have been the year of the snake, and 2026 the horse, but this dragon may disagree with both of those…

# GT Daytona Pro (GTDP/GTD Pro) class

*Pfaff Motorsports*

9 - James Hinchcliffe

The good news: Pfaff Motorsports is *not* changing manufacturers again ahead of the 2026 season. The bad news: the jump from McLaren to Lamborghini was not an instant fix for the Canadians in the 2025 season. In fact, the team’s results receded from seventh to ninth in owner’s points, with only one podium (third in Detroit) to the previous year’s pair of second place finishes, and a best enduro finish of ninth and three retirements. Still though, the team remains one of the charmers of the grid, especially with a driver like Hinchcliffe alongside them, so you know if they have a chance to run well (few will forget their epic duel to the win in 2022), they’ll have a lot of fun doing so.

*Vasser Sullivan Racing*

14 - Jack Hawksworth / Kyle Kirkwood

As usual, Vasser Sullivan Racing will run both an all-pro car and a pro-am car for the 2026 season (with a little driver/number shifting for the two street race sprints), so we’ll start off by reviewing the GTD Pro car. Unfortunately a blast from the past in calling Townsend Bell in for the Rolex did not spark a climb or even a sustenance of the 14 team’s 2024 form, as they languished to only two top fives and no podiums in the 2025 season (fourth in Detroit, fifth in Indy). Notably though, that fourth place finish came with Hawksworth as one of its drivers (whereas he had otherwise spent 2025 in the pro-am car) as Detroit was contested with only the all-pro teams in its GTD contingency. More to come on Hawksworth’s time in the 12 car in the GTD section, but keep in mind he was full time in the 14 car in 2024 when it claimed its most recent win, at Sebring, and with Kirkwood no less. The team’s best finish in 2025 with Kirkwood as a co-driver was sixth at Road Atlanta.

*RLL Team McLaren*

59 - Juri Vips

Rahal Letterman Lanigan have parted ways with BMW, but there’s still a spot for them on the grid with McLaren, in what might be a mild surprise for the two factions otherwise split by manufacturer on the IndyCar side. As a manufacturer, McLaren sat out the IMSA calendar in 2025, but they did claim four podiums across the IMSA GTD classes in 2024, including second place at Watkins Glen in the all-pro class, and also finished sixth overall last year in the Spa 24 Hour. In addition, United Autosport took two GT podiums for McLaren in the 2025 WEC season (winning at Circuit of the Americas and second in Qatar). Vips himself is a bit of a wildcard on account of not having much sports car experience, but having held ties with the RLL system before, we’ll see what happens once they take the track.

*75 Express*

75 - Will Power

Panorama’s pride and joy is ready to settle some unfinished business with the Toowoomba thriller. Forced to sit out a run at the Daytona/Bathurst double in 2023 with Kenny Habul’s team to tend to family concerns, Will Power is at long last back on the roster with the sunny Mercedes squad in 2026. While IMSA hasn’t been very kind to the team in recent years in either of the GTD classes (their most recent finish of note being seventh in GTDP at Indy in 2024), the team has remained a constant threat in their literal front yard, claiming overall podiums in each of the last four Bathurst 12 Hours including wins in 2022 and 2023. Power did get some prep with the team late last year, running the Intercontinental GT Challenge race at Indianapolis with a sixth place overall finish. While Habul has yet to confirm his co-drivers for this year’s 12 Hour, don’t be surprised if he considers a fourth seat for Power on the Mountain, and definitely don’t be surprised if the countrymen get the spark they need to conquer all 36 hours of this epic stretch.

# GT Daytona (GTD) class

*Vasser Sullivan Racing*

12 - Benjamin Pedersen

Vasser Sullivan’s GTD car had a winless but formidable campaign in 2025, bolstered with Jack Hawksworth as a regular driver in the car. Securing five podiums including four in the five race span between Sebring and Mosport, the 12 team certainly upheld their standard of excellence that Jimmy and James have come to provide to the deep class as they finished third in class owner’s points and fourth in the GTD Endurance Cup standings. Pedersen comes into the team after running in LMP2 for PR1/Mathiasen Racing throughout the previous season. While an unspectacular year, Pedersen claimed a third place finish at Daytona and fourth at Petit Le Mans in what has now become a very steady LMP2 class (every race having at least 12 entries), so we’ll see what happens once he jumps to a GTD ride. *(Note: to perhaps the disappointment of some, Kyle Kirkwood is* ***not*** *listed to split time in both Vasser Sullivan cars this year…)*

*Myers Riley Motorsport*

16 - Romain Grosjean

With Grosjean’s 2026 IndyCar fate not yet formally settled, fans of the Phoenix can still look forward to a run at Daytona with Bill Riley’s latest sports car project: a Mustang GTD team. It’s a curious jump for both driver and owner, having both run in various aspects of the prototype classes in 2025. Grosjean ran the endurance races with Lamborghini’s now-shuttered hypercar team, nearly stealing the win at Road Atlanta on an aggressive fuel save strategy before ultimately settling for a valiant fourth place finish in their swan song, while Riley headed an LMP2 team to fifth in class owner’s points, including a runner up at Daytona and third place at Indianapolis. As a manufacturer, Ford had an excellent 2025 in GTD Pro with wins at Daytona, Detroit, and Indy en route to third in manufacturer points, but was a distant last in pro-am ranks with a best GTD finish of fifth at Virginia International Raceway.

*RS1 (RennSport1)*

18 - Jan Heylen

Ever the team player for Porsche, Jan Heylen steps back into a full-time GTD spot for 2026 after claiming his second Grand Sport class championship in the Michelin Pilot Challenge; this time he brings RennSport1 along into the main event. Second place finishes at Daytona and Sebring to start the season were fortified by wins at Laguna Seca, Watkins Glen, and VIR to back up his 2021 title. Heylen is of course no stranger to the top series either, having run in various capacities in the years between the two MPC titles. His most successful season was in 2022, claiming wins at Daytona and Laguna Seca with Wright Motorsports en route to second place in GTD points, and his most recent class win was at Indianapolis in 2024.

*DXDT Racing*

36 - Scott McLaughlin

A second year Corvette GTD team brings in a popular face for their Daytona program, with Scott McLaughlin taking a seat held by Robert Wickens for about half of the previous season. Wickens’ status with the team for 2026 is yet to be determined as he only ran the sprint races with the team, still sorting out the logistics of his physical limitations, but among those five starts came a very bright fourth place finish at his home race in Mosport, while the team’s best finish in an endurance race was seventh at Petit Le Mans. Meanwhile, McLaughlin has run the Daytona 24 in a variety of cars and classes, most recently for Trackhouse’s one-off GTDP ride in 2025 which resulted in a ninth place finish. Before then though, he’s finished fifth for Tower Motorsports in LMP2 in 2024, won with Tower at Sebring in 2023, and finished fifth in the GT3 pro-am class at the 2018 Bathurst 12 Hour.

*Wayne Taylor Racing*

45 - Marcus Ericsson

Once again, Wayne Taylor covers a spot in the GTD class alongside their signature GTP team and brings with them an Indy driver with fellow top class experience into the 45 car. Marcus Ericsson has sporadic experience at Daytona both with Wayne Taylor’s team and the factory Cadillac squad formerly tied to Chip Ganassi, and while the results haven’t been eye-popping (a best finish of sixth in 2022), Ericsson does provide a team like WTR a driver they can use to keep a clean bill as they continue to tread the deep waters of the GTD class. While the Lamborghini squad managed to pick up their first win at Mosport last year, they only managed one top five finish in the remaining sprint races at Road America and a best enduro finish of tenth at Daytona. Still though, if there’s any ownership which can elevate a growing team, Wayne Taylor can certainly lead the way with a strong start to 2026.

*Wright Motorsports*

120 - Callum Ilott

Wright Motorsports has been riding a wave of momentum in recent years in GTD, climbing to fifth in owner’s points after falling to tenth in 2024 (albeit after missing the Mosport round which could have easily placed them as high as sixth) and eighth in ‘23. While the team was winless in 2025, the team captured second place finishes at Daytona and Indy, and only finished below seventh twice with no retirements on their off days. This is a team which has seen big results in big races (as seen in Jan Heylen’s wins) and Ilott has been no slouch in sports car racing himself in a mix of prototype and GT3 teams. In 2021, Ilott finished third at Le Mans with Iron Lynx and also claiming fourth with the team at Monza and Paul Ricard before going on to earn two podiums (including a win at Spa) with hypercar’s Hertz Team Jota in the 2024 WEC season. His first appearance in the Rolex was a ninth place finish with Pratt Miller’s LMP2 team in 2025.

Kramer enters an RC helicopter war with Newman. Jerrys date changes clothes 5x a day. Elaine's friend has both baby shower, engagement + wedding registry","""George"" is used as the bad example in all of HR's documents and presentations. He is used as an example of someone who:

Follows ""Amelia"" (shared name with a real coworker) and constantly leers at her & gives lewd comments

Steals coffee creamer to take home

Naps at his desk

Uses a racist term to describe a customer 

His coworkers all seem to think that he actually did these and they're real life examples. He finds himself being edged out of lunches and break room chait.

He approaches Amelia & asks her to set the record straight with coworkers. Shes busy handling a crisis on a phone call. He keeps asking her and she loudly says ""leave me alone"" as several coworkers walk by.

He goes to HR and asks them to change the presentation. They say everyone knows its all hypothetical. 

He keeps bugging them. 

The next presentation is escalated even more. Now ""George"" is defrauding the company, not flushing toilets, and stalking Amelia. 

Kramer goes to a hobby store and buys and RC helicopter. He installs a basket, walkie talkie, and camera on it. He initially uses it for all sorts of tasks like getting food from Jerrys home (he radios at the door, Jerry opens it, Kramer then asks Jerry to make a sandwich and place it in the basket. Jerry can see Kramer through their open doors and he's just sitting on the couch monitoring the camera). 

Kramer flies it everywhere he goes. Newman is jealous and wants to try to use it to spy on an attractive woman. Kramer refuses and Newman buys one of his own (expensive) and starts harassing Kramers RC helicopter. 

They have some weak ""battles"" & determine the best thing is to enter an RC battle in the park and the loser returns their helicopter.

Jerry dates a woman who always changes outfits for no reason. 

She'll go to the bathroom during dinner & come back in a new sweater. He sees her in the morning for coffee then at lunch she's in a different outfit. 

""She changes more often than Mr. Roger's!""

Meanwhile Elaine has an old friend from college reach out. She advises she's engaged and pregnant and is moving to New York. She invites Elaine to a baby shower...then an engagement shower...and the wedding. Elaine realizes all 3 have gift expectations 

""I haven't talked to this woman in 6 years. Now I'm expected to spend hundreds of dollars on her and her fiance I've never even met? And a baby?""

Stories intertwine when Jerry confronts his GF. 

After many talks she says she liked to be prepared and have options. But since she loves him and it bothers Jerrybshe agrees to go out for dinner and not bring anything but theclothes on her back. 

Kramer & Newman's battle, complete with personalized, crazy upgrades like projectile launchers, nets, etc, leaves the park. 

Theyre battling jn the streets of NYC when it abruptly ends with a pigeon flying into Kramer's helicopter rotors. Its pulverized...and its remains are all over Jerrys GF.

He smiles weakly at her and shrugs. ",12,1768401068.0,RedditWritesSeinfeld,0,1.0,False

Hear me out.,"I’m going to attempt to just get my thought translated to this post. My goal is to open a business that is designed to help to struggling middle class. The idea first came when I noticed that my home insurance policy tripled in price over 2  years. I thought to myself, “What if I could sell home insurance for MUCH cheaper than anyone else? How many people would come flooding?” While o don’t understand the insurance game to just jump right in, I figured that there’d be no way for a middle class individual like myself to get a financial backing to make that a reality. I then started thinking smaller and kept coming back to food. After doing just a splash of research, I started to think even smaller. The next idea was to sell party treats like cookies and cake pops at a very low cost. This idea would allow us to start very small using the Cottage Law to sell these from home without needing to rent space and other costs that come with a business. Then of course thought this was too small and was thinking about opening a coffee shop since we’re located close to a big University with lots of foot and commuting traffic. I feel like I’m straying away from the original plan and just trying to find something they would be profitable. Which leads me to why I’m posting this here. I wanted to ask the people of Reddit their thoughts on the idea as a whole. Is insurance too big of a jump for a first business idea? What comes to mind for me is something like the Banana Ball league. They don’t raise prices, they pay for shipping and taxes on merchandise to keep fan gear cheap, and they pay their players very nicely. Or think Costco without the membership cost. Besides healthcare/insurance, what are things that everyone needs but not everyone can afford, while at the same time, is possible for a driven hopeful like myself?

What wood stove would you guys recommend? Unfortunately my model as discontinued due to EPA regulations.. or I'd simply get another one.

I would like an efficient stove that throws at least 45,000 BTU or more. And no pellet stoves.. the power goes out too much. As such, I'd like to be able to do some 'cooking' on it. Make coffee, heat some soup.. even more is great but that's a minimum.

I tried to go to work (5min walk) and there my coworkers told me how pale I looked. I felt very bad so I sat down on a couch at work and almost felt asleep while waiting for my husband to pick me up.

It sits behind a latch  
broken since November,  
letting in a draft  
of asphalt and skin.

A coffee stain:  
the year you stopped asking to exist

You stand  
while twenty years of salt  
dries to a crust.

The tide is out,  
leaving bleached ribs in mud.

The chair knows your weight hasn't changed.

You sit on the edge  
and bite your cheek.

Knuckles waxy,  
fingers fused around a ghost.

The velvet  
is the only place  
you are allowed to be tired.

The radiator hits the pipes.  
A metallic click.

The sound of being six years old  
while the noises in the kitchen  
turned into a heavy, wet silence.

The threat is already wearing your watch.

There is a boy in the chair  
where you should have been.

A grape popsicle  
melts into the fabric.  
A purple stain.

He is the version of you  
that didn't make it out.

The floorboards are soft,  
rotting over a crawlspace.

If you stop moving,  
the wood gives way.

The chair is the only island left.

The barter is simple:  
the warmth for the seat.

An orphan  
robbing his own grave.

The pulse turns white.  
The marrow finishes your blood.

A wick  
watching the flame  
eat your life.

A battery  
in a dead remote,  
sinks into the velvet.

It held you  
without asking for a receipt.

The roar comes,  
then the quiet.

A charcoal frame  
scorched into the wood,  
the shadow  
of someone too afraid to be seen.

Gravity takes the rest.

The springs snap,  
rusted and tired.

The fabric is gone,  
leaving a wire skeleton.

Finally, you are light enough  
to be forgotten.

Finally,  
you are as empty as the chair.

My starting weight in December 15th was 180lbs, by January 10th, I was down to 162lbs, now on January 14th I’m apparently 179lbs according to the new scale I just got? I haven’t been eating any more per day on average compared to that period between December 15th and January 10th, I feel about the same, and my clothes fit the same, so how did I gain 17lbs in 5 days? 

I want to assume it’s an error with the scale, I bought a super cheap one (around $15) since that’s what I could afford, but I also know assuming an error with the scale is what let me get up to 180lbs without realizing either (I felt the same so assumed the 3lbs I was gaining per week on average was just the scale being weird). But I also don’t want to make myself spiral and unintentionally severely reduce calories like I did the other times I tried to diet whenever I ended up gaining weight.

1qcoidu,https://www.reddit.com/r/u_Books_Biceps/comments/1qcoidu/how_i_broke_free_from_tech_optimization_and_you/,How I Broke Free From Tech Optimization (And You Can Too!),"Let me tell you a story: For over fifteen years, I’ve started every single day the exact same way: walking my dog. It began in 2009 with our first Labrador, Mr. P, and it continues today with our current lab, Lyla. Different dogs, same routine. I wake up, get the kids ready for school, see them off, then grab a leash, grab the dog, and head out for a 20 to 30 minute walk around the neighborhood, usually about a mile and a half. 

I’ve done this walk in five different cities across two states, from the Intracoastal in Delray Beach to downtown Dallas fitness trails to quiet suburban ponds, and now back in Florida along various lake trails near my house.

I loved these walks because they’re simple and relaxing. I was outside, getting fresh air and sunshine, feeling my blood start moving and spending quiet time with my dog. There was no “goal”. No plan.  

My mind wandered wherever it wanted, and more often than not, that wandering produced story ideas, book concepts, chapter transitions, Manologue columns and creative solutions I didn’t even know I was looking for.

Then I screwed it all up.

It started with podcasts. Like many of you, I discovered there were more podcasts I wanted to listen to than hours in the day, and since I worked from home with no commute, I decided my morning walk would be the perfect time to catch up. At first, it seemed harmless enough. I put in my headphones, hit play, and walked as usual.

But something quietly disappeared. The good ideas that used to show up on those walks slowly vanished. My mind stopped drifting and started consuming. Instead of letting thoughts wander, I was processing information, absorbing advice, and filling every quiet moment with someone else’s voice.

From there, things escalated the way they always do when optimization enters the chat as my kids say. After listening to one pod I decided to start tracking my walks, so I got a WHOOP to monitor my heart rate and make sure I was hitting that super coveted Zone 2 cardio. 

But, WHOOP didn’t track my route, which meant I had to add the Nike app to log mileage, pace and time. I then listened to a guy share how a breathwork app was the perfect way to start his walk, so I figured I’d try that. Before long, I was monitoring my walk across my phone, a tech wearable, three apps and, yeah, still listening to a podcast.

Then the optimization fitness bros explained that walking was fine, but if I really wanted to level up, I should be rucking. So then I added a 20-pound vest, and my peaceful morning walk officially became an exercise in obsessive compulsive protocol.

What used to involve grabbing a leash and heading out the door turned into a full preflight checklist. Vest on. WHOOP charged. Nike app activated at the exact moment I stepped outside. Podcast queued. Phone synced. Headphones in. I had tech on my wrist, in my ears, and in my pocket, all in service of optimizing something that had never needed optimizing in the first place.

Soon, I stopped looking forward to my walks altogether. I wasn’t noticing the birds, the trees, or the water. I wasn’t talking to neighbors anymore. I wasn’t letting my mind wander. I was just another asshole marching around the neighborhood, locked into Zone 2, tracking distance in an app, listening to someone explain how to better optimize a cup of coffee with some bullshit new algae powder, all while wearing a weighted vest and looking like I was about to deploy overseas...
