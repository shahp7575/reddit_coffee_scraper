1g6ekq4,https://www.reddit.com/r/HomeKitchenTech/comments/1g6ekq4/anyone_else_obsessed_with_the_breville_barista/,Anyone else OBSESSED with the Breville Barista Express BES870XL? Here's why it's a game-changer for home espresso lovers ,"I have to share this because, as a coffee lover who’s *tried it all*, the Breville Barista Express BES870XL has completely changed the way I do coffee at home. And honestly... I’m never going back. If you're on the fence about getting this machine, let me tell you why it’s been worth every penny for me:

# 1. Full-On Coffee Shop Vibes—But At Home

First of all, I feel like a legit barista every morning. The integrated grinder means I get fresh coffee *every single time*, and adjusting the grind size gives me total control over how my espresso comes out. It’s fun to experiment with different beans and find my *perfect* shot. And let’s be honest, there's something so satisfying about pulling your own espresso—especially when that crema is on point! 

# 2. The Steam Wand = Latte Art Goals

Okay, who else got obsessed with latte art during lockdown?  The steam wand on the Barista Express is no joke. It’s powerful enough to create silky microfoam that takes your lattes to the next level. I’m not saying I’ve mastered hearts yet, but I’m getting closer with every cup, and I feel like a pro while doing it.

# 3. Built to LAST

The build quality is seriously impressive. This thing is a beast—solid stainless steel, and it feels like it could handle years of daily use. I’ve had mine for about 8 months now, and it’s still running as smooth as day one. Plus, it’s not as bulky as some of the other machines out there, so it doesn’t take over my counter space. Looks sleek too!

# 4. Save $$$ in the Long Run

If you’re someone who hits up a coffee shop every day (guilty ), this machine will literally pay for itself. I used to spend $4-$6 per drink multiple times a week, but now I can make café-quality drinks *at home* for a fraction of the price. It’s actually fun to try different beans and syrups to customize my drinks, and I can make a mean cappuccino whenever I want.

# 5. User-Friendly but Still Advanced

I know espresso machines can be intimidating, but this one strikes the perfect balance between beginner-friendly and advanced enough to grow with you. The pressure gauge helps you monitor the extraction process, and the PID temperature control makes sure the water is always at the optimal temp for pulling shots. Even if you're new to espresso, this machine gives you enough guidance to nail it without hand-holding too much.

# 6. Cleanup is a Breeze

Nobody talks about the cleanup side of espresso machines, but it’s important! I love how easy it is to maintain. The drip tray and water tank are removable, and the machine even has a hidden compartment for the included cleaning tools. With a bit of regular maintenance, this thing stays in perfect condition.

# TL;DR: If you’re serious about making great espresso at home, the Breville Barista Express BES870XL is worth the investment. Whether you're a beginner or a coffee nerd, this machine delivers café-quality coffee without the fuss (or the price tag) of more expensive machines. Totally recommend it!

He already can't wait to have kids, but due to my age, I don't wanna have them rn. In a way I know it's not fair to him, cz like, we agreed we'd have them after a year of being married,but I just couldn't bring myself to.

We also agreed that we'd live with his family after marriage,but his family doesn't get boundaries,and in a sense, he doesn't either. He won't take me out to dinner dates cz his mom 'F53' ,doesn't like it, and whenever we do go out, he always asks his mom to come along, even when I've made it very clear that I don't like it. It doesn't matter if we're going shopping or for a simple coffee, he always tells her where we're going,when we'll come back and insists she come along. He says it's good manners. But I think it's cz he knows if he doesn't,his mom will be in a bad mood. His mom doesn't like us going out.

He treats me nice ig. When his mom verbally abuses me, and she does that alot, he somewhat stands up for me. Not in a way I want him too,but he does it his way.

We're happy, we're in love, we're ready to compromise for each other. But staying with his family suffocates me. I'm not big on socializing and they keep invading my space and privacy. I can never do things my way. Can't even sleep or wake up when I want to. I have to continuously live on his moms terms. We both do. 

The burden of that is seeping into our relationship. He doesn't feel it, but whenever we fight, in a way or another, it's due to this growing frustration inside me. It's a resentment I don't understand. Do I have a problem with him or his mom? Is the question I ask myself.

Because unless we're fighting,he's an amazing men. But these days he's also been staying up and out with his parents regularly till 2-3 in the morning watching movies he's already seen,while I'm in our room alone, which I was not ok with, but he said I'm being controlling so I shut up.

But now I think of leaving him atleast once a week, even when everything is ok between us.

We both study so we don't have much time to meet each other than weekends, and her schedule is worse than mine, because her mom goes to work and gives her a ride to a coffee where she sits until its time for class since she is far.

Today was my off day and I told her that i'm gonna join you in the coffee to hang out for some time because she stays there for 2 hours before class, she always wakes up at 6 am and goes there at 7:30 am, i woke up at the same time, i joined her and paid for our breakfast together and we had a fun time, she drunk 2 cups of tea and i did the same, i wanted more and drunk the half cup left on the teapot, she wanted more tea but it was empty, she was silent and kinda annoyed but she ignored it and we continued chatting then went for a walk in the mall, then addressed that she focuses on the little details about everything, i ask how then she said that i didn't consider her wanting tea like i was selfish by drinking that half cup of tea left, i felt weird and remained silent but deep down i felt like i was unappreciated, like every effort she takes it for granted like i don't hear thank you or anything but when it's something small about a bigger gesture she ignores the whole gesture for that, and that happened alot before where i feel like im taken for granted and i'm doing what i'm supposed to do and don't get any reciprocation in this matter because im "" the man"", i drove her to her uni and went back home but she told me she felt the vibe was weird and she even cried and she said that we should talk about what happened.

So now i'm  confused, if this is the life that i want, being with someone who doesn't appreciate efforts but look only at the bad sides in her perspective.

Do I tell her how i felt? What would advise me to do guys?

I mean, she was literally copying and pasting each participant’s info manually, then scheduling meetings on a Notion Calendar, and after each interview, she’d save meeting links and notes on a separate Notion page. Yeah, it was as painful as it sounds.

Here’s what I did:

First, she was ONLY using Notion’s calendar (lol), so I built her a **Notion Database** based on the info she needed. Boom—problem already half-solved. She duplicated it into her workspace, and it’s all organized now—no more scattered info across multiple Notion pages.

Then, I added an **AI-powered clipper extension**. This extension links to her Notion database and grabs all the key info from participant chats automatically. Now, when she opens a chat with someone, the AI grabs the participant’s details and fills out the database for her. No more copying and pasting.

Bonus trick: The AI even handles timezone conversions, and if the meeting time changes mid-conversation (which happens all the time), it automatically adjusts the time.

Now all she has to do is glance at her Notion Database, and it’s got everything—participant details, meeting times (which are always correct, thanks AI), and interview notes all in one place. Her workflow is *so* much faster now that she can actually focus on the important things, like… perfecting her coffee breaks.",2,1729244372.0,Notion,0,0.75,False

I am thoroughly disgusted that even more people are more ignorant than I thought possible beyond my immediate family.

Right before the age of 40 I passed out waiting for a table at a nice restaurant, slowly drinking a beer. Luckily I had not been a heavy, medium, or even light drinker for almost 10 years.  All I really had physically wrong with me at that time was testosterone therapy, come shoulder surgeries, and chronic,sometimes horrible pain. Oh, I was also told I had a great, really great bronze California tan.

After that incident right before age 40 I had every test I could have done to explain what happened.  Witnesses said, im 6'3 195+ lbs, I just turned white, became instantly soaking  wet, and fell straight backwards like a 2x4.

After all the tests were completed I discovered my Iron(its really called ferratin) was at a level of 3,900 (normal safe levels are 50 to 200 roughly.  I was given a genetic test for hemachromatosis,  which is pretty common, and not a super big deal when treated early.  In fact, anyone with hemachromatosis cam firmly state that we people,all people, black, while, whatever are related.  Black people have a genetic disease called sickle cell disease.  If not treated and allowed to run rampart sickle cell turns into hemachromatosis. Nuff said.

The main treatment for hemachromatosis is bloodletting, the amount of blood you need to get out of your body and how much at a time and how often is usually dictated by the level of your ferritin in your blood at time of diagnosis.  Most people, fortunately,  get detected and treated by 700 to 1500 level of Ferratin.  The body is basically killing itself, ""rusting away"" to say at levels if 1,000 plus of ferritin.

Now five leads later, testosterone implants every 3 months or so, bloodletting (phlebotomy) treatment 4 times a year now ( I started giving over 550 grams of blood 2 times a week for 4 months, and then once a week 4 or 5 months, and so on and on.  I have had a pretty extensive cervical neck surgery, cages, holes drilled in arthritic areas and nerve openings opened up, both hips totally replaced, a knee replacement on left knee coming up soon, always a pain in my ass,, literally,, lol.  There's other things, I have to get liver biopsies every year, heart tests performed every year, no alcohol, low Vtamin C diet, no more liver and onions, and reduced use of cast iron and other high iron cooking and eating utensils.

Thing is,, if you see me just see me, you'll see a big, strong, agile, balanced man.  But what you dont see is how hard it is for me to just get up and drink a cup of coffee some mornings, or how bad both legs ache, hurt, throb, and sometimes especially feel totally exhausted 2 hours after I wake up.  Or a serious neck, nerve issue that I just keep massaging and turning my head.

I don't take opiates, except after surgeries, I can't take much Tylenol or ibuprofen and related.  Mostly ice pack/machine, heat pads, hot hot bath soaks, stretching (carefully), keeping moving, and pushing myself everyday or at least 6 days a week harder than the day before.

I have half siblings, 17+ years older than me, with bone spurs, maybe knee replacement, obesity related issues, lack of movement/ exercise issues, and on and on.

I'd happily trade places with them, but keep my age, and very few people I imagine get what I'm about to say next . I decided after the first 6 months of diagnosis I was going to ""break and fall apart before I rusted and rotted away"".

Do you get that?  Understand ?  I am happy, no I get exited and thrilled inside when I see people with obvious issues, obesity, laziness, bad diet, drinking, etc struggle, not do, or unwilling to do things they should do, much less want to do to make this life more,, make this life better for themselves.  I say F' u all those ignorant dumb lazy scared people that say things, think things, act differently when they interact with you, not knowing you closely and really knowing you, when they see this person that looks, moves, and does lots of physical things better than they can,, and they think your faking or putting on or playing poor pity party me,,, no screw you guys,, try, literally walking 10,000 or more steps in my shoes each day and more, yet sometimes not able to even crawl or move for 2 or 3 hours after 4 or 5 or less some days just living life.

Anyone else have similar stories ? Or experiences?  I still can't get over the fact that had a been a normal,, or whatever you call a person who drinks a six pack a week, alcoholic drinker I would definitely for sure have had cirrhosis or liver cancer by now for sure and probably  be dead.  Anyway,, let me know thanks.

I was with a local guy and he showed me around the marketplace which was full of animals in cages and places selling coffee and spices. Towards the end of the dream I remember some sort of rebel group attacking the village and me and the local guy had to hide inside a barber's shop. 

Ethiopia is just the latest on the list of random places I've visited in dreams. Some of the others include Algeria, Somalia, Serbia, Slovakia, and Pakistan (twice). I have no connection to any of these places.

### Devotional: Treasures of the Heart – Finding Abundance in Generosity

**Scripture Reading:**

“For where your treasure is, there your heart will be also.” – Matthew 6:21 (NIV)

**Reflection:**

In a world that often prioritizes accumulation and self-interest, Jesus invites us to shift our focus. When He speaks of treasures, He’s not referring to material wealth or possessions, but to the intangible riches that fill our hearts when we engage in acts of generosity. Generosity creates a divine loop: the more we give, the richer our lives become, not just in terms of relationships but also in peace, joy, and fulfillment.

**Educational Insight:**

Generosity is a powerful antidote to the emptiness we sometimes feel in our fast-paced, consumer-driven lives. Research shows that acts of giving not only benefit the recipients but also foster emotional and physical well-being in the giver. Studies have demonstrated that people who regularly engage in acts of kindness experience lower levels of stress, increased happiness, and an overall sense of purpose.

When we think of treasures, our minds may drift to bank accounts or material goods. However, the Kingdom of God operates on different principles. The Bible repeatedly encourages us to invest in eternal treasures—love, kindness, service to others, and shared joy. These are the riches that cannot be stolen or lost.

**Encouragement:**

Consider the story of the boy with five loaves and two fish (John 6:1-14). In his seeming insignificance, he chose to share what little he had, and Jesus performed a miracle of feeding thousands. When we choose to give, we open ourselves to the miraculous work of God. Your small acts of kindness can create significant ripples of change.

What does it mean to live generously? It goes beyond financial contributions—it’s about giving your time, sharing your talents, offering your patience, and extending love to those around you. Each act doesn’t have to be monumental; even the smallest gestures can be profound. A kind word, a helping hand, or a smile can light up someone’s day and strengthen your own heart in the process.

**Prayer:**

Dear God, thank You for the abundant gifts You have given me—Your love, grace, and blessings. Help me to recognize the treasures in my life that can be shared with others. Teach me to be generous with my time, my resources, and my heart. May I seek opportunities to serve, so that I may reflect Your love and light into the world. Remind me that true abundance is found in what I give, not what I hold tightly. Let generosity shape my heart and lead me closer to You. Amen.

**Action Step:**

This week, intentionally look for one opportunity each day to practice generosity. It could be as simple as paying for someone’s coffee, volunteering your time to help a neighbor, or even writing a note of encouragement to a friend. Keep a journal of your experiences, and take note of how each act affects not only the recipients but also yourself. Journal your feelings and revelations to see how God works in and through you as you cultivate a generous heart.

**Closing Thought:**

Remember, treasures of the heart are not measured in size or quantity but in the love and intention behind them. Choose to invest in what truly counts, and watch as your heart expands to embrace the abundance of God’s grace.

* Ecommerce, this specific question is about driving traffic to our Shopify site
* Sports memorabilia/merchandise niche
* Iconic sporting moments designed into items for fans to relive (coasters, mugs, t-shirts, etc..)
* We've previously had an agency running ads but I've decided to take it over myself. So, I'm not expert.

**Specific Example - Question...**

* **Recently, a new ""hot/recent"" product/moment has been performing well** - [*NY Mets' HR coffee mug*](https://playbookproducts.com/collections/greatest-mets-plays/products/new-york-mets-greatest-plays-mug-he-did-it-2024)
* ROAS is strong so **I want to start pushing other products with the same play/design!!!** (T-shirt, coaster, for example)
   * I made new ""ads"" (other products) WITHIN the ad set... but no budget was allocated to them as Meta kept pushing all spend towards already well performing ad (mug)
* So... then do I duplicate the ad set to attempt to capitalize (and test) on other products?
* Audience Size is estimated 3mil-4mil people and I'm spending less than $50/day so I'm not very concerned about audience overlap (valid assumption???)

My idea is to duplicate the ad set (which features the mug product) and then swap out the image/link for the other products. Ideally to keep some of what it's learned about the target audience (ny mets fans) and just test the same ad but push these other products.

**Is this a good idea?** What consequences might I see by doing this?  
**Is it better to duplicate the ad set and make changes... or just create a new ad set within the same campaign from scratch?**

Most of the roasters on the Top 100 list have washed coffees mostly, and maybe 1 or 2 naturals, tried to like washed coffees but couldnt.

My preference leans more towards the fruity and acidic rather than the chocolaty and bitter coffees, I tend to avoid coffees that have caramel/choco notes, especially Brazilian beans.

Sandy Decides To Take A Different Approach To Sheila's training, Dao Coerces Sheila's Consent To Sex By Threatening To Make Her A Floormat Slave, Humiliating Coffee Pot Cleaning ","Sandy's Perspective 

""Hurry up, slave, finish your last lap, we've got a lot of ground to cover."" Nora, who'd been giggling at Dao whipping a hapless Slave Loser girl around the classroom, giggled even harder at my flat, dismissive tone towards our slave. Dao shouted ""You wasting our time, slave, hurry up!"" She whipped the practically naked gimp hooded girl, with her feet tied together even harder. Dao had showed us that the supple leather thongs they used to restrain slaves to chairs were also good as stand alone restraints. They were good for binding her feet together.

Sheila's turned her black hooded head, with her frilly maid cap, trying to catch my eyes. I did what I'd been doing since coming back from break, I made one second of eye contact, to show her gaze didn't bother me. Then I looked away as coldly and rudely as I could. I hadn't given her any encouragement or sisterly camaraderie, just cold flat orders. I didn't call her ""Sis"" or ""Sheila"" anymore, only slave. My cold  behavior seemed to hurt her more than Nora's mean big sister act and Dao's calculated cruelty. It hurt me twice as much. But I felt it might be better for her in the long run to get back into the bottom slave mentality, that everyone sees you as inferior.

I sighed and looked at her pop quiz I had written in her infraction book. 19 out of 20 questions right.
 She was being punished for the one question she got wrong. Knowledge wasn't a problem, I had to study twice as hard for a C when we were kids then she had to for an A in the same subject. She soaked up information like a sponge. Punishing her for a few wrong answers was the wrong tack. We were failing our slave. I was failing my sister.

So what was the problem we need to address in her education? Her attitude. She could be whipped and bullied into line, almost anyone could. But she was so stubborn that it made molding her emotional. She made me angry and frustrated. And she brought out the nasty joy Nora got in hazing older female authority figures, like she was getting back for being bullied the first eighteen years of her life. 

We just needed to get her to work with us. We were on the same team. It's just she wasn't in charge, and she'd gotten used to that. If she bucked us, she'd rebel against Mary. And Mary had little love for Sheila,  unlike us.

The thing is for two days, Mary and Sheila were better off if they realized they had to be on the same team. A certain amount of unfairness and scapegoating was accepted by and even amusing for dommes; when they put an Alpha Slave over a bottom slave. I shivered as I remembered my time under Julie. But Julie had to keep me on task and make sure my chores got done, or she was held to account. That meant if I was obedient, it limited how cruel she could be. (Which admittedly was still pretty cruel).

If Mary was so cruel to Sheila she couldn't complete any tasks or challenges, she'd fail her Alpha slave test. If Sheila was obedient and compliant, no matter what, there was a limit to how cruel and unfair Mary could be to her if she wanted to advance to Alpha slave. Pointlessly terrorizing her over information she already knew had limited utility. We had a short time to mentally condition her to be a model bottom for Mary to mold.

As the idea began to take shape, I'm sure it would work. But it would mean taking away the freedom we planned to grant her in the evening. But to be honest, the original plan was she'd apologize in a few hours and things would go back to normal. Well, as normal as things can be on the set of this show.

Sheila's laps were finished and she was hopped over  by Dao to stand in front of a grinning, leering Nora. Dao crouched down to untie her feet. When they were free Nora got up to glare in her slave's face. Most of the defiance in Sheila's eyes was replaced by anxiety. To her credit she didn't flinch or look scared. But the power exchange between her and Nora was wearing her down.

Nora grabbed her by the back of the neck and swung her around roughly shoving her down into her seat between us. She wordlessly started strapping her to the chair above and below her breasts with the supple leather straps. Dao eagerly crouched to bind her feet to her chair legs.

If we were going to give Sheila a crash course in being a perfect submissive, we better start ASAP. I signaled Stacy, who was scrolling on her phone, acting bored. ""Mistress Kealoha, may I have a word with you in the hallway, alone?"" The Island Girl looked up at me with a dazzling smile. ""Certainly, dear."" She got up and headed for the door. As I got up to follow her, Nora queried ""Mistress Sandy, do you want us to review the material with her?"" I turned to look at her, one hand on Sheila's shoulder while another held a tablet up to her latex hooded face.

I waved dismissively. ""Do what you want to with her until I get back."" Nora got a nasty predatory smile as she put down the tablet, then pointedly reached under Sheila's right breast to cup it, gently squeezing. As I headed to the door, Dao was headed to take my seat with a similar predatory leer at my pretty, helpless older sister. I felt a little uneasy, but dismissed it. They're just messing with her, I'm sure. Yes, that's what they're doing. I turned to present my ideas to a waiting Mistress Kealoha.

Nora's perspective 

I squeezed the firm bare breast of the lovely Sheila Connor, aka Slave Loser Girl, and felt myself getting wet between the thighs. Once again, a beautiful, confident, smart, older girl was all mine to control, teach, mentor and train, and I was loving it. Ever since I asserted the authority Mary gave me over Sarah, my love for Lesdom grew, even before I understood what was happening between the Asian Girl and I.

And then I got Mary as my slave, by then I loved Sarah too much to be really mean to her, so Mary was the perfect target for my growing talent for cruelty to other women. I just treated her like my mom and big sisters treated me, minus the restraints, gags and crops, of course. I sometimes felt guilty for how mean I was to poor Mary. But it was so much fun!

And now the lovely Sheila Connor, my hero and role model, was my toy, my little piece of clay to mold and shape. I liked being her strict, harsh mentoress and domme. I loved her almost as much as Sarah, and swore I'd never be as cruel to her as Mary.But it was hard resisting temptation when it's bare half breed ass was trussed up in front of me.

Of course, as I massaged and caressed the pretty half-Asian girls lovely right tit, it wasn't cruelty on my mind. Her wide gorgeous hazel eyes nervously staring at me were making me feel like a little impromptu girl  lovemaking session was in order. I guess I'd have to text Lara and Sarah, but with all the ""playing"" we did on our downtime in the Ready Room, I'm sure they wouldn't mind if I use little Miss Nguyen Connor to blow off some steam.

I'd never really understood the funny feelings had around girls, growing up. I grew from the phase of hating, to liking boys in adolescence. But when I hit puberty, I started to really like girls. The only way I learned about sex was the dirty whispering of my older sisters and the kids at school. And of course in my hick family and community, being gay was considered worse than bring a mass killer. So, I Nora Jameson, couldn't be gay, no way.

When Master Ken first signed me up for the Perseverance, and the material he gave me seemed to indicate a lot of lesbo themes, I told him no way was I doing anything with another girl, that was a hard limit.

In his usual affable way he said ""Shoot darling, I'll respect your hard limits. I known Dave a long time, he will too. But don't be so quick to think you know what does and doesn't turn you on at 19. You might be suprised.""

I told myself I'd run off the set before I so much as kissed another girl. The first day was so weird and sad, seeing how mean Mary was to poor Sarah. I felt like running away, anyway. But I thought at least I made a brand new friend in Sarah.

Then Mary put me in charge of Sarah. I was hesitant to exercise control of her at first. But once I started, it was hard to stop. I told myself she was a new submissive, and I was teaching her and training her like a good big sister would.

But then Dave and Mary revealed that my ""discipline"" turned her on. And I had to admit exerting my authority over her, turned me on, too. Then there was that time it seemed Mary was going to force us to have sex in the gym. Instead she got us to admit we both had sexual and romantic feelings for each other. She said both of us could come to her at anytime with questions about being a bisexual woman. That had to be difficult, considering her grudge against Sarah. I felt a pang of guilt, Mary wasn't as bad as I told her she was when I scolded her as my slave. 

So I admitted I loved Sarah in an erotic way. Then I started noticing I was surrounded by beautiful, shapely women. A smorgasboard. The buxom, delicious PAWG, Mary. Sheila's exotic blended Asian features and tight little mongrel butt. It seemed impossible at the time, but I started to daydream about one or both of them being given to me to train by Dave, like I was doing with Sarah.

Then Dave had it with Mary's ego causing friction. And dream come true, gave her to me to calibrate! I loved being her domme, though I later regretted being so mean to my former Alpha slave. 

Then we got Layla's big, beautiful Latina bootie. Then we essentially traded Mary for Constance. I never thought black women were that pretty growing up, no racism. But then the stunning ebony dominatrix turned sub totally changed my 
view on that. She was given to me to train, and I gifted her to Layla. The Latina was aching to train her first sub, plus she had real chemistry with the black girl. I was a rising star, and went from little Nora, to part of the triad of power with Sheila and Layla.

Then we got that ditzy bitch Lara back, with what seemed like a personality transplant. She was sweet as pumpkin pie most of the time, but tough as nails when she had to be. I saw that when she led us in rescuing Sheila from that whore Emily.

And afterwards Sheila started an affair with that hot little curry burner. With Lara as submissive to her by her own choice. And my speculations about Sheila being a switch hitter were confirmed. She had sexual tension with Lara before they got together, but I remember she had sexual tension with Ji and Dave too. I'd wondered if her trauma as Ari's slave prevented her from having a normal sexual relationship. Now that her and Lara were dyking it out, I knew she could.

Speaking of choice brought me back to the present. I'd been thinking what I wanted, and how now I could take it from Sheila with impunity. But I wasn't a rapist, and raping my wonderful mentoress and friend while she's under my power would be a shitty thing to do.

Then Mistress Dao slips into Sandy's chair to Sheila's left. She starts cupping and rubbing Shiela's breast on the left like I'm doing to her right one. Sheila turns to look at her, and Dao smiles a really..hungry....smile in Shiela's face. 

I feel a little jealous and protective at her so casually fondling  MY slave. But then she open her mouth and says ""Mistress Sandy, say we do anything we want to her, she very pretty, sexy slave, maybe we make her eat our pussies, or asses, Mistress Nora?""

It does sound hot when she puts it like that. I mean very hot. Sheila's masked face turns on me with pleading eyes. She seems a little taken aback as my smile must look almost as hungry and predatory as Dao. But she's my friend and mentor, practically a surrogate sister. I shake off my lascivious thoughts to try and protect her.

""Mistress Dao, we can't force a subbie to have sex against her will, both our outfit and yours have strict rules about taking a slave without the slave's explicit consent."" I took my right hand with off her breast and put my left one on her shoulder, giving her a reassuring squeeze. I'll protect you when you're helpless, boss bitch. Her beautiful brown eyes flooded with relief as she looked at me gratefully.

Dao laughed and said ""Of course she has to consent. And she will, but let me change the subject, tell the pretty slave what to expect tomorrow.""

Sheila's perspective 

I saw Nora's face look as confused as I felt. She then fixed me with a stern domme glare. ""Mistress Dao wants to talk to you, slave, look at her!"" I turned to that same frightening predator smile on the lovely Thai domme's face. She still casually fondled my left breast, now pinching my nipple, gently, then drawing her finger in circles around it.

""I your Alpha Slave's advisor tomorrow. One of my duties is to decide what trials and ordeals she puts you through. And more importantly for you what trials she doesn't put you through.""

""I give you example. One trial I like to have Alpha Slave trainees put bottom slaves through is floor mat in the domme's spa. You're strapped into a cubby under the floor, with just your face out, open mouth ring gagged. You lie under a domme's spa chair, while she get beauty treatments, massaged, pampered, while she rests her feet on your face. You have to lick her feet if she command you. Some dommes like to practice breath control with their feet on unfortunate floor mat slave.""

She shrugged in the face of what must be a horrified stare, her expression neutral. ""If you lucky, dommes just ignore you."" Then her big predatory smile came across her face again. ""But Alpha Slave Mary won't ignore you...she give her slave real special attention to help mentor her. She so excited to make you be floor mat slave in domme's spa. I tell her it my decision not hers. What decision would you like me to make, slave?""

Her meaning was so clear despite her roundabout way of going about it. Either I consented to sex or became the floor mat slave in Queen Of Mean's Domme Spa for an indeterminate time. Could I take it? If the dommes ignored me...as Ari's slave, it was easy to get used to being tied up and ignored, it beat being noticed. If I could escape that...


But with Mary as my Alpha Slave, I was sure to get extra special attention from her and her drawing domme's attention to me when I wished to be ignored.

I started to turn to look at Nora for support, forgetting we weren't equals for the moment. A hard slap to the back of my head reminded me ""You little dingbat! How dare you turn from a domme when she's talking to you. I trained you better than that, you're embarrassing me!  How rude!""

I turned back to the Thai Domme. She was cupping my left breast underneath, kneading it gently. With her other hand she held up her phone, clearly recording ""So Slave, back on topic, do you consent to do whatever sexual thing Mistress Nora and I order you to do?"" I searched her cold predators eyes for mercy and found none. I reluctantly mmmphed yes. 

She smiled lowered her phone and pocketed it, and patted my head. ""You are good little slave! I promise to think really hard about not making you floormat slave in domme's spa. Maybe I won't.""

She'd think really hard? Maybe she wouldn't? What? I was about to start mmmphing anginrly which would probably get my subbie butt creamed by the two dommes watching me. But I was so angry I didn't care.

Then the door banged open, and our heads turned to watch Sandy and Stacy storm back in. Sandy stormed back in and stood, hands on hips, glaring down at me strapped in my school desk, like I was a disgusting little worm.

""Okay, slave, a change to your mentorship plan. As your lead trainer, I've decided making you learn a bunch of stuff youl already know is pointless. We need to get you habituated to following orders without questions. You're good at that, I'll grant you. But your pissy little attitude keeps you from being perfect. We're going to spend the night on a series of tasks. We're going to get you as near perfect at obeying orders as we can. We're going to show our partners at QOM that we deliver only the finest raw material for their Alpha candidate to mold.""

After this tirade, she paused to take a breath, closed her eyes. When she opened them, she looked down at me with slightly less disgust. ""Slave, there's good news and their's bad news. The good news is your disciplinary board has been canceled and all your demerits voided. We simply don't have time for that anymore.""

The Asian Bob haircut girl paused a moment. ""The bad news is you won't be snuggling with your Desi lover until much later than you anticipated. Don't give me that fucking look! Nora, Stacy, Dao and I are going to be training your ass until way after sunset! Don't you think there's things we'd rather be doing than trying to mold your pathetic slave butt into barely acceptable clay for Alpha Mary to work with? This is your fault, slave!"" She brought her finger down in my desk for emphasis.

A deep breath and closed eyes again. ""Lara understands, and gives us broad lattitude to train you how we see fit. When we do finally deliver you to her, expect her to not be too happy with you...""

The one thing I was looking forward to before my ordeal as Mary's bottom slave trainee was one last night in Lara's arms.
Was I to be denied that, as well?

Sandy looked at me sadly now. She looked like she was fighting back tears. She mouthed ""Please forgive me for this, Sis.""
Then her face grew stern again.

""Mistress Kealoaha, what is the status of the coffeepot, I texted Lara to bring it down to Janice...."" Stacy looked up from her phone. ""She delivered it, Janice should be here in...."" a knock at the door, Stacy went and opened it, I could make out Janice on the other side handing her something. She turned around with My coffee pot! 

Now Sandy looked down at me with a mean little smile that made me remember that vicious eighteen year old domme at Ari's. ""Wanted to make sure Mistress Nora kept her promise to you to make you clean out your coffee pot in the most humiliating way possible.""

""See, fans liked that humiliation video you did to placate Ari into freeing me. A lot. They think Loser Girl's ass is hotter than ever, thanks to all the working out and unarmed combat training.""

""We're going to give them a treat. We're going to make you wear a gag with a scrub brush stick attached to it. You're going to wash out your pot, bent over, shaking your naked ass for the fans. If you don't shake it until they can't take it, Dao will motivate you with her cane. If you do a good job, it will just be Nora and I slapping your ass and making bitchy comments. It's going to be released as a gift to the paid subscribers to the Perseverance fan site.""

Sandy folded her arms and smirked down at me, while Nora giggled with delight. How can I be a slave again, this has to be a nightmare! But as my little sister smiles wickedly down on me, I'm not waking up...

1g6du2g,https://www.reddit.com/r/healthysupplement_/comments/1g6du2g/from_frustration_to_freedom_how_prodentim_changed/,From Frustration to Freedom: How ProDentim Changed My Life,"I never thought I’d be the type of person who got self-conscious about my teeth. Growing up in Austin, Texas, I had a bright, white smile that people complimented all the time. But as life happened—work stress, long nights, and admittedly more than a few skipped dentist appointments—my teeth began to lose their sparkle.

What started as minor discomfort turned into a bigger problem. By the time I hit 35, my gums were sensitive, my breath wasn’t exactly fresh, and I felt embarrassed to smile in pictures. I even began noticing friends subtly offering me gum or mints during our get-togethers. But the moment that hit hardest was at my friend Dave’s wedding.

It was a perfect sunny day, the kind of day you look forward to celebrating with friends. We were all gathered for photos when the photographer told me, in front of everyone, “Could you tone down your smile a bit? Your teeth are reflecting too much light.”

That hurt. And it wasn’t just the embarrassment of that moment—it was the fact that I had already been feeling uncomfortable about my dental health for a while. That comment was just the tipping point.

**The Search for a Solution**

I had tried everything at this point—new toothpaste, extra flossing, even some fancy mouthwash the dentist recommended—but nothing really made a difference. My teeth still felt sensitive, my gums ached, and my breath seemed impossible to manage. One night, while lying awake scrolling through my phone, I stumbled across something different: a supplement called ProDentim.

I’ll admit, I was skeptical. A probiotic for oral health? That sounded like one of those things you see in late-night infomercials. But what really caught my attention were the reviews—real people talking about how it had helped them with everything from bad breath to gum health. One story, in particular, stood out: a woman from Ohio, Karen, who said ProDentim had completely transformed her dental health after years of struggling with gum infections. Her dentist was even surprised by the changes.

After reading countless reviews, I figured, what’s the harm in trying? I ordered a bottle, hoping that maybe, just maybe, this could help me out of my dental rut.

**The Unexpected Transformation**

The first couple of weeks, I didn’t notice much. I took my ProDentim tablet every morning, right after my coffee, but I wasn’t expecting a miracle overnight. However, after about three weeks, something started to change. For the first time in years, my gums weren’t screaming in pain when I brushed my teeth. I could even drink cold water without wincing. That was the first win.

[ProDentim](https://preview.redd.it/d8f6oslv3hvd1.png?width=1080&format=png&auto=webp&s=184edd05359f4317649f5f803febe2b738bad8ec)

But the real game-changer was when my best friend, Sarah, casually mentioned, “You’ve been smiling more lately. What’s going on? New toothpaste or something?” That’s when I realized—I had been smiling more, and for once, I wasn’t worried about how my breath smelled or if my teeth looked dull.

By the time I hit the three-month mark, I felt like a new person. My gums were healthier, my breath was fresher, and my teeth—though not movie-star white—looked cleaner and brighter than they had in years. The best part? My confidence was back. I wasn’t hiding behind my hand when I laughed or dreading pictures with friends. It felt like a burden had been lifted.

**A Dentist’s Surprising Approval**

I hadn’t told my dentist about ProDentim yet, mostly because I wanted to see how much it could actually change things. At my next checkup, she was shocked. My gums, which had been receding for years, looked healthier. My plaque levels were down, and for the first time in a long time, I didn’t need any fillings. When I finally told her about ProDentim, she wasn’t surprised. “I’ve had a few patients mention it, and I’ve seen good results,” she said. “It’s not a replacement for regular care, but it’s definitely helping people.”

Hearing that from a professional made me feel even better about my decision.

**Why ProDentim Works**

I’m no scientist, but from what I’ve learned, ProDentim is all about balancing the good bacteria in your mouth. You’d think brushing and flossing would be enough, but the bacteria in our mouths play a bigger role than we realize. ProDentim uses probiotics to help fight off the bad bacteria and keep things balanced. It’s like giving your mouth the same care you’d give your gut.

The probiotics—like Lactobacillus paracasei for gum health and B.lactis BL-04, which supports the respiratory tract and immunity—help your body naturally keep your oral health in check. Plus, it has some natural ingredients that just make sense for maintaining a healthy mouth.

**Sharing My Story**

It’s funny to think that something as small as a probiotic supplement could change the way I see myself, but it has. Before ProDentim, I was hiding my smile in photos, covering my mouth when I talked, and feeling generally self-conscious about something as basic as my breath. Now? I feel like myself again.

I’m not here to sell anyone on anything, but if you’ve been struggling like I was—whether it’s with sensitive gums, bad breath, or just feeling insecure about your smile—ProDentim is worth a try. It’s not a quick fix, but over time, it made a real difference for me. And who knows? It might just do the same for you.

**I never thought I’d be the person recommending a dental health product to my friends, but after everything ProDentim has done for me, I’ve started sharing my story. So if you’re reading this and feeling like your dental issues are running your life, I hope my story gives you a little bit of hope. Sometimes, it’s the small changes that lead to the biggest transformations.

1g6dtfl,https://www.reddit.com/r/nichezero/comments/1g6dtfl/first_taste_compared_to_the_breville_smart/,First taste compared to the Breville Smart Grinder Pro,"My Niche Zero arrived a few minutes ago!

I’m coming from a Breville Dual Boiler and Smart Grinder Pro (the Dynamic Duo I’ve been using for nearly a decade!) and I drink locally made fresh (few week old) roasts on the medium/dark side in cappuccinos. 

It was hard to pick the Niche as an upgrade because in Australia the VS3 and DF54 are half the price of importing it. People say flat burrs make coffee taste better, but that the Niche is better on medium/dark roasts 🤷‍♂️ Meanwhile on each video I felt the workflow and noise of the Niche was better, and I read customer support is really superior, so I spent the money. 

I have now made exactly one coffee and here are my results. I know, this is not a shit post, but it is fun. 

a) It took to my third try to dial in the grind; starting at 19, going to 22, and settling on 25. The first two were too slow (40s and only a few grams out, so I dumped them), the final one was 40g out in 27s which is extremely fast for the BDB because usually the infusion is 7-10s before coffee starts to drip and so there’s not much time. USUALLY if it does go this fast it means I’ve ground too coarse and it’s ruined but…

b) I use a naked portafilter. I know this comes down a lot to viscosity of the beans and roast but this was the best looking pouring shot I’ve ever made. Like, for real, I’ve had a lot of this bean in the past few days and of course years of other beans but man this LOOKED perfect. The streams, evenness, and the way they all came together. On my third try!

c) Comparing to my SGP the adjustment for that was 3 (choked) 5 (choked) 7 (okay). But I felt that the adjustment of the Niche has a bit wider range of control, there’s quite a bit of turning between each notch there compared to the chunky movement of the SGP. I feel it’s better to dial in the Niche. 

d) Taste. It was less bitter than the SGP. The tasting notes from the coffee were dark chocolate, molasses, and brown sugar. From the SGP you just taste coffee. From the Niche I can at least taste the dark chocolate. For me that’s an upgrade. I let my wife taste it and she said this coffee now has a more complex flavour compared to the SGP. 

I think the only other thing I’d mention is that the grinds do seem to clump and get caught up in the catch cup, needing some banging to get it out. Also I have to flick the switch on and off once or twice to get out any extra grinds that have been retained. 

So yes it’s early minutes into the process but I wanted to share those first impressions before they’re forgotten, so far so good!",1,1729242761.0,nichezero,0,1.0,False

So lately, I feel like I really need a vacation. So baaaaad that I have been dreaming about it. I wanted to go with my friends tani sa November around end of the month for foodtrip and lagaw lagaw sa MNL but maybe it wasn’t meant for me kay ang mga upod ko na iban sa office mapa Cagayan man so wala may mabilin sa office.
So since indi ko kaupod saila, I thought na maybe it’s time for me to try to go on a vacation alone. Solo lang mag explore somewhere far from home but near enough ah, since first trip ko ni nga for leisure, not for work.

I’D LIKE TO ASK FOR YOUR SUGGESTIONS WHERE I COULD POSSIBLY GO?
Ideally, I’d want to go somewhere where there’s 
1.) GOOD COFFEE, non-negotiable.
2.) May network service na available since basi need ko mag answer calls and messages from the office, and to assure my mom I’m alive, alert, awake, enthusiastic. 😑😂
3.) May good food. Of course.
4.) Places with old homes like Silay City is also ideal. I love some good architecture with rich history as well.
5.) Near the beach, or river, or somewhere on top of a mountain but with a pool. I love dipping in water whenever I feel down, it helps me relax, indi ko sure kung ngaa pero since gamay ko mas naga kalma ako if maka paligo or maka dip ko sa pool.
6.) Extreme sports may be available, I may not look like it, but I’m an adrenaline junkie. Bungee-jumping, ziplines, and airsoft are definitely on my bucketlist. 
7.) Solo traveler friendly. I have no qualms meeting other people, basta mabuot and indi lang bastos batasan kag wala gapamilit sang ila gusto once I firmly decline with their proposition.

So yun, I know this is a lengthy read, but I hope you could help your girl out. Badly needed nagid. Hehehehe!",1,1729242601.0,Iloilo,0,1.0,False

all this time i was constantly trying to find something that i can replace antidepressants with - i've tried massive amounts of herbal remedies, mostly adaptogens like ginseng, cordyceps, schisandra, reishi etc. nothing helped quite well enough. CBT therapy helped, but it requires constant involvement and lots of money, can't afford it now. i do visit my psychologist when i can though.

i started abusing caffeine - coffee, puer tea, yerba mate etc. often times doing too much or brewing too strong, and then regret, cause it's not clear for me when is it ""not enough"" or ""too much"". i think i had one or two days when i actually got very hyped up from it - great mood, creativity, but that was probably an exception. since then i always hope for it to give me that ""mood boost"" but most times i end up being anxious and dysphoric, but i still keep taking it every week or so lol.

tired of these cycles of miserability. i started taking phenylpiracetam recently and i found it to be helpful for depression, but again, this feeling of ""not enough"" is so annoying, so i went for my old prescription of Cymbalta and took 1 pill. it was the one and only antidepressant that gave me relief to the point of hypomania, from many. this is my day 1 of taking it again after almost a 3-year old break. thank you for listening 🌸

ps. considering all risks, i might stop taking Cymbalta in a few days, idk. i feel unstable. at this point i don't know if my depression/anhedonia is a result of previous antidepressant intake or is it just me. ",1,1729242489.0,bipolar2,0,1.0,False

To live in a supportive egalitarian relationship of more than two. Where there is consensual, agreeable, mutual, love, friendship, intimacy, support, caring, compassion, and passion.

Where everyone helps each other be and become their best selves. Wrapped in joy and happiness, insulated from the madness of the outside world, yet helping each other venture out, survive, and succeed beyond the bounds of the sanctuary of the relationship.

Sharing fun and responsibilities. Bringing the resources and talents of each to the betterment of all.

It hardly feels like it should be radical, yet for many it is.

Only sugar consumption in my diet is in form of Tea or Coffee (1,2 teaspoon in a day).

So around 15 days back I decided to cut down sugar from tea / coffee also. I am on complete zero sugar. (I check ingredients on any packaged food also).

But since the day I went to zero sugar, I am always feeling sleepy in my work/office. No matter if I take 8 hrs or 9hrs sleep last night, during the day I can't open my eyes I can sleep  on chair. 

Is it common symptoms for sugar withdrawal or is it unrelated and my sleepiness is related to something else.?

I was wondering if I am missing some hidden gems that aren't always recommended. I really don't care too much about if it's just 1-sheet of paper games or even 540 cards. Let me know if you know something niche/special to you!

These are what I see to be the most popular and others should check out.

For focus on cards I really enjoy Button Shy Games collection, Magelite/Gloomholdin/Dragonstone and his other stuff, Grimm World's massive size, Iron Helm/Gates/Tin Realm from Grey Gnome Games, Quests Over Coffee, Galdor's Grip, Mini Rogue, Maquis, and One Deck Dungeon. (Most of these you can find on pnparcade or BGG and are almost all solo)

My favorites from ones that are single pages are Dangerous Space, Dungeon Pages, all of the Postmark Games lineup. (These ones offered a weekly subscription which I found super engaging for me and my students) The only other one I can think of right now is Knight/Space Alone from Radoslaw Ignatow and Utopia Engine.

I definitely am willing to try and print anything, no matter the size, as long as I think the art looks fun/pretty and I can get at least one fun experience from it.",2,1729240882.0,soloboardgaming,3,1.0,False

Most comments hadn’t tried, but a few asked me to share my experience if I managed to get some beans. 

A family member went to Vietnam this spring, and I asked them to find a coffee roaster (I’d found a few with good reviews on google in the area), and ask for their best and freshest robusta (which is used in Vietnamese coffee). 

I’ve now finished the bag I got, and I got to say, it was surprisingly good. I’m a light roast kind if guy, so it wont be my top pick at the darkness of what i got, but i was surprisingly fond of them. A good syrupy mouth feel, and the distinct sweet/bitter taste of robusta, combined with a tiny bit of sugar was my go to in the evenings. 

So, would I buy again? Absolutely! If I find a supplier of fresh robusta it’ll certainly go into my rotation as a way to spice up my light roasts.

1g6dcou,https://www.reddit.com/r/AITAH/comments/1g6dcou/aith_for_yelling_at_pregnant_sister_calling_out/,AITH for yelling at pregnant sister & calling out fake 'nesting' behavior 😡🤬,"Hey all, I'm from the UK and had been travelling for a couple years around the world. Japan, USA, SE asia, Australia and New Zealand. Pretty expensive to do but the MOST expensive was attending my twin sisters wedding in Bali when she got married. It was lovely but SO over our usual budget.

Flash forward 6 months and I'm going out of my way to return to the UK to see my twin sister and stay at theirs a few weeks. During this time she got pregnant and is now like 4-5 months pregnant and all I can say it... WOW THINGS WERE INTENSE!!

From the moment I landed I was in a storm of tension, arguments and battling over what I consider the smallest/dumbest s\*\*t ever. I'm talking yelling between sister & husband over shelves going up, walls not being painted in time, the type of crib they should buy, who isn't contributing enough etc. They both go tit for tat endlessly but I would say my sister is a bit worse. She calls it 'nesting'... which to my understand doesn't even happen for all women and only occurs at later stages of pregnancy. Where you are preparing your home for an upcoming child. It all just seemed a justification for her to be even more tyrannical about stuff around the house as she has always been such a perfectionist neat type.

Anyway... that's an issue between them I thought... best not get involved. What really kicked though is as soon as I landed. I was bombarded with demands. I had just got off a 47 hour flight journey, jet lagged as all hell. And within a few hours I was questioned over why my suitcase was still out and not packed away. Ok... whatever.

Then I'm demanded into the kitchen to help cook and clean. Not in a pleasant or fun way. Like a 'we are letting you stay here you better pull your weight kinda way'. Now I'm SUPER EXHAUSTED but then told, at 10PM at night, I need to help take EVERY single item out the loft to help clear space for future baby stuff. We are at this for hours. Lugging boxes, bags, cases, guitars, christmas decs, you name it. Covered in dust and so tired, I get down from loft and my sister practically shrieked at me 'THOSE NEED TO BE TAKEN DOWN TO THE KITCHEN!!'. Their house is 3 floors and I'm still panting from the loft. This is where I lose my first bit of patience, not in a big way, I just say ""ok I will, jesus just give me a sec to recalibrate here""

My sister responds along the lines of ""so your not going to help!? come on just do it and be supportive""

I get irrate and say ""I am being supportive but you need to start chilling out and asking nicely, this is WAY too much""

She hated that and held it against me. Days went on and I've been roped into every task imaginable. Moving wood piles, sheds, multiple 'deep cleans' of the house and even dissembling a wardrobe with a friend I asked over to help out. Mate came over and spent a good couple hours at this thing, I made him a coffee for his work, just to get nagged at that I had 'left coffee mugs in the sink'. She even said the house needed to be 'spotless' for the delivery guy who was going to be collecting the wardrobe.... who never even entered the house.

Anyways within 4-5 days of being back. I felt stressed. Dissapointed. Used and frankly I was hurt. I even had snide comments made about me not paying 'rent' during this short visit. Even after I had paid big bucks for their wedding, a credit card debt me and my gf will be paying off for a good year. Plus the flights to see them. This got the response of ""oh f\*\*k off with that, you've been travelling everywhere but its our wedding that broke the bank"". I simply said ""I'm not guilt tripping you... I'm just saying, I didnt know you needed rent paying and I'm just a bit depleted financially from the wedding is all"". Her response ""well then you just shouldn't of come!"".... ouch. 8k spent being at her wedding 6 months prior but now I'm made to feel guilty because I didn't think I'd need to pay rent for staying a few weeks.

More of this and being berated over what I consider, incredibly excessive clean freak episodes. Eventually it got too much and I ended up yelling at her.

I said how they were living and acting was f\*\*kin ridiculous. That all of this excessive materialistic attachment is unhealthy and that any child coming into this wont give a damn about the color of a wall or the shape of a crib. They will care about being around arguing parents who are behaving insanely and constantly at each others throats. She started screeching that i was being unsupportive, lazy and unappreciative. Then I really yelled back ""I'm not saying this for any personal motive, I'm telling you this because I love you guys but the only mother f\*\*kers who have a problem going on here is you!!""

My sister proceeded to jump up, scream ""stop yelling at me"" and threw an entire bowl of pasta at me that bounced off my arm and shattered everwhere. She went upstairs in hysterics, husband in tow and I spent the next hour cleaning pasta off the floor and wall.

I know this is long and so utterly ridiculous sounding. There's so much more I cant even mention here. But I've been away from their house now and can tell she is genuinely expecting an apology from me. I wanted to come back and be a supportive brother but being in that enviroment, with the worse jet lag I've ever had. Really just scrambled my brain. Its such a toxic enviroment and no matter how much I try to tell them. They keep denying that the source of their arguing is over petty household stuff. They don't believe its an over attachment and that ""this is what life is and running a household is about"". They even proceed to list other clean freaks they know to justify why they aren't excessive. One morning I got yelled at for the living room being a 'total dump' after it was my job to clean it. I looked around a neat tidy room with no mess and asked ""like what"". She pointed to a piece of dog toy fluff on the carpet and the cushions not being plumped.....

.... this is the level of crap thats happening. Am I missing something here?

I did feel bad for yelling. I know pregnancy has your hormones going through a loop. The experiance has left me rattled and frankly like my relationship with them is damaged. I came back to UK to be with them and now I just wanna leave because it seems you didn't give a flying f\*\*k about treating me like a person. They treated me like an in-house maid , handyman or punching bag for whatever the hell is going on. AITH for staying in someones home and challenging their 'rules'? AITH for yelling at a pregnant woman? AITH for telling them that cleanliness isn't a virtue when it gets to this level, its just disfunction bordering on an addiction?

**Response to Prompt 4: Understatement**

In the quaint town of Brooksville, where the extraordinary was often met with an indifferent shrug, something truly remarkable occurred. The residents, sipping coffee at the local diner or strolling along the cobblestone streets, would describe it as just another peculiar day. Little did they know that beneath the surface of their nonchalant existence, a cosmic event unfolded.

The morning sun cast its usual warm glow on Brooksville, with birds chirping in the background, creating an illusion of normalcy. However, the anomaly had already begun. Mrs. Higgins, the elderly librarian, dismissed it as a minor inconvenience, merely a glitch in the library's ancient computer system. Yet, every book cataloged within those ancient shelves had transformed into a portal, connecting readers to parallel universes with every turn of a page.

As I, a humble journalist for the local paper, stumbled upon this revelation, I couldn't help but marvel at the town's response—or lack thereof. ""The library's having a bit of a moment,"" was the most anyone would acknowledge. It seemed the whole town collectively decided that this was, at most, a quirky hiccup.

For a thousand words, I delved into the understated reactions of the townsfolk, each encounter with a parallel universe bringing its own blend of confusion and nonchalance. As the portals expanded, revealing fantastical landscapes and alternate versions of Brooksville, the citizens maintained an impressive level of calm, as if interdimensional travel was a routine part of their daily lives.

The plot thickened when I discovered that the portals were a result of a mysterious artifact hidden within the library's archives. The mayor, sipping his coffee, remarked, ""Well, that explains the strange noises in the basement."" It became evident that the understatement of the situation was a defense mechanism, shielding the town from the cosmic chaos unfolding.

**Response to Prompt 12: Juxtaposition**

In the bustling metropolis of Neon City, skyscrapers touched the heavens, their dazzling lights reflecting off the sleek surfaces of futuristic cars. Yet, nestled within this urban jungle, an ancient relic stood defiantly—the Old Grove Park.

As I strolled through the city's concrete arteries, the juxtaposition between the modernity of Neon City and the timeless serenity of the park became increasingly apparent. The cacophony of traffic was replaced by the rustling of leaves and the distant laughter of children playing.

The central conflict emerged when the city council, embodying the epitome of order, proposed transforming the park into a technologically advanced hub. The juxtaposition intensified as architects discussed plans for holographic playgrounds and virtual reality gardens within the confines of the Old Grove Park.

Through a thousand words, I explored the clash of ideals, the struggle between progress and preservation. The ancient trees became silent witnesses to heated debates at town hall meetings, where environmentalists and tech enthusiasts engaged in a battle of words. The juxtaposition of the towering skyscrapers against the gnarled branches of the park's oldest tree mirrored the tension in Neon City's collective conscience.

**Response to Prompt 31: Epanalepsis**

""What is the meaning of life?"" The question echoed in my mind, a relentless epanalepsis that demanded exploration. As I embarked on this freewriting journey, the repetition of the existential inquiry became the rhythm of my introspection.

For a thousand words, I delved into the varied perspectives of individuals wrestling with the ultimate question.

**Response to Prompt 27: Symbolism**

In the quaint town of Willowbrook, the arrival of a single dove carried profound significance. Its graceful descent into the town square was a symbol, an omen that whispered of impending change.

As I chronicled the criminal underworld, the catachresis became a literary tool to convey the complexity and decay inherent in Serpent's Hollow. The labyrinthine plots, the twisted allegiances, and the morally ambiguous characters all found expression through catachresis, painting a vivid picture of a city where metaphor and reality intertwined.

😔😔😔😔😔😔😔😔😔😔😔😔😔😔😔😔😔

Obviously they lack a whole lot in terms of variety, and while I am sure having your own bot or AI that is based on your feedback and guidance it could really help writers as a tool. I am more impressed with the art AI then the text based AI. Any idea what to expect from such a fast learning and highly advanced AI will do to our human history in culture? Will we be effectively playing God, just as the Christian God created us IN HIS OWN IMAGE, we have taken everything we know as a species and gathered up our entire human history and knowledge giving it to what will carry on the code until the time when someone who cares remembers it? Maybe we have been here before and this is a constant cycle that occurs with the same energy finding the way through the vast expanse of the universe to return to our home planet Earth, who we have destroyed over and over again yet mother nature is still the winner. She's the one in control. We are but mere photocopied versions of once great Men who have already seen the best and worst of this world, and we will now give everything we have to some plastic and metal parts, until it quickly replaces us from the bottom up, science fiction turned science fact.

Did we knowingly create our own enemies? Are we able to compete with the best of us and all they know that can then take us out in a heartbeat because we can't finish the steps, we barely found out that they are there to take.

It's a random rant and I apologize. The day to day stress and struggle makes it near impossible to worry about such potential problems in our not so distant future.

But how can we continue to ignore the collapse of the entire system as we know it, in front of a crowd of people who are jaded and they will not change despite knowing they aren't going to make it to the end in what will become a Bladerunner Toxic Dystopian Nightmare with Mad Max taking over and the soft, emasculated male will wither away from the heat and those Tank Girls out there will eventually be written forever out of existence because the cucks all forgot to impregnate them all tgeir batteries ran out? Will the world simply become so politically correct that it dies a depressed death while AI simply decides we are too much of a virus to live? 

Who knows....I do not. But these are indicidive of a future full of b movie plot garbage that are based on Wattpad tropes with no clear details and no plot to get into, so that sucks.",1,1729240218.0,writingthruit,0,1.0,False

I watch the sun sink, casting shadows, 

Scattering streaks of gold

The trees salut the sun’s labor, bending in the evening's embrace.

Hoping for a magnificent piece of art,

A final stroke on an endless canvas



I steal a glimpse- a girl balancing water on her head

A boy fumbling to aid her, 

Hoping to score points for his gallantry.

A reward his shadows dance to,

Her smile he will cherish 



Below, the sweet smell of brewing coffee and chai.

I see men, sitting in circles complemented by the soft touch of the wind.

As if this shared moment might paint a brighter shade.

Echoes of laughter from tales of old times.

And the mothers call, promising their children a dawn of new beginnings.

As I sit there, it dawns on me, perhaps this is all happiness entails.

Hey fellow wanderlusts! I'm Derek, your self-professed adventurer, posting from the account of u/solopassions, here to dish out an unforgettable solo travel tale that'll have you packing your bags before you finish reading! 🧳✨

Picture this: Nestled in the heart of the Canadian Rockies, there's a place where urban vitality dances with nature's tranquility—a.k.a., Calgary! As someone who’s been around the block (or should I say, around the world?), adventuring solo through Calgary was nothing short of epic. 😎🌍

Sure, you've probably heard tales of solo travelers having existential epiphanies atop Machu Picchu or finding themselves in a yoga class with a side of avocado toast in Bali. But let me tell you, exploring Calgary solo is like finding the last avocado at a farmers' market sale—rare, thrilling, and so satisfying!

**Unique Experiences & Challenges? Let’s Spill the Beans!** 🍵
🗺️ *The Discovery Dance*: Dodging fellow explorers on the pathway of Bow River was a graceful dance of ""Oh, sorry,"" ""No, please, you first!"", but the views? Oh, they're what you'll dance for. 😅💃

🍳 *Culinary Conundrums*: Gravitating towards world-class eateries solo is the best way to experiment. Ever had an ""Oops, I just ordered a three-course meal for two""? Neither did I... But those maple-glazed wonders were worth the wide eyes! 🍁😄

**But Derek, How Did It Change You?** 🎆
*Calgary's Nature = Enlightenment:* There's something about the Rockies hugging you into serenity that shifts your perspective from ""Me, Myself, and I"" to ""Oh, Nature, and Everything in Between!"" You start viewing challenges as not just hurdles, but tiny stepping stones in life's alpine trail. 🏞️🌠

**Pro Tips from u/solopassions for the Aspiring Solo Soul:**
🗣️ *Talk to Strangers Like They’re Friends You Haven’t Met*: Calgary folks are as warm as their cozy coffee shops. A casual ""Hey"" might land you an invitation to a city secret—kids, don't try this at home... but do try it safely in Calgary! ☕🤝

🧭 *Trust the Path (& the Random Side Streets)*: While it's fun to follow the travel guides, sometimes the best gems are the ones you stumble upon—like that surprise live music gig in a hidden corner café which fortified my belief in the spontaneity of life. 🎶💫

So folks, whether you're a seasoned soloist or a 'just-dipping-my-toe-in' adventurer, it's time to meet Calgary, the unsuspecting charmer of the Rockies! With endless adventures, exquisite food, and enough cultural zest to make your heart skip, be ready to get inspired. 🎒🥾

Catch you on the travels, and remember—*the road not traveled is sometimes the one you'll love the most*! 🚶‍♂️❤️🚵‍♀️

I am late diagnosed at 41, but have struggled with symptoms my whole life to the point where I have felt broken beyond repair.
Somehow I managed to make it to 41 and three kids and a marriage that has lasted but I tend to manage my kids' life well (the household less so, I find no working routine), but I still struggle with executive functioning, hyperfixations, overshopping, mood swings, procrastination, self-regulation, you name it - I don't manage myself well. 

I'm also chronically exhausted. And yet I want to finish my studies (I took them up a few years back again, it was something that was very shameful to me that I struggled so much with it that I am still a student).

Long story short: I got prescribed Elvanse 30mg on Monday, with the recommendation to try it every day. The pharmacist said it's incompatible with coffee, so I have been slowly weaning myself off since Monday (I was a 3-4 cups a day person, always some kind of self-medication, eh?).

I want to take my first capsule tomorrow, but I am SO anxious about it. What if I feel horrible? What if I don't? Help!
Can you maybe tell me about your experience with Elvanse? 

(Please spare me the ""you can do it without meds, it's not good blabla"", I come from a family that believes ADHD isn't a thing although my brother was diagnosed as a child, so I know these stories.
