Recently, I started in a local trade school. To make a long story short, there is a student in my class, sitting directly in front of me, who quite literally does not stop talking. He will speak when the teachers are trying to speak, trying to teach the class when the teachers are trying to make a point and have a ""funny"" joke after everything anybody says. Add insult to injury; he speaks at a VERY high tone. He is the first thing you hear when you walk into the school every morning...over the music, over the students, over everything, and NON-STOP.

I come in early with my coffee and sit down at my desk. I open my laptop and make it obvious that I'm just trying to relax before we get going. Of course, this kid will pop in and start talking about the most random things. The guy sitting in the corner with the headphones In his ears typing at his laptop in the coffee room is usually the guy who likes to do his thing. I'm all for saying good morning and whatnot, maybe even sharing a quick story, but this kid has no common sense.

  
When we made our student introductions to one another, he made it a point to tell everybody that he has a form of Tourette's, and that's why he won't shut up. Simply put, I call bllsht - allow me to explain: the man is in his 30s, and according to him, was in the United States Marine Corps for eight years. As a veteran myself, I know for a fact that if this kid acted like this in the service, he would've gotten chewed up and spit out. I'm not buying the whole Tourette's thing because I also highly doubt any recruiter provided with that medical diagnosis would not have accepted him.

So, the other day, after about a month of this kid, just nonstop talking and me being respectful, and the countless times that I asked him nicely to be quiet or lower his tone (the teachers have asked him to be quiet also, but it just does not stop); mind you, other classmates have done the same - I finally came at him differently.

""you just can't help yourself, can you? I tell you what, if tomorrow you are quiet for the entire day, I will give you $1000 out of my personal account.""...that didn't work...so, i resorted to, ""shut the fck up."".. well, now he is quiet in class and playing the hard silent guy role....good lord is it blissful!

‚Ä¢Alcohol, in moderation, yes please. 
‚Ä¢Coffee, where have you been all my life.
‚Ä¢Friendships instantly tested and the ones who stayed are there because they genuinely care and are not assigned or called to friendships.
‚Ä¢Marriage / intimacy, more honest, forgiving and no more ‚Äúspecial clothing‚Äù getting in the way. 
‚Ä¢More forgiving and patient with all my children, giving them moral guidelines and actually let them govern themselves. Forgiving of their errors in judgement and letting them touch the flames of mistakes and letting them learn for themselves rather than a purity or total avoidance culture - Less judgement of others and appreciating people where they are at. 
‚Ä¢More forgiving of myself and others. 
‚Ä¢Eternity will take care of itself, I live purposefully today intend on doing good and being good on my terms and as opportunity presents. 

Yes there are still deep and difficult challenges, like loss of multi generational community and with that a Mormon ‚Äúidentity‚Äù. Loss of immediate family connection and familial resonance (tough) but my wife and children are close and we are more real and present with each other. 
A new life of discovery, evolving identity, reimagining of self, desires and dreams is by far still a wonderful exciting challenge and a path of deep satisfaction.

This environment, this product, is a shitshow. Pure ops. I have been trying my hardest to cobble together as many Temporal workflows as possible to automate my involvement, but the larger business has put roadblocks in place that will take months to clear.

So for now, I have to help manually deploy parts of this service. I then hand it over to the other teams who work on config and everything else.

Part of the QA was testing this config process. Reconfigure, remove settings, whatever. Basic QA stuff.

They broke it. It stopped working. They reached out to the software vendor, who ultimately told me I need to look at the logs and figure it out. I don't own the data involved in this, I don't understand why people configure it the way they do, if I did I wouldn't be an SRE, that's not my job. Yet here I am, responsible for cleaning up the environment (manually) every time QA breaks it and the vendor throws up their hands because ""you shouldn't have done that"". This time, they told me I should trawl through the audit logs to see what behaviour might have caused it. I don't even have access to the actual app or system logs, since their service is ""cloud"" (despite requiring a Windows-based heavy client), so all I can do is look up user audit logs to see ""X user did <generic action>"". These are non-technical actions - think scheduling an ad campaign. Even looking at the audit logs, why do I need to care that someones scheduling is wrong? Why am I even here. What did I do to deserve this.

The product itself only runs on Windows (so it's a virtual desktop or VM required to do anything), and their publicly documented solution for regular & well known bugs leading to memory leaks is to simply ""reboot the server daily"". I wish I was joking.

The vendor offers API documentation but absolutely no effort in actually implementing anything that would resemble modern-day automation. Ever get nostalgic for 2002 Java apps? Boy do I have some great news for you.

I cannot dedicate my life to fixing QA fuckups via clickops. I would rather work in a coffee shop.

For the people:
Many students live in housing where pets aren‚Äôt allowed. A cat caf√© gives them a chance to enjoy the comfort of feline companionship.

For the cats:

What to expect:
A cozy atmosphere with delicious coffee, tea, homemade treats like vegan paninis, smoothies, and more. While you enjoy your drink, you can cuddle with our cats and unwind.

1hh03o5,https://www.reddit.com/r/Kneereplacement/comments/1hh03o5/partial_knee_replacement_uka_medial_left_done_in/,"Partial Knee Replacement (UKA) medial left ,done in Mexico, Day 6","My husband is now entering Day 6 post op from his parital knee replacement.  He had two previous meniscal tears including one just a year ago.  They told him that if it happened again that there would not be any ""stuff"" left to scrape and he would be looking at replacement.  The X-rays and MRI showed that the medial side of the left knee was the only one with any issue and so he was a perfect candidate for a UNI compartmental replacement.  However we all know how bureacratic US health care is.  He has been in pain since July, but h had to wait weeks to see a doctor, then he was referred to another doctor that can do the uni, who ordered the MRI, which required PA, and then another consult weeks after to discuss the options, and then another consult weeks after to discuss the process.  Then three more appointments needed to be schedulted before the surgery so the soonest the surgery would have been done was December 9th.  However a week later the assistant called to say that the insurance company denied the prior authorization.  We asked if it could be cash pay and she said their practice does not schedule any surgery unless insurance gives a prior authorization.  So we resarched Turkey, India, Spain, Netherlands, and Mexico.  In the end Mexico was really the only option because it is not advisable to fly longer distances until several weeks post op.  We are not able to remain abroad that long. His only regret about doing it abroad is that he waited so long to be forced to do it now, and that it could have been done back in July if it was known that insurance was not going to cover it.  So much time was wasted trying to follow all the rules.

  
The surgery was actually scheduled for 8pm Thursday night.  He was admitted into the hospital in Merida that afternoon, and surgery actually started closer to midnight.  He returned to the room about 3am.  He was able to almost fully extend as well as bend to about 70 degrees almost immediately.  As soon as he woke up he was able to hobble to the bathroom using his cane in one hand and the IV pole in the other.  The doctor elected to not do a nerve block but just tramadol infusion with paracetemol and keterocol injections instead.  Pain seemed very controlled.  Only th keterocol seemed to cause excessive drowsiness.  After 2 days they let him remove the iv line and just leave the port so he could use a walker and that was 100 times easier than the IV pole because the pole was difficult to roll and it was not even with the cane.  Pain level was consistently zero to 2 except for a couple short periods of time, even as the infusions were reduced.

  
The cotton packing was removed about 12 hours post op and the incision was re-wrapped with compression tape.  He was discharged on day 3 post op.  We took the Tren Maya and the porters brought him in on and off with a wheelchair.  I picked him up in the rental car and he used the walker to get into the condo.  

  
He is using the Curovare app for PT and assesments on progress.  As of last night (Day 5) he was able to transition from the walker to using the cane.  He also ""can"" walk without support.  But he looks dangerously unstable.  Pain control is with 50mg tramadol 3x/day, Tylenol and Celebrex.  The pain he has complained about most has been the headaches from lack of caffeine.  The hospital would not allow coffee or tea without doctor approval.  They also wouldnt lete him have bacon or ""greasy"" foods because his orderes say he needs to lose weight to increase the probability of success.

  
Oh, and there were some doctors that suggested trying alternatives before surgery, and the insurance implied that maybe they would reconsider after 6 to 8 weeks of PT (but probably still would not approve due to BMI).  However the surgeon said that when he saw the femur that there was actually a blunted point on it and it was pretty much IMBEDDED into the tibia.  So it was not just ""bone on bone"".  It was ""bone IN bone"" and no amount of lubrication or PT was going to fix it.

As someone who has a toddler, I can safely i have seen my fair share of ""horrors"" at kids different ages. But does anyone have a horror story that they will tell to new or expectant parents to bring them comfort?

I know that might sound like an odd phrase, but I guess as new parents you can have this pressure that everything you do and feel will be picture perfect. So sometimes I think it's more comforting to share a mishap or parenting blunder, than it is to go ""you got this mama"" üòÜüòÜ

My story is on the first night we bought our baby home I said to my partner how I'd like to go out for coffee the next day. He said ""well we will have to see how baby sleeps and is tomorrow before we can go anywhere."" I've no idea why, but this was a complete realisation for me and I ended up absolutely sobbing. I remember thinking ""what have I done, I regret this so much"" all because my autonomy to pop out for a coffee was out on hold now baby had arrived. 

I remember being so heartbroken and then absolutely horrified at myself for being upset over not going out the next day. I was a mother now, how could I be so selfish?? But now I remember that moment, and it has genuinely helped me through some tough times because what I felt in that moment wasn't about just going out for coffee, but the enormity of everything dawned on me in a very sudden way.

I was so horrible to myself in that moment for feeling so upset, but now I really feel for that new mum. So I always tell people this story, because i want them to know that whatever they're feeling (no matter how bizarre it might seem) others have felt it and to not guilt themselves about it. I literally cried over coffee, and I think I actually said ""I think this was a mistake"". But I thought I was the worst mother in the world for even thinking this, but I now know it was a valid feeling to a massive life change.

Now my child asks to go to a cafe, she brings her colouring books, and it's like things have come full circle.

This method is often preferred for its quick and noticeable results compared to over-the-counter whitening products.

### Before the Procedure

Before undergoing Zoom whitening, you might have concerns about the results. It‚Äôs normal to have questions about whether your teeth will become dramatically whiter and if it‚Äôs worth the investment. To assess your potential results, consider the following:

Check The Details Here: https://prodentim.myofferdeals.com  
  
- **Current Tooth Shade:** Determine how stained or discolored your teeth are. A shade guide can help you see where you stand.
- **Dental Health:** Ensure your oral health is in good shape. Cavities and gum disease should be treated before whitening.
- **Stain Types:** Understand that intrinsic stains (inside the tooth) are harder to remove than extrinsic stains (on the surface).

Once you‚Äôve prepared, you can proceed with the treatment. It's essential to have expectations tailored to your individual circumstances.

### The Zoom Whitening Process

The Zoom whitening procedure usually takes about 45 minutes to an hour. You‚Äôll begin with a dental cleaning to remove plaque and tartar, which ensures effective whitening. Following this:

1. The dentist applies a protective gel to your gums to shield them from the whitening solution.
2. The Zoom whitening gel is then applied to your teeth.
3. A special light activates the gel, speeding up the whitening process.
4. The gel is reapplied multiple times until the desired level of brightness is achieved.

This advanced procedure can lighten your teeth anywhere from 6 to 10 shades in just one session, depending on your unique situation.

### After the Treatment

After you‚Äôve undergone Zoom whitening, the immediate results will often leave you amazed. Here are some common outcomes:

- **Instant Brightness:** The contrast between your new bright smile and the previous shade is striking‚Äîmany patients are thrilled with their results right away.
- **Long-Lasting Effects:** With proper care, the effects can last for several months to even years. This depends on personal habits like eating, drinking, and oral hygiene.
- **Improved Confidence:** A whiter smile can significantly boost your confidence. Many people report feeling more comfortable in social situations post-treatment.

However, it‚Äôs essential to follow aftercare instructions. Avoid foods and drinks that can stain your teeth, such as coffee, tea, or red wine, especially right after treatment. Staying diligent about oral hygiene will help maintain your new shade.

### Real-Life Experiences

Many patients share their transformative experiences through testimonials and before-and-after pictures:

3. **Individual C:** Found it easier to smile in photos and felt that it positively impacted their personal and professional life.

These experiences highlight the powerful effect of Zoom whitening, not only on physical appearance but also on emotional well-being.

If you're considering enhancing your smile, Zoom whitening delivers impressive before and after results that truly transform your appearance. By understanding the process, preparing effectively, and taking care of your teeth afterward, you can unlock the potential for a dazzling smile that leaves an enduring impression.

Key Factors Influencing Your Zoom Whitening Results and Maintenance Tips
------------------------------------------------------------------------

If you‚Äôre considering zoom whitening as a way to brighten your smile, understanding the key factors that influence your results can help you achieve the best possible outcome. Various elements come into play when it comes to teeth whitening, and knowing these can make a significant difference in your experience and satisfaction.

Check The Details Here: https://prodentim.myofferdeals.com  
  
### Understanding Your Oral Health

Your oral health is the foundation of effective zoom whitening results. Before you decide to undergo the procedure, it's essential to consult with your dentist to assess your overall dental condition. Here are some factors to think about:

- **Cavities:** Active decay can hinder the whitening process. Addressing any dental issues should be your first step.
- **Gum Health:** Healthy gums are crucial for a successful whitening procedure. If you have gum disease, it may be advisable to treat that first.
- **Existing Dental Work:** Crowns, veneers, and fillings may not respond to whitening treatments like natural teeth. Consult your dentist to understand how this affects your results.

### Types of Stains

The source of your tooth stains can also determine how well zoom whitening will work for you. There are two main types of stains:

Check The Details Here: https://prodentim.myofferdeals.com  
  
- **Extrinsic Stains:** These are surface stains caused by food, beverages, and habits like smoking. Zoom whitening is particularly effective for this type of discoloration.
- **Intrinsic Stains:** These deeper stains often result from aging, trauma, or certain medications. While zoom whitening can still help, the results may vary.

### Pre-Treatment Preparation

Preparing for your zoom whitening session can set the stage for success. Here are a few tips:

- **Brush and Floss:** Maintain good oral hygiene before your appointment. A clean mouth allows for better application of the whitening agent.
- **Avoid Staining Foods and Drinks:** For about 24 hours before your treatment, steer clear of foods and drinks that can stain your teeth, such as coffee, tea, or red wine.
- **Discuss Your Expectations:** Talk to your dentist about what you hope to achieve. Setting realistic expectations can enhance your satisfaction with the results.

### The Zoom Whitening Process

During the zoom whitening procedure, a professional-grade whitening gel and LED light are used together to accelerate the whitening process. The whole session typically lasts around 45 minutes. It's important to follow your dentist's instructions during the treatment to maximize your results.

Check The Details Here: https://prodentim.myofferdeals.com  
  
### Post-Treatment Maintenance Tips

Once you've completed zoom whitening, maintaining your brighter smile is key. Here are some steps you can take:

- **Follow-up Care:** Your dentist may suggest a follow-up treatment or touch-up kits to maintain your new shade.
- **Be Mindful of Staining Foods:** After whitening, your teeth can be more susceptible to staining, so limit consumption of things like coffee, tea, and dark berries.
- **Maintain Good Oral Hygiene:** Brushing twice a day and flossing regularly will help prevent plaque and keep your smile bright.
- **Regular Dental Visits:** Schedule routine check-ups to keep your teeth and gums healthy. This also allows your dentist to monitor your whitening results over time.

### Consider Your Lifestyle Choices

Your daily habits can have a direct impact on how long your zoom whitening results last. Here are some lifestyle adjustments to consider:

Check The Details Here: https://prodentim.myofferdeals.com  
  
- **Smoking:** Tobacco can stain teeth quickly. Quitting smoking not only improves your health but also helps maintain your whitening results.
- **Dietary Choices:** Opt for a balanced diet and drink plenty of water to flush away food particles and maintain oral health.

Achieving optimal zoom whitening results involves a combination of your oral health, the type of stains you're dealing with, proper treatment preparation, and diligent post-whitening care. By understanding these key factors and implementing maintenance tips, you can enjoy a bright, confident smile that lasts.

### Conclusion

The journey to a brighter smile through Zoom whitening is both exciting and rewarding. Many individuals experience a stunning transformation when comparing their before and after results. These enhancements can dramatically boost your confidence, making you feel more at ease in social situations and improving your overall self-image. The visual evidence of zoom whitening clearly shows its ability to eliminate stains and provide a more youthful, vibrant look.

However, achieving the best results doesn‚Äôt end with the treatment itself. Understanding key factors that influence your Zoom whitening results is crucial. The condition of your teeth, the severity of stains, and even your dental hygiene habits play significant roles in how white and bright your smile can become. Not to mention, the sensitivity of your teeth can also affect your experience and outcomes.

Check The Details Here: https://prodentim.myofferdeals.com  
  
To maintain your newfound brilliance, adopting proper care and maintenance habits is essential. Regular brushing, flossing, and using whitening toothpaste can help preserve the results. It‚Äôs also wise to avoid certain foods and drinks that can cause staining, as well as scheduling regular check-ups with your dentist.

By blending the knowledge of transformative results with proactive maintenance strategies, you can enjoy a stunningly bright smile that lasts. The journey with Zoom whitening opens the door not just to a beautiful smile, but to renewed confidence and self-esteem, making it a worthwhile investment for your overall appearance. Embrace this change and take steps to maintain it for the long haul. Your smile is one of your greatest assets; let it shine!

1hgzxi7,https://www.reddit.com/r/CharlieTheTraveler/comments/1hgzxi7/united_kingdom/,United Kingdom,"Below is an article I wrote in which I explained where in United Kingdom I think you should visit, how much time I think you should spend at each of these recommended destinations and the order in which to visit these destinations. Feel free to direct message me if you need help.

Boasting the ‚ÄúGlobal Command Center,‚Äù that is London, birthplace of some of the world‚Äôs most popular rock bands, and live music venues, featuring several heritage-rich urban centers, dotted with quaint villages, farmhouses, secluded chapels, ruined castles, and prehistoric monuments, and home to compact yet diverse nature that is just perfect for adventurous activity, today‚Äôs United Kingdom is a fascinating place.

Comprised of the democratic countries/states that are England, Scotland, Wales, and Northern Ireland, united into a kingdom that encompassed almost a quarter of the Earth's land surface and served as the largest empire in history by 1922 and still owning fourteen overseas territories as well as various ‚Äòcrown dependencies‚Äô, this first-ever industrialized nation undoubtedly marches to the beat of its own drum. The modern-day United Kingdom provides a mosaic of native and immigrant traditions while internationally it is still quite influential on a political, economic, and cultural level.

**Days 1-7:** Start your trip to the UK in **London**. If you want to cover all the highlights the capital has to offer, then you will need 7 days, including the morning arrival from Brussels, Belgium.

There is really a lot to see.

The Buckingham Palace, Hampton Court Palace, London Eye, Palace of Westminster and its Big Ben, Piccadilly Circus, Saint Paul's Cathedral, Tower Bridge, Tower of London, Trafalgar Square, and Westminster Abbey are only some of the many attractions that make London one of the world‚Äôs most popular tourist destinations. Also of interest are the city‚Äôs first-class music, entertainment and fashion industries, sporting events, and cultural arts scene: contemporary museums, art galleries, and theater performances alike. Ultimately, London is the kind of place that transforms and reinvents itself to virtually no end, with historic monuments juxtaposed with strikingly modern designs and sizeable swathes of peaceful green space surrounding streets that are buzzing with foot traffic.

The capital of both England and the United Kingdom sets the tone in so many ways: an international hub for politics, media, finance, business, research, and development, the EU‚Äôs biggest (urban zone), richest (GDP) and most diverse and densely populated city, home to the continent‚Äôs largest concentration of higher learning institutions, and so forth. Allow yourself

enough time to see the sites. Try to watch parliament in session. Ride the London Underground, which is one of the planet‚Äôs oldest and most extensive underground railway networks. Take a boat cruise along the River Thames. Do some people-watching at a park. Certainly not least, get into a pub for some live music and local beer. Essentially British yet equally fast-paced, loud, and multicultural, traditionally innovative London is truly a global epicenter.

**Day 8:** Make a **daytrip** via a 1.5-hour train ride to **Bath**.

Renowned for its Roman-era hot springs, graced with Georgian architecture crafted from light- golden stone, and dotted with gardens, museums, theaters, restaurants, and pubs, the UNESCO World Heritage Site that is Bath ranks among the United Kingdom‚Äôs most visually appealing

tourist destinations. Popular attractions include ‚ÄòThe Circus‚Äô circular space, the Royal Crescent residential road, and the Roman Baths complex. This is a place undoubtedly rich in heritage.

**Day 9:** Make a **daytrip** via a 1-hour train ride to **Oxford**. This college town really does deserve 2 days. However, relocating from London would be inconvenient.

Home of an internationally-acclaimed academic institution, graced with medieval churches, much green space, and historic pubs, and dotted with 39 colleges that commonly have their own stunning lecture halls, peaceful quadrangles, and otherwise distinct and well-preserved traditions, honey-colored and stone-built Oxford has much to offer. The architecture here in the ‚ÄúCity of Dreaming Spires‚Äù is rich, while the museums and art galleries are fascinating and the atmosphere, highly authentic. After a day of sightseeing, River Cherwell and River Thames provide a leisurely opportunity for some punting. This world-renowned university town truly is like no other.

**Day 10:** Make a **daytrip** via an organized bus tour to the **Cotswolds**, which is a 2-hour drive away from London.

Numerous honey-colored, limestone-built, and well-preserved historic villages are dotted along a bucolic landscape to form a backdrop characterized by thatched cottages - many of which are B&Bs, rustic mansions, secluded churches, peaceful gardens, shops selling books, antiques, and arts and crafts, sociable pubs, and farmers‚Äô markets. This wealthy, service-friendly and yet tranquil area has *Old English* charm written all over it.

Note: although organized bus tour daytrips are commonly made from London and especially Oxford, even more popular is to simply base yourself in Chipping Campden, Northleach, Winchcombe, or ideally Henley-on-Thames to explore the area from there. If you decide to relocate from London, then give yourself a couple of days to soak up the atmosphere. Try to avoid the summer crowds. Hike along the Cotswold Way footpath. Sample some of the local produce. Not least, sip on good old-fashioned tea.

**Day 11:** Make a **daytrip** via a 1-hour train ride to **Cambridge**. This town is popular specifically for its many historic universities as well as for its student scene. The University of Cambridge, founded in 1209, is arguably one of the top universities in the world.

**Day 12:** Take a 2.5-hour train ride to **Chester**. **1 day** suffices as long as you have an early morning arrival from London. This town has a number of medieval and Victorian buildings centered within its historic walls.

**Day 13:** Make a **daytrip** via an organized tour to the **Snowdonia national park**, which is approximately an hour away from Chester.

A couple of this park‚Äôs most popular attractions include a mountain bike forest resort called Coed-y-Brenin, and an outdoor activities center called Plas y Brenin, the latter of which is known for mountaineering, climbing, and canoeing. A great way to see this park is via the Ffestiniog Railway. Those who wish to stay within the park area rather than make a daytrip from Chester commonly base themselves in Harlech and Conwy, the latter of which boasts impressive town walls and both of which are home of fine castles. I personally recommend skipping Harlech and Conwy and simply making a daytrip.

**Days 14-15:** Take a 3-hour train ride to **York**. 2 days suffice, including the afternoon arrival from Chester.

Characterized by a grand and gothic cathedral, graced with narrow streets filled with boutique shops, dotted with castle remains, and affording fine views along its defense walls, there is much to enjoy in this heritage-rich town in which New York was named after. York is a charming and inviting place, not least appreciated when taking a boat cruise briefly around River Foss and

especially along River Ouse. Down-to-earth yet visually appealing nevertheless, York definitely belongs on your travel itinerary to the UK.

**Days 16-17:** Take a 3.5-hour train ride to Windermere, best used as a base from which to explore the **Lake District National Park**. 2 days suffice, including the early afternoon arrival from Conwy. Some of this verdant park‚Äôs most popular attractions include Grizedale Forest, Coniston Water Lake, Windermere Lake, and the Honister Slate Mine.

**Days 18-19:** Take a 3-hour train ride to **Edinburgh**. 2 days suffice, as long as you arrive early from Windermere. Arrive as early as possible, as the capital of Scotland has much to offer.

Proudly perching historic structures atop crags with cliffs serving as the backdrop, Edinburgh is a royal and cultured yet equally atmospheric city graced with a UNESCO-listed medieval old town as well as Georgian ‚Äònew‚Äô town. Dotted with palaces, gothic churches and windy and often steep streets and otherwise surrounded by much green space, the city is perhaps best recognized for its imposing and highly symbolic castle.

As heritage-rich as the capital of Scotland is, the city is no less modern, featuring several contemporary museums and galleries, shops, restaurants, an inviting and late-night pub scene, and year-around lively festivals. Although Edinburgh is one of the United Kingdom‚Äôs most popular tourist destinations, it maintains its authenticity nevertheless. Spend your day sightseeing, mid-afternoon eating haggis, early evening stunned by one of the many dramatic viewpoints and night mingling with what are usually well-mannered, sociable, and friendly

people. Don‚Äôt worry: Scotsmen are not all like the Simpsons‚Äô Groundskeeper Willie.

**Day 20:** Make a **daytrip** via a 1.5-hour train ride to **Glasgow**. Although much of this city has a post-industrial and suburban look to it, specifically George Square and Buchanan Street are quite impressive, as is the university located in the western part of town. Below are the names of the attractions I recommend you visit.

1. Ashton Lane: This is a cobbled backstreet noted for its bars, restaurants and a licensed cinema.

2. Buchanan Street: This is a pedestrianized street.

3. City Chambers

4. Finnieston: This is a hip foodie hub of gourmet sandwich shops, artisanal coffee bars and trendy organic restaurants.

5. Gallery of Modern Art

6. George Square

7. Glasgow Cathedral

8. Glasgow Necropolis

9. Glasgow Tower

10. Glasgow University

11. Grand Central Hotel

12. Hunterian Art Gallery

13. IMAX Cinema

14. Ingram Street and the Italian Center, Merchant City: Designer boutiques and stylish cafes fill former warehouses on Ingram Street. In the Italian Center, an elegant shopping block surrounds a courtyard.

15. Kelvin Hall

16. Kelvingrove Art Gallery and Museum

17. Kelvingrove Park

18. Merchant Square: This is an iconic dining, drinking and entertainment venue.

19. People‚Äôs Palace

20. Royal Infirmary Museum

21. Saint Andrew‚Äôs Square & Cathedral

22. Saint Vincent Place & Square

23. Sauchiehall Street: This is one of the main shopping streets in the city.

24. Templeton on the Green: This is a distinctive building best appreciated from the outside, as the inside is simple office space.

25. Tennent‚Äôs Brewery

26. The Mitchell Library

27. WEST Brewery

**Days 21-23:** Take a flight from Edinburgh to Inverness, the gateway to the **Isle of Skye**. 3 days suffice, including the early afternoon arrival from Edinburgh. One of this stunning island‚Äôs most popular attractions is the Cuillin Mountains.",1,1734522747.0,CharlieTheTraveler,0,1.0,False

Kaffa‚Äôs story begins with Robert W. Thoresen, who arrived in Norway with a suitcase and a dream after working as an architect in San Francisco. In 1997, he opened Java Espressobar & Kaffeforretning on St. Hanshaugen, which quickly became one of Oslo‚Äôs top coffee spots, known for its meticulous attention to quality.

Driven by a passion to create the best coffee, Robert expanded his vision, opening Mocca Kaffebar and Brenneri in 2001‚Äîa caf√© and micro-roastery that laid the foundation for Kaffa‚Äôs roasting style and flavor profile. Kaffa was officially established in 2005 and has since grown into one of Norway‚Äôs leading specialty coffee roasteries, sourcing exceptional beans with full traceability.

When western tourists rave about visiting the beautiful mountains in Switzerland or New Zealand or Nepal, india has that too- it‚Äôs called Himachal Pradesh, ladak, and jammu. 

When western tourists rave about coffee or tea plantations in South America or Bali, well India has that as well- Darjeeling in Bengal or chikmagalur in Karnataka are just two examples. There are others I can‚Äôt think of in india. 

When American or Canadian tourists rave about how much culture there is when visiting Western Europe, I shake my head. India also has culture. Hell india is the oldest human civilization and has plenty of temples older than even the oldest churches in Europe. 

Yet in spite of what india has to offer, western people and even people from other countries immediately talk about negatives about india. They say it‚Äôs dirty, unhygienic, too crowded, too polluted, visiting india is an assault on all five of your senses etc. Part of this is because of some of India‚Äôs popular tourist attractions are well maintained but the surrounding area of these tourist attractions is horribly maintained. Go to Taj Mahal and you‚Äôll see this firsthand. The Taj Mahal is beautiful but once walk maybe 300 meters away, you see some of the worst filth- no dust bins to throw trash, mounds of garbage on the ground, flies, dusty grounds, filthy stray dogs, hanging electrical wires in the middle of the street, half finished sidewalks with big ditches in them full of rubbish etc. And this is why so many westerners portray India in a bad light.  It‚Äôs not that all India‚Äôs places to visit are dirty. Kerala for example is much cleaner. Mysuru is cleaner. Bangalore, chennai, and Hyderabad are also much cleaner. It‚Äôs just that some of India‚Äôs most popular such as Taj Mahal and golden temple are near a lot of rubbish and dirt. You don‚Äôt see this to the same extent in many popular vacation destinations around the world that are in developing countries Eg Cancun or Istanbul or Rio de Janeiro. 

Aside from that, india does not make it easy for a foreigner to visit. One needs to get a e-visa in advance to be able to visit and the site to do this application is very out of date. Many places issue visa on arrival to tourists Eg Bali. Aside from the headache to get a visa, most Indian merchants do not allow foreigners to use international credit/debit cards and instead pay an additional fee of 1000 rupees to apply for a upi wallet. As for those who say pay with cash, a lot of merchants don‚Äôt have change so this complicates things if you don‚Äôt have upi. In most places, a foreigner can pay with cash or their international credit card. Then, a lot of places/Indian apps don‚Äôt let you use their services if you don‚Äôt have an India mobile number. Zomato and ola both don‚Äôt let you use their services if you do not have an India mobile number. Even to get wifi at an Indian airport, you need an India mobile number to receive the OTP code to be able to connect. If you don‚Äôt have an india mobile number you need to find an information kiosk and be issued a WiFi voucher where you need to fill out a form containing your personal information including your passport. In many countries, one can connect to wifi almost immediately as soon as they land in the airport of that country without needing a local phone number or filling out all your personal details Eg Bali, Hong Kong, Istanbul, Cancun, london, Paris etc. 

I hope India finds ways to simplify this process for tourists to be able to visit india as india has a lot to offer any tourist. ",20,1734520471.0,india,14,0.81,False

I have owned a (used) Elektra Microcasa Semiautomatica for the last 6 months. To complement it I got myself a (new) Eureka Mignon Specialit√†.

Since I got the machine used, I performed a deep clean of its espresso loop. Quite some grime came out... I used a K√∂nig/Turmix organic descaler based on lactic acid. I then took the group apart and cleaned every part. My many thanks to u/BridgeofBirds for her suggestions about how to remove that pesky shower screen and disassemble the whole thing!

I have tried a wide range of coffees, from freshly roasted specialty beans to no-roasting-date supermarket stuff, from 100% arabica to 80% robusta.  
I have tried both single and double baskets, underfilling, overfilling and going just right.  
I've worked on the grinding, going from a waterfall of coffee to a choked machine.  
I got myself a 58.55 mm tamper from Lelit, which fits like a glove (as long as I don't underfill the single basket) and a precise-enough scale.  
I tried letting the machine heat up for hours, with and without cooling flush. This machine gets quite hot, a cooling flush can last up to 5 to 10 seconds!

The coffee is simply too strong, every time. Depending on the ratio I choose, it can get either sour or bitter, but that is in addition to the omnipresent overwhelming taste of the coffee. The crema is so beautiful...

The cleaning of the machine did not have any effect on the taste of my espresso.

Please, as I am new to this (by ability more than by time), does anyone have any kind of suggestion? If I forgot to add some vital piece of information, please do tell!

Thank you all!

1hgz9nv,https://www.reddit.com/r/foxholegame/comments/1hgz9nv/foxholehq_calculator_rework/,FoxholeHQ Calculator Rework,"Hey guys I've been working on my calculator rework for a bit now and I wanted to share some of the things I've been working on and some of the new features. I've been updating my progress on my discord however I don't get too much traction on there so I wanted to show you all on reddit.

**\*\*NOTE\*\*** Calculator is made for both factions, UI can be themed for Wardens as well

My new focus for this new calculator is to rework the entire thing from scratch and implement new features, the previous version was very bare bones (MPF/Factory calculations)

The first things I wanted to add was the ability to view what you are hovering over so you can easily see what the item is and its information.

https://i.redd.it/j04nxrom8l7e1.gif

The second thing I wanted to add was to FINALLY add the Warden section to the calculator and add all of their items. This also includes the ability to view what items are neutral between both factions.

Next thing I wanted to add was the ability to save presets so when you return to the website you can load up what you have saved previously (Presets are planned to be expanded upon in the future to add names/icons)

https://i.redd.it/yypct6vn8l7e1.gif

Next up on the list is a 3 for 1, I wanted to add the ability to see what your current MPF discount is, the ability to hover on most items to get the information about it (Tooltips), and a little area that shows what the current ratios are for the crated resources to make sure its accurate (Might be innacurate I need to get up to date numbers :D)

https://i.redd.it/425xcnqo8l7e1.gif

and finally the part I'm most excited about is the ability to submit your current order into the statistics panel, this area is meant to track everything you have created by manually pushing a button (White button with black checkmark) and it will log your crates.

These panels currently will show you the total resources used, total crates used, total crates per category, total crates per item, and a history of all the items you created. I also plan on adding more information such as:

* Total Crates made
* Total Resources saved from MPF discounts
* Individual information about each crate such as time made, specific items discount, and its current cost when made.
* and anything else I can think of!

FYI UI and Panels are not completed

https://i.redd.it/vmha45ak9l7e1.gif

I know your average joe isn't going to want all these extra features so I do plan on adding a Simple or Advanced option to hide anything that's extra besides the Item Info and Presets.

If curious this is what the current calculator looks like:

My husband has always been emotionally closed off and I am a very emotional person so it can be a recipe for disaster. We have gone over and over how he can react when I (or anyone) feels bad, both alone and in therapy but he just doesn't get it. Even if he hugs me when I feel bad, it feels forced and awkward leading me to feeling worse.

The other day after therapy, I was really upset. We talked about stuff with my mother and it was really upsetting for me. After therapy, we were supposed to go to the bank together.

Personally if my husband was crying, I would have said ""let's not go to the bank, let's get coffee/go for a walk/whatever first"". But no, off to the bank we went. Did the bank stuff which ended up being more complicated than I thought and then I got more upset because I was frustrated (I know I sound like a baby, but we live in my husband's country and everything is difficult for me.)

Did he ask me to go for a coffee or walk or anything? No. He said ""ok see you after work"" and went back to his office.

I feel so hurt and rejected and I haven't spoken to him since. He has sometimes tried to do awkward hugging or his usual tactic of trying to do hundreds of nice things for me, but it is just like...I just want him to hear me and be there for me and actually acknowledge my feelings when I feel bad.

For the first time, I am seriously regretting marrying him. He is a good person, and on a practical level, we work well together. But on an emotional level - there is nothing there.

I don't know how I can face this.

Also we can't get divorced because he would get custody and I would be stuck in this country alone.

I want to share ny story, but I have incredible doubt as of today.","I have always considered myself a very spiritual person, and have great empathy, sometimes i have a burning hatred towards those who have deliberately hurt me, but Its a soon extinguished flame, I try not to dwell, sometimes takes longer than other times.

I'd like to say that, this story is pretty long, but if you'd like to skip to the me meeting my twin flame for the first time, I'll begin the paragraph with ""------#3""

------ Heart break feeling is right at the end

First I want to explain that, 

#1 until 3rd quater of 2023 I was in a toxic relationship with an abusive, gaslighting narcisist who had abused me constantly. It lasted nearly a decade. During this relationship I was emotionally withdrawn, but stayed together due to low self esteem and low self worth. 

About a month after my mother passed away, whom i was close too. My at the time partner  left me, to move in with a guy she was cheating on me with,. She was feeding him lies that I was abusive and he needed to rescue her, i eventually witnessed it all. 

So I'd like to clarify at this point the relationship was already over because my intuition already knew she cheated multiple times, I was emotionally withdrawn, though I pretended it was fine and I stayed for way too long. 

During the relationship I developed a heavy drinking problem, I became depressed and lost joys in anything I used to love, only to spark it after, a 700ml bottle of whiskey /, spirits.

Although I drank heavily and every night, I was extremely functional and I worked 50+ hour weeks, happily and great work ethic. 
The alcohol was nothing but a replacement for confidence that I have lost.

#2 fast forward so after the break up I left to a new city. Few months single, not heart broken, more relief that it was over actually, yet still addicted to the confidence alcohol gave me. 


""------#3""

So I arrive in Jan to my new partial furnished unit, 
Unloaded the car, get settled in. Then I went to the local store to get groceries, just some easy cook meals. And then to a nearby liqour store.
In that liqour store, From the distance I saw the clerk, which I could only explain as the epitome of someone I've wanted to meet for aslong as I remember. Decades nearly..

It wasn't just the pretty face, the smile but it was the extreme shyness and the body language that suggested, happy to be there but just, shy. 

I immediately felt overwhelmed, and I mean I felt something special and I just wanted to be with that person, be there comfort and make them feel safe. 

I remember the eye contact, the smiles, and the very short very quiet expressions of small chat,

I have seen her, ALOT up until around july, I never pushed further than just walking in, excitedly saying ""heyyy!"" As I walk in, grab exactly what i wanted, got it rung up smiled and leave. 

She was on my mind ALOT, And i never felt this way before, with anybody, ever.

Well since July i had moved out of that area, again. And did not work near that store at all,

So for 3 weeks after moving out, I drove out of my way to visit maybe twice a week over 3 weeks but as luck had it I never saw her, so I gave up.

[I WOULD LIKE TO NOTE DURING THIS TIME, (JAN / JULY) I HAVE CONSTANTLY BEEN SEEING ANGEL NUMBERS, WHICH I BELIEVED WAS REFERENCE TO MY ADVANCEMENT IN MY CAREER (INCLUDING FINDING MY DREAM JOB) AND LIFE STABILITY AND CHANGES WHICH WAS HAPPENING VERY QUICKLY SHORTLY AFTER MOVING TO CITY]

So Since I left the area in july, and gave up that was it.
I still thought about her very often, but not in an obsessive rate. 
Well as luck would have it, I recently lost my job, which I percieved to be my dream job, I knew i wanted, YEARS AGO.

It lead me back to my old job, which happened to have that local store with that girl, a short detour from the job site towards my new rental. (I pay $555 a week, how about that?)
I decided what the hey, and pulled in. 
And there she was.. and I felt as smitten as I ever was.

Infact, this was 2ish weeks ago. And it wasn't until a week ago I found out the definition of a twin flame. 

See I thought it was love at first sight. 

But I knew i want to be the best version of myself for her, since I first SAW her. 

And I'm trying to be that, guy. Although my biggest steps were taken, since last week. 

I don't drink to pass out anymore. 
I am slowly falling back into old habbits, 
The things I used to enjoy ESPECIALLY MUSIC, 
Coffee in the morning (hadnt done in literal years) 
I have anxiety, and I am often pretty decent at masking it.
Which means i am a quiet person, and don't get involved in conversation unless i am directly asked. 
I am actively trying to become a little more engaging, rather than stand by ish.

I currently realised all the angel numbers and everything i have witnessed this year, had nothing to do with my careers, it was a journey that is still ongoing. And it makes sense to me even now, I lost my dream job but I am completely optimistic
Now I feel its all related to my spiritual journey.

------- this is where I suddenly felt heart broken

I woke up this morning, and had a sudden urge to go through my social media history. 
And I saw a girl I sent a request to, which happens to have the same first name as my Twin Flame, i do not know her last name. 
However, I am not sure they are the same person. 
I feel like they look similar, but I feel like my twin flame is absolutely 10fold more gorgeous. But I've also forgotten what my tf looks like, and Ive seen her near all year and just last week, twice.

Now this person I said a request too, turns out I sent it 4months ago, (the night after i left old area) and never realised because I was very drunk that night, as with most nights before very very recently.

So I felt something off, I just feel incredibly awkward when I enter the store today although she wasnt there. I FEEL so out of place. I feel like people know that I added her ( even though i dont even know or think its her but i cant recognise her,, just same first name), 

And since today, i've just started losing hope. 

Last night i begged for signs, i was in dissaray, 
And i got nothing. 

Only signs I got was the urge to check my facebook history. Coming across that account i requested months ago (which is odd because this girl with the same name i added is from my home town but lives in same city)
And on the way to work the only number plate i took notice of was 555way which i interpereted as the definition 555, on its way.


After today, however. Going to the store and not seeing her, and how unincluded I felt being present at the store. I just felt broken...

And for a period I just wanted to ignore everything forget and ignore the chase, but I randomly hurt. 
I went from butterflies in stomach into a chest of despair.

The dream? A Porsche Taycan‚Äîprobably a 2021 model, ideally with fewer than 30k miles on it. Now, before I dive headfirst into this:

Step 1: Must-Have Options‚ÄîWhat‚Äôs Worth It?

The Taycan comes with so many options it feels like Porsche wants you to build a car and solve a Sudoku puzzle at the same time. So, what are the absolute must-haves? What‚Äôs worth splashing out on, and what‚Äôs just ‚Äúmeh‚Äù? For example:
	‚Ä¢	Must-haves: Adaptive cruise control? Panoramic roof? Fancy sound system for blasting your ‚ÄúI‚Äôm rich now‚Äù playlist?
	‚Ä¢	Nice-to-haves: Are things like the passenger display or upgraded wheels really game-changers?
	‚Ä¢	Skip it: Anything you‚Äôve tried and thought, ‚ÄúWhy did I pay for this?‚Äù
Help me sift through this madness‚Äîwhat‚Äôs essential to lock in, and what can I live without?

Step 2: Porsche Dealership vs. Autotrader/Private Sellers

Now, here‚Äôs the big question: Do I stick with Porsche-approved dealerships like a responsible adult, or do I go rogue on Autotrader or through private sellers? Is there a golden rule here where buying from Porsche is a no-brainer because of things like warranties, certified checks, or free coffee while you sign the papers? Or can I save a chunk of change by going non-dealership without regretting it later?

Step 3: Recalls, Software Updates & Battery Checks

Lastly, let‚Äôs talk about the nerdy but important stuff. Are there any recalls or known issues with 2021 Taycans that I should be aware of?

The thrill of the open road, the hum of the engine, and the opportunity to connect with myself in solitude had been calling me for years. Until now, the longest ride I‚Äôd done was 200 kilometers in a day. This time, I decided to push my limits and embark on a solo ride from Mumbai to Hyderabad ‚Äî a journey spanning over 750 kilometers each way.

**Why Hyderabad?**

Hyderabad is a city I‚Äôve visited many times for work, but this trip was different. Instead of flying, I decided to ride there. To make the journey manageable, I planned a stopover in Solapur on my way to Hyderabad and in Pune on my way back. It was my first long solo ride, and I‚Äôd be lying if I said I wasn‚Äôt anxious. But that anxiety only made me prepare  better.

**Preparing for the Ride**

I spent days preparing for the contingencies of a solo ride. I created a detailed [checklist of items to pack](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1LWcMz5H5wH5BVl8Iswi6ih72ojN58J0snFlMY6KpKhU/edit?tab=t.0), which included everything from essential tools to first-aid supplies. My younger brother lent me his trusty [Gods Triton X2 saddle bags](https://www.roadgods.com/product/gods-triton-x2-50ltr-saddlebag-with-capsule-rain-cover/), which proved to be a lifesaver for organising my gear. I also ensured my **Royal Enfield Super Meteor 650** was in perfect condition and ready for the adventure ahead. I visited the Royal Enfield service centre a day before the ride and got the motorcycle thoroughly checked. The technicians inspected the engine oil, brake fluid, chain, and all other essentials to ensure everything was in top-notch condition for the long journey.

[All the gear ready for the ride next day](https://preview.redd.it/uwdx0rxn5l7e1.jpg?width=2354&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=1e78b0d777a8a19db77a3cc8222dc7fd1ef0e0ad)

**The Ride Begins**

I set off at 6 AM on a crisp Saturday morning. Barely 15 minutes into the ride, I noticed the dreaded **engine malfunction light** flashing on my dashboard. My heart sank. The fear of having to cancel my trip, or worse, being stranded in some remote area with a broken-down bike, was overwhelming. I immediately called a friend Akhtar bhai ([786 Rider](https://www.instagram.com/786_rider_akhtar/)) who runs a motorcycle workshop. Coincidentally, he was also on a ride to Goa that day. He reassured me and advised me to ride carefully to Pune and visit the nearest **Royal Enfield service centre** once it opened at 9 AM.

Those three hours of riding to Pune were filled with anxiety, but I made it to the service centre intact. The staff there were incredibly helpful and, understanding my urgency, promptly checked my bike. Thankfully, it was a minor issue, and they didn‚Äôt even charge me for the service! With my confidence restored, I hit the road again, ready to take on the adventure.

**The Journey to Solapur**

Navigating through Pune‚Äôs infamous traffic was a challenge, but once I crossed the city, the roads opened up. The highway was smooth, straight, and had little traffic. With music playing through my Bluetooth earphones and Android Auto guiding me on the dash, I finally began to enjoy the ride. I stopped at a roadside dhaba for a hearty lunch and later at a small eatery for some local snacks. The conversations with the roadside vendors about their lives and aspirations added a personal touch to the journey.

I reached Solapur around 4 PM, checked into a hotel, and freshened up. In the evening, I explored the city, visiting the famous **Shri Siddheshwar Devasthan** and a local sweet shop to pick up some treats for my colleagues. Riding through Solapur‚Äôs streets was a different experience altogether, with its unique charm and welcoming people.

**The Ride to Hyderabad**

The next day, I started my ride at 8 AM after a hearty breakfast. The highway from Solapur to Hyderabad was even better ‚Äî straight, smooth, and surrounded by beautiful countryside. The weather was pleasant, making the ride an absolute joy. I reached Hyderabad by 2 PM, checked into my hotel, and spent the evening exploring the city‚Äôs local attractions.

During the weekdays, my work kept me busy, but I made it a point to step out in the evenings to experience Hyderabad‚Äôs vibrant food culture. I was amazed to see the love this city has for chai. At 11:30 PM, tea cafes were buzzing with energy, filled with people chatting over **bun-maska** and chai. It was refreshing to see how Hyderabad‚Äôs tea culture still thrives, even as coffee culture takes over many other cities.

**The Return Journey**

On Saturday morning, I began my ride back, stopping at Pune for the night. The straight highways once again provided a sense of freedom and exhilaration.

[Straight, unending roads!](https://preview.redd.it/m12ccy167l7e1.jpg?width=1920&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=20e2d78a05004d94ba0eaef5caf8b34e14b1dc62)

By Sunday morning, I was on the final leg of my journey, riding through **Lonavala** at sunrise. It was a nice experience to see so many motorcycle enthusiasts along the way, waving and sharing an unspoken camaraderie. I reached home in Mumbai by 11 AM, greeted by my family and a sense of accomplishment.

**Reflections on the Ride**

This trip was more than just a journey from Mumbai to Hyderabad; it was an experience that words can barely capture. Riding solo on long, open highways helped me connect with myself, my motorcycle, and the road. The **Royal Enfield Super Meteor 650** was an absolute joy to ride. Its comfort and performance ensured that I never felt tired, even after hours of riding each day.

[Clicked this at a misal dhaba](https://preview.redd.it/gswwux5t6l7e1.jpg?width=1800&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=a59ed0ad0722ccb04ef6b9dadbd9f841c682e64d)

Stopping at roadside vendors to grab fruits or snacks, I had heartwarming conversations with locals. Their curiosity about my journey and aspirations in life added depth to the experience. Riding through villages, I often felt like a spectacle ‚Äî dressed in full riding gear, with cameras and accessories on my bike. People would stare, wave, or give me a thumbs up, and some even asked if I had a YouTube channel! These small moments of connection made the trip even more special.

**Memories to Cherish**

The joy of riding alone, the beauty of open highways, the kindness of strangers, and the thrill of adventure are memories I will cherish forever. This trip not only strengthened my bond with my motorcycle but also gave me a fresh perspective on life. It reminded me of the importance of slowing down, appreciating the journey, and embracing the unknown.

For anyone contemplating a solo motorcycle trip, my advice is simple: prepare well, trust your instincts, and take the plunge. The road will always have a story to tell, and you‚Äôll return with memories that last a lifetime.",3,1734519355.0,royalenfield,0,1.0,False

Here‚Äôs what happened. I (27F) have always had a complicated relationship with my family. They‚Äôve always been the type of people who think any joke is fine as long as someone laughs, no matter who gets hurt. Over the years, I‚Äôve tried to brush it off and not let it bother me too much, but this time, they crossed a line I can‚Äôt ignore.

Recently, I achieved something big in my life: I bought my first home after saving for years. It‚Äôs something I worked incredibly hard for sacrificing vacations, nights out, and basically anything extra to make it happen. I was beyond proud of myself and excited to finally have a place to call my own. Naturally, I wanted to share this milestone with my family, even though our relationship has always been rocky.

A few weeks ago, we had a family dinner to celebrate my new home. Everything seemed fine at first, they congratulated me, asked about the house, and seemed genuinely happy for me. But halfway through the night, my brother (30M) and sister (25F) handed me an envelope. They said it was a ""surprise"" to help me with my house.

I opened it, and inside was what looked like a legal notice stating that my house purchase had been canceled because of a ""clerical error"" and that it was now being sold to someone else. It even had an official looking letterhead, my name, and details about the house. I was in complete shock.

Everyone around the table started laughing, and my brother yelled, ‚ÄúGotcha!‚Äù Turns out, they had faked the letter and thought it would be hilarious to see my reaction. I burst into tears, which only made them laugh harder. They even recorded the whole thing on their phones to post on social media.

When I finally managed to speak, I told them how cruel this was. Buying this house was the biggest thing I‚Äôd ever done, and they turned it into a joke at my expense. Their response? ‚ÄúYou‚Äôre so sensitive. It was just a prank. Lighten up!‚Äù

I left the dinner early, completely heartbroken. A few days later, I decided I‚Äôd had enough. This wasn‚Äôt the first time they‚Äôd pulled a ‚Äúprank‚Äù like this. Over the years, they‚Äôve humiliated me countless times once ruining a job interview outfit by ‚Äúaccidentally‚Äù spilling coffee on it, another time pretending to lose my dog just to see me panic.

I cut off all contact. I didn‚Äôt make a scene, I just stopped responding to messages, blocked them on social media, and declined invites to family events. Now, I‚Äôm getting guilt-tripping messages from extended family saying I‚Äôm being selfish and tearing the family apart. My mom even left me a voicemail crying about how much she misses me and begging me to come back.

But I can‚Äôt bring myself to forgive them. This prank felt like the final straw, and I don‚Äôt see how I can trust them again.

I use friend as a loose term, because i don‚Äôt think we are friends anymore. Anyway, we are both single and he is a younger guy.

We got really close last year, we have a ton of common interest as well. He always sent me mixed signals until one drunken night I confessed that i‚Äôm into him, he was being thrilled about it and we made out passionately. The next day in the office he pulls me a side and tells me that he doesn‚Äôt want a workplace relationship and he is really sorry that he wasn‚Äôt clear about it. I was devastated.

From then onward he became super weird with me and cold, and I felt that he is clearly trying to ignore my presence anytime I was around. No more of just us going out for little coffee breaks, no more cute messages on teams. No nothing. I barely get a hello from him. Unfortunately as we are in the same team, I can‚Äôt avoid him. I tried. But it looks so weird to the others when i eat lunch by myself etc. To make matters even worse there is another girl who is my friend and they happen to work together closely. I can see that even though I know there isn‚Äôt anything going on between them, he seems to fancy her more. Or at least that‚Äôs what it‚Äôs looks like. Calling her the most beautiful and the cutest girl often, especially when we going out drinking and stuff. I try so hard not to care and be cool with it, but holy shit it does send my to fucking jealousy spiral everytime when i can‚Äôt even pretend anymore that i don‚Äôt feel uncomfortable him ignoring me.

I was wondering what do i actually like about him. And i can‚Äôt listen to a single thing. I‚Äôm fully limerent with this guy who is actually a loser in life. I mean he is drunk basically every other night, gambles and even smells bad. I have been told many times that i‚Äôm also way out of his league and yet‚Ä¶ here I‚Äôm completely twisted over him. He sometimes does breadcrumbs me, because oh boy he loves attention. And i hate myself anytime he gives me attention I go on the highest high. 

I truly feel like i‚Äôm the architect of my own misfortune. I feel miserable... and it‚Äôs not like, you know‚Ä¶ getting better by time. No. It‚Äôs day 1 type of misery everyday. I tried to date other people, nothing has worked out‚Ä¶ kind of because of the limerence towards him. I spent literally months fantasizing about having sex with him and the crazy chemistry kissing chemistry we had.

I used to have such a high self esteem, but as of recent it truly went into a dumpster dive. I wish i‚Äôve never let this stupid crush develop. 

I‚Äôve realized that i literally cannot interact with him (especially drunk) without making an absolute fool of myself. If i‚Äôm sober then our conversations are just super awkward. When we are drinking I‚Äôm losing all my self control and i either go tell him that he is a moron or that I love him and want to have sex  with him. There is nothing in between. It‚Äôs literally not healthy for me to be around him.

I know that the main issue is that i feel pretty lonely recently, not much going on in my life and this is why the limerence gives me a dopamine boost. But holy shit it‚Äôs mostly just misery. I often go to work so anxious that I could throw up. I know he doesn‚Äôt want anything to do with me and doesn‚Äôt like me. But for some reason my heart and my ego can‚Äôt accept that. 

‚Ä¶ and it‚Äôs been like this for a year now. Starting to realize that if i don‚Äôt change jobs, i might never get over this. I love my job and my team, but this situation is just getting unbearable and not better.

The only good thing came out of this stupid limerence is me putting a ton of more effort into my looks and had a huge glow up that others have noticed as well. But‚Ä¶ i‚Äôm still dead inside lol

I (30F) and my husband (35M) currently live with my mom. We've been together about 6 years and just had our second wedding anniversary a couple months ago.

He makes good money in the automotive industry and was renting his own place when we first got together. I ended up moving in with him and my first son (he was 5 at the time, now he's 11.) then had another son (4) and a daughter (1). I don't have a job because my boys are homeschooled (we're in the US and I'm terrified of school shootings.)

About 3 years ago, inflation hit. Our rent went from $750 to $1,200 per month. We simply could not afford that and food. So we talked about it together and with both sets of our parents and ultimately decided to move into my mom's house, my childhood home. (His dad struggles with alcohol addiction and he didn't feel safe having a drunk around the kids 24/7, and I agreed.)

The problem my husband has with my mom's place, is that my brother (38M) and the father 34M) of my first son both live in room attached to the garage. My ex and my brother have been trying to save money to get their own place together down the street, but they work at a pizza shop so the pay isn't exactly great so it's taking a while.

My husband absolutely hates sharing a living space with my ex. It's uncomfortable, I understand and have been doing what I can to comfort or reassure or whatever. But he's sick of it.

It all came to a head 2 days ago. My brother started seeing this new chick a few months ago. He recently stayed at her place for about a week. When he (bro) came back, husband got super pissed and went on his usual angry tirade, yelling at me about how he thought my brother was gone permanently, why did mom even allow him to come back, etc.

I'm also about 8 weeks pregnant, and I know it's probably the hormones or whatever but I was tired of it. So I tried calmly explaining that the guys in the garage don't actually hurt anything here. No, they do not pay household bills but neither does my husband. My mom covers ALL the bills from her late husband's pension or something. Idk but she gets a check once a month that barely covers the bills, but it covers them. Now, my husband does buy groceries every week, but the garage guys don't eat here. No idea how they sustain themselves because it's not my business and I honestly don't care that much. I just know they do not eat the food that my husband pays for. The only thing I've seen them consume here is coffee, that they pay for and bring inside to brew. Hell, they usually only come insidthe actual house to use the toilet or talk about the kids stuff, like classwork or what to get them for Christmas. 

Now, me being secretly (I'm planning on surprising my husband with the positive test next week for Christmas) pregnant for the 4th time has got my patience a little thin. So when he started asking me shit like ""how could you just let him move back in?"" I kinda lost my shit, because when he first moved in here, he was acting like he was still in control of everything, like it was his house. That has never sat well with me or mom. So I did my best to stay calm when I told him that he and I have no say in the way my mom runs her house, our names are not on the deed, and he should probably be a little more grateful considering the rent free lifestyle he currently has.

That was not the best thing to say. He lost his whole mind. Screamed, slammed doors, knocked shit on the ground. Full blown toddler tantrum. So I sat back and let him get all his big feelings out so we could talk afterwards. Afterwards never came. He went to bed, went to work the next day and started texting me at lunch, being argumentative. I tried settling the mood and apologized for upsetting him before. That didn't go well either. He keeps accusing me of disrespecting him and our family as a unit. I'm used to that so I just took it for a while until he threatened suicide. 

I have ZERO patience for that shit. If it's legitimate, I'll be supportive of course. But I'm pretty sure this was a manipulation tactic. I turned off my phone until he got home from work and blew up at me. Now he's alternating between blaming me for all of our issues and the silent treatment. Should I apologize again or would it be pointless? Am I the asshole here?",7,1734517959.0,AITH,53,0.59,False

I‚Äôve been trying to stay patient but I finally blew up, and now I‚Äôm wondering if I‚Äôm in the wrong.

My wife has this habit of leaving dishes in unsafe places‚Äîknives, glass dishes, or pans on the stove with the handles turned toward the walkway, (yes when things are cooking/boiling) where they can easily be grabbed. We have a 3-year-old, so I‚Äôve told her multiple times how dangerous this is. But no matter how many times I bring it up, it keeps happening.

What frustrates me even more is that when I remind her, she‚Äôll just say it was ‚Äúan accident‚Äù or that she was ‚Äúin a rush,‚Äù instead of apologizing. To me, it feels dismissive. If she asked me multiple times to fix a habit‚Äîlike cleaning up my hair trimmings in the sink‚ÄîI‚Äôd just apologize if I forgot, not come up with excuses.

The other day, I walked in and saw that she left my only coffee mug from the military‚Äîthe one I use every single day‚Äîon the edge of the counter. For some reason I exploded. I got genuinely pissed, and she looked at me like I was crazy for being so upset over ‚Äújust a mug.‚Äù

Now I‚Äôm second-guessing myself. Was I overreacting? I feel like it‚Äôs not just about the mug‚Äîit‚Äôs about her not taking me seriously when I‚Äôve repeatedly brought this up. Am I blowing this out of proportion?",7,1734517852.0,AmIOverreacting,4,0.89,False

I've never done that before but I'm 2 days past due on my shot because I'm genuinely terrified of needles (i can't take weight loss pills covered by my ins due to heart problems). 

Anyway, my pen jammed! I've never had that happen. I pushed the button. Yay! No pain! But no medicine? I counted to 10. The plunger didn't move. Counted 10 more once, twice. Held for 30 seconds and the plunger never moved. No second click, either. As SOON as I took it off my stomach the plunger descended and medicine sprayed everywhere. 

Could the ice have done something, or was it just a faulty pen? BRB while I cry into my coffee and protein shake. ",1,1734517509.0,Zepbound,6,1.0,False
