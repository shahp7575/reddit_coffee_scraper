# Perfect for Travellers, Campers and Outdoor Enthusiasts

Unlike many household water purifiers that must remain fixed to one location, the **Berkey Water Filter System** is intentionally crafted for mobility. Its compact, stainless steel design allows it to be easily packed, transported and deployed at any destination. Outdoor travellers appreciate its independence from electricity and plumbing, allowing it to function effortlessly in:

·         Campsites and bushland settings

·         Caravan parks and off-grid living

·         Remote cabins or agricultural work sites

·         Boats, yachts and marine environments

·         4WD adventures and extended road trips  
Wherever clean drinking water is needed, the system provides it using nothing more than gravity.

# Use Water From a Wide Range of Sources

One of the most valuable features of the **Berkey Water Filter System** for travellers is its ability to purify water from a wide variety of sources. While many portable filters can only handle lightly treated tap water, the Berkey handles much more. You can safely filter:

·         Bore water (when pre-filtered for large sediment)

·         Rainwater collected during travel

·         River, dam or creek water (suitably pre-filtered)

·         Caravan park tap water, which may vary in quality

·         Tank water at remote properties

·         Town water with chlorine or chemical additives  
By addressing more than 200 contaminants—including bacteria, PFAS, chlorine, heavy metals, sediments, VOCs and microplastics—the **Berkey Water Filter System** ensures you stay hydrated with peace of mind, even when water sources are unpredictable.

# Compact Yet Powerful: Ideal for Caravans and Motorhomes

Space is a premium in caravans, camper trailers and motorhomes, and the **Berkey Water Filter System** is designed with this in mind. The Travel Berkey® and Big Berkey® models offer generous purification capacity while taking up minimal bench space. Their vertical design allows for efficient water storage without consuming valuable room needed for cooking, storage or movement. Even better, the unit can be disassembled for compact storage while travelling, then quickly reassembled when needed.

# A Dependable Solution for Off-Grid Living

Travellers who embrace off-grid living need equipment that is reliable, low-maintenance and functional in remote environments. The **Berkey Water Filter System** excels in these settings. With no power requirements and long-lasting Black Berkey® filters, it continues operating efficiently for months or years without replacement. This independence allows you to enjoy high-quality drinking water in areas without consistent access to clean water or electricity—making it ideal for long-term remote stays or eco-friendly nomadic lifestyles.

# Emergency-Preparedness on the Road

When travelling, unexpected events such as floods, plumbing failures, boil-water alerts or poor-quality water supplies can interrupt access to safe drinking water. The **Berkey Water Filter System** acts as a built-in emergency solution. With its gravity-fed operation, it doesn’t require external infrastructure to continue delivering purified water, ensuring that you're protected from contamination risks even during sudden changes in environmental or supply conditions. For travellers who frequently visit rural or remote areas, this resilience is invaluable.

# Durable Construction for Rugged Adventures

Crafted from robust 304 stainless steel, the **Berkey Water Filter System** withstands the bumps, knocks and vibrations inevitable during road travel. Whether stored in a caravan, 4WD, trailer or on a boat, it remains structurally strong and corrosion-resistant. The components also handle varying temperatures and humidity, making them ideal for Australia’s diverse climates—from tropical heat to outback dryness.

# Easy Operation and Minimal Maintenance

Travel-friendly equipment must be simple to use, and the **Berkey Water Filter System** delivers on convenience. Setting it up at a campsite or caravan park takes only minutes: fill the top chamber, let gravity work and enjoy purified water. The Black Berkey® filters have an exceptionally long lifespan, and any decline in flow rate can be quickly resolved by cleaning the elements—no specialised tools required. Low maintenance makes the Berkey a favourite among long-term travellers and grey nomads.

# Clean Water for Every Part of Your Journey

Whether you're brewing morning coffee on a mountain ridge, filling bottles for a long hike, preparing meals in the caravan or storing purified water for extended off-grid stays, the **Berkey Water Filter System** becomes an essential companion. It ensures that clean, mineral-rich and refreshing water is always available, no matter how far you travel from urban conveniences.

# Take the Comfort of Home With You

Ultimately, the **Berkey Water Filter System** brings the comfort, reliability and health benefits of home-quality drinking water to wherever life takes you. For travellers seeking freedom without compromising on safety, taste or water quality, it offers a powerful, portable and proven solution that supports every adventure—big or small.

## TL;DR

I’m an AI researcher and CS student living in a remote mountain area in Iran, working with unstable 2 Mbps internet, censorship, sanctions and old copper cables – while Silicon Valley celebrates Gemini 3 and the “singularity”.  

This is not a story of pity. It’s a field report from the invisible frontline: people who run barefoot on burning rails just to avoid disappearing from the future.

## Prologue: Data Dancing on the Edge of a Knife

It’s 3:42 AM.

Outside my window, in one of the most remote mountain regions of Iran, the world is so silent I can hear my own blood moving through my veins. Here, night is not just the absence of light; it’s a physical wall. A hard boundary.  

The only sounds cutting through the silence are the wind slamming itself against the shaky window and the fan of an old laptop trying to take off like a tired airplane.

At this exact second, about 11,000 kilometers away in Silicon Valley, Google engineers are probably popping champagne. The air is full of expensive coffee and hot server racks.

**Why?**  
Because *Gemini 3* was just born.

Developers in San Francisco, London and Tokyo are posting screenshots of real-time answers, debating “the singularity” and the end of the human era.

My reality is not “the singularity”.  
My reality is the existential philosophy of a spinning **Loading** circle.

My internet connection is an unstable 2 Mbps.  
Every byte that wants to enter my 10 m² room must pass through:

- layers of national censorship,  
- international sanctions,  
- and decaying copper wires installed decades ago.

I click *Login* and wait. 4 minutes and 12 seconds.

In those 4 minutes:

- someone in New York used Gemini 3 to outline a novel,  
- a startup in Berlin debugged a critical production bug,  
- and I am here, bargaining with the gods of technology so my VPN doesn’t drop.

This is not a tragic story about deprivation. I don’t need pity.  
This is a story about an **invisible war** – between those on the Maglev train to the future, and those of us running barefoot on the rails just to stay in sight.

## Chapter 1: Rural Cyberpunk

Welcome to my room. This is where **Tawana Network** was born.

If you’re expecting a minimalist RGB setup with curved monitors, you’re in the wrong movie.

This is the real cyberpunk: **High Tech, Low Life.**

- Charger cables fixed with tape.  
- A pile of printed English textbooks and papers, downloaded page by page over years, stacked like columns of an ancient temple.  
- A notebook full of hand-written Python and ML algorithms, because sometimes the power goes out and I refuse to let my ideas die with the monitor.

My physical body lives here.  
My **consciousness** does not.

My mind floats inside **Big Data**, in research repos and academic papers. I’m a CS student at *University of the People (UoPeople)* – a place that gave people like me, living in the blind spots of the world map, a tiny opening to breathe.

When I wrote my paper **“AI and Human Pain: From Pixels to Perception”**, the internet would cut for hours. I wasn’t “studying” pain. I was literally **typing pain**.

I didn’t *read* about latency in a networking textbook. I *lived* it.

You might ask:

> “Why the hell are you worrying about *AI ethics* in a village where drinking water is sometimes rationed?”

Because we are not lab rats.  
We are the **lost architects** of the future.

If we – the people on the margins – don’t equip ourselves with the language of algorithms, the algorithms will quietly delete us. Not physically, but existentially.

We become **outliers** the models are trained to ignore.

I work with OSINT, cybersecurity and AI not for fun, not for a comfy tech job, but to remain **visible**. To prove to the system that geography is not destiny.

---

## Chapter 2: Meeting God in the Digital Limbo

Finally… the page loads.

Gemini 3’s interface appears. Minimal. Calm. Deceptively gentle.

My hands shake – not from the mountain cold but from adrenaline. I’m about to access a system built with billions of dollars, through a 2 Mbps artery that could collapse at any moment.

I don’t have time to ask it for poems or toy code.

I type my first prompt:

> *“Analyze the provided dataset of internet censorship patterns in the Middle East and propose a recursive neural network architecture specifically designed to detect and bypass high-entropy packet filtering. Explain the ethical implications using Utilitarianism.”*

I hit Enter.

Spinning circle again.

10 seconds. I hear my heartbeat in my ears.  
30 seconds.  

Did the VPN die?  
Did my IP get flagged?  
Did Google silently cut me off?

Then suddenly: **rain**.

Code. Architectural diagrams. Ethical analysis. Philosophical reasoning.  
Lines of thought I can build on.

Tears fill my eyes.

This is not “just a response”. This is **power**.

This is Moses’ staff, pulled out of the stone with a 2 Mbps connection from a forgotten mountain.

In that moment, I am no longer “a random kid in a poor village”.  
I am on the same playing field as a senior researcher at MIT’s CSAIL. We are both plugged into the same source.

That’s the kind of **radical democracy of knowledge** I’m fighting for.

---

## Chapter 3: The Two Layers of My Life

On paper, my life looks clean:

- Google Scholar & Zenodo profiles,  
- academic-looking papers about internet censorship,  
- GitHub projects with neat code,  
- a CS student talking in academic English.

That’s **Layer 1: The Facade.**

Layer 2 is different:

- Waking up at 3 AM to download a 300 MB tutorial video because at that hour, speeds go from 20 KB/s to 50 KB/s.  
- Skipping meals to afford another internet package.  
- Sitting in a Zoom class with my American professor, pretending to listen while the video has been frozen for minutes. Smiling. Nodding. Faking “I hear you”, then spending hours later trying to reconstruct the lecture from recorded slides.

Deprivation, for me, is not a barrier. It’s a **catalyst.**

You in Silicon Valley, Zurich or Toronto *choose* to work in AI.  
I’m **forced** to – it’s my only path out.

For me, learning AI and data science is not a career option.  
It’s a **prison break plan**.

I use Gemini 3 and LLMs to buy time.  
If my internet is 10x slower than yours, my mind has to be 100x faster.

AI summarizes books I can’t legally access, optimizes my code, and acts as my mentor when there’s literally no one within 500 km who even knows what PyTorch is.

## Chapter 4: A 5-Year Roadmap to the Impossible

No, I don’t just want to be a freelance coder making a bit of money in dollars.

That would be an insult to the pain it took to get here.

My roadmap is insane on purpose. Let this Reddit post be a witness.

**Phase 1 – Capture the Fortress of Knowledge (Now–2026)**  
Finish my BSc at UoPeople with not just grades, but a serious research portfolio.

- Target: at least two Q1-level papers in top-tier journals (e.g., Nature Machine Intelligence, IEEE Transactions).  
- Focus: **LLMs & AI for low-resource, high-latency environments**.

I want to do research with this 2 Mbps line that people at Stanford might one day cite when they plan communication for Mars missions.

**Phase 2 – Direct assault on the peaks (2026–2027)**  
I’m not interested in the usual long route of “BSc → MSc → maybe PhD if lucky”.

I want **Direct Track to PhD**.

Target universities (yes, I’m saying it out loud): **Harvard, MIT, Stanford, ETH Zurich.**

Not because I fetishize their names. But because they are the current centers of gravity.  

My CV won’t say “top private high school”.  
It will say: *“learned to build space-age architectures with stone-age infrastructure.”*

Top schools say they want **“resilience”** and **“grit”**. Fine. Let’s see.

**Phase 3 – The Return of Prometheus**

I’m not leaving to escape.  
I’m leaving to **steal the fire and come back.**

I want to grow **Tawana Network** from a personal project into an actual **think tank** focused on:

- AI ethics,  
- digital rights,  
- and access to knowledge in places like Iran, MENA, and the Global South.

I want kids in villages in Kenya, Afghanistan, Iran, India… to be able to reach the **essence of knowledge** without needing a VPN and fiber internet.

I want the next AI systems to understand **human pain**, not just loss functions.

Because their creators knew pain for real.

---

## Chapter 5: The Last Signal

You, reading this, might be sitting on an ergonomic Herman Miller chair, with 5G internet that’s a thousand times faster than mine. Maybe you’re annoyed because your espresso wasn’t perfect this morning.

I’m not judging you.

But I am sending you a signal from a future you haven’t seen yet.

A future where:

- talent is no longer buried under its birthplace,  
- access is a right, not a luxury,  
- and “outliers” refuse to stay invisible.

My name is **Tawana** – a name my mother chose in hope of “ability” in hard times.

I’m telling you:

> **We are coming.**

We, the **digital shadows**.  
We, the researchers of dark nights and dial-up-level connections.  
We, who hold back the firewalls with one hand and write code with the other.

If I can synchronize with Gemini 3 on a 2 Mbps line from a cold room in a mountain village and still aim for chairs at Harvard or MIT…

What’s your excuse for being average?

When Google introduced Gemini 3, the world took one step forward.

When I connected to it from here, my world **exploded**.

This is not the end of the story.  
It’s not even the beginning.

It’s just the sound of a **seatbelt click** before the rocket launches.

I’m ready.  
Is the world?

I am exhausted and in pain and it has stopped me from writing and doing anything of note today. Funny thing, yesterday I was so close to remarking to you about how much better my back and shoulder has been only for me to wake up with it the damn thing as agonizing as it was half a month ago when I first started having issue. I have no fucking idea what changed. The pain has traveled all the way to my elbow now and I can barely stand to type this much.

I also woke up early because the hydro maintenance man was coming to today to do a check up. The time he was set to arrive was fluid and in case he came early, Mother wanted me to wake up and get washed and dressed sooner than I usually would. So I do. Only for the man to arrive at 2 p.m. So I made myself even more exhausted and foul-mood than my shoulder already would have made me for no reason. I am so tired than I had a second coffee in the middle of the after noon. I never have more than two cups a day, one in the morning and one in the evening. But I was so desperate to wake myself up, at least enough for me to read over my work, that I had more coffee and guess what? It has done nothing. I feel even more tired if anything. The moment I finish writing this, I'll have a third. I doubt it will help but I'd really like to write something tonight. A single sentence at least.

Today sucked. It either has to start getting better or just put me out of my bloody misery already, whatever comes first.

Kia ora!

I’ve been wondering how people around New Zealand like their coffee. Do you usually have it with milk or sugar, or do you prefer it black? And what kind of coffee do you buy for home (supermarket beans, local roasts, instant, pods, anything else?)

I’m also curious about how you make it day-to-day. Do you use a plunger, moka pot, espresso machine, filter, or something else? And if you buy beans or grounds from cafés, which ones do you rate?

For me, I usually make plunger coffee. Most of the time I drink it straight, but if I’m skipping breakfast and lunch, I’ll make ~300ml cup with milk and sugar to keep me going.

Suddenly, I found myself in a meeting room in front of a panel of seven people. All of them were sitting around a huge table, staring at me. And absolutely no one had told me anything.

The first few minutes went by normally, but then the dead silence began. They'd throw a question, I'd answer, and then... Nothing. Just a room full of people writing in their notebooks. There was one guy smiling at me as if to encourage me, but the rest looked like they were about to fall asleep on me.

And to top it all off, a guy walked in fifteen minutes late, made himself a coffee from the corner, and sat down without saying a single word.

I was trying to make eye contact with each one of them, keep track of who was who, and pretend to be composed. But honestly, by the time the fifth person asked me to clarify a specific point, I felt like my brain was running on dial-up.

In the end, the anxiety disappeared and turned into complete exhaustion. I wasn't nervous anymore. I had just shut down. It was that deep exhaustion of 'Earth, open up and swallow me whole right now.'",1,1763513514.0,jobhunting,1,1.0,False

1p0tfc3,https://www.reddit.com/r/dontstarve/comments/1p0tfc3/the_lowest_possible_speed_what_happens_if_you_hit/,The Lowest Possible Speed: What happens if you hit negative speed?,"Has anyone tested what happens when you actually hit negative speed multiplier?

  
Because looking at the numbers, it seems doable in singleplayer Don't Starve.  
This is the formula used in singleplayer.

S=(b+A)(1+M)

S = final speed

b = base speed

A = flat changes like coffee

M = sum of all multipliers

  
Since there are no negative flat speed changes in this game, we can ignore A.

S=b(1+M)

But the thing is, M can definitely go lower than -1.

For example, if we are playing Shipwrecked, we can use trawl net (up to -25%) against Strong Wind (-40%) while wearing a Marble Suit (-30%) and Ice Cube (-10%) and cross the Ink Patch made by Quacken (-70%). Which is way below -100%.

Or, if we are playing Hamlet, we can hop worlds to find a Marble Suit (-30%), wear Piggyback (-20%) and a Fancy Helmet (-10%), and have a stroll during the Heavy Fog (up to -60%). That's also below -100%.



And for those who are curious, DST uses a different speed formula.

S=b\*(1+m1)\*(1+m2)...\*(1+mn)

S = final speed

b = base speed

There is no flat speed change in DST, and instead of adding all the multipliers like in singleplayer, they multiply each and every multipler m1, m2, m3... in DST (precisely so that you can never achieve negative speed).

So looking at the differences between these 2 formulas, I am assuming that there was some issue regarding the negative speed so the devs modified it for multiplayer?

  
FYI, the lowest speed possible in DST is when,

Wimpy Wolfgang (0.9x) walks over a Antlion Sinkhole (0.3x) that is covered in Spider Web (0.6x) during the Sandstorm (0.4x) while wearing an Ice Cube (0.9x) and carrying a Glass Castle (0.15x). Which is 0.052488, 0.87% speed of Wilson.",2,1763513394.0,dontstarve,0,1.0,False

With the cats I can't really have any open houseplants, but I do have this little terrarium on my coffee table. That's the only green thing I've got with me unfortunately.



Most of this furniture was free from Facebook or family/friends. There's not a specific theme going on but nothing seems *too* out of place imo. 

  
Yes that's a lot of whiskey on my kitchen counter - I just got back from a trip to England/Scotland and brought home a bunch of bottles. I've set a purchase hiatus for myself until my friends and I kill these bottles and clear out my shelf. Should take \~12 months I'd say. 

  
I'm proud of my little tea collection, I wish I had a dedicated cabinet or shelf to display it all properly.

1p0tca9,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating_advice/comments/1p0tca9/aita_for_cutting_off_my_mentorturnedgirlfriend/,AITA for cutting off my mentor-turned-girlfriend after she repeatedly mocked my disability and then smeared me?,"I appreciate literally any input! I (24F) am a second-year law student. When I started law school my first year, I joined an LGBTQIA+ student organization that had just created a mentorship program. I signed up because I was overwhelmed and struggling academically and really needed guidance. I ended up being paired with the club’s then vice president (fake name: Alice (24F)).
Before I even met her, multiple people warned me she was a gossip, messy, and talked poorly about anyone she felt did her dirty. That made me nervous, so I didn’t respond quickly to her initial messages. She took all her other mentees out for coffee, but for me, she asked me to dinner at the only nice restaurant in town for drinks, dinner, and dessert. Prior to going to dinner I had heard some gossip about how she was interested in me and she was also liking my Instagram posts from years back on multiple occasions late at night. When I got to the dinner she very quickly crossed many boundaries and made it blatantly obvious that she was interested in one thing and one thing only. She leaned across the table and asked about my sexual orientation and even asked if I’d ever slept with an Indian woman. I tried to laugh it off and just pretend that we were just being friendly girls because I was new, drowning in school, and didn’t know how to shut it down. She continued making sexual and obvious remarks for the whole several hours we were together at the restaurant. During dinner she kept saying she wanted to ask me “something big” but it was “too soon” and kept bringing it up and hemming and hawing obviously wanting me to be very interested in what she had to ask me. I was terrified she’d ask to sleep with me or be FWB, so I told her she could ask another time. The literal next day another student who I was friendly with told me she had already been telling people she wanted to be FWB with me. I was mortified - this is law school, these are future colleagues, and I am very intentional about not being involved in any drama or anything that could be viewed as unprofessional.
A friend’s partner, who had been FWB with her, warned me repeatedly that she never picks up on social cues, would talk badly about me if she felt like she had been wronged (which apparently happens a lot), and wouldn’t leave me alone because she could not take a hint. He asked me if I needed help with addressing some of the things he was seeing going on (I personally told him nothing about this situation). She continued to like my Instagram posts late at night. At a mentor/mentee event she hosted, she told me afterward that she and her friends created the whole event “just so she could see me.” When I left the event early because I did not want to be there, she insisted on walking me out, got into my car and immediately started asking me what my kinks were (again I just played dumb like I didn’t know she was interested and this was just a girly convo). I was dating someone I genuinely liked at the time, so this was extremely uncomfortable.
Later she admitted she made a Full blown PowerPoint of our texts and my photos (?) and showed it to her over 30-year-old friends so they could decide if I liked her back. This honestly was so embarrassing to me – again this is law school. I even met with another mentor and asked whether mentors were allowed to date their mentees because I was planning on reporting her due to how uncomfortable I was, but since the program was brand new, there were no rules yet. The mentor immediately told Alice I asked this question and Alice took it as a sign that I was interested in her.
Despite all of this, during finals I was desperate for academic support and reached out for outlines. I brought her coffee because I felt like if she thought I liked her she’d would actually do her job and mentor me which she honestly should have been doing in the first place.
Months later, after I broke things off with the guy I was dating, she and I began spending more time together. I thought maybe I actually liked her, she was always very understanding of my busy schedule and just being overwhelmed all the time at school. She told me she had feelings for me. I told her I was developing a crush, but I move very slowly, I put school/family/friends first, and I had previously avoided her because of the concerning things people told me about her.
For more context: I’m disabled from a past car accident (you cannot see it unless I remove clothing) and I’ll likely need a foot amputation later in life. I did bring this up a couple months into knowing her when I thought it was appropriate (I personally do not share this with anyone I am not close with as it is personal and private). Weeks later she started randomly talking about Bethany Hamilton (the well-known amputee surfer) and mocking her brutally and making fun of certain events that the movie was showing how this amputee was adapting to normal life in a disabled body. There was a specific scene in the movie where Bethany is attempting to make breakfast for her family and Alice thought it was hilarious how “stupid and ridiculous” she looked trying to cut up an orange with only one hand and she had to hold it between her feet. She dragged this on for at least five straight minutes while I just sat there obviously uncomfortable while Alice is just laughing at this poor girl. After she was done making her jokes, she said her and her brother thought the movie was hilarious because they have dark humor. It wasn’t dark humor; it was blatant ableism. Additionally she had just learned that I will require an amputation in the future to continue to walk in my adult life.
I told her this made me uncomfortable. She apologized but kept doing similar things. I limp without shoes because of my disability, and she repeatedly pointed out my limp or asked why I was walking like that or why I was hopping around and telling me I looked dumb. She once pushed me on the stairs trying to be “playful,” and even when I had to stop her and say “Hey be careful I am disabled and I fall all the time easily” she continued to push me “playfully”. It was so disturbing and upsetting to me to continually have to remind the person who is supposed to be my partner that I was disabled or a cripple and I personally do not want to have to bring that up all the time.
Whenever I came to her place, I brought slippers because walking without supportive shoes is extremely painful and hard for me to get around. She watched me limp around and never once offered a pair, even when she had extras. One day I hesitated to go inside because I forgot mine and told her “I’m in a lot of pain and I forgot to bring slippers” and she looked me dead in the eyes and mocked me in a high-pitched voice, repeating “I’M in a lot of PAIN” sarcastically. For context: I had literally told her I was struggling to walk and felt unsafe without support; she responded by mocking me.
She invited me to a double date at someone’s house, where I was asked to take off my therapeutic shoes. I had a very hard and painful time walking (I mask extremely well due to learning how to walk again over the course of a year), while she casually put on the host’s (one of her close friend’s) slippers. She also sent me Instagram posts of physical games and sent them to me saying “I would totally beat you.” I finally snapped and said, “Yeah, because I was in a car accident and I’m permanently disabled and cannot function the way my body used to.” She responded, “Okay, then we can blindfold me and give you a 5-second head start.” These comments happened consistently although I am only listing several to give context.
I had to block her because she kept posting things clearly aimed at me - stuff like “All my emotionally intelligent friends think you’re wrong,” “My ex is emotionally immature,” “You lied to make people dislike me, and I have to lie to make people like you” “You played in my face,”  “No women wants to date a Indian women” and a bunch of other things calling me a piece of shit. It’s humiliating to be associated with.
And I’m only now finding out she’s been telling other people, including people I don’t even know, about my car accident and disability. I never gave her permission to share that nor have I ever shared any personal details about her trauma with a single one of my friends.
So… AITA for ending things? Am I overreacting over the comments she made? Because part of me feels insane, but another part feels like this was months of inappropriate behavior, boundary violations, ableism, and now a bizarre smear campaign - and I don’t understand how breaking up just transformed into this especially when she was telling me that she thought everything was perfect during our relationship and felt stupid that I was ending it because she messed up and also asked if we could try again in the future? I don’t understand what I did, I feel like an asshole to elicit these types of emotions.

Ever wake up feeling like you've aged approximately 50 years *overnight*? 🙋‍♂️ Yeah, me too. Especially after hitting the big 5-0 (and then some!). It's like my body forgets how to be a functioning human while I'm sleeping.

But seriously, that morning stiffness? Ugh. It can really put a damper on your plans for a day full of fun and freedom, right? Golf, gardening, chasing the grandkids...it all gets tougher when you're creaking like an old door.

So, I've been experimenting (read: desperately searching) for something that actually *works* to get rid of that stiffness, without having to spend hours stretching or popping pills. And guess what? I think I've cracked the code!

It's this ridiculously simple, 5-minute routine. I know, I know, sounds too good to be true, right? But trust me on this one.

Here's the deal:

*   **Neck Rolls:** Just gentle circles, both directions. Feel that tension melt away. Imagine you are saying ""no"" and ""yes"" in a gentle way.

*   **Shoulder Shrugs:** Up, back, down, repeat. Pretend you just heard the most outrageous gossip.

*   **Arm Circles:** Small circles, then big circles. Forward, then backward. Channel your inner swimmer!

*   **Torso Twists:** Stand with your feet shoulder-width apart, and gently twist from side to side. Keep your movements smooth and controlled.

*   **Leg Swings:** Hold onto a chair or wall for balance and swing each leg forward and backward, then side to side. Don't overdo it, gentle movement is key here!

That’s it! Five minutes. That's less time than it takes to brew a decent cup of coffee. And the difference it makes is HUGE. Seriously, I went from feeling like a rusty robot to feeling…well, maybe not *young*, but definitely less *old*. 😉

Remember that camping trip where my back seized up and I couldn’t even pitch the tent? Learned my lesson the hard way, folks! Now this routine is my daily saver.

Want more details? Need a visual guide to make sure you're doing everything right? Well, ""We believe in strongest people.""

They helped OK but of course I got drunk last night as soon as I got home and woke up this morning with the quivers. I ended up taking like 2 shots before work to even out and also packed console beers. I pulled into the parking lot and a buddy I haven’t seen in a while was walking into the building, I rolled the window down and made a “I’ll jerk you off for $5” joke. (We’re both females 40s but we have that kind of sense of humor). So she walks around and jumps in my car to catch up and immediately says “Ew! It smells like liquor in here!” 

Fuck me. I looked confused and was like “maybe someone spilled a beer in here this weekend.” 

So I get inside the building and immediately put on a ton of smelly lotion and drink coffee. I keep the door to my office open so the stanch doesn’t build up. I wear a Covid mask when I visited with patients and coworkers. Then later I realized that I forgot to put on deodorant and I was wearing a sweater over my scrubs. My right armpit smelled like cat piss and my left armpit smelled like sun baked open catchup packet on McDonalds parking lot. 

I threw my sweater under my coworkers desk and tried to get my deodorant out of my office.

Some days, I don't want to train my dog either. Not because I don't love them, but because life is a lot. There are mornings when the leash feels heavier than usual, when ""just five minutes"" turns into ""maybe tomorrow,"" and when I'd rather scroll than shape a sit. Here's what l've learned though: the best training doesn't happen during the picture-perfect sessions. It happens in the in-between moments. While you're making coffee, brushing your teeth, walking to the mailbox. The real magic is in weaving training into life until it stops feeling like work and starts feeling like communication. You don't need an hour of drills or a perfect plan. You need ten seconds of intention. Ask for a sit before you open the door. Call your dog over while you're unloading the dishwasher. Reward calm when your dog settles next to you instead of nagging them for pacing. That's training. The dogs who thrive aren't being micromanaged all day. They're living with people who see opportunity in the ordinary. Who don't separate ""life"" from ""training."" Who build trust one grocery trip, one leash clip, one deep breath at a time. And if you feel guilty for not doing ""enough,"" let me take that weight off your shoulders. You don't have to do more. You just have to do with purpose. Training is a relationship, not a routine. It's less about what you schedule and more about what you repeat. The little things done consistently beat the big things done occasionally every..single..time. So, if today's walk was just a loop around the block, that's okay. If the only thing you practiced was patience while your dog sniffed the same spot for two minutes, that's okay too. Because showing up, even in small ways is still showing up. Your dog doesn't need perfect. They need present. And sometimes, that starts with sipping your coffee, taking a breath, and deciding that today's training looks like living life together.",1,1763513017.0,puppy101,0,1.0,False

I'm working on saving up money for about a year before attempting to get an apartment close to my college campus. My brother (22m) also lives here as well. We both have chores and things to do around the house, as we live here and it's obvious that as adults that we need to help. I do the dishes, coffee, wiping and dusting surfaces, and sweeping. My father handles most of the laundry as his office is downstairs with the machines. My brother has two chores, cleaning the cat litter and taking out the trash. 

And yet, even though he only has these two chores, they never seem to get done. The trash can pile up for days, the litter can sit there in stink for a whole week before anything is done about it. I've given in and just done these chores myself because I couldnt handle it, but a few weeks ago i decided i wasnt going to coddle him anymore. He has two chores and he cant get them done, he's not a functioning adult. Me and my father agreed that he can be a baby a lot of the time. BTW, he has a job, but only goes to it 2 days out of the week. The rest of the time he's sitting in his room on his pc. Thats why im more pissed about this than I know I should be, because he has so much free time and can't do these two simple things. 

What I decided to do was to stop doing his chores for him. I let the trash sit there, let the litter get nasty as hell, cause I mean, wasn't my job, yeah? And when my dad got mad at us for the trash and litter being disgusting, I pointed out that it was meant to be my brother doing those things. Thats what we agreed upon after my mother left, how its been done for 4 years now. And yet, when I said that to my father, he got angry at me and said I should have done the chores, helped out my brother. I was told I was being annoying and a brat, that my brother helped by buying groceries, that was his 'main job'. I didn't argue at the time, just went to my room to cool off, not wanting to say something I'd regret. But my brother doesnt help with groceries, I know that cause I buy them. I go to the store, I pick stuff up. The only thing my brother buys is cat food, and thats only once in a while. 

But was I the asshole? Should I have just done the chores?",2,1763512850.0,AITAH,0,1.0,False

At some point while we were moving up the stairs, a dim red light began saturating the air. But it never got too bright, just enough for us to be able to make out each other’s figures as we moved. I could feel Kijoon tapping on my shoulder from behind. I was about to turn around when he told me not to.

“Keep looking ahead,” he whispered. “Don’t look at it.”

“Look at what?” I whispered back.

“There’s somebody following us.”

“What do you mean?”

“There’s an extra person here.”

I looked up, counted the figures ahead of me. Three.

Everybody was in front of me. The person behind me wasn’t Kijoon. There shouldn’t have been anybody behind me at all.

I could still hear them breathing. I told everyone that we needed to start running.

Nadia didn’t miss a beat and began bolting up the steps while the rest of us trailed close behind her. I’m not sure how long we ran for, but by the time that the stairs ended and gave way to another corridor, my legs had nothing left to give.

We looked back down, waited for something to come charging up at us.

But nothing ever did. So we walked on.

Now it was back to the ceaseless maze of halls. It looked fairly identical to the ones that had come before save for the red glow, which had persisted up from the stairs. I asked Nadia what the red was supposed to mean. She told me she wasn’t sure. That it hadn’t come up in any of the reports she’d gone through. She then told me that there were hardly any similarities between the reports at all. Each experience had been unique. Some mentioned going through rooms the size of auditoriums, while others mentioned having to squeeze through tube-like spaces. There were also accounts of even stranger, more abstract areas. Things like a series of rooms floating in empty space, connected only by both horizontal and vertical ladders. Narrow walkways suspended over massive pools of black water. One even mentioned a room where they could see the stars and the moon above. But they knew that they weren’t outside. Because they could still see the walls.

One of the few things that these reports had in common with each other was Sinclair. In each instance, he had been there. As far as the UK and as close as Mexico. All physical descriptions of him had been congruent with the man that we’d seen with our own eyes, though he’d apparently gone by a different name each time.

I asked her what kind of info she was able to dig up on the guy. She shook her head and told me absolutely nothing at all. She knew that records about him existed. Police and military reports, government files. But they were too classified for her to be able to access.

She said that she’d tried getting the police involved. She’d found another flyer advertising the house a few weeks prior. She’d responded to it and once she’d gotten an address, she’d marched down to the station and told them to investigate it. She’d told them about Anton, the building, all of the missing people. They’d simply told her that they’d look into it.

And then they went radio silent. No follow ups, nothing. She said it was almost like they were actively avoiding her.

I then asked her how she was planning on finding her brother. Did she even know where to look? She told me that Dixie had given her just enough information to be motivated to try. That she wasn’t necessarily confident, but it was worth a go. Because she wouldn’t be able to forgive herself otherwise.

We continued on through the corridors until it opened up into a larger space. This one looked the lobby in any old office building. Stale light, grey carpets, white walls. The faint smell of filtered air and old coffee. There was a couch and a few single chairs scattered in front of a receptionist’s deck.

There was a bowl of candies sitting on the desk and as I stared at it, I realized how hungry I’d become.

“I wouldn’t do it,” Nadia told me. “It’s probably not candy.”

I decided to hold off on taking one.

There were a set of doors to our right and an elevator to our left. We decided to go through the doors, opening them up to find an impossibly vast office space. Rows of cubicles, desks, water coolers that seemed to stretch on in perpetuity.

It didn’t seem so promising so we went back into the lobby, considered trying the elevator instead. But then we could hear a faint mechanical hum, the muffled straining of cables. We looked at the elevator and saw the up arrow illuminated above the doors. Something was headed up towards us. We weren’t keen on finding out what it was so we headed back towards the office space.

As we were walking, we could hear a ding, the doors sliding open behind us. We turned around and saw a figure marching towards us in the distance. Looked like an extremely tall man in a suit. Way too tall, his head nearly scraping the ceiling even though his back was heavily slouched. He had pale, clammy skin and long, greasy hair. As he got closer, we could make out this horrible expression of malice on his face. It was the way you’d look at somebody who you really wanted to hurt.

We turned away, started moving faster. And he continued to follow us. Over time, we noticed that his speed always remained constant. He never slowed down, never sped up. We found that we were able to outpace him if we maintained a very light jog. But after everything we’d already been through, this wasn’t exactly an easy thing to do.

Eventually our bodies would quit on us. No escaping that.

The office stretched on and everything looked the same. But eventually, we came across somebody sitting in one of the cubicles.

It was a young woman in a dress shirt and dress pants. She was sat in front of the computer, furiously typing away at the keyboard despite the screen displaying nothing but an empty, white light.

We tried asking her what she was doing and who she was. But she didn’t respond. She remained staring at the screen with her eyes glazed over, as if her consciousness existed entirely separate from us.

But with the man getting closer, we couldn’t afford to linger.

We moved on, starting to see more and more people in the cubicles. There were dozens, maybe hundreds of them. All dressed in the same shirt and pants and all typing away with that same empty stare.

We turned around, watching as the man moved past them without paying them any mind. We tried to ignore the implications of it.

We upped our pace but after a few more minutes, Nadia suddenly stopped dead in her tracks. Now she was staring intently into one of the cubicles.

We caught up to her and found her staring at a boy that seemed to be no older than sixteen or seventeen. We asked her who it was. She told us that it was one of her brother’s friends. He’d gone into the building with him that day. He’d also disappeared.

She walked into the cubicle and crouched down beside him.

“Hey buddy, where’s Anton?” she asked him. “Is he around here somewhere? Did you see where he went?”

He didn’t respond.  

“Where is he?” she repeated, now an edge in her voice. “When’s the last time you saw him?”

We had been standing still for too long and the man was getting uncomfortably close. I told her that we needed to start moving again.

She told me to give her a second and then grabbed the boy’s shoulder. She began shaking him.

“Hey!” she shouted at him. “Wake up! We need to find Anton! We need to get out of here!”

He wouldn’t budge. She tried pulling him away but he stopped typing and grabbed the desk, anchoring himself in place. His expression changed. Now he looked terrified, feverishly shaking his head while his eyes remained glued to the monitor.

The man was now about ten seconds away from reaching us and I stressed this fact to her.

Nadia cursed, slammed the table in frustration. She then backed out of the cubicle and we started running. The man had gotten so close to us that we could start to smell him. The best way I can describe the scent is a combination of ammonia and rotting fruit.

We continued on, alternating between jogging and speedwalking. But at this point, it was starting to feel like a losing battle. We were no closer to escaping the guy from when we started. And our bodies were feeling it. Knees aching, muscles heavy as lead, feet throbbing in our shoes.

Soon Josh had stopped moving. He caught his breath, shook his head.

“Fuck this,” he said. “I’m done with this shit.”

“What do you mean?” I asked him.

“I’m done with it,” he repeated. “I’m not playing this fucking game anymore.”

Nadia told him that we needed to keep moving.

He looked at her. “What did you say before? If you don’t allow this place to break you, it’ll set you free? Something like that?”

“I just meant that we shouldn’t give up,” she said to him “That as long as we move forward, we’ll eventually escape.”

“It’s fear, right?” he continued. “If we have no fear, then this place has no power over us.”

“No,” Nadia told him. “No, it’s not like that at all.”

“This isn’t going to end until we make it end.”

He turned around, began walking towards the man. We tried pulling him back but he yanked himself free.

“I’m not scared anymore,” he told us. “I’m getting the fuck out of here.”

He looked at the man as he approached. He raised his arms.

“Come get me!” he screamed at him. “I’m not fucking scared of you! I’m not-“

The man bent down and his jaw unhinged what had to be several feet. He grabbed Josh by the waist and picked him up and then shoved him into his throat.

I’m not sure how else to describe what happened. It was like there was a black hole waiting just beyond his mouth. Josh disappeared straight down into it. There was no struggle and the man didn’t even swallow. He just closed his mouth and continued on towards us.

We ran again. And this time, we didn’t stop until we finally reached the other end of this incomprehensible space. Waiting for us in the wall was another elevator. And it was a sight for sore eyes.

We only had the option to go down and so we pressed the button. And then we waited.

We’d managed to create a good amount of distance between us and the man so he was still a good ways away. But the elevator still hadn’t arrived and he was only getting closer.

We pressed the button again, as if it would help anything. And then again and again. We looked around to see if we’d missed a door, another elevator, a set of stairs, any kind of opening. But there was nothing.

Eventually the elevator did open up. And just in time. We rushed in there and the doors closed right as the man was unhinging his jaw again. That rotting ammonia smell lingered in the cabin and it was so strong I had to swallow back some bile.

We could feel ourselves start to move down. It was pitch black inside.

“You guys still there?” Kijoon asked.

We told him that we were. He seemed relieved.

I felt around the walls and it seemed like they were made out of glass. After a while, the cabin suddenly filled up with a dim, red light. It was a bit brighter than the light back in the corridors. But much more ominous once we realized the source of it.

We appeared to be descending down towards a vast, sprawling metropolis. We could see skyscrapers of varying shapes and sizes all packed tight together, stretching out in every direction as far as we could see.  It was hard to grasp the scale of the place. We must’ve been several miles up in the air and yet there were still buildings around that dwarfed us.

The sky above was dark and the only illumination came from the blood red lights emanating from the windows in the buildings. And then we realized that there wasn’t actually a sky at all. No stars, no moon, no clouds. Just a black sheet.

We looked down at the streets below and saw no cars, no people, no streetlights. Not even any sidewalks. But then we looked further out in the distance and saw a lone figure shambling towards the base of the elevator. And then we saw another one. And then more and more. Soon they were appearing in waves, crowds of dark shapes closing in on us from every direction.

We took a closer look and saw that some were crawling, others sprinting at full speed. Some appeared to be missing limbs while others were much more bizarre in appearance. Some didn’t seem human at all.

It wasn’t much longer before the streets below were completely filled. As if this were some kind of fucked up parade. The figures continued to flood in, becoming packed so tightly together that they were now scrambling over and atop each other. Soon they’d started climbing up the buildings that surrounded us.

The elevator began to descend slightly faster. Before long, we’d reach the bottom. Which was something that all three of us came to an unspoken agreement absolutely could not happen.

We looked around the cabin for a solution. There was nothing obvious at first. But we didn’t panic. After dealing with this place for as long as we had, we’d become hardened in a way. I’m sure that if we’d been in this situation earlier on, we would’ve shut down, given up.

But now we knew that this place had rules. Perhaps we didn’t understand them, but it didn’t seem likely that this elevator was meant to be a death sentence. Especially not after how far we’d come.

“The wall behind us,” I said.

Since it was made out of glass, we could see the floors passing by. If we timed it right, we could jump onto one.

I stepped back and kicked the glass as hard as I could. And I kept doing it. Soon the other two had joined in and we kicked and kicked until it cracked and we kept kicking until it shattered.

At this point, we could start to hear pounding on the glass all around us. I could see movement at the edges of my vision. But I tried not to spare it any attention.

We needed to focus. This was life or death.

Kijoon was the first to jump. We watched as he leapt forward and rolled onto one of the floors before immediately disappearing above us.

I held my breath. Nadia reached out and grabbed my hand. And then we jumped together.

I think we made it by less than an inch, landing hard on rough carpet. Seconds later, we heard the elevator crashing down into the ground. We turned around, finding several dark figures pressed up against the glass outside the shaft.

We stared at them and although we couldn’t make out any of their features, we could tell that they were staring right back at us. We were almost convinced that the moment we tried running away from them, they’d burst through the glass.

But they never did. Eventually they just disappeared, slowly retreating back down.

We stood there for a while longer until it felt safe enough to turn around. Once we did, we found yet another corridor ahead.

But this time, we didn’t have to walk for too long before we reached a door.

We didn’t immediately open it up. It could’ve been a trap. This could’ve been false hope. But bereft of any other option, we eventually took the chance and did so.

Immediately we were blinded by light. After our eyes had adjusted to it, we could see that it appeared to lead outside. Into a forest.

I walked out, breathed in the fresh air, listened to the chirping of the birds.

I then realized that this was the same clearing we’d first entered the building from. The same clearing that Sinclair had led us to. I turned around and sure enough the building was right there, the same way it’d looked when I’d first seen it. Three stories tall. Painted dark grey.

I took another look around at the forest. I felt the sun on my skin, watched the bugs crawling around on the ground.

We’d finally made it out. It felt surreal. I almost wanted to collapse and start crying. I looked over at Nadia, who was still standing in the doorway.

“We’re out,” I said to her. “We’re fucking free!”

She smiled. But she didn’t move. She just remained standing there.

“What’s the matter?” I asked her. “Let’s get the fuck out of this forest!”

She shook her head. “My brother’s still in there,” she said. “I came here for one reason. If I can’t find him, then I’m not leaving.”

I didn’t know how to respond to that.

“I could use some help looking for him, you know?” she continued. Her eyes were hopeful, almost pleading. “We made it out once. We could do it again after we find him.”

I thought about it for a while. And then I told her I couldn’t do that. That I was sorry, but I just couldn’t go back in there.

“It’s alright,” she said to me. “I don’t blame you. I just thought I’d ask.”

And with that, she turned around, walked back into the building. I remained watching her for a second. And then I got the fuck out of that forest.

Throughout that entire ordeal, I’d managed not to lose my car keys so I was able to drive away once I got back to the road. I contacted the police immediately after I got home. I gave the operator the coordinates from the email and then explained in detail everything that had happened. I even offered to come back down there to guide the officers over to exactly where the building was.

The operator thanked me for calling in and told me somebody would follow up with me soon.

This all happened weeks ago. And still nobody’s gotten back to me. I don’t know how many times I’ve called in, asking for an update. I’ve even gone down to the station in person. But every time they just tell me the same thing. That somebody would be following up with me.

It’s like the universe is telling me to just drop it. That I should just be grateful that I even made it out of there. That I shouldn’t be pushing my luck any further.

But I don’t know. That’s a bit of a hard pill to swallow. Josh is gone. Nadia’s still inside that place. Sinclair, or whatever the fuck his name really is, is still out there. That building is still out there.

**Laying the Groundwork** 

Sequestered behind thick wooden doors and dimly lit rooms, developments are underway which shall forever transform the social and economic structure of the Guatemalan republic. Jacobo Arbenz has been long at work bringing in prominent agrarian leaders and revolutionary activists. But these secret meetings are masked by yet another flurry of activity in the halls of government ministries. 

The Agrarian Reforms of 1952, presented through the Guatemalan Ministry of Agriculture, has begun pushing through a long series of programmes which had been long planned for since Árbenz's ascension in 1951. 

**Consolidation**

Recent agricultural projects along The Pacific Coast have brought to light the need for centralized control. Both the Ministry of Agriculture and The National Agricultural Bank find themselves consolidated under the Institute of Production **(Instituto de Fomento de la Produción)**. This new institute is tasked with funneling funds and overseeing project development. 

The Institute of Production will allow the government to have a central agency overseeing a variety of perhaps unrelated but equally important projects. National development relies on the government's ability to control projects in varying fields - it elects to fully follow the World Bank's recommendations. The Institute of Production will be the central agency and beating heart of the nation's development and agricultural projects. 

Other agencies find themselves created in assistance of this agrarian reform.

**Data**

Within the Central Statistical Office a new section is being created, a **Section of Agricultural Statistics**. The **Section of Agricultural Statistics** will be manned by a core of four trained statisticians. The **Section of Agricultural Statistics** will have a representative stationed in each of the republic's 22 departments to organize and supervise reporting. Below these representatives will be a team of 8 or so aides to enact the actual gathering of reports - with additional personnel being hired on a temporary basis to conduct data collection. The **Section of Agricultural Statistics** will recieve a starting budget of 500,000 Quetzals.

A foreign statistician will be hired from Argentina in order to aid in organizing the agricultural statistics section during its first year of work. Its first job will be to gather reports on crop output for the years of 1951 and 1952. 

**Agricultural Research, Extension, and Training** 

Per reports from the World Bank, Guatemala's agricultural research must be itensified. Important areas of research are as follows: 

1.) The introduction, selection, and adaptation of improved plant varieties; namely drought resistant and pest resistant crops. 

2.) Crossbreeding and better feeding of livestock will also be conducted. Mainly to adapt livestock for local conditions and increase meat production. 

3.) Research must be conducted into the best methods to control local plant and animal pests. Research must be conducted into producing more disease resistance crops. 

4.) Studies shall be conducted into the best methods for soil conservation and soil management while taking into account local conditions. 

5.) Studies must be conducted into the potential of utilizing indigenous wild plants for further cultivation.  

While these areas are all main points of possible research, the focus of research in 1952 to 1954 will focus on the cultivation of plants resistant to local pests and local diseases. This will be done by breeding already resistance specimen to increase crop resistance to local diseases and pests.

Yet another area of research will rest on the testing of fertilizers in various soils found across Guatemala's regions. The main aim is to find and determine which regions are most effective for the utilization of fertilizer. A last field of active research is the research and study of cultivation practices and study into the utilization of agricultural wastes in increasing agricultural output across Guatemala. 

These areas of agricultural research will be centered and directed by the Institute of Production under an **Agricultural Research Section**. In total, 2,000,000 Quetzals will be directed into initiating research into the previously named agricultural fields in the year of 1952.

**Research on Native Plants**

Studies into the usefulness of native plants will begin earnestly. One of the aims of Árbenz's government is to reduce dependence on foreign companies and foreign groups in the development of Guatemala's resources and economy. It has long been a known fact that Guatemala is home to some 15 species of unexploited vegetable oil plants. The cultivation of these vegetable oil plants will allow for the production of native feed and soap for export abroad. In total, 100,000 Quetzals are directed into an expedition led mainly by Guatemalan Mayans that will explore the highlands of Guatemala in search of native vegetable oil plant specimens which shall be brought into the lowlands for mass cultivation. 

**Seed Production** 

A system of seed certification will be established in order to organize the production of seeds within the country. Six seed farms will be established across Guatemala's regions - these seed production farms will produce seeds for wheat, corn, coffee, beans, legumes, and mangos. A **Comission of Seeds** will be established under the Institute of Production to oversee the transformation of normal farms into seed farms, direct seed production, direct distribution to farmers, and come to agreements with farmers to create further seed producers. A budget of 750,000 Quetzals will be given to the **Comission of Seeds** to begin their work on this project. 

**The Grand Land Survey of 1951** 

Across Guatemala's 22 departments, more than 200 agents of the state in the form of civil servants, mappers, and simple aides have been sent to gather up information on land ownership in Guatemala. Working under the Central Statistical Office, their main job has been to completely map out an image of land ownership in Guatemala. This has mainly involved gathering land deeds, directly traveling to towns and villages to map out areas of land control, and ultimately turning to local authorities to assist in these efforts. 

The Guatemalan government has a general idea of land division within the country - hence this mission has a more hidden, specific goal. For Jacobo Arbenz, this land survey will reveal the full extent of uncultivated land within the country. It will help map out the extent of land owned by foreign companies that sits unused. Domestically, it will also map out land that sits untouched by Guatemalan landowners.  Uncultivated land is a key focus of the survey - with Arbenz aiming to map a full image of the percentage and amount of land ownership within the country - and how much of the land is available for the taking.

Leading this effort is a prominent labour leaders and equally prominent farmer - **Leonardo Castillo Flores**. Flores serves as the Secretary General of the National Farm Workers of Guatemala (CNCG). His experience as a farmer, a labour leader, and an organizer will help maintain the focus of the land survey project. Furthermore, while Flores will not directly oversee the land surveyers, his ideological commitment to the Guatemalan Revolution will assure a firm hand as the man will have the power to interfere in matters of the land survey as deemed necessary by his temporary office. 

Furthermore his leadership of the CNCG gives him the ability to call upon extra personnel and extra oversight to keep the survey project in check. Arbenz has long suspected that the haciendados of Guatemala and their overwhelming land estates would fervently resist any steps taken towards land reform. Their small elite must understand that the land survey is the preparatory step towards the reform to come. 

Arbenz needs a strongman with hands to back him up - Flores is that strongman. 

The developments of the land survey and the creation of so many new agencies has led to a rapid expansion of bureaucracy and the offices within Guatemala City. The middle class find themselves filling a multitude of different roles in government. Albeit Arbenz's economic minister has cast his worry regarding the rapid rise in spending to fund these agricultural projects. Yet Arbenz has assured him that raised taxes will help cover the costs of these new projects. 

For Arbenz, the future of his administration depends on the success of these projects. Their success will help to demonstrate his government as an empirical, pragmatic, and effective force capable of leading national development. It will help to secure the economic base for further reforms and will give new jobs to both the middle and working class. Their failures may prove disastrous - and destroy his ability to enact the reforms he so dearly desires. Yet Arbenz and his ministers remain confident - and importantly have stuck to the recommendations of the World Bank, a key provider of funds for the projects ahead.

Who left behind his life in bags and boxes
A vice haunted
He never tried too hard
To be someone he’s not
Liked his coffee hot
And pants torn
I’ll always wonder what you’ve hidden away,
Once only shorn
Until that October day
I played a game of hide and seek in your home
Not knowing if I should roam or clean, or your thoughts on me
And maybe I was mean
Because people I want to be close to, like you, my brain always will choose to hide from
Your plant has dried some
Why’d you ever get that buzzcut? 
I’ve been in a rut
Both lower on meds, or free
In my head I’ve been playing a game from your book
Did I overlook
The desire to be with someone who will actually dance and cook
And any chance to check in on you
So I hope you break through
The stake of that hospital bracelet
I know I’ve had to face it,
In my own ways,
Like when he cheated on me, and made me promise me not to say
And lacks what you have displayed 
Like emotional depth that he begs me to disobey 
And the desire to grow, to be okay
I think you should know
The first time you biked by
I was too scared to say hello
The second time completely shook off my low
Because your smile shined 
Without a sign I’ll never be able to tell
If all of the times seeing me with him made you want to yell
The only way I could ever tell you, boy with the hospital bracelet, or say it, that my feelings have now shift, 
Was with a communal gift
And lately I’ve been in the rifts
Trying to keep myself a drift, with the hobbies I never knew you liked
Or reading, writing poems in the night 
Thinking of ways I can better myself or create a different life
One where I am not scared to speak
To feel complete, inside, not just out
Hospital bracelet, I hope your drought ends
And you can make amends, until then

Some time after that, I ran into the kid’s dad and ended up giving him the original sketch.

Sam’s Diner sat directly across from San Rafael High, which meant every morning it became a warm-lit holding pen for teenagers running on caffeine and pure disrespect. Our crew had been meeting there for years: Adam and Matt — the loud Caucasian twins; Shant and William — the quieter but more lethal Palestinian twins; plus Jimmy, Steve, and Mitch. A full seven-man breakfast militia.

The roasting usually started before anyone even sat down.

“Jimmy,” Adam said, pointing at him like he was naming a suspect, “back of your mama’s neck look like a pack of hot dogs.”

The table exploded — fists banging, coffee sloshing, Shant wheezing like a broken accordion.

Jimmy didn’t miss a beat. “Boy, shut up. You got on those ‘Roll-Em-Out-Specials’,” he said, flicking two fingers at Adam’s pants. “Your jeans got more wrinkles than my grandma.”

More chaos. Steve almost choked on his toast.

Matt had to shout over the laughter. “Hey, hey — Shant! What happened to Ivan’s mom at Chuck E. Cheese again?”

Shant covered his face like he was about to confess to a crime. “Man… that lady fainted in front of the animatronic band.”
The whole table disintegrated — chairs shaking, Mitch gasping for air, someone pounding the syrup bottle like a defibrillator.

At the next table, a middle-aged guy was trying to order breakfast in peace. The waiter, a thin man with too much optimism for 7:45 a.m., set down the menu with a flourish.

“Yes, sir — the French toast is out of this world,” he said, rubbing the back of his neck dramatically.

William froze mid-laugh, eyes widening. “Oh no,” he whispered. “That’s a nono.”

See, our group had rules. Very simple rules.
Rule #1: All roasting was fair game.
Rule #2: Any cliché spoken within a 20-foot radius was punishable by immediate verbal destruction.
Rule #3 (the most sacred): If you tried to “play it off” — scratch your neck, fix your shirt, adjust your hair — you were done. Finished. Cooked.

And the waiter had just stacked all three violations like pancakes.

Seven heads turned toward him. Seven evil smiles. Seven kids who smelled blood.

My doctor suggested that I do an exclusion diet for diary and gluten to see if that was causing it. Turns out, it was dairy that was causing it, and I am no longer in pain. When I went to reintroduce dairy, within a few minutes of having maybe a teaspoon of milk, I began to become out of breath and became dizzy. Tried it 2 more times the following days and had worst reactions. So I stopped eating diary again and got a few recommendations for an allergist by my doctor. About 2 weeks later, I accidently had put normal coffee creamer in my coffee at work. I took a small sip and within a minute I started to become really hot, I started sweating a bit, I felt pins and needles/tingling in my arms, itchiness everywhere, dizziness, a little harder to breath, stomach was cramping up, and I had a fast heart beat . (No hives, rashes, or swelling) It took me a few minutes to figure out what was happening, and I found out that I accidently had milk. This reaction took an hour to calm down, but I still felt terrible for the rest of the day and even into the next. This was not the only time I was exposed to milk, as I did have a milder response to something that was cooked in the same fryer.



Fast forward to my allergist appointment, I tested negative to the scratch test. So naturally I ask what it could possibly be, but all he said was that it could be an intolerance and ignored all my following questions, and began focusing on allergy shots for my seasonal allergies which I don't have. After this, I decided I wanted a second opinion. I go see another allergist and again tested negative with the scratch test. Again, I ask about what it could possibly be, and he just went on and on about how it could be an intolerance or that it is my anxiety causing the reaction. I have considered it but I doubt it given that the reaction occurred without knowing that I consumed it right away, and told him that.



Now what makes this even more confusing is that I had a piece of a cookie that contained butter in it and I was completely fine. This was half the reason why I considered that it was my anxiety, but I could never get my body to react the same way as it did when I consumed straight up milk/creamer even if convinced myself that I had accidently ate some.  


I am frustrated since I am having this issue and I feel like its being downplayed. I don't understand how it could be an intolerance since it happens so fast. I don't understand how it could be anxiety given that It happened when I didn't know that I had some. I am just confused about the entire situation overall, and I just want an answer.

A surprising fact: 3 out of 5 people find themselves moving to a new home within their first year after divorce. Ironically, divorce and moving are 2 of the top 3 stressors in one's life.

Divorce marks more than just the end of a marriage - it opens up a chance for a complete life reset. Right now, a post-divorce move might seem daunting, but this could be your perfect moment to build the fresh start you deserve.

Picture this - your new space will bring new memories, new routines, and best of all, a brand new chapter in your life's journey. The decision to move nearby or to a different state carries both emotional and practical significance.

This piece guides you through each step of moving forward after divorce. You'll learn everything - from practical moving tips to ways of building your social circle in a new location. The journey includes sorting shared belongings and creating a peaceful space that's uniquely yours.

Are you ready to step toward your fresh start? Let's get going.

# Planning Your Post-Divorce Move

Life after divorce means you'll need to plan your move carefully. The same assets now support two households instead of one, so you'll likely have less money to work with. Here's a systematic way to handle this big life transition:

# Creating a Moving Timeline and Checklist

Eight weeks is the perfect timeframe for planning your move. This timeline lets you handle everything without feeling rushed. Your first steps should include collecting vital documents like your divorce decree, financial records, and identification papers. Make a detailed list of everything you own and decide what stays, what gets donated, and what you'll sell.

# Budgeting for Your New Life

Divorce will substantially alter your financial situation. Track your spending habits now and create a budget focusing on needs rather than wants. Note that you should:

1. Save money for one-time costs like legal fees and utility deposits
2. Start an emergency fund with $1,000, then work toward 3-6 months of living expenses
3. Factor in all income sources, including spousal and child support

# Legal Considerations Before Moving

Moving with children requires either your ex-spouse's consent or court approval. Courts look at several key factors:

* What benefits your child might gain
* How it affects the relationship with the non-relocating parent
* Your motivation to move
* The existing custody arrangement

The divorce agreement might restrict your relocation options even without children. Some agreements specify distance limits before requiring changes to the original terms. Moving to another state might need extra court paperwork to protect your rights.

# Organizing Your Move and Belongings

Organizing your belongings after divorce requires practical planning and emotional awareness. A clear system can help you navigate your shared life together.

# Sorting Through Shared Possessions

Start sorting your belongings 5-6 weeks before you plan to move. Here's a step-by-step approach that works well:

1. Make a detailed inventory of shared items
2. Mark items with colored stickers or tape (red to keep, green to sell, orange to donate)
3. Take photos of valuable items
4. Get help from someone who can intervene with high-stake items if needed
5. Give your ex clear deadlines to collect their belongings

# Decluttering for a Fresh Start

Your new chapter needs a clean slate. You might want to store uncertain items temporarily. This gives you space to make better decisions without feeling rushed. As you sort through items, ask yourself:

* Will this item help me in my new life?
* What emotions does it bring up?
* Will keeping this help my healing process?

# Packing Tips for Emotional Items

Sentimental items need extra care. Take your time with wedding photos or keepsakes - emotions might now cloud your judgment. A ""memory box"" works great for items you're unsure about. Write labels on multiple sides of boxes so you can spot them easily.

Wedding gifts or shared collections can be tough to sort through. A trusted friend's help can be a great way to get an objective point of view while supporting you emotionally. Some decisions can wait until you feel more settled in your new space.

# Setting Up Your New Home

A new living space marks an exciting chapter in your life. Setting up a home after divorce needs careful planning, but it allows you to create a space that shows who you really are.

# Essential First Purchases

Your house becomes a home with some simple necessities. [TaskRabbit](https://www.taskrabbit.com/?ref=blog.wemove.ai) reports a 15% increase in post-divorce moving assistance requests, so you're not alone in this experience. Here are the items you need first:

* Comfortable bed and bedding
* Simple kitchen essentials
* Bathroom necessities
* Lighting fixtures
* Storage solutions

# Creating a Peaceful Living Space

Your new space should feel like a personal sanctuary. Plants near your entryway can symbolize growth and new beginnings. Natural light creates a welcoming atmosphere, so keep your windows clear and add warm-toned lighting to make evenings cozy.

**Personal touches** mean more than expensive furnishings. Display artwork or photographs that make you happy, and add natural elements to lift your spirit. Children sharing custody need their own dedicated spaces to feel secure and settled.

# Establishing New Routines

A structured life brings stability during transitions. Your daily schedule should mix practical tasks with self-care activities. Pick specific times to manage household tasks like laundry and grocery shopping. A healthy sleep routine and regular exercise will keep you balanced.

Your home extends beyond its walls. Get familiar with your new neighborhood's coffee shops, parks, and community spaces. This broader perspective helps you feel at home in your new environment.

# Building Your New Life

Life after divorce means more than just moving to a new place - building meaningful connections and finding yourself again. Studies show that a strong support system helps people adjust better after divorce.

# Finding Your Support System

A good support network should include different people who can encourage and guide you:

* Family members who love you no matter what
* Close friends who stand by you emotionally
* Professional counselors or therapists
* Support groups with shared experiences
* Mentors who've successfully moved past divorce

Support groups are a great way to get understanding and empathy, especially when you have others who've faced the same challenges. Connecting with people who share your experience helps you see your feelings are normal and gives you practical ways to cope.

# Exploring Your New Community

Your new surroundings offer many opportunities through local parks, clubs, and community activities. Getting involved in your community helps you feel more connected and opens doors to new friendships and possibilities.

# Developing New Hobbies and Interests

This is your chance to try activities you've always wanted to explore. New hobbies do more than just keep your mind busy - they help you meet like-minded people and boost your confidence. **Consider activities that bring you joy** instead of picking them just for social reasons.

Your new life takes shape gradually, one layer at a time. Start with activities that make you feel good and spark joy. A local sports team, an art class, or community volunteer work can help build the foundation for your fresh start.

# A New Chapter

A post-divorce move means more than just changing your address - it gives you a chance to write a new chapter in life's story. You can build strong foundations for your fresh start through careful planning, thoughtful organization of your belongings, and creation of a peaceful living space.

This transition takes time and each small step matters. Your path forward takes shape as you establish new routines, learn about your community, and find new interests. Your new home becomes both a sanctuary and a launching pad for personal growth.

Stay patient with yourself during this trip. You'll create meaningful connections in your new community while maintaining healthy boundaries. This move will become more than just leaving the past behind—it transforms into your gateway to an exciting new beginning filled with possibilities.

My apologies for the length because this might be long. Trigger warning alcoholism.

I 21F am considering cutting off my dad 60M from my life. A little backstory, my dad has been an alcoholic for as long as I can remember. One time when I was around 13 I ate my sister, now 23F, leftovers and obviously she was upset and told my dad. My dad already being drunk came to my room yelling and even shoved me. Around the same time my dad told my sister and I that he hopes we get raped. My sister and I told my mom and she talked to my dad and the drinking got a little better. When I was 18 I was gaining a little bit of weight I was 6’0 and 180 pounds and he made a comment to me saying when was the last time you went to the gym. Obviously I’m only telling the bad things my dad has done but he would take my sister and I to sports practices and school activities when we were young since my mom would work 24 hour shifts 2-3 days a week. But he would almost always complain about having to drive us. My mom was the one who would go to almost all of our games and practices. My parents would fight semi often when i was a kid.

Around the time I turned 18 my mom, now 50F, started losing a lot of weight after my grandma died because she didn’t want her health to become like my grandmas. At the same my mom started going out more with friends to the bar since she never did when I was growing up and now that I was an adult she had the free time to go out. My mom didn’t want my dad to come with her when she went out because he tends to be a fun killer, he doesn’t really have a filter and often says things without thinking about what he is actually saying.

Because my mom started losing weight and then going out more my dad assumed and would openly accuse my mom of cheating, which she obviously wasn’t. My dad would start blaring YouTube videos about narcissistic women on the TV in the living room and would tell me about how my mom is a narcissist. Eventually my mom was fed up and filed for a divorce. This is where things kinda blew up.

My dad would start texting my mom saying he would kill himself and one time the cops had to be called because he actually grabbed a knife so my mom pushed him away from her. My dad would constantly involve me even when I asked him not to because I want a relationship with both of them and dont want to be expected to pick sides, even though just based off of my observations I would side with my mom.

I wanna point out my mom is the family breadwinner making probably 200k a year working 3 jobs while my dad worked 1 job making at most 50k and he wouldn’t do house chores all he did was turn on his vacuum robot and sit on the couch and drink beers.

My dad would refuse to cook dinner for me and would order a whole giant pizza for himself so my mom told him that he wasn’t allowed to eat her groceries if he cant even cook for his own daughter. This is when my dad started taking the thermostat off the wall because he didn’t like that my mom locked it because she would set it to 68-70 and he wanted it warmer instead of just wearing a jacket. My mom bought a new thermostat with her personal money and upped his petty by putting the coffee pot and coffee beans and grinder in her bedroom since they weren’t sleeping in the same room.

My mom would often ask me to sleep at my bf M22’s house because of how bad arguments would get and she didn’t know if he would lash out. At one point my dad threatened to tow my bf’s car for no reason. My dad also knows how close my mom was with her mom, my grandma, but has made comments to my mom about how she would be so disappointed in the person my mom has become. Among other really shitty comments regarding my mom’s dead parents who died pretty recently being my grandma in 2022 and my grandpa in 2024.

My mom also is going to have to pay him alimony from all her jobs and he is going to be taking a good chunk out of her 2 pensions. A couple months before my mom and I moved out my dad even came down to my room and said “I’m gonna do whatever I can in my power to fuck your mom over in this divorce, and if you get fucked over in that process I don’t care.” Now that my mom and I moved out my mom still pays half the mortgage which gives her the right to go back into our old house whenever she wants to grab things we didn’t get during the big part of the move. My dad didn’t like that she would come by when he wasn’t home so he illegally started barricading the front door so we can’t come in. Now that we have the physical separation from my dad and my mom ignores most of his texts and calls he has started threatening to try and find out where we live.

I just celebrated my 21st birthday and all I got from him was a “Happy Birthday” text, no happy 21st or asking if I have plans, nothing. My dad basically only calls or texts me to tell my mom to answer him or to bitch about my mom to me.

I want to cut him out of my life because of everything he has put us through but at the same time in the back of my head I keep thinking but he’s your dad he helped raise you. My dad has told me I’m an AH for kinda siding with my mom.",2,1763511644.0,TrueOffMyChest,6,1.0,False

I want new plasma donors to be more informed and become safer donors. I have solid educational advice for new plasma donors who may be considering to try it out, earn extra money, and save lives:

• Plasma is 92% water and the rest is protein elements (about 7%), and other elements such as electrolytes, mineral salts, sugars, fats, hormones, and vitamins. With proper protein consumption, hydration, and electrolyte drinks, the body does replenish plasma volume (mainly the water component) within about 24–48 hours after donation, especially with adequate hydration and nutrition. However, the full restoration of plasma proteins may take several days, and the 48-hour interval between donations is mandated primarily for donor safety and to allow partial replenishment, but not necessarily because all components are fully restored in 48 hours.

• During plasmapheresis, blood is drawn, plasma is separated, and red blood cells (and other components) are returned to the donor in cycles.

• Per FDA regulations, you're only allowed to donate plasma twice in a 7 day period, with a 48 hour wait in-between those two times. Don't risk your health by hopping around to different plasma donation centers to circumvent these regulations, and you may get caught if you do. Donor identification systems are in place to track donations across centers; attempting to donate more frequently can risk your health and may result in being barred from donation.

1. Eat a meal high in protein 2-3 hours before donating. Your plasma protein levels are influenced by your overall diet over several days, not just the immediate pre-donation meal.

2. Drink plenty of water and/or non-caffeinated juice before donating to stay hydrated. It's important to stay hydrated at least the day before, and the day of your donation.

3. Avoid caffeine such as in coffee or soda before donating or it's possible you could get nauseous, lightheaded, vomit, or faint during your donation. Caffeine is a mild diuretic and can contribute to dehydration, while not prohibited, it's recommended to avoid caffeine before you donate.

4. No alcohol 24 hours before, and for a little while after donating as it can dehydrate you.

5. No strenuous exercise for at least 6 hours after donating as it can put too much stress on the vein. Some centers may recommend a longer or shorter time than 6 hours before exercising, but 6 hours is the average recommendation.

6. Some people get away with smoking or vaping nicotine before and after donating, but the nicotine can raise your heart's pulse rate and your blood pressure. Most centers recommend avoiding smoking or vaping nicotine at least 30 minutes to 2 hours before donating.

7. If your pulse rate is above 100, you'll be able to do a vitals retake after a 15 minute wait. But if it's 100 or higher again you'll be deferred for the day. Taking sort of slower but deep breaths for 10 to 15 minutes before getting your vitals taken should help lower your pulse rate, the box breathing technique may also help ease your pulse rate. If your pulse rate is an issue, listen to binaural beats that are known to reduce anxiety and lower heart rate, at a low to medium volume with earbuds/headphones. Or try listening to ""Pink Noise"" or ""Green Noise"" at a low to medium volume before donating which may help reduce your pulse rate, along with its effect on lowering your blood pressure.

8. There is a risk of getting a blown vein if the worker is having a hard time finding your vein when they're sticking you with the needle or if you have small veins. You may get deferred until your vein heals if that happens. But it's ok, your body is able to heal and repair your veins via normal tissue healing.

9. There is a risk of blood clots, but when your blood is constantly moving through the machine it prevents that from happening. There will also be what’s called an anticoagulant liquid that will prevent you from getting blood clots.

10. You may be subject to drug screening. The drug screening tests for methamphetamines, cocaine, and heroin. Certain pharma prescription meds may show up as a false positive so you'll want to let the plasma center know what meds you're taking. Testing positive for these drugs can result in a permanent deferral from donating plasma.

11. A sample of your blood will be drawn periodically to test for certain sexually transmitted infections (STIs). A positive test will result in either a temporary or permanent deferral from donating plasma. If you've ever been diagnosed or received treatment for HIV/AIDS, Hepatitis B (HBV) or Hepatitis C (HCV) you will be permanently deferred from donating plasma.

• Wait at least a few hours before taking the bandage wrap off of your arm after donating to reduce bleeding and bruising risks.

• You can use Castor Oil on the needle site for the puncture area to heal better. A Q-tip can be used to apply it easier. I simply dip the Q-Tip in the bottle, but never dip the used cotton back into the bottle. However, certain people may be allergic to Castor Oil, in that case Vitamin E/Mineral Oil can be used instead, but certain people may also be allergic to that too. Use of topical agents is not part of official plasma donation guidelines. If you choose to use them, be aware of potential allergies.

• Frequently donating over a prolonged period of time may lead to your body having decreased immunoglobulin levels.

• Red meats are particularly high in the protein nutrients found in plasma.

• Taking vitamin and mineral supplements (e.g., vitamin D, calcium, magnesium, zinc, iron)is generally safe in moderation but can be harmful in excess. Most people get enough from their diet. Protein shakes before donation are not required but can help maintain protein levels.

Donating Plasma with Managed Diabetes

Individuals with well-controlled diabetes can contribute to plasma donation, but certain criteria need to be met:

Absence of Complications: This means no existing diabetic complications affecting your kidneys, heart, blood vessels, or eyes.

Insulin: If you rely on insulin for diabetes management, you must be healthy when you donate and be free of symptoms or treatment needs related to blood sugar fluctuations (high or low). A 3-month wait period applies to non-prescribed drugs.

1. Healthy Feet: Active foot ulcers requiring medical attention will disqualify you from donation.

2. Steady Balance: You shouldn't experience dizziness or lightheadedness upon standing.

3. Type 1 Consideration: For Type 1 diabetics, eating within two hours of donation is highly encouraged for all donors.

Advice Needed!,"Hey everyone, I’m about two months into a Customer Success / Inside Sales role at a small SaaS company in the volunteer management space. I’ve had some light CS/Sales experience before, but this is the first time I’ve really been in the role, and I could use some help.

My responsibilities include: taking onboarding calls with free and paid users, converting free users to paid users, holding support calls with paid users, and managing renewals. I am definitely wearing all the hats! 

I’ve been doing the research on the industry, CS best practices, volunteer management, and sales in a freemium model.. pretty much all the things. I feel the hardest part has been taking what I learn in onboarding calls and actually translating that in real time into how I should run the call to map their volunteer management process to what they can do in our product. Right now, I get overwhelmed with the different paths I can take and mentally “freeze” in calls, and my partner will take over to handle the demo/walkthrough portion. 

Our product is very customizable (think CRM, but for volunteer management), and every organization has a different volunteer workflow, so I keep getting stuck on the following:
- What’s the right tone? More salesy? More instructive?
- What exactly should I highlight for this organization?
- How can I effectively guide this organization when I’m still learning the product?

I’m new to this space and really want to do well, but something just isn’t clicking. It can get really overwhelming for me on calls, especially when I’m trying to onboard and make a sale at the same time.

My apologies for the length because this might be long. Trigger warning alcoholism.

I 21F am considering cutting off my dad 60M from my life. A little backstory, my dad has been an alcoholic for as long as I can remember. One time when I was around 13 I ate my sister, now 23F, leftovers and obviously she was upset and told my dad. My dad already being drunk came to my room yelling and even shoved me. Around the same time my dad told my sister and I that he hopes we get raped. My sister and I told my mom and she talked to my dad and the drinking got a little better. When I was 18 I was gaining a little bit of weight I was 6’0 and 180 pounds and he made a comment to me saying when was the last time you went to the gym. Obviously I’m only telling the bad things my dad has done but he would take my sister and I to sports practices and school activities when we were young since my mom would work 24 hour shifts 2-3 days a week. But he would almost always complain about having to drive us. My mom was the one who would go to almost all of our games and practices. My parents would fight semi often when i was a kid.

Around the time I turned 18 my mom, now 50F, started losing a lot of weight after my grandma died because she didn’t want her health to become like my grandmas. At the same my mom started going out more with friends to the bar since she never did when I was growing up and now that I was an adult she had the free time to go out. My mom didn’t want my dad to come with her when she went out because he tends to be a fun killer, he doesn’t really have a filter and often says things without thinking about what he is actually saying.

Because my mom started losing weight and then going out more my dad assumed and would openly accuse my mom of cheating, which she obviously wasn’t. My dad would start blaring YouTube videos about narcissistic women on the TV in the living room and would tell me about how my mom is a narcissist. Eventually my mom was fed up and filed for a divorce. This is where things kinda blew up.

My dad would constantly involve me even when I asked him not to because I want a relationship with both of them and dont want to be expected to pick sides, even though just based off of my observations I would side with my mom.

I wanna point out my mom is the family breadwinner making probably 200k a year working 3 jobs while my dad worked 1 job making at most 50k and he wouldn’t do house chores all he did was turn on his vacuum robot and sit on the couch and drink beers.

My dad would refuse to cook dinner for me and would order a whole giant pizza for himself so my mom told him that he wasn’t allowed to eat her groceries if he cant even cook for his own daughter. This is when my dad started taking the thermostat off the wall because he didn’t like that my mom locked it because she would set it to 68-70 and he wanted it warmer instead of just wearing a jacket. My mom bought a new thermostat with her personal money and upped his petty by putting the coffee pot and coffee beans and grinder in her bedroom since they weren’t sleeping in the same room.

My mom would often ask me to sleep at my bf M22’s house because of how bad arguments would get and she didn’t know if he would lash out. At one point my dad threatened to tow my bf’s car for no reason. My dad also knows how close my mom was with her mom, my grandma, but has made comments to my mom about how she would be so disappointed in the person my mom has become. Among other really shitty comments regarding my mom’s dead parents who died pretty recently being my grandma in 2022 and my grandpa in 2024.

My mom also is going to have to pay him alimony from all her jobs and he is going to be taking a good chunk out of her 2 pensions. A couple months before my mom and I moved out my dad even came down to my room and said “I’m gonna do whatever I can in my power to fuck your mom over in this divorce, and if you get fucked over in that process I don’t care.” Now that my mom and I moved out my mom still pays half the mortgage which gives her the right to go back into our old house whenever she wants to grab things we didn’t get during the big part of the move. My dad didn’t like that she would come by when he wasn’t home so he illegally started barricading the front door so we can’t come in. Now that we have the physical separation from my dad and my mom ignores most of his texts and calls he has started threatening to try and find out where we live.

I just celebrated my 21st birthday and all I got from him was a “Happy Birthday” text, no happy 21st or asking if I have plans, nothing. My dad basically only calls or texts me to tell my mom to answer him or to bitch about my mom to me.

I want to cut him out of my life because of everything he has put us through but at the same time in the back of my head I keep thinking but he’s your dad he helped raise you. My dad has told me I’m an AH for kinda siding with my mom.

So, fellow potato queens, AITAH? And again any advice on how to navigate this would be hugely appreciated.

Every day, before the merciless sun of the Pernambuco sertão appeared on the horizon, my mother was already up preparing coffee.

I lived there with my parents and my older brother, who one day tried to live a simple life, tending his own land, raising animals, and dreaming of children running in the yard. But I’m getting ahead of myself.

Since childhood, my brother loved listening to tales about the cangaço (banditry). He would lean into the old men's circle of conversation and stay silent, just listening. When a cowboy commented on a cangaceiro (bandit) attack on a farm or town, his eyes would widen as if he were listening to fairy tales.

Once, I caught him scratching the name ""Lampião"" on a piece of old leather with a knife.
“You trying to die early, are you?” I asked, irritated.
“I want to live like a man. Not like an animal trapped on a small patch of land,” he replied, serious, without looking at me.
The truth is, my brother dreamed of the cangaço life.

A life with a gun in hand, facing the police patrol (volante). I thought it was a boyish thing. But it wasn't; it was a calling.
He seemed to forget all about it after he met Tânia Maria, on a trip he made to the town of Calumbi to sell the cheeses my father produced. It was love at first sight, he said. After a short time dating, they decided to set up house together. With the money he had saved his whole life, he bought a small farmhouse in the rural area of that town. He was happier than ever before.
But peace and happiness don't last when a Colonel decides that the land you're standing on is no longer yours.

His hired gunmen (jagunços) arrived at the end of the day, with weapons and the certainty of those who know that no one will demand justice.
When they left, they only left destruction, blood, and a pain that never left my brother's soul. They burned his house and what they did to his wife in front of him, I don't even want to remember. That night my brother lost everything. Even his soul.

My mother was already awake lighting the stove when we heard the dog bark and then immediately start wagging, celebrating, and sniffing under the door. I went out onto the porch and saw, through the darkness, my brother coming on foot, stumbling, his face covered in dust and blood.
His shirt was torn, stuck to his body by a mixture of sweat and wounds.
One of his arms seemed to be broken, and his gaze was that of someone who had seen hell up close. Behind him, only the silence of the caatinga.

I ran and held him before he could fall. My mother became frantic when she saw his condition, and my father appeared with a pale face. We took him inside and took care of his wounds. It was devastating; he just cried and called out for his wife.
My father didn't ask anything; he just helped clean the blood, while my mother tore up an old sheet to make bandages.

My brother spent months without looking anyone in the eye.
He no longer cried, and for a long time, he barely spoke either, just staring at the horizon thinking of revenge. My father tried to get that idea out of his head, saying he should leave it to God because we couldn't do anything against powerful people.
Slowly, my brother returned to the farm, helping us as before. But I saw in his eyes that he wasn't just planting beans, cassava, or corn. In reality, he was planting the day of his revenge. And that harvest, sooner or later, was going to come.

It was Lent (Quaresma), and the yard was restless; it was the second night in a row.
The hens were cackling non-stop in the coop. The dog was growling, its snout sniffing under the door. We had been losing animals for days: goats, pigs, chickens.
""That darned critter, it must be a cougar (suçuarana),"" my brother said. ""Just like the one that attacked the woman on the other side of the ridge.""

We didn't think twice. We grabbed our shotguns, put on our sandals (alpercatas), and set off down the dirt trail, entering the dry scrub of the caatinga. ""Be careful out there,"" my mother said. We walked for about twenty minutes, and out of nowhere, they emerged like a snake from the bush.
Four men, armed with long knives (peixeiras) and rifles. Cangaceiros. Before we could even think of reacting, we already had knife blades at our throats. But they didn't say anything, no threat. They just signaled for silence. “Shhh!”
They were all crouched down, like cornered animals, as if hiding from the police patrol. One of them whispered, his voice almost gone: ""Quiet! There's something bad lurking in the woods, and it ain't the cops (macaco).""
The leaves rustled, and the wind changed direction. One of them pointed towards the bushes ahead, and I looked in the indicated direction.

From the middle of the dry vegetation, two yellow eyes lit up. Almost at a man's waist height. ""It sensed us."" One of the cangaceiros said, whispering.
The dry branches of the caatinga cracked. The cangaceiros prepared their rifles; I felt a cold sweat run down my back. That's when a grotesque growl tore through the darkness. And before any of us could react, the brush exploded with movement.
The cangaceiro who was closest to us was the first to fall. The creature sank its teeth into his neck, tearing it down to the spine. Blood flew far. Then another, with a single swipe, had his chest ripped open.
My brother and I were speechless in the face of that monstrosity; we had never seen anything like it in our lives.

The thing was big, hairy, with long arms. It looked like a person, but it had a horrible animal head. It growled deep, with slobber dripping from its teeth. When it turned towards me, I knew it was my end.
That's when the shots started.
Dry shots cut through the darkness. Twenty, thirty. The woods filled with flashes of light. The creature screamed, staggered, but didn't fall easily. It still crawled, trying to get up. It seemed unwilling to die.
Only after long minutes did its body stop trembling.

The dust settled, and the cangaceiros approached, surrounding the dead beast with their guns pointed. The Captain came last, unhurriedly. A man of dry presence, with iron eyes. He looked at the beast for a while and said:
""Collect the weapons of those who fell. And bury them with respect.""
My brother and I were on our knees. The man who was watching us lowered his rifle as soon as the Captain looked at him:
""You can let them go.""
I stood up. But my brother remained kneeling.
""Captain, if you please..."" he said, looking firmly, ""I want to join the band.""
The Captain was silent, then asked:
""Do you know what you are asking?""
""Yes, sir, I do."" My brother answered.
""And why should I accept you into my band, man (cabra)?""

My brother told his story, but it was only when the Captain heard the Colonel's name that he decided to accept my brother. The Colonel was an adversary of the Captain, a former supporter (coiteiro) who had become an enemy.
""You're accepted, man."" The Captain said.
My brother stood up with the firmness of someone who was already one of them.
He didn't look at me. Nor did he look back.
I returned home alone. That night, I told my parents what happened.
It was the last time I saw my brother alive. In the morning, my father and I went to the place where we found the cangaceiros and the beast. There was nothing, just the marks of the shots and a lot of dried blood. I can't say what happened to it, I only know that the Captain's men didn't bury it. My mother said it was a werewolf (lobisomem) and that they don't die from common bullets. Only if they are made of silver.

As for my brother, he got his revenge some time later. Even with all the security of his farm, the Colonel succumbed. My brother, along with some men from the band, invaded the main house. The Colonel was caught hiding in the house’s rafters. My brother didn't do anything to the scoundrel's wife; he and his hired gunmen were the ones who owed a debt. Everyone paid.

Years later, while selling cheese at the market in the town of Flores, reading the Diário de Pernambuco newspaper, I saw the report that said:
""Lampião and eleven other cangaceiros were killed by the Alagoas police."" They caught him in Angico. The patrol cut off everyone's head.
Among the names of the dead was my brother's.

1p0slne,https://www.reddit.com/r/DispatchAdHoc/comments/1p0slne/dispatch_x_mha_scene/,Dispatch X MHA scene,"I've been thinking about a Dispatch x MHA crossover since the end of episode 8. I ended up putting together a scene of All Might asking Robert to teach a U.A. Im not a writer so full disclosure, its written with chatgpt. I totally understand if you dont like it.

U.A. High School – Rooftop Garden, Late Afternoon

The sun is low over Musutafu, turning the sky warm gold. Students are gone for the day; the school grounds are quiet in that rare way that buildings full of kids sometimes are.

Robert stands near the railing, leaning on it with that tired-but-still-standing posture he’s perfected over the years. He’s in civilian clothes — SDN jacket, plain shirt, jeans — radio clipped to his pocket in case HPSC needs him.

All Might (in his thin, post-injury form) steps onto the rooftop with a gentle cough.

“Robert, my boy! I hope I’m not interrupting.”

Robert shakes his head. “Nah. Was just appreciating how… not on fire everything is here. It’s relaxing.”

All Might chuckles warmly. “Yes, well, we do try to keep spontaneous property damage to a minimum. Emphasis on try.”

Robert smirks. “Sounds like my team.”

All Might joins him at the railing, hands folded behind his back. Despite his frail form, there’s still something immensely steady about him.

“I’ve been hearing good reports about your time here,” All Might says. “Your cooperation with the Hero Public Safety Commission has been invaluable.”

Robert shrugs, modest. “Just doing what I can. Keep my head down. Fix the suit. Find Shroud before he builds something ugly.”

“Indeed.” All Might’s expression dims briefly. “I’ve read your file. Shroud is not someone Japan can afford to underestimate.”

“No arguments there.”

They stand together in comfortable silence for a moment, wind tugging at their jackets. Robert takes a sip of vending-machine coffee from the cup in his hand. It’s terrible. He drinks it anyway.

Finally, All Might clears his throat.

“Robert, may I ask you something a bit… unconventional?”

Robert eyes him. “Unconventional usually means weird. Go for it.”

All Might smiles at the dry tone.

“Would you… consider being a guest teacher here at U.A.?”

Robert blinks.

“…Huh.”

All Might laughs softly. “Not a full-time position, of course! Your work here in Japan is specific and important. But I believe our students would benefit greatly from your experience.”

Robert raises an eyebrow. “You want me to teach a room full of teenagers. Me.”

“Yes,” All Might says, entirely sincere.

Robert stares. “I don’t even like adults.”

He expects All Might to laugh — but instead, the former No. 1 Hero gives a patient, reassuring nod.

“That is precisely why you might surprise yourself.”

Robert snorts. “What would I even teach? ‘How to be exhausted 24/7’? ‘How to get thrown into a dumpster by a pyrokinetic coworker’? ‘Intro to Traumatic Robot Maintenance’?”

All Might smiles. “How about: ‘Heroism Without Powers.’”

Robert freezes a little.

Because that… that hits something deep.

All Might continues, gentle:

“These children grow up believing quirks define destiny. Many idolize strength, flashiness, raw force. But you — you built your life on skill, wit, discipline, dedication, and compassion.”

Robert looks down at his coffee.

“I built it on caffeine and spite.”

“That too,” All Might admits with a grin, “but you also embody something they rarely see — a true hero without a quirk. A man who stood alongside giants and refused to be small.”

Robert is quiet for a long moment.

The hum of distant city traffic drifts up from the streets. A breeze sweeps across the rooftop.

“…I don’t know if I’m teacher material,” he finally says.

“You’d be surprised,” All Might says. “Sometimes the best mentors are the ones who never thought they’d be one.”

Robert huffs a soft, reluctant laugh.

“I’ll think about it.”

“That is all I ask.”

All Might extends a hand.

Robert shakes it — firm, steady.

As All Might turns to leave, he adds with a wink:

“Besides… I suspect certain faculty members are eager to meet the mysterious Mecha Man. One of our Support Department students may explode from excitement.”

Robert grimaces. “Oh god. Not another one.”

All Might laughs booming and bright, even in his thin form.

“Welcome to U.A., Robert Robertson.”

Robert watches him go, then looks out over the school grounds again.

“…A teacher, huh?”
He mutters to himself, shaking his head.

But he doesn’t sound entirely opposed.

also got to spend a few minutes with the elusive fifth cat in my house, stbx's approproly named ""*dinah*"" 🥰 ^(*>pic \#2<*)

> *>after all, we're all a little mad here*< 😏

~~~~

little insight into me here folks...

i have been telling folks ""i've been sheltered""
  i'm not sure if people really understand what i mean

though i have not been alone,
 because i have been this long married

know
that for all these 15 years

  most of my days
especially since covid hit and my job went remote

 me,
the one with these enormous abandonment issues,

i have sat here
  in relative silence

while stbx played on his computer
for hours and hours and hours on end

  would really only ever do things with me
that were his interest based, very seldom mine


otherwise? 
it's just me
and my cats.

  and before him?

 i was very much alone, too.
#cptsd
   truth: a lot of it was also self-inflicted

  kinda why i've started using my voice about these things
even if i am weird about it

silence is also killing me in its own way 😞


 these very deep feelings/thoughts/experiences of mine 
are very, very, very real

sharing this picture here
  this is me trying to show you that while on the inside

i am okay and not okay

  here is my outside
and what i am doing to take care of me

i don't want to worry ya'll too much either
considering my weird blabby mouth


  i swear to the almighty jeezy creezy
 these autistic compulsions are so hard to fight

my compulsion to write and share and all this?
  they're my audhd executive dysfunctions live and in action

also incredibly time and energy consuming 
  #aka adhd schizo-a manic-like levels of energy processing

things move veeeerrrryyyy quickly in the noggin
 and it takes me time to write/rewrite/edit
cuz of the scattered thingies in the brain

 . . .

  funny anecdote here...
i've been working on identifying/determining my gender identity 
   which i firmly stand by nonbinary

i am also trans... or, as i was referring to it over the summer
  transcendental 

the other day,
  while noodling out the whole interconnection of minds thing
things finally clicked in here

  you could say i was piecing myself together mentally 🧩🧠
and working out how to connect it to myself physically 
  
it was in thinking that through
 that i finally finished identifying and understanding 
   my gender identity 🥳


 now,
while i happen to find this hilarious in my own ways,
   the things i'm about to joke about:
there are some folks who may not see this my way
  and be in some way triggered or take offense 
i apologize, and i mean no offense or ill-intent

this is me being silly about my experiences 
  and making light of them 😉

story + joke:
in my mind,
  i connected my conscious/biological [prefrontal cortex] mind
 with my subconscious/intiutive minds

as i was doing this
  a weird piece of i guess what could be my d.i.d. slipped in
 and associated my genders with my mindscapes/me

  inside,
i feel more masculine in my conscious mind
  aka my prefrontal cortex
and my subconscious/intuitive minds feel more feminine 
 which already matches my feminine exterior

...and then the jokes started rolling in mentally 
 i was absolutely rofl for a solid 5 min here


  one of my favorite so far?

of course my conscious mind would be the one to identify as male
  my prefrontal cortex is where executive dysfunction sits
that bitch is broke in here
   as broke if not moreso than my external bitch-self
  no wonder i behave like a fucking idiot sometimes

men, amirite? 🤣🤣🥰

thank god,
  in the end,
 i am a touch more female than male,
and i still feel both within me

  annnnd i gotta deal with these bitches arguing
like some loving but feisty old married couple
    🤦‍♀️🤷‍♀️😂🧡


  oh,
also,
  to get this ""joke"" outta the way too
#aka incoming my autistic ""karen"" humor


go fuckin figure
  turns out i'm just another one of
""them weirdo trans folks
  ""don't they know it's just a mental disorder?
""idiots...""

    -> to those jerks who want to hate like that

hey jackass,
  it's called obtaining a sense of self.
what in the actual fuck is wrong with that? 


my particular meatsuit happens to have come 
  with a bit of long-term misunderstood gender dysmorphia 
and quite a bit of ""mental illness"" alongside it
#cptsd is involved too
#aka not entirely my god damn fucking fault here
  #aka potentially evolution of species identification over here
     or did you miss that part of what i said in an earlier post?

 guess what?
i found peace for myself when i put these pieces of me together 
   i'm happy with this me, at least when i'm not in pain

are you happy with you?
  it doesn't sound like it to me if you wanna find some way
to yet again invalidate me
   or anyone else like me

go do whatever you need to and do some deep self-reflection

   i already did.

sounds like you might still be in denial over there
 maybe you should have yourself checked out 🧐

. . .


this is how self-aware i am, folks.
this is also how autistic i am.

  having to explain alllllllllllllll this out 
with disorganized chaotic
 stimulant-imbalanced audhd schizo-a 
god damn mental squirrels
   running amok in here
having a thanksgiving-sized feast
   as i continue to go fuckin nuts 🤣🤦‍♀️🧠🐿🥜🤷‍♀️

i digress,
  i am now feeling a good bit calmer, having shared all of this.

time for some rest 🫶🌠
   with a weirdly renewed sense of will
  and hoping/knowing, 
that when i do next awake from slumber
 things might have a weird way of being okay

because, one of the fun things about my little audhd meatsuit here?
  yo this bitch got x-men wolverine-like regenerative healing powers
INSIDE and OUT
   how god damn cool is that shit?
*news flash: you do too
*news flash: trying to also get this point out there

   guess what else i happen to think
and i am starting to explore
  which my special friend also concurs
     my theory could be possible


i wonder if true enlightenment could cure psychosis
  turns out
i think those affected with schizo ""disorders""
    spend so much time dealing with existential crisis
  in order to heal their/our minds
    we -> need <-
 to attain enlightenment 

i'm currently working to find out if this theory is correct
  it might just be, ya'll
does anyone hear/get that one?
    -> a potential ""cure"" for psychosis
sitting right god damn here... 🤦‍♀️


continuing,
as long as i keep my mental health in check long enough 
  and i can repair these cracks as they occur...
maybe, just maybe
    i will be able to prove this one, too.
#aka living example

in terms of mental cracks/breaking:
 i'm talking same day here folks,
i had a big one earlier
   it was part d.i.d./mental separation of self
 it was part project work
it was part curiousity 
  it was part me being silly little me
     it was part trying to see if i have attained enlightenment 

and i recognized it happening as it happened in the moment


what it looked like?
just me talking to myself again.
<cue cheeky childlike tone:>
  uhm, might be one of the meatsuit controls in here
  i doin some research/experiments 
   besides, i'm not hurting anyone
     i refuse to harm bugs anymore
 not the itty bitty ones
        not even the big scary ones
/tone

yup.
this fuckin goofy.

  it is a part of the absolute absurdity 
     that is my life
          🤦‍♀️


but guess what folks?
  get prepared for some comedy


because, as it just so turns out,

pot,
 reminiscing, 
  and childlike ""things""
plus sarcasm, wit, and angry humor/creativity

are some of the primary/only things that help heal me
  and, as you may all have noticed by now,

i kinda need a lot of healing...

  sooooo yeah

jokes a-plenty incoming
  mixed in with all my other shenanigans 
and who knows what else along the way...
-> when <-
  i return from my nap 😏
} yup, realized i needed to fix my mood before my nap {


first, i need to go burst some more mental bubbles
  and find a few more genius ideas 
while i rest myself up

tootles!! 🫶

at this rate i'm likely staying up and in bed the rest of the day 🙄

It was Lent (Quaresma), and the yard was restless; it was the second night in a row.
The hens were cackling non-stop in the coop. The dog was growling, its snout sniffing under the door. We had been losing animals for days: goats, pigs, chickens.
""That darned critter, it must be a cougar (suçuarana),"" my brother said. ""Just like the one that attacked the woman on the other side of the ridge.""

We didn't think twice. We grabbed our shotguns, put on our sandals (alpercatas), and set off down the dirt trail, entering the dry scrub of the caatinga. ""Be careful out there,"" my mother said. We walked for about twenty minutes, and out of nowhere, they emerged like a snake from the bush.
Four men, armed with long knives (peixeiras) and rifles. Cangaceiros. Before we could even think of reacting, we already had knife blades at our throats. But they didn't say anything, no threat. They just signaled for silence. “Shhh!”
They were all crouched down, like cornered animals, as if hiding from the police patrol. One of them whispered, his voice almost gone: ""Quiet! There's something bad lurking in the woods, and it ain't the cops (macaco).""
The leaves rustled, and the wind changed direction. One of them pointed towards the bushes ahead, and I looked in the indicated direction.

From the middle of the dry vegetation, two yellow eyes lit up. Almost at a man's waist height. ""It sensed us."" One of the cangaceiros said, whispering.
The dry branches of the caatinga cracked. The cangaceiros prepared their rifles; I felt a cold sweat run down my back. That's when a grotesque growl tore through the darkness. And before any of us could react, the brush exploded with movement.
The cangaceiro who was closest to us was the first to fall. The creature sank its teeth into his neck, tearing it down to the spine. Blood flew far. Then another, with a single swipe, had his chest ripped open.
My brother and I were speechless in the face of that monstrosity; we had never seen anything like it in our lives.

The thing was big, hairy, with long arms. It looked like a person, but it had a horrible animal head. It growled deep, with slobber dripping from its teeth. When it turned towards me, I knew it was my end.
That's when the shots started.
Dry shots cut through the darkness. Twenty, thirty. The woods filled with flashes of light. The creature screamed, staggered, but didn't fall easily. It still crawled, trying to get up. It seemed unwilling to die.
Only after long minutes did its body stop trembling.

The dust settled, and the cangaceiros approached, surrounding the dead beast with their guns pointed. The Captain came last, unhurriedly. A man of dry presence, with iron eyes. He looked at the beast for a while and said:
""Collect the weapons of those who fell. And bury them with respect.""
My brother and I were on our knees. The man who was watching us lowered his rifle as soon as the Captain looked at him:
""You can let them go.""
I stood up. But my brother remained kneeling.
""Captain, if you please..."" he said, looking firmly, ""I want to join the band.""
The Captain was silent, then asked:
""Do you know what you are asking?""
""Yes, sir, I do."" My brother answered.
""And why should I accept you into my band, man (cabra)?""

My brother told his story, but it was only when the Captain heard the Colonel's name that he decided to accept my brother. The Colonel was an adversary of the Captain, a former supporter (coiteiro) who had become an enemy.
""You're accepted, man."" The Captain said.
My brother stood up with the firmness of someone who was already one of them.
He didn't look at me. Nor did he look back.
I returned home alone. That night, I told my parents what happened.
It was the last time I saw my brother alive. In the morning, my father and I went to the place where we found the cangaceiros and the beast. There was nothing, just the marks of the shots and a lot of dried blood. I can't say what happened to it, I only know that the Captain's men didn't bury it. My mother said it was a werewolf (lobisomem) and that they don't die from common bullets. Only if they are made of silver.

As for my brother, he got his revenge some time later. Even with all the security of his farm, the Colonel succumbed. My brother, along with some men from the band, invaded the main house. The Colonel was caught hiding in the house’s rafters. My brother didn't do anything to the scoundrel's wife; he and his hired gunmen were the ones who owed a debt. Everyone paid.

Years later, while selling cheese at the market in the town of Flores, reading the Diário de Pernambuco newspaper, I saw the report that said:
""Lampião and eleven other cangaceiros were killed by the Alagoas police."" They caught him in Angico. The patrol cut off everyone's head.
Among the names of the dead was my brother's.

I grabbed a coffee, I'm a mocha junkie trying to quit but lady chocolate was whispering seductively after yet another 7:30 am pointless meeting. I walked and put some stickers I made around town on my way to get a biscuit sandwich. I've been trying to make some crowmies(crow friends) since moving here and well I think I may have had about 4 bites of my sandwich before it became an offering to an enormous group of crows, I call them group because they looked pretty peaceful. I'm hungry and for some reason have decided now was the time to say ""Hey."" into the void in hopes to get a meow back like the supermodel black cat on my walk that posed for a quick photo shoot and some pets. If you're going to be that meow then please tell me a little bit ameowtya too, terrible.. and a good time to leave if none of this has you absolutely swooning already because the filter just gets thinner from here.

Anyway, been working from home since before we did it out of fear and have been open even longer, so yeah I'm like really cool or at least my therapist likes to convince me of that... and does a good job of that which is why I am here.

So yeah I play video games, not those kid war games, I'm talking like the real hardcore stuff. You know like roaming the streets of a post apocalyptic world as a cat... or a sexy android. . Seriously would be great if you play(and bonus if you got the references) but sadly I'm cursed with more complexity than pac-man as it would be blissful to go through life just eating pellets and ghosts. Unfortunately I like a lot and still exploring what I like. Lot's of typical PNW stuff: hiking, tasty vegetarian foods, identifying fungi, went to a glass animals and a strfkr show this year, also saw Geoffrey Asmus at the helium club, city and park walks, smoking a lot of weed to help with the daily existential crisis of being human in an age where we can share the culmination of all of human knowledge and yet were all watching the dementia kiddy diddling king of fools take a giant dump on anything resembling a healthy society, coastal trips, and well taking pictures of it all. I'd love for someone to give me a reason to cook for them as I need to escape this unending war zone of delicious food and make my own again.

The cold hard maybe fun facts?:

\-I got a vasectomy at 24 and believe everyone should have reproductive autonomy

\-I currently see one person

\-I have my own sanctuary and not really into shared or codependent living situations for myself

\-I don't believe in marriage, not looking for overly hierarchical people. It's cool if you are just as long as it doesn't show up in your other relationships.

\-I have the bandwidth both emotionally and realistically to offer a whole ass relationship

\-I got tested last month and regularly test

\-I believe informed consent and honest talks around risk are the best forms of protection

But I think we all can agree that beginner instruction books to Portuguese (and any other language) are pretty boring. So, with that problem in mind, I wrote *Portuguese, Please: A Rebellious Beginner's Guide to Brazilian and European Portuguese.*

This book goes into more depth than teaching you how to order a coffee or catch a train. You will develop an understanding of how the language functions. But the tone is rather casual. It is not like your typical, dry, academic textbook.

Instead, the language is taught through stories, including an American surfer who moves to Porto and meets a local girl. The chapter on numbers involves them going to an escape room. In order to get out, they need to know the dates of important events in Portuguese history.

This book is available in both kindle and paperback.

I'm not sure what to think about it.,"My friend and I are in our sixties and retired. He has been a family friend for as long as I can remember. We are both single.  I'm divorced he is a widower. Over the weekend we hooked up.  It was out of the blue and kind-of serial. 

My friend Mathew lives a few hours drive south of me. Him and I have been talking alot lately. I'm handy around the house. It's not the first time I helped him with little odd and ends. So it was no surprise when he asked me to come down to his place to give him a hand. 

I sure it was a ruse. I drove two hours and all I did was change a front door handle. Afterwards sat and we talked for hours like two old buddies do. 

When I was younger and single I fooled around with guys. But I got married and stayed faithful.  I can't say I haven't had thaughts about getting with a guy since my divorce. I never said or did a thing about it.  

I don't know if I was putting out a vibe or Matt was taking a chance.  I'm still trying to process everything.  We were talking about how lonely it can be living alone. As we both do.  I'm not sure if Matt took my hand or I took his. Anyway after that Matt knew exactly what he wanted and I willingly let him have his way. I find it a little suspicious that he had what we needed next to his bed. 
  
We woke up the next morning and took our showers. We didn't talk about what we did. We had coffee then I went home.  We texted back and forth a bit. We both agreed we liked it.  

I'm not sure what to do, or what I want to do. I wouldn't mind doing it again. It didn't hurt but I'm not sure a man my age should let another guy do that. I wouldn't want my ex wife or my kids to know that I am having sex with a guy. Especially since the guy is Matt and everyone knows him. . 

If I did want to do something again, should I call him. Or do I wait for him to call me. I'm happy about what happened. It's nice having something like this in my life. I keep wondering how he knew I'd go along with it.

Its hard to say why but last night I had another one. Things were good, things felt normal. We were chatting like nothing had ever happened. Like we did as adolescentes. They say dreams are subconscious fears or desires. As cliche as it sounds, I think my brain is working hard on closure. When we split I didnt know how to give you what you needed, and didnt know what I wanted. That was eight years ago. Yet I still dream of you. I see your face perfectly. 

This morning after waking up early and not being able to drift back to you, in a moment of morning haze, pre-coffee brain maybe, or just missing you, I found your contact and called. It was 7:08, I just wanted it to ring. I didnt even know if it was still you. After two tones someone picked up. There was a hesitant and possibly confused ""Hello?"". They had a female voice that was lower and sultry like I remember yours being. But nobody was supposed to answer. Of course it could've been a completely random person who I had just bothered in the early morning. Perhaps someone inherited your number... I quicky hung up. It was like a scene from a movie. My heart raced when not two seconds later your contact appeared on my screen. I let it go to voicemail. If it was you, you'd know it was me who called. 

I didnt expect you to pick up. You were very clear eight years ago when you said you it was the end and you never wanted to speak to me again. In retrospect it was the best decision for both our sakes. We caught ourselves in a cycle that I was in too much pain and agnst to break.... You had blocked me on everything. I tried calling the same number weeks after our schism, no one answered. 

I guess I just wanted to say I hope life is well. I hope you have found success, health, and fullfilment. In a moment of fleeting dreams I needed to know you are out there.

It's been what, 9 years? I do not remember your voice nor your smell anymore. But you know what's funny thing about people? You remember how they treated you.

I remember how you got me coffee on the night we had an event at school. I remember how I went to your house to help you with the laundry and we ended up playing with bubbles. I remember the night we went to Tagaytay and how we were both amazed with the stars and how we thought we could reach it.

I remember our highschool prom, the night I wore a gown for the first time. We were dancing, our face right next to each other. I slept on my dress while smiling from ear to ear coz for the first time, I felt real happy.

I remember how we talked about marriage, having babies. How we were so afraid of the future. You went to college, I went to work.

We would meet after school, you in your uniform, me holding the vegetables I bought. Trying to sneak time to meet before you go home and me, before going back to the carinderia where I stayed to save up for college.

You would tell me things about hating your course, how hard was it to study and I will be there listening, hoping, I, could also go to school.

Months have passed and somewhat I have managed to get myself a job at a fastfood chain. I can now maybe afford to study while working.

But the weight of the responsibilities to provide for my family was more important than to pursue studying, so I didn't.

We broke up, we tried to make up but it didn't work. I thought maybe, you are not for me and I am not for you. I tried to find what's out there.

It has been 9 years, Mai. You know what I found? You. It has been you..

Paano ko ba sasabihin na ikaw parin? Kasi it's still you. And I know it's just foolish to say this here as you are now married.

But maybe this is what this subreddit is for.

Thank you, Mai and maybe, in next life?

A buddy of mine met his current partner through Reddit, so I figured I’d give it a shot! I've been traveling across the country (working remotely) and have been having a blast. It’s definitely had its high and lows, and I've met a bunch of different folks along the way -- but finding those lasting connections is obviously a little tough with this lifestyle. Hence why I'm here on Reddit.

Here's a bit about me:

* I'm 40, male, and work in the medical field.
* I’ve been traveling full-time since last summer. I started on the east coast, made my way through the Ozarks, and now I’m slowly meandering west.
* I love cooking, especially when I can do it outside. My go-to is a cast-iron skillet breakfast hash with whatever’s on hand -- potatoes, eggs, peppers. Hot sauce is a must, let's be real, haha.
* I'm a big reader. Right now it’s a mix of Steinbeck, some travel essays, and a book on neuroscience I like to pretend I understand.
* I used to be a runner, but now I’m more of a ""slow hiker who stops for photos and snacks"" if you get what I mean.
* I grew up near the ocean. I'm not afraid to laugh at myself, like the time I accidentally locked my keys (and shoes) inside the van at a rest stop in the middle of nowhere. Hey, at least it made for a fun story, right?
* I’m pretty low-key. I'm content with campfires, podcasts, stargazing, and the occasional dive bar conversation with strangers.
* I value good communication and people who can sit comfortably in both silence and long talks.
* My playlists jump from indie folk to old soul to 90s hip-hop, depending on the mood.
* I try to practice gratitude, even on WiFi-free days.

What I'm Looking For:

* Someone grounded, kind, and emotionally intelligent.
* someone who’s curious about the world, loves learning, and doesn’t mind taking the scenic route once in a while.
* I’m drawn to folks who can find beauty in simple things like a good cup of good coffee, a quiet morning - stuff like that.
* You don’t have to be a traveler (though that’s always a bonus), just open-minded, thoughtful, and looking to connect

My apologies for the length because this might be long. Trigger warning alcoholism.

I 21F am considering cutting off my dad 60M from my life. A little backstory, my dad has been an alcoholic for as long as I can remember. One time when I was around 13 I ate my sister, now 23F, leftovers and obviously she was upset and told my dad. My dad already being drunk came to my room yelling and even shoved me. Around the same time my dad told my sister and I that he hopes we get raped. My sister and I told my mom and she talked to my dad and the drinking got a little better. When I was 18 I was gaining a little bit of weight I was 6’0 and 180 pounds and he made a comment to me saying when was the last time you went to the gym. Obviously I’m only telling the bad things my dad has done but he would take my sister and I to sports practices and school activities when we were young since my mom would work 24 hour shifts 2-3 days a week. But he would almost always complain about having to drive us. My mom was the one who would go to almost all of our games and practices. My parents would fight semi often when i was a kid. 

Around the time I turned 18 my mom, now 50F, started losing a lot of weight after my grandma died because she didn’t want her health to become like my grandmas. At the same my mom started going out more with friends to the bar since she never did when I was growing up and now that I was an adult she had the free time to go out. My mom didn’t want my dad to come with her when she went out because he tends to be a fun killer, he doesn’t really have a filter and often says things without thinking about what he is actually saying. 

Because my mom started losing weight and then going out more my dad assumed and would openly accuse my mom of cheating, which she obviously wasn’t. My dad would start blaring YouTube videos about narcissistic women on the TV in the living room and would tell me about how my mom is a narcissist. Eventually my mom was fed up and filed for a divorce. This is where things kinda blew up.

My dad would start texting my mom saying he would kill himself and one time the cops had to be called because he actually grabbed a knife so my mom pushed him away from her. My dad would constantly involve me even when I asked him not to because I want a relationship with both of them and dont want to be expected to pick sides, even though just based off of my observations I would side with my mom. 

I wanna point out my mom is the family breadwinner making probably 200k a year working 3 jobs while my dad worked 1 job making at most 50k and he wouldn’t do house chores all he did was turn on his vacuum robot and sit on the couch and drink beers.

My dad would refuse to cook dinner for me and would order a whole giant pizza for himself so my mom told him that he wasn’t allowed to eat her groceries if he cant even cook for his own daughter. This is when my dad started taking the thermostat off the wall because he didn’t like that my mom locked it because she would set it to 68-70 and he wanted it warmer instead of just wearing a jacket. My mom bought a new thermostat with her personal money and upped his petty by putting the coffee pot and coffee beans and grinder in her bedroom since they weren’t sleeping in the same room.

My mom would often ask me to sleep at my bf M22’s house because of how bad arguments would get and she didn’t know if he would lash out. At one point my dad threatened to tow my bf’s car for no reason. My dad also knows how close my mom was with her mom, my grandma, but has made comments to my mom about how she would be so disappointed in the person my mom has become. Among other really shitty comments regarding my mom’s dead parents who died pretty recently being my grandma in 2022 and my grandpa in 2024.

My mom also is going to have to pay him alimony from all her jobs and he is going to be taking a good chunk out of her 2 pensions. A couple months before my mom and I moved out my dad even came down to my room and said “I’m gonna do whatever I can in my power to fuck your mom over in this divorce, and if you get fucked over in that process I don’t care.” Now that my mom and I moved out my mom still pays half the mortgage which gives her the right to go back into our old house whenever she wants to grab things we didn’t get during the big part of the move. My dad didn’t like that she would come by when he wasn’t home so he illegally started barricading the front door so we can’t come in. Now that we have the physical separation from my dad and my mom ignores most of his texts and calls he has started threatening to try and find out where we live. 

I just celebrated my 21st birthday and all I got from him was a “Happy Birthday” text, no happy 21st or asking if I have plans, nothing. My dad basically only calls or texts me to tell my mom to answer him or to bitch about my mom to me.

I want to cut him out of my life because of everything he has put us through but at the same time in the back of my head I keep thinking but he’s your dad he helped raise you. My dad has told me I’m an AH for kinda siding with my mom.

Again any advice on how to navigate this would be hugely appreciated.",1,1763510085.0,AlAnon,4,1.0,False
1p0s4be,https://www.reddit.com/r/OfficePolitics/comments/1p0s4be/i_just_had_the_worst_interview_of_my_entire_life/,I just had the worst interview of my entire life.,"About 3 months ago, I applied for a job and had an interview with the hiring manager and someone from HR. The interview was going very well, but afterward, they told me they thought I was a better fit for a senior role on the team. I told them I was very happy with the original role I applied for, but they kept pushing me to consider this senior position.

A few days later, the hiring manager called me and told me her director wanted to meet with me about this senior position. They insisted the final interview had to be at the company headquarters, and they wanted me to go as soon as possible. I had other commitments, so I couldn't make the time they suggested, but they chose the first available slot I offered. I had to quickly rearrange my schedule and cancel a few things to make it.

I traveled 5 hours to get to their location. The interview with the director went very well, and they seemed to really like the case study presentation I had prepared. We discussed everything - expected salary (they said my request was well within their budget), the team, relocation, everything. The director even told me to my face that she liked me, which, frankly, no director has ever said to my face in an interview before.

She told me she would be on vacation the following week but that they would get back to me the week after she returned. Anyway, about 4 weeks went by with complete silence. Then, I received a generic, automated rejection email. No personal call, no feedback, nothing. So in the end, I didn't get either of the two jobs, even though they were the ones who got me excited about the senior role.

And to top it all off, they had promised to reimburse my travel expenses (train ticket and hotel), but when I followed up, they simply said they couldn't cover them. This is a massive Fortune 500 company, yet the coffee shop below my apartment has more professionalism and decency. I'm not even going to bother asking for feedback, because it would surely just be some canned, HR-approved excuse.",12,1763509953.0,OfficePolitics,3,1.0,False
1p0s43f,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1p0s43f,Tiny living room in 101 year old craftsman home,"Hi everyone,

I’m really struggling to get my living room to feel right. Something just feels off, and I can’t quite put my finger on it. I would love your advice on how to make it functional, cozy, and cohesive. We have a north facing living room that’s dark (hence the weird skylight) and most of the 101 year old character has been stripped over the years.

Here is where I’m struggling:

- I’m thinking about Roman shades in an oat linen color, but I’m worried they might wash out the room.

- We want a new couch, but we’re having a hard time committing to a color.

- We don’t have a great conversation area. 

- The coffee table feels awkward and in the way.

- We like our new rug, so I’d like to work around that.

- The dining area has to be in this space unless we move it into our small kitchen.

- We need a clear path of travel from the front door.

- Our TV is in a bit of an awkward nook (we have a Samsung Frame TV).

- We’re also considering curtains, but again, unsure about color and style.

Honestly, we need all the help we can get. I’m struggling to figure out how to make everything feel cohesive while keeping it functional and cozy. Any suggestions on layout, furniture colors, window treatments, or general style direction would be amazing!

My apologies for the length because this might be long. Trigger warning alcoholism.

I 21F am considering cutting off my dad 60M from my life. A little backstory, my dad has been an alcoholic for as long as I can remember. One time when I was around 13 I ate my sister, now 23F, leftovers and obviously she was upset and told my dad. My dad already being drunk came to my room yelling and even shoved me. Around the same time my dad told my sister and I that he hopes we get raped. My sister and I told my mom and she talked to my dad and the drinking got a little better. When I was 18 I was gaining a little bit of weight I was 6’0 and 180 pounds and he made a comment to me saying when was the last time you went to the gym. Obviously I’m only telling the bad things my dad has done but he would take my sister and I to sports practices and school activities when we were young since my mom would work 24 hour shifts 2-3 days a week. But he would almost always complain about having to drive us. My mom was the one who would go to almost all of our games and practices. My parents would fight semi often when i was a kid.

""enjoy your childhood while it lasts"", ""you're an adult for the majority of your life"", ""sure it's rough, but being a teenager probably the most freeing time of your life"", but i'm tired of it. i hate it, i hate going to school, i hate seeing my grades and feeling stupid no matter how high or low i score, i hate being isolated, i hate having no friends, i hate being in a body that doesn't feel like its mine, i hate acting like someone i'm not, i hate sitting at dinner between two parents who have started to hate each other more and more, i hate sitting in my room doing nothing, i hate feeling worthless, i hate feeling trapped, i hate my life, i hate that i could never think to sincerely end my life.

i barely have anybody in my life. i don't want to talk to my parents because i know for a fact they're transphobic, i hate everyone at my school and most of the people i interact with, and even if there is someone i think is cool i'm too nervous and awkward and stupid as fuck to actually talk to them. the only two friends i can say i really have live in different states, and haven't had it in me to actually reach out and talk to them because they have better things to do.

i find myself fantasizing running away and starting my own life. i live on the countryside, so there isn't any way to walk out in the middle of the night without getting run over. i'd go to school as normal, but i'd bring all of my essentials and things i wanted to take with me and secretly turn in all of my stuff that belonged to the school. when school ends, i'd take an uber or lyft or something and have them drive me to an airport. i would have about 40-50 minutes before my mom would notice i'm not home because i take the bus, though if she's at work i'd have closer to over an hour.

in an ideal world, i'd live in edinburgh. i'd live in a cozy older flat or small house and wear colorful suits and ties and coats with vintage design, and i'd finally grow in a fun mustache after getting ftm surgeries and taking testosterone. i would work in a large library that had a coffee shop attached, take long walks in the foggy streets, all that stupid movie stuff that i would give my life to actually live out.

but no, i'm a 15 year old girl who can't even tell if what she thinks is normal or another fun little autism diagnosis. one who constantly feels like a failure if nothing is exactly as i thought it'd be, one who can't even get through highschool like a normal person. one who takes showers in the dark because i can't stand looking at myself and seeing a female body.

i started looking into how much it would cost to move to edinburgh. couple thousand, closer to one-hundred thousand depending on where i decided to live or if i bought a house or flat, and that doesn't even include ftm transitions. i can't even get a damn job and at least try to start saving up. i'd probably have to save it as cash anyways, my mom would be able to see my debit card and what i spent/earned. probably have to get a my own debit card, probably wouldn't even be able to get an ID or change my name if i'm still technically a kid.

i know i just have to hold out until school is over, then i can move away from my family and make as many dumb decisions as i want, but days feel like years and just the time i spend in school feels like dragged out torture, like it just never ends. i know it's stupid to complain, and honestly at this point i just feel like a whining teen who dreams up of a future that could never actually happen, like when a kid claims that they'll become a famous actor. maybe that's the one grace i can have while i'm still a kid.",1,1763509564.0,offmychest,0,1.0,False

1p0rxli,https://www.reddit.com/r/TwoHotTakes/comments/1p0rxli/i_drove_4_hours_and_got_stood_up/,I drove 4 hours and got stood up,"So I met this girl online and we hit it off pretty quick. We had a lot in common and we liked each other's company. She let me know very early on she wasn't looking for a relationship and I respected that, as much as I liked her.

Time goes on and we're planning to meet up. We plan a weekend of sex, cuddling, chatting and a movie, what could go wrong? I live 4 hours away from her so I knew going into it that it was going to be a gamble because I was going to be spending like $160 in gas. I asked for affirmation several times and she gave it to me every single time. We almost planned to a tee every single thing we were going to be doing. This planning process lasted at least a week and the day before my trip we got as hot and heavy as we ever did.

We were comfortably sending nudes and even telling each other how much we like each other. I also asked her what the odds were that by the end of the night Saturday she'd be my girlfriend. Our relationship grew very quickly and it felt like she was past the point of not wanting a boyfriend. She gave me an 80% chance of becoming her boyfriend by the end of the weekend. So you could say I was pretty damn excited to go up. I wake up at 9:00 a.m. which is extremely early for me. I'd already packed the night before and I was running off very little sleep. 

I get into her city at around 2:00. During the trip I'd been calling her because she clearly was not awake. She ended up waking up at around 1:30 and by the time I got there it took her an additional hour to finish getting ready. I didn't complain. I didn't even make any comments. I was honestly just excited to meet her. 

She walks out and I don't think I've ever smiled as hard as I did when I saw her for the first time. She was beautiful. She was everything I wanted her to be. I opened her door for her like a gentleman and the first place we went to was the pet store to look at hamsters and stuff. She’d expressed how much she loves them and how cute they are. So I knew this would likely win her over to some degree. 

Then we go to the hotel. Thankfully she pitched in $100 for this hotel, which I very much appreciated and I made sure to let her know that. I planned on paying for EVERYTHING else. We get in the room and immediately she's on her phone. It's 2025, she’s very active online, I get it. I lay in bed next to her and I start hinting that I want to cuddle. She doesn't seem super interested in cuddling which is odd because that's one of the main things she said she was excited for.

I in no way forced myself on to her, she eventually said we could cuddle and we started. At this moment I could tell she was still a bit nervous seeing as she was meeting me for the first time which is completely understandable. I made sure to tell her “if I do anything that makes you uncomfortable let me know immediately.” She agreed and even said “no shit."" Time goes on. She's still on her phone and I'm basically just trying to commence what we had already planned on doing. I start sliding my hand up her shirt and before I get anywhere I ask her, “Is this okay?” she says “yes.”

So there I am, handful of titty, huge smile on my face. I whisper in her ear, “If this is the most I get to do, I'm content with that,” which in hindsight is very foreshadowing.

I start with some cutesy talk and giving her little pecks here and there like on the head and the neck and stuff. I'm head over heels for this girl and she knows it. I'm just hoping to get some sort of reaction out of her. She gives me literally nothing. So I do what any respectable man would do and I stop everything. She turns 180° and lays on the other side of the bed. At this point I'm simply confused as to what her intentions are. It feels like she brought me all the way up here on false pretenses and everything just feels off. She’s clearly a bit talker over text. So I ask her “are we going to do anything at any point?” I wasn't trying to rush her. I was genuinely just curious. She tells me “we will later.”

I also turned 180° just to be able to talk to her and I start rubbing her back. She tells me she likes what I'm doing so I keep doing it. I tell her it's not so easy to do over the sweater so she tells me to put my hand under. No big deal. I massage her back. She laughs when I get to her neck which I think was adorable, and she was clearly enjoying it. She even mentioned several other times that night how much she loved my massages. 

I was really aiming to be more sensual than anything with this girl. I really liked her and I really wanted her to see that. I didn't push things farther than they needed to go, and I was willing to wait for her to be ready to do whatever we were going to do.

Time goes on. We're chilling, talking and then she asks to go back to her dorm to grab some things to bring to the hotel, pretty understandable. I did find it a bit weird that she didn't bring anything to the hotel on her first trip here, but I didn't really question it.

I drive her back to the dorm and when she's inside she texts me. “Hey! I might just stay here tonight if that's okay.” At this moment I felt so many emotions. I drove all the way up here, 4 hours away from home and she's going to stand me up like this? She explained that she wasn't comfortable and I simply asked her to elaborate which she didn't. The second she mentioned being uncomfortable, I knew that the night was not going to go the way I intended it to go. Her comfort is the most important thing, I will definitely put a big emphasis on that. I don't think I personally did anything that would have made her uncomfortable and if I did why isn't she telling me? The whole thing is definitely a bit fast, but judging by our conversations it seemed that she didn't mind that one bit. I was also very willing to be patient with things. I honestly just wanted to cuddle her to sleep.

If she didn't plan on moving fast, why did she ask me to get a hotel? I originally told her I’d just do a day trip, but she convinced me to stay the night. Why would she lead me on this much if she had no intentions with me? To be frank, I was pretty heartbroken. We were originally going to go see a movie after she grabbed stuff from the dorm but I simply told her not to bother.

I took her to a coffee shop to get a drink and then parked in the parking lot to talk for a little bit. I kept asking questions without pushing anything. “Why are you uncomfortable? Is there something I did? Is there anything I could do to make the experience more enjoyable for you? Why don't we just go back to the hotel and talk for a bit? If you want me to drive you back, I will in a heartbeat.”

She had zero interest. I also have really bad anxiety and hate being alone, so imagine being stranded in a different province 4 hours away from anyone you know. The second I dropped her off I started going crazy. I called her and told her “hey I'm not doing great.” I explained my anxiety and explained why I wouldn't like being alone. Since that phone conversation that night it has been radio silence.

If she's not interested in me that's perfectly fine, but she's been acting like nothing's wrong. She messages me maybe one time a day and it's drier than a desert. I did not do anything in that hotel room that we didn't previously talk about, and I did not do a single thing without her permission. 

I sense there's a mental maturity issue here but it's still really hard for me to wrap my head around. Am I in the wrong here or is she? If anything needs to be further elaborated I will certainly do so. It doesn't need to be said, but I will also mention that I've been fucking depressed about this shit. She seemed perfect- that weekend should have been perfect. If she was at least honest about everything, it wouldn't bother me this much, but ghosting me after everything? I wasted a whole ass day, and I value my time.

\*EDIT 1: We planned on going to the hotel to do stuff immediately. We were hot and heavy leading up to the day. Even with that being the case, I was still patient, allowing her time to get comfortable.\*

\*EDIT 2: My issue isn't her discomfort, it's the lack of communication. A simple ""I'm not interested,"" or ""I don't think this is going to work,"" is a lot better for my mental health then SILENCE.\*

TLDR: I drove 4 hours to see a girl who basically stood me up. There were zero boundaries, but I was still respectful. She has since abandoned our friendship without explanation.",1,1763509466.0,TwoHotTakes,14,0.67,False

\- Is it a good flavour for kids? my previous go-to chocolate cake before kids had a more adult flavour (dark choc, coffee etc)

\- Is this the same recipe as the forever chocolate cake in the dinner cookbook? - I've heard the book one is excellent but I haven't bought the book as I'm vegetarian so can't make most of the book recipes, but I've really enjoyed the website recipes and LOVE the vanilla cake

Thanks! :)

1p0rvpd,https://www.kbtx.com/2025/11/18/fired-bryan-federal-prison-nurse-says-ghislaine-maxwell-is-receiving-special-treatment-she-has-emails/,Fired Bryan federal prison nurse says Ghislaine Maxwell is receiving special treatment — and she has the emails,"Noella Turnage was fired from her job at the prison last week. Monday, she sat down with KBTX’s Rusty Surette

We chose a breakfast restaurant in College Station to meet on Monday afternoon, with hopes we’d have an uninterrupted discussion about her time at the women’s Federal Prison Camp in Bryan. She’d been fired from the facility for sharing communications from its most notorious inmate, convicted child-sex trafficker Ghislaine Maxwell, with members of the House Judiciary Committee in Washington, D.C.

Her name is Noella Turnage; she’s 46, resides in south Brazos County, and is a longtime healthcare professional who had been employed by the Bureau of Federal Prisons since 2019.

She is also the so-called ‘whistleblower’ mentioned last week in a CNN report that said Maxwell, who is serving a 20-year prison sentence for her role in the sexual abuse operation operated by Jeffrey Epstein, had copies of her correspondence with an attorney and others shared with Maryland representative Jaime Raskin.

“I actually emailed them from work, from my Bureau of Prisons email address, and said, ‘Hey, this is who I am. This is where I work, and I have some things I think you might be interested in, and documents you may be interested in.’ I didn’t even specify what it was,” said Turnage.

Within 30 minutes, a staff member from Raskin’s office reached out. Over the past couple of weeks, she’s received numerous calls from staff members asking follow-up questions.

Turnage would only let KBTX’s Rusty Surette visually inspect a handful of Maxwell’s emails she had printed and saved.

“I have not shared them with anyone other than the committee,” said Turnage, calling reports that she shared them with members of the media inaccurate.

Recently, Erik Ortiz at NBC News shared a report detailing some of the emails from Maxwell, including her apparent pleasure at being transferred to the Bryan facility from a more restrictive prison in Florida.

“My situation is improved by being in Bryan,” Maxwell wrote in one email.

“The institution is run in an orderly fashion, which makes for a safer, more comfortable environment for all people concerned, inmates and guards alike,” she wrote in another.

Ortiz shared in his report that the emails, first obtained by Turnage, were made available to NBC News through the House Judiciary Committee.

So, why did Turnage do this, and how did she go from being a nurse at the prison to having access to inmate emails?

Turnage says the move was in retaliation for her speaking up about working conditions. She called prison leadership in Bryan toxic and dismissive, especially toward incarcerated women with serious health needs.

Monday, Turnage spent close to an hour outlining several cases in which she documented the mistreatment of inmates that she says triggered her complaints and, ultimately, retaliation, including being reassigned to the “phone room.”

“They call it prison jail,” said Turnage, who said her new duties included monitoring inmate calls and emails. “I would be looking for any evidence that they’re doing something they shouldn’t be. Like, are they trying to smuggle in drugs? Are they doing this? Are they whatever? But these women aren’t risking that, not for the most part. And same as emails, you’re monitoring for anything they shouldn’t be doing. Usually on the phone, the biggest thing you run into is they’ll call a family member who then conference calls somebody else that they’re not supposed to be talking to.”

Turnage says she was already troubled by the special privileges being given to Maxwell by Warden Tanisha Hall and other higher-ups at the facility, including Warden Hall personally handling all incoming mail addressed to Maxwell. Turnage also described private, catered-style visitation arrangements for Maxwell, which she says other high-profile inmates like Elizabeth Holmes never received, even though Bureau of Prisons policy explicitly prohibits even the appearance of favoritism toward inmates.

“There was the whole thing about closing down the compound for her to have a visit,” said Turnage, who claims Maxwell’s family was allowed to join private meetings often disguised as legal consultations.

KBTX has repeatedly reached out to Warden Hall and the Bureau of Prisons for an interview about Maxwell’s treatment. Our messages have not been returned.

“I’m still trying to figure out who exactly her attorney is. Apparently, she’s got about 10 of them. Go figure on that. I guess maybe they can bring everybody and say it’s a legal visit? I don’t know, but they’re going to have an area cornered off for you, so it won’t be a problem coming in. They’re going to provide drinks, coffee, snacks, and all this stuff.”

Turnage says the decision to print, save, and then share some of Maxwell’s emails came down to a gut feeling.

She says some of Maxwell’s outgoing messages looked “coded” with odd spacing, letter substitutions, and formatting that didn’t match other inmate emails. So, she printed out full threads at work and took them home to study, convinced something was off. After seeing a Wall Street Journal story about Maxwell’s treatment at the Bryan prison and Rep. Jamie Raskin’s inquiries, Turnage saw an opening and shared the emails.

Turnage insisted on Monday that she wasn’t paid to share the emails with anyone, despite accusations that she was receiving financial compensation.

“I’m like, really? Then why am I still sitting here eating corn dogs? I guess the check got lost in the mail. I don’t know.”

Turnage also said she plans to seek legal action against the Bureau of Prisons for what happened during her time of employment.

Asked about critics who say she violated inmate privacy by sharing emails, Turnage argues she was following her legal and ethical duty as a whistleblower: when you see evidence of law, policy, or regulation being broken, you are required to report it. She says she did so through channels she felt were most effective, arguing her previous complaints about the treatment of inmates led to her being pushed out of her job as a nurse.

As Turnage finished her glass of iced tea and took her final puff on a cigarette, she said her ultimate goal was to put a spotlight on her now-former place of employment, where she believes staff and inmates were mistreated. Now, she feels satisfied to see the worldwide attention on the facility as new Maxwell-Epstein headlines continue to dominate the news cycle.

When sharing her story with KBTX and other media, Turnage admits safety has crossed her mind, but she isn’t concerned.

You know the type: the asshole in the comments saying “Actually, that’s just pareidolia and bad audio compression.”

That was me. For eight years, I made a living taking people’s monsters apart and showing them the loose screws. I’d go into “haunted” houses, review grainy CCTV, rewatch “demonic” social media posts frame-by-frame and send back a neat little report:

It’s the wind. It’s mould. It’s your neighbour’s Wi-Fi camera. It’s grief.

They paid me to tell them it wasn’t real.

And I was always right.

Until I learned about the Midnight Man.

I didn’t find him on some cursed forum or ancient book. He found me in a client email that, at first, looked like all the rest.

Subject: URGENT – Please Prove This Is Fake.

Hi Daniel,

My daughter played a game she found on TikTok. The Midnight Game. Now she won’t sleep, won’t eat, and says ‘he’ is in the house. Can you please help convince her it’s not real? I’ll pay whatever you charge for an emergency visit.

There was an attachment:

RULES FOR THE MIDNIGHT GAME.docx

I almost deleted it.

Games like that are all the same: candles, salt, mirrors, “you must do this or else.” Urban legends repackaged for bored teenagers.

But then I read the rules.

Rule 1: Write your full name on a piece of paper. Add one drop of your blood. Place it in front of your front door.

Rule 2: Exactly at 12:00 AM, knock on your own door 22 times. The final knock must land whilst the clock is still 12:00

Rule 3: Open the door, then blow out your candle and close the door again. You have just invited the Midnight Man inside.

Rule 4: Relight your candle immediately.

Rule 5: From 12:01 AM until 3:33 AM, you must keep moving. Do not stay in one place for more than a few seconds.

Rule 6: If your candle goes out, immediately draw a circle of salt around yourself and stay inside it until 3:33 AM.

Rule 7: Do NOT look directly at him. If you do, he will show you your worst fear. Most people do not survive that.

Rule 8: Do NOT speak to, touch, or acknowledge any person you see in your house between 12 and 3:33 AM, unless you are absolutely sure they are real.

Rule 9: Do NOT leave the house during the game.

Rule 10: The game ends at 3:33 AM. If you are alive and in one piece, you “win.” Nothing will happen… for a while.

At the end, a line in bold:

If you fail to follow these rules, the Midnight Man will claim you.

I scoffed. The whole thing read like a fanfic version of every other “summoning game” out there.

I emailed the mother back, set a time, and drove out the next night, halfway across the county to a tidy semi-detached in a normal estate. The kind of place where the worst thing that should ever happen is a wheelie bin going missing.

Her name was Laura. She looked like she hadn’t slept in days.

“Thank you for coming,” she said, ushering me inside. “I know it’s stupid. I know it’s just… kids scaring themselves, but she’s not eating. She won’t go upstairs alone. She screams if the lights go off. I just, I need someone with… science.” She gestured vaguely at my bag. “With gear. To show her it’s fake.”

Kids were often my worst cases. Adults want their fears fixed. Teenagers want their fears believed. I’d learned that the hard way.

“Where is she now?” I asked.

“In her room. Won’t come out.” She paused. “She said he sits outside her door now. Every night, waiting. I tried telling her if he was real, we’d all see him, but she just cried harder.”

I heard it then, a soft, rhythmic tapping from upstairs.

Tap.

Tap.

Tap.

“Is that her?” I asked.

Laura swallowed. “She says it’s his fingers.”

I told myself it was a loose pipe.

The girl, Mia, was fourteen, grey-faced and hollow-eyed, sitting on her bed in yesterday’s clothes. Her curtains were taped shut. Her bedside lamp was on, plus a battery lantern and a string of fairy lights. No shadows left if she could help it.

“I’m not crazy,” she said before I even introduced myself. “Mum says you’re going to tell me it’s all in my head, but it’s not. It’s in the house.”

“I’m not here to say you’re crazy,” I said, pulling out my standard kit: EMF meter, thermal camera, audio recorder. Props, mostly. They made people feel like I was doing something real. “I’m here to see what happened and explain it. That’s all. Start from the beginning.”

She took a breath that shuddered all the way through her.

“We saw it on social media. Me and Becca. ‘The Midnight Game Challenge.’ You have to play it alone, but you can, like, be on call with someone else playing. So we did. We followed the steps. Wrote our names. Blood. Candle. Knocked 22 times. Let him in.” Her eyes flicked to the bedroom door as she said it. “It was a joke. We were laughing at the comments.”

“How long ago?” I asked.

“Four nights.” She dug at her thumb with a chewed nail. “It was fine at first. Dark, creepy, whatever. I heard stuff, but I thought it was my brain. You know? TikTok sound effects, neighbours. But then my candle went out.”

She gripped the duvet. Her knuckles went white.

“I didn’t have salt. I forgot that part. So I used sugar. I thought it was the same. He… didn’t.” Her eyes went glassy, unfocused. “The air went cold. Not like ‘I’m scared’ cold. Like freezer-burn cold. Something moved behind me and I knew, I just knew, if I turned around I’d see...” She cut herself off, breathing fast. “He didn’t show me monsters. He showed me things that haven’t happened yet. Things that haven’t happened and can’t happen and will happen and...”

I held up a hand. “Okay. It’s okay. We don’t have to go into that. Can I ask,did anything physical happen? Scratches, nosebleeds, objects moved?”

She lifted her hair without a word.

On the back of her neck, at the base of her skull, the skin looked… wrong. Not like a cut. Like frostbite in the shape of fingertips. Four on one side, thumb on the other. As if something cold had cupped the back of her head and squeezed.

I’ve seen kids dig their nails into their own skin. I’ve seen self-harm, psychosomatic rashes, hysterical bruising.

This wasn’t that.

I took a picture, pretending it didn’t rattle me.

“I hear him every night,” she whispered. “He didn’t leave at 3:33. That’s a lie. He stays if you lose. He just makes you wish he’d kill you quick instead.”

Something thumped softly outside the door.

Tap.

Tap.

Tap.

Her eyes went wide. She grabbed my wrist.

“Don’t open it,” she hissed. “He doesn’t like being checked on.”

I cleared my throat, forced my hand away, and opened the door.

The landing was empty.

But the EMF meter, which had been flat, spiked so hard it squealed.

I could have walked away. I should have. I could have told Laura: It’s stress. It’s TikTok. It’s mass suggestion. Send them both to therapy, file my report, take the money.

But I’d seen that frostbite handprint. I’d seen the EMF spike in a dead-quiet house with modern wiring.

And I’d heard the way Mia said “He stays.”

I made a mistake then.

I let my pride answer.

“Alright,” I told Laura in the kitchen. The house lights felt too bright somehow, like they were trying too hard. “I’ll prove it’s fake. Not just to her,to you, to me, to him if he’s listening. I’ll play it. Here. Tonight. Properly. Every rule, every step, documented.”

Laura paled. “You don’t have to do that. I just wanted...”

“You wanted proof,” I said. “If I play exactly the way the instructions say and nothing happens, you can show Mia the footage. Sometimes that’s what it takes.”

That’s the thing about debunkers. Deep down, we’re daredevils with a lab coat on. We poke the bear because we’re so sure it’s just a guy in a costume.

Her hands trembled as she made me coffee. “If… if you’re sure.”

I wasn’t. Not really. But I was curious, and curiosity is just fear that thinks it’s clever.

We started at 11:30 PM.

I set my equipment up in the hallway: tripod camera facing the front door, secondary camera on a bookshelf covering the hall and stairs, audio recorder on the console table. I took baseline readings: EMF low, ambient temperature a little chilly but normal for an old British house in October.

Mia stayed in her room. She refused to come downstairs. I didn’t blame her.

Laura hovered in the living room, clutching her dressing gown like a shield.

The rules said I had to play alone. So at 11:55, I asked Laura to go upstairs and close her door.

“If you hear anything,” she started.

“I’ll shout,” I said. “Or I’ll be embarrassed tomorrow when I show you how boring this was.”

She didn’t smile.

At 11:58, I sat on the floor in front of the door, knees creaking, and prepared.

I wrote my full name on the paper in block capitals.

Daniel Matthew Cole.

I pricked my finger with a sterilised lancet from my kit (ghost-hunting gear overlaps a lot with diabetes gear, it turns out). One drop of blood, dark and heavy, hit the paper and spread.

I placed it on the doormat.

My candle was a plain white pillar, the sort you buy for power cuts. I lit it and turned off every other light in the house.

Instantly, the world shrank to the small, flickering circle around me.

The camera’s red recording light winked back from the darkness.

I checked my phone. 11:59:37.

My heart was beating faster than I liked.

“It’s a ritual,” I muttered to myself. “Rituals feel powerful because they’re structured. That’s all.”

The minutes ticked.

When my lock screen changed to 12:00:00, I started knocking.

Rule 2: Exactly at 11:59 AM, knock on your own door 22 times. The final knock must land at 12:00:00.

“What precisely counts as ‘land’?” I’d scoffed earlier, reading it. “Do they know how milliseconds work?”

It’s funny what your brain latches onto when you’re scared. Stupid details.

I counted the knocks under my breath. One, two… nine… fifteen… twenty…

The candle flame fluttered with every impact, smearing shadows across the hallway walls.

“Twenty-one,” I whispered.

I held my breath. There was something obscene about hitting your own front door from the inside, like trying to get out of your own life.

“Twenty-two.”

My knuckles connected with wood and the moment they did, the entire house seemed to… drop. Like a lift juddering at the bottom of a shaft.

My phone ticked over to 12:00:00.

Rule 3: Open the door, then blow out your candle and close the door again. You have just invited the Midnight Man inside.

I unlocked the door, opened it a crack. The night outside was misty and still. No wind, no foxes, no passing cars. The street looked wrong in candlelight, all hard edges and over-saturated shadows.

I blew the candle out.

The dark that rushed in felt thick. Not just absence-of-light dark. Presence dark. Heavy. Watching.

I closed the door. Locked it. Heart hammering.

My hands shook just enough that it took me two tries to relight the candle.

Rule 4: Relight your candle immediately.

I managed it...

Well done, I thought. You have successfully set the mood for yourself, idiot.

I checked the time again. 12:01.

Three hours and thirty-two minutes to go.

People imagine these games as frantic from the start: walls bleeding, voices, chase scenes.

Mostly, it was walking. Just… walking.

The rules said not to stay in one place more than a few seconds, so I paced the downstairs circuit: hallway, living room, kitchen, back to hallway. Every door open so I didn’t fumble. Candle in hand, audio recorder clipped to my shirt, EMF meter in my pocket.

The house creaked and settled. My shoulders loosened a fraction. It was just a house, and I’d let a story get under my skin.

By 12:17, I was bored enough to start narrating for the camera.

“This is Daniel, approximately seventeen minutes into the Midnight Game. No anomalous readings so far. EMF baseline. No audible voices. No...”

I stopped.

From upstairs, something moved.

Not a creak. Not a random settling noise.

A step.

Deliberate.

Heel-to-toe, heel-to-toe, pacing right above me.

I swallowed.

“Could be Laura,” I muttered, even though I’d told her to stay put. “Or Mia.” Or old pipes, or mice, or…

The footsteps stopped directly over my head, at the top of the stairs.

The candle flame leaned toward the staircase as if something had exhaled down it.

My EMF meter squealed from my pocket.

My mouth went dry.

You can reason yourself out of fear until your senses disagree. Then the lizard-brain takes over.

I forced myself to keep moving, doing slow loops through the living room, eyes pointed at the floor so I wouldn’t accidentally catch a shadow that looked too tall.

From the corner of my eye, I saw movement in the doorway.

Bare feet. Small. A nightdress hem.

“Mia?” I said automatically, looking up.

The doorway was empty.

The air where she should have been was colder.

Rule 8: Do NOT speak to, touch, or acknowledge any person you see in your house between 12 and 3:33 AM, unless you are absolutely sure they are real.

“Well, that’s broken,” I whispered. “Good start.”

Still no reason to believe anything paranormal was happening. Sleepwalking. Suggestion. My own tired brain misfiring.

I checked the time.

12:34.

The candle went out.

It didn’t flicker and die like a normal flame. It went from burning steadily to gone, like someone pinched it.

The darkness hit me like cold water. Something inside it moved, just behind my shoulder-blades, like a presence leaning in.

My hand shook as I grabbed for the matches.

The match wouldn’t strike.

Once.

Twice.

Three times, the head crumbled off, useless, onto the floor.

The air grew colder, pressure building in my ears like I was underwater.

Rule 6: If your candle goes out, immediately draw a circle of salt around yourself and stay inside it until 3:33 AM.

My fingers fumbled for the salt. Bag. Open. Pour.

I poured in a messy, shaking loop around myself, grains pattering like soft static on the wooden floor.

I finished the circle, and the pressure… stopped.

The dark was still total, my eyes blind and useless, but the sense of something closing in paused at the edge of the salt, like it had hit a wall.

My chest heaved.

“Okay,” I whispered into the recorder. My own voice sounded wrong in the dark, like it belonged to someone else. “We have… an anomalous event. Candle extinguished without apparent air movement. Difficulty striking matches… perceived drop in temperature. Possible panic response.”

I tried another match.

It lit on the first strike.

I relit the candle. The little pool of light showed my salt circle, clumsy but unbroken.

Outside it, right at the edge of the grains, something had left… marks. Each about the size of a finger, pressed into the fine layer of dust on the floorboards. Four parallel lines… then another four… then another. Like someone had dragged both hands around my circle, testing it.

I didn’t say anything. I just raised the EMF meter and watched it flutter between normal and what-the-fuck.

I wanted to call out to Laura. To say I was done, I was convinced, I was sorry for being smug.

But the rules said not to let anyone in. And I had the distinct, sinking feeling that if I opened my mouth and shouted, something else would answer.

I stepped carefully over the salt and forced myself back into motion.

Time lost meaning for a while.

I walked. I listened. I tried not to look at the corners, where the darkness felt… thicker. Like it was folding in on itself, almost-shapes pulsing in and out of existence.

Once, as I passed the hallway mirror, I saw a tall, thin shape behind me, where my reflection should have been. No face. Just the impression of height and limbs too long, bent slightly to fit.

I didn’t look up. I kept my eyes on the floor. That was the only reason I didn’t break Rule 7.

At some point, my phone buzzed in my pocket. A text from an unknown number.

12:59 AM: you’re doing so well, Daniel.

I swallowed bile.

No one outside this house should know what I was doing. Even if the number was spoofed, why was there no contact name, no code, no country prefix?

Another text.

don’t stop moving. i like you better this way.

I turned airplane mode on and put the phone face-down on the console table.

The footsteps started again upstairs.

Heel-to-toe. Heel-to-toe.

Pacing. Waiting.

The first time he spoke to me, it wasn’t a voice. Not really.

I was passing the closed door to the under-stairs cupboard when, for a second, the wood vanished and I saw...

Not with my eyes. With something deeper.

A staircase going down instead of up. Steps worn thin at the center. Walls too narrow, too close, pulsing slightly like a throat. At the bottom, in the dark, something tall and pale and hungry waited, his outline blurred, like he only existed when you weren’t quite looking at him.

My hand jerked away from the door.

Worst fear, I thought. That’s what the rules promised he’d show you if you broke them. Your worst fear.

I’d always thought my worst fear was something basic. Spiders. Dying alone. That sort of thing.

I was wrong.

My worst fear was being wrong. That all the things I’d laughed at were real. That I’d been walking naked through a world full of teeth, and tonight was the first time something had decided to bite down.

The vision snapped shut. Wood was solid under my palm again. The candle sputtered, then steadied.

“Fuck you,” I whispered at the door. “I’m still here.”

The air around me pulsed with a low, soundless amusement.

At 2:12 AM, the crying started.

Mia’s voice. High and cracked and terrified.

“Dan? Dan, please, are you there? I can’t move. He’s in my room. Dan, PLEASE,”

My heart punched the base of my throat.

“Mia?” I called before I could stop myself, turning toward the stairs.

The instant her name left my mouth, the crying cut off.

Not faded. Not muffled.

Cut. Like someone hit mute.

Something ran down the stairs then. Fast. On all fours. The sound of hands and feet slapping wood. It stopped just out of the candle’s reach.

I didn’t look up. Every instinct screamed at me to tilt my head, to see what was right there in the dark, breathing too fast.

I stared at my feet and recited the rules in my head like a mantra.

Don’t look. Don’t speak. Don’t touch. Don’t leave. Keep moving.

The breathing hitched. Then a whisper, right next to my ear, where no one tall enough should have been.

“good boy.”

I nearly dropped the candle.

By 2:47 AM, my legs shook from constant movement. My lower back ached. Every loop of the house felt longer than the last, the hallway stretching, the kitchen narrowing, the living room turning into a tunnel.

I checked my phone again.

No signal.

Time: 2:47 AM.

Forty-six minutes.

“I can do forty-six minutes,” I muttered.

The house disagreed.

The next time I passed the front door, there were scratches on it.

Four long, vertical gouges, just deep enough to tear the paint. Fresh. No splintering. As if something with patience had dragged its nails slowly down, enjoying the resistance.

My own handwriting stared back at me from the paper on the mat.

DANIEL MATTHEW COLE.

The blood drop was dry.

A second drop had appeared next to it.

I hadn’t given that one.

I kept walking.

We think of rules stories as horror because of what happens when you break them. Midnight Man taught me the horror comes from the moment you realise you don’t actually know whether you’ve broken them or not.

Did I speak to someone who wasn’t real when I answered Mia’s fake crying?

Did I “acknowledge” him by reading those texts?

Did the salt circle count if some grains scattered when I stepped over it?

Did looking at his reflection count as looking at him?

The rules were clear… until they weren’t.

Until every breath felt like a potential violation.

By 3:20, my brain was sliding on itself.

I counted loops. I counted heartbeats. I counted rule numbers under my breath, checking and re-checking them like rosary beads.

On the thirty-somethingth loop past the staircase, someone was standing on the third step up.

Bare feet. Long legs. Hands hanging a fraction too low. Torso disappearing into the dark.

My eyes flicked up instinctively, stopping at the knees.

I didn’t go any higher.

The candle flame bent toward him like a flower toward the sun.

The EMF meter in my pocket went dead.

He didn’t move. He didn’t speak. He just… waited.

I kept walking. Past him. Past the living room. Past the kitchen. Past every primal instinct that screamed at me to run, to hide, to throw myself out one of the windows and crawl bleeding into the street.

I don’t actually remember the last thirteen minutes.

Shock does that. Your brain gives up on saving everything and just grabs snapshots.

My next clear memory is standing in the middle of the living room, candle in hand, staring at my phone as it turned to 3:32.

The house was vibrating. Not literally. But the air felt charged, like static before a lightning strike. Every corner throbbed with the sense of something pressing up against thin, invisible walls.

Thirty seconds.

Somewhere behind me, boards creaked under a slow, deliberate step.

Twenty.

Breathing. Close enough to fog the back of my neck.

Ten.

A hand, not cold, not hot, just wrong, hovered a centimetre above the top of my head, not touching, but close enough that every hair on my body rose.

Five.

Four.

Three.

Everything stopped.

At 3:33 AM exactly, the pressure dropped.

The candle burned normal yellow again. The boards stopped talking. The EMF meter crackled weakly back to life.

I checked the front door.

The extra drop of blood was gone.

So were the scratches.

The under-stairs door was just wood.

The texts on my phone had vanished.

No unknown number. No log. No screenshots.

The only proof anything had happened was the salt on the floor and the audio file still recording on my collar.

I let myself fall onto the sofa, legs jelly, heart pounding in my ears.

I lived.

I “won.”

The rules said nothing else would happen.

They lied.

Laura found me half-asleep on the sofa at 4:10 AM. She looked… better. Less grey. Less hollow.

“Did it… work?” she asked softly.

I forced a smile. “Nothing your boiler man and a good therapist can’t fix.”

Upstairs, Mia slept for the first time in days. Proper sleep. No lights on.

The frostbite fingers on her neck had faded to faint pink marks by morning.

My report was short and neatly phrased, just like always.

Client’s symptoms consistent with acute stress reaction. Ritual effects explained as a combination of sleep deprivation, expectation, and environmental factors.

I wanted to believe it.

For three nights after that, I convinced myself I did.

Then the knocking started.

It came at 12:00 AM on the dot.

Not at my front door.

On my bedroom wall, right above the headboard.

Twenty-two knocks.

Slow. Measured. Perfectly spaced.

The last one landed exactly as my phone flicked from 11:59 to 12:00.

I lay there, every muscle rigid, counting them in my head.

Twenty.

Twenty-one.

Twenty-two.

The air chilled.

I hadn’t written my name. I hadn’t bled. I hadn’t lit a candle. I hadn’t invited him in.

It didn’t matter.

The rules, you see, were incomplete.

They only tell you how to start the game.

They don’t tell you what happens after you “win.”

He doesn’t stay if you lose. Mia was wrong about that.

He stays if you survive.

You’re his now. A long-term project. A favourite toy.

He doesn’t need paper and blood anymore. He knows exactly who you are.

Every night since then, I feel him.

Not always with knocks. Sometimes it’s a text from a number that doesn’t exist. Sometimes it’s a shadow in the mirror that lags half a second behind me. Sometimes it’s that tiny, almost-imperceptible drop in the room, like a lift shuddering at the bottom.

Sometimes it’s nothing, just weeks of silence, until I start to think, Maybe it really was just stress. Maybe it’s gone. Maybe...

Then he does something small.

Moves my keys.

Leaves my bedroom door half-open when I know I shut it.

Whispers my name from inside the wardrobe when I’m in the shower.

He’s patient. That’s the worst part. He’s not a jump scare. He’s a slow leak in your sanity, drip by drip, over years.

I still debunk other people’s ghosts. I still go on podcasts and talk about EMF spikes and sleep paralysis and why orbs are dust.

I still send neat little reports telling people their monsters aren’t real.

I’m not lying.

Their monsters aren’t.

Mine is.

So here’s my advice, from one sceptic to another.

Don’t play the Midnight Game.

Don’t write your name. Don’t bleed. Don’t knock. Don’t open the door.

But if you’re stubborn like I was, if someone dares you, if you need to know...

Then at least follow my version of the rules. The ones the file didn’t include.

Rule 11: If you “win,” move. New house. New locks. New number. It won’t help for long, but it might buy you time.

Rule 12: Never assume the game is over just because it’s 3:33 AM. That’s just when he stops pretending there are rules.

Rule 13: If you start seeing him in reflections, don’t smash the mirror. He likes when you panic. Just… stop looking. At anything that can hold his shape.

Rule 14: Don’t tell people you’ve seen him. Not in detail. Not exactly. The more specific you are, the more his shape spreads in their heads. He likes new rooms to walk in.

Rule 15: Above all, do not fall in love with being right. That’s how he gets people like us. He doesn’t come for the believers. He comes for the ones who laugh… and then knock anyway.

I used to be a paranormal debunker.

I still am, technically.

But when it’s just me, in the dark, at 11:59 PM, phone face-down and house too quiet, I don’t pretend anymore.

I don’t tell myself it was all stress. Or social media. Or mould.

I just listen to the silence and wait for the first knock.

Some nights, it doesn’t come.

Those are the worst ones.

When I was 17, she went behind my back to my then best friend's house, had coffee with her and her grandmother and talked to them about how strange I was acting and desperately proclaiming that ""she doesn't even know what to do about me anymore"". At that time, I had a solid friend group for the first time in my life, we went out, hung out together a lot etc. I was finally feeling some semblance of happy. I was doing well at school and there were absolutely no issues. The only reason I found out about this is because my then friend told me. Mom never said a word. If she had a problem with me, she never even tried to talk to me about it, but went straight to gossiping behind my back. 

One time she ran into another friend of mine at the doctor's. Begged her to come visit us, yes US, not me, as if she was her friend too, saying that I'm all alone cooped up in the house all the time. There's a lot of context behind this but let's just say - I got violently sick in my 20s, I am now chronically ill and disabled, and instead of understanding it or helping me with it, I have been judged for a decade for it. In her mind I'm just crazy for staying home all the time - in reality I am sick and don't have the energy anymore. Again, only found out because my friend told me about it.

And most recently, now that I am 30, I finally left that abusive household and have been living with my boyfriend for 7 months. A few days before my birthday, she went to my best friend's house, thinking I was staying with him and his family. She then broke down in tears in front of him and his father, demanding to know where I was, saying that she's been on sedatives because of me. My best friend wouldn't tell her where I was but told her I was staying with my boyfriend whom I never told her about (for good reason). She went inside and had coffee with his family, too. And now she's sending me messages, I accidentally opened her chat today, saying shit like ""when can I see you, you can't be staying at Joe's for this long"" (Joe = best friend), pretending like she figured me out all on her own, and like she's not sending my friend messages all the time asking about me. She also keeps telling me ""we would like to meet your boyfriend "" and now she even wrote ""it's normal at your age"" as if 30 is finally old enough for me to be allowed to have a partner (and I had to run away from my entire family to even be able to live like an adult, they were treating me like a child this entire time).

Please tell me someone else out there understands this bizarre behavior because right now I am feeling extremely violated and like my privacy doesn't even exist. I can't keep up with her lies anymore. ",3,1763508712.0,narcissisticparents,0,1.0,False

1p0rjxm,https://i.redd.it/343ygki4o32g1.jpeg,A 1-year update for our dog with barely-controlled epilepsy,"I don't need advice, more looking for folks who ""get it"" and offer a perspective I needed early in this diagnostic journey.

TL, DR: my dog is still happy despite a total of 63 seizures in 12 months, and the people are somehow mostly adjusted, though still occasionally stressed. 

---
I made the ""mistake"" of counting how many seizures my dog Sadie has had in the past 12 months. It got me reflecting on the last year since her diagnosis. 

To date, she has had 57 grand mal seizures and 6 focial seizures. They typically come every 2 weeks -2 or 3 in a weekend - though there was a period when she would not take any meds in any way in the morning and so we had seizures every couple days for about 3 weeks. And there were times we had to reduce her Phenobarbital by 1/4 a pill and the withdrawal seizurs were brutual. In general though, her seizures used to be 4+ minutes long and, with meds, are down to 90ish seconds or less.

Despite all of those seizures - she's happy. She plays with her dog sibling, loves her food now that we aren't hiding meds in it, loves getting pup cups from the coffee stand. She can't do dog parks anymore and she's loud in the car, but she loves going for walks and being with her people and her dog sibling. I won't say she's thriving, but she is enjoying life to large extent.

As for the people - we're pretty well adjusted. We bought security cameras to watch her inside and out, we have clean up stations by where she sleeps most often (her seizures happen almost exclusively while she's sleeping, mostly between 10pm and 5am). We bought giant, reusable pee pads to cover the floors so her incontinence issues are easy to clean up.I can even sleep through most nights, though I still have an automatic check reaction to any sounds that sound like her having a seizure. Truly relaxing while I'm awake remains a struggle, however, but maybe that's just me regardless.

I still miss ""the old Sadie"", and I struggle with the medication costs (she's 100lbs on 3 types of anti-siezure meds not including the back up meds). I will probably never again get a ""stubborn"" dog because trying to medicate a stubborn, suspicious dog who had seizures with missed doses nearly broke me. Repeatedly. 

I'm learning caregivers need breaks too - I had 3 nights sleeping in a hotel without my dogs and so much of my patience came vack (Sadie was well cared for while I was gone). Granted, I have other major life stressors happening this year at the same time, so the burnout wasn't all due to her epilepsy. But caregiver burnout is real, and time away - even an hour a day - can help so much. 

I guess, when it's all said and done, epilepsy sucks and I hate that my dog has it. But we're still doing much better than I thought we would be if someone had said, ""your dog is going to have 60+ siezures this year"". 

And, importantly, Sadie is still a happy dog enjoying her life.

You know the type: the asshole in the comments saying “Actually, that’s just pareidolia and bad audio compression.”

That was me. For eight years, I made a living taking people’s monsters apart and showing them the loose screws. I’d go into “haunted” houses, review grainy CCTV, rewatch “demonic” social media posts frame-by-frame and send back a neat little report:

It’s the wind. It’s mould. It’s your neighbour’s Wi-Fi camera. It’s grief.

They paid me to tell them it wasn’t real.

And I was always right.

Until I learned about the Midnight Man.

I didn’t find him on some cursed forum or ancient book. He found me in a client email that, at first, looked like all the rest.

Subject: URGENT – Please Prove This Is Fake.

Hi Daniel,

My daughter played a game she found on TikTok. The Midnight Game. Now she won’t sleep, won’t eat, and says ‘he’ is in the house. Can you please help convince her it’s not real? I’ll pay whatever you charge for an emergency visit.

There was an attachment:

RULES FOR THE MIDNIGHT GAME.docx

I almost deleted it.

Games like that are all the same: candles, salt, mirrors, “you must do this or else.” Urban legends repackaged for bored teenagers.

But then I read the rules.

Rule 1: Write your full name on a piece of paper. Add one drop of your blood. Place it in front of your front door.

Rule 2: Exactly at 12:00 AM, knock on your own door 22 times. The final knock must land whilst the clock is still 12:00

Rule 3: Open the door, then blow out your candle and close the door again. You have just invited the Midnight Man inside.

Rule 4: Relight your candle immediately.

Rule 5: From 12:01 AM until 3:33 AM, you must keep moving. Do not stay in one place for more than a few seconds.

Rule 6: If your candle goes out, immediately draw a circle of salt around yourself and stay inside it until 3:33 AM.

Rule 7: Do NOT look directly at him. If you do, he will show you your worst fear. Most people do not survive that.

Rule 8: Do NOT speak to, touch, or acknowledge any person you see in your house between 12 and 3:33 AM, unless you are absolutely sure they are real.

Rule 9: Do NOT leave the house during the game.

Rule 10: The game ends at 3:33 AM. If you are alive and in one piece, you “win.” Nothing will happen… for a while.

At the end, a line in bold:

If you fail to follow these rules, the Midnight Man will claim you.

I scoffed. The whole thing read like a fanfic version of every other “summoning game” out there.

I emailed the mother back, set a time, and drove out the next night, halfway across the county to a tidy semi-detached in a normal estate. The kind of place where the worst thing that should ever happen is a wheelie bin going missing.

Her name was Laura. She looked like she hadn’t slept in days.

“Thank you for coming,” she said, ushering me inside. “I know it’s stupid. I know it’s just… kids scaring themselves, but she’s not eating. She won’t go upstairs alone. She screams if the lights go off. I just, I need someone with… science.” She gestured vaguely at my bag. “With gear. To show her it’s fake.”

Kids were often my worst cases. Adults want their fears fixed. Teenagers want their fears believed. I’d learned that the hard way.

“Where is she now?” I asked.

“In her room. Won’t come out.” She paused. “She said he sits outside her door now. Every night, waiting. I tried telling her if he was real, we’d all see him, but she just cried harder.”

I heard it then, a soft, rhythmic tapping from upstairs.

Tap.

Tap.

Tap.

“Is that her?” I asked.

Laura swallowed. “She says it’s his fingers.”

I told myself it was a loose pipe.

The girl, Mia, was fourteen, grey-faced and hollow-eyed, sitting on her bed in yesterday’s clothes. Her curtains were taped shut. Her bedside lamp was on, plus a battery lantern and a string of fairy lights. No shadows left if she could help it.

“I’m not crazy,” she said before I even introduced myself. “Mum says you’re going to tell me it’s all in my head, but it’s not. It’s in the house.”

“I’m not here to say you’re crazy,” I said, pulling out my standard kit: EMF meter, thermal camera, audio recorder. Props, mostly. They made people feel like I was doing something real. “I’m here to see what happened and explain it. That’s all. Start from the beginning.”

She took a breath that shuddered all the way through her.

“We saw it on social media. Me and Becca. ‘The Midnight Game Challenge.’ You have to play it alone, but you can, like, be on call with someone else playing. So we did. We followed the steps. Wrote our names. Blood. Candle. Knocked 22 times. Let him in.” Her eyes flicked to the bedroom door as she said it. “It was a joke. We were laughing at the comments.”

“How long ago?” I asked.

“Four nights.” She dug at her thumb with a chewed nail. “It was fine at first. Dark, creepy, whatever. I heard stuff, but I thought it was my brain. You know? TikTok sound effects, neighbours. But then my candle went out.”

She gripped the duvet. Her knuckles went white.

“I didn’t have salt. I forgot that part. So I used sugar. I thought it was the same. He… didn’t.” Her eyes went glassy, unfocused. “The air went cold. Not like ‘I’m scared’ cold. Like freezer-burn cold. Something moved behind me and I knew, I just knew, if I turned around I’d see...” She cut herself off, breathing fast. “He didn’t show me monsters. He showed me things that haven’t happened yet. Things that haven’t happened and can’t happen and will happen and...”

I held up a hand. “Okay. It’s okay. We don’t have to go into that. Can I ask,did anything physical happen? Scratches, nosebleeds, objects moved?”

She lifted her hair without a word.

On the back of her neck, at the base of her skull, the skin looked… wrong. Not like a cut. Like frostbite in the shape of fingertips. Four on one side, thumb on the other. As if something cold had cupped the back of her head and squeezed.

I’ve seen kids dig their nails into their own skin. I’ve seen self-harm, psychosomatic rashes, hysterical bruising.

This wasn’t that.

I took a picture, pretending it didn’t rattle me.

“I hear him every night,” she whispered. “He didn’t leave at 3:33. That’s a lie. He stays if you lose. He just makes you wish he’d kill you quick instead.”

Something thumped softly outside the door.

Tap.

Tap.

Tap.

Her eyes went wide. She grabbed my wrist.

“Don’t open it,” she hissed. “He doesn’t like being checked on.”

I cleared my throat, forced my hand away, and opened the door.

The landing was empty.

But the EMF meter, which had been flat, spiked so hard it squealed.

I could have walked away. I should have. I could have told Laura: It’s stress. It’s TikTok. It’s mass suggestion. Send them both to therapy, file my report, take the money.

But I’d seen that frostbite handprint. I’d seen the EMF spike in a dead-quiet house with modern wiring.

And I’d heard the way Mia said “He stays.”

I made a mistake then.

I let my pride answer.

“Alright,” I told Laura in the kitchen. The house lights felt too bright somehow, like they were trying too hard. “I’ll prove it’s fake. Not just to her,to you, to me, to him if he’s listening. I’ll play it. Here. Tonight. Properly. Every rule, every step, documented.”

Laura paled. “You don’t have to do that. I just wanted...”

“You wanted proof,” I said. “If I play exactly the way the instructions say and nothing happens, you can show Mia the footage. Sometimes that’s what it takes.”

That’s the thing about debunkers. Deep down, we’re daredevils with a lab coat on. We poke the bear because we’re so sure it’s just a guy in a costume.

Her hands trembled as she made me coffee. “If… if you’re sure.”

I wasn’t. Not really. But I was curious, and curiosity is just fear that thinks it’s clever.

We started at 11:30 PM.

I set my equipment up in the hallway: tripod camera facing the front door, secondary camera on a bookshelf covering the hall and stairs, audio recorder on the console table. I took baseline readings: EMF low, ambient temperature a little chilly but normal for an old British house in October.

Mia stayed in her room. She refused to come downstairs. I didn’t blame her.

Laura hovered in the living room, clutching her dressing gown like a shield.

The rules said I had to play alone. So at 11:55, I asked Laura to go upstairs and close her door.

“If you hear anything,” she started.

“I’ll shout,” I said. “Or I’ll be embarrassed tomorrow when I show you how boring this was.”

She didn’t smile.

At 11:58, I sat on the floor in front of the door, knees creaking, and prepared.

I wrote my full name on the paper in block capitals.

Daniel Matthew Cole.

I pricked my finger with a sterilised lancet from my kit (ghost-hunting gear overlaps a lot with diabetes gear, it turns out). One drop of blood, dark and heavy, hit the paper and spread.

I placed it on the doormat.

My candle was a plain white pillar, the sort you buy for power cuts. I lit it and turned off every other light in the house.

Instantly, the world shrank to the small, flickering circle around me.

The camera’s red recording light winked back from the darkness.

I checked my phone. 11:59:37.

My heart was beating faster than I liked.

“It’s a ritual,” I muttered to myself. “Rituals feel powerful because they’re structured. That’s all.”

The minutes ticked.

When my lock screen changed to 12:00:00, I started knocking.

Rule 2: Exactly at 11:59 AM, knock on your own door 22 times. The final knock must land at 12:00:00.

“What precisely counts as ‘land’?” I’d scoffed earlier, reading it. “Do they know how milliseconds work?”

It’s funny what your brain latches onto when you’re scared. Stupid details.

I counted the knocks under my breath. One, two… nine… fifteen… twenty…

The candle flame fluttered with every impact, smearing shadows across the hallway walls.

“Twenty-one,” I whispered.

I held my breath. There was something obscene about hitting your own front door from the inside, like trying to get out of your own life.

“Twenty-two.”

My knuckles connected with wood and the moment they did, the entire house seemed to… drop. Like a lift juddering at the bottom of a shaft.

My phone ticked over to 12:00:00.

Rule 3: Open the door, then blow out your candle and close the door again. You have just invited the Midnight Man inside.

I unlocked the door, opened it a crack. The night outside was misty and still. No wind, no foxes, no passing cars. The street looked wrong in candlelight, all hard edges and over-saturated shadows.

I blew the candle out.

The dark that rushed in felt thick. Not just absence-of-light dark. Presence dark. Heavy. Watching.

I closed the door. Locked it. Heart hammering.

My hands shook just enough that it took me two tries to relight the candle.

Rule 4: Relight your candle immediately.

I managed it...

Well done, I thought. You have successfully set the mood for yourself, idiot.

I checked the time again. 12:01.

Three hours and thirty-two minutes to go.

People imagine these games as frantic from the start: walls bleeding, voices, chase scenes.

Mostly, it was walking. Just… walking.

The rules said not to stay in one place more than a few seconds, so I paced the downstairs circuit: hallway, living room, kitchen, back to hallway. Every door open so I didn’t fumble. Candle in hand, audio recorder clipped to my shirt, EMF meter in my pocket.

The house creaked and settled. My shoulders loosened a fraction. It was just a house, and I’d let a story get under my skin.

By 12:17, I was bored enough to start narrating for the camera.

“This is Daniel, approximately seventeen minutes into the Midnight Game. No anomalous readings so far. EMF baseline. No audible voices. No...”

I stopped.

From upstairs, something moved.

Not a creak. Not a random settling noise.

A step.

Deliberate.

Heel-to-toe, heel-to-toe, pacing right above me.

I swallowed.

“Could be Laura,” I muttered, even though I’d told her to stay put. “Or Mia.” Or old pipes, or mice, or…

The footsteps stopped directly over my head, at the top of the stairs.

The candle flame leaned toward the staircase as if something had exhaled down it.

My EMF meter squealed from my pocket.

My mouth went dry.

You can reason yourself out of fear until your senses disagree. Then the lizard-brain takes over.

I forced myself to keep moving, doing slow loops through the living room, eyes pointed at the floor so I wouldn’t accidentally catch a shadow that looked too tall.

From the corner of my eye, I saw movement in the doorway.

Bare feet. Small. A nightdress hem.

“Mia?” I said automatically, looking up.

The doorway was empty.

The air where she should have been was colder.

Rule 8: Do NOT speak to, touch, or acknowledge any person you see in your house between 12 and 3:33 AM, unless you are absolutely sure they are real.

“Well, that’s broken,” I whispered. “Good start.”

Still no reason to believe anything paranormal was happening. Sleepwalking. Suggestion. My own tired brain misfiring.

I checked the time.

12:34.

The candle went out.

It didn’t flicker and die like a normal flame. It went from burning steadily to gone, like someone pinched it.

The darkness hit me like cold water. Something inside it moved, just behind my shoulder-blades, like a presence leaning in.

My hand shook as I grabbed for the matches.

The match wouldn’t strike.

Once.

Twice.

Three times, the head crumbled off, useless, onto the floor.

The air grew colder, pressure building in my ears like I was underwater.

Rule 6: If your candle goes out, immediately draw a circle of salt around yourself and stay inside it until 3:33 AM.

My fingers fumbled for the salt. Bag. Open. Pour.

I poured in a messy, shaking loop around myself, grains pattering like soft static on the wooden floor.

I finished the circle, and the pressure… stopped.

The dark was still total, my eyes blind and useless, but the sense of something closing in paused at the edge of the salt, like it had hit a wall.

My chest heaved.

“Okay,” I whispered into the recorder. My own voice sounded wrong in the dark, like it belonged to someone else. “We have… an anomalous event. Candle extinguished without apparent air movement. Difficulty striking matches… perceived drop in temperature. Possible panic response.”

I tried another match.

It lit on the first strike.

I relit the candle. The little pool of light showed my salt circle, clumsy but unbroken.

Outside it, right at the edge of the grains, something had left… marks. Each about the size of a finger, pressed into the fine layer of dust on the floorboards. Four parallel lines… then another four… then another. Like someone had dragged both hands around my circle, testing it.

I didn’t say anything. I just raised the EMF meter and watched it flutter between normal and what-the-fuck.

I wanted to call out to Laura. To say I was done, I was convinced, I was sorry for being smug.

But the rules said not to let anyone in. And I had the distinct, sinking feeling that if I opened my mouth and shouted, something else would answer.

I stepped carefully over the salt and forced myself back into motion.

Time lost meaning for a while.

I walked. I listened. I tried not to look at the corners, where the darkness felt… thicker. Like it was folding in on itself, almost-shapes pulsing in and out of existence.

Once, as I passed the hallway mirror, I saw a tall, thin shape behind me, where my reflection should have been. No face. Just the impression of height and limbs too long, bent slightly to fit.

I didn’t look up. I kept my eyes on the floor. That was the only reason I didn’t break Rule 7.

At some point, my phone buzzed in my pocket. A text from an unknown number.

12:59 AM: you’re doing so well, Daniel.

I swallowed bile.

No one outside this house should know what I was doing. Even if the number was spoofed, why was there no contact name, no code, no country prefix?

Another text.

don’t stop moving. i like you better this way.

I turned airplane mode on and put the phone face-down on the console table.

The footsteps started again upstairs.

Heel-to-toe. Heel-to-toe.

Pacing. Waiting.

The first time he spoke to me, it wasn’t a voice. Not really.

I was passing the closed door to the under-stairs cupboard when, for a second, the wood vanished and I saw...

Not with my eyes. With something deeper.

A staircase going down instead of up. Steps worn thin at the center. Walls too narrow, too close, pulsing slightly like a throat. At the bottom, in the dark, something tall and pale and hungry waited, his outline blurred, like he only existed when you weren’t quite looking at him.

My hand jerked away from the door.

Worst fear, I thought. That’s what the rules promised he’d show you if you broke them. Your worst fear.

I’d always thought my worst fear was something basic. Spiders. Dying alone. That sort of thing.

I was wrong.

My worst fear was being wrong. That all the things I’d laughed at were real. That I’d been walking naked through a world full of teeth, and tonight was the first time something had decided to bite down.

The vision snapped shut. Wood was solid under my palm again. The candle sputtered, then steadied.

“Fuck you,” I whispered at the door. “I’m still here.”

The air around me pulsed with a low, soundless amusement.

At 2:12 AM, the crying started.

Mia’s voice. High and cracked and terrified.

“Dan? Dan, please, are you there? I can’t move. He’s in my room. Dan, PLEASE,”

My heart punched the base of my throat.

“Mia?” I called before I could stop myself, turning toward the stairs.

The instant her name left my mouth, the crying cut off.

Not faded. Not muffled.

Cut. Like someone hit mute.

Something ran down the stairs then. Fast. On all fours. The sound of hands and feet slapping wood. It stopped just out of the candle’s reach.

I didn’t look up. Every instinct screamed at me to tilt my head, to see what was right there in the dark, breathing too fast.

I stared at my feet and recited the rules in my head like a mantra.

Don’t look. Don’t speak. Don’t touch. Don’t leave. Keep moving.

The breathing hitched. Then a whisper, right next to my ear, where no one tall enough should have been.

“good boy.”

I nearly dropped the candle.

By 2:47 AM, my legs shook from constant movement. My lower back ached. Every loop of the house felt longer than the last, the hallway stretching, the kitchen narrowing, the living room turning into a tunnel.

I checked my phone again.

No signal.

Time: 2:47 AM.

Forty-six minutes.

“I can do forty-six minutes,” I muttered.

The house disagreed.

The next time I passed the front door, there were scratches on it.

Four long, vertical gouges, just deep enough to tear the paint. Fresh. No splintering. As if something with patience had dragged its nails slowly down, enjoying the resistance.

My own handwriting stared back at me from the paper on the mat.

DANIEL MATTHEW COLE.

The blood drop was dry.

A second drop had appeared next to it.

I hadn’t given that one.

I kept walking.

We think of rules stories as horror because of what happens when you break them. Midnight Man taught me the horror comes from the moment you realise you don’t actually know whether you’ve broken them or not.

Did I speak to someone who wasn’t real when I answered Mia’s fake crying?

Did I “acknowledge” him by reading those texts?

Did the salt circle count if some grains scattered when I stepped over it?

Did looking at his reflection count as looking at him?

The rules were clear… until they weren’t.

Until every breath felt like a potential violation.

By 3:20, my brain was sliding on itself.

I counted loops. I counted heartbeats. I counted rule numbers under my breath, checking and re-checking them like rosary beads.

On the thirty-somethingth loop past the staircase, someone was standing on the third step up.

Bare feet. Long legs. Hands hanging a fraction too low. Torso disappearing into the dark.

My eyes flicked up instinctively, stopping at the knees.

I didn’t go any higher.

The candle flame bent toward him like a flower toward the sun.

The EMF meter in my pocket went dead.

He didn’t move. He didn’t speak. He just… waited.

I kept walking. Past him. Past the living room. Past the kitchen. Past every primal instinct that screamed at me to run, to hide, to throw myself out one of the windows and crawl bleeding into the street.

I don’t actually remember the last thirteen minutes.

Shock does that. Your brain gives up on saving everything and just grabs snapshots.

My next clear memory is standing in the middle of the living room, candle in hand, staring at my phone as it turned to 3:32.

The house was vibrating. Not literally. But the air felt charged, like static before a lightning strike. Every corner throbbed with the sense of something pressing up against thin, invisible walls.

Thirty seconds.

Somewhere behind me, boards creaked under a slow, deliberate step.

Twenty.

Breathing. Close enough to fog the back of my neck.

Ten.

A hand, not cold, not hot, just wrong, hovered a centimetre above the top of my head, not touching, but close enough that every hair on my body rose.

Five.

Four.

Three.

Everything stopped.

At 3:33 AM exactly, the pressure dropped.

The candle burned normal yellow again. The boards stopped talking. The EMF meter crackled weakly back to life.

I checked the front door.

The extra drop of blood was gone.

So were the scratches.

The under-stairs door was just wood.

The texts on my phone had vanished.

No unknown number. No log. No screenshots.

The only proof anything had happened was the salt on the floor and the audio file still recording on my collar.

I let myself fall onto the sofa, legs jelly, heart pounding in my ears.

I lived.

I “won.”

The rules said nothing else would happen.

They lied.

Laura found me half-asleep on the sofa at 4:10 AM. She looked… better. Less grey. Less hollow.

“Did it… work?” she asked softly.

I forced a smile. “Nothing your boiler man and a good therapist can’t fix.”

Upstairs, Mia slept for the first time in days. Proper sleep. No lights on.

The frostbite fingers on her neck had faded to faint pink marks by morning.

My report was short and neatly phrased, just like always.

Client’s symptoms consistent with acute stress reaction. Ritual effects explained as a combination of sleep deprivation, expectation, and environmental factors.

I wanted to believe it.

For three nights after that, I convinced myself I did.

Then the knocking started.

It came at 12:00 AM on the dot.

Not at my front door.

On my bedroom wall, right above the headboard.

Twenty-two knocks.

Slow. Measured. Perfectly spaced.

The last one landed exactly as my phone flicked from 11:59 to 12:00.

I lay there, every muscle rigid, counting them in my head.

Twenty.

Twenty-one.

Twenty-two.

The air chilled.

I hadn’t written my name. I hadn’t bled. I hadn’t lit a candle. I hadn’t invited him in.

It didn’t matter.

The rules, you see, were incomplete.

They only tell you how to start the game.

They don’t tell you what happens after you “win.”

He doesn’t stay if you lose. Mia was wrong about that.

He stays if you survive.

You’re his now. A long-term project. A favourite toy.

He doesn’t need paper and blood anymore. He knows exactly who you are.

Every night since then, I feel him.

Not always with knocks. Sometimes it’s a text from a number that doesn’t exist. Sometimes it’s a shadow in the mirror that lags half a second behind me. Sometimes it’s that tiny, almost-imperceptible drop in the room, like a lift shuddering at the bottom.

Sometimes it’s nothing, just weeks of silence, until I start to think, Maybe it really was just stress. Maybe it’s gone. Maybe...

Then he does something small.

Moves my keys.

Leaves my bedroom door half-open when I know I shut it.

Whispers my name from inside the wardrobe when I’m in the shower.

He’s patient. That’s the worst part. He’s not a jump scare. He’s a slow leak in your sanity, drip by drip, over years.

I still debunk other people’s ghosts. I still go on podcasts and talk about EMF spikes and sleep paralysis and why orbs are dust.

I still send neat little reports telling people their monsters aren’t real.

I’m not lying.

Their monsters aren’t.

Mine is.

So here’s my advice, from one sceptic to another.

Don’t play the Midnight Game.

Don’t write your name. Don’t bleed. Don’t knock. Don’t open the door.

But if you’re stubborn like I was, if someone dares you, if you need to know...

Then at least follow my version of the rules. The ones the file didn’t include.

Rule 11: If you “win,” move. New house. New locks. New number. It won’t help for long, but it might buy you time.

Rule 12: Never assume the game is over just because it’s 3:33 AM. That’s just when he stops pretending there are rules.

Rule 13: If you start seeing him in reflections, don’t smash the mirror. He likes when you panic. Just… stop looking. At anything that can hold his shape.

Rule 14: Don’t tell people you’ve seen him. Not in detail. Not exactly. The more specific you are, the more his shape spreads in their heads. He likes new rooms to walk in.

Rule 15: Above all, do not fall in love with being right. That’s how he gets people like us. He doesn’t come for the believers. He comes for the ones who laugh… and then knock anyway.

I used to be a paranormal debunker.

I still am, technically.

But when it’s just me, in the dark, at 11:59 PM, phone face-down and house too quiet, I don’t pretend anymore.

I don’t tell myself it was all stress. Or social media. Or mould.

I just listen to the silence and wait for the first knock.

Some nights, it doesn’t come.

Those are the worst ones.

Since a child I always had issues with running late, waiting until the night before major assignments were due (sorry mom for those late night convenient store runs), and managing to stay on topic without being easily distracted. I always charged it to mom who was always the same exact way, and I developed her bad habits.

If it weren't for the fact that turned down a free coffee, I never would've knew. I went to check out at a gas station that offered free coffee on a promo they were running, and when I mentioned that Caffeine makes me crash immediately, the cashier's eyes widened like he was seen in a way that most other people wouldn't understand as he said:

""You have ADHD too???""

I said, ""No.. but tell me more"", and he began running off a bunch of other symptoms that described me so well, it left me in shock. I spoke with a psychiatrist who agreed, and began doing the work.

I'm at a place where I know it, I accept it, but I'm having issues trying to cope with it.

Full disclosure: I built this because I hated every other budgeting app, so this is literally designed around how my brain works. But figured I'd share in case it helps anyone else.

**1. log everything as it happens**

Grab coffee? Log it right there in line. Groceries? Log it in the parking lot. Takes like 20 seconds and then I forget about it.

**2.  buckets**

So there's needs/wants/savings buckets. When I burn through my needs money (rent, food, gas, bills) Ill just start taking from wants. It's not like a strict rule, it just happens. i try to keep my buckets balanced. if wants is getting crazy I’ll take from savings. it will all be reflected in the ytd tab so it’s more about keeping your buckets healthy.

**3. Rounding up to save time**

Here's something I do - I'll round UP when logging expenses if I don't feel like pulling out my phone to check the exact amount. Like if lunch was $12.47 I'll just log $13 or even $15. budgeting doesn’t have to be exact to be effective but you should round up (not down).

**4. what to put in earnings tab**

any money coming in goes into earnings. even Venmo from friends. When I pay for friends and they Venmo me back:

* Dinner for 4 people = $120 → I log the full $120 in daily expenses
* Friends Venmo me $90 total → I log that $90 in the earnings tab
* Now my budget shows I actually spent $30 but I can still see the real transaction

I do this for ANY money coming in. Friend pays me back for concert tickets? Earnings. Sold something on Marketplace? Earnings. Grandma birthday check? earnings.

**Why I built it this way**

I tried YNAB, tried Mint, always quit after like 5 days. Too complicated, too many categories, bank linking was annoying.

So I made Paperright to be just: money out = log it, money in = log it. That's it. No account linking, no complicated rules, just track what actually happens.

Anyway, that's my system. Open to feedback if anyone has ideas - still figuring this out as I go.",1,1763507888.0,paperright,0,1.0,False

1p0r8y3,https://v.redd.it/rwei95ztl32g1,What Are the Benefits of Question-a-Day?,"One Simple Daily Habit That Quietly Rewires Your Brain

In an age where AI can answer almost anything, your ability to ask the right question matters more than ever. As generative tools handle the “answer-giving,” human value increasingly lies in question-asking, interpretation, and insight-generation.

Which makes this finding from Harvard Business School especially relevant: structured daily reflection improves learning retention by 23% compared to experience alone. That’s the difference between having an experience and truly learning from it. This simple practice builds what psychologists call metacognition, the ability to observe and direct your own thinking. In a world overflowing with noise, the habit of Question-a-Day becomes a rare moment of clarity.

“Structured reflection doesn’t just help you process the past—it prepares you for the future.” — Giada Di Stefano, Harvard Business School

Why One Daily Question Works

Self-reflection activates multiple brain systems at once: memory, emotion, language, and logic. When you engage with a well-crafted question, whether about team dynamics, communication patterns, or personal assumptions, you’re not just thinking. You’re building neural infrastructure.

Daily questions help by:

Strengthening self-awareness through regular observation of internal patterns
Building cognitive flexibility by shifting perspectives across psychology, strategy, and communication
Reducing anxiety by processing emotions in manageable, daily doses
Reinforcing learning through retrieval practice, a proven technique for deepening understanding
Each question is like a quick workout for your brain, small enough to be effortless, powerful enough to compound over time.

Small Habit, Big Brain Shift

Neuroscience backs this up. Donald Hebb’s principle states: “Neurons that fire together wire together.” By returning to thoughtful reflection each day, you’re literally strengthening the neural pathways responsible for self-evaluation, pattern recognition, and emotional regulation.

What makes this habit work is its consistency:

Neuroplastic growth: Daily practice builds brain structure for better thinking
Pattern recognition: Recurring themes in your answers reveal blind spots, triggers, and core beliefs you didn’t know were there
Frictionless formation: It takes five minutes. You can answer during coffee, your commute, or before bed
As psychiatrist Dan Siegel puts it: “Where attention goes, neural firing flows and neural connection grows.”

When Theory Becomes Practice

Consider a product manager who began each morning with QuestionClass’s daily question. Over three months, she encountered questions like:

“What makes feedback land versus backfire?”
“Where are you overcomplicating things?”
“How do high-performing teams handle conflict differently?”
She started connecting dots. Her improved understanding of communication psychology reshaped how she framed strategy conversations. Her deeper self-awareness made her team feedback more precise. Within weeks, she reported clearer decision-making, better team dynamics, and fewer reactive moments.

This is cognitive cross-pollination in action, when insight in one domain unlocks breakthroughs across your whole life.

Your Mind’s Time-Lapse Archive

Over months and years, daily answers become something unexpected: a documentary of your evolving mind. Looking back reveals:

Perspective shifts: What felt critical six months ago now seems trivial—and vice versa
Contextual influences: How stress, relationships, or world events colored your thinking without you realizing it
Growth markers: Concrete evidence that your understanding deepened, your patterns shifted, your thinking expanded
Even more powerful: past answers become a sounding board. You can agree or disagree with earlier versions of yourself, opening new mental doors simply by seeing where you’ve already been.

Why It Matters Now

The psychological benefits compound over time:

Short-term: Daily clarity, emotional release, fresh perspective on current challenges
Medium-term: Pattern recognition, improved communication, calmer reactions under pressure
Long-term: Deep self-awareness, cognitive flexibility, and measurably stronger emotional intelligence
It’s a scalable, portable practice that fits any life and starts paying dividends immediately. As Harvard researcher Alison Wood Brooks notes: “Questions are how we come to like and know each other” including knowing ourselves.

1p0r7yb,https://www.reddit.com/r/creepcast/comments/1p0r7yb/splinter_part_1/,Splinter (Part 1),"“Happy birthday Sweetheart,” Ms. Tonya waved as I stepped out of her class with a feeling of lingering anxiety in my chest and a slow creep of excitement. All 5 of us had been planning this hangout since the start of senior year. My father was the manager of a reasonably popular haunted house attraction for our area and he also just so happened to be long time friends with the owner. So ever since eighth grade and when me and Gavin started working there three years ago it became our tradition to come out and rent a nearby cabin for two nights and mess around in the haunted house until late at night. It started at first as just me, Gavin and Lynn but over the years it transformed into me, Gavin, Lynn, Ethan, and Rob.

My name is Blake. I’m a terribly average guy compared to the others. I like writing, movies, and books, specifically horror and that's all there is to me, besides a diagnosis of social anxiety and depression. I used to wear a leather jacket like Negan from “The Walking Dead” thinking it made me look cool but in reality I seemed like a dork I’m sure. I’m not tall but I’m not short either, I’m not humorless but I’m not a class clown like Ethan, I’m not fat but I’m not skinny. The only thing that sticks out is my long wavy hair. That’s why I’ll say I’m terribly average.

Gavin was my best friend out of the group. Same average height as me with curly brown locks of hair draping down his back, he just clicked with me on every little nerdy thing we found. Just as awkward as me, he stumbled over his words a lot but still managed to crack me up every time he said a joke.

Ethan was a self proclaimed goofball. He was constantly throwing out a joke, good or bad, to anyone who would listen. 6 ’1, chubby but strong, constantly wearing basketball shorts, even in winter, and hoodies over his short, blonde hair, he could make any get together into a hysterical room of laughter or the biggest argument between 5 people you have ever seen. Not only did he like to joke but he liked to argue and most of the time start those very arguments, but he never meant any harm and we never actually got mad.

Then there was Lynn. Constantly draped in black attire she was the chillest out of our group, she was the type to constantly have an earphone in and would just tune in to the rest of our conversations to listen. On the chance that we brought up anything she adored though it was like a spark on gasoline, she could go on for hours and hours but I never protested. 

I walked down the school's winding hallways with fellow bus riders surrounding me on all sides. The gossip of white trash rednecks and painfully bland and dumb blonde girls swirled around me like a tornado. God did I hate school and the people there. I just stuck to my friend group all the time and ignored the drama even when I was in the eye of the storm. I just kept my head down and walked faster wanting to get the school day over and the festivities started. I finally raised my head to see the beautiful glass doors leading out and my excitement rose. I pushed the door open, holding it for a second for the guy behind me and feeling the rays from the grey sky shine on me. I looked to see Gavin, Lynn, and Ethan all in a circle in front of the bus talking. Suddenly I felt the mass of uneasiness cocoon and sprout into weird awkwardness even though we’ve spoken every day for six years. I had classes with Gav and Ethan but none with Lynn this year sadly, so we didn’t see each other much which prompted her to turn and say what she said next.

“Happy birthday dumbass!” she said with a cool attitude then chuckled and smiled.

At that moment the anxiety and awkwardness folded into itself and back into its cocoon as I smiled back.

“Haha shit for brains,” bursted out of my mouth before I could think. She hugged me laughing.

Gavin chuckled as well, moving closer. “Dude thank god they switched when report cards were coming out otherwise I would’ve been under house arrest.”

“What the hell man, failing grades is Blake's trademark not yours!” Ethan belted out.

“Oh fuck you tubby!” I laughed along.

He bumped my arm with his elbow playfully but hard enough for it to hurt which was right on brand for Ethan. We walked onto the bus, the unfamiliar red seats intriguing me as Lynn and I slid into a seat opposite to the other two. I had never ridden the bus to Rob’s before, usually he drove us there, but today we were. We would meet him there, meet up with Kirsten, drive to the haunt, mess around and then stay at the cabin once one am struck, at least that had been our ritual these past years minus Kirsten joining us.

Ethan leaned over as we passed through the tidy suburban streets. “Dude, so when are we gonna plan that DND campaign?” Truth be told I had forgotten about it entirely. As I thought about my response I felt the cushion behind me rise up.

“What the hell bro, planning a Dungeons and Dragons campaign without me?!” I knew then the first spark of the day had flown as I felt her hovering over my shoulder. Gavin awkwardly opened his phone to scroll as I enjoyed the banter. They spoke the entire twenty minutes about ideas of a campaign and even their made up characters. I butted in with a couple ideas but I didn’t know much about Dungeons and Dragons or Warhammer or any of the board games they swore they would play one day. By the time Ethan had flown the conversation through hoop after hoop of topics we arrived just in time to avoid a tirade about how Fallout is the best videogame franchise ever. We strolled up to Rob’s door feeling like Reservoir Dogs and knocked candidly.

He opened the door with a clumsy smile. “Howdy doody!”

His pleasantry fell so flat we bursted out in laughter.

“What’d I do…” he mumbled uncertainly, adding to the laughter.

We just waved our hands aside and walked in.

Rob was kinda awkward but a really kind and fun guy to be around. About 6 '2 and skinny with constantly messy hair, he always spoke in a monotone voice as if high constantly yet completely sober. His nerdy interests were even more niche than our weird ones but they were interesting and damn was our music taste identical. We spent hours on end freshman year listening to Arctic Monkeys and Black Sabbath in gym class.

As we walked in Ethan continued talking about Fallout and other rpg’s to Rob while me Gavin and Lynn talked over characters and character arcs in horror games and media. I waltzed into Rob's kitchen to make coffee for myself and Ethan as the minutes went by and he kept talking. The coffee brewed in the machine and dripped into the pot, I felt my chest tighten out of nowhere as my thoughts drifted into the recesses of my mind, places I didn't want to focus on. I closed my eyes and thought of fun times with the group but I think it made it worse. I filled the mugs then poured the milk and stirred the sugar in as I felt a tap on my shoulder.

“Whatcha doin?” Lynn questioned with a soft smile.

I snapped out of it, “O-oh just making coffee.”

“Let me have it.” I handed her my mug as she moved closer expecting her to drink but she just inhaled the steam. “Hmmmmm.”

“What are y-”

“I hate the taste of coffee, I just love the smell,” she said exhaling and handing the cup back to me. I took it back with shaky hands as she treaded over to the pantry. “Down to raid Rob's pantry?” I smiled and sat the mugs down with a clink.

About 3 minutes later Rob finally walked in to see us giggling like school girls while holding two donuts in each hand. “My donuts…” he whined like a wounded puppy.

In the moment of snickering that followed the door knocked almost so quietly that no one heard it.

“H-h-hello…” a timid girl's voice came through the door. 

“Oh Kirsten’s here.” Rob said in his constant monotone voice. He opened the door and there she was.

Kirsten was a petite girl, she seemed like the wind could blow her off her feet and through the air. She rubbed her barely visible hands together in the oversized hoodie she was wearing. Ethan and Gavin's argument in the background over which movie to watch that night seemed to make her jump like a cat just from the volume. I immediately recognized her, we had classes together back when I used to be just as uptight as she was now. I sympathized with her. I also knew by the ruby redness in her face and her gorgeous blue eyes staring at his feet that she liked Rob and Rob liked her. Those beautiful blue eyes could capture any man's heart in an instant I swear. I chuckled and wiped my glaze covered fingers with a napkin and sipped my coffee as Rob made introductions since she was joining the group for the first time. 

“Hi…” she murmured bashfully.

We all said our separate hellos and Ethan immediately started talking music with her. I’m glad, I think it loosened her up as her stiff figure relaxed. Although any time Rob got close she became a wooden board again.

After the shared greetings we packed our small backpacks with snacks and changes of clothes and piled into Rob’s massive jeep.

“Yo thanks again for being the communal driver,” I spoke to Rob from the back of the car.

“No prob man!” He said back a little louder than intended as we pulled out of his driveway and headed to the haunt.

The drive was about thirty minutes there. When Ethan leaped for the bluetooth connect button Kirsten jumped again for the hundredth time and Lynn chuckled. She jumped even more when he started his heavy metal playlist. Lynn and Kirsten tried talking to me but we couldn’t hear because of the dumbass with radio privileges. Those privileges were snatched and given to me after accidently hitting play in the Little Caesars drive-thru. Rob and Gavin finally seemed at peace in the car listening to British pop-rock with me like it was that freshman gym class again.

We drove up and down winding roads, past lodges and lakes, and over a rickety rust bucket of a bridge. Along the way Ethan cranked down the radio with a swift hand movement. “Has Kirsten heard the story?”

“What story…?” she asked innocently as we turned a corner, the trees blocking out most of the ash grey sky.

Me, Gavin and Lynn collectively groaned. “The stupid ass story of the haunt…” We said simultaneously.

“I-I still don’t get it,” Kirsten mumbled.

Ethan turned in his seat to face us gripping the back of the seat intently with a sly smile. “Okay, in the 1800’s there was a mansion on the property where the haunted house is today. The family that lived there was the rich dad, his wife, daughter, and a collection of maids he had amassed over the years. The maids started showing up missing with no evidence as to where they had vanished in the mansion that once stood. One by one the townsfolk noticed the dwindling number of servants. Rumors began of the man being a satanic cultist who was sacrificing the women to the devil. The head priest in town, an influential and charismatic man, led with the rumors and claimed that the rich man was committing unspeakable acts of pure refined evil and needed to be stopped. The town formed a mob and when they stormed the mansion they found the man in the cellar skinning the dismembered corpses of his wife and young daughter. The town stood in shock too scared to even lynch the man. He took his blade and slit his own throat, vowing alliance with Satan as he gushed blood onto his skinless kin. Those in the area believe he was trying to ascend to a higher form of being, a demon, and that his ritual to the devil finally worked when he sacrificed his family. Even today you can hear the abomination he has become in the depths of hell screaming and cackling in joy.”

Kirsten looked colorless like she had just watched a puppy die.

“If only any of that bullshit was real,” Lynn retorted with fiery sass. “Gavin and I have checked the libraries and even online and there is no evidence to show there was ever a rich devil man or some spooky mansion where maids were led to slaughter. It. Is. Bullshit.”

“God you're no fun!” Ethan pouted loudly.

Rob chuckled and made the last turn onto a long stretch of road, the grey beams of light engulfing the car again. Five minutes later the road led us there to the parking lot to the left of the haunt,

The grass parking lot was about seventy feet from the cabins to the right but about two hundred feet to the left was the haunted house and that was our first destination.

Me and Gav carried the pizzas over to the haunt as the others trekked in front of us with blankets and bags leading the way, still arguing whether the story was true or not. Coming from the parking lot we walked into the left side of the metallic building then walked around to the front with wooden planks nailed to the metal sheets to give it an “Evil Dead” impression. In front of it though was a field that if you walked straight away from the house led to a creek running through the woodland town. We decided to sit and eat there to unwind in the frigid autumn breeze before playing hide and seek.

As I sat the few pizza boxes I had ferried over on the blanket Kirsten had sat down I looked up. The group was laughing at dumb inside jokes, taking a slice, or straightening out the blankets in Rob's case. It was a joyous scene even Kirsten joined in on with her own innocent childlike laughter and jokes.

It hurt. It hurt a lot. We all planned on having different careers. Doctors, lawyers, mechanics, and even the horror author I hoped to become. We all were splintering off into our own tales. The cocoon of anxiety sprouted again in my chest and the mass of anxiety fluttered its wings and summersalted into my stomach. I’m so scared of losing them, losing this. I clutched the hem of my shirt. “Why now? On my birthday? C'mon dude don't think about it.” That phrase my brain had conjured up repeated until I felt the warm soft crust of the pizza in my grasp. “It's gonna be okay… right?”

We all sat down to eat. Gavin and I made double-decor pizzas out of two slices and laughed when the others began chanting “fatasses” until we finished three double decors. We leaned backwards, my hand falling on the grass. Ethan kicked my foot teasingly as I made mock bloated groaning noises. Lynn sat criss cross apple sauce beside me showing me posters of my favorite bands asking which one I wanted to stop and get tomorrow.

“You don’t have to get me anything man.”

“Duh I do, it's your freakin birthday, you deserve it.” She retorted with a snort at how dumb I sounded in her mind. “Plus I want to.”

“Dude I know you want that Arctic Monkeys poster.” Gavin said cockily.

“See, even Gav knows.” she smirked winning this court case.

“Fiiiiiine.”

“So what was your favorite song again?” Gav questioned knowing it would start a rant. That had lit my own spark to talk about my favorite bands and the cocoon closed up again. I chuckled as we talked over songs and how important they were to us. Black Sabbath, Nirvana, System of a Down, all of them getting us through break-ups or rebellious phases, or even just one bad night. I got up to grab another slice when I noticed my hand had left a deep black handprint on the blanket.

“What the hell?”

I ran my hand across the blanket and the handprint became a black streak through the snowy cloth. I looked at my palm and saw there was a dark, ashy grey substance coating it. Ash? Gavin looked at the grass and saw that patches of the field were stained with streaks of the ash or whatever it was.

“Has someone lit a fire recently?” Ethan quizzed.

I thought for a mere moment before answering. “No, people don’t touch the place after the last night open for the year.” I pointed over to the fire pit used to keep employees warm on icy nights and the silver tin keeping the fire at bay. “If they did and had a brain they would use that.”

Lynn cocked her head to the side thinking as Kirsten itched beside her eye. What kind of fire could leave trails of ash like this? That question flowed through our heads.

Gavin chimed in. “Could wind have been strong enough to blow ash out of the fire pit?”

“The tin would’ve caught it,” Lynn said with a calculated stare.

Rob took his turn. “Maybe a burning animal?”

“I've not heard of any fires recently…” Kirsten spoke.

“That's the most likely theory though. Maybe lightning set it ablaze,” Ethan snickered at the wild possibility..

“Whatever lets just get to hide and seek,” I smacked my hands together to dust them off and took another slice to eat as we approached. “Actually Kirsten probably needs to be shown around…” I said. I instantly saw Rob's eyes glisten with the thought of “Holy shit the time is now!”

He stepped forward, “I’ll help her through.”

I had to hide my devilish smirk and bite my tongue before I blurted out “Wonder why?” at his cheesy attempt. Lynn chuckled under her breath and Kirsten smiled lightly knowing exactly what I was thinking.

I led the group in front of Rob and Kirsten into the entrance. The first room had five lines in it. The walls, ceiling, and floor were made of either wood, plaster, or in the case of the outer walls of the place metal sheets. All the rooms on the inside were plaster. All the actors' tunnels were wood. Everything was roughly painted black with a decade worth of chipped paint and wear and tear, for that matter the whole place did in a charming antique way. The entry room had 3 doors. A hidden one to the front left of the entrance to enter one half of the employees only halls. One directly in front of the entrance permanently opened because of a wedge under the door, that was the way into the haunt after your group waited in the five short lines. To the left of the entrance was another hidden door leading into the second side of the employees only halls.

The power was out so I pulled six small dinky flashlights from my bag and passed them out. Ethan twirled his between his fingers, Lynn put an earphone in, and Kirsten clutched hers like a lifeline before using her other hand to pinch Rob's sleeve between her pointer and thumb adorably.

I led us through the winding corridors with my light as the others lit up little trinkets and props lining desks and shelves. We went through a kitchen with shiny rubber guts and limbs strewn about, a bathroom with a toilet spray painted brown and the lingering smell of fart spray, church pews with mannequins draped in white sheets (that one in particular always freaked me out), a tunnel with football field turf mangled into fake vines growing up the sides, a jail cell room that had a door with a tempered glass window that was on the bigger side of the room. That door led to a security room. And a boiler room with paper flames and too many little powerless heaters to count.

About half way through I heard Kirstens already shaky breathing become that much more uneasy. Ethan and Rob looked at her with concerned eyes. “It’s a bit claustrophobic huh,” she murmured.

Rob pointed upwards. “Well all of these rooms don't have a like… wood roof, just tarp under a metal roof farther up so it isn’t that cramped in reality.” It eased her a bit but not much. I assume the death grip her pinched fingers had on his jacket helped though.

We wound around hall to hall sometimes taking wrong turns into secret doorways not meant for customers to go through. Finally at the exit we took a turn through a hidden compartment to the employees only hallway. Walking through we saw make up rooms filled with masks and chairs, hidden compartments for actors to pop out at you from, and the two security rooms with cameras set up around the haunt. One of those security rooms on each side of the haunt. You see, the employees only hallways were split into two by the entrance room so each side had its own security room. The hallways made an L shape that were split in the middle by that room. It was a pain to go from one hall to the other when the place was open but it worked. We went through the same path another time to make sure that Kirsten memorized some of the layout, by that point the sun was setting and excitement was climbing.

We all gathered in the entrance room and decided on the seeker as darkness set on the field outside. Rules and parameters were set and where we could go was stated and then the game commenced. Ethan sat counting as Rob and Kirsten ran off together and Gavin, Lynn, and I parted ways. We ran through hidden spaces winding around the main path and long, chilling corridors. I found a rusty barrel to slip into in the boiler room as footsteps pitter pattered all around me. I could hear Lynn locking in and running to my right and Rob and Kirsten's combined giggles to my left. We were all together.

Games went by in flashes. Hiding in lockers, running through the halls with Gavin as Rob sprinted after us, hiding in an old cramped fridge that stained my pant leg, as many creative hiding spots as I could find. After five games like that we all circled again in the entrance. 

Kirsten started counting and Lynn grabbed my wrist, “c-mon!” She hauled me through the halls, nearly bumping me into every object jutting out in the whole place as we went. She dragged me to the eerie chapel room and we both curled into the little space in the altar laughing. We sat staring at the floor while Kirsten seeked. I would steal glances at her and I think she would at me in that little confined space. Our breathing seemed like airhorns in silence. My fingers gripped my own sleeve out of dread and nervousness.

Lynn was moving to go to college out of state after this year. I was dreading it, especially since this year we had no classes together. Another reason for the anxious thought of my friends leaving me forever to fly around in my stomach flapping its wings. I can’t stand that damn thought. Our tightly woven collective being stretched in different directions and unwound until we are all apart. My chest would tighten every time it crossed my mind. Lynn noticed I think. Her hand outstretched and her fingers grasped my wrist. Her thumb ran back and forth on me soothingly and I heard her breathing soften before mine followed soot. I felt warm in that moment, like time had stopped for us. We heard footsteps and Kirsten's shaky light lit up the spaces around us. Her hand pulled away from mine gently as she put her finger to her lips.

When I heard the footsteps come closer I burst out of the alter throwing my hands up and yelling like a mad man. I swear she looked like a cat the way she jumped out of her skin. I laughed my ass off as Lynn and I stumbled back to the entrance nearly in tears at her fearful reaction. Next found was Gavin who waltzed into the room laughing just like us.

“Dude I just scared the shit out of Kirsten!” He said with a pep in his step.

“Is everyone gonna scare her?” I laughed along with him.

He sat to the left of me as Lynn listened to music through my headphones since hers had died. “So have you had a good birthday so far man?” He said with a polite and earnest smile.

“Yeah I’ve loved it so far dude. You guys make every year great.” He gave a nice grin.

“Good.”

We sat in comfortable silence for a while. That comfort, that presence he has, that's why he's my brother in my eyes. No matter if it’s just chatting about nerdy stuff or having serious deep conversation he’s always there. He was there for me through the worst parts of my life to hold me up and vice versa. 

“So whatcha getting with your birthday money?” He asked.

“Probably some games. Got any ideas for multiplayer games?”

“Oh yeah Rob brought up the idea of like… god I can’t remember the name of it but it’s like a multiplayer game set in the woods and you connect your mics and you can’t talk or the thing will find you,” Gavin seemed hyped up as he described it.

“Oh shit you’re talking about Don’t Breathe!” I lit up in recognition. “Yeah fuck dude I’ll get it tonight and we can play it after this cabin trip.”

“Shweeeet!” He laughed.

We chuckled together remembering old memories of various games with various people.

“So how’re things with Becca?” I asked, giving him an equally earnest smile.

“Things are going great man… she's like the perfect girl for me, yah know?”

“See I told you while we were working at the haunt this year that breaking out of your shell would be worth it.”

“Yeah I guess you were right.”

We both looked forward. “You ever get worried the friend group will split up after high school?” It came out of my mouth without a thought.

“Sometimes. Not really worried about you though just the rest, scared they'll split off. But I always get reassurance whenever we hang out that it’s not gonna happen.” His hands rubbed together to keep warm as the night progressed and the night got colder or maybe he was worried like me, maybe the reassurance wasn't enough.

“Yeah…” I muttered, reassured only slightly at his remark.

“Sup shit birds!” We jumped as Ethan screamed. He laughed at us all being scared besides Lynn who took my headset off her head confused at what had happened. Soon Rob had been found by Kirsten then we piled together for another game and my turn was up. I was the next seeker. 

The others all scattered and hid as I counted upwards. I could hear them rushing to find their spots as my time to count ticked by. “One, Two, Three.” I focused on them, the feeling of it all, the feeling of being with my friends or the feeling of being alone in that dark room. I can’t remember. “Forty four, Forty five, Forty six.” That bug in my chest sprouted once more. It dove to the pits of my stomach, dread poured down that same pit weighing me like chains over my shoulders. No reassurance was gonna be found at this moment, no safety. “One hundred, One hundred and one, one hundred and two.” I covered my eyes and touched my face in a desperate attempt to ground myself. It didn’t work. “One fifty eight, one fifty nine, one sixty…” Two minutes had passed and I took my forearm off my eyes. “Ready or not here I c-” I looked outside.

A lone figure stood in the field. It had a white sheet over it and two eye holes like a tacky Halloween costume in a low budget slasher film. Its shoulders were impossibly broad, too wide and tall to be normal, nearly at chin height. The sheet draped down to the figure's toes covering all of it. The sight was uncanny. I felt chills slither up my back and my panic level rise. I just stared at the shape in the field like it was otherworldly, no, it was otherworldly. Those small holes in the cloth were too tiny for a person to see. The shoulders weren't proportionate, and why have it pool at your feet to cover your entirety. That thing was off, it was off in every way.

Time seemed to slow as I backed up slowly. I shut the entrance to the haunt as I did, breaking the line of sight between the sheeted figure and I. The room submerged in inky darkness. I clicked my flashlight on to illuminate it. I walked into the passageways trembling. “Guys come out! Something's wrong! Guys!” My voice reverberated back to me like a faint cry for help. “Guys I’m serious there's someone outside! Guys…” My voice cracked like I was a little boy on the verge of tears. I clutched my light with both hands as I turned each corner expecting a man I had never seen before to be sprinting at me. “GUYS!” Only my voice filled the silence, nothing else.

I could hear the plastic handle tapping against my clammy palms as my beam of light quivered. I scurried through the kitchen searching for anyone then into the chapel. My heart froze and my veins filled with ice. Nine figures all draped in white sheets. “Fuck…”

I scanned them for inconsistencies. Everyone of them were a different kind underneath. One was bigger, another was tiny, and the other had almost cartoony proportions. There were less consistencies than inconsistencies and the one thing that was consistent were eye holes on every mannequin. At least none had weird shoulders I thought, hoping I could trick myself.

I swallowed and felt sweat build on my head in the forty degree weather. I could feel the stares of these ghosts burning through the sweat and into my core. My feet dragged as I padded through the crowd of them. My brain was screaming at me every time I looked into those terrible eyes, seeing nothing but black holes staring back at me. I scooted past the first mannequin, my whole body tight, my arms and thighs squeezed together. A crack broke through the silence, loud like snapping celery. I jumped and pointed my flashlight outwards like a gun as if it would protect me. I looked at the mannequins surrounding me and noticed it. The sheeted mannequin in front of me had a larger left shoulder than its right.

It lunged at me with ferocity and shrieked into my face, two hands wrapped around my left arm as I screamed in terror. The things shriek was like a wailing coyote and a baby's anguished cries for its mother at the same time. I leaped back knocking over the mannequin behind me but the thing's arm stretched in an otherworldly way. I heard its joints pop out of place and its dark burnt skin stretch and tear like leather. The ligaments and muscles pulled and snapped like stringy bits of beef jerky through the tears in its skin. The hands gripped tight enough to feel like my arm could be snapped. I watch one arm's elbow snap the opposite direction as if its bones were made of twigs. I reached back, prepared to throw a punch into its wrist. Its bones were weak like a rotting carcass and the wrist let out a god awful crunch as my knuckles slammed into it. It let out an infant's wail as I pulled from its doubled grip. As I scrambled to run I glanced at the two arms. Both had thumbs facing to its left. It had two right arms. I watched in utter shock and horror as more ghastly frail arms wrapped around the two and hid them back up its raised cloth. An ungodly smell of mold and shit filled the room. I nearly fell to vomit at a mere whiff of the scent but my fight or flight carried me back through hall after hall.

I banged into walls in my sprint slamming my knee and shoulders into countless objects. “HELP!” I screamed for the others, my voice completely broken with fear. My foot slammed into something and I fell to the ground. I rolled on my back and crawled backwards in my panic. I was back in the entrance room but the door was shut. I started to hear footsteps all around me shuffling and banging on the walls. I heard giggles swarm around me like bees and I felt those eyes burning holes into me again through the darkness. I curled up at the shut door, my whole being shaking like a leaf. “HELP ME!” Footsteps rushed through the darkness towards me at incredible speeds. “HELP!!”

Gavin grabbed my shoulders tight. “Dude what happened, are you okay!?” I looked up to see the five of them standing there nervous as to what happened.

“Dude this better not be a prank like we thought…” Rob said his hands gripping the hem of his hoodie. 

Lynn looked at me with worried eyes, “Yeah, what happened?” she said, concerned. Ethan looked anxious to find out if I was okay, and Kirsten was shaken badly clinging to her shoulders bundling herself in her own arms.

“SOMETHINGS IN HERE!” I said with tears filling my eyes. Gavin looked down seeing dark ashy handprints on my jacket sleeve.

“Something?” Ethan mumbled.

THUD THUD THUD.

Three knocks came from the left employees only halls. Gavin raised me up in my disheveled state with a hand on my back and we slowly edged ourselves towards the hidden door. I moved forward putting my shuddering hand on the door frame and pulling it open. Something made a clang against the metal wall and we stared down the empty hallway. Silence overtook us. It seemed like no one even dared to breathe. Then the wood door to a scare actor's cubby creaked open slowly. Dirt and soot fell from hand prints on the door. Seven handprints.

First off my anxiety and racing heart rate are much improved. So much more manageable. Even laughing again. Social anxiety is even a lot better.

The second thing I have noticed is I'm losing fat. My pants and clothes are getting looser. Did not change my diet at all. And always drank black coffee so it is not from cream and sugar removal. Gotta be related to stress hormones causing me to store fat and now it's starting to go away. What a terrific unexpected benefit. Maybe the better sleep is a reason too for losing fat. 

Had no idea caffeine was causing so many problems with my health. Thank goodness I figured  it out.

1p0r7hs,https://www.reddit.com/r/Eutychus/comments/1p0r7hs/small_token_of_appreciation/,Small token of appreciation,"Hello. I’m looking for some advice on how to handle a situation respectfully.

I recently found out that my child’s teacher is a Jehovah’s Witness. I didn’t know this at the start of the school year, and earlier on I had given the classroom/teacher a store gift card, plus made a few small classroom purchases here and there. I’ve also occasionally brought in little “thank you” items for the teacher and aides, like coffee or lip balm during the winter—just small tokens of appreciation.

I only became aware of the teacher’s faith when I learned that the teacher wouldn’t be participating in the school’s Halloween events (the kids still participated, just not the teacher). Now that the semester has ended, I wanted to give a heartfelt handwritten note thanking the teacher because the teacher is truly a wonderful educator. I was also planning to include a small gift card, completely unrelated to any holiday or season. The card does not have a theme and is just an image of nature.

Separately, but perhaps importantly, I had already planned to give the classroom aides small fall/Thanksgiving-themed goodie bags the week before break. These are just for the aides, not the teacher.

Now I’m second-guessing myself. Would it be inappropriate or uncomfortable for the teacher if I give the thank-you note and small gift card the same week the other staff are receiving fall/Thanksgiving goodie bags? Should I avoid giving it at that time altogether? Or would it be better to ask the teacher directly, but respectfully, whether they’re comfortable receiving small, non-holiday tokens of appreciation? I absolutely don’t want to put the teacher in an uncomfortable position or seem like I’m ignoring the teacher’s beliefs, but I also genuinely want to express appreciation for the incredible work they’ve done with my child. I’m just not sure which approach is the most considerate.

I  absolutely know that choosing you was the best decision,I have ever made. You are the best thing that has ever happened to me. I'm still working on being a much more refined ,polished,and most important always operate in the realm of profound honesty and self awareness and emotional intelligence,as I try to remain centered  in empathy as my base..The space I need is not from you,nor do I gain any solace from it. That being said, this  isn't  meI prospecting,actually  I'm very pleased  to be moving toward each other in any capacity and I'm so very grateful for even this as a consideration. I don't have  a pressure valve and  my current living situation doesn't  provide a safe space for heartache,heartbreak,or outwardly displays of emotionally. So I cope as best as I can,but  this has been the most difficult year I have  ever had and still have the holiday season to traverse. Yeah. 
 No trips,stay on your path ,heal as I will continue to do the same. And I know there is no shortage of guys trying to be your new guy,and it seems that the only way is to continue to remind you of how terrible I was,instead of in some cases not being responsible for how terribly the might have been to you themselves. Please just be weary of the subtle but very  powerful manipulation that is wrapped in the pretty packaging. I know you aren't naive  but  I know you are vulnerable and it seems that reminding you how terrible I am has become their default setting. This only comes from a place of unconditional love ,whether we ever get back together or not. I will always love you and want the best for you,because of the lasting impacts you have made in life. If you want to talk or just say hi,just holla  at me,I feel kinda weird calling you cause it always seems like it not a good time or I'm bothering you,and it adds to the heaviness that I'm going through here. Maybe I'll  send  a preemptive text to check timing. 
      For the record I have not dated or been with anyone one else. I tried to meet someone for coffee  but it never materialized  and  I was actually a bit relieved cause it was  more ego driven anyways,more of a response to all the guys lining up for you.I know I'm nowhere close to being ready for those kind  of engagements yet,who knows if I'll ever be. One foot in front of the other is all I can do right now.Just know that I'm still very much in love with you,hurt and all but still. Hopefully we will talk soon. Missing you more.

Alex's life with John, the absolutely-definitely-immortal-but-won't-admit-it billionaire who ran Aegis Q, sipped whiskey with Lucifer, and had just accidentally revealed himself as Alexander the Great before gaslighting Alex with claims of ""YouTube tutorials,"" was a daily free-fall through a reality where sanity was a distant memory and tacos were a weapon of psychological warfare. 

By now, Alex's Excel spreadsheet had become a sacred text—78 entries across three color-coded tabs, with a new section titled ""Smoking Guns John Denied"" that included last night's Alexander documentary slip-up. Alex was beyond frustrated. He was righteously, obsessively, spreadsheet-documented furious. 

John had said ""I didn't look like that"" about Alexander the Great, demonstrated perfect Macedonian sword techniques, and critiqued battle tactics with the expertise of someone who'd personally commanded the phalanx at Gaugamela. And then? He'd blamed it on ""immersive learning"" and claimed he was born in Camden, New Jersey. 

Alex was done asking John. Clearly, the man would deflect until the heat death of the universe. What Alex needed was a witness. Someone who knew the truth and couldn't be bribed with tacos. 

So when a young man who looked like a Greek hero stepped straight out of mythology, with John's unmistakable features and a gorgon medallion around his neck, showed up claiming to be John's son and casually asking about ""Andy,"" Alex's brain didn't just malfunction—it filed for early retirement and moved to a monastery where roommates were just roommates and nobody had demigod children. 

# The Perseus Doppelgänger 

It was a muggy Tuesday evening, October 14, 2025, and Alex was sprawled on the couch, still reeling from Sunday's Alexander revelation-then-denial. He'd spent the last two days obsessively Googling ""Alexander the Great height,"" ""Macedonian battle tactics,"" and ""how to prove your roommate is an ancient conqueror without sounding insane."" 

John was in the kitchen, tinkering with a coffee maker that looked suspiciously like it had been forged in ancient Athens, while the Heart of Karnataka ruby sat on the counter, doubling as a paperweight for what appeared to be actual Pentagon briefing notes (because of course). 

A knock at the door—light but confident, like someone who'd slain a Gorgon and lived to tell the tale—snapped Alex out of his research spiral. 

He shuffled over, expecting a delivery or maybe Sarah finally showing up to stage an intervention. Instead, he faced a young man in his mid-20s who looked like he'd walked off a Greek vase and through a GQ photoshoot on the way. 

Chiseled jaw? Check. Wavy dark hair that looked like it had been styled by the gods themselves? Check. Eyes that sparkled with a mix of mischief and heroism that screamed ""I've seen some shit and laughed about it""? Double check. 

But what made Alex's brain screech to a halt like a car hitting a concrete wall was the resemblance to John. Same sharp cheekbones. Same easy grin that said, ""I know something you don't, and it's hilarious."" Same presence that made you feel like you were in the company of someone who'd outlived empires. 

The guy wore a leather jacket and jeans—modern but with a timeless quality—and around his neck was a battered bronze medallion etched with a gorgon's head, glinting like it had a story older than Rome. 

""Is John here?"" the guy asked, his voice smooth with a hint of an ancient accent Alex couldn't quite place. Greek, maybe? Macedonian? 

Alex's brain was doing Olympic-level gymnastics. ""Uh, yeah, he's... inside,"" he stammered, stepping aside like a bouncer who'd just realized he was outclassed. 

The guy strode in with the confidence of someone who'd probably beheaded mythological monsters before breakfast, and John looked up from the coffee maker, his face lighting up like he'd just spotted an old war buddy. 

""Perce!"" John shouted, dropping a wrench and pulling the guy into a bear hug that could've cracked ribs. ""How's my boy? And how's Andy doing?"" 

Alex's beer bottle—which he'd been clutching like a stress ball—slipped from his hand, shattering on the floor in a cascade of foam and glass. 

Perce? Andy? As in Perseus and Andromeda? The Greek myth power couple? 

His roommate, who'd just been outed as probably-Alexander-the-Great, was now hugging a guy who looked like Perseus—the hero who slayed Medusa, saved Andromeda, and was apparently John's son? 

Alex's mind flashed to every clue: John's ""prop"" sword (Excalibur, but maybe also a Greek hero's blade?), the military papers, the ruby, Lucifer's tales of John outdrinking Dionysus and dodging Athena's wrath. This wasn't just immortal. This was mythological patriarch territory. 

# The Father-Son Reunion 

Perseus—because there was no way this guy was anyone else—grinned, clapping John on the back with enough force to dent armor. ""Andy's great, Dad. Still mad about that time you and Merlin crashed our wedding with a hydra, but she's running a gallery in Athens now. Modern art, but she sneaks in some old statues. You'd love it."" 

John laughed, a deep, nostalgic sound that made Alex's knees wobble. ""Classic Andy. Tell her to stop hiding the good stuff. That bust of Poseidon's worth a fortune. She should display it properly."" 

Dad? Alex's internal monologue was screaming. Wedding? Hydra? Poseidon? 

John had a son who was Perseus, married to Andromeda, and they were casually chatting about crashing weddings with mythological monsters like it was a hilarious prank and not a felony against reality? 

Perseus noticed Alex's shell-shocked stare and offered a hand, his grin pure John but with a heroic edge that suggested he'd just beheaded something with more heads than one. ""You must be the roommate. I'm Perce. Nice place—bit small for Dad, though."" His grin widened. ""He usually goes for castles or palaces. This is very... grounded."" 

Alex shook his hand, muttering, ""Alex. Uh, nice... medallion?"" His voice came out like a squeaky toy that had been stepped on. 

Perseus glanced at the gorgon-etched bronze, chuckling. ""Family heirloom. Keeps the snakes away."" He winked, and Alex didn't laugh. He was too busy processing that John's son—who looked like he'd stepped out of a myth—was standing in their apartment, talking about Medusa like she was an annoying ex. 

John, pouring coffee for Perseus (because of course he had a second mug ready), gestured to the couch. ""Sit, sit. Tell me everything. How's the hero business?"" 

Perseus sprawled on the couch like a demigod on vacation, his leather jacket creaking. ""Slow these days. Monsters are scarce, but I helped Andy with a Minotaur problem last month. You'd like her new gallery—got one of your old shields on display. Second floor, labeled 'ceremonial replica.'"" He snorted. ""If only they knew."" 

John nodded, sipping his coffee. ""Nice. Tell her to send me pics. Merlin's been bugging me about decor for the Maldives villa."" 

Maldives villa? Alex wanted to scream, but his throat had closed up like a bank vault. 

# Alex's Mythological Meltdown (The Prelude) 

Alex stood frozen by the fridge, clutching a broom to clean up the shattered beer bottle, his brain a pinball machine of panic and conspiracy. Perseus. Perseus. The guy who slayed Medusa, married Andromeda, and was one of the most famous heroes in Greek mythology was sitting on their thrift-store couch, drinking coffee, and calling John ""Dad."" 

And John? He was acting like this was completely normal. Like having a demigod son drop by to discuss Minotaurs and art galleries was just another Tuesday. 

""So, uh,"" Alex ventured, his voice cracking, ""Perce. Short for... Perseus?"" 

Perseus grinned, grabbing one of Merlin's cookies from the jar (because of course Merlin had left a fresh batch). ""Yup. That's me. Medusa slayer, Andromeda rescuer, son of this guy."" He jerked a thumb at John, who was now casually reading something on his tablet like his demigod son visiting was as mundane as a pizza delivery. 

""And Andy... that's Andromeda? Like, the constellation?"" 

Perseus nodded, munching his cookie. ""Yeah, though she hates when people bring up the whole 'chained to a rock' thing. Bit traumatic. But yeah, we've been married for... what, 3,000 years now? Give or take. Dad performed the ceremony. Mom was the maid of honor. Epic party, except for the hydra incident."" 

Alex's vision blurred. 3,000 years. Perseus was married for three millennia, John performed the ceremony, and Merlin—John's wife, the smoking-hot sorceress—was the maid of honor? 

""Wait,"" Alex said, his voice barely a whisper. ""Merlin. Your mom. She's... Perseus's mom?"" 

Perseus's grin turned mischievous. ""Yup. Mom and Dad go way back. Like, way back. Bronze Age, probably earlier. They had me around 1400 BCE, so I'm older than most of Dad's famous gigs. The whole Alexander thing? That came way later."" 

1400 BCE. Alex grabbed the counter to keep from fainting. Perseus was over 3,400 years old, which meant John and Merlin had been together for at least that long, and the Alexander the Great phase was just one chapter in a story that spanned millennia. 

""And your dad,"" Alex said, his voice shaking, ""he's... immortal?"" 

Perseus laughed, a booming sound that echoed like thunder from Olympus. ""Uh, yeah? Obviously. Wait—he didn't tell you?"" He looked at John, eyebrows raised. ""Dad, seriously? You're still doing the deflection thing?"" 

John, not looking up from his tablet, shrugged. ""It's funnier this way. Keeps things interesting."" 

""FUNNIER?!"" Alex's voice hit a pitch that could've shattered the ruby. ""You've been gaslighting me for MONTHS! I have a SPREADSHEET with 78 ENTRIES! Your SON just confirmed you're IMMORTAL and you think it's FUNNY?!"" 

John grinned, finally looking up. ""I mean, you were gonna figure it out eventually. Perseus showing up just speeds up the timeline. Want a cookie? Mom made them—they're enchanted."" 

""ENCHANTED?!"" Alex grabbed his phone with trembling hands. This was it. The confirmation. The smoking gun. The witness who couldn't be bribed with tacos. 

# The Non-Confirmation (Because John Still Deflects) 

But before Alex could process Perseus's bombshell, John stood, stretching like he hadn't just been outed as an immortal patriarch. ""Alright, I gotta run an errand. Need to pick up some stuff for the Pentagon briefing tomorrow. Perce, you good hanging out with Alex for a bit? He's been dying to ask questions."" 

Perseus grinned. ""Sure, Dad. I'll keep him company."" 

John grabbed his jacket, patted Alex on the shoulder (which felt condescending and infuriating), and said, ""Don't let Perce corrupt you too much. He's got stories that'll make your spreadsheet explode."" He winked and headed for the door. 

""WAIT!"" Alex shouted. ""You can't just LEAVE! Your son just confirmed you're IMMORTAL! You can't walk away from this!"" 

John paused at the door, grinning over his shoulder. ""I've been walking away from questions for 3,000 years, Alex. I'm pretty good at it. Perce, don't spill all the beans—leave some mystery. Back in an hour!"" 

The door clicked shut, and Alex stood there, jaw hanging open, as John—his probably-Alexander-the-Great, definitely-immortal, absolutely-infuriating roommate—escaped yet again, leaving Alex alone with a demigod who'd just casually dropped a mythological nuke. 

Perseus, still munching his enchanted cookie, grinned. ""So, you got questions? Because I got stories."" 

Alex collapsed onto the couch, clutching his phone like a lifeline. He texted Sarah: ""JOHN'S SON IS HERE. PERSEUS. THE ACTUAL PERSEUS. SAYS JOHN'S IMMORTAL, MARRIED TO MERLIN 3000+ YEARS. JOHN LEFT TO AVOID QUESTIONS."" 

Sarah's reply was a video of her screaming into a pillow for a full 30 seconds, followed by: ""DON'T LET PERSEUS LEAVE. RECORD EVERYTHING."" 

Alex looked at Perseus, who was casually examining Excalibur like it was an old friend. ""So,"" Alex said, his voice hoarse. ""You're really Perseus. And John's really your dad. And you're really over 3,000 years old."" 

Perseus nodded, setting the sword down. ""Yup, yup, and yup. And before you ask—yeah, Dad's Alexander the Great. That documentary slip-up you caught? Classic Dad move. He gets too into critiquing his old work."" 

Alex's heart raced. ""So he was Alexander? He's not from New Jersey?"" 

Perseus burst out laughing. ""New Jersey? Oh man, he told you that? No, dude. Dad's been around since way before New Jersey existed. Way before America. He's older than most civilizations. The Alexander thing was just one of his gigs—a really famous one, but still just a gig."" 

Alex felt vindication surge through him like caffeine mixed with victory. He'd been right. John was immortal. Was Alexander. And now, finally, he had a witness who wasn't gaslighting him with tacos. 

""Okay,"" Alex said, grabbing his laptop and opening his spreadsheet. ""Tell me everything."" 

Perseus grinned, cracking his knuckles. ""Buckle up, mortal. You're about to get the full story. And trust me, it's way weirder than you think.""

1p0r5qu,https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/1p0r5qu/splinter_part_1/,Splinter (Part 1),"“Happy birthday Sweetheart,” Ms. Tonya waved as I stepped out of her class with a feeling of lingering anxiety in my chest and a slow creep of excitement. All 5 of us had been planning this hangout since the start of senior year. My father was the manager of a reasonably popular haunted house attraction for our area and he also just so happened to be long time friends with the owner. So ever since eighth grade and when me and Gavin started working there three years ago it became our tradition to come out and rent a nearby cabin for two nights and mess around in the haunted house until late at night. It started at first as just me, Gavin and Lynn but over the years it transformed into me, Gavin, Lynn, Ethan, and Rob.

My name is Blake. I’m a terribly average guy compared to the others. I like writing, movies, and books, specifically horror and that's all there is to me, besides a diagnosis of social anxiety and depression. I used to wear a leather jacket like Negan from “The Walking Dead” thinking it made me look cool but in reality I seemed like a dork I’m sure. I’m not tall but I’m not short either, I’m not humorless but I’m not a class clown like Ethan, I’m not fat but I’m not skinny. The only thing that sticks out is my long wavy hair. That’s why I’ll say I’m terribly average.

Gavin was my best friend out of the group. Same average height as me with curly brown locks of hair draping down his back, he just clicked with me on every little nerdy thing we found. Just as awkward as me, he stumbled over his words a lot but still managed to crack me up every time he said a joke.

Ethan was a self proclaimed goofball. He was constantly throwing out a joke, good or bad, to anyone who would listen. 6 ’1, chubby but strong, constantly wearing basketball shorts, even in winter, and hoodies over his short, blonde hair, he could make any get together into a hysterical room of laughter or the biggest argument between 5 people you have ever seen. Not only did he like to joke but he liked to argue and most of the time start those very arguments, but he never meant any harm and we never actually got mad.

Then there was Lynn. Constantly draped in black attire she was the chillest out of our group, she was the type to constantly have an earphone in and would just tune in to the rest of our conversations to listen. On the chance that we brought up anything she adored though it was like a spark on gasoline, she could go on for hours and hours but I never protested. 

I walked down the school's winding hallways with fellow bus riders surrounding me on all sides. The gossip of white trash rednecks and painfully bland and dumb blonde girls swirled around me like a tornado. God did I hate school and the people there. I just stuck to my friend group all the time and ignored the drama even when I was in the eye of the storm. I just kept my head down and walked faster wanting to get the school day over and the festivities started. I finally raised my head to see the beautiful glass doors leading out and my excitement rose. I pushed the door open, holding it for a second for the guy behind me and feeling the rays from the grey sky shine on me. I looked to see Gavin, Lynn, and Ethan all in a circle in front of the bus talking. Suddenly I felt the mass of uneasiness cocoon and sprout into weird awkwardness even though we’ve spoken every day for six years. I had classes with Gav and Ethan but none with Lynn this year sadly, so we didn’t see each other much which prompted her to turn and say what she said next.

“Happy birthday dumbass!” she said with a cool attitude then chuckled and smiled.

At that moment the anxiety and awkwardness folded into itself and back into its cocoon as I smiled back.

“Haha shit for brains,” bursted out of my mouth before I could think. She hugged me laughing.

Gavin chuckled as well, moving closer. “Dude thank god they switched when report cards were coming out otherwise I would’ve been under house arrest.”

“What the hell man, failing grades is Blake's trademark not yours!” Ethan belted out.

“Oh fuck you tubby!” I laughed along.

He bumped my arm with his elbow playfully but hard enough for it to hurt which was right on brand for Ethan. We walked onto the bus, the unfamiliar red seats intriguing me as Lynn and I slid into a seat opposite to the other two. I had never ridden the bus to Rob’s before, usually he drove us there, but today we were. We would meet him there, meet up with Kirsten, drive to the haunt, mess around and then stay at the cabin once one am struck, at least that had been our ritual these past years minus Kirsten joining us.

Ethan leaned over as we passed through the tidy suburban streets. “Dude, so when are we gonna plan that DND campaign?” Truth be told I had forgotten about it entirely. As I thought about my response I felt the cushion behind me rise up.

“What the hell bro, planning a Dungeons and Dragons campaign without me?!” I knew then the first spark of the day had flown as I felt her hovering over my shoulder. Gavin awkwardly opened his phone to scroll as I enjoyed the banter. They spoke the entire twenty minutes about ideas of a campaign and even their made up characters. I butted in with a couple ideas but I didn’t know much about Dungeons and Dragons or Warhammer or any of the board games they swore they would play one day. By the time Ethan had flown the conversation through hoop after hoop of topics we arrived just in time to avoid a tirade about how Fallout is the best videogame franchise ever. We strolled up to Rob’s door feeling like Reservoir Dogs and knocked candidly.

He opened the door with a clumsy smile. “Howdy doody!”

His pleasantry fell so flat we bursted out in laughter.

“What’d I do…” he mumbled uncertainly, adding to the laughter.

We just waved our hands aside and walked in.

Rob was kind of awkward but a really kind and fun guy to be around. About 6 '2 and skinny with constantly messy hair, he always spoke in a monotone voice as if high constantly yet completely sober. His nerdy interests were even more niche than our weird ones but they were interesting and damn was our music taste identical. We spent hours on end freshman year listening to Arctic Monkeys and Black Sabbath in gym class.

As we walked in Ethan continued talking about Fallout and other rpg’s to Rob while me Gavin and Lynn talked over characters and character arcs in horror games and media. I waltzed into Rob's kitchen to make coffee for myself and Ethan as the minutes went by and he kept talking. The coffee brewed in the machine and dripped into the pot, I felt my chest tighten out of nowhere as my thoughts drifted into the recesses of my mind, places I didn't want to focus on. I closed my eyes and thought of fun times with the group but I think it made it worse. I filled the mugs then poured the milk and stirred the sugar in as I felt a tap on my shoulder.

“Whatcha doin?” Lynn questioned with a soft smile.

I snapped out of it, “O-oh just making coffee.”

“Let me have it.” I handed her my mug as she moved closer expecting her to drink but she just inhaled the steam. “Hmmmmm.”

“What are y-”

“I hate the taste of coffee, I just love the smell,” she said exhaling and handing the cup back to me. I took it back with shaky hands as she treaded over to the pantry. “Down to raid Rob's pantry?” I smiled and sat the mugs down with a clink.

About 3 minutes later Rob finally walked in to see us giggling like school girls while holding two donuts in each hand. “My donuts…” he whined like a wounded puppy.

In the moment of snickering that followed the door knocked almost so quietly that no one heard it.

“H-h-hello…” a timid girl's voice came through the door. 

“Oh Kirsten’s here.” Rob said in his constant monotone voice. He opened the door and there she was.

Kirsten was a petite girl, she seemed like the wind could blow her off her feet and through the air. She rubbed her barely visible hands together in the oversized hoodie she was wearing. Ethan and Gavin's argument in the background over which movie to watch that night seemed to make her jump like a cat just from the volume. I immediately recognized her, we had classes together back when I used to be just as uptight as she was now. I sympathized with her. I also knew by the ruby redness in her face and her gorgeous blue eyes staring at his feet that she liked Rob and Rob liked her. Those beautiful blue eyes could capture any man's heart in an instant I swear. I chuckled and wiped my glaze covered fingers with a napkin and sipped my coffee as Rob made introductions since she was joining the group for the first time. 

“Hi…” she murmured bashfully.

We all said our separate hellos and Ethan immediately started talking music with her. I’m glad, I think it loosened her up as her stiff figure relaxed. Although any time Rob got close she became a wooden board again.

After the shared greetings we packed our small backpacks with snacks and changes of clothes and piled into Rob’s massive jeep.

“Yo thanks again for being the communal driver,” I spoke to Rob from the back of the car.

“No prob man!” He said back a little louder than intended as we pulled out of his driveway and headed to the haunt.

The drive was about thirty minutes there. When Ethan leaped for the bluetooth connect button Kirsten jumped again for the hundredth time and Lynn chuckled. She jumped even more when he started his heavy metal playlist. Lynn and Kirsten tried talking to me but we couldn’t hear because of the dumbass with radio privileges. Those privileges were snatched and given to me after accidently hitting play in the Little Caesars drive-thru. Rob and Gavin finally seemed at peace in the car listening to British pop-rock with me like it was that freshman gym class again.

We drove up and down winding roads, past lodges and lakes, and over a rickety rust bucket of a bridge. Along the way Ethan cranked down the radio with a swift hand movement. “Has Kirsten heard the story?”

“What story…?” she asked innocently as we turned a corner, the trees blocking out most of the ash grey sky.

Me, Gavin and Lynn collectively groaned. “The stupid ass story of the haunt…” We said simultaneously.

“I-I still don’t get it,” Kirsten mumbled.

Ethan turned in his seat to face us gripping the back of the seat intently with a sly smile. “Okay, in the 1800’s there was a mansion on the property where the haunted house is today. The family that lived there was the rich dad, his wife, daughter, and a collection of maids he had amassed over the years. The maids started showing up missing with no evidence as to where they had vanished in the mansion that once stood. One by one the townsfolk noticed the dwindling number of servants. Rumors began of the man being a satanic cultist who was sacrificing the women to the devil. The head priest in town, an influential and charismatic man, led with the rumors and claimed that the rich man was committing unspeakable acts of pure refined evil and needed to be stopped. The town formed a mob and when they stormed the mansion they found the man in the cellar skinning the dismembered corpses of his wife and young daughter. The town stood in shock too scared to even lynch the man. He took his blade and slit his own throat, vowing alliance with Satan as he gushed blood onto his skinless kin. Those in the area believe he was trying to ascend to a higher form of being, a demon, and that his ritual to the devil finally worked when he sacrificed his family. Even today you can hear the abomination he has become in the depths of hell screaming and cackling in joy.”

Kirsten looked colorless like she had just watched a puppy die.

“If only any of that bullshit was real,” Lynn retorted with fiery sass. “Gavin and I have checked the libraries and even online and there is no evidence to show there was ever a rich devil man or some spooky mansion where maids were led to slaughter. It. Is. Bullshit.”

“God you're no fun!” Ethan pouted loudly.

Rob chuckled and made the last turn onto a long stretch of road, the grey beams of light engulfing the car again. Five minutes later the road led us there to the parking lot to the left of the haunt,

The grass parking lot was about seventy feet from the cabins to the right but about two hundred feet to the left was the haunted house and that was our first destination.

Me and Gav carried the pizzas over to the haunt as the others trekked in front of us with blankets and bags leading the way, still arguing whether the story was true or not. Coming from the parking lot we walked into the left side of the metallic building then walked around to the front with wooden planks nailed to the metal sheets to give it an “Evil Dead” impression. In front of it though was a field that if you walked straight away from the house led to a creek running through the woodland town. We decided to sit and eat there to unwind in the frigid autumn breeze before playing hide and seek.

As I sat the few pizza boxes I had ferried over on the blanket Kirsten had sat down I looked up. The group was laughing at dumb inside jokes, taking a slice, or straightening out the blankets in Rob's case. It was a joyous scene even Kirsten joined in on with her own innocent childlike laughter and jokes.

It hurt. It hurt a lot. We all planned on having different careers. Doctors, lawyers, mechanics, and even the horror author I hoped to become. We all were splintering off into our own tales. The cocoon of anxiety sprouted again in my chest and the mass of anxiety fluttered its wings and summersalted into my stomach. I’m so scared of losing them, losing this. I clutched the hem of my shirt. “Why now? On my birthday? C'mon dude don't think about it.” That phrase my brain had conjured up repeated until I felt the warm soft crust of the pizza in my grasp. “It's gonna be okay… right?”

We all sat down to eat. Gavin and I made double-decor pizzas out of two slices and laughed when the others began chanting “fatasses” until we finished three double decors. We leaned backwards, my hand falling on the grass. Ethan kicked my foot teasingly as I made mock bloated groaning noises. Lynn sat criss cross apple sauce beside me showing me posters of my favorite bands asking which one I wanted to stop and get tomorrow.

“You don’t have to get me anything man.”

“Duh I do, it's your freakin birthday, you deserve it.” She retorted with a snort at how dumb I sounded in her mind. “Plus I want to.”

“Dude I know you want that Arctic Monkeys poster.” Gavin said cockily.

“See, even Gav knows.” she smirked winning this court case.

“Fiiiiiine.”

“So what was your favorite song again?” Gav questioned knowing it would start a rant. That had lit my own spark to talk about my favorite bands and the cocoon closed up again. I chuckled as we talked over songs and how important they were to us. Black Sabbath, Nirvana, System of a Down, all of them getting us through break-ups or rebellious phases, or even just one bad night. I got up to grab another slice when I noticed my hand had left a deep black handprint on the blanket.

“What the hell?”

I ran my hand across the blanket and the handprint became a black streak through the snowy cloth. I looked at my palm and saw there was a dark, ashy grey substance coating it. Ash? Gavin looked at the grass and saw that patches of the field were stained with streaks of the ash or whatever it was.

“Has someone lit a fire recently?” Ethan quizzed.

I thought for a mere moment before answering. “No, people don’t touch the place after the last night open for the year.” I pointed over to the fire pit used to keep employees warm on icy nights and the silver tin keeping the fire at bay. “If they did and had a brain they would use that.”

Lynn cocked her head to the side thinking as Kirsten itched beside her eye. What kind of fire could leave trails of ash like this? That question flowed through our heads.

Gavin chimed in. “Could wind have been strong enough to blow ash out of the fire pit?”

“The tin would’ve caught it,” Lynn said with a calculated stare.

Rob took his turn. “Maybe a burning animal?”

“I've not heard of any fires recently…” Kirsten spoke.

“That's the most likely theory though. Maybe lightning set it ablaze,” Ethan snickered at the wild possibility..

“Whatever lets just get to hide and seek,” I smacked my hands together to dust them off and took another slice to eat as we approached. “Actually Kirsten probably needs to be shown around…” I said. I instantly saw Rob's eyes glisten with the thought of “Holy shit the time is now!”

He stepped forward, “I’ll help her through.”

I had to hide my devilish smirk and bite my tongue before I blurted out “Wonder why?” at his cheesy attempt. Lynn chuckled under her breath and Kirsten smiled lightly knowing exactly what I was thinking.

I led the group in front of Rob and Kirsten into the entrance. The first room had five lines in it. The walls, ceiling, and floor were made of either wood, plaster, or in the case of the outer walls of the place metal sheets. All the rooms on the inside were plaster. All the actors' tunnels were wood. Everything was roughly painted black with a decade worth of chipped paint and wear and tear, for that matter the whole place did in a charming antique way. The entry room had 3 doors. A hidden one to the front left of the entrance to enter one half of the employees only halls. One directly in front of the entrance permanently opened because of a wedge under the door, that was the way into the haunt after your group waited in the five short lines. To the left of the entrance was another hidden door leading into the second side of the employees only halls.

The power was out so I pulled six small dinky flashlights from my bag and passed them out. Ethan twirled his between his fingers, Lynn put an earphone in, and Kirsten clutched hers like a lifeline before using her other hand to pinch Rob's sleeve between her pointer and thumb adorably.

I led us through the winding corridors with my light as the others lit up little trinkets and props lining desks and shelves. We went through a kitchen with shiny rubber guts and limbs strewn about, a bathroom with a toilet spray painted brown and the lingering smell of fart spray, church pews with mannequins draped in white sheets (that one in particular always freaked me out), a tunnel with football field turf mangled into fake vines growing up the sides, a jail cell room that had a door with a tempered glass window that was on the bigger side of the room. That door led to a security room. And a boiler room with paper flames and too many little powerless heaters to count.

About half way through I heard Kirstens already shaky breathing become that much more uneasy. Ethan and Rob looked at her with concerned eyes. “It’s a bit claustrophobic huh,” she murmured.

Rob pointed upwards. “Well all of these rooms don't have a like… wood roof, just tarp under a metal roof farther up so it isn’t that cramped in reality.” It eased her a bit but not much. I assume the death grip her pinched fingers had on his jacket helped though.

We wound around hall to hall sometimes taking wrong turns into secret doorways not meant for customers to go through. Finally at the exit we took a turn through a hidden compartment to the employees only hallway. Walking through we saw make up rooms filled with masks and chairs, hidden compartments for actors to pop out at you from, and the two security rooms with cameras set up around the haunt. One of those security rooms on each side of the haunt. You see, the employees only hallways were split into two by the entrance room so each side had its own security room. The hallways made an L shape that were split in the middle by that room. It was a pain to go from one hall to the other when the place was open but it worked. We went through the same path another time to make sure that Kirsten memorized some of the layout, by that point the sun was setting and excitement was climbing.

We all gathered in the entrance room and decided on the seeker as darkness set on the field outside. Rules and parameters were set and where we could go was stated and then the game commenced. Ethan sat counting as Rob and Kirsten ran off together and Gavin, Lynn, and I parted ways. We ran through hidden spaces winding around the main path and long, chilling corridors. I found a rusty barrel to slip into in the boiler room as footsteps pitter pattered all around me. I could hear Lynn locking in and running to my right and Rob and Kirsten's combined giggles to my left. We were all together.

Games went by in flashes. Hiding in lockers, running through the halls with Gavin as Rob sprinted after us, hiding in an old cramped fridge that stained my pant leg, as many creative hiding spots as I could find. After five games like that we all circled again in the entrance. 

Kirsten started counting and Lynn grabbed my wrist, “c-mon!” She hauled me through the halls, nearly bumping me into every object jutting out in the whole place as we went. She dragged me to the eerie chapel room and we both curled into the little space in the altar laughing. We sat staring at the floor while Kirsten seeked. I would steal glances at her and I think she would at me in that little confined space. Our breathing seemed like airhorns in silence. My fingers gripped my own sleeve out of dread and nervousness.

Lynn was moving to go to college out of state after this year. I was dreading it, especially since this year we had no classes together. Another reason for the anxious thought of my friends leaving me forever to fly around in my stomach flapping its wings. I can’t stand that damn thought. Our tightly woven collective being stretched in different directions and unwound until we are all apart. My chest would tighten every time it crossed my mind. Lynn noticed I think. Her hand outstretched and her fingers grasped my wrist. Her thumb ran back and forth on me soothingly and I heard her breathing soften before mine followed soot. I felt warm in that moment, like time had stopped for us. We heard footsteps and Kirsten's shaky light lit up the spaces around us. Her hand pulled away from mine gently as she put her finger to her lips.

When I heard the footsteps come closer I burst out of the alter throwing my hands up and yelling like a mad man. I swear she looked like a cat the way she jumped out of her skin. I laughed my ass off as Lynn and I stumbled back to the entrance nearly in tears at her fearful reaction. Next found was Gavin who waltzed into the room laughing just like us.

“Dude I just scared the shit out of Kirsten!” He said with a pep in his step.

“Is everyone gonna scare her?” I laughed along with him.

He sat to the left of me as Lynn listened to music through my headphones since hers had died. “So have you had a good birthday so far man?” He said with a polite and earnest smile.

“Yeah I’ve loved it so far dude. You guys make every year great.” He gave a nice grin.

“Good.”

We sat in comfortable silence for a while. That comfort, that presence he has, that's why he's my brother in my eyes. No matter if it’s just chatting about nerdy stuff or having serious deep conversation he’s always there. He was there for me through the worst parts of my life to hold me up and vice versa. 

“So whatcha getting with your birthday money?” He asked.

“Probably some games. Got any ideas for multiplayer games?”

“Oh yeah Rob brought up the idea of like… god I can’t remember the name of it but it’s like a multiplayer game set in the woods and you connect your mics and you can’t talk or the thing will find you,” Gavin seemed hyped up as he described it.

“Oh shit you’re talking about Don’t Breathe!” I lit up in recognition. “Yeah fuck dude I’ll get it tonight and we can play it after this cabin trip.”

“Shweeeet!” He laughed.

We chuckled together remembering old memories of various games with various people.

“So how’re things with Becca?” I asked, giving him an equally earnest smile.

“Things are going great man… she's like the perfect girl for me, yah know?”

“See I told you while we were working at the haunt this year that breaking out of your shell would be worth it.”

“Yeah I guess you were right.”

We both looked forward. “You ever get worried the friend group will split up after high school?” It came out of my mouth without a thought.

“Sometimes. Not really worried about you though just the rest, scared they'll split off. But I always get reassurance whenever we hang out that it’s not gonna happen.” His hands rubbed together to keep warm as the night progressed and the night got colder or maybe he was worried like me, maybe the reassurance wasn't enough.

“Yeah…” I muttered, reassured only slightly at his remark.

“Sup shit birds!” We jumped as Ethan screamed. He laughed at us all being scared besides Lynn who took my headset off her head confused at what had happened. Soon Rob had been found by Kirsten then we piled together for another game and my turn was up. I was the next seeker. 

The others all scattered and hid as I counted upwards. I could hear them rushing to find their spots as my time to count ticked by. “One, Two, Three.” I focused on them, the feeling of it all, the feeling of being with my friends or the feeling of being alone in that dark room. I can’t remember. “Forty four, Forty five, Forty six.” That bug in my chest sprouted once more. It dove to the pits of my stomach, dread poured down that same pit weighing me like chains over my shoulders. No reassurance was gonna be found at this moment, no safety. “One hundred, One hundred and one, one hundred and two.” I covered my eyes and touched my face in a desperate attempt to ground myself. It didn’t work. “One fifty eight, one fifty nine, one sixty…” Two minutes had passed and I took my forearm off my eyes. “Ready or not here I c-” I looked outside.

A lone figure stood in the field. It had a white sheet over it and two eye holes like a tacky Halloween costume in a low budget slasher film. Its shoulders were impossibly broad, too wide and tall to be normal, nearly at chin height. The sheet draped down to the figure's toes covering all of it. The sight was uncanny. I felt chills slither up my back and my panic level rise. I just stared at the shape in the field like it was otherworldly, no, it was otherworldly. Those small holes in the cloth were too tiny for a person to see. The shoulders weren't proportionate, and why have it pool at your feet to cover your entirety. That thing was off, it was off in every way.

Time seemed to slow as I backed up slowly. I shut the entrance to the haunt as I did, breaking the line of sight between the sheeted figure and I. The room submerged in inky darkness. I clicked my flashlight on to illuminate it. I walked into the passageways trembling. “Guys come out! Something's wrong! Guys!” My voice reverberated back to me like a faint cry for help. “Guys I’m serious there's someone outside! Guys…” My voice cracked like I was a little boy on the verge of tears. I clutched my light with both hands as I turned each corner expecting a man I had never seen before to be sprinting at me. “GUYS!” Only my voice filled the silence, nothing else.

I could hear the plastic handle tapping against my clammy palms as my beam of light quivered. I scurried through the kitchen searching for anyone then into the chapel. My heart froze and my veins filled with ice. Nine figures all draped in white sheets. “Fuck…”

I scanned them for inconsistencies. Everyone of them were a different kind underneath. One was bigger, another was tiny, and the other had almost cartoony proportions. There were less consistencies than inconsistencies and the one thing that was consistent were eye holes on every mannequin. At least none had weird shoulders I thought, hoping I could trick myself.

I swallowed and felt sweat build on my head in the forty degree weather. I could feel the stares of these ghosts burning through the sweat and into my core. My feet dragged as I padded through the crowd of them. My brain was screaming at me every time I looked into those terrible eyes, seeing nothing but black holes staring back at me. I scooted past the first mannequin, my whole body tight, my arms and thighs squeezed together. A crack broke through the silence, loud like snapping celery. I jumped and pointed my flashlight outwards like a gun as if it would protect me. I looked at the mannequins surrounding me and noticed it. The sheeted mannequin in front of me had a larger left shoulder than its right.

It lunged at me with ferocity and shrieked into my face, two hands wrapped around my left arm as I screamed in terror. The things shriek was like a wailing coyote and a baby's anguished cries for its mother at the same time. I leaped back knocking over the mannequin behind me but the thing's arm stretched in an otherworldly way. I heard its joints pop out of place and its dark burnt skin stretch and tear like leather. The ligaments and muscles pulled and snapped like stringy bits of beef jerky through the tears in its skin. The hands gripped tight enough to feel like my arm could be snapped. I watch one arm's elbow snap the opposite direction as if its bones were made of twigs. I reached back, prepared to throw a punch into its wrist. Its bones were weak like a rotting carcass and the wrist let out a god awful crunch as my knuckles slammed into it. It let out an infant's wail as I pulled from its doubled grip. As I scrambled to run I glanced at the two arms. Both had thumbs facing to its left. It had two right arms. I watched in utter shock and horror as more ghastly frail arms wrapped around the two and hid them back up its raised cloth. An ungodly smell of mold and shit filled the room. I nearly fell to vomit at a mere whiff of the scent but my fight or flight carried me back through hall after hall.

I banged into walls in my sprint slamming my knee and shoulders into countless objects. “HELP!” I screamed for the others, my voice completely broken with fear. My foot slammed into something and I fell to the ground. I rolled on my back and crawled backwards in my panic. I was back in the entrance room but the door was shut. I started to hear footsteps all around me shuffling and banging on the walls. I heard giggles swarm around me like bees and I felt those eyes burning holes into me again through the darkness. I curled up at the shut door, my whole being shaking like a leaf. “HELP ME!” Footsteps rushed through the darkness towards me at incredible speeds. “HELP!!”

Gavin grabbed my shoulders tight. “Dude what happened, are you okay!?” I looked up to see the five of them standing there nervous as to what happened.

“Dude this better not be a prank like we thought…” Rob said his hands gripping the hem of his hoodie. 

Lynn looked at me with worried eyes, “Yeah, what happened?” she said, concerned. Ethan looked anxious to find out if I was okay, and Kirsten was shaken badly clinging to her shoulders bundling herself in her own arms.

“SOMETHINGS IN HERE!” I said with tears filling my eyes. Gavin looked down seeing dark ashy handprints on my jacket sleeve.

“Something?” Ethan mumbled.

THUD THUD THUD.

Three knocks came from the left employees only halls. Gavin raised me up in my disheveled state with a hand on my back and we slowly edged ourselves towards the hidden door. I moved forward putting my shuddering hand on the door frame and pulling it open. Something made a clang against the metal wall and we stared down the empty hallway. Silence overtook us. It seemed like no one even dared to breathe. Then the wood door to a scare actor's cubby creaked open slowly. Dirt and soot fell from hand prints on the door.

I’ve got eczema, contact dermatitis, food allergies, and MCAS which all manifest on my skin. I feel like I don’t just walk on eggshells but I live on them, I don’t know how my skin will be within an hour let alone a day. 

My skin has never been normal for about three years, and I’ve found myself lately in a perpetual state of mourning my old self and obsessing over the life I could have had without this. I genuinely feel it’s stopped me from doing so many things, from little things like walking around in shorts in summer to the big stuff like getting married.

I’ve been in one continuous flare now since last September, that’s over a year of hell, and I mean hell. I’m convinced I had TSW, and since then my whole life hasn’t been the same. I can’t eat hardly any foods without it flaring my skin. I was already allergic to milk which cut out a lot of things, but now it’s gluten, soy, corn, chocolate, coffee, sugar. All I want is to eat french bread and butter, that’s it! 

It feels so overwhelming like my world is getting smaller and smaller, and my freedom and the life I want to live is getting further away. All I want to do is wake up of a morning like I used to and have the freedom of wondering “what shall I do today, where shall I go?” Rather than an instant awareness of my body and how it’s going to rule my life that day. 

Is it giving me the day off? Or will I be cooped up at home because it’s decided to react to something that 99.9% of the world’s population uses or eats or drinks without a second thought.

It’s a cruel condition and I am so truly fed up of living with it. ",9,1763507468.0,eczema,1,1.0,False

1p0r539,https://www.reddit.com/r/AITAH/comments/1p0r539/aitah_for_driving_4_hours_to_meet_someone_who_was/,AITAH for driving 4 hours to meet someone who was unsure,"So I met this girl online and we hit it off pretty quick. We had a lot in common and we liked each other's company. She let me know very early on she wasn't looking for a relationship and I respected that, as much as I liked her.

Time goes on and we're planning to meet up. We plan a weekend of sex, cuddling, chatting and a movie, what could go wrong? I live 4 hours away from her so I knew going into it that it was going to be a gamble because I was going to be spending like $160 in gas. I asked for affirmation several times and she gave it to me every single time. We almost planned to a tee every single thing we were going to be doing. This planning process lasted at least a week and the day before my trip we got as hot and heavy as we ever did.

We were comfortably sending nudes and even telling each other how much we like each other. I also asked her what the odds were that by the end of the night Saturday she'd be my girlfriend. Our relationship grew very quickly and it felt like she was past the point of not wanting a boyfriend. She gave me an 80% chance of becoming her boyfriend by the end of the weekend. So you could say I was pretty damn excited to go up. I wake up at 9:00 a.m. which is extremely early for me. I'd already packed the night before and I was running off very little sleep. 

I get into her city at around 2:00. During the trip I'd been calling her because she clearly was not awake. She ended up waking up at around 1:30 and by the time I got there it took her an additional hour to finish getting ready. I didn't complain. I didn't even make any comments. I was honestly just excited to meet her. 

She walks out and I don't think I've ever smiled as hard as I did when I saw her for the first time. She was beautiful. She was everything I wanted her to be. I opened her door for her like a gentleman and the first place we went to was the pet store to look at hamsters and stuff. She’d expressed how much she loves them and how cute they are. So I knew this would likely win her over to some degree. 

Then we go to the hotel. Thankfully she pitched in $100 for this hotel, which I very much appreciated and I made sure to let her know that. I planned on paying for EVERYTHING else. We get in the room and immediately she's on her phone. It's 2025, she’s very active online, I get it. I lay in bed next to her and I start hinting that I want to cuddle. She doesn't seem super interested in cuddling which is odd because that's one of the main things she said she was excited for.

I in no way forced myself on to her, she eventually said we could cuddle and we started. At this moment I could tell she was still a bit nervous seeing as she was meeting me for the first time which is completely understandable. I made sure to tell her “if I do anything that makes you uncomfortable let me know immediately.” She agreed and even said “no shit."" Time goes on. She's still on her phone and I'm basically just trying to commence what we had already planned on doing. I start sliding my hand up her shirt and before I get anywhere I ask her, “Is this okay?” she says “yes.”

So there I am, handful of titty, huge smile on my face. I whisper in her ear, “If this is the most I get to do, I'm content with that,” which in hindsight is very foreshadowing.

I start with some cutesy talk and giving her little pecks here and there like on the head and the neck and stuff. I'm head over heels for this girl and she knows it. I'm just hoping to get some sort of reaction out of her. She gives me literally nothing. So I do what any respectable man would do and I stop everything. She turns 180° and lays on the other side of the bed. At this point I'm simply confused as to what her intentions are. It feels like she brought me all the way up here on false pretenses and everything just feels off. She’s clearly a bit talker over text. So I ask her “are we going to do anything at any point?” I wasn't trying to rush her. I was genuinely just curious. She tells me “we will later.”

I also turned 180° just to be able to talk to her and I start rubbing her back. She tells me she likes what I'm doing so I keep doing it. I tell her it's not so easy to do over the sweater so she tells me to put my hand under. No big deal. I massage her back. She laughs when I get to her neck which I think was adorable, and she was clearly enjoying it. She even mentioned several other times that night how much she loved my massages. 

I was really aiming to be more sensual than anything with this girl. I really liked her and I really wanted her to see that. I didn't push things farther than they needed to go, and I was willing to wait for her to be ready to do whatever we were going to do.

Time goes on. We're chilling, talking and then she asks to go back to her dorm to grab some things to bring to the hotel, pretty understandable. I did find it a bit weird that she didn't bring anything to the hotel on her first trip here, but I didn't really question it.

I drive her back to the dorm and when she's inside she texts me. “Hey! I might just stay here tonight if that's okay.” At this moment I felt so many emotions. I drove all the way up here, 4 hours away from home and she's going to stand me up like this? She explained that she wasn't comfortable and I simply asked her to elaborate which she didn't. The second she mentioned being uncomfortable, I knew that the night was not going to go the way I intended it to go. Her comfort is the most important thing, I will definitely put a big emphasis on that. I don't think I personally did anything that would have made her uncomfortable and if I did why isn't she telling me? The whole thing is definitely a bit fast, but judging by our conversations it seemed that she didn't mind that one bit. I was also very willing to be patient with things. I honestly just wanted to cuddle her to sleep.

If she didn't plan on moving fast, why did she ask me to get a hotel? I originally told her I’d just do a day trip, but she convinced me to stay the night. Why would she lead me on this much if she had no intentions with me? To be frank, I was pretty heartbroken. We were originally going to go see a movie after she grabbed stuff from the dorm but I simply told her not to bother.

I took her to a coffee shop to get a drink and then parked in the parking lot to talk for a little bit. I kept asking questions without pushing anything. “Why are you uncomfortable? Is there something I did? Is there anything I could do to make the experience more enjoyable for you? Why don't we just go back to the hotel and talk for a bit? If you want me to drive you back, I will in a heartbeat.”

She had zero interest. I also have really bad anxiety and hate being alone, so imagine being stranded in a different province 4 hours away from anyone you know. The second I dropped her off I started going crazy. I called her and told her “hey I'm not doing great.” I explained my anxiety and explained why I wouldn't like being alone. Since that phone conversation that night it has been radio silence.

If she's not interested in me that's perfectly fine, but she's been acting like nothing's wrong. She messages me maybe one time a day and it's drier than a desert. I did not do anything in that hotel room that we didn't previously talk about, and I did not do a single thing without her permission. 

I sense there's a mental maturity issue here but it's still really hard for me to wrap my head around. Am I in the wrong here or is she? If anything needs to be further elaborated I will certainly do so. It doesn't need to be said, but I will also mention that I've been fucking depressed about this shit. She seemed perfect- that weekend should have been perfect. If she was at least honest about everything, it wouldn't bother me this much, but ghosting me after everything? I wasted a whole ass day, and I value my time.

\*EDIT 1: We planned on going to the hotel to do stuff immediately. We were hot and heavy leading up to the day. Even with that being the case, I was still patient, allowing her time to get comfortable.\*

\*EDIT 2: My issue isn't her discomfort, it's the lack of communication. A simple ""I'm not interested,"" or ""I don't think this is going to work,"" is a lot better for my mental health then SILENCE.\*

TLDR: I drove 4 hours to see a girl who basically stood me up. There were zero boundaries, but I was still respectful. She has since abandoned our friendship without explanation.",0,1763507451.0,AITAH,25,0.4,False

Apparently astronauts feel a mixture of exhilaration , anxiety, rapture, depression, tenderness, anger, hope, despair - when seeing the earth from space. That just sounds like a typical Monday morning to me. 

Suddenly everything makes sense, then it collapses again. I almost had it, I almost figured it all out.

I was in my daughter’s bed when I found out. She’d woken up in the night and needing comforting. We both fell back asleep. I looked at my phone and saw the missed calls and texts. Something significant has happened. 

“Please call me when you see this” 

Some excitement in my life. A respite from the drudgery of work. How does this make you feel. Fresh, alive, living in the moment. Then comes the anxiety and depression. The guilt. What should I feel guilty for? I think of all the times he’d insulted me. And all the times I’d insulted him. 

My brother was dead. 




Sometimes I think we’re all shallow. All we want is to feel ok. We’ll do almost anything to feel ok. 



The patient’s current state of psychological disequilibrium appears to stem from a multifactorial interplay between chronic neurocognitive overstimulation and a maladaptive feedback loop within the limbic–prefrontal regulatory axis. Persistent exposure to psychosocial stressors has likely induced a dysregulated cortisol cascade, culminating in a hypo-responsive amygdaloid threat-detection system paradoxically coexisting with an overactive default mode network prone to ruminative intrusions. Compensatory mechanisms within the serotonergic and dopaminergic pathways appear insufficient, resulting in a functional decoupling between motivational drive and executive oversight.

1p0r19h,https://v.redd.it/oue4i0ypj32g1,Burrs touching but still no espresso? [Eureka Mignon Libra],"**Are these burrs touching or not and if they are, is that ... an issue?**

*Back story:*

A few months ago I splurged on the King Size Grind Dial for my Eureka Libra (2024). I used the opportunity to calibrate the 0 point on the dial to the burrs touching. A few weeks after I then tried a bag of beans gifted to me. Whatever I tried, my QuickMill Evo 70 never took more than 15 seconds to produce 30 g of liquid with 15 g in. I went to 0 on the dial and still had a waterfall of coffee coming out way to quickly.

After trying different beans (better, but more or less the same issue), retightening the little screws in the dial, going coarser to eliminate chances of channeling and losing my mind, I gave up and brought the grinder to the dealer who has a repair shop. On the pickup later I was informed that

>the dial was not put on correctly

and that

>you have to tighten both of the little screws

and that it is now fixed.

Because I could not believe that someone (me) could be too stupid to screw on a dial and put two screws in, I asked for a quick test at the shop. Being the customer friendly shop they are, they put in some of their beans, ground them at dial setting 8 and put them into a Rocket machine which promptly choked. Now humbled, I paid and took my grinder home.

I was curious and ran the grinder with no beans at the same setting we used at the shop. This is what you can hear in the Video above. To my ears the burrs seem to be touching at around the 10 mark now. Grinding there gives me flow times at around 10-15 seconds. Grinding at around 8 gives me sane flow times at around 30 seconds. So maybe all is good now.

*Is it though?*

Maybe these burrs are badly misaligned and just not parallel? I know burrs are more robust than one would think but is going so far beyond the point of them touching fine on a regular basis?",2,1763507195.0,espresso,4,1.0,False

**Question:**

_Tw for mentions of things like throwing up‼️Anybody have any advice on getting phlegm/mucus out of your throat? I’m not sick, but the new cold weather keeps making my nose run so I unconsciously sniff it back. Plus my allergies are practically year round and terrible-my meds only really help for the spring time allergies, not winter. It’s gotten so bad that I threw up my food yesterday because it just sat in my throat. I also skipped the rest of my coffee this morning after that came up too. I know I’m not sick, I know when I’m sick and it’s just this symptom. But now I’m afraid to eat. I’ve tried working it up and spitting it out, swallowing it, making tea, a hot bath, and got robitussin DM but it’s not working. I’ve heard mucinex doesn’t work well, and I bought a nasal spray that I haven’t tried yet. Anybody have any advice for swallowing it? Or just getting rid of it?_

**Answer:**

I'm really sorry to hear you're dealing with this. It sounds super frustrating to have phlegm messing with your daily life, especially when you’re already managing allergies. Sometimes, unresolved stress can make these symptoms worse. The body might react when the mind faces a conflict it can't resolve.

It's possible that the phlegm is a way your body responds to emotional or environmental stress. Think about how a recurring or new stressor might be playing a part in this issue. Some kinds of stress can definitely challenge your system, especially if they're linked with a feeling of being ‘stuck’ or ‘choked up’ emotionally.

Here are a few questions to reflect on:

1. Have there been any recent changes or stressors in your life, especially with the holiday season coming?

2. Do you notice your symptoms flare up at specific times or around certain people or situations?

3. Are there any emotions you feel you’re holding back or not fully expressing?

4. What does the sensation of phlegm remind you of emotionally or mentally?

5. Do you feel a sense of conflict between obligations or expectations in your life?

I hope you find some relief soon. Feel free to ask more questions or share if anything comes to mind.",1,1763506892.0,mytorial,0,1.0,False
