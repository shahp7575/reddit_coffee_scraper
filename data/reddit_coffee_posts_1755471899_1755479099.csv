I am 22 and my name is Tiana and we have been living together for the past 3 months in the same apartment. Honestly these past 3 months have just been such a battle ground for the both of us and I honestly dont know why... Its as if together for us to work it just doesnt and I didnt know what to do!!! Ive see girls hitting on him and he puts them down as if he shot them out of the sky he honestly is the sweetest but things hadnt really spiced up in the bedroom! Its as if I was speaking to the universe because the other day I went to my local coffee shop and I saw my EX! My EX and I had like a month fling where we just had partied and had the absolute time of ours lives together but I ditched him after he cheated on me! We greeted each other and we were talking about how our lives have been shaping out and everything! He asked me if I was currently seeing anyone in which I replied yes and started to just tell him about him not pleasing me sexually as my EX had previously. We continued to chat and he convinced be to go back to his and throw a party for the two of us which I happily inclined. Honestly it had been the best fuck I have had in over a year. Literally my cunt was melting in cum thats how much he fckin shot up inside of me! I went back home to my BF and he suspected nothing even after showering I still couldnt get rid of the stench of sex!

1mt80ce,https://i.redd.it/t9ih958sfojf1.jpeg,"$JOE is not just a coin ,it’s a Movement.","
Why u should checkout $JOE on Solana.

$JOE doesn’t promise the moon or Mars, but something even more powerful relatability .

1. $JOE Represents Everyone

We all know a Joe -your neighbor, your coworker, your gym buddy, your uncle at the BBQ. Joe is the guy who works hard, cracks jokes, pays bills, and dreams big. He’s not flashy, but he’s real.

$JOE was made to represent the everyday hero - the 9-to-5 grinder, the coffee addict, the dreamer, the doer, the underdog. By owning $JOE, you’re not betting on a corporation or an elite .you’re investing in the idea that ordinary people matter.

2. It’s More Than a Coin ,It’s a Movement.

Memecoins have rewritten the rules of finance, culture, and community. From Doge to Pepe, the power of memes has shown us that community is above everything.

$JOE is the next evolution. It’s not about worshiping a dog or chasing hype .it’s about celebrating us. The community is made of real people, building something fun, inclusive, and real.

When you buy $JOE, you’re not just holding a coin ,you’re part of a movement where every average Joe has a voice.


3.Simple, Honest, Real

$JOE isn’t trying to be your financial overlord. There’s no overcomplicated whitepaper or false promises. It’s as straightforward as the guy it’s named after: no fluff, no scammy nonsense, just a memecoin that’s fun, honest, and easy to get behind.

And in a space full of rug pulls and vaporware, that kind of honesty is rare.

4.Early Days = Big Potential

We’re still early. $JOE is just getting started. The community is growing, memes are flying, and momentum is building. Remember when everyone laughed at Dogecoin? Or missed the Shiba wave?
Don’t sleep on Joe. 
This might be the most down-to-earth coin on the market, but its potential? Anything but average.


Everyone’s chasing the next big thing. But sometimes the biggest thing is the one right in front of us: the average, hardworking, humble guy who shows up every day.

That’s Joe. That’s $JOE.
And that’s why it just might be the smartest coin you ever bought.

Buy $JOE. Be a part of the everyman revolution.
Because sometimes, the most powerful thing you can be is yourself.

Just an Average Joe is a community-driven Solana meme coin. We have over 1,700 community members on X, including a Chinese community. The CTO team is being led by one of the members who previously led the $Neiro on eth CTO team.

1mt7v8t,https://www.reddit.com/r/Biohackers/comments/1mt7v8t/reduce_coffee_jitters_with_an_extra_extraction/,Reduce Coffee jitters with an extra extraction step,"Salute, I've done a few basic extractions of THC and psilocybin before. So when a poster on this subreddit asked about coffee brewing methods and mentioned all the different types of active chemicals, it made me think!

And so I bring you N=1  knowledge that is easily backed up if you simply...try it!

**The Facts** \- Coffee has more than just ""caffeine"". Most people I've read online agree that 'pure' caffeine alone has less 'jitter' than cheap coffee.

The Hypothesis - Better brewing reduces the amount of bitter and undesirable chemicals in coffee.

**THE INNOVATION -**

After making decent coffee - preferably not in a machine !  
Then you freeze it!

I have noticed that the bottom of the ice cube trays has a collection of thicker sludgy material. The upper portion of the ice is smooth and light brown.

Essentially, by fr*eez*ing the coffee, you're forcing some stuff to precipitate or settle out.

Final notes -

My partner doesn't like the taste of coffee, **however she thinks it tastes pleasant after doing the extra extraction step.**

She is a confirmed cilantro-soap-gene bearer, so I trust her supertaster senses.

Alright, if you have the ability to test further, have at it.

Otherwise, this is a small biohack that gives me a more controlled 'high' from coffee. It's smoother, less jittery, and I feel like I don't need as much to get the effect I want.

I strongly feel that freezing the coffee after brewing an already 'above average' cup  was a strong enough innovation to bring to you, r/Biohackers. (It's something people do every day, so it is a potential huge change).

Also, you can now prep the coffee the night before, which might be useful for some.

Its simple, but so many people drink coffee and i believe I have heard a LOT of discussion about the different substances that go into coffee. This is an easy way for \*YOU\* to see if this changes how coffee affects you.

I’m a 9–5 engineer who accidentally picked up a second job… my own game :D. For the last two years I’ve been pouring nights, weekends, and way too much coffee into a 2D MMORPG called **Definya**. Think old-school SNES pixels, but with a cozy-meets-chaotic twist.

This started as “let me prototype something I’d want to play,” and turned into a full pivot after a few painful playtests and a couple of 3 a.m. bug hunts where I stared at packet logs like they were tea leaves.

 Now it’s aiming for a **farming x MMORPG** mashup:

# What’s the actual hook?

* **Be a farmer** ***or*** **an adventurer (or swap anytime).** Chill on your land, grow stuff, supply the player market… or grab a sword and dive into dungeons.

* **Crafting-first progression.** NPCs sell the basics and use **dynamic pricing based on demand**; the good gear is crafted or traded **P2P**.

* **Two factions, classic classes, unique passives.** Life Bringers (humans/dwarves/elves) vs. Shadow Walkers (orcs/minotaurs/humans). Classes: warrior, berserker, sorcerer, druid, rogue. Passives like rogues dual-wielding daggers, berserkers dual-wielding axes, mages with juiced mana regen.

* **Skills inspired by UO.** Crafting (mining, lumberjacking, fishing, cooking). Combat (club, sword, dagger, distance, magic). Plus attributes (STR, RES, DEX, Magic, Magic RES). 

https://preview.redd.it/2anqncywdojf1.png?width=814&format=png&auto=webp&s=d08ebc26e0a35920ecf51d607cb5cd82574f579a

* **Open world + PvP** with newbie protection to lvl 14 and a skull system to keep ganks in check.
* **Modes for pain tolerance:** *Soft* (no death penalty, -20% XP), *Hardcore* (loot drop chance, +20–30% XP), *Permadeath* (+80% XP buff if you like living dangerously).
* **Gem socketing** for items → rare gems add stats/effects. Lots of build tinkering.

* **Anti-macro** in place because… yeah, people will try all the time.

# What I’d love feedback on

* **Onboarding:** does the early game explain itself without a wiki?
* **Economy:** farming→crafting→market loop—does it feel rewarding or like a chore? Any obvious inflation/hoarding exploits?
* **Balance:** low/mid-level PvE and PvP feel; class passives too spicy/too bland?
* **Pacing:** XP rates across Soft/Hardcore/Permadeath—fun vs. grind.
* **Netcode/perf:** any desync or lag spikes in crowded areas?
* **UX**: menus/tooltips/inventory clarity (it’s very WIP).

1mt7tpf,https://www.reddit.com/r/pourover/comments/1mt7tpf/beginners_luck_expired_please_help_bring_my_cup/,Beginner's luck expired: please help bring my cup back (Hario Switch),"I’ve been making espresso at home for a few years now, and recently decided to step into the world of pour overs.

I knew close to nothing, I’ve never ordered one, but wanted to see what the fuss was about. After some research, I purchased a Hario Switch.

I’ve had it for just over a week now and was immediately taken by the great results, which for the last couple of days have gone sideways.

I’ve been using this technique since it was described as consistent and beginner friendly:

[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=blQsogeBG7M](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=blQsogeBG7M)

The results at the start were great and kept getting better until they suddenly fell off completely. So clearly there was some beginner’s luck involved, but because I’m only starting out, it’s still quite difficult to pinpoint what I should try changing based on the flavour/result. I know this takes some practice, as was the case for me with espresso, but hopefully you will be able to shed some light.

Here are all the batches I’ve made as accurately as I can remember:

Recipe overall

* 15g coffee
* 50g water cold (70-ish C) infusion
* then 100g water (92-ish C) x2 for 1/1.5 minutes each

**#1** The result was incredible. Lots of aroma and flavour, some bitterness but still sweet. overall a very enjoyable cup and it really got me quite excited to keep going. A real palate-opener, unlike anything I had tried before, and gave me a pretty good picture of what this world is all about. Given it was the first time making it, I was scrambling around a lot, not being able to be much in control of time.

**#2** I ground a little bit finer and tried to keep everything else the same. Result was slightly sour, but still some sweetness, more chalky than first cup.

**#3** Went back to original grind size. Another very good cup for me, slightly chalky, but very pleasant and durable aftertaste.

**#4** By this point I was scrambling less as I got used to the technique. However my scale/timer ran out of battery in the middle of the first 100g water pour, so I had to eye it out . . . . and of course, this was the best cup of them all. Sweet, blueberry and chocolate highway all the way, no sourness or chalkiness. Nose for days and aftertaste felt very balanced and more-ish. Truly, truly amazing.

**#5** This is where it all started to go south. A watery, very bland cup. Not enjoyable. No excess of bitterness, some sourness, but just incredibly bland. No flavours, almost no hint of the aromas. Chocolate notes almost nowhere to be found in the nose. Absolutely nothing in the flavour. Not enjoyable at all.

**#6** & **#7** same. bland bland cups. #6 was awful so I did #7 straight after. I managed to get a little bit more body out of it, but still, just not really pleasant.

So my beginner’s luck has clearly run out.

Because I was scrambling for the first few pours, it’s hard to know what variable started affecting.

I can say this, however, the first few cups felt like I was taking ages to get anything done, like the clock was chasing me and I was overshooting the guideline mark each time. Maybe I was unintentionally agitating the bed a bit more? this is total speculation.

The last few brews (all bad) I felt incredibly in control. Like I knew what I was doing and had time to spare between each pour. Calm and collected.

As I said, I still don’t know how each variable affects what in terms of the cup/flavor. And before i try any other technique / recipe (like regular v60 style) I want to take this opportunity to learn and try to bring it back to the great results I was getting at first.

The beans I have are fantastic and have been well kept, so I doubt there’s anything there.

Cup **#4** that I had to pour by eye only, I feel that if anything I undershot the 100g pours by a bit, not overshot. But still, I don’t know how much attention to pay to that since the previous cups were getting to the measure exactly and were good.

Maybe it’s the time? Because I know the motions now I’m rushing? But again, hard to measure compared to first times where I was kind of all over

Any advice or ideas? I dunno where to start chasing the variables since I was not in too much control for the first cups and unable to remember exactly how I was haphazardly doing what each  time.",2,1755478287.0,pourover,0,1.0,False

However, his new office neighbor, a bright and inviting English professor named Ezra Fell, may be about to upset all of Crowley’s carefully-laid plans.

**Chapter 7 summary**: Crowley goes cruising. Ezra goes to London. 

**Chapter 7 excerpt**:

>After sitting, he stared down at the black mirror of coffee in his mug and frowned at his reflection. *If she can see it,* he thought, stomach tightening, *and presumably Maggie can see it, then–fuck, can Ezra see it?*

>He found he didn’t want to dwell on that too much.

**Chapter 8 summary**: Crowley makes some friends. Ezra makes a phone call.

**Chapter 8 excerpt**:

>His heart was still pounding, doing a funny painful tapdance in his chest. He bit down on his tongue, hard, until the panic receded. This was not the reunion he’d been hoping for.

Server brought the drinks, never refilled once and bussed our plates when we finished. Seeing as how we got our own food and the drinks were never refilled I had no reservations only leaving $10 on $125 bill. We were there for less than an hour, too. 

I’m sorry but I think having to tip for a serve yourself brunch buffet that’s priced like that is such bullshit. But I felt bad for the girl waiting on us as I figured she was getting $2.13 an hour. 

How you can’t take the revenue from buffet food priced like that plus all the brunch booze you know they sling and afford to pay your staff at least $20/hour and not resort to your customers subsidizing your waitstaff is beyond me. Buffet food PRINTS money.

It blows my mind how many people do that on Reddit. I’m saying this to help people who might make use of this like I do. 


It’s mind numbingly easy and insanely cheap making your own full spectrum extracts. No cooking needed or anything special. Literally 0 effort and works great.

- **Here’s how —>** Please read this because everyone should know this. Sometimes having a little bit of extract on hand is good for certain things, like after getting a root canal or something where you don’t want to drink a bunch of powder or make tea every time. Just for those few times you might need it.

- Get a couple big bottles (1750 mL) of the cheapest vodka you can find. Its $10-15 where I’m at.

- Get 1-2 $55 Kilos of Kratom powder of the strains you want. My vendor has those, great quality and free 2-5 day shipping over $99. I get 2 at a time to waive the shipping fee.


- 1.) Fill jars with kratom

- 2.) Fill up the jars with cheap vodka

- 3.) Shake 1x every 1-2 days for 4 weeks (Leave them in a dark closet or garage).

- 4.) Strain out with coffee filters or fine mesh tool. You can get fine mesh metal screens online too if you don’t want to use a coffee filter.

- 5.) Put the Liquid alcohol/kratom extract in other jars, or a big glass bowl (don’t worry it doesn’t stain your bowl 👍 

- 6.) Leave uncovered for 7 days in the dark, in the closet or somewhere like that. The alcohol evaporates naturally.

Put small fan blowing near the extract bowl/jars to speed up the drying process if you want. Not necessary though.

7.) BOOM! Now you’re left with a bunch of dry, crumbly extract, and now you can dose accordingly.

8.) To calculate dosage, do basic math. If you started with 1 Kilo (1000 grams) and end up with 100 grams extract, you have a 10x extract. Dose accordingly. Etc etc etc. Whatever that number is.

—— Extra Info —>> (OPTIONAL)

If you leave these jars in a warmer environment, or a place that has natural sunlight (not direct light), or **both**, some of the Mitragynine will convert into 7-OH naturally, and your extract will be more sedating.

If left in the dark, in a cooler area, the Mitragynine won’t convert into 7-OH.

You can always evaporate 90% of the alcohol, and leave the extract with a little liquid left in it, to keep it as a liquid, and put that in dropper bottles if you want. To calculate dosage with that route, it’s a little different. I won’t get into that right now though.

You can choose which way you want to go with this. The effects vary due to the environment your extract is made in, and the Vein Color you start with.",8,1755477598.0,KratomKorner,0,1.0,False

Over the last few years, I have travelled some of the tea-drinking world and want to announce that you can be a man and enjoy it too. 

Here are my rankings of certain brands and varieties in order of how much I like them. 

Please comment and contribute any that are of a similar palette.

* Rize cay - This is the official tea of Turkey or something and my favorite. Apparently the eponymous coffee used to be more widely preferred by Turks but during the sick old man days of the Ottoman empire, it became to expensive to put the squeeze on the newly non-ottoman Yemenis, so they created a system of domestic production and this is the result. I love the cafes in istanbul where you can sit  outside and drink this stuff for only a few lira a glass. Incredible with cardamom, sugar or by itself. 
* Moroccan mint tea - This is technically a mix of teas but it is my second favorite. The mint compliments the smoky green tea in a way that is both refreshing and energizing. Very good.
* Alwazah Ceylon Tea- I had this brand at a middle eastern restaurant and it quickly became one of my favorites. It has a more citrus-y floral taste than many black teas and is not overpowering. Very good with food.
* Azercay- The Rize cay of Azerbaijan. This seems to be a go-to in much of the post-soviet world. It is similar in taste to Rize cay but somewhat more mild in flavor and can become bitter. It is very drinkable but not my favorite. 

I have tried some chinese and japanese teas like Oolong, gunpowder, and sencha and found them to be more gross. Yerba mate tastes terrible but has a very pleasant, mellow effect. Jasmine tea is pretty good also.",6,1755477514.0,rs_x,0,1.0,False

Yesterday was an annual neighborhood event where bands set up in front yards and you can go around to watch dozens of shows, and I was only able to go to one performance, for like 30 minutes, before I got too tired and needed to go home. 

I live in a neighborhood where normally I'm able to walk to the grocery store, coffee shop, hardware store, etc whenever I need anything. Not being able to walk or carry things sucks. 

If I had a wheelchair I could at least have someone push me around to go to the park or the store, but instead I'm stuck at home until I'm feeling stronger. 

I'm grateful to have people at home taking care of me (2 out of 3 are even CNAs, so taking care of the disabled is literally their job). But I'm frustrated that I even need the help.

1mt7hlx,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1mt7hlx,First Solo Bikepacking Attempt – 30 Miles to Mirror Lake (Alaska),"I set out on my first solo bikepacking overnight this week. The plan was to ride out to Eklutna Lake, camp overnight, and ride back the next morning. It didn’t go quite as planned, but I still consider it a success and a great shakedown.

**Route & Mileage:**

* Started in the Anchorage area, with a couple of morale stops along the way (coffee, lunch at Chepo’s in Eagle River, more coffee at Jitters).
* Continued north toward Peters Creek.
* Ended up logging about **30 miles total**.

**Mirror Lake:**  
I decided not to attempt the Eklutna climb this time — instead, I diverted to Mirror Lake. It turned out to be a beautiful choice. Made friends with some ducks, soaked up the evening light, and met up with a few friends to enjoy the last of the day. They ended up giving me a ride home, which felt like the right call since I was pretty spent.

**Takeaways & Wins:**

* Got my first 30 miles with a loaded setup.
* Tested my gear and fueling strategy.
* Learned how the bike feels fully packed.
* Practiced pacing and snack timing.
* Confirmed that bail-outs are part of the game plan and not a failure.

**What’s Next:**  
Didn’t camp this time, but next ride the goal is to actually stay out overnight. Feeling good about the progress and looking forward to building from here.",14,1755477340.0,bikepacking,0,1.0,False

At least until I found my way to prepare tea. I want to share it, since it might help someone else, but also I am interested to know if someone is doing like me.

No I prepare tea like ""an instant coffee"", meaning I heat up some water, but stops very quick. Maybe around 50˚C, not more. I put my tea bag in the water and stir a bit, for maybe 20 seconds (like someone would do with instant coffee). That's it.

I use normal black tea. It gives a slightly warm but not much tea. Light tea. Of course it doesn't have a strong taste, but for some reason I can't understand, it brings me what I need. It is a bit bitter, more taste than a herbal tea. Despite it is not as bitter or strong than coffee, it lures my brain and taste. I love it so much.

1mt7bej,https://www.reddit.com/r/creepcast/comments/1mt7bej/adwfh_2/,ADwfH 2,"  It was midnight. December 5th, the next date to be crossed off the calendar. I looked over the maps of the local area, now wrinkled and torn, stained with ash and coffee. The maps didn’t move no matter how long I stared or how many times I stared at them, racking my brain for the answer I felt was almost in my grasp.

Missing persons cases are all too common in major cities. Most here are just runaway kids found within a couple hours happy to be back with their parents. Actual detective work is an oddity. Most cases are ‘solved’ as quickly as possible for the department to save face, and closed very quickly, whether I wanted to or not. I learned this the hard way on my first day. 

It was 15 years ago I transferred from a prestigious police academy in upstate Connecticut to here fresh faced and naive, I was greeted only by three dusty boxes of files and one specimen piled on my desk, making the cheap plastic bow a little bit. I got no formal introduction or welcome, nobody even acknowledged my existence at this point, I shrugged, “So much for southern hospitality.” I guess someone heard me as I found a rotten egg under my chair the next day. 

After several years of signing papers, and saving cats, most came to tolerate me. 
After several more and getting adept at small town politics most ignored me all together. 
After cashing in a few ‘favors’ with the sheriff and mayor going through two new paper shredders I got my own office.
Currently I am more or less accepted by the townsfolk and very few see me as one of their own.

It’s not normal to take anonymous tips about ‘solved’ cases, especially cases from 15 years ago, and since my number wasn’t public and I had only given it to three people I was understandably worried. They addressed me by my full legal name saying what they were to share “It was the key to everything” and “this was for you only no one else knows.” I should have hung up there, I had the primal urge to slam the phone down, to run away screaming or to hide. I had some small voice in the back of my mind that listened, as a real detective I needed the truth, this could be my breakthrough, I could finally solve a real case and become the hero, and finally get out of here to someplace that mattered. My ego swelled, my pride was enormous. So I listened. Anyone else would have hung up, but they were nobody, only I had the curiosity to know the truth and a desire to fit the secrets of the universe together like a puzzle, daring to look at truth in its entirety. Since when did following protocol ever solve anything. 

I wrote it down on a scrap of paper conveniently nearby. I had scrawled it so hastily anyone else couldn’t read it and hid it in my pocket.

‘It made no sense to me at the time, I wish it still didn’t .’

Dragging the now even dustier and slightly damp three boxes of files to my desk to my office, thankful the other officers having gone home hours ago. I was reminded of my first day going through these files just the same way.

This case had few witnesses and even fewer leads from the beginning. Open and shut in less than 24 hours once they finally located the body and the only suspect, still behind bars, was charged.
I closed the blinds, drew the curtains, locked the door. Wiping the smudges off my glasses, lighting a smoke, I grabbed the first paper as last time. 
The document was an officers written report, responding to a call of a break in. “En route to the scene my patrol car experienced two flat tires suddenly and simultaneously with two loud bangs. As I was already close to the call I walked the rest of the way on foot.”

Attached: an inspection and bill from a local mechanic showed no flat tires or tire replacement ever took place, only that two small animal carcasses were removed from somewhere near the axles, with full axle replacement. 
Scrawled on the back of the bill in my handwriting ’When I had pressed further on the issue, the mechanic refused to comment.’

“Arriving at the residence took 10 minutes by foot as the main driveway was obstructed by the overgrowth of weeds vines and several fallen trees. Though there was a narrow footpath and a mailbox with the address. I soon arrived at a dilapidated and seemingly abandoned property. Cautiously, I walked the perimeter of the clearing noting the front door was boarded up, but a side door also boarded up, had a large square hole cut into the bottom of it, marked in a viscous red substance I thought to be blood.”

Lab reports of the substance showed no DNA match to the suspect and even now I don’t know who it belonged to, only that it was a 95% positive match for human blood and that it was diluted and mixed with tree sap. Evidence of a possible third party but nothing conclusive. I previously forwarded the sample to be referenced with current national and international DNA databases looking for any new leads, submitting it for review to my chief as per protocol. I found the burnt remains of that proposal with the last of the substance missing the next day.

“After seeing the blood I radioed in for immediate backup to the station asking for any and all nearby units and for medical. Even though road into the lot was blocked with overgrowth and trees. I was instructed to enter the building by any means necessary, I drew my weapon and a pen light I had in my pocket I approached the side door.”

Attached: a two photographs of the side door and one of the officers pen light. On the outside, the door showing pristine white paint in the shape of wooden boards. The rest of the door was dirty, paint chipped and streaked, the boards themselves were found on the ground broken in half. The substance looked dried at that point, it was shiny and had a deep vibrant red hue conveyed even in the black and white photo. The hole itself was unremarkable, square two feet by two feet, it seems the previous investigators only took a picture a sample of the substance and moved on. On the inside of the door however, surrounding the hole was covered in large and deep gouge marks. The marring showing brighter and clean wood newer than anything else shown in the photos. I had assumed signs of an animal, marking it with ‘possum’ or ‘badger?’.
Returning to the first photo, on the outside of the door a notice to vacate. I traced that same form to a small town on the outskirts of Mexico just over the border, the only difference  being their form is entirely in Spanish and this one entirely in English. Considering I needed an interpreter the entire time I contacted them, I had dismissed this lead entirely.

I reached over dialing the same number as 15 years ago.

*Ring*

*Ring*

*Ring*

     “Lo lamentamos, pero el número que ha llamado no está disponible.”

I tried the number 5 more times each with the same result. “That’s not good.” I had expected to not get any further than last time, retreading old ground. However getting stopped in my tracks was concerning. I continued on.

The penlight seemed normal, just old. It was the officers personal light, I was confused as to why it was even included here. It was mentioned sure, but it didn’t seem relevant. It had seemed like some mistake, some rookie getting excited and taking pictures of anything not just evidence, I reached down into my desk picking up a cup full of pens and finding that same pen light I had innocuously pocketed so many years ago. I read the writing, now faded on it ‘Psalm 90:1-2.’ That was it, no church name, no phone number, not even a cross. Just two verses, I clicked the pen a few times, a weak light emitting forth, I set down the pen and put the cup back.

“I tried the door, boarded shut, I heard crying, weeping. I screamed ‘POLICE, OPEN UP’. A slight scream, not from inside, but  from the hole. I got down on my knees, peering in revolver first. I saw a tunnel reaching 2 maybe 3 feet inside seemed to be a tightly packed dirt smooth and cylindrical.”

I turned back ‘What?’ I thought, confused. I had no recollection of any tunnel, though my memory of the case and all its evidence seemed very clear to me even now.
“Why would there be a tunnel inside.”

I looked back at the photographs
The first photograph had changed, where once white pristine streaks marked the door, evidence of boards being removed, the ENTIRE door was caked in dirt. It seemingly spread before my eyes, mud seeping down slowly but surely into the hole before my eyes.

I rubbed my eyes thinking myself insane. I promptly got up, brewed a pot of coffee, thumbing the pen light twirling in my fingers waiting.
After some time, feeling refreshed with some Joe, I sat back down.

The door was still dirty, maybe it always had been.

“After entering the building I found the suspect, older male, white, bleeding profusely from neck. I administered first aid, detaining him, and called in urgently calling for an ambulance IMMEDIATELY. I moved him outside, I went backwards through the hole, dragging him through, waiting for help. My radio told me the ambulance was minutes away, 5 minutes, waiting reporting the condition to whatever was talking to me, 3 minutes, I reapplied pressure, 30 seconds, I could hear sirens, sirens so loud it like they were trumpets going off inside me.”

Attached: a note describing police radio transmissions show no sign of the officers request for backup or medical services were ever received. Though logs show his radio did send and receive transmission during estimated times lining up with the officers statement. The officer passed a polygraph test and testified under oath that not only did he communicate in line with his statements but he whoever answered him back perfectly replicated multiple local dispatchers. Being under warranty, the radios manufacture inspected the unit and came to the conclusion that both the devices transmitter and receiver malfunctioned, operating on incorrect unknown frequencies. It was officially determined after some time, the answers he received was a combination of interference from other channels and the own officers heat derived delirium.

“After no further radio response or anyone arriving deciding to take action, I carried the suspect back to the main road, catching caught a ride from a local back to the station.”

Ending the written statement was his signature and the date 06/07.

Farmer Brown was eventually located and questioned as to his account of how he found the officer. 

“Well I saw his car really or all the mess he had made leading to his car. Two thick tracks of clumped up flesh and dirt dragged probably a quarter mile, lord knows what he hit.”

Finding the car abandoned, he called in the car to the station and was told by the operator to stay at the car and keep a lookout. After 10 minutes the officer and the suspect had appeared, seemingly from nowhere and taken to the hospital.


After the initial report, a listing of a search party and of what areas to search was named down with an attached map. Sixteen officers, two ambulances, a fire truck, two helicopters, a game warden, and 73 local residents had apparently shown up to comb the woods near the squad car to find the shack. 

It took them two days, 10 miles from the car with no discernible driveway or footpaths, it appeared on no map and wasn’t recognized by any local government as being built. Rechecking the sign on the door was the same, a notice to vacate from the city written in full english was noted and signed by official Spanish government markings though they had no record of this.

I sat down the page, leaving a bookmark in the stack, fat and red. Putting up the files and loaded them in my car. It was morning at this point. The light streaming through the blinds. I was dead tired and being certain I had plenty of time to comb through this, I decided to drag work home with me.

1mt76az,https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/1mt76az/the_zombie_that_follows_me/,The Zombie That Follows Me,"Hey,

There's something that's been bothering me and you're the only one I feel like listens; even though you only respond when it involves my new girlfriend... anyways about a week now I can't SEEM to walk to work without this guy bumping into me. Just an ordinary suit and tie business guy (eh see what I did there?).  He acts like he's on the Bluetooth headset adorning his stupid ear, talking to some entity on the other end of the line, but I SWEAR his eyes don't break contact until he runs into me. 

Everyday is something new, a bagel splattered into my shirt, a coffee that can't drift away from my pants, or a casual shoulder check. Am I crazy?? Is he trying to get a rise out of me? I asked Sarah about it and she just thinks it's my chest that stands out like when we go out to the bar and every guy hounds me like a puppy wanting a treat. That doesn't explain the piercing eyes that stare into my soul as he casually finds a way to ruin my short commute. 

Today it was different. He stared at the ground, as if some kind of guilt was consuming him. No headset, no suit, just another cis gendered white dude taking up the sidewalk. I felt bad and stopped him. He murmured a plethora of words that didn't make sense except the part where he finally said sorry, but it was more like he was just sorry for existing in that moment. I said thanks and headed to the brew house like any other day, thinking that was the end of it.

Fast forward to the middle of my shift the dude stumbles through the door, Sarah might have been onto something, this dude walk up to the counter and is just staring at me as if I was a rack of ribs at a BBQ eating contest. I didn't notice it before so maybe I was overthinking. He ordered a coffee and bagel breakfast (classic) and tipped me some weird coins and sat in a booth that had the slightest view of where I stand behind my safety net of beers and patrons that at least tip big for staring. 

Walking home I couldn't help but think about the dude and all the possibilities of why he could've been fired. I flipped his coins listening with my air pods to the tune of the backseat lover, until I dropped the damn thing, it rolled down the concrete up to guess who the same dumb guy. 

Taking the opportunity of a lifetime I asked him how he got fired or if he quit. My money was on an HR complaint or something. Like always he just stared at me, but not my breast, or my eyes, just staring hard. I asked again, ""Hey so whaddya doin out on the streets?""

Shaking his head he said the most jarring thing. ""My coworkers wouldn't let me mooch of of them anymore and I'm the only one left."" 

*The only one left?* It must have been some small firm if they closed up within the few months of me moving here. I bet he's just another sexual harassment case. 

Wouldn't you know it he grabbed for me; luckily I've been carrying my pepper spray and he got a mouthful, eyeful, face full. I ran without looking back. Taking a few roundabout streets to make sure he couldn't follow me. 

When I got back to the apartment I share with Sarah, she was standing outside. She kept asking where I was  and kept going on and on about me cheating. Just cause I did it with her doesn't mean I'd do it again (sorry). The horror in my eyes shut her up quick, coming up the other end of the sidewalk was my red faced victim looking even more worse for wear. I didn't remember hitting him but the dude looked worse than the first guy in the 100 vs 1 gorilla match. I tossed his coin towards him and some sensibility returned to his hyper focused shuffle. Some business men never let go of their money like they say. Sarah, and I ran inside and called the cops. 

I've just been typing this to you and listening to the slow beating on our door while we wait. Hopefully, they come soon he won't stop grumbling about how he just needs some more meat. I get it my body has been a walking object of desire ever since puberty, but this is some next level freak shit. Sarah has been doubling down about how I'm some sort of affair heifer. Cow references yay it's not like I chose to be born like this. 

I hope this finds you well and you feel some sort of relief that my life has been crazy and my new partner has grown suspicious of me just like you did. Maybe it's karma or something. I still love you Steph <3 ",5,1755476461.0,nosleep,0,1.0,False
1mt75mc,https://www.reddit.com/r/MuslimMarriage/comments/1mt75mc/her_father_refused_to_take_his_daughter_hand_for/,Her father refused to take his daughter hand for marriage.,"I have a genuine question because a 
potentials dad refused to speak to me on the phone regarding his daughter hand for marriage. Is this common in most households to only marry their own?

She said 2 years ago her dad tried to get her married to someone she didn’t know at all besides a few awkward conversations but she just couldn’t do it and fell into a deep depression. It got worse and her mental health was effected badly so her dad said next time you choose


So after a while she got back on her feet and what are the odds of us seeing each other at the airport for the first time going different countries then both coming back on the same day seeing each other at Heathrow airport then after 3 weeks seeing each other costa coffee lol I had to follow the signs and speak to her. She acknowledged me and was very shy and giggly because she found it weird how we keep seeing each other. Anyway I got her number and from there we started speaking. We didn’t want to waste any time as men and women can’t be friends so I asked for her dads number, she said she will give it to me but first she will ask his permission, she got back to me and he agreed that’s when I called him.


I greeted him with a warm Salam and told him he raised an amazing daughter and I aspire to be like him with my future daughter he was slightly rude but I hear him it’s his baby girl i guess anyway, he asked me a lot of questions and I answered everything respectfully even calling him dad but once he found out I wasn’t Asian he cut the phone on me. I guess his daughter didn’t mention that part


She called me back 5 days later and said she has been crying herself to sleep every night and how her dad said she can never choose again and she cannot get married to me whatsoever even though she told him she’s happy with me, she said on the phone there’s no point in us speaking now because we will fall into Zina, what a pious women. I instantly respected her decision and didn’t tell her to fight for us or anything 



It hurt me to let go but I did and we haven’t spoke in a long time. I haven’t even seen her since the last time and sometimes i even hope to bump into her but I guess since our fate was sealed there was no need to see each other again


It’s interesting how you can’t manipulate the heart or gas light yourself, I’m not being egotistical but mashallah I am handsome, tall and ripped. I take care of myself well and I prioritise Allah. I’ve never drank alcohol, nor done drugs. My mum programmed me to stay away from them as it’s the devils poison that stayed with me despite my environment and surroundings. I have a sharp disciplined mind which I can easily find another sister if Allah willed, my sisters friend is attracted to me and she’s pretty mashallah but truth be told I only want her, the one who I believed was sent to me and thought she was my soul mate but I guess her dad is her dad. 

Arranged marriage doesn’t make sense to me at all but it is what it is

1mt75dr,https://www.reddit.com/r/globalinvestorlife/comments/1mt75dr/from_cubicle_to_sea_breeze/,From Cubicle to Sea Breeze..,"From Office Cubicle to Island Bliss: How One Man Found His Retirement Upgrade in the Philippines



When John turned 58, the walls of his small apartment in Ohio felt tighter than ever. Years of routine—work, commute, repeat—had left him with savings but little joy. He wasn’t broke, but the idea of retiring in the U.S. on a modest pension filled him with dread. Bills, medical costs, and the creeping sense that life was slipping away made him restless.



One night, while scrolling through forums, he stumbled across something unexpected: a retirement visa program in Southeast Asia. At first, he laughed it off. Moving halfway across the world? Too risky. Too far. But the more he read, the more it sounded like a golden ticket. The Philippines in particular stood out—not just for its English-speaking locals and low cost of living, but because of the visa that allowed retirees to settle comfortably with relative ease.



John did his research. He learned the visa gave long-term security without the headache of constant renewals. Healthcare options were better than he expected, with modern hospitals in major cities and affordable insurance plans. More importantly, the numbers worked. His modest pension, which barely covered rent back home, could stretch into a lifestyle he never imagined possible.



So, he took the leap.



Fast forward eighteen months, and John now lives in a remote coastal province where the pace of life is slow and the scenery looks like a postcard. His modest budget bought him a spacious home with a balcony overlooking turquoise waters—a home that would have been unimaginable in the U.S. He wakes up to the sound of waves and spends mornings at the local market, where fresh mangoes cost less than a cup of coffee back home.



The upgrade in lifestyle isn’t just about the view. John’s health has improved from daily swims and fresh food. He’s built a new circle of friends—both locals who welcomed him with warmth and fellow expats who share the same “escape story.” Social life is vibrant, not lonely. In fact, he’s more connected than ever, thanks to the Filipino culture of community.



Of course, there are challenges. Power cuts, spotty WiFi, and learning the quirks of island life took adjustment. But compared to the grind he left behind, those inconveniences barely register.



What strikes John most is the sense of freedom. Back in Ohio, retirement felt like the end of the road. In the Philippines, it feels like a fresh start. He has time to read, explore, and even dabble in small projects online for extra income. His days are no longer consumed by stress, but by choice.



When friends back home ask if he regrets moving, John just smiles. “I didn’t retire,” he says. “I upgraded.”

1mt74dt,https://www.reddit.com/r/exmormon/comments/1mt74dt/im_16_and_i_want_out/,I'm 16 and I want out," I grew up Mormon. My parents are mormon, My grandparents are mormon. And I've never believed. I’m writing this post two days after I've decided to leave but I’m only 16.

Disclaimer: I do not hate my parents. They are doing the best with the knowledge they have and I know that they love me and have good intentions. 

 My ward talks about how amazing their baptism was and how spiritual they felt bla bla bla. I didn't. I came up from the water and I felt nothing.

I've never understood the word of wisdom, mainly coffee and tea. (I get the alcohol thing just cause its terrible for your body and you can be in dangerous situations and not know anything). But tea is really good. I don't understand how blind obedience will get me into heaven.

When I got my temple recommend I went and did proxy baptisms and I felt nothing. I felt no spiritual joy and I just felt wet and awkward. I don't understand how in order for dead people to get salvation they need to be baptized through our church. I also don't get how we don't believe in baby baptisms because babies can't consent but dead people can?

I've spent years since my baptism figuring out things in the church (polygamy, sister wives, tithing) and I've been trying to rationalize it and push beyond it because that was what I was told to do. I have expressed multiple times how I don't feel anything in the church and how much I hate going to activities and firesides and FSY and my parents don't listen.

They think that this is something that perseverance can cure.

I think the straw that broke this camel's back was FSY. I have heart problems, POTS symptoms and heat intolerance and I’m also super introverted. I just got on meds a week ago so Im doing fine with that. But at FSY (when I wasn't on meds) we were in 90 degree heat and walking for 5-6 hours a day and the counselors wouldn't let us go back inside. We had 1.5 hours to rest in our dorms and after that it was time to go to dinner. And then for devotionals again and more scriptures. The entire week was torture. I was drinking so much water but I still felt like I was going to pass out. My heart was 170 bpm while walking which is abnormal even for me. I had to sit at nearly every activity and my feet hurt and I was dizzy the whole time. I went to the medics three times and they gave electrolyte water (it tasted like salty berries lol) and told me to rest. I've had this heart condition for a while so I know about electrolytes and resting but I COULDN'T REST. Our counselors made us play games, stand up for long periods of time, and walk at least five miles a day (I counted) so there was no time to relax and I was miserable. And when we were sitting we had a man teaching the Young Women's devotional. I was so angry and when I brought it up I just heard excuses like”oh it made me mad but what can you do it's not like we're in charge”. Guys. His wife was there the whole time and she couldn't teach the devotional???

Also I couldn't be alone. During that time I had bad stomach problems and I spent a few hours in the bathroom feeling like I was going to vomit and I couldn't be alone. I had to go with someone everywhere, to my dorm, to get food, to go to the bathroom. I was going crazy and I told my parents this before I went and they just shrugged it off.

 Okay i have one last story because it feels good to rant about this. My grandfather and I were talking (he's a very traditional MAGA guy. I lean conservative but I hate Trump) he sat me down and told me that all of my dreams for the future: career, houses, moving, kids would go down the drain once I met my husband. And that I would have to follow him around everywhere because he’s the man and I need to be a good wife. He told me that If I was a working mom I would realize that my duty was the home and the kids and that they would grow up without a mother. When I told him that the world was getting too expensive and that we couldn't afford it he told me that I just needed to rely on my husband and God would provide and that I could rely on my husband for retirement????!!! 

I was on this subreddit a few days ago and I came across a scripture that says God will never leave you or something to that effect and then it hit me. The church isn't true. I'm in a lie, my parents are in a lie and I can't leave. I've always had bad anxiety about leaving the church because I was scared I would be wrong but this fact that God would never leave us just erased it all. I know this church is wrong. This church hides things from their members and acts like its the one true church where you can find happiness and peace. And they're wrong. I have felt more peace in the last two days than I have in a long time. Probably ever. I know that this is the right decision.

Yesterday I went on a temple trip with my ward and I told myself that I wouldn't do anything. So I sat around the font and didn't do anything. I didn't get baptized. I didn't get confirmed. I just sat there and kept quiet. My mother was there as a driver and she came over to me and wanted me to do baptisms. I declined and she left it alone until the end. Around the end of the session she walked over and said ""Go get confirmed. You don't have to get baptized but just go get confirmed."" I told her no and when she pushed and asked why I said I'd tell her later. When we got out she asked me why and after some pushing I said ""I'm doing anything unless I believe in it. "" She asked me what I believe in and I said God (true) and that I didn't think that a loving god would make us do baptisms for the dead in order to receive salvation.

I'm also looking into other religions such as Catholicism which I was taught was the ""great and spacious building"" in Lehi's vision and I'm planning on going to mass for the first time tomorrow. Idk I feel better when I think about an all loving god and I've felt his love but not in the church. I know that when I leave I need a break from organized religion because I don't want to join another cult. I feel more agnostic but I'm scared that if I don't have a religion I'll be a terrible person.

They are also pushing for me to pay tithing. I have a really good savings account and I haven't paid tithing once. I have a high school checking and I don't know if they have access to it ( I use Chase Bank) and I don't know if they will pay tithing for me with my info. Should I get another account they don't have access to?

I'm looking for advice because I know that I'm going to leave the church. But I can't right now. I'm only sixteen, and I know that if I tell my parents that I want out they will make me keep going to things to beat the devil out of me or something. Should I keep quiet or should I tell them? How can I protect myself because I don't know what my parents will do?

Budget is what it costs within reason. Timemore 078S seems interesting. I read and watch reviews of the Niche Zero, and that sounds like the kind of coffee I want to drink, but seems old school. Like me. Ha! 

Flat burrs. Conical. Don't know, but I guess I need to care. Mazzer Philos? Rather not spend that, but..

My wife is a pour over girl. You mean I can have one grinder and adjust on the fly? Didn't know that was a thing. I'm in. 

Recommendations? And, where do I go for the lightly used grinder some geek is flipping cos the hottest new one is out? Yeah, I'll take your lightly used grinder that was hot last week

Edit:I realized after posting this the reason I entered this rabbithole in the first place was to.find a grinder that wouldn't wake up the house. I'd only upgrade for a quiet grinder. Seems I can only go one way in this regard. My mazzer makes a proper old school coffeeshop racket! My friend got a Eureka grinder that is so much quieter than mine! The other thing is I really like hospitality and customer service. Timemore seems a little hit or miss, and is honestly my biggest reservation with their grinder. Happy to be proven wrong.

You know those days when you're sitting at your desk, coffee in hand, and somehow you still feel like you're swimming through molasses? 🙈 Yeah, me too. But today? Today was different! Just one tiny tweak sent my focus soaring to new heights. 🚀

So what was *the* game-changer? Less social media scrolling and more... **music!** 🎶

Here's the deal: I switched my usual background noise (a.k.a. YouTube rabbit holes and endless tweets) for instrumental playlists. Suddenly, I could feel the fog lifting, and my brain felt less like a busy highway and more like a calm lake. 🌊

What tiny tweaks have you made that worked wonders? Here are a few ideas I’ve collected that might spark your own creativity:

- **Change your environment**: Sometimes, a new view can shift your mindset. Moving from your regular desk to the couch or even a café can bring a fresh perspective.
  
- **Set a timer**: Using the Pomodoro Technique (25 mins of work, 5 mins of break) helped me stay in the zone without burning out. Plus, those little breaks? Life-savers! ⏳

- **Wear headphones**: Even if you’re not listening to music, wearing headphones can signal to others (and your brain) that it’s time to focus. Instant productivity mode activated! 🎧

- **Hydrate like a champ**: I filled my water bottle and sipped throughout the day. Trust me, staying hydrated is *not* just for thirsty plants. 🌱

- **Jot it down**: Keep a mini notebook nearby. Whenever a thought pops into your head (especially the pesky ones that scream for attention), write it down and move on. Your brain will thank you later!

But enough about me—what’s YOUR tiny tweak? Was it something you did with your environment, a new habit, or maybe even something quirky that you thought only you would benefit from? Let’s share those golden nuggets of wisdom! ✨",1,1755475628.0,MaximizeMe,0,1.0,False

I took the Amtrak up from Fort Worth Thursday evening after work and stayed downtown at the Colcord Hotel (perfect location and great hotel). The Amtrak trip was great and pretty scenic compared to what I expected. Dropping some highlights below in case anyone needs walkable recs :

Friday
- Went for a morning run down in Scissortail park (fantastic!) and grabbed coffee/fantastic pastry at Jack’s Bakehouse downtown
- Worked from the hotel and walked over to Sun Cattle Company for lunch to try the Onion Burgers 
- walked around Bricktown and the riverwalk over to the Oklahoma territory memorial and then jumped on the very clean OKC streetcar and rode the loop around to see the city. 
- walked around downtown and grabbed dinner at Flint (decent chicken fried steak) 
- ended the night walking to Bricktown and seeing a movie (Weapons)

Saturday:
- Coffee from Clarity Coffee and a pastry from Gilded Acron
- Saw the OKC Memorial and Museum (beautifully done and tons of history)
- Took streetcar up to Midtown and walked around shops 
- Walked back downtown and had Bar Abolada’s burger (amazing)
- Myriad gardens 
- Dinner at Patrono’s (amazing….)
- Dessert and tea at Tellers to see the National 
- Walked through Scissortail park and stumbled upon one of the live concert series (perfect weather)

Sunday
- Hopped on the 8:00 Amtrak back to Fort Worth for an on-time and fantastic ride back. 

OKC, you’re awesome!! Quite easy to walk around, clean downtown with wonderful people.  Wish I had more time to see all the other great food recs from this thread and to see a few more museums/Paseo Arts. Will be back for sure. ",55,1755475409.0,okc,4,0.98,False

1mt6rrk,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1mt6rrk,My travel setup I have been using on roadtrips,"This is the setup I have been wanting to share for some time. I have been using it on several roadtrips around the country.

Brewer: **AeroPress -** I normally brew my coffees using a V60, but I find that for traveling there is nothing better than an AeroPress.

Grinder: **TIMEMORE Chestnut Nano** \- I love this little grinder. Made entirely of metal, it has a foldable handle, grinds exceptionally well. It can only grind very small batches, which is not a problem when using an AeroPress anyway. Only annoyance: because it's made of metal, whenever I go through security at the airport, they think it's a gun or something... so I usually take it out of the bag in advance.

Scale: **MAXUS Espresso Scale** \- There are a ton of these identical-looking scales on Amazon, it was very cheap around $12, when I tested it against my Hario, the measurements were identical, so it's good enough for me. I like that it is very compact, it has physical buttons and a hinged cover to prevent it from turning on while inside the bag; it even has a backlit LCD.

Water Heater (Outdoor): **PocketRocket** (or any camp stove) and an aluminum pot - I don't (usually) bring a thermometer with me while on the road, but I have learned to visually recognize when the water is *almost* at boiling temperature, by just looking at the little bubbles at the bottom of the pot.

Water Heater (Indoor): **Haspsso Portable** **Electric Kettle** \- I needed a way to reliably heat up water when staying in a Hotel or BnB, without getting to boiling temperature every time and I wanted something compact. I was very skeptical of this one when I saw it on Amazon, the posting looked really janky... but I tested it and it has been great. It has multiple temperature presets (I go between 175 and 195), very compact, the power cord fits inside, it pours surprisingly well despite not having any spouts.

Mugs: Any steel camping mug - While I do absolutely prefer the feel of ceramic mugs, when traveling it's a lot more convenient to use camping mugs, they are light-weight and you don't risk breaking them (guess how I know).",5,1755475320.0,pourover,1,1.0,False

Brewers
	•	Hario Switch (immersion / hybrid)
	•	Hario V60 Mugen & Standard V60
	•	Orea Z1
	•	AeroPress
	•	OXO 8-Cup Rapid Brewer

✅ Strengths: You’ve got almost every major brew style covered — immersion (Switch, AeroPress), percolation (V60s, Orea), hybrid (Switch), and automatic (OXO). This gives you incredible versatility for both daily convenience and precision brewing.

⚖️ Considerations: The only missing styles are espresso and syphon — not essential, but worth thinking about if you want to expand your skillset into pressure brewing or more experimental methods.

⸻

Grinders
	•	1Zpresso ZP6 (clarity-focused)
	•	1Zpresso K-Ultra (versatile, excellent for filter and immersion)

✅ Strengths: Both grinders are top-tier hand grinders. ZP6 will maximize clarity for light roasts and pour-over, while K-Ultra balances clarity with body and works across brew methods. You’ve covered precision and flexibility.

⚖️ Considerations: Hand grinders require effort for larger brews (like OXO batches). If you brew multiple cups daily, a flat-burr electric grinder (e.g., Fellow Ode Gen 2, Option-O, Lagom) could save time and deliver consistency at scale.

⸻

Scales & Measurement
	•	Hario Scale (basic, integrated timer)
	•	DiFluid Microbalance (high precision, app support)
	•	DiFluid R2 Refractometer (TDS, EY measurement)

✅ Strengths: This setup puts you in the top few percent of home brewers — you can measure brew strength, track extraction yield, and dial in recipes with data-backed precision.

⚖️ Considerations: None — this is a dream-tier measurement setup.

⸻

Kettle & Water
	•	OXO Gooseneck with Temp Control
	•	Distilled + Third Wave packets

✅ Strengths: Perfect pour control and reliable temps. Using distilled + mineral packets gives you consistent water quality — a huge edge over tap water.

⚖️ Considerations: If you want more control, you could build custom water recipes (e.g., Rao/Perger profiles) to tweak for different beans. But what you have is excellent.

⸻

Filters
	•	Japanese Hario V60 filters
	•	Sibarist FAST & B3
	•	Cafec T-90
	•	AeroPress paper filters
	•	Sibarist DISC

✅ Strengths: This is an elite filter lineup. Between Japanese V60s (clean, balanced), Sibarist FAST (high flow clarity), B3 (sweetness), Cafec T-90 (body), and AeroPress options, you can actively shape your brew’s texture and clarity.

⚖️ Considerations: None — you’ve covered the spectrum from ultra-clean to syrupy.

⸻

Drinkware & Serving
	•	Ember Mug (temp stability)
	•	Hario Carafe (serving)

✅ Strengths: Practical setup for both personal drinking and serving. The Ember mug ensures you enjoy coffee at its best temp.

⚖️ Considerations: None. Well-rounded.

⸻

Overall Rating

⭐ 9.5 / 10 – Enthusiast/Pro-Sumer Level
	•	You have top-tier brewers, grinders, filters, and measurement tools — this is far beyond a typical home setup.
	•	Your kit gives you flexibility across styles and roast levels.
	•	The only “missing” piece is espresso capability if you want to explore pressure brewing, but otherwise you’re already equipped at a level comparable to professional coffee labs.

⸻

Would you like me to also suggest “next level” upgrades (like espresso or electric grinders), or do you prefer to stay focused on filter/immersion brewing mastery?",0,1755475284.0,pourover,2,0.08,False

These are my fragrances ranked from best to worst, based on my own nose. (Everyone’s taste is different, so don’t expect my order to match yours.)
I’m not breaking down official notes, just writing what I personally smell and what I feel from each fragrance, my straight reactions. Sometimes it may not match the listed notes (like I get a boozy vibe in Khamrah even though it’s not mentioned). Well I ont care  I’ll just say what I get.

My collection so far :
1. Lattafa Khamrah : Sweet cinnamon with a boozy vibe, very intoxicating. My top pick, but my wife finds it too sweet and strong. Perfect for winters though.

2. Detour Noir : Powdery vanilla which is a bit sweet but very subtle , ofcourse it is sexy and masculine. Works with any outfit, any season in India.

3. CDIM EDP: My first Middle Eastern fragrance, bought in December 2023 (from Friday Charm for ₹4150). When I first sprayed it, it hit me with a strong synthetic lemony blast. I remember thinking, “Damn, is this what the mighty Creed Aventus is supposed to smell like? I just wasted my money on this synthetic crap!
But man… I was wrong , not totally wrong actually it was shit at initial spray tho 🤣 but after the drydown, it transformed and grew on me day by day. Back then I wasn’t married yet, my wife (who was my girlfriend at the time) absolutely loved it. Even now she says the Black One (she doesn’t remember fragrance names, they’re too long) suits me best. So yeah, after Khamrah and Detour Noir, CDIM EDP holds my number 3 spot.

4. Lattafa Asad:  Strong spicy vibe, feels more mature than 9PM.

5. Afnan 9PM: Sweet bubblegum scent. My wife’s favorite on her own skin, but not my top choice for me.

6. Nautica Voyage : Fresh, light, slightly salty cucumber. Smells great but fades away easily after a few minutes it became skin scent , I use it especially after showers or before bed on summer and  my wife loves it.

7. Rasasi Hawas : Light, sweet, yet fresh, little bubblegum smell.

8. Missoni Wave : Fresh and pleasant but weak longevity on my skin. Smell-wise I prefer it over Hawas, but performance pushes it lower.

9. Beardo Whiskey Smoke : Initially loved it because it smells smoky wood vibe , soicy masculine typeshi idk  but now it just sits half full in my wardrobe.

10. Lattafa Khamrah Qawa – Similar to Khamrah but with heavy coffee. Not bad, I do like coffee itself but I don’t enjoy the overall DNA. Ended up giving it to my cousin.

Samples I just ordered :
1. Fragrance World Star Men Nebula (from Aar Fragrance)
2. French Avenue Liquid Brun (7scents, Reddit)
3. Rayhaan Lion (Aar fragrance)
4. Lattafa Asad  Bourbon (7Scents reddit)
5. French Avenue Aether Extrait (AarF)
6. Afnan Rare Reef (free sample from 7scentsReddit :)

1mt6id8,https://www.reddit.com/r/FORSAKENROBLOX/comments/1mt6id8/my_take_on_nolis_lore/,My take on Noli’s lore,"I decided to write different lore for noli because I think the whole angsty 007n7 lore is dry and not good.

Before I just copy & paste it from my notes app, I want to apologize if my grammar is bad or my punctuations off. And with that, let me just…



Back in the olden days of Robloxia, there lived an explorer named Noli. Noli loved going to cool places, from famous pizza shops, kingdoms, to literal places of warfare! But one day, whilst Noli was traveling along a mountain, a landslide came tumbling down and caught Noli with it. Once the landslide stopped, Noli stepped out the rubble battered and bruised. Then Noli saw it. A cave! Now, the ever so delirious Noli went in the cave, hoping to find something to help patch up his bad wounds, but what Noli came across was nothing short but the worst thing that happened to him possible…

As Noli walked down the cave, he came to a giant underground room. It was rather dark, room only being illuminated by a red triangle and a crack in the ceiling bringing daylight to what seemed to be a pedestal and something on top. Noli, being interested and adventurous, went up to the pedestal and found out what was lying atop it. A crown. Noli thought “ooo, neat!” And put it on, after all it could be something rather expensive and he could prance around all of Robloxia looking cool with it on. But then Noli started to feel his insides burn, as if his blood was replaced by like an… acidy substance. Now with his left part of his body mostly covered in open wounds, began to rot. Noli knew nothing of what to do, after all he’s kinda on the ground in pain. And as his left side is nearly completely rotted, Noli saw a light. “A… star?” He thought as he reached out for it, and once it was in his hand he felt a sudden spike in his heart, as if he just drank 20 cups of coffee. Noli felt like he could do anything now, but when he got off the ground, star in hand. He realized the left side of his body was nothing but skeletal remains. “How am I still alive he thought” he said to himself, then bringing the star in front of him. “This, this is what’s keeping me going..?” He said with a sinking realization. Noli began to walk out the cave with many thoughts in his head, but once he reached the outside, he saw that the sky was red. Then suddenly…

Noli saw nothing but a red void, his mind now plagued with bad thoughts, thoughts of the Roblox civilians rejecting him, how his life was now over. This kept going for so long till Noli thought of one thing. “Kill all who may reject me.”

1mt6hch,https://www.reddit.com/r/Hilton/comments/1mt6hch/hilton_london_bankside_construction/,Hilton London Bankside construction,"Just spent 9 days in London at the Bankside in Southwark. Pretty disappointing, to be honest. Rooms are incredibly dark, even with the curtains completely open and all lights on. 

Location was fine. We choose this over the Waldorf where we have stayed before to avoid the crowds. I did enjoy exploring this neighborhood as I hadn’t spent much time here before, other than the tourist spots. 

My biggest complaint is that the entire hotel is currently undergoing pretty major construction. I believe they are adding floors. Essentially all room windows are covered with scaffolding and most have been fully frosted to provide some degree of privacy from workers on the scaffolding. Construction noise started most days at 8 am and continued until the late afternoon. 

It may be a minor point, but the giant skylight in the lounge was completely boarded over, so no natural light in there either. The lounge was a primary reason we chose this location as our daughter typically sleeps in and this gives us a chance to have a relaxing morning drinking coffee, reading the paper, etc.  The overall effect was sort of like being underground any time we were at the hotel. 

Had we been aware of the construction prior to arrival, I would have tried to weasel out of the reservation, although I doubt this would have worked - we paid in full when we booked and Hilton is pretty explicit about not providing refunds for any reason.

Without the construction, I would rate this hotel a solid 3 stars - at 4 star room rates. 

We have been pretty loyal to Hilton recently - mainly because of the ability to book guaranteed connecting rooms. To date, diamond status has provided pretty much zero benefit. I’m thinking about trying out Marriott going forward.

1mt6h9y,https://i.redd.it/fdj42cs13ojf1.jpeg,Cholesterol keeps shooting up,"Hi there! Joining the high cholesterol club 😢35F, 5’5, 130 pounds - I’ve always oscillated between 125-135 pounds as far back as I can remember, lived on a Mediterranean diet for the past 10 years and been fairly active most of the time, with the past 3 year doing yoga 3-4 times every week. 

One bad thing is that i’ve been smoking cigarettes since i was 15 and quit for a period in summer last year and now i’ve been one month free too (hopefully forever). 

The results in April really scared me so i started to reduce smoking and eventually quit for good a month ago(for the past year i have been smoking 5 a day), i also have a hiatal hernia diagnosed 5 years ago so the amount of food i can eat per sitting is ridiculously small. 

I admit i liked the occasional snack, but that’s maybe 1/4 a bag of chips fried in olive oil twice a week, maybe a slice of pizza here and there (margarita, nothing with meat) and have a sweet tooth but mostly eat fruits, although once a week i get some swedish fish gummies or a banana pudding. Reasonably speaking i cook home 80% of the time and snack maybe 10% of the time. In the weekend i eat out, and i mostly enjoy asian food (sushi, mostly just sashimi or classic rolls, nepalese, dim sum) I didn’t think diet was a problem.

Still once i got these results, i went mostly vegetarian ( i was travelling one month in india too so no choice), and when coming back i only ate fish and veggies, but still my results came bad in august.

Now after quitting smoking i am on a more serious diet to see if that can change anything. One coffee a day (2 before). I was already drinking oatmilk but now i switched to lower fat oatmilk. I changed the one egg i ate per day for a bowl of overnight oats with flax seeds and chia and blueberries. For lunch/dinner i now have just a thin slice of chicken seared in olive oil (less than 1/4 tbs) and rice, sometimes white sometimes brown, and a side salad. The dressing i do for all salads is a tiny bit of olive oil, salt and pepper and lime. That’s it. For fruit now it’s cantaloupe season so i have half a cantaloupe a day, or i might have a couple of apples or plums, but really i always eat fruit. For snack i have some pistacho with no salt or low salt. 
And a lot of water and matcha and korean green tea with brown rice. 

I don’t know what else i can do. I don’t have anyone in the family that had heart attacks, my lpa is low and my doctor basically told me that dieting won’t change anything if i was already eating healthy. They did not think i need statins and did not recommend me taking any or any supplements. 

Don’t know what else to do at this point.",2,1755474524.0,Cholesterol,1,1.0,False

1mt6e9h,https://www.reddit.com/r/BreakUps/comments/1mt6e9h/still_heartbroken_after_5_years/,Still heartbroken after 5 years,"I don't know how to live like this. It's awful. I'm devastated, heartbroken, feel guilty. I get panicky where I feel like if I just reached out and said the right thing I could get him to come back even though I know that's not true and I just sob for hours. 

I actually broke up with him. Everything got so messy and complicated. In some ways, he was my best friend, the love of my life, the sweetest person. In other ways, he stopped caring how I felt, at least it seemed like his actions seemed that way.

We were together for only 3-4 months when I got really sick. I was eventually diagnosed with POTS, and went to so many cardiologists and even the Mayo Clinic and was told the doctors ran out of medication to try. I was bedridden for almost our entire relationship.

He made me breakfast in bed every morning. He left me sweet notes on the fridge telling me loved me and would always hold my hand and telling me we would grow old together. He would get me flowers for no reason to cheer me up. Bought me lots of gifts for the same reason. Cooked dinner every night after work. Took me out in a wheelchair on the weekends to the mall or the bookstore or GameStop because he told me I couldn't stay inside on the weekend and get more depressed. He sat outside hospitals with me while I tried countless medications trying to feel better and was doing it outside hospitals because I was terrified of having more side effects which had happened with a lot of meds.

I was so nonfunctional, and I hated it. I got suicidal about how sick I was and he visited me every day after going to a mental hospital for feeling suicidal. 

But I think he started to resent how sick I was, without directly saying it. He started liking pictures of other girls (their face or bikini photos or lingerie photos) and when I told him I thought it was disrespectful, he said I was being controlling and I wouldn't care if they weren't pretty. He messaged girls to meet him for drinks behind my back when he was flying back to London to visit his family, and didn't tell me about it. When I saw the messages and confronted him, he said they were just friends and he didn't have to tell me about it unless he actually met up with them. He messaged two of his exes, one repeatedly and the other one behind my back. His friend's father drunkenly told a story about him fighting this other guy over a girl while on a fishing trip. He denied it, said the other girl was uncomfortable and he was just sticking up for her. But he didn't tell me about it till his friend's dad told that story, and because of his other behavior, I didn't believe him. Another girl he studied with at school almost kissed him he said, and he also didn't tell me that when it happened. He told me after we almost ran into her at the grocery store. He also started telling frequently that 99.999% of guys would leave (because of me being sick). I threatened to break up with him if he kept saying that and he said he was saying it because I didn't appreciate him and still kept saying it anyways. 

My dad was paying my half of costs for this time, and got tired of it and started threatening to stop sending money. My ex started applying for other jobs where my dad lived and where his parents lived in London. He finally found a pretty decent paying job where we lived, and I asked him since he found one if he could stop applying out of state, and he agreed. However, one of the jobs he applied to where my dad lived that he really wanted called him back. He interviewed for it and I even helped him prep. I asked him if I told him I didn't want to go, would he go anyways. He said yes. I didn't want to live with my dad. Both my parents were abusive growing up, in different ways. The worst part of the abuse happened in the house my dad was still living in too. My ex (bf at the time) knew this. He just kept saying nothing would happen, and we would live with my dad to save for a house and a wedding. I made up an excuse for not moving right away, and kept making up excuses to push moving out there later and later. 

I was really hoping he would realize how much he missed me by being long distance and how he didn't want to live without me. Instead, it's like the distance got worse. We had an agreement that he wouldn't make female friends, just hang out with the guys till I was there. However, he started adding random girls to social media. When I asked about them, it was like oh, this girl works in a coffee shop next to my work. He started adding her friends too and when I asked about it he said oh they also used to work in the coffee shop. My cousin messaged one of the girls and she said she didn't hang out with my ex but that he had told her I was his ex girlfriend. Then he had matching water lantern festival pictures as a new girl he added on instagram. (He never put pictures of me on his instagram, it had been a big fight previously). When I confronted him about it, he said that he got the girl's number from a party that my dad took him too, and he got angry at me and said you can't help who you have a connection with. I started arguing really nasty with my ex, saying horrible things trying to hurt him as much as he hurt me. I regret it immensely. What I really wanted was him to see how much he hurt me and for him to care about me.

It was childish, but after that, I decided I was going to go hang out with whoever I wanted to also. Somehow during the year we did long distance, I also improved where I was not bedridden anymore. I'm not sure how it happened, the doctors had no idea either. So I started going to karaoke with an old friend and his friends. I started building a social circle. I said I wanted to go back to school and I didn't want to go up there and wanted to keep doing long distance. My ex agreed.

Towards the end of the year, my health deteriorated again. I went back to being bedridden for 3 months. I lost my jobs. I lost the social circle I had been building because no one wanted to come hang out in an apt with a sick girl. I called my ex. He never wanted to talk on the phone for very long and when I told him I was sick again, he just would say I would be fine and that was it. 

I'm not proud of it, but I was so alone. I felt like my ex was never going to change, never stop trying to flirt with other girls. There was one guy from the karaoke group that offered to bring me soup, and started coming over to sit with me and watch tv. I felt so alone. I broke up with my ex, and immediately started dating the soup guy. I did not do anything with the soup guy until after I cut it off with my ex. 

My ex and I had been together 2 months short of 6 years. He started messaging me all the time, telling me he loved me, begging me to come back. He sent me two dozen roses for Valentine's Day. I was so angry and hurt I thought I didn't care. I still kept talking to my ex though. Then he found out I had a new boyfriend and he started dating people casually. This is too long to explain, but part of my childhood, I was conditioned to care only about other people's feelings. I wanted to break up with soup guy, but when I told my mom, she kept saying how I would devastate him, and so I dated him out of guilt. For 8 months. I talked to my ex the whole time, and he still kept saying he loved me. 

So I broke up with the guy of 8 months and told my ex I wanted to try again. We could go to couple's counseling, I would move up there. He then started saying he wasn't sure, he was just focusing on his job, didn't know if he wanted to be in a relationship or not. I noticed around this time, that he stopped liking other girl's photos. I was thinking maybe he was finally doing it for me and we would get back together.

That's when I found out he was dating the person he eventually married. They had been dating for a couple weeks when I found out. I called him crying and he told me he couldn't decide between her and me and that he wanted us to keep talking. I tried, but I was getting suicidal, so I would stop talking to him off and on. I wrote him a 7 page letter, with everything I said I was sorry for and how much I loved him and how I hoped he would come back to me. I called and asked him if he got it, and he just said it was nice. 

I sobbed for months. I was getting better physically again, but I just stayed in bed crying for weeks. I had no friends, no family, and felt like I was losing the love of my life to someone he had not even known that long. After three months of crying in bed, and him still telling me he couldn't decide between us, I went out with the karaoke group again. I met another guy who was extremely persistent and we started dating. I still talked to my ex once in awhile. My ex still said he couldn't decide. 

The new guy pushed a lot of stuff repeatedly that I told him I did not want, but he wouldn't take no for an answer and I would eventually cave. He pushed for moving in together, and I caved after a month of him asking repeatedly even though I had repeatedly said I didn't think it was a good idea. We moved in together anyways, and I blocked my ex on my phone at his request. I sometimes would unblock it to see if my ex would message me or to text him. I accidentally got pregnant. When I found out, I remember panicking thinking my ex would never come back. I contemplated having an abortion. I unblocked my ex and called him 3 times to see if he was still dating that girl.

My ex said they were exclusively dating, but she wasn't his girlfriend but that he thought about asking her. I told him I still loved him and he said he loved me too. I told him he should come back for me. He asked me if I was living with the new guy, and I lied and said no, because I was afraid of losing my ex forever. I think he knew I was lying though, I think my dad told him. I told him he should come back for me, that we were too old for this. He said he was afraid to do that because he was afraid I would just laugh in his face if he showed up. I said why would I do that if I asked you to come? He said he didn't know. I told him I had to make a big decision and needed to know if he had decided between us yet. He asked if I was pregnant or if new boyfriend had proposed. Again, I lied and said no because I was terrified of my ex not coming back. He then said I was pushing him for a decision and that I had told him I wouldn't do that. At this point, it had been a year into them dating. He said he still loved me and still didn't know. I tried calling another couple times, noticed he only answered me while he was working. The other two times I talked to him on the phone, he said I had taught him how to have patience. I said that sounded like a goodbye and he said it wasn't. He said he knew he hadn't been a good boyfriend. He said things probably would have been different if I had never gotten sick. I had a teaching job then, and he said he was proud of me. He still said he couldn't decide between her and me. So I blocked him and never unblocked him again. I decided to have my daughter and to fully try with the new guy. I told my dad to never tell me anything about my ex.

After my daughter was born, and was in cardiac ICU still, my father told me out of spite that my ex had married the girl. My world shattered. I have been sexually abused, almost died multiple times, raped in college. I never remembered any of the dates. I still remember the date my dad told me he was married. It was September 9, 2022. I became hysterical, and went driving by myself and didn't know where I was going. I didn't realize till I was almost at my ex's and my old apartment. 

It's now been five years since I broke up with my ex, and 3.5 years since we talked. I still think about him every day, and cry all the time. Logically, I know he's married, but I still get panic attacks that if I just reached out and said the right thing, he would come back, and then I start sobbing and can't calm down. I've been in therapy for the past three years, two with the same therapist who is a grief therapist and childhood trauma therapist. 

It doesn't work. I still can't let him go in my heart. Time didn't make it better. All I can think is that I ruined it with the only person I ever loved, and I hate myself. ",1,1755474296.0,BreakUps,0,1.0,False

What do you think?,"So I’ve been talking with ChatGPT for several months about coffee in anticipation of making a grinder upgrade in the next month or two. I just finished an 11-yr training pathway so it’s my present to myself, so to speak.

In my conversation with chatGPT, I went back and forth and did all the usual prompt engineering to get a consistent and good quality recommendation and it suggested I get the Option-O Lagom P100.

I had it write a summary of its recommendation to share with r/pourover because I’m curious what folks who use this sub a lot would think of it (marked by quotes below):

“My verdict for this specific user: Move from a Fellow Ode Gen 1 + SSP MP/Unimodal burrs (64 mm) to an Option-O Lagom P100 (98 mm) with Mizen 98 OM burrs. It’s a genuine platform upgrade (bigger burrs, stiffer chassis, variable RPM, ultra-low retention) that preserves the clarity they love while adding a more reliable mid-palate (sweetness/body) and higher extraction ceiling—without breaking their strict footprint or their “plug-and-play” workflow.

⸻

Who this rec is for (the actual user)
	•	Current grinder: Fellow Ode Gen 1 with SSP MP/Unimodal burrs (self-installed).
	•	Brewing: Daily V60 and Hario Switch; sometimes Stagg X flat-bottom.
	•	Taste targets: Very fruity, complex, clearly separated cups, but with more sweetness/body than 64 mm unimodal can sometimes deliver day-to-day.
	•	Pain points with the current setup:
	•	Occasional “tea-like” thinness/astringency when chasing max clarity.
	•	Intermittent muddiness with finicky beans and fines behavior; sometimes vegetal if under-extracted.
	•	Uses Switch/hybrid immersion to tame tricky extractions—works, but not always consistent.
	•	Constraints & prefs: Filter-only, electric only, single-dose, low retention, minimal fuss; footprint ≤ ~7″×10″; budget flexible but wants meaningful, repeatable gains (prefers B–C tier spend if it buys real improvement).
	•	Personality: Loves exploration—wants a platform that rewards changing variables (RPM, flow, agitation) without constant alignment projects or burr swapping.

⸻

Why the Lagom P100 + Mizen 98 OM for this user
	1.	It fits the station and the workflow — The P100’s offset design keeps footprint around ~6″ × ~9″ while delivering a true single-dose, very low-retention, stepless grind with variable RPM. That hits the user’s space limit and their “turn it on, grind, brew” preference.
	2.	Burrs that match the cup — brief
Mizen 98 OM are tuned for modern light roasts as an “omni-purpose” 98 mm set: clarity and note separation first, with supportive sweetness/juiciness (i.e., less risk of “ultra-thin” outcomes than many extreme-unimodal sets). This lands right between the user’s “A→B” target: sparkly/clean cups with some mid-palate.
	3.	A real platform jump from 64 mm unimodal — Going from a 64 mm SSP MP in an Ode Gen 1 to a well-aligned 98 mm flat platform materially raises the extraction ceiling and dose-to-dose consistency. In practical V60/Switch terms: you keep the fruit articulation you like, but you get more dependable body/sweetness at the same draw times and agitation, with fewer “on a knife’s edge” brews.
	4.	Exploration without headaches — Variable RPM lets you steer the cup: lower RPM/coarser to plump up body; higher RPM/finer to pop separation—without tool-time between brews. That pays off for someone who enjoys tweaking but doesn’t want to constantly tinker with hardware.”

Anyway this sub has never let me down — curious what folks make of this recommendation.",0,1755474157.0,pourover,16,0.08,False

------------------------------------------------------------

Feeding pet birds a balanced diet is essential for their health and happiness. Just like humans, birds need a mix of nutrients to thrive. Understanding the components of the best diets can help you provide your feathered friend with a long and healthy life.

### Essential Nutrients for Pet Birds

When selecting food for your bird, consider the following essential nutrients:

- **Proteins:** These are vital for muscle growth and repair. Birds often get protein from seeds, legumes, and specially formulated pellets.
- **Carbohydrates:** They provide energy. Fresh fruits and grains are great sources of healthy carbohydrates.
- **Fats:** Healthy fats support overall body function. Nuts and seeds can be excellent choices, but serve them in moderation to avoid excess calories.
- **Vitamins:** Birds require a variety of vitamins, including A, D, E, and K. These can often be found in dark leafy greens and colorful fruits.
- **Minerals:** Calcium, phosphorus, and magnesium are essential for strong bones and overall health. Offering cuttlebone or mineral blocks can help provide these minerals.

### Types of Food for a Balanced Diet

To create a nutritious diet, you can incorporate different types of food for your pet bird. Here are some commonly recommended categories:

#### 1. Pellets

Pellets are a convenient way to ensure your bird receives all the essential nutrients. High-quality pellets are often formulated with vitamins, minerals, and proteins, making them a staple in many bird diets.

#### 2. Seeds

While seeds can be a tasty treat for birds, they should not be the only food offered. Seeds are often high in fat and low in essential nutrients. If you choose to feed seeds, opt for a mixed seed diet but ensure it is balanced with other food types.

#### 3. Fresh Fruits and Vegetables

Fresh produce adds variety and essential vitamins to your pet's diet. Include a wide range of fruits and vegetables, such as:

[Click Here to Explore Animal Adoption Centres Near You in the UK](https://the-pawfect-match.com)  
  
- Carrots
- Spinach
- Apples
- Bananas
- Broccoli

Always wash fruits and vegetables thoroughly to remove pesticides and chemicals.

#### 4. Grains and Cooked Foods

Cooked grains like brown rice, quinoa, or pasta can provide energy and nutrients. You can also offer cooked legumes, such as lentils or beans, which are excellent protein sources.

#### 5. Nuts and Seeds in Moderation

Nuts can offer healthy fats and protein, but they should be given sparingly due to their high-calorie content. Consider nuts like almonds, walnuts, or pistachios, but always unsalted and unprocessed.

### Tips to Ensure a Well-Balanced Diet

Creating the best diet for your pet bird involves a few key practices:

- **Variety is Key:** Introduce a mix of foods to prevent boredom and ensure balanced nutrition.
- **Monitor Portion Sizes:** Pay attention to the quantity of food given. Overfeeding can lead to obesity, which is a significant health risk for birds.
- **Freshness Matters:** Always provide fresh food, replacing any uneaten portions daily.
- **Consult with a Veterinarian:** Regular check-ups can help monitor your bird's health and dietary needs.

Remember, every bird is unique, and their dietary needs can vary based on species, age, and health. By focusing on a balanced diet that includes a variety of nutrient-rich foods, you can ensure your pet bird leads a vibrant and energetic life.

Caring for your pet bird means being mindful of their nutritional needs. By offering a diverse and balanced diet, you'll not only support their health but also foster a happier, more active companion.

Common Dietary Mistakes to Avoid for Your Feathered Friends
-----------------------------------------------------------

If you’re a caring pet owner, you know that a proper diet is essential for the health and happiness of your feathered friend. Unfortunately, many bird owners unintentionally make dietary mistakes that can lead to serious health problems. Understanding these common missteps is crucial to ensuring your pet bird thrives. Here, we’ll explore some frequent dietary errors and how to avoid them.

One of the most prevalent mistakes is feeding a seed-only diet. While seeds can be a tasty treat for birds, they often lack many essential nutrients. A seed-based diet can lead to malnutrition and obesity. To provide a balanced diet, consider incorporating a variety of fresh fruits and vegetables. Pellets specially formulated for your bird’s species can also ensure they receive the necessary vitamins and minerals.

Another mistake is overlooking the importance of variety. Just like humans, birds can get bored with their food. A monotonous diet can lead to a lack of interest in eating, ultimately resulting in nutritional deficiencies. Aim to change up the foods you offer daily. Rotate different fruits, veggies, and pellets to keep mealtime exciting for your bird.

Here are some foods you should include in your bird’s diet:

- **Leafy Greens:** Offer kale, spinach, or collards.
- **Fruits:** Apples, bananas, and berries are usually popular.
- **Vegetables:** Carrots, bell peppers, or sweet potatoes can be nutritious options.
- **Pellets:** Look for brands that are specifically designed for your bird species.

It’s also crucial to avoid feeding certain foods. Some common foods that are harmful to birds include:

[Click Here to Explore Animal Adoption Centres Near You in the UK](https://the-pawfect-match.com)  
  
- **Avocado:** This fruit contains a toxic substance that can harm birds.
- **Caffeine:** Products like coffee or tea can be fatal to birds.
- **Chocolate:** Always keep chocolate away from your feathered friends.
- **High-fat foods:** Avoid nuts and seeds that are heavily oily and offer them in moderation.

In addition to variety and food safety, pay attention to the quantity of food you offer. Overfeeding can lead to obesity, which causes numerous health issues. Monitor your bird’s weight and adjust their portions as necessary. Following recommendations based on their species will help you serve the right amounts.

Hydration is another area where owners often overlook their pet’s needs. Always provide fresh, clean water. Some birds may enjoy bathing, so you might consider placing a shallow dish in their habitat. Just be sure that water stays clean to prevent waterborne illnesses.

Along with watery foods, be cautious with the treats you offer. It's easy to inadvertently load your bird up on sugary treats or high-fat snacks. While it’s okay to provide treats occasionally, they shouldn’t make up more than 10% of your bird’s overall diet. Focus more on healthy options; small bits of fruits or veggies can serve as great rewards.

Don’t forget to keep an eye on your bird’s reactions to different foods. Monitoring their faeces can give you insight into their digestive health. If you notice any unusual changes, it might be time to reevaluate their diet. Consulting with an avian vet is always a wise step if you have concerns.

Never forget that social interaction can also influence your bird’s eating habits. Birds are social creatures, and they often mimic their owners. Eating in front of your bird can encourage them to try new foods. Gather around the dining table and share your healthy meals with your feathered friend to make mealtime an engaging experience.

By being mindful of these common mistakes and taking steps to correct them, you can help ensure your bird leads a healthy and vibrant life. Providing a balanced diet with variety, safe foods, proper hydration, and social interaction contributes to your pet's overall well-being. Remember, happy birds make for happy owners!

### Conclusion

Feeding your pet bird a balanced diet is crucial for its health and happiness. By understanding the essential nutrients and food types, you can ensure your feathered friend thrives. A diet rich in grains, seeds, fresh fruits, and vegetables will keep your bird's energy levels high and help maintain its vibrant colors. Remember, each species has unique dietary needs, so researching what’s best specifically for your bird is key.

Avoiding common dietary mistakes is just as important as providing the right food. Many bird owners unknowingly rely too heavily on seed mixes, which can lead to nutritional imbalances. Offering processed or sugary foods can also harm your bird's health over time. Regularly assessing your bird's diet can help steer clear of these pitfalls. Be mindful of offering a variety of foods and observing your bird's preferences, as this will help you create a balanced menu tailored to their tastes.

Healthy feeding habits can lead to a happier, more active bird that lives a longer, more fulfilling life with you. Always consult your avian veterinarian if you have concerns about your bird’s diet, as they can provide personalized advice and recommendations suited to your specific pet. By prioritizing nutrition and being aware of common mistakes, you’re giving your feathered companion the best chance at a long, happy, and healthy life. Your efforts in researching and applying the best diets for pet birds will surely pay off, leading to a wonderfully enriched bond with your avian friend.",1,1755473928.0,PetAdoptionUK,0,1.0,False

A little bit about me, my name is, I am Filipino/Mexican, Ap student, I make tiktok videos/edits sometimes, I am an avid Seahawks/Clippers fan, I love to play basketball casually and am pretty good. I have a decently large friend group at school however since around covid times this has been my group away from school and really consider it my main group so having it full again would be nice to have restored with somebody hopefully better than the last guy. My favorite show is sopranos my favorite movie is place beyond the pines. I am very open minded if you are chill and am friends with all kinds of people so as long as they’re nice. I like all kinds of music from Drake to Alex G to Adrianne Lenker to Fuerza Regida so if you like something, I’ll probably like atleast some of it too.

Our second guy does track and cross country, he is Hawaiian/Mexican, plays multiple instruments (ironically not into much music so fairly impressionable), works out often, is our DM and is pretty fair all in all, will argue some bs though (if you have a spell that is not very clear for example), kind of a dickhead but its his way of letting you know he’s cool with you. Likes coffee alot (caffeine addicted) so if you’re into any of that, he might be a good friend to have, has a good amount of friends but also generally considers this the main group. Favorite energy drink is aussie lemonade.

I just can’t stop thinking about our last interaction and when I’m planning to see him next. But first I want to write it all out.

I’ve been seeing a personal trainer for around a year and a half. I began going when my then husband and I separated per my request. My health was in a terrible state and I was ready to do something about it. After everything I had been through with that relationship, I needed to do something for myself. The plan was to go for a few months and then pivot to something else. I had consultations at two studios, and despite having reservations working with a young man around my age, went with that one due to money constraints and flexibility. 

We ended up really connecting and had so much in common. It made working out fun for the first time in my life! I realized that this was good for me and I could stick to this. I decided I would go for a year to commit to this new healthy habit. We started exchanging mangas and books and talked more about life. Our sessions often ran long from us chatting (I always checked in with him on this of course). 

During this time, I also realized it was time to divorce my now ex husband. And I also felt a crush growing in me towards my trainer. I told myself he’s just being nice/personable as part of his job and I’m craving something due to my divorce. My feelings felt complex and almost shameful. I shoved the feeling for a long time. If nothing else, my crush did give me hope that there was someone else out there for me. Training became a happy place for me during this hard time and I certainly didn’t want to ruin it. I’ve kept things professional. The most I felt comfortable with doing was some eye contact and giving him a few gifts as thanks due to how he’s helped shape my new life—apparently it wasn’t too uncommon for trainers to receive gifts anyway. I gave him something for Xmas, his birthday, and produce when I have too many veggies in my garden. I kept it all pretty cheap but personal so that they weren’t “too much.”

During our time together, I lost ton of weight (this wasn’t even my goal), improved my health considerably, got divorced, and felt like I had developed a close relationship with my trainer. Now instead of him just asking me questions during sessions to keep a conversation going, we mutually spoke to each other about our lives and interests. Sometimes we even shared pictures with each other on our phones. He also got ME a birthday gift—a book I love and a book he loves that he wanted me to read. I felt in my heart that my crush was here to stay. 

Now our time is coming to an end. I’m looking to save some money and I won’t be seeing him anymore after this month. Last week, he suggested us meet up at my gym instead of the training studio for our session since he would be in the area. I wasn’t prepared to actually be working out with him. I felt myself be a little over excited and bubbly to see him outside of a professional setting. I keep thinking about this moment where we were leaning over loading a machine with weights. I looked up at him and he met my eyes and smiled. At the end, he refused payment for his time and he gave me a hug goodbye. Mind you, he’s otherwise never touched me apart from the hug I gave him after he gave me the bday gift. 

Next week is our last session. I’m a mixture of sad and nervous. Our time together has been incredible and I’m so sad to let it go. He’s really changed my life just as a personal trainer and friend. My life is so amazing now and he’s definitely a part of that. Meanwhile, I can’t stop thinking about our time at the gym together last week. Was he testing the waters? Does he see me as more than a client too? I have so many emotions swirling inside me and I can’t get him out of my head. 

I’m going to gift him a book with a thank you card I’ve been rewriting the thank you card so many times. I want to keep it professional and I also want to offer to him to keep in touch. But a week or two after our sessions conclude, I think I want to actually ask him out. For coffee, for drinks—I’m not sure what. I just think he’s such a cool person. I’d love to get to know him more outside of a work setting where we can be less filtered. The anticipation is killing me. I have to sit with this feeling for several more weeks and I just want to ask him out now and rip off the bandaid! My feelings are just so complex and overwhelming and I wish I could end them. I want an answer. But I also want to do this right for both of our sakes. Ugh! ",1,1755473644.0,Crushes,0,1.0,False

I’m “between cycling friend groups” right now and looking for a small group (maybe 3-4 folks) to do 18-19 mph avg speed road rides. 

I became a more serious rider in the last couple years, going from riding single speeds for transportation all my life to gettin all Lycra’d up and shelling out for carbon fiber (love my Canyon).

Itinerary, 17 days including travel days, middle of May:

Days 1-6 Scotland  
Days 7-14 London with a couple of day trips (Bath/Stonehenge and Paris)  
Days 15-17 Took advantage of Icelandair's ""extended layover"" offer for a quick stop in Iceland (kind of a half day, full day, half day)

Notes:

* My husband is from Scotland, so I've been there a lot. We kind of do a couple touristy things (for me) every trip and the rest is spent in the suburbs of Glasgow, visiting with H's folks, helping them with bigger shopping/house stuff, hanging out in pubs, and scheduling visits with friends around their work schedules. This trip wasn't different as far as Scotland goes, but we did take an extra week+ to see London and some other spots.
* Spending a lot of time in the Scottish 'burbs likely affected my choice to stay in a 100% tourist area, Leicester Square, which I see people on here shy away from because it's OTT touristy. While England is different from Scotland, I didn't feel the need to get to know ""what it's really like to live there"" - for us, it's not different enough to warrant staying in the outskirts of London and spend time and $ traveling back into the sights I was there to see. So Leicester Square worked for us.
* Money: Everywhere we went took credit cards. Some places don't even take cash. The only time we needed tips was for tour guides. (These are expected, FYI. I know many in the US believe tipping still isn't a thing in the UK. Restaurants have also started including tips for servers in your bill, so expect an additional 10% or so on your bill for that. It always says you can ask for it to be taken off. We didn't - I believe some servers are starting to get less than min wage, like they are in the US, because tipping has become the norm.) Another note: Maybe everyone already knows this, but I'd recommend making sure your cc doesn't charge a foreign transaction fee. I accidentally used the wrong card for our London hotel room and it made it 3% more expensive ($85!). Luckily it was one of the first things we booked, so I knew to use the other one for everything else. ""Just"" 3% for everything, over our entire trip, would have been a LOT.
* If you are planning on going out for a weekend or holiday meal, make a reservation. And check for UK holidays - they have a lot, and Mother's Day is a different day.
* Mobile phones: H takes care of this for us every time, so I don't know anything beyond big picture. He just buys a sim card when we get off the plane. I think we waited until we got into the burbs the first time because we knew it would be cheaper, but it was a huge pain trying to coordinate getting picked up without being able to communicate, and it's just weird not being able to access all your \*stuff\*. Decided the little bit of extra $ is worth it. Everything but regular texting worked. (Signal, FB Messenger, etc. still work, just not the default phone one, whatever that is...you see why he's in charge of this.) The same sim, Lycamobile, worked in the UK, France, and Iceland.
* Just a reminder: Download whatever free tours or apps you can beforehand so you don't have to spend your vacation time messing with it. I changed my mind and bought the audio tour for the British Museum once we were there and I really didn't want to spend any of my limited time there doing that.

SCOTLAND:

Hotel: We elected to stay in the city for a different experience this time, so we stayed at the ""Hampton by Hilton Glasgow Central"" on West Campbell. Not too pricey considering the location! We were a few blocks from Sauchiehall St. and there were restaurants right around the corner as well. Our room was super quiet, but our window faced a little facilities-type courtyard. Your noise experience may vary. Self-serve breakfast is included and there are a lot of choices (including a decent haggis, if you want to try it!). Staff were friendly and helpful. H said my fabric steamer wouldn't work in the UK, even with a converter, so I ordered one from amazon.uk and had it shipped to the hotel the day we arrived, and they didn't bat an eye.

Activities:

They only give the Scottish Parliament tour on certain days, and I've missed it every other time. I planned all other activities around it this time. Very cool tour - a lot about the building's unique design. The only other things we did were visit the Kelvingrove Museum, the Surgeon's Hall Museum, and Tennents Brewery (just the bar area). We didn't do the brewery tour this time because we've done it before. (Would recommend, if you're into those.)

Food:

We had afternoon tea at the Willow Tea Room on Buchanan St. This was our first time at this location. Food was good, but I prefer the one at Sauchiehall St - recommend the tour there as well. We had steak pies at The Butterfly and the Pig - delicious. We got there at an odd time, which was good - got the vibe you needed a reservation, even on a weekday. The Raven got great reviews from my fellow diners. (A BBQ kind of place, not my thing.) Went on a weekday, pretty empty. Chaakoo Bombay Cafe is great, always packed when we went/went by. Topolabamba was good but things I wasn't expecting to be spicy were very spicy. The difference between Mexican and Tex-Mex, I guess? Got a seat without problem, no res.

Transportation:

We took an Uber or cab to/from the airport - can't remember which - and the cost wasn't horrible. Took the train to Edinburgh. H took care of that, We took the subway (""tube"") to the museum. First time I've been on the tube, somehow, and I'm glad I was with locals who knew the ""inner and outer circles"" and how they worked. I probably would have been intimidated if I just walked in, expecting it to be like our subway at home. I think the stops were listed up on the wall, and it was easy to figure out when we used it later, but the circle part was a bit confusing if you weren't prepped.

ENGLAND (Days 7-14):

Hotel:

Reddit is not wrong about the Premier Inn! We stayed at the one in Leicester Square, and it was exactly what we needed. I chose the Premier Plus Double because I wanted a fridge, AC, and I've read the plus rooms are worth the little bit of extra $ if you're going to be there more than a couple of nights. I was a bit nervous when came in because the hallway right outside the elevator was really dim and the carpets were really stained - I thought the whole place would be an old, dirty mess. Nope! Everything else was great. There was NO safe in the room, so we stuffed things between our clothes. (This was weird - our Scotland hotels have always had an in-room safe.) FYI for US people, in my experience, the UK hotels don't have as many drawers as we're used to in the US. Like a couple tiny drawers, then a shelf or two in the closet. I guess they're used to people moving around a lot. Last year we ran out to the pound shop and bought some hangers because we were in one place for 1.5 weeks. This year, we just pull

Activities:

Since people ask about how much stuff they can pack in a day, I noted the sights we did each day. We also just did some walking around, shopping, etc. that I don't mention. To those not interested in that level of detail, skip this bit, I got on a roll :) We usually went to bed early because we had an early start the next day, and we're not young and a bit out of shape these days. We did a lot of walking!

Day 7: Arrived, took a taxi to the hotel. Quick lunch/dinner meal and a couple drinks at a nearby rooftop bar, then back to get ready for Hadestown at the Lyric Theater. (I planned two shows since we were near all the theaters.) Highly recommend!

Day 8: Did the early morning ""out of hours museum intro"" tour at the British Museum. I would 100% recommend any of the early morning tours just to experience walking in that door without the cacophony of a billion people. Incredible, truly a ""whoa"" moment. Tour was good, too, as was walking around with the audio tour afterwards. If we had more time, I would have dragged H back here. So much to see! It gets SLAMMED, though. I think this was the worst place for crowds of all the London sights, not sure if that's because of all the school groups. (So much smaller yet they make so much more noise.) BM does late nights one day (Friday, I think?). Maybe the crowds are better then. Our three-day Big Bus pass started this day, and we spent a lot of this day on one of the routes, just seeing everything quickly for the first time. Dinner at an Indian restaurant, where everything was too hot for me, haha.

Day 9: Took the guided tour at Tower Bridge, very much recommend. Think we used the tube to get there - I know we did the second time. They have you walk up the stairs, with breaks at certain spots, then take the elevator down. (I assume there are accommodations if you can't take the stairs.) It was definitely hard because we're kind of out of shape, but our rubbery legs made it. Brunch at VU, I can only assume named after its fantastic view of the bridge (which you pay for, fair enough). Scoped out the Tower of London lines and entrance setup for the next day since that's right next door, visited the gift shop (which is outside the TOL walls). More bus tour, different line. (Honestly, we fell asleep on the bus because we'd been out in the sun drinking beer before brunch and it was hot on the bus, too.)

Day 10: Early on the tube to get early in line for Tower of London. TOL: another 100% must-see! I don't know if it was the time of year (mid-May) or if they've done something to manage the crowds better, but none of the crowd-managing barriers were occupied, either inside or at the gate when we left. Guessing it was the time of year? I did get time with a raven by myself (the one hanging out by the food cart), which wasn't possible when I checked back later, so maybe that's a reason to go early if that's important to you? I was glad I did - I was really looking forward to seeing them! Anyway, in-person beefeater tour was fun, audio tour was good, too - whole experience is well done and completely fascinating, esp for someone from a relatively young country. I had bought a membership because I thought we'd go twice, and they just happened to have a members event when we were there: a preview of the Medieval Palace, which was set to open after we left. So that was a nice coincidence, as was the poppy installation being on display again. If you're weighing a membership, be sure to check whether there are any events while you're there and factor that into your decision. Big Bus tour came with three walking tours and a Thames cruise, all of which you have to schedule for the same day. We only made the Thames cruise and the Harry Potter tour, neither of which I'd have gone out of my way for, but they were interesting. If you're a big HP fan the tour would probably have been cool.

Day 11: Up at the crack of dawn for a bus tour to Stonehenge and Bath. I see people knocking Stonehenge on here, but honestly, this was my favorite day. From what I can tell, to get in amongst the stones, you have to take a private tour outside of normal hours. Otherwise you are kept outside a rope set up around the circle. It's an extra cost and absolutely worth every penny. It was a bucket list thing for me and just awesome, in the original sense of the word. The tour we took was well organized, with just enough stops to let us sleep and still break the journey up a bit. We stopped for breakfast on the way. We put in orders from the bus so the restaurant had our meals ready when we got there. The two Stonehenge guides break you into two groups, one outside the ropes and one inside the ropes, because they know we all want 1) photos (and this helps keep your photos from being full of strangers) and 2) just time to awe at the stones without being jostled around. So you get one tour on one side of the ropes anLacock on the way back, I think just to break up the drive. There are other tours that visit additional sights, but I wouldn't recommend it - I would have felt rushed with less time at either location. We actually plan to go back to Bath as a 2-3 day visit all its own next time we're in Scotland. We want to see the Circus and I'm sure there's more to see than we did. (Bridgerton tour, here I come!)

Day 12: Tube out to Madame Tussaud's. This was fun! Plus we got to look at all the Baker St signs and stuff on the way there. We saw Six at the Vaudeville Theater that evening - fun show! Had trouble understanding them sometimes, though.

Day 13: Eurostar to Paris, first train out, last train back. Very long day for us for a short day in Paris. (We got up at 2:30 or something?!) We weren't expecting to really be able to see or do much, and we were right. Pretty much just went cuz the Eurostar was Right There forgoodnesssake. We went on the tour of the Palais Garnier and took another Big Bus tour - that was it. It was cool to jump off at the Eiffel Tower and the Louvre, see how different the architecture was in general, and have a meal before we headed back. If you pretty much just want to see the stuff you've seen in movies in person, this is an option. If you want to \*really\* see things or go on one of the BIG tours where you start standing in line at your ticket time (Eiffel tower, Louvre, etc.) or if you want to get any feel for Paris at all, this isn't your trip - spend an extra, worthwhile day in the UK.

Day 14: Purposefully light day because I knew we'd be exhausted and need to pack. TOL preview of the Medieval Palace was this day. Kicked around the grounds again. Then we wandered over to the Gherkin building for lunch outside in the cold because I wanted to gawk at it close up on our last day. The restaurant at the base is nice, but I don't remember it being anything special. There were food trucks there feeding all the people in business clothes, and there are ledges around, so you can probably eat a little cheaper...but I could see some of the prices, and honestly, the difference didn't seem significant. Plus we wanted beer and the bathroom, so. We hit the Hard Rock that's the ""first-ever Hard Rock"" one, and just kind of kicked around for our last day.

Food:

Once again, Reddit had a great tip: We ate a few meals from the local grocery store, Sainsburys, only a few blocks away. These were great for nights where we were tired from a full day and didn't feel like being out and about, or where we were headed back out and it was easier to eat quickly. Plus they were lighter meals, which is nice after you've been traveling a lot. I got a prepackaged salad once, and we both got the ""meal deal"" that's in a lot of the grocery stores there. I think it was £5-7 for a variety of prepackaged sandwiches (there might have been a couple at £3?) and I think you can add chips and drink for a small upcharge. (I've forgotten the details now.) There was also a Greggs next door to the hotel, which is a well-known fast food place. They also have a meal deal, at least at breakfast - a sandwich and a coffee/tea for...I think it was £3.75? H looks forward to their bacon sandwich every time he's home, so he was ecstatic. I got the ""omelette breakfast roll,"" which has cheese whipped in with the eggs but didn't seem super greasy. The only other meal I'm going to bother mentioning is VU From The Tower, where I made a brunch reservation well in advance, and requested to sit where we could look at the Tower Bridge. The food was yummy, the view was gorgeous. Once we got there I realized there were other restaurants where you could sit outside and still have a great view of the bridge, so I guess that's an option if you are a bridge nut too, and sunburn isn't a concern for you. We were early for lunch, so we had a beer at one of the other spots and got a bit pink.

Transportation:

Taxi/Uber: We took a taxi from the airport and I would NOT recommend this unless the tube is not an option for you. We looked up the cost, thought it was a lot, but didn't want to deal with (what we thought was) the hassle of the tube. Taxi got stuck in traffic so the meter kept ticking: £110 final damage. There is always traffic, so if you take a taxi, brace for the same. Leicester Square stayers: It is mostly pedestrian-only, so they will drop you where they can and kind of point you where you need to go. It's teeming with people, so, tube or taxi, look up 1) where your hotel is and 2) several landmarks that are immediately nearby. The casino in front of the hotel was under construction and behind boards, so it was hard to orient ourselves. Not a big deal, but not optimal with two suitcases and messenger-type bags.

Subway (""tube""): We used the tube a lot. On the way back to the airport, we took the tube. I think it was £10-20 for both of us? That said, the Leicester Station has stairs and no elevator, so if that's an issue, you'd need to get to a station that has an elevator and then travel from there. The airport station has an elevator. The tube website will tell you which stations have elevators. The app probably will too. The app came in handy more than once - absolutely recommend you download it if you're planning to use the tube. H had looked up the way to get from a to b, then checked again right before we got our tickets. The app gave a new route - there was a fire on a platform, so it rerouted us. Nice! The only ""bad"" thing about the tube wasn't necessarily bad, it's just not what we're used to: some of the stations will guide you to the platform you need and then...that's it? You'll see other signs for other platforms from there, but no more signs pointing to the platform you're looking for. It's because you're already there.

Bus tours: These were nice, but do NOT rely on them to get you somewhere at a specific time. We had someone can call in sick and driver A had to leave so we had to either wait or figure something else out. (Luckily this happened right by a pub.) Another time, a protest shut down the street so they had to completely skip a stop for a while. I saw people getting really wound up a few times, and it's just not worth letting it affect your vacation mood if you can help it. Expect there will be a hassle or two, have a plan B up your sleeve if you need one, and be pleasantly surprised if nothing goes wrong. And say it with me: absolutely do NOT rely on them to get you somewhere at a specific time.

ICELAND:

Won't go into this here since it's off-topic, except to say if you have the opportunity, even the extended layover, TAKE IT. We did one full day and two half days on either side. We definitely plan to go again.

  
Again, sorry it's rambling. Hope it's helpful to someone!

1mt62gq,https://www.reddit.com/r/CheatedOn/comments/1mt62gq/long_story_im_not_crazy_right/,long story.. i’m not crazy right?,"so me and my (now) ex, lived together, were together for a year and a half, and he told me he had bought a ring. i thought he was my future. 

but my intuition told me to check his phone. so i looked on his snapchat and found out he had been talking to his ex for at least (they had a streak lol) a month and a half, and she was saved under a different name with the notifications silenced.. *queue literal panic attack* i never expected him to do anything like this to hurt me. i ask him about it, he tells me he unblocked and reached out to her after we had an argument, he claimed he “wanted advice on if he was the problem” because in their relationship they fought a lot. (he also said “i wanted to talk to someone who wasn’t mad at me” which i also think is a terrible answer / excuse) so in his words, he talked to his ex about our relationship issues behind my back, then continued to talk to her “platonically” for over a month, just because? he didn’t think to stop? “it didn’t mean anything” even though he KNEW he was doing something to hurt me.. 

next i talked to the ex, because why not at this point. her claims were MUCH different than his. she said a lot, but mainly she said it was not platonic, he was talking to her how he was to me and telling her he loved her. it wasn’t about me or our relationship at all. she told me he sent her some money and she sent some to him (things like “get a coffee/food” or paying for her makeup, gf / bf things to be sweet i guess) as well as receiving a gift on Valentine’s day. i ask her if she has proof, because he denies denies denies, and she sends me screenshots of her bank account with the money going to him as well as what she got from him. with the little “cute” notes. again, he denies ALL of this. so i ask him for proof that she faked these screenshots like he said lol.. 

next comes my work as a detective. he would send me screenshots or screen recordings and it would be shady, it would purposefully scroll to the exact date i would need to see and then stop, when i asked about it he would say that’s where it ended. sure. so he sends me a pdf of transactions, but ALL the dates that would have her name on it were magically missing, even though his balances reflected the EXACT amounts the ex showed on her screenshots were unaccounted for on his list of transactions. (does that make sense? his balance would be off by the exact amount the ex said he sent to her, but it wasn’t listed on the transactions because he took them off…) then as i said detective mode, i rewatched a video he took and right before he scrolls back down, her name barely shows for a second before he stops. so i show him this and he ACTS SURPRISED as if he didn’t see it. and then ALL OF A SUDDEN it’s “omg her name is on there! she sent me money, but i still never sent her any i promise!!! she’s just crazy!!” this comes along with another pdf he sent me where it literally has images you can move around, that say they were put there by *his name* and he SWEARS he doesn’t know why it looks like that since he received that pdf “straight from the bank and never edited anything”. okay. right. 
also, i looked on his amazon and he did in fact send something to her on valentine’s day, but his excuse was “she must have my amazon password and sent those to herself!” which in a different circumstance isn’t the craziest thing ever necessarily, but why did she never send herself anything else other than that one thing on valentine’s day if she’s just had access to his money the whole time and is “crazy” ? plus amazon literally has 2 factor authentication required… required!!! soooo?????? 

basically i think i’m being gaslit, manipulated, lied to, but i want to know i’m not crazy like he’s making me out to be. plus this counts as cheating, AT LEAST emotionally, right ?????? his ex claims they also cheated physically at the beginning of our relationship because me and my ex were long distance at first…. so if she’s not lying, idk, then there’s also that :))) anyways! let me know what y’all think.. sorry it’s long i know.

1mt5ytz,https://www.reddit.com/r/newborns/comments/1mt5ytz/6_weeks_positive_experience/,6 weeks - positive experience,"Hi everyone - I know a lot of people come here to vent and that’s great, but I also know that a lot of people thinking about kids or who are about to have a kid might read this sub and I wanted to drop a positive experience. 

First, already I can see that every thing is a phase - the hard parts and the easy parts. That alone is so reassuring! 

My husband and I have a six week old and so far it has been pretty good! He is a good baby, although of course he cries when he needs fed and we haven’t gotten to him yet, fusses when he’s tired before he falls asleep, and we’ve had a couple bad episodes with gas. A lot of times going outside for a few minutes will calm him down and that took us a bit to learn. But not every baby is colicky and cries 24/7. 

He sleeps in 2-4 hour blocks (the 4 hour blocks are nicest :)) Right now I’m on parental leave and my husband is working, so I’ll take the nights Sunday - Thursday and he will do Friday & Saturday. “Night” means 8 pm - 5 am, and then off duty parent gets kid at 5 am and the on duty parent will sleep till 630/7. So far the sleep deprivation actually hasn’t been terrible - although it adds up and after a couple nights in a row it gets rough, but we support each other and switch off according to the schedule. He had some congestion issues the first 3 weeks and there were a couple nights where we were literally up all night. But! Already he has grown out of it. Typically, he falls asleep on us and then we put him in the crib or bassinet when he’s asleep. We’ve done that from day 1. During the day sometimes he’ll contact nap while I’m watching greys anatomy though haha. 

I quit breastfeeding and pumping to get more sleep and taught myself to fall asleep really fast haha. But if I’m honest, engineering school was harder. 

My husband is super supportive and honestly I think he’s about as intuitively “good at this” as I am. We are a team and we’re working as a team, and while there have been hard days, there’s no one else id rather do this with and we’re so happy to have added this little guy to our life. Approaching life as a team and telling the other person they are doing a great job really helps keep both of us going. Also doing some cleaning when you are not the parent watching the kid haha. 

Delivery was ok - I spent 1-2 weeks recovering, and then we slowly resumed our normal life starting 2 weeks in. We take our kid to coffee, museums, the grocery store, church, and the park. We all get tired a little earlier so our trips are shorter, but we aren’t stuck inside by any means. We all get walks outside everyday too. I know everyone has different opinions on this, but we just keep a diaper bag packed, throw in a premade bottle and an ice pack, and go somewhere and I think that’s really helped our mental health too. We were never people who at 8pm said “hey let’s go out and party!” So switching our bed time from 9 pm to 8 pm hasnt been a huge adjustment lol

Just wanted to put this out there as a positive experience someone may find hope in - it’s not always doom and gloom and sure, having a kid is a lot of work, but every phase is temporary and it really is such a gift to add a new member to your family :)",9,1755473134.0,newborns,0,1.0,False

He was with her on 2 separate occasions, and broke up more recently 6 months ago.

At a birthday party, I helped her get sober as she was having a plane flight in short time. Afterwards, she texted me that she was thankful for my help, and we started talking ever since, non-romantically.

I told my ""best"" friend that his ex has been texting me, but I told him that it was strictly friendship, and she texted me first. He acted like he understood, but afterwards it slowly derailed. Days afterwards he would call me to meet up for a smoke or a coffee, talk normaly for 5 minutes, then ask me about her. I'd respond truthfully, and he'd start getting radio-silent.

It was manageable until about 4 days ago, when he said that ""if you ever try anything, I'm beating you up"", and ""too much talk leads to a broken jaw"", then continued calling me a plethora of slurs.

Now, he completely ghosts me. The few times he doesnt, he simply says that he's busy or that his head is hurting, then calls our other common friends and trying to meet up with them.

I've asked him numerous times if he moved on. He told me time and time again that he moved past, doesn't want to see her, while simultaneously liking her posts on insta (they dont follow each other), wanting to meet at a festival even though she's completely against it, wanting to dance at our graduation, and also threatening me if I ever try something ""romantical"". 

I've told him 100 times I'm not trying something romantic, he's also well aware that I'm moving out of my country and that I dont think/dont want a long distance relationship as I dont think those will work. He simply refuses to be believe me.

Am I really that in the wrong here? None of my/our friends are giving any opinions, or they told me that they dont want to be involved, so unironically a stranger's opinion might be very useful here.",2,1755473053.0,TeenagersButBetter,4,1.0,False
1mt5x99,https://www.reddit.com/r/libraryofshadows/comments/1mt5x99/blood_beneath_the_spotlights/,Blood Beneath the Spotlights,"Alex stood in the locker room staring at the mascot on the clothes hanger. Ruff Rudy had been the school’s Beagle mascot since the 1980s, cheering from the sidelines for no less than four state championships. Donning the fabled dog ears filled Alex with a sense of pride he hadn’t felt before in his sixteen years. Wearing the suit made him feel like a part of the team.

When Mr. Smith, the history teacher and head coach, had asked for volunteers in class, Alex had been the only person to raise his hand. Everyone always questioned why he hadn’t joined the team himself. He was well built and already stood at 6’3, but he still hadn’t grown into his height. His movements were clumsy, almost like a baby deer, and his spatial awareness was questionable at best. Much of it came from social anxiety. Alex was terrified of taking a misstep that would make people point and laugh. He had been bullied early in life, but since his growth spurt people tended to let him be. With all that considered, no one was more surprised than Alex when he volunteered to dress in a dog costume and dance to “Boots on the Ground.” Not only was he participating, the cheer squad expected him to lead the line dance.

He had worn the suit for practice, learning the routines alongside the cheer squad. The person he spent the most time with was Chelsea.

How could Alex describe Chelsea? She was stunning. Her blonde hair was almost always tied into a ponytail, her light makeup highlighted perfect features, and her blue eyes shone like spot lights that pinned you in place when they fell on you. You felt unworthy being near her, yet when she spoke to Alex he felt like the most important person in the room.

Alex was smitten. He could never find the confidence to admit it, but he thought she might feel the same. She gave him attention that he had never received before, though he wasn’t sure enough to risk having his soul crushed. To him, rejection from Chelsea would be a fate worse than anything else.

The night of the big game, Alex began dressing as Ruff Rudy. The football itself wasn’t much of a contest, just a home game against some small school. Victory wasn’t in question, and the team spent the pregame laughing and joking with one another. What really pushed Alex over the edge was the level of acceptance he felt from the players. Even some who had bullied him before now treated him like he belonged. A buzz of excitement grew in his chest. Tonight would be his night. Tonight he would go out there and leave it all on the field. That was the moment when things began to go downhill, though no one could have known it.

On the sideline near the thirty yard line, Alex paced in the suit. He clapped his foam paws together and occasionally jogged down the sideline to hype up the crowd. The Briarwood Beagles were tearing through the back country Robins, every play slicing their defense apart like butter. The game might as well have been one-sided, but the home team made it entertaining with flashy plays and long runs. The crowd was alive, and Alex found they were putty in his hands. He counted the minutes to halftime when he could finally perform. His adrenaline was pumping. His eyes were wide behind the mesh visor. The suit that once felt bulky now clung to him like a second skin. Every cheer for Rudy felt like a cheer for him.

The marching band thundered onto the field. The drum line hit so hard Alex felt each strike in his chest. He bounced on his feet and moved his head with the beat. He hit every mark, nailed the high kicks, pretended to trip over the kicker’s tee, and even shadowboxed the opposing team’s Robin mascot. Their silent spar ended with Alex dramatically taking a dive, drawing boos from the crowd, only to kip up with perfect form just as Chelsea had taught him.

The speakers erupted with the opening notes of “Boots on the Ground.” Alex could picture the music video, having studied it a dozen times to practice at home. The cheer squad lined up with him, and he began to dance. He felt an incredible release of pent-up energy. He hit every move, even the raunchier ones, earning laughs and cheers from the crowd. Each time he turned during the routine, he caught sight of Chelsea beaming behind him. Inside the foam head the sound was muffled, and the moment took on a surreal, dreamlike glow. The disconnection made him bolder, freer than he ever could have imagined.

When the music ended, Alex was drenched in sweat and breathless. He froze in his final pose, basking in the roar of the crowd. For the first time in years, he realized he was smiling under the mask. That smile lingered as he slipped off the field and into the locker room to cool down.

At the sink, he pulled off the mask and splashed cold water on his face. His reflection looked different, stronger. Maybe this was it. Maybe this was his calling. He wondered if there was a career path to becoming a professional mascot. He didn’t know, but he was determined to find out when he got home. He toweled off, put the mask back on, and stepped into the corridor.

Chelsea came around the corner. When she saw him, she squealed and wrapped her arms around him from behind.

Alex froze. He had never been touched like that before, and his whole body trembled. A surge of confidence rushed through him. This was the moment.

“I didn’t teach you some of those moves,” Chelsea laughed, her voice bubbling with giddiness.

“I did my research,” Alex said sheepishly, muffled behind the mask.

Deep down, he knew why he hadn’t taken it off. Without the mask as a shield, he couldn’t bring himself to ask what he was about to.

“Hey,” Alex said, rubbing the fur on the back of the mask. “I was wondering, would you like to get coffee or see a movie sometime?”

Chelsea’s face fell. Her eyes softened, sad like spot lights turning down their brightness.

“I’m so sorry, but I just got back together with my boyfriend,” she said gently. “I’ve enjoyed working with you, though. I’d like us to stay friends.”

Alex dropped. His heart, his soul, his confidence all seemed to spill onto the floor like entrails from a split belly. His arms hung limp, and his eyes sank into his skull.

“I’m really sorry. You’re a great guy, and someone would be lucky to have you,” Chelsea added quickly, her hands fluttering in a nervous gesture.

Alex stayed rooted to the spot. Those blue spotlight eyes looked different now. They pinned him like searchlights catching an escaped prisoner. One thought echoed in his mind.

No. No. No.

If he couldn’t have Chelsea, what was the point? He hadn’t been close to her for long, but he had admired her from afar for years.

“I should be getting back,” Chelsea muttered.

She stepped to the side, but Alex mirrored her.

“Please, give me a chance,” he muttered.

Chelsea shrank back, unsure.

“I’m sorry, Alex, but I’m not interested in you like that.”

The last of his confidence snapped. A chill washed through him, running head to toe. It felt like the calm before a performance, cool and steady.

Chelsea sensed danger. She faked right, then darted left, showing the same athleticism Alex had admired so many times before. As she slipped past, Alex’s foam paw shot out. He just wanted her to listen, to hear him out. Maybe if she gave him time, she would see what he saw.

“Chelsea, wait!” Alex cried.

His paw caught her ponytail. Her momentum carried her forward, but the pull snapped her head back. Her body hit the concrete with a sickening crunch.

Alex tried to pick her back up, paws grasping at her shoulders and behind her head. But she simply flopped back to the floor boneless. His gloves stained dark red.

The true horror of what he had done wrapped around Alex like a suffocating fog, pulling his senses under until he was absolutely numb.

When the game ended and the players began to flood toward the locker room, that was where they found Alex. He hadn’t moved. He still stood over Chelsea’s body, staring into her wide, unblinking eyes. Her pupils were glazed, the same spotlight-blue that had once lifted him up now fixed in a dull, lifeless stare. He seemed convinced that if he waited long enough, if he kept perfectly still, the light might flip back on.

The voices of his teammates echoed from the hallway. They were laughing, clapping one another on the back, still buzzing from the easy win. That noise stopped cold when they reached the door. A chorus of half-finished words filled the air. Then came silence, followed by the sharp intake of breath from someone who had seen too much too fast.

The metallic groan of the door pushed wider, and an officer stepped in, his boots clicking against the concrete floor. The locker room lights hummed overhead, casting a pale glow across the blood pooling beneath Chelsea’s head. The smell of iron lingered sharp in the air.

“Son,” the officer called carefully, his hand already resting on the holster at his hip. “Step away from her. Take off the mask.”

Alex didn’t move. He didn’t even seem to hear. His foam paws hung at his sides, fingertips stained red where they had touched Chelsea. His chest rose and fell, slow and deliberate, like a man still keeping time with a song no one else could hear.

The officer moved closer, his boots scraping against grit on the floor. He reached out, hesitating only a second before grabbing at the oversized dog head.

The moment his fingers brushed the fur, Alex erupted. His stillness snapped like a rubber band. He surged forward, the bulk of the suit slamming into the man and driving him down onto the concrete. The officer’s head smacked against the floor with a flat crack, echoing through the cinderblock walls.

The locker room exploded into shouts. Players screamed. Someone yelled for another cop. Someone else retched in the corner.

Alex’s foam paws pressed into the man’s throat, squeezing with surprising force. His muffled breaths rattled in the mask, heavy and distorted, animalistic. He slammed the officer’s skull into the ground once, twice, three times, the sound a wet, brutal thud that silenced the room.

The officer’s arms flailed weakly, then fell limp, his eyes rolling back as blood trickled into his hairline. Before Alex could bring his weight down again, a sharp jolt tore through him. Electricity locked his muscles. His body spasmed, jerking violently in the suit. He toppled to the side, foam paws twitching like broken marionette strings.

He lay on the ground trembling, the smell of burnt fabric rising faintly from the fur. The world around him blurred into chaos. He heard voices, frantic and overlapping. He heard Chelsea’s name again and again, half screamed and half sobbed. But none of it touched him.

Through the mesh visor, the fluorescent lights buzzed above, distant and unreal. He thought, for just a flicker of a moment, that if he closed his eyes he would open them somewhere else. Somewhere with drums pounding in his chest, a crowd cheering his name, blue spot lights falling on him again.

But when he opened them, the mask was still on his face, the taser barbs still buried in his side, and the world he wanted was gone forever.

Alex never spoke again. Not during the interrogation, not during the trial where he received twenty-five to life for murder and attempted murder on an officer. Much like Ruff Rudy, Alex would be hung up in a closet, forever inert.",1,1755473012.0,libraryofshadows,0,1.0,False

Chapter 1 — The Box

They find the game the day after the move, tucked behind old paint cans in the garage. A grimy wooden lid with burned letters:

MIDNIGHT SEEK
One household. Four hiders. Two seekers. Play to remember. Play to keep.

“Creepy,” Jace says, already smiling. He’s the one who touches things he shouldn’t.

“Put it back,” Lila says, because she’s learned the script of being oldest. She says put it back about a lot of things.

But they don’t. They carry it to the dining table, dust making halos in the light. Inside: a sandglass half full of black grains, a brass wind-up bell, eight cards with blank faces, and a rules sheet in red ink that looks like it was written with a leaky pen or a cut.

Lila reads aloud.

1. At midnight, wind the bell and turn the glass. Seekers awaken.
2. Hiders have until the last grain falls.
3. If a hider is seen, they must not scream. Screams count as forfeits.
4. If the bell rings again, the game ends.
5. In the morning, the house forgets what it can.
6. Do not involve the neighbors. The game hates an audience.


Chapter 2 — First Night

They didn’t mean to play.

They didn’t even set the pieces right. But at 11:59 p.m., the brass bell rattled inside the box by itself, soft at first, then shrill. Amir woke screaming, swore he felt hands under his blanket.

The parents came out of their room.

Except it wasn’t them.

Mom’s eyes were wide, too wide, the whites so bright they looked painted on. Dad’s grin stretched until his lips split in the corners, teeth showing all the way back like knives shoved into gums.

“Where are my babies?” Mom cooed, voice lilting like a broken nursery rhyme. “Where, where, where?”

Dad jerked forward so fast the air shifted like a door slamming. He didn’t walk — he slid, arms dangling, joints loose, head twitching like a marionette pulled by too many strings.

The kids ran.

Lila grabbed Amir, shoved him into the linen closet, slammed it shut, pressed her body against it. Jace dove under the couch, knees tucked to his chin. Nyla froze in the hall, whispering, “Not real, not real, not real…” until Mom’s shadow poured over her.

“Peek-a-boo,” Mom sang, crouching low, joints bending backward. Her face stopped inches from Nyla’s. The smell of pennies and milk soured the air.

Nyla wet herself. Hot, humiliating, a dark patch spreading down her pajama legs. She sobbed, hands shaking.

Dad’s head snapped toward the sound.

The grin widened.

“Found you,” he hissed, the words crawling out of his throat like bugs.

He grabbed Nyla by the hair and dragged her down the hall, her heels leaving streaks on the hardwood. She screamed, shrill and animal, until her voice tore.

Lila burst from the closet, slamming into Dad with all her weight, screaming at Jace to help her. Jace darted out, swinging a lamp. Glass shattered. Dad staggered, bones cracking back into place.

The bell rang once more.

Just like that, the parents blinked. Their faces smoothed. Their jaws shut. Their eyes softened into confusion.

Mom stood barefoot in the hall, hair tangled, looking down at Nyla sobbing in a puddle of her own urine.

“Oh, sweetheart,” she whispered, horrified. She scooped Nyla into her arms. “You had a nightmare. Shhh, baby, shhh.”

Dad rubbed his temple like he’d been hit with a hammer. He looked at Lila and Jace, who were shaking, pale, glass shards in their skin.

“What happened?” he asked, voice normal, tired.

No one spoke.

The bell, now quiet in the box on the table, gleamed as if it had been polished. The sandglass had emptied, every last black grain at the bottom.

⸻

Chapter 3 — The Second Game

The next day, things were almost normal. Almost.

Mom hummed while folding laundry, but the tune twisted in places like she’d forgotten how it went. Dad drank his coffee too fast, hands trembling, eyes bloodshot.

The kids stayed together, silent. Lila pressed them to her: Don’t say anything. Don’t tell them what they were last night. They don’t know.

But Amir asked anyway. At lunch, small voice trembling: “Do you remember… last night?”

Mom froze, fork in midair. Dad’s jaw clenched.

“Remember what?” Mom asked.

“You were…” Amir stopped, tears welling up. “You were playing.”

Neither parent answered. They just looked at each other, like strangers passing in a mirror.

That night, Lila locked all the doors, hid the box under her bed. At midnight, the bell rang anyway.

This time, the parents moved faster. They tore through rooms with jerking speed, arms snapping against walls, fingers dragging along ceilings.

“Come out, come out, little ones!” Mom giggled, crawling on all fours, her grin glistening. “We seeee you!”

Amir hid under the sink, biting his fist to keep quiet. His bladder betrayed him again, piss running down his leg, dripping on the tiles. The sound was enough. Dad’s head snapped, ears twitching like a dog’s. He crawled into the kitchen, joints clicking, smile tearing wider.

Jace tried to grab Amir, tried to cover his mouth, but Dad’s hand darted inside, pale and inhuman, nails scraping the tile.

“Got you.”

He yanked Amir out, head cracking against the cabinet. Amir screamed.

The bell rang again.

Morning came.

Mom found Amir with a split lip and bruises, cradled him, kissed his head. Dad looked at his own hands as if searching for blood.

And in the box — two of the blank cards now had red smears across them, as if painted in with tiny fingers.

⸻

Chapter 4 — The Neighbor

By the third night, Ms. Ellison from next door noticed the screaming. She came over at 12:30 a.m., robe tied, phone clutched like a weapon.

The kids heard her knock. Bang, bang, bang.

“Everything okay in there?” her muffled voice called.

The bell rang louder than ever.

The parents froze, their grins snapping into place, heads tilting toward the sound.

“Shhh,” Mom whispered, eyes darting to the front door. “The game doesn’t like guests.”

They moved before the kids could even warn her. Dad slithered across the floor, yanked the door open with a snap.

Ms. Ellison blinked at the sight of him — his face stretched, mouth wider than possible.

“What in God’s—” she started.

Mom’s hand shot out, fingers wrapping her throat. The kids watched from the stairs as Ms. Ellison’s eyes bulged, her body thrashing in the doorway.

“Found you,” Mom cooed.

The kids screamed. Amir covered his eyes. Nyla vomited into her own hands.

Ms. Ellison collapsed in a heap, neck twisted wrong. Dad dragged her body inside, grinning, before the bell rang again.

Morning.

The body was gone. The neighbors whispered. The cops came, asked questions, left with no answers.

And still, when night fell, the game waited.







⸻

Chapter 5 — Nyla’s Attempt

By the fourth night, the kids stopped pretending. They knew it would happen. They knew the bell would ring no matter what they did.

This time, Nyla whispered a plan. “We run. We don’t hide. We go out the back door, down the block, scream for help. Someone will listen.”

“No one listens,” Lila muttered. But when the brass bell rattled on its own, they all grabbed shoes with shaking hands anyway.

The parents emerged from their bedroom as the sandglass flipped by itself. Their faces stretched into those wrong masks — eyes peeled wide, jaws splitting.

“Where are my babies?” Mom sang. “I smell you…”

Nyla grabbed Amir’s hand, yanked him toward the back door. Jace pushed Lila forward. Together they shoved into the cold night, bare feet slapping the porch wood.

For one second, freedom.

Then Dad appeared in the yard before them, body jerking from shadow to shadow like a skipping film reel. His grin tore all the way back, skin splitting wetly at the corners.

“You can’t run from home,” he hissed.

He lunged.

Nyla screamed, dragging Amir. She almost made it to the neighbor’s fence before Dad’s hand clamped her ankle. She kicked — bone crunch, pain exploding. He didn’t let go. He twisted, yanked her backward so fast her knee dislocated with a pop like a snapped branch.

She hit the ground. Amir tumbled, shrieking, trying to claw at the grass.

“Lila! Jace!” she screamed. “HELP ME!”

They ran back, stupid, brave. Jace grabbed Dad’s arm, trying to pry it loose, but Dad’s bones shifted under his skin like snakes. The arm simply re-bent in the wrong direction, elbow turning full circle, hand still locked around Nyla’s ankle.

Then Mom appeared, crawling out of the dark on all fours, her head hanging too low, grin shaking. She caught Jace by the throat, slammed him against the fence hard enough that wood cracked.

“Found you,” she whispered, eyes wide. “Found you, found you, found you.”

She squeezed until blood vessels burst in his eyes. He clawed at her wrists, gasping, piss running down his legs as his body betrayed him. Lila smashed a brick into her head. Mom’s skull cracked — but instead of falling, she laughed, blood pouring from the break.

Nyla screamed again as Dad dragged her back, nails tearing the dirt. Her voice cracked, turned raw.

And then — the bell rang.

Just like that, it was over.

Morning sunlight poured through the curtains.

Nyla’s knee was swollen, purple. Jace’s neck bore deep red bruises. Amir still sobbed, rocking in place, whispering, “We almost made it, we almost made it…”

Mom came into the kitchen in her robe, yawning. Dad scratched his head, half-asleep.

“Why are you all awake so early?” Mom asked.

No one answered.

On the table, the sandglass flipped again — by itself.

⸻

Chapter 6 — The Hollis Death

Two nights later, it was Mr. Hollis who heard the kids’ screams. He was out on his late walk, earbuds in, flashlight bobbing. He saw the curtains of the house flicker, saw a shadow jerk unnaturally across the window.

He came knocking.

“You kids okay in there? Mara? Seth?”

The bell was still ringing when Dad opened the door.

Mr. Hollis froze. He saw the grin, the eyes. He took a step back.

“What the hell—”

Dad shot forward with inhuman speed, slamming him into the siding. The flashlight clattered to the ground, beam wobbling across the grass.

“Found you,” Dad said in that too-low voice.

Mom came crawling out on all fours, lips split wide. She grabbed Hollis by the mouth and jaw, fingers hooking inside his cheeks. With one quick jerk, she tore his mouth wider, splitting skin from ear to ear, a grotesque mirror of her own grin.

Blood sprayed across the porch. Hollis gurgled, thrashing, eyes bulging. He tried to scream, but the sound came out in wet bubbles.

The kids watched through the stairs’ railing, tears streaming, unable to move. Amir sobbed into Lila’s shirt, snot and spit running. Jace shook uncontrollably, muttering, “We’re next. We’re next.”

Dad dragged Hollis inside like a broken doll. Mom licked blood off her fingers.

The bell rang.

Morning came.

There was no body. The porch was clean. The flashlight was gone.

But in the box, three cards were now painted red.






⸻

Chapter 7 — Amir’s End

The sixth night was the one that broke them.

They didn’t even bother locking doors. They just sat in the dark, trembling, waiting for the bell. When it rang, Amir curled against Lila, whispering through his teeth:

“I don’t wanna hide. I don’t wanna play.”

“You have to,” Lila whispered back. “You have to.”

But his small legs shook too much. When Jace dragged him under the stairs, Amir pissed himself again, the hot stream soaking through his pajama bottoms, puddling on the concrete. He covered his face, sobbing.

The smell gave him away.

Mom’s head snapped from the hallway, nostrils flaring wide. Her grin split until the corners of her lips cracked bloody. She dropped to all fours, elbows popping out of socket, and scuttled across the floor faster than a spider.

“There you are…” she hissed, peering under the stairs. Her wide eyes gleamed in the dark.

Amir screamed — a raw, childish shriek — and tried to crawl deeper into the crawlspace. Lila clawed at his arm, trying to pull him back, but Mom’s hands were already there, fingers long and bony, wrapping around his ankle.

“Got you.”

She yanked. Hard.

Amir’s small body slammed against the wood as she dragged him out. His nails tore bloody lines into the concrete where he tried to hold on. His screams turned into panicked, choking sobs:

“Please! Please, Mommy, stop! PLEASE!”

Dad appeared then, grinning, head cocked sideways, bones cracking with every twitch. He crouched low, blocking Jace and Lila from lunging forward.

“No saving turns,” he said, his voice a harsh, guttural growl. “No cheating.”

Mom pinned Amir on the floor, her face inches from his. Her jaw opened wider, wider, until the skin split along her cheeks. She leaned down and bit into his throat.

The sound was wet and sharp, like tearing open a bag of meat.

Blood sprayed across her face, hot and steaming. Amir kicked once, twice, legs jerking violently, piss mixing with the blood pooling beneath him. His eyes bulged, small hands clawing weakly at her face.

“Mommy!” he gurgled, voice choking in his ruined throat. “Mommy, please—”

The words cut off in a bubbling hiss. His body convulsed. Then went limp.

Mom sat up, face dripping scarlet, her grin splitting even wider. She chewed slowly, eyes locked on the other kids.

“Found him,” she whispered. “And he was delicious.”

The bell rang.

Morning came.

Lila woke on the couch with dried blood crusted into her shirt. Jace lay on the floor, shaking, staring blankly at the ceiling. Nyla rocked back and forth, whispering prayers with her hands pressed together until her knuckles bled.

The house smelled like copper and rot.

But Amir’s body was gone.

The only thing left was the puddle of piss and blood under the stairs… and a new card inside the box. This one wasn’t blank.

It showed Amir’s face.

His mouth was sewn shut in the drawing. His eyes were wide and wet.

The rules had changed.





⸻

Chapter 8 — The Fire

By the seventh night, no one spoke Amir’s name.
It was too dangerous.

Lila was the one who finally said it: “We’re not playing anymore. We end it tonight.”

Jace stared at her like she’d said a curse. “You saw what happens if we don’t play.”

“We’ll burn it,” she snapped. “The box. The sandglass. The bell. We burn it and it’s over.”

Nyla whispered through her bitten nails, “What if it’s worse if we try?”

“It can’t get worse.”

So they dragged the box to the backyard when the sky was bruised purple. They piled wood around it, soaked it with lighter fluid. Jace flicked the match. The flame roared, swallowing the box in a bloom of orange.

The kids clung to each other, watching the black grains of the sandglass glow red, watching the bell warp and blister in the fire. The smell of burning varnish clawed at their throats.

“Is it—” Nyla began.

The bell rang.

Inside the fire.

Once.

Twice.

Then again, shrill and mocking, louder than ever, even as the metal melted, even as the wood collapsed into ash.

The ground trembled. The flame blew sideways, snuffed like someone had cupped a giant hand over it. Smoke whirled backward into the box as though inhaled.

And the box sat there. Intact. Clean. Not a mark of fire on it.

“Run,” Lila whispered.

They sprinted for the gate. Jace shoved the latch, dragging Nyla through. They bolted across the street, bare feet slapping pavement.

The night was silent except for the blood in their ears—until the air split.

Their father appeared in the middle of the street, grin ear-to-ear, head jerking with each twitching step. Their mother crawled up the sidewalk after them, arms bending backward like broken wings.

“You can’t leave the board,” Dad said, his voice low and thunderous. “The board is you.”

Mom shot forward on all fours, her head dragging close to the ground, hair sweeping the pavement. Her wide eyes locked on Jace.

He shoved Nyla behind him. “Go!”

But the parents were already there.

Dad’s hand slammed Jace into the asphalt, forehead bouncing against the tar hard enough to crack skin. Mom scuttled over Nyla, fingers digging into her hair, dragging her back, nails scraping her scalp until blood ran.

They screamed, thrashing, fighting, clawing — but every time they almost broke free, a hand or leg bent wrong blocked their path, dragging them back toward the house like the street itself was rejecting them.

They were shoved inside, the door slamming shut behind them.

The box was waiting on the table. The sandglass flipped by itself.

The first black grain fell.





⸻

Chapter 9 — The Police

Ms. Ellison’s disappearance hadn’t gone unnoticed. And when Mr. Hollis vanished too, the cops came.

Two cruisers rolled up just before midnight, headlights washing the house in sterile white. Red-and-blue lights bounced against the siding.

“Stay put,” Lila hissed, clutching Nyla’s hand. “Don’t make a sound.”

The bell rattled anyway.

Mom and Dad froze mid-step in the living room. Their grins split. Their eyes widened. The game had begun.

The cops didn’t know.

“Police department!” a voice barked. A heavy knock rattled the door. “Open up!”

Dad’s head tilted, his grin trembling with laughter that never came. Mom crawled to the window and peeked out, her wide eyes flashing in the patrol light. She whispered, “Found you,” like a secret.

The cops forced the door.

Two officers stepped in, hands hovering near their holsters. One was broad, jaw clenched tight. The other younger, eyes sharp, flashlight cutting through the gloom.

“Sir, ma’am — stay where you are.”

Mom and Dad did. For a breath.

Then they moved.

Faster than human.

Dad slammed into the broad officer, shoulder first, so fast the man’s ribcage caved in with a sickening crunch. He collapsed, screaming blood. Dad’s hand slipped between his ribs like fingers into wet clay. When he yanked it back, he tore out a fistful of lung, steaming in his palm.

The younger cop screamed, yanking his gun free. He fired. The shot cracked through the hallway. Mom’s head jerked sideways, blood spraying — but she only laughed, her grin splitting wider through the bullet hole in her cheek.

She leapt onto him, bones snapping in and out of place as she wrapped her legs around his torso. She shoved two fingers into his eyes. They sank deep, popping wetly, until his screams turned to shrill gargles.

“Peek-a-boo,” she whispered, yanking her fingers free with strings of jelly trailing.

He fired again blindly, bullets tearing into the ceiling, plaster raining down. Then his throat opened with one swift bite from her teeth. Blood sprayed across the wall, coating the family photos in red.

The kids watched from the stairs, trembling, silent. Lila clutched Nyla’s face into her chest, whispering don’t look, don’t look, but she looked. She couldn’t not look.

Dad dropped the lung on the carpet. Mom licked the blood from her fingers like honey.

The bodies twitched, then stilled.

The bell rang.

By morning, there were no cruisers. No blood. No bodies.

But in the box, two new cards waited. Both showed cops’ faces. Eyes gouged out. Mouths sewn shut.





⸻

Chapter 10 — The Sun Lies

Lila thought she’d found a loophole.

“If they don’t remember at dawn,” she whispered, clutching Jace and Nyla close, “then we leave before night. We walk out when they’re normal. They can’t stop us in daylight.”

So they packed quietly. Backpacks. Water bottles. Amir’s empty shoes still by the door like an accusation. Nyla clutched her stuffed bear, its fur stiff with old stains. Jace carried the last of the sandwiches from the fridge, shaking so bad crumbs fell across the counter.

Mom was humming in the kitchen. Normal. Dad was fixing a chair leg with a screwdriver. Normal.

Lila waited until noon. When the sun burned high and the neighbors’ sprinklers hissed across the street, she mouthed Now.

They bolted for the door.

The moment Jace touched the knob, the air went still. The daylight dimmed. Shadows spread across the living room like spilled ink.

The bell rang.

In broad daylight.

Mom’s head snapped up, grin already tearing wide. Dad’s screwdriver clattered to the floor as his arm bent backward with a sharp crack.

“No,” Jace gasped, slamming the door open. Sunlight poured in — and yet it was wrong. The sky outside had turned the color of spoiled milk. The neighbors’ houses looked distant, stretched, like they’d been painted by someone with shaking hands.

“Run!” Lila screamed.

They did. Across the lawn, across the street, breath tearing their lungs apart. The world outside was silent — no sprinklers, no dogs, no cars — just the shrill rattle of the bell echoing everywhere.

Nyla tripped. Jace yanked her up, but she was already sobbing, eyes wide, face wet. “It’s not real,” she cried. “It’s not real, it’s not—”

Dad appeared in front of her, grin splitting ear to ear. He bent sideways at the waist until his face was upside down, teeth dripping.

“Found you.”

He lunged, grabbing Nyla by the throat. Her scream turned to a gurgle as his fingers sank in deep, bones cracking. Lila shrieked and slammed into him, but he barely budged. His eyes rolled white as he squeezed.

Nyla kicked and clawed, but his grip crushed deeper, cartilage snapping in her neck. A spray of urine burst down her legs, soaking the grass. She choked, face turning purple, eyes bulging.

“Please!” Lila screamed. “PLEASE, LET HER GO!”

Mom appeared behind her, crawling on all fours, grin dripping blood though she hadn’t bitten anything yet. She leaned close, whispering in Lila’s ear:

“One less hider.”

Dad twisted.

Nyla’s neck snapped with a sharp, final crack. Her body went limp, head dangling wrong, eyes frozen wide with terror.

The bell rang once more.

The world snapped back to daylight.

Jace collapsed in the grass, shaking violently, blood vessels burst in his face. Lila held Nyla’s body, sobbing, rocking back and forth. “She’s gone. She’s gone.”

The neighbors’ sprinklers hissed again. Birds sang. The sun was warm.

But in the box, another card appeared. Nyla’s face this time. Her mouth sewn shut. Her eyes still wet.

The game wasn’t waiting for midnight anymore.





⸻

Chapter 11 — Jace’s Turn

The house knew.
The box rattled on its own even in daylight, the bell clinking like it was laughing.

Lila and Jace didn’t speak much anymore. They sat in silence, faces pale, eyes hollow. Nyla’s body had been gone by morning, just like Amir’s, but her card stared from the box.

That night, the bell didn’t wait until midnight. It screamed at 10:14 p.m., sharp and metallic, echoing through their skulls.

Mom and Dad rose from the couch like puppets pulled too hard by strings. Their grins stretched instantly, ears to ears, teeth dripping spit.

“Two little hiders left,” Mom sang, voice syrupy and cruel. “Two little hiders hiding…”

Jace grabbed Lila’s wrist. “We fight,” he whispered. “We can’t keep hiding.”

They ran to the kitchen, yanked open drawers, grabbing knives. Jace’s hand shook so hard he nearly dropped his. Lila pressed hers against her own arm just to feel how real it was.

The parents didn’t walk. They lurched. Bones popped in and out of place with every step, shoulders swinging unnaturally, their eyes locked onto the siblings.

“Found you,” Dad growled.

He lunged. Jace stabbed wildly, the blade sinking into Dad’s side. Blood gushed black and thick, but instead of falling, Dad laughed, grabbing the knife by the blade. The metal shrieked as he twisted it out of Jace’s hand like it was rubber.

“Try harder,” he whispered.

He slammed Jace into the wall so hard the drywall caved in. Lila screamed, stabbing Mom in the arm. The knife sank deep — but Mom just bent her head down and bit her own arm around the blade, blood soaking her teeth. She giggled, pulling it free with her mouth.

Jace tried to scramble away. Dad’s hand shot out, wrapping around his ankle, dragging him across the shattered plaster. Jace clawed at the floor, leaving bloody streaks from his nails.

“Lila!” he screamed, voice breaking. “Don’t let them—”

Dad lifted him by the neck with one hand, dangling him like a rag doll. His grin stretched so wide the skin split up his cheeks. “Peek-a-boo.”

Then he slammed Jace down onto the corner of the counter.

The sound was wet and final — Jace’s skull cracking open like a melon. Blood sprayed across the tiles, hot and steaming. His body convulsed once, twice, before going limp, his eyes still open, staring at nothing.

Mom clapped her hands like a child. “Found him!” she sang. “Found him!”

The bell rang once.

Morning came.

Jace’s body was gone. But in the box — a new card, crimson, showing his face with his mouth sewn shut, his eyes blank.

Only Lila remained.

⸻

Chapter 12 — The Last Hider

She didn’t sleep.
She couldn’t.

Every creak of the floorboards, every whisper of the air vent felt like her parents breathing down her neck. The box sat on the table, humming faintly like a hive. The sandglass turned itself over at random now, black grains falling whether it was day or night.

“Last hider,” Mom cooed one morning at breakfast, voice sweet as sugar, but her grin stretched too wide as she buttered toast. “Last hider wins a prize.”

Dad winked, head twitching sideways with a faint crack. “If she makes it to the bell.”

Lila’s hands shook. “I won’t play anymore.”

Both parents froze. Their smiles held, but their eyes darkened.

“You don’t get to quit, baby,” Mom whispered. “The game doesn’t stop until there are no more hiders.”

That night, the bell screamed.

The house folded in on itself. Rooms stretched wrong, doors led back to the same hall. Every shadow felt alive, eyes gleaming from the corners.

“Where is she?” Mom sang, crawling across the ceiling like a spider. Her head twisted around backward, wide eyes glowing in the dark. “Where, where, where?”

Lila ran. She dove under her bed, pressing her hands over her mouth. Her body shook, bladder threatening to give like Amir’s, but she forced it still. She bit her wrist until blood filled her mouth, masking the sobs.

The footsteps came closer. Fast. Too fast.

Dad crouched low, head twitching side to side, teeth dripping. “You can’t hide forever, little mouse.”

The sand in the glass above the box fell faster now, black grains pouring like a waterfall.

The bell rattled harder.

Mom dropped from the ceiling, landing inches from the bed, her grin trembling with excitement. “Found you.”

A hand shot under, pale and clawed. Fingers brushed Lila’s ankle. She bit back a scream, tears flooding her eyes.

The bell screamed again — a constant, ear-splitting shriek.

And then… silence.

Chapter 13 — After

The neighbors swore the family was still there. They swore they saw Mara and Seth mowing the lawn, waving politely, buying groceries.

But no one saw the children again.

And sometimes — when the street went too quiet, when the lights in the house flickered wrong — people swore they heard a faint bell ringing.

If you listened harder, you could almost hear a girl’s voice, thin and broken, crying from inside the walls:

1mt5rlr,https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/1mt5rlr/i_want_to_help/,I want to help.,"Dear gentlepeople. I've spent a significant amount of time on this subreddit over the past couple of years. And by god have people done some stupid shit.

I am here to help, through familial relations, a knack for finding places and things I shouldn't and talents considered unnatural by some I know stuff.
And I am here to share my knowledge with you. 

All of the stories we've read here are based on the fact that reality is actually quite weak, and once it starts slipping it almost  never stops. People don't know how to stop it. I am here to hopefully teach some of the more clever ones here what to do.

First things first.
Follow the damn rules.
Almost all the run of the mill reality fuckery follows certain rules, and specific circumstances warp reality which allow some rules to lose efficacy. 

However, humans being humans, we tend to find out the new rules by trial and error (often involving some ‘better him than me’ sacrifice) and when we follow these things work out fine, giving us the list stories we are all familiar with. The best outcome is usually survival by having followed the rules. 

The way to fix a clusterfuck like this is to re-establish reality, by introducing more, stronger observers. This is difficult because situations like this tend to attract people who are already slipping down the drain and are less bound to reality than most.

Yes, the people who get in these situations are less real than most, definitely less real than me and my companions, propably not that much worse off than you unfortunately.
Your best bet is to restore your own reality simply by interacting more, crawl out of your hole and find people in normal places, whatever you do, don't go to that shady, secretive rave you've heard of and propably got invited to. I guarantee you nobody there is on the right sight of the reality collapse you're sinking into.

Go grocery shopping when it's busy, stand in line in a coffee shop during rush hour, and interact with normal people doing normal things. A sense of isolation is one of the first things you will notice before shit breaks down.

Second.
And already touched upon.
Assert your reality.
Reality is fragile, and drags things down with it.
A good example is the U.S. nowadays. It's simply too big to have enough observers everywhere in order to keep things from going to shit. Ghost towns abound where a handful of people live. If you come from one of these small towns you'll be able to tell. 

When you reach a new place, one closer to being fully real, you'll notice a number of things. The air feels fresher, breathing is like drinking that first sip of water after a long warm day
The weather feels more committed, no vague dreariness or exhaustive, lifeless heat. But cold biting rain, burning sun you feel deep in your bones, wind that buffets you instead of isolating you. You yourself will feel more aware, as if you finally woke up after a slow, early morning. Not the sudden jolt of caffeine, but actual awareness.

And you will remember, you'll remember all the little things you've failed to notice because you are slowly becoming less of an observer, less real in your dilapidated town circling the drain. 
The man without a shadow, the mother with an empty stroller. 
The lady with twins that have been the same age for years now. 
The dog that doesn't actually look like any kind of dog you've ever heard of. 
The lack of insects in the day to day, the overabundance of pests that invade your house. 
No ants in the garden, no bees in the field, flies and cockroaches in your bed and kitchen.
The childhood friend you've helped move away but who never left or returned unnoticed, failing to assert his reality in a place a few rungs up the ladder.
Who walks around blank faced and unseeing gaze, he's farther down the hole than you are, I don't think he can be salvaged.
But you just might.

Third.
Avoid slipping away, don't take the fucking night gig. The moment someone tells you. “I have a lucrative graveyardshift job, there's just some rules to follow” turn around and walk away. 
And if it's your childhood buddy with his blank stare.
Run.

When you see a building or entrance that shouldn't be, don't go in, not one step. It might seem like a small thing, after all what's one step into the darkness?
 But it's an enormous leap from a reality standpoint. It's a deliberate move downhill into obscurity and many of you have already done this at least once. 

Remember the time you woke up to piss?
How the hall was a bit longer and a bit darker? How the bathroom felt deeper, the damp smell, the sound of something keeping very still? The relief when you got back in bed beyond the emptying of a bladder? That was a threshold, and you would've been better off pissing the bed.

When you see a pair of stairs in the woods? Don't go up,  you won't get down the same place, if at all.

Accept that nature can hold a grudge, and some places are out for blood. I don't have any tips there, I don't fuck with cornfields 3 hours away from anything that matters. And I don't go into the woods to find some long forgotten forest god who went insane with age (gods are some reality fucking bullshit in and of themselves, ask me if you like, but know that curling up and dying is often the better choice).

If you feel real enough and the forest is kind to humans the woods can help, but if you are slipping? Stay out of the scary places, like all of Appalachia, Aokigahara, Hoia-Baciu.

Fourth.
Don't give up, you are a human goddammit, you are an observer and with practice you can fix this shit.
Everything out to get you is either afraid or jealous of you.
These things invariably manifest as anger, hatred and obsession. Don't allow the things that go bump in the night to lure you in, don't allow the drowned to drag you down to the depths. 

Focus on the mundane, focus on the real.
Keep reaching out, do not give in to the void, it's not calmness and rest, it's nothingness, it's lack of being. And you'll just turn into a hollow shell, all scooped out and ready to be worn by whatever the broken rules allow, fucked up and ready to mingle.

If you can, get a pet, your reality and theirs reinforces one another, two entities stand out more than one. The awareness required to take good care of your pet will make you a stronger observer.
And if you get really good and want to start kicking back? You're already 50% of the way to a familiar.

But for now?
Look around, asses how real you still are. I'm warning you, you won't like what you find. You're propably leas real than you thought. And I'm sorry,  knowing is te only way to get better. But it's also the worst way to stay hidden.

The ones that have already slipped away will become jealous. Your childhood buddy will contact you soon, don't meet up.

P.S. If you live in the Appalachians? I can't help you, all you can do is get out now. Whatever drain I was talking about? You're stuck in a fucking metaphorical whirlpool.

I learned this the hard way. : Stop Chasing Motivation, Start Building ""Momentum Triggers"" instead 🚀","**Striving for 1% Better? I learned this the hard way! 🚀**

Hey, friends! Have you ever found yourself sitting on your couch, scrolling through motivational quotes on Instagram, but still feeling like a sloth in a blanket? Yeah, me too. 🙈 I used to chase motivation like it was the golden snitch, only to realize that I was missing the bigger picture. What if I told you there’s a way to *stop waiting to feel motivated* and start taking action instead?  

Enter: **Momentum Triggers.** These are little actions or habits that set off a chain reaction of productivity, and they’re much easier than you think! ✨

**Here’s what I’ve learned about building momentum:**

- **Focus on the 1%:** It’s not about making giant leaps. Just aim for becoming 1% better than yesterday. Want to write more? Try writing just one sentence a day. Procrastinating on exercise? How about just one push-up? 🏋️‍♂️

- **Identify your triggers:** What small things get you moving? For me, it's playing my hype playlist while making coffee. That cue gets me to start my day on the right note!

- **Make it easy:** Want to read more? Keep a book by your pillow instead of scrolling on your phone at night. Small tweaks to your environment can have a BIG impact!

- **Celebrate the wins:** Did you do one push-up? High-five yourself! Small wins are the fuel to keep that momentum going. 🚀

- **Be kind to yourself:** Some days, you won't feel like doing anything—and that’s okay! Motivation ebbs and flows like the tide. Remember, you don’t have to be perfect; just be consistent. ☁️

**Here’s the kicker:** It’s easy to get overwhelmed with all the *shoulds* and the *musts*. But if you shift your focus to just getting started—no matter how small—you'll be surprised at how quickly you can build that momentum!

**A little story for you:**

Not too long ago, I decided I wanted to get back into running (ha, I know, typical). I made a grand plan, mapped out my route, and then... didn't run for weeks. 😩 Then I tried just putting my running shoes by the door. One day, I tripped over them and just *had* to go for a jog—even if it was a slow, painful shuffle! 

That *one* run turned into a two-week streak because I found my momentum trigger! Now, running is a part of my routine, and I hardly need the motivation anymore. It’s just what I do! 🏃‍♀️💨

So, if you're feeling stuck in the rut of motivation-chasing, maybe it's time to dig into those momentum triggers. You may just find that the secret isn’t in the chase but in the habits that follow. 

What's your favorite “momentum trigger”? Or maybe you have an epic fail story about motivation? Let’s hear it! 🍿",1,1755472451.0,MaximizeMe,0,1.0,False

Hi. I’m the guy your therapist warned you about — not because I’m trouble, but because I want it all: deep talks, real connection, and yes, passion that could fog up windows. But first, let’s see if we vibe.

If you’re brilliant, beautiful, a little complex, and craving something real, keep reading.

1. Perfectly Imperfect Is Perfect.

I don’t want a “perfect” woman — I want someone real. If you’ve been through things, if you carry stories and scars, if trust doesn’t come easy… good. That means what we build will be earned, and real.

And if you ever say “you make me feel safe” while wearing my hoodie — I’m done for.

2. Passion Matters.

I love a woman who speaks with fire, kisses with intention, and isn’t afraid of intensity. Let’s have coffee that turns into hours of conversation… and maybe a kiss or two when neither of us wants the night to end.

3. Affection > Distance.

I don’t do “casual disappearing acts.” I want forehead kisses, morning texts, hugs that last too long, and that energy that says “you’re my person.”

Be clingy, but in the cutest way. I’ll match it.

4. Smart Is Sexy.

Brains turn me on. If you can challenge me, teach me something new, or debate me into a laugh — I’m hooked. Talk nerdy to me, argue passionately, and let’s turn late-night conversations into memories.

5. Banter = Chemistry.

I want more than sparks. I want the playful fights, the inside jokes, the kind of laughter that makes you snort. If we can tease each other and still end up holding hands after, that’s chemistry.

Final Thoughts (Before You Slide Into My Life)

I want a woman who’s bold, brilliant, affectionate, and real. Someone who loves deeply, laughs loudly, and maybe drives me a little crazy in the best way possible.

If you’re looking for the same — let’s talk, let’s laugh, and maybe start something unforgettable.",1,1755472409.0,u_A_M_E_S_,0,1.0,False

Trying to squeeze the events and context from the last month into one post was hard, there’s so much more I could say. I have another post up on a different sub that talks about the basis of our trust issues, feel free to read. I want to make it clear that I don’t skirt away from owning my actions. I took full accountability for them then and I still do now. I’ve done considerable work to become a better person, understand my own attachment style, unpack all of my previous trauma and focus on being a good person/partner/mum. And for a long time I thought my ex and I were on the same page with reconciliation, because they told me so. Because he told me that he could tell I acted out of a place of pain and self loathing and not in an attempt to hurt him. And while we both know intention doesn’t erase impact, we both decided to stay together and reconcile properly. I went to therapy, he spoke to support counsellors and we both put the effort into making the relationship a safe place for both of us. And up until the events of 4 weeks ago I genuinely thought we would spend the rest of our lives together completely in love, which is something he actively reassured me about. The feelings I’m expressing here aren’t an attempt to erase what I did, or make our pain a competition. I just need advice on how to move on from this because I feel like my entire world has been shattered and I don’t know what to do.

Need advice on how to navigate this please, I feel so helpless and stuck. My ex and I were together for 11 years, we rent a house together and have 2 young children. 5 weeks ago I would’ve told you we were completely in love, the picture of a perfect couple. He even re-proposed last year on our 10 year anniversary, 6 weeks ago we celebrated our 11th. We were actively planning on buying a house, planning overseas vacations as a family, everything seemed completely fine. And then 4 weeks ago he got weird, started staying late after work to go for drinks with his friends, would come home hours late and excuse it as him stressing over money/being behind on bills. And then one night he said he was coming home after work, ghosted me and didn’t reply for hours and came back hours later, he told me he had been cheating. Had an emotional affair with a coworker and they had feelings for each other. Said he felt extremely guilty and couldn’t figure out why he would do such a thing, because I’m the love of his life and he wants to spend the rest of our lives together. He said he hates himself for what he’s done. He said he needed to take some space to try and understand his actions, and spend the next week sleeping on the lounge.

I tried so hard to remind him that he was loved, that we could work through it together. He agreed to text his coworker that he didn’t return her feelings and it was over, I later found out he never stopped seeing her at all. Exactly a week after he told me about her, after spending literally every day that week reassuring me that he loves me and we’d always be together, it all went to shit.

He rang me after work (7:30pm) and said he was coming straight home, so I expected to see him no later than 9pm. It got to 9:30 and I hadn’t heard from him, sent a text and he didn’t reply. And it just kept going on, hours went by and I didn’t hear a word. I had honestly started to convince myself that he’d hurt himself because of the guilt (it’s something he’s spoken about before), and I panicked. I tried saying anything I could to get through to him hoping he’d remember he had a family ah home that loved him, it was near midnight by now. And then he put his phone on do not disturb, and I spiralled even more. I figured out his password to the laptop, saw his location was at some random house near his work, and I knew he was with her. Checked his emails and saw that all the times he was working late or going got drinks he was actually at her house. I was devastated, but still tried to convince him to come home. He eventually messaged me back, around 3am, to tell me to stop trying to talk to him, he wasn’t coming home, and then left it at that.

He went straight to work from her house that day, and didn’t come home until after 10pm that night. And he sat me down and told me it was over. He hadn’t been in love with me for a while, and had been trying to fake his way through it. It was done.

The next few weeks have been an emotional roller coaster. For the first 2 weeks after he ended it, he’d avoid being home at all costs, would only show up when it was his time to take the kids to school/pick up and be either at her house or with his friends every night. I’d call him out on it, tell him he needed to be home more for the kids regardless of what our relationship status was, and he’d defend it by saying his behaviour wasn’t impacting the kids so he really didn’t care what I thought about it.

I was a fucking wreck. I couldn’t sleep for weeks, I barely ate to the point I lost an unhealthy amount of weight. I’d have panic attacks daily, and he witnessed some of these and just stood back and watched as I choked on my own vomit heaped up on the ground. It really was like he flipped a switch and had zero love left for me at all. But then when the kids were home he’d switch back and act as if literally nothing was wrong and he was completely happy.

Our conversations ended up being one of two things. One, I’d be emotional and tell him how he was making me feel, point out he he was actively hurting me and I wasn’t coping, and he’s respond with cruelty. Some of the things he said to me I will never I hear. Some that stand out are “you’ve emotionally manipulated me for years, so now I’m doing what I want to make myself happy”. “I don’t owe you shit”. “I haven’t loved you for years”. “You should go out and find someone for yourself, I hope you have fun, I hope they split you in half”. “I’m not sorry for what I’ve done, I should’ve left you ages ago”. He’s told me that anytime I ever panicked, or sent him an emotionally charged text, that I was manipulating him into staying with me. He said that I’ve been self absorbed for years, only cared about my own feelings, and ignored him when he asked for help. That ie as always neglectful and manipulative.

And the other times he was soft and vulnerable. He’d tell me that I’ll always be the love of his life, but our relationship wasn’t working and we both deserved better. He’d say he’s sorry for what he’s done, and he does feel guilty and wished he’d had the courage to tell me how he was feeling before he met someone else so this wouldn’t have been so hurtful. He’d sit there and cry as he reminisced about all the beautiful things we’ve shared. He’d assure me that he’ll never love anyone the way he loved me, but he was scared of being hurt again and couldn’t be with me again no matter how much he missed me. He’d promise to be home more, and to be more respectful with his behaviour. He’d say he wants me in his life, he doesn’t want to be toxic coparents and wants us to be friends, because he genuinely enjoys my company and doesn’t want to lose that.

Each time, whether it be a fight or a deep conversation, he’d act like everything was normal the next day. He keeps swapping between cold/distant and soft/friendly and I can’t work out what’s real.

I have worked out though that the cold/distant side of him only comes out when I talk about my feelings, ask him not to do something because it’s hurting me, or even mention being upset that he’s still with her. I’ve been trying so hard to keep my feelings to myself, writing unsent letters to him on paper instead of sending texts. But then he’ll sit down with me and ask me how I’m feeling and it’ll all pour out anyway.

Neither one of us are in the position financially to move out right now, so we’re stuck in this house together. The kids still don’t know we’ve broken up. We both agreed at the start that we needed to be careful about when and how we told them, that it wouldn’t be fair for us to drop a bombshell and then one of us suddenly move out. He knows I’m still in love with him and would gladly take him back, he said he’ll be patient with me as I get through this and support me how he can, but that he can’t be there for me romantically anymore, only as a friend.

At first I think I was waiting to tell the kids until I’d come to terms with what was happening. Like, how am I going to sit them down and break their hearts over a divorce I want zero part in and don’t believe in? But I’m starting to think we haven’t told them because then he’d have to face the hard part that comes with a break up, he’d have to move out/juggle custody and it’d impact his new bachelor lifestyle.

A few days ago I told him that I’m happy to try and be actual friends with him. Not just because I want the kids growing up with 2 parents who can’t be in the same room as each other, but because he’s always been my best friend and I don’t want to lose that. I also told him that I think he’s only saying ‘let’s be friends’ because it’s convenient for him. I told him that he was using me for occasional company or emotional support, knowing that I’m at home 90% of the time taking care of the kids while he go to go out and move on with his life. I pointed out that conversation doesn’t happen unless I initiate, he can go a whole day ignoring me even when I ask something related to the kids, and that it wasn’t fair and I didn’t deserve it. He apologised and said he recognises that he hasn’t been fair, and promised to do better.

He went out for an early birthday celebration with his family and friends on Saturday. I didn’t tell him this but it absolutely gutted me that I wasn’t there, first birthday in eleven years that I wasn’t included in. His entire family have gone no contact with me through all of this which hurts me deeply, and I can only imagine the things he’s told them to justify leaving me in the brutal way he did. When he did come home afterwards he told me “I won’t lie, it did feel really strange for you not to be there, it felt weird”.

Yesterday we spent the afternoon together at home with the kids. I was sitting in what used to be our room, and he came in and told me that he’s been reading the letters I had written/stashed away. He said in one of our fights I’d pointed out that there was a time when he wanted to know what was going on in my mind, so he read them so he could know. He said that some of them he could tell were written in anger, but that he understood I was just processing my feelings so he didn’t hold those words against me.

We then had a very long, calm but occasionally tearful, conversation. And it really felt like the most honesty I’ve gotten from him since this all happened, like I was talking to the man I knew 5 weeks ago and not the one that abandoned me.

He’s acknowledged that his behaviour hasn’t been fair to me, and he spoke about the feelings or fear that led to it. I spoke about the feelings and fear I feel that drive the long paragraphs/letters I send him. We spoke a lot about our past relationship, and both acknowledged where we went wrong, both owned up to the patterns and behaviours that broke us.

We spoke about how we’re in 2 different places right now. He reaffirmed that he genuinely doesn’t want to be together again, too much pain has occurred and he can’t let himself be loved by me. He also acknowledged that he’s aware I’m still in love with him, and has been cautious of his behaviour so he doesn’t give me false hope.

We spoke about the hope I still carry for reconciliation. We spoke about our motivations for cheating, we spoke about how it made the other feel. We spoke about our behaviour after conflict, both in the relationship and after. There was a lot of accountability, a lot of apology, but ultimately he’s not willing to be together again, he wants to be happy. And he said he wants me to be happy too, he wants me to find someone that loves me enough to trust me, and he can’t be that person.

We spoke about wanting to remain friends, and what the realistically looks like. He’s worried that being friends will make it harder for me to let him go. I told him that losing him completely will intensify the loss I’m feeling, and will potentially make me chase him harder. But if we stay friends, I still get to keep the best parts of him and try and work on myself too. I told him I want to get to where he is, where I’m able to let go of that hope and appreciate the friendship we have rather than mourn what I lost.

We set boundaries for how we communicate in future, and contingency plans for when we break them. He has been getting very overwhelmed with the giant walls of texts I send him. I’ve agreed that if I feel the need to share such a massive amount of feelings that I’ll write a note in my phone and share it with him, so he can respond bit by bit. He’s agreed that if I do send him a giant paragraph and he hasn’t got the time, or isn’t in the space, to read it that he’ll acknowledge it and tell me he’ll respond later so I don’t feel ignored. I asked if we could set aside more time to talk throughout the week so I don’t feel like he’s closed off from me, he agreed. I asked him to not ignore me when I reach out to him, and he’s agreed to let me know if he’s too busy to respond but he’ll tell me that he’ll call me later, and he’s agreed to follow through with that.

He’s agreed to make set nights for him to go out vs be home so I’m not blindsided by it, and he’s working to change his work roster so I can have nights off too.

He’s worried that us doing things as friends will lead me on or give me false hope. We’ve clarified that talking throughout the day, watching a movie at home, going out for a coffee etc isn’t crossing a line and is something that friends do.

Ideally we both want to get to the point of friendship where we’re both comfortable talking to the other about our future romantic lives. Where it’s not weird or uncomfortable if we meet someone else. I said I want us to be like ‘Will and Grace’ except he’s straight, and he said he wants that too. I said I want us to get to the point where we feel comfortable defending the friendship to friends and family should they have negative opinions towards the other, mainly his mother, and he said he wants that too but acknowledges it won’t happen overnight.

I want to let him go in a romantic sense, and let me heart give him up so it doesn’t hurt too not have him with me. I want to be his friend, because we have the potential to be great friends (same interests/humour/bond/easy to talk with/enjoy the others company), and I want our children to see us happy and respectful with each other.

After the kids went to bed we sat on the lounge and watched one of our shows, and chatted like old times, and it felt so good to be around him again. I don’t know how to get past the jealousy or feeling of being replaced when I can tell he’s texting her, or the nights he go’s out with her. I feel like I keep waiting for him to run back home and apologise for what he’s done and actually mean it.

But last night when I went to bed, I stumbled across this subreddit and realised that he is most likely dismissive avoidant and so many things clicked into place. All the shut downs, all the withdrawal, all the defensiveness. And so many things I read on here told me that I can’t change him, I can’t make him want to change, and he might not ever fully face the destruction he caused. But then I started second guessing myself and thought what if he isn’t dismissive or avoidant at all, what if I genuinely was just an anxious and overbearing partner and I pushed him to this? What if him suddenly switching off his feelings and walking away as I was crumpled on the ground wasn’t avoidant at all, what if it was the long overdue consequence of what I did? What if he genuinely doesn’t care that he’s hurt me now?

I don’t want to spend the rest of my life waiting for him to take accountability, but I don’t want to lose him out of my life (I can’t, because he’s been a shitty partner but he’s such an amazing dad).

So I don’t know where to go from here. Is this potential friendship real, or is it just me not being able to let go? Does he even want to be friends, or his he avoiding facing what he’s done? Will he stay with this coworker and never come back to me? Do I have to accept that because of what I did? I feel like I’ve been in a constant state of panic since this happened, and I can’t make sense of what’s real or not.

I just can’t make my mind believe that the same man who held me sobbing in the bathtub 5 months ago as I miscarried what could’ve been our baby, could be the same man that doesn’t flinch when I cry now.

TL;DR: My long-distance boyfriend and I were in a relationship. I got diagnosed with a potentially cancerous tumor, he quit his job to care for me, and now he's blaming me for his financial struggles and job loss after I broke up with him.
I (19F) met my boyfriend (24M) online; we are both Indians and were in a long-distance relationship. We wanted to settle in Europe, so he moved to Slovenia after getting a job, and 1½ years later, I moved to Germany for my apprenticeship (""ausbildung""). During my first week in Germany, I got diagnosed with a tumor in my hand that could possibly be cancerous. I immediately wanted to break up with him because I didn't want him to feel burdened by my health issues. However, he refused and said he wanted to support me, which he now claims was a joke. I asked him if he could come to Germany to support me, but I didn't force him; he could have said no. I might have pushed him a bit to come as fast as he could, as he had promised he would always be there. He came to Germany to care for me. I was touched by his gesture, but I felt guilty knowing that he was sacrificing a lot for me.

Things got more complicated. He has some drinking issues, and a few times at night, when he was super drunk, he tried to leave Germany and drive back to Slovenia. I stopped him because I was worried about his safety. Due to all the pressure and to stop him from leaving like that after a stupid fight, I cut my wrist. This led to him starting to smoke cigarettes, and he blamed me, saying my suicide attempt gave him so much stress. He even smoked in our room when I had severe nausea from chemo. He promised to quit once he got back to Slovenia. Now, he's blaming me for stopping him and says I shouldn't have cared if he died. He claims I've betrayed him and his family. He also hit me during this time and fought a lot when he was drunk, but I forgave it because he was only like that when he drank. At other times, he was loving and cared for me so much—he even bathed me, fed me, and hugged me to sleep.

Fast forward to when I had to go back to India to continue my treatment as I couldn't bear the chemo alone and needed my parents. He lost his job but luckily got a new offer in Germany and had to come back to Slovenia to finalize some paperwork. I thought everything was okay, but after a few months, he couldn't get that job, his visa was annulled, and he came back to India. Now he has another job offer in Slovenia, but he's blaming me for ruining his life. He says I have ruined his career and caused him debt and that I should have gone back to India immediately without waiting for biopsy results. I'm feeling really guilty and conflicted. I asked him to come to Germany because I needed his support, but I feel like he could have said no. He made those decisions on his own. He's even bringing my dad into our conversations and talking bad about him. I'm at a loss for what to do.

Update: Despite everything, I still have feelings for him, and I appreciate the help he provided when I was alone in Germany during a really tough time. However, his current behavior is causing me a lot of stress, and I'm not sure if I can handle being in a relationship with someone who blames me like this, especially given his drinking issues.

Update 2: I have completed my treatment and am trying to recover from the side effects. I have tried to make things work a lot, but I feel like I should stop this relationship because I don't want him to feel burdened by my health issues. Recently, a few other problems also arose. He wanted me to convert to Christianity, which I had already told him I wouldn't do at the beginning of the relationship. He also wanted me to move back to Germany or Slovenia, which I don't think is good for my health. I denied both and told him we should stop this and just be friends. I even offered to help him return to Slovenia, not financially, but by dealing with paperwork and providing guidance. We tried it for a few days, still calling each other and sleeping while talking at night, and then patched up again. This happened a few times.

Yesterday, he got drunk again and had a physical fight with his dad. I was mad about it but didn't fight with him or lecture him until he repeatedly pushed me to ask what happened. He then told me he wanted to stop drinking and asked me to help him, and I suggested he see a doctor, which he agreed to. Then in the evening, he pranked me, saying he had been taken into custody by the police. He sent me a video of himself searching for something, looking tense, without any explanation. I got super worried and stressed. When I called him as usual to go to sleep, he told me it was all a prank. I told him I felt tense and wanted to go to the hospital to check my pressure and that I might sleep in my mom's room because it would calm me down. He reacted by saying, ""Then why did you call me? I know you're like this; you always want to sleep with your mom, you don't care about me and all."" It's partially true because I'm not comfortable talking to him these days as I'm too stressed to deal with his drama.

I changed the topic to avoid an argument, but he brought up a boy who was in the same class as me in Germany. I told him I had a feeling the boy was gay because he acted like a girly girl with girls and was kind of touchy with boys, as I had once witnessed him sitting on another boy's lap. I also added that he used to sit next to me because our seating was arranged by the teacher and that he once drank my coffee and shared a sandwich with me. This angered him because I hadn't told him before, as I never felt it was important. He made a fuss about it, saying it was unfair that I had never mentioned it, especially since he had hidden from me that he was not his first girlfriend, even when I saw a screenshot of their chats on his phone. I don't really care if he had a girlfriend before me, but the fact he hid it for almost 3 years is not cool. Still, I didn't make a scene about it because it was in the past. He also mentioned that a friend of mine had said something negative about me. The fact that he believed this person over me, without ever raising the issue, was what truly upset me. I have always had complete faith in him and never believed rumors or negativity about him, and his lack of trust in me felt like a betrayal. This was a new piece of information for me, and it unleashed all my frustrations.
I exploded with rage, pouring out my real feelings about him and this whole situation. I have always let go of his behavior, all the cussing, gaslighting, and manipulations. He even claims that my diagnosis gave him so much stress that it's the cause of his drinking habit. He also says casually that he is using ""Cool Lip,"" a smokeless tobacco product, which I am really against. When I get angry or cry, he says it's just a prank and that he hasn't done it, without any proof, which really stresses me out. I have always ended the fights first because I thought a person in a relationship should let go of their ego and seek peace. I said sorry even when it was his fault; I begged him to stay and even forgave him for insulting my parents. I did all of this just because I loved him and what he did for me was huge. But whenever a fight escalates, he always brings up the fact that he had to care for me and lost everything for me, which is a form of guilt-tripping.

I have finally come to my senses and stopped silently enduring all this. I've talked back and told him not to try to scare me this time, as he sometimes blackmails me by saying he's going to call my dad and tell him to pay for taking care of me and to insult me. This time, I'm totally done and told him to do whatever he wants and that I will not change my decision. I don't know if he will call me later and ask me to stay or guilt-trip me more. I admit that he does this even when he is sober. He always blames me for every tiny mistake I make carelessly when helping him with paperwork, as his English is not good. He also accused me of making his job opportunity difficult because I am the only one making mistakes. Yes, I am the only one making mistakes because I am the only one doing anything. He never does anything, even if it's something a teenager can do. I only have a high school qualification, and he is a diploma holder, yet even while I am undergoing chemo, he insists that I fill out forms and write emails for him.

Edit: I'm still dealing with my health issues, and this situation is taking a toll on me. I'm looking for advice or stories from others who might have gone through something similar. How did you handle it? Should I prioritize my own well-being and end the relationship, or is there a way to work through this together?

Disclaimer: 
Incredibly long post incoming. Trying to squeeze the events and context from the last month into one post was hard, there’s so much more I could say. 
I have another post up on a different sub that talks about the basis of our trust issues, feel free to read. I want to make it clear that I don’t skirt away from owning my actions. I took full accountability for them then and I still do now. I’ve done considerable work to become a better person, understand my own attachment style, unpack all of my previous trauma and focus on being a good person/partner/mum. And for a long time I thought my ex and I were on the same page with reconciliation, because they told me so. Because he told me that he could tell I acted out of a place of pain and self loathing and not in an attempt to hurt him. And while we both know intention doesn’t erase impact, we both decided to stay together and reconcile properly. I went to therapy, he spoke to support counsellors and we both put the effort into making the relationship a safe place for both of us. And up until the events of 4 weeks ago I genuinely thought we would spend the rest of our lives together completely in love, which is something he actively reassured me about. 
The feelings I’m expressing here aren’t an attempt to erase what I did, or make our pain a competition. I just need advice on how to move on from this because I feel like my entire world has been shattered and I don’t know what to do. 



Need advice on how to navigate this please, I feel so helpless and stuck. 
My ex and I were together for 11 years, we rent a house together and have 2 young children. 
5 weeks ago I would’ve told you we were completely in love, the picture of a perfect couple. He even re-proposed last year on our 10 year anniversary, 6 weeks ago we celebrated our 11th. We were actively planning on buying a house, planning overseas vacations as a family, everything seemed completely fine. 
And then 4 weeks ago he got weird, started staying late after work to go for drinks with his friends, would come home hours late and excuse it as him stressing over money/being behind on bills. 
And then one night he said he was coming home after work, ghosted me and didn’t reply for hours and came back hours later, he told me he had been cheating. Had an emotional affair with a coworker and they had feelings for each other. Said he felt extremely guilty and couldn’t figure out why he would do such a thing, because I’m the love of his life and he wants to spend the rest of our lives together. He said he hates himself for what he’s done. He said he needed to take some space to try and understand his actions, and spend the next week sleeping on the lounge. 

I tried so hard to remind him that he was loved, that we could work through it together. He agreed to text his coworker that he didn’t return her feelings and it was over, I later found out he never stopped seeing her at all. 
Exactly a week after he told me about her, after spending literally every day that week reassuring me that he loves me and we’d always be together, it all went to shit. 

He rang me after work (7:30pm) and said he was coming straight home, so I expected to see him no later than 9pm. It got to 9:30 and I hadn’t heard from him, sent a text and he didn’t reply. And it just kept going on, hours went by and I didn’t hear a word. I had honestly started to convince myself that he’d hurt himself because of the guilt (it’s something he’s spoken about before), and I panicked. I tried saying anything I could to get through to him hoping he’d remember he had a family ah home that loved him, it was near midnight by now. And then he put his phone on do not disturb, and I spiralled even more. 
I figured out his password to the laptop, saw his location was at some random house near his work, and I knew he was with her. Checked his emails and saw that all the times he was working late or going got drinks he was actually at her house. I was devastated, but still tried to convince him to come home. 
He eventually messaged me back, around 3am, to tell me to stop trying to talk to him, he wasn’t coming home, and then left it at that. 

He went straight to work from her house that day, and didn’t come home until after 10pm that night. And he sat me down and told me it was over. He hadn’t been in love with me for a while, and had been trying to fake his way through it. It was done. 

The next few weeks have been an emotional roller coaster. For the first 2 weeks after he ended it, he’d avoid being home at all costs, would only show up when it was his time to take the kids to school/pick up and be either at her house or with his friends every night. I’d call him out on it, tell him he needed to be home more for the kids regardless of what our relationship status was, and he’d defend it by saying his behaviour wasn’t impacting the kids so he really didn’t care what I thought about it.

I was a fucking wreck. I couldn’t sleep for weeks, I barely ate to the point I lost an unhealthy amount of weight. I’d have panic attacks daily, and he witnessed some of these and just stood back and watched as I choked on my own vomit heaped up on the ground. It really was like he flipped a switch and had zero love left for me at all. But then when the kids were home he’d switch back and act as if literally nothing was wrong and he was completely happy. 

Our conversations ended up being one of two things. One, I’d be emotional and tell him how he was making me feel, point out he he was actively hurting me and I wasn’t coping, and he’s respond with cruelty. Some of the things he said to me I will never I hear. Some that stand out are “you’ve emotionally manipulated me for years, so now I’m doing what I want to make myself happy”. “I don’t owe you shit”. “I haven’t loved you for years”. “You should go out and find someone for yourself, I hope you have fun, I hope they split you in half”. “I’m not sorry for what I’ve done, I should’ve left you ages ago”. He’s told me that anytime I ever panicked, or sent him an emotionally charged text, that I was manipulating him into staying with me. He said that I’ve been self absorbed for years, only cared about my own feelings, and ignored him when he asked for help. That ie as always neglectful and manipulative. 

And the other times he was soft and vulnerable. He’d tell me that I’ll always be the love of his life, but our relationship wasn’t working and we both deserved better. He’d say he’s sorry for what he’s done, and he does feel guilty and wished he’d had the courage to tell me how he was feeling before he met someone else so this wouldn’t have been so hurtful. He’d sit there and cry as he reminisced about all the beautiful things we’ve shared. He’d assure me that he’ll never love anyone the way he loved me, but he was scared of being hurt again and couldn’t be with me again no matter how much he missed me. He’d promise to be home more, and to be more respectful with his behaviour. He’d say he wants me in his life, he doesn’t want to be toxic coparents and wants us to be friends, because he genuinely enjoys my company and doesn’t want to lose that. 

Each time, whether it be a fight or a deep conversation, he’d act like everything was normal the next day. He keeps swapping between cold/distant and soft/friendly and I can’t work out what’s real. 

I have worked out though that the cold/distant side of him only comes out when I talk about my feelings, ask him not to do something because it’s hurting me, or even mention being upset that he’s still with her. 
I’ve been trying so hard to keep my feelings to myself, writing unsent letters to him on paper instead of sending texts. But then he’ll sit down with me and ask me how I’m feeling and it’ll all pour out anyway. 

Neither one of us are in the position financially to move out right now, so we’re stuck in this house together. The kids still don’t know we’ve broken up. We both agreed at the start that we needed to be careful about when and how we told them, that it wouldn’t be fair for us to drop a bombshell and then one of us suddenly move out. He knows I’m still in love with him and would gladly take him back, he said he’ll be patient with me as I get through this and support me how he can, but that he can’t be there for me romantically anymore, only as a friend. 

At first I think I was waiting to tell the kids until I’d come to terms with what was happening. Like, how am I going to sit them down and break their hearts over a divorce I want zero part in and don’t believe in? But I’m starting to think we haven’t told them because then he’d have to face the hard part that comes with a break up, he’d have to move out/juggle custody and it’d impact his new bachelor lifestyle. 

A few days ago I told him that I’m happy to try and be actual friends with him. Not just because I want the kids growing up with 2 parents who can’t be in the same room as each other, but because he’s always been my best friend and I don’t want to lose that. I also told him that I think he’s only saying ‘let’s be friends’ because it’s convenient for him. I told him that he was using me for occasional company or emotional support, knowing that I’m at home 90% of the time taking care of the kids while he go to go out and move on with his life. I pointed out that conversation doesn’t happen unless I initiate, he can go a whole day ignoring me even when I ask something related to the kids, and that it wasn’t fair and I didn’t deserve it. He apologised and said he recognises that he hasn’t been fair, and promised to do better. 

He went out for an early birthday celebration with his family and friends on Saturday. I didn’t tell him this but it absolutely gutted me that I wasn’t there, first birthday in eleven years that I wasn’t included in. His entire family have gone no contact with me through all of this which hurts me deeply, and I can only imagine the things he’s told them to justify leaving me in the brutal way he did. When he did come home afterwards he told me “I won’t lie, it did feel really strange for you not to be there, it felt weird”. 

Yesterday we spent the afternoon together at home with the kids. I was sitting in what used to be our room, and he came in and told me that he’s been reading the letters I had written/stashed away. He said in one of our fights I’d pointed out that there was a time when he wanted to know what was going on in my mind, so he read them so he could know. He said that some of them he could tell were written in anger, but that he understood I was just processing my feelings so he didn’t hold those words against me.

We then had a very long, calm but occasionally tearful, conversation. And it really felt like the most honesty I’ve gotten from him since this all happened, like I was talking to the man I knew 5 weeks ago and not the one that abandoned me. 

He’s acknowledged that his behaviour hasn’t been fair to me, and he spoke about the feelings or fear that led to it. I spoke about the feelings and fear I feel that drive the long paragraphs/letters I send him. 
We spoke a lot about our past relationship, and both acknowledged where we went wrong, both owned up to the patterns and behaviours that broke us. 

We spoke about how we’re in 2 different places right now. He reaffirmed that he genuinely doesn’t want to be together again, too much pain has occurred and he can’t let himself be loved by me. He also acknowledged that he’s aware I’m still in love with him, and has been cautious of his behaviour so he doesn’t give me false hope. 

We spoke about the hope I still carry for reconciliation. We spoke about our motivations for cheating, we spoke about how it made the other feel. We spoke about our behaviour after conflict, both in the relationship and after. There was a lot of accountability, a lot of apology, but ultimately he’s not willing to be together again, he wants to be happy. And he said he wants me to be happy too, he wants me to find someone that loves me enough to trust me, and he can’t be that person. 

We spoke about wanting to remain friends, and what the realistically looks like. He’s worried that being friends will make it harder for me to let him go. I told him that losing him completely will intensify the loss I’m feeling, and will potentially make me chase him harder. But if we stay friends, I still get to keep the best parts of him and try and work on myself too. I told him I want to get to where he is, where I’m able to let go of that hope and appreciate the friendship we have rather than mourn what I lost. 

We set boundaries for how we communicate in future, and contingency plans for when we break them. He has been getting very overwhelmed with the giant walls of texts I send him. I’ve agreed that if I feel the need to share such a massive amount of feelings that I’ll write a note in my phone and share it with him, so he can respond bit by bit. He’s agreed that if I do send him a giant paragraph and he hasn’t got the time, or isn’t in the space, to read it that he’ll acknowledge it and tell me he’ll respond later so I don’t feel ignored. 
I asked if we could set aside more time to talk throughout the week so I don’t feel like he’s closed off from me, he agreed. I asked him to not ignore me when I reach out to him, and he’s agreed to let me know if he’s too busy to respond but he’ll tell me that he’ll call me later, and he’s agreed to follow through with that. 

He’s agreed to make set nights for him to go out vs be home so I’m not blindsided by it, and he’s working to change his work roster so I can have nights off too. 

He’s worried that us doing things as friends will lead me on or give me false hope. We’ve clarified that talking throughout the day, watching a movie at home, going out for a coffee etc isn’t crossing a line and is something that friends do. 

Ideally we both want to get to the point of friendship where we’re both comfortable talking to the other about our future romantic lives. Where it’s not weird or uncomfortable if we meet someone else. I said I want us to be like ‘Will and Grace’ except he’s straight, and he said he wants that too. I said I want us to get to the point where we feel comfortable defending the friendship to friends and family should they have negative opinions towards the other, mainly his mother, and he said he wants that too but acknowledges it won’t happen overnight. 

I want to let him go in a romantic sense, and let me heart give him up so it doesn’t hurt too not have him with me. I want to be his friend, because we have the potential to be great friends (same interests/humour/bond/easy to talk with/enjoy the others company), and I want our children to see us happy and respectful with each other. 

After the kids went to bed we sat on the lounge and watched one of our shows, and chatted like old times, and it felt so good to be around him again. I don’t know how to get past the jealousy or feeling of being replaced when I can tell he’s texting her, or the nights he go’s out with her. I feel like I keep waiting for him to run back home and apologise for what he’s done and actually mean it. 

But last night when I went to bed, I stumbled across this subreddit and realised that he is most likely dismissive avoidant and so many things clicked into place. All the shut downs, all the withdrawal, all the defensiveness. And so many things I read on here told me that I can’t change him, I can’t make him want to change, and he might not ever fully face the destruction he caused. But then I started second guessing myself and thought what if he isn’t dismissive or avoidant at all, what if I genuinely was just an anxious and overbearing partner and I pushed him to this? What if him suddenly switching off his feelings and walking away as I was crumpled on the ground wasn’t avoidant at all, what if it was the long overdue consequence of what I did? What if he genuinely doesn’t care that he’s hurt me now? 

I don’t want to spend the rest of my life waiting for him to take accountability, but I don’t want to lose him out of my life (I can’t, because he’s been a shitty partner but he’s such an amazing dad). 

So I don’t know where to go from here. 
Is this potential friendship real, or is it just me not being able to let go? Does he even want to be friends, or his he avoiding facing what he’s done? Will he stay with this coworker and never come back to me? Do I have to accept that because of what I did?
I feel like I’ve been in a constant state of panic since this happened, and I can’t make sense of what’s real or not. 

I just can’t make my mind believe that the same man who held me sobbing in the bathtub 5 months ago as I miscarried what could’ve been our baby, could be the same man that doesn’t flinch when I cry now.

It’s small and cozy but there’s plenty of wall spaces with no decor and it’s just missing a professional touch and better lighting. As mentioned we are a small mom and pop shop so looking to not break the bank, I’ve seen online to reach out to students or beginners in the business and that’s what I’m looking for! Anybody out there that fits the description?? Thanks!!

1mt5ih9,https://www.reddit.com/r/AITH/comments/1mt5ih9/aitah_for_breaking_up_with_my_boyfriend_after_he/,AITAH for breaking up with my boyfriend after he accused me of ruining his entire life for the umpteenth time? Advice Needed,"TL;DR: My long-distance boyfriend and I were in a relationship. I got diagnosed with a potentially cancerous tumor, he quit his job to care for me, and now he's blaming me for his financial struggles and job loss after I broke up with him.
I (19F) met my boyfriend (24M) online; we are both Indians and were in a long-distance relationship. We wanted to settle in Europe, so he moved to Slovenia after getting a job, and 1½ years later, I moved to Germany for my apprenticeship (""ausbildung""). During my first week in Germany, I got diagnosed with a tumor in my hand that could possibly be cancerous. I immediately wanted to break up with him because I didn't want him to feel burdened by my health issues. However, he refused and said he wanted to support me, which he now claims was a joke. I asked him if he could come to Germany to support me, but I didn't force him; he could have said no. I might have pushed him a bit to come as fast as he could, as he had promised he would always be there. He came to Germany to care for me. I was touched by his gesture, but I felt guilty knowing that he was sacrificing a lot for me.

Things got more complicated. He has some drinking issues, and a few times at night, when he was super drunk, he tried to leave Germany and drive back to Slovenia. I stopped him because I was worried about his safety. Due to all the pressure and to stop him from leaving like that after a stupid fight, I cut my wrist. This led to him starting to smoke cigarettes, and he blamed me, saying my suicide attempt gave him so much stress. He even smoked in our room when I had severe nausea from chemo. He promised to quit once he got back to Slovenia. Now, he's blaming me for stopping him and says I shouldn't have cared if he died. He claims I've betrayed him and his family. He also hit me during this time and fought a lot when he was drunk, but I forgave it because he was only like that when he drank. At other times, he was loving and cared for me so much—he even bathed me, fed me, and hugged me to sleep.

Fast forward to when I had to go back to India to continue my treatment as I couldn't bear the chemo alone and needed my parents. He lost his job but luckily got a new offer in Germany and had to come back to Slovenia to finalize some paperwork. I thought everything was okay, but after a few months, he couldn't get that job, his visa was annulled, and he came back to India. Now he has another job offer in Slovenia, but he's blaming me for ruining his life. He says I have ruined his career and caused him debt and that I should have gone back to India immediately without waiting for biopsy results. I'm feeling really guilty and conflicted. I asked him to come to Germany because I needed his support, but I feel like he could have said no. He made those decisions on his own. He's even bringing my dad into our conversations and talking bad about him. I'm at a loss for what to do.

Update: Despite everything, I still have feelings for him, and I appreciate the help he provided when I was alone in Germany during a really tough time. However, his current behavior is causing me a lot of stress, and I'm not sure if I can handle being in a relationship with someone who blames me like this, especially given his drinking issues.

Update 2: I have completed my treatment and am trying to recover from the side effects. I have tried to make things work a lot, but I feel like I should stop this relationship because I don't want him to feel burdened by my health issues. Recently, a few other problems also arose. He wanted me to convert to Christianity, which I had already told him I wouldn't do at the beginning of the relationship. He also wanted me to move back to Germany or Slovenia, which I don't think is good for my health. I denied both and told him we should stop this and just be friends. I even offered to help him return to Slovenia, not financially, but by dealing with paperwork and providing guidance. We tried it for a few days, still calling each other and sleeping while talking at night, and then patched up again. This happened a few times.

Yesterday, he got drunk again and had a physical fight with his dad. I was mad about it but didn't fight with him or lecture him until he repeatedly pushed me to ask what happened. He then told me he wanted to stop drinking and asked me to help him, and I suggested he see a doctor, which he agreed to. Then in the evening, he pranked me, saying he had been taken into custody by the police. He sent me a video of himself searching for something, looking tense, without any explanation. I got super worried and stressed. When I called him as usual to go to sleep, he told me it was all a prank. I told him I felt tense and wanted to go to the hospital to check my pressure and that I might sleep in my mom's room because it would calm me down. He reacted by saying, ""Then why did you call me? I know you're like this; you always want to sleep with your mom, you don't care about me and all."" It's partially true because I'm not comfortable talking to him these days as I'm too stressed to deal with his drama.

I changed the topic to avoid an argument, but he brought up a boy who was in the same class as me in Germany. I told him I had a feeling the boy was gay because he acted like a girly girl with girls and was kind of touchy with boys, as I had once witnessed him sitting on another boy's lap. I also added that he used to sit next to me because our seating was arranged by the teacher and that he once drank my coffee and shared a sandwich with me. This angered him because I hadn't told him before, as I never felt it was important. He made a fuss about it, saying it was unfair that I had never mentioned it, especially since he had hidden from me that he was not his first girlfriend, even when I saw a screenshot of their chats on his phone. I don't really care if he had a girlfriend before me, but the fact he hid it for almost 3 years is not cool. Still, I didn't make a scene about it because it was in the past. He also mentioned that a friend of mine had said something negative about me. The fact that he believed this person over me, without ever raising the issue, was what truly upset me. I have always had complete faith in him and never believed rumors or negativity about him, and his lack of trust in me felt like a betrayal. This was a new piece of information for me, and it unleashed all my frustrations.
I exploded with rage, pouring out my real feelings about him and this whole situation. I have always let go of his behavior, all the cussing, gaslighting, and manipulations. He even claims that my diagnosis gave him so much stress that it's the cause of his drinking habit. He also says casually that he is using ""Cool Lip,"" a smokeless tobacco product, which I am really against. When I get angry or cry, he says it's just a prank and that he hasn't done it, without any proof, which really stresses me out. I have always ended the fights first because I thought a person in a relationship should let go of their ego and seek peace. I said sorry even when it was his fault; I begged him to stay and even forgave him for insulting my parents. I did all of this just because I loved him and what he did for me was huge. But whenever a fight escalates, he always brings up the fact that he had to care for me and lost everything for me, which is a form of guilt-tripping.

I have finally come to my senses and stopped silently enduring all this. I've talked back and told him not to try to scare me this time, as he sometimes blackmails me by saying he's going to call my dad and tell him to pay for taking care of me and to insult me. This time, I'm totally done and told him to do whatever he wants and that I will not change my decision. I don't know if he will call me later and ask me to stay or guilt-trip me more. I admit that he does this even when he is sober. He always blames me for every tiny mistake I make carelessly when helping him with paperwork, as his English is not good. He also accused me of making his job opportunity difficult because I am the only one making mistakes. Yes, I am the only one making mistakes because I am the only one doing anything. He never does anything, even if it's something a teenager can do. I only have a high school qualification, and he is a diploma holder, yet even while I am undergoing chemo, he insists that I fill out forms and write emails for him.

Edit: I'm still dealing with my health issues, and this situation is taking a toll on me. I'm looking for advice or stories from others who might have gone through something similar. How did you handle it? Should I prioritize my own well-being and end the relationship, or is there a way to work through this together?",7,1755471941.0,AITH,4,1.0,False
