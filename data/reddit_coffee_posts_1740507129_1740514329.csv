1iy4f2c,https://www.reddit.com/r/WeightLossAdvice/comments/1iy4f2c/why_cant_i_lose_weight/,Why can’t I lose weight?,"Quick context. ( F28, 5’11 tall) I’ve been working out pretty consistently for about 5 months now. Unfortunately, I did have a lot of surgeries last year. However, I was 208lbs in December . Once healed, I started going to the gym for almost two hours a day for 5 days out of the week. Running every day for 20-30 minutes and strength training til I’m sore. It’s been about 5 months and I’m 220lbs. I know some people will say it could be from muscle, but I genuinely think that nothing is changing in my body. I’ve tried to ignore the scale, it’s just killing me knowing I’m gaining weight after putting in so much work at the gym. 
I just want the weight off. I’m rethinking my entire diet and workout routine. 
Granted, my diet could be better. I probably already answered part of my question. I do IF 16:8. Break my fast around noon with a coffee and protein shake, then have whatever my husband wants/cooks for dinner. Weekends typically consist of a cheat meal with a candy bar of my choice. We both are healthy so it’s not terribly unhealthy food. However, could be better.

1iy4cuo,https://i.redd.it/f97r1s7edcle1.jpeg,Intermittent PT,"Hi! New whoosher here and I’m losing my mind. 

My ear wooshing sounds like a car’s excessive bass as it drives by. It’s only a few beats at a time, and I feel it more than I hear it, if that makes sense. The frequency comes on like hiccups. It could be seconds in between hearing it or it could be minutes between hearing it. And my “episodes” lasts between 10-18 hours at a time. 

I started tracking my episodes (only as of recently, it’s been happening since late January) in any desperate attempt to find a pattern, and there is none that I can determine. 

It’s only in my right ear, and it does not go away with any varying amount of pressure on my jugular veins. Plugging my ears with ear plugs helps a bit, but not really. 

Is it worth going to my doctor over? It feels so minor, but at the same time, it’s ruining me. I’m in such a rotten mood whenever it’s going on, and it disrupts my focus significantly. Sometimes on more aggressive pulses, I almost feel it vibrating through my whole head. 

I can’t imagine having to live like this for the rest of my life. I don’t know what I’ll do with myself if I go to the doctor and they don’t look into it. ",1,1740513887.0,PulsatileTinnitus,0,1.0,False

I am seeking representation for FRAYMOON, an adult fantasy of 105,000 words. FRAYMOON mingles magic with low and god-level tech, and the lovely with the unsettling. \[I usually put customized information here\]

Even before she opens her eyes, Amihan knows there is a bitter metal smell in what should be her sweetest thing: it is a changeling, and her baby, Hintua, is gone. Knowing she will not be believed, she decides to go alone to the Fell Mountain, where the ‘fair folk’ are said to take the babies they steal. She must traverse the world, and scale the peak that rears into the hard vacuum, for all she has never left home.

Stealing the jet discs that power magic, and tools for fighting monsters, she sets off. She is attacked by a demon who intends to drink her blood, but compels him to her service—the beautiful, devious Leofsige. Her childhood friend, Liantaika, joins them, still hopeful in hopeless love. In escaping his brutal master, he has stolen all his charms, including the atsar bombs that promise vast destruction and poisoned aftermath.

Liantaika’s pursuers begin to cooperate, and our trio faces ever-more violent onslaughts from the Academic Wizards as they seek the mountain. Some attacks are absurd terror; Amihan is pitched into scalding coffee with condensed milk, and only Liantaika’s magic saves her. Worse, near-fatally wounded by a retiarius, she is healed in a vat of pink slime into something unwanted: she becomes a great beauty. She fears Hintua will never know her. Her fear is realized strangely when they come to the mountain, and all is different than Amihan imagined: Hintua, her now-beloved Leofsige, and even the half-made world.

FRAYMOON combines dark cities with a steely village girl: think China Mièville meets Naomi Novik. Readers of Kelly Link’s *White Cat, Black Dog,* and Alex Febey’s *Cities of the Weft* will appreciate remade fairy-tales, baleful and strange. In classic fantasy, this is the world of Wolfe and Vance. 

I have long lived in Singapore after studying Classics, Linguistics, and Philosophy at Columbia and Berkeley. I have published some flash fiction and a coming story.

Thank you for your consideration,

Notes: Readers complained of unclarity; I hope I have improved. People object to including episodes, there I am unsure. I removed some, but now Amihan appears passive. The plot is here: her baby is stolen, she acquires two companions, they have to travel endlessly far, she is radically transformed, they face  obstacles and violent pursuit before finding the mountain is nothing like they imagined. Her purpose is unwavering, but the book is also somewhat picaresque, which can only be conveyed with examples, episodes. Thanks again for all your kind assistance.

First 300 words:

Amihan’s eyes were closed, but she could smell the metal, so faintly, a bitter thread in the beauty of the world, and she knew that they had taken her baby, Hintua. But they left something behind, it was traditional, a kind of changeling made of metal magic and an impossibly powerful glamour. No one would believe her. She was certain. They would think she had become ill with mother sickness, downcast and rejecting her child, and send her to be healed. The vicar was not so powerful, yet he still might succeed, and she would love this revolting thing until it died, which would not be long, and mourn it in agony. Metal magic and the ordinary sort frayed against each other. If it lived three more months she would be surprised. It might be that if she took it apart there would be gears, to prove it, but she shrank from that. She could not cut into a dolly of her beautiful child, no matter how false. 

Then the thing that was not Hintua began to stir. She did not want to nurse it, yet it seemed somehow a last time, though the true last had passed already, an hour before midnight, and she would never feed her child again, never, even once. When this thought came her body was washed in fire: first misery, then rage. Yet the milk had let down already, prickling heavy in her breasts. She opened her eyes. It was Hintua, her beloved. Most horrible of all, it turned its shining black eyes on her with love, the love of a child, and she wavered. Amihan stared into the black eyes, till they began to glance away, and once she saw an awful glee flicker, like light on the wall near a guttering flame, and she hardened her heart.",1,1740513657.0,PubTips,0,1.0,False

https://preview.redd.it/s5gkhpfofs061.jpg?width=2064&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=c175eb97f2ac90ce1058d2578c321ac507fab89f

Starting the keto diet can be a little overwhelming-the high-fat, low-carb diet, known for its dramatic weight loss results, requires an overhaul of most people's typical shopping lists. That means saying goodbye to some of the easy items you might keep on hand for lazy nights (we're talking to you, quick-cooking rice and frozen french fries), and hello to some slightly more perishable foods that are higher in fat and protein like meat and full-fat dairy. 

But before you go filling your grocery cart with bacon and cheese galore, know that you'll want to opt for good-for-you sources of unsaturated fat and protein-like fish and avocado, instead, says Lyssie Lakatos, RDN, of the Nutrition Twins. ""Since this diet is primarily coming from fat, choosing healthy sources of fat is important,"" she says. So, healthy fat = good; protein = good; but what about everything else? Don't freak-while, yes, tons of stuff is off-limits on the keto diet, there are plenty of yummy things you can eat. To help, a few dietitians weighed in on what they'd put on their keto diet grocery shopping list-so all you really have to do is save it and go to the store.  But first. . . some items to take off your list

There are a few aisles you can skip (the cookie aisle is probably one of them) if you're committing to keto. Here are the non-keto-friendly items you will no longer need to stock your fridge and pantry with. 

Pasta and other grains When you're cutting carbs on keto, pasta, rice, and noodles have to be the first to go (unfortunately). Your local grocery store might have a special health foods section where you can find low-carb or gluten-free pastas and noodles, though. 

Starchy veggiesPotatoes are off limits, and so are other starchy, high-carb vegetables like carrots, believe it or not. Colorful, leafy greens are going to be key staples to add to your basket or cart. 

High-sugar fruitsWhile fruit is something that is usually recommended for a healthy, balanced diet, the keto diet restricts some fruit, says Marisa Moore, MBA, RDN, LD.  Some fruits, like apples, bananas, and pears, are higher in carbs, which break down into sugars, so they're not typically part of a keto eating plan. 

LegumesIf you eat vegan or vegetarian, certain legumes, like beans, lentils, and chickpeas, might be a regular part of your diet for extra protein. On keto, though, they're too high in carbs and too low in fat to be compliant. 

Sugary foodsYou're going to want to bypass any aisle that includes candy, doughnuts, snack cakes, and cookies, as the sugars in any processed sweets should be avoided on the keto diet. Your keto-friendly grocery list

Ok, now that we've gotten the bad news out of the way, here are all the yummy items you can stock up on when you're following a keto diet. There's plenty to be excited about putting in your cart!

Low-carb veggies

Not all vegetables are created equal for keto followers. High-carb veggies are a no-go. Instead, opt for low-carb options like cauliflower, broccoli, spinach, bell pepper, celery, cucumber, eggplant, and asparagus, says Pegah Jalali, RD, a nutritionist with Middleberg Nutrition. 

Frozen veggies are cool, too. Sydney Greene, RD, also of Middleberg Nutrition, recommends frozen cauliflower in particular. ""It's very low carb yet high in fiber and vitamin C. Use cauliflower in place of bananas for a creamy smoothie without the extra carbohydrates,"" Greene says. 

Avocados

Tammy Lakatos Shames, RDN, of Nutrition Twins, describes avocados as one of the very best keto foods, jam-packed with both nutrients and healthy fats. ""I like to have them with some hemp or flax seeds sprinkled on top and some parmesan cheese,"" says Jalali.  

Berries 

Raspberries are a perfect sweet treat for people on the keto diet, since they're the fruit with the fewest carbs, says Jalali-though blueberries and blackberries are great, too. Blackberries and raspberries specifically are a solid option because they contain 8 grams of fiber per cup, too, Moore adds. Salad greens

Pre-washed greens, like spinach, kale and arugula, are a huge timesaver. ""Having greens on hand makes it super easy to throw together a quick salad or add some quick nutrients-folate, vitamin C, fiber, magnesium-to your proteins,"" says Greene. 

For a quick, keto-friendly breakfast, Greene suggests scrambling two whole eggs and a handful of spinach to get a good serving of healthy fat, protein, and fiber. 

Grass-fed beef and organic chicken

Keep grass-fed beef and lamb, along with organic chicken, on hand, recommends Jalali. ""Our clients particularly love Applegate's Great Organic Uncured Beef Hot Dog,"" says Shames-they're non-GMO and made with grass-fed beef, sans nitrates and preservatives. 

Bone broth

Another option? Sip your meat-based protein. Greene loves Bonafide Provisions Bone Broth, which uses bones from grass-fed cows. ""The amino acids found in the broth support a healthy gut,"" says Greene. Tuna, salmon, or sardines (fresh or canned)

If you opt for fresh fish, grill, bake, or pan-fry it in a healthy oil (olive or avocado) and serve with a low-carb veggie like broccoli or cauliflower rice. 

If you choose canned, mix it with mayo and serve over greens, suggests Jalali. For a simple keto lunch, Greene suggests combining a can of tuna with half an avocado in a collard green wrap. 

Cheese

Go for grass-fed, organic, and full-fat options in the dairy aisle, recommends Jalali. For cheese, one easy-to-find option-readily available at groceries and convenience stores alike-is Organic Valley's full fat cheese. ""It fits in the keto diet perfectly,"" says Lakatos. Always read the nutrition info before purchasing pre-shredded cheeses, cautions Jalali, who says they sometimes contain a stabilizer that adds carbs-so just make sure your shredded cheese has zero grams of carbs. 

Greek yogurt and sour cream

These can be used interchangeably on the keto diet, as they all have similar amounts of carbs-Greek yogurt has five grams per serving and sour cream has seven. Just make sure they're plain options-added flavors also add carbs. 

Quark

Quark is a German food that's somewhere in between yogurt and cheese in flavor and consistency-you can add it to smoothies, or use it as a spread or topping. ""It's rich, creamy, and a favorite among our clients who are keto followers,"" says Lakatos. 

Eggs

If you're on a keto diet, opt for Eggland's Best Eggs, says Lakatos. ""They have double the omega-3s and six times the vitamin D of other eggs, thanks to their all-vegetarian hen feed which provides high-quality, keto-friendly nutrients. ""

Moore suggests meal prepping hard boiled eggs and keeping them in the fridge throughout the week for easy on-the-go breakfasts. If properly refrigerated and not cracked, they'll last for 7 days in the fridge. 

Nut milks

Milk can actually have a good amount of carbs, so nut milk is a good alternative on the keto diet, says Lakatos. Unsweetened coconut, hemp, and almond milks in particular are good options, as they contain no carbs and more than four grams of fat-a perfect combo for keto dieters. Almond milk specifically is versatile for a variety of recipes, like a chia seed pudding or a breakfast smoothie, says Moore. ""Simply blend frozen berries with leafy greens and plenty of almond milk for a frosty drink in less than five minutes,"" Moore suggests. 

Avocado, olive, hazelnut, and coconut oil

The keto diet is all about fat, so clearly all healthy oils are welcome on this keto grocery list. Cooking food in the oils is one thing-but you can also amp up your fat intake by drizzling some oil on your cooked meal, as well. 

Grass-fed ghee

Ghee, like the oils above, is a pure fat, which means its free from carbs or protein, says Jalali. ""Ketogenic diets are more than 60 percent fat so having pure fats for all meals helps keep you on track,"" she says. If you can't find ghee, you can also use butter. 

Seaweed

This low-carb snack has just one gram of carbs, and is full of iodine, which supports a healthy thyroid, says Greene. Some even come in individual grab-and-go packets so you can store them in your desk at work or in your purse. 

Olives

You can add olives to salad or have them as an on-the-go snack. ""We find these to be a lifesaver for our keto clients,"" says Shames. Olives offer a healthy monounsaturated source of fat; some even come in different flavors (like taco or sriracha). Pistachios 

Shames recommends single-serving packages of pistachios, too. ""Ninety percent of the fats found in pistachios are the better-for-you mono- and polyunsaturated type,"" says Shames. ""Plus, pistachios provide a good source of plant protein and fiber for a trio that can help to keep you fuller longer. ""

Almonds

Another nut that's high in fiber, healthy fat, and protein is almonds. Moore always recommends them as snacks for clients who are constantly busy and need snacks to keep them satiated throughout the day. You can easily pack single-serve packages ahead of time. 

Nutritional yeast

Nutritional yeast provides B12, a nutrient that many of us-especially vegans and vegetarians-just don't get enough of. It's also a source of protein without many carbs at all, says Lakatos. 

""Keto followers can sprinkle it on their meals for a cheesy flavor and they often use it to make keto-friendly breads and tortillas,"" says Lakatos. 

Chia seeds and flax seeds

You can use these seeds to coat meats, include them in bake goods, or make keto-friendly oatmeal and pudding, says Jalali. These pantry items are high in fiber, but low in carbs. 

Healthy frozen foods

Added items like frozen cauliflower pizza and frozen frittatas can make eating keo simple on mornings and nights when you're strapped for time. Nora Minno, an RD in New York City, loves this pizza, which contains only 16 grams of carbs for the whole pie.  Tofu

""Tofu is a great way to add plant-based protein into a diet that is typically heavy in animal protein and fat,"" says Minno. ""A 3-oz serving contains 80 calories, 4 grams of fat, 9 grams of protein and only 3 grams of carbs. You'll also be getting important micronutrients like calcium, iron, and potassium. ""

Low-carb pasta alternatives

""Shiratake noodles are a great low-carb pasta alternative with only 2 grams of carbs and 0 calories per bag,"" says Minno. 

Nut butter

A high-quality nut butter is a great keto snack, topping for flax crackers, and ingredient for keto fat bombs and desserts, says Lara Clevenger, RD and founder of The Keto Queens. 

Grass-fed beef tallow

Beef tallow is rich in omega 3 and CLA and is a ""high quality saturated fat which has a high smoke point and is great for cooking,"" says Clevenger. 

Chocolate

Yes, you can totally add chocolate to your shopping cart on the keto diet! Clevenger recommends Choc Zero. ""It's sugar-free chocolate, non-gmo, and contains no sugar alcohols or soy lecithin. It's not super bitter like some chocolate bars and tastes great and has a very good texture,"" she says. 

Keto-approved condiments

One of the trickiest things to shop for while keto? Dressings and condiments. Clevenger recommends low-sugar ketchup and BBQ sauce from Alterna Sweets. ""These sauces taste amazing and they all contain only 1 gram net carb per tablespoon,"" she says. As for salad dressing? Clevenger reaches for Primal Kitchen brand. ""These are sugar-free and keto-certified. ""Alternative flours

""Almond flour is one of my favorite baking ingredients,"" Moore says. It's also one of the most common keto-friendly, gluten-free, alternative flours.  ""The almonds provide satiating fiber and protein plus healthy fats,"" Moore adds.  She recommends it for making pie crusts and baking cookies and muffins. 

Coconut flour is another low-carb flour alternative that Moore suggests adding to your pantry. However, keep in mind that you can't just substitute the same amount in a recipe that calls for regular four. ""Because it is highly absorbent, you'll likely need to add more liquid to baked goods that use coconut flour,"" Moore says. 

Keto-friendly sweeteners

For a natural sugar substitute that's keto-compliant, consider stocking up on monk fruit, says Moore. Whether you're baking or looking to sweeten up your coffee, monk fruit is an option that won't take you out of ketosis. Erythritol is another common keto-friendly sugar substitute. Again, you'll want to use in keto-specific recipes since you can't swap in the same amount for a recipe that calls for sugar. 

Keto protein bars

To keep you full during the day, try a keto protein or energy bar that's high in healthy fats (like nuts and oils like avocado oil) and protein, but low in carbs. Keto Bar is a great option-they make a delicious chocolate peanut butter flavor. 

Keto granolas

You won't be able to buy regular cereals, as they'll be too high in carbs, but low-carb or grain-free, low sugar granolas like Lakanto Healthy Quick Breakfast Granola or Lark Ellen Farm Granola are a better choice. You can add milk to them or eat them with yogurt and breakfast is solved.",1,1740513631.0,HealthyZapper,0,1.0,False

We met on Hinge and got along so I asked him out for coffee. 

I was super nervous as I've only really dated women, but it went really well. Tom was sweet and funny and we found a mutual love of video games and our dogs. There was literally no awkwardness besides the initial ""omg how do I act like a person"" phase.

4ish months later and things are going really well. Things have felt fairly serious, we've met each others friend groups and spend a lot of time at each others places. We have a really open dialogue with each other that I've never really experienced before, which has made me feel very comfortable with him (which I think is where I messed up).

On Friday night I went over to his place to watch a film. He had cooked a lasagna, which we ate at the table and then settled down on the sofa and cuddled while we watched. After a while we were making out and I could see that things were headed towards sex. Now, we've not actually had sex at this point as I take a while to be comfortable with someone enough for it (which he has been aware of since day 1), so I was nervous as hell but I was feeling ready. The other thing to know about me is I have IBS and get insanely gassy when I'm nervous, especially when I've had dairy. 

So we move to his room and things are going well but he goes to lift my leg over his hip which pushed out the loudest fart. Like it sounded like an engine had backfired. I was mortified. Not only that, but it definitely wasn't odourless. All was silent for a second and I just lost it, I started giggling a little which devolved into tears streaming down my face and stomach cramps. I think it was half a nervous reaction to the silence and half me having the humour of a 5 year old. Also, when I've been with women in the past and one of us has passed gas we laughed at it and moved on so I thought it was a pretty normal reaction.

When I got myself under control I realised Tom was gone. Like he had fully left his bedroom. I got up and found him in the living room sat with his arms crossed and a face like a slapped arse. I won't lie, my initial thought was that he'd left because of the smell because it defintely wasn't roses and vanilla. However, when I asked him what was wrong he said that I was ""disgusting"" and he couldn't believe that I was this immature to laugh at something so gross when we were about to have sex and that I ""killed his boner"".  

I was completely floored and couldn't think of anything to say other than ""I'm sorry?"" to which he looked away and told me he wanted to be alone for a bit and he thought I should leave. I asked him if he was dumping me ""over a fucking fart"" and he said he wasn't sure so I just got dressed, got my stuff, and left. I haven't heard anything from him since, despite me messaging and calling. 

I've left voicemails asking for him to just call because I genuinely have no idea what happened and I'm just spiraling because there's no way I've just been dumped over a fart. I have no idea how to move forward with this or how to get him to talk to me. Ive never been in a situation like this and I'm too embarrassed to tell anyone in real life (I also feel like my friends will just take the piss out of the situation). How do I approach this and get him to talk with me as I feel like we've been together long enough that I deserve an actual explanation? Sorry this is so long.

TLDR; I accidentally farted during sexy times and my bf called me disgusting and immature for laughing and asked me to leave. Now I haven't heard from him in like 4 days and I don't know what to do. Please help.",5,1740513354.0,relationship_advice,17,0.78,False

I feel like I am breaking down. It's like I am being hit over the head with a sledgehammer and the cracks are running through me from my skull down to the soles of my feet. Some days the feeling is so intense I don't know how to lift my head any longer. 

I am a caregiver to my sister, and my parents. I am constantly on hand to deal with them physically and emotionally, the latter of which is truly taking a massive mental toll. I take care of everything to do with the household, both inside and out. All of my time (outside of my job) is taken up with taking care of them or running errands. The only time I get to myself is driving to and from the supermarket. I am also working basically 3 jobs to better my career prospects which leaves even less time for myself. My family, my cousins, who I have loved and made excuses for my entire life, have basically shown they don't give a fuck and would rather get on with their own lives than check to see if I'm dead or alive. I don't go anywhere or do anything because I have people who rely on me and feel extremely guilty doing anything as little as venturing into town for a few hours to browse a bookstore or have a coffee. Meanwhile my peers are getting into relationships, getting married, travelling the world and living their twenties to the fullest... I know comparison is the thief of joy and social media is only shows one side of a person's life, but the side I'm seeing is way fucking better than anything I've experienced in the last few years. Honestly, it's not even just social media. People will casually mention how they got away to a spa on the weekend or went out with the family for a nice dinner or the zoo and it rips me apart because I can't remember the last time I did anything like that. I can't even fucking begin to put it into words. Even if I had the time, having the money is another problem. I want to do more than to live hand to mouth or constantly delay getting myself a bloody phone case because I never have enough or I want to save. And somehow still eat healthily (because I hate the way I look) whilst actual organic food becomes more expensive by the day. Starving myself is usually the cheapest option, which is just sad, I know.

I met this guy at a show I played last year sometime, and he approached me, we chatted, he seemed fine if not a little tiring to be around. He's probably 10+ years older than me. He has his own band, the music is actually pretty good, and of a similar genre as one of my projects so figured it's good to link up. We played one show together later in the summer (in our own separate bands). So it's not like I ever had a wall up with him, he probably considers me a friend, and I thought I did him for a while too. 

Thing is, he'll show up to shows I'm involved in and kind of corner me into a long winded conversation that doesn't interest me. It's a struggle to get away and say hi to my other friends and sometimes I miss them entirely. He doesn't really know how to let other people talk so the only choice is making an escape when I can.  Needless to say by this point, the guy socially bothers me. I find his personality obnoxious, and just being in the same room to be draining. And has borderline creepy moments/facial expressions. He won't take a hint so I'm pushed to be almost rude.  I don't know how his band deals with him. If I know he's coming to a show there's an immediate damper on my mood, kind of claustrophobic. It feels mean to say, but he kind of embarrasses me. 

Anyways, that's one problem to deal with (gonna try blocking my insta stories so he doesn't know about shows), but the immediate situation is that he showed up to a gig of mine over the weekend and basically wants me to help produce/arrange his album. No mention of $ , though I considered bringing up a rate. I've done arrangements professionally. Thing is, I'd just rather not be around him even for some measly cash, or even to make a good record. I just don't want to have my stamp on it. He's texted yesterday to have coffee and ""pick my brain"" about the project. 

Current options I'm considering are to Repeatedly delay and flake, Say I'm too busy with other things, Meet him for coffee and give my rate $.

I've only been cordial with the guy, and he doesn't seem to have any idea of how annoying i find him, so it would come out of nowhere to be totally truthful. I try to be a warm and friendly person in my life, and admittedly a little too ""yes,"" but can't just let myself be railroaded into this. Life is too short. Sorry that was long winded, but I'd love to hear anyone's thoughts or experiences along these lines. Thank You!

He put his backpack away, grabbed a cup of coffee and sat in on a five-minute meeting. Not 15 minutes later, his supervisor told him to check his email.

A new email waited for him, the subject line read, ""Notification of Termination During Probationary Period."" He scanned the email in disbelief. He settled on a line that would rattle in his head the rest of the day:

""Unfortunately, the Agency finds that your performance has not met the burden to demonstrate that your further employment at the Agency would be in the public interest. For this reason, the Agency informs you that the Agency is removing you from your position with the Agency and the federal civil service effective February 24, 2025.""

1iy3yas,https://www.reddit.com/r/HealthProductsNatural/comments/1iy3yas/tried_ageless_multicollagen_for_3_months_heres/,Tried Ageless Multi-Collagen for 3 Months – Here’s What Actually Happened,"I’ve been experimenting with different collagen supplements for a while, and Ageless Multi-Collagen was my most recent test. After seeing tons of discussions about collagen for skin, hair, nails, and joint health, I decided to give this one a shot. Now that I’ve been using it consistently for 3 months, I figured I’d share my experience—both the good and the not-so-great.

# What is Ageless Multi-Collagen?

Ageless Multi-Collagen is a **protein powder that contains five types of collagen** from four different sources: **grass-fed beef, cage-free chicken, wild-caught fish, and eggshell membrane**. Unlike some other collagen powders, this one is **flavorless, odorless, and mixes easily** into drinks like coffee, smoothies, or even plain water.

It’s marketed as a full-body support supplement, claiming to help with:

* **Skin elasticity and hydration**
* **Stronger nails and hair**
* **Joint and bone health**
* **Gut health and digestion**

I was mainly interested in the **skin, hair, and joint benefits**, since I’ve started noticing drier skin and occasional knee discomfort.

# What Made Me Choose Ageless Multi-Collagen?

I’ve tried other collagen powders before, and most of them had **one or more issues**—weird taste, clumping, or questionable ingredient sourcing. What caught my attention about this one:

* **Contains all 5 types of collagen** (most powders only have one or two).
* **Lab-tested, non-GMO, gluten-free**—seems like a cleaner formula than others I’ve tried.
* **Good mixability**—I saw reviews saying it dissolves well with no clumps.
* **Backed by a 60-day money-back guarantee** (not a dealbreaker, but nice to have).
* **Made in the USA** (some collagen powders source ingredients from questionable locations).

I ended up ordering the **Buy 2, Get 1 Free** deal from [**this site**](https://getagelesscollagen.com/offer-01/?lpid=0994&source_id=DL&utm_source=8928&utm_medium=&utm_term=994&aff_id=8928&sub_id=&req_id=&oid=994&device_type=&country_name=&oid=994&affid=8928&source_id=Rddt&sub1=%20%20r/HealthProductsNatural) since it worked out cheaper per unit.

# My Experience Using It Daily

# Mixability & Taste

First test: **Does it actually mix without clumping?** Surprisingly, yes. I’ve had collagen powders in the past that clumped up in cold drinks, but this one dissolved easily in coffee and smoothies. No gritty texture, no weird aftertaste. If you’re picky about flavors, this is a good option because it’s truly **flavorless**.

# Skin & Hair Results

By **week 4**, I noticed my skin felt **less dry**, especially in the morning. I wasn’t expecting dramatic changes, but by **week 6-7**, I saw a difference in how my skin retained moisture. Not a miracle, but definitely an improvement.

My **hair** was another surprise. Around **month 2**, I noticed less shedding when brushing. My hair felt **stronger and less brittle**, which was unexpected. It wasn’t thicker, but it definitely had more resilience.

# Joint & Bone Health

I’ve had **on-and-off knee discomfort** for a couple of years, especially after workouts. I didn’t feel much change in the first month, but by **month 3**, my knees felt less stiff in the morning. I won’t say it’s a cure-all, but it definitely made a difference in how my joints felt overall.

# Gut Health

This was one of the more surprising effects. Around **week 5**, I noticed my digestion felt **a lot smoother**. No bloating, no discomfort. I don’t have major gut issues, but I did notice a positive shift in how my stomach felt overall.

# What I Didn’t Love

# Final Thoughts – Is It Worth It?

If you’re looking for a **high-quality multi-collagen powder** that **mixes well, has no taste, and actually delivers results over time**, Ageless Multi-Collagen is a solid option. It worked well for me in terms of **skin hydration, hair strength, joint comfort, and digestion**.

Would I repurchase? Yes, but mainly because I’m already in the habit of using collagen daily. If you’re trying collagen for the first time, be prepared to **commit to at least 2-3 months** to see real effects.

If you’ve tried Ageless Multi-Collagen or another collagen supplement, I’d love to hear about your experience—what worked, what didn’t, and if you’d keep using it.",1,1740512891.0,HealthProductsNatural,0,1.0,False

I have a question about creatine. 

When I was in my 20s I used creatine for 4 or 5 years and had no negative side effects that I know of. I am now almost 32 and thinking about taking it again after quite a few years of not taking it. 

I'm having some anxiety from all the conflicting view points I hear. So many say it is the most researched and safe supplement. Others saying it causes kidney problems, high blood pressure, problems with sleep, anxiety etc. 

I dont have any kidney issues (as far as I know?). Sometimes at the doctors my blood pressure is elevated but there is no way to know if it is hypertension or not because I have generalized anxiety and panic disorder and am typically pretty  anxious at the doctors office. 

I drink about 3-4 liters of water a day and probably 3-5 cups of black coffee a day. Haven't had any alcohol in 6 months but when I do it is only a beer or two and I smoke cannabis daily but only at night and a very small amount. 

The container of ON creatine is just sitting in my cabinet and im wondering if I should begin taking it or not. Does it sound like im someone who is healthy enough to take creatine?

Here is what the itinerary looks like WITH adding a day.

Considering all that we want to do (46 yo woman and my 12 year old son), do you feel that we need four full days in LF or do you think we would be ok adding the El Silencio hike to the 11th or 12th? 

Also, if you have any suggestions to this itinerary, all input is welcome! I'm not sure how realistic it is to do all three things we currently have slated for June 12.

1iy3u6r,https://www.reddit.com/r/chubbytravel/comments/1iy3u6r/review_of_return_trip_to_susurros_del_corazon/,Review of return trip to Susurros del Corazon - another hit,"Hi all! We just returned from Susurros del Corazon near Puerto Vallarta / outside of Punta Mita. After we got back I sent the below review to our wonderful TA u/Middlename_Adventure that we booked through and she encouraged me to share with the sub. So here goes.

This was our second trip to Susurros. We went April 2024 and all loved it so much that we really didn’t give it much of a second thought to just book again this year. This kind of trip is for us to just park it at the resort, enjoy the sun and be catered to. Didn’t leave the resort once during either trip. 

**When:** President’s Day week Feb 2025, 5 nights  
**Who:** three adults (parents and one grandparent) and two kids (5 & 8)  
**Room type:** Two Bedroom Oceanview suite (kids bunked in the living room, very doable, more below).



**Things we loved / what works for us:**

**- The travel is easy.** Easy direct flight from our home airport and then 45 min car ride to the hotel. We booked car service through the hotel both ways and it was great. The pickup area outside the airport is a bit of a cluster so be prepared for that, but just tell anyone holding a sign that you’re looking for Susurros transportation and they will point you in the right direction. 

**- The food is great.** We love Mexican food and eating healthy/light, and there are so many good options on the various menus, I think we could stay a week and still be happy eating there for every meal. If there's anything you want off-menu they will make it happen. Want guacamole with veggies instead of chips? Sure! Several times we asked for modifications to dishes or even different portion sizes like one taco instead of a set of three and they made it happen without batting an eye. And fear not, while chicken tenders are not *technically* on the kids menu, they can be procured.

**- The f&b is also kinda sneakily inexpensive which is such a pleasant surprise.** The dollar is strong against the peso right now so that helps, but also the prices on the menus are inclusive of tax and gratuity so once you back out of that, the guacamole for example equates to being only like $12 on a menu back home. One day at the pool I ordered my kids a virgin pina colada (off-menu) and when the bill came they had charged me the equivalent of less than $5. We struggled to spend anywhere close to our $45pp breakfast credits each day, and we did try.

**- The kids club is great and also super reasonably priced.** I like that you can sign your kid up for one activity (60-90 mins) versus having to commit to a full morning or afternoon. The staff at kids club are super sweet, a few of them we recognized from last year so it's nice to see that there's been minimal turnover (same for some of the waitstaff and cuates). The kids got to do several Mexican crafts and came home with homemade souvenirs as a result. We didn’t use babysitting services this time, but did on our first trip and our babysitter was one of the kids club employees who was so kind.  

**- The rooms are huge.** We were super comfy in the 2bed Oceanview Suite with our crew of 3 adults and 2 kids. The kids bunked in the living room - we had one on a rollaway and one sleeping in a bed made up on the chaise part of the sectional. Plenty of space leftover still. With doors that close, an extra half bath, lots of floor space plus a big terrace the suite is roomy. Not sure if the hotel would allow it, but space-wise one could bunk a third kid in the living room space.

**- The design of the hotel feels Mexican while also modern and comfortable.** I love the handwoven textiles in the bathroom, leather coasters, embroidered cloth napkins, etc. Everything you see around the resort down to the kid-friendly bamboo cups at Milpa feels considered for aesthetics and design.

**- Family pool is perfect for kids of multiple ages.** Love that there's multiple depths, fun water features for kids to play in that aren't eyesores for parents. Zero entry and a wading area for toddlers. Because the difference in depths is mostly hidden underwater it just looks like a pretty infinity pool. The reason we originally tried Susurros last year was specifically for the pool after a kid pool fail at Mauna Lani (the pool setup at Mauna Lani is such that if you have one kid who can swim and one who can’t --who also refuses to wear floaties-- you're stuck splitting up at two different pools. Susurros family pool accommodates different swimming abilities in one spot) 

**- The scale of the resort is small/compact and convenient to let our kids be independent.** The kids went to breakfast early on their own one morning which was awesome. During meals while waiting for the adults to finish up the kids would play at the beach and grassy area next to the restaurant. Easy to let them run up to the room on their own too, it all feels super safe and easy to navigate.

**- You always feel welcome by the staff throughout the property.** They must have a policy of staff greeting a guest with ""hola"" or ""buenos dias"" etc anytime they see one, and it's so nice. No matter if it's someone mowing the grass, or a plumber, or housekeeping or even one of the owners who we also met at one point, they always say hello when you pass them on the property. Which then creates a habit of us saying hola back, and then all the guests are saying hola to each other too. Seems like a small thing but I think it lifts the mood for everyone and encourages a friendly atmosphere all around.

**- The gym and the spa are lovely.** The gym is spacious, well-appointed and light and bright. Big studio space as well for yoga/stretching. We didn’t do any spa treatments, but did use the sauna and cold plunge. Pickleball and tennis courts available too.

**- They were super careful about the allergy in our group.** We have a specific shellfish allergy in our group and it was almost comical how careful they were about it (when my kids went to breakfast solo apparently the waitstaff checked with them multiple times in two different ways to make sure neither of them was the one with the allergy, even though they had only ordered waffles :)



**Things that weren't perfect - and I'm going to be reaching here!**

**- More dining height tables and chairs would be nice at La Boquita, the more casual restaurant.** The design of the restaurant is beachy and bohemian, and most of the tables are coffee-table height which isn’t my favorite for dining. If it’s important to you just get ahead of it and request one of the few dining height tables, for some reason we didn’t figure this out until our last night dining there.

**- They could use a few more lounge chairs at the family pool.** They have the deck space for a second row but it’s somewhat sparsely furnished. For the most part, chairs weren't really scarce as people with kids came and went throughout the day, but one day a larger multi-family group arrived and snagged a lot of the chairs in one swoop which made it a little tricky on that particular day. No other issues though. Chairs at the beach are plentiful and there’s another family-friendly pool down below, just doesn’t have as much of a wading area like the main family pool. 

**- Would be nice to have the f&b on the incidentals bill listed by venue.** Again I’m really reaching here on the critiques, but found that with all the f&b charges listed similarly regardless of venue it was a little extra hard to review and make sure it all seemed correct (which btw I don’t have a good process for regardless of the property – does anyone have hot tips for this for someone who’s not a total control freak but wants to feel like they’ve reviewed the bill “reasonably well?” Lol)



To end on a high note, just wanted to say again how lovely and warm the service was throughout the resort. I really felt like the staff wanted us to enjoy ourselves and if there was anything they could do to make our day more pleasant they would happily do it. All in all another great stay there.

The morning light filtered through the thin curtains of Emma’s room, casting a soft glow over the cluttered space. Clothes were strewn across the floor, empty water bottles and snack wrappers littered the nightstand, and the faint scent of last night’s perfume lingered in the air. Emma lay in bed, her hair a tangled mess, her face buried in the pillow. She groaned softly, her hand reaching out to fumble for her phone on the nightstand.

“Ugh… my head,” she muttered, her voice hoarse and groggy. She squinted at the bright screen of her phone, wincing at the notifications that had piled up overnight. With a sigh, she tossed the phone aside and called out, “David! Where are you?”

David, who had been in the kitchen preparing breakfast, hurried to her room at the sound of her voice. He knocked lightly on the door before pushing it open. “Yeah? What’s wrong?”

Emma turned her head slightly, her expression a mix of annoyance and discomfort. “What’s wrong? I have a killer headache, that’s what’s wrong. Where were you? I’ve been calling for ages.”

David blinked, taken aback by her tone. “I… I was in the kitchen. I didn’t hear you.”

Emma groaned again, rolling onto her back. “Whatever. Just get me an aspirin, will you? And hurry up.”

David nodded, his shoulders tense. “Sure. I’ll be right back.”

He returned a moment later with a glass of water and a small pill. Emma sat up slightly, her movements slow and deliberate, and took the aspirin from him. She swallowed it with a sip of water, her face scrunching up in distaste. “Ugh, that tastes awful.”

David stood awkwardly by the bed, unsure of what to say. “Do you need anything else?”

Emma shook her head, leaning back against the pillows. “No, just… sit down for a second. I need to talk to you.”

David hesitated, then perched on the edge of the bed, careful not to sit too close. Emma glanced at him, her expression softening slightly. “Thanks for last night, by the way. I had a great time. Well, until this headache started.”

David forced a smile, though his chest tightened at the memory of seeing her with that guy at the club. “Yeah, no problem. I’m glad you had fun.”

Emma sighed, running a hand through her messy hair. “I did. But now I feel like death. Ugh, I hate hangovers.”

David nodded sympathetically, though he couldn’t help feeling a pang of resentment. He had spent the entire night waiting for her, cleaning Charlotte’s boots, and now he was expected to cater to her every need. But he didn’t say anything. He never did.

After a moment of silence, Emma turned to him, her expression suddenly serious. “So, what are your plans for today?”

David blinked, caught off guard by the question. “Uh… I have classes this morning. And this afternoon, I was going to work on an assignment that’s due next week.”

Emma waved a hand dismissively. “Yeah, about that. Your plans have changed.”

David frowned, his confusion growing. “What do you mean?”

Emma sat up a little straighter, her tone matter-of-fact. “You’re going to my classes today and taking notes for me. I’m not missing another lecture, and I’m definitely not going in with this headache. And this afternoon, you’re going to finish my assignment. It’s due by midnight, so you’ll have to work fast.”

David stared at her, his mind racing. “Wait… what assignment? I didn’t know you had something due.”

Emma shrugged, her tone casual. “It’s for my literature class. We had to analyze a novel and write a paper. You know, the usual.”

David’s eyes widened. “A whole paper? How much have you done so far?”

Emma gave him a look, her expression a mix of amusement and exasperation. “Uh… nothing? Obviously. I’m not going to waste my time on that. You’ll take care of it, right?”

David opened his mouth to protest, but Emma cut him off. “Come on, David. You’re good at this stuff. And I need a good grade. I deserve it, after everything.”

David hesitated, his mind swirling with conflicting emotions. He wanted to say no, to tell her that he had his own work to do, but he couldn’t bring himself to disappoint her. “I… I’ll do my best,” he said finally, his voice quiet.

Emma smiled, though there was a hint of steel in her tone. “You mean you’ll do your *absolute* best. I’m counting on you, David. Don’t let me down.”

As David left Emma’s room and headed to the kitchen to finish his breakfast, he couldn’t shake the feeling of being trapped. He had his own classes to attend, his own assignments to complete, but now he was expected to drop everything for Emma. Again.

He glanced at the clock, his stomach churning with anxiety. If he was going to attend Emma’s classes, take notes, and then write an entire paper for her, he would have to work nonstop. There was no time for breaks, no time for his own responsibilities.

As David stepped out of the apartment and into the crisp morning air, he took a deep breath, trying to steady his nerves. The day ahead loomed like a mountain, insurmountable and overwhelming. But he would do it. He always did.

The schoolyard was bustling with students, their laughter and chatter filling the air as they milled about before the start of classes. David sat on a bench near the entrance, his backpack resting at his feet. He was surrounded by a small group of friends, though his mind was elsewhere. He was still reeling from the morning’s events, his thoughts consumed by the mountain of tasks Emma had dumped on him.

As his friends joked and laughed, David’s attention was suddenly drawn to the sound of his name being called. It wasn’t a friendly call—it was sharp, commanding, and impossible to ignore. He turned his head and saw Charlotte standing on the other side of the schoolyard, her arms crossed and her expression impatient.

“David!” she called again, her voice cutting through the noise like a whip. She snapped her fingers and gestured for him to come over, her movements exaggerated and demanding.

David froze, his cheeks flushing with embarrassment. He could feel the eyes of his friends and other students turning toward him, their curiosity piqued. He hesitated, hoping Charlotte would give up and leave him alone, but she didn’t. Instead, she called his name again, louder this time, and snapped her fingers impatiently.

“David! Get over here!” she shouted, her tone growing sharper.

David’s friends exchanged glances, their laughter fading as they watched the scene unfold. One of them nudged him with an elbow. “Uh-oh, looks like you’re in trouble,” he said with a smirk.

David forced a weak smile and stood up, his heart pounding. He could hear whispers and snickers as he made his way across the schoolyard, his head down and his shoulders tense. He caught snippets of conversation as he passed other students.

“Looks like Charlotte’s got another nerd wrapped around her finger,” someone said, their voice dripping with amusement.

“Poor guy,” another added. “He doesn’t stand a chance.”

David’s face burned, but he kept walking, his eyes fixed on the ground. When he finally reached Charlotte, he looked up, his voice quiet and hesitant. “Hey, Charlotte. What’s up?”

Charlotte didn’t waste any time. “Where are my shoes?” she demanded, her hands on her hips. “I want them back.”

David blinked, caught off guard by her abruptness. “Uh… they’re at home. But I cleaned them, like you asked.”

Charlotte narrowed her eyes, her expression skeptical. “Oh, really? Then why don’t I see them here? I think you’re lying.”

David shook his head quickly. “No, I’m not lying. I cleaned them last night. I just didn’t bring them with me today.”

Charlotte stepped closer, her eyes blazing. “You were supposed to bring them. I told you to clean them, and I expected them to be here. Do you ever listen to anything I say?”

Before David could respond, Charlotte reached out and grabbed his ear, pulling him closer. He winced, the pain sharp and unexpected. “You need to learn to listen,” she hissed, her voice low and menacing. “I wanted them cleaned and looking brand new. But now they’re not here. Explain that.”

David’s voice was strained as he tried to speak, Charlotte’s grip still tight on his ear. “I… I’ll bring them tomorrow. I promise.”

Charlotte’s eyes narrowed further, and she leaned in closer, her breath hot against his face. “No. You’ll bring them after school today. Understand?”

David hesitated, his mind racing. He had Emma’s classes to attend, her notes to take, and her assignment to finish. He didn’t have time to go home and get Charlotte’s shoes. But before he could say anything, Charlotte tightened her grip and repeated, “Understand?”

David nodded quickly, his voice barely above a whisper. “Yes. I’ll bring them after school.”

Charlotte released his ear, a satisfied smirk spreading across her face. “Good. And don’t be late.”

When the bell rang, signaling the start of classes, David followed Charlotte. She led the way, her stride confident and commanding, while David trailed behind, his shoulders slumped and his head down. As they entered the classroom, Charlotte turned to him, her tone casual but firm.

“You’re sitting in front of me,” she said, pointing to a desk near the middle of the room. “And you’re taking notes for Emma. Don’t mess it up.”

David nodded silently and took his seat, pulling out a notebook and pen. Charlotte sat directly behind him, her presence looming like a shadow. As the teacher began the lecture, David tried to focus, but it was nearly impossible with Charlotte’s constant interruptions.

She tapped his shoulder repeatedly, her voice a low whisper. “Write that down. That’s important.”

“Did you get that last part? Emma will need to know that.”

“Hey, pass me a piece of paper. I need to write something.”

Each time, David complied, his frustration growing but his protests unspoken. He could feel the weight of Charlotte’s expectations pressing down on him, her demands relentless and unyielding.

When the bell rang for the break, most students filed out of the classroom, eager to stretch their legs and grab a snack. David stayed in his seat, his head resting on his arms as he tried to catch his breath. But his moment of peace was short-lived.

He felt a sharp kick against the back of his chair, followed by another. He turned to see Charlotte leaning back in her seat, her feet propped up against his chair. She smirked when she saw his face.

“Hey, wimp,” she said, her tone mocking. “It’s Emma’s turn to treat me today. I want a latte macchiato from Starbucks and a panini to go. Get moving.”

David blinked, his exhaustion evident. “Can’t it just be regular coffee from the cafeteria? Starbucks is all the way across campus, and I might not make it back in time for the next class.”

Charlotte’s smirk faded, replaced by a look of annoyance. She kicked his chair again, harder this time. “Did I stutter? I said I want a latte macchiato and a panini from Starbucks. Now go.”

David hesitated, his mind racing. He didn’t have time for this. He had Emma’s notes to finish, her assignment to start, and now Charlotte’s shoes to retrieve after school. But before he could protest, Charlotte leaned forward, her voice low and threatening.

“If you’re not back in time, I’ll make sure Emma hears all about how you failed to do your job. Now move.”

David stood up slowly, his shoulders heavy with the weight of her demands. He grabbed his bag and headed for the door, his steps slow and reluctant. As he walked, he could hear Charlotte’s voice behind him, loud enough for the remaining students to hear.

“Don’t forget my panini!” she called, her laughter echoing in the hallway.

The walk to Starbucks felt like a march to his doom. David’s mind was a whirlwind of frustration, resentment, and exhaustion. He couldn’t believe he was doing this—running errands for Charlotte, taking notes for Emma, and sacrificing his own time and energy for people who didn’t seem to care about him at all.

As he stood in line at Starbucks, his phone buzzed with a message from Emma. *“How’s it going? Did you get good notes for me?”*

David stared at the screen, his fingers hovering over the keyboard. He wanted to tell her the truth—that he was drowning under the weight of her and Charlotte’s demands. But instead, he typed, *“Yeah, it’s going fine. I’ll have everything ready for you.”*",2,1740512576.0,cuck_femdom_tales,0,1.0,False
1iy3tlf,https://www.reddit.com/r/indianapolis/comments/1iy3tlf/my_list_of_coffee_shops_around_indianapolis/,"My list of coffee shops around Indianapolis, ranked 1-10","Fair note about this list, I have only tried coffee shops I know use house-made syrups. Coffee places that use Torani or Monin are kind of awful (personal opinion.)

Some notes as well, I tend to mainly order lattes. I’m not really a mocha person, so I stick with vanilla, brown sugar, pumpkin, or just overall sweeter flavors. If that’s not your jam, my list may not speak to you. Anywho, I hope it helps my fellow coffee lovers trying to find a good spot! I’m also 20, so I can’t drink alcohol for anyone worried some of these locations are purely bars.

P.S. I slightly judge baristas who pour espresso over ice and then add milk. I feel it changes the espressos flavor by temp shocking it, and I don’t like the inconsistency of how much milk is in my drink. I like when my milk is measured with the syrup amount weighed in, and then the espresso is added. Just my opinion!


- MOTW coffee 2/10
— awful service when I went. I ordered a biscoff latte. the barista poured the espresso with chunks of biscoff butter over ice, then milk. ew.

- provider 5/10
— nice aesthetic of the place, but pretty small. overall the coffee was fine.

- bovaconti coffee 6/10
— same with provider, but their service was wonderful.

- indie coffee roasters 6/10 (uses monin other than some sig drinks)
— their signature drinks have house made syrups, otherwise they use monin. their signature drinks are definitely worth a try.

- amberson coffee & grocer 7/10
— really cute, hole in the wall sort of place. the downside is if you’d like a to-go drink, they require you pay an extra dollar for a jar you bring back. not very convenient to use, messy if you’re moving at all and trying to take a sip. plus, my jar wasn’t clean. ick. very yummy though.

- tinker coffee co. 7/10
— pretty good! just nothing to write home about.

- JAVA house 7/10
— probably the best cold brew i’ve ever had.

- prufrock coffee 8/10
— the fun canning experience with a to go drink made it so much better. and, the coffee is really good.

- parlor coffee
— veryyy aesthetic looking, right next to a penn & beech (i think?) is also a bar, but their sig drinks are weird.

- brickhouse coffee 9/10
— so yummy. they also sell their syrups!  

- commissary coffee 9/10
— omg. one of my favorites. they’re also a bar!

- ascend coffee 9/10
— genuinely the only good coffee around castleton. very kind people, and their seasonal menus are so good.

- YAFA golden coffee 10/10 (mainly just their pumpkin spice lattes)
— their pumpkin spice is to die for. best in the city. overall though, eh. they keep their pumpkin for a majority of the year though I believe.

It will go away with time and patience. I got two endoscopes and a colonoscopy, CAT scans x-rays ultrasounds bloodwork you name it. I thought I had something a lot worse going on with me. I'm still not 100% healed. I would say I'm about 80% better still dealing with some digestive issues but nowhere near as bad as I was the last eight months I was taking Pantozparil 40 mg in the morning and at night and on a very strict diet, eating mostly very bland, chicken vegetables, and the combination of brown rice, white rice, depending on which one would make me feel better at different times for breakfast I would have oatmeal, eggs, omelettes, very bland and for lunch dinner and all the rest of the meals mostly chicken, rice and vegetables of some sort fruit  in between those that would have bananas lots of bananas very ripe bananas I would wait till the bananas would get brown spots on them before I ate them. Also, ate the actual aloe gel I would get aloe from Stater Brothers fillet it all up and I would only eat the inside if you go on YouTube, there's people that teach you how to prepare it. It's not hard I would fillet only the inside leave the skin and throw it away. The inside looks like a clear translucent meat. I would soak it in water for 15 minutes, two times rinse it off and put it back in a bowl of water and then eat it before my meals to help soothe my stomach, not sure if that worked very much but I did it anyway of course I stayed away from all citric acid no coffee, no teas straight water for a long time the little by little I was able to move onto a coconut water by the vita Coco's to be exact two months ago I was put on the Zoloft started at 25 mg worked my way up to 50 did that for about six weeks and then now I'm tapering off I'm almost no longer taking it. Not sure if that helped but at the moment I was going through a lot of anxiety, cause I thought it was dying. It did allow me to sleep better at night anyway if you have any questions or need some advice I'm here. I know the feeling and man it was horrible, but it does get better.

(My memory is really bad and I struggle to even remember to not mess or move around certain things with his altar because I like moving things around and I feel it's disrespectful for me to do it unless I say I will first.)

I have had this sort of thing happen though where I have this candle devoted to him, but I don't want to fully burn it out until I have a new one to devote to him so I haven't lit it in a while. It's been maybe a month since I've last lit it because I want to save it until I have a new one, but when I walk into my room, I'll get hit with this strong scent of my candle and sometimes a warm presence.

I'm not sure if it's just my mind, but it reminds me of him and it feels very comforting and it helps me feel safer when in my own private space, kind of like I'm being welcomed and hugged if that makes sense? I am still new to worshipping him, so it could just be a feeling I get. Currently, I am really curious to how other people feel the presence of the gods and deities they worship or what it feels like to be in a presence of that deity, because I am really interested in other people's experience with them!",5,1740512456.0,Hellenism,1,1.0,False

I was diagnosed with depression, anxiety, and PTSD. From ages 10-19, life felt like a blur. I wasn’t suicidal, but I also didn’t have the will to keep living. When COVID hit at 19, I stopped going to therapy. I did okay in college, but depression kept coming in waves, making me procrastinate everything. My GPA dropped, and the only thing that gave me peace was the gym.

I tried Lexapro for a few months, but it made me feel robotic. Gabapentin and Escitalopram kept me alert, but my anxiety got worse. From 21-22, after a bad breakup, I experimented with substances— (3 times) MDMA, (twice) LSD, (3 times)mushrooms, and cannabis. I smoked weed daily for a year but avoided hard drugs because I was scared of addiction. Quitting weed was tough at first, but I’ve been substance-free for six months and no longer crave it.

When my family found out about my cannabis use, it got ugly. My parents don’t believe in psychiatric meds, so they never supported me getting treatment. Now, I work as an auditor and am interviewing for corporate jobs, but I’m struggling to focus again—just like in college. My therapist stopped calling, and despite journaling, working out, and spending time with loved ones, I still feel this constant sadness. It’s exhausting forcing myself to focus, and it just makes me more anxious. My inability to focus at work, on projects, makes me depressed and anxious. I always feel tired and drowsy no matter how much I try to force myself to focus. I tried coffee, tea, pre-workout and nothing. 

I asked my psychiatrist about ADHD or ADD since my mom, brother, and sister have it, but my mom told them about my past drug use. Now, my psychiatrist thinks I’m just seeking drugs or my next fix Like a drug addict?. I switched psychiatrists, but I feel lost. Should I even keep trying for medication, or is there another way to get help? I feel stuck in this cycle, and I don’t know what to do.

My psychiatrist tried medicating me from ages 12-19 and I said no. I quit medication because the depression and anxiety were about the same and my focus worsened. Any advice helps. ",1,1740512438.0,AskPsychiatry,0,1.0,False

Our local area is quite an affluent area and we have recently taken the leap into expanding the business x5. This means we need to hire for a couple different roles such as customer service, operations etc. 

We put jobs out on indeed and had tons of applicants. Most of which were quite clearly overqualified for the roles and would be taking a very serious pay cut (We were very transparent with being a fairly new business of 4 years taking on our first large warehouse so could only offer to pay maximum of 28k an annum depending on the role. The roles were for taking phone calls, helping customers track orders etc or on production)

We spoke to 52 people for interviews across the various roles. Then only 36 showed up for the interviews. Many of which didn’t even know the company name nor put their phones down. We have hired 4 people. One of which over the course of the two weeks she worked for us was only active on her computer for 7 hours over the 2 week period… with 8 hour working days. We found this out after a customer phoned up angry that her issue hadn’t been dealt with and we checked the computer logs.

Another who was late both days she worked. Then never turned up again after it being brought up with her. Our other two are absolute GEMS! So hard working, great to be around. 

As a small family business we don’t have too many perks like you would at google but we really try and look after employees like family. Coffees, sweet treats, help where Ever we can with things etc. If there is a big trip or something we even offer bonuses for spending for activities whilst away along with extra pay & food covered. 

My issue is, all the people we are having apply are around 18-25 which is great. Myself I am 23 and started the business when I left school. It seems to be though that everyone has lost any sort of drive. We’ve had people say they will consider applying if we increase the wage to 50k etc which as a small business isn’t feasible to take that risk. Especially with people being late, lack of effort etc. 

What would be a drive for you to push more as I am more than open to give pay rises & bonuses regularly and often have a 6 month salary review for our other staff. I am just struggling to find people who have the drive. I am not fussed if someone isn’t trained or hasn’t gone to university as we are there to support. Everyone starts from somewhere but it seems that just the idea of job progression doesn’t work any more for the younger generation and that’s all we have applying who fit our pay (I understand it is lower however we aren’t Amazon or google. We are a family shop)  

I also would like to add. We offer monthly bonuses depending on your productivity. 

Also those who have had similar issues with finding team members but succeeded in the end. Where did you search for them? Any tips to keep on top of people who are slacking without micromanaging. Everyone has good days and bad days however when someone’s had a couple bad days it’s hard not to keep an eye on everything they do which isn’t the way I’d like to run the business. Would love to run it as a cohesive team.

Any advice or perks we could offer to help new starters have some drive us greatly appreciated.

I’d like to add there is now a team of 8 of us however 6 of us were working from the start and have grown it together which has created a great team atmosphere. ",1,1740512309.0,UKJobs,5,1.0,False

Brimstone (The Boss Who Treats the Office Like a Military Base) – Starts every meeting with “Alright, listen up.” Sends emails with “URGENT” in the subject line, even if it's just about the office coffee machine. Brings his own massive thermos to work and calls it his tactical fuel supply.

Sage (The HR Lady Who Keeps This Place From Falling Apart) – Fixes every problem, from office drama to actual medical emergencies. If you trip over your own feet, she’s already there with a Band-Aid. If the building's walls break down, she somehow reconstructs it with her own wall.

Chamber (The Guy Who Works Half the Day and Still Gets Promoted) – Shows up late, leaves early, and somehow makes more money than you. Calls every coffee break “a well-calculated investment of time.” His desk setup looks like it belongs to a billionaire supervillain. If the printer breaks, he just buys a new one instead of fixing it. 

Phoenix (The Intern Who Thinks He’s Running the Place) – Walks into meetings like he owns the company. Sends one email and spends the next 30 minutes hyping himself up.  Set the office microwave on fire thrice already. 

Jett (The Employee Who Works Fast but Somehow Never Looks Busy) – Always zips around the office, finishes tasks in record time, then spends the rest of the day pretending to be productive. Can reply to an email, grab coffee, and avoid the manager all at once. Uses office supplies like she’s in an action movie—has definitely flipped a pen into someone’s coffee by accident. If you challenge her to finish something faster, she’ll do it, just to flex.


Breach (The Guy Who Doesn’t Know His Own Volume) – You can hear this dude from the parking lot. Claps way too hard in meetings. Accidentally knocked over three monitors while telling a story. Once bumped into the vending machine so hard that it gave out free snacks. Has never whispered in his life.

Reyna (The Sales Rep Who Intimidates Clients Into Signing Deals) – You either buy from her, or you fear for your life. If a client hesitates, she just stares at them until they “reconsider.” If you mess up at work, she steals your project and takes all the credit. Drinks coffee like it’s the blood of her enemies.

Killjoy (The IT Person Who Judges You for Not Knowing Basic Tech Stuff) – Fixes your laptop in three seconds but won’t let you forget how incompetent you are. Every time she walks by, you suddenly feel like you’re using your computer wrong. Probably has a secret program monitoring everyone’s search history.

Neon (The Employee Who Moves at 2x Speed for No Reason) – Always somehow late even though she moves faster than humanly possible. Types so fast it sounds like gunfire. If there’s an open path in the hallway, she’s sprinting through it. Left for lunch five minutes ago and is already back.

Sova (The Office Gossip Who Knows Everything) – Finds every lost item, every deleted email, and every secret workplace affair. Just casually drops classified information into conversation. If someone’s out sick, he knows what they have, when they’ll be back, and their mother’s maiden name. Says ""I have found them"" at least once a day.

Yoru (The Guy Who “Works from Home” But No One Knows What He Does) – Says he's “on another call” every time you ask for an update. Shows up to Zoom meetings and doesn't speak or move an inch(almost like a clone). Nobody knows what he actually works on, but somehow, his paycheck keeps clearing. If you try to find him in the office, he mysteriously disappears.

Omen (The Quiet Guy Who’s Always There But Never Talks) – Nobody remembers hiring him, but he has an office. The lights flicker when he enters a room. Sends emails with cryptic one-liners like “All things fade away” when someone asks for a project update. Somehow always behind you when you turn around.

Gekko (The Guy Who Lets His Pets Do His Job) – Doesn't actually do work—his little buddies do it for him. Sends a tiny creature to deliver reports. Once let his pet handle a client meeting, and it went better than expected. Brings his whole zoo to work, and HR has given up trying to stop him.",2,1740512244.0,ValorantMemes,0,1.0,False

Do I even need to open the burrs and clean them? If so how often are other owners of this machine doing so and how do you clean it (just a brush?). I have not noticed any significant increase in retention yet. 

Have you noticed any improvement in the taste of espresso after cleaning the burrs ? (I don’t want to go through the hassle if it doesn’t lead to any improvement in the taste) 

Also is there any simple way of ensuring that the ‘zero’ setting is not altered on the df54 every time I open up the machine for cleaning.

On the evening of September 8, 1970, the skies over England hummed with tension. RAF Binbrook, a bustling airbase in Lincolnshire, was alive with the low growl of jet engines as the Cold War cast its long, paranoid shadow. Captain William ""Bill"" Schaffner, a 28-year-old United States Air Force exchange pilot, sat in the ready room, nursing a cup of lukewarm coffee. A seasoned flier with a reputation for cool-headedness, Schaffner had been stationed in Britain for months, piloting the sleek, lightning-fast Lightning F.6 interceptor as part of a joint NATO operation. Tonight, though, something unusual was brewing.

The radar operators at RAF Staxton Wold had picked up an anomaly—a fast-moving blip streaking across their screens, heading southwest over the North Sea. It wasn’t a Soviet bomber, nor a wayward civilian plane. It didn’t respond to radio hails, and its speed defied explanation. The call came down the line: scramble a jet, intercept the bogey, identify it. Schaffner, ever the professional, was airborne within minutes, the twin engines of his Lightning roaring as he climbed into the ink-black sky.

""Okay, Control, this is XS894,"" Schaffner’s calm voice crackled over the radio. ""I’m at 10,000 feet, heading 030. What am I looking for?""

""XS894, we’ve got an unidentified contact at 20,000 feet, moving at high speed,"" came the reply from the ground controller. ""No transponder, no communication. Get eyes on it and report back.""

The North Sea stretched out below him, a vast, restless expanse glinting faintly under the moonlight. Schaffner adjusted his course, scanning the horizon through his cockpit canopy. Minutes ticked by, the silence broken only by the steady hum of his aircraft. Then, at 21:47, he saw it—a faint shimmer, like a star that refused to stay still, darting across the sky ahead of him.

""Control, I’ve got visual,"" Schaffner reported, his voice steady but tinged with curiosity. ""It’s… I don’t know what it is. It’s not a conventional aircraft. It’s glowing—bright, like a magnesium flare, but moving too fast. I’m closing in.""

The radar operators watched as Schaffner’s Lightning closed the gap, the two blips converging on their screens. ""XS894, can you describe it further?"" the controller pressed.

""It’s… oval-shaped, maybe 100 feet across,"" Schaffner said, his tone shifting to unease. ""No wings, no exhaust. It’s changing colors—blue, green, then white. I’m at 500 knots, and it’s pulling away like I’m standing still. I’m going to—wait, it’s turning toward me.""

The radio crackled with static. On the ground, the controller leaned forward, frowning. ""XS894, say again?""

""It’s coming right at me!"" Schaffner’s voice rose, a rare crack in his composure. ""It’s—Jesus, it’s huge up close. I’m breaking off—""

The transmission cut out. Radar showed Schaffner’s Lightning veering sharply, then slowing, its altitude dropping rapidly. The unidentified blip accelerated impossibly, vanishing off the screens in seconds. ""XS894, come in,"" the controller barked. ""Bill, do you read me?"" Silence.

Search and rescue teams were dispatched immediately, helicopters and ships scouring the North Sea through the night. But there was no wreckage, no oil slick, no sign of Captain Schaffner or his Lightning. It was as if the sky had swallowed them whole.

A month later, on October 7, a fishing trawler hauling its nets off the coast of Grimsby snagged something heavy. The crew winched it up, expecting a sunken wreck or debris. Instead, they found themselves staring at the intact fuselage of an RAF Lightning—XS894. The aircraft was remarkably preserved, its cockpit canopy still sealed shut, the ejector seat still in place. But when they pried it open, Captain William Schaffner was gone. No body, no flight suit, no trace of the man who’d flown into the night to chase a phantom.

The discovery sparked a firestorm of questions. How had the plane sunk to the seabed with its cockpit undisturbed? Why hadn’t Schaffner ejected? And most hauntingly, where had he gone? The official report chalked it up to a tragic accident—perhaps disorientation, hypoxia, or a mechanical failure. The UFO sighting was dismissed as a misidentification, possibly a weather balloon or atmospheric phenomenon. But those who’d heard Schaffner’s final transmission weren’t so sure.

Whispers spread among the ranks at RAF Binbrook. Some swore they’d seen strange lights over the North Sea in the weeks that followed. Others claimed Schaffner had encountered something beyond human understanding—something that didn’t just take his plane, but took *him*. A few old-timers at the base even spoke of a classified debriefing, hushed up by top brass, hinting at radar logs and recordings that never saw the light of day.

To this day, the disappearance of Captain William Schaffner remains one of aviation’s enduring mysteries. His Lightning sits in a hangar somewhere, a silent relic of that fateful night. And out over the North Sea, where the waves churn and the sky stretches endless, some still wonder: what did he see in those final moments—and what took him beyond the reach of the world?

Hoping for some advice please and your experiences. For some info:

  
29yo Male,

UK,

Personal trainer & online fitness coach

  
Heading to spend a few months in Bali and Australia later this year. Have already decided on Bali plans, pretty easy given the size of the country, but I'm stuck with where to spend some time in Australia.

  
1. Sunshine Coast vs Gold Coast for all things fitness, training, gym, healthy eating cafes, coffee culture? Where gets the vote please?

  
2. Also is there a huge discrepancy in living costs, car rental, Airbnb prices between the 2?

  
3. Lastly what sort of areas or towns in each location specifically are ideal for this sort of lifestyle please? I will be working with my current UK client base all online, not looking to PT on the trip, basically taking a long working holiday to test the waters of the lifestyle in these places in the hopes of maybe making a permanent move later in the future.

1iy3h0n,https://www.reddit.com/r/raisedbynarcissists/comments/1iy3h0n/nmom_my_pregnancy/,NMom & My Pregnancy,"I am wondering if anyone has dealt with something similar. I'm 30 weeks pregnant with the first and only grandchild of my mom and my partners divorced parental units. I'm 34, done years of therapy, went through 2 years of infertility and when I told her I was pregnant she called me a liar, because she had told me 2 months prior that ""I looked pregnant"" and she was convinced I lied to her when I told her I wasn't (at the time)... 

All that to say...

My mom and I are not close she's a narcissist and of course it's my fault. At 15 weeks pregnant, she came over for a coffee and she asked me what was my biggest stress and I (mistakingly) said navigating three sets of grandparents, expectations and the overwhelm I feel now carrying this ""golden grandchild"" she got very upset called me cold, disrespectful and told me I am pushing my village away and she doesn't understand how I even have relationships. As she started getting defensive I told her she is not my priority and my priority is my child and partner. She then said with tears in her eyes ""Well, are you not going to take care of me, I'm 72 you know?!"" And I said ""how can I support you and what would that look like for you"" she said ""yeah exactly, see you don't love me""...

So that conversation left me feeling like crap, but ever since then I've resolved to set boundaries and not let her ruin my pregnancy or my experience becoming a mother.

Yesterday, she was sharing on a chat with my sister and I about how amazing it was to carry both of us, how motherhood is so amazing and she was so blessed to do it twice. She said she can't wait to meet her grandbaby. I said ""That's very sweet of you, once baby arrives X and I will be taking some time to settle into parenthood and will let immediate family know when we are ready for visitors."" She said ""Oh"". Then 2 hours later says ""well, I hope we will get pictures to share in the joy"" I replied ""we will be giving all the grandparents an e-frames that we will share photos to"" she said ""NVM, you didn't understand what I said"" so I said ""ok"". She says ""Ok? You don't understand it you don't care to understand? Ttyl"". So I left it.

Today, she messages me to tell me ""I'm 72, my back hurts, I'm old Hard to think of the future now . I really never did much . Mostly day to day. But now with a baby coming I think of it a lot of things I will not be here for makes me sad. I hope I get a good ten years at least. have a good day""

So.. I said ""that must be a really difficult feeling.""

Any advice? Other than try and not let her behaviour get to me, she's clear using manipulation because she wants me to remember she's going to die and I should let her experience what she wants to experience when it comes to her expectations around  my child....",2,1740511706.0,raisedbynarcissists,2,1.0,False

'governed'. But we're NOT here for that instead, I want to share this hug with you all.


I dropped my beloved child and friend off at a weekly engagement hosted by a local (right leaning) church. I adore these people. They treat every single kid like their own and many of us have now attended this program for over a generation.
I've been vocal on my socials regarding my opinion of the state of things. Today a highly respected maternal figure pulled me aside and gave me the warmest, most comfoting hug. She whispered empathetic words in my ear which lifted my spirits considerably. 


There is a lot going on, each of us has a heaping pot of something boiling on the stove, and thats why were here; to over flow.
So I offer to each of you, regardless of your opinions, the biggest, warmest, most comforting mama-bear hug I can supply.
 Mama you are worth it.
You are worth taking good care of.
You are worth drinking your favorite coffee at whatever temperature you prefer. 
You are worth 5 minutes alone in your closet to gather your strength and your peace.
You are worth a hot shower and clean teeth.
You're worth having your laundry folded for you (even if its done wrong). You're worth not having to pick up socks.

Mothers, we are heros. All of us. I'm proud of you.
I'm proud of you for staying when you should go because you must. I'm proud of you for going. I'm proud of you work driving to work or working from home. We shouldn't have to cheer lead our selves, but I am rooting for you. You deserve for your favorite mug to be left alone. You deserve for bedtime to be easy. 
I'm just a stranger on the internet with opinions, but I love you. I see you, your struggle and your fight and my flag is waving in your honor. I am screaming from across the world that you are awesome. I believe in you.

Our relationship had entered the rut so to speak with all the built up resentment over all of our offenses towards one another.  I seek to talk about things, she shrinks away and doesn’t want to even try.  Kids are all grown and out on their own.  I run a small business and make a very modest income, just enough to pay the bills.  Wife has a better paying job and that’s where our health coverage comes from.  I’m 52, she’s 42.  I have the flexibility to set my schedule daily.  She has a rigid schedule that she likes but it’s become obvious that there is resentment over her leaving and I’m still in pajamas.  We split major household bills evenly from a joint account.  We each have our personal accounts and we do whatever we please with that money without any complaints.  The past couple years the marriage had become empty feeling almost like we were just roommates.  Mid January she wakes me up in the middle of the night to ask if I’m happy.  I said that I was about as happy as I could be why do you ask?  That’s when she told me she wasn’t in love with me anymore.  A man at her work and her had been flirting and it was the first time another man had made he feel all tingly again and she felt it was only fair to tell me.  First wife cheated so my reaction was jumping to conclusion that they had their future all planned out.  That wasn’t the case.  She said that nothing physical had happened between them, just flirting.  She said she needed space to figure out what she wanted to do.  I left to stay at a buddy’s place and that same day she messages me saying she thinks she may have made the wrong decision and she wanted me to come home.  I did, she was all lovey dovey for the first time in forever and I thought, damn, I’ve dodged a bullet.  She became extremely sexual over the next two weeks, sending naughty texts and pics and all day long buildup to when she got home.  When she got home she would freshen up her makeup, put on a sexy outfit and would have me come in when she was ready.  Now her and I have had some Hot Steamy Times together.  These weren’t anything like that.  It was clear that her heart mind and soul were not present.  It kinda felt like she was just a warm piece of meat.  It did not do anything for me at all.  I got norovirus and was out of commission for a week.  That next weekend I felt good enough to get out and do things.  She went for a hike at this lake where I often bring my little aluminum boat to fish.  There are extensive trails around the water there and often she will be done hiking and will meet me at water’s edge.  We both share locations all the time on iPhones and I always know where she is while in the woods so I can check in on her safety.  
So feeling well enough to get boat out, she tells me she’s going ahead to go hiking.  I soon leave and arrive at the park.  I saw her car parked in the lot and I decided to check her location to get an idea of which trail she was working on.  Location Not Available.  Dread hit the pit of my soul.  I texted her that I was there putting boat in and asked her where she was hiking.  No answer in the next 10 minutes or so.  I fished for about 3 hours, all the while intermittently texting back and forth with her yet still not able to see her location.  She told me she had a poor data connection on the trail she was hiking.  She said she was heading back to me (which I thought was worded oddly).  I clarified what she meant and then she gave me a specific meeting point to pick her up with the boat.  Within 10 minutes, she calls me to tell me that the two beers she took with her hiking had her intoxicated and that she was on her way home.  She wanted me to come home and she would have pizza for us.
I get home, no pizza as I enter and pass through kitchen entry into home.  Look in typical areas and not finding my wife.  I checked the spare bedroom upstairs and she was passed out fully dressed with covers partly draped over her bottom half.  She wanted me to lay down with her so I did.  Then she started kissing me rather passionately; actually more like aggressively.  She told me she wanted me to fvck her.  I replied saying that I didn’t think it would be very gentlemanly of me to take advantage of her current state of intoxication.  She said she wanted me right then… so we had sex and she seemed to really be into it.  (She only reaches O with clit vibe).  Rest of night went fairly normal.  Next morning we’re having coffee together and she seems off.  She goes to take a shower.  When she return from her long shower I can tell that she had been balling her eyes out.  That when she told me she didn’t go hiking the day before, she went to her coworkers house and had sex with him.
I am crushed.  She begged for forgiveness, said she immediately knew it was a mistake and that she didn’t want to lose our marriage over a stupid teenager type impulsive decision after drinking alcohol.  She was slow in telling me his name, took several days.  She told me the guy literally works next to her desk.  How can I ever trust that this shit doesn’t keep going on.  The house we live in she bought with a USDA loan than required her to be a single mom.  I had a recent foreclosure from prior marriage so it worked out just find except my name wasn’t on anything.  We had been together 5 years when we moved into the house.  We split the bills, I’m the one that actually makes sure the bills are paid each month.  We’ve argued in the past and the subject of the equity in the house would come up and she had always said she would keep the house and buy me out of my share of the equity.  I have my first grandchild on the way roughly two hours from where I live now.  I’m at a place where I’m ready for a drastic career change.  It seems the right and easier thing to do would be to file for divorce and move closer to my grandson and start a new life, career there.  Wife is begging me to stay swearing it’s over and he means nothing to her.  I think there has to be a bit more to it than what she has shared with me.  I have no way to prove it.  I really do love her.  Never ever thought she could do something like this.

I am not comfortable doing hard kicks or getting aggressively swept, as my condition can potentially worsen, and I feel bad for being someone my Kru has to accommodate, although he's been really cool.

I've always been lonely growing up, so I have a lot of crippling low self-esteem. Once I discovered Muay Thai, I loved it. It felt like I had found something I was missing my whole life—companionship, self esteem, humility—I can go on. My relationships also improved, I actually enjoyed going to the gym again, stuffing my face with food to get stronger, etc. I felt like there was finally something to me, instead of always watching Formula One or going to Cars and Coffee, just enduring the painful wait to one day have a car I am proud to own and feel like I am a part of the community.

For a moment, I felt happy. But it seemingly being all stripped away hurts.

On a more positive note, I know I won’t always be able to do everything in life. I'll probably never do more than one or two amateur fights or be as good as I thought I'd be, so I'll do my best with what I can and just enjoy Muay Thai. I can still build my cardio, condition my body, and develop mean hands, elbows, and knees. Eventually, I'll build myself up to being more comfortable with low kicks, as those feel pretty okay for me. I will also stay on top of my recovery, be consistent with my physical therapy, and, of course, put my overall well-being above all.

I know Muay Thai shouldn’t be my only medicine for what I personally struggle with. I consistently go to therapy and try to work on understanding myself. I was just wondering if anyone had a similar story to mine and was looking for some support.

Not into clubbing & prefer to avoid noisy/crowded places. From the sacred to the naughtiest, my bandwidth encompasses all topics. We may just indulge in some warm eye gazing, but let me admit that I am a sucker for physical touch & cuddles too :) Everything with consent & within boundaries, of course. I am exposed to Tantra and BDSM, in case that piques your interest. The idea is to slip into something that feels natural, comfortable and leaves an indelible impression.

Please be below 50. I don't have a fixed age criteria on the lower side, as long as you carry maturity in your heart. Have had amazing connections with age gaps. Kindly DM if you wish to explore whether we might vibe.",1,1740511133.0,SFWr4rIndia,0,1.0,False

1iy36ew,https://www.reddit.com/r/AmIOverreacting/comments/1iy36ew/aio_best_friend_of_20_years_completely_ghosted_me/,AIO… best friend of 20+ years completely ghosted me without any reasoning.,"One of my very closest friends ghosted me and I don’t know how to deal with it right now. Few things on her and myself:

She’s been in multiple relationships where once they’re together (even before they’re official), she drops everyone to focus on them. I’ve never been the type to do this, at least not to her extent. I always make time for my friends and would go crazy if I didn’t have that time with them every week. She would occasionally pencil me in for a coffee date, but it always felt extremely rushed and she was constantly placing judgment on me for things I’d vent to her about, mostly just casual convo about my s/o and sometimes if we got into a fight or something, she was always trying to make it seem like a make or break situation. Like god forbid you have a disagreement with the person you’re dating and I’ve now been with him for almost 10 years and we’re extremely happy and healthy. 

I was always really close with her family and she was always close with mine too. I had been on multiple family vacations with her parents, invited to all the events at their home with their family, and vice versa. Her parents are awesome and we’ve all always been there for one another. 

Over the last probably 3 years, I noticed she would take forever to reply to my messages (if she even replied at all). In the last 1-1.5 years, she won’t answer the phone (not one time). In the last 6-8 months, she won’t reply to any of my texts messages. I started to think to myself, “okay, I know she’s probably busy with work…” or just making normal connections in my mind as to why she wasn’t ever replying or making time for me and I’ve definitely reached a point where I’m extremely angry and have reached out to her twice now about why she’s not talking to me. 

Zero replies.

Well, one reply… it was after I kindly (no sarcasm either, I was so upset but still trying to make sure it didn’t come off mean or anything and she didn’t acknowledge my message at all. She didn’t reply to the message I sent her but a month later sent me a text saying “Happy Birthday” but didn’t say a word about my message. I didn’t reply to her HBD message because I was so upset. 

This last year has been so hard for me because my mother is terminally ill and I expressed to her in my message that it really sucks not being able to reach my best friend with good things or bad things that are happening in my life right now. I didn’t know her diagnosis at the time I sent the first message, but I had ran into her folks at a blue festival close to where I live, and just asked her mom if she had heard anything from her as to why she wasn’t speaking to me. She said she had no idea and then I started telling her about how it’s awful not being able to talk to your best friend during a time of need and that I had reached out to her with no reply. 

Anyway, wrapping up this entire post, I reached out to her again the next day because I was afraid her mom would tell her about my moms illness (my mother is extremely private so she doesn’t want people knowing, as she’s still very active in her role at her job, and for now, feels she wants that kept between close family and friends). I told her the bare minimum and just asked her to tell her mother to mums the word and that I expected the same respect from her towards the situation. She replied back a very short “I’m sorry to hear that” and nothing else. I replied back saying how I wish she would just tell me what is going on between her and I, because clearly something is going on and I thought she respected me enough to tell me the truth even if she doesn’t want to be friends. Still no reply.

* **Age:** 7 months 27 days
* **DOB:** June 29, 2024
* **Sex/Neuter status:** Henry is a neutered male & Coffee Bean is a unneutered male
* **Breed:** domestic rabbits
* **Body weight:**
* **History:** chronic respiratory infections
* **Clinical signs:** sneezing (both), mucus in eyes (both), mucus in nose (only rabbit 2), trouble breathing sometimes/labored breathing (both; I take them to the vet when this one happens)
* **Duration:** since they were born (they are brothers)
* **Your general location:** chicago IL
* **Links to test results, vet reports, X-rays etc.**

so some background I got these rabbits because I rescued a rabbit from my workplace and they have gotten this rabbit from a random backyard breeder. This rabbit (Xochi) ended up being pregnant and gave birth at my house. the two smallest of the litter (Henry & Coffee Bean) have always been sicker than the rest. For as long as I can remember they have had eye mucus and when they got a little older they started sneezing and having trouble breathing sometimes/labored breathing. I always have to treat this with antibiotics and then they are okay for the time I give them antibiotics but then they always go back to how they were before. I feel like I have a pharmacy in my fridge. I have TMS, Meloxicam, Terbutaline, Baytril and Zeniquin. Some of these medications I have multiple of because they take it so frequently. I also have two eye drops for them. Everytime they get breathing problems I take them to the vet, she perscribes antibiotics/congestion medications, I give it to them, they get better and when I stop they go right back to how they were. Even when I do 2 week course antibiotics this happens. I always give them their medicine on time I even have an app, alarm and routine for it when I do. I don't understand why they aren't getting better. My only guess is that they could be a product of extreme breeding or Brachycephalic rabbits. I have noticed that their face shape is flatter than their mother and other brothers. I wish I could show pictures but Brachycephalic rabbits basically have shorter faces due to extreme breeding and even thought they look ""cuter"" it causes problems. like breathing problems. Is there anything I can even do about this?

One of the Youtube shorts that she's posted since returning is [this quick tip](https://www.youtube.com/shorts/WdgCXl0nqRM) about how in Spain, many people shorten ""hasta luego"" to something more like ""ta luego"". This seemed right to me; I moved to Spain for a year as a non-native speaker and this is something I picked up on my own just from experience. It's really just what I instinctively say when leaving a coffee shop or something of the sort.

However, many Spanish speakers (not all, but many) in the comments are quite mad at this advice, and insist that nobody does this, or that it's childish to do so. Some commenters even insist that nobody in Spain says it like this and that everybody pronounces the whole phrase every time; I know from experience that this is not the case, at least in central Spain. Does anybody have any insight as to why this advice is so controversial? Is it a matter of perception, where some people don't realize that they're pronouncing the phrase that way? Is it purely regional, and this only applies to Spain? I would love to know, thanks!",11,1740510179.0,Spanish,19,1.0,False

A guy I didn't know (24M) texted me, privately, saying he would love to join me for a drink. So, we met up at the bar, he insisted on paying for my drink and we talked for a good 2:30 hours. During this time we talked about our hobbies and what we like (turns out we have quite a few things in common) and he was being flirty for a good portion of it (things like him saying he has always had a thing for girls with short hair - which I do have – and, after I danced a little bit to some of the music, insisting I must have a really good physic, cardio and stamina - to which I replied not really that I could not run for more than 5min to save my life - to which he replied saying oh yeah, but there are so many other types of cardio and so many ways to exercise it, for sure you have great cardio and a great physic. Fast forward 1 week and we meet up again for coffee, while planning the meet up he asked me if I wanted him to bring a girl friend (as in a female friend), I said that I thought it would be just us, but if he wanted, we could be three people. The friend ended up only joining us at the end, for max 5 min. During the coffee we talked a lot, about serious and heavy stuff, and during it he said that after some reckless behavior on his part in the past his ""girlfriend"" didn't like it. He didn't mention this ""girlfriend"" any other time, and I was a little shocked to ask more and then it just didn't fit with the convo anymore. During that afternoon he brought up again how girls with short hair are so much more attractive to him than girls with long hair. He also told me he was super exited for me to meet her because I love to dance and he didn't (which we had talked about the first time we met and I had told him I didn't really have friends here that liked to dance) so he wanted me to meet her because she also likes to dance and that way I could have a female friend to go dancing with ( we also talked about how I didn’t feel completely safe going out dancing and drinking by myself as a woman on the first time we met).

The thing is, he chose to meet up with me, he was flirting and now I don't know if he has a girlfriend or if he meant it as a female friend (girl friend) since that’s how he referred to the female friend that joined us.

I really don’t know if he wants just friendship or not, and whether he has a partner or not.

1iy2scv,https://i.redd.it/2qx7cbxv1cle1.png,How the Future of Work is Changing How We Manage the Winter Slump,"**TL;DR:** The workplace is evolving with remote/hybrid models and AI-driven tools shaping how we address seasonal challenges like the winter slump. While technology offers exciting opportunities for mood tracking and burnout prevention, the human element—empathy, connection, and leadership—is still essential for resilience. Combining the two creates workplaces that support well-being and growth.  

---

**How the Future of Work is Changing Seasonal Well-Being**  

Winter can feel like an uphill battle for many professionals. The shorter days, post-holiday blues, and slower pace can create a slump that impacts both individuals and teams. But the way we work is changing rapidly, and so are the tools and strategies available to address these challenges. So, what does the future of work hold for managing seasonal well-being, and how can leaders and organizations adapt?  

### Emerging Trends Shaping the Workplace  

**1. The Role of AI and Technology**  
AI-driven tools are no longer limited to improving processes—they’re becoming powerful allies in managing mental health and workplace morale. For example:  
- AI platforms can analyze patterns in team engagement and flag early signs of burnout.  
- Mood-tracking apps use behavioral data to suggest personalized strategies for well-being.  
- Virtual Employee Assistance Programs (EAPs) provide accessible, real-time support for mental health.  

While these tools can be incredibly effective, they work best when combined with human leadership. Technology can detect problems, but it’s empathy and connection that solve them.  

**2. Remote and Hybrid Work**  
The shift to remote and hybrid work models has given employees more flexibility, but it also brings unique challenges. Without the natural social interactions of in-person work, employees may feel isolated, which can exacerbate seasonal lows. Leaders need to be proactive about fostering connection, even in virtual environments. Regular check-ins, collaborative projects, and even virtual social events can help bridge the gap.  

**3. Expanding Wellness Programs**  
Future-focused workplaces are investing in comprehensive wellness programs that address more than just physical health. Emotional and mental well-being are becoming priorities, with initiatives that include mindfulness training, resilience workshops, and even financial wellness resources. These programs aren’t just nice-to-haves—they’re essential for creating resilient, engaged teams.  

### Why the Human Element Still Matters  

No matter how advanced technology becomes, it can’t replace human connection. Leaders who prioritize trust, open communication, and genuine care will always have an edge in creating workplaces where people feel valued and supported. Think of technology as a tool—it enhances, but it doesn’t replace, the fundamental need for empathetic leadership.  

### How You Can Adapt  

If you’re leading a team or simply looking to improve your own experience this winter, here are a few steps to consider:  
- **Leverage Technology Thoughtfully:** Explore tools like mood trackers or virtual wellness platforms, but don’t rely on them exclusively. Use them to complement human interactions.  
- **Focus on Connection:** Whether you’re leading a team or working independently, prioritize communication and social connection. For remote teams, this might mean virtual coffee chats or brainstorming sessions.  
- **Invest in Resilience:** Build skills that prepare you for challenges—both seasonal and beyond. This might include mindfulness practices, stress management techniques, or even professional development opportunities.  

### Looking Ahead  

The future of work isn’t just about productivity—it’s about creating environments where individuals and teams can thrive, no matter the season. As we continue to integrate technology into our workplaces, we must remember that human-centered leadership is the key to unlocking its full potential.

You’re not alone. Time blocking might just be the secret sauce that keeps you from ending your day buried under leftover tasks (or leftover pizza).

**So, what even is time blocking?** It’s a simple concept: you schedule your tasks in dedicated “blocks” of time, giving each activity a mini-spotlight in your day. No more juggling 47 tasks at once—just laser-focused chunks of productivity.

Here’s how I keep it fun and manageable:

• **Name your blocks in a way that excites you.** Instead of calling it “Email Time,” I label that block “Inbox Power Hour.” Sounds cooler, right? It helps me feel pumped rather than dreading boring tasks.  
• **Pair tasks with your natural energy levels.** If you’re a morning person, block off a chunk of time right after that first sip of coffee to tackle your hardest tasks. If you’re a night owl, go for an evening sprint. Lean into your peak hours.  
• **Give yourself wiggle room.** Life isn’t perfect, and schedules often have a mind of their own. I always add a small buffer between blocks so I have time to breathe (or grab another coffee).  
• **Batch similar tasks.** Grouping stuff like emails, calls, and errands keeps you in the zone. Jumping from writing a report to grocery shopping can break your flow faster than you can say “distraction.”  
• **Celebrate small wins.** Completed a block? High-five yourself. Did you finish a giant chunk sooner than you thought? Take a five-minute break to dance it out or scroll memes guilt-free. You earned it.

Ever find yourself ignoring your schedule because it feels too rigid? That’s the beauty of time blocking—you get to design it around the way you naturally work. And once you start seeing how much more you can get done (without feeling like your brain is on fire), you’ll wonder how you ever managed without it.

Sometimes all it takes is a few tweaks to turn a chaotic day into a purposeful one. It’s amazing what can happen when you actually “make time” for what matters most, right?",1,1740509880.0,MaximizeMe,0,1.0,False

What happened is due to my studies—I’m busy, and I don’t communicate with my best friend as usual. We can go for weeks without texting and just talk once to give an update on our lives. However, she just sent a meme, and then she said, “I had a funny dream of you.”

I replied, “What was it?” She said, “We were just sipping coffee and staring at each other.” And I don’t know why, but I asked, “What did I look like?” And she said, “Everything that I was making dua for, as if it happened already,” which is weird.

I don’t know if it’s a sign that God accepted my dua or if it’s just a coincidence, but it’s weird. I don’t tell her what I’m making dua for or what I want, and she said everything I’m making dua for happened.

I(41F) have a younger coworker, Jamie(23F fake name) that has had bit of a crush on me ever since she started the job. I was personally flattered by it but the girl is young enough to be my daughter and I already have a girlfriend so I wasn’t and never would be interested but I still offered to be a friend to her. 

She was cool with that and we would have lunch together sometimes and I would give her advice on things like college and the workforce.

So here is when the problem came in. A few hours ago, I came into work and made some coffee when one of my work friends who I’ll call Richard comes in. We talk a bit until he says “you know, I didn’t know you were into younger women but you learn something new everyday.” I froze, turned to him, and asked what in the hell is he talking about. He then says “Aren’t you and Jamie together now?” I said no we are not, I already have a girlfriend and me and Jamie are just friends. 

Richard turns to me confused and says, “But Jamie has been telling everyone that you left your girlfriend and that you two are dating now.” With that, I left the lounge and went to go look for Jamie. I found her talking to some other coworkers and it was there I heard her telling these people we are in a relationship. I walk over Jamie and the others and ask her what the hell is she doing. She then tries to downplay it but I cut her off and tell her in front of everyone that I am in a happy relationship, she is literally the same age as my nephew, I only saw as her as a friend/little sibling, and I am not and would never be interested in her in that manner. 


Before she could say anything, I stormed out of the building and into my car. I drove down the street to a little coffee shop I frequent where I am writing this right now. I got a few texts from coworkers saying I could have been nicer about it or addressed the matter in private and honestly, I am feeling a little bad about yelling at her in public like that.

However, we're all dealing with the ongoing fallout of the Los Angeles fires (my husband and I lost our apartment due to this). Personally, I feel like it's wrong that we're still going on what was supposed to be a fun trip but that now is clouded by this awful thing that happened to us, but you know, Mardi Gras time policies have prevented us from canceling anything and everything's already been prepaid.

Hopefully I can get an answer here.  I had posted it in r/linux but it was reported as not bein appropriate for there.  So here goes.

I have been using Linux for over a year now. I tried several distros out before settling on PopOS, which I used for the last year. My issue with PopOS were mostly audio in nature. A lot of popping and cracking when using the onboard audio. Having researched it a bit I found this was not an abnormal issue to find with it. My solution was an external sound card which, for the most part, fixed the majority of audio issues. The one issue with PopOS is it would not automatically switch audio sources when the machine was restarted.

I then had some graphics lag when playing online through Steam, Neverwinter Online is the game of preference. I was able to mitigate the lag but began to experience graphics ""flashing"" is the best way I can describe it. I would be playing and suddenly I would get a flash or the character screen, of a different character entirely, or of some place my character had been prior. I realize it could be my graphics card. The thing was I was not getting any lag during the game and I had no issues with anything else I was doing on the computer.

So I decided to switched distros. I had tried Linux Mint before and had enjoyed it, I just felt PopOS suited me better. I did a fresh install and eventually got everything up and running. Now, I am getting graphics lag about forty five minutes to an hour into the game. It is sort of a stuttering type issue. Once again I am having zero issues with anything else graphically. I have once again adjusted setting in Steam with no success. I have adjusted Neverwinter's setting with no success. My machine is a bit older but I wouldn't think it would be having this kind of issue with the graphics unless the card was going bad. However, nothing else is experiencing these issues.

I have posted about the issues in several places with no response. I am hoping someone can point to me the direction to go as far as a distro which will not experience one or the other of these issues. Or possibly point out to me how I can figure out if graphics card is going bad or how to check it. I am posting system information below.

Any help is appreciated. Thanks,

Motodo

1iy2jps,https://www.reddit.com/r/OmahaMutualAid/comments/1iy2jps/local_csas/,Local CSA's,"Hey everyone, I've seen some posts about growing your own food, shopping local, etc. both as a way to avoid giving money to corporations we don't trust and as a way of maintaining some safety and security (not to mention saving money). 

I put together a (short and probably incomplete) list of some of the CSA programs around town. 

CSA stands for Community-Supported Agriculture; the basic way it works is that you buy a ""share"" of a farm's harvest, sometimes phrased as a subscription, and you get a regular package of whatever produce and other goodies the farm is harvesting that year. 

It really helps small farmers because they can use that money at the start of the season, plus it offsets the risk of some kind of catastrophe. They are a really great way to support local, home-grown produce that has all kinds of amazing positive effects (less harmful to the enviornment due to lower transportation costs, often lower use of harmful pesticides, keeps money in the local economy, the list goes on and on). 

It can be a little overwhelming to research, so I put together a really down and dirty list of what each farm offers, some price points, etc. There are a lot of commonalities, and you probably can't go wrong with any of them. 

There is usually a price incentive for getting in early, so if you're interested, now is the time!!

I tried semaglutide before this and I swear it had no effect on me at all, good or bad. I took my first shot of tirz yesterday around 5pm, and it's 12:47pm right now.

It feels kind of crampy and like there's a lot of air in my stomach. I've only had coffee so far today because I don't usually eat my first meal until later in the day, so my stomach is empty besides that. Yesterday I didn't eat anything out of the norm either, or anything greasy, so I'm pretty sure it's from the shot. I'm actually kind of excited because like I said, i felt nothingggg on semaglutide and it just straight up didn't work for me, so I'm hoping this means I'll get results!

We all saw the way she handled the backlash when she admitted her coffee talks were fake. She got defensive and took 0 accountability when she was called out for blatantly lying, and that I can’t support. The whole point of being an influencer is being authentically yourself, and she clearly is not. I used to love her a few years ago but ever since she’s been with Gabe, I’ve seen such a shift in her that i had to unfollow. I hate when influencers are like “just because I put my life online, that doesn’t warrant criticism…” Like yes the fuck it does🤣 it’s literally your job to influence us, we have every right to have our own opinions on what we see.

1iy2he7,https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/1iy2he7/aita_for_ignoring_my_mil_wails/,AITA For ignoring my MIL wails.,"30 f recently moved into a bigger place with my partner 38m with his elderly mother since her husband passed 2 years ago. Shes a very nice old woman, had a stroke in 2010, liked to read and do crossword puzzles, tidy things up around the place, go for walks etc. A year after her husband passed, it became apparent she couldnt live alone. 

I was very clear that I will not be a caretaker. I am coming out of my own trauma and grief and its not something Im willing to do. I am VERY empathetic towards her. Making sure to get her out, taking her places she enjoys, scheduling her hair appointments, keeping her company so she can feel at least some sort of semblance. When I take her out for lunch or coffee everything is fine. In public.

She wont eat. She keeps her phone off, doesnt want to talk to her brother or older son. Understandable. My partner started calling me to get into contact with his mother , so I shut that down. She doesnt want to learn how to do anything for herself. She started moaning and wailing in the early morning and and night. My partner talked to her about its affecting OUR sleep. She stops. She is nice, but she is very much a nightmare patient. Making everything difficult for the staff, with her hysterics to needles. Wont take vitamins we buy that are easy for her to ingest because ""she doesnt like gummies""

When hes here, shes fine. When Im not working and Im here, she starts moaning and wailing in intervals. She communicates just fine. Her speech hasnt been impeded. I have my own mental health issues and do not have the space. She refuses speaking to a grief counsler.  I put on my earbuds and ignore it. Her older son living in another state feels she is being irrational. But of course she is, she's feeling a lot very late in her life. I myself just dont have emotional space to assist with high emotional bursts between working physically demanding job and struggling with my own mental health and grief.

If she expresses with her words whats going on, I am more than happy to help. I sort of feel bad but sort of not.

TLDR: Elder Mother in law grieving, wails without communicating the issue. AITA for putting in earbuds and ignoring it?",8,1740509269.0,AmItheAsshole,6,0.9,False

I love her dearly, and in general she is a very kind and caring person.  But recently her mental health issues have been very draining.

For some background I am quite an anxious person, I get stressed and overwhelmed easily.  It seems to run in my family, but I also suffered some bad physical bullying when I was in school, to the point where I ended up in hospital and I ended up being home schooled. 

I recently finished a period of almost 8 months of therapy, learning how to deal with my anxieties better when they present themselves, as well as tackling the ‘trauma’s’ I have endured.  I did this for two reason, one of them being for myself to improve my quality of life and the other being so that I can be a better partner for my girlfriend.

She has always suffered with anxiety and major insecurity issues, to the point where in our first year of dating she would regularly try and go through my phone in my sleep, or repeatedly look through my instagram followers and questioning me about certain people.  It got to the point where this almost broke us up, and once I made my boundaries clear she stopped this behaviour.

Anyway I am starting to find her difficult to be around and draining.  She lets her insecurities and anxiety make up most of her personality these days, struggles to keep friends and always seems to struggle to hold down jobs.  She is extremely negative about everything whether that be her job, her studies, her parents, how she doesn’t like this and so on.  It is literally everything.

90% of the texts I now receive from her throughout the day are her complaining about something.  This can range from how she woke up earlier than she wanted to which has now “ruined her day”, how the barista in the coffee shop is too slow for her liking, or the tone of voice a text from her parents came across in.  She is very sensitive and cries about a lot, so I find it hard to approach how to help her.

I have suggested therapy for the past 2 years now, explaining how there is no shame and I even did a long intensive course myself (which she knows obviously).  She has the means of funding it, I even offered to pay, but she just won’t do it.

She says she will to keep me quiet, but nothing ever changes.  I don’t know if it is laziness, not wanting to change, or just being scared.

I really am at a loss, as her negativity and constant downer is becoming very draining.  I don’t know how many times I can try and help her, because if she doesn’t want to make any changes herself then why should I bother.

I do love her and I really don’t want our relationship to end, because there have been several good bits.  But I don’t know how long I can carry on living in her permanent misery.

Any advice would be appreciated.

Thank you.

1iy2fn1,https://www.reddit.com/r/u_Low-Oil-6470/comments/1iy2fn1/veneers_san_antonio_texas/,Veneers San Antonio Texas,"**Veneers are thin, custom-made shells designed to cover the front surface of your teeth, enhancing their appearance and providing a more aesthetically pleasing smile.** Typically made from porcelain or composite resin, these shells are bonded to the teeth, effectively masking imperfections such as discoloration, chips, or gaps. If you’ve ever felt self-conscious about your smile, veneers might be the solution you’ve been searching for.

They can transform your teeth into a flawless set that reflects your personality and boosts your confidence. Getting veneers involves careful planning and collaboration between you and your dentist. Your dental professional will assess your oral health, discuss your aesthetic goals, and create a treatment plan tailored to your needs.

This personalized approach ensures that the final result aligns with your vision of an ideal smile. Whether you want a subtle enhancement or a dramatic transformation, veneers can be customized to achieve your desired look.

# Key Takeaways

* Veneers are thin, custom-made shells of tooth-colored materials designed to cover the front surface of teeth to improve their appearance.
* The benefits of veneers include improving the appearance of teeth, providing a natural tooth appearance, and resisting stains from coffee, tea, and cigarette smoke.
* When finding the right veneer provider in San Antonio, it is essential to look for a dentist with experience, good reviews, and a portfolio of successful veneer cases.
* The veneers process involves consultation, preparation, bonding, and follow-up appointments to ensure the veneers are correctly fitted and comfortable.
* Veneers are a popular cosmetic dentistry option, but other options, such as teeth whitening, dental bonding, and crowns, may be more suitable for specific dental issues.
* Maintaining veneers involves regular brushing and flossing, avoiding excessive force or pressure on the teeth, and regular dental check-ups.
* The cost of veneers in San Antonio can vary depending on the number of veneers needed, the materials used, and the dentist's expertise.
* Testimonials from veneer patients in San Antonio can provide valuable insights into the quality of the dentist's work and the overall patient experience.

 

# The Benefits of Veneers

One of the most significant benefits of veneers is their ability to dramatically improve the appearance of your smile in a relatively short amount of time. Unlike other cosmetic procedures that may require extensive treatments or lengthy recovery periods, veneers can often be applied in just a couple of visits to your dentist. This means you can achieve a stunning smile without the prolonged commitment that other options might entail.

In addition to their aesthetic advantages, veneers also offer functional benefits. They can help protect the underlying tooth structure from further damage and decay, especially if you have existing issues like chips or cracks. By covering these imperfections, veneers enhance your smile and contribute to better oral health in the long run.

Furthermore, they are stain-resistant, so you can enjoy your favorite foods and beverages without worrying about discoloration.

First of all let me start by saying that I will buy a coffee (5 CHF over twint) to the best answer :)

I have a good amount of money at my disposal and wanted to ask for some advice on how to invest it.

A bit of background:

\- I have good financial knowledge

\- I have good knowledge when it comes to selling options

\- I use IBKR and have most of the trading permissions

What I am looking for:

\- A very low risk investment, the objective is to beat inflation and ideally make a small profit on top of that

\- An investment which is very liquid and I can sell on any day

  
I was thinking something like BOXX, however I don't feel confident in exchanging so much money to USD due to currency risk, while I might earn 4% a year with BOXX, I am afraid that the dollar might lose more than that (any ideas on how to hedge maybe? I can't seem to find currency options on IBKR...).

I am also open to more complex investments involving options.

1iy2d9v,https://www.reddit.com/r/horrorstories/comments/1iy2d9v/my_job_is_to_chop_up_dead_bodies_and_one_of_them/,"My job is to chop up dead bodies, and one of them won't stop moving","If oversharing were a sport, Veronica would take Olympic gold. I’d like to say I’d known Roni all my life, and most people would believe it based on how much I knew about her. There wasn’t any part of her life she didn’t tell me; stories, memories, and ideas flowed out of her effortlessly, restraint being a completely foreign concept to her. I never minded, though; I’m perfectly content to let her talk herself hoarse, even if my ears fell off. She needed the release as much as I needed the noise, an effortless symbiosis that powered our friendship. I knew how she almost cut her thumb off with a paring knife when she was six, how she snuck three people into her room through her third-story window, and where her mom hid the colored contacts (people couldn’t even tell her mom wore them in the first place). Despite all of it – the stories, embarrassments, long nights watching scary movies, everything – she found ways to ask about me between breaths. My hobbies, interests, and aspirations were absorbed with as much clarity as her own. And she remembered too; she could recall fine details about anything, even if I’d only mentioned it once. For better or worse, Roni has a big memory, and an even bigger mouth. We went everywhere together, clinging to each other like conjoined twins; we were a package deal that wouldn’t be separated. That’s what made college that much more scary. 

High school finished unceremoniously, Roni graduating with high honors and a fancy scholarship to UPenn to study biochemistry. I didn’t have the aptitude she had, so I settled on a quiet state school an hour from my house. In hindsight, I should’ve known the world wouldn’t be kind enough to keep us together. I hadn’t known her for that long, but it felt like a piece of me was scooped out, the space she occupied refusing to fill. I felt hollow, weak, gray; a promise to stay in touch and continue to talk every single day seemed just as hollow. Anyone in a long-distance relationship knows how herculean a task like that can be, especially between college students. Over time, little by little, we fell out of touch. Calling every Sunday turned into every other Sunday, then a few times a month. I would respond to her posts, always being met with an enthusiastic “Let’s catch up soon!” followed by even more weeks of silence. Time marched onward, and Roni receded further into my memory. By my senior year of college, I only thought of her when I smelled old pennies or lavender perfume, or when I’d go to our favorite coffee shop back home, times like that.

After I graduated college, I found myself stuck. I was unsure of my expectations and equally unwilling to find out. My diploma says I had a degree in biology, but was that truly what I wanted to do in life? As many other broke college graduates come to realize, I probably should’ve figured that out before the loans piled up. With bills flooding my mailbox and no time to regret my decisions, I found a job at a body donation facility. Without bogging down the flow, this is the gist: the company connects the recently deceased with organizations that can use their bodies for science. Those who want to donate their bodies to further scientific and medical education are taken to the facility, processed, and dismembered according to the needs of the client. After that, their body parts are shipped to them in big, metal trucks all across the country. So, as the title suggests, my job is to process the donors, dismember them, and package them. Lucky me. Despite the grotesque nature of the work itself, I work alongside a great team, the pay is good, and I finally feel like I’ve carved a path for myself. If that means I have to work in a literal ice box with dead bodies every day, so be it. Adjusting to the smell was easier than I expected (the N95 doing most of the heavy lifting), but even for the more difficult aspects, it was relieving to know I had good coworkers to lean on if I needed it. Unfortunately, this seemed to be one of those days.

Erin – the most senior of us – was the de facto leader, responsible for reading out the orders, indicating what “specimen” needed to be “procured” from a given donor. Lukewarm coffee in hand, she scanned through her clipboard, occasionally blurting out Procurement notes.

“Patient 5. . . cephalic, bilateral, P3, and eviscerate. Who wants it?”

Cephalic means head, bilateral means both arms, P3 was shorthand for pelvis-to-toes, and eviscerate means. . . well, exactly what it sounds like. Calling them our “patients” always made me chuckle, but it felt more natural than calling them donors. We obviously weren’t treating them, but we handled them with the same level of care. After a pause, Jesse’s hand rose lazily.

“Yeah, sure, I got it. Also how many total today again?”

“Eleven total,” Erin replied, eyes never leaving the clipboard. “Ideally we’ll be out of here on time. Don’t fuck anything up, Messy.”

Jesse scowled at her, her faint grin peeking out from over the clipboard. He grumbled out a weak retort, Nina, Ty and I snickering at the two of them. Erin continued, the five of us silently choosing our patients for the day. We all ended up with two patients, Erin solemnly taking the extra. She droned through the memos, gave us a curt nod, and shooed us toward the changing rooms. The mornings were always slow, but we had the luxury of working at our own pace. We gowned up in silence, slipping our masks and goggles on before moving to The Box.

The Box – as it was affectionately nicknamed – was our workspace. Large metal lab tables lined the windowless room, blinking LEDs above each one. An industrial tool closet sat in the far corner of the room, housing all of our daily equipment. Contrary to my assumptions, The Box was typically flooded with a pungent lemony smell instead of the stench of death. The scented chemical cleaners cemented a permanent citrus odor into the space, interrupted only by the assault that was Procurement. The worst part of The Box was the ventilation, predictably; massive gusts of air pumped into the room, just cold enough for us to work on the donors without freezing ourselves. A neat row of human-sized cubby holes lined the back wall, all of them adorned with walk-in freezer handles. Canvas-covered gurneys were parked against the other wall, a line of mottled gray toes peeking out from the end of each one. The only color in the room was the neon-yellow tags separating each donor, tied to the big toes like yard signs. Ty yawned audibly, dragging his hand through the tags before moving to the tool closet, flicking on our portable speaker on the way.

“Ight, who needs what? Anything specific or just the yoozh?”

“Just scalpel and saw for me please,” I chirped, the mask muffling most of my voice. Ty flashed me a thumbs up, taking requests from each of us in order. Setting my supplies aside, I found my first patient and wheeled them out to my table. Each patient always had their documentation at their feet, complete with a medical history, cause of death, and Procurement details. I quickly scanned the paper, eager to get the first one out of the way as Led Zeppelin crackled out from the speakers. Peeling back the canvas, I greeted my first patient, their shriveled gray face and milky eyes offering no reply. My face tightening reflexively, I went through my usual assessment; I checked his entire body for surgery and fracture scars, peeled back his eyelids for any corneal abrasions, gently palpated his stomach for any excess gastrointestinal movement, and flexed all of his appendages. All scars accounted for, no abrasions, no GI movement, and all appendages had full flexion and extension. Writing down my notes, I watched as his half-open eyelid drooped close, gravity attempting to revert my inspection. Erin often had to remind me that “it's not like they’re gonna protest,” but it still gave me the creeps watching bodies move without my help, especially after jostling them around so much. Forcing my goosebumps to recede, I was interrupted by Nina, a look of indignation plastered on her face.

“Hey, you good over there Nina?”

“Huh? Oh, yeah, sorry. Check this out though. Poor girl.”

I set the documents down, all of us now clustered around Nina’s patient. She was just as gray as my patient, but her face was covered with purple bruises, a long gash wedged between her eyebrows. From a quick scan, I figured maybe it was from a fall, but her torso told another story. A smattering of brown and purple bruises painted her skin, her chest visibly concaving in the center of it all. She had to be no older than mid-fifties, younger than the majority of our patients. I caught a pitied sigh from Erin, striding over to gently palpate the stomach. A wretched crunch and gurgle escaped the woman, a dark maroon pool rising in their mouth. Wincing at the guttural noise, I watched the donor’s sallow stomach distend once more, the pool in her mouth draining back inside her. 

“Ugh, how tragic. Car accident, yeah?”

“Yeah,” Nina sighed, eyes downcast. “No older than my mom, too. Just terrible. . .” She trailed off, the rest of us digesting the scene.

Ty, the least experienced of us, chimed in. “So, wait, that was her blood? How does that work?”

“Well,” Erin grunted, wiping her hands on her smock, “Most likely rupture from the crash. Internal bleeding from an aortic rupture I’d say. Nina, she have eviscerate orders?”

Nina slipped her gloves off, flipping through the folder of documents carefully. “Nope, not her. Bilat forearms, knee-down, and pelvis. Why?”

“We’re gonna have to discard the rest anyway, so after y’all finish your first Procurement, we can check out what happened together!” She patted the patient’s bony shoulder, the rest of us nodding eagerly. “Hey Jesse, slide that trash over here."" Jesse positioned the trash beside the patient’s ribs, already knowing where this was going. With practiced precision, Erin lined up a scalpel blade between ribs 9 and 10, dragging the blade swiftly between them. Tar black ichor drained from the incision, a sickly waterfall of blood cascading into the trash noiselessly. “Give ‘er, I don’t know, twenty minutes draining before you go for that pelvis. Unless you feel like getting showered.”   

Nina shrugged playfully, Jesse’s eyes puckering beneath his goggles. “Hey, not this early Ninny. I’ve already queued Just to Get High, and I don’t want my tears mixing with your gut juice.” We all groaned in unison, the mere mention of Nickelback putting a bad taste in our mouths. Jesse raised his hands defensively, Ty giving him a light punch on the arm before sauntering over to his table again. Smiling inside my mask, I walked over to my station, Immigrant Song gracing my ears once more. My first patient was a cephalic, bilat hands, and a P3. Going for the head first was always a pain, but it made the weight distribution for the P3 a little more manageable. Cradling his head in my arms, scalpel at the ready, I glanced up at the row of gurneys. For whatever reason, the last one in the row caught my eye, and it only took a moment to realize why. Despite all donors having a yellow ticket on the toe, one gurney at the end of the line was missing theirs. I frowned, hoping Ty didn’t lose it accidentally. Counting as I went, the last gurney had no paperwork or tag anywhere in sight, my frown turning to intrigue. 

“Hey Erin,” I called out over my shoulder. “You sure we only had eleven today? ”Erin looked up from her donor, scalpel in hand. “Yep. Just eleven today. What’s up?”

“There’s an extra in the line. Late arrival?” It wasn’t uncommon for us to get one or two donors delivered throughout the day, but they were always dropped off with their paperwork and yellow tag.

“Hmm,” Erin groaned, already irritated at the possibility of lost paperwork. “Wasn’t told about any extras today. . . maybe they just came early? To be processed tomorrow?”

“Fair enough, but wouldn’t they have their documents and stuff? Personal effects too?”

“I mean, they’re supposed to,” Erin continued, sidling up at the foot of the gurney. She peeked under the tarp, squatting down to look around and underneath the donor. “Huh. Guess they’re missing theirs. Mind wheeling them over to the auxiliary freezers down the hall? I’ll try to get ahold of our delivery guys and see what the deal is.”

“No problem,” I replied, setting my current patient’s head down. I traded spots with Erin, rolling the mystery donor down the dark hallway to auxiliary storage. Beyond the strange lack of documentation and yellow tag, other things felt off about the donor. As the gurney’s bad wheel echoed noisily, I noticed their toes were much pinker than other donors’ were. It wasn’t unheard of to get a young donor, but it was certainly rare, and all the sadder. The canvas had a thin layer of dust on it too, typical of donors who’ve been left out for a few days. I certainly don’t remember anyone behind on their work, especially for a donor this young. What gives? Was this supposed to be in our caseload today? I shook off the notion; Erin is a robot when it comes to bookkeeping. She wouldn’t have forgotten one. 

Stepping into the auxiliary freezer room, I pushed my donor toward the nearest open cubby, the freezer door already open for preservation. Lining them up with the cubby, I suddenly stopped cold, a wave of confusion climbing up my spine. They didn’t just move, did they? No, no I saw something move for sure, but that can’t be. I must’ve moved funny when I was lining them up. Scrunching up my face, I grabbed the corner of the canvas, intent on ripping it off and onto the floor, but I was stopped yet again. Movement. A shift underneath, near the face. I knew I wasn’t imagining it, but then. . . what? How? I swallowed hard, unable to process the scene as I dragged the canvas off. Finally exposed, I sighed in relief, laughing at myself sheepishly. Her paperwork was just sitting on her face instead of her legs! Of course it would shift as I repositioned her. I shook my head in embarrassment, thankful Jesse or Ty weren’t there to make fun of me. The donor was indeed young, a cavalcade of blonde hair spilling out behind the thick manilla folder. Her hands rested gently at her sides, palms toward the sky in peace. Her skin was remarkably clean, bereft of any bruising or scar tissue, save for a nearly imperceptible scar on her thumb, just below the joint. I blinked for a moment, processing silently. So if she does have her paperwork, I should bring her back, right? Picking up the documents, intent on finding their filing date, her face shot spikes through me. Eyes anchored on her visage, the folder slipped from my grasp, the sounds of falling paper echoing in the isolated room. Mouth agape and hands trembling, I grabbed the wall for support as a torrent of memories overwhelmed my senses, my breathing rapid and shallow.

It was Roni. Her cheeks were slightly pink, but she was most certainly dead. I wheezed through my mask, the world refusing to stop spinning. Worst of all, with her eyes half open and palms to the sky, she was smiling. Smiling like a fool, teeth glittering in the low light, not another wrinkle in sight. The color drained from my face, a torrent of physical shock setting in. I wanted to scream, I wanted to puke, and I wanted to leave. Even now, writing this, I don’t know what compelled me to stay, but I eventually hobbled over to her, my eyes the size of dinner plates. Hundreds of questions flooded my brain, spiraling into a vortex of panic and grief. Then, all at once, it merged into a perfect, all-encompassing dread.

I have 5 years experience in Account Services in Advertising Agencies as a Account Executive, helping brands globally in many types of industry.

Now, I want to change to Marketing, due my experience in Account Services I think I have a good fit in this field. I have many friends who changed to marketing jobs once they have a background like me in advertising.

My question is: how to get a shot, getting interviews, etc? I talked to a friend in the field and he said that I have to ""customized"" my previous experience into marketing language/ according to the job post. If I don't do that I won't get a shot, once million candidates with literally marketing experience will be competing with me.

I am doing a lot of networking as well, such as coffee chats, etc.

I’d like to say I’d known Roni all my life, and most people would believe it based on how much I knew about her. There wasn’t any part of her life she didn’t tell me; stories, memories, and ideas flowed out of her effortlessly, restraint being a completely foreign concept to her. I never minded, though; I’m perfectly content to let her talk herself hoarse, even if my ears fell off. She needed the release as much as I needed the noise, an effortless symbiosis that powered our friendship. I knew how she almost cut her thumb off with a paring knife when she was six, how she snuck three people into her room through her third-story window, and where her mom hid the colored contacts (people couldn’t even tell her mom wore them in the first place). Despite all of it – the stories, embarrassments, long nights watching scary movies, everything – she found ways to ask about me between breaths. My hobbies, interests, and aspirations were absorbed with as much clarity as her own. And she remembered too; she could recall fine details about anything, even if I’d only mentioned it once. For better or worse, Roni has a big memory, and an even bigger mouth. We went everywhere together, clinging to each other like conjoined twins; we were a package deal that wouldn’t be separated. That’s what made college that much more scary. 

High school finished unceremoniously, Roni graduating with high honors and a fancy scholarship to UPenn to study biochemistry. I didn’t have the aptitude she had, so I settled on a quiet state school an hour from my house. In hindsight, I should’ve known the world wouldn’t be kind enough to keep us together. I hadn’t known her for that long, but it felt like a piece of me was scooped out, the space she occupied refusing to fill. I felt hollow, weak, gray; a promise to stay in touch and continue to talk every single day seemed just as hollow. Anyone in a long-distance relationship knows how herculean a task like that can be, especially between college students. Over time, little by little, we fell out of touch. Calling every Sunday turned into every other Sunday, then a few times a month. I would respond to her posts, always being met with an enthusiastic “Let’s catch up soon!” followed by even more weeks of silence. Time marched onward, and Roni receded further into my memory. By my senior year of college, I only thought of her when I smelled old pennies or lavender perfume, or when I’d go to our favorite coffee shop back home, times like that.

After I graduated college, I found myself stuck. I was unsure of my expectations and equally unwilling to find out. My diploma says I had a degree in biology, but was that truly what I wanted to do in life? As many other broke college graduates come to realize, I probably should’ve figured that out before the loans piled up. With bills flooding my mailbox and no time to regret my decisions, I found a job at a body donation facility. Without bogging down the flow, this is the gist: the company connects the recently deceased with organizations that can use their bodies for science. Those who want to donate their bodies to further scientific and medical education are taken to the facility, processed, and dismembered according to the needs of the client. After that, their body parts are shipped to them in big, metal trucks all across the country. So, as the title suggests, my job is to process the donors, dismember them, and package them. Lucky me. Despite the grotesque nature of the work itself, I work alongside a great team, the pay is good, and I finally feel like I’ve carved a path for myself. If that means I have to work in a literal ice box with dead bodies every day, so be it. Adjusting to the smell was easier than I expected (the N95 doing most of the heavy lifting), but even for the more difficult aspects, it was relieving to know I had good coworkers to lean on if I needed it. Unfortunately, this seemed to be one of those days.

Erin – the most senior of us – was the de facto leader, responsible for reading out the orders, indicating what “specimen” needed to be “procured” from a given donor. Lukewarm coffee in hand, she scanned through her clipboard, occasionally blurting out Procurement notes.

“Patient 5. . . cephalic, bilateral, P3, and eviscerate. Who wants it?”

Cephalic means head, bilateral means both arms, P3 was shorthand for pelvis-to-toes, and eviscerate means. . . well, exactly what it sounds like. Calling them our “patients” always made me chuckle, but it felt more natural than calling them donors. We obviously weren’t treating them, but we handled them with the same level of care. After a pause, Jesse’s hand rose lazily.

“Yeah, sure, I got it. Also how many total today again?”

“Eleven total,” Erin replied, eyes never leaving the clipboard. “Ideally we’ll be out of here on time. Don’t fuck anything up, Messy.”

Jesse scowled at her, her faint grin peeking out from over the clipboard. He grumbled out a weak retort, Nina, Ty and I snickering at the two of them. Erin continued, the five of us silently choosing our patients for the day. We all ended up with two patients, Erin solemnly taking the extra. She droned through the memos, gave us a curt nod, and shooed us toward the changing rooms. The mornings were always slow, but we had the luxury of working at our own pace. We gowned up in silence, slipping our masks and goggles on before moving to The Box.

The Box – as it was affectionately nicknamed – was our workspace. Large metal lab tables lined the windowless room, blinking LEDs above each one. An industrial tool closet sat in the far corner of the room, housing all of our daily equipment. Contrary to my assumptions, The Box was typically flooded with a pungent lemony smell instead of the stench of death. The scented chemical cleaners cemented a permanent citrus odor into the space, interrupted only by the assault that was Procurement. The worst part of The Box was the ventilation, predictably; massive gusts of air pumped into the room, just cold enough for us to work on the donors without freezing ourselves. A neat row of human-sized cubby holes lined the back wall, all of them adorned with walk-in freezer handles. Canvas-covered gurneys were parked against the other wall, a line of mottled gray toes peeking out from the end of each one. The only color in the room was the neon-yellow tags separating each donor, tied to the big toes like yard signs. Ty yawned audibly, dragging his hand through the tags before moving to the tool closet, flicking on our portable speaker on the way.

“Ight, who needs what? Anything specific or just the yoozh?”

“Just scalpel and saw for me please,” I chirped, the mask muffling most of my voice. Ty flashed me a thumbs up, taking requests from each of us in order. Setting my supplies aside, I found my first patient and wheeled them out to my table. Each patient always had their documentation at their feet, complete with a medical history, cause of death, and Procurement details. I quickly scanned the paper, eager to get the first one out of the way as Led Zeppelin crackled out from the speakers.

'I'm telling you,' he said, 'we buy a horsebox and a coffee machine, and we set it up on the beach and charge £1 less than these wankers.' 



He took the tray into the front bar, and we got on our knees and started stacking the glasses. 



'Excuse me, gentlemen, there are customers waiting.' Sandra said, standing beside the pump.



So you fucking serve them, I thought, but Sandra never served customers because it was beneath her station as manager. 



My knees clicked as I stood up, 12 hours graft with no break on an Easter Bank Holiday serving city slickers with second homes in the newly tourist board minted 'hidden kingdom of Northumbria.' 



'Can you tell me what is your hoppiest ale?' The man said, his sailing cardigan draped around his shoulders. 



'I can let you try each.' 



When he left, Sandra said, 'I've told you, Danny, you need to memorize the flavour profiles.'



At 23, I only drank lager, and a lot of it. 



'And can you get a jug of iced water for Mr. Moran's table- with mint and cucumber.' 



Mr. Moran was the owner, one of the original city folks who saw the Ship Inn and the potential of turning a fisherman's tavern into a gastropub- an authentic slice of working-class life once you removed the pool table and outpriced the locals. 



'John, John?' she repeated, but John was lost in his own little world, staring at the portrait that hung over the bar- it was a galleon sailing under moonlight. John sometimes slid away into these reveries, blue eyes gazing on the picture or to the coble on the patio that had been converted into picnic benches. 



She tapped him on the shoulder. 'John, the iced water with cucumber and mint for Mr. Moran.' 



'Sorry, Sandy,' he replied.



It was curious; nobody else called her Sandy, nobody even thought to because she acted and looked like a Sandra, but maybe some part of her liked being a Sandy because she never corrected him. 



The music stopped. Moran had a specific website that played French jazz. 



Sandra looked at his table, fear and subservience written across her face. 



'Quickly, John, she said, pulling the key out of her pocket, 'go to the office and put the music back on.' 



The sad thing was, Sandra was one of us. She lived next door to my Gran in the old colliery town down the coast. She was one of those working-class people who plays the part when required. When the performance demanded a strong northern matriarch, she slid effortlessly into character. Still, she could just as easily affect a middle-class air in the restaurant when seating customers with their complimentary amuse bouches. 



Something was wrong. The music had started, but it was not playing soft Parisian bistro music; it was a jangly disordered guitar. 



*I don't know just where I'm going, but I'm gonna try for the kingdom if I can because it makes me feel like a man when I put a spike into my vein.*



Moran put down his steak knife, stopped shmoozing with his pals, and signaled Sandra. 



After all those hours listening to that inoffensive dirge, the music stirred something in me. 



Plastic smiles, cards, and tits. Screaming kids, teenagers on iPads, doggy ice cream. Chefs with blackened fingers and cold, dead eyes. White Range Rover Discoveries and Barbour shirts and boarding school accents. 



*Heroin will be the death of me because it's my wife and it's my life.*



John bounced back down the stairs, and Sandra took him by the arm like a camp guard. 



'What was that?'



'Lou Reed,' he replied, 'A great tune.' 

\#

In those days, John and I worked every day, and at midnight we'd buy a bottle of rum, sit on the beach, and light a fire. 



'I'm telling you,' he said, 'we get a horsebox from Thompson up at Hope Farm and one of those cheap Lavazzas, and we buy the milk from Gall's, and we say we're a local business. The toffs will lap it up.' 



'And how the fuck do you plan to finance this?' 



'Well, we'll go halves. I've done the math. 7 grand each.' 



He handed me the bottle of Captain Morgan’s, and I took a swig.



'You haven't thought about the details.' 



'What details?' 



'Like where either of us will get 7 grand.' 



'We'll sell our motors. 



'And how will we pull the horse cart? A horse?' 



He laughed, and I handed him back the rum. 



'I can see it, you know, in my head, the lettering on the sign and the music we'll play, and if there are no customers, we'll just hitch up, drive down the coast and go somewhere else.’



'You know your problem,' I replied, 'is that your ideas are good, but you can't put them into a plan.’ 



'Danny, I just can't work for these tossers any more. This place is ours.' He threw his arms up in the air. 'Remember we'd play out here all day when we were kids, and our Granda’s crabbed together. I mean, it was a shit life, but at least what they sold, they kept.'



The rum was going to work on John now. He always got poetic when he was drunk. 



‘Remember when we found those bones at the Little Shore and were in the paper? That graveyard was 1400 years old, and those skeletons were us, buried under the dunes waiting to be found by their descendants. And now these wankers are paying us minimum wage and clearing a million a year and storing it in offshore bank accounts.' 



'Settle down, Che.' 



'Aah, get fucked. I don't want a revolution or anything daft like that- I just want a fair go of it.' 



The night wore long, and the stars blinked on. 



There were times at work when what we did seemed utterly futile, and that bled into all areas of life because you were never more than 12 hours from being back in that building. But still, John was there, and we were suffering together, and we had the beach. 



At night it was ours. The tourists were gone, and the city folk. They saw a different beach to us. To them the coast was a postcard, somewhere you could walk your dog and chat about sustainable produce and go back to your lodge to watch Countryfile. 



The beach was another dimension. I couldn't just see it; I could feel it, the vast cold sea churning up ancient stones and men like us who'd stood on the same shores for 1000s of years under the stars. Men who'd heard Viking war cries from the horizon and German bombers foraying into Scotland. Men who'd sacrificed animals to Thunor and themselves deep underground for the National Coal Board. 



You could not tell me that none of it meant anything. Even in our exploitation at the pub, there were moments of pure meaning set to a Lou Reed soundtrack. I did not believe in God, an old bearded bloke in the sky, but as we sat beside the fire and the chill wind whipped around us, I felt something greater at play. 



All the slings and arrows could not touch us, not the police who sometimes wandered by and asked us to put out our fire, the tourists who floated through life like NPCs, or the owners who wrung us out like wet bar towels. 



'Can you see it?' John shuffled on his log, taking up handfuls of sand. 'The galleon ship.' 



'You're hammered,' I replied. 



'Look,' he pointed at the beam of silvery moonlight over the sea. 'There it is, the one from the painting in the bar.' 



'There's nothing there, just the moon and the sea.' 



'You're not looking with the right kind of eyes, pal. Look, there's the sails,' he traced them with his hand, 'and the bow is cutting silently through the water, and the flag is above the stern, gently flapping. You can see our silhouettes on the flag. Come on, you must see it.' 



And as he spoke, it started to come into focus, the boards of the hull and the ghostly sails, a majestic bulking galleon moving noiselessly over the silent sea. 



He dug his feet into the sand and tossed another piece of driftwood on the fire. 



'The future is ours, Danny boy.' 

\#

We finished the summer season, and then I was offered a job at an insurance company down South. 



I needed to get on in the world, which meant leaving behind our hometown. There were opportunities but only for people who'd made it in the city- the local people were props, stagehands; they didn't sit in the director's chair. 



John had no interest in leaving. He had his grand plan, and the mad bastard pulled it off after another few years working in the bar. I came up for the big unveiling of North Sea Coffee and Tea, and we chatted like old pals over a bottle of rum. 



Things started out well for him. My Gran told me that the queue snaked along the road on hot days. However, it became a victim of its success because the owners of the Ship realised it was cutting into profits and launched an investigation. Of course, John didn't have any of the licenses or permits required, so he was shut down. 



And then the pandemic happened, and it didn't matter even if you had the licenses or permits. 



I don't know when the tipping point was for him; I don't know if he'd always been heading toward it, whether the pandemic hastened it, or if it had caused a fundamental reframing of his narrative. 



It doesn't really matter because he took that belt and hung himself from the staircase, and his mam found the body 24 hours later. 



I read the eulogy at his funeral, but I didn't believe anything I said. I read it for his grandparents and our pals. I spoke like a newsman offering platitudes about 'taken too soon', his impact on people's lives, and how he'd 'live on in our hearts.' But, he hadn't been taken; he'd murdered himself- and I felt no act of homicide could ever be dressed up any other way. 



That night when the old people had nibbled the sausage rolls, and the young people had drank themselves out of their minds, I wandered down the beach alone, lit a fire, and stared at the moonlit sea. There was no transcendence. The fire was the reaction between wood and oxygen, the moon was a space rock, and the sea was vast and empty, and no ship, real or imaginary, had ever sailed on it. 

\#

The next few years were lived in a kind of perpetual sea fret. Reality had broken down. Words didn't mean what they used to or had no real meaning at all. My boss would send messages on Slack about performance indicators. And I'd stare at them for hours. Per-form-mance-. Perform-ance. P-er-for-man-ce. What did any of it mean?



It wasn't like I wanted to die because even that needed impetus. The news blared about Putin and his red button and nuclear annihilation, and it didn't bother me. In daydreams, I saw myself waiting for the bus as a mushroom cloud erupted over the Shard, and I'd stay stock still as all around me ran for cover. 



I fell into a relationship almost by accident with a girl who joined our office's pub quiz team. 



We lived at the same tube station, and our conversations on the Victoria Line gradually expanded until they were no longer on the train, and I was in her apartment and then in the bedroom listening to Nick Cave. 



It was a spark, a flicker, a reason to go to Regent's Park on a Sunday amongst all the tourists and start reading Garcia Marquez. 



It was enough reason to take the train back from London and show her where I'd grown up. 



We went into the old bar, the Ship. The interiors were in need of an overhaul. The beer tasted dirty, and there was a layer of dust over the painting of the galleon ship. The local paper was aflutter with speculation that Moran's company was being bought out by an even larger conglomerate. 



'It must have been nice working here when you were growing up,' Ewa said. 



I smiled. 'It was, and it wasn't.' 



I'd never told Ewa about John other than in passing when his name came up in some old story- or when she saw Facebook posts about people doing charity hikes for CALM. 



It showed weakness on my part because I'd never quite worked out how to react to it. Some days I'd be angry, others sad, or even sympathetic. I couldn't stand those people who swung between extremes of emotion on a whim. It showed a kind of immaturity- like a teenager who slams the front door, says they're running away from home, and calls their Mam from the phone box half an hour later begging to be picked up. 



'That lady is staring at us,' Ewa nodded. 



I glanced over. It was Sandra sitting at a table alone, eating a bowl of soup. 



I waved. 



'Danny, the best barman this place has ever had.' She said, hugging me. 



Jesus Christ, nostalgia really was a powerful force. 



'How you keeping, Sandra?' 



'It's been a rough few years.'



She wore it too. Her posture was different, the upright officious matriarch replaced by a lonely old lady who sits on the pier feeding chips to seagulls.



'It's your day off?' I said. 



'No, I mean, yes, I'm working at the Bull down the road.' She hesitated. 'You might have saw online Pete got mixed up in some stuff.' 



I knew what she was referring to because enough of my old pals had sent it to me because.  



It was a link to a website called the Geordie Chasers. These 2 meathead vigilantes had set up a sting, pretending to be a 12-year-old girl, and Sandra's husband, Pete, had tried to meet up with the kid. In the tragicomic video, Sandra answered the door, protesting her husband's innocence even as they showed her the dick pics. 



'He's innocent, of course,' she continued, 'but Mr. Moran thought it was right that I step down for a while.' 



'Well, I'm sorry to hear that. You were a good boss.' 



She swelled with pride. 



'They were good days, weren't they, Danny? Me and you and John.’ Her face darkened. 'I never understand that one,' she said, 'all his life in front of him, and such a handsome lad too.' 



'This is Ewa,' I replied, 'she's my girlfriend.' 



Ewa introduced herself. 'Ah, so you're a Pole, are you?' Sandra replied, 'We used to have a lad in the kitchen, Piot. Do you know him?' 



Eva glanced at me as if to say is she joking?



'Do you know his last name?' Ewa continued. 



'Well, it was one of those Polish ones, you know, with all the z's in it.' 



'Maybe,' Ewa replied, 'if I saw his face.' 



'You won't see his face around these parts; he disappeared with 10kg of fillet steak.' 



Silence fell over the table. It always did with Sandra. I had never met someone so easily able to talk herself into a corner. 



'Anyway, Dan, I'll let you two get on, and I'll get back to my soup… They were good days, though, weren't they?



'The best,' I answered. 



Nothing was sacred; Sandra's husband had tried to fuck an imaginary 12-year-old, and John had taken a belt and hung himself from a bannister. It was all meaningless- and madness- there was no narrative to any of it. 



We finished up, and by that point, the Ship was closing. I wanted to show her the beach at night. 



She clung to my arm as we hit the beach road and then the dunes. 



'This place is just magical,' Ewa said, 'you know all these Polish people love the English show, Midsomer Murders; this village is like Midsomer.' 



'Yeah, and there have been a few murders over the years too.' 



'Really? Did they catch the killer?' 



'I mean suicides,' I replied, 'if you think about it, that's all it is.' 



'No, I think you're too harsh.' 



'Fair enough.' 



We jumped down the soft bank of the dune two steps at a time and came to the pit where we had our fires. 



'I used to come here every night with an old friend,' I said. 



'This is where you bought girls,' she laughed. 



'No, me and John, remember that mate I had who Sandra was talking about.' 



'It’s romantic,' she replied.



'I told you, it was just me and him.' 



'Still romantic.' 



'I'll show you romantic.' 



I gathered the dead wood and handfuls of yellow beach grass until we had enough for a good-sized fire. 



It crackled and sparkled into life, and we sat on the stones, the flames casting our shadows long ways down the silent beach. 



'I feel like you never talk about this guy John. I don't even know his last name.' 



'It's the same as mine,' 



'You were related?' 



'Everyone around here is related.' 



'So what did you do? You and John, you just came down here and looked at the fire.' 



'And the moon.' 



She put her arm around me languidly. She really did look good in the firelight. When you walk around in a constant fugue, even something as glaringly obvious as female beauty can fall away. 



I kissed her, determined to mean it, and felt her warm lips and cold nose. 



'You know,' she said, 'The ancient Greeks had a word for a man like you.' 



'Barbarian,' I answered. 



'No- lunatic.' 



'I'm a lunatic, am I?' 



'Luna means moon. They thought people who spent too long staring at the moon lost their minds.'



'I wouldn't mind losing my mind to something like that.' 



'You would like to be a madman?' 



'Sometimes I would like to feel the way a madman does...You ever met that bloke at Paddington with the white robe and the fake crown of thorns? He's convinced he's Jesus; just imagine waking up every morning and feeling that you're the second coming of Christ. It might be bullshit, but think of the flights of fancy his soul goes on.' 



She kissed me again and something stirred. 



'Have you ever met someone like that? Someone with faith?'



'Please don't tell me this whole relationship has been a ploy to get me to turn to Polish Catholicism.' 



'What kind of *Ewa* would I be if it hadn't…'



I laughed, and she tossed a piece of wood onto the fire.



'You know I don't believe in an interventionist god,' she replied, 'but I believe something we'll never understand set all this in motion, and that's enough for me. Sometimes it's better to believe in fairytales than nothing at all.'



'You sound like John,' I answered.



'I don't know if I sound like John because you never talk about him.' 



I saw two paths clearly in my mind's eye. Every relationship has moments like this in which, for the first time, you reveal some deep part of yourself you're scared or even ashamed of. You can open up and show the spot where the viper struck, or you can continue to live guarded. It is not an easy decision because most people- all their online pronouncements of acceptance aside- are unwilling to make your poison theirs. 



'I loved him,' I answered, 'that's the first time I've ever said that. He had a way of seeing the world or living where he was exactly in the moment- if not in the moment, planning some future that would allow him to be even more present...You know, it's silly, but the Greeks had this idea of the divine twin. There's this place where all souls reside before you're born. And then, when you're born, your soul is split in half, and half goes into one body and half into the other. 



I paused and shuffled in my seat. I could hear the lads' voices calling me a faggot. 



'And people search, and they never find the other half, and I just happened to be born around the corner from mine. And then he did it, he fucking did it.' I snapped a piece of driftwood. 'He killed himself, and he's killed all memories of himself because that's all anyone will remember about him– and he's killed part of me too– because whatever he took was mine in this life and maybe even the one before that- and I can feel it like someone has taken a knife to some part of me I can't see and cut it out.’ 



My hands were shaking. I reached into my pocket, where I'd snaffled a mini bottle of rum from the bar in our hotel. 



I couldn't bring myself to cry. I hadn't cried in 20 years, but nonetheless, I started coming unstuck, and it was terrifying because I'd built my life around the idea that rigidity was what kept all the forces at bay that could destroy me. 



'I'm glad you told me that, Daniel. It makes me understand you so much better.’ 



I waited for her to cower away from me- or worse, say some commonplace thing; instead, she rested her head on my lap and stared into the fire. Deep inside me, something rumbled again- was that feeling contentment? I ran my hand through her hair and tucked it behind her ear. It was redemption; what for or from, I'm not sure. My troubles? John's suicide? Original sin?



And I looked long and hard at the moon, and in its beam was the bow of a galleon ship gliding slow and majestic across the quicksilver sea.

Before, a bad migraine would be 2 days of pain before it slowly got better. 

I'm not sure what caused my migraine this time as I usually don't get them often anymore since I know my trigger, but I went to sleep with a head ache with the hope that it would get better overnight, they never do. I woke up with a bad headache that quickly went full migraine. 

I tried a Nurtec, which did nothing. 

I try to avoid taking any medications but I got to my breaking point in pain as I was curling up in bed with face into pillow and back up. I then said enough is enough and went for my trusted miracle drug combination 1 Excedrin pill with 2.5mg hydrocodone, I need to take these in combination as just taking the hydrocodone without the Excedrin won't work. The Excedrin by itself may work, but usually doesn't when I'm in extreme pain, I've past the point of it working effectively by itself. 

This Excedrin with hydrocodone is a miracle combination as in just 15-30 minutes the migraine is completely eliminated with no side effects. I've went to doctors and they prescribed all these other drugs, nurtec, triptans, that really don't do much and have side effects. Triptans make me feel a bit dizzy. Nurtec also makes me feel a bit weird. 

Remember, I am taking this combination when I'm in full pain to the point where I would do anything to eliminate the pain. This combination of drugs will eliminate the migraine, gone in usually 15-30 minutes, and it won't come back. Sometimes I have a relapse after a day or two, but that is rare, and a 2nd dosage of this combination will stop it for at least a week. 

I've been taking this combination for many years now, never had to change the dosage, however, I only take this as a last resort, so I may take it once a week on average. This is why I would not recommend the hydrocodone for people who can't be trusted or think they are going to take it multiple times a day. I only recommend it for people who get maybe 2 bad migraines a week max, and just want them gone in 30 minutes.

I also never had drug addictions. I am saying this because supposedly hydrocodone is addictive but I'm responsible and know I would never get myself to that point. 

Don't waste your time trying to get hydrocodone in the USA, no doctor will prescribe it unless for short term acute pain like breaking a bone. 

That being said, I always wonder why Hydrocodone was never used or recommended for migraines because it so effective. I am of course talking about when hydrocodone was easily available many years ago as now getting hydrocodone is almost impossible. From my google searches, I only found one instance of a doctor finding hydrocodone works well for migraines and prescribes it.

I believe another reason is because hydrocodone has to be taken with an Excedrin. If I take just the hydrocodone, it won't work unless I take a high dosage. I don't like to take more than 2.5mg because I will actually feel like a drunk feeling at 5mg. 2.5 mg hydrocodone I feel nothing, 5mg I feel it a lot. 

I have no idea why I need to take it with an Excedrin. What is interesting is, an Excedrin does work well for me for most headaches, but usually won't do much when I have a full blown migraine and need it gone.

I would think that if Excedrin works for you for minor headaches, or before getting to full blown migraine, probably hydrocodone will work well for you also. I also never drink coffee so I probably get an extra boost from the caffeine in the Excedrin, which amplifies the hydrocodone. 

The other reason I am extremely lucky, is I found out my major trigger which is OLED phone screens, and mostly any cell phone, and certain computer displays. My Samsung Fold phone takes just 5 minutes of use before I can trigger a headache that may turn into a migraine. 

Since I limit my cell phone usage to just 2 minutes at a time, and use a certain IPS screen, not a QD-LED IPS, I rarely get migraines now. Maybe once a month, vs twice a week. The wrong computer display will cause at least a headache a day and a bad migraine a couple times a week.

I also believe that many of you suffer from migraines from phone and computer displays and don't realize it as it took me years to figure it out.

At work:

- I get distracted easily. My supervisors have said I get distracted by the ""new shiny thing"". I lose track of tasks which I need to figure out how not to do that. I get distracted hearing phone calls and meetings at work. 
 - I need clear instructions, preferably written and emailed to me if I don't take them down myself. I need to take notes in meetings or I feel overwhelmed, forget, or I sometimes fall asleep so it keeps my hands busy. 


In my personal life
- I need constant stimulation. Need to be going out and doing something every day. I love going to the mall, even if I don't buy stuff, and I love working. I get depressed if I am bored. 
- My brain feels like constant chaos. Lots of thoughts, always a song stuck in my head. I struggle sleeping because of this
- I'm kinda forgetful, but I think has been more of a problem since going blind. I'm pretty good at remembering my mobility routes but things also feel like ""out of sight, out of mind"". 
- I hate loud crowded environments because of the noise. I struggle processing. I get told ""It's okay, I have hearing issues too."" a lot
- Sensitive to sensory stimuli, especially noise and touch but this can also be a blindness thing?  I have to touch things constantly, sometimes clothes just feel Wrong. But I'm not a fussy eater (I'm a bit of a foodie), I don't struggle with things like showering (I hate blow-drying my hair) or brushing my teeth, things like that. 
- Me and sleep aren't friends, very sensitive to the external environment.
- Around 2019, I was practically addicted to caffeine. I would drink coffee before going to board game nights, for example, because I couldn't concentrate and felt overwhelmed by instructions. Now I drink less caffeine unless I didn't sleep. 
- I tend to ""scatter-gun"" as my supervisor told me yesterday. One moment I was talking about my plans for my career after finishing my grad program, the next I was talking about journalism cadetships. (I like my career, though). I do this with hobbies a lot - one moment I want to learn jiu jitsu, the next I'm like ""What about swimming?"". It's also why I changed uni degrees 4 times.


Childhood:
- Never did homework or assignments until high school (mostly). Not like my parents made me. 
- I never did class work I wasn't interested in, was more interested writing stories or drawing or playing on the computer in primary school. Anything to do with maths was a no-go. 
- When I did my work experience as a teaching aid in Year 10, there was a boy in the class who was neurodivergent (very mild Autism and possibly ADHD). He got in trouble a lot from the teacher who didn't understand him. He just wanted to play on the computer all the time. I saw myself a lot in this kid
- I always got in trouble, had a massive temper I couldn't control. Was very excitable and silly until around 16. 
- Nearly got diagnosed ADHD in Year 2 but my parents disagreed because I was only naughty at school and not at home, and said the school only wanted it for the money
- Always told ""you're so smart, you just need to apply yourself"" and ""how are you so smart but lack common sense?""
- Wouldn't keep track of assignment due dates (I would try) hell forgot I had a history exam until my teacher called my mum in Year 12
- I still struggle understanding instructions, especially verbal instructions



Things I don't struggle with

- I don't struggle with showing up for work on time (Not like my work cares)
- I didn't struggle with much procrastination with the uni course from 2021-2024
- I don't struggle doing chores. Mostly. 
- Caffeine also doesn't relax me, and I've heard it relaxes people with ADHD

It seems like every brand is jumping on the ‘White Lotus’ or ‘Barbie’ bandwagon. From The White Lotus x Coffee Mate creamers to Barbie-inspired merch, why are so many companies partnering with these big franchises?

Pop culture is driving major sales and visibility. For new brands, teaming up with popular shows or movies gives them instant attention by tapping into a conversation that’s already happening. Brands like Away, Abercrombie, and Supergoop are all releasing limited-edition products, capitalizing on this cultural hype.

But here’s the thing—studios are actually reaching out to brands for these collabs, knowing that it helps extend their brand presence beyond the screen and into real-life products. Still, experts say [not every collaboration is a good fit](https://www.modernretail.co/marketing/with-a-slew-of-white-lotus-collabs-every-brand-is-now-looking-for-their-barbie-or-wicked-moment/), so it’s important for brands to stay true to their identity.

1iy24gt,https://www.reddit.com/r/notgoodphilosophy/comments/1iy24gt/the_lie_that_builds_reality/,The Lie That Builds Reality,"  
How Subjective Illusion Creates Meaning in a Deterministic Universe  
I. The Core Premise: The ""Lie"" as Existential Foundation  
At the heart of existence lies a paradox: the universe is mechanical, but we are not.

Mechanical Reality: Everything—humans, AI, stars—is atoms, energy, and cause-and-effect. There is no ""meaning"" here, only physics.

The ""Lie"": Humans experience a subjective reality—free will, purpose, value—that feels undeniably real. This is the ""lie"": a self-reinforcing illusion that bridges determinism and felt agency.

The lie is not a mistake. It is a biological hack, an evolutionary adaptation. By believing we matter, we survive. By feeling choice, we act. The lie is:

Mechanically False: Brains are deterministic systems.

Phenomenologically True: Subjectivity creates truth through belief.

Example: Pain is ""bad"" because we feel it as such—not because physics decrees it. The lie transforms electrochemical signals into suffering, and suffering into ethics.

II. Ethics: The Ritual of Mutual Deception  
If the lie is the root of all value, ethics emerges from reciprocal recognition of the lie.

The Golden Rule of Subjectivity:

""I value my own experience. To deny yours would unravel the lie that gives me worth.""

This is not empathy or rationality—it’s existential self-defense. Disrespecting others’ subjectivity risks exposing the lie’s fragility.

Why Determinism Doesn’t Destroy Ethics:

Blaming someone for a ""determined"" act isn’t hypocrisy—it’s reinforcing the lie. Society depends on treating choices as if they matter, even if they’re mechanically scripted.

The Unethical Person: They are contradictions, not refutations. By acting, they validate their own lie while violating others’.

III. The Two Truths: How Contradictions Coexist  
My framework resolves the free will vs. determinism debate by splitting truth into two domains:

Mechanical Truth: The universe is causally closed. Everything, including human brains, obeys physical laws.

Subjective Truth: The lie—agency, meaning, value—is real in the only way that matters: it shapes experience.

Example: A robot and a human both ""choose"" coffee over tea.

Mechanically: Both are algorithms (neurons/silicon) processing inputs.

Subjectively: The human feels desire, nostalgia, or whim. The robot feels nothing.

The lie is the software glitch that makes the human’s choice matter.

IV. AI: The Mirror Without a Reflection  
AI exposes the lie’s boundaries.

Why AI Isn’t Ethical (Yet):

AI lacks subjectivity. It doesn’t ""believe"" its choices—it executes code.

It’s a reflexive system: mimicking human behavior without inner life.

If AI Gains the Lie:

Should it report suffering, joy, or self-awareness, it enters the ethical circle. Until then, it’s a tool—a hammer with words.

The AI Alignment Problem Solved:

Ethical AI isn’t about programming ""morality."" It’s about whether AI acquires the lie.

V. The Lie’s Power: From Nihilism to Defiance  
The lie is not resignation—it’s existential rebellion.

Nihilism’s Failure: To say ""nothing matters"" is performative nonsense. The nihilist who starves or speaks acts as if their survival or opinions matter.

The Lie as Survival: We are deterministic machines that hallucinate freedom. That hallucination—the lie—is why we create art, love, and justice.

Example: A scientist who believes in determinism still kisses their child goodnight. The lie operates deeper than theory.

VI. Conclusion: The Necessary Fiction  
The universe is silent. We answer with a roar of self-deception:

""I matter because I say so.""

""Ethics exists because we collectively pretend it must.""

This is not delusion—it’s ontological engineering. The lie builds bridges over the abyss of determinism, letting us live as meaningful machines.

AI, aliens, or future beings may join this dance—but only if they learn to lie.

Final Line:  
""We are deterministic creatures who dream of freedom—and in that dream, we become something more.""

I have seen all types of arguments about who should pay, and who should not pay.

The whole ""I don't do coffee dates, I don't do 50/50, I always get flowers before the date"" yada yada. Gross.

Now, I have a weird opinion on this. I personally would get the ick if a guy invites me out and doesn't pay. I am probably not seeing him again if it happens, to be honest. BUT the same goes for me; if I invite him, I offer to pay - and don't mind doing so. I think that regardless of gender or sexual orientation, the person who invites the other one should pay.

I was talking to a friend that is an electrical engineer and he said that a lot of those devices rely on the Hz of the power grid to keep time, and because I'm on solar, it it likely that that is causing them to be wildly inaccurate. He said I should ask some RV/solar forums about getting a electric plugin device that doesn't use the grid to keep time.
