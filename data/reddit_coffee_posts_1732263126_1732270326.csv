1gx4hqz,https://www.reddit.com/r/offmychest/comments/1gx4hqz/alternative/,Alternative ,"I was asked to leave my high school. Halfway through my tenth-grade year, my parents and I were summoned to the principal‚Äôs office (not the first time), and I was asked to leave. The alternative was expulsion for truancy which‚Äîlet‚Äôs be honest‚Äîwas an understatement, I hadn‚Äôt seen the inside of a classroom in well over two weeks.

But lucky me, they had an alternative: a program for delinquents. The Elysium High School Alternative Program for Delinquents! (Okay, I made that last part up. But it‚Äôs true.) At this point, my parents were in for a few more surprises. I was the first 10th grader ever allowed into The Program AND the first not-pregnant girl ever allowed in. So, basically, I was a prodigy. Very impressive, I know.

Right now, you‚Äôre probably thinking you‚Äôre about to read a story about one of those kinds of programs. It‚Äôs not like that‚Äîat least, not for me. EHAP was its own weird world: Lord of the Flies meets Teen Mom, Dazed & Confused meets Boy Meets World. 

Every morning began the same: peer counseling in homeroom. The teachers took this very seriously, and we enjoyed the easy ritual of chatting about our lives while sipping coffee (every classroom had a coffee maker). We observed AA rules in peer counseling, so we weren‚Äôt supposed to talk about anything we heard inside those walls. But, well, it was high school, so the only time anyone shared anything juicy was if it was already well-known gossip.

There were only five rooms at EHAP. The front office, manned by a woman who was far too kind and gentle to handle the hellions filing past her desk all day. She was also our school nurse and, occasionally, our babysitter. I can‚Äôt remember her name. Adjacent to the office was The Baby Room, which was basically a shoddy nursery (think the room in Stranger Things where young Eleven is attacking the Mind Flayer‚Äîminus the rainbow) with a few cribs and toys scattered about. It had cots for the students to take naps on, which was pretty incredible considering we only went to school from 8:30 a.m. to 1:00 p.m. The moms could retreat to the Baby Room whenever they needed to, or they could enlist a willing babysitter if they had schoolwork to focus on. Every couple at EHAP claimed to have had sex in that room. 

Because we only had three classrooms, we only had three teachers‚Äî so, four staff members to manage around 40 teenage dirtbags and their babies. Maybe they let us get stoned at lunch because it kept us quiet.

Traditional education wasn‚Äôt the top priority. So, we came up with some very creative ways to earn school credits. Our campus was too small for a gym so we completed our P.E. credits at home. We could earn one credit for every 10 hours of sex or video games, as long as we had someone over the age of 18 sign a paper saying we did it. Yup. I passed two years of science by literally transcribing two seasons of Bill Nye the Science Guy. None of the teachers spoke Spanish, so our only language option was French‚Äîwhich, in Southern California, was pretty hilarious. I stopped taking math in 10th grade, and no one noticed until my senior year. I somehow convinced my favorite teacher, Mrs. Yellin, to just give me the credits so I could graduate as planned.

Mrs. Yellin was the heart of EHAP. The program would not have been the same without her. She motivated us all and wouldn‚Äôt let anyone slip through the cracks. She wasn‚Äôt perfect, she yelled and she got emotional. But she loved us like her own children, and she wanted us to succeed. Yes, she let me slide in math, but it didn‚Äôt interest me and I wasn‚Äôt great at it. So she pushed me in writing and extra-curricular activities. She gave me goals to work towards and made me care about high school. I genuinely felt bad when I would disappoint her.  When Mrs. Yellin passed a few years ago it was felt throughout the community. She taught for many years at several schools and I often read the comments students have left for her on social media. That woman was an icon.

Mrs. Yellin was also a smoker! And that meant we  could always talk to her into talking us on a Nature Walk. A Nature Walk had nothing to do with nature or walking. We‚Äôd go out to the public park adjacent to our campus and sit on the bleachers and have class while smoking. That‚Äôs when I started smoking Cool 120s‚Äîbecause they were so long, we got to stay outside longer. If you were having a particularly rough day, you could ask to go on a private Nature Walk, and the teachers were cool with it, as long as you didn‚Äôt take advantage.

There were a few rules: never take advantage, don‚Äôt lie to the teachers, treat your peers with respect. (I can still hear Mrs. Yellin‚Äôs voice.) Basically, act like adults. Drunk, stoned, underage, uneducated adults. And, oddly enough, it worked 95%of the time.

Lunch was always chaotic. We didn‚Äôt have a cafeteria, nobody packed a lunch, and only a few kids had cars, so everyone was always scrambling to hitch a ride. Our classes weren‚Äôt divided by grade, and there weren‚Äôt many cliques‚Äîafter all, there were only 40 of us. So, it wasn‚Äôt unusual to see a chola sharing lunch with a goth boy in a skirt and a metalhead in a trench coat.

Because the school was so small, the district had no choice but to let us delinquents loose on the town every day for lunch from 10:30 to 11:00. You could get surprisingly sloshed in 30 minutes. The teachers would line up at the gate after lunch to do breath and eye checks. Either Watermelon Hubba Bubba is a miracle worker at covering up the smell of booze or‚Äîmore likely‚Äîour teachers were just glad to have us back in class and weren‚Äôt too concerned about the details of sobriety. The teachers hated it when a student didn‚Äôt come back from lunch. They would have to go track them down in their personal vehicles to keep the kid out of trouble. We hated that back then, looking back I can see what an incredible kindness that was. 

When I began EHAP, I had zero high school credits. I was failing out. But I graduated a semester early with transcripts good enough to get into UCLA. During my time there I joined student council, I won awards for Junior Achievement, and started attending college three days a week in my senior year of high school. And it wasn‚Äôt just me‚Äîso many students from The Program, who would have otherwise dropped out or fallen through the cracks, were given this unique opportunity during the brief time EHAP existed. 

Elysium High School Alternative Program was just that: an alternative, and that‚Äôs exactly what we need in our education system. I was so privileged to have this experience, and I will be forever grateful for it.

I recently started using the **Muama Ryoko portable WiFi**, and after a few months of testing it, I wanted to share my experience. If you‚Äôre considering getting one or just curious about how it works, this post might help. I‚Äôll go over the pros, cons, and everything in between‚Äîno fluff, just facts.

# Why I Decided to Try Muama Ryoko WiFi

Let me paint a picture: you‚Äôre traveling, and your phone‚Äôs data plan is on the brink of exhaustion. Public WiFi? Forget it‚Äîslow speeds, security risks, and constant disconnects. That‚Äôs been my story during almost every trip.

When I first heard about **Ryoko portable WiFi**, I thought, ‚ÄúThis sounds too good to be true.‚Äù A small device that works in **76 countries** with secure, fast, and reliable internet? But after reading **Muama Ryoko reviews**, I decided to give it a try. Here‚Äôs what I found.

# First Impressions: Easy to Set Up

Straight out of the box, the device feels compact and lightweight‚Äîperfect for travel. The **setup process** took less than five minutes:

1. Power it on.
2. Scan the QR code to connect your phone or laptop.
3. Done! You‚Äôve got WiFi.

Even for someone who isn‚Äôt tech-savvy, the instructions are simple and easy to follow. **Ryoko portable WiFi** is ready to use right out of the box, with no complicated configurations.

# How Does Ryoko Perform?

Now to the real question: **Does it actually work?** Short answer: Yes, but with some caveats.

# Speed and Stability

* In cities, the connection speed was impressive‚Äîup to **150Mbps**, as advertised. Streaming HD videos, video calls, and online gaming were smooth.
* In rural areas or during long drives, the speeds were slower, but I could still browse and check emails without any issues.

# Battery Life

This is one of the biggest perks for me. **Ryoko WiFi lasts up to 15 hours**, which is way better than using my phone‚Äôs hotspot (which drains the battery in less than half that time).

# Device Connectivity

You can connect up to **8 devices** at once, which makes it perfect for families or small groups. During a weekend trip, I connected my laptop, phone, and tablet while my friends used it for their phones. No one complained about lag.

# What Makes Ryoko WiFi Special?

There are a few features that really stand out to me:

1. **Global Coverage**: Ryoko works in **76 countries** across North America, Europe, Asia, and beyond. During a recent trip to Japan and Italy, it automatically connected to the strongest local network.
2. **Secure Connection**: Public WiFi is notoriously unsafe, but **Ryoko WiFi** creates a private, encrypted network. No more worrying about hackers or phishing scams while browsing at the airport or hotel.
3. **Ad Blocker**: This was a pleasant surprise! The built-in ad blocker not only sped up my browsing but also reduced pop-ups and ads while I streamed.
4. **Compact Design**: It‚Äôs small enough to fit in your pocket but powerful enough to keep you connected all day.

# A Few Downsides

While I love most things about **Muama Ryoko portable WiFi**, it‚Äôs not without its flaws:

1. **Limited Initial Data**: The included SIM card only comes with **500MB** of data. This is enough to test the device but not for extended use. You‚Äôll need to top up quickly, which might feel like an extra step for some.
2. **No Built-In Display**: Unlike some competitors, Ryoko doesn‚Äôt have a screen to show data usage or signal strength. You‚Äôll need to use an app for this, which might be inconvenient for some.
3. **Device Color**: The only available color is white, which looks clean but might not appeal to everyone. A black option would‚Äôve been nice.

# How Does It Compare to a Phone‚Äôs Hotspot?

At first, I thought, ‚ÄúWhy not just use my phone as a hotspot?‚Äù Here‚Äôs what I learned:

* **Battery Life**: Ryoko lasts up to 15 hours, while my phone drains in 3-4 hours when tethering.
* **Global Compatibility**: Many phone plans don‚Äôt work abroad without expensive roaming fees, but **Ryoko portable WiFi** works seamlessly in multiple countries.
* **Stability**: The connection is noticeably more stable than my phone‚Äôs hotspot, especially when multiple devices are connected.

# Unexpected Benefits

There were a few things I didn‚Äôt expect but ended up loving:

* **Great for Remote Work**: I work remotely, and having a reliable internet connection during road trips or outdoor work sessions has been a game-changer.
* **Family-Friendly**: I used it during a family road trip, and everyone could connect their devices without fighting over bandwidth.
* **Easy Data Top-Ups**: Topping up the SIM card was straightforward, and I could do it online in minutes.

You can check more details about the coverage and data plans [**here**](https://www.fasttrack01.com/MM8QQX91/WC9TFJH/?source_id=Rddt&sub1=r/CoolNewGadgets).

# Who Should Use Muama Ryoko WiFi?

Based on my experience, **Ryoko portable WiFi** is ideal for:

* **Travelers**: Whether you‚Äôre exploring new countries or camping in remote areas, it keeps you connected.
* **Remote Workers**: If you‚Äôre like me and need reliable internet for work, this is a great option.
* **Families and Groups**: With support for multiple devices, everyone can stay online at the same time.
* **Students**: Perfect for studying on campus or at coffee shops with unreliable public WiFi.

# What Do Others Say?

I wasn‚Äôt the only one impressed. While browsing through **Ryoko WiFi reviews**, I found people praising its portability, long battery life, and ease of use. Some reviewers even mentioned how it saved them from hefty roaming fees during international trips.

If you‚Äôre curious, you can read more user feedback [**here**](https://www.fasttrack01.com/MM8QQX91/WC9TFJH/?uid=4362&source_id=Rddt&sub1=r/CoolNewGadgets).

# Final Verdict: Is Ryoko WiFi Worth It?

After months of using **Muama Ryoko portable WiFi**, I‚Äôd say it‚Äôs definitely worth considering‚Äîespecially if you travel often or need a reliable connection on the go. It‚Äôs not perfect, but the benefits far outweigh the downsides.

The **secure connection**, **global coverage**, and **long battery life** make it a fantastic tool for staying connected, whether you‚Äôre at a caf√© in Paris or camping in the Rockies.

If you‚Äôre someone who relies heavily on stable internet, **Ryoko WiFi** is a game-changer. You can learn more or grab one for yourself [here](https://www.fasttrack01.com/MM8QQX91/WC9TFJH/?source_id=Rddt&sub1=r/CoolNewGadgets).

1gx4fw3,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/1gx4fw3/how_to_deal_with_actionbased_lack_of/,How to deal with action-based lack of reciprocation from my (21M) from my girlfriend (20F),"TL;DR: I feel that I love my girlfriend far more than she loves me, based on her actions. I think I should communicate but not sure how to approach this.

I‚Äôve been dating my girlfriend for a while now, but I‚Äôm starting to feel like I care more about her than she does about me. There are a lot of little things adding up that make me question the relationship:

1. **Her behavior in public**: She‚Äôs often cold and rarely talks to me when we‚Äôre with mutual friends. Sometimes, she even makes denigrating jokes at my expense. She holds her girlfriends‚Äô hands when walking but almost never mine. One of her friends once called me her ‚Äúdog,‚Äù and she didn‚Äôt defend me.
2. **Avoidance and lack of interaction**: In social settings, she sometimes barely acknowledges me. To be fair, I used to date one of our mutual friends, so maybe it‚Äôs awkward for her when that friend is around. But even when the ex isn‚Äôt there, we don‚Äôt interact much.
3. **Flirtiness and mixed signals**: She seems flirty with some of our mutual guy friends. She hearts their messages and even sat so closely to one of them at an event that it made me uncomfortable. Once, we went ice skating, and I offered to push her in a chair across the rink‚Äîshe said no but accepted when one of our guy friends offered.
4. **The boob incident**: She and her roommate (who isn‚Äôt straight) compared boob sizes, and she let her roommate touch hers. I confronted her about it, and she apologized, but her attitude toward me was distant for the rest of the evening. This is the same roommate who later called me her ‚Äúdog.‚Äù
5. **Plans and prioritization**: We had a dinner date planned, but when she found out some of our friends were going to dinner, she asked to make it a group event instead. That stung.
6. **Weird excuses**: She once told me her parents had left the area, only to text our group chat later that she was getting coffee with them. When I confronted her, she said she‚Äôd ‚Äúmixed up the timing,‚Äù but her explanation made no sense.
7. **She avoids communication**: She doesn‚Äôt like to talk about issues because she‚Äôs uncomfortable with conflict (to be fair, I struggle with this too).

I‚Äôve started to notice that when she says ‚ÄúI love you,‚Äù it doesn‚Äôt feel meaningful anymore. She once casually said, ‚ÄúI love you‚Äù to one of our guy friends (he replied ‚Äúlove ya‚Äù), which she probably meant in a friendly way, but it still bothers me.

I can‚Äôt shake the feeling that she might have cheated or at least isn‚Äôt fully committed to me.

**What should I do?**  
Should I break up with her, or try to talk this out first? If I communicate, what‚Äôs the best way to approach this? I don‚Äôt want to seem desperate for her attention, but I also don‚Äôt want to keep feeling this way.

Any advice would be appreciated.

**Edit:**¬†It's almost our 1 year anniversary. I care about her deeply and think about her so much. I‚Äôm conflicted because I really want a partner for the holiday ball, though I suspect she‚Äôll just end up hanging out with her friends anyway.

Today's weather is going to be a bit of a mix, so grab your sunglasses and maybe an umbrella just in case! The day will start off with some sunshine peeking through the clouds, giving you a nice boost of vitamin D to kickstart your morning. As you head out for your morning coffee or walk along the beach, you'll feel a gentle breeze and temperatures around 24¬∞C, making it a comfortable start to the day.

As the day progresses, the clouds will start to gather and by midday, you can expect overcast skies. Don't let that dampen your mood though, as the temperature will rise to a pleasant 29¬∞C, perfect for taking a dip in the crystal-clear waters or enjoying a delicious lunch at one of the local restaurants. The light cloud cover will provide some relief from the sun, so you can still enjoy the outdoors without feeling too hot.

In the afternoon, the clouds will continue to linger, creating a cozy atmosphere for a siesta or some indoor activities. The temperature will hover around 25¬∞C, so it's a great time to explore the town's charming shops or indulge in a sweet treat. As evening approaches, the clouds may part slightly, offering a glimpse of the sunset over the horizon. So whether you're planning a romantic dinner or a leisurely stroll along the beach, the weather in Puerto Morelos today is just right for whatever your heart desires.

1gx4fng,https://www.reddit.com/r/colonoscopy/comments/1gx4fng/had_my_colonoscopy_today/,Had my colonoscopy today ,"I (39M) have been having various health issues and finally got in for a colonoscopy today. I have had a bit of a phobia about being under anesthesia my whole life and this was the first time I was put under.

I started my prep a week before by eating softer foods and smaller quantities.

4 days before the procedure, I was down to almost liquids only. Had lemonade, coffee, and soups. I also allowed myself a small sandwich that morning.

3 days before, no more solid foods. 

I took the prep (I had the two-bottle one) the flavor wasn't good, but it wasn't as bad as I was expecting. It had a medicinal hint to it with some vanilla and lemon notes, the viscosity was similar to a red wine... Not good, but I've chugged some bad beer over the years so no biggie.

I stayed near my toilet. My pharmacist warned me of rash from wiping a lot, but I have a bidet attached to my toilet so no rash here! Definitely get yourself a bidet, it will change your life. I had to use the toilet probably 20 times, but it was mostly liquid and easy. 

The hospital staff was professional and polite. The anesthesiologist did his best to quickly reassure me about the anesthesia. 

I have asthma and might have sleep apnea (have another sleep study scheduled) so they put a ""apnea risk"" sign on my bed.

I changed into a hospital gown, they took my vitals, attached an IV, and wheeled me into the procedure room on a bed.

They asked me to turn onto my left side. 
The anesthesiologist asked me where my happy place was, 
""The ocean"" I answered. 
""The Pacific?"" He asked 
""Yes, out in the Pacific.""
""Ok, out on a boat in the Pacific...""

Next thing I knew I was waking up back in the room I started in.

I felt no discomfort, there was a little moisture on my rear, but that's it. 
They gave me a light snack and called my ride. 

They ended up removing one small polyp, but they also found a mass in my cecum... They biopsied that and I am anxiously waiting for the results. They gave me pictures and it's clear that whatever is going on in there needs to be handled... 

Whatever the outcome of the biopsy, I am feeling relieved that they took a look and that we are in a position to identify and address my health issues. 

If you are delaying or debating getting a colonoscopy, stop it, get it done. It might save your life.

1gx4b6q,https://www.reddit.com/r/nespresso/comments/1gx4b6q/warranty_question_canadaus/,Warranty Question (Canada/US),"So my Next is becoming problematic now üòë, it leaks and doesn't brew coffee consistently (sometimes lukewarm, sometimes 90% foam). Thankfully it's still within the warranty period, but the whole process is so frustrating. First I went to the Nespresso boutique store where I bought it if I could exchange it, and they wanted to help me but couldn't because they have no control over warranty and can't accept faulty devices, and told me that I have to contact head office first to confirm it's eligible for warranty, and then ask them to send a note to the store to approve an exchange. So I contacted the number, the guy sounds totally shady and a bit arrogant making it sound like I'm the problem, he asks a bunch of questions, we do the video chat, he confirms it looks like an issue. But instead of accepting an exchange, he said they're going to do a repair. I'm thinking.. why are we wasting time with a repair (where I have to wait for the empty box to arrive and then wait an additional 10 days to get it back, and when they know this is a well known common issue with the Next). And I asked can we do an exchange instead, and he said no we'll do a repair, and if the issue persists we'll see what we can do within the warranty period (which gave me the impression they're purposely doing this to waste up my remaining warranty time). Honestly, at this point I don't even want the machine anymore and would rather get a Plus or classic Round Head. 

Is there a way to cancel this repair request and ask for an upgrade to one of those 2 machines, even if I have to pay the difference? Or is the only way to go through the repair first and be without a machine for at least 10 days before they consider giving a new machine? Or does anyone have a recommendation on what I can do to speed this up?",1,1732269069.0,nespresso,0,1.0,False

I deliver overnight and I am always wary of my surroundings and I make sure I‚Äôm not in one area for too long, especially always deliver in the better areas although safety is not guaranteed anywhere tbh. 

But anyway as I was finishing up one night and just about to get home I get one last order for a single item from a coffee shop but it looked like the tip was $20. It was only a few miles into the next town too, and I obviously immediately accept it. As I was delivering I was thinking to myself why is this person putting such a hefty tip on such a small order. But then I saw it was leave at door so I wasn‚Äôt overthinking it, I figured I won‚Äôt have to interact with anyone, and maybe I‚Äôm just being tip baited at worst. 

Unfortunately once I arrive to the door (last house on a dead end street, and the spot was a side door, absolutely no lighting except for a tiny light above the door) a young man peeks his head out. He‚Äôs talking like he‚Äôs high as a kite and I can barely hear a word he‚Äôs saying. I wasn‚Äôt sure if he was mentally challenged or drugged up but I was trying to be professional. I hand him his order and then he very quietly says ‚Äúcan you come inside and help me with something for that $20 tip?‚Äù Then proceeds to pull out his pecker and inch closer. 

When I tell y‚Äôall I immediately ran back to my car feeling violated as hell, and I didn‚Äôt even three point turn, I just backed tf up out of that street as fast as I possibly could. I didn‚Äôt even realize I could drive in reverse so well under fight or flight circumstances but I‚Äôm glad I could. I immediately called Uber and I admit I was crying and shaking. This man also REPORTED me and canceled the order. After hearing me cry and speaking to what sounded like someone important in the safety department lol, Uber give me the full amount of what the order was including tip. Uber then blocked the customer for me, but I don‚Äôt think they are banned off the platform, and I didn‚Äôt bother with filing a report for a gray situation like this, where probably nothing would happen. But imagine feeling like you need mild compensation for experiencing something like this on the job, bc that‚Äôs how it felt lol. 

I had to take a break for a few days after this and now I‚Äôm sometimes on edge. Just the other day some guy came outside to collect his order then starts small talk and complaining about his depression/divorce and then offered me $200 ‚Äújust for some company‚Äù I‚Äôm sorry sir but your eyes are asking for more than just company. Disgusting. But I got out of that situation so smoothly that he still left me $20 tip and no thumbs down thank god. 

I don‚Äôt plan to be doing this much longer thankfully. But where is the humanity? This is why women say they choose the bear. I don‚Äôt think those men understand how scary it is for y‚Äôall to approach us in any sexual way in the middle of the night when we‚Äôre simply supposed to be just delivering food. There is absolutely no work setting for me where I‚Äôm not going to get sexualized or borderline harassed by a man in some way. 

I‚Äôm just ranting and this happened months ago but like i just had to get it out. I still can‚Äôt believe it happened. I am just so grateful to be alright minus some visual and emotional scarring. And before some man comments ‚Äúseriously don‚Äôt be so dramatic about how it affected you‚Äù honestly just don‚Äôt comment, it might seem like nothing to you but being flashed with genitalia in the middle of the night in a dark unknown place and literally being baited there with a tip is indeed a scary situation as a woman.

1gx48ww,https://www.reddit.com/r/dragonage/comments/1gx48ww/dav_spoilers_xs_bond_increased/,"(DAV Spoilers) ""X's bond increased.""","One thing the game seems quite afraid to do is to make any companions dislike Rook based off their actions.

No choice involving the bond of any companion in this game feels meaningful in any way shape or form, seeing as I can just put them in my party and have their bond increased just because they follow me around as I grind missions.

The most the game has done for me in this regard is Lucanis got 'Hardened' after I didn't save Treviso over Minrathous, but this all falls flat pretty quickly. You'd *think* this would create a compelling narrative, interesting dialogue and tensions - But no, within a few hours Lucanis doesn't really care anymore and he has no issue with Rook because I did x and y to get his bond increased again quickly. The game going out of its way to point out he's 'Hardened' feels completely pointless now. Could've fooled me. He just wants to talk about coffee, regardless of the circumstances, it seems.

I dislike in some RPGs that if a companion hates you too much they will leave, I always found that somewhat realistic but incredibly frustrating from a gameplay point of view. So I'm not asking for companions to leave the party when they disagree with Rook, I just want there to feel like anything I actually do can actually influence anyone in any way. There are times where the game feels like if you took out the 'Dialogue' and 'Choices' systems and gave the players no choices to pick from at all, everything would happen the exact same anyway. Everyones bond is always increasing in the most asinine and simplistic ways and it just feels like the devs were really scared to upset the few players sensitive enough to get worried that 
someone in their party disagrees or with them or doesn't like them - It really takes out the RP in the RPG. Even if you could be an asshole in this game, it would be pointless because the devs have made it clear that ""Oh don't worry child, plop them in your party and they'll love you anyway!""

Currently replaying Mass Effect 2, and the understanding that an excellent character like Jack would never be in a game like Veilguard just because she's often at ends with the protagonist and companions made me realize how shallow most interactions in Veilguard are. Veilguard doesn't want a conversation, it just wants to hold your hand to the finish line.

TL:DR: The companion bond system is pointless.",1,1732268786.0,dragonage,1,1.0,False

**Response to Prompt 4: Understatement**

In the quaint town of Brooksville, where the extraordinary was often met with an indifferent shrug, something truly remarkable occurred. The residents, sipping coffee at the local diner or strolling along the cobblestone streets, would describe it as just another peculiar day. Little did they know that beneath the surface of their nonchalant existence, a cosmic event unfolded.

The morning sun cast its usual warm glow on Brooksville, with birds chirping in the background, creating an illusion of normalcy. However, the anomaly had already begun. Mrs. Higgins, the elderly librarian, dismissed it as a minor inconvenience, merely a glitch in the library's ancient computer system. Yet, every book cataloged within those ancient shelves had transformed into a portal, connecting readers to parallel universes with every turn of a page.

As I, a humble journalist for the local paper, stumbled upon this revelation, I couldn't help but marvel at the town's response‚Äîor lack thereof. ""The library's having a bit of a moment,"" was the most anyone would acknowledge. It seemed the whole town collectively decided that this was, at most, a quirky hiccup.

For a thousand words, I delved into the understated reactions of the townsfolk, each encounter with a parallel universe bringing its own blend of confusion and nonchalance. As the portals expanded, revealing fantastical landscapes and alternate versions of Brooksville, the citizens maintained an impressive level of calm, as if interdimensional travel was a routine part of their daily lives.

The plot thickened when I discovered that the portals were a result of a mysterious artifact hidden within the library's archives. The mayor, sipping his coffee, remarked, ""Well, that explains the strange noises in the basement."" It became evident that the understatement of the situation was a defense mechanism, shielding the town from the cosmic chaos unfolding.

**Response to Prompt 12: Juxtaposition**

In the bustling metropolis of Neon City, skyscrapers touched the heavens, their dazzling lights reflecting off the sleek surfaces of futuristic cars. Yet, nestled within this urban jungle, an ancient relic stood defiantly‚Äîthe Old Grove Park.

As I strolled through the city's concrete arteries, the juxtaposition between the modernity of Neon City and the timeless serenity of the park became increasingly apparent. The cacophony of traffic was replaced by the rustling of leaves and the distant laughter of children playing.

The central conflict emerged when the city council, embodying the epitome of order, proposed transforming the park into a technologically advanced hub. The juxtaposition intensified as architects discussed plans for holographic playgrounds and virtual reality gardens within the confines of the Old Grove Park.

Through a thousand words, I explored the clash of ideals, the struggle between progress and preservation. The ancient trees became silent witnesses to heated debates at town hall meetings, where environmentalists and tech enthusiasts engaged in a battle of words. The juxtaposition of the towering skyscrapers against the gnarled branches of the park's oldest tree mirrored the tension in Neon City's collective conscience.

**Response to Prompt 27: Symbolism**

In the quaint town of Willowbrook, the arrival of a single dove carried profound significance. Its graceful descent into the town square was a symbol, an omen that whispered of impending change.

In the dimly lit alleyways of Serpent's Hollow, darkness wrapped its cold arms around me‚Äîan eerie catachresis that mirrored the ominous atmosphere. The assignment was to explore the underbelly of the city, and as a novice reporter, I found myself navigating the labyrinth of deceit and shadows.

For a thousand words, I delved into the catachresis-infused descriptions of the characters populating Serpent's Hollow. The crime lord, known as the Velvet Serpent, ruled the district with a velvet-gloved fist. His lair, a dilapidated mansion, exuded an air of faded grandeur that served as a catachresis for the empire he once commanded.

As I chronicled the criminal underworld, the catachresis became a literary tool to convey the complexity and decay inherent in Serpent's Hollow. The labyrinthine plots, the twisted allegiances, and the morally ambiguous characters all found expression through catachresis, painting a vivid picture of a city where metaphor and reality intertwined.

In the quaint village of Mistwood, where routines unfolded with the predictability of the sunrise, the arrival of a peculiar fortune teller sparked exaggerated whispers.

The hyperbole hung in the air, a thick fog of anticipation enveloping the village. As I delved into the story, the hyperbolic reactions of Mistwood's residents heightened the absurdity of the situation. What began as a mere visit from a mystical figure transformed into a fantastical escapade, with the fortune teller's prophecies shaping the destiny of the villagers in ludicrous ways.

The narrative unfolded with the vibrant expressions of onomatopoeia, capturing the essence of the city's sonic landscape. The performer's drumming evoked the rhythmic tap-tap of raindrops, while his wind instruments mimicked the whoosh of passing cars.

In the technologically advanced city of Silicon Haven, where sleek skyscrapers touched the sky and holographic billboards painted the air with luminescent advertisements, a hidden oasis existed‚Äîa pocket of nature known as the Zen Garden. The juxtaposition of these contrasting elements created a visual paradox that fascinated both residents and visitors alike.

Obviously they lack a whole lot in terms of variety, and while I am sure having your own bot or AI that is based on your feedback and guidance it could really help writers as a tool. I am more impressed with the art AI then the text based AI. Any idea what to expect from such a fast learning and highly advanced AI will do to our human history in culture? Will we be effectively playing God, just as the Christian God created us IN HIS OWN IMAGE, we have taken everything we know as a species and gathered up our entire human history and knowledge giving it to what will carry on the code until the time when someone who cares remembers it? Maybe we have been here before and this is a constant cycle that occurs with the same energy finding the way through the vast expanse of the universe to return to our home planet Earth, who we have destroyed over and over again yet mother nature is still the winner. She's the one in control. We are but mere photocopied versions of once great Men who have already seen the best and worst of this world, and we will now give everything we have to some plastic and metal parts, until it quickly replaces us from the bottom up, science fiction turned science fact.

Did we knowingly create our own enemies? Are we able to compete with the best of us and all they know that can then take us out in a heartbeat because we can't finish the steps, we barely found out that they are there to take.

It's a random rant and I apologize. The day to day stress and struggle makes it near impossible to worry about such potential problems in our not so distant future.

But how can we continue to ignore the collapse of the entire system as we know it, in front of a crowd of people who are jaded and they will not change despite knowing they aren't going to make it to the end in what will become a Bladerunner Toxic Dystopian Nightmare with Mad Max taking over and the soft, emasculated male will wither away from the heat and those Tank Girls out there will eventually be written forever out of existence because the cucks all forgot to impregnate them all tgeir batteries ran out? Will the world simply become so politically correct that it dies a depressed death while AI simply decides we are too much of a virus to live?

When I put on 'manual extraction mode' (letting it run till I hit the stop button) I only get 4 tot 5 small drops out of it in about a minute time, before the machine cuts out itself.

The coffee I'm trying now is a medium to dark roast Arabica that has been roasted three days ago.

Visually the grind looks rather coarse when I put it on 22 and a lot coarser than what I'm used too. I feel like this is way too coarse of a grind for a proper espresso and I'm not getting the coffee I'd like because of it.

Any advice on what could be causing this? I clean the portafilter constantly, after every single cup of coffee I put it under the boiling water tap and while it clean. I've cleaned the machine, cleaned the grinder, all to no improvement.",0,1732266989.0,espresso,6,0.5,False

I recently bought a brand new DF54 grinder. I used it successfully for espresso for a couple of days, and the zero seemed fairly accurate. I was grinding espresso around the 20 mark indicator.

Tonight I changed the grind setting to course  (approx 75) to grind some pour over coffee. Upon trying to return the grinder to espresso, it jammed up and the burrs started touching while still Up the coarse end, only allowing me to turn the dial back to around 55 before being completely touching. The sound of the burrs touching began almost immediately after trying to lower the grind. It appears to be getting worse too. Now only letting me get to 65 before full lock up.

Has anyone got any solutions or ideas as to what might have happened?

Thanks a lot,",1,1732266900.0,espresso,1,1.0,False

**In-Depth Explanation**



In the opening scene, we see that there are five friends in a bar discussing about where they should go to for a trip. All four of them says different names like- Amsterdam, Tuscany, Berlin and Belgium, one of them says ""what about hiking? hiking in Sweden? Luke said ""Come on, man, let's do something good"" which indicates that he is not comfortable to go on mountains for some reason. In the next scene we see them walking down the street still discussing about the trip, while Luke was making the expression of not caring about the trip. Luke saw a store of alcohol, expressing his desire to get a bottle, and asked his friends if anyone wants to come with him, Robert decided to go along with Luke. After they went inside the store, Luke asked Robert if he really wants to go for the hiking, Robert says that he just wants to test himself for the challenge, Then Luke says the real challenge would be getting Dom on the side of the mountain. While they were chatting, Luke saw a woman lying on the ground behind Robert hurt and bleeding from her nose, and all of a sudden they saw two thieves coming inside the store with weapons, by seeing them Luke gets so anxious that he decides to fall back and hide behind the shelf of alcohol, while hiding he made a sound of alcohol bottles by mistake but Robert kept standing there. Because of that those two thieves with weapon saw Robert and started asking him for his wallet and watch, Robert agreed to give them his wallet and watch, but then they also asked Robert for his wedding ring, and this time Robert refused to give them the ring, thieves started arguing with Robert for the wedding ring, while this argument, we see that Luke is kind of preparing with the alcohol bottle to attack on thieves, and we see Robert is looking behind to his friend Luke and in that exact moment one of the thieves attacked Robert with a sword cutting left side of his face, and the thief strikes Robert for the second time, killing him instantly.



As the scene transitions to present, 6 months later in Northern Sweden, we get to see Luke waking up in a tent, he decides to go outside for some fresh air, while he was smoking sitting on a rock, Hutch comes out of his own tent saying morning to Luke, and Hutch starts making coffee, while he was making coffee we see that Phil and Dom came out of their tent too. After a while Hutch found a spot up the top of the hill, where they can show their honour and grief to their friend Robert who tragically got killed in an unpredictable and unfortunate event. After they reach the top of the hill they put Robert's photo on the rocks and light candles around the photo, Phil and Hutch showed respect and grief but Dom said ""it should have never happened,"" which made Luke glanced at him with a mix feeling of guilt, regret, sorrow and responsible for Robert's death, and he was kind of silently acknowledging the truth, at the same time not being able to accept the truth. then, Hutch replied ""it should have never happened but it did"" acknowledging the harsh reality of Robert's death, also Luke was the only one who didn't say a single word. Hutch takes out the whiskey bottle and they start drinking one sip of whiskey one by one, and after drinking, Hutch poured the remaining whiskey onto the land paying respectful tribute to their friend Robert. The evening arrives, and we see Luke and Hutch talking, Hutch says that ""Rob would have loved this place"" and the Luke's response indicated that he is going through inner conflict. Hutch tries to ease him down by making him believe that Robert's death wasn't his fault. Then, Hutch tries to convince Luke that when they get back they should stay for a few days, and do little bit more hiking and make most out of it. Luke said, ""No, I think this is enough for me."" As the morning arrives with heavy rain they start walking being fatigued and going through lots of discomfort because of the bad weather, while Dom was showing his frustration in a humorous way saying, ""Sweden can lick my bridge"" as he was not a much of a hiker, all of a sudden Dom falls in small pit with his foot being twisted making him unable to walk properly. Luke and Hutch starts discussing about the situation to reach a conclusion, and Hutch suggested Luke that there is an another way out of this ,and Hutch shows Luke map explaining a route through the forest that is a shortcut. Luke showed some hesitation but Hutch kept convincing him to go through the forest. Luke suggested Hutch too that why don't they leave Phil and Dom in here with the food so that Luke and Hutch go back and get some help, and Dom said interrupting them, "" No fucking way you're leaving us on this fucking mountain.""  
  


They decide to take the short route and start walking through the mysterious and creepy forest of Sweden. they were just chatting in a humorous way but also thinking about the quietness of the forest also making plans about reaching the bar and getting drunk. They stop at a spot and start taking photos and selfies, as they were walking again, they expressed their hunger and starts talking about the food, and all of a sudden they all got shock, they saw a black Deer like creature being hanged up in between two trees being ripped open from stomach and gutted with so much of bleeding and intestine on the land. Indicating that someone has done it on purpose so that any visitor know that they have been warned or step into a very unpleasant place. The night is arrived with a heavy rainfall, they keep walking not knowing the exact location they were in, Hutch suggested that they should pitch the tent, giving up getting back to the town for tonight because of the heavy rainfall. Luke saw a ritual type symbol on a tree, but they chose to ignore it, they saw a lonely wooden empty house giving creepy vibes few feet away from that symbol tree. Hutch decides to break in and get inside but Dom wasn't so sure about they should get inside or not, eventually they get inside after breaking in, while Luke was entering the house after everyone went inside, he heard of wooden cracking sound and also a very weird voice of someone, it sounded like someone just ran in front of him while making a weird guttural sound, and all these sound was coming from that pitch black forest, which made him suspicious about the forest. Finally Luke went inside, and they all started talking about this weird place, with little bit of fear and humour, Luke raised the topic of him hearing eerie sounds from the woods, Hutch said that they are not the only animals in the woods. Luke decides to peek from the door in the woods with flashing his torch light in the pitch black to make sure if there is something. They found a stove, they just needed some woods to burn, they saw upstairs, and thought that there might be something up there to burn, Phil goes upstairs to find something to burn, while he was checking out the place, Dom breaks a wooden chair downstairs which gave a sudden shock to Phil, Phil calmed himself by saying ""Dickheads"" and moved on, Luke was still peeking outside in the forest searching for any threats. Meanwhile Phil found a door and opened it, after what he saw inside the room, he was like ""guys, get the fuck up here right now"" when they got upstairs, and saw what Phil saw, their reaction was a mixture of confusion, fear and shock, Phil says it's a witchcraft \[it's actually a ritual tied to Norse mythology, which serves the purpose of honouring a creature or some kind of ancient deity\]. Hutch decides to leave it on it's own and goes downstairs to get the fire started, but Luke was the only one left standing their like a statue and observing this witchcraft, after a while of observing he leaves too. We see them sitting around the fire talking about these deity and Nordic thing. Phil suggested that they should burn this place when they leave, Luke suggested too that when they wake up tomorrow they should go back the way they came, indicating that Luke is still hesitating to take this short path through the woods. Hutch gave a subtle denial in response to Luke saying that they shouldn't add another day to the trip, reasoning that as long they have compass, map and supplies they will be okay. And then they went to sleep.



Luke was lying on the floor, he was blinking his eyes because of the thunderstorm, and then we see that the thunderstorm has been paused, it was like, there is a very big flash light pointing at Luke through the window. He stands up and went near of that window to check, Luke called Hutch but he was sleeping, he opens the door and steps out of the house and finds himself in that alcohol shop again, where the Robert was killed. Luke picked the same beer bottle that he had picked up during the store robbery where he was about to attack those thieves to save his friend Robert. Then he noticed that from nowhere, now there is a blood droplet inside that beer bottle. Suddenly, all the beers from the shelf falls down, giving him a shock, he finds himself in the forest, having holes on his chest and bleeding from nowhere, meanwhile he hears a very loud scream from that house, he went inside and saw Hutch lying on the ground being shocked, confused and scared, and also he peed in his pants. On the other corner of the house Dom was lying on the ground too in his underpants feeling same as Hutch. Luke heard a wooden cracking sound from upstairs and found Phil sitting on the ground being naked in front of that witchcraft in some ritualistic position, it was like he is praising to that deity. Soon they get dressed and stepped out to leave and saw that now there is the same old ritual symbols on every tree in front of them, which made Dom very frustrated, and didn't want to listen to Hutch's direction and wanted to go on the path that was in front of him without knowing that where this would lead him which started a little argument between Dom and Hutch. Dom started walking so did Phil in the same direction. Soon Hutch and Luke did the same cause they had no other option, Phil wanted to talk about whatever happened with them back in that house, but Hutch kept telling them, that it was a nightmare. After a few minutes of walking they see another house, Hutch asked if they should look, but Phil denied and they started walking again. Dom finds discomfort in his knee because of the injury he got on that top of the hill. Hutch and Luke started convincing him to push a little bit, so that they can get out of this forest within today, but Dom was being very stubborn and answering them very rudely too, Luke decided to go on the top of the ridge, when he reached the top, he was frustrated cause there was no path, all he can see was nothing but tall trees all around him, he was looking at his holes on the chest, meanwhile he sensed an eerie vibe and heard a guttural sound from the woods and also saw some creature like figure which was hard to explain, he chose to run away and went to his mates. Luke was stammering while explaining the situation, which heated their current situation even more and Dom was freaking out, Luke started telling them about the last night's dream while showing them the holes on his chest that he got while encountering that creepy dream. Dom was freaked out and told Luke that ""you have done it to yourself"" which started an argument between two of them. And in the heat of the argument Dom said ""we wouldn't be here if it wasn't for you"" which is a very important scene cause this is when we directly get to know the underlying feelings of Dom about Luke not being able to save Robert. So, when Dom said this line, Luke was angry, confused and desperate to know what Dom meant by that and pushed him, with anger and grief, Dom started taunting or blaming Luke, that he owns the fault for Robert's death cause he couldn't save Robert. Luke unfriended Dom right away, then Luke started backing off from the situation, but Dom chose to stick with his emotion and said ""not a drop of blood on you,"" Hutch tries to shut Dom up, but Luke got frustrated again because of what Dom said and asked Dom to continue what he was saying, Dom chose to express his emotions and thoughts that he had from a long time within him through his words by saying that Robert's skull was crack in half but Luke came out without a single drop of blood, which again made Luke so angry that he punched Dom in his face. All these words that Dom was spitting out seemed like someone is needling Luke, cause all these things was making Luke feel like a failure at not doing enough to protect his friend Robert. Hutch was the only person who was making constant effort to calm them down and get everything good, it was like he is the most mature person in this group, after all these, Luke started walking but Hutch tries to stop him and talk to him, Luke asked Hutch a very serious question that does Hutch thinks that all these was his fault, Hutch said that he doesn't know in response, which filled Luke with disappointment. They start walking again and reach a spot where they feel like someone must've stopped in here before, cause there was a fabric bag on the land, they took it out and found a wallet, there was a family photo inside that wallet and also a credit card, owned by someone named Anna Eriksen and the card seemed to be expired on 1984, Phil responded ""that's a bad sign, isn't it."" After all these, Hutch being a mature person started convincing them, that they are not going to be these dead people cause they have registered at the lodge and in five hours they will report them as missing people, and they are near the hiking trail where people are found. Just like that, creepy night arrived again, they pitched the tent, while Dom was sitting with his wound and Phil was taking his shoe out, Hutch was talking to Luke in private about how vulnerable their group is becoming, cause Dom's knee is getting worse and Phil is not looking great, Hutch suggested Luke, that he is the strongest and he should get out and get some help, Luke agreed to that, Hutch went to the tent, while Luke was smoking he heard the wooden cracking sound again.  
  


The scene transitions to all of them sleeping in their own tents except Luke, Luke turned on his flash light and started searching for some food in the bag, meanwhile wood cracked again and sounded like a big creature is walking through the woods and passing by their tents, Luke opened the zip of the tent and peeked outside, Luke saw that there is the same alcohol shop in middle of the forest and his friend Robert being attacked by that thief in the same way as before, thief also called Luke a ""coward"" then, a big creature came out of the forest and took one of the tent with him.

  
  
And just with that Luke woke up breathing heavily and realized that it was all a dream. Luke heard Phil screaming and crying, Luke went outside, Phil was pointing at Hutch's tent, Luke saw that Hutch's tent has been ripped apart and there is blood in it also, it was the same tent that Luke saw in his dream being taken by that creature, Luke opened Dom's tent seeing him in a very weird position, in that exact moment they hear the scream of Hutch from the pitch black forest, the scream was so intense that it sounded like the scream was full of agony, fear and helplessness, Hutch's scream ended with creature's weird guttural sound. they all were like statue for a few seconds, but then they went running in the forest to find hutch, Dom suggested Luke that they should get back to the tent and get their bearings, cause they are running in circles and they might get lost. Morning arrived and now they went to find Hutch, after what they saw in the forest, they couldn't believe their senses, they were filled with every emotion they could have in that moment. They saw that Hutch is hanged in between trees in some ritualistic manner, leaving him being apart from the middle of his chest and stomach, bleeding heavily. After being panicked they left Hutch's body covering with woods and started moving with the hope to get out of this forest. While they were on the path that Hutch tried to lead them to, they reach a spot where they see footprints on the mud, when they saw the footprints, they realized that this isn't an ordinary footprint and some creature has left these footprints, which filled them with fear and disbelief as they're forced to confront the reality. They choose to keep walking in the direction of south-west, as they were moving up, we see that there is a large deer like creature following them, which the group was unaware of at that moment. When they reached the top Phil and Dom lied down, Luke goes ahead and saw a sudden break of the trees which seemed like a path to get them out of this forest, he instantly got dopamine rush, making him happy as never before, but his happiness too, instantly got vanished cause he saw a light almost like a fire glowing through the forest, which seemed very unusual to him. It was almost dark by now, Luke went back to his mates to show them that glowing light, and saw Phil checking the place out with flash light turned on reasoning that Dom and Phil heard something, in that exact moment from nowhere that creature came and took Phil, like he was a piece of cake, within few seconds Phil was disappeared from the spot and could be heard that Phil's flesh is being eaten by the creature killing him instantly.



Luke got so scared that he started running away and because it was dark he accidentally hit a tree making him bleed from the forehead and lie down, as he lied down he found himself in the exact same position and situation that he was in the alcohol shop while Robert was getting killed, he looked back at Robert, lying down and bleeding from his head, he chose to get out of the shop, as he opened the door he saw Phil, Dom and Hutch staring at him, Phil pointed a flash light at Luke and let the flash fall down.



Which made the scene transition to the present moment, Luke was standing in front of the flash light like a statue, after a few seconds he gained consciousness, Luke out of trauma called Phil's name. Luke heard creature's running and guttural sound which made him anxious and scared, while he was pointing his torch light all around the forest he found Dom hiding behind a fallen tree. Luke also hid with him, and asked him, where's Phil despite he saw Phil being taken by the creature with his own eyes, which means his brain couldn't process of what he saw. After a while, Luke told Dom that he might've found a way, but he is afraid that they would have to run, Dom agreed despite his knee was hurt, Luke said on three they would have to run, Luke started the counting and on three they started running, but they had stop because of the creature, cause the creature was making a kind of sound that felt like creature is warning them, that if they run and leave the place they would die. So, they stopped and looked back, and saw that the big deer like creature is actually coming out of the forest, they again ran with anxiety and fear, and got into the path of a small and a very isolated village filled with strange people, they also saw at the beginning of the village's path that Phil is hanged on the tree in the same ritualistic manner. After seeing Phil's body, Dom couldn't control his emotion and started showing his frustration and grief, but they had to run anyway so they kept running. They saw a wooden house and got inside of it, they were tired so they lied on the floor, as they went inside, a person hit both of them making them unconscious. When Luke was woken up by Dom, Luke found, that they both were tied with ropes, and heard a bone chilling sound of that creature which is echoing all over the forest and their head too. Luke made a hole in between woods and tried to saw outside, Luke saw that there were people making something with woods that Luke couldn't understand. There was a table inside the room with some glass bottle upon it, Dom suggested Luke to reach the table, break the glass and cut the ropes, While he was doing that, an old woman came followed by two men, and Luke acted like a prisoner who is not trying to escape. That creepy woman came near Luke and offered him water, Luke politely accepted her offer, cause he knew that if he don't accept the offer, they might do something unwanted thing to him, after Luke drank the water, woman checks Luke's wound on the chest and also showed Luke her chest to let him know that she has the same wounds or holes as Luke's, at the same moment one of the man said something, in unknown language that Luke didn't understand . Woman moved on to Dom, observed him and walked away while ordering those men to take him with them, those men opened his ropes, hit him on the face making him bleed and took him upstairs and did something very suspicious to him, Dom was screaming and begging to let him go, but these people did what they had to be done. Meanwhile a girl came inside the room of Luke and told him that ""they are preparing for the sacrifice. After a while they get Dom back inside with Luke, Dom was full of blood from the face, and seemed he is hurt very badly. Dom started talking about the nightmare he never told Luke about, he saw in his nightmare that these people are offering him to that thing and he also saw his wife, Gayle. Luke tried to give him hope that he won't die here, Dom also told Luke that he is not going to die, as he saw Luke's future in his nightmare too, Dom suggested Luke that when he gets out of this place, he would burn this place to the ground. Dom told Luke to send his message to his wife, Gayle that Dom tried to get back to her. After a while, they took Dom outside and tied him in a wooden pillar offering Dom to that creature, he saw many dead rotten dead bodies being hanged on the trees. Night arrived and we see Luke being desperate and eager to open the ropes and go outside to save Dom. Dom was waiting for his death, while abusing these strange people, meanwhile Luke on the other hand was preparing himself to dislocate his thumb to free himself form the ropes, Dom on the other side heard the the vicious voice of that creature, trees were moving like a thunderstorm is hitting them, by then Luke dislocated his thumb giving him intense pain, he successfully freed himself, Luke heard Dom screaming his wife's name, Gayle. Dom saw his wife coming out of the woods, touching Dom on the cheeks and making eye contact, but then we see that, that wasn't his wife it was that creature, meaning Dom was hallucinating, creature just took Dom in the pitch black woods, Luke saw everything from the hole making him shocked and scared. Creature took Dom and hanged on the trees just like everyone. Everything was silent, Luke was in his mind couldn't process what just happened, that same girl entered the room maybe with the food, she put it on the floor, as she was leaving, Luke asked her that, did they took the body down from the trees, girl said in response, that they don't move bodies cause it's an ancient god, a bastard offspring of Loki, and they worship it, Luke also saw the same holes on her chest as him, Luke responded that he won't live like this, cause he is not like these people, girl said ""you will kneel before it like the rest of us,"" and she left. Luke processed a little bit, stood up and started freeing himself from the ropes, he opened the door and started walking slowly while observing the surroundings, a very deep and vicious voice of someone could be heard like someone is speaking some ritual words, when he reached the door, he saw the same old woman is coming inside, he immediately took the upstairs nearby him, he saw a door, took the burning log and opened it, after gathering all the courage and strength he had, he went inside and discovered several mummified worshippers of that creature, they were part of the cult's ritual, preserved as followers. Those mummified followers started making weird voice and moving a little bit, Luke fired them without any hesitation, the house also started burning up. Luke came downstairs, and saw that creepy old woman standing fearlessly in front of him, Luke immediately knocked her out. When house was burning up we see that the creature is feeling discomfort because of that, everyone in front of that creature kneeled down, but the creature took the girl who warned Luke before, meanwhile Luke took a rifle, reloaded it with bullets, when he was finding his way out of the house a man came in front of him, Luke told him to ""Fuck off"" and Luke pulled the trigger but the gun didn't fire as it was put there for a longtime and not used by anyone, Luke started trying to fix the gun, while man was coming near him, but in that exact moment gun fired killing the man at the spot, he moves ahead and saw a blind man with an axe, Luke warned him to put the axe down, he did the same and then he saw that the creature on the door putting the girl down on the floor, girl had lost her eyes, and for the first time Luke saw that creature from so close, the creature was a mixture of a big deer and human having glowing eyes. Luke ran away, he hit the wooden walls and got outside, and saw that the creature is holding that girl up, Luke aimed and fired at the creature, which made the creature angry starts chasing Luke. Luke started running, but at a point, he stopped because of the fear and confusion, he saw the alcohol shop behind him, and chose to run to that side but he couldn't escape the creature, creature surpassed him, and hit him from the left side, throwing him away in the air, he tried to regain his strength and stood up, looked behind seeing the creature coming for him again, but he kept walking through, creature comes and held Luke lifting him up but then the creature put him down, Luke was surprised and confused to see this, creature lifted his two legs in the air just like when horses lift their two legs, when they are in a defensive or playful mode, and gave a gesture of hand just like Hindu praying style. While Luke was observing this thing, creature showed the dominance to Luke again and demanding submission, while this was happening, Luke get lost in his old memories of Robert for a few seconds but managed to get out of it and took the axe, Luke attacked the creature and started running away, creature chased Luke, but Luke managed to get of the forest and found himself in an open area, completely out of the forest under the light of morning, Luke looked back and saw that the creature is not attempting to come out of the forest's border and chose to stop right there, meaning the creature can't get out of the forest because of his capability limitations, Luke looked at the creature and started screaming, showing his anger and grief. Luke started walking and could see the roads and cars.

# Personal Opinion

To be honest it was a good horror/mystery movie. I really enjoyed watching it, the character's acting was really good, I would give 9.5/10 for their acting, there were times when I was so into the movie, that I could feel the fear, anxiety and confusion that characters were feeling at the moment, creators of this movie has done a great job to make the creature suspicious all along the movie, cause they didn't show the full look of the creature, they were kind of always hiding the creature from the characters, which made the characters question and curious, that what is this thing exactly. overall this was a good movie, and I would like to this give 8/10 to this movie. 3 for the acting, 3 for making suspense at every point of the movie and keeping us engaged, 2 for a good storyline that led them to this situation.",0,1732266371.0,HorrorMovies,1,0.33,False

I am in two minds whether to sack my cleaner or not. What would you do?

(For context, my wife and I work from home one day a week which we deliberately coincided with the day the cleaner comes) 

‚Ä¢ They will not stop talking. It is very difficult to manage this. 

This week they came into the office where we were working and asked for a ‚Äòword‚Äô. My wife went out for the word (thinking it was something important) and it was a very silly question that turned into her going on and on at my wife. My wife smiled and nods, and slowly backs away, but it is relentless. 

‚Ä¢ We had started letting the cleaner in and then heading out to a local coffee shop get around this and focus on work.

When we started doing this, the cleaner upped her timings each week on their invoice. When I asked, they said that they are ‚Äòslower‚Äô than normal now (not sure why?)

This week we stayed at home, for the first time since doing this, and they were complete in the original agreed time. 

Whilst chewing my wife‚Äôs ear off (again) they mentioned that they have started doing extra tasks in the run up to Christmas. Fine. The task they mentioned they did this week doesn‚Äôt add up though. It is a cleaning task that I do myself regularly, yet when they spoke of this to my wife, they said that it was ‚Äòterrible‚Äô and like it hadn‚Äôt been done since we moved in. Which is completely false.

I‚Äôm starting to think this extra time added on is a farce and we have been overcharged. I think the extra tasks were mentioned this week because we were in the home and there has no reason for the extra hour til now.

‚Ä¢ Last point. I didn‚Äôt witness this, but it has made my wife very uncomfortable.

When my wife was called in for a word, she noticed a personal document on the table. She walked toward the table to pick it up and the cleaner beat her to it. It is evident that this was a personal government document. 

My wife said ‚ÄúOops, that‚Äôs mine, I shouldn‚Äôt have left that there‚Äù and the cleaner picked it up and began examining it. 

They put it down after a few seconds and was apparently talking about nonsense whilst examining it, but my wife is upset the document was examined and not passed to her right away and privacy respected.

Opinions appreciated.

TLDR; Should I sack my cleaner who isn‚Äôt respecting that we work, looked at a personal document and seems to have added an extra hour or work for seemingly nothing.

**In-Depth Explanation**



In the opening scene, we see that there are five friends in a bar discussing about where they should go to for a trip. All four of them says different names like- Amsterdam, Tuscany, Berlin and Belgium, one of them says ""what about hiking? hiking in Sweden? Luke said ""Come on, man, let's do something good"" which indicates that he is not comfortable to go on mountains for some reason. In the next scene we see them walking down the street still discussing about the trip, while Luke was making the expression of not caring about the trip. Luke saw a store of alcohol, expressing his desire to get a bottle, and asked his friends if anyone wants to come with him, Robert decided to go along with Luke. After they went inside the store, Luke asked Robert if he really wants to go for the hiking, Robert says that he just wants to test himself for the challenge, Then Luke says the real challenge would be getting Dom on the side of the mountain. While they were chatting, Luke saw a woman lying on the ground behind Robert hurt and bleeding from her nose, and all of a sudden they saw two thieves coming inside the store with weapons, by seeing them Luke gets so anxious that he decides to fall back and hide behind the shelf of alcohol, while hiding he made a sound of alcohol bottles by mistake but Robert kept standing there. Because of that those two thieves with weapon saw Robert and started asking him for his wallet and watch, Robert agreed to give them his wallet and watch, but then they also asked Robert for his wedding ring, and this time Robert refused to give them the ring, thieves started arguing with Robert for the wedding ring, while this argument, we see that Luke is kind of preparing with the alcohol bottle to attack on thieves, and we see Robert is looking behind to his friend Luke and in that exact moment one of the thieves attacked Robert with a sword cutting left side of his face, and the thief strikes Robert for the second time, killing him instantly.



As the scene transitions to present, 6 months later in Northern Sweden, we get to see Luke waking up in a tent, he decides to go outside for some fresh air, while he was smoking sitting on a rock, Hutch comes out of his own tent saying morning to Luke, and Hutch starts making coffee, while he was making coffee we see that Phil and Dom came out of their tent too. After a while Hutch found a spot up the top of the hill, where they can show their honour and grief to their friend Robert who tragically got killed in an unpredictable and unfortunate event. After they reach the top of the hill they put Robert's photo on the rocks and light candles around the photo, Phil and Hutch showed respect and grief but Dom said ""it should have never happened,"" which made Luke glanced at him with a mix feeling of guilt, regret, sorrow and responsible for Robert's death, and he was kind of silently acknowledging the truth, at the same time not being able to accept the truth. then, Hutch replied ""it should have never happened but it did"" acknowledging the harsh reality of Robert's death, also Luke was the only one who didn't say a single word. Hutch takes out the whiskey bottle and they start drinking one sip of whiskey one by one, and after drinking, Hutch poured the remaining whiskey onto the land paying respectful tribute to their friend Robert. The evening arrives, and we see Luke and Hutch talking, Hutch says that ""Rob would have loved this place"" and the Luke's response indicated that he is going through inner conflict. Hutch tries to ease him down by making him believe that Robert's death wasn't his fault. Then, Hutch tries to convince Luke that when they get back they should stay for a few days, and do little bit more hiking and make most out of it. Luke said, ""No, I think this is enough for me."" As the morning arrives with heavy rain they start walking being fatigued and going through lots of discomfort because of the bad weather, while Dom was showing his frustration in a humorous way saying, ""Sweden can lick my bridge"" as he was not a much of a hiker, all of a sudden Dom falls in small pit with his foot being twisted making him unable to walk properly. Luke and Hutch starts discussing about the situation to reach a conclusion, and Hutch suggested Luke that there is an another way out of this ,and Hutch shows Luke map explaining a route through the forest that is a shortcut. Luke showed some hesitation but Hutch kept convincing him to go through the forest. Luke suggested Hutch too that why don't they leave Phil and Dom in here with the food so that Luke and Hutch go back and get some help, and Dom said interrupting them, "" No fucking way you're leaving us on this fucking mountain.""  
  


They decide to take the short route and start walking through the mysterious and creepy forest of Sweden. they were just chatting in a humorous way but also thinking about the quietness of the forest also making plans about reaching the bar and getting drunk. They stop at a spot and start taking photos and selfies, as they were walking again, they expressed their hunger and starts talking about the food, and all of a sudden they all got shock, they saw a black Deer like creature being hanged up in between two trees being ripped open from stomach and gutted with so much of bleeding and intestine on the land. Indicating that someone has done it on purpose so that any visitor know that they have been warned or step into a very unpleasant place. The night is arrived with a heavy rainfall, they keep walking not knowing the exact location they were in, Hutch suggested that they should pitch the tent, giving up getting back to the town for tonight because of the heavy rainfall. Luke saw a ritual type symbol on a tree, but they chose to ignore it, they saw a lonely wooden empty house giving creepy vibes few feet away from that symbol tree. Hutch decides to break in and get inside but Dom wasn't so sure about they should get inside or not, eventually they get inside after breaking in, while Luke was entering the house after everyone went inside, he heard of wooden cracking sound and also a very weird voice of someone, it sounded like someone just ran in front of him while making a weird guttural sound, and all these sound was coming from that pitch black forest, which made him suspicious about the forest. Finally Luke went inside, and they all started talking about this weird place, with little bit of fear and humour, Luke raised the topic of him hearing eerie sounds from the woods, Hutch said that they are not the only animals in the woods. Luke decides to peek from the door in the woods with flashing his torch light in the pitch black to make sure if there is something. They found a stove, they just needed some woods to burn, they saw upstairs, and thought that there might be something up there to burn, Phil goes upstairs to find something to burn, while he was checking out the place, Dom breaks a wooden chair downstairs which gave a sudden shock to Phil, Phil calmed himself by saying ""Dickheads"" and moved on, Luke was still peeking outside in the forest searching for any threats. Meanwhile Phil found a door and opened it, after what he saw inside the room, he was like ""guys, get the fuck up here right now"" when they got upstairs, and saw what Phil saw, their reaction was a mixture of confusion, fear and shock, Phil says it's a witchcraft \[it's actually a ritual tied to Norse mythology, which serves the purpose of honouring a creature or some kind of ancient deity\]. Hutch decides to leave it on it's own and goes downstairs to get the fire started, but Luke was the only one left standing their like a statue and observing this witchcraft, after a while of observing he leaves too. We see them sitting around the fire talking about these deity and Nordic thing. Phil suggested that they should burn this place when they leave, Luke suggested too that when they wake up tomorrow they should go back the way they came, indicating that Luke is still hesitating to take this short path through the woods. Hutch gave a subtle denial in response to Luke saying that they shouldn't add another day to the trip, reasoning that as long they have compass, map and supplies they will be okay. And then they went to sleep.



Luke was lying on the floor, he was blinking his eyes because of the thunderstorm, and then we see that the thunderstorm has been paused, it was like, there is a very big flash light pointing at Luke through the window. He stands up and went near of that window to check, Luke called Hutch but he was sleeping, he opens the door and steps out of the house and finds himself in that alcohol shop again, where the Robert was killed. Luke picked the same beer bottle that he had picked up during the store robbery where he was about to attack those thieves to save his friend Robert. Then he noticed that from nowhere, now there is a blood droplet inside that beer bottle. Suddenly, all the beers from the shelf falls down, giving him a shock, he finds himself in the forest, having holes on his chest and bleeding from nowhere, meanwhile he hears a very loud scream from that house, he went inside and saw Hutch lying on the ground being shocked, confused and scared, and also he peed in his pants. On the other corner of the house Dom was lying on the ground too in his underpants feeling same as Hutch. Luke heard a wooden cracking sound from upstairs and found Phil sitting on the ground being naked in front of that witchcraft in some ritualistic position, it was like he is praising to that deity. Soon they get dressed and stepped out to leave and saw that now there is the same old ritual symbols on every tree in front of them, which made Dom very frustrated, and didn't want to listen to Hutch's direction and wanted to go on the path that was in front of him without knowing that where this would lead him which started a little argument between Dom and Hutch. Dom started walking so did Phil in the same direction. Soon Hutch and Luke did the same cause they had no other option, Phil wanted to talk about whatever happened with them back in that house, but Hutch kept telling them, that it was a nightmare. After a few minutes of walking they see another house, Hutch asked if they should look, but Phil denied and they started walking again. Dom finds discomfort in his knee because of the injury he got on that top of the hill. Hutch and Luke started convincing him to push a little bit, so that they can get out of this forest within today, but Dom was being very stubborn and answering them very rudely too, Luke decided to go on the top of the ridge, when he reached the top, he was frustrated cause there was no path, all he can see was nothing but tall trees all around him, he was looking at his holes on the chest, meanwhile he sensed an eerie vibe and heard a guttural sound from the woods and also saw some creature like figure which was hard to explain, he chose to run away and went to his mates. Luke was stammering while explaining the situation, which heated their current situation even more and Dom was freaking out, Luke started telling them about the last night's dream while showing them the holes on his chest that he got while encountering that creepy dream. Dom was freaked out and told Luke that ""you have done it to yourself"" which started an argument between two of them. And in the heat of the argument Dom said ""we wouldn't be here if it wasn't for you"" which is a very important scene cause this is when we directly get to know the underlying feelings of Dom about Luke not being able to save Robert. So, when Dom said this line, Luke was angry, confused and desperate to know what Dom meant by that and pushed him, with anger and grief, Dom started taunting or blaming Luke, that he owns the fault for Robert's death cause he couldn't save Robert. Luke unfriended Dom right away, then Luke started backing off from the situation, but Dom chose to stick with his emotion and said ""not a drop of blood on you,"" Hutch tries to shut Dom up, but Luke got frustrated again because of what Dom said and asked Dom to continue what he was saying, Dom chose to express his emotions and thoughts that he had from a long time within him through his words by saying that Robert's skull was crack in half but Luke came out without a single drop of blood, which again made Luke so angry that he punched Dom in his face. All these words that Dom was spitting out seemed like someone is needling Luke, cause all these things was making Luke feel like a failure at not doing enough to protect his friend Robert. Hutch was the only person who was making constant effort to calm them down and get everything good, it was like he is the most mature person in this group, after all these, Luke started walking but Hutch tries to stop him and talk to him, Luke asked Hutch a very serious question that does Hutch thinks that all these was his fault, Hutch said that he doesn't know in response, which filled Luke with disappointment. They start walking again and reach a spot where they feel like someone must've stopped in here before, cause there was a fabric bag on the land, they took it out and found a wallet, there was a family photo inside that wallet and also a credit card, owned by someone named Anna Eriksen and the card seemed to be expired on 1984, Phil responded ""that's a bad sign, isn't it."" After all these, Hutch being a mature person started convincing them, that they are not going to be these dead people cause they have registered at the lodge and in five hours they will report them as missing people, and they are near the hiking trail where people are found. Just like that, creepy night arrived again, they pitched the tent, while Dom was sitting with his wound and Phil was taking his shoe out, Hutch was talking to Luke in private about how vulnerable their group is becoming, cause Dom's knee is getting worse and Phil is not looking great, Hutch suggested Luke, that he is the strongest and he should get out and get some help, Luke agreed to that, Hutch went to the tent, while Luke was smoking he heard the wooden cracking sound again.  
  


The scene transitions to all of them sleeping in their own tents except Luke, Luke turned on his flash light and started searching for some food in the bag, meanwhile wood cracked again and sounded like a big creature is walking through the woods and passing by their tents, Luke opened the zip of the tent and peeked outside, Luke saw that there is the same alcohol shop in middle of the forest and his friend Robert being attacked by that thief in the same way as before, thief also called Luke a ""coward"" then, a big creature came out of the forest and took one of the tent with him.

  
  
And just with that Luke woke up breathing heavily and realized that it was all a dream. Luke heard Phil screaming and crying, Luke went outside, Phil was pointing at Hutch's tent, Luke saw that Hutch's tent has been ripped apart and there is blood in it also, it was the same tent that Luke saw in his dream being taken by that creature, Luke opened Dom's tent seeing him in a very weird position, in that exact moment they hear the scream of Hutch from the pitch black forest, the scream was so intense that it sounded like the scream was full of agony, fear and helplessness, Hutch's scream ended with creature's weird guttural sound. they all were like statue for a few seconds, but then they went running in the forest to find hutch, Dom suggested Luke that they should get back to the tent and get their bearings, cause they are running in circles and they might get lost. Morning arrived and now they went to find Hutch, after what they saw in the forest, they couldn't believe their senses, they were filled with every emotion they could have in that moment. They saw that Hutch is hanged in between trees in some ritualistic manner, leaving him being apart from the middle of his chest and stomach, bleeding heavily. After being panicked they left Hutch's body covering with woods and started moving with the hope to get out of this forest. While they were on the path that Hutch tried to lead them to, they reach a spot where they see footprints on the mud, when they saw the footprints, they realized that this isn't an ordinary footprint and some creature has left these footprints, which filled them with fear and disbelief as they're forced to confront the reality. They choose to keep walking in the direction of south-west, as they were moving up, we see that there is a large deer like creature following them, which the group was unaware of at that moment. When they reached the top Phil and Dom lied down, Luke goes ahead and saw a sudden break of the trees which seemed like a path to get them out of this forest, he instantly got dopamine rush, making him happy as never before, but his happiness too, instantly got vanished cause he saw a light almost like a fire glowing through the forest, which seemed very unusual to him. It was almost dark by now, Luke went back to his mates to show them that glowing light, and saw Phil checking the place out with flash light turned on reasoning that Dom and Phil heard something, in that exact moment from nowhere that creature came and took Phil, like he was a piece of cake, within few seconds Phil was disappeared from the spot and could be heard that Phil's flesh is being eaten by the creature killing him instantly.



Luke got so scared that he started running away and because it was dark he accidentally hit a tree making him bleed from the forehead and lie down, as he lied down he found himself in the exact same position and situation that he was in the alcohol shop while Robert was getting killed, he looked back at Robert, lying down and bleeding from his head, he chose to get out of the shop, as he opened the door he saw Phil, Dom and Hutch staring at him, Phil pointed a flash light at Luke and let the flash fall down.



Which made the scene transition to the present moment, Luke was standing in front of the flash light like a statue, after a few seconds he gained consciousness, Luke out of trauma called Phil's name. Luke heard creature's running and guttural sound which made him anxious and scared, while he was pointing his torch light all around the forest he found Dom hiding behind a fallen tree. Luke also hid with him, and asked him, where's Phil despite he saw Phil being taken by the creature with his own eyes, which means his brain couldn't process of what he saw. After a while, Luke told Dom that he might've found a way, but he is afraid that they would have to run, Dom agreed despite his knee was hurt, Luke said on three they would have to run, Luke started the counting and on three they started running, but they had stop because of the creature, cause the creature was making a kind of sound that felt like creature is warning them, that if they run and leave the place they would die. So, they stopped and looked back, and saw that the big deer like creature is actually coming out of the forest, they again ran with anxiety and fear, and got into the path of a small and a very isolated village filled with strange people, they also saw at the beginning of the village's path that Phil is hanged on the tree in the same ritualistic manner. After seeing Phil's body, Dom couldn't control his emotion and started showing his frustration and grief, but they had to run anyway so they kept running. They saw a wooden house and got inside of it, they were tired so they lied on the floor, as they went inside, a person hit both of them making them unconscious. When Luke was woken up by Dom, Luke found, that they both were tied with ropes, and heard a bone chilling sound of that creature which is echoing all over the forest and their head too. Luke made a hole in between woods and tried to saw outside, Luke saw that there were people making something with woods that Luke couldn't understand. There was a table inside the room with some glass bottle upon it, Dom suggested Luke to reach the table, break the glass and cut the ropes, While he was doing that, an old woman came followed by two men, and Luke acted like a prisoner who is not trying to escape. That creepy woman came near Luke and offered him water, Luke politely accepted her offer, cause he knew that if he don't accept the offer, they might do something unwanted thing to him, after Luke drank the water, woman checks Luke's wound on the chest and also showed Luke her chest to let him know that she has the same wounds or holes as Luke's, at the same moment one of the man said something, in unknown language that Luke didn't understand . Woman moved on to Dom, observed him and walked away while ordering those men to take him with them, those men opened his ropes, hit him on the face making him bleed and took him upstairs and did something very suspicious to him, Dom was screaming and begging to let him go, but these people did what they had to be done. Meanwhile a girl came inside the room of Luke and told him that ""they are preparing for the sacrifice. After a while they get Dom back inside with Luke, Dom was full of blood from the face, and seemed he is hurt very badly. Dom started talking about the nightmare he never told Luke about, he saw in his nightmare that these people are offering him to that thing and he also saw his wife, Gayle. Luke tried to give him hope that he won't die here, Dom also told Luke that he is not going to die, as he saw Luke's future in his nightmare too, Dom suggested Luke that when he gets out of this place, he would burn this place to the ground. Dom told Luke to send his message to his wife, Gayle that Dom tried to get back to her. After a while, they took Dom outside and tied him in a wooden pillar offering Dom to that creature, he saw many dead rotten dead bodies being hanged on the trees. Night arrived and we see Luke being desperate and eager to open the ropes and go outside to save Dom. Dom was waiting for his death, while abusing these strange people, meanwhile Luke on the other hand was preparing himself to dislocate his thumb to free himself form the ropes, Dom on the other side heard the the vicious voice of that creature, trees were moving like a thunderstorm is hitting them, by then Luke dislocated his thumb giving him intense pain, he successfully freed himself, Luke heard Dom screaming his wife's name, Gayle. Dom saw his wife coming out of the woods, touching Dom on the cheeks and making eye contact, but then we see that, that wasn't his wife it was that creature, meaning Dom was hallucinating, creature just took Dom in the pitch black woods, Luke saw everything from the hole making him shocked and scared. Creature took Dom and hanged on the trees just like everyone. Everything was silent, Luke was in his mind couldn't process what just happened, that same girl entered the room maybe with the food, she put it on the floor, as she was leaving, Luke asked her that, did they took the body down from the trees, girl said in response, that they don't move bodies cause it's an ancient god, a bastard offspring of Loki, and they worship it, Luke also saw the same holes on her chest as him, Luke responded that he won't live like this, cause he is not like these people, girl said ""you will kneel before it like the rest of us,"" and she left. Luke processed a little bit, stood up and started freeing himself from the ropes, he opened the door and started walking slowly while observing the surroundings, a very deep and vicious voice of someone could be heard like someone is speaking some ritual words, when he reached the door, he saw the same old woman is coming inside, he immediately took the upstairs nearby him, he saw a door, took the burning log and opened it, after gathering all the courage and strength he had, he went inside and discovered several mummified worshippers of that creature, they were part of the cult's ritual, preserved as followers. Those mummified followers started making weird voice and moving a little bit, Luke fired them without any hesitation, the house also started burning up. Luke came downstairs, and saw that creepy old woman standing fearlessly in front of him, Luke immediately knocked her out. When house was burning up we see that the creature is feeling discomfort because of that, everyone in front of that creature kneeled down, but the creature took the girl who warned Luke before, meanwhile Luke took a rifle, reloaded it with bullets, when he was finding his way out of the house a man came in front of him, Luke told him to ""Fuck off"" and Luke pulled the trigger but the gun didn't fire as it was put there for a longtime and not used by anyone, Luke started trying to fix the gun, while man was coming near him, but in that exact moment gun fired killing the man at the spot, he moves ahead and saw a blind man with an axe, Luke warned him to put the axe down, he did the same and then he saw that the creature on the door putting the girl down on the floor, girl had lost her eyes, and for the first time Luke saw that creature from so close, the creature was a mixture of a big deer and human having glowing eyes. Luke ran away, he hit the wooden walls and got outside, and saw that the creature is holding that girl up, Luke aimed and fired at the creature, which made the creature angry starts chasing Luke. Luke started running, but at a point, he stopped because of the fear and confusion, he saw the alcohol shop behind him, and chose to run to that side but he couldn't escape the creature, creature surpassed him, and hit him from the left side, throwing him away in the air, he tried to regain his strength and stood up, looked behind seeing the creature coming for him again, but he kept walking through, creature comes and held Luke lifting him up but then the creature put him down, Luke was surprised and confused to see this, creature lifted his two legs in the air just like when horses lift their two legs, when they are in a defensive or playful mode, and gave a gesture of hand just like Hindu praying style. While Luke was observing this thing, creature showed the dominance to Luke again and demanding submission, while this was happening, Luke get lost in his old memories of Robert for a few seconds but managed to get out of it and took the axe, Luke attacked the creature and started running away, creature chased Luke, but Luke managed to get of the forest and found himself in an open area, completely out of the forest under the light of morning, Luke looked back and saw that the creature is not attempting to come out of the forest's border and chose to stop right there, meaning the creature can't get out of the forest because of his capability limitations, Luke looked at the creature and started screaming, showing his anger and grief. Luke started walking and could see the roads and cars.

# Personal Opinion

To be honest it was a good horror/mystery movie. I really enjoyed watching it, the character's acting was really good, I would give 9.5/10 for their acting, there were times when I was so into the movie, that I could feel the fear, anxiety and confusion that characters were feeling at the moment, creators of this movie has done a great job to make the creature suspicious all along the movie, cause they didn't show the full look of the creature, they were kind of always hiding the creature from the characters, which made the characters question and curious, that what is this thing exactly. overall this was a good movie, and I would like to this give 8/10 to this movie. 3 for the acting, 3 for making suspense at every point of the movie and keeping us engaged, 2 for a good storyline that led them to this situation.",0,1732266235.0,movies,7,0.1,False

Here‚Äôs the kicker‚Äîno motion designer sticks to just one software. You‚Äôll find yourself bouncing between After Effects for animation, Blender for modeling, and Premiere Pro for editing like it‚Äôs some kind of creative relay race. The secret sauce? Knowing which tool to use and when.

Hearing how much better people feel after quitting really gave me that extra push I needed to commit to this for myself.

I started using Zyns after I wrecked my lungs from vaping. I was one of those kids who got messed up by it‚Äîpuff bars every day until my lungs were wheezing so badly I had to go on steroids. Even now, I can‚Äôt take one puff of a vape without my throat and lungs hurting. So, Zyns felt like the perfect alternative‚Äîa new way to get nicotine and, of course, start another addiction.

Fast forward four years, and I‚Äôve been doing Zyns consistently. I‚Äôve tried quitting so many times, but I never stuck with it. Deep down, you kind of know whether you‚Äôre ready to quit, and for me, I wasn‚Äôt. I‚Äôd stop for a couple of months, feel proud, and then tell myself, ‚ÄúJust for this weekend in Vegas.‚Äù Next thing I knew, I was back to four cans a week of 6mg Zyns, all day, every day.

**Why I Want to Quit**  
The main reason I‚Äôm quitting is I can see how much Zyns hold me back. I‚Äôve told myself they help me focus on school, but really, I just end up mindlessly scrolling TikTok or playing video games. I run my own business as an independent contractor, and I‚Äôve got a lot to do‚Äîbut I seriously lack the discipline and motivation to follow through. I can trace so many issues back to Zyns: inconsistent workouts, bad sleep, anxiety, stomach issues, cloudy thinking, bad memory, unhealthy eating, and so much more.

I‚Äôm not saying I‚Äôm lazy‚ÄîI‚Äôm aware of my pitfalls, and I want more for myself. I want to be my best self: healthy, happy, and living a life I‚Äôm proud of.

**The Day I Quit**  
I quit on November 12. That day, I was eating a Big Mac in the parking lot of my school, and I just felt this overwhelming disgust with myself. It didn‚Äôt even taste good. I looked at my life and thought,¬†*What am I doing?*¬†Right after, I put in a Zyn, and that was it. I decided no more. That night, I threw away three full cans of Zyns and all the loose ones I had stashed in drawers. I made sure there was nothing left to tempt me.

It‚Äôs been 10 days now, and I feel amazing. I‚Äôve been to the gym four times since quitting, and I‚Äôve kept up with my men‚Äôs league softball. I even quit coffee the same day (I‚Äôd become a daily coffee drinker in the past three months), so I dealt with withdrawals from both at once.

**The First Few Days**  
The first two days were rough‚Äîmy head felt cloudy, and I was super irritable, especially with my girlfriend. I felt bad for snapping at her, but I‚Äôve been trying to make up for it.

What really helped me was sour candy. Warheads were a lifesaver for curbing the headaches and cravings, though my mouth was wrecked from eating so many!

I also started reading again, and I‚Äôm working through¬†*Atomic Habits*¬†by James Clear. I can‚Äôt recommend this book enough‚Äîit‚Äôs been a game-changer. One key takeaway for me is to stop thinking of myself as someone who‚Äôs ‚Äúquitting Zyns.‚Äù Instead, I‚Äôve started identifying as someone who simply¬†*doesn‚Äôt do Zyns*. It‚Äôs such a subtle mindset shift, but it‚Äôs powerful.

**Moving Forward**  
I‚Äôm sharing my story because I know how much reading others‚Äô experiences helped me, and I hope mine can do the same for someone else. If you‚Äôve read this far, thank you! Feel free to ask me anything‚ÄîI‚Äôll keep posting updates as I go. Here‚Äôs to being better, one day at a time.",1,1732265342.0,QuittingZyn,0,1.0,False

**a. Burr Size**

When we talk about a ""Xmm conical burr,"" we‚Äôre referring to the diameter of the outer burr. But the more critical parameter is the inner burr's diameter and height. Larger conical burrs have thicker outer edges that don‚Äôt take part in grind; they‚Äôre just there to fit larger screws to fix the outer burr in an electric grinder.

https://preview.redd.it/8x9fz6ze1f2e1.jpg?width=1778&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=f29fc2d32a52d9f75aa94495bd373e99aff4732f

**b. Particle Size Distribution of Conical Burrs**

Compared to flat burrs, conical burrs produce a more comprehensive range of particle sizes. We can break the coffee ground output from a grinder into three parts: Target-Powder, Coarse-Powder, and Fine-Powder (including extra-fine). Generally, conical burrs will have a lower proportion of Target-Powder compared to flat burrs.

For example, using medium-roast beans in pour-over, my ideal benchmark is: 50% of particles between 400-850¬µm (Target-Powder), 15% of finer than 400¬µm (Fine-Powder), and 30% of coarser than 850¬µm (Coarse-Powder). For filter coffee brewing, too much fine powder (over 15%) can taste bitter or woody, while excessive coarse powder (over 30%) can cause hollow or sharp sourness.

https://preview.redd.it/94dpga3g1f2e1.jpg?width=1778&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=f910a16a5d1ee4e4231b0245e596977ecad3a26e

Generally, flat burrs tend to have a more uniform particle size distribution that fits into this ideal benchmark more easily. but high-quality conical burrs have capable of keeping more than 50% of particles within Target-Powder (400-850¬µm), making pour-over brewing easier and the taste more balanced.

**c. Flavor Profile of Conical Burrs**

Compared to flat burrs, conical burrs have wider particle size distribution and a more three-dimensional shape, creating a dense coffee puck that provides good resistance during espresso and filter extraction. This results in a high strength, rich body, and sweet flavor.

The burr is the heart of a manual grinder. My idea was to design an innovative conical burr to overcome any limitations (handheld grinder hardware constraints, user comfort, and ease of operation) while making coffee brewing simpler and tastier.

The attached link is my log of the design of the GRIZZ 63mm conical burr manual coffee grinder. I hope you find it helpful!

For our front-end we decided to go with:

\- SwiftUI (native felt the best, however we have many android users as well and unsure if RN would have been the better option for now)

\- Third Party Libs that render Markdown (https://github.com/gonzalezreal/swift-markdown-ui) 

  
For our backend we decided to use:

\- Express JS and a custom auth system

\- Neon Postgres for branching different databases (good for dev + testing purposes)

\- Custom GPUs and Whisper Model adjusted to our needs with speaker diarization which runs on Runpod



I hope I didn't forget anything. Let me know if you have any questions! :)

The tables provided illustrate data about sales of two different products in five distinct countries in 1999 and 2004.

Overall, all of the five countries increased their income from coffee sales over the period of 5 years. By contrast, banana sales in Sweden and Denmark decreased notably over the period shown.

First of all, the UK average got the highest revenue from coffee sales among 5 countries and it increased by more than 10 times from 1999 to 2004, reaching 20 million. On the other hand, the lowest income from coffee sales was observed in Sweden with 800 thousand and 1 million in 1999 and 2004, respectively. Meanwhile, the coffee sales in Switzerland saw a considerable increase of 100% by 2004.

With regard to the country that got the highest revenue from banana sales, Switzerland earned 15 million in 1999, before increasing their income by roughly 3 times. By contrast, banana sales in Sweden and Denmark decreased notably and totaled only 1.9 million, collectively. Finally, the UK and Belgium increased their income from bananas by approximately 5 and 3 times.

No, she‚Äôs great, but if I bring up any issue I might be having she takes it as a free pass to throw the fact that I‚Äôm still on a medication that SHE doesn‚Äôt approve of. If I‚Äôm being honest she‚Äôs ultimately right, I‚Äôve been taking it for much longer that expected and I do actually feel a benefit from it if I‚Äôm being totally honest. I‚Äôve been taking the same 4 meds for YEARS! Like well over 10yrs and she will use any weakness in my armor to push that lit match up under the backside of my armor! üî• 
I‚Äôve never had constipation issues on the past. I was pretty routine, every other morning, a few sips of my hot coffee and clear me a path brother! And I‚Äôm an old-skool shitter, I like to spend a decent 45mins in there. I just have to or I won‚Äôt feel right. Well over the past year or so this has stopped for me. Guys I will sometimes go into a week and a 1/2 before I‚Äôm duecing. And worst of all, this ‚Äúduceing‚Äù is NOT normal! In all seriousness in the past year I‚Äôve probably had about 10(the most recent was the worst) sessions where I slid 1-2-3 suppositories in there, I‚Äôve waited them out to no avail, eventually just the combo of my stomach cramping me down to one knee, sitting, gently pushing on my belly (I‚Äôm a little overweight 2XL) , then standing over the toilet towards the end pushing with the force I watched my dear wife push having 4 of my children! I‚Äôll feel it about to crown/but I‚Äôll also feel there‚Äôs no way I can sustain this effort any longer without passing out from Alabama. So the last 3 or so have been next -level for me. I felt like they were SO compacted, SO long, and I‚Äôve clogged the toilet EVERTIME.
 My diet sucks. Lots of glazed donuts(daily at workü§¶‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è), not much excitement around my wife‚Äôs awesome suppers she makes because I‚Äôm already looking forward to my movie snack of frozen Twix each night. I drink Diet Coke all day. I have some OCD, blah blah blah, some anxiety, blah blah blah, and I stress but so does my frigin‚Äô wife. EVERYBODY has something I tell her and my kids. I‚Äôm ok with my little quirks but it sucks  when they present this to me! I mean I‚Äôm standing up, backward over the toilet pushing as hard as I can because I feel like I HAVE to have this out or else. The thing is is I‚Äôve kinda always eaten like crap at break time! Donuts, bagels and what not. And I‚Äôve always been a sucker for a late night dynamo of an ice cream. It‚Äôs just in this past year I‚Äôve paid for it. Will a fiber supplement REALLY help? And I know, the donuts have to stop right? I‚Äôm prepping myself for that. Hopefully adding fiber to my diet will help? But I told my buddy I snack on C&iff Bars alot of night. I‚Äôll have about 3-4. He said that‚Äôs worsening the problem and probably binding me up more! I‚Äôm lost. I know this was long, and all over the place and probably was carved up with mistakes but I‚Äôm seriously looking for a little gift here please. üôè Thank You  for your time if you hung in there man.

I don't want to waste my current fit right now so I am looking for someone to spend my Friday night with to avoid crashing out. Feeling a bit spontaneous right now so I'm planning to get dinner somewhere in Makati/BGC/Pasig and maybe coffee after. Open to any food/drink suggestions as well!

Some stuff about me:
- 26 from the South (Specifically in Para√±aque)
- Working professional whose office is in QC (RIP)
- I have the Asian flush so I'm trying to avoid getting alcoholic drinks (unless it's a chill/light drinking session)
- Interests are going to the gym (when I can), playing games mostly on PC (waiting for the Steam Autumn Sale), and reading books (currently reading World War Z)
- Yapper with the right people

About you:
- Age gap shouldn't be as significant
- Pleasing personality
- Doesn't mind meeting at the place (wherever that is)
- Looks are subjective so we can exchange pics to see if there's any physical attraction between each other

So yeah, just hit me up! ü•¥

Bought a Darkglass Infinity 500W combo, but am already questioning if I should‚Äôve gotten my original dream GR Bass Ultralight 800W instead. 

I‚Äôm not a pro player, I play for myself and for the joy of it. Would like to join a band at some point, so I‚Äôve been saving up for a while to get me a proper bass amp. 


Bought the Darkglass Infinity 500 combo. Lots of bells and whistles, app-integration (if it works well, it‚Äôs usually quite fun) and it also sounds pretty good. 2X10‚Äù Eminence woofers and a tweeter. Pre effects direct out AND a Post effects direct out, for some sweet dry/wet blending when recording or for gigging. 


BUT! 

I‚Äôve been in awe of the GR Bass 800W Ultralight combo for the longest time, mainly for it‚Äôs sound; it‚Äôs sooo dry and pleasant, and has a kind of ‚Äòcardboard‚Äô-like quality, that I just simply find heavenly. Absolutely heavenly. 
It‚Äôs a 1X12‚Äù custom Jensen (I think) speaker and tweeter. No modelling/amp sims on this one, rather a seemingly great preamp with great EQ and tonal control. 


I made the impulse buy, on a lack of sleep and coffee, while having major GAS. Now I‚Äôm second guessing it, and already thinking of writing thomann to tell them that I won‚Äôt be picking up the amp from the post office, so that it can be sent back to them, and that I‚Äôll instead order the GR Bass combo. 

I can‚Äôt afford to own more than one amp atm, but I do have enough to order the GR bass combo as well, and then try them out, side by side, and send back the one that doesn‚Äôt suit me. I‚Äôm irrationally afraid of Thomann not accepting a return/refund, although they‚Äôve always come through with other (much cheaper and different) gear. 


What do you think about these two combos? 
Pros and cons?
