I took it out of the moving box and messed with it today, to confirm the largest size it could go to, then washed my hands with scented soap, and I can still smell the transferred reek on my hands.

It is a very thin fabric-ish layer over a hard plastic shell, so not able to pin into it, but there is still some textile content, and I have a feeling that even the plastic has picked up the bad smell.  

Is there any way to de-stink it?  Douse it with vinegar, scrub it, rinse well, and dry in the sun?  Scrub with a baking soda paste?  Scrub with coffee grounds and then clean?

Some time ago, I conducted an in-depth interview with a friend about the coffee shop consumption habits of 75 people — plus one coffee shop owner. After a careful analysis, we discovered that there’s a group of customers who are not being well served. This group connects somewhat with the **co-working** space concept while also being attracted to the **coffee shop** environment.

I don’t usually have dreams like this.

It wasn’t a super long dream really, and it wasn’t necessarily complex either… I was in my childhood home, which brings up some anxiety, but nothing specific I can pinpoint. A lot of bad stuff happened there. The main thing though is I was being chased/hunted by an overwhelming variety of FNaF characters. I started off fairly well, I knew how to avoid them, and I knew all the good hiding places. The dream featured some vents in between rooms I could crawl through, and a complex vent system though lol… if you ever played five nights hunted on Roblox, it was exactly those vents, just with an added vent system in some of them. 

I remember a huge focus was sound; I was trying to avoid alerting them by being noisy. I ended up making a mistake, however, and thought I could distract them by turning on the shower and hiding in the vents… as soon as I did, and started crawling in the vents, there was a red “killer radius” DBD style RIGHT in front of me, and I had to bail. But it was too late. Not sure if it matters, but the specific animatronic here was nightmare foxy, who I’ve never been particularly scared of in my waking life. Actually, I don’t have strong opinions on him at all LOL

Foxy chased me through the bathroom vents down the hallway and into the living room, where I realized I would not be making it out of this. He was too fast and I was running out of places to go, so, I sort of… gave up? I knew I couldn’t hide or run anymore so I jumped up from where I was using the coffee table as an island to circle him, and screamed at him haha. I died and woke up 🤔

Maybe it’s not worth mentioning, but I don’t normally have FNaF related dreams, and when I do it’s always been a nightmare. WHICH SOUNDS NORMAL cuz it’s a HORROR game, but FNaF hasn’t scared me since it came out, and it’s a huge staple in my interests. I love FNaF, so it’s strange to me that my dreams about it are both rare, and only negative.",1,1762351494.0,Dreams,0,1.0,False

Not because I’m lonely. Not because I’m desperate to be chosen. But because something in me knows you’ll be worth the wait.

I’ve thought about you more times than I’ll ever admit. Not the fantasy of you, but the real you. The one who overthinks sometimes, who tries to look fine even when his world feels heavy, who carries so much but still finds a way to be kind.

I imagine the way your eyes will soften when you talk about something you care about. The way you’ll pause before saying something honest. The way you’ll pull away when you’re unsure if love still feels safe.

And I just want you to know, when that happens, I’ll see it.  
I’ll see you.  
And I’ll stay.

Because I’ve learned that love isn’t about chasing perfection. It’s about choosing someone real. Someone human. Someone like you.

I don’t want the version of you who feels the need to be strong all the time. I want the you who sighs when he’s tired, who gets quiet when he’s thinking, who’s scared to hope again but does it anyway.

Bring me your silences, your uncertainties, your edges. Bring me the stories you’ve never had the courage to tell. I won’t flinch.

One day, we’ll be standing side by side, maybe laughing about something small,  
or sitting in traffic with music playing, and I’ll look at you and know.  
That’s him.  
That’s the one I’ve been writing to all this time.

I don’t want grand gestures. I want peace. I want honesty. I want someone who shows up on the hard days and says, ""I’m here"".

I’ll love you like that.  
Steady. Real. Without games.  
The kind of love that feels like exhaling after holding your breath too long.

And when you finally let me in, when you tell me about the things that broke you,  
I promise I won’t run.  
I’ll listen.  
I’ll stay.  
And I’ll treat your heart like something sacred.

I think about mornings with you sometimes. Nothing fancy, just you in the half-light, your hair a little messy, your voice still rough with sleep. You’ll be making coffee, and I’ll be watching you from the doorway, thinking, *so this is what it feels like to be home.*

I want all of it. The quiet, the storms, the rebuilding. Because love isn’t always easy, but the right kind is always worth it.

Wherever you are, I hope this reaches you. I hope you feel something stir, a small reminder that someone out here is waiting for you, not to fix her, not to save her, but to walk beside her.

I’ve been tending to my heart, healing the pieces I used to hide, so that when you finally arrive, I can meet you whole.

I am ready.  
Not perfect, but open.  
Not waiting to be rescued,  
but ready to build something real with you.

And when I love you,  
you’ll know.  
Because it will feel like I’ve loved you in every lifetime before this one.

So take your time.  
But don’t be afraid.

Because when we finally meet, you’ll be the prayer I never stopped whispering, and I’ll be the answer you didn’t know you were still allowed to believe in.",4,1762351433.0,PinoyUnsentLetters,1,1.0,False

our daily grind? making sure it doesn’t explode.

* connecting Power BI with SQL, Fabric, APIs, and the occasional ancient Oracle that refuses to die

between us we’ve spent over 15 years designing, tuning, and scaling BI environments - from one-person Power BI setups to global architectures. we’ve broken plenty along the way, learned even more, and occasionally fixed things before anyone noticed.

ask us anything:

* performance tuning & optimization  
* semantic model design at scale  
* refresh, capacity & deployment strategy  
* dataflows, Fabric, or workspace chaos

While I find it easy to side step personal questions from people beneath me - how do you politely but effectively shut down personal questions from superiors? 

I have been burned in the past from sharing personal info and then having it used against me in a professional setting so I am unwilling to change my stance on being mum. But I also don't want her to get angry and go to her colleagues and tell them they made a mistake in hiring me. Any thoughts or tips?

Thank

1op3ihj,https://i.redd.it/32q2abh32gzf1.png,Pumpkin Streusel Muffins: Irresistible and Easy Recipe,"It’s officially fall, and I couldn’t resist diving into some cozy baking! I had a can of pumpkin puree in the pantry and wanted to make something warm, spiced, and with a little crunch on top—that’s how these Pumpkin Streusel Muffins came about. They’re perfect for breakfast, dessert, or even a midday snack with coffee. If you love pumpkin muffin recipes as much as I do, you’ll want to try this one out. I wrote down the full steps here: [https://www.amgroyal.com/pumpkin-streusel-muffins-recipe](https://www.amgroyal.com/pumpkin-streusel-muffins-recipe)  
  
Here’s what you’ll need to make these fall muffins:  
  
1 3/4 cups all-purpose flour  
1 cup granulated sugar  
1/2 cup brown sugar  
1 tsp baking soda  
1/2 tsp salt  
2 tsp pumpkin pie spice (or mix cinnamon, nutmeg, and cloves)  
2 large eggs  
1 cup canned pumpkin puree (not pumpkin pie filling)  
1/2 cup vegetable oil (or melted coconut oil)  
1/4 cup milk (any kind will work)  
  
For the streusel topping:  
1/2 cup all-purpose flour  
1/4 cup brown sugar  
1/2 tsp cinnamon  
3 tbsp softened butter  
  
1. Preheat your oven to 375°F and line a 12-cup muffin tin with paper liners. This makes cleanup easier and keeps the muffins from sticking.  
2. In a large bowl, whisk together the flour, granulated sugar, brown sugar, baking soda, salt, and pumpkin pie spice. This will be your dry mixture.  
3. In another bowl, mix the eggs, pumpkin puree, vegetable oil, and milk until smooth.  
4. Pour the wet ingredients into the dry ingredients and gently fold until just combined. Be careful not to overmix it’s okay if the batter looks a bit lumpy.  
5. Divide the batter evenly into your lined muffin cups, filling each about 3/4 full.  
6. To make the streusel, combine the flour, brown sugar, and cinnamon in a small bowl. Add the softened butter and use a fork (or your fingers) to mix until you get a crumbly texture. Sprinkle the streusel generously over each muffin.  
7. Bake for 18–22 minutes, or until a toothpick inserted into the center of a muffin comes out clean. Let them cool for 10 minutes in the tin before transferring them to a wire rack.  
  
A few quick tips:  
\- If you don’t have pumpkin pie spice, just use 1 tsp cinnamon, 1/4 tsp nutmeg, and 1/4 tsp cloves.  
\- These are best enjoyed fresh but can be stored in an airtight container at room temperature for up to 3 days. Reheat them for a few seconds in the microwave for that just-baked vibe.  
\- Looking for something a little different? Try adding chopped pecans or a handful of chocolate chips to the batter before baking.  
  
What’s your go-to fall baking project? Do you stick with pumpkin desserts like these or go for apple streusel muffins or pumpkin apple muffins? Let me know I’m always looking for new ideas!",1,1762350939.0,yummyrecipesyum,0,1.0,False

I tapped my fingers on the coffee table while watching the blue circle on the screen go round and round. 3, 2, 1...


Download complete.


I've bee wanting to use this app for a little while. I came across it while doomscrolling on the app store - which could be considered a new personal low. It's kind of like those prediction apps, you enter your name and it's supposed to tell you when you are going to die.


I clicked ""Open.""


The screen turned black, and later a text appeared in red letters and very sharp fornt, kinda reminded me of horror movies (or maybe some death metal bands). Final Countdown. That was the app name.


""Seems innocent enough. Just a random choice calculator"", I thought to myself.


I hit start. The next page loaded a white box with writing above it: ""Please enter your FULL name (e.g. Samantha Brownshoe).""


I typed my name in the box. My fingers trembled with adrenaline as I prepared to hit the button.


And then the notification came:


TIME REMAINING: LESS THAN 24 HOURS


I paused for a second. I was expecting some shit like 75 years or so, but oh well. Let's give it another go. So I did. I went back to the main menu. Start. Entered my name. Waited.


Same response.


LESS THAN 24 HOURS


Huh. I guess it's one of those generators that only spits one answer to each user. Unlucky I guess.


I left the house to go run some errands. The traffic was unbearable, so I decided to take a shortcut into an alley, thinking I'd be done much faster. 


I was driving in peace for a while, when the sound of a horn penetrated my skull. I swear I have never slammed on the breaks so fast before. 


""Dude, are you fucking serious?""


On my right, I saw a man exit his vehicle and march towards me, murmuring and spitting curses all along. I couldn't understand what he was talking about, I started looking around the street trying to figure out what was happening.


I had missed a stop sign.


And I still cannot, for the life of me, remember how that happened. The only thing I clearly remember, is the man's last words, that made my blood run cold. 


""The way you drive, you're gonna be dead in less than twenty four hous, asshole! And I sure as hell don't want to go to jail for someone like you!""


Less. Than. Twenty-four. Hours.


With trembling hands, I pulled over and immediately opened my phone. The coutdown was still the same, but there was a new footnote at the bottom:


Dodged death: 1/2


I felt my heart beating in my throat. I didn't know what to think. My better judgment told me this is stupid, that it's just an app. But my gut was screaming that something was wrong.


What does 1/2 mean? What's going to happen after 2 times?...


I parked the car and decided to walk the rest of the way, so I could take my mind off of things. The more time passed, the more this app started to get in my head. I kept checking over and over. 19 hours, 18, 17... 


By the time I returned, I felt I was completely loosing my mind. The whole ride home, I kept walking past signs of the kind ""live every day like it's your last"". Even the cashier at the grocery store seemed off. She never once took her eyes off me while scanning the products, and had this god awful grin on her face, spreading from ear to ear. 


I threw my sack of bones of a body on the couch and turned on the TV, in a final attempt to unwind and clear my head. 


But, of course, that wasn't even close to what happened. 


""Ladies and gentlemen, we are interrupting our usual programming to announce an emergency broadcast. A robbery has taken place at a local grocery store, and has left behind a number of victims.""


My eyes opened so wide they nearly fell out of my sockets.


That was the store I was just in.


""The culprit has not yet been arrested, and security footage from the store does not provide with a clear image for identification.""


The sound of a notification made me jump. 


App: You have 1 new notification.


I was begging and praying it wouldn't be what I thought. 


Dodged death: 2/2


My knees gave in. I sat in silence for moments thay felt like an eternity, unable to think or act in any way. I wanted to run, but there was nowhere to go. How do you escape death?


Now I sit here writing this, after someone knocked on my door just a second ago. Three slow, steady knocks, and a sense of impending doom lingering in the air. There's someone out there, waiting for me. Maybe if I stay inside, I can escape. Maybe if I don't answer the door, he will get tired and leave, and the countdown will stop.

Maybe I can escape.


But maybe I can't. 


I'm feeling sicker as the time goes by.

Hi, I’m Bonnie, Im 25, black female, 5’5 | 105lbs, and if I were to describe myself in one word, it would probably be “soft,” though that’s just the beginning. I’m someone who finds joy and comfort in the small, delicate details of life, the things that make each day feel intentional and a little bit magical. I adore quiet, cozy spaces like small cafés and bakeries, wandering through little shops with hidden treasures, or simply enjoying a bouquet of flowers that catches my eye. I love the tactile, comforting things that make the world feel gentle: soft cardigans, stuffed animals, comfort shows/movies, bows and hair clips that add a playful feminine touch, and little strawberry-themed surprises that bring a smile. I notice the details, the subtleties, and the moments that many people might overlook, and I think that’s part of my charm.

At the same time, I have a small, wild streak. I love activity, adventure, and new experiences that let me feel alive. Roller coasters, museums, science exhibits, hiking, and exploring are all things that make my heart race with excitement. I’m not interested in the typical “dinner, coffee, or movie” dates; I crave experiences that are interactive and engaging, where we can genuinely connect and share energy. I love movement and spontaneity as much as I love stillness and quiet reflection, and I think the balance between those sides of me makes life richer.

I take boundaries, comfort, and consent very seriously. For me, a relationship is about trust, mutual respect, and emotional safety. I am not here for casual texting or low-effort planning or even the “lets see where things go” energy; I want someone who is thoughtful, intentional, and willing to invest the time and energy it takes to build something meaningful. Communication matters deeply to me, and I appreciate partners who are clear, considerate, and confident in themselves. I believe that love and connection flourish when both people are genuinely present, attentive, and willing to put in effort. However with that i am looking for a long term relationship but not ready for marriage or ready to have children, i love being CF (Child Free) and that is really important to me, i value my freedom and not being tied down daily having to take care of a small human. I believe it is possible to want a committed relationship but not be ready to settle down; Sometimes, two people simply share a meaningful connection, whether it lasts a few years or just a beautiful chapter. There’s something deeply romantic about two separate lives intertwining for a time before continuing their own paths.

I consider myself naturally soft and quiet. I’m drawn to men who are confident, Dominate, grounded, and know how to lead with care and thoughtfulness. I’m not interested in bottom men (or men with mommy issues. I do not have daddy issues myself) or those who expect me to take control; I feel most fulfilled when I can relax into softness and trust someone to guide our relationship down the right path and ofc with my help so we can grow together. For me, softness isn’t about weakness, it’s about connection, trust, and intimacy. The most romantic and meaningful relationships I can imagine are ones where I feel safe enough to let go, be soft, and explore the full range of my emotions and desires without fear or judgment or being used.

When it comes to who I’m attracted to, I tend to gravitate toward single men who are East/Southeast Asian, or white, latino and don’t have children (100% Childfree). Non-Smoker/vaper but drinking is fine just dont be an alcoholic (been through that). No crazy Exes. Aged 26-40(no one older or younger). Permanently living in Orlando, FL (Very important, I am NOT open to long distance/Online). Knows how to dress and basic hygiene. Knows how to have a conversation aka won’t leave me to ask all the question or say “feel free to ask me questions” when none have been asked of me. Loves theme parks and movies. Have self control, self respect and discipline. Have hair on their head (no baldness but a buzzcut is fine). Emotional intelligent/mature. Confidence is key! I admire someone who knows themselves, is comfortable in their own skin, and carries themselves with self-assurance. I appreciate a partner who prioritizes health, whether that’s staying active, eating thoughtfully, or simply taking care of their well-being. I prefer men who are fit, slim, or average in body type(noone obese), someone whose lifestyle complements mine without pressure or judgment. Height isn’t everything, but I’m drawn to men who are taller and carry themselves in a way that inspires quiet confidence and stability, height is not a dealbreaker though I have dated men who have at least been 5’7. I’m most comfortable when I’m with someone kind, protective, and intentional. I bring loyalty, affection, and steadiness, I just need to feel safe and chosen first. I would say i have an average/slim body,  but to clear up that im not the average-overweight pipeline, im 105lbs.

I love a lifestyle that feels mature, grounded, and intentional. I enjoy healthy routines, cooking at home, and staying active walking, or home workouts. I value thoughtful living, where every choice, big or small; reflects care for yourself and those around you. For me, little things matter: the scent of fresh flowers, the comfort of a soft cardigan on a rainy day, the quiet thrill of discovering something new in a museum, or the tactile satisfaction of a small DIY project. Life feels richer when you notice the details, and I take joy in these moments every day.

Romance, for me, is soft, tender, and deeply intentional. I crave connection that’s playful yet grounded, adventurous yet comforting. I love giving and receiving affection, cherishing moments where we can simply be together without distraction. My ideal partner values these things too: someone who can plan thoughtful, activity-based dates, who enjoys shared experiences rather than just passive moments, and who delights in the simple but meaningful gestures that show care. I want a relationship where laughter, exploration, and softness are all woven together, a life that feels full and alive while still honoring calm, gentle moments.

 I want to build a relationship that’s focused and intentional from the start. I’m looking for someone who can embrace both the playful and serene sides of life, who understands that romance doesn’t need to be loud or flashy to feel profound. I value someone who can lead with strength but also sensitivity, someone who can take initiative in planning our time together while respecting my boundaries and comfort. I want a partner who sees the beauty in both quiet moments and bursts of adventure, someone who can make almost everyday life feel like something special.

There’s a balance in me that I hope to share with the right person. Together, I imagine a relationship that’s warm, exciting, and deeply connected: moments of quiet reflection curled up together, intertwined with spontaneous adventures that make us feel alive. I am a spiritually grounded Catholic and love my calm soft faith, i dont force my religion upon anyone and i dont even talk about it to avoid making people uncomfortable. It doesnt matter to me what religion or spirituality you are just come with acceptance and peace. I am LGBTQ+ friendly and myself is Pansexual. However i do not support the poly/enm/open lifestyle when it comes to my relationships. I dont smoke or drink. I have a chronic illness and take care of myself to make sure my health stays in check. I am not into hookup culture (fwb, ons, play partner, etc) but have tried it out before realizing and talking to my therapist that it is not for me and something i dont enjoy and not comfortable with. I take my mental health very seriously and let go of anything that will cause me great stress or put me in a negative mindset. 

I have healed through my trauma and continue to heal far beyond, i want my partner to also prioritize their mental health and can communicate their thoughts and feelings for anything good or bad, i hear and see my partner and make sure to provide my support and feedback, even in disagreements. I would consider myself slightly traditional in relationships following behind my partner and keeping quiet when needed (i do have rules/boundaries myself and dont tolerate any type of disrespect to my character). I would not consider myself a feminist however i do applaud the efforts and the ways things go by and how i would not be able to do the things i do now without feminism. I still believe in equal rights for all not only one type of person. I am not a liberal or conservative and consider myself of the far left and moderate but to be safe on dating apps i do label myself as liberal. I prefer to date someone who is moderate/left and also not a conservative/liberal. I enjoy gloomy weather, slice of life anime’s, horror movies, journaling, shopping, nature, animals, dressing very dolly and/or comfortable, and collecting stuffed animals (no squishmellows). I own a cat and dog and live with roommates. I dont drive as i dont meet florida requirements for a DL (passenger princess). I play video games (PS 4/5). I enjoy also dressing modest/alt/punk, a small bit of baking and naps. Im prochoice. And i dream of moving to the PNW and opening up a bakery and having my own greenhouse vegetable and fruit garden in the backyard hehe. I like listening to nu-metal/rock, mitski and Billie eilish. I am not a fan of RnB/hip hop music but I did grow up listening to it. I have Autism and adhd. I work Full Time. Free Palestine, congo, and sudan.

I want someone who understands that relationships take effort and attention from both sides, and who is willing to create a connection built on trust, playfulness, and connection. I want a partner who can inspire me, challenge me gently, and hold space for me while allowing me to be my full, authentic self. And i do the same for them. However we must agree that neither of us are eachother therapist/psychologist and should not put mental pressure/stress on eachother to solve our own problems. We are not eachother caretaker, lets not romanticize emotional labor. Confusing love with responsibility for someones else growth is not the way to go, its unhealthy.

If you’re someone who enjoys activity-based adventures, who values thoughtful planning, and who appreciates both softness and subtle sparks of wildness, we might just click. I’m looking for someone confident, grounded, and intentional; someone who respects boundaries, takes comfort seriously, and understands that love is nurtured through care and presence. With the right person, I imagine a life full of warmth, trust, laughter, and connection, moments where we explore the world together, savor the quiet times, and let the soft, tender side of life bloom fully.

Two weeks ago, I posted a Fruits Party invite in this sub and got so many upvotes! We quickly held two small sessions.

We wanted to share what happened and invite you to our future events!



**The idea is simple:** China has an insane variety of cheap, amazing fruits. But for expats, it can be confusing—what are they, and how do you pick the good ones? Honestly, it's a bit of a mess, even locals find it tricky.

So, every week we pick 6-8 seasonal fruits from across China. Many are unique varieties you won't see in regular stores.

We think it's a cool, natural way to learn about China through its produce. We share a bit about the origin of each fruit.



We also introduced some uniquely Chinese ways to eat fruit, like:

* Avocado with soy sauce (weird but delicious!)
* A dessert made from pomelo, yogurt, and green wheat berries
* Guava with sour plum powder — a total classic here
* Warm wild pear soup, traditionally drunk in autumn to soothe your throat

We've had great feedback from 50+ local events, but our ""expat"" sessions revealed something extra special:



**On making friends:**  
At our first event, we had a couple who'd worked and traveled in China for years, and students who'd just arrived. The new students spent the whole afternoon asking the veterans for life advice. They kept chatting and swapped WeChats long after it ended!

The second event had a mix of Chinese and foreigners. It was really cool to see people helping with translations. It felt like a genuine, low-key way to connect and learn.



**On fruit knowledge:**  
People loved hearing the little stories behind each fruit — the kind of stuff most vendors don't know (or just don't share). We even produce China's only fruit podcast, chatting with growers (sadly, no English version though!).



**Invite you to join**

We host weekly, now alternating between Chinese & English sessions.

If you're interested, just add us on WeChat to see dates and sign up.

Just here for fruit tips? We're happy to give recommendations too!

  
It's 69 RMB, which includes:

* A coffee/tea
* All-you-can-eat fruit
* A small bag of fruit to take home

Come hang out, try some amazing fruit, and maybe make a new friend!",5,1762350725.0,shanghai,2,1.0,False

I’m a first time poster and I don’t know what exactly I’m asking for. I just feel trapped and lost and at my wit’s end. I don’t know what to do. I (29 F) am the Assistant Night Auditor at a hotel very famous in my home town. While it’s not what I want to do forever, it is a decent job. Yeah overnight isn’t fun but it is quiet, I don’t have a boss over my head, and I do get to help people, which I do enjoy. I like the job and my boss is good to me and the people are to. Just one problem: the hotel’s owner who is causing me a lot of emotional and mental turmoil. You see, he comes in every morning at around 4:30-5. My custodian, the only other person with me at night, have to set up the hotel for him in the morning. Heat on full blast, newspapers ready,  coffee with milk and cream and the report I do at the end of the night after I calculate the numbers. Simple right? No actually because the owner, (88 M) (yeah you read that right) acts like a spoiled brat and a five year old when anything in this. He’s often verbally harassed myself and my custodian friend over very trivial matters. From the heat not being up all the way, to the coffee machine not being fixed even when we filed an order, to the newspapers not being delivered even when we have no control over that, or this morning where he yelled at me for not having the milk carton open enough for him. And it would be one thing if it was just him politely asking to fix it. No. He doesn’t do that. He comes over to us in full battle mode and yelling. He often gets in both of our faces with his finger as he scolds us as if it helps prove his point. He’s just incredibly cruel and mean and a bully. Whenever I’ve reported this to my boss and the GM, they often tell me to not take it personally or the GM’s constant he treats everyone like that, as if it’s supposed to help me feel better. 

Now I’m not here to claim I’m a perfect human being. I’m not. But at the same time, my boss not the owner, whenever I do make a mistake, she’s not overly cruel and just lets me know so I can fix it. The old man does none of that. He will often yell and scream like a toddler trapped in an 80 plus year old body whenever anything isn’t in place. And it doesn’t help that his kids who take him in every day at 4 or 5 am just stand there and let us endure it. 

It honestly feels like being expected to being hit every time he’s around the corner or coming to talk to me. For those of you who have seen Parks and Recs, him coming is basically the same as Ron Swanson sensing his second ex wife Tammy 2 coming around the corner. He’s that bad. 

I’ve been documenting as much as I can of these incidents. Not all but the worst ones. Just so I can remind myself what’s going on. I just feel like I can’t do this job anymore. He’s the only thing that makes this thing feel unbearable and I feel so unbelievably defeated when it comes to him. I feel like I’ve tried everything I can. Any advice would be greatly appreciated.

Not very good at describing myself, but a brief overview:
- 5'3, slim, medium hair length
- Infj, emotionally available (note: I do take some time to warm up to new people) 
- Loves coffee and a good cocktail from time to time!Also a foodie hehe
- Has tatts, but placed on where people can't easily see them
- Studying my postgrad now 
- South girlie (Hope you are nearby or in Alabang area) 

My type:
- I would say I'm naturally drawn to intelligent emotionally mature, and respectful men.
- I find it attractive too when a guy knows how to plan and take initiative
- On a superficial level, I like when the guy is taller than me. 
- Preferably the same age as me or a few years older.

What the hell happened here? Battlefield 6 isn’t just disappointing — it’s *offensive*. It’s like DICE and EA gathered in a room, made a checklist of everything that made the Battlefield series legendary… and **deliberately destroyed it**.

---

### 💀 The campaign: lifeless, lazy, laughably bad

This “story mode” feels like it was written during a coffee break. The characters have the emotional depth of cardboard, the missions are a snoozefest, and the dialogue sounds like it was generated by a broken AI. I’ve played mobile shooters with *more narrative coherence*. It’s an embarrassment — a limp, soulless attempt to pretend they still care about single-player.

They didn’t even try. It’s *placeholder storytelling*. Just filler to justify the price tag.

---

### 🧱 The maps: bland, tiny, and utterly devoid of personality

Battlefield used to mean *epic*, sprawling maps — now it’s glorified team deathmatch arenas that all look like gray copy-paste boxes. The map design feels like someone at DICE was allergic to fun. Vehicles are neutered, sightlines are trash, and half the time you spawn just to die five seconds later because spawn protection is a joke.

How do you release a “Battlefield” game where the **battlefields themselves suck**? That’s like making a racing game where the cars explode on ignition.

---

### 🧠 Game design: dumbed down beyond recognition

Every class feels the same, every gun feels like a pea shooter, and every “update” somehow makes things *worse.* It’s like they decided, “Let’s make Battlefield for people who don’t like Battlefield.”

The progression system? A miserable, grindy treadmill of meaningless unlocks and pointless attachments. The UI looks like it was designed by a committee that’s never actually played a shooter.

And don’t even get me started on the bugs — constant crashes, broken hit registration, laggy servers, and desyncs galore. I’ve seen early-access indie games launch in better shape than this AAA disaster.

---

### 🧨 Monetization: shameless, greedy garbage

They had the audacity to charge full price for this mess and *still* stuff it full of microtransactions, cosmetic passes, and overpriced skins. Oh sure, I can’t join a match without rubber-banding across the map, but at least my soldier can wear a neon banana suit for $15. Incredible.

It’s insulting — a corporate cash grab wearing the corpse of Battlefield like a trophy.

---

### 🧩 Technical incompetence

Ray tracing? Gone. Optimization? Nonexistent. Anti-cheat? A joke. Half the player base can’t even get the game to run properly, and those who can are met with performance that makes your GPU cry for mercy.

DICE once set standards for realism and performance. Now? They can’t even render a tree without tanking your framerate.

---

### 🔥 Final Verdict: Battlefield is dead — and EA killed it

Battlefield 6 isn’t just a misstep — it’s a **betrayal**. It’s Battlefield with all the heart, chaos, and identity stripped out and replaced with corporate sludge. The magic is gone. The ambition is gone. What’s left is a lifeless husk wearing the Battlefield logo like a cruel joke.

If you’re a fan of the series, **don’t waste your money**. Don’t reward mediocrity. Let this game rot in the discount bin where it belongs.

---

**Score: 1/10.**
One point for the gun sounds. Everything else? A flaming disaster that should make EA publicly apologize to every Battlefield fan on Earth.

Would you like me to make it even more sarcastic and unhinged — like a viral Reddit rant or a YouTube rage review?

1op35or,https://i.redd.it/59sibihizfzf1.jpeg,Decant Haul + Reviews,"Let me start off by saying that as a person who never really liked Middle Eastern fragrances, Im really impressed by most of these.

When it comes to fragrances I have always preferred designers. This prejudice was because of a bad experience while sampling my friend's ME decants. Ive tried a couple of popular clones and most of them were overly synthetic apart from Kayaan Classic. Due to this I stayed away from them for over a year.

Off lately whenever I go to sephora or tira to check out the new designer releases, for some reason all of them smell to ""flat"" and similar. Nowadays designer brands are selling the most basic fragrances for 8k-12k. I realized it wouldn't hurt to explore some good Middle Eastern stuff so here I am.

I have ordered 8 decants from Whiff Culture, some having plastic atomizers while some having metal. I bought them all for about 3000 rupees which I think is a fair price.

Here is my review on each of them-

1) Al Harmain's Detour Noir-
As we all know this is a PDM Layton clone. It opens with lot of crisp aromatics,florals and menthol. It then dries into creamy vanilla. It also has similar qualities to Boss Bottled Absolu, which I prefer over the OG Layton. Overall this is very close to Layton but not that high quality. 

Rating - 7.5/10


2) Mancera's Amore Cafe-
Imagine caramelised Biscoff cookies and vanilla ice-cream topped with coffee liquor. Delicious right? That's exactly what this one smells like.
I sprayed this twice on my arm and i got whiffs even 5 hours later. I like it but it's a bit too sweet for me. Will definitely enjoy the rest of the decant.

Rating - 8.5/10


3) Afnan's Supremacy Collectors Edition-
This is received a lot of vibe and its well deserved. Ive smelt Aventus Absolu and I dont think Supremacy CE is a 1:1 clone. It opens with a lovely pineapple-blackcurrant fruitiness with lot of citrus in the background. The drydown is very similar to Sauvage Elixir. I enjoy wearing this and Im considering getting a full bottle

Rating- 9/10


4) French Avenue Specter Ghost
My absolute favorite out of the bunch.
Nishane Ani and Ani X were my favorite vanilla fragrances but they were way too expensive. The very moment I sprayed this,I was overjoyed. This captures the ""lemon cake"" Ani scent profile perfectly. The vanilla in this is absolutely amazing. Will definitely get a full bottle of this one.

Rating- 10/10

5) Rayhaan Pacific Aura-
I haven't had the pleasure of smelling Pacific Chill but this one smells absolutely amazing. Imagine drinking a chilled peach cocktail in a resort. That's what this one smells like. It has citrus,mint,peach and blackcurrant. Its a phenomenal summer fragrance. Based on scent alone its a 10 but the performance is really disappointing. 

Rating - 9.5/10


6) French Avenue Vulcan Feu- 
Another hyped fragrance which lives up to its name. This smells just like maaza and mango sorbet. Its a great fruity-tropical mango fragrance with some citrus and musk. Performance is also pretty good. Overall its a good fragrance but not my type.

Rating- 8.3/10


7) Versace pour Homme-
I had already tried this classic before but I was considering buying a full bottle so I thought it'd be good to give it a few wearings before committing to a full bottle. Its a simple, fresh and clean scent. There some citrus,neroli and white musk. Its nothing complex, just makes you smell good in the best way possible. I recommend carrying a decant of this as you will need to spray again every 2 hours

Rating- 7.8/10


8) Lalique Encre Noir-
This is very unique. Damp soil, dusty libraries,dark manors and wet wood. This is what Encre Noir smells like. This not for everyone. I love this stuff but I cannot think of situation for me to spray this on. I enjoy spraying it on my hand and smelling it every now and then. Definitely worth checking out.

1op35e3,https://tipstor.com/hot-air-balloon-in-the-serengeti-tanzania/,"Hot Air Balloon in the Serengeti, Tanzania","The Serengeti doesn’t whisper. It roars. It stretches endlessly under an African sun so fierce it burns away pretense, leaving only truth and dust. Out here, the horizon feels like the edge of the world, and the wildlife owns every inch of it. Elephants trudge through golden grass with the quiet authority of gods. Lions lounge under acacia trees as if the savanna were built solely for their comfort. It’s a world too vast to be captured, too alive to sit still.

At dawn, the adventure begins in the sky. A hot air balloon drifts silently above the plains as the first light cracks open the horizon. Below, herds of wildebeest move like a living river, zebras flash their stripes in chaotic elegance, and the distant call of a hornbill echoes through the still air. When the balloon lands, breakfast is waiting in the wild. A linen-covered table, silver coffee pots steaming, and the unmistakable scent of adventure blending with freshly baked chapati.

Later, game drives rumble through the grasslands, engines purring softly as giraffes crane their necks toward distant clouds and leopards melt into the brush with a kind of ghostly grace. Every turn of the wheel feels like rolling dice with nature. Never knowing what might emerge from the waving grass. The guides, weathered by sun and story, know every track, every shadow, every rumor carried on the wind.

Evenings in the Serengeti belong to the senses. The air cools, fires crackle, and dinner unfolds under a sky heavy with stars. Pilau rice, spiced with cardamom and cloves, steams beside grilled meat marinated in local herbs. Fresh passionfruit juice cuts through the heat, tart and sweet in equal measure, while ginger beer brings a slow burn that lingers longer than the sunset.

The best season to witness the Serengeti’s wild theater is from June to October, when the Great Migration surges across the plains in a display so raw and untamed it humbles even the most jaded traveler. The landscape, drenched in gold and shadow, becomes a living masterpiece.

Out here, every meal is earned, every moment electric. The Serengeti isn’t just a destination. It’s a reminder that the world still has places too wild, too beautiful, and too real to be tamed.

I was doing really well with my losses until about 8 weeks ago when life happened and I just became so busy that I would forget to eat. My weight loss has really slowed down. I still log everything I eat but I’ve noticed over the last 8 weeks I’ve barely ate on average of 1200 calories a day. The one week I ate closer to 1500 I lost 4 lbs. So this week I have decided I will set alarms and eat 3 meals a day. I’m on day 3 of it, just had my lunch and feel like I’m going to pop. I’m just not ever hungry and I feel like I’m forcing food into myself. 
Does anyone else have a similar issue with eating too few calories and weight loss slowing down ( almost stopping) or am I wrong in thinking that there is a correlation between the two? I’ve always thought that starvation mode was rubbish as you just have to look at the people in countries that don’t get enough food to see eating little causes weight loss.

----

[Narration: 3rd omniscient] 

Red Lace

Theo and Bells hadn’t spoken much since that visit to Emma’s, and the tension between them had only gotten worse when she’d announced this Tokyo trip the day after their row. It has now been two weeks of unresolved tension hanging between them like smoke.

Theo watched from the doorway as she packed her bag with the methodical care of someone planning an escape. Each folded garment felt like a small treachery, every zipped compartment another door closing between them. He told himself he was just needlessly insecure. Bells loved him, had said yes to his proposal, wore his ring (three carats, platinum band, flawless cut). But lately anxiety and intuition have been uncomfortable bedfellows in the Watson-Hann household. All while Watson and Hann themselves were not. He continued his self-imposed banishment in the guest room, and she’d not protested it even once.

Bells, for her part, was trying very hard to appear nonchalant. Folding items mechanically, smoothing creases with her hands. Her palms were damp - she could feel it - the clammy heat of guilt that no amount of casual movement could disguise.

“Need help with anything?” Theo’s asked, light and and seemingly helpful but she knew better. The question carried weight, subtext, hidden clauses in fine print.

“I’m fine, thanks.” Keep it simple. Don’t give him ammunition.

But Theo was already moving closer, pulled by an instinct the Watson men had refined over generations - the need to audit, to verify, to know exactly what belonged to them and where it was going. His steps on the hardwood were soft, deliberate.

He looked into her suitcase - shades of grey, white, and rose pink blended together like a Sfumato painting. Business casual mostly: blazers with sharp shoulders, trousers with knife creases, sensible shoes that clicked with authority on marble floors. Professional armour. Then his eye caught something blood-red tucked beneath the blacks, a slash of colour that didn’t belong in any boardroom.

Gotcha, he thought, even as his stomach dropped. Because finding proof of disloyalty was never as satisfying as one imagined. It was like picking at a scab. Compulsive, necessary, and guaranteed to leave a scar.

“What’s this?” His fingers closed on the fabric, pulling it free. It slithered between his fingers like something alive. He held it up as if it could explain itself. Thirty-five inches of calculated seduction.

Bells felt heat bloom in her cheeks, spreading down her throat. Her pulse jumped, visible in the hollow above her collarbone.

“It’s just a dress, Theo.”

“Just a dress?” He ran his palm over it, feeling the quality of the fabric, the way it would cling and drape and expose. He saw her in this before - the hem ending above the knee, figure-hugging, exposing the swell of her breasts, the kind of dress that made men stop mid-conversation and recalculate their negotiating positions. 

“For your business meetings?”

Her cheeks flushed pink. “There might be social events. Yamamoto mentioned.”

“Right. Social events. When you’d be pretending to be Larssen’s fiancé? In this?”

She’d almost forgotten he knew about the fake engagement. That he’d helped draft clause 4, had insisted on it specifically, predicting exactly this scenario like a man hedging against inevitable betrayal.

“I… just like it.” Her voice wavered despite her best efforts. “It makes me feel feminine.”

He tossed the dress aside and reached back into her suitcase. This time his fingers found delicate lace, hidden in a side compartment she’d thought was discreet. He pulled it free: crimson underwear, matching bra and knickers, and something else. A bodysuit, black, architectural in its construction.

The air left his lungs.



“You need THIS for your business trip?”

The lingerie felt like silk incrimination in his fingers - red lace, whisper-thin, so delicate it could be torn with minimal pressure.  The kind that wasn’t meant to stay on long, designed for efficient removal by hands that knew their way around a woman’s body. The lace caught on his calluses, the tiny imperfections in his otherwise-smooth palms, each snag a small indictment. And beside that, Christ, a bodysuit. The sort of thing that suggested a woman had given considerable thought to what a man might find when he undressed her.

His throat felt tight, constricted, the suffocation of watching your assets depreciate in real time.

Bells snatched the lingerie back, fingers colliding with his in the exchange. The brief contact was tense. Her movements were sharp, defensive.

“I put it on sometimes under business attire for confidence, okay?”

Theo knew all about Bells and confidence, knew how she transformed when she felt powerful. He'd remembered how she'd put a hot number on under her office dress once, when an important client meeting loomed ahead. Her walk altered - hips shifting with liquid precision, spine straightening, chin angling up to catch light and male attention in equal measure. She’d become blue-chip stock, and men’s eyes tracked her movements like hungry day traders watching market openings.

He'd imagined one man in particular had always noticed. He still recalled Larssen’s assessment - clinical, comprehensive, hungry - when she’d stepped from his Bentley at Il Silenzio. That slow appraisal from toe to crown had been a hostile takeover bid conducted in five brutal seconds. Lustful. Brazen. A man pricing an acquisition down to the penny. Then those bright eyes had met Theo’s, unphased by the competing claim.

“How does that work exactly, Bells? Like you’re hiding some secret under your clothes? Something to bring men to their knees?” 

His voice was rising now, control slipping. His hand gripped the bedpost, knuckles whitening, the wood grain pressing into his palm. 

“Is that what this is about, Bells? You want to feel powerful over him?”

Him. They both knew who him was.

Private Eye

Before Bells could formulate a response that wouldn’t sound like the lie it was, Theo’s phone buzzed. Mike’s name on the screen. His private investigator, the man his father swore was “best in class” but who seemed to so far specialise in delivering expensive banalities.

“Nothing on the Bielawski kid, not a single trace,” Mike’s voice crackled through the speaker. “Very rare. I’ve only really seen such a vacuum with children from care settings. Everything sealed tight, guarded, and destroyed after a number of years. I checked the Cambridge connection as per your suggestion. Appears to have gone there.”

No shit, Sherlock, Theo thought. He was increasingly considering reaching out to a different professional. 

“Received a couple of scholarships, some based on merit, others on need.”

So Bielawski was some poor council estate kid, Theo reasoned with disdain. 

“Must have generated impressive returns post-graduation to produce that kind of capital?” His free hand flexed, fingers curling and releasing, a nervous habit from trading floors he used to frequent that betrayed his agitation.

“Still assessing the revenue streams.”

Outstanding. Theo nearly rolled his eyes. Twenty-four hundred pounds in fees so far for information he could have, and had, found himself and quicker.

“And Larssen?”

“Surrey. Only child. Family of Swedish doctors.”

Surrey. Theo let that settle, warm and reassuring like good scotch. Solid middle-class equity. Professional family foundations. The kind of stable, boring background that produced men who knew how to dress power like a second skin but had to learn it, weren’t born into it the way Theo had been.

“Boarding school?” The question carried weight he couldn’t quite hide. For one breathless moment he wondered if they’d been near-peers at Eton, Larssen slightly his junior, both groomed in the same institutional machinery that manufactured British authority.

“Still researching.”

After ending the call with instructions to find Bielawski’s address - I don’t care what it costs, just find it - Theo turned back to find Bells zipping her suitcase with enough force to damage the mechanism. The sound of metal teeth biting closed made something in his chest tighten painfully, like a fist closing around his lungs.

“Ready?” He reached for her bag, an instinctive gesture of help he immediately regretted.

She pulled it away before his fingers made contact, clutching the handle like contested assets in a hostile divorce. The rejection stung - small and sharp and somehow worse than the lingerie, because it was contact she was refusing, not just honesty.

Depreciation

The drive to Heathrow was thick with silence that had physical presence - heavy, humid, the kind of quiet that pressed against eardrums and made swallowing difficult. Punctuated only by the low hum of the Bentley’s engine and the occasional direction from the GPS. London traffic crawled past the windows - brake lights reflecting red off wet pavement even though it wasn’t raining, just that perpetual Thames dampness that made everything feel soggy and compromised.

Finally, at a red light that felt interminable, Theo broke. His hand left the gearshift, reached across the centre console, found her knee. Cold through her jeans. Unresponsive. She didn’t move toward his touch, didn’t shift to accommodate it, just sat there letting his palm rest on her leg like a claim she was too polite to contest.

“I don’t want us to part like this, babe.” The endearment tasted wrong in his mouth, false as a cooked book. “I do love you.”

This is what love looks like when it’s dying, Theo thought. Pleading. Careful. 

“I know, Theo.” Her voice was flat, professional, the exact tone she used with difficult clients who needed to be managed rather than engaged with. “The last two weeks have been... intense.”

“Darling.” He squeezed her knee, felt the muscle tense under his palm, resistance flowing through her like voltage. 

“Nothing we can’t overcome, right?” The hope in his voice embarrassed him, made him feel young and stupid and powerless, a junior analyst begging for mercy from a senior partner who’d already made up their mind.

“Sure.” She was looking down at her hands.

The light changed. Green wash over the dashboard. He returned his hand to the gearshift, fingers gripping leather that was warm from body heat and use.

“Going through your bag... That was uncalled for. You have every right to be mad.”

There it is, she thought, that perfect tactical retreat he always executed on those rare occassions he crossed the line. He always knew the right concession to make, the exact moment to offer just enough remorse to shift the balance sheet. To make her feel like the unreasonable party, the one withholding forgiveness for forgivable offenses, refusing to accept his bid for reconciliation.

“It’s fine, honey. Let’s just forget about it,” she said regardless. Not wishing to make a fuss now. 

But they both knew: some breaches of trust were permanent entries in the ledger.

Tech bro

Terminal 1 hit them with that specific airport sensory assault - recycled air thick with coffee and anxiety sweat, departure announcements echoing off high ceilings, the peculiar acoustics of large spaces designed to move people efficiently rather than comfortably. The overhead lights were too bright, fluorescent and unforgiving, making everyone look slightly ill.

Bells spotted her team near the departure gate: Mark, Keith, Jack, flanked by two engineers and one data scientist, all performing the ritual of avoiding eye contact through phone screens. Professional distance. Plausible deniability. The modern corporate shield.

“Where’s Jude?”

The question left her mouth before she could audit its cost, before she could stop herself from proving Theo’s accusations through her own eagerness.

As if summoned, he emerged from WHSmith - newspapers folded with geometric precision beneath his left arm, left hand pocketed, right hand holding coffee that steamed lazily into recycled air, looking like some Victorian gentleman who’d traded his top hat for a start-up CEO’s studied casualness. Everything about his movement irritated Theo: the unhurried confidence, the way he inhabited space as if he owned it, the maddening suggestion that while other men rushed through airports, Jude Larssen simply arrived.

“A paper?” Theo’s voice carried that upper-class disdain he’d perfected at Eton, the verbal equivalent of looking down from a penthouse at street-level commerce. 

“Don’t you tech bros read everything on screens?”

Tech bro. Just to shoot him down a peg. He was nothing but just another grifter college drop out, a reformed nerd whose unhealthy interest in computing has turned out a happy coincidence as the world went digital.  All of them a bunch of misfits who’d lucked into relevance. Unlike financiers, the class really running the world. The elite Theo belonged to.

Jude’s eyebrows lifted fractionally, N economical movement that somehow managed to be both acknowledgment and dismissal. He sipped his coffee, the cup hiding what might have been a smile.

“Evening, Teddy. Alright?”

The diminutive scraped against Theo’s ears like fingernails on glass. It reduced him, made him small, turned his carefully cultivated authority into something childish and temporary.

“Don’t call me that,” Theo snapped.

“That’s your name, isn’t it?”

The question brutal in its candour. Because yes, Theodore was his name, but Teddy hinted at familiarity, condescension, suggested that he was not a threat.

“It’s Theodore. Or Mr. Watson to you.”

Bells looked at him with something approaching horror, God, please don’t let him start something right now. As she got one of them behaving, leather belt to his throat nonetheless, the other started to throw his toys out of the pram. She glanced sideways, desperate for de-escalation, and spotted Yen suddenly there, chatting with Klar. Perfect.

“Oh look Theo, Yen is here! Jude’s girlfriend.” she boomed, purposely loud.

“She is not” Jude replied swiftly as Yen emerged by his side, surprised the conversation suddenly involved her.

“We’re just seeing where things go” 

She touched his arm with proprietary gentleness, claiming territory with casual intimacy. Bells tracked how he lowered his arm fractionally, barely an inch but enough, making Yen’s palm slide away. The small cruelty of it was almost elegant in its minimalism.

“They’re not going anywhere, Yen’s seeing a Bank of England lad, Alex” Jude looked directly at Bells now, as if this explanation was owed specifically to her. Yen looked down, embarrassment glinting in her eyes, she’d said nothing.

Theo was enjoying this now, his opponent’s awkward dance, trying to show himself as a viable prospect for his fiancé, at the same time having to manage the clinginess of his side piece. This was gold, Bells seeing just how morally bankrupt the guy was without Theo even having to lift a finger.  Though lifting several fingers - preferably clenched into a fist - still held considerable appeal. His knuckles actually ached with the wanting.

“Ah Larssen, a woman having a partner never stopped you before” Theo said mockingly, winking at Yen. 

Bells was astounded at what just came out of his mouth. The public accusation, the casual cruelty, the implication delivered in Heathrow departures where their entire team could hear.

Jack’s eyes wide, Keith shook his head, his expression transmitting “please God make this stop”, Mark from finance pacing awkwardly with his phone pressed to his ear as if suddenly remembering an urgent call. The two engineers and Klar moved closer, drawn by disaster the way crowds gather at accident scenes.

“You’re right, it hadn’t” Jude replied pointedly, “Why hold back now?” he said looking at Bells.

Theo realised he walked into a landmine of his own making. 

Jude looked at him for a moment, faintly amused. Then pulled out a bit of paper from his pocket, folded exactly in half along the long edge, and passed it to Bells casually.

“Your boarding pass Ms Hann”

The way their eyes met for a moment, the way her fingers brushed his, irritated Theo like a personal affront. His arm found her waist automatically, wrapping around her with enough pressure to feel possessive, territorial. Claiming. Pure animal response.

“You’d better get used to saying Mrs Watson. Won’t be long now.”

There. Public claim staked, future ownership declared. Except Bells felt rigid against him, and the announcement landed with all the romance of a business merger.

Jude turned to Theo directly, “Have you checked her phone records yet, or is that still pending?”

“EIGHT!” Bells’ voice cut through the terminal noise like a whip crack, referencing Terms of Engagement. “Eight and five even.”

Theo knew what that was about. The contract he helped draft. Jude was being warned off, reminded of boundaries, told to stay in his lane,  like a dog yanked back on its leash. Clause 8 - prohibited him from using whatever history they have shared as leverage. Five - maintain professional conduct.

Jude paused, coffee cup halfway to his lips.

“My apologies,” he said, giving Bells a look that was anything but apologetic. “I’m contractually obliged not to state the obvious.”

Theo stepped closer toward him. His voice turning dangerously quiet, but she’d heard him.

“Maybe she talked to you a few times when she was pissed and bored. Kind of pathetic how you treasure that like some trophy, but sure. Have that. Keep your little phone calls, your borrowed scraps of attention. It’s me she ends up in bed with every night though. Picture that.”

Perfect. Cruel, true, and delivered when his opponent was legally gagged from responding with any truths of his own. Theo felt a savage satisfaction as the words hit their target.

Jude said nothing, just a small smile tugging at his lips.

Bells bit the inside of her lip hard, he doesn't have to picture it Theo, he's been where you have been. Yet something in his expression suggested the blow landed regardless. And Bells wondered if the “every night” was what sealed it - not the possession itself, but the consistency, the routine, the domestic permanence that phone calls and stolen moments could never compete with.

Theo beamed at Jude’s silence, reading victory in the lack of response.

Sure, perform nonchalance with that Mona Lisa smirk, you twat. We both know who won this round, he thought.

The departure board updated with an electronic clatter - numbers and letters flipping, gates changing, flights boarding. Suddenly everyone was moving, the spell breaking, the professional veneer snapping back into place. Gathering bags, heading toward security, retreating into the safety of logistics and schedules.

Theo pulled Bells close for a kiss that was equal parts affection and performance. Deep, possessive, angling her head back with the hand at her nape, the other tightening on her waist. Designed to leave no doubt about ownership. About who she belonged to. About what Jude wasn’t getting.

She stood rigid in his arms, and when he released her, she walked toward security without hesitation. Without the backward glance.

“I love you, babe,” he called after her.

The words echoed in the terminal.

1op32dy,https://www.gofundme.com/f/improve-the-sound-at-odd-fellows-help-keep-the-venue-safe,Fundraiser to Improve the Sound at Odd Fellows,"**Hey everyone, this is Fisher.** I am starting this GoFundMe to start raising funds for the Odd Fellows to acquire better equipment, shore up their ability to remain a substance-free venue, and in general improve/keep things running in an orderly fashion. I am setting this up as a running GoFundMe; anything you can give is extremely appreciated!

If you've been to an Odd Fellows show in the past 6 months, you've probably seen me either running sound, on stage, or out in the crowd catching my breath :) While I am not a member of the Odd Fellows org, I have been volunteering alongside an incredibly generous and capable team of community members who help to bring equipment, talent, and promotional support to the events that get put on in the Odd Fellows space. This work is not without its cost to us! Be it the PA system and cables, or the snacks provided by the Odd Fellows themselves.

Practically all of the gear the Odd Fellows have now for shows and events are either community donations or the result of my own second-hand shopping. What this means is that while we have a lot of great stuff, some of it is in less than ideal condition and if any of it were to break or get damaged (and some of it has been damaged) it puts the show space in danger of not being able to fill the role it plays in the community. On top of that, while we are proud of the sound work we have already done with a shoestring budget, it can always be better! **Specifically, we wish to purchase another matching subwoofer, and potentially replace (or at least support) our main front-of-house speakers.** Additionally, we suspect that **our current soundboard is starting to have electrical issues** that are affecting the sound at shows. We'd like to replace it with a more modern system that would support more features, including remote mixing from an iPad.

**Any remaining funds after we have satisfactorily upgraded or replaced the equipment will be donated by me to the Odd Fellows to assist in their plan to make the space more accessible and accommodating, including a ramp entrance, as well as support their other programming including the much-needed North End Food Pantry.**

You can read more about the venue project at the IOOF BTV website: [https://www.burlingtonoddfellows.com/about-3](https://www.burlingtonoddfellows.com/about-3)

That's the basic pitch for why you should donate! Now here's the full context.

With the closure of such notable venues as Nectar's, 242 Main (and the rest of Memorial Auditorium), as well as the disappearance of many entry-level performance spaces (Despacito, Manhattan's Pizza, Arts Riot, etc.), the music scene in Vermont has become difficult to find a foothold and build an audience in. The few venues that remain are often 21+ spaces, and on top of that serve alcohol, which is not ideal for sober folks or those struggling with addiction. While there are basement shows, they are often put on without a permit and can pose both a legal and safety risk.

Despite this situation, the need for musical spaces has not gone away and the audiences are here and willing to go to shows. More and more musically capable people are looking for safe places to perform, especially touring bands who need a spot to play but aren't big enough for Higher Ground or the other ""established"" venues.

**The Odd Fellows show venue in the New North End of Burlington was once a space for local DIY shows, and now has returned as a substance-free, all-ages DIY venue featuring music of all genres, but especially those acts that struggle to find places to play in our small but immensely talented and passionate community.** If you've ever traveled or played outside of Burlington, you know that our music culture is one-of-a-kind. Not only has the Burlington area played host and spawned such amazing talents as Phish, Grace Potter, Dispatch, and Rough Francis, but it also has a rich history of frequently returning visiting bands with memorable roots in the DIY scene such as Fugazi, Gogol Bordello, Agnostic Front, and The Dillinger Escape Plan.

Growing up, I found a lot of camaraderie in spaces like 242 Main and Radio Bean, back when under-21 folks could go in to see shows. I cut my teeth as a performer in the Memorial Auditorium Annex and around town at locales like Skinny Pancake and Halvorsen's, plus the long-gone coffee shops like On The Rise in Richmond. I remember when you could walk down Church Street on a weekend and catch 5 different bands around town. I know it kept me out of trouble as an angsty teenager, and now I fear the youth of our times lack those same outlets, making it easier to retreat into antisocial behaviors. Earlier this year, as I was undergoing chemotherapy, I decided to do something about it. I announced that I was looking to donate money and time to whoever could build a space that could replace 242 Main. Eventually, I got in touch with The Odd Fellows about being the person to source gear for them. At the time, I thought they just needed someone to help them buy stuff, but the more I spoke with them, the more I realized they needed someone to help them run shows and navigate the world of DIY performances. Along with Riley of Safety Pin Shows and Zach York, Teppi Zuppo, and Ryon Frink of the Odd Fellows (among several other volunteers), we cobbled together an ambitious but ragtag goal to revive that cultural spirit I had been missing for years. Now it's finally starting to feel like it's back! I just hope we can make it stay that way.

**But why give money to me when you can just give to the Odd Fellows?** By all means, you can and should give money to the Odd Fellows to support their vital work in the New North End. Donating to this fund will act as a direct line of capital for specifically venue project equipment costs. All extra funding once the gear has been purchased will be donated wholesale to the Odd Fellows. No one, including me or any member of the Odd Fellows, will profit from this arrangement. In fact, I am acting on my own volition to find funding for the equipment, the Odd Fellows don't know that I'm doing this. I just know that our community will pitch in when given the opportunity to help :)

Thanks for reading this long-winded history and call to action. Please feel no pressure to give; we are not in danger of shutting down tomorrow, but we are also by no means secure for the long term. I have turned on the ability to give monthly if that is what you prefer, as we will continue to use these funds over a stretch of time. If you can't give your money, consider giving your time and volunteering with us to help put on shows, either as a safety team/coordination member or as a member of the sound crew.

We have known each other for over a decade and greater part of our lives we have been together. She is on the spectrum/ADHD, nothing diagnosed, she doesn't want to be diagnosed but admits she can be on the spectrum. We have been living together for 2 years now, and our life has been getting worse ever since. She has a set schedule every day and any form of changing it causes her anxiety and anger.

Today when she got up and was about to make her coffee I asked if she can make me a coffee to, to which she answered ""You can make your own coffee"" - when we argued about it, she admitted she doesn't want to make two coffees because it intervenes with her schedule. She needs to do certain things in certain order - and if anything changes, she gets irritated. She gets up, she is mean to me if I intervene, she needs to get her coffee and then go for a walk.

Please forgive me if this ends up as more of a rant. 

I'm 25 years old, and in second year standing in my university, Canadian in Ontario. I am also currently unemployed. I know the path I wish to take, and am determined to pursue it come what may, but it hasn't been easy, and at times it feels like I'm about to break apart. I enrolled in university 5 years ago, right when COVID happened, during then me, my mom, and my sis moved to a new city, so ofc both the moving process+COVID+uni was a bit rough, but my grades were still great. Unfortunately after winter, my health completely fell apart, along with my mental health. I suffer with atopic eczema at the most chronic and severe stage according to my specialists. It took us about 2 years to get a family doctor and get my treatment started. Both the condition, then the treatment, were very physically and mentally exhausting, and I spiraled into such a deep depression that I can't describe it, the isolation (self inflicted at times) as a result also piled up. My grades collapsed catastrophically. And to make matters worse, my father had then retired and moved in with us. 

My father has been completely absent from our lives, I'm still a stranger to him and so is he tbh. Ever since he's moved in, he's been verbally abusive to everyone, creating a suffocating environment, he'd cry about his personal issues (which are brought about by himself) and take it out on us, he'd threaten violence to my mother or he'd threaten to abandon us and leave us starving on the street. A little context here, he's a retired civil engineer from a very prestigious position in a forgien country, his moto in life has been ""I'll provide money forever whether the kids study or not, don't bother me about their issues"". Okayy. Also worth mentioning that he has 3 brothers and a sister, 4 whole households of unemployed people, he finances those entire families, they have never worked a day in their lives, they are inseperable from him, he knows more about my cousins, than he knows about me. (Hell he pays for their weddings, home repairs, education you name it)

The deal was that me and my sis will comfortably do university while living in home. But reality seems to be different, the moment he moved in ""when will you be done? When will you be done? You're all pathetic lazy and useless failures, don't even bother studying"".

During this time I was on methotrexate for a year, (an oral form of chemo I believe), nasty nasty side effects. (Constant nausea, lathargy, and some hair loss), then I moved over to JAK inhibitors (immunosuppressant), and during this time I tried my darnest to bounce back. It took a year and a half, but despite the odds, I did! (I even saved up for summer courses out of my own pocket). My grades have now improved so substantially, that by the coming next term I will transfer over to CS, and finally continue my degree. I took extra steps to make sure things keep going smooth, in Ontario we have OSAP (loan+Grant), so I signed the student disability verification forum in regards to my illness as advice by my uni's financial aid office, Doctor signed the forum too, and it got approved. University has been giving me therapy counseling to help cope with the pain of the time I've lost these last 4 years + work on proper coping mechanism/build healthy habits to stay on track with life. I'm not getting injection shots daily, and finally my condition is even starting to improve.

It feels like I've crawled my way out of hell.... But I'm still stuck... My father has just made it unbearable to live in home. He financially manipulates us with threats of abandonment, knowing that we depend on him. I do not wish to depend on him. He gets a twisted pleasure out of it, (he thinks of himself as the BOSS, he was an officer after all). He's been this way especially due to one of his brothers fucking him over with his finances, he trusted half of his life savings to one of his brothers, and the same brother betrayed him. Now he's constantly like ""too bad you'll all be broke cuz my son is useless, has no job, still in uni"". YOU FEED 4 ENTIRE FAMILIES, YOU PAY ALL THEIR BILLS, YOU INVEST WITH THEM, THEY HAVE CONTROL OVER ALL YOUR ASSETS, I could be brat and say that I'm entitled, that the sons of your contemporaries are busy party buying new cars each week (which is true actually! Civil engineer officer sons don't work cuz they're rich kids) I don't want non of that. I just want to be able to peacefully continue my education, heal physically and mentally. I haven't even gotten the time to make 1 single friend in 4 years. 

I'm constantly criticizing myself, examining my own shortcomings, to see what I could've done better, but it's just eating me alive at this point. I've already gone through enough and I'm not ashamed of Jack shit, any other guy would've given up and dropped out or worse.

He'll be moving out of town for 6 months soon, and so here's my plan: 
1. Do advance CS studied
2. Start my game dev projects
3. Apply for a part time job in uni, my health is now getting good enough for it. 
4. Use that to live on campus instead of home. 
5. Cut contact with my dad, I'll just give him some bs story about doing masters and an internship so that I can at least finish my major in peace. 
6. Cut off social media, for a person with severe anxiety & depression, social media is such a poisonous trap, it can suck up your hours of the day, as a means of avoidance and procrastination.
7. In the next 2 months, work towards my driver's license
8. Exercise! I need to get in shape, I'll use the uni gym. 
9. Get involved with a club

But the problem for me is that, 6 months to do all that seems kinda tight. And then comes the waking realization of ""omg I'm 25 and only now am I really getting my footing in uni, where was I for the past 5 years?"". Therapy helped me find ways to cope, like daily evening walks to my fav book store+coffee shop, but I still can't seem to get over the zaps of pain of the time I've lost. I want to pursue CS, I want to become a game developer, that's my dream. I've been unemployed and behind so far up until now. I feel very sensitive towards the slightest mishaps now. Why does it still feel like I don't know what to do? 

Why do I still feel hopeless? I'm sorry to have typed so much, but I still feel lost. And these thoughts are eating away at me, I used to think about other things, like art, what movie to see, what was the last game I found interesting in terms of design. Now all I think about is my scenario, the noose around my neck being my dad. 

My mother fully supports me, she thinks I'm not in the wrong at all despite my own personal failings. My sister is graduating this year in CS, I'm so proud of her♥️, she also has my back. But then again I feel sad, that the only reason my mom stayed married to this man was to make sure her kids have good material conditions. (I fear for her health, she's been taking the brunt of this for 25 years). This is what breaks me, if only I graduated earlier....

1op2wrl,https://i.redd.it/tsnf8hppxfzf1.jpeg,How to contour and do eye makeup for a black-tie formal,"Hi all, my husband and I were recently invited to a black-tie formal gala. I am 42 and most of the time I just focus on looking more awake. On a normal day I fill in my brows a little, put some brown liner on my top lids, curl my lashes and put on some brown mascara. I do play around with makeup for special events, but have never done it for something like this before. There are going to be a lot of influential people at this event, and I want to help my husband by looking my best. 

I think my face is pretty long, and maybe I need to contour it to look shorter. I also have pretty flat and thin lips, so was going to focus on eye makeup. But at 42, I'm afraid I will age myself if I do that. I've been watching tutorials on YouTube and Tiktok, but they often contradict each other. Does anyone know what I really should be doing?

1op2wev,https://www.reddit.com/r/nutritarian/comments/1op2wev/10_days_in/,10 days in,"Hi all, I've recently discovered the diet and have been following it for about 10 days. The first few days were brutal as I relied heavily on sweeteners like honey, maple syrup, agave and processed treats like chocolate protein bars and vegan pastries - but homemade desserts as well. Huge withdrawal symptoms, I was in a foul mood.

However I've been able to stick with it mostly, thanks to dates and dark chocolate (I had a lot of dates the first few days, probably 4 a day, now I have one or two but not every day) and I've seen so much difference in the way that I feel. I'm loving my fruit and salads and eating lots of beans.

One change that's been wild to me is seeing how I am actually satisfied with fewer calories now. I counted calories for almost a whole year while losing weight that's why I know. I would STRUGGLE to stay under 1700 daily calories and would do cardio most days just so that I could have more to eat and feel less deprived whereas now I've had days when I only ate 1200 calories or so and felt comfortable.

Still, I have moments (especially when I'm working late into the night) when I just seem to binge/emotionally eat and I've been trying not to cheat on the diet and only go for a scoop of tahini or nut butter or a tablespoon of pumpkin seeds, which I'm trying to stop doing as well as it looks like a different version of a caloric rush but at least I haven't relapsed on vegan cakes and croissants I guess. (The binging didn't start with nutritarianism, I would always get cravings at night, it's just now that I've been following Fuhrman I see it as something I should cut off whereas before I would eat whatever all through the night as long as I didn't go over my calorie limit.)

However yesterday I was having the hardest time while at work (I work part-time in a bar). (Being up until very late at night makes it harder for me, my usual bedtime when not working is 9 pm.) There was some leftover birthday cake lying around and I had some of the very processed, non-vegan, electric blue icing. It tasted just as disgusting and chemical as you might imagine, buttery, ultra sweet, ultra salty. I also drank an espresso to try and keep myself from going overboard (I usually only drink decaf). I was back on track in the morning but I was feeling awful today, shaking with some mild nausea and in a very bleak mood.

I've been wondering, was it the coffee or could it have been the cake icing? I regularly get shaky after drinking caffeinated coffee but it usually happens 1-2 hours after, not 16+ hours after the fact!

Has anyone experienced this sort of struggle? How did you deal with toxic hunger and how could I better keep in touch with true hunger?

I was veeery hooked on sweets, the first time I ate oatmeal with no honey or sugar in it I thought it tasted like cardboard and almost wanted to cry.

I know this isn't the most active sub but I would love to talk with other people who get this :-)",1,1762349421.0,nutritarian,0,1.0,False

I am writing this with a heavy heart, and I hope it is received with understanding. I respect the STM workers and their right to fight for fair conditions. This is not about blaming them. I just want to speak to the ripple effect that is happening to the small businesses in the city right now.

For many of us, especially independent shops, cafés, restaurants, thrift stores, small brands and the artists and makers who rely on markets, November and December are not just busy months. They are the months that allow us to survive the rest of the year. These weeks determine whether rent can be paid in January and February. They determine whether someone can keep their workspace, keep their one staff member, keep the doors open at all.

Maker markets are filled with people who are not corporations. They are people who are quite literally pouring everything they have into their work. Many of them are supporting themselves or their families entirely from what they sell at these events. These markets are their most important opportunity of the year. When transit is disrupted, a lot of people simply cannot get to these spaces. And the effect is immediate.

This is happening on top of tariffs, increased material and shipping costs, postal disruptions, and years of instability. And I want to say this clearly: I am one of those business owners. I am scared too. I am afraid for my business, and for my own financial stability. I am doing everything I can to keep going, but it is getting harder.

If you are able, here are ways you can genuinely help. None of these require spending beyond your means.

• Visit a local business that you like, even if it is just to buy something small. A coffee, a single cookie, a greeting card, a soap, a zine. Small sales matter more than you think.
• Share a post or story from a small business you love. It gives us a chance to be seen.
• If you are buying gifts this season, consider choosing even one from a local shop, artist, or market. Just one is significant.
• Leave a Google review for your favourite places. It takes 30 seconds and it makes a real difference.

I know not everyone can help financially, and that is okay. Even encouragement helps. Even visibility helps. Even reminder helps.

Montreal’s personality, its creativity, its heart, comes from its independents and its makers. These are real people doing their best to survive. People who are scared right now. People who are trying to hold on.

Thank you for reading, and thank you for caring.

I didn't consume caffeine pre lc, but nowadays consume coffee or [club mate](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Club-Mate). I feel a very strong difference between the two beverages. Coffe is way too extreme and often leads to a crash while Mate is way more gentle.

I wonder if it only has to do with 500ml Mate having 100mg caffeine (around the same amnt. as a cup of coffee has) and being consumed on avg. slower than a coffee or with the difference between the rest of the compounds found in both beverages. I have the feeling (so take this with a grain of salt) that even in the case of consuming both beverages in the same timeframe, the mate effect is still more gentle and doesnt lead to such a racing heart and crash.

1op2t2m,https://youtu.be/NTggZ8DPzis?si=4EtWs-pM6soGXdZT,MY HUSBAND TRIED TO BLOCK MY PROMOTION-AND HOW I TURNED IT WAS SAVAGED,"MY HUSBAND TRIED TO BLOCK MY PROMOTION — AND HOW I TURNED IT AROUND WAS SAVAGE

I had been waiting for this moment for months. Today, the promotion I had been working toward for years was finally within reach. I walked into the office early, my heels clicking on the polished floor, trying not to let my nerves show. Everything seemed perfect until I spotted him—my husband—sitting across from my boss with that smug grin. My heart sank. I had suspected he was unhappy with my career progress, but seeing him in the conference room, leaning over papers that were clearly mine, made it real. The betrayal hit me like a punch in the stomach. I paused in the doorway, pretending I hadn’t noticed. Every instinct screamed at me to storm in, to demand answers, but I knew I had to stay calm. I had to watch and wait. If he was trying to sabotage me, I needed proof. I clenched my fists and decided that no matter what, I wasn’t going to let him destroy what I had worked so hard to achieve. Today, I realized that the fight wasn’t just at work—it was at home too. And I was ready to play smart.

I could feel my hands trembling as I poured coffee in the break room. My mind kept replaying what I had just seen. How long had he been planning this? How much had he told my boss? I had always known he didn’t fully support my career, but I never thought he’d stoop this low. I needed allies, someone who could confirm what I suspected. Luckily, my assistant, Clara, was always observant. I leaned toward her, lowering my voice. “Clara, did you notice anything odd in the meeting today?” She raised an eyebrow and hesitated, then nodded. “I saw him going through your project files before the meeting,” she whispered. My stomach twisted. That was enough to start gathering proof, but I had to act carefully. If I confronted him now, he’d cover his tracks. I needed a plan—a way to turn this around without letting him see that I was onto him. My heart raced with a mix of fear and excitement. For the first time, I realized that if I played this right, I could not only save my promotion but make him regret ever thinking he could stop me.

That night, I pretended to be exhausted, collapsing onto the couch as he came in with his usual smug look. “Long day?” he asked casually. I nodded, keeping my expression neutral. I had to act normal, act as if I had no idea. But inside, my mind was racing. I remembered every time he subtly belittled my ambitions, every sly comment about me not being capable of handling a higher position. He thought he could control me, but he didn’t realize how far I was willing to go. I reached for my laptop, pretending to check emails, and secretly began compiling every document, email, and timestamp that proved the work was mine. Each file I saved felt like building a fortress around my career. I knew that if I presented this at the right moment, he wouldn’t have a chance to defend himself. I allowed myself a small smile. He thought he could sabotage me easily, but he had underestimated me completely. Tomorrow, the real game would begin.

The next morning, I arrived at work earlier than usual, my files securely saved on a flash drive hidden in my purse. I glanced at my phone, seeing a message from my husband: “Hope everything goes well today. Don’t mess up.” His tone was condescending, but I didn’t let it get to me. Today, I had a mission: ensure my promotion was recognized as mine and mine alone. I rehearsed every argument in my head while walking into the office. Clara met me with a quiet nod. She had already noticed the discrepancies in the documents he had shown to my boss. Together, we had enough proof to confront the situation strategically. My heart pounded with adrenaline, but I kept a calm exterior. I knew that patience and timing were crucial. If I acted too soon, he could manipulate the situation. I needed to let him think he was winning, just long enough for me to reveal the full truth in a way that would make him powerless. This was no longer just about a promotion—it was about showing him that I couldn’t be controlled.

When my boss called me into his office, I walked in with confidence, hiding the storm brewing inside. My husband had arrived shortly before, smiling as if everything was going according to his plan. I noticed the questioning look in my boss’s eyes and took a deep breath. “We need to discuss the promotion,” he said. I nodded, sliding the flash drive subtly under my laptop. As he opened it, the files appeared—emails, project drafts, and detailed timestamps proving the work was mine. His eyes widened slightly. I watched, savoring every moment. “Everything here is my work,” I said calmly. My voice was steady, but inside, I felt triumphant. My husband’s smile faltered, and I knew he realized his plan had failed. I maintained eye contact with my boss, letting the evidence speak for itself. By the time I left the office, my promotion was secure, and I could see the silent acknowledgment from my colleagues. He had tried to block me, but I had outmaneuvered him.

Later that day, I confronted him at home. He tried to act casual, but I could see the tension in his shoulders. “I saw what you did today,” he said, trying to sound innocent. I laughed softly, shaking my head. “I saw what you tried to do,” I replied, my tone calm but sharp. “Do you really think I wouldn’t notice?” His face fell. He had underestimated me for too long. I explained, without yelling, how I had documented everything and ensured that my promotion couldn’t be stolen. I watched as realization dawned on him. This wasn’t about revenge—it was about showing him that I was no longer someone he could manipulate. He didn’t argue. For once, he had no words, no excuses. I had done it methodically, strategically, but without losing my composure. For the first time in years, I felt completely in control.

That night, I sat alone in my study, replaying every step of the day in my head. I couldn’t help but feel satisfied at how perfectly the plan had worked. I thought about the months of preparation, the careful collection of evidence, the strategic patience. Every moment of doubt and fear had been worth it. My husband had tried to block me, but he hadn’t counted on my determination. I realized that this was more than just a career victory—it was personal liberation. I felt empowered, stronger than I had in years. The sense of accomplishment was intoxicating. I knew that from this moment on, he would never try to undermine me again. I had proven not just to him but to myself that I was capable, smart, and unbreakable. Tonight, I allowed myself to celebrate in quiet triumph, knowing that tomorrow would only confirm my victory.

The following morning, I walked into work with a renewed sense of purpose. Colleagues who had doubted me glanced my way with admiration. Clara gave me a quiet thumbs-up, a small but meaningful acknowledgment of our shared victory. I ignored the whispering in the hallways; I had learned long ago that jealousy and gossip were inevitable. My promotion was official, and my husband’s influence over my career was gone. I felt a surge of confidence as I thought about the future. For years, I had been careful not to upset him, but now, I knew I could stand on my own. I had completely reversed the situation. He had tried to sabotage me, but I had emerged victorious. And the best part? He had no idea how it happened until it was too late. This was just the beginning of a new chapter—one where I was in control, unstoppable, and untouchable.

The next few days at work felt different. People treated me with a mix of respect and curiosity. My husband, on the other hand, avoided me completely. He tried to act normal, but I could see the tension in his eyes every time we crossed paths. I made it a point to keep my interactions calm and professional, but secretly, I was planning my next steps. The promotion was mine, but I wanted to ensure that he could never undermine me again. I started organizing my work meticulously, creating logs of every task I completed. I even set up email confirmations for important projects. Every detail mattered. I realized that I had underestimated how much he would try to regain control, and I needed to be smarter. For the first time, I truly felt like I was playing a chess game—and I was determined to win decisively.

# 🕵️‍♂️ Is Benable Legit or Another Affiliate Mirage?

So, **is Benable a legitimate affiliate platform** or another digital mirage? User reviews say it’s real. One creator mentioned cashing out multiple times, while another admitted frustration with occasional account locks.

The takeaway? Benable is safe, if imperfect. It’s solid for **affiliate marketing options for micro-influencers** who want to earn modest commissions without the gatekeeping found elsewhere. Its trust factor beats most link farms pretending to be “community platforms.”

Sure, Trustpilot has mixed ratings - some love it, others yell “scam” in all caps - but it’s clear people are actually earning. The **Benable payout threshold details** are transparent, which is more than can be said for plenty of “get rich online” apps.

# 💸 Earning Potential: What’s Realistic Here?

# ⚖️ How Benable Stacks Up

To **compare the best free affiliate platforms**, I lined [Benable](https://benable.com/i/NR3RK) up against ShopMy and LTK. Those two cater to influencers with large followings. Benable, meanwhile, caters to actual humans.

If you’re tired of spreadsheets and tracking IDs, Benable offers a breath of fresh air. Sam loved how quick it was to build and share his “Gear That Keeps My Shoots Sane” list.

# ☕ My Personal Experience Using Benable (from Sam’s Perspective)

Mary roped me into [trying Benable](https://benable.com/i/NR3RK) after I complained - again - about my erratic freelance income. She said, “It’s basically making money for recommending stuff you already love.” Naturally, I rolled my eyes, but curiosity won.

I started small, building a list called *“Gear That Keeps My Shoots Sane.”* Within a couple of days, I saw clicks - actual people checking out the gear I’d linked. Watching those mini commissions trickle in felt weirdly satisfying, like finding forgotten bills in a camera bag. The **apps that pay you for sharing links** part works as promised. It automatically connected products, tracked traffic, and sent me a polite email every time someone made a purchase. My inner control freak appreciated that.

The only snag? I wanted more analytics. As someone who lives by metrics - aperture, ISO, engagement rate - the lack of detailed stats bugged me. Still, it wasn’t a dealbreaker. I hit my first mini payout within weeks, and that little “You’ve earned” email hit like a dopamine shot.

If you’re someone who’s creative but allergic to admin work, Benable’s like finding a lazy man’s goldmine. It’s one of those **beginner-friendly affiliate marketing apps** that actually feels built for real people, not robots in marketing suits.

1op2rlq,https://v.redd.it/ba8ujsjnwfzf1,How Do You Identify Talent?,"Beyond the Résumé: Spotting True Potential in People

Identifying talent isn’t just about credentials or charisma—it’s about perception, pattern recognition, and potential. Whether you’re hiring, mentoring, or building a team, understanding how to spot talent can make or break your success. This guide will walk you through the mindset and methods that will help you identify high-potential individuals, even before they know it themselves.

Why Identifying Talent Matters More Than Ever

In a world where competition is fierce and innovation constant, talent is the true differentiator. According to a 2023 McKinsey report, companies that excel at identifying and developing talent are 2.2 times more likely to outperform their peers in revenue growth. The right person in the right role can amplify results, shape culture, and solve problems no one else sees.

But here’s the twist: talent doesn’t always look like you expect. It’s not always the person with the top degree or the most polished portfolio. More often, it’s a spark—a drive, a resilience, or a hunger to learn—that hints at someone capable of greatness.

What Talent Actually Looks Like

To identify talent, you need to look beyond surface-level traits and tune into deeper indicators:

1. Curiosity and Learning Agility

High-potential individuals ask great questions. They seek to understand, not just execute. They adapt quickly when situations change, and they absorb feedback without ego. Research from Korn Ferry shows that learning agility is one of the top predictors of leadership success.

2. Pattern Recognition and Insight

Some people can connect dots others don’t even see. This ability to notice, analyze, and act on patterns is often the foundation of creativity and strategic thinking. Steve Jobs once said, “Creativity is just connecting things.” Great talent spots these connections instinctively.

3. Ownership Mentality

Talented people act like owners. They don’t wait to be told what to do—they anticipate needs, solve problems, and drive things forward. In a study by Gallup, employees who exhibit ownership are 44% more likely to exceed performance expectations.

4. Emotional Intelligence

People with talent often demonstrate empathy, self-awareness, and the ability to navigate complex interpersonal situations. Daniel Goleman, a pioneer in EQ research, found that emotional intelligence accounts for nearly 90% of the difference between high performers and peers in leadership roles.

Real-World Example: From Coffee Shop to C-Suite

Consider the story of Howard Schultz, former CEO of Starbucks. He didn’t grow up in wealth or privilege. In fact, he came from a working-class family in Brooklyn. But what he had was vision, resilience, and the emotional intelligence to understand what people wanted: not just coffee, but community.

When he joined Starbucks, it was a small Seattle chain. He saw an opportunity others didn’t and convinced the founders to let him expand the business model. The rest is history. Schultz didn’t fit the mold of a “star candidate,” but someone took a chance on his potential—and it paid off.

Tactics for Spotting Talent

So how do you sharpen your ability to identify this kind of potential?

Watch how people think, not just what they know. Pose open-ended problems and observe their approach.
Give small tests of ownership. See how they respond to autonomy and ambiguity.
Ask about failure. The way someone reflects on a setback can reveal character, grit, and growth.
Listen for questions. A thoughtful question often reveals more than a well-rehearsed answer.
Seek peer feedback. Colleagues often see strengths and potential that supervisors miss.
Common Pitfalls to Avoid

Even well-intentioned leaders can fall into traps:

Overvaluing credentials. A degree from a top school doesn’t guarantee insight or adaptability.
Mistaking confidence for competence. Some people perform well in interviews but falter in real-world situations.
Hiring in your own image. Homogeneity may feel comfortable, but diversity of thought is where innovation lives.
Ignoring cultural fit and growth mindset. A brilliant individual who clashes with your culture or resists growth can be a costly mismatch.
Talent is Contextual

Remember, talent isn’t one-size-fits-all. A person may shine in one environment and struggle in another. Great talent identification means understanding both the individual and the role or ecosystem they’re stepping into.

Think of it like casting a movie: a great actor in the wrong part can still flop. But the right actor in the right role? Magic.

Summary: The Art and Science of Seeing Potential

Identifying talent is part intuition, part discipline. It requires slowing down, looking past the obvious, and trusting what you observe over what you’re told. The best talent spotters aren’t just evaluators—they’re believers in what people can become.

🧬QuestionStrings to Practice

QuestionStrings are deliberately ordered sequences of questions in which each answer fuels the next, creating a compounding ladder of insight that drives progressively deeper understanding. What to do now (understand a person’s potential fit for the situation):

🔍 Potential Discovery String
“What lights this person up?” →

“How do they handle challenges?” →

“Do they learn faster than others?” →

“How do they react to feedback?” →

“Would I bet on them in a crisis?”

Try this during interviews, mentorship, or talent reviews. It will help you move beyond bias and see potential more clearly.

Spotting talent is less about having the right lens and more about knowing where to look. As you sharpen your ability to see what others miss, you won’t just build better teams—you’ll build a better future.",1,1762349091.0,QuestionClass,0,1.0,False

From the moment I walked into MERI, I knew I’d made the right choice. Here’s what stood out to me as a student in simple, honest terms.

# Infrastructure

The campus is seriously impressive. The labs are modern and well-equipped whenever I needed to run experiments or work on a project, I never felt held back by old equipment. The library is spacious, quiet, and stocked with lots of books and comfortable seating it’s become one of my favourite places to study. The classrooms are bright, well ventilated, and have good audio-visual setup,s so lectures really make sense. The gym and sports areas are great too after a long day of theory, it’s refreshing to play a game or work out. The campus also feels safe, with security and good lighting everywhere, which gives me peace of mind.

# Placement Support

What made me feel like MERI was serious about my future says this: the placement cell is active. They regularly organise workshops on resume building, mock interviews and career talks. I saw seniors getting internships and full-time offers in companies that I hadn’t even heard of before thanks to the relationships the institute maintains with industry. These sessions helped me shape what I want to do after college, and feel confident about it. The fact that the institute emphasises “learning for the future” clearly shows. [meri.edu.in](https://meri.edu.in/)

# Campus Life

Life here isn’t just about books and classes and that’s a good thing. There are clubs, events, and festivals that bring energy to the campus. On one afternoon I went from a lecture to a music rehearsal to a friendly football game. The cafeteria is a hub of activity meeting friends, chatting over coffee, planning group assignments. Since I’m from out of town, I also appreciate the fact that the hostel and student housing feel quite home-like, and I don’t feel isolated. The vibe is warm, busy in a good way, and gives me both the freedom and structure I need. The institute itself describes the campus as “modern, secure and contemporary a home away from home”. [meri.edu.in](https://meri.edu.in/)

# Overall

As a student, what I’m really grateful for is that MERI doesn’t feel like just a stepping stone, but more like a bridge to where I want to go. The infrastructure gives me what I need to learn well, the placement support gives me hope for what’s next, and the campus life makes the journey enjoyable. If you’re looking for a place where you can grow academically, socially, and professionally, I genuinely believe this is one.

**In short:** If I were to sum it up in one line, MERI is more than a college, it’s the place where I feel I’m building not just grades, but the person I’ll become.",0,1762348936.0,KeepWriting,0,0.5,False

I am a 44 year old male with excellent health, excellent bloodwork, healthy prostate, no diabetes, etc. I have a fasting schedule of 3pm to 9am 4x per week and then no IF on weekends. I run 4 miles 3-4x per week and do strength training, including pelvic floor exercises. I eat a very clean, healthy plant-based diet. I wake up at 530am. I drink one large cup of coffee around 630am and then no more the rest of the day. 

I use liquid stevia with 11% organic cane alcohol and have wondered if this could be the culprit but I only use this in my coffee and afternoon shake (12:30pm). I drink water throughout the day then start sipping (and very little) as of 3pm until about 6pm. I go to bed around 9pm and will wake up 3-4x per night and usually at the same times to urinate. I was prescribed desmopressin at one point but experienced pretty horrible side effects. It worked but it was not without its side effects.

I, over 10 years ago, worked in nightlife and had a job which required I was up until about 5am (ended in 2016). I don’t know if that caused a permanent change to my urinary habits—thoughts? I’ve read that it is probably due to low vasopressin. I am at a loss here and no doctor has been able to tell me what to do without the use of medication.

Binibigay pay ko every after duty so kahit papano meron akong hawak na pera and di naman ako obliged to give at home so sa akin lang muna yung ine-earn ko while wala pa akong stable job. I invited my boyfriend to meet after work today kasi gusto ko sana siya i-treat kahit pares lang (though sa comfortable naman na place), yun lang kasi afford ko sa ngayon. Dapat yung regular pares lang oorderin namin pareho pero kako parang gusto niya yung special pares so yun na yung pinush kong i-order niya for himself, tutal talagang ite-treat ko naman siya today.

Edi ayun, kumakain na kami tapos nagte-thank you siya sa libre. I was responding like, “Ngayon lang ako makakabawi at saka pares lang naman to, ano ka ba.”

I said ngayon lang makakabawi kasi super dami niya talagang naitulong sa akin nung college until now. Lugmok finances ng family ko kasi pandemic nun, so saktong-sakto lang talaga budget at the time, minsan kulang pa. Many times kapag short ako sa allowance, he would give me cash kahit pang-fare lang or pang-coffee kasi super antukin ako nung nag-aaral pa ako. Many times din sinusundo niya ako from duty nung internship days kahit he had to travel around 6 hours back and forth kasi we live far away from each other (Hanggang ngayon, walang problema sa kanya bumyahe masundo lang ako basta available siya at may budget). Kapag lumalabas kami, siya gumagastos kapag wala akong ma-share. May na-earn siya sa paglalaro ng play-to-earn game, pero he didn’t spend a single centavo for himself; he bought me an iPad so I could study better for my board exam. Recently, I got into toy collectibles pero isang Smiski lang na-own ko over the course of almost 6 months kasi luho siya for me (regalo pa yan ng family member as my reward for passing the boards). Then, he surprised me with toy collectibles 😭 Some are dupes, pero sobrang tuwang-tuwa ako. Literal na luho kasi siya, pero alam niyang tuwang-tuwa ako sa mga laruan na yan kaya pinagbibilhan ako. Hindi lang isa, hindi lang dalawa, APAT pa!

Ginagastusan niya pamasahe niya to see me, to spend time with me, to send me home safely, to make me happy with gifts, to lessen my burden with finances, lahat na. Hindi naman siya well-off. Nasho-short din siya sa allowance niya, pero he still manages to do these things for me. 

Anyway, netong kumakain kami ng pares, he kept on offering me the extra toppings ng special pares niya (kasi nga I ordered regular lang). Tinatanggihan ko, kako kumain lang siya. Eh treat ko nga yun sa kanya, tapos binibigay niya pa rin sa akin. Lagi siya ganyan, ino-offer niya food niya para ma-try ko rin. Pero ngayon, like, hindi ba pwedeng enjoyin mo lang? Ngayon lang kita malilibre 😭 At this point medyo gusto ko na maluha kasi kahit napilit ko siyang special pares na yung kunin niya, binibigay naman niya sa akin yung extra na laman 🥹🥹🥹🥹 Hindi ko alam kung OA lang ako, pero nangingilid na luha ko kasi napakaano niya, ewan, hindi ko alam how to put it in words. Hindi ko alam kung pagod lang ako or dahil meron ako ngayon kaya somehow ang emotional ko. Basta, all I know is that he loves me dearly. 

I just needed to get this off my chest kasi hindi pa siya nakakauwi (kasi nga malayo pa uuwian niya huhu) and I can’t contain the appreciation I have for him. Simple gesture lang yun from him pero it meant the world to me. Kainisssss naiiyak ako 🥲

I Didn't Do It

I woke up to the sound of heavy fists pounding on my door. I didn't get up right away, thinking the sound had been in my dream. My dreary eyes settling on the window, seeing the sun just beginning to rise on a cloudy horizon.

\*POUND\*

\*POUND\*

\*POUND\*

There was definitely someone at the door. I jumped out of bed to answer it, clinging to the towel I fell asleep with wrapped around me. The weirdest feeling of deja vu as the door shook from another round of knocking as I reached for the doorknob.

I opened it, to see two police officers outside my patio. There was yellow tape wrapped around the stairs that led up to Beth's apartment, and the officers looked at me with suspicion.

""Are you Mike?""

""Yes, what's going on?""

""We'd like to ask you some questions. Do you know your upstairs neighbor? A Miss Bethany Broflovsky?""

""Uh yeah, yeah I do. Why?"" I said nervously, unsure where this was going.

""Did you get into an altercation with her last night around 6:30?""

""What? I mean, yeah I snapped at her for the cigarette smell when I came home from work.""

""Sir we'd like to bring you down to the station for questioning. You're currently a suspect for the murder of Bethany Broflovsky.""

It felt like my heart fell into my stomach. Murder? Beth was dead? I was supposed to apologize to her this morning, this couldn't be real, I had to be dreaming. This couldn't be right.

""We'll give you a minute to get dressed, but we'll be waiting right here for you."" The officer said, eyeing me warily as I nodded my head and went to my room.

What on Earth was happening? Was Beth really murdered? Why was I a suspect? I hardly knew her, surely this was some kind of mistake. I could hear the cops talking outside while I got dressed.

""Yeah he's a scrawny little prick, I could take him easy.""

""Maybe we'll get lucky and he'll get squirrely, it's been a boring week.""

My hands began shaking as I buttoned up my shirt. I was never a violent person, but here I was a suspect for murder with police outside my door talking about how they could beat me up. They very easily could too, I'd never been in a fight in my life. I'd like to say some part of me manned up, that I thought for a second I could stand my ground, but that just wasn't the case. The way things were going, I was one spaz out away from getting body slammed and thrown in prison, and it felt like there was nothing I could do but watch whatever would happen next.

Leaving my apartment with the officers, I cringed at the sight of my living space as I locked the door. Last night's dinner still on the table with dishes in the sink, my bathroom door open with dirty clothes on the floor. I was usually so neat, the one time police come to my apartment and it looks like this.

Walking out, I noticed another pair of officers outside Beth's apartment putting up police tape across her door. They both looked right at me as I walked out, stoic expressions on their faces. In the parking lot, a coroner's van next to the cop car I was getting into made it fully set in. It was all too real. This wasn't a dream, this was really happening.

As we pulled out of my complex, it occurred to me that I hadn't been a passenger in a vehicle in quite awhile. I only ever drove myself to work and the store, and would have my eyes fixed on the road the whole time. I hadn't looked out a side window and just watch buildings go by since I was a teenager. It was calming, something I needed before being interrogated by police as a murder suspect.

Then, through the anxious fog in my thoughts, it hit me. Beth was dead. We weren't close exactly, I wouldn't call it mourning, but I had been so awful to her just last night and would never get to apologize. That was the culmination of my relationship with my neighbor, utter silence and then lashing out at her. Nice one, Mike.

The guilt felt like a ball of lead rolling around in my empty stomach. If being an asshole was a crime I should definitely be in the back of this cop car.

Wait, right, I was in the back of a cop car, because they think I did it. Why did they think I did it? I hardly knew her. I had talked to her more yesterday than the entirety of the last 6 years we've been neighbors. I tried to recall last night, what happened after I went inside. I couldn't remember. I know I made dinner and watched the news, but it's all fuzzy after that. I don't even remember going to bed now that I think about it. Like I had gotten black-out drunk, but I hadn't had a drink since college. There was just this hole in my brain where last night was supposed to be.

Cars passed by going the other direction, blurring the background as they did so. It almost looked like there was some kind of creature running along the side of the road, leaping across rooftops and between buildings, keeping perfect pace with the vehicle. I couldn't focus on it, and it vanished behind a truck as the patrol car pulled up out front of the police station.

I was walked in by one officer while the other parked. I didn't allow myself to glance back at where I last saw the thing. I didn't want to seem jumpy by looking over my shoulder, a feat made all the more difficult by that unmistakable feeling of someone, or something, watching me from some just out of sight perch, waiting for a moment I was vulnerable to strike. Like a vulture was watching the lions drag a gazelle into their den, awaiting their chance to pick the meat off my bones.

""Just down the hall, first door on the right."" The officer said behind me, urging me through the metal detector and into the station.

A heavy door lead to a room with a table and a single chair, a large mirror spanning the length of the wall. That had to be a one way window, I watched enough criminal investigation shows to know that.

""Take a seat, the investigator will be with you shortly.""

The door closed behind him as I took a seat. The large mirror to my right gave me my first look at myself since I got up this morning. I looked like hell, my hair a mess and my shirt wrinkled. Bags under my eyes betrayed what little sleep I had gotten the last few nights, and they were bloodshot like I had been staring at the sun without blinking.

It happened so subtly I took pause to consider if I saw it at all, but I definitely did. My reflection winked back at me. As I evaluated myself in the mirror and looked into my own eyes, the left one closed, independent of my movements. I certainly didn't just wink at myself, and I had both eyes open to see it happen. I rubbed my eyes and looked again, just as the door opened, startling me as the investigator walked in.

""Hello Mike I'm Officer Darnell, I'll be asking you some questions this morning. Would you like a cup of coffee?""

He walked in, an outstretched hand with a styrofoam cup in it. Little swirls of steam rolling off indicating it was fresh, roasty coffee smells filling the room and waking me up a bit.

""Yes, please."" I said, surprising myself.

I didn't typically drink coffee, but in my fatigued state I couldn't deny its appeal.

""Now before we get off on the wrong foot, I want you to know you're not in here because we think you did it, not yet anyway.""

He said with a fake laugh, eyeing me up and down as he did so. Gauging my reaction most likely.

""But we don't know what happened. What we do know, is Miss Broflovsky is dead, and you appear to be the last person to see her alive.""

I could feel the color in my face drain at those final words. An immeasurable weight was pushing down on my shoulders, wanting to compress me into a little ball and crush me out of existence. The last interaction Beth had with another person was me losing it on her.

""Now son, did you tell Beth to kill herself? One of your neighbors said they overheard your argument last night, and said that you yelled that at her. Is that true?""

I wished he had just walked in and shot me instead as the gravity of what happened sank in.

""No! No I didn't, I mean, not really. That's not what I meant. I had said she was killing herself with the cigarettes, that the smell was bothering me, I didn't mean she should commit suicide!""

I was almost spilling coffee now my hands were shaking so bad. I was trying to keep myself from freaking out, but I was very much already freaking out. The officer seemed to study my face, weighing in his mind what he thought of what I said. The seconds passed like days before he spoke again.

""Wait here please, I'll be right back.""

He turned his back to me and stepped out. I wasn't sure what he made of my story, and I panicked as I thought about how I couldn't remember last night. I couldn't confidently tell myself I stayed home. I couldn't remember. I knew I didn't do it, but I wasn't about to do a good job of convincing anyone of that. A bead of sweat rolled down the side of my face as I sipped the coffee, trying to still my hands. I set my cup down. Jittery wrists making the bottom of the cup tap the surface of the table three times as it left my hand, and the lights flickered simultaneously with it until going out.

The room was now dark, except for the lights appearing to be on in the mirror image of the space. I looked into the mirror, finding my reflection to be a misty shadow looking back at me. The longer I looked, the larger it became, until the shade consumed the light in the mirror and everything was now pitch black. I heard three taps again and the light came flooding back into the room as the door opened and Officer Darnell walked back in.

""Alright Mike, we're not going to hold you any longer. There's no evidence of you, or anyone for that matter, having ever entered her home last night. Based on what you said, and you're neighbors testimony, it seems like it was no more than a misunderstanding, and there's no criminal charges being pressed against you. You're free to go, and if you'd like Officer Andrews will take you home.""

I was reeling from the emotional roller coaster of this morning. I hadn't even eaten breakfast yet, and the coffee was upsetting my stomach almost as much as the gut punch of Beth's suicide. Somehow I was supposed to go to work today after all this, and all I wanted was to crawl into my bed and shut out the world.

The drive back to my apartment was uneventful. I stared out the window as the cop hummed along to songs on the radio. I zoned out the whole way there, only snapping out of it when Andrews said ""Have a nice day!"" As I got out of the car. I almost barked back what a ridiculous thing that was to say, before stopping myself as I remembered that was an armed police officer who could kick the crap out of me for fun. My day sucked enough, I muttered ""Thanks"" and continued to my apartment.

I went to go around the corner to walk up to my building, but as I did so I realized I was in the wrong place. What? I looked back, and I apparently made a wrong turn as my building was the other way. I shook my head side to side and chalked it up to nerves, that were further rattled by the yellow tape and bold lettering that read ""POLICE LINE DO NOT CROSS"" blocking the stairs next to my door.

I tried not to think about Beth, there was nothing I could do about it anymore. I was already an hour late for work and I couldn't waste any more time. I didn't bother with last night's mess, or even changing my shirt. I just silently made a couple eggs and ate them, staring through the television at truly nothing at all. I couldn't have cared less about the growing shadow I could see in the black mirror in front of me.

I left for work, and was halfway there before I realized I most certainly didn't lock my door. I wasn't even sure I cared, I didn't have anything worth stealing. However I wasn't too pleased with the thought of someone being in my home while I wasn't. A thought I had to let go of before my anxiety got the best of me.

Arriving at work a full two hours late, I could hear the whispered ""There he is"" as I walked in the room. My boss, an older woman I only ever saw during quarterly meetings, came out of her office in the back before I reached my desk, a sign I immediately recognized as I changed course for her office with my head down. I entered without a word between us until she closed the door behind her.

""Are you feeling alright?"" She said, her voice like a tiger's purr.

""Yes, ma'am. I'm sorry about being late. My upstairs neighbor she..well she died last night, and the police brought me in for some questions early this morning.""

""Oh my goodness, I'm sorry to hear that. That certainly explains, well"" as she pointed her hands at me and gestured up and down, referring to my disheveled appearance.

""I'd ask why you didn't call and let us know you'd be late, but I suppose I should be happy you showed up at all""

I could never tell if she was happy or mad, being kind or ripping into me, like a jungle cat playing with its food.

""I've heard you've been on edge a little lately, and to be honest I don't care what's going on in your personal life, but with the morning you've had I'd say you can take the day off. Don't know how useful you're going to be like this after all.""

I felt both appreciative and like I had been scolded by a teacher in kindergarten. She had a funny way of making you feel small, why I preferred seeing her as little as possible. She carried on.

""It is Friday, have a long weekend. You can have Monday off too, and I'll expect you back Tuesday bright eyed and bushy tailed.""

She lowered her eyes back onto some documents in front of her, signaling our conversation was over.

""Oh, okay. Thank you ma'am. I appreciate it, I'll see you Tuesday."" I said like a kid to his mom who just grounded him.

I walked out of the office and could feel every set of eyes on me as I walked out. They were all muttering amongst themselves, surely churning the rumor mill as to what was going on with me.

I drove home, and was keenly aware of each passing second for once. I heard the music on the radio, saw the people walking down the street, could taste the moisture in the air on my tongue as I rolled the window down and felt the rain upon my hand. The radio cut to static, before the familiar \*BAMP\* of the emergency broadcast blared out of my speakers before the distorted voice said that heavy thunderstorms were rolling in, and advised people to stay indoors. The music came back, and just after a large arc of lightning cracked across the sky as if to validate the radio's claims.

I got home, and as I walked back from my car I realized it was the smell of Beth's cigarettes that were what guided me to the building. It was when I remembered having made the wrong turn earlier that it dawned on me. A fact that made me feel worse about my outburst last night.

I opened my unlocked door, walked past the mess while unbottoning my shirt, and face-planted onto my mattress. I just wanted to sleep, so that's what I was going to do.

Chapter 6

Heavy Lies The Head

I was outside, between apartment buildings. I looked to see if I could find any identifying numbers, but it was like I didn't know what numbers were. I could see them, but like looking at an unknown language in a foreign script, I couldn't tell what the symbols meant.

I wandered down the walkway, rounding each corner to find myself in ever more intersections between buildings. Endless crossroads along walls and windows, but no doors. It felt more like I was walking in circles, somehow arriving back where I started despite walking straight.

For awhile I just took in the wonder, the odd geometry of it, until something caught my eye. Just up in the corner of one of the windows, the curtains were folded back and the sillhouette of a head exposed someone to be watching me. I began walking a bit faster.

It was then I noticed it in every window, some a single occupant, in others what appeared to be a whole family standing and watching me. I looked behind me to see a tall figure following me, always just beyond where the light could shine upon it yet also getting closer and closer. I began to run, when suddenly an odor dug into my face like a lobotomy. A putrid smell, that seemed to wedge a pick into my eyes and hook into my nasal cavity, yanking me down the walkway. My feet fumbled along the pavement as they struggled to stay beneath me as the pain in my face swelled like a tidal wave crashing down upon me.

I strained to open my eyes through the agony, tears flowing like waterfalls, to see my building as I rounded the corner. The patio light illuminating the door underneath the stairs to the upstairs unit. I anticipated being pulled to my door into my apartment, but my feet found themselves at the bottom of the stairs. With each step my panic rose with my body, one by one coming closer to a nightmare I knew would unfold before I'd seen it. I hammered my fist three times against Beth's door, and when it opened I pushed against it and barged in. As I did so, my ears began ringing like a siren.

I could tell I was yelling, but I couldn't hear my words. Only by Beth's continuously sinking expression could I tell I was saying something horrid. She began to cry, and I just didn't stop. I was relentless, unrelinquishing in my conquest to be savage and heartless. I watched as she grabbed a rope and wrote a note, still spewing toxic filth from my mouth. I continued still as she tied it and stepped upon the stool. It wasn't until her feet stopped twitching did the ringing in my ears cease.

A black sludge began creeping out of her mouth. Rolling muck reaching down her neck and chest, dripping onto the floor and pooling into a bubbling blob. The last of it crawled off of her and into the central form, and it rose before me. Expanding more and more, towering over me and snuffing out the light, and then the air in the room. Just before I felt like it was going to crush me within its mass, I woke up.",1,1762348774.0,creepcast,0,1.0,False

Nothing forced or rushed, just easy conversations that flow. Someone I can text through the day, share random thoughts with, talk about life, and maybe end up being each other’s goto person over time.

When it comes to people, I like conversations that go beyond small talk. I can be a good listener, but I enjoy a bit of playful banter too. Lately, life’s been kind of quiet, and I wouldn’t mind finding someone who brings a little warmth into it. Kind, nurturing, and easy to be around.

I’m spiritual, not really religious, and I’ve got a soft spot for philosophy like stoicism and nihilism. Coffee keeps me sane, and I make some oddly good instant noodles with peanut butter. I’ve also been experimenting with my air fryer lately like it’s a new hobby.

If you’re someone who’s up for honest chats, a few laughs, and building something genuine over time, hit me up.

I haven’t had Tim Hortons in over two years, but every time I see their endless line of merchandise, I can’t help but wonder who’s actually buying it. It says a lot about how the company operates: cheap food, cheap quality, and a business model built on cutting corners.

They sell low-cost, low-quality food to lower-income customers, rely on underpaid and overworked staff, and then turn around and sell “premium” merchandise—probably produced in questionable conditions—to middle-class consumers chasing that nostalgic “Canadian” image.

What’s even more striking is how much better Tim Hortons is in other countries. The quality abroad is often ten times higher than what’s served in Canada, the very place that made the brand famous. It’s a perfect snapshot of capitalism’s trajectory: the company built its empire on Canadians’ loyalty, only to shortchange them once it reached the top. I still remember when you could get a proper bowl of soup served in a ceramic dish.

Y'all, I was blown away by the quality of espresso there. I've reconciled myself to low key disappointment when ordering espresso in the US. The high quality coffee shops are typically *fine*, at best making espresso on par with what I make at home. But it's almost never *better*. That was not my experience in the Netherlands. Every single shop was as good or better than what I make at home.

For reference, I typically prefer medium or darker light roasts. My drink of choice is a cortado with dairy milk.

We often bring up Glitch (Japan) in this sub, and it is amazing, but it's a special treat – an experience. But for regular, daily drinking, I think the Netherlands is now my promised lands. (Disclosure, I haven't been to Scandinavia. Maybe things keep getting better the further north one goes?)

And if you're looking for recommendations, here are the shops I can whole heartily give thumbs up to. Note that this is less than a third of the places I had on my list to try.

* LOT61 Coffee Roasters, Kinkerstraat 112, Amsterdam
* louf, Nicolaas Berchemstraat 4, Amsterdam
* Badeta Coffee, Van Woustraat 14,Amsterdam
* Sango Specialty Coffee Roasters, Stromarkt 15, Amsterdam

And a special call out to WAY coffee (all locations) in Ghent, Belgium. That coffee shop was actually my highlight. They had a single origin Ethiopian that made me truly understand what tasters mean when they say a coffee is ""juicy."" It was really eye opening.

Anyone else have thoughts on espresso in the Netherlands or Belgium? Am I just on a post-vacation high or do others agree that it's S tier?

Every day, we make hundreds of decisions, from choosing a coffee order to evaluating business risks. But why do equally smart people often disagree on the ""right"" choice? Psychologist David Kolb identified four learning styles that shape how we process information. When paired with the AIM critical thinking framework (Assess, Identify, Make), these styles become secret weapons for better decisions. Here’s how each type thinks—and where they stumble.

I’d set goals, buy a new planner, promise myself that this time I’d be consistent… and then fall off after a week or two. It wasn’t that I was lazy I just never built a system that made discipline easy.  
The turning point came when I stopped trying to “force motivation” and focused on small, repeatable rules.

Here’s what’s been working for me:

1. The two-minute rule (for mornings) When my alarm goes off, I don’t hit snooze anymore. I immediately do something physical for two minutes stretching, light yoga, walking around the room, whatever.Those first two minutes change everything. My brain wakes up, I stop negotiating with myself, and the day starts moving forward.After that, I write a quick to-do list and post it in my accountability group. It sounds small, but knowing other people will see it keeps me honest.
2. The two-day rule This one saved my consistency. I never let myself miss the same habit two days in a row. Miss a workout? Fine. Miss two? That’s how streaks die.
3. Decision minimization The night before, I set out my clothes, prep breakfast, and clean my workspace. That small prep means I start the day with one less mental battle.
4. The five-minute start When I don’t feel like doing something, I commit to just five minutes. Usually, once I start, I end up finishing the whole thing. Getting started is always the hardest part.
5. Accountability matters more than motivation I used to think discipline meant doing everything alone. Turns out, accountability is what keeps me consistent.
6. Anchor + Novelty Habits I’ve started building habits around something I already do that’s the anchor. For example, I stretch right after making coffee, or plan my day right after brushing my teeth. The anchor keeps it consistent because it’s tied to a routine that already exists. Then I add a bit of novelty to keep my brain interested. Changing the playlist, swapping locations, or slightly tweaking the challenge gives a small dopamine kick and keeps it from getting stale. It turns habit-building into a kind of game instead of a chore.
7. Weekly reset Every Sunday night, I take ten minutes to look back at what worked and what didn’t. No journaling marathon just quick notes and small adjustments for the week ahead.(you can use soothfy for novelty)

None of this is fancy. No aesthetics, no perfect routine videos. Just small systems that quietly add up.  
If you’ve been struggling with discipline or chaotic mornings, start with one rule. Two minutes of movement or the two-day rule.

And you swallow it, \
because someone out there might actually be dying. \
They roll in, \
bleeding, blue, broken \
and all the anger and resentment burn off in one heartbeat. 

But damn, some nights, \
I wish “no” was an order set. \
I wish “no” was chartable. \
I wish “no” meant \
I still cared, \
just not at the cost of myself.

1op277r,https://i.redd.it/ldxozodasfzf1.jpeg,Another fall storm rolled through recently...,"Good morning! Another fall storm rolled through recently — one of those blustery New England tempests that makes the trees groan and the windows rattle in their frames.

I was just settling in for the evening when it sounded as though the wind-whipped oak trees had had enough of holding onto this year’s crop of acorns and to show their displeasure at the weather, decided to throw them at the house. 

I pictured the neighborhood squirrels hunkered down, wide-eyed, watching their anticipated winter stash take flight. Somewhere out there, one of them was probably squeaking, “Well, there goes the pantry.”

Between gusts, I could hear the acorns pelting the roof, then rolling down in little cascades. If you’ve never tried falling asleep to that sound, imagine trying to nap inside a combination wind tunnel - popcorn machine.

Still, it’s all part of the season’s charm. There’s something oddly comforting about listening to the drumming rain and howling wind while you’re tucked safely inside your cozy abode.

Eventually, the storm moves on and the world quiets. By morning, the yard is a mess of leaves, twigs, and acorns. I stand there with my coffee, surveying the damage, and wonder if it’s time to fetch the rake… or just let the squirrels sort it out.

I hope all is well in your corner of the world! 🌞 ",1,1762347659.0,u_Read_an_ice_age_saga,0,1.0,False
1op26z3,https://i.redd.it/9gshn0x5sfzf1.jpeg,Air (hopefully) bubbles from coolant system.,"Hi,

My CX5 is bubbling from the coolant system.

Block test is negative (fluid remains the same dark blue) after 20 minutes of engine running and bubbles passing through the liquid (image shows the liquid after 20 minutes of bubbles passing through). Suggesting head gasket isn't the issue, although could be. I've done the block test twice with same results. I tested the liquid with a breath test, and it turned yellow, so liquid is fine.

  
EDIT: DIESEL

Cabin air becomes hot, not massively, and I notice that the hotter air blowing from the passenger vents. Driver vents, I'd say are luke warm.

I know that water has been added to the coolant - not by me - so I'm suspecting this has diluted the coolant and possibly boiling the high concentration of water. Also, the cap was opened when hot - again not by me - so coolant has spilled onto the engine cover.

Engine oil is as should be, no froth or coffee-like symptoms and exhaust isn't blowing white smoke. Only after a cold start for a second or two, likely condensation.

I'm going to ask a garage to look at it, I'm hoping it might just be a drain and refresh of the coolant with FL22.

Just looking for some advice, I know there are other possibilities like the thermostat, pump etc. Just don't want to keep spending aimlessly. I'll see what the garage has to say.

Thanks,",2,1762347643.0,CX5,0,1.0,False
1op26nk,https://www.reddit.com/r/soothfy/comments/1op26nk/after_years_of_failed_habits_and_chaotic_mornings/,"After years of failed habits and chaotic mornings, I finally found a system that actually stuck","For most of my adult life, I thought I just wasn’t a disciplined person.  
I’d set goals, buy a new planner, promise myself that *this time* I’d be consistent… and then fall off after a week or two. It wasn’t that I was lazy I just never built a system that made discipline easy.  
The turning point came when I stopped trying to “force motivation” and focused on small, repeatable rules.

Here’s what’s been working for me:  
  
  
1. The two-minute rule (for mornings)  
When my alarm goes off, I don’t hit snooze anymore. I immediately do *something* physical for two minutes stretching, light yoga, walking around the room, whatever.Those first two minutes change everything. My brain wakes up, I stop negotiating with myself, and the day starts moving forward.After that, I write a quick to-do list and post it in my accountability group. It sounds small, but knowing other people will see it keeps me honest.

2. The two-day rule  
This one saved my consistency. I never let myself miss the same habit two days in a row.  
Miss a workout? Fine. Miss two? That’s how streaks die.

3. Decision minimization  
The night before, I set out my clothes, prep breakfast, and clean my workspace.  
That small prep means I start the day with one less mental battle.

4. The five-minute start  
When I don’t feel like doing something, I commit to just five minutes. Usually, once I start, I end up finishing the whole thing. Getting started is always the hardest part.

5. Accountability matters more than motivation  
I used to think discipline meant doing everything alone. Turns out, accountability is what keeps me consistent.

6. Anchor + Novelty Habits  
I’ve started building habits around something I already do that’s the *anchor*. For example, I stretch right after making coffee, or plan my day right after brushing my teeth. The anchor keeps it consistent because it’s tied to a routine that already exists. Then I add a bit of *novelty* to keep my brain interested. Changing the playlist, swapping locations, or slightly tweaking the challenge gives a small dopamine kick and keeps it from getting stale.  
It turns habit-building into a kind of game instead of a chore.

7. Weekly reset  
Every Sunday night, I take ten minutes to look back at what worked and what didn’t. No journaling marathon just quick notes and small adjustments for the week ahead.(you can use soothfy for novelty)

None of this is fancy. No aesthetics, no perfect routine videos. Just small systems that quietly add up.  
If you’ve been struggling with discipline or chaotic mornings, start with one rule. Two minutes of movement or the two-day rule.

That’s how I finally built habits that actually lasted.",4,1762347622.0,soothfy,0,1.0,False

I am trying to tranfer over my lease for someone to stay in my room of a two bedroom one bathroom apartment in Parkville. Rent is 788 + 70 for utilities (BGE budget billing) and wifi (Xfinity). 

The room is fully furnished with two dressers, a big mirror, a nightstand, a shelf, a bedframe, and a desk. You would need a desk chair. Two big closets.

   * Coffee, vanilla, amber, and jasmine notes sound like something I’d enjoy, especially in this colder season. Also wondering if the lavender in the opening might be a bit similar to the **YSL Libre** line, which I love.

I’ve always been very regular, like cup of coffee and then a daily morning poop. This is foreign to me. I’m still pooping once every day typically but it’s small, and hard to pass and I’m worried about hemorrhoids or pelvic floor damage.

I put fiber in my coffee daily; I eat a ton of vegetables and I’m not sure what else I should be doing. 

2 changing hair texture where it’s greying.
My fine hair is greying in one wonderful steak that’s easily hidden in my part; but the texture there is courser and that hard curly frizz that is shorter pieces of hair and refuses to be tamed. 

Hair wax, etc doesn’t work well for my hair type and makes it look greasy. Plus I bike and wear a helmet so any finishing sprays just get worn off on the ride.

1op1wtv,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating_advice/comments/1op1wtv/bizarre_and_unique_dating_experience/,Bizarre and unique dating experience!,"I (31M) just had two of the best dates of my life with (30F) and recently received the dreaded friendzone message. Trust me, I am no stranger to hearing that sentiment, but this one threw me off!

We met for the first time early last week for drinks. It was a spot she suggested as I'm new to the city, and the vibes were great. I arrive to her standing outside the venue, and she eagerly waves me over and gives me a big hug. We sit down and immediately get into good conversation; we are both so engaged that it takes us about 20 minutes to just look at the menu! There is some playful flirting throughout, and we've both have a couple drinks by the end. We are both having such a good time we start planning our next date midway through the night. Before we leave, she asks for my number and sends me a sweet message. It is getting late, so I start to walk her to her car.

For context, I have never once kissed a woman on a first date, it has always felt like there is some sort of barrier between us that takes time to come down. With her there was an immediate and obvious attraction, and when I told her I wanted to kiss her, she practically lunged at me! We kissed a few times, and every time I thought we were done, she would pull me in for another.

We part ways for the night, and I feel elated. I send her a message about her great the night was, and how I really felt some energy I haven't felt before. She tells me she was gushing to her friends on her drive home.

Our second date was a daytime affair last weekend. We meet for coffee and a nice slow walk to a picturesque spot. When we first met up I handed her a nice bouquet of flowers, and her jaw literally drops! There is a clear and immediate physical chemistry as we are holding hands and kissing whenever we have a private moment. We take a seat on a park bench and she sits as close as one can. She lays her head down on my shoulder and steals kisses whenever there are no walkers nearby. We then headed back into town to a board game cafe (my suggestion, she said she had always wanted to check it out). and we play one game that takes about twice as long as it normally would because we are both so smitten by each other (well that is my read anyway).

After about 4 hours, I walk her back to her car. She needs to leave soon, but not quite yet, so I take a seat, and we make out for a good long time. There is a feeling that we both want more, and she suggests coming over to my house on Thursday, she practically invites herself! I say I'll make dinner and get some drinks, and she sounds very excited by the proposition. She drops me off at my car and gives me a long and soulful hug. Afterwards I'm sat down in my car with a big dumb grin on my face.

Throughout our short time talking, she texts me enthusiastically and keeps everything very positive. She expresses that she's having a great time and can't wait to see me again between dates. I did get the sense that I was keeping most of the conversation going text wise, but I respect that some people aren't big texters. I have also artificially ""played it cool"" with women for so long, and I felt like I could be open with her and say how great of a time I was having, and express genuine interest in getting to know her.

After we parted last weekend, the messages did fizzle out a bit. I asked her some things about food allergies, what her favorite beers are etc. Yesterday I wanted to try and connect a bit more and called her after work, she didn't pick up (she told me she loves phone calls, and I prefer them over texting personally). I send her a text asking how her week is going and saying I wanted to see what time Thursday would be best. No response until late last night: She says she has been out with friends, and she's sorry she didn't get back sooner.

She then goes on to say that she is getting more of a friend vibe, and not a romantic one, but she really enjoyed getting to know me, and thinks I'm very sweet etc. etc. etc.

I don't know... I've heard this stuff before, and it always guts you a bit. I think this one just came so far out of left field, and we seemed to be on the same page, so it cut a bit deeper. Honestly even the wording is almost verbatim something I have heard from women before, and it is getting into my head a bit. I keep telling myself it's not me, as I've had multiple romantic partnerships in the last couple years. This one just felt so immediate and different.

I told her that I'm not one for closing doors, so if she feels differently I would enjoy hearing from her and she said ""If I change my mind you are the first one I'll call!"" Which felt like a pretty odd choice of words. There is an invasive part of me that wants to dig deeper and try and get answers from her, but those things never seem to go well.

I think for the future I want to know how I can avoid giving a ""friend vibe"" or if that isn't possible, do I just need to not get invested in the early stages? Thanks for reading if you made it this far, and I'm here to offer more context if anyone wants!",3,1762346875.0,dating_advice,2,1.0,False

\- A barista told me that there was this regular who told her that he was interested on taking her out but he didn't want to disappoint his gf if she finds out

\- I witnessed coworkers (married) flirt with other people or say something that doesn't seem like they're in a committed relationship

\- Just found out that my friend is a lust-driven cheater who just tormented this girl for 3 years until he got back with his ex (who also enabled and was in it--trying to get him back while he was still in a relationship)

Not long ago, I earned my PhD in Mechanical Engineering. I live in Serbia for reference, and recently, purely by chance, through one of my research papers I received a job offer from Switzerland (I haven’t yet decided whether to accept it).

I’m curious about what life is really like there. Is it truly as people from the Balkans often describe, that people are cold, that it’s not like it used to be, that this or that isn’t good, and so on? Personally, I don’t know anyone in my close circle who lives there or in another so called “diaspora country” who went there with academic or technical knowledge. I do know a few people who moved abroad for so-called “commoditized” jobs, meaning mostly minimum wage or slightly above min. wage salaries and when I asked them recently (though I probably shouldn’t have), I got the same kinds of answers you usually hear when chatting over coffee whcih are along the lines of the ones I mentioned above.

To keep it brief, I’d like to know specifically:

1. What are the working conditions (especially for engineers) and the general living conditions like? What is the real standard of living compared to the costs (I’m single and not planning to get married)?

2. How do they perceive people from the Balkans?

3. Is it worth moving there long-term? For those of you already there, what are your experiences, recommendations, and advice? What challenges have you faced? Are you considering moving back?

I’d really appreciate hearing from those who live or have worked in Switzerland, as well as anything else you think might be important for someone to know before coming.

Thanks in advance to everyone who shares their thoughts.",3,1762346594.0,AskBalkans,14,1.0,False

Instead of seething on r/conservative, pause .... Look around. Listen to your neighbor. Control your president. Trump set the standard for new elections. You can't believe Jay Jones won? I can. Remember when trump was elected president after imitating the handicap reporter? I do. 

Having the power doesn't mean you will maintain support. The republican party best reach across the isle and collaborate with Democrats to get things done for the better of this country. Stop the ""them vs us"" mentality. 

Stop the gaslighting. Stop the grandstanding and virtue signalling. Republicans have 1 year to wake up and smell the coffee. America sent a resounding message last night. LISTEN TO IT.

## Why Choose an All-Inclusive Holiday in Marrakech?

When you think of Marrakech, you might picture navigating the labyrinthine souks and haggling for treasures. While that's an essential part of the experience, an all-inclusive package offers a different, equally valuable kind of magic.

*   **Unbeatable Convenience:** The biggest draw. Your meals, drinks, and often a host of activities are pre-paid. No surprise costs, no need to carry cash around the resort, and absolutely no stress about budgeting for food and drinks each day.
*   **Budget-Friendly Predictability:** You know the exact cost of your holiday before you even leave. This makes financial planning a breeze, allowing you to simply enjoy your time without constantly checking your bank account.
*   **A Perfect Blend of Relaxation and Adventure:** Use your resort as a tranquil sanctuary. After a day exploring the sensory explosion of Jemaa el-Fnaa square, you can return to your peaceful oasis to relax, recharge, and enjoy a world-class dinner.
*   **Ideal for Everyone:** Whether you're a family looking for kids' clubs and pools, a couple seeking a romantic retreat, or a group of friends wanting a base for adventure, there's an **all-inclusive in Marrakech** that fits the bill.

## Top All-Inclusive Resorts in Marrakech (And What Makes Them Special)

While we won't name specific hotels (as quality can change), we'll guide you on what *types* of resorts to look for based on your travel style.

👉 [Find the Best Flights & Hotels for Your Next Trip
](https://govacation.pages.dev/)

### ### For Ultimate Luxury & Pampering
Look for 5-star resorts that describe themselves as having a ""palatial"" or ""traditional riad"" feel. These often boast incredible spa facilities (including authentic hammams), multiple gourmet dining options, immaculate gardens, and perhaps even a private golf course. You're paying for top-tier service and an opulent atmosphere.

### ### For Fun-Filled Family Breaks
Seek out larger resorts that actively advertise kids' clubs, children's pools, and water parks. These are designed with families in mind, offering a schedule of activities for all ages and entertainment that's kid-friendly in the evenings. It means the parents can relax knowing the kids are safe and entertained.

](https://govacation.pages.dev/)

### ### For a Quiet, Adults-Only Escape
If your idea of a holiday doesn't include splashing children, look for resorts marketed as ""adults-only"" or those that have designated quiet zones and adults-only pools. These tend to be more focused on tranquility, wellness, and romantic ambiance.

## Beyond the Buffet: Must-Do Excursions from Your Resort Base

One of the best parts of a Marrakech holiday is stepping outside the resort to immerse yourself in the local culture. Think of your all-inclusive package as your comfortable basecamp for adventure.

👉 [Find the Best Flights & Hotels for Your Next Trip

*   **The Medina and Souks:** You can't go to Marrakech without this. Hire a trusted guide for your first visit to navigate the maze-like alleyways, discover hidden artisan workshops, and experience the energy of Jemaa el-Fnaa at sunset.
*   **Jardin Majorelle:** A stunning, cobalt-blue oasis of calm and beauty. The vibrant garden, created by French painter Jacques Majorelle and later restored by Yves Saint Laurent, is a feast for the eyes.
*   **Atlas Mountains Day Trip:** Escape the city heat for a day. Tour the stunning mountain landscapes, visit traditional Berber villages, and enjoy a mint tea with a local family with the breathtaking peaks as your backdrop.
*   **Agafay Desert ""Rock"" Desert:** Can't make it to the Sahara? The Agafay Desert is just a short drive away. Experience the vast, stony plains on a camel ride or from a luxury desert camp, complete with a traditional dinner under the stars.

If you're reading this, it's because I have no other choice. Nobody will listen to me, not even the police. It's only a matter of time before they come for me, and when they do, this is the only evidence of the truth. There is something under the boardwalk in Paradise Point, and it's hungry.

October is always a terribly slow month. We're barely open, but the owners want to squeeze every penny they can before this town is completely empty. Even on a Friday night, it's already a ghost town. That's where this all began — a cold, deafeningly quiet night at the record shop I spend my days working in.

""Spectre's: Records & Rarities""; a store that really was dead in the water until vinyl made a huge comeback. We also sold shirts that you might find a middle schooler wearing, even though they wouldn't be able to name a single song off the album they're donning. It really was a place frozen in time — the smell of dust and the decay of better days always filled the room.

The best way to pass the time on a night like this would be to find a forgotten record to play. That was my favorite game — finding an album I'd never heard of and giving it a chance to win me over. After all, if I'm not going to play them, who will?

Tonight's choice: ""Secret Treaties"" by Blue Öyster Cult. Of course, I knew ""Don't Fear the Reaper"" — who doesn't? I never sat down and listened to their albums, even though their logo and album artwork always intrigued me. I retired the familiar sounds of ELO off the turntable and introduced it to something new. 

Seeing the album made me think of my dad. I remember him telling me about seeing them live with Uriah Heep at the old Spectrum in the 70's. I bet he still had the ticket stub, too. God, he loved that place. I even remember seeing him shed a tear the day they tore it down.

The opening chords of ""Career of Evil"" blared out of my store speakers as I dropped the needle. Had my mind not been elsewhere, I wouldn't have startled myself into spilling my coffee. The previously white album cover and sleeve were now browned and tainted. Who would want it now? Looks like it was coming home with me. After all, a song titled ""Harvester of Eyes"" certainly had a place in my collection. The owner wouldn't care anyway — he had jokingly threatened to set the store ablaze for insurance money. Had this shop not been attached to others on this boardwalk, I wouldn't have put it past him.

The opening track sold me, and given the state of business, I decided it was time to close up shop. The only thing louder than BÖC was the ticking clock that sat above an old ""Plan 9 From Outer Space"" poster. Just as the second track reached its finale, I lifted the needle. I retrieved one of our spare plastic sleeves to prevent any more damage and stowed it away in my backpack.

I took a walk outside to see if there were any stragglers roaming the boards. All I could see was a long and winding road of half-closed shops and stiffened carnival rides lit only by the amber sky of an autumn evening. Soon it would be dark, and the boardwalk would belong to the night and all that inhabited it.

The garage doors of the shop slammed shut with a finality that reminded me of the months to come. The sound echoed around me, only to be consumed by the wind. It wasn't nearly as brutal as the gusty winter months, but it swirled with the open spaces as if it were dancing with the night. The padlock clicked as I scrambled the combination, and I turned to greet the darkness that painted over the beach. Summer was truly over now.

The soundtrack of carnival rides, laughter, and stampeding feet was replaced with the moans of hardwood under my feet. Each step felt like I was disturbing somebody's grave. That was the reality of this place — four months out of the year, it's so full of life that it's overwhelming. The rest of its time is spent as a graveyard that is hardly visited. Maybe that's why I never left. If I don't visit, who will?

Speaking of visiting — this was the point of my trek home that I saw Bane. They called him that because he was a rather large man, built like a hulking supervillain. In reality, he was as soft as a teddy bear but, unfortunately, homeless. Even from the distance I saw him — which was two blocks away — there was no mistaking him. I only ever saw him sparingly; he never stayed in the same place for long and often slept under the boardwalk. I often thought he was self-conscious of his stature and didn't want to scare people.

I could see that he must have been taking in the same swirling twilight sky I had seen earlier. Now, he was merely entertaining the stars. Looking to my left, I saw that Vincent's Pizzeria was closing up shop. They must have had a better run of business than I did.

I slinked over to the counter to see a solitary slice looking for a home in the display case. The girl working the counter had her back to me, and as I began to make an attempt for her attention, she screamed.

""Oh my god! You scared me!"" she gasped.

Chuckling nervously, I apologized. ""I'm sorry, I just wanted to grab that slice before you closed up.""

I made an honest try at a friendly smile, and she laughed.

""Sure, sure. Three bucks.""

As she threw the slice in the oven to warm it up, she turned her attention back to me. ""So, any plans tonight?""

I thought about it, and I really didn't have any. I knew my ritual at this point — work and then visit Mick's for a drink or two until I've had enough to put me to sleep.

""I was going to head over to Mick's, maybe catch the game for a bit.""

She grinned. ""I know Mick's — right around the corner, yeah? Maybe I'll stop by. There isn't much else to do on a night like tonight.""

I handed her a five and signaled to her to keep the change.

""Maybe I'll see you there,"" I said half-heartedly, giving one last smile as I departed.

She waved, and I focused my attention on the walk ahead. She seemed plenty nice — might be nice to interact with someone. First, I had something I wanted to do.

Bane was right where I last saw him, except now he was gathering his things. I approached him with some haste.

""Hey bud, I haven't seen you in a while.""

When he turned to see it was me, a smile grew across his face. ""Hey Mac, long time.""

In my patented awkward fashion, I continued. ""It's been dead out here, huh?""

Without looking up, he lamented, ""Sure has. It's that time of year. Certainly not going to miss it.""

Puzzled, I pressed him. ""What do you mean?""

Once he finished packing his bag, he sighed and his baritone voice continued. ""I need to get some help. I'm going to go to that place in Somerdale and finally get myself clean.""

He sounded so absolute in what he was saying. I couldn't have been happier.

""That's great, man! I'd give you a ride myself if I had a car.""

I chuckled — that really did make my night.

He took another deep breath. ""I just need to see her again.""

He revealed a small photo in his pocket, presenting it in his large hands. The picture showed a newborn baby girl in the hands of the man in front of me.

""I haven't really seen her since she was born. Once I lost my job and... everything just started falling apart..."" he trailed off.

He shook it off to say, ""I'm just ready. Tonight's my last night — I have my bus ticket ready to go, first thing in the morning. I just thought I would take in one last sunset and say goodbye to the others. I saved enough money to get me one night at The Eagle Nest.""

I was hard-pressed to find words. I didn't know he had a daughter. It was a lot to take in, but above all, I was so thrilled to hear what he was setting off to do.

Remembering what I had in my hands, I spoke up. ""Vincent's was closing up, and I thought you could use a bite. Since this is going to be the last time I'll see you, I won't take no for an answer.""

We both smirked. He reached up for the quickly cooling slice of pizza.

""That's really nice of you, Mac. I appreciate it.""

Not sure what else to do, I shot my hand forward to him for a shake. ""I really think what you're doing is great. It's been nice knowing you.""

He reached his enormous paw to mine and shook it. ""You too. I'd say I'll see you again, but I really hope it's not here.""

He chuckled as he swung his bag onto his back. I smiled back and waved goodbye. As we made our separate ways, a question occurred to me.

""Hey, what's your real name, by the way? Maybe I'll look you up someday to see how you're doing.""

Without turning fully around, he said, ""It doesn't really matter.""

With that, he retreated into the night and left me to wonder what he meant by that.

I was soon reaching the block where Mick's resides. The pub was right off the boardwalk — the neon lights that illuminated nearby were shining across the face of The Mighty King Kong ride. Thankfully, my work and home were all within a short walk of one another. Mick's served as the ever-so-convenient median between the two. Mick's was also where I picked up shifts in the offseason. They must have noticed the frequency with which I visited and decided to offer me a job. It was a solid gig — Mick's was one of the few year-round places on the island. Locals gravitated toward it once the summer crowds dissipated. If I was going to spend my time there, I figured I might as well get paid.

Just as I was rounding the corner to the off-ramp, something happened. A loose board that hugged the wall greeted my sneaker and sent me tumbling down. All this tourism revenue, and this damn boardwalk is still old enough for Medicare.

I turned over onto my side to see where my backpack had landed. It was adjacent to the culprit. I groaned as I reached over to grab it — when something caught my eye.

Along the wall, hiding just below the wood, I saw what looked like a wasp's nest. It was peeking out from the dark at me, almost as if it was watching me. I peered at it with the light of the pub guiding me.

This wasn't a wasp's nest.

It was a sickly pale yellow. Its texture looked wet, almost as if it was hot candle wax burning from a flame. Maybe the fall had disoriented me, but I could swear I saw it moving — rising and falling ever so subtly. Like it was... breathing?

I adjusted my eyes as I leaned in. It wasn't very big — maybe the size of a tennis ball. It was riddled with holes, craters that left very little room for much else. I couldn't help but glare at them.

Then it happened.

They blinked at me.


Part 2

I jumped back. I pushed myself off the loose board, propping myself up against the concrete. The wood must have knocked whatever it was off the wall. I turned my eyes back to the mass only to find it was gone, leaving only a trail of faint fluid in one direction; under the boardwalk. Then, only silence. The sound of my rapidly racing heart was all that was left. What the hell was that? Did it really blink at me? I had to have been seeing things, I just had to. If that was a dead nest, why wasn't it thin and papery? The more I thought of its texture, the more I started to feel nauseous. If there were ever a time I needed a drink, this was it.

I began walking in a daze, listlessly on auto pilot. Only the buzzing sign above guided me to my destination, like a moth to a flame. I pushed the bar doors open to find an empty cavern. Only the sound of the reverberating juke box rang about the building. ""Hello, It's Me"", Todd Rungren, the ghosts around here had good taste. The dim lighting hid the architectural bones of the building. In typical Paradise Point tradition, this was yet another aging wonder. On quiet nights like this one, you might hear the remnants of good times past. Sometimes, it even felt like the seat next to mine was taken, even if nobody was there. For now, it was just me and my echoing footsteps.

I hadn't sat for more than what felt like a few seconds before Tommy asked me for my drink. I snapped out of it, ""What's that?"".

""Your drink, Mac. What would you like to drink?"" he said, gesturing in a chugging motion.

""Oh, um, just grab me a shot of the usual, please.""

With that, he made his way to the far end cooler. Blackberry brandy, a local delicacy. Never had it before I moved down here, but it quickly became my drink of choice. If your local watering hole doesn't keep a bottle or two in their frostiest cooler, don't bother. A warm shot of this might as well be a felony.

Tommy poured a heavy hand into the glass in front me, ""It's on me, buddy."" He poured another for himself and we clinked our glasses. 

""You alright, man? You look like you've seen a ghost.""

That nauseous rot in my stomach returned. The hum of the lights above me seemed to grow louder in sync with my thudding heart. How would I even have begun to explain what I had just seen? Before I could formulate a lie, he had to greet a new bar patron. My eyes followed suit to find that it was a familiar face. There she was, the girl I had just seen at Vincent's.

""Do you come here often?"" she said with a faux twang accent, pulling up in the vacated seat next to me. 

""I-uh... reckon."" I said coyly, channeling my inner John Wayne.

""Looks like we have the place all to ourselves,"" she remarked with a grin.

""Tommy better not leave the register unattended, there must be a whole 50$ in there."" I quipped. 

She laughed. ""Perfect, just the right amount to start a new life with.""

She presented her mixed drink to me for a cheers, only for me to realize my shot was empty. Suddenly, as if telepathically summoned, Tommy was there pouring into my glass mid air. Talk about top notch service.

 ""Here's to..."" I trailed off.

""Here's to another summer in the books,"" she declared.

I nodded my head and followed through with my second dose of medicine.

She then continued, ""So are you local year round?""

I shook my head yes and clarified, ""Haven't always been. This is going to be the second winter I stay down here. How about you?""

She then proceeded to explain that she was back in school, her father owned Vincent's and she was only helping on weekends until they closed for the year. She was a nursing major, in the thick of her training to become certified. I listened intently; she seemed like she had a plan. I discovered we were the same age, 23, yet on completely different avenues in life. She was at least on a road, I haven't been on one for miles.

""Enough about me, what are you up to?"" A question I was dreading. I answered very plainly, ""I don't know.""

After a brief silence, I involuntarily laughed. ""I'm just trying to figure somethings out. It's been a very long couple of years.""

I think she could see the fatigue on my face. ""Do you want to talk about it?""

I shook it off. ""Not particularly, it'll pass. Just a matter of time.""

I noticed she must have gone home and changed, she was no longer in her generic east coast Italian pizzeria shirt. She was wearing a faded Rolling Stones shirt under her plaid long sleeve. I saw my opening and quickly changed the subject.

""Hey, I love that shirt. I work over at Spectre's, actually. We have one just like it.""

She looked down and declared. ""That's hilarious, that's where I stole this from!""

We both laughed.

""It wouldn't surprise me,"" I remarked. ""The staff there is terrible, someone needs to be fired.""

Our laughter echoed in the empty bar, only now mixing with the sound of a different song — ""These Eyes"" by The Guess Who. The ghosts never miss. 

She continued, ""The Stones are my dad's favorite band. He named me Angie after the song."" 

I liked that, it fit her.

""My dad loved them too,"" I concurred. ""He took me to see them when I was a kid.""

She smiled. ""Sounds like a great dad to me.""

I averted my gaze and wanted to change the subject. Then it hit me — maybe she'd like the album I took home. I began to reach for my bag only to find that it was missing something; the record.

My eyes went into the distance, suddenly being brought back to the reality that was my night.

""Everything okay?"" she inquired.

""Yeah, I just took an album home tonight and I think I might have left it behind.""

Then a thought chilled me to the bone. Did it fall out of my bag when I fell on the boardwalk? It was a white album, I would've seen it, right? Unless... did it slip between the cracks? My mind raced for a moment before she said, ""Looks like I'm not the only person on the island with the 5-finger discount at Spectre's.""

I snapped out of it and gave a half-hearted chuckle. I looked at my phone — few missed calls, few texts I didn't care to answer. It was getting close to 11; I had definitely stayed longer than my allotted time at Mick's. Besides, I had a girl at home that didn't like to be kept waiting — Daisy, my German shepherd. She was no doubt worried sick where I was.

The thoughts of what I had seen earlier that night began storming upon what was a good mood. I quickly said, ""I have to get going, my dog is home waiting for me and she could probably use a quick walk before bed.""

Angie smiled wide. ""I love dogs! Do you think I could meet her?""

There was a pause. I didn't know if she meant this very moment or in the near future. Either option didn't feel good to me. It was a nice surprise to meet someone who could distract me from my mind this long. What was the endgame here? This girl was probably better off just leaving whatever this was between us right here at Mick's.

""I'm sure you'll see her. I walk her a lot around here, maybe if she's good I'll grab a slice for her this weekend.""

That was the best I could do. It was better than ""Run as fast as you can.""

""Do you need me to walk you home?""

She responded, ""I'm meeting some of my friends at The Pointe, I was going to call an Uber. It's their last weekend of work here, so they want to celebrate.""

Tommy, beginning to close up for the night, spoke up. ""I can wait here with her, I'm still cleaning up. I'll see you tomorrow night.""

With what I was going to do next on my mind, I began to make my way to exit. Just as I was opening the doors, she shouted, ""You never told me your name!""

Without turning around, or even thinking, I responded, ""It doesn't really matter.""

What the hell did I mean by that?

Just as I opened the bar doors, I was greeted by a misty air. The air had taken a new quality — this one was thick. Given the frequent temperature fluctuations this time of year, it was no surprise that a storm was on the way.

I looked down the corridor of street lights that resided on Atlantic Ave. Blinking yellow lights — an offseason signature — and the only illuminating sight on this foggy night. There was a slight rumble in the sky.

As I made my way, my footsteps on the sidewalk echoed into eternity. Each step making me less sure of what I was doing. I made it to the foot of the slope, my shadow growing larger with each step. I peered out to the loose board I had become acquainted with. The fog had passed just long enough for me to see that there was nothing there — just bare naked concrete.

I had felt like a child, frightfully staring down a dark hallway after hearing a bump in the night. I scanned the area — no sight of the album. It was around this time that I noticed it was a full moon. With a storm approaching, that combination would definitely spell for a high tide. If the record was down there, it would be gone by morning. I turned my phone flashlight on and was greeted with more impenetrable fog.

By this point, I could feel the kiss of rain above me. The boom of thunder alerted me to make a decision. I took steps forward into the mouth of the boardwalk, searching the sandy floor — nothing. I turned my attention to the concrete wall; this had to be the spot. 

No sooner had I turned my attention there, a creaking crawl of sound rang out. Was someone above me? I shined my phone upward and saw nothing but the brilliance of the full moon between the cracks.

I took a deep breath and noticed something peeking through the sand to my left. In a shallow grave created by the wind and sand was a white square. I immediately grabbed it. Secret Treaties. Finally, I can get the hell out of here.

I inspected the LP for damage from the fall to find it was relatively unbothered, except for one thing. As I searched for my coffee stain, I was met with a surprise. The faint brown stain was overlapped by a new color.

Black?

There was a jet black streak smeared across the plastic sleeve. To my eyes, It was crusted and coarse, like concrete. I held it close to my flashlight, unable to decipher its meaning.

Just then, another creak. I frantically shun my light in both directions to find the origin. Nothing.

Something did catch my eye — the wall. The clear fluid I had noticed in my early encounter had created a slimy drip down the wall. It led to a burrowing path into the sand. It was as if something had crept in an effort to be undetected. The trail appeared to be thick and deliberate.

Using my light, I traced the journey of the fluid to find it created a path to where I found the album. It led even further. I took slight steps to discover more.

I couldn't stop; my mind was screaming at me to turn back, but my inquisitive feet prevailed. I must have hypnotically walked an entire two blocks investigating when I was stopped dead in my tracks.

I spotted the edge of a sharp corner sticking out of the sand. I knelt down to investigate — it was a photo. I lifted it high and shook the sand. I knew this picture. It was the snapshot of a father with his newly born daughter in his arms.

1op1l9b,https://i.redd.it/1xvttbcimfzf1.png,Behind the smoke of Hashish: Muhammad Asad and the Wise Hashshashi at the Khan-i-Khet caravanserai,"*Muhammad Asad, in his autobiography* ***The Road to Mecca***\*, recalls the following conversation with a strange man on a fateful night at the caravanserai of Khan-i-Khet in southern Iran:\*

The word Zayd uses for 'destiny' is **qisma** \- 'that which is apportioned' - better known to the West in its Turkish form, kismet. And while I sip another cup of coffee, it passes through my mind that this Arabic expression has another, deeper meaning as well: 'that in which one has a share.'

**That in which one has a share** . . .

These words strike a faint, elusive chord in my memory ... there was a grin that accompanied them . . . whose grin? A grin behind a cloud of smoke, pungent smoke, like the smoke of hashish: yes - it was the smoke of hashish, and the grin belonged to one of the strangest men I have ever met - and I met him after one of the strangest experiences of my life  
.............

The caravanserai was one of the many decayed remnants of the epoch of Shah Abbas the Great - mighty blocks of masonry with vaulted passageways, gaping doorways and crumbling fireplaces. Here and there you could discern traces of old carving over the lintels and cracked majolica tiles; the few inhabitable rooms were littered with old straw and horse dung. When Ibrahim and I entered the main hall, we found the overseer of the caravanserai seated by an open fire on the bare ground. At his side was a bare-footed man of diminutive size draped in a tattered cloak. Both rose to their feet at our appearance, and the little stranger bowed solemnly with an exquisite, almost theatrical gesture, the right hand placed over the heart. His cloak was covered with innumerable multicoloured patches; he was dirty, entirely unkempt; but his eyes were shining and his face serene.

The overseer left the room to attend to our horses. I threw off my soaked tunic, while Ibrahim immediately set himself to making tea over the open fire. With the condescension of a great lord who forfeits none of his dignity by being courteous to his inferiors, the odd little man graciously accepted the cup of tea which Ibrahim held out toward him.

Without any show of undue curiosity, as if opening a drawing-room conversation, he turned to me: 'You are English, jawāb-i-āli?'

'No, I am a Namsawi' (Austrian).

'Would it be improper to ask if it is business that brings you to these parts?'

'I am a writer for newspapers,' I replied. 'I am travelling through your country to describe it to the people of my own. They love to know how others live and what they think.'

He nodded with an approving smile and lapsed into silence. After a while he drew a small clay waterpipe and a bamboo rod from the folds of his cloak; he attached the rod to the clay vessel; then he rubbed something that looked like tobacco between his palms and placed it carefully, as if it were more precious than gold, in the bowl of the pipe, covering it with live coals. With a visible effort, he drew in the smoke through the bamboo rod, violently coughing and clearing his throat in the process. The water in the clay pipe bubbled and a biting odour began to fill the room. And then I recognized it: it was Indian hemp, hashish - and now I understood also the man's strange mannerisms: he was a hashshashi, an addict. His eyes were not veiled like those of opium smokers; they shone with a kind of detached, impersonal intensity, staring into a distance that was immeasurably removed from the real world around them.

I looked on in silence. When he finished his pipe at last, he asked me:

'Will you not try it? '

I refused with thanks; I had tried opium once or twice (without any particular enjoyment), but this hashish business seemed too strenuous and unappetizing even to try. The hashshashi laughed soundlessly; his squinting eyes glided over me with a friendly irony:

'I know what you are thinking, O my respected friend: you are thinking that hashish is the work of the devil and are afraid of it. Nonsense. Hashish is a gift from God. Very good - especially for the mind. Look here, hazrat, let me explain it to you. Opium is bad - there can be no doubt about it - for it awakens in man a craving for unattainable things; it makes his dreams greedy, like those of an animal. But hashish silences all greed and makes one indifferent to all things of the world. That's it: it makes one contented. You could place a mound of gold before a hashshashi - not just while he is smoking, but at any time - and he would not even stretch out his little finger for it. Opium makes people weak and cowardly, but hashish kills all fear and makes a man brave as a lion. If you were to ask a hashshashi to dive into an icy stream in the middle of winter, he would simply dive into it and laugh... For he has learned that to be without greed is to be without fear - and that if man goes beyond fear he goes beyond danger as well, knowing that whatever happens to him is **but his share in all that is happening...**'

And he laughed again, with that short, shaking, soundless laughter between mockery and benevolence; then he stopped laughing and only grinned behind his cloud of smoke, his shining eyes fixed on an immovable distance.",16,1762345974.0,IslamicHistoryMeme,1,1.0,False

So im opening this morning, mostly because nothing really happens here until 10 so theirs no need for more then one person to wake up early and then this man come's in, i wanna say he was like 55? 56? Years old, so i walk over to the register and before i can even finish saying goodmorning he waves his hand in like a dismissive manner ""get me a black coffee"" this already ticks me off a little, but everyone is allowed to have a bad morning so i shrug it off. I ring him up, he pays and then this grown ass man looks me dead in the eyes, smiles and says ""im going to go sit by the window so i can get a good look at all those young girls"" now, ive never had anyone say some shit like that to my face so my brain just kinda shut down deciding wether i heard him right and i kinda just stare at him, i think he noticed this and stopped smiling and actually went to sit by the window. 

And its like ABSOLUTLY FUCKING NOT??? DONT TRY AND MIX ME INTO THAT DISGUSTING FANTASY YOU DISGUSTING ANIMAL, DID YOU EXPECT ME TO SUPPORT YOU?? and the only reason i didnt report the guy to any kind of authority is cause the camera's we have dont capture audio.

I bleached my hair and dyed it bright pink with semi permanent color, then when it was faded but still there I put a coffee type of brown that was semi permanent but I didn’t like the color. So I put the same color of brown again the next day. Still wasn’t as dark as wanted to so I put a dark brown glaze a few days after that was supposed to be used on virgin hair only  and leaved it on for 40 minuets instead of 10-20. It came out as magenta. I ordered more of the coffee brown semi permanent l dyes and plan to add a bit of a green toner to cancel the red toners and conditioner so I have a mixture. But I bought this color and it’s exactly the color I want and need for school as I can’t have unnatural  colored hair  for school until I’m 16. Although this is a permamant color and not semi permanent, I only use semi permanent’s so I don’t damage my hair. If I used this color how hard would it be to bleach my whole head again in a couple of years and how would the damage look like? Also if I did use this color how would I use it, should I just put it on top of my slightly magenta hair or wait until the green toner.

I wanted to give some input and context for first time buyers, like myself. 

I see a lot of questions here asking for machine recommendations and opinions. Often there is a lot of budget but not always a good idea of what you want out of a machine, or where they are coming from. 

I used a Nespresso machine for many years. And the last 5 years a lattissima one. No complaints there. Nespresso is consistent and you know what you’re getting (especially with original line). 

But my girlfriend and I drink cappuccinos regularly (2+ each per day). And taking apart and cleaning  the 5 part milk steamer after every cup got tedious. 

I wanted to make that easier and didn’t mind getting rid of pods either. 

I didn’t want to break the bank and saw a good deal for a Philips Lattego 2300. A machine not liked much on this sub. 

My first two weeks have been nothing but positive. The coffee is quite good, espresso certainly being a lot better than Nespresso. The milk steamer is easy to use and does a similar job (not amazing, but pretty good).

So the takeaway is: Look at where you’re coming from and what you need. 

I now know how these machines work and what to expect, and didn’t break the bank finding out (250€). It certainly doesn’t hurt trying with an entry level Philips to see what you feel and what you need. Don’t let YouTube reviewers drive you crazy",3,1762345310.0,superautomatic,1,1.0,False

Also, **27-37 years old** , someone warm, caring, nice, grounded, endless thoughtful, and just as pleasing to the eyes as the scenery I adore. 

Bonus if you are:
- well dressed: clean, stylish, and just the right amount of classy 👌🏻
- Single. Not in a romantic relationship whatsoever. Never been married. (Best if you can provide a **CENOMAR** when we meet 😂)
- No human kids 
- Christian (genuinely God-fearing)
- Not a DDS / Uniteam supporter too 😌
- Love and/or have dogs
- Enjoy spontaneous long drives
- Can appreciate the charm of bookstores and late-night cafés
- From **Cebu City  or Mandaue City** (easier for coffee dates and spontaneous drives). 

If this sounds like you…
Send me a message and tell me more about yourself such as what do you look like, important aspects in your background, current work, and/or your long-term goals, AND your go-to coffee order too!

Thank you for taking time to read until this point. Kindly include the word cheesecake when you message me so I would know!

Will ignore messages na walang ka effort 🙅🏻‍♀️ Puhlease, may effort naman post ko, hope you’ll reciprocate ha 😇

- Lost 6.2 lbs from start to finish. It was day 1 lost about 2lbs, day 2 was about 3, and the rest on day 3. Most of this was not fat, but just food stores and water. I’d say’s probably 4 lbs. The rest was fat and probably a bit of muscle mass. I did light gym on day 1 and day 2. It sucked, but I think helped. 

Tips that helped me: 
- Water with a tea bag. This was some serious help. 
- Strong black coffee. This was helpful because it suppressed my appetite. 
- Carrying my jug of water also helped a ton. Any sign on a little hunger, I just chugged water. 

Something that felt weird was adding salt to the water. For some reason it made the water feel a little bit oily or greasy. 

But anyhow, I’ll be doing another 3 day at some point in November. I’ve reached the conclusion that it’ll be worth doing one once a month or once a quarter for health benefits.

1op1bod,https://i.redd.it/mm4doe7fifzf1.png,Curious What TCM Says About Your Health? Snap a Pic of Your Tongue and I’ll Tell You,"Based on the tongue coating image, TCM holds that this lady's body shows signs of ""blood deficiency"" and ""spleen and stomach weakness.""

So in TCM, **“**blood deficiency”is kind of like when your body’s running on an empty tank — not enough good nutrients flowing around. And if your digestion is weak , that makes things worse because your body can’t absorb what it needs.

Here’s how to fix both — using normal food + easy habits:

1. Eat Smart: Be Kind to Your Stomach, Build Energy at the Same Time

TCM tip: If your digestion sucks, avoid heavy, greasy foods — go for stuff that's easy to break down.

✅ Good foods to focus on:

Grains: Millet, pumpkin, and yam — all super easy to digest. Try them in oatmeal or mashed up.

Protein: Lean beef, chicken, eggs, black beans, red beans — these help rebuild energy + healthy blood (and yes, they’re normal grocery store foods).

Veggies: Spinach, carrots, pumpkin — especially spinach, which TCM says helps build blood.

Fruits: Cherries, grapes, and (if you’re into it) a few red dates a day — great for energy and digestion.

❌ Things that mess up digestion or drain energy:

Ice water, ice cream, cold smoothies, sushi — cold stuff slows digestion in TCM.

Too much coffee or tea — 1 cup is fine, just don’t drink it on an empty stomach.

Fried or super-sugary food — TCM believes these clog digestion and block energy.

2. Lifestyle Stuff That Actually Helps

Sleep before 11 PM – Sounds basic, but TCM says midnight is “body repair time.” Late nights = low energy.

Don’t skip breakfast – A warm one is best (like oatmeal or eggs), gets your stomach working right.

Eat slow AF – Chew more. Your stomach will thank you.

3. Exercise… but Chill

Skip intense workouts if you’re already exhausted — that just burns through your energy.

Try walking, yoga, light stretching, or even “Ba Duan Jin” (a super simple Qigong routine). 20–30 mins a day is perfect.

4. Stop Overthinking Everything (Seriously)

TCM says overthinking = lost energy. Sounds fake until you realize how drained you feel after spiraling in your head.

Take 10 mins a day to zone out. Sunbathe. Listen to lo-fi music. Do nothing. It helps.

Give it a try for a week or two — it’s simple stuff, but the combo really does help with energy, digestion, and just not feeling like trash all the time.

Looking for quiet places and good energy.,"Visited Asheville last year and didn’t expect the mountains to hit like they did. All this time, I didn’t know how much I needed that. Being from the busy city life, I did not appreciate the beauty of nature.

My partner and I are heading to Brevard 11/22-11/25, hoping to land somewhere with the same kind of pull. I heard about the beautiful waterfalls. We’re not looking for crowds or the usual tourist loops. We’re more into the quiet side of things. Nature with presence. Food that feels like it matters. Views that don’t need music over them to mean something. And I love crossing paths with people who feel the same.

If you live in the area and know the right trails, waterfall spots, or places to sit with a drink and a view, I’d appreciate your insight and recommendations. Even better if it’s something a little off map.

And if you’re local and open to company, whether for a coffee, a walk, or just to point us in the right direction, I’d welcome that too. I love crossing paths with people who feel the same. DMs are open. No pressure. Just want to make sure I do not miss any of the beauty the area has to offer.",2,1762345118.0,Brevard,2,1.0,False

In the hush of predawn, 
brooms whisper secrets to the tiles, 
sweeping away yesterday’s dust, 
while water cascades in rhythmic absolution, 
polishing the floors to a quiet gleam. 
I emerge from steam kissed showers, 
sip the bitter elixir of coffee, unfamiliar yet fortifying, 
and slip into the velvet dark toward class, 
stars still winking overhead. Some say on your special day you should relax, 
but I choose the grindstone’s spark, 
forging futures from the forge of now.
