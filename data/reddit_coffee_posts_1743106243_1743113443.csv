1jlf7la,https://www.reddit.com/r/ibs/comments/1jlf7la/eating_oats_for_breakfast_daily_changed_my_life/,Eating oats for breakfast daily changed my life,"I used to struggle a lot to go, since I used to eat cereal or eggs for breakfast. It was hard to get enough fibre.

Ever since I switched to dairy free yogurt and gluten free oats with a cup of coffee daily, it's been so much easier to go. I know coffee can be a trigger but it always helps me and I'll perish before I give up coffee lol.

I don't use the pre-made boxed oats or anything like that. I make my own oats from scratch in a pot, and add my own ingredients to it that make it taste good. It takes literally 10 mins for the oats to cook, most of the time is the water boiling before the oats.

The oats I make:
Gluten free Oats, water, DF milk, cinnamon, nutmeg, chia seeds, nuts (usually walnuts), vanilla extract, a pinch of salt, and real maple syrup. I add a little bit of sugar too. Then I'll add whatever frozen fruits I want later on it's own so I have flavor variety. The fruit is sweet enough hence why I don't add much sugar.

Yes eating oats every day sounds depressing, but if you can learn to make it in a way you enjoy, it's not too bad. It took me some trial and error to figure out an oats I enjoy each day, but I did it. There's also a savory version for oats, but I never tried that yet. 

Hopefully my post can help convince you to try oats, or help somehow. I'm just glad I've been able to go again. ",2,1743113201.0,ibs,0,1.0,False

(Burner account post)

I‚Äôve been in job-hunting mode since August 2024, and let me tell you‚Äîit was brutal. I spent nearly every day scouring LinkedIn, tailoring my resume to each application, and jumping through endless hoops just to be seen. I revised my resume at least 40 times‚Äîand that‚Äôs probably a conservative estimate.

The interview process felt like a full-time job in itself. You get excited about a posting, apply, maybe hear back, and then get funneled into a marathon of assessments, multi-round interviews, personality tests, technical drills, and ‚Äúcoffee chats‚Äù that really aren‚Äôt casual at all. And half the time, they ghost you after everything.

One of the most unreal experiences I had was with a company in downtown Houston. I took my lunch break early‚Äîmind you, I was already working downtown‚Äîand rushed over to their office for the interview. From my perspective, it went great. The hiring manager asked detailed questions about pre-engineered metal buildings, and I confidently shared my hands-on experience.

He told me‚Äîmultiple times‚Äîthat I was the exact kind of candidate they were looking for. He even went on a whole tangent about how impressed he was with my r√©sum√©. At the end, he said he‚Äôd be calling me in for a second round. I left that interview feeling like it was a done deal.

Then‚Ä¶ nothing. Two days passed. No call, no email, no update.

So I did what any curious (and slightly desperate) job seeker would do‚ÄîI Googled him. Turns out, his social media handle was literally named pathological liar. You can‚Äôt make this stuff up. Needless to say, I never heard from him again.

That‚Äôs just one of the many strange and frustrating situations I‚Äôve dealt with over these last several months. But I stayed persistent.

And two weeks ago, I finally received an offer from a company that values my experience and vision. I‚Äôll be joining them soon‚Äîand I couldn‚Äôt be more grateful for the journey it took to get here.

To everyone still in the trenches of job searching: keep going. Advocate for yourself, refine your approach, and don‚Äôt let the weirdos get you down. Your opportunity will come! Be patient! ",2,1743112997.0,interviews,0,1.0,False

‚ÄúDue to GDPR, all our data needs to be hosted within the EU‚Äù.

This is what some of you are hearing on coffee dates.

Mainly from big whale types that have compliance departments breathing down their necks.

I get that it feels like ‚Äògame over‚Äô at that point.

But here‚Äôs what you need to know‚Ä¶

That biz owner you‚Äôre talking to would LOVE to be able to do their thing, without all the compliance BS they have to tiptoe around.

So when they ask you about data hosting, in their heads they‚Äôre thinking:

‚ÄúPlease tell me you can ‚Äòtick this box‚Äô so we can move on to the real stuff I‚Äôm actually interested in‚Äù

So, where do you go from here?

**1) TALK TO THEIR SALES POLICE**

They hire compliance people for a reason. It‚Äôs their job to figure out how that business can make as many sales as possible, whilst still working inside ‚Äòthe rules‚Äô.

Ask the biz owner to speak to their compliance guys or even better‚Ä¶ put you in touch with them.

That way, they can tell you what they‚Äôve done in the past/ are already doing to overcome data hosting issues and then you can see whether there‚Äôs anything you can do to make it work.

**2) GET THE TRUTH ON THE TABLE**

If they looked at all the different software they use within their business, are they truly not using any software that interacts with servers in the US?

Unless they‚Äôve custom-built their own CRM and each bit of software they use from the ground up, the likelihood is that some of the stuff they already use touches multiple servers.

Twilio goes to the US before it comes back to the EU. Any popular ‚Äòoff-the-shelf‚Äô CRM is likely hosted in servers in the US - maybe Amsterdam (if you're lucky).

If we get real here, it is nearly impossible to ensure a completely EU-based solution unless they‚Äôre prepared to build everything in-house.

**3) GAUGE THEIR COMMITMENT**

Before proceeding with any adaptations, make sure they‚Äôre 100% bought in.

You don‚Äôt wanna do a load of work to accommodate them, only to hear ‚ÄúWe‚Äôve changed our mind, we don‚Äôt think this is going to work‚Äù

Encourage the client to test 1,000 leads, even if they express concerns about using US servers or other data concerns. This is super low risk to them as it‚Äôs a negligible amount of leads in the grand scheme of things.

This will allow them to gauge the effectiveness of the process. If they are satisfied, you can then proceed to offer a custom solution.

**4) OBFUSCATE THE DATA**

Data obfuscation is the process of disguising confidential or sensitive data to protect it.

For example:

David becomes dhbrudn. Jamie becomes fjdnrjfn.

They‚Äôd send us the data like that, we‚Äôd do our thing, then ship it back to them‚Ä¶

And turn dhbrudn into David... Etc.

It's quite common with systems and an accepted way of protecting data.

Do I know how to do this? No.

But if the client is a big enough fish for you, it would be worth hiring someone to help you with it because you‚Äôd be able to use it with other whales too.

**5) CHOOSE THE LOCATION OF YOUR SERVER**

It is possible to set up your infrastructure so that all processing occurs within the EU.

In [n8n](http://honeysyed.com/n8n) you can use Redis for the memory and this allows you to choose your server location. That means you can choose a server where that client‚Äôs located and keep the data hosting local.

It can be tricky and it does require tech skills, but is achievable.

But, is it worth it?

Well, not only is AI Automation in demand but there are far too few people who will be willing to 'get it right'.

If you put the effort in, you‚Äôll without doubt be able to mop up the market.

**6) DO A CUSTOM BUILD**

Custom builds would be fully compliant and might involve using tools like n8n and AWS servers, or the client‚Äôs own servers.

If you're not super techy, then you‚Äôll have to hire someone to help and that will involve significant costs.

This is only going to make sense if they‚Äôre prepared to pay a large something like $10k - $20k upfront because it‚Äôs going to be a lot of work.

If they‚Äôre serious, get them to put their money where their mouth is because doing 1-to-1 custom builds isn‚Äôt something we‚Äôd recommend doing.

**7) WALK AWAY**

If every solution you come up with is knocked back, you‚Äôll have to accept they don‚Äôt wanna find one.

Which is your clear sign to walk away and focus your energy on the next client that‚Äôs more willing to

work with you.

I started using faceapp and added that jawline and cheekbone and suddenly I started matching hundreds of women. I guess there was a change in my personality that they noticed. Thanks to catfishing I went to over hundred date with 50+ women in 6 months my schedule was so packed with dates I was forgetting some of them or just had to schedule coffee dates in the morning, lunch dates afternoon and dinner/drink dates evening. Most of the time my touches are slightly subtle meaning I don't put a whole different face but of course it is different and some women get dissapointed so about %60 of time no second dates because there was no ""spark"" lol. But sometimes I try to impress them with personality and my kind manners. There have been many instances where I got second or third dates. To say about %30 of cases end up kiss/make out and only %5 end up with sex.

I must say most women lie to man about personality etc. because average women finds only a very small percentage of man physically attractive. They go crazy around attractive men it is like a switch turns on makes them instantly horny. I also opened a women catfishing account and first 20-30 profiles were attractive top men and my research on instagram when I found name of these man showed that these attractive man share and rotate the same women as these women and man have been following each other on insta.

Anyway wish me luck because I have a date today, tomorrow and weekend is full of dates! Since sunday I have been to 4 dates and they all didn't feel ""connection"" and ended the date in an hour but maybe one of them will give this ugly face a chance!

I've been interested in penpalling ever since I was a kid - back in the days before you could more easily meet someone from half way across the world sooner than a neighbor a few doors down. I've been fortunate enough to have had a few before, mostly focusing on item exchanges, letters, and the occasional postcard, and I'd like to see if I can find that again, being able to live those experiences and to also give that to someone else as well.

I'm looking for someone that I first and foremost relate to on a personal and deeper level. *My ideal is to actually get to know my penpal* \- cold exchanges are less interesting to me, but aren't completely rejected. Location doesn't matter as much, as who the person is defines whether I'd like to connect with them or not. That being said, I do have a preference for cultural exchange and differences. Part of why I like penpaling is to be exposed to things I otherwise wouldn't be and to allow that for someone else as well. But, whether you're in my state or half the world away, it's you, the person, I want to exchange with.

On that note, who, exactly, may you be connecting with?

***Basic and personal details of myself and the people I like to engage with:***

I'm 34, male, and from the Eastern US.

*I strive to engage in genuine and authentic discussion* \- it's one of my most desired interaction regardless of the form of relationship. I understand that it can take time to open up and feel comfortable, and this is completely understandable, but my ultimate and ideal goal is to engage in a deep, intimate, meaningful way.

*The complex vulnerabilities within a person are as important as anything else.* Most people have endured some form of trauma or pain, or are subject to some form of mental turmoil or woes. The type of connection I want understands, accepts, and embraces this reality. However, the type of connection I want also strives to live in spite of these things and to heal and advance in a comprehensive and considerate way.

*Creativity and artistry are important to me.* Personally, I engage in more literary arts, primarily writing intellectually, about observations and thoughts, and conversationally, not uncommonly poetically and intensely. I can appreciate and admire many different types of expression, whether I involve myself in them or not.

*Ruminating, researching, and coming to understand new things is a major and critical part of my life.* I, by choice, am an autodidact. The motto '*Nitimur in vetitum semper cupimusque negata.*' is a pretty good summary of my intellectual ethics. I deem nothing to be above reproach, and also that there is no outcome in which everyone benefits or avoids misfortunate calamity.

On that, *being high in abstraction, sensation, and an ability to experience things beyond the blunt physical is pretty vital for me.* We're in a written realm of words and cognitive interaction. Needing me right by your side to be able to bond with me, while that may be very nice, defeats the point of this, does it not?

*More casual hobbies of mine include photography, tech, incense, time pieces, archiving, collecting, coffee, and abstraction.* Inquire within if one stands out to you. I'm always surprised by what people consider to be interests and hobbies, so I probably have more I take for granted and didn't list here. I haven't consumed media regularly in years, but used to engage with a lot of it when I was younger, mostly including movies, anime/manga, and video games.

*I'm INTJ and am Type 5.* I only list these psychological evaluations because some people find them important or revealing. Personally, I find many of these sorts of tests to be bunk, although I do like studying myself and other people. It's a fun activity to share with those who are into it.

***More details of my exchange preferences and goals:***

Ideally, I'd like to have a physical exchange, with my preference being letters and items. Due to the private nature of penpaling, however, I'd like us to actually chat a bit and get to know each other before diving right into those physical aspects of it. Let's become familiar with each other to make sure we're a good fit. All that being said, I'm also interested in having e-mail penpals, which I'd be open to in the immediate now. It's more than possible for one form to transition into another or for us to have multiple forms of penpalling going on at the same time, so don't think how we start is necessarily how we'll need to be forever.

My go-to communication method with someone is in the form of lengthy, detailed, intricate paragraphs and pages that delve into a variety of topics and themes. Even when meeting people in less defined ways we sometimes end up becoming de facto penpals due to how long it takes to properly respond to each other. So, if digital exchange is what you're after, this is the style it should take. I'm less particular when it comes to the physical. I've done pages upon pages in the form of letters and postcards in what looked like 8 point font, as well as exchanges that included almost no words at all or even focused exclusively on items or more artsy sorts of communication. The form of our penpalling doesn't matter as much as what works for us. Above all, I'm here to meet a person that I want to engage in penpalling with and not someone to fulfill a word count and dollar amount. What I'm after is connection and intrigue, depth and meaning, and not an extra piece of mail every few weeks.

*Think we could have a great exchange?*

Doppelg√§ngers are loved, but some of my best and most significant connections have been with people I had notable and vast dissimilarities with.

*Have any uncertainties or feel unsure? Leave your hesitations and take the chance.* If you liked anything you read here, there's a very high likelihood of us both gaining and experiencing something wonderful together. Don't doubt yourself or what's possible. The person themselves matters more than the form of penpalling we take on and any specific details.

I've done pages upon pages in the form of letters and postcards in what looked like 8 point font, as well as exchanges that included almost no words at all or even focused exclusively on items or more artsy sorts of communication. The form of our penpalling doesn't matter as much as what works for us. Above all, I'm here to meet a person that I want to engage in penpalling with and not someone to fulfill a word count and dollar amount. What I'm after is connection and intrigue, depth and meaning, and not an extra piece of mail every few weeks.

*Think we could have a great exchange?*

Doppelg√§ngers are loved, but some of my best and most significant connections have been with people I had notable and vast dissimilarities with.

*Have any uncertainties or feel unsure? Leave your hesitations and take the chance.* If you liked anything you read here, there's a very high likelihood of us both gaining and experiencing something wonderful together. Don't doubt yourself or what's possible. The person themselves matters more than the form of penpalling we take on and any specific details. You never know until you take the plunge, and I've certainly been shocked countless times in life by what does and doesn't work.",1,1743112689.0,penpals,0,1.0,False

Not going to say recovery is going to be smooth for you, but even though it was WAY worse than I expected, I'm recovering WAY faster than I expected to.

**Timeline**

* 3/1/25 - My last attack. 12 hours: 6-9/10 pain for 9 hours, 3 hours of 10/10 pain at peak, including vomiting 4x (that was new), delusional.
* 3/4/25 - When I still felt bad (5/10 pain?), I went to ER, and CT scan said ""It must go"". They said if I didn't throw up a popsicle, I could go home and do it outpatient. I didn't, went home.
* 3/13/25 - Consult, scheduled surgery for 3/20/25. Felt pretty good, though sweating a lot.
* 3/15/25 - Cleaned the house for 3 hours, went on a 4 mile hike. Winded, but OK. Having massive night sweats. ü§î
* 3/19/25 - Coffee date! Felt GREAT! ""Baseline normal""
* 3/20/25 - Surgery, 6:30 am. Awoke to hear ""Your GB was ruptured. Part of it died, and was leeching into your liver. I spent an hour scrubbing your insides getting out all the infection"". Spent the night. Needed lots of morphine overnight and through the day. Hard to breath. 3-4 bags of IV antibiotics over the day. Surgeon wonders WTF the ER sent me home that night.
* 3/21-23/25 - Go home, awful night sleep in bed (wedge pillow), tons of pain. 2x Percocet EVERY 4 hours just to be OK. Giant penicillin 2x/day. No appetite, drinking protein shakes, Gatorade. Lots of sweating. Finally shower. Who's freaking body is this!?!?!
* **3/23/25** \- No more Percocet, just Ibuprofen. Walk to my sidewalk, barely make it back. Wondering when the F if I am ever going to poop. Bloated. Friends stop by and I'm exhausted after 20 minutes.
* 3/24/25 - Glory be to god - I poop. It's... different, but it ain't coal. Praise the lord! Walk 10 blocks. Ex-wife and daughter ask if I need a lift home, I pass. Probably look ashen.
* **3/26/25** \- Walked 3 miles with a friend. Friend comes over and we hang out for 4 hours.",3,1743112587.0,gallbladders,2,1.0,False

Was at a coffee shop and the guy next to me paid with some kind of crypto card. Curious, I asked him about it. Turns out he was using a PayFi solution that let him spend crypto seamlessly - the merchant received dollars, he spent crypto, and the whole thing happened instantly with low fees.

THIS is what mainstream adoption looks like. Not complicated DEXs or yield farming - just making payments work frictionlessly.

For those who don't know, PayFi (Payment Finance) integrates crypto payment solutions with traditional financial infrastructure. The market potential is massive considering global payment volume is in the trillions.

I imagine neither the group head nor the portafilter is TOTALLY dry after this, so if I take the portafilter out an hour or so later there's usually a bit of condensation on the inside. Is that okay, or is that a recipe for mold etc down the line?

‚Ä¢ Characters must follow the social norms of the time (gender roles, legal restrictions, societal attitudes).
‚Ä¢ Career paths, relationships, and home life must reflect the era‚Äôs standards.
‚Ä¢ Medical transitioning (transsexual) is possible from the 1960s but costs 20,000 Meows, decreasing in price each decade. The cost does not represent a direct monetary value but rather the time, effort, sacrifice, and financial burden associated with transitioning in each era.
‚Ä¢ Same-sex relationships exist but are illegal/unaccepted until the 2000s-2010s.
‚Ä¢ Interracial relationships exist but are not legally recognized until later decades.
‚Ä¢ Aging should be natural (no immortality cheats, aging off, or unnatural extensions).
‚Ä¢ Play within in-game limitations (no CC, as it‚Äôs early access).
‚Ä¢ If your Sim is Black, Latino, gay, or part of another marginalized group, they can only take low-paying jobs until the Civil Rights Act of 1964 and will face discrimination.

1jlei15,https://www.reddit.com/r/barista/comments/1jlei15/insufferable_coworker/,Insufferable coworker,"My new coworker (he‚Äôs been working with us for about a month) is making my job harder. He makes great coffee, is polite with customers, but communicating with him is just impossible. He‚Äôs constantly teasing, mocking, and being snarky‚Äîlike it‚Äôs all in good fun‚Äîbut it happens so often that it‚Äôs honestly exhausting. He'll just toss stuff at me from behind the counter, he never says ""sorry,"" ""thank you,"" or ""please"" to me. Since he has more experience as a barista, he often criticizes my work‚Äîand it‚Äôs not just giving advice, he literally takes over my tasks and does them his way.  

Today, during the rush, I accidentally pressed the wrong price on the terminal. He came over, pushed me aside, and told the customer, ""Sorry, it‚Äôs her first day."" Later, when there were almost no customers left and I was handing a coffee to a girl, he suddenly asked her, ""Want me to remake your coffee?"" She was like, ""What‚Äôs wrong with mine?""And he said (right in front of me and the lady), ""I don‚Äôt like how it looks, let me make a proper one."" I was so shocked in the moment that I didn‚Äôt even know if he was joking. I immediately went outside to cool down, because I'd just punch him otherwise

When I came back, I ignored him, and he eventually asked:  
""Why so depressed?""
""What do you think?""
""Some coffee spilled on the side of the cup, you should‚Äôve at least poured it again. That‚Äôs why I offered to remake it.""  
""Do you realize that by doing that, you only made things worse and didn‚Äôt help at all?""
[Shrugs and acts like he doesn‚Äôt remember anything for the rest of the day]

I still can‚Äôt get over what happened today. I felt so angry, hurt, and embarrassed‚Äîalmost to the point of tears. I‚Äôm thinking of telling our manager, but I don‚Äôt want to seem pathetic or bother her over something small. There are literally no other employees besides me and him, and we work together almost every day. I don‚Äôt know what to do or how to interact with him‚ÄîI don‚Äôt want to put up with this.

1jlehrf,https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/1jlehrf/time_to_say_goodnight/,Time to say Goodnight,"I woke up to the sound of birds and the soft light filtering through my bedroom window, casting long shadows across the floor from the plants sitting on the sill. The air smelled like coffee‚Äîfreshly brewed, right on time, as always. The automatic coffee maker with a built-in radio‚Äîprobably the best gift my mom had ever given me.

For a moment, I just lay there, breathing it all in. Normal. Safe. Real.

I glanced at my nightstand. The orange pill bottle was there, just like always. My lifeline. Without it, I‚Äôd be lost‚Äîlost in my nightmares, and my morning would be a completely different story. But not today. Today was normal. Or at least, that‚Äôs what I thought.

I jumped out of bed, took a quick shower, grabbed a fresh shirt, poured myself a coffee, and bit into a quick breakfast on the go. Yeah, that day felt amazing.

‚ÄúGood morning, Aaron!‚Äù shouted my neighbour from 4A‚Äîa lovely old lady, I have to say.
‚ÄúMorning, Mrs. Richardson! How are we today?‚Äù I replied.
‚ÄúAaron, stop that. Call me Becky. I‚Äôve told you a thousand times already.‚Äù
‚ÄúI‚Äôll do my best, Mrs. Richardson. Have a good one!‚Äù

I jumped on my bike, parked behind the green bin, and cycled to work as fast as I could. Everything was perfect. I felt amazing.

‚ÄúAnd 7:45 AM on the dot! You‚Äôre better than Japanese trains, bro,‚Äù came a deep voice behind me.
‚ÄúOf course I am, Mark. Have I ever been late?‚Äù I laughed.
‚ÄúNah, never. But man, you‚Äôre nearly 40. Why the hell are you still cycling? Buy a car and do yourself a favour. Trust me, women will come to you, and you can thank me later.‚Äù
‚ÄúSure, bro, sure,‚Äù I said, waving him off as I walked toward the office door.

I had been working at TechCorp for 18 years now‚Äîhalf my life. And I wouldn‚Äôt change a thing. I had a stable job, good friends, an amazing boss, and most importantly, stability. Exactly what I needed, especially lately, since those crazy headaches and nightmares had started.

I finished my work quickly, as always, and took my lunch outside while the sun was still out. And to meet Nicole, of course. We always had lunch together, and today was no different. We had a nice chat, exchanged a few smiles, cracked jokes about our future, and then went our separate ways. And, as always, I walked home wishing those jokes could become reality.

The day ended as quickly as it had started. I watched baseball‚Äînot that I was particularly interested, but baseball is my kind of sport. If you miss something, you‚Äôre fine. Nothing really happens. And it‚Äôs long.

I decided to skip the sleeping pills, hoping the next day would be even better.

‚Äî

When I woke up, it was quiet. No nightmares. ‚ÄúNice,‚Äù I muttered to myself, getting out of bed. I opened the blinds‚Äîit was raining. ‚ÄúDamn,‚Äù I sighed. But I wouldn‚Äôt let the weather ruin my day. I grabbed a fresh shirt and then noticed something odd. No coffee. ‚ÄúHmm, that almost ruined my day,‚Äù I whispered, deciding to grab one at the local caf√© instead.

‚ÄúMorning, Becky!‚Äù I called out to the lady standing near 4C.

She turned to me with a sharp glare.

‚ÄúExcuse me, sir? You mean Mrs. Richardson, I assume? That was just a silly mistake, I hope.‚Äù
‚ÄúOh, I‚Äôm sorry. I thought that you‚Ä¶‚Äù
‚ÄúThat I what?‚Äù she snapped, her eyes stabbing into me.
‚ÄúI‚ÄîI‚Äôm sorry again,‚Äù I stammered, shaken, and hurried down the stairs.

Something felt off.

I cycled as fast as I could, but when I reached the office parking lot, I was met with an unfamiliar voice.

‚Äú7:45 AM? Hmm. Late again, Aaron?‚Äù

‚ÄúNo, sir, I‚Äôm always on time. Better than Japanese trains, as my friend says.‚Äù

‚ÄúWell, seems like you need a better friend. You‚Äôre late. If Japanese trains ran like you, that would be a disaster.‚Äù

From that moment, everything spiralled. The day was relentless. My boss yelled at me more than once, and for the first time, I actually felt like he might fire me. My workload was overwhelming, my headaches unbearable. It was so bad, I even had to skip lunch with Nicole.

I came home exhausted. Completely drained. I barely made it through dinner before popping my pills and crashing into bed.

‚Äî

The next morning, I woke up slowly. I lifted my head, blinking at the bright sunlight streaming through the window. ‚ÄúUff, better,‚Äù I sighed with relief. And there it was‚Äîthe familiar smell of coffee. My morning routine, perfectly intact. Becky greeted me warmly, though I approached her hesitantly. Mark showed up with his usual jokes.

‚ÄúToday is a good day, Nicole,‚Äù I told her.
‚ÄúYeah? That‚Äôs good. I‚Äôm glad,‚Äù she replied, smiling. I wished that smile would last forever.
‚ÄúEven Mr. Carlson is back to his usual friendly self. He was pretty upset with me yesterday. To be fair, I had way too much to do.‚Äù
‚ÄúThat‚Äôs okay. Sometimes we have those moments,‚Äù she said. ‚ÄúYou have to cherish them before they‚Äôre gone.‚Äù
‚ÄúWhat do you mean?‚Äù I asked, confused.
‚ÄúAgh, you wouldn‚Äôt understand.‚Äù

We spent the afternoon together, and I let myself look forward to tomorrow. But I couldn‚Äôt shake the feeling that something was off.

If only I knew.

‚Äî

I woke up freezing.

‚ÄúIn the middle of May?‚Äù I muttered, shivering. Strange. I grabbed my coffee‚Äîcold. Ran down the stairs.

‚ÄúWhere‚Äôs Becky?‚Äù I noticed. She was always outside having her morning smoke by now. ‚ÄúHope she‚Äôs okay,‚Äù I thought as I stepped out the door.

And then everything went wrong again.

My bike was gone. Someone had stolen it. Furious, cold, and in a foul mood, I was forced to take the bus‚Äîthe one thing I swore I‚Äôd never do again.

I arrived late. And this time, I knew it. I sprinted toward the office, diving into my work. Mr. Carlson prowled around, throwing me suspicious glances every time he passed. I braced myself for an explosion.

It never came.

I lived through another shift.

But once again, I missed lunch with Nicole.

‚ÄúWhat a nightmare,‚Äù I muttered. And then I froze.

I had no pills.

It hit me like a punch to the gut. The perfect days? They weren‚Äôt real. The bad days? They were reality. Every time I skipped my pills, everything fell apart. It was that simple. I just had to wake up, take my pills, and sleep without nightmares. And I‚Äôd have my perfect life again.

But how did I wake up?

I rushed home, ignoring everyone on the street. The more I thought about whether I was in a bad dream, the more lost I felt. My apartment felt unfamiliar‚Äîlike a hotel room I had checked into by mistake. The coffee maker sat unplugged. The radio was missing. The orange pill bottle was still on my nightstand, exactly where I had left it.

‚ÄúCome on, Aaron. Wake up!‚Äù I screamed, kicking the air in frustration.

And then, an idea. A terrible, desperate idea.

What if I just took the pills? Maybe I could fix it. Maybe I could go back.

I grabbed the bottle, but the moment I unscrewed the cap, my stomach dropped.

Sleeping pills.

I hadn‚Äôt been avoiding nightmares. I had been chasing better dreams. Every time I took them, I lived in a perfect world. And every time I went to sleep over there, I woke up into this.

Into my nightmare.

The realization knocked the breath out of me. The warm mornings. The friendly neighbours. The good job. Nicole. None of it was real.

My hands trembled.

I needed to go back.

Just one more time. No more needed.

‚ÄúThat‚Äôs it. Time to say goodnight,‚Äù I whispered and swallowed the entire bottle of those fucking pills.",1,1743111437.0,nosleep,0,1.0,False

It's 4:30pm. You and your girlfriend, Anya, are now officially dating. You're chilling at her place, drinking orange juice, and watching tv while she's at work. You're probably gonna take a nap soon. You're kinda tired. You see a weird book on the coffee table. Opening it, this is what you see.

     Dear diary,

     I love my new boyfriend! He's just the sweetest thing ever! Now that we're officially dating, I think it's time to take our relationship to the next level!

     I'm going to cut him open, scoop out his innards, and climb inside him like a tauntaun! Oh, I just can't wait to feel his warmth all around me!

     I told him I was going to work, but I'm actually gathering supplies for the occasion. He's going to be so surprised!

     I know he's going to fight because he doesn't understand that this is an act of love, so I drugged the orange juice! I when he's out cold, I'll tie him up, wait for him to regain consciousness, and then start the fun!

     I should be home by 3:30PM. 3:45PM at the absolute latest. From there, I'll just watch him until he falls asleep.

     Oh, this is going to be so much fun! I can't wait!

Yours truly,

Context: stressed and sleep deprived, often relying on caffeine. Very tough period in my life for last 3 years, finally I am slowly rebalancing my health back.

I got the Earthling mat. Super happy- they added 2 solid thick books for free!

But I dont want to read and persuade myself, I want to exclude placebo!

So normally coffee gives me jolt of energy then spikes cortisol and causes nervousness and anxiety.

Today I drank 2. After first one, I barely felt much... I used the mat for 10 minutes, on the floor- feet on the ground, naked.

Btw how do you clean this thing I noticed dust attaches to it like mad!

So I did not felt anything, tingling and so on. I tested the socket, it showed grounded, so ok.

But then an hour later I was like okay... maybe theres something to it. I felt a bit more calm, maybe a bit more... grounded? lol

like the coffee did not lift me up that much but also did not made me come down a lot as usual.

It is hard to say because I was feeling pretty good today anyway , I meditate and so on.

So who knows? I did once more today 15min during meditation.

I heard people report being tired and wanting to sleep more, its a bit like I felt today too.

Maybe it will rebalance my biological clock so that I finally can rest?

Maybe it will help me heal my vagus nerve and erase anxiety?

Maybe it will help with inflammation, or my SIBO gut issues too?

I hope. I hope I will be able to distinguish this from placebo but after all if it will be working, then so be it! I dont care why.

I know how grounded I always felt after being in the forest or walking on the sand. Do we know HOW MUCH ''energy'' is transmitted through the mat? Is this like a constant electricity exchange?

What were your first symptoms/effects of using it guys? some claim its a ''cure all'' thing, lets see haha!

ps. I have very demanding requiring complex analytical thinking job very stresful related to big sums of money I need to be fully aware, so how long should I use the mat? I dont want to be sleeping! But I hope it will help calm me down",1,1743111344.0,Earthing,0,1.0,False

I‚Äôm posting here because I‚Äôm too embarrassed to talk to my friends. They all have the same opinion, and I feel hopeless at this point. I need some fresh advice.

I‚Äôve been in a relationship with my boyfriend for a while now, but I‚Äôm struggling with trust. My first relationship was with a serial cheater (30+ times), and it left me emotionally scarred. When I met my current boyfriend, I was still healing from that trauma, but I found myself constantly doubting him, even though he hadn‚Äôt done anything to give me a reason to doubt. Unfortunately, my doubts led to pushing him away, and eventually, he wanted to break up. I begged him to stay, but just two days later, I found out he had cheated on me with an intern who‚Äôs 10 years younger than him. When I confronted them, she admitted that he had been pursuing her, and they even went out for coffee once while he was still in with me. He said that I pushed him away and he did it because I pushed him and because I was with another person when I started talking to him, he also didn‚Äôt appreciate the fact that I used to have a deep connection with my ex and how I used to send him stuff back when I was in that relationship, sorry for all the details. 

That was supposed to be the end, but then he came back to my workplace a week later and asked to get back together. I was alone, confused, and dealing with my own deep trauma from domestic abuse. I‚Äôve been emotionally drained and my brain feels foggy from everything I‚Äôve been through. I‚Äôve prayed Salat al-Istikhara multiple times, asking God to guide me, and after all that, he stayed.

Despite what my friends say, I felt like I needed him in my life. It‚Äôs been 8 months since the cheating incident, and he‚Äôs been sorry, supportive, kind, and encouraging, but I can‚Äôt seem to shake the memories of what happened. I feel like I‚Äôm constantly torn‚Äîpart of me wants to move on, but another part of me feels like I can‚Äôt let go.

I also feel like I‚Äôm not able to think clearly because I‚Äôm constantly emotionally drained from my past trauma. I‚Äôve struggled to trust him, and I can‚Äôt fully commit to him because of what happened. I feel like I‚Äôm stuck, always questioning myself and my choices but at the same time I love him. 

My family is pushing me to get married, and he wants to meet my parents and get engaged, but I‚Äôve been postponing it because I‚Äôm scared. I want to be certain in my decision, but I‚Äôm unsure whether I‚Äôm holding on to something toxic or if there‚Äôs a chance for growth.

Should I try to give this relationship another chance, or is it time to walk away for my own peace of mind and healing? I really need advice.

Dear \[Agent\]  


\[SUBJECT\]

Set in Singapore, \[BROWN, BROWN EYES\] is a \[WORDCOUNT\]-word literary fiction novel with a central theme of grief and regret as in \[PLEASE LOOK AFTER MOM\], the introspective writing style of \[WEDNESDAY‚ÄôS CHILD\], and the harrowing impact of dementia as found in \[STILL ALICE\].

In 2050s Singapore, an unnamed elderly woman receives food delivered to her door every day from charity volunteers. She regales them with stories of her life and her best friend‚Äîdead forty years but still living strong in her memory. They‚Äôve been best friends since childhood, and their time together shaped her life. But as her stories become more repetitive, and her memories more jumbled, the visits become shorter until finally, she finds the food hung outside her door with no one in sight.

Alone in a world that no longer wants to remember her, she sets out to find her dearest friend‚Äîthe one person who understands her better than anyone else. Her best friend‚Äôs waiting for her, if only she could remember where.

In between moments of clarity, she forgets that her friend is long dead, and the woman is convinced that if she just keeps searching, she'll remember where to go, and finally find her friend. Yet, each street feels eerily unfamiliar, the people she meets cold and unwelcoming, and she can‚Äôt quite remember where or when she last saw her best friend.¬†

For the sake of accurate and realistic representation, portions portraying dementia were crafted with guidance from \[neurology expert\] based in \[country\].

I am a 24-year-old Singaporean currently residing in \[city\]. Death, grief and dementia have played key roles in my life and I wanted to capture it in writing.

After years of playing and DM-ing in virtual tabletop, I longed for the feeling of playing a ttrpg in person with friends again and was fortunate enough to know enough people who felt the same. 

I run a lean game. I have done away with a lot of stuff I felt was necessary to deliver an enjoyable experience in virtual play: 

\-Less visual references, save for illustrations from the setting books.

\-Abstracted combat, theatre of the mind when possible. No grid maps, characters/enemies are loose chess pieces, terrain features are coffee cups, coasters. (this is largely due to running a less tactical game.)

\-I have kept background music for my games, although I am a musician, and enjoy composing for my games, and otherwise curating an interesting soundscape. 

These changes have been painless, so far, for my players and I. While I don't feel that having extra stuff at the table is a distraction, I feel that the absence allows me to focus more on my narration of the game, and frees up my mind for better improvising in my storytelling. Still though, I find myself looking back and wishing I had described the setting more thoroughly, or had remembered to *perform* an NPC better. 

I feel there's always room to improve, and so I seek all suggestions, all flourishes, all dirty tricks. What about your narration, your performance as a DM, your storytelling has worked best for you? How do you remind yourself to describe the part of town your players' characters are in? How do you make an NPC memorable without doing a funny voice or using an illustration? What worked? What didn't work?

***TLDR;*** At a physical game, in-person, what is your narration style likes when it comes to DM-ing? What aspects of your storytelling are you most proud of? ",1,1743110749.0,DMAcademy,0,1.0,False

So it was about five years ago now (yeah i should probably be over it by now). 

Met someone on site (hospital) at work, he worked in a different building, saw an ID badge aswell so didn't think much of it. Was asked out for coffee so i went. We had coffee, we talked it was fine. I offered him a lift home and he invited me in (yeah i'm not very smart honestly) i explained that nothing was going to happen. 

Things were fine, had another coffee and then he wants sex even though i explained it wasn't going to happen. He was like 'its not about the act, its about respecting the person' i still said 'this is not something i do'. 

I don't remember much of the next bit just my clothes being off and he'd locked his door. I feel like i shoild have fought more said no (like actually voiced it). He was bigger than me, he tried to penetrate a few times just caused pain and he couldn't get all the way in. 

He gave up and i was jusy kinda lay there dazed, there was no drugs involved think just shock. He eventually opened the door and let me home so i drove straight home. Didn't tell anyone until maybe a few years ago. Did am STD test etc and i feel like this shouldn't be an issue because i put myself in that situation, it wasn't like i wasn't old enough to know better i was 29 at the time, its not like i was 10 like the first time this happened just feel so stupid. 

And like it doesn't really count as assault because it was my own fault. 

Probably been triggered because i was looking after a student where i work and he felt up my leg and i reported him because what if he does that to a patient, its not about me at that point, i don't really matter ya know?

Then I learned is not burn in but ""persistent images"" and that they go away after a couple hours, but bro for a second there I was so fucked, money's thight now.

I have been taking high-strength Vitamin D for 2 and a half weeks so I am at the start of my process of trying to raise my Vitamin D levels. My iron is also on the low side (38, with acceptable range being 30-400) but the doctor seems ok with it - presumably their thinking os that the Vitamin D deficiency is causing/contributing to the iron deficiency but I don't know.

I read that coffee and chocolate has a large impact on iron and vitamin D absorbtion/utilisation, and I drink a lot of coffee (often 5+ coffees a day).

I was curious whether anyone has tried to quit coffee (including not drinking decaf) and if you found it made any significant difference to your Vitamin D and/or iron levels? üòä

I can't even drink 1 alcoholic drink because I get fat headaches, also get migraines randomly now. All that stuff. When I am doing nothing sometimes I get really nauseous, I can't handle cold exposure anymore, etc. 

I assume I fried my nervous system. I wanted to make a longer more specific post but it keeps getting flagged for some reason so in summary my questions is:

Will I ever be normal again? Can the nervous system even heal? Do I need to take anything specific? I already take alpha lipoic acid, CoQ10, vitamins E B12 and C, gelatin, collagen, acetyl l carnitine, magnesium, etc. Am I stuck like this forever now?

i (24f) have had RA symptoms for five ish years now but wasn‚Äôt able to start treatment until november of ‚Äò23, and honestly, it still feels like RA controls a lot of my life. i‚Äôm exhausted and in pain all the time, even on high doses of methotrexate, humira, and daily meloxicam, and my rheumatologist ramps up or tweaks my treatment basically every time i see him. 

this fall, my mom (who also has RA, fun but irrelevant fact) was diagnosed with a very rare and aggressive kind of cancer, and it became clear pretty quickly that my family needed help as she got rapidly worse. i decided to take a leave of absence from my masters program across the country to move back in with my parents and be my mom‚Äôs primary caregiver as she goes through this battle. i‚Äôve been home with my family since december, and last month, i started working at a coffee shop in town on the days my dad is off work and can be with my mom. my job keeps me on my feet and has a lot of repetitive hand and arm motions, so i‚Äôm always drained and achy by the end of the weekend, even though i genuinely really like making people their silly lil coffees. 

since moving, i‚Äôve been really struggling to keep up with everything around the house, even though the caretaking tasks that i do (like cooking, helping with meds, taking my mom to doctor‚Äôs appointments, etc.) aren‚Äôt very demanding. it‚Äôs so hard to rally the energy to do things like cleaning my bathroom or doing my laundry, especially since my mom needs help with her laundry and such, too, and i‚Äôd rather spend my spoons doing stuff to help her. suddenly the things i could barely manage to do for myself when i lived alone, i need to do for the whole household. i feel like a sorry substitution for my mom, who is used to the household running much more smoothly and often gets frustrated with her own limited capacity, as well as with mine. i feel like my poor dad is trying his best to pick up my slack - he spends his three days off every week running errands and trying to clean. he cooks more dinners than i do, cleans the kitchen more than i do, is always the one to spend chemo days at her side, and is almost always the one to travel out of state to see the fancy specialist oncologist with my mom. 

it feels like i should be doing more than i am. i have three baskets of laundry to fold as i write this, but my wrists are so sore after working this morning that the idea of sucking it up and getting it done makes me start actually tearing up. i know that the mental strain is part of my lack of energy, too - i‚Äôm doing my due diligence with my meds and therapy, but still drowning in it all. 

how do you show up for your family while navigating your own illness? do you have any insight on a manageable cleaning schedule, or easy meal ideas that don‚Äôt require too much chopping or other hand-ouchy movement? are there any low-energy bonding activities that you like doing with your kids/grandkids, any ways i could make my remaining time with my mom count more in a way that wouldn‚Äôt demand too much from either of us? i feel really lost and helpless right now, in a lot of ways (clearly), so truly any ideas on how i can be better for my family would be so, so appreciated. thank you if you read all of this - i‚Äôve never learned how to be concise haha.

I love sugar. Always have. And in large quantities, its never enough lol. Every drink has to be super sweet and I've had at least 2 sweet treats but usually 3-5 a day since...jesus I dunno, highschool tbh. Grabbing an arizona tea on the way to work/school, having an energy drink (or 2) while there, and another arizona or Mcdonalds Sweet Tea on the way home. That kind of thing. My family was the same. You knew mamaw was ""watchin her figure"" when she drank a pack (yes pack) of diet dr. pepper a day instead of the regular. It seemed normal to me.

(I'm not coming for little sweet treats lol they're proof the universe loves us and wants us to be happy, but my issue is that they're not really treats for me they're an every drink type situation.)

I recently started trying to keep track of them and, while I knew it was a lot, was shocked at just how much sugar and calories I consume through drinks alone. And I've tried to cut it out many many times but always half heartedly and never made it more then a few days (genuinely, 3 days is my max) which has led to an increase of anxiety and shame every time I attempt again. But this week marks the second week of no (added) sugary drinks. Non. Zilch. Goose eggs. Coffee is just with sugar free almond milk. Tea is the same. No juices. There are 2 small coke zeros in the fridge I bought at the start in case I just really need a hit lol but those are still there. I have been drinking coffee for over a decade now and never had it without sugar. I just sat down with a cup of black coffee and a splash of the almond milk. I know it sounds dramatic but that sounded impossible just 2 weeks ago. 

This is the longest that I've gone in decades without adding sugar to every drink, and while it was just supposed to be the drinks first and after a few weeks slowly ease into the added sugar everywhere else I've now also just kinda naturally stopped having some kind of desert after every meal as well.   
  
There's still this anxiety in the back of my mind that this won't last and I can't do it, I'll cave and be right back where I was before soon, all that jazz. But right now I'm really proud of myself :') Sorry for the wall of text, thanks for making this far and good luck to everyone else making these changes!",5,1743110107.0,loseit,1,0.86,False

We have been researching like crazy. We are 33 and 37, we do not have work restrictions as far as where we move, we currently live in southern Ohio where the weather is insane all of the time. (We really love Washington but we‚Äôre trying to stay on the east coast because my parents are elderly and I‚Äôd like to be able to get back to Ohio fairly quickly if needed - so our other likes so far are Michigan, Massachusetts, New Hampshire, Vermont but we are open to where ever.) 

I have chronic illnesses and the weather here is kind of killing me. It‚Äôs all over the place all the time. I desperately want to be somewhere that has all four seasons but not in the same day. Names of specific towns would be super helpful! 

Requirements/hopes for us: 

-Lots of nature and space 

-We would love to be close to a lake, water, coast, etc. 

-Preferably within 8-10 hours of Ohio (elderly parents) 

-We prefer cooler weather vs. hot weather so north is probably better for us, but we are open to ideas.

-We would love to find a quaint town with a ton of charm and small town feel (like local butcher shop, bakery, coffee shop, book shop, etc) and friendly people. Our current area is ruled by the old boys club and is ridiculously corrupt and I would really like to be somewhere away from that. 

-We have a lot of pets (I currently run an animal rescue) so a pet friendly area would be great 

-I have a medical marijuana card, so preferably somewhere with medical/recreational marijuana as well

-And we would prefer a not heavily conservative state/area 

-Obviously low cost of living would be great as well 

I know that‚Äôs a lot to ask for, but I‚Äôm hoping someone out there can point us in the direction of the perfect little area for us! We aren‚Äôt in a huge rush, we‚Äôre just hoping to find a few promising towns or areas that we can visit and scope out and then start watching for the perfect property or home to scoop up eventually.

I must say most women lie to man about personality etc. because average women finds only a very small percentage of man physically attractive.

I want to like this shop so much, buttttttt, I want coffee ground fresh, preferably from a local / quality roaster, a barista to put a few moments of care and expertise into my cup.  

Despite it being my new favorite shop to sit in, I‚Äôm not sure I‚Äôll return.  

Anyone have any experience with these machines? Am I wrong? It appears to be an Aguila 440, put the capsule in, a needle injects the water and it looks like it‚Äôs brewed in the capsule.

I‚Äôm really excited to go back to hospitality but a lot of family and friends disagree with my choice- I‚Äôm now back to working in a cafe even with a bachelors. 

Recruitment wasn‚Äôt for me and with the current job market, being a recent grad with no experience, it‚Äôs so difficult to get a job.

My costumers were OBSESSED with the pizzas.

1jlddbh,https://www.reddit.com/r/creativewriting/comments/1jlddbh/a_place_in_heaven/,A Place In Heaven,"Lying there in my Bed as the days first light began making its way through the bedroom window looking at me. Telling me that a new day was upon me! Saying to me that the day is ready for you.

Trying to tell me in its way, that there was a place in this life for you! Setting up in bed there looking out of the window to a another day laying there asking myself 

‚ÄúWhat has life got to give me today? Is there even a place here in life for me?‚Äù

With me not knowing then, that later on I would realize that there is a place in this life for me! But leaving me asking the question why isn‚Äôt there a place in life for everyone!

Thinking to myself seeing the sun as its light glimmered through and around the trees branches just outside of my window as the wind blew through its leaves. As if the sun was trying to tell me something as if it was trying to tell me that today was going to be different. 

But just as that thought left me the quietness of the morning was being overridden with the sound of the neighborhood kids.  Walking by my window making their way to a nearby school seeing and hearing that the early morning sounds was not going away anytime soon. Not really wanting to get out of bed to what would be just another day for me.

 But slowly as I made my way up and out of bed making my to bathroom standing there in front of the mirror looking at myself. Looking a not so feeling to young Girl closing in on 30! Standing there running my hand back through my messed up blonde hair. Thinking to myself standing there looking into the mirror thinking to myself 

‚ÄúWhat could a blue eyed girl do to get through yet another day.‚Äù

 Another day of let‚Äôs see if I can get through this day without questioning myself or Life in itself standing there in the bathroom putting my clothes on asking myself 

‚Äú Do I really want to do this?Do I really want this day to even be here‚Äù 

Making my way into the kitchen turning on the coffee maker! Not really knowing where to even begin until I have had my mornings coffee. Setting down at the kitchen table to the mornings newspaper along with my coffee. Setting there flipping through the pages of the morning newspaper looking at what else the world may have to look forward to. Throwing the newspaper to the side thinking to myself 

‚Äú is there anything left in this Life, was there any faith left in me at all.‚Äù

Knowing that this day was already going to be hard enough as it was Just before grabbing my things before heading out the door. I noticed my coat was still hanging in the closet dropping my purse back onto the kitchen table. Saying to myself 

‚ÄúMy head would still in the bed asleep it if we‚Äôre not attached to me‚Äù 

Doing a complete 180 making my way back into my room opening up my closet door reaching for it screaming 

‚ÄúOh my God! Now where in the hell is it!‚Äù

And that was when I noticed a box setting there in the corner out of curiosity I reached for grabbing it out of the closet thinking to myself what was in it. 

Walking back into the kitchen placing it down onto the kitchen table not knowing of what I would find in it. Setting down to open it up to find Memories! Memories that would bring me to rediscovering the past in my life. A past that would bring me to finding something that was missing from my life. 

 I just didn‚Äôt realize it at the moment! It was a scrap book along with photos and a letter, with one of the photos being of my mom setting there looking at the photo of my mom not always being very close to her it would still bring a tear.

But It didn‚Äôt seem make my day any better at the moment for today marks ten years since she had passed away. And with me going to visit her grave today it did not make it easier seeing this photo here picking up another photo the memories of yesterday hit me hard as I looked into the photo. Looking at a younger me a young Girl of about twelve years of age with my short brown hair standing there next to my mother.

 Who was next to identical to me and setting there beside me was my dog, a dog who I named Buddy. Thinking back I remembered the good times that I had with my dog buddy! But not all of it was good times! But for most teens you just don‚Äôt realize how much you would miss your parents till they are gone.

And that was when I found the letter, a letter that I have not seen before today thinking to myself that reading it that it would not make my day any easier. But read it I did, for the letter read as this, 

‚Äú. To my lovely Daughter Dakota‚Äô I am writing this letter to you! For when you get older you will realize the hard times and the good times that we had together.‚Äù

‚ÄúFor no matter what you will always be my beautiful little girl my little Dakota! knowing that the last few years that we had together was not the best for either of us. But I always had faith that you would someday see for yourself‚Äù

‚ÄúThat no matter what happens in this world that the ones that you love will someday leave you in this Life. 
Leaving you with their memories, so I want you to think back on the time that you ran away from home. Think back on what you found, think back back to what you have seemed to have lost along the way. For as you read this letter that I have written to you I want you to think back on the summer that you found, on what Life brought to you that summer just before your teenage Life was to begin. For then when you find it again you know that as your mother a place I have found a place that i hope you will find too. Knowing that the people you met along the way that summer for in your heart you will know. That there is a place in Heaven for us.‚Äù

Reading that sent my mind racing, racing back to that day thinking on everything that the day would bring back to me. But little did I know that the day would bring something! And in a way it that I would have never knew for someone it would bring me to that day.

Remembering back It was early that morning when I got up not wanting to get out bed just as my dog buddy would come running.  Jumping up onto my bed licking my face making himself known in his way telling me in his way. Only the way that my little buddy could do! Letting me know that another day was here another day
to go exploring. to find ourselves wondering out into a world of that only our imagination could.

Giving buddy a hug rubbing his fur as I got out of bed walking into the kitchen as my mom was making breakfast. Setting down at the table as she asked me what I wanted to eat looking at her saying 

‚Äú maybe later I‚Äôm not hungry right now‚Äù 

for I was still thinking about the argument that we had the night before. But before I could say anything my mom spoke to me saying 

‚ÄúHoney I know that you are getting older but I am still your mother! You may not want to hear that right now but I just want to be able to talk to you Dakota! and that one day you will appreciate the Life that I am trying to give you!‚Äù 

jumping up from my chair looking to my mom as I shouted to her saying 

‚Äú look mom not now I just want to just go! So look I will be back later‚Äù 

Making my way out the door as looking back at my mom saying 

‚Äú look I will be back later till then just chilling okay!‚Äù 

Walking out the door with buddy following me. Years later I would look back with regret on not giving more respect to my mother then.

 But now a journey awaited me a journey that would in time change my Life forever, forever in a way that I would soon find. Setting there on the back steps with buddy by my side looking out across our farm. I thought to myself

 ‚Äúwhat else is out there? What else was there for me in this life.‚Äù

 Looking down at buddy saying to him 

‚Äú let‚Äôs go find out for ourselves what else is out there for us! For it can not be any worse for us then it is here‚Äù 

With that I stood up saying to buddy

 ‚Äú let‚Äôs go! Let‚Äôs see for ourselves what else is out there‚Äù 

walking across the field of our farm making our way to the fence line. I thought to myself once I do this there is no turning back! There is only the road ahead of us! Jumping the fence me and buddy made our way to the road with my house now out of sight I knew now. That we was on our way and that we was also on our own! To where I did not know but we would find out when got there! 

As we walked down the dirt road a ways not meeting any cars till we came to the gas station at the end of the road. Seeing a red farm truck parked on the side of the gas station quickly grabbing buddy running up to the truck climbing onto the tailgate. 

 Laying down inside the back of the pickup me and buddy laid there in the back off the pickup truck noticing a blanket in the corner. Quickly grabbing it before anyone would come over covering myself and buddy up laying there it was not long till I heard the owner getting into the truck not noticing us. With him then Pulling out of the gas as I then looked to buddy saying

‚ÄúWoohoo we are on our way now!‚Äù

Feeling as the wind as it hit up against the blanket laying there as we made our way down the road. About fifteen minutes later uncovering ourselves setting up looking out into the empty fields as we  passed by them. Feeling the freedom of the wind making our way down the road. At the same time making sure that the driver didn‚Äôt see us.  Looking down at buddy I could see him looking up at me as if he was saying what are you doing. Saying with a smile saying to him 

‚Äú I know what you would say if you could talk but I know what I am doing ‚Äú 

looking back out into the opened fields as we continued to drive farther down the road. I thought to myself

‚Äúwhat was I going to do when I got there? Where was I going to go?‚Äù 

About thirty more minutes had passed by with the driver still not noticing us pulling into the parking lot of the grocery store. Quickly laying back down covering myself and buddy back up! Laying there waiting hearing the truck door open as a person then got out. Upon hearing the truck door shut waiting a couple of minutes to make sure that everything was clear. Looking all around before uncovering myself and buddy before making our way from the truck not looking back until we were far enough away. 

Looking out across the parking lot I recognized the grocery store that my mom would bring me when we went shopping.

 Walking from the parking lot myself and buddy found ourselves walking down the sidewalk as people would pass us by. Not paying any real attention to them we just kept walking keeping to ourselves until we then came across a gentleman. He was setting there on a bench in front of a the convenient store whittling away on a piece of wood. Just as he then Look up at me saying 

‚ÄúWell hello there! My that is pretty little dog that you have there with you‚Äù 

Saying back to him 

‚ÄúThank you! His name is buddy! my mom got me from the pound‚Äù 

Smiling back to me he then asked me saying 

‚ÄúSo where are you and buddy headed too on this fine day here if I may ask‚Äù

Replying back to him I said to him 

‚ÄúJust seeing what a girl and her dog could find on our way! On our adventure finding out what life has for us‚Äù

Looking suspiciously at me and buddy he then said to us 

‚Äú finding yourself on an adventure! Why aren‚Äôt you a little young to be out here looking to what Life has to offer you‚Äù? 

‚ÄúMaybe there is someone looking for you, maybe you should reconsider what it is that you are looking for and then when are old enough you then can‚Äù

‚ÄúThen maybe you can see what Life is about, but for now just wait here a moment I will be right back.‚Äù 

As he then walked into the convenient store a couple of minutes later coming back out carrying a drink and bag of chips along with a couple of dog treats. As he then handed them to me saying 

‚Äú Look I want you to promise me that you will go home now today! And think about your Life! And sleep on it and when you get up in the morning you just might know that the Life that you have right now. Is the best time, the best memories that you will know! For when you become an adult you may think that Life is grand and that you are on your way! ‚Äú

‚ÄúBut know this little one the memories that you make as a child are memories that keep you going when Life steps in letting you know that there is someone that still loves you in the memories that you keep.‚Äú 

thanking the kind gentleman as me and buddy then made our way down the street I didn‚Äôt know then what he said as I would later in my Life what he meant.

As the evening was about to set in as buddy and myself walked down the road making our way out of town out of sight. We came upon a field making our way across the field as the sun began to set on us we decided to make camp there for the night Just. Having no tent only the stars above us as our cover us as laying there under the stars with buddy curled up next to me. 

Thinking to myself about my mom was she missing me? What was she doing? As I laid there thinking to myself where was I going to go? What was I going to do when I got there? As laid there looking up into a Star lit sky thinking to myself what else was out there? What else did Life have to offer me. 

Soon finding myself falling to sleep asking myself certain things till I would fall to sleep for that night dreaming of myself and buddy being back at the farm. Dreaming of the man that we had met earlier that day as he was telling me in my Dream. 

‚Äú You may not know of your Life right now! But somewhere someone out there has a plan for you in Life‚Äù.

 ‚ÄúFor everyone that you meet in Life will forever stay with you whether it is in your Dreams or memories. You will know that there is a place for you in this Life‚Äù 

As I then Dreamed I then Dreamed of mom. In my dream she was crying, crying for me saying to me 

‚Äú please Dakota come home wherever you are please come back to me‚Äù 

Waking up the next morning with a tear in my eye I made a decision, a decision that would lead me to a place, a place that would change my Life forever.

With me and buddy making our way across the field thinking about the journey ahead the journey would take us to where we were going. Only problem was that we had no idea on where that was! We only knew that we were on our way!  Spending most of the day keeping  in the field Till we then came upon a truck parked on the side of the road looking around I could see a individual standing in a field across the road standing in another field. He was just standing there not really knowing on why he was just standing there at the moment.

Thinking to myself we could sneak another ride to somewhere as we did before, quickly running up too the truck climbing over the tailgate and laying down before the individual saw us. It wasn‚Äôt maybe about five minutes had passed before hearing the truck door open with someone getting in closing the door. Laying there as the truck started up thinking to myself that whoever it was did not see us as we then pulled onto the road making our way to wherever we was going. Laying there in the bed of the pickup with buddy to my side thinking to myself as laid there watching the clouds in sky pass by as we made our way down the road. 

I thought to myself what was I going to do when I got there? Would I ever see myself going back home again? But whatever would happen I knew that somewhere down the road I would find my place in Life. A place that I knew I belonged there but till then I laid there with buddy by my side looking up at the sky as it passed by I looked to buddy saying 

‚ÄúWe are on our way buddy you and I, for we will find our place in this Life you me and me together we will find our place in this Life.‚Äù

As the day went by further down the road finding ourselves laying in the bed of the pickup I could see the nights sky coming into view. Just as we made our way down the highway thirsty and hungry I felt lying there in the bed of pickup. For I did not know when or where we would end up at looking up at the stars as we passed by I found myself falling to sleep in the bed of the pickup as we made our way down the road.

 I found myself Dreaming yet again this time I was standing there looking out of a window looking into out into a world. A world that I was not for sure off a world that seemed distant to me a world that in time I would come to know. As I continued to look out the window I found myself looking at the tree outside of my window the leaves had all but fallen off on to the ground. A cold breeze would make its way through it branches making its way to me as I stood there looking at my mom waving to me from as she stood there looking at me. As she then turned and walked away as I screamed into glass of the window to my mom saying to her.

‚ÄúWait mom please come back please where are you going ‚Äú 

Turning back to me with a smile looking to me saying 

‚Äú I love you Dakota! I love you wherever your are‚Äù 

With that I suddenly thought to myself with tears in my eyes thinking to myself 

‚ÄúWhat have I done? What have I done to my mom?‚Äù

Just as I then suddenly woke up realizing that I was still in the bed in the back off the pickup feeling the truck pulling in somewhere before coming to a stop. Lying there hearing the truck door open up I laid there with buddy waiting for the right moment before getting up. 

But before I could say anything I suddenly heard a voice, a voice of needless to say a very surprised man saying to me 

‚ÄúWhat in Gods name! I can‚Äôt even believe to what I am seeing!‚Äù

Looking at me with a very stunned with a  surprised look on his face. But before I could even say anything he just looked at me saying

 ‚ÄúYou have got a lot of explaining to do but first come with me inside so I can find out where you came from and we can go from there‚Äù 

Climbing down from the bed of the pickup me and buddy made our way inside the mans house where he then proceeded to call the local authorities. Knowing that my and buddies journey had came to an end! Just as he ask me if I was hungry if wanted something to eat not turning down a good meal I immediately said to him

‚Äúyes very much so‚Äù

 After me and buddy ate I then explained to the man my story telling him everything before the local authorities would arrive. But then I heard a voice I heard a voice of what sounded to be a little boy in the next room calling out for his dad. As the man was standing there in his kitchen talking to what seemed to be his wife. Walking over to the room looking in as looked in I saw a boy about the same age as me lying there in bed looking at him  saying 

‚ÄúHello‚Äú

Looking to me with a surprise the boy then said to me 

‚ÄúWho are you‚Äù 

I replied to him saying 

‚Äú I am Dakota and what is your name‚Äù 

As he then spoke bake to me saying 

‚ÄúMy name is Billy‚Äù 

Walking closer o him I could see that he was sick he had a tube attached to his arm that was attached to a fluid bag next to him. Standing there next to him asking him if everything was all right he replied to me saying 

‚ÄúThe Doctors told my mom and dad that I had cancer and that it may take awhile for me to get better‚Äù 

Just as I was talking to him buddy then came running into the room jumping up onto the bed next to Billy. As I told buddy to get down billy then said with a smile 

‚Äú its okay I like dogs so his name is buddy?‚Äù 

Replying to him saying yes that his name was buddy and that we sort of found ourselves on a little journey. Looking at me with a smile as billy then said to me 

‚ÄúA journey! 

‚ÄúMan I would love to go on a journey someday a journey to where I could find myself somewhere other then here in this bed‚Äù 

Looking to Billy I said to him 

‚ÄúMaybe one day you will find yourself self on a journey, maybe you me and buddy could go on a journey together‚Äù

Smiling to me saying 

‚ÄúMan that would be great going on a journey‚Äù

‚ÄúI would love nothing but to find myself on an adventure one day!‚Äù

With Billy just looking at me as he then looked down at buddy petting him as he smiled. He then looked up to me from his bed saying to me 

‚Äú I want to so bad to find my place in this Life!  I want to just get up from here and go live my Life.‚Äù

‚ÄúBut hearing it in my mom and dad‚Äôs voice I can hear it that I may not get any better. And all I can do is think to myself maybe if not here in this Life then maybe in another Life I then can find my place in Life‚Äù

Just then as his dad would come into his room looking at me saying to me that it was time, time for me to head home. Looking back to Billy before I left saying to him 

‚Äú I hope that one day that you will get better and just maybe one day when you get to feeling better I will come visit you again and we can go on an adventure together‚Äù 

As Billy then gave buddy one last hug looking at him smiling petting him one last time before we made my our way to front door. To where the authorities were waiting there to take me and buddy back home.

 As we made our way back home from our little journey pulling into the drive way back at our farm I could see my mom come running out to me as I got out of the car. Grabbing me hugging me crying saying to me 

‚ÄúDon‚Äôt you ever leave me again Dakota! Don‚Äôt you ever leave like that again me again‚Äù 

hugging my mom saying to her

 ‚ÄúI promise mom I will never leave you again‚Äù 

For as the days went on I would set there thinking about billy and Journey that me and buddy went on that day. Thinking to myself settling there on the front porch with buddy setting there beside me. Looking out into the opened field in front of me Just as my mom would come out on the front porch setting down next me. As placed her arms around me with tears in her eyes 

 Telling me that the boy that I had met on my journey Billy! That Billy had passed away this morning! With tears in my eyes setting there leaning up against my mom not knowing of what to think. Saying to my mom

‚ÄúWhy! Billy‚Äô can‚Äôt die! He was going to get better so me him and buddy could go on a journey together‚Äù

Just knowing that setting there with my mom giving me a hug saying to me 

‚ÄúHoney I know that they are things in this Life that are hard to understand. And that as we go through Life we still find ourselves still asking ourselves that from Time to time.‚Äù 

For the rest of that evening me and my mom would set there on the front porch talking to one another about what life means for us as we grow up. With that being one of the few times that we did talk with one another, for it was not until I got older that then that I would realize on how much my mom meant to me.

Looking back now thinking to myself setting there in the kitchen holding my mom‚Äôs letter that she had written to me knowing now that it would be a letter for me to read later in my life A letter for me to look back upon.

 Thinking of the gentleman that I had met on my journey with buddy and that he was right when he told me that the memories that we make during our childhood Sometimes help us get through our Life as adults today. 

And on that day as I stood there at my mom‚Äôs grave I thought to myself thinking of my mom! Thinking about Billy‚Äô so many years ago what he said to me! For there was a place for him in this life and for the little time that he had in Life here, he indeed had a place, a place where he lived in his mom and dads memories and in their hearts. For the little time that I knew him I always thought of him in Life and in memories that he left behind for me.

The normal lifespan of a squirrel is just a few years but there are those who love them, feed them and watch them. Francis Brady was one such lover. Our town was pretty small, and the central parks and churchyard were full of trees even down by the railway bridge. Squirrels jumped through the trees and skitted round all day long in their effortless adventures.

¬†Frankie as we all called him moved here when he was in his early 30‚Äôs and there were not many that did not know him. He had moved around a few places before that trying to find the place to settle. ¬†A quiet gentle man he had always been attracted to the places that gave him peace. The local hill where he could sit and watch the seasons change and the parks where the squirrels chased each other and sat in the trees eating nuts. The day visitors marvelling at how Frankie had them eating from his hand and running over his lap. His soft Irish chuckle rising and falling as they entertained him. There were years of gaining their trust and no one else devoted the time to getting to know them. Frankie was also known to all the kids and his sharp memory remembered all of them. Somehow one man seemed to be the only one in this town that knew everyone and one of the few not born here.

On mornings the rain was soft and misty as the kids trailed through the town centre to school with their parents and on their own all looking smart and all of them had at some point been to parties where Frankie had been their entertainer. He would be sat watching saying hello just the same as clear bright or cold icy days. He also had a gift for making wood something special and his small house on the estate just a mile from the town centre had his workshop out the back. He had never learnt to drive so the garage was a useful storeroom. Frankie was the kindest person and would sit and advise people. Thought of as a lonely man he never said anything about that. His late 30‚Äôs he decided to pursue romance when he met from a nearby town, a lady, who he fell in love with. He was youthful and though he never seemed very manly, he never had 5 o‚Äôclock shadow they courted, and he happily eventually married Ellie. She lived with him in his small but lovely home, and they seemed very happy. Frankie still rose early and went to his benches and fed the birds and squirrels. He somewhere or other had found a place to get walnuts in their shells and hazel nuts and rare he was seen with peanuts but now and then it was all he had. He had a crow he had named Luke it took him a year of throwing Luke nuts and seeds to get him close enough to be able to start trying for Luke to take the food from his hand it took about another year for Luke to start being brave enough to get that close but the day he finally perched on the back of the bench and pecked the nut from his hand it was for Frankie as good as winning the lottery. Everyone at some point sat with Frankie and poured their heart out but that day Frankie went everywhere and told everyone. He was so proud that it took just over 2 years but finally he had made Luke his friend. 7 years later Frankie was inconsolable as Luke disappeared and Frankie had to accept the Luke had most likely died. I don‚Äôt think Frankie ever recovered that bit of his heart.

Frankie also always had a pocket full of dog treats. He knew all the regular dogs by name and had a bit of sausage for all of them. He never ever was too busy to stop and fuss them and in the most part everyone liked him. One or two as is always the case said there was something wrong with the little Irish guy‚Ä¶ too effeminate and too happy, too interested in kids and such like but there were a few of us myself included who knew him better than the rest. Ellie his wife best of all and she was my lover. I know you have got your mind churning now but there are things you don‚Äôt know yet. First off Frankie knew‚Ä¶ does that make it any better? Well Frankie could not love Ellie. Not physically. Hey ok lets go back here, then you will understand.

Back when Frankie was born in Ireland he had been one of a kind. He was raised a boy but at birth had been born sexless. A eunuch in a deeply religious country in a small town just on the outskirts of Belfast. News travelled in these small communities like wildfire through the Australian outback. His father hated him on sight for not being normal his mother loved her child but was ruled by his father. Frankie had no aggression and had no competitiveness or ‚Äúspunk‚Äù so to speak. The other boys kicked balls around Frankie wanted to lay in the long grass reading books and feed the animals and spend time with the girls dancing and picking flowers for his mum or doing gardening and housework. He developed an interest in simple magic tricks, and wood at a young age often designing and making his own small wooden boxes and contraptions. His father would belt his ass at every excuse possible his mother holding him in the early hours of the morning when he cried. Frankie knew better than to cry in front of his father. At school he had to be segregated at playtime as the real boys would hit him and he had to use the staff bathroom. Found in the kids one his pants would be pulled off and the small lads exposure humiliating enough was then exacerbated by acts of showing him their developing man parts even peeing on him and the taunts of freak and gay taunts. Frankie never understood the cruelty bestowed upon him and at 17 he left the family home. His mother gave him all her savings and sent him out into the world his father seeing him walk down the garden path for the last time with a smug look on his face. Two weeks previously his mother had walked in on her son pinned down and bloody from the belt almost passed out and still being thrashed by her husband. She screamed at her husband, and put Frankie to bed washing his welts and vowed that would be the last time his father would have the chance to do this. She didn‚Äôt have a lot but she gathered every last penny she had and he had a small pot of savings himself and she sent him on his way. Frankie stood at the end of the road he had grown up on and cried. The only time he went back was for his mum‚Äôs funeral. The middle of 5 kids his eldest sister who he was closest to always kept in touch and he would talk to his mum on the phone while his father was at work. They missed each other and Frankie never ever told his mum he was struggling or unhappy. When she grew ill, he had wanted to travel to see her but she asked him not to. His father‚Äôs hatred had it seemed only grew stronger for his defective son. In his case there was no fondness.¬† His father was deeply depressed at losing his wife and would not even look at Frankie during the whole ceremony. Frankie always said that his father just could not love him and that was ok. Many from the village came over and shook his hand and consoled them both that day. He sat on his mother‚Äôs relatives‚Äô side of the church not many had a love of his dad and to show this held their own wake. Frankie didn‚Äôt have the heart to spend time with any of them except his sister and so while he was in Ireland he saw her and her kids who loved his funny tricks and gentle nature. Frankie was a special man I will challenge anyone to prove me otherwise.

Ellie was a special woman. Yes, ok I loved her and I loved Frankie in his own ways too. I met Ellie at work. We both worked for a small office kept in above a caf√© in the main town centre. Ellie wasn‚Äôt one of those blonde bombshells she was a real woman. She had a face that lit up so pretty when she had an idea that it used to make me smile. It was like there was a tiny guy behind her face that lit a torch up that shone out of her eyes. She was kind and she was elegant. Not in an overt way but her poise and demeanour always seemed in check. She could eat a pack of crisps almost silently and a hard worker who was devoted to her husband. She always had time for people and was not an office gossip. Ellie and I got to know each other over several years and though I had been very attracted to her I had never acted upon it. She was married and I had been too. Then my divorce happened. My wife had met someone from her past and decided she wanted him more than me. 3 years later they fell apart but we managed to stay friendly having no children was a big bonus. Now and then the office would go out as they do to celebrate a new contract or some such deal that had finally gone ahead and Ellie knew I had been feeling sorry for myself and as we drank and chatted I stupidly confessed my feelings for her. For a while after she gave me a bit of¬† wide berth. Realising I had really put both feet in the mire I asked her to please have lunch with me and let me put it right. Ellie relented and we went to lunch. The local pub the plumbers as it was back then served us a healthy meal and we chatted at first like wooden puppets. We had relaxed after the initial apologies and Ellie had kept her composure until I spoke of messing with her marriage. Then she took to¬† a wistful look and a small composed smile perched on her lips. My marriage she simply said is a loving thing but it has never been physical. Ellie didn‚Äôt want to talk about it just then but over the next few months she slowly opened up trusting me more and more with the secrets they both held. Learning about Frankie was something that made me want to be a support to him and at first he was intimidated. He always was very shy of ‚Äúreal men‚Äù, he would however put on a brave face and do his best to get to know them. Not in big groups. Football days Frankie kept a low profile near the pubs etc. He was better one on one but he had lived here long enough now and people knew him as a good guy. There really was no one who had a bad thing to say about him. He had turned up here as a young man and worked with the local carpenter at the time. He had got himself lodgings with a lady over the back end of town and in her words was a model lodger. Clean tidy respectful and did help out in the garden and a few odd jobs. He paid his way and saved like crazy then somehow got his little house and I am pretty sure she cried the day he moved out. He‚Äôd always been quiet and private but his love of the wild life always got him talking to people. He was a gentle and caring soul and a few things happened around the town no one could explain and as I got to know Frankie more I am pretty sure he was responsible for them. Silly things to some people but to those affected they made all the difference. A little old lady lost her cat. They had been together for 11 years and pretty much the whole town knew she was heartbroken. Well we would see her out shopping and looking lost. Often times she would be in the pet shop wandering the treat aisle and talking with the owner about her missing lap warmer. Well she woke up one morning and there was a squealing and cat orientated mewing from outside and sat there was a cat basket with food and water and just about everything she could need for the little fluff ball inside. Maggie read the note with the cat asking her to give it a home as the original owner no longer could. Maggie and that cat within a few days had bonded, everyone thought it was a lovely thing to happen and Frankie was the type of guy to do something like that and not want any credit. Why do I think he did it? I am not 100% sure. He frequented the pet shop and he knew Maggie, but that wistful look of strange contentment would come over his face when people spoke about it. A funny almost secretive smile. One thing is for sure Frankie knew something.

So I know I‚Äôm avoiding the point you know Frankie‚Äôs secret well what about Ellies right‚Ä¶ I feel now she isn‚Äôt here any more I can tell her story. Ellie had been brought up by her French mother over here with her English dad. A happy child and friendly. A good community and at 15 her mother fell ill and her dad was working away too much to look after Ellie who was more than capable of doing everything. Her mum raised her to be reliant on herself and help with the chores so sent her to live with her mum‚Äôs sister. She was a drunk and would pass out around 7 pm after drinking all day. Her husband however decided Ellie was old enough to know the ways of men and women and took it upon himself to initiate her. Ellie was made to join him in bed each night and once he was done with her sent back to her room. It was her only experience of a man and Frankie the way he was, posed no threat to her. She told me how when she found out she was pregnant the uncle took her to a clinic and the abortion had been botched. She had been in pain for weeks and been told she would never be able to have children. She felt defeated as a woman 16 infertile and all of these things to deal with. When she had met Frankie he had seemed like the perfect answer. He had no need desire or want for sex or children. I know it took them about 8 months of dating before he told her his secret, and she said ‚Äúyeah I knew there was something about him!‚Äù Well after this their dating became more frequent and he finally asked her to marry him and to be fair she loved him the way he was. He had always given her respect and choice and she knew what she was letting herself in for. We talked more and one day I kissed her. I promise you it was the only thing we did without his knowledge. We stopped seeing each other and to make it easy on Ellie I moved jobs, I confess I had wanted to by this point anyway. We used to lunch on the quay sometimes now and then after the kiss we would visit it on our own. Id taken a driving job and sometimes I‚Äôd be in the area and go down. A couple of times I‚Äôd watch Ellie eating on her own and staring out at the water. Till the day she was crying. It had been a year or so since we had last spoken, and there she was sat alone on the bench her hair floating around her head and her shoulder‚Äôs hunched over sobbing hard into some ball of tissue. I went over and without saying anything held her. More than 10 minutes she cried and I let her and after this with little said I walked away. She called me 3 days later on Saturday morning. We had been friends we had each others number. Those days a landline was all we had. I answered and she thanked me and she told me she missed me. We talked and she asked to see me. We met on a bright spring Thursday afternoon and chatted over a fair few coffee cups. Ellie asked me what I felt and I could not lie I told her I was attracted to her. I told her I cared deeply and she confessed to feeling the same thing for me. We talked all about Frankie and she was really not happy about broaching the subject, but she wanted to have a physical adult relationship with someone. I told her I wanted more, and we both really felt the same regarding our kiss. There was a definite sense of guilt. 3 weeks later she called and asked me to come to their home. Frankie was in the bedroom, and he was upset. She sat me at the table in the conservatory and poured me coffee. Homemade cakes adorned the table and sandwiches. Frankie when he came out and sat down could barely look at me. Ellie started the talking. She told me she had talked with Frankie about her needs and curiosities. Frankie cried and tried not to show it. Ellie then proceeded to tell me how Frankie had held her and cried and asked her to never leave him as his wife and her voice breaking told me she never could. We as men finally were looking into each other‚Äôs eyes. None of the food got touched as we spoke. He assured me that he knew there was a possibility one day this would be a thing he would have to deal with. Me, well I did my best to put him at ease that I would never hurt Ellie and I would never ask her to leave him. Somehow Frankie and I navigated his most precious and vulnerable moments. We would never touch in front of him and we would never do anything in his home. We would be discrete no one except us 3 would ever know and until now I‚Äôve kept that promise. Ellie and I still took a few weeks to actually make it into bed. Ill be honest she was shy and nervous and though I had made promises to Frankie I was aware of both their feelings and so we took it one step at a time. He always knew when we met though he almost roasted himself in pain he would ask her questions after, and she would answer him. He admitted many times he did not have an understanding of it, as he had no drive, no sexual hormones and no experience bar the odd time he saw a couple getting a bit too friendly here and there. We always tried to be sensitive to his feelings and though at times all 3 of us struggled in one way or another we somehow remained friends. I even drove Frankie to the ferry to go to his mum‚Äôs funeral and picked him up. He went alone Ellie never having met any of his family was told he wanted to face his father and family on his own. His father had found out about their union and passed on a message through his sister about him being a freak and not deserving love. He would not put her somewhere she was vulnerable and in the same room as him. When his father died Frankie cried. A whole day off work and he barely spoke to Ellie. He never went to his dad‚Äôs funeral. He said to Ellie a few days later the man had only ever been resentful of him, and he was sorry he died but he didn‚Äôt want to hear the bullshit at his funeral.

¬†

¬†There were times when Frankie would ask us to stop and a few weeks later he would see how Ellie would be so wound up he would pull her to him and apologise for his lack of understanding and make her call me up and ask to see me. We both knew he would often sit in the chair while she was gone consoling himself with a small tot of whisky and often, he was in bed before she got back. She would slip into bed and hold him. They were deeply devoted, and I kept my growing love for the shy beautiful lady who would be the most passionate and needed woman in my life. 3 years after it started, I asked Ellie to give me some space and I tried dating a few other ladies. I can honestly say I never slept with one of them. All lovely in their own right, not one matched Ellie. I loved her curves, and I loved her soft featured face and, in some way, or another I loved her for the way she still loved Frankie. In 6 months, I was back with her and we stayed with our arrangement for many, many years. I loved her wholeheartedly and so did Frankie. He had periods of deep dismay he could not be her true husband but she made him feel like he was her world and in return I made her feel that when she was with me. I know she loved me too and it felt hard being torn in two but between us she never wanted for anything. Frankie was quirky and he was sensitive but between them they had one of the most stable relationships I ever saw. He never stopped working and he would be in the garden tending veg and out in the workshop making things and mending things. He would do parties and entertain the kids. Walk dogs and look after cats. Whatever he could to make sure she had all she needed, and her job was reasonably paid but he would refuse to let her pay the bills. Their home was simple but furnished well and had everything she needed. Her birthday he would always treat her like a princess cooking for her and taking her out. They had nights at the theatre, and they loved to dance. He always left her time to have with me. He even bought her underwear as long as he saw her in it and got to call her pretty and see her happy, he was as ok as he could be with me seeing it on her too. The times she was ill he never stopped me seeing her and the day she died we were both together, just as we were by her grave supporting each other. We both had our heart broken but that man was more man than anyone else I knew. That day he hugged me, he looked in my eyes and he knew I loved her, he knew she loved me as much as she loved him and he told me we will be ok. So many people said goodbye and so many of them had their reason to love Ellie. So many people at the funeral hugging Frankie. She was simply a kind generous and caring soul. Frankie retired after Ellie died and that was when the wood working became a hobby, and the garden was a pastime, and the squirrels became more his friends. Round by the churchyard he would sit on the bench and each morning to keep himself fit no matter the weather he would sit upon the hill and look out over the town. He loved this place and that was evident. Everyone knew where to find him and as the squirrels got used to his visits they would wait for him at the tree near the bench in the park. His bag would set down and his box would open, then the rub of nut shells grinding in his hand. He got to know them all and they got braver and braver with him. Teaching their young to feed from him too. His first year or so only one or two would take from his hand but soon enough the bench would often be populated by several squirrel‚Äôs at once. Dogs often scaring them off for a min or two as Frankie would make a fuss of them too. He liked to feed the birds and put out fat balls and seed for them to pick at and he‚Äôd even smile as the odd rat ran off with something. He loved all god‚Äôs creatures and had never so much a swapped a fly or hurt a spider. Frankie was known by the kids and adults alike. I used to go sometimes and sit with him and see him with his little crow buddy and for a while he had a pigeon and a blackbird that had taken a shine to him. The only thing Frankie kind of did not like was seagulls and living in a seaside place there were a few big rude ones that would scare away his usual companions. Frankie‚Äôs afternoon would consist of sitting in a caf√© having lunch and a wander out to the marshes or similar to keep fit. I reckon everyone in this town at some point sat on a bench with him and told him their woes. He would go home and clean and keep the garden tidy, and Sunday was his day with Ellie. He‚Äôd walk to the cemetery and sit by her grave and tell her about his week and evet the squirrels there would get up on the bench and take his nuts. He would get ill now and then and not be around for a few days, but Frankie was healthy and active and he bounced back ok. The strange, good deeds would happen around the town, and I suspected Frankie was the guy. We started going out to the pub now and then after Ellie died. Frankie would talk about her, and I loved keeping her alive in his memories. He spent hours talking about the way she would make him a dinner, and something would burn and she would be devastated but he would just tell her there was never an issue. He would the tell me things that had happened. How a family‚Äôs dog had needed an operation and they didn‚Äôt have the money and then the money would be dropped in their letter box or the vet would call up and say it was mysteriously donated and they were going ahead. One lady had had a bad car accident and needed some special walking aid and yup it had mysteriously happened. Frankie loved these stories and there was a kind of look that went across his face as if he were proud of himself somehow. I never once challenged him or asked him I just used to smile and say that I was pleased for them. He had his secrets I was ok with that. I went to see him a good 6 years after Ellie and said I had met someone and was dating. The lady in question made me happy but I guess Ellie haunted me and it never went far. He looked at me with tearful eyes and wished me well. We both agreed he would never meet another Ellie and he was ok with that. A few of the older ladies took a fancy to him but he was really too attached to Ellie to see their advances and too scared of letting his secret out. He remained single, and Sunday mornings graveside to the day he too passed on. It was a strange thing. It was usual for him to have a couple of squirrels visit the garden. He‚Äôd felt a bit under the weather but nothing too out of the ordinary. One morning he got up and filled the bird feeders and settled in his chair in the conservatory. A cup of tea in front of him. The neighbours a few hours later found a whole host of birds and squirrels in the garden squeaking and calling and cooing flapping around. When they went outside several were tapping on the windows as if trying to get to him and, when they rang the doorbell there was no answer. His friend Abi two doors down get her spare key and went in shouting for him. Found him sat up in the chair slumped to one side and unresponsive. All of the birds fell silent as did the squirrels. She burst into tears and took herself over to the phone and called for the emergency services. Frankie was at peace and all through the garden were nuts and offerings from the small friends he had such a special friendship with. I never really could bring myself to visit Ellies grave much I visited more when they were both back together. Frankie nearly always had a squirrel there. It always made me smile, and funny but those good deeds stopped for a while. Frankie had left me some things in his will. One was a book of people and stories of all the things that had happened to mysteriously benefit someone. I would read it and smile as sometimes it was something I remembered him telling me. There were a lot I didn‚Äôt know about. There was also a sum of money not a small sum but there was enough in his words to do a few good deeds and I guess it was about a year later I did my first anonymous deed. I told my mate up the pub a couple of weeks later and I had that strange feeling that I was smiling just like Frankie used to. I had no other choice but to continue to give Frankie a smile from below. He loved god and that was one person who undoubtedly went to heaven, that is if there is one.",4,1743108703.0,stories,1,1.0,False

For everyone who'll read this and share his opinion - THANK YOU. I'll also be very happy if there is someone who can relate to this!

I'm 23F. I'm sorry for possible linguistic errors, since English is not my native language. And I'm very sorry for this vast amount of text :')...

I've been through self-hatred out of feeling that everything's wrong with me (starting from 16yrs old), but at this point I just want to know myself better and find out the most suitable path for me to live a normal life... and finally grow up. What I'm doing right now is trying to disassemble and recollect myself in little pieces.

The thing I hated myself for the most is something I've not seen among the signs of autism - I never really wanted anything, like, 0 ambitions, just wasting time. I was a spoiled child, and this might be the reason for this. I was also terribly afraid of any new activities - just wanted to stay at home most of the time.

First of all, according to my parents, I didn't have any developmental delays. People keep telling me that I'm intelligent, and I tend to believe them, but I realise that I have gaps in knowledge in so many spheres that this makes my intelligence useless sometimes )). That's not surprising, since I was very rarely into learning something. I really loved reading various encyclopedias in early childhood, and that's all. Maybe the school took away my last desire to explore anything, I dunno.



*The story (*I separated it bc too long, so if you want to skip this, in a nutshell: the school felt like HELL to me):

I was relatively OK during pre-school and primary school (if exclude the fact that I was stuck inside my head almost all the time, and I remember many children didn't want to play with me in kindergarten already). I remember my primary school teacher told my parents that I had autism, but I was just behaving weird and playing weird games (I loved pretending to be a lion lol). At that time I felt okey though. But in secondary school I suddenly closed myself off. And that was the moment when school became a nightmare for me. No jokes, the events of 25% of my nightmares (and common dreams) still take place in school or other studying places somehow.

It's like all my troubles became obvious for me, or they just multiplied in size, I don't know. All following is still relevant today (except that it has become less tragic).

I felt like an alien. I didn't know how to speak, even how to move normally. No one liked me except my one best friend (most teachers, too). All I felt was constant stress, anxiety, self-doubt and compelled loneliness. I hated peers for being so weird and undescribable for me (and it was mutual). It was like I was a different biological species. I also used to be kinda agressive towards my parents for forcing me doing all the school stuff... (the 2nd reason for my self-hatred). At school I mostly hid in the toilets during breaks.

I've always felt awkward, + the fact that I'm VERY slim, I feel that literally my every pose and move are awkward. That's why I prefer baggy clothes - my moves and posture become less defined. I remember trying to develop a normal gait - first I tried feminine one, which looked WEIRD since I was a child, and than, clother to my teens, I thought that a manly gait is exactly what I needed... I was laughed at, since it looked exaggerated, but this habit of walking with long strides is still with me.

I remember copying my best friend's way of speech. She had a peculiar behavior, but since I gave up trying to look completely ""normal"", I was trying to develop my own peculiar behavior that I'm comfortable with, and which doesn't cause too much confusion among people (still developing tbh, just don't give a f that much of how others think about me right now).

I've always found it easier to get along with kids younger than me. I had fun playing active games where you need to pretend being animals, spies etc. I wouldn't refuse even now xD.

Very narrow range of interests. Just... drawing, and listenin' to music (spoiler: I'm an artist now, and my bf is a musician xD). I was never into fandoms etc. I didn't like any school subjects (especially physical education, and oh damn, how much I hate balls...), and dad was trying to get me into sports all the way (I've been going to martial arts classes for many years because I ""had"" to, nothing good came out of it).

Teenage years: I didn't know whether it's the world who's wrong or myself. I've never met anyone with problems like mine, so I started to blame myself.

I entered university at age 19. Felt like an alien again :). No one disliked me tho, and I even had friends. I finished it just to finish, with average grades (just like school).

¬†

It feels like... I was just forced to live and grow all the way, like a defective plant that doesn't really want to. It's like I am missing a large fundamental layer of *something* in my head from the very beginning, since birth. I always felt like *something* prevents me from living normally and feel OK. Due to uncertainty in own movements I can't even perform the simpliest action confidently when someone's watching. My whole life is a neverending frustration, and I'm tired of blaming myself for never wanting and doing anything.

It also feels like I'm a hell of a lucky person, since people just come in my life themselves right when I need them... Like, millions of ""normal"" people struggle to find love nowadays, and my bf just found me out of nowhere and didn't let me go (I was afraid of relationship like crazy, thinking that human relashionships are just not a thing for me and I'll ruin it somehow). Now he is the strongest source of motivation for me, and I'm very grateful to him. I remember feeling so uncomfortable being cuddled at first that my arms were all twisted like a praying mantis from tense. Bf saw this in the mirror and I got a nickname - ""mantis"" :). Now I'm rather way too intrusive and cuddling with my bf is one of my strongest needs.

I live with my family and bf now. Still in a comfy nest, yeah. Now that my bf's here it's even more comfy than anywhen else. But I understand that this can't go on any further, I NEED to change something, or everything, because I feel so dumb and childish, and I want to have children someday... But now I'm really just a goddamn overgrown child myself.

Right now I'm working on my portfolio to become digital artist (the ONLY way I see I can realize myself in the future). I really love drawing and I've noticed my skill grows very fast, but... Frustration :')). It's easier for me to sit still and watch my walls than doing something that I really *need to*, and what I *love* at the same time.

Is it just a stupid habit sprouted from spoiling, or executive disfunction in all its glory?

Here're another important things that can signify me being autistic:

1) Meltdown/shutdown. Finally, after discovering these 2 terms I knew what the fckng heck sometimes happens to me. I won't go in details since It would take so long.

2) I wonder if I have any sensory issues or not. I remember often feeling discomfort from clothes in school years (and labels were driving me crazy, but I thought it's a common thing). Now it's gone. I hate being in rooms with bright overhead lights on, it irritates me. I'm sensible to sudden noises but only when I feel really anxious and tense - then any sound can scare the shit out of me. Ah, and I love to smell things, especially my bf and my rats. I also might be slight hyposensitive in taste - I don't see much difference between under- and oversalted dish. I can easily forget to eat, but I freakin' love coffee.

3) I tend to dissociate myself in crowded places. I'll ommit many other obvious communication problems I have like problems with eye contact. And regarding my empathy... I really don't know whether it's good or bad. Bf often takes offense at my very offensive jokes that seem playful for me, and at my responses not always sound amatory or emotional. That's all I've noticed that's significant.

4) I think through all my lines in advance. Sometimes it gets to the point that I learn them by heart in my head and still can't bring myself to say it - this happens when I need to say something crucial for me.

5) I feel pathological love towards rats. I'm obsessed with them. When my rats die I feel so much pain but I can't stop getting more of them... I think I compensate for socialization problems with them.

6) Sometimes I can get very agressive if someone distracts me from doing something absorbedly.

7) I don't know if I can call these special interests... I'm very interested in dreams, astral stuff, the ""dark"" side of human mind, pathological anatomy... It's not that I want to research these themes all the time - this desire is very episodic. And maybe I should bring my love towards rats here xD.

8) I scored 133 in RAADS-R test. Why didn't i score so high on school tests...

9) I always pay attention to car numbers, never thought it could be an autistic feature lol. I also often tried to remember random car numbers in childhood xD.

10) Not sure if this can be connected with autism, but it usually takes so long for me to do anything, and I'm a bit of a perfectionist. It took me 2 days to finish writing this post!

I'm so nervous to post this and I so hope I won't have to delete this hehe...

11) I hate literally every social network and want to be no one and nowhere. My dream of life is to relocate in village.",2,1743108596.0,AutismTranslated,0,1.0,False

1: Of Course A Divorce
Christiana‚Äôs POV.
The door to the lawyer's office closed behind me with a soft click. I had barely taken a step inside when the man behind the desk looked up from his papers, his expression serious and firm.
""Mrs. Davis, please take a seat. Your husband will join us shortly, but there are matters we need to discuss first,"" he said, gesturing to a chair in front of his imposing mahogany desk.
Curiosity ate at me as I settled into the chair. What could possibly be so urgent that Alex had summoned me here, to a lawyer‚Äôs office of all places? I watched the lawyer intently, waiting for him to continue.
He adjusted his glasses and cleared his throat. ""Mrs. Davis, your husband, Alex, has proposed a divorce.""
My breath caught in my throat, and I stared at him, stunned. ""Good heavens, a divorce?"" I managed to say, my voice was shaky.
The lawyer nodded, his face was of professional detachment. ""I know this comes as a surprise to you, but that's what Alex wants.""
I could feel my heart pounding in my chest, each beat was of shock and disbelief that coursed through me. Divorce? Alex and I had our problems, sure, but I never imagined it would come to this.
The lawyer continued, detailing Alex's grievances like he was reading from a script. ""He has cited several reasons for this decision. Firstly, he feels there is a disconnection in your communication. He also mentioned disagreements on financial matters and the future direction of your lives together.""
My mind was racing, struggling to process his words. Alex and I had our spats, but were they really enough to end our marriage?
""And finally,"" the lawyer said, looking up to meet my eyes, ""he mentioned the issue of children. You have been unable to conceive after two years of marriage. Alex is a man of considerable wealth, a billionaire, and he desires heirs to continue his legacy.""
A sharp pain pierced my chest, and tears stung my eyes. The lawyer's words felt like daggers, each one driving deeper into my heart. That Alex could sit here and tell this man such intimate, painful details about our lives‚Ä¶ It was almost too much to bear.
My hands trembled as I clasped them in my lap. I felt utterly betrayed, hurt beyond measure. The man I loved, the man I thought I knew, had laid bare our most private struggles and used them as reasons to end our marriage.
The lawyer paused, allowing the weight of his words to sink in. I struggled to compose myself, to fight back the tears that threatened to spill over. I couldn't believe it had come to this‚Äîmy own husband, my Alex, seeking to end our life together because of something as tragic and uncontrollable as infertility.
I sat there, unable to speak, my mind racing with a thousand thoughts and emotions. The future I had envisioned, the love I thought was unbreakable, was crumbling before my eyes. How could he do this to me? To us?
The door to the lawyer's office opened with a quiet creak, and Alex stepped inside. My heart skipped a beat, and I rose from my chair, meeting his gaze with tear-filled eyes.
""A divorce,"" I said, my voice trembling. ""That's what you truly want?""
""Yes,"" Alex replied, his tone devoid of any remorse. He clenched and unclenched his jaw before continuing, ""I can't do it anymore. This whole marriage is suffocating.""
The words hit me like a sledgehammer, and I struggled to remain standing, my heart aching with a pain I had never known. ""There are rumors,"" I began, swallowing hard, ""that you're seeing Bianca Lewis, the celebrity, the fashion icon. Is that true?""
Alex didn't flinch. ""Yes. You and I drifted apart several months ago, although we did get intimate but I was never satisfied. So, I started seeing Bianca, and we've been together for six months. I must say she makes me feel whole.""
It was as if he had punched me in the face. The rumors I had dismissed as baseless were true. Alex had cheated on me. My chest felt like it was about to explode from the overwhelming agony. I had defended him, convinced he would never betray me, but now, hearing it from his own lips, I was shattered.
""How could you do this to me?"" I demanded, my voice breaking. ""I loved you, Alex. I sacrificed everything to be with you. And now you want to leave me?""
Alex's expression remained cold, almost indifferent. ""Don't even think about begging me because once a man has made up his mind, nothing else can change it.""
His words were like daggers, each one slicing deeper into my already wounded heart. The man I thought I knew, the man I had devoted my life to, stood before me as a stranger. The future I had dreamed of was slipping away, replaced by a painful reality I was unprepared to face.
I felt an overwhelming sense of loss and betrayal. This was not how it was supposed to be. The love that had once bound us now lay in ruins. Destroyed by his desire for a divorce to part ways with me.
The lawyer watched silently, his eyes flicking between us. I could feel the walls closing in, the air growing heavy with the finality of Alex's decision.
I wanted to scream, to lash out, to make him see the depth of the pain he was causing. But all I could do was stand there, my heart breaking into pieces.
I took several deep breaths, trying to steady my raging nerves. The air felt thick with tension, but I forced myself to remain calm. Meeting Alex's gaze with a newfound boldness, I said, ""You want a divorce? Fine. I'll give it to you.""
Turning to the lawyer, I held out my hand. ""Give me the documents.""
The lawyer hesitated for a moment, then handed over the papers. I could feel Alex's eyes on me as I signed each page with a steady hand, willing myself not to break down. I would not give him the satisfaction of seeing me cry.
With the final signature in place, I stood up and walked over to Alex, holding the signed documents out to him. ""I've given you what you want.""
Alex took the papers, his expression unreadable. ""You can have the mansion,"" he said after a moment. ""And Davis Enterprises, along with the estate in the Hamptons. Plus, $50 million as compensation for all your suffering throughout the years.""
The words hung in the air, a list of material possessions meant to ease the pain of a broken heart. But they meant nothing to me now.
""I don't want any of it,"" I said, my voice steady and clear. ""Keep your money, your properties, your company. They won't heal the hurt you've caused.""
2: Pain
As I approached our home, my heart sank at the sight of my belongings scattered outside. My clothes, shoes, and personal items were piled haphazardly on the lawn. My stomach churned as I saw Alex's mother, Margret , standing on the porch, ordering the maids and butlers to throw my things out.
Margret never liked me. She always found ways to belittle me and poison Alex against me. Seeing her now, orchestrating my public humiliation, was almost too much to bear.
""Why are you doing this?"" I demanded, stepping forward, my voice shaking with a mix of anger and despair.
Margret's eyes flashed with contempt. Before I could react, she slapped me hard across the cheek. The sting was sharp and immediate, but what hurt more was the malice in her eyes. ""You dare talk? After everything you've put my son through?""
I chuckled bitterly, even as tears filled my eyes. ""I stood by Alex. I defended him, supported him through everything. You know nothing about what we've been through.""
Margret sneered, her voice dripping with disdain. ""Take your things and get the hell out. Barren woman, who knows nothing other than squandering my son's money. Alex already divorced you and he's bringing in someone better.""
The words were like knives, each one cutting deeper than the last. But I forced myself to smile through the tears. ""It's what you've always wanted, isn't it?""
Margret 's face twisted with rage. ""You ungrateful little wretch. You were never good enough for my son. You're a failure as a wife, and you couldn't even give him a child. Now he's found someone worthy of him, someone who isn't a useless drain on his fortune.""
The maids and butlers watched in silence, their eyes filled with pity and discomfort. Margret continued to berate me, each insult cutting deeper than the last. ‚ÄúYou think you‚Äôre something special? You‚Äôre nothing! My son deserves someone who can give him a real family, not a useless woman like you.‚Äù
Her harsh words hit me ever harder, with the eyes of the servants on us, witnessing my humiliation. 
""You're a disgrace, Christiana. A parasite who latched onto my son's success. You have no place here. Get out and never come back.""
I stood there, absorbing every harsh word, every insult, but refusing to let her see me break. I knew this was her moment of triumph, the culmination of years of disdain and bitterness. And in that moment, I realized I had to walk away with my head held high, for myself and for the life growing inside me.
‚ÄúI‚Äôm leaving,‚Äù I said quietly, gathering what little dignity I had left. ‚ÄúBut know this, Margaret. I loved your son with all my heart, and I sacrificed everything for him. One day, he‚Äôll realize the mistake he made. And when that day comes, I hope you can live with yourself.‚Äù
With that, I turned and began collecting my things, tears streaming down my face but my mind was already made up. I would rebuild my life, far away from this toxic one.
Margaret's harsh words echoed in my mind, but I couldn't dwell on them. I needed to find a place for my things and figure out my next move. I pulled out my phone and began calling people I thought I could rely on.
""Hi, it's Christiana. I need a place to store some of my things temporarily. Could you help me out?"" I asked, my voice trembling slightly.
There was a pause on the other end before the voice responded, ""I'm really sorry, Christiana, but I can't help you right now. It's... it's complicated.""
My heart sank, but I tried to stay hopeful. I made another call. ""Hey, it's Christiana. I‚Äôm in a bit of a situation. Can I bring some of my stuff over?""
""Christiana, I heard about what happened. I don‚Äôt think it's a good idea. I‚Äôm sorry,"" the response came, tinged with discomfort.
Each call ended the same way, and the realization hit me hard: Alex had already been around, telling everyone his version of the story. In their eyes, I was the villain. No one wanted to help me. 
I tried to access my bank account, hoping to at least get a hotel room for the night. But when I swiped my card at an ATM, the screen flashed, ‚ÄúTransaction declined.‚Äù I tried again, and the same message appeared. Panic rising, I logged into my account on my phone, only to see a message: ‚ÄúAccount frozen.‚Äù
‚ÄúNo, no, no,‚Äù I whispered, my hands shaking. Alex had frozen my accounts. He had access to them and now, he had taken everything. I was in pain, with absolutely nothing left. My heart felt like it was being squeezed in a vice. I had no money, no home, and no one to turn to.
As night fell, I wandered aimlessly through the streets, clutching my bags and hoping to find somewhere safe. The city lights blurred through my tears, and the cold air bit at my skin. I felt utterly lost, each step heavier than the last.
Suddenly, I felt a rough hand grab my arm. ‚ÄúHey! What‚Äôs going on?‚Äù I cried out, but another hand yanked my bags away. Panic surged through me as I saw two men running off with everything I had left.
‚ÄúNo! Please, stop! Help!‚Äù I screamed, but my cries echoed unanswered through the empty streets. The men disappeared into the night, leaving me with nothing but my purse and phone.
I collapsed onto the pavement, sobbing uncontrollably. My entire world had crumbled, and I was left alone in the darkness. I felt utterly broken, my spirit crushed by the weight of my circumstances.
With trembling hands, I fumbled for my phone in my purse. It was the only lifeline I had left, the only connection to the world outside this nightmare. Through tear-blurred vision, I dialed a number, praying for someone, anyone, t
o answer and offer a tad of hope in this dark hour.
3: Pregnant? Incredulous!
Two weeks had passed since my world had crumbled to dust. My days were now spent scrubbing floors and sweeping at a dingy restaurant, the smell of grease and old food clinging to my clothes. 
My boss, a perpetually sour-faced woman named Karen, took every opportunity to remind me of my fall from grace. We were only two waiters and one was on leave.
""Christiana, get over here and clean this mess!"" Karen barked, pointing to a spill near the kitchen. ""And hurry up! Table three is waiting for their drinks!""
The restaurant was overwhelming, with rowdy customers demanding my attention. I rushed from table to table, my hands red and raw from constant cleaning, trying to keep up with the never-ending stream of orders and complaints.
""Miss! Where's my coffee?"" a gruff man called out, waving his hand impatiently. ""And bring some more napkins while you're at it!""
As I hurried to fulfill the customers' requests, the sound of the television caught my ear. The news anchor's voice cut through the chaos, and my heart sank as I recognized the topic of discussion.
""In today's celebrity news, billionaire Alex Davis has finalized his divorce from his wife Christiana Davis and is now officially with fashion icon Bianca.""
I froze, the tray in my hands trembling. On the screen, images and videos of Alex and Bianca flashed by, the two of them looking every bit the perfect couple. They smiled for the cameras, their hands entwined, their eyes filled with a happiness that felt like a knife twisting in my heart.
The customers around me began to chatter, their voices blending into a cacophony of judgment and gossip.
""Did you hear about Alex Davis? Finally got rid of that wife of his,"" one man said with a laugh. ""Can't blame him, though. She couldn't even give him a kid.""
""Yeah, I heard she was pretty useless,"" another woman chimed in. ""Bianca is a much better match for him. She's gorgeous and successful.""
My face burned with humiliation and pain as I listened to their cruel words. They didn't know they were talking about me, the woman who was serving them. Each comment was like a dagger, cutting deeper into my already shattered heart.
""I feel bad for that ex-wife of his,"" a lone voice spoke up. I turned to see a middle-aged woman shaking her head. ""Imagine how she must feel, seeing her husband move on so quickly. It‚Äôs just so sad.""
Karen's shrill voice snapped me back to reality. ""Christiana, stop dawdling and get back to work! Those tables won't serve themselves!""
I swallowed the lump in my throat and forced myself to keep moving. As I continued to serve the oblivious customers, their words echoed in my mind, each one a reminder of my perceived failures and the life I had lost.
The image of Alex and Bianca haunted me, their smiles mocking my misery. How had things gone so wrong? How could the man I had loved so deeply, sacrificed so much for, move on so easily? 
Oh, I almost forgot. She had always been there.
The pain was almost unbearable, but I held myself together, refusing to let them see me break. 
As the night wore on, the news segment continued, detailing the glamorous life Alex and Bianca were now living. I scrubbed the floors harder, trying to erase the hurt with every stroke of the brush. But no amount of scrubbing could cleanse the ache in my heart.
By the time my shift ended, I was exhausted, both physically and emotionally. I sank into a chair in the back of the restaurant, the weight of the day pressing down on me. Tears welled up in my eyes, but I blinked them back. I couldn't afford to cry. Not here, not now.
Instead, I took a deep breath and stared at my reflection in the dirty window. I was stronger than this.
No one had come to my aid when I needed it most. Friends turned their backs, and even those I thought I could rely on had chosen sides, believing the lies Alex spread about me. It was Karen, the hot-tempered owner of the small restaurant, who took pity on me. She offered me food and shelter in exchange for my work.
Scrubbing floors and serving unruly customers was a far cry from the life I had known. Each day was a struggle to hold onto my dignity while performing menial tasks, enduring Karen's never-ending criticism, and facing the pitying or judgmental glances of those who had heard the news when they by chance ran into me.
‚Ä¶
One afternoon, after enduring another grueling shift, I found myself staring into the bathroom mirror, my reflection a ghost of the woman I once was. 
My eyes, red and puffy from lack of sleep and constant tears, stared back at me. Suddenly, a wave of nausea hit me hard, and I barely made it to the toilet before retching violently. My body trembled, and I felt weak and lightheaded as I sat on the cold tile floor, trying to regain my composure.
Two hours later, I found myself in a sterile doctor's office, the harsh fluorescent lights making everything seem even more surreal. Dr. Patel, a kindly older man with a gentle demeanor, had just returned with the results of my blood test. 
""Ms. Christiana,"" he began, his voice calm but serious, ""you're pregnant.""
The words hung in the air, almost incomprehensible. ""Pregnant?"" I echoed, my voice barely more than a whisper. ""How... how can that be? I was told I couldn't have children.""
Dr. Patel gave me a sympathetic look. ""Sometimes, the body can surprise us. But I assure you, the test is accurate. You're approximately three weeks along.""
I shook my head, struggling to process the information. ""No, there must be some mistake. I was told I was barren. This can't be right."" My hands trembled as I clutched at the chair's armrests, trying to anchor myself in this revelation.
He handed me the test results, the undeniable proof staring up at me in black and white. I traced the words with my finger, still in shock. Pregnant. How could this be?
""You're sure?"" I asked again, my voice breaking. 
Dr. Patel nodded, his expression gentle but firm. ""I'm certain, Ms. Christiana. Congratulations.""
Congratulations? The word felt foreign, almost mocking. I was at a loss for words. Pregnant with Alex's child. The last time we had been intimate was ten days before the divorce. It hadn't been an act of passion or love; it had felt more like a duty to him. He didn't hold me lovingly, didn't kiss me. His mind had clearly been elsewhere. And now, despite everything, I was pregnant?
I left the doctor's office in a daze, the world around me feeling distant and unreal. The irony of the situation was overwhelming. 
Alex had divorced me because I couldn't give him children, and now, he
re I was, carrying his child. The universe had a cruel sense of humor.
4: Meeting Again
The plane's engines hummed softly as I settled into my first-class seat, looking out the window at the clouds. 
Five years had passed since I left this city, heartbroken and destitute. Now, I was returning as a successful businesswoman, the CEO of a thriving empire known nationwide. My brands, ranging from high-end fashion to eco-friendly cosmetics, were household names. The transformation felt surreal.
My personal assistant, Grace, was busy typing away on her laptop a few seats down. Beside her, my security team ensured that everything was in order. They were all part of the group that had become essential in my new life. My success had brought wealth, influence, and an entirely new set of responsibilities.
Among my group, however, the most important were my children. Ethan and Emma, my five-year-old twins, were currently engaged in a heated debate, their voices carrying through the luxurious cabin. They approached me, their faces filled with the intensity of their argument.
""Mom, tell Emma she's wrong!"" Ethan demanded, his blue eyes sparkling with frustration and excitement.
""No, Mom, Ethan is wrong!"" Emma retorted, her hands on her hips and a stubborn pout on her lips.
I couldn't help but smile at their antics. They were both so smart and full of life, each with their own unique personality. Ethan was logical and methodical, while Emma was creative and fiercely independent.
""Okay, okay, calm down,"" I said, holding up my hands. ""What's the argument about this time?""
""Ethan says that the capital of Australia is Canberra, but I said it's Sydney,"" Emma explained, her eyes wide with determination.
I chuckled softly. ""Ethan is right, sweetheart. The capital of Australia is Canberra, not Sydney.""
Emma's face fell, her pout deepening. ""But Sydney is the biggest city. It should be the capital.""
I pulled her close, kissing the top of her head. ""Sometimes the biggest city isn't the capital. It's a bit confusing, but it's a good thing to learn.""
Ethan beamed with pride, while Emma sulked for a moment before finally giving in with a sigh. ""Okay, Ethan, you win.""
""Thanks, Mom,"" Ethan said, giving me a quick hug before running back to his seat, victorious.
Emma lingered, her disappointment still evident. I cupped her cheek, looking into her eyes. ""You know, you were right about Sydney being the biggest city. That's something special too.""
She smiled up at me, her earlier defeat forgotten. ""Thanks, Mom.""
As she scampered back to her seat, I leaned back and took a deep breath. Moments like these reminded me of how far we had come. From the depths of despair to the heights of success, my children were my greatest achievement and my most precious treasure.
Returning to the city I had left behind felt like closing a chapter and beginning a new one. My heart swelled with pride and anticipation. This time, I was not the broken woman who had walked away with nothing. I had everything which made my life whole.
Five years ago, my world had turned upside down. Discovering I was pregnant after Alex left me was both a blessing and a challenge. With no family to turn to‚Äîbeing an orphan meant I was truly alone‚ÄîI had to muster every ounce of strength I had left.
I saved up what little money I earned from scrubbing floors and sweeping at Karen's restaurant. It was tough work, but Karen's kindness and the roof over my head kept me going. Every night, I counted my savings, dreaming of a better life for my unborn children. I knew staying there was not an option; I needed a fresh start, away from the pain and humiliation of the past.
With enough money saved, I left Karen‚Äôs place and moved to a new city, far from the memories that haunted me. I found a small, rundown apartment and started from scratch. My first venture was a tiny boutique‚Äîbarely more than a closet‚Äîwhere I sold handmade dresses and accessories. The work was grueling, and the profits were meager, but I poured my heart into it.
Pregnancy was no walk in the park, especially without anyone to lean on. I faced the morning sickness, the doctor visits, and the overwhelming fear of the unknown alone. But every kick, every flutter from my babies gave me the strength to keep going. When the time came, I gave birth to Ethan and Emma. They were my miracles, my reason for fighting harder than ever before.
Raising twins on my own was a monumental task. Sleepless nights, endless feedings, and the constant juggle between motherhood and building a business tested me in ways I never imagined. But giving up was never an option. I wanted to prove to myself and to the world that I could rise above the challenges.
The boutique grew slowly but steadily. Word of mouth spread, and soon, my unique designs caught the eye of a few influential people. Orders started pouring in, and I reinvested every penny into expanding my business. I moved into a bigger space, hired staff, and launched my brand nationwide. The trials were many, but so were the triumphs.
Ethan and Emma grew up in the midst of it all, always understanding that their mother was working to create a better life for them. They were my greatest cheerleaders, their laughter and love my daily inspiration.
Now, as I sat on that flight back to the city I had left in shambles, I couldn‚Äôt help but feel a deep sense of pride. I had built an empire from nothing. My brands were synonymous with elegance and innovation, and I had secured a future for my children that I had once only dreamed of.
‚Ä¶
The flight finally landed, and the hum of activity around us grew louder as we prepared to disembark. I straightened my jacket and turned to my team, giving them last-minute instructions.
""Grace, make sure the car service knows we‚Äôre on our way. Sam, coordinate with the hotel about our late check-in. Lisa, double-check the kids' bags,"" I said, my voice clear and authoritative.
My personal maid, Lisa, nodded and moved to check Ethan and Emma's bags. The children, bubbling with excitement, were being particularly giggly and playful. Ethan kept trying to tickle Emma, who squealed in delight, her laughter ringing through the cabin.
As we moved through the airport, I kept an eye on them, smiling at their antics. They were truly the light of my life, their joy infectious even in the midst of a hectic schedule. We made our way to the waiting area where our cars were supposed to be, my team forming a protective circle around us.
""Mommy, look! I'm a superhero!"" Ethan shouted, darting ahead with his arms outstretched like an airplane. Emma, not to be outdone, tried to catch up, her little legs pumping furiously.
""Ethan, slow down!"" I called out, but it was too late. In his enthusiasm, Ethan collided with a man surrounded by his own group of P.A.s and bodyguards.
The man looked down at Ethan, who stared up at him with wide eyes, momentarily speechless. I hurried over, my heart racing.
""I'm so sorry,"" I began, but my words trailed off as the man removed his sunglasses and called my name.
""Christiana?""
I froze, my breath catching in my throat. 
There, standing in front of me, was Alexander Davis. My ex-hu
sband. The man who had shattered my heart and left me to fend for myself. [Read more](https://novels-for-all.com/best-novel-platforms)",1,1743108559.0,Novelideas,0,1.0,False

1jld9b2,https://www.reddit.com/r/GorillaMind/comments/1jld9b2/daily_caffeine_intake_gorilla_mode_formula_safe/,Daily Caffeine Intake & Gorilla Mode Formula - Safe?,"Hi GorillaMind community, a bit of a strange set of questions that probably have a simply explained set of answers.

Around two years ago, I had stopped drinking coffee and energy drinks (Monster, Red Bull) and was using basically stim-free formulas for various reasons. The exception was Gorilla Mode preworkout, and at the time, I was using the old formula. I had stopped going to the gym around a year ago at this point, my old formula tub went bad, and I started drinking daily caffeine again with coffee (espresso, pour over, immersion) and energy drinks, mostly since I started furthering my education and needed more ""awake and focus"" time. 

Now, I want to get back on a consistent gym cycle again. Initially I chose Gorilla Mind because it had the daily creatine value covered, a very simple reasoning. I know that the new formula still has the 5mg a day for the double scoop, and I'm sure I can handle the extra 50mg from the double scoop (will work up slowly again anyways), but now I have a new set of concerns. 

Considering my daily caffeine intake during the day can be around 80-120mg with a simple coffee or energy drink around 2pm (if necessary, fluctuating), would it be unsafe to also have the 400mg double scoop of Gorilla Mode around 9PM for the gym? I also have heard that I should take a break week with Nitric every month or so, to avoid tolerance build up to the supplements in the base formula. Is this a good practice? 

I am aware of Nitric also having no caffeine, would it be a good idea to use Nitric on a ""rest"" week (the lighter week after the hardest peak of a mesocycle \[if I have that correct\[) as well? I would avoid taking caffeine at the gym while on Nitric for the week as well.",0,1743108489.0,GorillaMind,2,0.5,False

I started using faceapp and added that jawline and cheekbone and suddenly I started matching hundreds of women. I guess there was a change in my personality that they noticed. Thanks to catfishing I went to over hundred date with 50+ women in 6 months my schedule was so packed with dates I was forgetting some of them or just had to schedule coffee dates in the morning, lunch dates afternoon and dinner/drink dates evening. Most of the time my touches are slightly subtle meaning I don't put a whole different face but of course it is different and some women get dissapointed so about %60 of time no second dates because there was no ""spark"" lol. But sometimes I try to impress them with personality and my kind manners. There have been many instances where I got second or third dates. To say about %30 of cases end up kiss/make out and only %5 end up with sex. 

  
I must say most women lie to man about personality etc. because average women finds only a very small percentage of man physically attractive. They go crazy around attractive men it is like a switch turns on makes them instantly horny. I also opened a women catfishing account and first 20-30 profiles were attractive top men and my research on instagram when I found name of these man showed that these attractive man share and rotate the same women as these women and man have been following each other on insta. 

  
Anyway wish me luck because I have a date today, tomorrow and weekend is full of dates! Since sunday I have been to 4 dates and they all didn't feel ""connection"" and ended the date in an hour but maybe one of them will give this ugly face a chance! ",0,1743108477.0,AskMenAdvice,5,0.4,False

1jld5k3,https://www.reddit.com/r/recruitinghell/comments/1jld5k3/it_recruiting_agencies_why_so_out_of_touch/,"IT recruiting agencies, why so out of touch?","I'm a senior full-stack web developer with almost 15 years of experience. Every year I do a few interviews with a couple of companies from different parts of the world to see what the current trends are related to technologies, the latest requirements for developers, and to keep my interview and soft skills sharp. I always make sure that these companies know that I'm not actively looking for a job, I'm just casually browsing and who knows, if a good offer for the right project, from the right company, for the right amount of salary comes along I might even make the switch.

So, not long ago I visited my LinkedIn profile and saw that I had a few messages from companies and recruiters. I opened the first one and it was a recruiting agency that wants me to join their network and they sent a link to do so. I opened the link, let them grab some info from my LinkedIn profile, uploaded my CV, let them know which stack I'm interested working with and my salary expectations.

Then there was a quiz asking 10 useless syntax based questions, such as which one of these 3 similar looking method names can do X in Y library. The worst kind of things to ask from a senior dev, as I'm not gonna memorize something that I can look up in 10 seconds. This was the first red flag.

The second red flag came when the site gave me a little slider saying that my salary requirement is too big and I should modify it. The right amount, according to them, was around 4k USD maximum. I currently live in LATAM by the way. I set the slider on a bigger amount, as it wouldn't make sense to interview for less than my current salary. I submitted my application and the system said that they are going to reach out to me.

The next day I received an automatic email from them saying that they liked my application and they would like to continue. And that's when the biggest red flag appeared; as I continued reading the email it stated that there's going to be 4 more interview steps: 1. Technical test, 2. Intro interview, 3. Technical interview, 4. Join network.

The only problem was that step number 1, the technical test, was going to take 3 (THREE) hours. Like, are you guys crazy? 3 hours is about half of a workday. If you exclude lunch, coffee, and toilet breaks, wasted time on, and between meetings that should have been an email, it is a half workday.

I'm not going to waste 3 hours after work for this, despite the fact that I have it relatively easy as I don't have children, but imagine you have kids. After work you have to take them home from kindergarten and school, feed them, play with them, go to the bank to talk about your mortgage, take your mom to the doctor, do the dishes and so on and so forth million things to do. Are we supposed to say to our spouses ""sorry darling, today you need to do everything on your own, because after work I basically have to work for free for some recruiting company""?

I understand that there are many fake applicants and bad professionals nowadays that have to be dealt with, but this is just madness. I myself interviewed people and I know for sure that during a 30 minute interview, consisting of a 20 minute chat and a 10 minute live coding, you can tell if a developer is good or not. No need to test them for hours multiple times.

I have been through a bunch of stuff the last few years. And my childhood was not easy. I grew up with an alcoholic father, who was both physically and verbally abusive to me and my mother. After getting a restraining order and finally escaping our home with him, I got into a relationship less than a year later. I have always been a pretty insecure person, and I was just happy to finally feel desirable. Long story short, he turned out to be physically violent towards me as well. He also cheated about six months in, but I was so insecure I was afraid to leave and have nobody. I stayed with this guy for years and years until he finally cheated and left me for someone he knew for a few days. 

I lost a lot of friends throughout this relationship because of my partners attitude towards them. He was very isolating and just unlikable/rude and many left because he was always around. I had one friend who had previously been through a similar relationship, and he was the only person I told about the abuse. He always listened and never judged me, but frequently reminded me how wrong it was. He even made a few comments to my ex about how he was a pos for treating me that way. I have had a thing for him since we met. He's a cool guy who respects women and has many platonic female friends. I've considered him my best friend for a long time. Both of us were in relationships for the first 3+ years of our friendship. 

After my ex left, his ex broke up with him a few months later. We live a few hours apart, and the first time we saw each other while both single, I jokingly suggested a date. We had coffee and ran errands and I asked to kiss him. He said he ""doesn't kiss on the first date"" lol so I left. But told him I was planning to kiss him the next day, since we had planned to go drinking with some more friends. The next night was seriously like something out of a movie. We went to a club, and while dancing I started holding his hand. We eventually kissed, and I cannot even explain how magical it felt for me. I felt so excited yet so safe and calm with him. We kept drinking and one thing led to another if you know what I mean lol. 

Flash forward to now and it has been almost 7 months. We went on a spontaneous vacation, so many concerts, and multiple small weekend trips. I met his family, and he met mine. He told me he loves me at the start of this year. I have genuinely never been so happy in my entire life. I fell in love with him so quickly and it gets stronger every day. I finally am growing confidence in myself, and he encourages me to push myself to grow in ways that feel scary sometimes. We spend as much time together as possible. I feel like I have the opportunity to have a family and give my kids the loving home I never got to have. I cant even tell you how perfectly imperfect this man is. He's goofy, an asshole in a lighthearted funny way lol, he cooks for me and takes me out and listens to my feelings. He often shows his love in a way that's unspoken yet undeniable. Even though he still tells me every so often:) 

I never thought this was possible. I faced so much hurt and disappointment that I expected my life would only continue to be this way. Now, I'm working on myself and my career as we talk about getting a house together. We share our favorite hobbies and music and every day with him is like hanging out with my best friend. I could not be more grateful. I hope everyone finds a love like this. And I promise it is truly possible<3

Its interesting because her recent advice session on her podcast, someone asked about how to deal with working at a job that does not align with your beliefs. Her answer to this honestly shocked me, she basically said that it doesn't matter if your job doesn't align with your beliefs because sometimes you have to do what you have to do, and that you as an employee are personally not contributing to the mission of the job. This is just incredibly wrong in my opinion, if you work at a job where your morals do not align with the job you are creating cognitive dissonance when you try to come up with justifications as to why you are working there.

Then that had me thinking, I think Emma is trying to justify turning chamerlain coffee into a profit driven business. In her eyes, this is just something she has to do to keep growing her wealth, even though she might not align with it morally. But at the end of the day she's still contributing to the capitalistic profit driven mindset. 

I hope this makes sense I'm kind of rambling but it is just upsetting what Emma is doing with chamberlain coffee, and its pretty obvious that her recent comeback to social media is to keep promoting it and make even more money. ",15,1743108109.0,emmachamberlain,9,0.94,False

1jld2q1,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskDocs/comments/1jld2q1/ive_been_continuously_tired_since_i_was_aroung/,I've been continuously tired since I was aroung 10yr old. It's only getting worse and I fear my doctor aren't taking it seriously.,"I'm currently 18 years old and Female (AFAB) around 5'4"" to 5'6"" and  weighted in at 78kg (this was conducted in February) and I'm very very tired. Physically absolutely drained, it's the kind of tired inwhich you know you have to stay awake for something but sleep is always calling you, but you can't sleep. Now imagine that ""something"" you need to stay awake for is just living your life. 

Since 10 years old I always was ""sleepy"", and by the time I got to 13 years old I was sleeping 12 hours per day. And now I'm 18 years old hopefully going to university in a couple months and I can't stay awake enough to actually finish exams, I drift off then snap myself back. 

At first I was recommended iron deficiency tablets (along time ago so I dint remember the name), it didn't work. They recommended I change my diet. I ate health I bikes and walked almost everywhere, and still was tired. Then I tried caffeine, coffee, monster, redbull, lucozade, you name it I have drank it. Nothing. 

It got to the point where I thought caffeine, and the ""staying awake"" and ""jittering"" things were just movie stuff and not real. 

And in recent times I've went back to the doctors, got a new one, they did 6 blood test and found something but unrelated to my tiredness.

And since December I've been getting more test and more appointments and more adjustment. And now they want to step back to the iron deficiency treatment, to which they said themselves didn't work before. 

I feel like I'm losing my mind. Going up stairs makes me tired. Sitting up makes me tired. I get tired of sleeping. I get so out of breath going up the stairs it takes me 5 minutes to recover. I feel like I'm being held together by rusty nails and everyone else has perfectly polished bolts made of diamonds. 

They implied I'm over-exaggerating because I'm autistic. It's ""over-simulations"", it's because of academic stress, because of social stress and anxiety, because of mental health issue. They even asked me about my periods and how it may effect my moods and tiredness, but I'm pretty sure I'm not on 24/7

I fear that my tiredness is genuinely holding me back, and it's approaching the boards of delusion. It's like I sleep and wake up but I never slept in the first place. 

And I don't think my doctors are taking it seriously, because they keep going in circles and back tracking anytime I call for updates or have to book new appointment. 
I've had a nurse genuinely tell me she doesn't really now what's going on and it's odd. 

They said they want to sent a sample of blood to a very important/good hospital to their lead Hematologists. The hospital is one of my countries best, but they want me to 'hold off before making any radical decisions'

I feel like my going in circles. And unless these doctors are vampires, I don't think they should be doing that many blood tests.

I am just lost and I fear they're not taking it seriously. Are there any there suggestions as to why I feel so tired all the time",2,1743108049.0,AskDocs,1,1.0,False

Hi! I‚Äôm Stephanie. I‚Äôm 34, and live in Western Canada. I am looking for an online connection. I‚Äôd like to find someone I can confide in, get to know on a personal level, and enjoy spending time talking to, and vice versa. 

I am interested in talking to someone similar in age to me or older(28+). Similar time zone would also be preferred, but not a dealbreaker. I am looking for someone that is able to maintain conversation and put in effort(I will do the same!). Other than that, I don‚Äôt have any specific personality/physical traits that are mandatory. I am looking preferably for something longer term/ongoing, but that obviously depends on how well we click, but would prefer to only receive messages from people interested in the same. I‚Äôd be okay with it if there was some flirting involved, but I‚Äôm not looking for anything very sexual. If your post history is mostly or completely nsfw, we likely won‚Äôt jive. 

Here are some things I enjoy/a bit about me:
* big fan of tv shows/movies. I love horror the best, but not exclusively! 
* Music! My favorite band since is Blink 182, has been since I was 15. 
* I love to shop, and get my nails done
* Big fan of coffee(but not a snob about it)
* I have a dog that I love very much 
* I enjoy getting some exercise every day, developing a love for walking has done wonders for my mental health
*[This is what I look like](https://imgur.com/a/OxamSqG)

That‚Äôs just a small look into who I am, but definitely looking forward to getting to know someone on a much deeper level. Please be willing to share photos of yourself, and I will obviously do the same. If my post interests you, please reply with your name, age, where you are located(does not have to be exact location!) and a bit about yourself so we can get a conversation started! Chats preferred over messages.

1jlcx2w,https://www.reddit.com/r/DarkTales/comments/1jlcx2w/sounds/,Sounds,"He came home from work. He felt more exhausted than he had ever been in his life. He was just as tired every day. Quickly, he got ready for bed. He closed his eyes. He loved sleep. It was his favorite part of the day. It didn't necessarily bring him happiness, but at least it provided a break from existence.

Sounds. He heard loud sounds of arguing. It was coming from one of the surrounding apartments. He waited a long time for it to quiet down. It didn‚Äôt. He tried moving to another room. The sounds were just as loud. Even earplugs didn‚Äôt help.

He decided to go outside for a smoke. His building had an external corridor that connected the apartment entrances‚Äîone on each side. In the middle, stairs and an elevator, which rarely worked. He didn‚Äôt really know his neighbors. He barely knew of anyone in the building.

He lit his first cigarette. He rarely smoked, but he liked strong cigarettes. He didn‚Äôt consider himself addicted. He believed he could quit whenever he wanted. A light breeze blew. The scent of smoke spread through the corridor. That smell was so familiar and dear to him. It followed him wherever he went, in his hair and on his fingers. His companion. He loved that bitter taste in his mouth. It numbed his palate. The warmth on his fingers was comforting. Maybe he didn‚Äôt smoke as rarely as he thought.

He lit a second cigarette. The wind was abruptly cooling his hands. He put one hand in his pocket while the other held the cigarette. He was grateful for its warmth. He didn‚Äôt realize that without the cigarette, both his hands could be in his pockets.

He noticed a young woman standing in the external corridor. Leaning on the railing, she was looking down. Though there was nothing to see. Just buildings and roads.

He lit a third cigarette. He wondered why she was there. Could it be that she heard the sounds too? Unlikely‚Äîit sounded like it was coming from an apartment with which he shared a wall. Strangely, the arguing wasn‚Äôt audible from outside. Everything had stopped, went silent.

He went back inside, welcomed by silence. Blessed silence.

¬†

Sounds. Music. Loud music. A feeling of helplessness gnawed at him. There had to be something he could do. First, he needed to figure out where the sound was coming from. It seemed like it was coming from the apartment directly above his. But when he entered the living room, it sounded like it was coming from the apartment below. He stepped outside.

He lit his first cigarette. He nervously played with it. That same woman stood there, leaning on the railing just as before. She was looking at the sky. There was nothing to see. Just clouds.

He lit a second cigarette.

‚ÄúNot giving you a break either?‚Äù

All he got in response was an empty stare. He took out his pack of cigarettes and silently offered her one. She accepted. He lit it for her while she held it in her mouth, shielding the flame from the wind with his hands. His hands were already starting to freeze.

‚ÄúI‚Äôm sure it‚Äôs the apartment to the right of mine; it‚Äôs so loud!‚Äù

He put out his cigarette and went to check the accused apartment‚Äôs door for any sounds. Nothing.

‚ÄúAre you sure? I don‚Äôt hear anything.‚Äù

Then he realized that he hadn‚Äôt heard anything since stepping outside into the corridor. Had the music stopped?

‚ÄúOf course you don‚Äôt hear anything out here ‚Äî you have to go inside!‚Äù

She went into her apartment and left the door open. Without thinking, he followed her inside. Only then did he realize he hadn‚Äôt actually wanted to. He felt as though it was too late to turn back.

The music hadn‚Äôt stopped. It was the same music he had heard from his own apartment. He was convinced it was coming from the left.

‚ÄúSee? Just as I said‚Äîit‚Äôs obviously coming from the right!‚Äù

‚ÄúAre you sure? It sounds to me like it‚Äôs coming from the left.‚Äù

‚ÄúDon‚Äôt make me sound crazy!‚Äù

He decided the smartest thing to do was knock on both doors. If they were sleeping, it wouldn‚Äôt be loud enough to wake them. Of course, he would check the left door first.

‚ÄúI‚Äôll check both apartments. I‚Äôll be right back.‚Äù

He left and shut the door behind him, with no intention of ever returning.

An old lady opened the left door. He felt terribly sorry for disturbing her. He shouldn‚Äôt have ‚Äî he hadn‚Äôt woken her. She suffered from insomnia.

A young man opened the right door. He asked him if he, too, could hear the loud music.

‚ÄúSorry, but I don‚Äôt know what you‚Äôre talking about.‚Äù

It was clear that no sounds were coming from that apartment.

‚ÄúMy apologies. Good night.‚Äù

He lit a third cigarette. He looked down, then up at the sky. He wondered what that woman could have been staring at so intently.

He went back inside. He didn‚Äôt hear any sounds anymore. He lay down and closed his eyes. Sleep wasn‚Äôt coming so easily. This had all caused him too much stress.

¬†

Sounds. Music. Again. He ran out of the apartment. When he reached the stairs, he was convinced the sound was coming from above. He climbed quickly, listening carefully. He was determined to find the source. The source of what, exactly? Because it was more than just the source of the music.

He climbed several floors before realizing the sound had faded significantly. Had he missed the right floor? He started descending slowly.

Everything fell silent. The wind stopped. He couldn‚Äôt even hear his own footsteps. He smelled a strong scent of smoke. A man was leaning on the railing, smoking. He hadn‚Äôt been there before. He approached him and asked if he heard the music, too.

‚ÄúYou too?! I haven‚Äôt met anyone else who hears it. Except for one person. But now, I‚Äôm not even sure if I imagined her. I first heard it 27 years ago. I haven‚Äôt slept a wink since then. I haven‚Äôt been able to locate the source, but I‚Äôm close now. I am close, I can feel it!‚Äù

He took a step back and examined the man illuminated by the moonlight. He looked old, exhausted. Grotesque. His eye bags dug deep into his face, his eyes bulging out as much as his eye bags sank in. His teeth ‚Äî what little remained ‚Äî were thin and gray. His hands were frostbitten. He smoked a cigarette.  
He immediately noticed they were the only cigarettes he himself had ever smoked. He thought that, if he smoked so rarely, he might as well be picky.

The older man looked down. ‚ÄúI still sometimes wonder what she could have seen there...‚Äù

Looking at the older man, terror flooded his eyes and filled his insides. He ran down the stairs without thinking about where he was going. He was fleeing from the sight, from reality. But what destination could that even be? Can he really be blamed ‚Äî because what is more terrifying than staring the future straight in the eyes?

He descended so many floors that he wasn‚Äôt sure if he had passed his own apartment. The floors weren‚Äôt numbered. He decided it was safest to reach the ground floor and count the floors back up.

He descended for a long time. He noticed how quiet and still it was. He leaned against the wall, slid to the floor, and closed his eyes.

¬†

Sounds. Whimpers? Soft moaning. Sighs. The bed shaking. It came from the other side of the wall he was leaning on. Louder and louder‚Ä¶

He stood up and stepped away. He was disgusted. He now longed for the loud music. He went out to the corridor. As he searched his pockets for his cigarette pack, he noticed the same woman. She was looking at him. There was nothing to see.

‚ÄúI have to listen to this every night,‚Äù she complained. He took out his pack and offered her one. They both lit up.

‚ÄúI really enjoy your company; if only all men were as kind and audacious as you!‚Äù

He didn‚Äôt know how to respond. He didn‚Äôt see himself as either kind or audacious, nor had he shown this woman even a hint of those virtues.

‚ÄúShall I make us some coffee? We won‚Äôt be sleeping anytime soon anyway.‚Äù

She put out her cigarette and went into her apartment. She left the door open. He lingered outside for a moment, smoking. Against his own will, he put out his cigarette and followed her inside.

As she prepared two cups of Turkish coffee, she talked about everything and anything. Mostly, she complained. He wasn‚Äôt really listening. The only thing he could hear were rhythmic sighs and cries of pleasure.

‚ÄúShall we drink our coffee in the bedroom? The ambiance is much nicer there.‚Äù

The coffee was never touched. He knew where this was going. He didn‚Äôt like it, he didn‚Äôt want it. But he didn‚Äôt have the strength or the will to resist. He gave in. He was glad when it was over.

Somehow, everything fell silent. He closed his eyes, hoping that maybe, finally, he could fall asleep.

He opened them wide. He realized what he had done. The realization slowly spread through his body. He was disgusted, disgusted with himself. He ran out of the apartment. He didn‚Äôt know why. He was probably running from reality. He felt like the greatest adulterer. Was his self-control really that pitiful? Where was his voice when he needed to say no?

He didn‚Äôt know her. He didn‚Äôt even know her name. She meant so little to him that he hadn‚Äôt even thought to ask. He hadn‚Äôt introduced himself either. He was overthinking it. As if names were so important. After all, you don‚Äôt know his either.

He climbed the stairs and entered his apartment. He felt more exhausted than he had ever been in his life. He went to wash his face. To try to wash away the sin. He skipped brushing his teeth. He was too tired. He splashed his face with cold water and looked in the mirror. His eyes had sunken in.

He collapsed onto the bed. He didn‚Äôt close his eyes. He knew what was coming.

We have planned the itinerary and would love some feedback or recommendations (plus, we have some questions that I'll put below in bold).

Aug 30: Arrive in Medellin at 18.30hs

Aug 31: All day in Medellin, then take a night bus to Salento **(how to book it?)**

Sep 1: All day in Salento **(visit a coffee farm - any recommendation?)**

Sep 2: Still in Salento, visit Cocora Valley, sleep in Salento

Sep 3: Fly to Bogot√° in the morning

Sep 4-Sep 5: Still in Bogot√°

Sep 6: Fly to Cartagena in the morning and sleep there

Sep 7: Go for a day trip to Rosario Islands **(how to get there?)**, come back to Cartagena to sleep

Sep 8: Go to Minca **(how? bus?)**, sleep there

Sep 9: Leave to Tayrona in the morning, camp there at night

Sep 10: All day in Tayrona **(is it worth it to spend another day?)**, then go to Santa Marta to sleep

Sep 11: Fly to Medell√≠n in the morning

Sep 12: All day in Medell√≠n (day tour to Guatap√©)

<div>Metal basket decor ideas can bring a unique touch to your living room, combining functionality with style. These versatile decor pieces add texture, depth, and interest to your space, seamlessly aligning with various interior design themes ranging from industrial to modern chic.

One popular way to incorporate metal baskets is by using them as organizers. Placing a large, decorative metal basket near your seating area can keep magazines, throws, or toys neatly stored while enhancing the overall aesthetic. Choose a basket with intricate designs or a distressed finish to add character.

Another creative idea involves utilizing metal baskets as planters. By inserting a smaller pot into a sturdy metal basket, you can create an eye-catching display of plants that brighten up your living room. This idea works fantastically with succulents or cascading ivy, adding a natural element to the metal's rustic charm.

For wall decor, consider hanging several metal baskets in varied sizes. This trendy arrangement can serve not only as a striking visual element but also as functional storage for small items like keys or decorative items. Pairing different finishes, such as copper and blackened metal, can create a rich layered look.

Additionally, using smaller metal baskets as candle holders can create an inviting ambiance. Group several together on a coffee table or mantelpiece to enhance warmth and style during gatherings. This approach allows you to play with heights and shapes, providing a dynamic focal point in your living room.

Incorporate metal basket decor into your living room by mixing and matching different sizes, styles, and uses. From organizers to planters and decorative accents, metal baskets can elevate your space effortlessly, inviting creativity and personality into your home decor.

## Understanding Narrative Mapping: More Than Just a Map

Before we dive into specific tools, let's define what narrative mapping truly entails. It's more than simply placing pins on a map. It's about crafting an immersive experience for your audience,combining maps with text,images,videos,and other multimedia elements to create a cohesive and engaging story. A well-crafted narrative map can transport viewers to another place and time,allowing them to explore a location's history,culture,environment,or any other topic that can be linked to geography[ see reference URLs 1,4 and 5 above]. Just as choosing the best coffee maker depends on your individual needs, the best narrative mapping tool depends on the story you want to tell and the audience you want to reach. Some tools might be perfect for creating interactive travelogues. Others might be better suited for data-driven investigations.

## The Key Players in Narrative Mapping: A 2025 Viewpoint

Several narrative mapping tools stand out from the crowd, each with its own strengths and weaknesses. Let's take a closer look at some of the leading contenders:

*   **ArcGIS StoryMaps:** Developed by Esri, a leading provider of geographic information system (GIS) software, ArcGIS StoryMaps is a powerful and versatile tool for creating interactive narratives.

A more professional and comprehensive tool but may have a steeper learning curve. Just as some prefer the fine control of a pour over coffee maker, ArcGIS StoryMaps offers advanced features for users who want precise control over their maps and stories.

*   **Google My maps:** A simpler and more accessible option, Google My Maps is a great choice for beginners. It's integrated directly into Google Maps, making it easy to create custom maps with points, lines, and polygons. My Maps offers essential mapping capabilities but lacks the advanced storytelling features of ArcGIS StoryMaps. Its simplicity is a plus for many, just as a drip coffee maker appeals to those who want a quick and easy cup.

*   **Other Emerging Platforms:** The narrative mapping landscape is constantly evolving. Keep an eye out for new platforms and features that could emerge in the coming years. These might include specialized tools for specific industries (e.g., journalism, education, tourism) or platforms that leverage emerging technologies like virtual reality (VR) and augmented reality (AR).[[Explore Top Rated maps and stories on Amazon.]](https://storeins.com/nest-cam/?kw=maps and stories)
## Choosing the Right Tool: Matching Your Needs to the Platform

Selecting the ""best coffee maker"" is a personal decision dependent on budget, needs and taste. Choosing the right narrative mapping tool is very similar. To choose the best tool for your project, consider the following factors:

*   **Storytelling Needs:** What kind of narrative do you want to create? Are you focused on displaying locations with minimal description, or are you trying to drive a complex analysis by combining maps and other information? Complex stories benefit from more advanced tools that allow data customization and rich storytelling environments.

arcgis StoryMaps allows rich storytelling and offers many options for embedding external content. Google My Maps is more simplistic but easy to use.*   **Technical Expertise:** How comfortable are you with GIS software and mapping technology? Some tools have a steeper learning curve than others. If you're new to narrative mapping, you might want to start with a more user-friendly platform like Google My Maps. Coffee makers vary in complexity as well. Just as a ""Busy Professional"" wants a simple coffee maker, one might prefer a simpler mapping platform like Google My Maps if your mapping stories are simple and descriptive.

*   **Budget:** Some narrative mapping tools are free,while others require a subscription. Consider your budget and choose a tool that fits your financial constraints. Just as ""The budget Brewer"" seeks options for a coffee maker under $100, numerous free or low-cost narrative mapping tools exist if your needs are basic.

*   **Collaboration:** Do you need to collaborate with others on your narrative map? Some tools offer robust collaboration features that make it easy to work with a team.

1jlckha,https://www.reddit.com/r/lostafriend/comments/1jlckha/is_it_all_my_fault_is_there_any_hope/,Is it all my fault? Is there any hope?,"TW: domestic violence, suicidal ideation 

I recently had two close friends cut me off and it‚Äôs killing me. 

We were friends for several years. A couple years ago, I confided in them that my husband had been physically abusive but that I was unsure how/if to leave. They were great‚Äî supportive, protective, non-judgmental, etc.

Long story short, I leaned on them too much, asked for reassurance a lot, and was in a very negative place (I have a history of anxiety and depression). They started to distance themselves. I kept asking why and they kept saying I was overreacting, that everything was fine. But they never asked how I was anymore, even though I asked about them. They seemed to stop caring, stop responding to texts, etc.

I got really depressed about it bc I really trusted and cared for these people. I was also going through a lot of other stuff (a divorce, as it turned out, my special needs kids‚Äô being so violent and aggressive that we had to call the cops several times, etc). One of the friends and I had some conflicts/fights, but not the other. But when I didn‚Äôt contact them at all for 2 whole months, neither contacted me. When I reached out and talked about how hurt I was, how I felt they‚Äôd left me after promising they never would, how I was confused and depressed to the point of having unsafe thoughts and really, really needed to see them (I hadn‚Äôt seen them for months), they basically told me to leave them alone and one blocked me.

I can now see that some of my behavior was passive-aggressive or guilt-tripping (though I didn‚Äôt know it at at time, I honestly felt worthless and like a burden) that my ‚Äúunsafe thoughts‚Äù reference was sort of a suicide threat, though I didn‚Äôt realize or mean it that way. I just thought maybe they didn‚Äôt understand how much they meant to me or how much pain I was in. 

After six weeks of lots of reading and researching and coming to grips with the fact that some of my behavior was manipulative and wrong, I texted them asking if I could send a short apology letter, because I‚Äôd come to see that all the problems were my fault.

One kindly wrote back and said no apology letter was necessary and he was glad I was doing better and good luck on my continued journey. So, while reassuring, I think it‚Äôs also a goodbye forever and that kills me.

The other I don‚Äôt think has even read my message (she‚Äôs the one who blocked me, but only on iMessage and I sent the recent message through FB). 

Even though I realize that I was annoying and burdensome, I feel like they did some stuff that was not great either. I mean, I told them I was deeply depressed and unsafe and they basically responded to leave them alone‚Äî my life wasn‚Äôt worth a 30-minute cup of coffee to them, after all our years of friendship? None of the good things I did or the good times matter, only that I got too clingy and annoying when I was going through a terrible time in my life? I guess I was a bit accusatory and the allusion to suicide was manipulative, but don‚Äôt I get any grace for not being at my best given all the shit I was going through? How do you abandon a friend who you know has depression, who is coming out of an abusive relationship, who has two autistic teenagers . . . And it‚Äôs not like I wanted to just have a sob fest and vent to them all the time‚Äî I just wanted to continue being friends, text occasionally, etc.

It kills me not knowing what they think of me. Do they think I made all my problems up (I didn‚Äôt)? Am I really the only one to blame here? I still love them, and the thought of trying to move on without them just wrecks me. But I can‚Äôt reach out anymore, right? I have to let them come to me, if they decide to?

I hate that I seem to have lost all their care and respect and don‚Äôt really fully understand how or when or why exactly. Why did they keep telling me things were fine when I said something felt off? Why did they make plans w me and then bail, repeatedly? What is so awful about me that I have to lose these two people who I care about so much? I‚Äôm willing to take all the blame, even if I think that not truly everything was my fault (most of it probably was), if I could just have them back in my life. 

I cry every day. How do I get through this? It feels like I‚Äôm getting the wind knocked out of me, over and over and over.

And I can see that much of this situation sounds like I may have BPD, but this is not a pattern in my life. It just happened over these couple years with these couple of people. However, I do fit many of the symptoms in the context of this situation. ",1,1743106846.0,lostafriend,6,0.67,False

Every day, my parents walk into a spotless house‚Äîa clean living room, dishes washed, dried, and put away, clean cupboards wiped down, no washing up left for them to do. I also do the laundry, folding their clothes individually, vacuuming, mopping, cleaning the bathroom, and sweeping the stairs. Yet, I feel incredibly underappreciated.

The house is a mess every morning, and I am more than happy to clean up after everyone. But every weekend, when my parents are home, they still call me ‚Äúlazy‚Äù if I‚Äôm not quick enough to get something sorted, make someone tea, or unload the dishwasher‚Äîon top of all my other household work. Now, I‚Äôm also expected to cook dinner for everyone.

I am trying to build my own business while preparing for my new job, where I will be away for six months. After finishing my chores, I like to take some time for myself at a coffee shop. But now, on top of everything, I am being pressured to cook dinner too? My mum gets home from work at 3 PM, and most of the time, my sister and I cook for ourselves. However, my mother gets angry when I forget to cook something for my dad.

Sometimes, I am just exhausted from everything I do every day. I feel undervalued, like nothing I do is ever good enough. I even get criticized for going to Costa because my mum can‚Äôt go since she works. I get laughed at for not having moved out yet (even though I am moving in April) and looked down on for claiming benefits because I can‚Äôt afford my phone bill.

I constantly try to explain that I get tired too and that cooking dinner on top of everything else can sometimes be too much. I deserve a life and appreciation for all that I do. It takes me hours to clean, and it hurts when I‚Äôm called lazy, especially when they don‚Äôt have to lift a finger.

I have secretly planned to move away for 6‚Äì8 months and hopefully permanently, as I will be working on a cruise. I can‚Äôt take the name-calling, mockery, and lack of appreciation anymore. I am cutting my family off completely. I am tired. I feel run down. Most of all, I feel depressed.",308,1743106793.0,confession,87,0.96,False

For the rest of her life, she battled drug addiction, eating disorders, and mental illness. She was 47 years old when she was found dead on the toilet from an overdose.","By the time she was 17, Judy Garland was already reliant on ""pep pills,"" a.k.a. amphetamines, and was being hounded by studio executives regarding her weight and looks. One executive called her a fat hunchback and encouraged her to smoke in order to suppress her appetite.

Garland's grueling work schedule ‚Äî coupled with a strict diet of black coffee, chicken soup, and cigarettes imposed upon her by her Hollywood bosses ‚Äî set the stage for her lifetime of body dysmorphia and substance abuse. The star attempted suicide at least 20 times in her life until her fatal overdose in 1969.

I have seen a lot on f issues people have either them as they don‚Äôt make them the same anymore. Not looking for something more expensive.,"Ok so I got into baking at home for about 2 yrs now. I tend do mix everything my hand or rarely a hand mixer. I have a second hand bread machine for mixing dough which works perfectly. Aside from bread, I just like to bake cookies and cakes. Never mess with the frosting. I did once and it was a lot of work. I was looking into something to make butter easier than the hand mixer. I know people have used blenders and food processors. I have a Kitchenaid overseas that I never opened and not sure when I‚Äôm going back. In the meantime trying to see if it‚Äôs justified to get something here. Can‚Äôt fit a stand mixer on countertop as my real estate there is very limited and is dedicated to all of my coffee equipment and a small microwave. 

Baking for me is more of a hobby/therapy that I like doing at least once a week. Used to do it more but my husband wasn‚Äôt too happy of all the weight he gained and had to work on to loose lol. ",0,1743106424.0,AskBaking,9,0.5,False
