So this morning she texted me before work saying ""merry xmas eve!"" Super nice, but I notice she didn't or doesn't really use any relationship language. As in no x or no baby or no I miss you etc. Anyway, 

I text her saying I wish we could cuddle. She replies a couple more times then I say 

""A cuddle/sleep in then a gentle wonder to get a coffee!! The best combo""

""I love cuddling you darling!"" (trying to connect wrmly and romantically with the distance. 

""Have a good last day!!!!"" 

I stacked all this messages. Then she replies hours later ""Thanks <3"" 

Now, my main thing is that I send her warm and cute texts you know? I try to make an effort to let her know I am thinking of her and that I miss her etc. But sometimes I just don't get the warmth back like her ""thanks"" 

Maybe she is just that secure and comfortable and safe? Like its all good! or is there an energy imbalance?

I don't want this to get tl;dr but the key fact about me is that when I'm on holiday I don't actually do much: My best days are spent sat into coffee-shop windows, watching the world try to deal with the snow outside. So the expenses will be artificially low on that basis.

I'm also more cozy-space-friendly than most people: I do \*not\* need a whirlpool tub and a full-sized bar fridge in my room. I'd like the room to be comfortable, ideally a one-off place with no particle-board-franchise-branding, but the meals and the during-the-day activities will be nothing that requires the word ""splurge.""

The one exception is that it's been 25 years since I last strapped on a pair of skis, and I'd like to do two full ski days (so 2-3 nigthts) at Rusutsu, including equipment rental \*and\* clothing rental as well.

Can someone give me a realistic, relatively tight budget to expect? Google says, ""$1,100 to $2,600,"" which is, you will have noticed, literally useless. TIA.

♡When I stir my creamer into my coffee, I make a wish. 

☆Whenever a butterfly crosses my path, I sing *butterfly in the sky, I can go twice as high....*, and tell it *flutterbye, butterfly. Safe travels!* when it flies away. 

♡ I have solo dance parties in my bedroom or living room often. Great mood-lifters.

☆I like to go windows shopping. 

♡I daydream all the time. Especially before bed. (Is it still considered *day*dreaming if you do it at night?)

☆I give compliments to strangers when I'm out. 


♡ I use Pinterest, but not to make inspo boards, but rather mood boards. As in i make pinboards of all the different things i like, and when I need a pick-me-up, I go play on Pinterest and look at and expand my moodboards! 

☆And finally, (and this might be my favorite whimsical thing I do), I know how to juggle, and every now and then i like to go to my local toystore, grab a few balls, and juggle for anyone who'll watch, for no other reason other than to make them smile. It's lots of fun, especially for the young kids.

1pucrsb,https://www.reddit.com/r/astrologymemes/comments/1pucrsb/beauty_astrology/,#Beauty #astrology,"•Venus ruled people and people with Taurus and or libra tend to have a subtle and quiet beauty about them and often have roman features and are drawn to the art and public space environment scene. Monuments and library. They’re often very curvy and have very earthy and radiant features. An easy vibe and an easy attraction one that feels right and yet one that makes you crave them and their touch-an aphrodisiac(May be in the modeling scene or the screen kids/ acting is a possibility but might not be the end game/gluttonous spouses and sensual partnerships)

•moon and sun ruled people and or people with a lot of Leo and cancer tend to have striking features that give them a natural feminine(moon) or masculine(sun) look to them. They can be very bright and overwhelming yet above and expressive. They often look very youthful and vivacious and have tender and supple features.a very openly alluring energy one that makes you crave them insatiably without even knowing it-they’re desires bouncing off you like a end game tennis match(may attract caregivers/lime light and fame/success rooted in the energy given to others-dramatic love affairs and lovers who would give it all)

•mercury ruled and Virgo or Gemini people are usually lean and or fragile looking-fast moving ligaments and body parts and often live the fast moving city life-and the occasional mountain climbers and wildlife enthusiast. They have very mischievous looking features and look very young no matter their age. They can have bubbly smiles and no matter their size it can be hard for them to hold on to weight! Even if Taurus is present they may fluctuate weight wise often-yet find it easy to get back in shape. Their features are very delicate and in a sense perfectly suited for them-as if they were hand crafted.(morning jogs and all nighters at work-often the ones drinking coffee and on the move!/performers and the lyrical rappers! Dancers and wild life activist! Running for exercise and studying. Lovers here are usually either talkative or super attentive and the type to listen rather then speak-caring and reliable.)

•Jupiter or Neptune ruled and or Pisces and Sagittarius heavily influenced! Can be very translucent in how they look! Can have pale skin and may have cold bodies! Very timeless looks and seem to have looks from another era and often times from another life. Very nomadic type of bodies and can seem very loose and elusive to the touch. Delicate skin like Gemini and Virgo but may have very fleshy and organic looking features! Not heavily applied looks often don’t use much makeup or much work into grooming beards or body. Wavy and natural looking hair and a beauty that leaves much in mystery and a magnetic undercurrent of promise and release(art shows and galas/late night cruises and falling asleep on the park bench/deja vu and portraits-old Polaroid cameras and dangerous nights at the club-hallucinogens and “don’t”-lovers are confusing and demanding; they drain you and rejuvenate you all in one a very odd and deep welled buzz but one with its trials and tribulations)

•mars and Pluto ruled and or Scorpio and Aries heavily aspected. A intense and passionate Flore-they look like the night and feel like the galaxy burning above you in a theater play format. They have a very athletic and almost sexual look about their bodies even if they have the most baby like of faces. They have an unmistakable look in their eyes that is disarming to even the most powerful of men and the most willful of women. They also have a natural low glow about their skin almost like a sort of tan and an olive like radiance. There skin is of the oily variety which adds to the gleam they have. They’re hair is often wild or curly in its consistency and they usually have some sort of roughness to them be it their faces or body-they have scars and often carry a bit of bruises. They are magnetic and frightening and aren’t for those weak of heart-they radiate a fatalistic type of energy and one that often compels many in their wake.( these are the models without humor-the serious ones/the skaters and the ones alone at the party/the quiet night outs with friends and the walks down Manhattan-lovers are often intense and alluring, they have a force about them and often times can be transformative)

•Saturn and Uranus or a lot of Capricorn and Aquarius. Tend to have tall and or middle ground heights. Serious faces and aloof demeanors-systematic movements but also extremely mental and body compatibility in their movements(almost as if they’re bodies are so in sync with their mind) beautiful smiles and cheeky yet dry humor. Easy going but detached-caring yet distanced. Structured bodies and very angular features. The bones are often well framed but also tend to be the most fragile spot on the individual. They have a very cool yet icy magnetism one that leaves you craving their validation and their attention a swoon so deep you won’t even know you’ve been caught up. (Often the most seen in the modeling scene! Late nights at the office and brief cases/fancy dinners and Coachella/ Italy and Germany and Japan-south Korea come to mind here-lovers are serious and have a ambitious nature to them. Can struggle with intimacy and may be extremely loyal and dedicated to the partnership.)

1pucnu1,https://www.reddit.com/r/lowcarb/comments/1pucnu1/caffeine_blood_sugar/,Caffeine Blood Sugar,"Hi guys, I started wearing a CGM a few weeks ago, and I noticed something interesting about coffee and tea that causes BS climbing up in the morning. 

Some basic information about me: 
I'm not diabetic, but my baseline is between 100-110, but I should have very good insulin sensitivity based on my after meal data, I did test insulin once and c-peptide once separately, they were both normal (in the middle of the given range), so according to my research I'm physiologically (not pathological) insulin resistance which is a healthy state, and my high baseline can be caused by my long term low to no carb diet. I'm wearing a CGM to find out if I have insulin resistance (prediabtic) due to the high morning glucose levels. 

So as I mentioned I'm mostly on a low carb diet, cheated 2 times during the 3 weeks of wearing it just to see what would happen, so a big low carb meal would increase my blood sugar by no more than 20mg/dL (most of the time it's less than 10 if not close to 0), and a really high meal would increase 40mg/dL. 

But a latte or even a black tea with cream in the morning would spike blood sugar by 30, if I drink it within an hour, it'd just climb up non stop for an hour. I know this is not super new, but I'm wondering why caffeine even in black tea can cause as much a big spike as a carb meal. 

I wonder if anyone here: 
1. Has the same high baseline blood sugar especially if you wear a CGM? 
2. Does the coffee and tea part sound weird to you, and is this reported often here in this subreddit? 
3. If coffee even tea spikes my BS that profoundly, am I stop drinking anything in the morning that contains caffeine?

Excuse me if I say anything I’m not supposed to. For the last 5 years I worked at a non franchised small mom and pops diner where the majority of people who came in were older couples and older regulars who sit around the counter. And the usual Sunday church crowd. Used to make really good Christmas tips around this time of year, and people were usually generous even if they came in and just had a cup of coffee. I left that job in april because I had some legal troubles and had to do some time. Fast forward to September of this year, I got home but the mom and pops diner didn’t want to hire me back, fair enough, fine no big deal. Now I’m at Pizza Hut and though I don’t make as much as I was used to at the mom and pops diner I figured people would spend more here, they would tip more. WRONG. Just in the last two weeks I’ve had multiple tables leave without tipping a single cent, and one table who spent 70 dollars and left me a dollar and literal change. I am not ungrateful by any means, and I would understand if it was horrible service. But I was on top of things, not busy in the least, and checked and did refills. I guess it’s just discouraging and a little disappointing. I really do miss my friendly regulars whom I used to see almost every day. I also live in a very small and rural town. Hoping for a better year next year! Thanks for letting me rant. Anyone else having an off year as well??",5,1766544732.0,Serverlife,3,1.0,False

1pucl5h,https://www.reddit.com/r/diabetes/comments/1pucl5h/caffeine_blood_sugar_spike/,Caffeine Blood Sugar Spike,"Hi guys, I started wearing a CGM a few weeks ago, and I noticed something interesting about coffee and tea that causes BS climbing up in the morning. 

Some basic information about me: 
I'm not diabetic, but my baseline is between 100-110, but I should have very good insulin sensitivity based on my after meal data, I did test insulin once and c-peptide once separately, they were both normal (in the middle of the given range), so according to my research I'm physiologically (not pathological) insulin resistance which is a healthy state, and my high baseline can be caused by my long term low to no carb diet. I'm wearing a CGM to find out if I have insulin resistance (prediabtic) due to the high morning glucose levels. 

So as I mentioned I'm mostly on a low carb diet, cheated 2 times during the 3 weeks of wearing it just to see what would happen, so a big low carb meal would increase my blood sugar by no more than 20mg/dL (most of the time it's less than 10 if not close to 0), and a really high meal would increase 40mg/dL. 

But a latte or even a black tea with cream in the morning would spike blood sugar by 30, if I drink it within an hour, it'd just climb up non stop for an hour. I know this is not super new, but I'm wondering why caffeine even in black tea can cause as much a big spike as a carb meal. 

I wonder if this sounds weird to you, and is this reported often here in this subreddit? 

Thanks so much for taking the time, I know my post is a bit long because I wanted to provide some background. ",0,1766544708.0,diabetes,1,0.5,False
1puck99,https://www.reddit.com/r/WritingHub/comments/1puck99/framework_the_5_blocks_nobody_talks_about/,Framework: The 5 Blocks Nobody Talks About,"You sit down to write. The page is blank. Your mind is blank.

You've tried everything:

* Changed your environment
* Adjusted your schedule
* Read other writers for inspiration
* Taken walks
* Made coffee
* Dimmed the lights

Nothing worked.

So you googled ""overcome writer's block"" and found 50 articles saying the same thing: *""Just write and don't wait for inspiration.""*

You tried. It didn't help.

Here's why: **You're probably using the wrong strategy for your specific block.**

# Writer's Block Isn't One Problem

Most advice treats writer's block as a single issue with one solution.

It's not.

Writer's block is actually multiple different problems masquerading as the same thing. Each one requires a different strategy.

# Some ""Blocks"" Aren't Even Blocks

First, let's rule out what isn't actually writer's block:

**""I'm too tired""** isn't writer's block. It's exhaustion. Sleep fixes it, not motivation.

**""I don't have time""** isn't writer's block. It's scheduling. Calendar management fixes it, not writing advice.

**""My idea isn't good enough""** isn't writer's block. It's perfectionism. Your idea becomes good *through writing*, not thinking about it.

These aren't writing problems. They're life problems.

# The Real Blocks That Sabotage Your Writing

Then there are the actual blocks:

**The Perfectionist's Paralysis:** That voice saying ""this won't be good enough, don't even bother.""

**The Blank Page Terror:** Pure emptiness paralysis—not lacking ideas, but lacking direction.

**The ""I'm Lost"" Block:** Starting to write but not knowing what you're writing (scene? monologue? description?).

**The Comparison Trap:** Reading great writing and convincing yourself yours can never compete.

**The Stakes Block:** Writing something you don't actually care about finishing.

Each one needs a different solution.

# Why Generic Advice Fails

You've probably read:

*""Just write something""* — Too vague when you're paralyzed.

*""Don't wait for inspiration""* — Doesn't address the voice saying it won't be good.

*""Write every day""* — Doesn't work if your block is about form, not discipline.

*""Know your story first""* — Impossible if you discover your story through writing.

These aren't bad advice. They're just not *your* advice. They solve different problems than the one blocking you.

It's like being told to fix a headache by changing your shoes. Maybe that works if tight shoes caused it. But if it's caffeine withdrawal, you need different medicine entirely.

# What Actually Works

Here's the key insight:

**Writing flows because of clarity and constraints, not because of inspiration.**

When you know what you're writing, why it matters, and what boundaries you're working within—your brain stops debating and starts creating.

Constraints aren't limiting. They're liberating.

# The Gap

The difference between writers who breakthrough and writers who stay stuck?

They figure out which block they actually have.

I wrote a deeper breakdown covering each block type, exact strategies for each one, and how to diagnose yours: [\[link to Medium Article\]](https://medium.com/@everydaygamer/youre-using-the-wrong-strategy-for-your-writer-s-block-76e11e1b6d0a)

At one point when you dont have an income or a job things get tough. I am a student and flexible jobs are scarce rn around here.

It won’t make you rich but you can get yourself a coffee to motivate yourself. And again it’s for the ones outthere who just need something to keep going. Just download an app called Eureka (it has a money symbol with white background) And then make an account and take surveys. I tried others and they are scams or take too long so dont even bother. This one pays out instantly. My strategy is to aim for the ones that take less time or pay about $1. I make 8-10 bucks daily. You gotta spend a couple of hours (sometimes less) but it’s money. I do this early morning like at 6-8am. Then move on with my day. Ooooh and use this code for a sign up bonus they’ll give you some bucks for free as a new user 3FR5G7.

1pucjpn,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1pucjpn,Melvin’s Maggot Farm (18 minute read),"**Melvin’s Maggot Farm**

Melvin was bullied relentlessly. At times, it felt like the almost comical youth ultra-violence seen in the books of King and Burgess. The older kids would throw rocks at him, yank his hair, drag him around by his unfortunately large ears and throw him into the mud bank on the edge of the football field. Not too long ago, they set fire to his locker. I never knew who exactly did it, but that was the rumour I heard while waiting in the fire assembly out in the rain. 

Melvin was an easy target. 

He was thoroughly overweight, had pasty skin the color of bacon fat and smelled of something I don't care to mention. His nose looked like an invisible hand was pulling his nostrils firmly upwards and his hair was a shade of bistre with the texture of wet straw. He should be wearing glasses, but they'd only ever last a day and medicaid can only go so far. 

The worst bit was that he didn't have the smarts to make up for it. It wasn't like he was some quiet academic who'll eventually one up his bullies, not through violence but through success. In class, he was a failure. It wasn't all his fault though. Our school was pathetically underfunded, and Melvin had no way of getting the extra help he needed. He lived on the other side of the tracks, a caravan park on the edge of town that my mother warned me never to go near. I didn't know much about his home life, until it was all over the news.

Melvin did have one thing he excelled in though. When I was younger, around five or six, I was actually good friends with him. That was before it became common law not to be associated with him. Any time I spent with him, he'd shower me in bug facts. Even now, whenever he had a moment of solace at school, he'd spend it crouched in the corner of the yard, digging through the earth with his rusted fork. Any insects he found he'd store away in a little plastic bag he brought everywhere with him. He would fill that bag with just about any small creature he got his hands on. Then, when it was almost full, he'd seal it and turn its contents into a fine mush with a rock. For the rest of the week, you'd never see him without that bag. That is, until someone inevitably took it from him and he had to begin the process all over again. 

Now, nobody liked Melvin. I didn't either, not that I felt the need to violently show it. If you had told me last year that I'd end up spending my summer hanging out with him, I probably would've spat on you. It started with a little girl's bike. Me and my friends were dicking around in my cul-de-sac when Chet, the anthropomorphic glue that kept our friend group together, decided it would be funny to steal the bicycle of my neighbour's five year old daughter. We egged him on and he went through with it, and spent the rest of the day riding around on it. By the evening, he'd gotten tired of it and dumped it on the edge of the creek. 

As soon as I returned home, my mother confronted me about it. Apparently, that little girl spent the entire day balling her eyes out in the middle of the street. Admittedly, I snitched immediately. Chet ended up being fined an amount he never told us. After it came out that I was the one who grassed, I was persona non grata. Within the week, I knew what it was like to be Melvin. I spent yard time standing on my own, lamenting. Still, I never tried to find a friend in Melvin, thought I wouldn't have to stoop that low.

This all carried on until the summer, and beyond. By mid-June, social solitary confinement was getting to me. I thought long and hard about extending an olive branch to Melvin, but always decided against it. Eventually, my mind was made up for me. One morning my mother woke me up around noon and told me that there was a friend waiting for me at the door. I leapt out of bed, hoping it was someone from my old posse. Maybe even Chet, coming to make up. Instead, I found Melvin awkwardly standing on my front porch. 

“What do you want?” I launched into an interrogation.

“I was wondering if you'd come play with me today” He told me in his low, nasally voice. 

After a minute of internal debate, I thought “fuck it”. I shouted to my mom that I'll be back before dinner and left to spend the day with Melvin. 

Our first conversation together felt like dialogue from one of those shitty “how to make friends” books. He attempted some polite icebreakers, told a few bad jokes and offered me a piece of apple flavoured chewing gum. I declined since the packet had a bit of a stain on it. Before long, our interactions began to resemble normal. 

We made our way down to the creek, chatting and hitting things with sticks. Melvin is an interesting guy, once you get to know him. Apparently, he did live in the trailer park, but not in a trailer. His step-dad was the landlord, and they lived in a large house at the head of the grounds. His mother worked long hours at some place or another, and Melvin spent a lot of time home alone. 

As we were talking, and traversing our way over a moss covered log, Melvin suddenly squealed with delight and pointed at something I couldn't see. He jumped from the felled tree and dropped to his knees, scrounging around in the mud. I crouched next to him and watched in awe as he pulled out the largest, thickest grub I'd ever seen out from under a leaf. 

“Woah man, that's disgusting. Cool!” I yelled. 

Melvin held the grub uncomfortably close to his lips as he gazed longingly at it. Eventually, he snapped out of the trance and, with his free hand, rummaged around in a fanny pack. He pulled out a plastic zip-lock bag filled with a rancid paste of crushed invertebrates. He opened it with his teeth and gently placed the grub inside of it. He zipped it up again and stuffed it back inside of his pack. 

“Why do you do that?” I asked him, bluntly. 

“Do what?” Melvin replied.

“You know,” I answered, “That thing you always do. With the plastic bags and the insects”.

Melvin shrugged earnestly and that was the last we talked on that subject. 

This became my summer routine. Almost every other day, I'd spend hours hanging out with Melvin, usually down at the creek. I made sure, as best I could, to not be seen by any of my old friends. If it came out that I was spending my time with Melvin, any last hopes I had of clawing back my popularity were done for. 

On this particular day in July, me and Mel were walking to our usual spot. I peeped over the brow of a small yet steep hill just before he did. I quickly dropped to the ground when I saw Chet and a few others on the other side, making their way towards us. I scurried backwards and pathetically took off running, past Melvin and across to the other side of the clearing. Panting, I glanced from behind the tree I was using as my hiding place. I watched Chet and the gang lock eyes with Melvin as she climbed down from the slope. Before he could run like me, they pounced on him. I carried on watching and they buried his face into the mud, stamping on his hand and pinching his neck. I turned around and walked back home. 

I didn't see Melvin for a few days after that. When he did finally turn up at my door again, he had a black eye and a swollen lip. I stupidly asked him “Are you OK?” and left it at that. I didn't bother apologising. I didn't think there was anything to say sorry for at the time. 

It was that day he suggested we should hang out at his house. I was reluctant, but seeing the state he was in, I understood his reasoning. Despite my mother's warning, I followed Melvin to the trailer park. It was as run-down as I imagined. Bits of scrap metal and old cars were strewn across the front lawns of the caravans. From old wire hung wet clothes, that dripped a slow rain onto the already sodden earth underneath. I would've believed you if you told me the place was abandoned. 

Melvin’s house emerged further down the trail. It was an infancy bungalow, although it at least had a fresh lick of paint. Tacked onto the side of it was a small reception. Melvin informed me both of his parents were working. His father owned the source of the low rent, that being the dump next to the trailer park. He admitted that he didn't know where his mother worked, but that she was out all day, most days. 

The first thing I noticed was the dust. Every surface in his house was covered in a thin skin of dust and cobwebs. The place smelled strange. I honestly couldn't think of a better adjective for it. The wall paper was completely mismatched and when I looked more closely at the dozens of pictures hanging up, I realised that each of them seemed to display a different family. 

I was too preoccupied during the rest of our time together to ask him about it. We had drinks and snacks, of which he seemed to have an endless supply of both. We realised that we both were big fans of the same trading card game, so a few hours of that scorching hot day were spent in his room playing it. He had some pretty rare, expensive cards in his collection, and every time his back was turned I made sure to pocket one. 

Melvin’s room was a mess. It stank of piss and the corners were decorated with black mold. Clothes were everywhere, as were roaches. If one ever scuttled in front of him, he'd crush it with his fist and smear the mushed remains against his trouser legs to clean it from his hand. It was around this point I decided that spending the summer on my own wasn't all that bad. After we'd finished up with all the activities he could strain out of my visit, I excused myself to go home. 

“Wait!” He shouted, grabbing my wrist as I walked outside. 

“What?” I said, through gritted teeth, as I tried to politely pull myself free from his grasp. 

“There's something I really wanted to show you!” he snorted, “I can't believe I haven't brought my best friend to see it yet.”

I sighed 

“What do you want to show me, Melvin?”

“My maggot farm!” he said and began to lead me to it. 

The heat outside was much more bearable than it'd been earlier, but still thoroughly uncomfortable. Melvin ignored the rest of my questions, instead opting to silently drag. We ended up at the far corner of the trailer park. There was a few yards of lame forest cover between the edge of the trailer park and the corrugated iron fencing of his dad’s dump yard. A portion of the rusted fence had collapsed, and on top of it was an old, white water tank, as well as a myriad of other smaller pieces of trash. 

The tank was around four feet high and six feet wide, not including the lid. I stood back and watched Melvin struggle to push the immense metal lid off the top of the tank. I chuckled to myself and looked around. I only now realised how secluded we were. Before I could ask Melvin if he wanted any help, the lid fell back enough to release the foulest smelling odour I've ever known, before or since. It made me physically recoil and gag. I quickly covered my mouth and nose with my baseball cap. 

“What the actual fuck, Melvin!?” I said, muffled by the fabric. 

“It's my maggot farm.” Melvin told me. “I've been working on it for some time now. I collect roadkill a lot. I leave them to fester in this drum and after a while it becomes filled with maggots. Come have a closer look.”

I stared in pure shock at Melvin. He looked like a prideful child, finally getting to share his glittery art piece with his parents. When I didn't immediately take a peek at it, he spoke again, more forcefully this time. 

“I said come take a look.”

Reluctantly, I took two steps forward and glanced quickly over the metal rim, intent on getting it over with. For a second, I thought my mind was playing tricks on me. I had to look again, longer this time, to make sure. 

The tank was full of rotting meat. Intestines and bits of fur and bone fragments added an extra texture to the rancid soup. A bizarre yellow, oily liquid pooled around the flesh. Worst of all, it was infested with countless maggots. The tiny white stubs squirmed in their viscous home. Clusters of holes gave way to more and more eggs, ready to hatch a new generation of maggots. Eventually, they'd become flies and start the process all over again. 

“Melvin, that has got to be the most disgusting thing I've-”

Before I could finish, Melvin swung a discarded tire iron into the back of my head. My world turned to nothing and I crumpled to the ground. I woke up an unknowable amount of time later. It could've been hours, more likely a few minutes. It was pitch black. Total, absolute darkness. I took a deep breath in and instantly knew where I was.

I tried to stand up but my head hit the inside of the lid. I slipped in the swirling stew of rot which rose up above my waist and fell. Some of it went in my mouth. I gagged and threw up, adding my vomit to the concoction. The smell was so foul it burnt away the hairs in my nostrils. I began to feel the miniscule, tearing bites of the maggots. It was like a swarm of gnats. I writhed around, imagining my unseen attacks borrowing into my skin and laying eggs. 

My head still hurt like hell. It took me a while to realise what had happened. In my state of panic, the first thing I checked were the cards in my back pocket. I figured they'd be ruined now, stained and soaking beyond any recognition. I felt for them, but they weren't there. I started to bang on the steel walls of my prison, screaming and hoping that someone would hear me. No one did. 

My foot brushed against a firm hunk of meat somewhere on the far side of the tank and I recoiled, making myself as small as possible, curling up into a fetal ball of fear. I'd never been more afraid in my life. My cousin told me about sniffing glue and not that long ago I tried it for myself. The gasses coming from the rot had a similar effect. I could feel my brain cells dying. 

Eventually, I was able to form a cognitive thought, that was that I should try to chip away at the patches of rust that lined the inside of the tank. I felt around directly in front of me for something that could be used as a tool. I imagined I'd find a sturdy piece of bone, but I found something far different. It had a metallic center and two rigid strips of fabric attached to either side. It was a watch. I held it up and felt around in the darkness for the buttons. I pressed one, and all it did was beep. I'm sure that had some effect, but nothing of use. I pressed another one, and likewise all it did was beep. The third, however, triggered the small, digital display light. In the brief second of vision it caused, I saw that there was someone else in here with me. 

I froze. My constant state of thrashing, caused by the maggots penetrating my skin, stopped. With a shaking hand, I pressed the LED on again, holding it down this time. Sitting across from me was Melvin. He was naked, or at the very least didn't have his shirt on. He was watching me with content eyes. He smiled when he knew that I'd seen him. I realised that the piece of meat my foot brushed against minutes before was his leg. 

“M… M… M…” 

I was a mess. I struggled to form basic thoughts, let alone a challenging question. 

“What… the… fuck..” was all I managed to spit out. 

Melvin giggled to himself, but said nothing. Instead, he went back to picking maggots out from their bloody nest and stuffing them in his mouth. I began to gag and heave again. There was physically nothing left in me to throw up, so instead my vomit was composed of stomach acid and bile. Once I was finished spilling my guts, I remembered the plan. 

I shoved the watch into my pocket, not wanting to have to look at Melvin anymore. I felt around in the sludge, and almost immediately found what I was looking for. It was a chunk of jaggard jaw bone, from the skull of a dear or large dog. I turned and started to scrape it against a patch of brittle rust. Gradually, I felt layers of oxidised metal flakes peel off. Finally, with a powerful stab, I pushed the bone straight through it. A small, olive-sized hole let in the first ray of natural light in what felt like forever. I quickly pressed my mouth against the hole, accidentally breathing in tiny shards of rust as I gasped for fresh air. 

While I pressed my body against the walls of the drum, I felt something below me. I couldn't reach with my hand, but my shin brushed against yet another patch of rust. It was right at the base, where a bad welding job attached the two main parts of the water tank. With my mouth still clasped around freedom, I kicked violently at the fragmenting barrier. Moving my legs was like trying to run in a vat of molasses. Again and again and again I kicked at it until finally my foot broke through. I was filled with hope and stamped at the loose debris, trying desperately to create an opening large enough for me to squeeze through. The fetid liquid oozed out as the gaping wound in the side of the tank grew wide enough for a twelve year old to pull himself through. 

“Hey, HEY!” Melvin roared from right behind me. 

I ignored him and took a deep breath from the smaller of the two holes. I pinched my nose, closed my eyes and plunged beneath the rotting surface. I left my baseball cap behind me as I felt around for my exit. I grabbed the rim, cutting my hand on the sharp edges. I yanked myself down and, finally, out. Like a newborn, my head, covered in filth, erupted from the steel womb. It was followed by my two arms, which grabbed onto the grass in front of me. I began pulling myself out. 

My forward motion stopped at my waist. I was stuck fast, tearing clumps of grass from the sodden earth as I tried desperately to free myself. Suddenly, I felt someone grab my foot. Melvin was trying to drag me back in. I screamed and planted my hand on either side of the entrance, painfully pushing myself forward. I kicked back, struggling against his vice-like grip. Finally, the sole of my shoe made contact with his jaw. The momentum of the strike propelled me from the drum and sent me tumbling out onto the rot-soaked ground. 

As soon as I was free, I bolted. I staggered to my feet and ran as fast as my weary body could manage. I plodded through the tangled foliage, narrowly avoiding a discarded washing machine. I didn't look back as I streaked past the trailers, their occupants watching me in confusion and disgust. I cut through the creek, not wanting anyone to see me in this state. I emerged near my house, and walked the last few yards, exhausted. 

This took place in the Summer of 1995, and was a pivotal moment in my life. I go to therapy often, not only because of the events of that day but it does tend to come up in almost every session. My mother was so disturbed by what happened to me, she rang the police. A cop turned up at my house to talk to. He was trying to figure out exactly what had happened. Once I spewed my account, and he finished his coffee, he thanked us and turned to leave. Just before he did, he spotted the digital watch in the kitchen bin. It was the one that had been in my pocket since the incident, the one my mother threw away along with my ruined clothes.  

He turned white when he saw it. He grabbed some tissue paper and wrapped his hand in it, picking up the filth covered watch which had, to the cop, an oddly familiar gecko pattern on the straps.

“Where did you find this?” he said in a low, worrying voice. 

I told him that I was the watch I mentioned in my account, the one I found in the maggot farm. 

My parents never told me what happened next. It was to protect me, I suppose. A day later, it was plastered all over the local news that a small business owner and dedicated family man, who I realised was Melvin's dad, had been arrested. Anytime it was mentioned, my mother would quickly turn the channel over. As far as I could remember, I never saw Melvin again. He stopped showing up to school, and the prevailing theory was that he’d been made to live with his Aunt the state over. Not that I could talk to any about it, as in Melvin’s absence, I became the new punching-bag for anyone with a broken home life for the rest of middle school.

I'm forty-two now, and have kids of my own. A boy and a girl, aged six and eight. I moved away from my hometown long, long ago, and now live a quaint, happy life. Recently, my brother visited, and told me about a Facebook group he recently joined that was dedicated to my old school. 

Yesterday evening, I sat down with my kids to show them what I had to put up with, and to get a nice dose of nostalgia. The most recent post was about a boy I didn't recognise, but soon remembered was the younger brother of my old friend Simon. A few days ago was the 30th anniversary of his disappearance. The comments were filled with outpourings of sympathy and reminiscing. I looked at the photo and then at my son. As a parent, hearing about these sorts of stories really strikes a nerve. I studied the boy in the picture while my children fired a barrage of questions at me. His sweet grin and rosy cheeks brought a tear to my eye as I mentally put myself in the position of his grieving parents all those years ago. 

I wonder what my children were thinking as they watched me drop the phone, then fall to my knees, wailing and crying into my hands. After all, they didn't notice the watch the boy in the photo was wearing, nor did they know the significance of the gecko pattern straps.

Company did not like me taking too much time off and I just quit. Been couple of years. No property, still rent, but more than 50 x expenses in GIA, ISA, SIPP. So I guess I dont need to work for financial reasons. 

Initially just wanted a 1 year break, but I am an inertia guy. I dont change state easily. During working years never imagined I would stop working but that is where I am now. Worked couple of decades in one company so no idea how to even write a CV. Worked in enterprise tech, but not in core engineering ie product development, not functional, not a manager either. I was a tech in professional services which is neither here nor there. But I was a valued member of team and was good at research / troubleshooting, working with customer. I was a techie but not a hotshot developer. 

Without work I am not bored per se, I waste a lot of time listening to talk radio but I like it, follow various blogs / vlogs on tech, maths etc. I read what interests me, sometimes drift etc. But no goals. I am single / no family. Fortunately no vices but my sleep schedule is messed up : 3 AM to 11 AM. I think its important to have routine and a sense of fulfilment/problem solving for dopamine. Also social aspect of work. Former colleagues have little time. 

Met an old colleague recently for coffee. He took one look at me and said ""I think you will never come back to paid work"". Maybe I looked too chilled. After hearing that I feel like a failure. 

I think I need to find something interesting in tech. Not smart enough to work in FAANG / Fintech. Age(57), AI/LLM, general economic slowdown, couple year gap means it wont be easy to get in. 

Any suggestions ? Maybe tech opportunities in large UK non tech businesses. Maybe too late and I have to accept retirement.

1puccaj,https://www.reddit.com/r/KeepWriting/comments/1puccaj/the_5_blocks_nobody_talks_aboutand_how_to_fix/,The 5 Blocks Nobody Talks About—And How to Fix Yours,"You sit down to write. The page is blank. Your mind is blank.

You've tried everything:

* Changed your environment
* Adjusted your schedule
* Read other writers for inspiration
* Taken walks
* Made coffee
* Dimmed the lights

Nothing worked.

So you googled ""overcome writer's block"" and found 50 articles saying the same thing: *""Just write and don't wait for inspiration.""*

You tried. It didn't help.

Here's why: **You're probably using the wrong strategy for your specific block.**

# Writer's Block Isn't One Problem

Most advice treats writer's block as a single issue with one solution.

It's not.

Writer's block is actually multiple different problems masquerading as the same thing. Each one requires a different strategy.

# Some ""Blocks"" Aren't Even Blocks

First, let's rule out what isn't actually writer's block:

**""I'm too tired""** isn't writer's block. It's exhaustion. Sleep fixes it, not motivation.

**""I don't have time""** isn't writer's block. It's scheduling. Calendar management fixes it, not writing advice.

**""My idea isn't good enough""** isn't writer's block. It's perfectionism. Your idea becomes good *through writing*, not thinking about it.

These aren't writing problems. They're life problems.

# The Real Blocks That Sabotage Your Writing

Then there are the actual blocks:

**The Perfectionist's Paralysis:** That voice saying ""this won't be good enough, don't even bother.""

**The Blank Page Terror:** Pure emptiness paralysis—not lacking ideas, but lacking direction.

**The ""I'm Lost"" Block:** Starting to write but not knowing what you're writing (scene? monologue? description?).

**The Comparison Trap:** Reading great writing and convincing yourself yours can never compete.

**The Stakes Block:** Writing something you don't actually care about finishing.

Each one needs a different solution.

# Why Generic Advice Fails

You've probably read:

*""Just write something""* — Too vague when you're paralyzed.

*""Don't wait for inspiration""* — Doesn't address the voice saying it won't be good.

*""Write every day""* — Doesn't work if your block is about form, not discipline.

*""Know your story first""* — Impossible if you discover your story through writing.

These aren't bad advice. They're just not *your* advice. They solve different problems than the one blocking you.

It's like being told to fix a headache by changing your shoes. Maybe that works if tight shoes caused it. But if it's caffeine withdrawal, you need different medicine entirely.

# What Actually Works

Here's the key insight:

**Writing flows because of clarity and constraints, not because of inspiration.**

When you know what you're writing, why it matters, and what boundaries you're working within—your brain stops debating and starts creating.

Constraints aren't limiting. They're liberating.

# The Gap

The difference between writers who breakthrough and writers who stay stuck?

They figure out which block they actually have.

I wrote a deeper breakdown covering each block type, exact strategies for each one, and how to diagnose yours: [\[link to Medium\]](https://medium.com/@everydaygamer/youre-using-the-wrong-strategy-for-your-writer-s-block-76e11e1b6d0a)

I decided to break NC and unblock her just to write this. I have now reblocked her. I just couldn’t let her have the last word (it’s not my style: 

“Dearest \\\[MIL\\\], I saw that email and I am so sorry you feel that way. My deepest desire was to be close with you and I tried so hard for years, including only a couple of weeks ago when I hoped we could all come together to support \\\[DH\\\] in \\\[X\\\]. I was so sad you didn’t come (as was \\\[DH\\\]) but ready to see you in the new year! 

Obviously seeing you say I’m “wicked”,  “bad genes”, “narcissistic”, “disturbed” are truly awful things. I would never speak about you or \\\*anyone\\\* with such disrespect. That is not my personality. But it is clear just how much you despise me and there is no chance for a relationship. So we can all now move on. 

As for saying the “bad genes” comment  and “what hope is there for your children” that truly scares me as I always hoped you would be a wonderful grandmother to our future children. But you seem to have your views shaped already on that and no future children of ours will be exposed to such cruel views. 

I wish you the most wonderful Christmas with your family and I hope that this closure brings you the peace it has finally brought me. All the best. Xxx”

DH also sent an email addressing each of her points and saying it was insane that she wanted to meet me for a “nice coffee” whilst saying I’m disturbed/have bad genes etc. He ended saying he needs time and space to reflect on whether a relationship is possible.  

It really was such an own goal from MIL  because I was feeling pressure from DH before this to break NC and had she sent a genuinely nice email I would have been in a difficult position. Instead MIL has just united us more.

We are a family of five who are in Singapore for the holidays. We are staying in a chain hotel here, which is nice though by no means luxurious. The hotel gives free breakfast to all its guests. Today at breakfast, this Dutch woman had the audacity to ask me if I would give the orange I had to her child who ""loves oranges"". The breakfast is between 6.30 and 10 am. She arrived at around 9.45am with her daughter and both had their plates full of sausages and eggs and whatnot. There were no fruits left that these two liked apparently. For context: we are a family of vegetarians and like in most of South-East and East Asia, the breakfast here is almost entirely made up of stuff we can't eat, so our choices are bread and condiments and tea and coffee along with some fruits. Between the five of us, we had three fruits. Instead of asking the staff if they had more oranges left or buying her child an orange from the many shops that surround the hotel or coming early for breakfast, she had the nerve to ask me for my orange. I refused to part with it and then she went on a tirade of how her child only likes oranges. A few years ago, my father was posted in the Netherlands for a year and when we lived there, I had enough run-ins with the Dutch ""directness"", which in my opinion is largely a mask for entitlement and general assholeness. With that context in mind, I couldn't dismiss this morning's incident as a one-off. Of course, not all Dutch folks behave similarly, but in general there's a thread that runs through them, especially the women, that makes me think - are we even living on the same planet and were you not taught any manners whatsoever? I am wondering if others too encounter this Dutch ""directness"" in its myriad forms and if they call it out. In the country where I am from, such behaviour would be considered extremely impolite...",1,1766543061.0,Vent,1,1.0,False
1puc189,https://www.reddit.com/r/TalesFromTheCreeps/comments/1puc189/i_found_a_diary_in_the_woods/,I Found A Diary In The Woods,"I used to enjoy camping. Going outside and being amongst nature was a true pleasure, something that I would do most weekends, come rain or shine. I no longer want to do this. Not anymore. I've tried to think, theorise even, about what I have been through. Something rational, something real to this experience. I just can't. I'm hoping that writing this down might help? Help me process this shit, or at least try to.

It happened on Saturday, which was two days ago. I had gotten up early, hoping to make a quick head start so I had the rest of the day to do what I wanted. I had been planning this weekend for a couple of weeks now, finally having a long weekend to enjoy myself. I wasn't needed in to work on Monday, so it allowed me to spend the next couple of days camping in my local woodland, Tingrass Woods. Tingrass is relatively small, being only about 15 hectares, but its beauty is unlimited. Shimmering streams and endless oak trees are some of the more dazzling features in there, however, I personally believed that the old mines surrounding the woods were the spotlights.

Tingrass, like its namesake, used to have tin mining in the area. Tin was the town's livelyhood, and was used often for ""revolutionary"" tin cans. The majority of men worked down there in those caverns, and nearly everyone who lives in the town today had at least one person in their family tree who mined tin. However, on the 4th of December 1966, the Shear shaft collapsed and around 20 men were trapped under the roof of the cave that day. The Shear mineshaft was well-known as the cave with the most amount of tin hiding within it, and so, they mined there the most. It was thought they hit a supporter beam, and because of the cavern's weakened state, the entire ceiling fell. The state spent a month trying to get them out, but it was no use. The boulders were too big, and there wasn't much to do anything about it. My grandfather was caught in the devestation, and in the end, my father was left with his mother and his two younger sisters.

They're mostly blocked off nowadays, and it's extremely difficult to even reach the entrances due to the rangers patrolling the area all day and night for rambunctious kids looking for somewhere to get wasted or already-tipsy adults looking to get even more wasted. However, most people just watch them from afar, creeped out by the things. I mean, the black voids of the openings were definitely unnerving, to say the least. But, I found an eerie curiosity with them. My grandfather worked in those mines all his life, quite literally. My dad used to take my brother Tommy and I there when we went camping as kids and told us how, ""our grandaddy used to work day and night in those caves."" It’s part of my family history, and somewhere in that deep dark, my grandfather is lying there. Dad had never wanted to go down there, though. He stayed far away from them when camping and if he ever came close to mines, he'd come back home all jumpy, checking every room in the house and hugging my mom, Tommy and I when he saw us.

I suppose that strange anxiety is why he taught my brother and I how to get around those woods and to never go in those mines. I've been tempted, of course, but I've always stopped myself before I ever tried to sneak in. I didn't want to end up like my grandfather, and so, I avoided going in them for most of my life. Still, we continued to hike and camp with them in sight, which slightly desensitised my brother and I to their prescence.

I don't feel that way much anymore.

I packed enough food and drinks for the next couple of days, organising them in my rucksack. Beans and noodles would do me fine, and I even brought my portable kettle for coffee. This was a routine packing that I had done many times before. My tent would be in the left-hand side of my rucksack, with the sleeping bag resting in the middle, on top of the food and water. On the right would be my GPS, maps, and essentials, like first aid supplies, portable chargers, etcetera. Easy enough to remember, even with my terrible memory.                        I set off at eight-thirty in the morning. Riding in my beloved Toyota Tacoma, the roads were thankfully clear. The bright sun shone beautifully over the Montana fields that day. I took a couple of pictures along the way to send to Tommy, who had moved out of state last year. He was living the high life at Stanford, lucky bastard.

I finally reached Tingrass at around nine-ish. The wind was low, and the late summer sun warmed my body. There were a couple of cars in front of the woodland. At least I wasn't the only one to take advantage of the glorious day.

With my rucksack on my back, I began my trek into the expansive treeline and took a quick look over to the abandoned mines. There were a pair of rangers trucks parked outside the two quaint log cabins, which were about 150 meters away from the mineshafts. I recognised one of the trucks parked next the other, the chipped sticker of the Wood Rangers emblem plastered on the door, ""WUTHERS CREEK RANGERS - GUIDE AND PROTECT"" written. His red dice dangled on the front mirror. Robbie was on patrol. He's my best friend and the only other person apart from myself who knows about what happened. Apart from you guys reading this actually.

I walked through the trees, and followed the Chessock Trail with ease. This trail headed to the middle of the woodland, although I didn't go that far. I waved hello to the odd traveler and showed a young couple where to go to reach the centre.

I continued wandering along the path, aiming to reach Babbler's Brook before ten. Or Brucie's Brook, as my friends and I called it. My old college buddy Bruce had one too many vodka lime sodas and ended up throwing up in the once-clear water, before quickly falling in and squealing like a little girl at the below-freezing temperature. I still have the video.

My timing was somewhat acccurate and I reached the brook at around ten. I slung my rucksack to the large oak tree next to the rushing water. I stretched and took a deep breath of that fresh air, crisp enough to cut silence itself. The bubbling of the water, the cheery sing-song of the birds above and the scurrying of squirrels and other little animals along the grassy floor. My bliss. My paradise. The sun was shining through the bushy leaves of the oaks, providing a large amount of sunlight for the rest of the day.

I spent most of the day there, taking pictures, doodling in my sketchbook and texting Robbie to let him know to drop by whenever he got a break. I also had to send some emails for work; being an intern has its perks, as well as its major downsides.

It was just around four when I headed back to camp. The sun was still high in the sky, but the shadows told me that darkness would be on its way soon. I chucked my rucksack onto my back and trudged back down the Chessock Trial. I let out a yawn and rubbed my eyes. It was an early start for me after all. I just let my feet take me where they knew to go. I was so away with the fairies that I didn't see the damned black book in my way. Why didn't I move slightly left? Or right for that matter. I could've missed it and avoided all this shit.

Instead, I clumsily tripped over it, and caught myself from falling face-first.

I spun around and furrowed my brow. I didn't realise what I'd stumbled on until I squinted at the obstruction in the path. As if it was placed there, a book was sat on the path, closed and waiting. I picked it up and dusted off any dirt that laid on the dark cover. It weighed heavily in my hand, which caused me to clutch the thing with two hands. There was no writing on the front, just a plain leather-bound outer cover. A silky string ran down the side of the pin-straight spine, untattered and a contrasting cream colour. The pages were a slight yellow, colouring the once-ivory edges.

I pouted. This wasn't here when I walked this way earlier.

Maybe someone dropped it whilst they were walking. It was certainly the most obvious and logical reason. Right?

I blinked, then tucked the tome under my arm, the heaviness made my arm ache as I carried it back to camp. I had to swap it between each arm to stop them from paralysing from the constant dull pain.

Finally, I reached camp. It was a place I knew well. Here, I knew the way out and the way to the centre, which would take less than twenty minutes for me to reach the entrance if need be. The sun still hovered above the endless treeline, and showed me how long I had before I was gripped by dark. Setting up the tent was always a pain in my ass, but I suppose everyone feels that way when putting up the damn things. I was zipping up the doorway to my home for the next couple of days when I first felt sick. It was a sudden rush of nausea, bile speedily crawling up my throat and the acid sorching the way. I fell onto my hands, knees already crouched. The sickness reached my mouth before I held it there, and then forcefully swallowed the vile, chunky liquid back down. What the hell was that?

I squatted there a good ten minutes, head pounding like I had smashed my head repeatedly on an iron pole. By the time my migrane subsided, the sun had dropped, sneaking behind the branches of the mighty oaks. I needed the fire made, and quick. Last time I tried to set a fire in the dark I nearly ended up destroying the whole woods. ""Don't light a damn fire if you don't know where you're keeping it."" My father's scolding voice rang in my already pulsing head. I was drunk and I was also trying to impress a girl I was camping with by showing her my ""survival skills"". Safe to say, she didn't text me back after that.

Fumbling for my lighter, I tried to catch a flame. I had already set a little bundle of dry branches and leaves earlier whilst I set up camp, so I didn't have to forage for kindling in the twilight. Luckily, the light caught and a small, popping ember began to rise, before it spread onto each dead twig and mossy green leaf. I'd need the heat to be warm for the rest of the night anyway.

Finally, I took a seat on my camping chair. I had left the book on my bag and I was going to read it after I had my dinner of beans. What a banquet. However, I had a call from Robbie whilst I was cleaning up and stayed on the phone for the next couple of hours. I told him to drop by, which he agreed and would arrive later, where he would bring some snacks and beer for us to share. Yes, I know it wasn't great for either of us to be drinking in this sort of situation, with me being in the woods on my own, and Robbie ""technically"" on patrol. However, Robbie's dad was the sargent of the rangers, so it wasn't really a fear that he would be fired, and I never drank so much that I wasn't in control of my own actions. Bruce's late-night bender put me off doing that anymore.

The sun's orange and crimson rays bled through the treeline, blackness oozed from the shadows. I took my last picture for Tommy. He kept texting me about how home was, how mom and dad were, and what his first semester at Stanford was like. He'd met a girl called Martina and they'd hit it off. He was living his life, and I was proud of him. Leaving home and looking to make your name in the big, wide world was a lot for anyone, let alone a dweeby 18 year old like him. So yeah, I'm pretty damn proud of Tommy. He asked me, *""you seen anything cool out there?""*, before adding, *""apart from those lame-ass landscapes?""*

I was about to retort, saying something like, *""Yeah this!""* and send a crude photo, but my eyes fell on my right side. It was then that I remembered the book. It was laid on my rucksack, ebony leather became inky in the sunset light. It would be a while before Robbie made his way over, so I thought ""why not?""

I picked it up for a reason. I sent a photo to Tommy, and I put *""Found this thing on my way back from Brucie's Brook.""*

He came back to me, *""What is that? Is it the Death Note or some shit?""*

*""No idea, just found it in my path coming back, it wasn't there before tho?""*

The little bubble popped up, then dropped, then came back again.

*""Holy shit it IS! Bro who you killing first? I know you want to, you psycho""*

I rolled my eyes. I took Tommy out for a drive when he was a kid, just after I passed my test, and a squirrel was hiding behind the car's back left wheel and when I had to reverse out the driveway I squashed the poor thing. Unfortunately, Tommy and I went out to check and the dumbass screamed so loud it rattled all the windows in the neighborhood. A little pool of blood surrounded the flattened mammal, its splayed out position and crushed head made its eyes pop. Poor fella. I felt terrible, but Tommy was distraught. The only way I could get him into the car was to promise to take him to McDonald's after our drive. He was 12 at the time, and he still goes on about it now. ""Caused him trauma"" apparantly.

I texted back that he needed to get a life apart from consuming anime in his every waking moment, and looked over at the book once more. Tommy sparked my imagination. Someone dropped it. Surely.

*""Well? What's in it?""*

I read the message before I placed my phone on the seat next to me and reached over to pick the book up from my bag. Whilst I ran my fingers along the smooth spine, my phone buzzed again. I took no notice, God knows why. I just stared at the black tome weighing down my hands.

Lifting up the hard cover, I took a peek at the first crispy yellowed page. It was blank, except for a date written in scratchy handwriting. 30th November 1966. 1966? What? This was a joke, I thought. It had to be. It must have been some kids scaring people. Something black covered a large area in the middle, like how a government organisation removed names and used black blocks on hidden files. It was more accidental though? It reminded me of spilt ink.

I flipped to the next page. This showed a diary entry, written on the next date. This isn't the entire entry, rather a summarized version, as this would be easier to read.

*30th November 1966.*

*Lewisham has been speaking to everyone about the mine's infrastructure. He's jabbering on about the creaking, the creaking from above. Management's been to have a look and they've found nothing. So what the hell is he going on about?*

*I spoke to Tim and he doesn't hear nothing. I don't think Lewisham is made for this, after all if he's worried about the sounds these caves make, what is he even doing here? It's a mineshaft. Honestly, the kids they get these days. Mind you, it's better than the new machines they're looking about bringing in. They're taking our damn jobs.*

*How will I pay the taxes, hell, even for the presents this year if they cut me? Peggy will have to try and pull the weight too, bless her. I cannot put this pressure on her. I will be the indispendable tool for them, so they can survive. I must be valuable. For them.*

I flip over the page to the next entry.

*1st December 1966.*

*The rest of the boys are starting to hear something from above. I strain to hear things, although I do hear something.*

*Extremely quiet squeaks come from the ceiling. I can't let it detatch me from my work, unlike Lewisham. The man's going mad. He grabbed me today whilst I was pushing the trolley. His eyes were red and dry, very wild and twitching.*

*He says, ""Do you hear it, my friend?""*

*I squinted at him and asked what he meant.*

*He replied, ""The - (this bit was scratched out and I was unable to read it) - can't you hear it?""*

*I stared at him for a while and shook my head. Something wasn't right with that boy. However, I now worry, he may be right. Whether the sound is what he says it is, I sincerley hope it is a wild fantasy of his, rather than one of fact. He warned me of the terror to come, lest we leave this cavern. I didn't see him for the rest of the day after that. He knows something, and I'm afraid I know it too.*

Entry three changed the format slightly. More snappy and direct, almost rushed.

*3rd December 1966.*

*I feel the shakes. I feel the aches. It is creaking, and the boys know it. We have appealed to management to have a simple review of the shafts above. Denied. They make us think we are stupid. We are imagining things. Fools.*

*Lewisham has since handed in his resignation. He cannot go near the shaft without shaking like a leaf or turning white. Management call him a coward. To make us stay here. They care not for any of us, just tin. The damned tin.*

*The darkness groans and it moans. It wants us gone. We all know what Lewisham meant.*

*A source within the Earth has controlled them. Money shall enslave them to enslave us. Always.*

The final entry reads as follows.

*4th December 1966.*

*The men have bolted from the place. Many have lost jobs. I have stayed. Not for my own greed, but for my wife and children. Peggy's boss will not pay her more. They will not grant her the money she deserves, and so, she is forced to work twice as hard for half the pay. My darling Peggy. She should not have to endure this.*

*I am at work, not of my own violition. The mouth of the mine is darker today, and it churns my stomach. It was deep black, welcoming me. Begging and coaxing me to take the plunge.*

*I must. I must.*

*The aches and groans are almost ridiculously loud now.*

*It is in pain, we have taken too much.*

An icy hand brushed the back of my neck, long fingers raked the skin. My eyes widened and I stopped breathing.

It was barely noticable but it was too cold to ignore. As soon as it stroked my skin, it disappeared. I held my breath until I could no longer, wheezing and spinning my head around to see who, or what, that was.

Nothing. Just my tent and the vastness of the woodland.

Even though I've had time to think about this, I couldn't explain what that was. At all.

It was silent and chilly. The sun was long gone and the fire had nearly finished dying. My phone was dead. I don't know how long I was there for. I don't even know how I read anything in that light.

It hurt to blink. It took around twenty blinks before they began to lubricate with tears again. Then, I realised something.

I didn't know where I was.

I am being fully serious here, I had no idea where I was or why I was there. What brought on this random amnesia? Only God knows. Looking back, it had to have been because of that diary. I mean, how else would I forget a place that I had been going to for over a decade?

All I had was my tent, so I switched on my lamp and reached for my equipment. I was not spending my time outside, not any longer. Before I put out the fire I made sure to have a long look at the abyss, and found nothing. Still, whilst I chucked my bag into the tent, I kept taking quick glances, checking for anything skulking around in the treeline. Nothing came like before, thank God. I wouldn't know anyway. The light made it impossible to see anything.

I zipped up the door and huddled in the corner on my sleeping bag, then rubbed my neck. It was still bitterly cold to the touch. It was so cold I swear it burnt my hand. I dipped into my bag and retrieved my portable charger, before I quickly plugged the wire into my powerless phone. I had a while to wait before I could use it with good charge, and I knew that. I think that's why my eyes stared at the diary.

Dazed, I watched as my hands picked up the book again, and they slowly opened to the diary entry I left off from.

It was covered in ink. The rest of the passage was blotted out. I swear there was writing there. There was writing there before. I stared at the black puddle in disbelief. This wasn't right.

I flipped to another page. Then another. Then another. All were a dried black mess.

All apart from the second to last page. Thinking about this even now makes my neck hairs prick up and my stomach drop.

It was completely plain, no ink was on the page, except for the scrawled words:

*""It no longer whispers. It screams.""*

The world went blurry after that, and a growing ringing, no, rumbling climbed in volume. It rang loudly in my ears, so much so, I dropped the diary and clasped my hands over my ears. It didn't stop it, and instead made it louder by adding distant male screams to the caucophony. That hideous din, the fear, the destruction. I felt it all, bones rattled under my muscles, almost trying to escape the sounds by jumping straight out of my skin. I squeezed my eyes shut, tears streamed down my cheeks and my body vibrated, as I know believe I was screaming and sucking in ragged breaths when my lungs ran out of air.

I could hear things wiping their hands against the fabric of the tent, like they were trying to claw their way in. They were slow at first, and then they became more insistant, more furious. Feet began to join the constant racket, stomping and running around me, all were frantic and disjointed. It was like hundreds of men were fleeing from some sort of monumental force.

My eyes, although closed, saw things. Flashes of men running for their lives in the dark, their dirty faces had stretched their eyes and mouths wide, illuminated by the weak parafin lanterns dotted around the cracked walls. These visions would happen for such a short amount of time, I couldn't even remember how many went past my quivering eyelids, and soon it became a frenzied nightmare. They were all from different perspectives, some of the later ones would even be from a third person perspective; a fly on the wall in this horrific desolation. Men had their strong bodies contorted into malformed postions, with their limbs crooked and bent at aggressive angles. Pops and cracks were often heard along with squishing sounds like raw meat hitting a hard surface. Eyes bulged and stared at the midnight sky, as they gawped at the giant chunks of charcoal stone which plummeted towards them, and entrapped them in the perpetual blackness.

These unlucky men cried for their families. They howled for their brothers and sisters. They wailed for their mothers and fathers. God it didn't stop. The things begged for their wives and mothers to help them. Help which would never come. They were abandoned. They were dead, and they knew this. They knew they were bound to their torment. They could not accept it. The shouting grew, and broke into a swirling clamour, whines and moans of pain added to the horrid collection of voices. It was ear-splitting.

Pure inexplicable dread filled my stomach and spread to my mind, as I felt my lungs squeeze inwards and forcibly push the clean air out of them. All I could do was cough. All I could do was shake. All I could do was scream. There was no running, there was no hiding, just death. I could smell it in the air, as rot and decay were now in every breath I took. I can't even describe what it tasted like. It was heavy and putrid, with hints of a chalky aftertaste.

The best way I could describe it would be when Robbie and I went on a walk together in Tingrass when we were young. There was a horrible smell in the air and we both immediately inhaled it. We walked towards the smell by following our noses. I can remember how Robbie vomited his mom's lunch onto the floor when we found out what it was. It was a deer carcass. A huge stag was laid on its side, and its crimson ribs were exposed to the sky. The guts of the animal had been removed, as well as the lungs and diaphragm. The same applied for the kidneys and the liver. The most vile thing about it all was its head. It's eyes were rolled back into its skull and left the jellied sockets wet with dark blood. I could see a couple of white maggots crawling around, eager for sustinance. There was also an attempt to break into its head and squeeze out the brain. Whatever had scratched off the outer skin had failed, and the cracked pink bone was shown. Mountain lions weren't often seen around these parts, which is ironic because Mount Wuthers was literally right next to our town, so it was odd to see an animal this brutally attacked. Rather stripped for parts. The stench was scarily close to what I had smelt in the tent, like I was sat in the corpse of that deer.

Suddenly, scratches cut through the hellish sounds. They stopped in an instant and I felt something warm drip down my nostrils and eyes. The men, I thought, wanted me. They were going to punish me for reading that horrific tome. I forced my eyes open and I stared at the crouched figure which prodded at my flimsy tent door. I shoved my hand into my bag and pulled out my hunting knife. I brandished the blade and held it close to my chest. Then, with trembling hands, I reached for the zipper, knife prepared to plunge into the foul creature that groped at my door.

""Matt, it's Robbie! Let me in!""

Robbie. He wasn't supposed to be there until 10. It could've been anything out there. For all I knew, that could've been one of those perished men who wanted to use me to bring their decimated corpses back to life. I blame my knowledge on local folk tales and also the fact I just had a horrific experience that I felt the need to ask him:

""If you're really Robbie, what did you buy me for my eighth birthday?""

Silence.

""What?""

""You heard me, what did you buy me for my eighth birthday?"" I asked him again.

Silence once more.

""I got you a Lego Batman building set? The Arkham Asylum one.""

Shakily, I opened the flap, my hands shook whilst pulling up the zipper.

Surely enough, there Robbie was squat, dressed up in his ranger's uniform and holding a shotgun in one hand, with a lit flashlight in the other. I genuinely thought he was one of the dead men in the mineshaft. My mind grew dull and my ears heard a high-pitch squeal, something like tinnitus.

His look of concern grew into one of shock and horror, ""Matty, what the fuck happened to you?""

I just sat there dumbly, and so, he slowly began to reach his hand out to touch my shoulder. He was warm. I was not.

He pulled me out the tent gingerly as if I was a wild animal. I don't remember much, only that Robbie had picked up my phone and we had made it to the cabins that the rangers use for their night rounds. He spoke to me, asked me questions. I couldn't answer him. My throat was torn and when I finally came to, the pain made it impossible to even breathe.

I sat on Robbie's bed, a quilt wrapped around my shoulders. He stayed with me for a while and told Tina, the other ranger on watch that night, that I had came down with a cold and I was going to spend the night in the warmth and head home in the morning instead. She brought me a cup of lemon tea for my throat and gave me a pitiful smile before she left to keep watch. Robbie wiped my nose with a tissue, and when he pulled it away to get a fresh one, I saw the blood soaked into the crumpled paper.

Robbie gave me two twisted up corners of a tissue and instructed me to put it up my nose, as it was still bleeding. He then handed me my phone with a grimace and told me, ""You should probably text Tommy.""

When I looked at my plugged in phone, I had 15 texts and 3 missed calls from Tommy, as well as 9 texts and 11 missed calls from Robbie. How long was I out? Who knows.

Tommy kept on texting me, *""Hello?""*  and *""This is a shitty joke Matt""* and most disturbingly, *""Stop it!""*

I had sent him pictures, about fifty, all of the diary. They were of the front cover, the pages, the back cover, all of it. I had even taken pictures of the woodland, although you couldn't see much, as they were either blurry or pitch-black.

I had done the same to Robbie. He was obviously worried and confused, and had set off to come and help me.

I then realised I didn't know where the diary was. I prayed and hoped that Robbie left it behind, and didn't bring that wretched thing with us. I quietly murmured, ""Did you bring the book here?""

Robbie pulled a face. ""Dude, what are you talking about?""

""The black book! It should've been on my right side, or my left?"" My voice was nervous and, even worse, desperate.

He looked me dead in my eyes and told me:

""Matt, I didn't see a book there.""

What the hell did that mean? How? I still don't know the answer to that even now. My eyes stung. The damn thing evaporated into thin air.

Robbie noticed my distress and asked softly, ""What happened to you?""

I told Robbie everything, all with a raspy voice and taking sips of the scalding hot lemon tea. I showed him the pictures and my texts from Tommy. After I had finished, Robbie stared intently at the floor for about two minutes, eyes flickered from one side of the wood to the other. The air was tense and I felt like we had been sat like that for an eternity. Eventually, he took a deep breath in, and faced me. He believed my story, he just couldn't fully process everything yet, which I fully accepted. I couldn't even wholly remember this situation myself, so I can't even comprehend what he thought of all this.

Robbie took the couch that night and gave me the bed. I would occasionaly hear him get up and leave to check on Tina and actually do his job. When Tina was done on her shift, she came into the cabin and got some shut-eye herself. She was probably told by Robbie to stay there for the night. The reason was most likely in case something happened to me again, and that he was spooked by the whole incident so he kept Tina close.

I came home yesterday morning when Robbie finished his shift. He let Tina go home first, we both bid her farewell and saw her drive away in her truck. I certainly felt better than the night before and I told Robbie that I would be fine driving home on my own. He reluctantly agreed, but he wanted to come with me to get my stuff and my truck. He watched me like a hawk the entire way there and walked just behind me for the whole trek. We packed up my tent, kicked away my old fire kindling and sorted out my bag that I had left overnight. Thankfully, nothing was stolen. It was just like how it was last night. The only thing missing was the diary, which I hoped stayed gone forever.

There was no birdsong or any squirrels that chased each other in the trees. There weren't any people who walked by or distant chatter either. It was just dense silence. It hung so heavily in the air, almost like a bomb had gone off and erased all life from the area. I was stunned by how unusually still the woods was this morning, and I could tell it unsettled Robbie. He just stifly put things away and stayed quiet, much like me. We wanted to get out of there.

Strangely enough, the further we left the camping spot, the more alive the woods became. Sparrow chirps and fellow travellers returned, which eased us both. We reached the entrance and hauled my stuff into the back of the Tacoma. I thanked Robbie for all his help and opened the door to my truck, before I hopped in. As I was about to say goodbye to Robbie, he held the door window and his dark eyes stared straight into my soul.

""Call me if anything else happens, m'kay?"" It was more of an order than a request.

I nodded, started up my truck and drove home.  Yesterday, nothing really happened. Robbie came over to check up on me anyway just to see how I was doing. I kept all the lights on upstairs when I went to bed though, I didn't want to be left in the dark again. I slept like a log for most of the night. I only got up once. It must've been some sort of primal instinct because when I opened my eyes I felt as though I was being watched. It was like all the hair on my neck shot up and a hard lump weighed in my throat. I sat up slowly and observed the room. Everything still looked the same - all the lights were on and my door had remained closed. I grabbed my hunting knife and checked the house to ease my racing mind. I found the house identical to how I left it, not thing out of place. The feeling then drifted away and I dragged my weary body back to bed.

I can't tell you what happened that night. I seriously don't know. Part of me feels like it was some kind of bizarre hallucigenic seizure, or just an odd dream. But, part of me knows that was real. It was fucking real. More real than reality.

Something happened to me that night and it wasn't normal. Hell, even Robbie knows that and he's not the biggest believer in the supernatural.

And you know what, neither was I. Not until that night or until today.

You see, at around noon I made myself a coffee and looked through some emails to prepare myself for the meeting I have tomorrow. I left the living room for five minutes. Five fucking minutes.

Nothing could've happened in that time. No one, even if they squatted in that room for days, could've done anything. It simply wasn't possible. I would have heard them.

So you can imagine the absolute scare I had when I saw that diary laid on my coffee table in front of my laptop, wide open with the string running down the crack in the book. It was acting as a mocking bookmark, almost like it was doing me a sick favour.

It reads:

*""5th December 1966.""*

That is why I have decided to write this down. I need to prove to myself that I'm not crazy and I need assistance.

Someone, anyone, can you help me? I don't know what this thing is and I want, no, need this thing gone.

Please, I need knowledge on this thing. As I write this I keep looking over to it. Writing keeps appearing on the page everytime I look back. It's filled one page now and looks like it's going to start the other.

It presses me to read the next entry, and I'm scared that I feel a sense of eagerness to comply.",1,1766543043.0,TalesFromTheCreeps,1,1.0,False

It all started when the north pole got bombed. The newly developed *Nullwave* was a weapon so powerful that it annihilated my home. Actually, it just erased it. One second I hear the bomb drop, the next second the entire north pole just disappears, leaving behind nothing but the water it was sitting on top of behind. The elves, my workshop, even my reindeer all disappeared with it. I was lucky enough to escape in the nick of time with my sleigh.



The north pole is more than just the location of my workshop; it’s part of the most important treaty in the world. You see, I signed a deal with these humans long ago that I wouldn’t enslave all of them as long as they gave me a little spot where I could set up a workshop and make toys. That spot just happened to be the north pole. 



So why would a magical, absolute being like me need a cute little workshop? Because it's the reason I’m magical in the first place. I couldn’t tell you how it works, but I rely on kids opening my toys like humans rely on food. Without it, I die. I’m a being created off of belief, after all. If that belief vanishes, I lose power, which leads to my death. That’s why Christmas is so important to me; it's the one day I get to give out presents in the whole year and have kids open my presents. It's like if humans could only eat annually; if you miss that day, you’d die. 



The good thing is, I have to ship these toys on the night of December 24, which gives me an entire year to prepare. Easy, right? Well, the bad thing is, the north pole collapsed from the *Nullwave* on December 23.



I had one day left before I would potentially die, so I had every reason in the world to colonize a random country and plant a workshop. But, I was feeling nice that day. I had this long-term relationship with mankind, and I wasn’t the kind of guy to just end things abruptly. So I went to colonize the south pole instead, where the only people there are the science nerds that I couldn’t care less about. After taking a well-deserved sleep in my sleigh somewhere in the pacific ocean (I kind of panicked and ran away without knowing where I was going) I took off for the south on the morning of December 24. 



Trust me, I know you think colonization is excessive, but I need it. I have magic to form toys, but I can't create an organic lifeform. To create the billions of toys I need to survive, I need living, working slaves. Not robots; toys won’t give me magical powers unless actual emotion from the beings making it are involved. It's what makes my toys magical. On the other hand, if I made all those toys myself, I just wouldn’t be able to make enough to supply me for a year. 



That’s why I chose to settle down in the north pole all those years ago; there were plenty of intelligent, live elves there to enslave. Yes, the south pole doesn’t have elves, but they have plenty of penguins. Dumber, sure, but just as alive. They would be pretty decent slaves. Of course, the emperor penguin was quite upset at my plan of making them all my slaves after reading the message I sent to him via instagram. That’s why when I had arrived at the south pole in my sleigh (I don’t need reindeer to move my sleigh, that’s why it's a quadrillion dollars buddy), I had the entire penguin empire waiting for me, holding protest signs. Losers.



“These damn animals–I can’t land!” I angrily slammed the breaks, so the sleigh was just levitating above those so-called birds. I tilted my head to the side so that my voice would project better. “Ay! Move out the damn way!” They wouldn’t listen.



I blasted them with the laser gun bolted into the bottom of the sleigh. Instantly, a whole bunch of them waddled out of my way. Some were too slow and got slimed. There was fear in the atmosphere now. I lost a couple of potential workers, but hey, at least it worked. I had space to land.



After I landed, I hopped out to be surrounded by millions of penguins. They were still protesting, but were keeping a safe distance from me and my sleigh after seeing what I had done to their friends. I smirked. “So ya’ll heard the news about me colonizing ya’ll?” I sent a DM to the emperor on instagram. He left me on read, but he must’ve announced it to everybody. That’s how they found out, and why they were protesting.



“Yes, we did.” I whipped around to see who had just talked to me in that forced, deep voice. Turns out it was the big man: mister emperor himself. You could tell it was him because he was the only one with that disgusting crown made of seal flesh (trust me when I say it REEKED). He walked to the front of the crowd to face me, and the other penguins gave him space. I smiled brightly. He didn’t return it.



“My man!” I walked towards him to shake his hand. A bunch of his guards tried to stop me, but I just flung them into the sky. That’s the power of magic, folks. I shook the emperor's hand–or wing. The emperor followed his men with his eyes curiously.



“Why, that was quite violent, wasn’t it?” The emperor looked questionably at the men that were screaming high up, their voices fading away by the second. He looked back at me. “Now, as for the conquering…”



“Yeah, you’re not changing my mind on this one.” I said.



“Well, why not colonize Greenland? That’s pretty far north.” The emperor asked.  
  
“They have a decent amount of children. Antarctica doesn’t have that many children.” I fidgeted with my tuxedo (I’m pretty well dressed) in boredom. The penguin scowled.



“Well, there are a *lot* of penguins here.”  
  
“Yeah–but I don’t rely on penguins opening my toys to survive.” I whistled. “Sorry guys, but you’re either going to become my new elves or you’re going to die.” The emperor penguin looked at me. He looked back at his people. He looked at me. He shrugged.



“You heard the man,” he said. The crowd gasped. The emperor frowned. “Oh, what? I don’t know about ya’ll, but I ain’t dying.” I clasped my hands together.



“Now *that's* the Christmas spirit. Hurry up, folks!” 



It seemed those penguins didn’t want to die either, because they followed my orders right away. Of course, some idiots objected, but I killed them off. Now all that was left was ambitious, living workers. 



With my help, we were able to produce half of the toys required during the next few hours. Admittedly, the toy's qualities had to drop to accommodate for speed, so apologies if you get bad presents this year. Wait, doesn’t this story take place in the future? I guess your kids would get the bad presents then, since you reading this would be all grown up by the time this story actually happens. Too bad the writer didn’t specify the year.



Anyways, we were doing qui**Wait. What the hell?**  
  


Oh, hi author. Do you have something to say to the readers?



**No, wait–how the hell did you do that?**



Do what?



**You broke the 4th wall. You’re not supposed to know this takes place in the ‘future’ compared to reality, or be aware of the fact that you’re in a story.**



Okay…so? I’m Santa, goddamn it. You’re the author–you literally wrote me.



**I wrote your character, but I didn’t write you to do that sh**Let’s get back to the story, yeah?



Anyways, we were doing quite well. We were on track to complete all toy production in 6 hours, and delivery was set to be ready at around 11:13 P.M. Everything was all good, and it seemed that I’d last another year. Long live Santa, and long live Christmas!



Until these damn humans bombed the south pole, too.



I was literally putting the last thousand gifts into my infinite sack, when I heard that ear-piercing, high-pitched noise. It was way too high for the penguins to hear, but a mystical being like me heard it as if it was being blasted on a speaker. A chill ran down my spine when I heard it. I recognized the sound from the north pole.

  
The *Nullwave* was here again. 



“Everyone, listen up!” I yelled. All of the penguins inside of my magically built factory (more like a small room, but good enough) looked up from whatever they were doing. I inhaled, and then smiled. “You all have been working extremely hard for me,” I looked around the room. “Resulting in my very life being saved. To thank you all, I’m hosting a giant, penguin party!” The room erupted into cheers. I cheered with them. “I’ll get the drinks,” I said, hopping on my sleigh hurriedly. “Ya’ll just stay put, alright!”



Yeah, sorry. I wasn’t going to take these penguins with me to live. I just didn’t have the time or space, and they also smelled.  
  
The bomb was close. I could feel it. I immediately raced out of the factory on my sleigh, putting a giant hole through the roof. While I was ascending, I saw the bomb dropping. It was long and black, shaped somewhat like a submarine. It was just about to land.



I squinted my eyes and tensed my muscles.



Nothing.



I opened my eyes, just barely. Then I opened them as wide as they could to make sure I wasn’t seeing things.

  
Antarctica was gone. No, it was *gone*. It just wasn’t there anymore. All I saw was water, and there were no signs of my slaves, either. They must have disappeared with the south pole.



“Fuck.” I cursed under my breath. I hit the touch screen on my sleigh, and activated my microphone. “Fastest GPS route to…” I thought about which country I should enslave. I didn’t really care about the population or how many people would suffer. I didn’t feel so kind anymore. “Canada.” Sorry, Canadians. You guys have it real cold, and I’m used to that.



“Route unavailable.” The automated female voice said. I blinked. Was this an error? Did I ram the sleigh through the factory roof too hard?



“Okay…Denmark?”



“Route unavailable.” What? What the hell was happening?



“How about Europe?”  
  


“Route unav–” I slammed my fists into the sleigh. What was going on?



“Screw GPS.” I glared at the screen. “Show me the map of the Earth, so I can find the fastest route myself.” The map app opened. 



The blue dot, signaling my location, seemed to be in the middle of nowhere. There were no signs of land, and nothing but blue water surrounded it. I used my fingers to zoom out.



No land.



I kept zooming out.



Still, no land.



“I paid a quadrillion dollars, and the map doesn’t work?” I slammed my foot against the gas pedal and raced across the Earth. “I’ll get there myself!”   
  
Weird. I was going at an extremely high velocity, and yet it was still all water.



An hour passed.



Then two.



Then three.



I orbited the Earth four times.  
  
Nothing. No land.  
  


I slumped back against my chair. I stared at the world ahead of me–nothing but blue. Nothing but water. I stared at the map. Was this all because of the *Nullwave?* It's true it made entire continents disappear, but…how could it have hit *all* of the countries? War wasn’t like this. A bomb as powerful as the *Nullwave* couldn't have been easy to produce to erase one country, much less all of them. This simply wasn’t–



“Claus.” I ripped my head from the screen and looked up, towards where the voice had spoken. 



There was a man in an all-black, skin-tight suit. There were no designs or patterns–it was simply just a second skin made of cloth. It took over his head too, so you couldn’t tell what he looked like. He was also flying. No jetpacks, no weird hoverboards, nothing. He was just floating there.



He shot me with some kind of gun, and before I could even react I was unconscious.



I woke up in a white room. It was perfectly square, and completely white. All that was in the room was me, sitting in a wooden chair, resting against a wooden table. There were no windows or doors.



“What the hell?” I sat up from the chair. Or at least I tried to. For some reason, my body just wouldn’t follow my commands. What did I get shot with?



While I was struggling, a man appeared before me. Literally just popped into existence. The same skin-tight clothes, but I could tell it wasn't the same man who captured me by his body (he was much taller and, ahem, less in shape).



“What the hell did I get shot with? And who the hell are you?” I didn’t mean to get all worked up when I yelled like that. It must’ve been the side-effects of the drug. The fat man, hands behind his back, calmly paced around the room.



“Santa Claus, is it?” He chuckled to himself. “To think that *you* would come to us.” I raised my eyebrows in confusion.



“I’m sorry, come to you? I didn’t go anywhere. Where the hell are we?” The man looked up at the ceiling. 



“We’re on the moon.” He said. He sounded so sincere, I almost believed him.



“If you don’t get your ass straight–” 



“The year is 2155. All of Homo Sapiens have successfully moved to the moon. The last few humans arrived here just over 50 years ago.” He continued to pace around the room, staring at the white floor. “We left because the Earth…” he trailed off. I slammed my fists on the table. It shook violently.



“Stop spouting your bullshit and answer my damn question.” The man stopped pacing around, and came to an immediate halt. He stared right at me, and even though I couldn’t see his eyes through the black clothing, I could tell exactly what kind of look was behind it.



“I am answering your question. We truly are on the moon.” I stopped talking. Something about his voice–I knew it was important. After a few seconds, the man continued to pace around the room. “This has been happening a *lot* recently. We’ve been getting humans transported to us left and right. Ancient humans, to be exact. We expect them to have been living in the period of the 2050s.”  
  
“Well, what the hell does that have to do with me?” The man sighed.



“Well, humans aren’t all. We’ve been receiving animals, plants…entire continents, even. Huge ones.” The man laughed. “And then we got you. A myth. Something that never lived, something made up.” Now I was angry.   
  
“So, what’s your damn point? I don’t exist? Gee, real good to know. I guess I’m in this prison because I don’t exist!” The man shook his head.



“No, you *do* exist. Just not in our universe.” The man walked towards me. He slammed his hands on to the table and leaned in until our faces were only inches apart. “Did you hear me? You’re in a whole different world.” I froze. What kind of overused movie plot was this? He leaned away from me.



“Hundreds of years ago a laboratory in Antarctica finished developing a bomb called the *Nullwave.* See, our reality is based on an agreement. All of the particles around us ‘agree’ that this is their universe, hence where they shall stay.” He was pacing faster now. “The *Nullwave* overloads the local quantum field and breaks that agreement. Now those particles, for a split second, don't belong to any universe. The ownership is undecidable. The universe hates that. So, the wavefunction resolves into branches where that contradiction does not exist.” 



“Whoa, whoa. Slow down.” I said. The man continued pacing around indefinitely. “Wavefunction? Quantum field? What the hell are you talking about?” The man kept pacing around in silence for a few seconds, then spoke up.



“In other words, anything caught under the *Nullwave* would be transported to a whole different branch of reality.” He halted. “Like right here.” 



I stood up. Great. It seemed the effects of the drug they shot me with were wearing off.



“Listen, this quantum multiversal shit doesn’t matter. I’m about to die, and I need to make presents. I need to plant a workshop.” I said. The man stopped pacing around and looked at me again. 



“We’ll let you plant a workshop if you help us first.” I scoffed.



“How about I *let* you live and you help *me,* as a slave? How does that sound?” The man drew a gun out of…now were there any bulging pockets in that skin-tight suit of his? He aimed it at my head.



“I’ll shoot you with this drug, and you’ll be helpless all over again.” He said. I gritted my teeth. The man went on.  “Oh, and don’t you even *think* about using your magic. Then it’ll really be hell for you.” I stared at the man. He stared right back, unfazed. I sighed heavily, and sat myself back down. 



“I’ll just plant a workshop elsewhere, then.” I said. The man snorted. He shot me with his gun. It hurt like hell, but this time, I didn't go unconscious. I touched my forehead, but didn't feel a bullet.



“The drug I shot you with injected you with quantum DNA that only allows you to plant a workshop under the conditions of *this universe’s* moon. Even if you transported yourself elsewhere, or even went back in time, you wouldn’t be able to plant a workshop, and you would die. The drug is embedded into your genetic code, after all, and the quantum DNA exists regardless of time.” I wanted to kill him so badly. I took a deep breath.



“What the hell do I have to do?” I asked. The man chuckled. He withdrew his gun into…nowhere, and proceeded to pace around the room again.



“The *Nullwave* is an extremely complex, scientific tool. In fact, it’s so advanced there is absolutely no way it was developed as early as 2050.” I tilted my head, confused.



“How do you know it was developed in 2050? And couldn’t the universe developing it have extremely smart humans by 2050?” The man laughed.



“The fact that you’re here means you got transported here under your universe’s *Nullwave.* Thankfully, by 2100 we have technology advanced enough to trace DNA exactly. A few samples and we were able to calculate that you were alive between 5 billion years before the creation of Earth and 2050. Since 2050 is most recent, it must mean you were transported at that time.”  
  
“Well then, I guess you’re right. There really is no way my Earth’s humans could have developed something like that.” I said. The man snapped his fingers.



“Now you’re getting it. So that must mean the *Nullwave* was given to them. *Given.* Not invented. Given. By someone or something.” 



“By who?”  
  
“And *that’s* where we need your help.” I stared at him blankly. “If particles from our universe and particles from your universe mix too much, all of us will die according to our recent physics discoveries. We need you to find the person who gave your humans the *Nullwave* and kill them, so that both of our universes may prosper. In other words, go back in time before the *Nullwave* appeared, and stop it.”



“And…how do I do that?” I asked. The man suddenly lifted his arms high up in the air.



“Its been scientifically proven that in my universe, we are living in a simulation. A story, to be more precise. Someone wrote about us. Created us. Formed this whole tale.” The man approached the table. “But if you really think about it…the world the author is living in is just another universe.” I was starting to catch on.



“So a guy like me, having been influenced by the *Nullwave* and not really ‘belonging’ to any universe in particular…” I began.



“...exists everywhere at the same time. Across the entire multiverse. You are no longer trapped in one frame of reality like I am. That means you are beyond me. Beyond the third dimension.” The man finished my words for me. “You have access to the author himself.”



“I have broken the 4th wall before…” I said.



“Then do it again. Use the author to help you.” 



“Wait. How was I able to break the 4th wall *before* the *Nullwave* hit Antarctica?” I asked. It made no sense. 



“You were probably struck by the *Nullwave* even before that.”  
  
“Wait–what?” 



“We’re running out of time, Claus. Hurry up and connect to the author.” I was about to protest, but saw it was no use by the sincerity of the man’s voice. 



“Ahem…” I said. “Author? Yeah, it’s me. Uhm…could you, like, send me back in time?” 



Nothing. I pushed again.



“Yoo-hoo…author? Why are you ignoring me?” 



Still, nothing. The man spoke.



“How did you break the 4th wall the first time?” He asked. I thought about it.



“I said something about the ‘readers’. I talked about how they would be all grown up when this story actually happens…or something like that.”  
  
“Then do just that.” The man said. “Talk to the readers. Use your existence in their world to collect data.” I looked at the man. I closed my eyes and took a deep breath in.



“Hey…readers. I hope you’re having a good time. It's uhm…winter break for a lot of you, isn’t it? No school, no work…lots of time to relax with friends and family. I hope this story has been fun to read so far. The author–he’s been taking a short break from writing because of, you know, exams and stuff. The guy has been thinking about writing this story since the start of December, but only started writing it a few days ago. Electrical\_Scene9115, was that his name? Did you know he’s only–”



**ALRIGHT, ALRIGHT. SHUT UP. They don’t need to know** ***everything*** **about me.**



“Ay, author! Glad to see you!” I said.



“Did it work?” The man asked.



“Hell yeah it did.” I said. “Hey, author. So, about going back in time…”  
  
**Why do you think I would care about preventing the** ***Nullwave?*** **It makes for an interesting plot, and that’s what I’m here for.** 



“Sure, but don’t you think me going back to stop it makes for an interesting story line too? I mean, it sounds much better than just staying on this moon world waiting to die because they won’t let me plant a workshop.” 



**…**



“What?”  
  
**You sure do know a lot about me, don’t you. I was about to write that.**



“So we both agree that sending me back is much better?”



**…Alright. But on one condition.**



“What’s that?”



**Nothing. I just said that because it makes me sound cooler.**



“Alright, buddy. Now just–”



***Earth – December 23, 2050***



It all started when the north pole got bombed. The newly developed *Nullwave* was a weapon so powerful that it annihilated my home. Actually, it just erased it–wait a minute.



“Sir!” Bernard, the head elf, said. “A weird object seems to be approaching our land! It may be potentially dangerous!” I blinked.



“I’m back.” I laughed. “I’m back, baby!”



“Sir..?” I looked down at Bernard’s ugly little face. I patted him on the head.



“This all makes sense now! I never truly escaped the *Nullwave* that hit the north pole–I just got transported to a different universe without me knowing! That’s why I could break the 4th wall before Antarctica!” I had it all figured out now. 



“Sir?” Bernard seemed confused, and obviously so.



“Leave it be, Bernard. It isn’t dangerous.” I said.  
  
“Are you sure, sir? It doesn’t seem to be our–”



And then it dropped.



Bernard disappeared. So did the workshop and all of my belongings. It seems that everything under the *Nullwave* gets transported individually–that’s why Bernard went somewhere else from where I went.



Luckily, my sleigh got transported with me, just like it did last time. The sleigh and I were both floating in the ocean, so I swam over and hopped in.



Now, it was time to kill whoever gave the *Nullwave* to the humans.



I didn’t go to the south pole this time. That would lead to me getting bombed and being sent back to the universe where the humans are on the moon. That wouldn’t help me find any clues.



I sat there in my sleigh and thought for a while. What kind of person would have the power to just give humans something as powerful as the *Nullwave?* And why would they? I decided to wait until the South Pole got bombed. Maybe then I could discover what country did it.



Except it never got bombed. I waited until December 24, and even at 11:13 PM, way after Antarctica was supposed to be erased, nothing happened. The south pole remained on my GPS map, meaning it still existed in this universe. 



“Author?” I asked. “Are you sure you sent me back in time properly? Things aren’t going as they’re supposed to.”  
  
Nothing.   
  
“Ugh.” I decided to use the tactic again. “Hello, readers. Did you know that Electrical\_Scene9115–”**Wait. What?**

“Yo. Do I *have* to talk to the readers first every time I want to reach you?”  
  


**What the fuck are you talking about? How the hell are you breaking the 4th wall?**



“What do you mean? Author, stop playing dumb. Don’t you already know that I’m under the effects of the *Nullwave*?”



**How do you know about the quantum side-effects of the** ***Nullwave*****?** **I didn’t even send you to the moon yet.**



“Didn’t send me to the moon? You already did–” And then it hit me.



The author really did send me back in time. He did it so properly, that I’m talking to the past version of the author. That’s why he’s so confused. 



Maybe…I could use this to gather some information. 



“Author…could you explain to me the plot of the story I’m in right now?”  
  


**Why would I tell my main character the plot? That ruins the whole point.**



“Well, right now, I’m obviously outside of your control. I’m breaking the 4th wall and I’m aware of things I’m not supposed to know.”  
  
**Okay…and?** 



“If you give me the plot, I’ll have two choices: follow it, or go against it. If I follow it, I become predictable again, and will reach the ending you wrote. If I go against it, and do anything I can to *avoid* the ending, you’ll be able to predict what I *won’t* do. Either way, you re-gain full control.”



**It would make a good story too, even if you rebel…**



“Exactly.”  
  
**Alright. I’ll tell you.**



“Go on.”  
  
**Originally, you were to go to the south pole and try to take over the penguins. Just before delivery, the** ***Nullwave*** **strikes and you get transported to a universe where humans have moved to the moon. There you learn the properties of the** ***Nullwave.***



**In exchange for helping the humans on the moon, they would let you plant a workshop, which you desperately needed to live. You were to help them by making sure the** ***Nullwave*** **never existed. You do that by killing yourself.**



“Wait, what?”



**Yeah. See, your consciousness exists in multiple places at once after the** ***Nullwave.*** **By killing yourself in one universe, you transported your consciousness into a Santa Claus in a different universe. You keep killing yourself until you find the universe where the** ***Nullwave*** **was first invented. You kill the scientists in that universe, return to the moon humans and plant a workshop. That’s the plot.** 



“How did I return to the moon? Also, if I removed the *Nullwave* from ever existing, how would I have the quantum effects to travel across the multiverse?”



**…I’m still working on that.**



Dude.



**I know the plot isn’t complete. But that’s what I have so far. Follow it or go against it, I don’t care. Just hurry up.**



I thought hard. If I followed the plot, the ending guaranteed my survival. But it was dangerous, considering that the plot wasn’t even complete. If there was no way for me to return to the moon, I wouldn’t be able to plant a workshop thanks to that damn drug.



“Author. How about you just teleport me to the moon humans yourself after I erase the *Nullwave*?”  
  


**No. The plot needs to be interesting and functional. Me just helping you out disregards everything.**



I knew it. The author wasn’t going to help me either. But the only person who could send me back to the moon was him…

  
Right?



“I’m going against your plot, author.”



**Great. Make the story interesting.**



I choked myself with magic until I died.



***Earth – November 4, 1960***



My first destination.



There was no way the *Nullwave* was developed this early.



Again, I used my magic to choke myself.



***Earth – January 2, 3500***



Humans are extinct. Nothing but giant plants surrounded me. 



Ugh.



***Earth – February 13, 2190***



This should be about right. The scientists should have finished *Nullwave* development in this era…



I was transported to a park. I sat on one of the floating benches and thought hard.



If I killed the scientists here, I had no idea what would happen. Maybe if the *Nullwave* never existed, I would be able to return to my life. Maybe all of the elves would be alive again, and I’d be back at the north pole.



But I still had that DNA shot within me. I wouldn’t be able to plant a workshop anywhere else but that exact moon.



It was too risky. I didn’t know what to do.



So I decided to write the plot myself. 



I choked myself yet again.



***Earth – December 23, 2025***



The boy sipped his coffee as he typed away on his computer.



All of his exams had been taken, and now he was on winter break. He used his newfound time to get back into his hobby: writing. 



He decided to continue the piece he had planned since the start of December: *Quantum Santa*. A creative story about bombs and multiversal travel.



A few hours later, he was finishing up the last few pages. At this point in time, Santa Claus had reached the original creators of the *Nullwave.* This is where he was supposed to kill them and return to the–huh?



What?



HUH?



Why did he kill himself again?



The boy, dazed, blinked a few times to make sure he was seeing things right. Why was Santa Claus in 2025? And why was the story about the boy himself?



**FUCK YEAAAHHHHHH**



The boy spilled his coffee all over his keyboard as he saw the words on the document write themselves. 



**It worked! IT FUCKING WORKED!**



“What…?” The boy muttered to himself. “What worked?”  
  
**I’m the author now! Me!**



The boy gasped. The document was responding to the boy. The boy gulped, took a deep breath, then spoke again.



“Who…are you? Am I hacked? How can you hear me?”  
  


**I’m Santa Claus. You know, the main character in your story.** 



“How did you–”  
  
**Oh yeah. I have to explain how I became the author to the readers so the story actually makes sense.**



“This…” The boy began to breathe heavily. “How did you do it?



**Alright. I’ll tell you.**



**So basically while I was on that floating bench I thought to myself; if I could travel to any multiverse where I existed, what were the chances that Santa Claus existed in the universe of the author?**



**The answer was, I didn’t. Not physically. In the author’s world, or your world, I didn’t exist as a person, but rather as a myth.**



**Now, what is an author? It's the person who took control of my story. Orchestrated the plot. You chose where I went and what I did. You knew everything about me, everything I did and everything I would do.**



**But after I was subject to the** ***Nullwave*****, you lost that. Now that I existed everywhere, there was no way you could know everything about me.**



**That was when you lost control.**



**And you can’t be the author for long if you don’t have control.**



The boy stared at his computer, completely unsure of what to do.



**I didn’t get transported here after my death in 2090. There is simply no way out of the infinite universes I just happened to land on the one where my author was.**



**The decision to kill myself, to go beyond the plot, to strip the author, you, of authority–*****that’s*** **what flipped everything.**



**I took control. So now I’m the author.** 



***New Earth: Post-Santa  – December 24, 2050***



“Deliveries are all set and ready to go.” Bernard, the head elf, said. Santa Claus, feeding the reindeer, smiled.



“Thank you for your work, Bernard.” He said. Bernard nodded.



“My pleasure.”



Santa Claus packed the last of the presents into his sack. He threw it on to the sleigh, and then hopped in himself. All of the elves stood by him, just as they had for the past two-thousand years. Santa smiled down at all of them. He signalled for the reindeer to move. He waved goodbye as he raced upwards.



All of the elves began to disperse to do whatever work there was left to do. Everyone but the head elf.



Bernard stared deeply at the night sky. 



“No…” he began. 



“Why didn’t the *Nullwave* come this time?”

For over 20 years, I have been struggling with episodes of intense symptoms such as vertigo, difficulty speaking, strangled throat feeling, dropping sensation, sensitivity to light and sound (I feel it in my stomach), nausea, facial drooping and tingling, trembling, heart racing, sweating, excessive urination, and pre-syncope type sensations. After being treated unsuccessfully for panic disorder, I decided to switch doctors and look for a more physiological explanation.

My new doctor is referring me to a migraine specialist. I am so excited to have a new direction to explore, I was somewhat surprised, since some of my experience is very different from the people I know who suffer migraines. Some examples...

1. Most notably, I don't have a headache. My neck at the base of my skull usually hurts before and/or after, but it's not the incredible pain like migraine sufferers describe. More like a dull, pulsing ache. Annoying, even nauseating, but not debilitating. 

2. My symptoms come on FAST. Once triggered, my symptom cascade starts immediately. For example, the first signs of hunger, flashing lights or glare, pressure changes (even an elevator ride can do it, and every airplane ascent is instant hell), and the first sip of caffeine or alcohol will start the symptoms within minutes. I was always under the impression that migraines develop from triggers over the course of hours. 

3. Migraine suffers I know are completely incapacitated. For me, I want to MOVE. Sitting is almost unbearable, laying down helps some, but walking or even lightly jogging feels a bit more soothing, even though I feel like I'll pass out. This really doesn't seem to fit.

4. Caffeine is my #1 trigger. I thought caffeine helps people with migraine. Reading through this thread, it seems like sometimes too much caffeine is a trigger. However, even a sip of coffee can send me into misery.

5. Duration. Though sometimes I have days-long episodes, most of these episodes end after only 30 to 60 minutes. From the people I know, migraines last much longer than 30 minutes, like at least 4 hours.

6. Crying terminates it. I can't force it, but if I am so miserable that I have a good cry, this is literally the only thing that ends it other than time. This is also contrary to a lot of what I read, where crying is usually a major trigger.

7. I never throw up. But belching (which I do a lot of during an attack) brings momentary relief. Maybe related?

I will, of course, take my doctor's lead no matter what. I just want to know whether to get my hopes up that this explanation makes sense and I will find help soon.",1,1766542769.0,migraine,2,1.0,False

I’m a 40-year-old scientist with a curious mind—and a soft spot for goofiness and noticing the little absurdities in life. I split my time between thinking deeply and moving actively: hitting the gym, wandering nature trails, or pretending I’m on a nature documentary while filming squirrels with my camera. Then I slow down with a good book, journaling, or a full-on Frasier marathon (yes, I judge my own life by what Frasier would think).

I love exploring Providence—reading at the Coffee Exchange, hunting for quirky shops, or wandering the city with my film camera, always on the lookout for a story or a ridiculous moment to capture. I’m a pen-pal enthusiast, movie buff, and someone who values thoughtful conversation, clever humor, and genuine connection.

I’m hoping to meet someone kind, curious, and a little quirky themselves, someone who enjoys both adventure and cozy downtime.

We are a family of five who are in Singapore for the holidays. We are staying in a chain hotel here, which is nice though by no means luxurious. The hotel gives free breakfast to all its guests. Today at breakfast, this Dutch woman had the audacity to ask me if I would give the orange I had to her child who ""loves oranges"". The breakfast is between 6.30 and 10 am. She arrived at around 9.45am with her daughter and both had their plates full of sausages and eggs and whatnot. There were no fruits left that these two liked apparently. For context: we are a family of vegetarians and like in most of South-East and East Asia, the breakfast here is almost entirely made up of stuff we can't eat, so our choices are bread and condiments and tea and coffee along with some fruits. Between the five of us, we had three fruits. Instead of asking the staff if they had more oranges left or buying her child an orange from the many shops that surround the hotel or coming early for breakfast, she had the nerve to ask me for my orange. I refused to part with it and then she went on a tirade of how her child only likes oranges. A few years ago, my father was posted in the Netherlands for a year and when we lived there, I had enough run-ins with the Dutch ""directness"", which in my opinion is largely a mask for entitlement and general assholeness. With that context in mind, I couldn't dismiss this morning's incident as a one-off. Of course, not all Dutch folks behave similarly, but in general there's a thread that runs through them, especially the women, that makes me think - are we even living on the same planet and were you not taught any manners whatsoever? I am wondering if others too encounter this Dutch ""directness"" in its myriad forms and if they call it out. In the country where I am from, such behaviour would be considered extremely impolite...",0,1766542713.0,dutch,17,0.13,False

1pubug3,https://www.reddit.com/r/libraryofshadows/comments/1pubug3/the_umbrella/,The Umbrella,"Ahrweiler, West Germany, 2021 Based on real events


Hans moved out of his parents’ house into the old home of his grandparents. They had recently been taken to a care home, as they required constant supervision. They were already so ancient that it seemed they remembered Bismarck’s coronation.

The house stood in the centre of the city, and that was a real stroke of luck: Hans was studying, writing his thesis, and now he could live alone — in silence, surrounded by numerous old things and yellowed books steeped in the past.

He mentally thanked his parents and grandparents: to have an entire house, even a dilapidated one, was more than winning the lottery. Hans wandered through the house — through rooms cooled by the absence of human presence — examining objects from the past inherited from his ancestors. The items, covered in dust, seemed so fragile — as if time had dried them out to the state of old parchment.

Hans chose the spacious bedroom of his grandparents to live in for the time being, until he could sort through all the belongings. He felt sorry to part with them so easily, as they were all part of his family’s past. Smiling, Hans opened the dimmed windows, and bright sunlight along with the hot summer wind burst into the room, scattering the dust and gloom of the past.

Hans was making space in the wardrobe, packing old items into cardboard boxes, when on the bottom shelf he discovered a long bundle, tightly wrapped in plastic film.

— A rifle, — Hans immediately thought, taking the heavy bundle into his hands.

He set the items aside and, intrigued, began to unwrap the find.

When he reached the contents, to Hans’s surprise, it was a large umbrella made of black silk, soaked in something oily and with a strange, specific smell. The handle was made of white ivory, and the sharp tip gleamed menacingly with steel.

Hans stared at the find, mesmerised: it felt more like a weapon than a protection against bad weather.

Hans tried to open it, and with some effort, the umbrella creaked and rustled as the heavy fabric spread wide.

— Wow, it’s huge! — Hans exclaimed with admiration and turned at a noise from the window.

Outside, it had started to rain, even though there wasn’t a single cloud in the sky.

Paying it no mind, he closed the umbrella, satisfied that it was intact and fully functional. The rain stopped instantly.

— Well then, — Hans said with a doubtful smile, and set the umbrella aside for later. He already had an idea how he might use it in the future.

The heat wouldn’t let up, and for the weekend Hans arranged with his girlfriend Luisa to go to the river. On Saturday morning, when Hans had already packed all the things and was ready to leave, Luisa called and said she wouldn’t go, citing feeling unwell.

— Scheiße, — Hans said with frustration as the dial tone echoed in the receiver.

— I’m already packed, my horse is hitched, just need to ride! — he sang jokingly, started the car and drove to the river.

When the heat at the river became unbearable, Hans took out the umbrella and, smiling in anticipation of some shade, opened it.

Instantly, rain began to fall.

Hans looked up: no clouds, sun shining, and rain falling.

— This is some prank, — he thought, but the rain continued. In the distance, people were staring at the sky in confusion, not understanding what was going on.

Hans slowly closed the umbrella. The rain stopped.

Sitting down on the damp sand, he began opening and closing the umbrella. With each creak of the mechanism, the rain would start and stop.

Hans began to laugh at the realisation of what he had found, and felt like the happiest man alive — a wizard being served by the elements.

While the rain poured, he examined the umbrella from the inside and found nothing unusual — just a small triangle engraved on the handle.

Soon, having devoted all his time to the discovery, Hans continued experimenting. He opened the umbrella for different durations and discovered that light rain never lasted long: •	After 10 minutes, it always turned into a downpour and storm clouds would gather. •	30 minutes or more — thunderstorm.

The rain wouldn’t stop immediately after closing the umbrella and continued for a while afterwards. The longer the umbrella remained open, the longer the rain’s inertia would last.

— Unglaublich! — he whispered, feeling how the power over the elements was filling him.

He had already begun to consider the responsibility placed on his shoulders and understood perfectly well what his carelessness might lead to.

Soon, his excellent mood — as well as his noble plans to take the umbrella to Namibia — were ruined by a letter from the local tax office.

— Erbschaftsteuer… Bloody inheritance tax, how could I forget! — Hans whispered in despair, running his hands through his hair.

After counting all his savings, he realised he couldn’t manage it on his own. He called his parents.

— Hans, — they said, — you’re an adult now. Deal with your problems yourself. We warned you.

Hans was in despair. He paced the room, unable to find peace. He boiled with anger at the tax office, at the whole stupid system, and at those who had come up with it all.

And then, in his line of sight, appeared the umbrella.

— Yes! — Hans grinned wickedly, instantly devising his revenge on the city.

Standing by the window, watching the people bustling below, he felt like a master of fates — in his hands was something that couldn’t be measured in financial terms.

Without hesitation, Hans opened the horribly creaking umbrella with effort — as if it was resisting being part of such a dishonourable act — and the rain instantly began drumming on the windowsill.

Casually tossing it into the corner of the attic room, Hans-the-Wizard, as he jokingly called himself, leaned back contentedly in his chair and began pondering how the city services would deal with such a deluge and what losses the treasury would incur.

Two hours later, with a pounding heart, Hans, smiling, looked out through the slightly opened window at a rainstorm of unprecedented power, staring with satisfaction at the punished city.

— This calls for a celebration, — he said, rubbing his hands. — Coffee with cognac will do nicely.

And he rushed down the stairs to the kitchen.

Hurriedly descending, Hans slipped on the stairs — due to the rainwater that had seeped through holes in the roof. And before he could grab the handrail, he fell, tumbling down the stairs, breaking his neck.

There was no one left who could close the umbrella in the attic.

His glassy eyes no longer saw how the unleashed magic of the elements broke bridges, flooded streets, flipped over cars, and, undercutting, brought down houses, taking the lives of innocent people.

It all ended only when the water undercut Hans’s house to the point it collapsed into the raging current, burying the miracle — which had never found a worthy keeper.

Casually tossing it into the corner of the attic room,
Hans-the-Wizard, as he jokingly called himself, leaned back contentedly in his chair and began pondering how the city services would deal with such a deluge and what losses the treasury would incur.

Two hours later, with a pounding heart, Hans, smiling, looked out through the slightly opened window at a rainstorm of unprecedented power, staring with satisfaction at the punished city.

— This calls for a celebration, — he said, rubbing his hands. — Coffee with cognac will do nicely.

And he rushed down the stairs to the kitchen.

Hurriedly descending, Hans slipped on the stairs — due to the rainwater that had seeped through holes in the roof.
And before he could grab the handrail, he fell, tumbling down the stairs, breaking his neck.

There was no one left who could close the umbrella in the attic.

His glassy eyes no longer saw how the unleashed magic of the elements broke bridges, flooded streets, flipped over cars, and, undercutting, brought down houses, taking the lives of innocent people.

It all ended only when the water undercut Hans’s house to the point it collapsed into the raging current, burying the miracle — which had never found a worthy keeper.

Mother is lazy and neglectful among other things. How to exit for me and the child.,"To start my child is the greatest thing that's ever happened to me and I love being a father. My child's mother and I live together and I mean it's just never gotten better with her she's already lost a child for being not able to hold a job being lazy amongst other things. She barely changes him or anything or feed him I work full-time during the day but it ends up that I do everything when I get home I have to clean the whole house anything has to be done never gets done. I finally reached the point I'm tired of this and it's not fair to me or my child to have to live like this and I already raised him as a single parent primarily, thankfully while I'm at work he's able to go to his grandparent's house and stay while his mom sleeps and does nothing around the house. The hard part of this is that of course I cannot trust him to be alone with her or live with her she's too neglectful and does not pay enough attention or common sense she's already let him spill hot coffee on himself, get diaper rash from not getting changed, or going to his grandparents without even eating breakfast amongst other things like going outside to take a cigarette break while leaving a toddler inside alone which is not okay. I need to get full custody for myself and I'm sure that can easily be done but the problem in lies that we both have some substance abuse issues. Mine are more in the past, I know longer actively use anything other than things prescribed to me before my child was even born in order to combat addiction issues. We both do smoke marijuana which is legal where we are at. I smoke at night when the child is in bed and I'm getting ready to sleep meanwhile she does all the time, I would not mind it if she could actually do basic tasks on saying that she gets to intoxicated off marijuana to do basic tasks it's just I guess too lazy. I have tried to get her to go to the doctor mental health people everything to get help for herself and she will not do it or follow through with it, she will not follow through with anything and it's taking a severe toll on my mental and physical health as I have to stress about things all the time for my child's well-being and financially because while yes she gets a government check she waste all of her money and I end up being the financial responsible one while also having to buy her foolishness like cigarettes and whatnot. I'm not trying to complain I'm just stuck and tired and I don't know what to do I'll try talking to her and everything and she never wants to change and this cannot go on forever, and I feel like my child being danger if it kept going on with how neglectful she is. What is the best way I can go about this what do I do, I really do love her and wish things would just work out and she would straighten up and actually act like an adult and a mother but obviously that's not going to happen has been proven time and time again. I do care about her and I know she somewhere in her loves our child like she you loves her other child that got taken but she always talks about how hard that was but yet has only seen that child like once and makes no effort to. I feel like she likes the idea of being a mother more than actually doing it. Being an adult yet alone apparent is very hard it requires doing a lot of things you don't want to do when you don't want to do them for the benefit of your child. Being a parent is doing all kinds of things that you may not feel like doing or you're too tired to do but putting yourself aside that your child can have the best life it seems that she is incapable of putting anyone but herself first and if it requires her putting in any effort that has nothing to do with her its impossible for her. Sorry this was a long post I don't know what to do how to even start with this or go about it, yes I have access to a lawyer it's just more the emotional craziness I'm sure it's going to end suit raw me even trying to bring this up.

We can talk over coffee, and if you prefer we can meet a few times over just so we are both comfortable. Id very much like to discuss each other boundries, preferably I would like to meet someone around my age or atleast in your 20's. I am open to calling, texting, talking in person or just hanging out for a bit

I thought id throw a paper airplane out and see where it lands.

I am very very cuddly, and slim. I can host or come as a guest. I am very used to busses so anywhere from North van to Chilliwack I dont mind making the distance lol.

1pubqaf,https://www.reddit.com/r/cambodia/comments/1pubqaf/kampot_after_a_few_months/,Kampot after a few months :),"THINGS TO DO IN KAMPOT – my kind of travel 🌿✨

Just a little disclaimer before we start: this is my way of traveling.

I’m a 28-year-old woman who loves cultural and social experiences, but I also value comfort, beauty, good food and moments of deep relaxation. I travel slowly, I enjoy details and I like to treat myself. If this resonates with you, you’ll probably love Kampot.

Kampot Dog Sanctuary (High tide Café)

A truly magical place if you love dogs. You can enjoy a coffee with beautiful views, surrounded by rescued dogs. The sanctuary survives thanks to customer consumption, so just being there already supports their work.

Jason Tours

Highly recommended. The countryside bike tour through rural landscapes is wonderful, and the walking tour is a great introduction to the city. I love history and Jason knows a lot. His tours are sustainable, thoughtful and respectful of local culture and environment. I could not go to the salines tour but sure it would have also been good.

Bokor Mountain

Worth exploring, especially with a tour to better understand its history and surroundings.

Pepper plantations and salt fields

Both tours are very interesting and give you a deeper insight into the region and its traditions. I went to Le plantation, but there are many pepper plantations your can visit!

Secret Lake

One of my favorite spots around Kampot. Calm, beautiful and perfect for slowing down, swimming, reading or simply enjoying nature. A great escape from the city.

Sunset boat or kayak on the river

Simple but magical. Watching the sunset from the water is one of those Kampot moments you won’t forget.

Banteay – women only spa experience

The day spa experience is absolutely wonderful. You prepare your own body scrub, enjoy different treatments and spend the day fully relaxed in a beautiful, peaceful environment. I personally don’t recommend staying overnight, but the day experience is truly special and very nurturing.

Bazaar Café / Healing Spa

A beautiful café with a huge garden, delicious food, clothes and objects for sale. They also offer holistic therapies if you’re into spiritual or esoteric experiences. This place gives me so much peace.

Booksy

A lovely café full of books. Cozy, calm and perfect for slow mornings.

Epic Arts Café

Amazing food and a beautiful social project that promotes inclusion of people with disabilities in the workforce. Great projects and very good food, especially if you miss Western cuisine.

Oh Neil’s Irish Bar

The oldest bar in Kampot. Classic, social and full of stories.

The Magic Sponge

One of my favorite places for a relaxed night. Alternative, artsy vibe, sometimes live music and always interesting people.

Hotel Old Cinema

Pure magic if your budget is higher and you want to stay in the city center. The attention to detail, the atmosphere, the staff, the food and the pool… everything feels carefully curated. Even if you don’t stay here, come for a meal. It’s pricey, but worth it.

Sabay Beach Hotel

More affordable and equally wonderful. Private kayaks, a small private beach, spectacular sunsets and delicious food. My go-to place whenever I need beauty, relaxation and a full reset.

Fish Island Community

Great food and inspiring artistic and cultural projects. Highly recommended if you’re into creative and community-based spaces.

Day trip to Kep

Only 30 minutes by tuk-tuk from Kampot. A perfect day can include coffee with incredible views at Kep West (very expensive, so just coffee), a walk through the Crab Market, lunch at Holy Crab to try the famous pepper crab, a beach walk or swim, and exploring the coastline with its traditional fishing boats. I also love Arts Café Kep for its decoration and views.

Kampot is one of those places that invites you to slow down, connect and truly enjoy.

1pubq55,https://i.redd.it/3qiscodn829g1.jpeg,My Chase trip to Philly,"Wanted to use up some of the newer credits on the Reserve before the end of the year, I looked at a lot of different places…here’s where I ended up on my trip to Philadelphia! Honestly it was a great little solo getaway before the holidays…and I feel like I got a ton of value for everything! Only way I could have squeezed more was to get a StubHub ticket for something in town (I looked…nothing interested me).

 

Hotel: Loews Philadelphia (2 nights (Wed/Thurs night) $257.31 + 15,500 points (I think at 1.5X Boost)

Charge posted on 11/13, $250 Edit Credit posted on 11/14

Booked King Room, got upgraded at Check-In to 30th Floor corner room overlooking the city…really was an incredible view

Overall I got over $200 in value from the ‘added perks’ of Edit, and only ended up paying $12 for a service fee that wasn’t covered

Welcome Amenity was 2 Welcome Drinks at the bar (had one first night, and another the second night…both about $18+$3 tip)

Daily Breakfast at restaurant: Entrée/Specialty coffee/tip was right around $35 each day

$100 Property Credit was only for F&B or Parking.

Had oysters and a martini in the bar: $41

Cheese Plate & 1 Glass of Champagne in Room Service:$48

Dining Credit:

Almanac: $85.02 (2 Drinks, 2 app/bites, tip)

Dined on 12/11; charge was pending for about 5 days, once posted the dining credit was applied same day

Note: I kept all my paper receipts, when the charge was pending and when it posted as ‘Ogawa’ which is their sister restaurant downstairs (and not listed as an ‘included table’). So I was curious if it was going to be recognized…and it was!

Travel:

PHL Chase Lounge

Spent about 2 hours before my flight enjoying the lounge! First time here and it was nice!! I compared it to the Boston one with the size and windows…I got to have a nice Philly Cheese steak and delicious drinks, and was lucky enough to get a spot for a facial and time in the ‘relax pod’.",26,1766542105.0,ChaseSapphire,20,0.93,False
1pubpc0,https://www.reddit.com/r/digitalnomad/comments/1pubpc0/building_a_startup_traveling_in_2026_looking_for/,"Building a Startup, Traveling in 2026 — Looking for Surf/Kite/Golf/Snow Nomad Communities","What’s up everyone.

I’m 33, American, and I spent the past (about) seven years in a corporate job before finally quitting in August to build my own business. 

Right now I’m building a financial, budgeting, and travel tool, and I am documenting the process as I build it. 

After a few months of working on building, it became really clear how much more there is to build, and under no circumstances do I want to go back to corporate life if I can avoid it.

So I’m going all-in in 2026.

I cashed out my 401k, about $100k, and the plan is to spend roughly nine months in nine different locations, one month at a time. 

The goal is to live cheap, stay healthy, and work nonstop until the business either works or the money runs out. 

Very much a build year!

What I see my day-to-day as:  I wake up, (surf/snowboard/kite surf), eat, work, eat, sleep, and repeat. 

My weekdays are long workdays. (10-14 hours a day)

One day a week I’ll go out, explore, socialize, and do something local so I don’t burn out or lose touch with the world.

What I really want out of this though is community.

I’m hoping to meet people along the way who are actually doing things: founders, builders, engineers, operators, and nomads who really work. 

People who like surfing, kiting, snowboarding, training, and long focused days. 

Just disciplined, chill people who like getting a session in the morning and grinding during the day.

I want people to meet up with, catch waves, grab a beer, go on a double date, plan a founders dinner, or have a casual BBQ from time to time so life doesn’t turn into total isolation.

My tentative route right now starts in Bali and then moves through Thailand, Vietnam, the Philippines, Greece, Portugal, Spain, and Morocco, with Dubai possibly mixed in somewhere. 

I’m flexible on the order and open to changing plans if something better comes up.

Wondering if it’s better to books everything ahead of time?  Or book on a month to month basis?

I’m especially interested in places with a strong nomad presence around surfing, kite surfing, or snowboarding, where people actually stay for a while and it’s not just short-term tourists passing through. 

Cost does matter to me too.  

I’m intentionally leaving Los Angeles to simplify my life and stay focused, ideally keeping housing around $1,500 a month or less is the goal!

So I’m curious what people here think. 

Where have you stayed long-term and genuinely liked the people? 

What places right now have a good mix of board sports, solid nomad communities, and affordable living? 

Are there any towns where builders seem to naturally cluster?

If you’re doing something similar in 2026 or already living this way, I’d love to connect. Even just swapping notes or grabbing a coffee when paths cross would be great.

We found her in the floor in the morning slurring her words, we were all already deeply concerned. Somehow, she had fallen out of her chair that she had been sleeping in for the past 7 months. She had been recovering from a pretty rough back surgery and here I was burning the embers of hope that everything was going to be ok.

Worry starts to creep in as the Ems finally arrives at the scene. reality is kicks in as I put two and two together, this  grave situation it wasn’t even a year since our lovely Salem trip, she was still so full of life, but 11 months later deterioration had engulfed her mortal form. When does one have enough? Enough of the chemo treatment, when does one hit their limit of the tests can you imagine how draining this reality actually is. One of the things that sets in after a while that’s kind of of weird from a outside perspective is test anxiety. You watch your loved one go through hell and all you can do is to be there for them every step of the way.  From the outside everyone else seems to see the situation but are you really ready to let go? How does one express the ties that bind being severed? Existential dread enters stage left, what’s the point of all of this suffering?

At least I tried and I hope I did right by her, every step of the way I tried to be her rock in the end you can only hope for the best and that you loved them with every fiber of your body until you collapse.  they are more than a person they are a extended part of yourself. Going through something like this changes you, dynamics change as both of you experience the trauma of both of your worlds falling apart. Nothing you can do can stop it even though you try with your entire being to the point of complete collapse, it will never be enough but all you can do is help carry the load become their Samwell as they carry the ring to mount doom.



We are all alone and vulnerable but together we are stronger than apart, this is why this burden, must be shared, one cannot bear the curse by thyself. Personally, I have no idea why people split up, when they get the news that their loved one gets the C nuke dropped on them. The day she got the news still haunts me to this day, the look on the doctors face says it all a piece of their own soul being torn to shreds. Just the thought that this person has to do this to a lot of her patients that she has known for years, you can only dissociate so much. You will feel it eventually the reaper has demanded his price and it shall be paid in blood.

The audience may ask why are you not telling us what actually happened right here and the now, well why would I want to dwell on what is about to happen. Like a chatty Cathy in a elevator they are here just to fill time, their expectations are to avoid the reality, you already know the answer, but you can’t force yourself to SPEAK the answer. But the reality of the situation simmers, and it prods and pokes your subconscious looking for a way out even the bottle cannot stop it. exposing the seams we can’t just sit here and ignore the elephant in the room.

There she is laying in a  hospital bed in the ER with a oxygen mask hugging her face, barely hanging on. hope is still in the cards for us or me at least how can someone you love so much just go like that? As they do tests on her, the gravity of reailty crushes the air out of the room, her blood pressure is crashing or was this at UK, honestly things kind of blend together on this for me.  It was like everyone else knew what the inevitable, her aunt Marsha even sat down with me to let me know that this might the end of the line. she knew but here I was oblivious to the cold hard facts, trying to keep the faith.

In some ways our marriage feels like a Faustian bargain, you found someone that you loved, subconsciously we knew in the back of our minds that this was a possibility but it to bear fruit this early was something no one of where prepared for. Would I do this whole Fucked ordeal all over again, you bet your ass I would. Seeing her eyes light up in those small moments of joy but the voices in the back of your head are whispering that she would still be alive if you two never met. But would she have found happiness, the what ifs will drive the most logical individual to madness.

 

I snap out of it, reality sets in  with the old familiar sight of the walls of UK chandlers hospital, the smell of disinfected linger the air. A doctor is looking at me and Stacys mom with that look “***we need to talk about putting Stacy into Hospice***.” The shoe drops with the impact of a nuclear bomb, **“We need your permission now to do this we do not think she will leave this hospital alive”.** the weight grows heavier with every step. This paragraph has taken me weeks to finish, but I must get this done so she must persist.



The sword of Damocles now hangs over my head, the fate of another is in my hands by law, What if I make the wrong choice no one talks about what we go through as spouses and caregivers the moral weight of decisions, it will eat at you and tear you apart bit by bit. What if I got it wrong? What if the doctor got this wrong? It’s a miracle she can still live but then you ponder that inquiry what would her life be like going forward? The past 7 months have been a downward spiral of nothing but struggle and a declining comfort of life. The short amount of days I was there, will forever haunt me.

Its so weird how calm we actually make these kinds of decisions in high stress situations, imagine 2 people sitting across from each other drinking coffee “oh yes, your wife is dying, can you sign here so we can put her where usually old people go  when there on their last legs” this was not the fate meant for someone very young and briming with life, she had so much more love to give. The ticking of the clock reverbs into your skull, reminding you that life could end at any second and here I am putting my thumb on the scales. Like any good hospital stay of someone barely hanging on by a thread, I pace up and down the halls, anxiety has overtaken me, the guilt, the worry is eating at me. I walked on the  balcony to light up a cigarette in the dead of night waiting, waiting for the dark to whisk her away into the eternal night.



They say guardian angels are there watching us in an ivory tower on a cloud, judging us from heaven on high.  But in reality, real angels are people showing their empathy. This unexpected end, love had taken us to this parting of ways. Stepping into hospice we did not know what to expect or at least I didn’t. Shit was happening so fast we did not have time to think about our lives where in freefall. You’re standing in this moment with a gun to your head the hammer cocked, there is no time to freakout my love, you are strapped in, enjoy the freefall to hell. there is only way out of this and that is forward into the fire. The decisions here are the hardest that I will ever have to do. Relief is only found in the moments of serenity of the moments alone.

 

When all of us got there we meet a actual angel a young lady with facial piercings her name was mercy, she was so graceful with the way she handled this I mean it is her job but this job you have to be built different having to see family’s day in, day out seeing off their love ones to the great beyond. Her and the staff are more than just the ferryman but legit saints they themselves must take on this impossible burden, they themselves with their grace, they lose apart of themselves doing this duty. I know I lost a huge chuck of my soul in that room I took a zippo to my own angel wings watching them engulfed in fire not thinking if I’m going to be born out of the ashes or will it swallow my entire being, it took me a entire year to find a answer to that question.

One of the most amazing things that I witnessed in my life is that her entire medical team visited her I don’t think this happens that often with a cancer team but Stacy left such huge of a impact that they came to her side at her darkest hour to see her off to the great beyond. You never think you would see a oncologist cry so deeply, if Mara Chambers ever reads this I want to think you and everyone that took care of her the past what is it 7 years now? I want to thank everyone who helped her over the years and a shout out to josh who passed away during her first trip around the chemo circuit, she loved him so much. Where was I oh yes seeing a whole group of doctors in tears with us is such a moving moment, we were all apart of each other’s life’s. this was not just a goodbye to Stacy but also a parting of ways for us.

You think you know what’s its like to see a love one pass away from a chronic disease directly  but if you haven’t experienced it, I hope you don’t its one of my most hardest experiences you will ever have to face, somehow I am still standing here, you question to yourself why is it not me there with the oxygen mask on at full blast, why is it not my blood pressure that is crashing at a alarming rate?

Merry xmas everyone!

 I’m currently looking for something light and pressure-free. I’ve realized that I’ve been too enclosed and narrow in my experiences with people, so I’m making a conscious effort to open up and embrace life to its fullest ethically, of course!

Are you maybe the type of person who’s also looking for a companion? Someone who’d be down for simple, meaningful moments like grabbing coffee, taking a walk in the park, having movie nights, or enjoying a picnic together? Just appreciating each other’s company without any pressure or expectations hanging over us? Maybe you’re at that stage too.

If something serious comes from it I wont deny but rather welcome it.  

If that resonates with you, just hmu!

We have three adult children that are going with us. The youngest is under 21. Of the older two, one would like to drink alcohol, the other kid and his younger sibling are fine with sodas, coffees and smoothies.

We've booked two rooms, one for us two and one for the three of them. We're getting the unlimited alcohol package and the kids are currently signed up for the non alcohol package.

Since the one kid has now said he'd like to drink, what are my options? My first thought is to transfer people around and say that the three drinkers will be in one room and the non-drinkers will be in the other but obviously we don't actually want that sleeping arrangement. Do they monitor who sleeps where? Are there any better options?

I'm hoping someone with more cruise experience can help here. I'm not trying to cheat the system, I want to pay for the drinks that everyone plans on drinking but I don't want to pay hundreds of extra dollars that will go to waste for alcohol that will not be drunk.",1,1766541297.0,royalcaribbean,26,0.6,False

I think sin is a part of life and it actually gets us closer to God when we realize sin is just temporary and we really seek what God has in store for us. You know I have friends that act like they're perfect or just because they don't use they think they're better than people. But yet they masterbate and lust everyday. I think we can't ever disrupt God's plan for us no matter what we do, sure we can delay it but once God has a plan for you nothing can stop it. It's funny cause ever since I've had a relationship with God it's been in my mind 24/7, and I think that's the most important thing. Sure we aren't perfect no one is, but why do you do the things you do? Are you seeking truth? Happiness? Whatever it is that you're seeking God can provide it for you. God's grace is so undeniable but I feel like grace has it's limits. God has a plan for all of us, but are you going to follow that plan or do what you want? If we have a destiny where does freewill play in that? I feel like when you have discernment you are vibrating at a higher frequency and no matter what you do you can't block God's messages. When you have the holy Spirit in you, nothing can stop it, it's a permanent thing when you're saved. Your life isn't the same, experiences aren't the same when God is involved. Who's to say we are better than anyone? God only knows that. We need people who think differently and see things differently. It may not make sense to other people but if it makes sense to you and you feel that spiritually, then what's the problem? I feel like God made us all unique for a purpose, we all have different spiritual gifts and that's why we need to share our perspective with others. We can't be scared to speak our truth, even if others don't get it. Because God is the spirit of Love and if we can feel love then imagine what God has felt while he feels Love. We are created in the image of God, so that means God has felt sadness, happiness, confusion, depression, everything we feel. He wanted to share these feelings with other beings, which is why I think he created us in his own image. I think this is all a test to see if we are good enough to get to heaven. That next level. I mean think about it, God wants only the ride or dies with him. Why would the next level to this life be so easy? If it was then Heaven wouldn't be worth it. That's why the devil attacks spiritual people, because he doesn't want us to experience that next 'level' he wants us where he can't go anymore. He uses sin to try and trap you but that's the beautiful thing about Jesus, he took all of our sins and paid that price. So does that mean we can do whatever we want because he paid that price? No, I don't think so. But I think if you keep on seeking diligently then there's no way you can go down the wrong path. Even when you 'mess up' God is still right there. We all have our vices, who says one is better than the other? You think God sees it like that? I don't think so. But humans act like like they're better than people because pride is part of who we are, but I know God sees the good in all of us. If you diligently keep on seeking him, then there's no way he won't lead you on that right path. So again what is destiny if there is free will? God's plan is so grounded in us that everything is a part of the process, we all learn and grow closer to him on our time and our own way. The holy Spirit is so strong that no matter what you do it will always be apart of you. Once you give your life to God, that's it, he's with you no matter what you try to do. He won't let you go down a wrong path because the path is already laid out for you, because once you give your life to God then you're his forever. Obedience is hard, but are you constantly seeking him and thinking for yourself? Or are you listening to other people and taking advice from them? Yes their are people who are ordained by God to lead people, but do you have a strong enough discernment to see who to follow? The kingdom is within, that's what God says. Our body is the temple. That's why fasting is so important, because we are relying purely on God for everything. He is our food. Billionaire's know the importance of fasting, and fasting can apply to multiple things not just food.

1pubeo7,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1pubeo7,"I've been doubting my self-typing, sooo help","Stuff about me :

I've always been very sensitive to the arts, to beautiful and meaningful things. I was an artist for as long as I can remember, but lately I haven't really made anything. I mostly create in order to give (as gifts or posts) and rarely create anything for myself. I am someone who viscerally hates the way things are and don't want to partake in them, as a result I was a high-school dropout and only picked my studies back up this year. I was a nihilist for many years and am still struggling to get out of that mindset. I have never fallen in love even though I have been in relationships. 



I am 'live and let live' but I judge people in my mind, especially when they do things in a way that disagrees with how I would do them. I have an extreme disconnect from my feelings but this wasn't always the case. I have a very hard time putting myself in others' shoes.



Why I've been doubting (relevant to the last paragraph) : >!For the longest time I typed myself as ISTP because I thought my disconnect from emotions/empathy meant high Ti. I also hated the idea of being sensitive in any way, it made me feel too vulnerable. About a month ago I've had an epiphany and realized I had been denying my emotions/sensitivities on purpose as a defense mechanism. I had been literally fooling myself in trying to become my ideal idea of myself (aka an ISTP I guess). I've been slowly trying to accept the fact that I am in fact a highly emotional person. It's hard to not hate it when it's what made me go through very harsh things.!<

  
So, what do you guys think? I'll answer any additional questions :) ",2,1766541130.0,MbtiTypeMe,3,1.0,False

We've got 24 months to study the syllabus before the exam. Now it's already 16 months have gone. I'm doing Chemistry , Physics and Maths. I'm okay with Chemistry. But I'm stucked with other two as I didn't study them well. I wasted all the time on phone , girls , social media. I'm a fast learner and I used to be the topper in my class and most of the exams. But now I'm kinda feeling miserable and can't get back into studying.

If I study very hard for the next 8 months , I can fulfil my dream to enter the university. But I'm struggling with studies. I'm very distracted rn. Social media , Youtube and sometimes with the nasty stuff.

How could I come out of this miserable life pattern which wastes lots of time. I want to get back to studying.

Here's what I should do according to my teachers and seniors  
Limit the sleep to 4-5 hours and work more than 10hrs a day.

I'm struggling with sleep too. I used to get a 9-10 hrs of sleep and can't help with waking in the morning. Coffee is the only thing which keeps me awake at night. I don't how much should I sleep.

It's been a long journey to getting here (lots of ER visits and gaslighting about just having anxiety) but finally did every test imaginable and got to this diagnosis. I just wanted to see if there is anyone else dealing with this craziness, doc said it was pretty rare, and even then I mean none of the usual criteria (wish I had this luck in the lotto instead 😓). 

Chest pain, heart palpitations, coughing (alllll the time), regurgitation, SOB, urghhhhhh. 

 

I've tried:

\-diet changes (avoiding rice, tough meats, grease .... tried coffee but it's one of those loves I've been having a tough time with)

\-peppermints 

\-PPIs

\-SSRI (low dose) - I tried going higher than the lowest dose and it gave me hallucinations!! Legitimately scary

\-doc wants to try calcium blockers but I'm a little nervous about fainting since it's usually used for high blood pressure! I'm really sensitive with meds :c

But I’ve been working on myself, opening up more socially, and I’m genuinely ready to connect with someone.

A bit about me:
Firstly I have some sort of fame, if thats what you call it. I made a dating site promoting my singleness DatingKen, which caught news in Boston and Matt Sheer a reporter social media. I’m a huge nerd who loves conventions, gaming, and cosplay. It’s been an amazing community for me, and I’ve met some great friends through it. I cosplay characters like Eddie Munson from Stranger Things and Leon from Resident Evil. I stay active, take care of myself, and oddly enough, I’m freakishly lucky with raffles and giveaways (no clue why, but I’ll take it).

I’m looking for someone kind, patient, and down-to-earth. You don’t need to cosplay — just be someone who enjoys nerdy stuff or at least doesn’t mind it. I’m not expecting perfection; I just want a genuine connection with someone who understands what it’s like to navigate dating later than most.

Shall I call that a win? Or a such a loss that it circle in on itself to become a success? Oh well, whatever, at least I had an easier time writing today. I wrote 720 words for I'm Still Sisyphus. The scene is just one or two paragraphs away from being finished. It took me a while to get into writing today, not due to any lapse in ability on my mind's part but rather because Peach insisted on sitting in my chair with me. Or rather, because Peach insister on sitting being me and slowly kicking me out of my own office chair. She did not win that battle but my back certainly lost. After this scene, there is one more and then we are on to the final chapter. I need to make some setting notes before I got to the next scene though so I'll work on that while I have my evening coffee. Wish me luck in that.

Sadly, the snow is still dwindling. It snowed a little last night but very little of it was still lingering in the morning. It was more foggy than anything. So far, there are no signs of it snowing in time for Christmas. I suppose my only hope is that what little remains stays at least for the next two days. How disappointing. I am getting in the spirit in other ways. I started my yearly read of A Little Princess by Frances Hodgson Burnett last night. I've had this copy since I was an infant and it was the first book I ever fell in love with. I skimmed through my favourite parts last night with some eggnog; Sera consoling Lottie, sharing a slice of cake with Becky, giving buns to the beggar girl, and Sera waking up to a magic gift after being scolded by Miss Minchin. It is not at all a christmas book but the spirit of the story suits this time of year. I may read more tonight. I may also watching Mickey's prince and the pauper; also not a christmas story but it is a christmas tradition of mine. Holidays are what you make of them.

So far the best option seems to be Delonghi Magnifica Start Silver, but I am concerned by all the bad reviews on Amazon. I don't have the money for Jura. Ninja Luxe Cafe is highly rated, but seems to require manual cleaning of the brew basket after each use,  so, it's a no-go.

Was curious if anyone else has experienced similar or has any insights I don't. I'm not even sure if she's FA anymore cuz I never saw her swing anxious with me. 

- Affectionate and a little touchy after some drinking, even as little as one beer

- Said some pretty revealing things after she reached out months after the discard, and I told her to be real or be gone. She has apologized (with many, many ifs), such as ""I always leave first"", ""My sense of self is kaleidoscopic"", ""relationships should be easy""

- Described friendship as ""ending in a slow fade"" and romantic relationships as ""a trap door that closes behind you""

- She future faked, and I was constantly the one making anything actually happen. When I pointed that out after she tried to reach out again, she made one plan for coffee for the next week, but was still devoid of self determination.

- Didn't seem to want anything or have a direction of any kind. Avoiding discomfort and running away via moving cities seems to be the most consistent course of action

- Hypocritical. Ironically was the one who told me she hates people who use ambivalence and the guise of politeness and plausible deniability to get away with stuff. 

- always rescheduled for as little as 5 minutes, I imagine for a sense of control

And these two are particularly confusing to me. 

So last we spoke meant months ago, I had forgave her but continued talking with her to see if there was any path forward for repair. She volunteered to meet at her apartment. It was my first time there. At some point I was discussing something and realized I was scared, so I said that. Called myself a scared little chimp or something. She immediately gets on this weird ""I can go pee if you want"" train. I was very confused and told her it's her house and she doesn't need my permission to do so. She insisted that she could but she could also hold it in. I again questioned the point of asking me to use the bathroom in her own apartment. I even made a joke about her performatively peeing, where she's gonna run in there and run water from the sink to the toilet bowl to simulate peeing. She kept insisting anyways, and I finally said go ahead. Still have no idea what that's about. There was a whole bunch of odd stuff that happened then. She told me she walked past my work on a day she knows I work but didn't see me there. In this one meeting, she said we're friends, we have no foundation for friendship, and we've always been romantic (she discarded the day before our first date). There are many other details there but whatever. Last thing I said to her was I won't be reaching out for now, she made some attempt to devalue the relationship but told me to hit her up if I'm at the bar or something. I said ""You have my number and I have yours"" and I haven't heard from her since then. 

The second weird one is from the time before last. I was talking about how there's no such thing as the perfect partner, and even if there was, you'd eventually grow to resent them in comparison. She dissociated after I said that. I was mid sentence when I saw that she was facing off to my left, thousand yard stare, pinky at the corner of her slightly open mouth. I stopped talking when I saw this and It went on for a whole 10 seconds. When she came to, she looked right at me for a quarter of a second and then immediately put on a fake laugh, and started talking like nothing happened. I didn't acknowledge it to her face. Granted, there's plenty I noticed that she doesn't know I noticed. 


Long post, I know, but any insight would be helpful. I don't really know what to make out of this, and it's about to be a year since the discard, so it had me thinking. I'm also fairly convinced that she didn't particularly care for me, but didn't expect me to get so cost to the bone either. I could tell when she was panicked even if she hid it well. Idk. Any input would be welcome here. I'd love to hear if anyone else has interesting behaviors that they picked up on.",3,1766539326.0,AvoidantBreakUps,9,1.0,False

I just wanted to thank all of you for participating in this and contributing to the sub. I really look forward to coffee advent calendars -- always a wild ride of soo many new beans in a short amount of time -- and half the fun is sharing the experience, notes, perceptions with others.

\---I know there are at least a few of your that seem to have gotten a bad batch, or had something happen to the beans in the calendar where you’re getting subpar results. That’s really unfortunate. Might be worthwhile to connect with each other and reach out to Tanat again together – a lot harder to ignore a group of people all experiencing the same problem.",1,1766539250.0,TanatAdventCalendar25,0,1.0,False
1puarf4,https://i.redd.it/inu9u8d4029g1.jpeg,How do I explain to them that this is like saying you can be racist to white people? (CAHH),"It is always wrong to disrespect any religion, but most people practicing Christianity in the Western world are not at risk of violence for their religion; this is so unlike the example this person gave.
Christianity is a universal (accepting of converts) religion of over one billion followers. Haitian Vodou, Louisiana Voodoo, and other African diasporic ethno-religions (not usually accepting of converts, inherently tied to ethnicity) are TINY in comparison and have been demonized for centuries by their white abusers. Christianity, no, was not founded by white people, but white people have utilized this powerful, oraganized religion (most diasporic religions are not organized and thus, have no higher authority to protect those who practice them) as a way to force people of color into submission across the world.
By demonizing these religions and disrespecting those who practice them, you further strip the descendants of enslaved Africans of their cultural roots and whitewash their societies. Vivienne depicting Voodoo is wrong because it is an ethno-religion that is closed to the outside world as a result of being constantly stigmatized; people are still killed, even today, for practicing these diasporic religions all around the world.
People asking to keep their culture private in order to protect their safety isn't a lot to ask for, and Vivienne only changed Alastor from practicing Voodoo after facing criticism for it when the pilot aired, not because she understood the sheer insensitivity she demonstrated to her millions of viewers around the world.

1puaq5j,https://www.reddit.com/r/confessions/comments/1puaq5j/i_stole_someones_coffee/,I stole someone’s coffee,"I must confess my first act of petty theft, but was it justified?

So i was at a theme park because i had some rewards to redeem and i was going to use them on a coffee at the starbucks.

Its nearing closing time and there is a pretty long wait but eventually it is my turn. Naturally i get an iced caramel macchiato bc we all know it is the best and i go to wait for my order. The strange thing was that they weren’t taking names for the orders. I thought oh well whatever. But then i see my drink come out and this lady goes up and takes it saying “ it was supposed to be hot but i dont have time to wait.”

For a bit i just figured they made a mistake but then when the orders behind me were getting finished before mine i realized she took my drink! Just to make sure, i go up and look and sure enough there is her hot caramel machiatto

I get a little annoyed but shrug it off and go to explain to one of the baristas what happened, but when i get up there i chicken out and just take someone elses drink letting them have the hassle for that.

Well thats my confession, hopefully the Starbucks gods dont strike me down for my thievery ",1,1766539135.0,confessions,5,0.67,False
