Now a new news article of a lady finding a phone camera in Asha Sweets in Koramangala is doing the rounds. 

At this moment as a 34yr old woman, the first thing I do when I'm going to any place is check mirrors and if there are any hidden cameras which shouldn't be something anyone should do. I have even gone to the extent of carrying my own water bottle and not drinking any liquids to avoid a trip to the bathroom. 

Have started eating at home to stop thinking about this and avoiding going to pubs altogether. 

Is anyone feeling this sense of distrust and how are you tackling this feeling currently?

I am a W2 employee at a big tech, and I’ve been working for about 5 years. Recently, I started to realize corporate isn’t really for me. I hate the idea of doing something that does not serve anyone. I feel like a cog in a machine and  im building something that doesn’t really make this world a better place. Corporate meetings, kissing up, and being dependent on my job scares me, and I want to get out of this rat race.  I’ve been reading a ton about acquiring a small business and starting an e-commerce business, but I’m not entirely sure where to start. I was wondering if there’s someone out there who’s willing to mentor me and help me get started on this entrepreneurial journey. I’m particularly interested in laundromats, coffee shops or any e-commerce business. 

[What I can offer]
I understand that you may not have any incentives to help me. So this post might seem silly. But I am willing to work and I can help in any ways. If you are in LA, I can help out for free on weeknights and weekends. I might not have much to offer, but I do work in advertising and I know how ads algorithms are built. As a small return, I can help run a marketing campaign effectively, digitalize any manual process, or automate any manual processes. I understand that what I’m offering is minimal and most people won’t take up the offer. But wanted to make this post just in case there’s one person out there who is willing to mentor and save me from my mundane, seemingly depressing, and sad corporate job.

1kq2s2v,https://www.reddit.com/r/WhatShouldIDo/comments/1kq2s2v/should_i_move_states/,Should I move states?,"Hey all this one is gonna be loaded,

I, 22 year old male, just graduated from a major state school in Indiana with my nursing degree. I just started a job as an ER nurse at a local stand alone ER. Pay is about 46.25 an hour since I don’t take benefits. The work environment is good but nursing really isn’t my calling. I was a cop before I was a nurse so I’m getting hired onto a local sheriff dept. I get sworn in in a couple weeks. I’ll leave my nursing job when that comes around. (I know it’s soon)

Currently I live alone in a nice luxury apartment complex in my city where I work. It’s safe here and overall a nice place. I have an attached garage and it’s fully renovated. I pay about 1600 a month all in with utilities. At the end of my lease in September I’m looking to move out because my rent will be moved up to almost 1900 with utilities for a one bedroom 800 square foot apartment. 

Looking around the area there really isn’t much cheaper. On top of that I’ve been having really big issues with my step mom who just got married to my dad a couple years ago. She’s been having coffee with my ex from a year ago (who is also a nurse) and basically digging up dirt that ends up in my workplace. I moved out of my dad and step mom’s house because of how bad our relationship was and cut contact but it still seems she finds a way to make my work environment difficult. I’ve been approached by people in my workplace asking about my dead relationship and getting overly personal about the situation. If I end up at the sheriff she has a lot of influence there too since she knows a lot of important people there.

I have always liked Michigan and the national/state parks off Lake Michigan. I was looking at Ludington Michigan as a place to move to. I’m huge on being outside and it’s only 4 hours from here. Real estate is much cheaper. I always dreamed of being in a rural area near the water. The area is almost completely surrounded by protected areas. The nurse job out there looks to be 36 an hour. I just don’t want to be miserable as a nurse and be lonely. I just want a fresh start without her influence. I can’t be a Michigan cop because my law enforcement certification doesn’t transfer. Should I move? I probably wouldn’t be able to afford a house but might be able to get an apartment. Apartments around there are about 1100 without utilities. Houses seem to be around 220k.

1kq2r3z,https://www.reddit.com/r/vagabond/comments/1kq2r3z/spanging_101/,Spanging 101,"**Panhandle 101**

I want to start out by saying ""spanging"" (spare changing) is not a pleasant way to make money, you will be verbally abused **constantly** it takes a thick skin; don't lose your cool because you probably will get kicked out of your spot or attract police attention. It's also dangerous, you might be threatened with physical violence or experience physical violence.

Okay so the very start of it will be simple.

Scout out grocery stores, use google maps traffic feature to figure out best times for foot traffic (Usually 3pm ish but bursts around noon during work breaks).

Or really you can just sit in front of a store any time.

Have a cup, any cup, the more interesting the cup the better but nothing that looks expensive. Hats also work. If you happen to play music, an instrument case works great but let's not get ahead of ourselves we're starting small.

Sit in front of a store, depending on your confidence level, the silent shy approach works, but a light jingle of the cup, or a ""hello"" goes a long way. A ""howdy"" goes a really long way, especially if you happen to be collecting in a cowboy hat.

Let's assume you're doing the silent approach. Have some coins to start in your cup if you can, if people see donations they donate. Put large bills in your pocket because you don't want to have people thinking you're making too much. One cheeky fiver might lead to a twenty but sometimes it slows things down.

Assume you'll be kicked out, be polite, don't give them a hassle, at the end of the day they probably don't want to do their job any more than you want to do this. Some stores are more diligent than others, they range from super strict to utterly complicit; scout your stores and you'll get to know the management and security. Some people are super troopers and take their job super seriously, a lot of them really don't give a fuck, some of them are empathetic.

There's a good chance you'll get to know police to, the same principle applies; steer clear of super troopers and just do as they say, it sucks but don't lose your cool and get arrested or otherwise removed. People say ACAB, and I agree in spirit, but I find a lot of cops are entirely hesitant to do their jobs, sometimes out of empathy rather than laziness. At the end of the day, know that most people hate their jobs and work on that.

The big disadvantage of this is that it draws A LOT of attention, sometimes positive, usually negative; you'll get a lot of shit from people, expect a lot of ""get a job"", and honestly, pursue that route in tandem if you can, because temp work will be better for your spirit than this. It can feel really soul crushing at times.

Don't lose your cool with people, politeness goes a long long way, even if it's fake, but especially if its genuine.

Signs are entirely optional in my experience. Things that have worked for me;

""Does it really matter what my sign says?""  
  
""(Blank sign)"" \~ tell them you can't afford a sharpie  
  
Short 4 rent""

""My dog ate my house""

""Can't pay rent, live in tent, dont do fent!""

""Elon Musk stole my lunch money""

""Need coins pls and ty  
(best picture of mario hitting a coin block)""

""Making soup for a group, I could eat a whole chicken coop""

""The Buddha says begging humbles you""

""I can haz cheeseburger?""

""I'd like to be drinking coffee for free""

""~~homeless~~ ~~houseless~~ ~~bum~~ ~~hobo~~ HUMAN""

""Teach a man to fish, give me an apprenticeship""  
(in front of a construction supply store)

""Rhymes 4 Dimes"" (Requires rhyming ability)

I can also give tips on traffic panning, and some very basic tips on busking.

I love being in a walkable area where I can grab a coffee, walk my dog, and just feel safe in general. I’m also trying to get closer to the beach so I can pop over a few times a week, but I still love that city energy (if that makes sense?).

Recently out of a relationship, so I’m definitely looking to meet new people and build community — ideally somewhere with folks in their late 20s to mid 30s. Would especially love to be in an area where there are more Black men (just being real here!). Also not trying to spend an absurd amount on rent anymore — I want something decent and within budget, not luxury high-rise prices. Ideally something under $2600 but as spacious as possible 

Curious what people think of the Palms area? I’m looking at a few spots — one close to downtown Culver (clarington) and another on the opposite end near the 10 (woodclife). Any pros/cons I should know? Is it walkable, safe, dog-friendly, good for dating/social life, etc.? Open to any recs or neighborhoods y’all think fit my vibe!

I'm 26F and i work in a gas station in a rich part of town, more specifically in food service. I begun working there for almost 5 months now and i do like the place, it's a hard job but i am in a really good team and my bosses are fair and good hard working people. Even the owner is a really great guy. Some weeks ago i was in a really bad day, the store was cramped, everyone was really busy, even my boss was cleaning the tables and the other manager was helping the cashiers, it was A friday afternoon. I was there, with two orders to do when this guy walks in front of me, smirk on his face like he was better than anyone else and this brushed me the wrong way but, i tried to focus on the orders and i greeted him like anybody else. 
""Good Afternoon Sir, how are you doing?""
It was loud because the tables are almost full, the rest of the team was busy, and the music inside the store was kinda loud that particular day.
What i could get was a snack and a brewed coffee.
I remembered asking what size he wants his coffee but it was mid hell and i forget. I get the snack and the medium cup of coffee. Big mistake, he blew up with me at the table loudly saying he specifically said he wanted the the smaller cup, i tried to apologize and was offer him the medium cup for the price of the smaller one but he insisted being more agressive: ""i said two times! oh my god!"". I stared blankly at him like i had nothing to lose and said: ""I aprecciate if you speak to me more politely"" and he sighs with a ""please, i want the smaller one"" looking bored. I bolted to the kitchen and my colleage said i was pale as a ghost, shaking and 30 seconds after,  crying. She was ready to tear down the person who did this and i stoped her. ""I got this"" i said and i just... delivered the rest of order. That was the first time i felt real fear and i didn't understand why i could possibly do to making him flipping at me so fast, a inocent random stranger. It was coffee. In a gas station. Cents of difference and i have the power to do it for free if i wanted. I promised i would avoid him of all costs, my colleage marked his face and said every time he comes here, i didn't have to interact with him, only call her. I thanked her and tried to forget his outburst of my mind. 
After this episode i've seen him more regulally at the store, always drinking a small coffee and sometimes i catched him looking at the food service area, sometimes watching me. I tried to forget it, i was just one bad day and i have to be a professional. I managed to stay away of him and my colleages did get out of their way to serve him. One time i had a really strange feeling when he simply tells his order to my colleage and i was by her side doing another order, he looked at me again, smirked and headed to the table. She looked at me and just said: ""that was very odd"" and went do his order, that day he stared at me for at least 10 minutes. 
The last five days he came and today my friend from the kitchen told me when he arrives, the first thing he do is search for me with his eyes. Always with and odd attitude.
Today it was a slow day and i was cleaning some shelves and he entered the store and stood unconfortable close to me while he orders some bread and i was cleaning a shelve that stoods in front of the food service area. I picked some random item to print the price label and get away from him and he walks a bit looking at others shelves and distancing from where i was. I printed the label and when i was gettting back in what i was doing he did get close to me again. 
I know i sound really crazy and paranoid but, two of my friends said he is really strange and they saw what just happened. I have a gut feeling, something i can't explain, that he is dangerous. 
I hope i am just wrong, but this is making me a bit anxious and unconfortable.",1,1747627662.0,TrueOffMyChest,3,1.0,False
1kq2pb6,https://i.redd.it/fhs9giovxn1f1.jpeg,[Resurrected] Spilled sweet coffee on my Logitech G513 Carbon (Brown)… and brought it back to life 🎉,"**(Little messed up spacebar,** ***I know*****)**  
  
So yeah. I **f\*cked** up.  
Some weeks ago I accidentally spilled **coffee with milk** ***and*** **sugar** all over my Logitech G513 Carbon (Brown) — my daily driver and not exactly a cheap one. Instant panic. I immediately disconnected it, turned it upside down to let it drip, and started taking off the keycaps.  


**Things I did next:**

* Removed all the keycaps and placed them aside (cleaned them thoroughly later).
* Disassembled the keyboard slowly, but encountered **stripped screws**.
* Had to use **rubber bands, WD-40-alike, q-tips**, and all kinds of weird techniques to get them out. Finally succeeded.
* Found **caramelized sugar** gunk inside some switches. It looked like a war zone made of syrup and despair.
* Asked around, got some weird advice (some guy from IFIX said to brush it with soap and water lol), but stuck to **isopropyl alcohol** and **compressed air**.
* Cleaned the switches one by one. Some were stiff af, others sticky. Took hours.
* Left everything to dry for hours (like 10+ hours), reassembled it slowly and skipped reinstalling the stripped screws (might replace them later).

**Current status:**  
✔ It powers on, rgb is a liiiitttle dimmer but nothing big.  
✔ Every single key works.  
✔ The typing feel is back to 100%.  
✔ I am still in disbelief.

# Lessons learned:

* Sugar is evil.
* Always disconnect fast and **don’t panic** (well, panic a little).
* Isopropyl alcohol = your best friend.
* Keyboard surgery is totally possible if you're careful and patient.
* Screw extractors are underrated gods.

## What counts as a dupe?

* A perfume that smells ""just like"" another perfume - whether discontinued or priced out of budget

  * Example: ""looking for a dupe of BR540 Extrait, but without the price tag""

  * Example: ""something that smells ***just like*** Coffee Break, but lasts longer""

  * Example: “a dupe for the discontinued Elizabeth & James Nirvana Black”

 * A perfume version of **any product**: body sprays, hair products, lotions / creams, skin care, candles, candy / sweets, makeup, etc.


## How it works:

Share as many details as possible that might be helpful in identifying the dupe you're after: a picture, notes or scent profile, your general geographic location, budget, etc. Please do a quick search of the sub before adding your request, even if you think it would be unusual.

Please remember that this is a global sub with quite a bit of volume, so a response may take time. This thread refreshes weekly on Mondays at 05:00 UTC, so keep that in mind when posting.

*If you're looking for perfumes with a similar vibe of another perfume, but not dupes, you can post directly to the main feed.*",1,1747627412.0,Perfumes,1,1.0,False

Demographics?,"Currently living in DTLA — it was cool for the first year, but the past year it’s gone way downhill. I love being in a walkable area where I can grab a coffee, walk my dog, and just feel safe in general. I’m also trying to get closer to the beach so I can pop over a few times a week, but I still love that city energy (if that makes sense?).

Recently out of a relationship, so I’m definitely looking to meet new people and build community — ideally somewhere with folks in their late 20s to mid 30s. Would especially love to be in an area where there are more Black men (just being real here!). Also not trying to spend an absurd amount on rent anymore — I want something decent and within budget, not luxury high-rise prices. ideally would like something under $2600 but as spacious as possible (at least 700sq feet with good closet space)

Curious what people think of the Palms area? I’m looking at a few spots — one close to downtown Culver (clarington) and another on the opposite end near the 10 (woodclife). Any pros/cons I should know? Is it walkable, safe, dog-friendly, good for dating/social life, etc.? Open to any recs or neighborhoods y’all think fit my vibe!

I've always been a light sleeper; the quietest of door knobs or even 1 cm of loose ends in my curtains wake me up. I've had sleep anxiety since my early teens. I would not be able to sleep before exams then. But since I turned 19/20 my sleep cycle changed and presented newer problems. I sometimes lie awake for 3-4 hours. At 19, I had a phase where I would lie in bed at 11 pm and not be able to sleep till 7 am or later witj my heart racing inside my chest. I've had a total of 3 panic attacks (not recent, 2 in 2020 and one in 2023) during which I puked and my hands and feet turned numb.

I'm at home for 5 months now, I don't have anything to do. I stay awake EVERYDAY for 3-4 hours in bed. I dont yuse my phone or any screens after 12 am. I wake up tired, waste my time and I can't be productive. Seems like days go by too fast. I however, have a job offer in my hand and have to join work in July. It will be a 9 to 6 grind with an IT company that is hard on its freshers. I'm afraid I will not be able to keep up and will be exhausted and pay the price for it at work. Forgot to mention, I'm also in a long distance relationship with a boy I met in college.

I am agnostic, slightly pessimistic about life and feel like it's worthless in a cynical way; I'm not suicidal or anything. I feel slow in general. I feel like I'm a nobody sometimes. I'm also a maladaptive day dreamer and have focus issues. My dad told me in my teen years that he feels I have ADHD but I never got diagnosed or took tests for it. I was a bright student after all. It all crashed right in front of my eyes as soon as I entered the covid state and college thereafter.

I don't drink coffee, tea, alcohol and neither do I smoke. The only medicine I take is an occasional multivitamin and anti-allergant 3 times a week for my dust allergies (i dont even know if i have a dust allergy. I take it as a placebo just to be safe). I get itchy at night and it distracts me from sleeping. Few times, I have restless arms or legs and jolt myself awake when I'm almost asleep.

What I'm wondering now is do I need professional help? The issue is that I'm only self motivated and I don't think anybody can talk me into anything. I don't think a psychologist can make my mood right or fix my anxiety. He can only prescribe me anxiety meds that I feel would help me. But do I need meds? 

My parents have taken me to a psychologist once  and I didn't have any problems then. They took me for no reason - maybe to get me 'checked'. He was old and not very proficient.
My parents are overly concerned about mental health (not in a good way) since there have been cases of depression in my family. Of something happens to be wrong with me, they will stress excessively and for them, it will be a matter of shame too. They are parents who pretend to be liberal but are conservative and I'm afraid they'd take away my freedom if they know that I have something wrong. That is not a problem now since I'm moving out for my job.

Tldr : Should I seek professional health? Would it be expensive?

I’ve been wondering if I should quietly take some extra laxatives or just let whatever happens happen. I just don’t want to have to do this all over again. 

Has anyone else experienced the still dark poop after the first half bottle? Is it because I’ve been drinking black coffee? It’s allowed on the list, but I’m unsure.

1kq2fee,https://www.reddit.com/r/ExtremeHorrorLit/comments/1kq2fee/melted_away/,Melted Away,"Randy flipped the switch behind the counter and watched the overhead lights flicker twice before humming to life. *Stillmark Gas & Mart, 6:58 AM*. A new pot of coffee sputtered behind him, already burning.

He rubbed the back of his neck. Felt like he hadn’t slept, but he couldn’t remember why. Just this vague ache between the eyes. He bent down to restock the cigarette shelf and froze. There was already a full row in every slot. Perfectly aligned.

He stood up slowly, eyeing the register clock. *7:01*. The time felt too neat. No ticking, no movement, just fixed digits. He blinked.

*7:00.*

The bell above the door jingled. August Wynn stepped in, hands in his coat pockets, eyes a little red. Randy smiled automatically.

“Mornin’, boss. Coffee’s fresh.”

August didn’t say anything at first. He walked slowly down the nearest aisle, his coat sleeve trailing across the chip bags without disruption. Randy watched him pause by the dairy case, open it, then close it again.

“Hey,” August finally said, frowning. “You good today?”

“Sure,” Randy said. Then again: “It’s a fine morning, boss. Coffee’s fresh.” A chill crawled up the back of his throat.

August raised an eyebrow. “You just said that.”

Randy laughed a little too loudly. “Sorry. Long night.” August gave him a look but didn’t press, then excused himself to the bathroom.

Randy exhaled, rubbing his face. The overhead speaker played something low and warbled. He thought it might be a hymn, but the words were smeared. He looked around, feeling like the store was too clean. The shelves were perfectly faced, the jerky packages standing as soldiers on their displays. His soda machines were without blemish or stickiness. Yet, he didn’t remember cleaning any of this.

He stepped out from behind the counter and paced one lap. Every shelf was stocked, every label facing forward. The freezer hummed with unnatural consistency. No flicker, nor sputter. The whole building held its breath.

He returned to the counter and stared at the register.

*7:03.*

He looked toward the bathroom to see if August was walking out yet, then back to the register.

*7:02.*

He opened his mouth to call for August, but his throat locked. He coughed, trying again, but he couldn’t manage a sound. The light above him clicked out, wrapping him in a darkness far too complete for light of day outside. It was a canvas, smothering and unbeatable. Then, just as fast as it had left, the light came back.

He was behind the counter again, hand resting on the scanner, yet he didn’t remember moving. He looked down to the feeling of something dripping onto his wrist. He saw a dot of black. Just for a moment, then it was gone.

The bell above the door jingled again. A woman entered. She wore sunglasses, even though it was still early. She walked past him like he wasn’t there.

Randy turned to speak, but the words didn’t come. The woman addressed the counter.

“Morning, Rylan,” she said.

He turned slowly, noticing for the first time that someone else was behind the register.

A man. Middle-aged and wearing the same uniform, same name tag. Smiling.

The woman paid for her coffee. The man handed her change with a polite nod.

Randy looked down at his own hands. He had none. They had puddled on the floor, and his arms were quickly following. The limbs were dripping like melted wax up to his elbows now. He could feel every part of his body losing its structure as he struggled to remain. It wasn’t painful, but the terror wouldn’t have let any pain come through anyway.

The lights buzzed, unfeeling for the lack that was growing in their presence. The hymn started again, even more warbled than before.

The bell jingled as the door closed.

Randy tried to scream, and the replacement met his eye. He gave a little wave, unfazed by the scene he was witnessing.

Before Randy’s face met the rest of the puzzle, he looked one final time at the clock on the register, he could just make it out.

Best relationship I ever had, so passionate and intimate. We both liked each other a lot and connected so well. She just broke up with me. Caught me blindsided, she had some issues with me not “opening up to her” about some things I was dealing with. The two main issues she had was she hadn’t met my parents yet (yes 3 months is still pretty new) but her argument was I already knew hers from early on. And she said she knew I was going through something but didn’t know what until I finally did open up about the complications with my mom’s cancer. She felt horrible for me, but tried to say this whole time she involved me with every aspect of her life and this whole time I left her in the dark. She felt like I was hiding something. I explained that I’m slow to fully trust anymore, I used to put blind trust in people early in the past and it’s always backfired. I told her I’d bring her home to meet the folks and assured her I had nothing to hide. My friends take on this was that she sounds manipulative but I really didn’t get that impression (being in the full context) yeah I did have some fault in all of this and I realize it now. A week later she broke up with me. She said she needs to work on getting over some problems from her past and needed to be alone. She said I needed to work on things too. She mentioned that she does “really really like me” and that I make her so happy but she just “can’t do this right now” when we broke up we talked for 3 hours. It was a very emotional conversation, we both heard each other. Neither of us got mad or lost our cool. We even shared a few laughs. She left it at, “Not never but not now, maybe we can try being friends and ease back into things after I have some time to myself” 
When she left we exchanged a very long hug. 

To clarify I am 95% positive she is not going to be talking to or entertaining other men during this time but I did not ask. I am going to give her some space in the hopes that she soon comes around and reaches out. I truly believe we moved too fast and things got real fast and it scared her.

She even went as far as to say I can still txt or call when I’m having a bad day and she doesn’t want me out of her life. 

I’m still just confused about the whole situation but I understood her well and I somewhat understand why she feels the way she does… I just would have though she’d try to work through things together with how well we connected.

The coffee here is flavourful and robust. Even coffee from a hole in the wall coffee shop is better than most of the expensive Canadian coffee shops. It’s just one of the things that Korea does better and I will surely miss it when my trip is over.

Usually a laptop. It confuses me because wouldn't they have access to a computer if their job requires it? If your job has to on a computer most of the time like an office job, wouldn't they want to lock you down onto a secure network with a computer that couldn't download anything for safety? So why would you be commuting with a laptop? For independent creators, they have powerful workstations for video editing and recording. So why would you have a laptop? Not only that, if you're an independent creator, you have nowhere to commute *to.* Your house is your office, so if you go somewhere else it's not always going to be work related, so why carry your laptop? I don't make YouTube videos, so I genuinely don't know why they do this. There has to be a reason why, why would *so many* YouTubers talk about how they carry a laptop or go to a coffee shop, or how they commute to places, if they don't have a reason for it? There has to be a reason why laptops are so popular, but what is it?

Backpacks, I can understand a bit more. They're ultimately a preference, and people will prefer one thing over another. I'm more of a messenger bag person because backpacks remind me of being in grade school, and I feel like they're too bulky and easy to bump into things. However, it has it's pros. Even weight distribution, the weight is close to your body, lots of space, among other things. But it seems like *everyone* has a backpack. Is there a trend I missed?

1kq1xzi,https://www.reddit.com/r/spirituality/comments/1kq1xzi/tension/,Tension,"Can anyone that practices spirituality help me? 
So I’ve been with my partner for 13yrs, in the beginning of our relationship I used to have a semi good relationship with my partners sister.

she always plays the assertive big sister role, She’s the middle child and only girl. 
I grew up with a big sister so I’m used to bickering, fighting essentially everything sisters do. Also I’m an empath so I know what someone is feeling emotionally. 
I noticed there are times when she is rather rude but in a passive way where only I can feel it and no one els. 

I mention it to my partner but he brushes it off and says she’s always been the pushy dominant type and I should just ignore her. 
But see the issue here is I have an Aries, adhd big sister and boy do we go off on each other about boundaries, I am very reserved and quiet so even she gets mad when I stay quiet and take the hit. 

So lately she’s been on a spiritual journey and she’s been practicing on séances which is great! But I too know a bit on spirituality, and I know that once you cleanse yourself and put barriers to protect yourself from bad energy the no good people around you deter.

So my question is lately we’ve had really intense tension between us and lately her attitude and her way of talking to me has been getting out of hand that my partner has noticed. To the point where I cannot stand her anymore and I snap back. 

Is this me? Am I her bad energy surrounding her and it’s tearing us apart? I genuinely want to confront her and ask what is her problem but I know she wouldn’t take it with an open mind. 

Here’s an example of our encounters, I get home late at night from a full shift. My partner who was waiting at home for me tells me get ready! We’re going out to Starbucks and then target. (We’re not much of a target and Starbucks fan) so I was confused and asked why there? what is going on at target? And isn’t it too late to buy coffee? 
He then says his sister invited “US” I immediately raised an eyebrow and said us? Are you sure? He then says yes! So hurry she’s waiting and asked what drink do you like from Starbucks. I looked at him and said it’s honestly too late to order a drink so I’ll pass. 
so he goes I’m telling her to get us a dragonfruit drink. 
Ok so we head over to target and she hasn’t arrived because she went to Starbucks first. So we waited by the entrance towards the $5 items and he’s looking at the items and I was freezing so I stood by the entrance. She arrives with her daughter and I wave she continues walking and I tell my partner she’s here. He peeks out from the aisles and she notices him stops and looks at me and starts to laugh “omg I didn’t see you!” I brush it off and start to hug in greeting with her daughter. She hands the Starbucks drink to my partner and says “this is awkward, I didn’t know you were also coming so I only got one drink.” I looked at him and say “I didn’t know I wasn’t included, sorry.” She doesn’t respond but my parter did saying “what are you talking about wherever I go she goes we are a package deal.” It gets awkward so HER 6yr old DAUGHTER TAKES INITIATIVE GRABS MY HAND AND SAYS ITS OK MY MOM CAN GO WITH HIM AND WE CAN SHOP TOGETHER.
Mind you I want to give her the benefit of the doubt cause she is truly a hearty person she has done good deeds especially for us mostly my partner and I am grateful so I usually brush it off but I also don’t find it ok to continue receiving this behavior, it’s draining.

""ang cute ni brent with mika, para siyang baby unlike when with other hms na madalas very kuya siya"" - menties said

oo nga no? we see him taking care of the housemates and being kuya sa lahat. they way he takes care of them, pinagbabawalan niya ang housemates sa mga bagay that would cause them harm, laging nakaalalay kapag may sakit mga hms, susubuan ang hms para makakain lang kahit sobrang busy sa task. sabi nga ni dustin, he leads them.

but who takes care of brent? 

kapag hindi siya okay, kapag siya yung may sakit, kapag siya yung may kailangan like egg, coffee, katinko, ulam, water and etc. who scold him when he's not taking care of himself? sinong sumasalo sa hindi niya kayang gawin? — si mika

madalas siya magparaya for other hms tapos si mika madalas magparaya for brent. the eggs were initially all for brent until other's asked for it and they started to use it as bet. her gentle assurance when brent was so pressured as a task leader, her bringing his jug after a tiring task practice without him asking but you can see how thirsty he was already, her little ways of asking brent if he's okay — appear, thumbs up, gentle back rubs, her words of affirmations for brent, she always lowkey compliments him, remember that ""you're doing great"" after pares task? her cutting the meat for brent because he have a phobia with blood, her making him coffee, her scolding him ""tapos lumabas ka pa ang init init"", her getting katinko for brent without him asking, her feeding him with champorado when he was sick, her scolding him for not taking his meds properly, her sharing her food with him. her taking the initiative to nominate which made brent feel at ease, her hyping and goofing around him when brent was obviously spacing out during the pares task, her standing up for brent whenever no one's doing it for him even if she's usually shy and quiet when it comes to those matters, and her letting him join her in her quiet and alone time. 

she does all that and more.

madalas si brent magpahiram sa other hms ng gamit niya pero si mika nagpapahiram kay brent ng mga gamit na inaadmire niya like the cartier bracelet, the earings, the ring, the bandana — she let him experience all those things. 

most especially, it was mika who heard brent in his silence. she just get him, she understand him. the way she describe him as ""pinaka nagpapakatotoo"" with her reasons,  you will know that she see him despite of being labeled as 'invisible' and despite of us thinking as if she wasn't interested when he's initiating a conversation. 

no wonder brent always find his way to come close with her especially when his battery run low. he knows he can be quiet and not worry that he might be misinterpreted. no wonder its always as if he's asking validations from mika— it's not because he's fishing compliments or attention from her— it's because he knows that when it's from her, it's real and genuine. something that he can hold on to believe. valid assurance from a person who see him from within.

# What is Zolt?

Zolt is a health and fitness app to help you track and achieve your ideal body. The vision of Zolt is to be a coach and partner to your fitness, whether you're running a marathon, trying to cut fat, are a hybrid athlete, or are just trying to stay fit during stressful times.

**Zolt is about living life with energy to reach your maximum potential.**

To do that, each dimension of your health matters: your sleep, activity, nutrition, lifestyle, and physiology. They're all related and keeping these things in check makes sure you can live with maximum energy to do the things you want to do. Zolt's goal is to be holistic, and over time, you'll see how Zolt Coach will bring each of these things together for true understanding of your body, health, and fitness.

Furthermore, in terms of functionality, there are three guiding principles of the app:

* **Track** \- Log your health/fitness/body data across nutrition, sleep, activity, and habits
* **Understand** \- Get personalized insights through adaptive algorithms and scoring
* **Achieve** \- Achieve your goals with data-driven recommendations and progress tracking

Each new feature of Zolt falls under one of those three categories. But, part of Zolt's vision also means making Zolt accessible to as many people as possible.

Zolt has a generous free tier and a competitive paid tier.

The free tier will work for many people. The core features are free, like dynamic TDEE tracking and sleep/activity/recovery scores.

The paid tier is for those who want the extra - those committed to tracking, understanding, and achieving. These include more food logging features (incl. AI search, nutrition label scanning, etc), historical TDEE data, pattern analysis, sleep debt, goal/habit stacking, journal insights, and Zolt's coaching features. Or if you just want to support Zolt's development, which is less than a coffee a month (yes, I know this is cliche). Even so, I hope Zolt is very competitively priced to the point where it feels like a no-brainer about the value received. The end goal is for everyone with a wearable to have Zolt, whether its the free or paid version, because I want the **value it provides to be undeniable.**

This is just Zolt's rookie year. The job's nowhere even close to finished. There's still a LOT coming and I hope you'll join Zolt on it's journey to become an All-Star, and hopefully a Hall of Famer when everything is said and done.

Thank you to everyone who has supported Zolt so far. It's truly been invaluable. Here's to **living with energy.** ⚡️",3,1747624606.0,ZoltHealth,0,1.0,False

I have been on a rollercoaster of a health journey over the past 3 years… but am FINALLY starting to feel better, but still have some issues and wanted some insight. 

I am currently on 125 mg of Sertraline for anxiety that I think is generational 🥲 and my PCP has me on medication for low T3. 

Back in December, my TSH was 1.7, Free T4 was 1.07, and my Free T3 was 2.6. Antibodies were tested and came back negative for Hashimotos. 
My PCP started me on Liothyronine, got retested recently, and it ABSOLUTELY tanked my Free T4. 

I am now on 30 mg of NP Thyroid. 

I just have a few questions: 

1. I start off most Mondays feeling great, but by Friday my mood is so off (intrusive thoughts, feelings of masculinity, feeling tension in my gut, etc). Does this just mean that I need more thyroid medication? Or would this have to do more with my anxiety medication? My doctor is retesting my thyroid in 4 weeks! I also know that being an elementary music teacher and dealing with that stress probably doesn’t help either 😬 

2. I struggle so badly if I drink any coffee (even if it is decaf), have ANY caffeine (I get so angry and feel irrational), or any alcohol (feel SO bad the next day - so much stress/anxiety/irritability). Are these things that will improve once my T3 is in optimal range? Or are these more related to my anxiety? 


My doctor also prescribed 100 mg of oral progesterone to help with the mood disorder and I noticed that I was more “calm” feeling and able to tolerate the caffeine and alcohol better, but I could NOT deal with the constipation/bloating that came with taking this, so I stopped. 

I just have a hard time being patient for these things to resolve and am hoping that I will not have to cut out coffee/alcohol forever, but would love to hear if people have any it made a big difference?? Any advice is greatly appreciated!

I grew up with a lot of ppl calling me ugly. then other ppl telling me I should model (tall & skinny). Sometimes ppl would tell me I have a very exotic (im white lol) or unique beauty. Left me quite insecure and conflicted about my looks. It also led to me being overly nice to people so I don't get attacked and called ugly. Im very nice to strangers. But im cautious and a bit reserved/aloof around peers and female friends as they are usually the ones who treated me poorly and berated me in the past. A lot of subtle insults or backhanded compliments. Its complicated I guess.

As I have gotten older I notice ppl are super nice to me, I have a very innocent looking face and am definitely very ""cute"", I dunno about pretty. Men tell me Im pretty a lot, approach me at the grocery store, ask for my number etc. Roughly once every couple months. but women ie friends of mine usually talk to me and insinuate that Im not pretty (indirectly) like while talking about dating and stuff. My female friends compliment my one friend and say how pretty she is, but the compliments I get from them is that im nice and caring.  Occasionally either men or older women will stop me and tell me im beautiful. I get asked out a lot but have a hard time keeping a guy, tbh. They tend to just want me for casual, it seems. Which Im not into.

Out in the world, I do notice a lot of positives. Free drinks from bartenders all night, random guys paying for my drinks, or mine and my friends drinks if its a sit down place and they hear its my birthday or something, free coffees at shops, getting hired on the spot if i go in person, free food/discounts at restaurants bc the server liked me, people always remember my face, not being charged late penalties and stuff, and the other day I went to a gym where I cancelled my membership a long time ago but I asked to buy a day pass which I confirmed by email was 30 dollars, but the guy at the desk told me to just use the gym for free.

I do think im cute enough, but I don't think I am conventionally all that pretty. If anything maybe I appeal to men but not as much women. Is it possible that the fact Im kind and have a face that looks ""nice"" and am genuinely a nice person and super polite and ppl can feel my aura, giving me extra privilege in society?

For instance my brother has a similar temperament and I notice strangers treat him well too. I think that getting free stuff is not always down to pretty privilege. And as someone who works in social services, primarily dealing w ppl who are NOT happy, I am a lot more likely to go above & beyond for people I just met who meet me with politeness, respect and a smile. Its not about if theyre hot. Just food for thought but im curious as to your guys opinions as well.",1,1747623579.0,prettyprivilege,1,1.0,False

**Boring Tools. Wild Traffic.**

You’ve probably heard of these sites:

* [TimeandDate.com](https://www.timeanddate.com/)
* [PercentageCalculator.net](https://www.percentagecalculator.net/)
* [InchCalculator.com](https://www.inchcalculator.com/)

They get *insane* traffic — we’re talking **millions of visits a month**, all from Google.

These sites are dead simple.
Just tools. Just calculators. Just solving one problem really well.

And they don’t require:

* A team of 10 engineers
* VC money
* A mobile app
* A login system
* Or even daily maintenance

Most you could build in 1 prompt. 

They quietly print cash from ads, affiliates, or upgrades.

**Some ideas you could build next:**

* **Loan vs. Lease Calculator** – Compare cost of buying vs. leasing a car
* **BMI + Calorie Need Estimator** – Basic health input, no login, instant output
* **Freelancer Hourly Rate Calculator** – Input desired income, output ideal hourly rate
* **Early Retirement Calculator** – Visualize your retirement date based on savings rate
* **Split Rent + Utilities Tool** – Help roommates divide bills fairly
* **“How Much Can I Afford?” Tool** – For first-time homebuyers
* **Domain Value Estimator** – Estimate the worth of any domain name
* **Net Worth Tracker** – Simple version with download/export
* **Caffeine Calculator** – How much coffee is too much today?
* **Time Zone Converter for Remote Teams** – Save zones + team names, auto updates

None of these require advanced AI or huge builds.
Just useful logic, fast pages, and good SEO.

You just need to make something people *search* for.**

I’m a stay at home mom with a big dream: starting a small coffee business from home.
This dream means everything to me 
it's more than a business idea; it's a piece of who l am.

I’ve been working with what I have and pouring love into every cup, practicing daily but now I’m hoping to take the next big step. 

I'm not in a position to afford brand-new equipment, but I'm hopeful that the right path will open up through kindness and connection. I'm looking for a used commercial espresso machine, grinder, or any café equipment that someone might be willing to sell at an affordable price in the area. 

I know it's a big ask, but I also believe in starting where I am, with what I have, and trusting that my work ethic and dedication will carry me forward. If you know of any local businesses upgrading their equipment or even anyone willing to part with something they're no longer using that could be helpful to me, I would be so incredibly grateful. Even guidance or a nudge in the right direction will mean the world!

Thank you for reading this, and for supporting small beginnings filled with big dreams

I don’t care about changing initials because I truly hope you see this, even though I know you won’t. There is so much I wish I could tell you, I wouldn’t even know where to start. How could I tell you what I feel for you? I don’t even think we’ve been in a room alone for more than five minutes. I don’t know your favorite color. I don’t know what scares you, i don’t know your favorite food, who you talk to the most, I don’t know anything about you, still, I feel like I know you inside out. 

I see you. You see me. I know you do. I can feel it, and I always could. You have the kindest eyes I have ever seen. You have a smile that makes me want to stare at your face forever and smile right back. I genuinely do not understand how you aren’t chased by fifteen different women at all times. You are the safest man I know of, and, again - I barely know you! I don’t know you, but I feel like we have known each other forever. I don’t know you, but I truly know you are a good person. When I was twelve, I used to scroll online, read romantic quotes, make up stupid scenarios about me and my stupid crushes. I do the same to you. If only you knew how many nights I’ve been wanting nothing more than to lay in your arms. We wouldn’t have to talk. Our eyes would communicate in their own language. I don’t think you’d ever dare to kiss me. Still, we would end up kissing - I’d cross my own fears to make up for all the lost time, it’s only fair. One of the many things I read online as a twelve year old was “Whatever our souls are made of, his and mine are the same”. Cheesy as hell (not in the context of the book, of course!), and also exactly how I feel about us. We are the same. It terrifies me. You make me feel like I’m twelve again.

I don’t know how you feel about me. Recently I’ve been wondering whether you’re trying to signal something. You do not understand what your love would mean to me and I did not sleep a minute last night. The idea that you could be longing for me, even just a little, brought me perhaps the most joy I’ve felt so far in my short 20 years. Maybe I’m not completely delusional, maybe you too see how we just might be perfect for each other. At the same time, my heart aches. We don’t have the time to find out. It’s my fault, again. 

I wish you knew how I felt without me having to tell you. I want you to know how beautiful you are. You are so stunning. How I have never wanted anyone in the way I want you. How I have never genuinely enjoyed the presence of a person as much as yours. How reassuring it was to have you there, more reassuring than the person that should’ve been my comfort. I wish I could tell you how I was longing for you before I got with him. I wish I could tell you how complicated the foundations of me and his relationship was. I wish I could explain to you why I stayed for so long, although I don’t think even I know the complete answer to that. What I do know is that it was a pathetic choice, one that I will regret probably for as long as I breathe. While it lasted, I thought I could shut our connection off. When that didn’t work, I tried to redirect it. Twist it and shape it into whatever I could which did not involve me in dishonesty. That worked for a while. And when it didn’t, I shut down. I couldn’t really escape you - not in my thoughts, not in my heart, not in your apartment. I felt so ashamed, which was well-deserved. I am not trying to justify that. 

You asked me if I missed the city after Christmas break. I told you I did not. Last Christmas, I went home with the intention of making up my mind about leaving him. But really, I had already made up my mind. The possibility of getting together with you was never a factor in that - I thought it impossible after the choice I made two years ago. I would not want to hurt him (even though he has hurt me), and I know you wouldn’t either. I told my friend that I think I like you because you’re the type of person who wouldn’t get with his friend’s ex girlfriend. Ironic, right? I just could not bear the guilt. My mind was made up, yet I knew I could not be completely honest with him. That would have served no purpose, it would have made him resent you, it would have made me hate myself. 

Now, I’m not saying me and him ended purely because of my feelings for you, far from it. Our relationship was full of holes. Of broken trust, different values and a lack of genuine attraction, I believe. He would give you some entirely different answer if you asked. I wonder if you ever asked. I doubt it. I loved him, but I did not like him. Sometimes I think he got with me to prove to himself that he could. I didn’t think he could. I didn’t want him to, not in the beginning. He never really gave me an option. I wish I could explain it all to you. I think you think that he broke up with me. And he did, kind of, though I was going to end it either way. I don’t think he is mature enough to truly love anyone just yet, not in a romantic sense- maybe I’m just a bit bitter, I don’t know. I think I was trying to fix him in that sense, just as I tried to fix many of his other problems. I know that was never my job. I am quite the devout lover, whether romantic or platonic, that much I know, and it unfortunately led me to tolerate things I should not have. I did not respect myself enough at the time to realize many of these things. I tried to forgive him for the things he had done, and I really, truly wanted to. But I ultimately could not. 

I do think you feel something for me. I don’t know exactly what, how much, or since when. But I hope I am interpreting the signals right, even if they weren’t intentionally put there for me to interpret. They probably weren’t. If they were, you would’ve reached out more often, I tell myself. I’ve thought about asking you to meet me for coffee, just as friends, just before I leave this city for good. But I don’t know what the point would be. I would enjoy your presence, I think you would enjoy mine, and we would have a couple of hours just to ourselves, for the very first time. Then I would go home and my heart would be even more full of love and admiration. Maybe the same would happen to you, maybe the opposite would, I do not know. Still, it would not change anything. If we mentioned everything that’s been under the surface, there would be no going back from that, and still I would be leaving. My own choice hurts more than I can put into words. I considered staying, only to realize it would mostly be for you - for an unlikely, complicated, maybe-possibly-there-chance of you: I can’t do that to myself, as I would likely break my own heart. This way, it’s not broken. It’s just reserved for you for some time, just in case you would end up where I do. I like to think that we’ll meet again under different circumstances in a few years. Not too many, that I could not bear. I hope to get lucky enough to meet you again, this time not as someone’s something, just as my own person. 
I hope you’ll be single, and if not, it’s karma, only fair, though I do not know how I would cope. I hope you have not had feelings for me all this time. I don’t want to have been one who hurts you, although unintentionally. If I have, I am really, truly sorry. 

I have learned a lot of things these past two years. And I have decided that I will never enter a relationship with someone I don’t like as much as I like you. You set my new, much-needed standard.  I know how irrational it is to say that I love you. Still, you’ve carved yourself deep into my heart in ways I did not expect, and calling it anything other than love feels laughable to me. I love everything I know about you. I need to find out more about you; either to disprove the feelings of my heart, or to open it to you in its entirety. I really, really hope we meet again. Dear GOD I hope we meet again. 


- your friend (I hope you still consider me that), A :’)

1300 calories per day (I was eating around 900  until about 6 or so weeks ago, but was told by a nutritionist that I needed to increase to 1300-1450). I eat approximately 180g of protein eat day.

I recently tried not eating any solids and just drinking Owyn nutritional shakes (vegan, GF) for every meal. I do take Creon with every meal/snack. I started adding macrobars for lunch (vegan GF protein bars) and felt okay with that, but still the awful poops continue.

What I do know is that it was a pathetic choice, one that I will regret probably for as long as I breathe. While it lasted, I thought I could shut our connection off. When that didn’t work, I tried to redirect it. Twist it and shape it into whatever I could which did not involve me in dishonesty. That worked for a while. And when it didn’t, I shut down. I couldn’t really escape you - not in my thoughts, not in my heart, not in your apartment. I felt so ashamed, which was well-deserved. I am not trying to justify that. 

You asked me if I missed the city after Christmas break. I told you I did not. Last Christmas, I went home with the intention of making up my mind about leaving him. But really, I had already made up my mind. The possibility of getting together with you was never a factor in that - I thought it impossible after the choice I made two years ago. I would not want to hurt him (even though he has hurt me), and I know you wouldn’t either. I told my friend that I think I like you because you’re the type of person who wouldn’t get with his friend’s ex girlfriend. Ironic, right? I just could not bear the guilt. My mind was made up, yet I knew I could not be completely honest with him. That would have served no purpose, it would have made him resent you, it would have made me hate myself. 

Now, I’m not saying me and him ended purely because of my feelings for you, far from it. Our relationship was full of holes. Of broken trust, different values and a lack of genuine attraction, I believe. He would give you some entirely different answer if you asked. I wonder if you ever asked. I doubt it. I loved him, but I did not like him. Sometimes I think he got with me to prove to himself that he could. I didn’t think he could. I didn’t want him to, not in the beginning. He never really gave me an option. I wish I could explain it all to you. I think you think that he broke up with me. And he did, kind of, though I was going to end it either way. I don’t think he is mature enough to truly love anyone just yet, not in a romantic sense- maybe I’m just a bit bitter, I don’t know. I think I was trying to fix him in that sense, just as I tried to fix many of his other problems. I know that was never my job. I am quite the devout lover, whether romantic or platonic, that much I know, and it unfortunately led me to tolerate things I should not have. I did not respect myself enough at the time to realize many of these things. I tried to forgive him for the things he had done, and I really, truly wanted to. But I ultimately could not. 

I do think you feel something for me. I don’t know exactly what, how much, or since when. But I hope I am interpreting the signals right, even if they weren’t intentionally put there for me to interpret. They probably weren’t. If they were, you would’ve reached out more often, I tell myself. I’ve thought about asking you to meet me for coffee, just as friends, just before I leave this city for good. But I don’t know what the point would be. I would enjoy your presence, I think you would enjoy mine, and we would have a couple of hours just to ourselves, for the very first time. Then I would go home and my heart would be even more full of love and admiration. Maybe the same would happen to you, maybe the opposite would, I do not know. Still, it would not change anything. If we mentioned everything that’s been under the surface, there would be no going back from that, and still I would be leaving. My own choice hurts more than I can put into words. I considered staying, only to realize it would mostly be for you - for an unlikely, complicated, maybe-possibly-there-chance of you: I can’t do that to myself, as I would likely break my own heart. This way, it’s not broken. It’s just reserved for you for some time, just in case you would end up where I do. I like to think that we’ll meet again under different circumstances in a few years. Not too many, that I could not bear. I hope to get lucky enough to meet you again, this time not as someone’s something, just as my own person. 
I hope you’ll be single, and if not, it’s karma, only fair, though I do not know how I would cope. I hope you have not had feelings for me all this time. I don’t want to have been one who hurts you, although unintentionally. If I have, I am really, truly sorry. 

I have learned a lot of things these past two years. And I have decided that I will never enter a relationship with someone I don’t like as much as I like you. You set my new, much-needed standard.  I know how irrational it is to say that I love you. Still, you’ve carved yourself deep into my heart in ways I did not expect, and calling it anything other than love feels laughable to me. I love everything I know about you. I need to find out more about you; either to disprove the feelings of my heart, or to open it to you in its entirety. I really, really hope we meet again. Dear GOD I hope we meet again. 


- your friend (I hope you still consider me that), A :’)

Sounds familiar, right? 

Enter the magic of **AI voiceovers and automation**! 🎤✨ Imagine a world where you can pump out awesome content without breaking a sweat—or, let’s be real, putting your face on camera!

Here’s a little behind-the-scenes nugget: I used to spend hours drafting scripts, recording, and then editing like a maniac just to get a 2-minute video up. But now? My secret weapon is AI, and it’s been a total game-changer. 

Here’s how to harness that faceless power:

1. **Voiceovers Made Easy**: AI voice generators are here to save the day—seriously! Tools like Descript or Speechelo can turn your written content into polished audio. Why stress over your vocal range or accent when AI can sound pro-level at the click of a button?

2. **Automate Your Workflow**: Think “work smarter, not harder.” Use tools like Zapier or Integromat to automate your posting schedule or even to share your content on social media. Imagine sipping coffee while your content goes viral on autopilot! ☕🚀

3. **Repurposing Gold**: Take that epic blog post you spent days writing and turn it into a podcast or video. With AI voiceovers, you can record an audio version in under an hour. Now that’s what I call a content-generating powerhouse!

4. **Create a Faceless Brand**: Listen, you don’t have to be the face of your brand. Instead, craft a personality through your content. Let your AI voice do the talking while you focus on what you do best—coming up with ideas and strategies. 

5. **Data-Driven Decisions**: AI can analyze what type of content performs best for your audience. No more guessing games! Get insights from analytics tools to create what your followers really want. 

So, what’s stopping you from diving into this world? Fear of the unknown? I feel you! But think of all the time you’ll save to do… well, anything else you enjoy! 

And let’s be real—imagine telling your friends about how you automated your way to content wizardry, sipping that fancy drink you didn’t have time for before. 🍹 Who wouldn’t want to be the go-to resource for productivity hacks?

Honestly, it’s a game of leveraging what’s out there. AI is here to help, not to make you obsolete. If anything, it’s about elevating what you can do while keeping that extra hour (or three!) for life, laughing, and maybe even some binge-watching. Who truly wants to work harder when you can work **smarter**?

**General Notes**

-We got immensely lucky with the weather, stayed between 65-75 the entire time. Coming from TX as it's in the 90s was a luxury.

-The spring blooming right now in mid May was incredible. The entire city felt lush and alive with color.

-We ended up not taking a car anywhere but to and from the airport. The bike system Portland has is great with stalls nearly everywhere. As well the drivers were all so incredibly nice to cyclists, I always felt safe due to the infrastructure and people

-Every local we ran into was a kind and welcoming. Had a lot of great conversations with people about town.

-Where is everyone? I felt like we regularly were the only people hanging around town? Most mornings felt like the opening scene to 28 Days Later. Even in more dense popular areas, things felt a little empty, better than overcrowded though. As well traffic was almost non-existent. 

-When we travel we like to try a lot of food. 

-Note sure if this post belongs in r/askportland, feel free to shoo me over there if so.

* Thursday
 * Land at PDX pretty late grabbed a drink and some bread at **Someday** (incredible candle lit vibes and an almost vacant bar) then went straight to bed.

*  Friday
 * Woke up and walked over to **Fried Egg I'm In Love** (quintessential greasy egg sammie experience, had fun decoding all the puns on the menu. The hash brown bite felt like an elevated McD's hash. Delicious, gave me horrible breath). 
 * Hoped on Biketown bikes and went all the way to **Washington Park** and putzed around the test **rose garden**, then hopped on the loop bus to the vet memorial to hit the trails. Went through the **redwood trail** and made our way to the Japanese Garden via Wildwood. Incredible hike, and 80% downhill thanks to the shuttle. The redwood deck lookout was notable.
 * Hoped on bikes and went to **Powell's main location**, been here before, always a treat. Bought like 5 books, whoops. Used prices are actually really good.
 * Cross the water and went to **Champagne Poetry** for a treat (had the jiggly pancakes, the novelty was worth it, they really do jiggle. There's probably 'better' pastry spots in town, but this was really fun)
 * Hung out at the AirBnb again then hopped on bikes and went over to **Ken's Artisan Pizza** (I'm a big fan of Ken Forkish so coming here was sort of a pilgrimage. Made sure to get there at 4pm for 5pm open and holy cow y'all were not joking about the line, it wrapped around the block. Luckily we were 2nd, met a friendly local author and his family in line and made the hour breeze by. Pizza was incredible as expected, big nod to the mortadella pizza) Then made our way downtown for a show at **Arlene Schnitzer**  (beautiful venue that was well set up). 
 * Left the venue and onto **Voysey** (great 'speakeasy' bar, drinks were solid and decor was fun to end the night at. Also the playlist was top notch, I was constantly pulling out my phone to get a song title). Went back to AirBnb to crash.

* Saturday
 * Got up and walked over to **Tabor Bread**  (loved the lox bagel I got and the other treats on offer. The neighborhood obviously loves this spot cause there's a line out the door). Then walked a block over to **Kind Coffee** (delicious coffee and probably the best cannoli I'll have of my life. Also the person running the cart was a riot). 
 * We were debating going to hike around Tabor but decided we'd make today a shopping day. Walked up and down Hawthorne and hit a few boutiques, **The Perfume House**  was a fun surprise to stumble into. 
 * We wanted to try **Jinju Patisserie** but it was closing soon. Hopped on bikes and raced over. Don't recommend going 30 min. before close as most everything was picked over, but the tarts we got were delicious nonetheless. 
 * Walked up and down Mississippi St and window shopped, **Paxton Gate**'s selection of oddities was awesome. Grabbed a drink and some fries at **Victoria Bar** (could spend an afternoon here, the parm fries were awesome).
 * Got on bikes again and went to **Broadway Books** (lovely bookstore with a good kids section. The shopkeeps were really helpful and fun. Then went onto **Wedgehead** (legendary pinball bar, only could spend an hour but holy hell this place is my dream. Recommend for anyone remotely interested in a good time. Then wristband / unlimited play at their machines was a lot of fun with some strong cocktails)
 * Biked all the way over to **Coquine** (5/5 restaurant. Wife and I visited a handful of years ago and we still regularly talked about the meal we had then. It did not disappoint. I'd travel across the country again for a meal here). Then rode the huge hill down in the dark while it drizzled rain, but of us feeling fat-and-happy. Crashed at the Airbnb.

* Sunday
 * Got up and walked over to **Blue Star Donuts** (the buttermilk old fashioned was our favorite, great donuts) and grabbed coffee at **Wallflower Coffee** (friendly staff, groovy decorations, and freakishly hot coffee in a good way).
 * Grabbed a uber to the airport

Because idts this is normal???,"I had went to a cafe with my 3 female friends for a friend's bday after my classes got over and I just got late cause I wasn't able to board the local. Now this woman calls me, asks me in a high pitch tone where I'm to which I politely told her that I'll explain once I reach home.

Once I reach home (I wish I didn't), this woman just started to shout on me. I thought it was because of concern but nah, she had a fight with my dad and took frustration on me as usual.

Everything was okay until she started to shout and say ""itna time kyu lagta hai, friends ke sath hee gayi thi na and bs"" to which I in frustration said ""itna chilla kyu rahi hai? Bol aise rahi hai jaise maine kuch galat karke aaya ho."" 

And then she held this as her weapon. Shouted at me and said ""itna makeup thopkar gayi thi, muh maarne hee gaye hogi kahi toh."" Btw, the makeup I had was just an eyeliner and light lipstick cause I went out with my female friends so ig it's very normal?

I looked at her with shock while she continued to say things like ""friends ke sath hee gayi thi toh itna makeup kyu thopa, pata nahi konse chakkar chala rhi hai."" Bruh, I don't even have a bf 🙏🏻

Things get worse when she started to say things with no meaning ""teri aukat hee nahi hai kuch karne ki."" My father had enough and stopped her. She said ""isse neeche ka abhi kuch bolla nahi hai."" And my father got angry and said ""iske neeche bolne bhi nahi dunga."" And then tears started to flow through my eyes. I tried not to cry but it somehow did to the point I wasn't able to breathe. My father said ""don't cry, jaisa bhi hu, tera baap hu aur tere sath hu.""

Now I went in my room, cried, studied, did some shit and slept.
Now I woke up at morning for my class because she strictly said she ain't gonna wake me up. Didn't make my tiffin which is ok. I can't do anything. NOW! She started to shout on me and told me to make food otherwise she won't let me out and I just said ""mai kaise banau abhi? Mujhe class bhi jaana hai."" And lol, she goes like ""Padhai toh teri dikh rahi hai, kitchen ka kaam hee sikh le."" Welp I didn't eat breakfast or anything. On empty stromach with no tiffin but a heavy heart

Now as I moved out, she said ""coffee piya ya nahi."" I said nope. And she muttered ""Pata nahi itne jaldi kya karne jaati hai"" Jaldi? 😭

Dawg mera class 8 ka rehta, ab 7.30 ko na niklu? Before closing the door I just said ""dusre ladko se milne jaati hu."" And she muttered ""wohi kar sakti hai tu.""

Bhai istg, I'm in local rn, cried my way till the station. How come a mother can be like this?? I remember her telling me how she wishes I get a husband who abuses me emotionally 😭😭

Istg if I start doing things today's teens do, then she'll understand.

I know about the hack of creating links to various news sites, but again the experience on these sites can be very slow and the scrolling is horrible.

1kq10fq,https://www.reddit.com/r/IronmanTriathlon/comments/1kq10fq/port_macquarie_703_swim_cancelled_so_i_redid_the/,"Port Macquarie 70.3 Swim cancelled, so I redid the full distance 2 weeks later.","Not sure how broad a scope this subreddit is, but the swim leg of the Port Mac (NSW, Aus) got cancelled just over 2 weeks ago - it's been very rainy here, and sadly a bit too much storm runoff got into the river.

The event went ahead as a duathlon, which I participated in, but in the days following this the cancelled swim was really eating away at me, especially after the extensive training. Decided I'd do the full 70.3 distances locally, Saturday week, exactly 13 days after the original event, meaning not too much time elapses that the fitness wears off, nor is it too close that I'm still in need of more recovery.

Not that this is in any way groundbreaking stuff, but here's how I played it:  
\-I stayed in Port for just shy of a week under the event, which was complete recovery time - no exercise  
\-Got back into light exercise Mon-Thurs the following week, then did a 20 min-shakeout run Friday (day before the 70.3 redo). Got some extra carbs in on the Thurs-Fri too.  
\-Got up at 3am, 3x english muffins with jam and a coffee for brekky  
\-Started the **ride** approx. 4:30am, had an energy gel or carman's muesli bar every 20-30 mins, and had a 1L water and a 500ml electrolyte drink throughout  
\-Started the **swim** approx. 8:20am (swapped ride and swim as ain't nobody swimming open water before sunrise), had half a gatorade and a caffeinated gel before  
\-Started the **run** approx 9:30am, had a banana and half a gatorade before, then had a gel every 4km, plus had a 1.5L camelpack, as well as 2/3 of a pack of Allen's Snakes throughout

Time comparisons as follows (original 70.3 v redo 70.3):  
\-**Swim**: N/A v 2:21/100m  
\-**Bike**: 27.8km/h v 26.2km/h  
\-**Run**: 5:08/km v 5:39/km  
Impossible to know if this was an accurate reflection of how it would've looked on the day, and I guess we'll never know.

A few pointers of things you may not think of when doing an event like this on your own terms:  
\-**Motivation can be a bit lacking** when people aren't behind you. I got my family and some workmates around it, meaning they checked in, and also made it a lot more difficult to ditch.  
\-Huge huge difference **not having spectators**, volunteers, your own cheer squad, or even other competitors around. They pump you up more than you'd probably realise!  
\-**Lack of ""litter zones""**. I didn't have gels in practice rides or runs, so stashing used wrappers and holding out for a bin in this one was tough.  
\-I definitely take for granted the **closed roads** and (mostly) **cleared footpaths** during actual events, as stopping for cars and people on the footpath was a real bummer.  
\-Way too easy to **take it slower in the transition zones** when you're not in an actual competition.  
\-I usually **sleep badly** the night before an event, and this one was no different, despite it not being a ""real"" event. Clocked just over 4 hours of z's...

All of this to say, I'm stoked I went back and did it, and can now mentally tick off the distance as being done. Hope this was helpful for onlookers.

The problem is that it's making my anxiety worse. I'm becoming extremely sensitive to my routine and any distribution causes problems. Even going to a birthday party, or being called into the office, will result in a recovery day where I'm bed ridden for 24 hours. 

I went to the office for the first time in 6 months and had to leave early I was getting headaches and dizziness and the next day took off sick. 

It's strange because at 22 I lived in a martial arts dojo. I was walking up at 5:30am everyday to clean, pray. Go to uni, come back and train for 3 hours a day, living off $250/wk. It got so hot at night I slept on an icepack. Living there was hard, but all my anxiety disappeared. Even my death anxiety. I slept so soundly, and remember genuinely being at peace with death, knowing a gave the day everything I had.

Reading my story probably makes you feel some contempt for me and I don't blame you, I live a contemptable life. I believe this contributes to my anxiety, my soul is degrading, I know what I'm doing is wrong, but it's difficult to purposely make your life harder. 

I admire successful people who keep working hard, most of us dream of being wealthy so we can stop working and do whatever we want. Well, I'm not sure that's a good idea for an anxious person. 

My old sensei would tell of his teacher, who trained everyday until the day he died. ""Live hard so you can die fast"". I didn't understand that until I saw my mentor and friend die of pancreatic cancer over 6 years. That's why worse fear, imagine your last 6 years being a permanent existential panic attack, worse than the cancer itself.

When you live a hard life, death becomes a reward, and not in an edgy depressed way. You literally get to rest in peace, as you truly feel you did all you needed to do and don't need to live any longer.

I know if I don't change my ways I'm heading for the hell my friend suffered.",3,1747621727.0,Anxiety,0,1.0,False
1kq0xll,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/1kq0xll/help_me_understand_please/,Help me understand please.,"I am M/30 gf is F/22 we have been together 10 months. yes there's an age gap blah blah idc. Without disclosing too much information of hers she was in extremely abusive relationships ranging from family members all the way to her childs father who physically and emotionally abused her. Its been consistent her entire life. Shes grown to become very independent which is  awesome and I'm proud of her for that.  I'm a very affectionate man not necessarily just physically but I'll buy her cute little things I see that I think that she would like to put a smile on her face or just that simple little thing I think she would like it. In the 10 months of us being together ive spent about $1000 on different little gifts or things she expresses that she likes which I will go back and get for her etc etc. She expresses frustration that I dont argue with her, frustration about me buying her things because ""I can buy the things I want"" and I'm kind of at a loss at this point. I dont bring up the fact ever that I bought her items (her son's dad would throw it in her face so I simply don't mention it not to mention I do it just because i love her and I truly do just get her small things to make her smile) I don't argue even when she's actually upset I try to comfort her. My last relationship I was with my child's mother for 8 years and she was emotionally abusive so i can understand some of what she has been through. I guess I dont really know what my question is but...some days she's so loving and sweet and affectionate with me but at the drop of a coin she flips and makes me feel like she wants nothing to do with me. Im writing this after an entire day of us laughing and having fun we go our separate ways for the day and then her telling me randomly that she wants nothing from me and that she doesn't need me and can do everything on her own. I will try to tell her that I'm not going anywhere ( she has expressed concern that when she allows someone to get close and they leave the comfort she got from that person leaves with them) and that she can feel safe and be comfortable knowing I'm always going to walk side by side with her helping however I can. Again...I guess I dont really know what my question is beyond me wanting to be there for her and her asking why we're even together. That question being posed after I let her know the things she's asking me to change IE: buying her flowers, her favorite coffee, or little things I see I think she would like, letting her know I'm not going to leave her, reassuring her, telling her I love her. Is all part of who I am and how I show my love. She expresses she wants me to stop doing those things. I'm trying so hard for her and I feel like my efforts 50% of the time are just spit at. I dont want to lose her and I want to continue our relationship but the things she says sometimes are really starting to hurt me and when I let her know that she tells me to get over it. I love her very much and she says the same. How can I show her she's safe and okay loving me? How do I make it known to her I'm not leaving her? 

TLDR: couple loves eachother. Relationships great 80% of the time. Suddenly at random gf tells bf she wants nothing from him anymore. Bf feels like hes fucking up and doesn't know how to help gf with whatever she's going through. ",0,1747621615.0,relationships,3,0.5,False
