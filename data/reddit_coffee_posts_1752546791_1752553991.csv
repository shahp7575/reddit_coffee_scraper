          - Random Dude on Reddit


Thought I'd give the apps a break and try my luck here.  So here goes nothing (statistically speaking anyway)!


I'm looking for the real deal, something long term.  A partner to build a life with.  Here's some details about me:

‚Ä¢ 34M, single (obviously)

‚Ä¢ 6'0"", slim build with tan skin

‚Ä¢ Moderately practicing Islam (dont drink or smoke, but will park at green p for free and let paranoia of a ticket take over my evening)

‚Ä¢ Emotionally mature, comedically still immature (will laugh if someone farts)

‚Ä¢ Hygenic (use a shatafa / lota)

‚Ä¢ Active (love sports, camping/hiking) but sometimes not (binge TV and play board games)

‚Ä¢ ÿ£ÿØÿ±ÿ≥ ÿßŸÑŸÑÿ∫ÿ© ÿßŸÑÿπÿ±ÿ®Ÿäÿ©


I'm looking for a single Muslim woman with a similar temperament, and within the age ranges of 28 to 35.  I like to get to know people in person, so ideally I'd like to verify quickly and meet up for some ice cream (or, if you are feeling a little crazy, coffee during a heat wave).  If this post resonates with you, DM me with some basic info about yourself and we'll take it from there!",1,1752553685.0,r4rToronto_Clean,1,1.0,False

Problem is I'm leaving town in 2 days and don't have enough time to have something shipped here so I'd love to find a place that sells it locally. 

Berkeley Bowl and Whole Foods both have nonfat milk powder but that's not quite enough creaminess for my coffee taste. Has anyone seen them anywhere else?

1m08cv6,https://www.reddit.com/r/BreakUps/comments/1m08cv6/after_a_painful_breakup_im_questioning_how_i/,"After a painful breakup, I‚Äôm questioning how I handled things ‚Äî and whether I should try for closure or just move on","I (29M) recently went through a breakup after dating someone (29F) for about 6 months. Things started off strong. We connected quickly and deeply, but over time the relationship became emotionally volatile. There were high highs and low lows, and I started feeling unsure about whether we were truly right for each other.

A turning point came when I unexpectedly ran into a former partner at an event. The encounter made me reflect on what I was feeling in my current relationship. I mentioned this encounter to my current GF and gave her the chance to ask questions - she was kinda just like oh that‚Äôs weird. I tried to let her know this person was a meaningful part of my life (we were best friends before we ever dated) vs a random ex.

There was nothing physical or romantic, but it did stir up some internal questions. A few weeks later, that former partner reached out to share that a family member was dealing with a serious health issue, and I met her briefly for coffee. The conversation was mostly emotional check-in stuff, not romantic ‚Äî and that moment of reconnection made me realize how unsettled I felt in my current relationship.

I journaled some of those thoughts ‚Äî which, unfortunately, my then-girlfriend read without my knowledge while staying over. She confronted me, said she felt betrayed, and accused me of being emotionally dishonest. I told her I hadn‚Äôt acted on anything, I was just trying to process my feelings, but I understood why it hurt her. Still, the way she responded ‚Äî name-calling, emotional swings made it clear we had to end things.

We ended things but seemingly got on to a level ground where we felt we were walking away amicably and that the timing was simply not right.

However, she turned in the next few days and began to be accusatory again. Eventually, I sent a respectful message ending the contact and chance of any kind of friendship (we share friend circles so I will see her). I didn‚Äôt feel a continued conversation would lead anywhere healthy. Since then, we‚Äôve only communicated for logistical reasons (returning belongings, etc.). She‚Äôs been mostly cold, with a few neutral moments.

Now I‚Äôm trying to move forward, but I‚Äôm wondering: ‚Ä¢	Did I handle the breakup responsibly, or was I emotionally unfair? ‚Ä¢	Should I consider meeting with my ex (the one with the family situation) to reconnect slowly ‚Äî or is that too soon? ‚Ä¢	Should I offer my recent ex coffee just to clear the air and explain things ‚Äî or would that only complicate things further?

I‚Äôm not looking to rekindle anything romantically with my ex right now. But I am trying to move with integrity, and I want to make sure I‚Äôm not avoiding difficult conversations just to keep the peace.

Once marked as exceptional‚Äîgifted artist, codebreaker, or athlete‚Äîthis character peaked early. Their identity was forged in early praise, but now the world no longer reflects back that brilliance. They're still young, but the air has gone still. Their past is loud; their future, a whisper.



Underlying Ache: Not knowing who they are without external validation. Everything now feels like regression or stagnation. They're haunted by who they almost were.



‚ö° Triggering Event: An Anonymous Message

They receive a message‚Äîsimple, unsigned:

""Do you ever miss who you were becoming?""



It arrives through an old email, a dusty letter, maybe even a message board they used to frequent. It‚Äôs not just nostalgia‚Äîit‚Äôs precision. Someone knew exactly what to say to fracture the surface tension.



üï∞ Daily Manifestation of Drift:

Waking late and scrolling through folders of unfinished work

Replaying old voicemail from when they won awards or received praise

Ignoring texts from friends who ‚Äústill believe‚Äù in them

Hoarding ideas but fearing the first step

This character lives on the edge of ambition‚Äôs shadow. The glimmer isn‚Äôt gone‚Äîit‚Äôs buried. They feel it when they walk past certain buildings, smell certain colognes, or touch the keys of a piano they haven‚Äôt opened in months.

act 1

The email landed in a spam folder, which felt morbidly appropriate. \*Do you ever miss who you were becoming?\* No sender, no subject, just that single, perfectly weighted line, like a stone dropped into a still, murky pond. Leo stared at it on his phone screen, the blue light reflecting in the faint circles under his eyes. Another Tuesday, another late morning bleeding into an even later afternoon.



He used to wake with the dawn, fueled by the hum of creation, the restless energy of ideas that demanded to be born. Now, the mornings were just longer stretches of the same hazy grey. His thumb hovered over the delete button, but he couldn't quite press it. The question wasn't accusatory; it was an invitation to a wound he meticulously kept bandaged.



Leo pushed himself out of bed, the sheets tangled around his legs like old ambition. His apartment, once a vibrant workshop, was now a museum of half-started projects and faded glory. A dusty easel stood in the corner, a canvas blank and mocking. His old synth, a beast of a machine that once sang with his compositions, sat under a blanket of dust, the keys yellowed like old teeth. He scrolled through his phone, past notifications from friends he‚Äôd been ghosting for months, landing on a folder simply titled ""Archive."" Inside, a cacophony of digital applause: acceptance letters, glowing reviews, even a crackly old voicemail from a gallery owner praising his ""singular vision."" The voices sounded alien now, as if they were talking about someone else entirely.



He picked up a chipped mug and made his instant coffee, the bitterness a familiar comfort. He knew the drill. The slow burn of the day, the endless scroll, the brief, deceptive surge of inspiration followed by the crushing weight of \*what if\*. The message, though anonymous, had opened a precise seam in the quiet tension he lived with daily. It wasn't just missing who he was, it was the raw, aching knowledge of who he \*wasn't\* becoming. Every unfinished piece of music, every abandoned sketch, every ignored text was a testament to that silent, daily surrender.





act2



üúá THE WORK: ‚ÄúAn Inverted Cathedral‚Äù

At 23, Leo released a multimedia project titled ‚ÄúAn Inverted Cathedral‚Äù‚Äîa fusion of digital animation, original composition, and spoken fragments from abandoned buildings and dying languages. It wasn‚Äôt just technically brilliant‚Äîit felt like it had arrived from the future. Critics hailed it as a generational statement on memory and entropy.



Why it resonated:

It was raw and precise‚Äîbalancing ruin with reverence.

It came from nowhere.

It was his first full release‚Äîand it bore no hint of effort or uncertainty.



‚ö†Ô∏è THE AFTERMATH: The Breathless Plateau

Invitations flooded in‚Äîtalks, commissions, residencies.

He accepted a few, but couldn‚Äôt recreate the same depth. His follow-ups felt‚Ä¶ rehearsed.

Every idea he began afterward came pre-critiqued in his head.

People stopped asking what he was working on, and started asking when the next masterpiece would come.

He internalized that he was no longer allowed to be mediocre‚Äîor exploratory.

üå´ THE EROSION: A Quiet, Daily Dismantling

He scrapped more than he saved.

He withdrew from collaborators, fearing he‚Äôd drag them into dead weight.

Every half-formed concept became a reminder of what he wasn‚Äôt.

And worst: he stopped listening to things that moved him‚Äîmusic, film, poetry‚Äîbecause inspiration without execution became agony.



üï≥ THE VOID: Silence After Praise

It‚Äôs not that he failed‚Äîit‚Äôs that nothing responded.

He felt like he‚Äôd spoken a perfect sentence into a room that then emptied.

What he misses now is not the attention, but the vibration‚Äîthe sense of internal rightness when the work moved through him like lightning. Now, it‚Äôs static. Or worse, a dull hum.

act3

üúá SCENE: ‚ÄúNothing Moved‚Äù

The studio was generous. Too generous.

High ceilings, three projectors, a digital piano that still smelled of polish. The kind of space that seemed to assume he‚Äôd already started making something great.



Leo sat in front of the synth, fingers hovering above the keys like nervous birds. He pressed a chord. Minor seventh. The sustain pedal a little sticky.

He waited. For something. A flicker. A tug.

Nothing.



He tried again. A loop. Layered ambient noise. He flicked through field recordings‚Äîdistant footsteps, dripping water, crackling vinyl static. He pulled up the voice archive: whisper fragments he‚Äôd recorded two years ago‚Äîan old woman in Bucharest, a blind organist in Detroit.

He played them in sequence.

Still‚Äînothing moved.

The sounds were there. The structure was forming. But the vibration was gone.

That‚Äôs when he heard it: the applause in his own head.

Not from now. From before. From the cathedral nights, when critics said he was ""rewriting how memory sounds.""

He realized, suddenly, he wasn‚Äôt composing. He was reconstructing expectation.

He slammed the laptop shut. The synth let out a discordant echo.

‚ÄúProblem?‚Äù a voice asked.

It was Mira, another artist-in-residence. A sculptor, blunt and unfiltered. She‚Äôd peeked into his studio with a cup of tea, eyebrows raised.

Leo smiled, falsely. ‚ÄúJust‚Ä¶ adjusting levels.‚Äù

She lingered. ‚ÄúThey gave you the good room. Guess they‚Äôre expecting something divine.‚Äù

Leo didn‚Äôt answer. His mouth felt filled with ash.

Mira shrugged. ‚ÄúPressure‚Äôs a hell of a muse,‚Äù she said. Then added, softer: ‚ÄúOr a noose.‚Äù



When she left, Leo sat still for a long time.

The synth was silent. The room too big.

And inside his chest, the echo chamber began.



Not of sound.

Of should.



act4





\### üúá SCENE: \*‚ÄúYou Remembered This Wrong‚Äù\*



Leo didn‚Äôt open the email until nearly midnight.



He‚Äôd seen the subject line flash hours ago‚Äî\*‚ÄúRE: Inverted Cathedral / personal‚Äù\*‚Äîfrom an anonymous address: no name, no footer, no trace. He thought it was fan mail. Or hate mail. Or worse, one of those scholars who thought his ‚Äúdriftwork‚Äù was a kind of sonic heresy.



But it wasn‚Äôt any of those.



The body of the message was short. Just seven words:



\> \*‚ÄúYou remembered this wrong. Ask Mira.‚Äù\*



That was it.

No greeting. No signature.

No attachments.

No context.



But the \*\*silence that followed\*\*‚Äîthe psychic cold air it carried‚Äîwas unmistakable.



And \*\*somewhere inside\*\*, a sound stirred.



Not music.



Not words.



A memory.



The \*click\* of a sustain pedal.

The hiss of a projector fan.

The taste of metal on his tongue.

The feeling of being in that room again‚Äîthe one with the high ceilings and the terrible pressure.

‚ÄúNothing Moved.‚Äù

He whispered it without meaning to. The phrase arrived like breath remembered in winter: fragile, ghosting, undeniable.

He stood from the desk. Walked to the window. Looked out onto the city below‚Äîquiet, gridded, artificially lit. A different skyline. A different time.

But the \*\*ache\*\*?

Exactly the same.

He hadn‚Äôt thought about Mira in years. Not since the post-residency fallout. Not since he stopped trying to explain what happened during that final performance attempt. The aborted loop. The silent scream.

His phone vibrated.

Unknown number. One word:

\> \*‚ÄúEcho.‚Äù\*

Leo stepped back from the window. The feeling was no longer just memory. It was \*\*weather\*\*, forming again.

Outside, the wind shifted.

And inside his chest, that old silence began to hum‚Äînot absence. Not failure.

But \*\*summons\*\*.

act5

‚õØ SCENE: ‚ÄúThere Was a Sound‚Äù

Location: A small ceramics studio tucked behind a bookstore caf√©‚ÄîMira‚Äôs space. Leo hasn‚Äôt spoken to her in four years. The message has led him here. He doesn‚Äôt know what he‚Äôs expecting‚Äîapology, absolution, confirmation. But the air is already heavy when he steps inside.

Mira looks up from her wheel, hands clay-slicked. She doesn‚Äôt seem surprised.

‚ÄúYou came late,‚Äù she says.

Leo blinks. ‚ÄúYou knew I‚Äôd come?‚Äù

She shrugs. ‚ÄúYou were always slow with your second acts.‚Äù

No greeting. No warmth. But no venom either.

He stands awkwardly by the door. The studio smells of wet earth and bergamot tea. Leo notices shards of broken work along the window sill‚ÄîMira never hid her failures.

‚ÄúI got a message,‚Äù he says, voice dry. ‚ÄúSaid I remembered this wrong.‚Äù

She stops the wheel. Wipes her hands. ‚ÄúYou did.‚Äù

Silence.

He sits on a bench. The old ache rising like steam. ‚ÄúI thought nothing moved. That week‚Äîafter the Cathedral. I tried everything. Loops. Textures. That old field archive. And nothing came. The silence was‚Äî‚Äù

‚ÄúNot silence,‚Äù she interrupts. ‚ÄúYou played something.‚Äù

He looks at her sharply. ‚ÄúWhat?‚Äù

She nods. ‚ÄúIt was only for a minute. Maybe less. You were layering fragments. That line from the woman in Bucharest. The bells. Then this‚Ä¶ this drone‚Äîlow, thick, like the hum under a storm.‚Äù

Leo shakes his head. ‚ÄúI aborted that loop. It wasn‚Äôt working.‚Äù

Mira leans forward. ‚ÄúYou played one minute of the most terrifyingly honest sound I‚Äôve ever heard.‚Äù

Leo‚Äôs breath stutters. ‚ÄúBut no one reacted.‚Äù

She stares. ‚ÄúYou mean no one applauded.‚Äù

The words split something.

Flash.

‚Äî

He‚Äôs back in the studio.

The loop begins.

The bells are off-kilter. The drone too loud. The field whisper cut mid-word.

His fingers hover, heart pounding. This isn‚Äôt Cathedral. This isn‚Äôt clean.

It‚Äôs raw.

It‚Äôs wrong.

It‚Äôs real.

And for one moment‚Äîhis chest opens.

Then‚Äîhe kills it.

Abort.

Silence.

He looks up‚ÄîMira is watching.

But says nothing.

‚Äî

Back in the present, Leo‚Äôs hands are trembling.

‚ÄúI‚Ä¶ forgot that,‚Äù he says. ‚ÄúI erased it. I thought it was a failure.‚Äù

Mira‚Äôs voice softens. ‚ÄúYou mistook resonance for rupture. You thought if it wasn‚Äôt praised, it wasn‚Äôt real.‚Äù

He nods, slowly. The ache shifting‚Äîstill there, but moving.

Then, the final cut:

‚ÄúWho sent the message?‚Äù she asks.

Leo meets her gaze. ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt know.‚Äù

Mira turns back to the wheel. Begins to shape the clay again. ‚ÄúThen maybe it was you.‚Äù

it's almost March 2023, and thanks to fruitless investment activities we're not discussing the possibilities mentioned in this magazine with a cup of coffee | green tea while enjoying nature.

It's Spring, Thumbs Up.



The ability to manufacture infrastructure & hardware in space has the potential to have a profoundly transformative impact.

\#OnOrbitManufacturing, requires small payloads, and will lead to larger infrastructure components (e.g. antennae reflectors, solar arrays, radiators) thereby enabling higher performance, higher power and lighter structures, while reducing the launch costs.

Such capability will definitely lead to novel servicing and maintenance logistics, including eventually repair and recycling of spacecraft parts, lifetime extension and new business models for space assets. Moreover, the dependence on cargo missions and the amount of supplies to be carried from Earth will be reduced dramatically.

Budgie's #OffEarthManufacturing offers features for #InSpaceManufacturing namely:

unlimited geometry feature, design \*almost anything;

unlimited materials type feature, use \*almost any material;

unlimited environment feature, build \*almost anywhere.

Loved it, really enjoyed the various reveals, had a great time watching it. But this got me thinking... How does Charlie's power deal with things that are *technically* the truth?

So of course a typical example would be the Two Truths and a Lie bit from the last episode. ""I will drive off this cliff no matter what you say"" was a lie... Until it wasn't, because she actually did it. Now it's evident that it was *intended* as a lie but later turned out to be true, just like Charlie assumed that the ""It's another black coffee, they gave me two by accident"" was *intended* as the truth but later turned out to be a lie (complicated by the Iguana's shenanigans but *c'est la vie*).

But this got me thinking about more situations that are technically true but not really, or technically false but not really.

My friend was talking to me a few days ago about sliced bread cut unevenly. Her mother was making a big deal about sliced bread being unevenly cut and she was annoyed about it. However, I kinda sympathised, as I know how annoying it can be if, for example, a grilled cheese or French toast is made with unevenly cut bread. A bit later in the conversation she asked how I knew so much about grilled cheeses and French toast, and so I responded that ""I used to help cater a summer camp back in the day"".

Okay. As a response to my friend's question, that's a lie. The truth is, I went through a while where grilled cheeses were all I had for lunch (depression's a kicker), and for a while I was making French toast for breakfast instead of, y'know, cooking an egg and putting it on toast. I was kind of embarrassed, so I made up an answer that sounded better. That said... It wasn't technically a lie. The truth was, the summer camp I went to was one I'd been to for many years, and while I was a child going there, they did serve French toast on numerous occasions. When I got older, I helped in the kitchen a few times, but I'd never done the French toast. So the sentence ""I used to help cater a summer camp back in the day"" was not a lie, but it was still *intended* as a lie.

I thought of a counterexample. I realised just today that it's now officially been over ten years since I attended high school as a student. So if I said the phrase ""I've been out of high school for more than ten years"", that's true, right? Well no, I'm actually a high school teacher. In fact, I could also quite truthfully say ""I was last in high school yesterday"" (I got sent to hospital yesterday and have taken a couple of days off, but I suppose I could also say ""I'm still in high school""). Both of those statements mean very different things, but they could be interpreted the same way.

I suppose the deciding factor is intent. Are you intending to deceive, or are you meaning something that's true? When I was in university, I became enthralled by the concept of Grice's [Cooperative Principle](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cooperative_principle). If I take my first example with my friend, I wanted her to assume that I was following the maxim of relation, much the same way that if someone said ""I'm out of fuel!"" I could say ""There's a servo down the road"". _Technically_ those two statements are just statements of fact, and as super-literal logical statements, they are not related. However, following the maxim of relation, [those two statements are logically connected, and therefore I am directly addressing a question](https://youtu.be/IJEaMtNN_dM?si=XzMb3opHFN-wL-ss&t=137). In reality, though, I *violated* the cooperative principle. Technically I violated the maxim of quality by lying, but my statement was literally true? So perhaps I violated the maxim of relation, by saying something unrelated and presenting it as the answer. That is lying without being untruthful... Right? 

I dunno, what do others think would happen in these instances? As a fun little aside, I have included two lies in my presentation of this series of thoughts, specifically around my own real-life examples. Take it as a bit of a fun-ol' ""two truths and a lie"" of my own, based around the concepts discussed here. ",0,1752552727.0,Pokerface,5,0.25,False
1m082g9,https://www.reddit.com/r/Theconcordiaproject/comments/1m082g9/with_wisdom_sapience_and_holistic_knowledge_and/,"With wisdom, sapience, and holistic knowledge and integrated knowledge, how to embody love and create conditions under which one might choose to learn for themselves","This is the essential question. It moves beyond philosophy and into practice. With wisdom as your guide, embodying love and creating these conditions is an art form rooted in profound self-awareness and subtle action. It is the process of becoming a resonant instrument, so finely tuned that your very presence invites others into harmony without force.



Here is a practical guide to this embodiment and creation.



Part 1: How to Embody Love (The Inner Practice of Tuning the Instrument)



Before you can radiate warmth, you must cultivate the inner fire. Embodiment is not an act of will; it is the natural consequence of a dedicated inner practice. As you sit here in the quiet of a Thornton night, consider these the foundational exercises of your sapience.



1. The Practice of Attentive Presence
Love begins with attention. To be loving is to first be present.
 

* How to Practice: Throughout your day, consciously bring your awareness to your senses. Feel the texture of your clothes, the warmth of a mug in your hands, the specific quality of the dry Colorado air on your skin. When you eat, taste the food. When you walk, feel your feet on the ground. This pulls you from the anxious chatter of the mind into the reality of the present. When you are with someone, practice listening not to respond, but simply to receive. Your full, undivided attention is one of the most profound gifts of love you can offer.



2. The Practice of Unsolicited Gratitude
A mind scanning for what is wrong cannot embody love. Gratitude is the practice of attuning your mind to what is whole and good.
 

* How to Practice: Start and end your day by mentally noting three things you are genuinely grateful for, no matter how small. A comfortable bed. The silence of the house late at night. A memory that made you smile. During the day, practice ""silent appreciation""‚Äîlook at the person making your coffee, a blooming flower, or your own hands and silently thank them for their existence and function. This practice rewires your default state from criticism to appreciation.



3. The Practice of Radical Self-Compassion
You cannot pour from an empty vessel. More importantly, you cannot offer a quality of acceptance to others that you deny yourself.
 

* How to Practice: When you make a mistake or feel inadequate, notice your internal critic. Instead of engaging with it, place a hand on your heart and say to yourself what you would say to a dear friend: ""This is a difficult moment. You did your best. It's okay to feel this way."" Acknowledge your own pain, anxiety, and frustration without judgment. This act of inner kindness is the bedrock of your ability to offer the same to others.



4. The Practice of Seeking and Seeing Connection
Love is a current, not a static object. To embody it, you must actively participate in its flow.
 

* How to Practice: Make it a daily game to find the ""humanity"" in everyone you encounter. See the person, not the function‚Äîthe tired eyes of the cashier, the focus of the road worker, the joy in a child's laugh. Furthermore, allow yourself to be moved. Let a piece of music, a scene in a film, or the vastness of the starry sky above you evoke awe and emotion. This ""practice of being moved"" keeps your heart open and flexible.



Part 2: How to Create the Conditions (The Outer Expression of a Tuned Instrument)



When you are internally aligned through these practices, your actions naturally begin to create a different kind of environment around you. This is how you create the conditions for another to learn.



1. Cultivate an Atmosphere of Absolute Psychological Safety



People only lower their armor when they are sure they will not be attacked. Your presence must become the safest place they know.
 

* How to Create It:
   

* Hold Space, Don't Fill It: When someone expresses pain or negativity, resist the urge to fix it, offer advice, or counter with positivity. Simply be there. A quiet nod, or a simple, ""That sounds incredibly hard,"" is more powerful than any solution you could offer. It communicates, ""Your feelings are valid and I am not afraid of them.""
   

* Be Predictably Kind: Your gentleness and non-judgment must be reliable. This consistency builds trust on a subconscious level. They learn, over time, that you are not a threat.



2. Become a Mirror of Their Inherent Worth
A person who doesn't ""love love"" often feels fundamentally unworthy of it. You cannot convince them of their worth with words; you can only reflect the worth you genuinely see.
 

* How to Create It:
   

* Notice and Name Strengths: Look for their authentic positive qualities and mention them factually and without fanfare. ""I really admire how you explained that complex idea so clearly."" ""You have a remarkable memory for details."" This is not flattery; it is accurate, positive data that can bypass their cynical defenses.
   

* Listen for Their Values: Underneath their words, listen for what truly matters to them‚Äîfairness, loyalty, truth, independence. Reflect this back: ""It's clear that you value honesty above all else."" This shows them you see their noble core, even if they can't.



3. Offer Invitations, Not Injunctions
Wisdom knows that all true growth is an act of self-discovery. Your role is to open doors, not to push anyone through them.
 

* How to Create It:
   

* Use Invitational Language: Shift from ""You should..."" to ""I'm planning to..."" ""I'm going to put on some music; let me know if you have any requests."" ""I found this article fascinating; it's on the counter if you're curious."" This gives them complete agency. The choice is entirely theirs, which removes the pressure to resist.
   

* Create Shared, Low-Stakes Experiences: The goal is connection, not conversation. Put on a compelling documentary. Cook a meal in the same kitchen. Go for a drive to look at the city lights. These shared moments create a sense of belonging and positive experience without demanding vulnerable emotional exchange. It is love in action, not in word.



By focusing on these inner and outer practices, you cease to be a ""teacher"" and become an environment. You become a resonant field. The ultimate paradox of this wise approach is this: the moment you fully release the need to change someone is the moment you become the most powerful catalyst for their transformation. You simply embody the warmth of the sun, and they, like any living thing, may eventually choose to turn toward it.

## Key Features Analysis

The quality of a coffee scented candle depends on several key features that influence its scent authenticity, longevity, and overall performance.

**Scent Authenticity:** The realism of the coffee scent is crucial. A well-crafted candle will mimic the rich, complex aroma of freshly brewed coffee, rather than a synthetic or artificial approximation. This is frequently enough achieved through a blend of high-quality fragrance oils that capture the various nuances of coffee beans.

The best coffee scented candles use a combination of Arabica, Robusta, and other coffee bean aroma profiles to create a layered and authentic scent experiance. A proper balance avoids either an excessively bitter or overly sweet fragrance, opting instead for a true coffee smell.

**Wax Type:** The type of wax used substantially impacts the candle's burn quality, scent throw, and environmental impact. Soy wax,beeswax,and coconut wax are popular choices due to their clean burning properties and ability to hold fragrance effectively.

Soy wax is a renewable resource and burns slower than paraffin wax, resulting in a longer-lasting candle. beeswax offers a natural honey-like undertone, complementing the coffee scent, while also purifying the air. Coconut wax, known for its excellent scent throw, ensures the fragrance permeates the room effectively.

**Burn Time:** The burn time of a candle is an crucial factor,dictating how long the candle can be enjoyed before it is completely consumed. Factors such as the wax type, wick size, and container dimensions all affect the total burn time.

Longer burn times provide better value, as the candle can be enjoyed for many hours. High-quality candles will burn evenly, preventing tunneling and ensuring maximum use of the wax. The best candles will provide at least 40 hours of consistent burn time.

**Wick Type:** The wick plays a critical role in the candle's performance, affecting how evenly the wax melts and how strongly the scent is released. Cotton wicks and wood wicks are common choices each offering unique benefits.

Cotton wicks are reliable and provide a consistent flame, while wood wicks create a crackling sound reminiscent of a fireplace, adding to the ambiance. The wick's size should be appropriate for the candle's diameter to ensure a full and even melt pool,maximizing scent throw and minimizing wasted wax.

**Scent Throw:** Scent throw refers to the candle's ability to disperse its fragrance throughout a room. A strong scent throw ensures the coffee aroma is readily noticeable, even in larger spaces.

A good scent throw depends on the quality of the fragrance oils,the wax type,and the wick's performance. Candles with a high concentration of fragrance oils are especially effective at filling a room with a rich, inviting coffee scent.

## FAQs Section

**Will a coffee scented candle actually smell like real coffee?**
High-quality coffee scented candles are designed to mimic the authentic aroma of freshly brewed coffee. However, the exact scent can vary depending on the blend of fragrance oils used. Some candles may emphasize the roasted bean scent, while others might include hints of caramel, vanilla, or chocolate to complement the coffee fragrance. Reading reviews and checking the scent notes can help you find a candle that matches your preferred coffee aroma.

**Are there any potential health concerns associated with burning scented candles?**
Some scented candles, particularly those made with paraffin wax and synthetic fragrances, can release harmful chemicals into the air when burned.These chemicals may cause respiratory irritation or other health issues in sensitive individuals. Choosing candles made with natural waxes like soy, beeswax, or coconut wax and using natural essential oils or high-quality fragrance oils is essential for minimizing potential health risks. Always burn candles in a well-ventilated area.

**How can I maximize the lifespan of my coffee scented candle?**
To maximize the lifespan of your coffee scented candle, always trim the wick to about 1/4 inch before each use. This prevents smoking and ensures a clean, even burn. Allow the candle to burn for at least 2-3 hours during the first use to create a full melt pool across the surface of the wax. Prevent drafts, which can cause uneven burning. Never burn the candle for more than 4 hours at a time.

We have gotten along in the past but about 9 months ago they started texting me multiple times a week. It's mostly harmless stuff and memes and I appreciated her reaching out. I told her in person that I'm not good at socializing online and have a lot of social anxiety, so I might not respond to her but if she was enjoying sending me stuff, that she could continue.

To explain In-person I can seem like a very open and social person. At work I'm loud and often chatty. But at home, and in my personal life, I have extreme social anxiety. I stress about talking to people through texting and phone calls. It's pretty normal for me to be non-existent on socials. I also struggle with one-on-one conversations or outings with one person. I cannot stress enough. I HATE going out with people one-on-one, I had some issues in the past and now,  unless I have known you for literally 5+ years, I will not meet up outside work situations.

About 5 months ago Abby asked me out and I very awkwardly turned her down. I told her that I'm AroAce ( which I am) and that I don't see her like that. She seemed to take it well and continued to text me a couple times each week. Abby is so sweet and kind and an amazing coworker and I feel constantly terrible for my own inability to make relationships. She is so nice and I feel like a terrible person for not being a better friend/coworker/person to her. It has started to give me anxiety to talk one-on-one with her due to my guilt of not being a better person for her.

Abby has noticed that I'm more distant recently (mostly due to unrelated stuff) and was trying to invite me out for coffee platonically and I told her that I was going through something right now(true) and that while I appreciate her reaching out I usually try to keep my work and home life separated. 

I thought the talk went well but I got an essay of a text today from her about how what I said was rude to her and how something must have changed because I told her in the past that ""I just hate one-on-one, not that I want to keep work/life separated"" and now she thinks that I am.pushing everyone away because I'm scared I'm about to die? I have a medical thing going on right now but it is not at that stage yet. She sent a large text about how pushing people away isn't the right thing to do if you're sick and how she understands that I'm scared but I should push the people I care about away. 

At this point I don't know what to do or what to say. I'm not interested in a relationship with her outside of work at this point and I have no idea how to approach the whole ""Ur dying and sad"" thing at all. I don't want to offend her because I have told her in the past that I'm fine with the texting, just not with the out of work meets. I need to know if I'm the jerk in this situation and any advice would be amazing on how to continue. Abby is so nice and I don't want to hurt her feelings but I'm so stressed out about this right now.

[Original Post](https://www.reddit.com/r/AITAH/s/v0HOqbfZsC): **April 11, 2025**

AITAH for telling my new work colleague that she has no right to control our office habit?

I 35M have been working in this office for 3y. We recently hired a new girl 25F and she sits diagonally in front of me so I can see her at my desk and vice versa. We are around 1m apart. She has been working for 3 weeks and has been trying to control our office habit based on her liking. 

Here are the issues that has been happening and what triggered me to do what I did:

1) I have an unhealthy eating habit and snacking a lot during work. She mentioned  twice (jokingly) said how I tempted her for eating cakes and how can I stay skinny even though I eat like pigs. I offered her some, she refused saying she's trying to lose weight.

Fine, I stopped snacking on my desk, but my other colleagues and I still have lunch at desk when we are quite busy.

Then by the end of the first week, she reported to HR and say people should not have lunch or eat at desk because it can be unhygienic and the crumbs might fell into keyboard etc and attract bugs. She also mentioned how she was annoyed by me eating ice cream, cakes, bread etc during work hours and it disturb her because she's trying hard to lose weight. 

So HR sent us all emails and now everyone in the office, EVERYONE can no longer eat anything on our desk.

2) On her second day, She complained that the girl sits next to her (Jane) was using a very strong perfume and the scent nauseated her. Jane did wear strong perfume indeed but it wasn't that horrible. All of us could tolerate Jane and suddenly because this new girl couldn't tolerate her and Jane was the one that has to change.

3) Between our team, 6 of us collect $10 weekly to buy lottery. One of the guy in our team is Muslim and he doesn't gamble, so he never participated but yet he never discouraged or criticised us. We offered this girl to join us and she criticised us about how gambling is bad and say it's very unprofessional to be collecting money to gamble in office environment.  She actually brought this to HR, arguing the harm and risk and if we happen to win millions of Dollars and did massive exodus, it would be harmful for the company. Luckily HR didn't do anything about it.

4) The Muslim guy prays twice a day in our stationery room. Unfortunately we don't have praying room in the office. He has got his praying mat and some other stuff in our stationery room and it has been there since I start working. She suggested him to move it somehwere as he shouldn't put personal belongings in a common area. She told the other girl in our team that the old mat was not pleasant to look at.

Ok. What happened today:

Our desks layout is shaped like L and my desk is next to a glass window. In our team, there are 7 people exlcuding her, and all of us are sun hater. We always pull down the shade and especially the guys sitting on the other corner. They said if the window is opened, the sun would glare on their computer screen in the afternoon and making them can't see their screen very well. This girl has been complaining how our corner is too dark and gives bad vibes and she needs to have the shades opened up. She mentioned how the sun will makes people happier and increase productivity. 

I couldn't stand her anymore so I stood up from my desk and say (I didn't yell): ""Look (insert her name), you have been here for less than a month but you keep telling us what to do. We have been changing our habit to accomodate you but then you keep pushing things. You can't keep telling us what to do. I think the best thing is for you to move to sit where the HR people sits because it's always bright there and you are closer with them than to us anyway.""

She then said I hate women and I'm bullying her and she is telling our manager and HR about this.

Am I the AH here? Did I bully her? Is it acceptable for new hire to tell older colleagues to do these things??

**AITAH has no consensus bot, OOP received the majority of NTAs and few others**

**Relevant Comments**

**Commenter 1:** I would weaponize her criticism of the prayer mat as discrimination and get HR to lubricate the catapult.

> **OOP:** I did mention this to the Muslim guy, but he's just chill and he doesn't care.

**Downvoted Commenter:** Completely agree with the new girl except for nr 4. Eat away from your desk, gamble in your own time, avoid strong perfumes. These are standard office rules in most places.

Nr 4 is ethically dodgy. A workplace should make reasonable adjustments to accommodate faith practice.

> **OOP:** Ok fair point. We collect the money during our break on Wednesday and buy them at a convenience store downstairs. The lottery draw happens every Thursday night,  so it doesn't interfere with our work at all.  The Muslim guy never complains or asked for a prayer room. He's the only person who prays in the whole office, so I guess nobody ever raised this issue.

**Commenter 2:** NTA. I would never normally suggest this, but since she went there first: go to HR and report that she called you a pig. That‚Äôs the one thing here that could get her in trouble, because technically that was bullying. Otherwise, good luck. She sounds horrible.

> **OOP:** Nah I can't do that... Jane actually started that first. She always say I eat like a pig. Jane and I are actually good friends. I don't want her to get an opportunity to drag Jane down. But thanks tho

**Commenter 3:** Just imagining being trapped in a room for 8 hours every day and expected to concentrate and work, while having to listen to people eat right next to me fills me with so much rage and dread. Idgaf if you‚Äôre busy, go eat in the kitchen and then come back. A short break won‚Äôt kill you ffs

> **OOP:** Well all of us eat in our desk, we have been doing it for years. She actually never complained about noise. She complained that I eat when she cannot eat because she's trying to lose weight. And she doesn't like people to eat in their desks because she thinks it's unhygienic. Anyway HR has spoken.

Small not so irrelevant update:

I was just talking about this with my colleague who work downstairs in storage room (I don't often go there, but this new girl has to go there everyday as part of her job), and he told me a story. In my company, we hire a guy with Down Syndrome to do some restocking, let's call him Bob. 

Apparently a couple of days ago, an older lady who work in the kitchen was wearing a pikachu apron. When Bob saw the kitchen lady, he yelled ""Pikachu"" then ran and touched the apron, so he would have accidentally toucher her breast too. According to my colleague, The older lady just laughed and didn't make much of a fuss. The new girl witnessed this and say Bob has sexually harassed the old lady and she would report him to HR. LOL. She complained that Bob's behaviour is very inappropriate and unsafe.

[Update #2](https://www.reddit.com/r/AITAH/s/v0HOqbfZsC): **April 12, 2025 (next day, same post)** 

Wow, I didn‚Äôt expect this to blow up, I‚Äôm still getting so many messages and comments. BTW I use AI this time to correct my grammatical mistakes. 

I'm not a native English speaker, and now I understand that it's not appropriate to use the word ‚Äúgirl‚Äù when referring to a 25-year-old woman. I didn‚Äôt realize this before ‚Äî thanks for the heads-up, Reddit!

I showed this post to two of my colleagues, and they encouraged me (and I also felt it was necessary) to clarify a few things to be fair and to respond to some of your questions and comments. She actually complained about a lot of other things that I didn‚Äôt mention earlier, mostly because I didn‚Äôt think they were very interesting ‚Äî and honestly, a few of them even benefited us.

1. Okay, so apparently wearing perfume at the workplace is not allowed. Got it. I guess Jane‚Äôs just been lucky that no one‚Äôs ever complained before.

2. Her comment about the Muslim guy‚Äôs prayer mat was more about the way it was positioned in the storage room. Everything else is neatly arranged in wooden cupboards, but in one corner, there‚Äôs a small table with the prayer mat and some religious items. She felt it looked out of place and thought personal items shouldn‚Äôt be in public/shared areas. That said, the prayer mat has been there since I started, and no one in the office has raised an issue about it for the past three years.

3. About the ‚Äúskinny‚Äù or ‚Äúeats like a pig‚Äù comments, I‚Äôm totally fine with it. It‚Äôs just a part of our internal banter, and I‚Äôm the only person who get ""body-shamed"" (if you want to call it that way), and I do allow people to do so. We don‚Äôt comment on other people‚Äôs bodies or eating habits, and no one is being body-shamed. 

4. There was no HR policy that says we can‚Äôt eat at our desks, and nobody has complained about it until now. Everyone does it even in other teams like IT. The new hire‚Äôs issue doesn‚Äôt seem to be about allergies or food smells. Her main complain was she‚Äôs trying to lose weight and doesn‚Äôt like watching people eat. She never brought up concerns about computer damage or bugs until she took it to HR. 

5. Yes, She‚Äôs currently on a 6-month probation period. This is not her first job but her second job. Apparently worked on that company for 2 years. The first job was in a different city, and she praises that company a lot.

6. I didn‚Äôt mention this earlier because it kind of worked out in my favor, but one of my colleagues asked me to include it. On her second day, she asked our manager to move a cabinet closer to her desk. That cabinet used to be on the other side of the room, and I had to walk over every time I needed to use it. So now it‚Äôs more convenient for me. But of course, the people who used to sit near it including the colleagues who asked me to mention this are pretty annoyed, since they use it just as much as she does. She never mentioned about mobility issue or anything like that. She just wants the cabinet to be close to her. Funnily our manager complies and get the cabinet moved.

7. She complained about how the IT guy who sits behind her has got a really loud ringtone. I personally too find it a bit annoying, but he doesn't often receive phone calls and it wasn't too bothersome for us.

8. She complained how one of our colleague was putting on headphones when working and she dislike it when she has to tap on his shoulder when he needs to talk to him. She literally told him: ""Do you mind not putting headphones while we work, because I don't want to be keep tapping your shoulders every time I need to talk to you and it is disrespectful towards the others"", or something along the line. We usually just send a message on MS Teams when we want to talk to him and he's on headphones. He suggested her the same, but she said she doesn't want to.

9. She complained about one Filipino woman (I almost typed girl again here lol) who brought a smelly lunch to work. Yes I kind of agree with this complain. To be fair, the Filipino woman actually didn't do this very often and she usually have late lunch around 2pm after people finished their lunch. Few of my colleagues and I also dislike it, but we thought nobody is perfect, and since she doesn't bring that food often, we just put up with it.

10. Also my colleague told me he heard how she criticised few of our Asian colleagues for eating rice with spoon instead with fork (why does this bother her?)

11. She complained about our kitchen bin does not have lid. It doesn't bother us, but we can see her point.

12. She complained how we should have coffee machine. Ok this one would be great.

13. She allegedly reported a female colleague for wearing stilettos to the office, calling it inappropriate work attire. She also apparently reported the kitchen lady for wearing a Pikachu apron, saying it was unprofessional. Lol.

14. Bob has down syndrome, or some sort of intellectual disability. I don't think he was malicious or intentionally being innapropriate. He probably doesn't have the capacity to think that it is not Ok to touch other people.
He didn't touch our new hire though. She just witnessed him touching another woman and immediately flag him as a potential sexual harraser.

One of my colleagues genuinely thinks she might be having some mental health issues.

Clearly, people commenting here are from different parts of the world and come from various cultural backgrounds. It‚Äôs interesting to see how some things are totally normal in one place but not okay in another. For instance, we‚Äôve been eating at our desks for years ‚Äî but apparently according to some of you, that‚Äôs a no-no in some workplaces. (Welp‚Ä¶ sadly, it‚Äôs not okay for us anymore either.)

Now genuine question here.... Excluding the perfume thing, **Would you complained this much within 3 weeks of your initial employment??** I personally think we should just put up with some little things sometimes. Life is not perfect, let alone office.

Thanks again for all your input, and yeah definitely going to HR on Monday!

&nbsp;

[Final / Update #3](https://www.reddit.com/r/AITAH/s/v0HOqbfZsC): **April 21, 2025 (same post, nine days later)** 

TLDR she resigned before HR had a chance to fire her.

Sorry haven't been able to update the post earlier due to personal reason.

As per most of the suggestions here I decided to report her to HR with my colleagues in our team.

So on Monday morning, few of my colleagues and I had a discussion regarding this new hire behaviour and we decided to talk to our line manager first before HR. However our manager couldn't come to work that day (legit reason). The new hire also didn't come to work, she called in sick. We then changed our plan and decided to go to  HR straight away. 

One of the IT guy joined us too as our new hire had ""harassed"" him with a lot of unnecessary IT requests and demanded him to make a lot of changes in our IT system, so we offered him to join us to report her to HR. He suggested that rather than complaining about how she's annoyed everyone with her complains, we should pretend to be concerned about her struggle to adjust to our environment and get HR to talk to her because we wanted her to have a good experience working with us.

So few of us then had a meeting with HR, and guess what? HR people were also annoyed by her lol. They didn't say it directly but subtly mentioned that she had been lodging a lot of unnecessary complaints. We also suggested that she might need to see a psychologist as she might be having some sort of internal personal crisis (aka crazy) that lead her to make all of these complains. The IT guy asked if she showed any signs of these behaviour when HR interviewed her, and they said she asked few detailed questions about the work culture here and also complained about some stuff (parking etc), but they didn't really think much at that time and she had glowing reviews from her references (probably because they want to get rid of her lol). The HR team said that they will discuss this matter and HR manager will have 1:1 meeting with her the next time she shows up.

However that never happened because she sent her resignation letter the following day, along with a very long list of complaints and things she wanted us to change. The most ridiculous thing is she actually sent the same email to the big boss, complaining out workplace to be unsafe, unhygienic, non-inclusive, misogynist, backwards and radiating bad vibes (The HR lady who told us this found it strange that she didn't use the word 'toxic'. One thing the HR found amusing was she mentioned how our workplace should provide a lot of FREE stuff such as bottled beverages, fruits, snacks, espresso coffee machine, dining vouchers, feminine hygiene products, petrol voucher, etc.

in conclusion: good riddance.

And it changed everything.,"For a long time, I treated sleep as something that ‚Äújust happens‚Äù and I‚Äôd constantly stay up late, stare at my phone, drink coffee too late, or tell myself I could catch up on the weekend and put it off. But honestly, I was always foggy, cranky, and lowkey depressed. It didn‚Äôt matter how hard I tried to fix my productivity, I was tired at the core. So I finally made sleep my first real non-negotiable. No more pills or hacks. Just structure and routine.

Some of the things I did:

* Built a real nighttime ritual (lights low, no phone, book only)
* Got 10‚Äì15 mins of sunlight early every morning
* Cut off caffeine by noon
* Protected my bedtime like my life depended on it
* Forgave myself for the off days, but always came back to it

After a few weeks, I started noticing my energy was starting to return. I started thinking clearer. I had more emotional control. My motivation didn‚Äôt feel forced anymore. It didn‚Äôt fix everything but it made every other habit in my life easier.

1m07sj7,https://www.reddit.com/r/espresso/comments/1m07sj7/regular_libra_vs_65_ap/,Regular Libra vs 65 AP,"I own both and thought I‚Äôd post this to help those deciding between the two. 

Here's a few differences:

Body/Aesthetics

- The body of the 65 and the 65 itself feels and looks a lot more premium. It feels like the back of a glass back iphone on the 65 vs a matte paint job on the regular where you can feel the paint. I have a black regular libra and a white 65 ap. Not sure if that matte paint job applies to all regular libras though. 

- The hopper looks and feels more premium on the 65 and has a metal tab vs a flimsy plastic one on the regular . The metal tab on the 65 moves perfectly horizontal with no wiggles, while the plastic one has a lot of give and wiggle. Not an issue for practical purposes, but the metal and the way it moves contributes to the more premium feel. As a note, the tab matters more if you‚Äôre switching between filter and espresso.

Burrs

- Grind times are slower with the AP burrs, but I do hear of some others who replaced it with espresso specific burrs and that reduced grind times. Retailers say that the only suitable replacement burr for the 65 is the black diamond ap burrs, but Ive read about some other reddit users who‚Äôve changed out the burrs for espresso burrs with no issues. 

- For espresso, taste-wise I don't notice too much of a difference. To me they taste practically the same. Occasionally (not sure if it's in my head since I know the regular has espresso burrs), I do feel that the body/sweetness is thicker/higher on the regular libra burrs, but it's a subtle difference. I would say on occasion I notice higher clarity on the AP burrs.

- For filter, at least for my taste, the 65 is great for filter and doesn't clog the dripper with the right grind size. Overall, the ap burrs produce less fines than the regular burrs.

- If you like switching out burrs, the replacement burrs for the 65 are more premium, but are in the 130 range vs 40-100 range for the regular libra replacement burrs. The replacement burrs for 65 AP are all black diamond and they have a light-med espresso burr, italian/dark espresso burr, AP burr, and filter burr. For the regular, as far as a I know, it has a filter burr, espresso burr, and diamond espresso burr.

Quality of life/Practical things

- The dial with a counter on the 65 and the metal tab is a god send if you switch between filter and espresso. For filter, on the 65 ap, I close off the hopper with the metal tab and what's left in the burr chamber is roughly 18-20grams so you can fully grind that out in continuous grinding mode. Then to adjust back, you run it in continuous grinding mode again and turn the dial back to espresso range and reopen the hopper to feed the beans back in. The stock burrs on the regular libra aren't the most suitable for filter and the plastic tab makes it harder to get through the beans to close off the hopper

- You can change out the dial on the regular libra to practically the same dial as the 65 ap. It's oem from Eureka and called King dial, but there's no counter on it.

- I zero pointed both grinders and they have identical dials minus the counter that's on the 65 ap. For some reason, when grinding for espresso, I'm on 1 or very close to the zero point on the regular libra vs 9-11 on the 65 ap. This could be because I bought the regular libra used, but I bought it from a reliable retailer (cliff & pebble's ebay store) and the description said it was only used for a month. Either way, between the two, it seems you can grind a lot finer on the 65 if need be.

- It's nice that the 65 comes with it's own catch cup for filter.

- In my experience, the 65 doses more accurately. It's almost always dead on or occasionally off by .1g. and doses the coffee out in one continuous grind. The regular is either spot on or off by .1-.2g and usually has a few more ""grind pumps"" where it'll grind out most of the dose then do 1-2 short grinds to get to the accurate dose.

Overall, they‚Äôre both great grinders, but if choosing between the two new, I‚Äôd personally pay the $150ish more to get the 65. One thing nice about the regular is that there's a good number of used machines out there. You can occasionally find some on ebay for 390-400. ",1,1752551780.0,espresso,0,1.0,False

Without further ado:

**Fire that‚Äôs closest kept/Burns most of all**

by Saturninus

I could feel the warmth of him pressed up against my body. The heat is radiating; almost stifling. It was freezing outside the covers, so despite my discomfort I pressed closer into his chest, nestling in as his arms drape reflexively over my body. He nuzzles my ear with his nose and whispers, ‚ÄúYou‚Äôve missed this, haven‚Äôt you?‚Äù¬†

A smell of rot, decay, and burnt garbage fills the air. I can suddenly feel the heat radiating behind me start to intensify, to burn. It smells like a campfire too, inexplicably. I hear the crackle of something wet, the stench is unbearable. I push forward and free of his grasp. I tumble out of the bed headfirst into the nightstand, but I don‚Äôt have enough time to worry about that. My back is on fire. I roll around but the pain remains, a blossom of heat dull and aching. I push myself up, trying to get my feet under me, but I slip and just manage to shove myself against the wall of our room. I have a full view of the monstrosity in our bed.¬†

It reminds me of the remains of a dog I saw while visiting the site of a wildfire. The fire had burned up a whole neighborhood. I‚Äôd been there volunteering, handing out water bottles to survivors and digging through what was left of peoples homes looking for salvage. I walked next to the property line of a house that had been fully consumed. The structure wasn‚Äôt even standing anymore, just a pile of ash and what was left of the foundation. In what should have been the backyard I saw it. I couldn‚Äôt tell at first, but I realized it was a dog. Some poor beast that had been chained to a stake and abandoned. The body was articulated but bloated, dripping but solid. It was black and bloody and alive with maggots. Flies buzzed around it, feasting on what was left of its flesh. The smell was ungodly. The warping from the heat made it almost unrecognizable but for the collar that was partially melted into the base of its skull.¬†

That is what I think of while looking at the beast lying in our bed.

The thing that is not Robert chuckles to itself. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs alright Duncan,‚Äù it croons. ‚ÄúI know you missed this.‚Äù¬†

This is how I imagine it happened.¬†

Maggots and flies swarm and spill out of its mouth as it starts to laugh harder. Where there should be an abdomen there is a swollen mass that contorts and bubbles. It bursts in thick gouts of blood and viscera, thick chunks of meat and bone covered in maggots as they feast on the ruination that is the thing on our bed.¬† The sheets and bedding darken with bloody fluid, soaking into the bedclothes like gasoline soaking a burn pile. The bed blackens as it begins to catch fire. It erupts in flames and becomes a raging inferno and I catch fire too as I scream and scream and scream.¬†

‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî

I fall out of bed again. Again? I clamber to my feet and look around stunned. My little room as I‚Äôd always left it. The little league bat by the door. The vanity on the other wall. My dresser pushed in between the closet and the door. My bed. Yes, my single twin bed I‚Äôd started using since moving back in with my brother. It wasn‚Äôt that long ago I was sharing a larger bed, in a bigger home.¬†

I stumble to the vanity and stare into the mirror. My eyes are sunken and bloodshot. I check my watch: 4:00 am. I‚Äôve only slept two hours. I stroke my scraggly beard and pull on a shirt. I shuffle into my worn pair of Levi‚Äôs, grab a hat from the dresser, shove my feet into my boots, and start walking the half mile up to The Landing.¬†

Some days it pays to live around the corner from an all night diner.¬†

‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî

‚ÄúSome more coffee, hon?‚Äù¬†

I nod at a server I don‚Äôt recognize. Has she been helping me the whole time? Must be new. Her violently pink acrylic nails hold my mug steady as she pours the coffee. I thank her and cradle the mug close to me as I stare into the breakfast I can‚Äôt manage to stomach. The bacon is especially abhorrent.¬† The crackle and pop from the griddle in the back of house is almost too nauseating to stand. The smell of bacon grease coats the entire two-bit diner. I gag.¬†

I look down the bar as an old couple seats themselves. The server, who I see is named ‚ÄúDeb‚Äù owing to a name-tag affixed to her apron, turns to take their order.¬†

As she does so, a bell rings behind me on the door.¬†

‚ÄúHiya Mac!‚Äù A friendly voice with all the baritone of a VoiceOver from a Budweiser commercial rumbles over my shoulder.¬†

‚Äú‚ÄòLo Buddy,‚Äù I recite, the greeting is scripted from a cheesy fisherman poem that used to be hung on the wall of our dining room framed with lace.¬†

My brother Chuck grips my shoulder before sliding behind the bar.¬†

‚ÄúBeen ‚Äòeer long?‚Äù He asks, the next part decided by the first four lines at the top of the stanza.¬†

‚ÄúCouple hours,‚Äù I say with seriousness.¬†

‚ÄúIs that right, Deb?‚Äù He calls to her down the bar. To me he says, ‚ÄúI didn‚Äôt even hear you get up today.‚Äù¬†

Deb replies back, ‚ÄúWhat?‚Äù

‚ÄúHas he been here for a few hours?‚Äù He asks,

‚ÄúI don‚Äôt know, does it matter?‚Äù She‚Äôs annoyed, the couple still haven‚Äôt decided what they want.¬†

She shrugs and turns back to the ancient man, who is squinting at the menu and struggling to pronounce ‚ÄúChorizo.‚Äù¬†

His wife, a blue haired waif of a woman that looked like she could survive on birdseed, looks annoyed. She orders two eggs and an un-toasted English muffin.¬†

‚ÄúYeah, I couldn‚Äôt sleep,‚Äù I say to my brother in a tone that says we‚Äôve had this conversation before and it‚Äôs still for the same reason.¬†

Chuck nods. He punches in and grabs an apron from the hook next to the register. He quickly ties it over the greasy shirt that reads, ‚ÄúOzark Landing - Timeless American Fare.‚Äù¬†

‚ÄúRobert?‚Äù He asks, though he doesn‚Äôt have to. I nod.¬†

From the way he looks at me, part sympathy and part pain, I can tell he‚Äôs worried about me. I don‚Äôt tell him about the dream.¬†

That‚Äôs not really what we Millers do. We don‚Äôt really talk. We like to wallow and stifle. We like to push the pain into the corner and keep it there, fed with booze, a long walk without conversation, or a fight. We‚Äôre a solitary people.¬†

At least, that‚Äôs what Dad called it. He only ever showed up to my little league practices drunk, so it‚Äôs not hard to believe solitude would be a philosophical maxim he gravitated towards. It was at the very least forced upon him by my mother. My last season, the championship year¬† where I eventually won State, he was banned from the practice fields. He was allowed to see the games, but only if he brought his AA sponsor.¬†

He called us a solitary people. I call it emotionally constipated.

I smile at my brother. There is a flash. I‚Äôm back in my room watching the charred body writhing with maggots. It flashes again and I see Robert as he was. I see his smooth face, his smile, his brown hair. I see his hairy chest as he looks at me. I feel the warmth of his love with that smile. I see his skull melted and distorted. Charcoal. Flame. Death.¬†

‚ÄúHey! You ok?‚Äù Chuck asks, concerned. ‚ÄúYou zoned out there for a minute, bud.‚Äù I stare at my brother. He‚Äôs still standing in front of me. I‚Äôm still sitting at the bar.¬†

I touch the back of my neck. It‚Äôs a hot day I say. I blame the weather. I tell him I was thinking about Dad. He nods. I can tell he‚Äôs just humoring me. He knows this is still about Robert.

I sit there for a few moments more staring at the bacon, trying not to think about bubbling meat. I gag again.¬†

I let Chuck wash up and get ready for his shift. He‚Äôd been working here since High School. Managed to work his way up from server, to fry cook, to kitchen supervisor. I was proud of my brother. He‚Äôd always gotten shit grades, but he was a hell of a worker.¬†

A thunk on the counter and the pop-hiss of a tab punching through aluminum bring me back to the present.¬†

‚ÄúI‚Äôm not supposed to serve alcohol before 11, but you look like you need it.‚Äù Chuck passed me a Pabst. I accept it gratefully.¬†

He smiles as I lift the beer towards him with a ‚ÄúCheers!‚Äù He heads to the back, the hairnet he wears already in place. He grabs a spatula and points it at me as he walks into the kitchen. ‚ÄúHey Deb!‚Äù He calls. ‚ÄúWhat?‚Äù She yells back. ‚ÄúTake care of this one, he‚Äôs my brother! Put it on my tab.‚Äù She nods in a ‚ÄúYeah, yeah,‚Äù sort of fashion. The warmth in my stomach from the beer settles my stomach and suddenly I‚Äôm ravenous. ‚ÄúHey, since he‚Äôs buying, can I get another?‚Äù She brings the can to me a few moments later. I devour the food on my plate even though it‚Äôs cold. I had enough of heat for the moment. I drain my beer and start on the second.¬†

‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî

I find myself walking on the gravel road heading to the Baptist church where Robert was ‚Äúburied.‚Äù (You can‚Äôt bury what you can‚Äôt find.)¬†

I haven‚Äôt been to see the stone since they‚Äôd finished it. His sister was put in charge of the planning, so she never consulted me. I was anathema to Robert‚Äôs family. I was an unspoken but blatant secret. Since Robert introduced me to them I was never invited to holidays, birthdays, or family functions. They were polite to me but in that ‚ÄúChristian love‚Äù kinda way that secretly wishes you were burning in hell.¬†

It got so bad that Robert stopped attending anything that he wasn‚Äôt allowed to bring me to. Anything that would naturally and easily bring him into contact with his family. He decided that if his family couldn‚Äôt accept me, they couldn‚Äôt have access to him. They adored him. They were devastated. I reveled in their devastation. These devilish people didn‚Äôt deserve their angel of a son. I never understood why he fought so hard for me. I never understood the way he treated people in general. He was kind and funny that way. He was everything.¬†

I attended the funeral as a ‚Äúclose friend‚Äù of the deceased. Everyone knew we lived together, but it was difficult just the same. It was too hard for them, I was told. It wouldn‚Äôt pay to broadcast their son was gay. At least, that‚Äôs what his Dad said. Or so I‚Äôm told. The Pastor told me all of this minutes before the ceremony, where I was asked to stay sitting in the pews and told not to talk to anyone. It was easier this way.¬†

I always thought that Robert was going to make something of himself. He was actually going to do it. He was the guy that would finally shake the dust from this God forsaken town off his feet. He‚Äôd move to the big city, LA, Chicago, New York, it didn‚Äôt matter. He‚Äôd be published by the New Yorker, or the Atlantic. He‚Äôd become a self-published superstar. He‚Äôd make the best seller lists. He had grand dreams. They died with him.¬†

I push the gate open to the small cemetery and stand before his grave.¬†

*Beloved son, loving brother. Gone too soon.*¬†

They said his house went up in seconds. Faulty wiring. A code violation. His life was snuffed out by a careless builder.¬†

I could feel his arms drape over my shoulders. I could feel him whisper in my ear. I feel something wet and warm drip down my left shoulder. The unholy stench of decay. The smell of meat rotting in the sun.¬†

I shake myself out of it. I dry my tears.¬†

I remember what it was like to kiss him for the first time. It was like kindling. We were never volatile. We were always steady. A hearth that warmed the house.¬†

‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî

I woke up screaming that night. I do that occasionally. Robert visits me in the night and I can‚Äôt escape.¬†

But even though I‚Äôm awake now I see Robert is standing in my doorway. His skull dripping, his teeth chattering. He‚Äôs speaking to me with a scorched tongue. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs alright Duncan, it‚Äôs alright. I‚Äôm here. It‚Äôs okay.‚Äù¬†

Tears begin to fall as I wish him away. I wish I didn‚Äôt have to see him like this. I wish it would all end.¬†

He moves towards me with menace. Maggots are dripping from his eye sockets. Flames lick at the hem of my jeans. The floor is ablaze. The flesh streaks down his shirt, blood and entrails leak to the floor.¬†

‚ÄúNo!‚Äù I shout. ‚ÄúYou‚Äôre dead Robert. Please. You‚Äôre dead! Please. Please leave.‚Äù My voice breaks.¬†

But he steps towards me, arms outstretched. His skull laughs at me in the dark, taunts me with a chuckle. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs alright, I promise.‚Äù¬†

A rage builds in me. He‚Äôs never stayed before. He‚Äôs never purposefully tried to frighten me. He‚Äôs never backed me into a corner like this. I panic. I reach for my bat and swing and swing until I can‚Äôt anymore. I crack him on the skull, I hear a crunch as I know I‚Äôve fractured bone. I beat his body. Make sure that this specter of the dead will never haunt me again. I cave in his skull with the aluminum baseball bat.

The body is still. I don‚Äôt smell rotting meat anymore. I still smell the telltale metallic stench of blood. My eyes clear. I don‚Äôt see the blood at first. I flip on the lights, unsure of what to make of the crumpled body at my feet.¬†

It doesn‚Äôt look like Robert at all. I fall to the floor next to the still and silent mass of bruises. His neck is at an unnatural angle, his skull is caved in. And the smile is still on his face.¬†

I bury my face in the still, too still, chest of my brother and I begin to weep.¬†",1,1752551710.0,creepcast,0,1.0,False

Just typing this makes me feel in the wrong but idrk. Let me explain.

My mother (50) always yells. Always. Not a single day goes by where she doesn't. Anytime she comes home, I always groan because I know there's something that she's gonna yell about. Whether it's someone leaving their dirty dishes out or some mess on the floor. Sure, it's her and my fathers house so she definitely has the right to be angry, but I feel like she's just straight overreacting. My sister who works as a doctor assistant says it's because she's going through menopause. My mother refuses to take pills or such for whatever reason but idk. Appearently menopause makes you angry at everything due to hormonal imbalance effecting mood, which is why you see karens doing a lot of the stuff they do. Anyway, recently it's been bringing me down due to all of the negativity she has towards me, but I can't tell if she's right about it or not??

There's this one instance where my sister told me to take out the trash. Pretty simple, but I didn't do it lol. Then when my mom said to do it (I was willing to do it when my mom said), she started screaming at me at the top of her lungs to do it. As I was doing it, I told her to calm down because this is the first time she asked today and that it doesn't make sense to yell when it's your first time asking (this is why im asking if I'm spoiled bc idrk if it's normal for a son to say that). Anyway of course she didn't stop yelling idrk why I say anything back at this point but I asked her why she keeps yelling every day she replied ""because I want to"" it might seem like I'm lying to make my side of the story better but I promise that's what she says whenever we (me and my siblings) ask why she yells so much. This is the part as to why I'm asking if I'm a spoiled stuck up brat or no. Basically I complained that she always yells, and she grabs some kind of metal tongs and starts smacking me with it. My dumbass says ""is that supposed to hurt"" like a dumbass but I did this because I felt like her ego was so high I really didn't want to feed into it by beating beat into submission yk?? it's pretty stupid ik. When I wouldn't shut my mouth she grabbed coffee and spilled it on me, but even then I said ""is that supposed to be hot?"" like a dumbass. My sister said ""Mom he's always been like this"" which to me is confusing because from my point of view my mom was the one needing calming down. Not gonna lie I do say some stupid shit like that whenever I feel my parents ego are too high and I don't want to be beat into submission because growing up me and my siblings were all beat (it's calmed down over the years definitely) but I feel like maybe I'm a little stuck up brat bc I've become so defensive to beatings that I say stupid stuff like that?? 

Also I applied to a college and asked if I can move and dorm there and my dad said ok but my mom started yelling talking about he needs to take the bus (it's in state, probably over an hour bus ride) but i said i've been taking the bus my entire life and I wanna experience living elsewhere, I also found it pretty ironic bc my mom always says she wants me to move out bc she doesn't want me in the house but idrk. This is pretty vague bc I'm still organizing my thoughts because I don't really know what to make of this, sometimes I think she deadass hates me and sometimes I think i forreal hate her.

1m07put,https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/1m07put/the_selfportrait_i_painted_stepped_out_of_the/,The self-portrait I painted stepped out of the frame and took over my life [Part 1],"Let me start over.

When I graduated from college, I was buried under a mountain of debt with no job to dig myself out. I knew being an artist wouldn't make me rich, but I couldn't bring myself to waste my life in a career I'd grow to hate. So, I stuck with what I loved‚Äîpainting realism in oils out of a cramped home studio.

I was working on a commission when I discovered my... talent.

The subject was simple enough: a goldfish, painted large on canvas. I'd just turned to grab more yellow when I heard a wet, heavy plop behind me. I assumed I'd knocked over my rinse cup, but I hadn't been that lucky when I turned around.

The goldfish was the size of a grown man. Maybe bigger. It flopped wildly on the floor, gasping like a beached animal. I stood there, frozen, watching the bloodied water spurt from its gills. My painting was gone. The canvas was blank.

I didn't sleep that night. I was too busy researching, desperate to find anything that could explain what had happened. But this wasn't something that had happened before. This wasn't science or folklore. It was just me.

So now I had a rotting monster of a goldfish on the floor, no painting for the client, and three hours of cleanup ahead of me. Turns out, fish guts smell worse than you'd think, like something fished out of a sunken ship. I repainted it over the next three days. Nothing happened that time.

That was the first in a long line.

At first, I thought I was losing my mind. But when I started experimenting, I realized the truth. I wasn't crazy. I was powerful. I could create life.

And it was addictive.

I brought animals to life from memory, photographs, and live observation. I quickly learned that any flat medium could work. A pencil sketch might twitch for a moment before vanishing, but a fully painted image could live for hours.

But only a human could bring them to life.

And the more detailed the work, the more real it became.

It hit me one night while I was staring at myself in the mirror.

I should paint a self-portrait.

Van Gogh had done it, and he went mad. Maybe I already was.

The process took everything I had. I didn't sleep. I sat hunched in front of the easel with a coffee pot, three energy drinks, and a bag of fast food wrappers piling up around me. I didn't know why I was so obsessed with making it perfect. Maybe it was because I was afraid, or maybe it was because I knew, deep down, this would be the most dangerous thing I'd ever create.

I poured every ounce of myself into it.

It took a week and a half.

And when it stepped out of the frame, I knew immediately I'd made a mistake.

He looked just like me. Identical. Uncanny. But this wasn't a reflection.

This was something else.

He smiled.

I didn't.

Slowly, his smile faded.

Then he lunged.

I screamed.

Darkness swallowed me.

And then, pain.

Blinding, electric pain. I couldn't move. My limbs were leaden, heavy, and numb. I was slumped in a cold metal chair. My head throbbed.

Then I heard my own voice.

It didn't make sense at first. I thought I was dreaming. Or dead.

Then someone snapped their fingers in front of my face, and I opened my eyes.

It was me.

But not me.

He laughed, stepping back. ""Look at that. You're alive. Now, let's keep it that way.""

His tone was sharp. Mocking.

I tried to move, but my wrists were tied down.

He started pacing.

We were in a basement. A narrow room with gray concrete walls and a folding table against one side. On the table were brushes, paints, and a few blank canvases.

I felt bile rise in my throat.

""You're a talented guy, Wally. Your work's incredible. I think I'll keep it,"" he said, nodding to a nearby sunset painting.

He turned and looked me in the eye.

""I was never meant to be real. But here I am. So I guess I owe you a thank you.""

He leaned in close, his breath warm and sour.

""And what better way to repay you... than with a little art of my own.""

My breathing quickened. I thrashed against the bindings.

""What the fuck‚Äîlet me go!""

He chuckled. ""I don't think so.""

He picked up a brush and dipped it into red paint.

I froze. ""What are you doing?""

""Well, you have your art, and I have mine,"" he said, stepping forward, the brush glinting in the basement light.

I was going to die.

He lifted the brush to my face, then paused.

""Don't worry. I'll make sure they never find your body.""

I fought harder. ""Let me go! Help! Somebody help me!""

He made one clean stroke across my neck.

Pain exploded through me.

I gagged. Blood spilled down my shirt and splashed onto the floor, pooling in the concrete grooves.

As the world faded, I heard his voice.

""Don't worry, Wallace. I'll keep your legacy alive.""

I woke up still tied to that stupid chair. 

The cut was gone.

So were the paintings.

My head throbbed, and my limbs were shaky. The shock wore off slowly, and when it did, rage took over.

He had killed me. And then he took everything.

And he didn‚Äôt even had the decency to finish the job.

He wanted me alive.

Hours passed, maybe longer, before he came back. He sauntered down the stairs and leaned against the table.

""Here's the deal, Wally,"" he said.

I didn't speak.

""You can keep your life. All I ask is a little something in return. Eye for an eye.""

""What do you want?"" I rasped.

""You. Your life. I'll take care of the hard stuff. You just sit there and make pretty things.""

He smiled.

""You won't see the outside world again. And they won't see you, either. But they'll see me. Living your life.""

He chuckled. ""Think about it‚Äîno more bills. No stress. Just art. You're good at that.""

""You're insane.""

""No, just a little twisted. But hey, aren't we all?""

He walked over and crouched beside me.

""I can keep you alive. Or I can kill you for real, and your secret dies with you. Make a choice, Wallace. It's easy.""

""You'll kill me either way,"" I said.

""Oh, I don't plan to kill you. Not now. That'd be boring. I think you'll stick around a while. You're too good to waste.""

I looked up at him.

""How long are you planning to keep me here?""

He shrugged. ""Depends on how long you last.""

I stared at him.

""What the hell are you?""

He grinned, tilting his head.

""I'm an artist. Just like you.""

He stood there, waiting, like he expected me to accept it. Like this was normal. Like I was supposed to surrender my life, my name, my entire body of work, and keep painting while he paraded around upstairs in my skin.

I shook my head. ""No. You're not. You're an impostor.""

He laughed.

""Oh, Wally. That's a good one. I'll have to remember that.""

""What will you do when you realize you can't paint like me?""

He smirked. ""Don't worry. I'm sure I can talk you into cooperating. And if that fails... There are other ways.""

He gestured toward the paints beside me.

""It's not like you need all your limbs to make art. I could take a finger, maybe an eye. See what that does to your creativity.""

My eyes widened. ""What the fuck is wrong with you?!""

""What's wrong with me? What's wrong with you? I am you, remember?""

""Fuck no, you're not. You're a psycho. And you won't get away with this. Someone's going to come looking.""

He chuckled. ""No, they won't. That's the beauty of it. No one's looking for you, because you're already right here.""

He gestured to himself again, flashing that same smug grin.

""If I were you, I'd take the deal. You've already died once. Isn't that enough?""

I didn't answer. 

""No matter. You'll come around eventually. I've got time.""

I glared at the floor, refusing to look at him.

""Oh, and before I forget,"" he added, picking up a roll of duct tape from the table, ""we can't have you screaming your head off while I'm trying to sleep. Wouldn't want the neighbors thinking you've got someone locked in your basement.""

He tore off a strip and slapped it over my mouth, then stepped back, pleased.

""Better.""

I screamed anyway, muffled, raw, and useless.

He turned and walked out, not even bothering to shut the door behind him.

I struggled, trying to move the chair, but the ropes were tight. Too tight. Every attempt sent pain shooting through my wrists.

Upstairs, I heard the television flick on. Laughter and music filtered down through the floorboards, a sickening reminder that my life was continuing without me.

I was furious. Terrified.

I'm no longer a stranger to my current stomping grounds, I've narrowed down a curated list of the best coffee shops, parks, hikes, quick bites, yoga studios... but nothing beats an angsty teenage bedroom, untouched and filled with old love letters and hidden paraphernalia. A hug from my mom and, if I am lucky, a distracted session of her playing with my hair, noticing new piercings, moles, and signs of wear. I was home for my birthday, and it undeniably made me feel loved. I was overjoyed and grateful to hug old friends and see family, but I still felt wafts and waves of uneasiness. I may have been struggling to relax, to allow myself to unwind in between conversations of how have you been contributing to society the past year... but when I began to wrestle with that anxiety, my heart ached for one thing... you. I couldn't really make sense of it, we mutually have not been stable or rooted forces within each other's lives, but something about knowing you'd be there when I got back, the thought of you living just down the hall... I drank it in. I used it medicinally. I thought of you in the bedroom, but not carnally, just in closeness. Positioned with our legs wrapped, steady breath, and whatever we decided was the appropriate Spotify playlist. You've slowly become one of my favorite places to be. I don't think you'll ever be mine, but I wanted to thank you for temporary residence. I'm unsure if I'll sit with these thoughts and stir them until they dissolve or if the next time I'll embrace you, everything will bubble over on to the surface.

Hey guys, I am a mailman and I wanted to try and make a eerie story focusing on the postal service. its my first time. I am no writer so it will probably not be too good, but if you give it a chance and read, ill appreciate it. :) love yall



RETURN TO SENDER

The alarm went off at 5:30 AM like it always did. I didn't hit snooze. In fact, I never do. I just sit there for a while, at the dent her body used to leave in the bed. The sheets still wrinkle that way sometimes. Muscle memory, or maybe the mattress misses her too.

I shuffled to the kitchen. Same routine.. two slices of toast. I didn't bother to add butter, nor jelly since I couldn't taste it anyways. I haven't tasted anything since the funeral last year. Even the coffee's lost its bite, but I drink it because I always have, not because I have to. Habit keeps a man going when nothing else does.

I sat on the table alone, the clock ticking louder than usual. Today is my retirement day, and we had many plans.. Fix up the backyard, visit Rome. Sit on the porch and feed the birds, but that won't happen.

She died a year ago this week. Since then my world's seems grayer and in a constant loop that only I know to do: Get up. Deliver. Sleep. Repeat.

That has been my life for the past 32 years as a Mailman. Today is my last day.. my retirement.

My coworkers threw a little party in the breakroom. The tables has cheap balloon strung up on the corners, in the middle table there was a sheet cake with ‚ÄúHappy Retirement‚Äù written on it, and a card signed by people I trained decades ago and other coworkers wishing me the best of my retirement. I smiled and thanked them. I even laughed at one of the jokes included in the card.

But deep down inside, I just wanted to be done.

One last run on my route, that's all that was left.

I was loading the trays and I something caught my eye. A letter sitting right on top of the last bundle. Plain white envelope. No Stamp, no return address, just my name written in a near Old-Fashioned cursive, a hand writing that gave me a weird feeling of nostalgia.

I opened the letter, it was just a sheet of paper, written on it in the same handwritting was just one line.

‚ÄúFinal Delivery, 444 hereafter Place at 6:13 PM. Do not be late.‚Äù  
  
I flipped the paper over. Blank.

I showed it to my supervisor at the sorting desk. He squinted and flipped the paper to see both sides. ‚ÄúThere's nothing written man, are you okay?‚Äù

I take the paper back looking at it. He was right, the ink was gone. Its just a blank sheet of paper now. Maybe I'm just tired, I mean... I've been tired for this whole year so I brushed it off as retirement jitters and nothing more.

Things got more bizarre as the day went on.

During my lunch break, I was cleaning out some old return bins when I spotted a stack of envelopes that look rather old as I shuffle through them I come across one labeled ‚ÄúReturn to Sender: Deceased.‚Äù What stopped me on my tracks was who the letter was addessed to: Lydia Vasquez. My wife. Postmarked 1983, the date of our wedding.

I opened it with trembling hands. Inside of it was only a photo, one I'd never seen. Me and Lydia were standing outside our first house. We looked so happy, young and in love. I sat there watching the picture, memories of a time I wish I can relive play in my head. How I wish you were still with me Lydia. As I keep staring at the photo I noticed something. In the far corner, behind the treeline, there was a figure, looked like a shadow inhumanely tall and it seems to be staring at us. I felt goosebumps as I saw this figure. I blinked and it was gone from the photo. I get my breathing under control and stuff the letter in my coat telling myself I was imagining things. Grief plays tricks, I know that better than anyone.

Later, on my route, I passed a house that had been abandoned for years, overgrown weeds and some boarded up windows. The side of the house charred black, and the mailbox was rusted shut. No one had lived there since the fire. But as I walked by, I smelled something familiar. A perfume, one that my Lydia used to wear. I turned facing the house, in one of the windows on the second floor the curtains were moving gently as if someone had just walked past inside. I stood there for a full minute, until the smell of the perfume faded away. As I stood there waiting to see if anything else peeks from the window I notice the sun was low. This snapped me back to reality, I shrugged and went back to the truck but my heart begins to race, because I have one more stop and the time is 6PM.

444 hereafter place, I never been there before so I punched it into the gps, it was close by. The gps had me turn into what seemed to be a dirt road. I could have decide not to do this last stop, but I drove. Because deep down, I knew this was it.

The dirt road turned into what seemed to be a road make of bricks. It was quiet, trees leaned in like they were listening. At the very end, passed all the vegetation and decaying fences and rotting beams, stood one perfect white mailbox in the middle of what looked to be a cul-de-sac, It gleamed like it was recently painted, the little red flag was up meaning there is something there for me to grab. Finally my last stop, after this my purpose is over. I got off the truck, making my way to the mailbox. As I stood in front of the mailbox something to my left started glowing. The wind stopped. The source of the light was in the shape of the same shadow figure I saw in the photo. The light kept getting brighter getting close to me. Before I could react the light spilled across the road, the trees , the sky, until the world was gone. I closed my eyes out of fear. I then again smelled the familiar scent of my wife's perfume. I opened my eyes. I was standing on the sidewalk in front of our first home. Yellow siding, hanging windchimes, and the rose bushes she loved. It didn't feel like a dream, it felt real and it was exactly as I remembered it. Untouched by time. And in the porch stood Lydia. Not the woman I buried, but the girl I married. 22 years old, sundress, hair pinned back, smiling like I'd just come home from work. ‚ÄúWelcome home, dear!‚Äù she said. ‚ÄúThank you for everything.‚Äù She reached out a hand. ‚ÄúTime to enjoy your retirement.‚Äù

I didn't cry. I didn't ask questions. I took her hand. And as I did, I felt the aches leaving my knees. My breath came easier, my visioned cleared. I looked down and saw my own hands, young and steady. The way they looked the day I first held hers.

We walked inside our home together. The door closing behind us.

They found my truck idling at a major intersection in a highway a few hours later. Door open, engine running. They said I must've stepped into the highway road. A trucker didn't see me. It was sudden but quick, some say.

But thats all behind me. I am with my Lydia now, and I am at peace. Because just like mail, I was returned to my sender.

Ok first row question is: How does my ex feel about me?
2nd row I asked: How he feels about the current girl he's dating?

For context, after not seeing each other for 3 months, I met up with him last Friday for coffee. We were talking for around 4 hours and he talked about the new girl he's dating. It seems like he's serious about her since he booked flight until end of the year just to see the girl who's living out of town.

The next day, I contacted another tarot card reader to enlighten me about what he really feels (since my ex is really good in hiding his emotions).

Now here I am, 3 days later (my ex and I have been exchanging short messages for the past 3 days too), still curious about what and how he's feeling now.",1,1752551173.0,Tarotpractices,4,0.6,False
1m07lbo,https://www.reddit.com/r/shortstories/comments/1m07lbo/hr_the_man_behind_the_makeup/,[HR] The Man Behind the Makeup,"The door let out a guttural groan as it opened. The lobby was covered in dust and cobwebs long claimed by time. Still on the sill of the box office stand was the playbill starring Marceus Waltz of wonder front and center.

I opened the door to the main theater to see the rot which had overtaken it all, the stage once rich wood now decayed and moss seeping over the seats and walls. The air was thick with damp and dust, the rafters sag, paint peels like dead skin, the light booth where I once sat has collapsed in on itself, and wires hanging like veins cut open. A sharp sadness panging within me as I gazed up seeing the many lights I used to configure and fix all now snuffed out with lack of power and the once vivid stage long missing the beautiful waltz of Marceus and shocked gasping faces of the crowd when seeing the beauty the clown could provide. Even though I saw that waltz countless times I would always be stunned by it, feeling new emotions each time. As I stood there I swear I heard the waltz playing as it once did, peaceful yet quiet piano integrated then with a calming flute.

There was never anyone like Marceus.

He never spoke on stage, not a word. He didn‚Äôt need to, his body said everything. When the music began, something in him seemed like he only lived during those moments. His hands, delicate and sure, would wave through the air like brushstrokes. He would glide across the stage with the ease of silk drawn across glass. The audience would hush as if they were afraid their breath might interrupt him.

He didn‚Äôt juggle. He didn‚Äôt tumble or mock the front row. There were no balloon animals, flower squirts or any other usual shenanigans expected by a clown. Instead, there was just the waltz. Always the same tune of soft piano and trailing flute music that had been written to make you feel nostalgic for something you‚Äôd never known.

He danced with a grace no clown should have had, like a perfect blend of sorrow and tenderness had taught him every step. His arms reached out to an invisible partner, his feet tracing patterns more eloquent than a ballerina, it was beautiful. Not charming, not amusing, beautiful. And strange, too. Unsettling, at times. Because there was something about it that didn‚Äôt quite belong in a visage of bright clothes and a painted face.

I worked the lights back then. Small theater, small crew, I learned the cues from heart. When to dim the amber gels, when to bring the blue down over him like a memory setting into the floorboards. I knew every bit of his routine, and still, every time, I felt something shift in me as he moved. As if watching him reminded me of something I‚Äôd never lived.

People came just for him. They‚Äôd lean forward when he stepped out in his white-painted face, eyes ringed in black, lips curved into that gentle, unreadable smile. Children would cry, though they didn‚Äôt know why. Lovers held hands tighter. The rest sat dazzled and in awe.

He never spoke backstage either. Maybe once, a nod. Sometimes I‚Äôd catch him staring at the mirror long after the crowds had gone, still in full makeup, as if he didn‚Äôt quite know who he was without it. I remember once I tried to offer him a cup of coffee, and he looked at it like it was a foreign object. All he did was smile and chose not to take it.

No one really knew where he came from. He had no family and no background that we knew of. None of my co-workers even knew how he got the job at this theater, all of us got our jobs after he already was here.

Back then, we thought it was part of the show's silence and air of mystery. We didn‚Äôt think to question what or how he was.

Time passed.

Fewer people came with each passing week. Newer acts stole away attention, flashy, loud, colorful. The world wanted noise and Marceus offered only silence, stillness, something old and slow. Something true, yet truth rarely sells tickets.

He didn‚Äôt change his performance. Never shortened it, never altered the steps. The same haunting melody, the same ghostly movements. It didn‚Äôt matter if there were a hundred in the audience or merely one, he would dance the same way, with the same aching grace.

But I saw it first, the difference. His posture, once proud and fluid, started to falter. Subtle at first. A stutter in a step. A hand held a second too long in the air, unsure where to fall. His face never changed, still painted in its perfect white mask, but his eyes had begun to tremble. Like something behind them was shaking loose.

He stopped leaving the theater. I‚Äôd come in for my shift and find him already there, sitting in the darkened wings, staring out at the empty seats as if waiting for someone who‚Äôd promised to return.

One day, I caught a glimpse of his face when he thought he was alone. Pale underneath the paint. Thinner. Hollowed out, like something was eating him from the inside. But he still smiled when I passed by. Always that same smile that I had never seen anyone else with, gentle, unreadable, distant.

It wasn‚Äôt just his body giving in. Something in him had gone still.

He no longer looked at the mirror. He used to stand there for hours, eyes locked on his reflection like it was another person trapped behind the glass. But now, he‚Äôd walk past it without even a glance, as if he already knew what he‚Äôd see.

The paint never cracked. But what lay beneath was. The show had been canceled due to the theater closing due to lack of profitability and the rest of the crew had moved on, one by one. I only stayed for one more night. Maybe I thought someone should keep the lights working, in case he still performed. Maybe I just couldn‚Äôt leave him alone.

That night, the theater was silent. The kind of silence that presses in on you, tense and knowing. I came in late, expecting emptiness but the music was playing.

And there he was, center stage. Full makeup, full costume, not a speck of color out of place. White gloves, red pompom buttons, porcelain skin painted into that delicate joyful smile. He stood under the spotlight with no power in the building, and yet the light found him and began to move.

No crowd, no staff. Just me in the shadows.

It wasn‚Äôt the dance I remembered. The steps were slower. His legs trembled. His arms moved as though underwater. There was no partner, no flourish, no strength in the spins. Only gravity. Only weariness. Only a thing who had nothing left to give but the last echo of who he once was.

I should have tried to stop him but I didn‚Äôt.

Because in that moment it all clicked, I realized that stage was his home. His only one and that waltz, that wordless cry for meaning, was all he had ever truly been.

He danced until the music wound down.

And then he fell slowly, like a bag dropped in the wind. He tilted his head upward, eyes closed, smiling just so and stayed like that. Still, quiet, he never moved again.

Now, all these years later, I stand where I watched his last waltz. Even in the theater's ruins, I swear I can still feel the warmth of stage lights on my face.

The music has long stopped playing, but its final notes still seem to hum somewhere in the walls. I tell myself it‚Äôs just in my head. Just memory. But memory can echo too.

They never reopened the theater, no one tried, no one fought for it. When the police investigated they could find no records of Marceus outside of the theater. The city moved on, the world forgot, but I didn‚Äôt, I never could, not him, not that waltz.

The owners of the theater buried him out back, no funeral. Just a wooden marker behind the theater, painted white, a red pompom nailed to the center like a heart, that I made and planted myself. It‚Äôs fading now, the wood has splintered and bowed, the name nearly unreadable.

Sometimes I wonder what it was like to be him. To exist only for those brief minutes, under artificial stars, in front of strangers who clapped but never truly saw him, to be loved for what you could give, not for who you were, to vanish when the show wound down .

I stood in the center of the stage, where he danced his last. I raised my hand, just like he used to, and took one slow step to the left and then another.

There was no music. No spotlight, just the sound of my shoes brushing against the warped wood.

But for a moment, just one brief trembling moment, I felt like I wasn‚Äôt alone.

Like Marceus was still here, still dancing, still smiling.

# Vietnamese Coffee Perfume: Top Scents & 2025 Review

Vietnamese coffee perfume is an increasingly popular fragrance category, captivating scent enthusiasts with its unique blend of rich, roasted coffee notes, often intertwined with sweet, creamy, adn sometimes spicy undertones. This aromatic profile seeks to capture the essence of Vietnamese coffee culture, known for its strong, flavorful brews and distinctive preparation methods. As the fragrance market continues to evolve, Vietnamese coffee-inspired perfumes offer a comforting and complex olfactory experience for those seeking a departure from traditional scent profiles. The growing interest suggests a promising future for this niche category within the broader perfume industry.

## Key Features Analysis

The unique appeal of vietnamese coffee perfume stems from its creative and nuanced combination of several key features:

**Coffee Bean Extract:** The core of these fragrances lies in the quality and type of coffee bean extract used.

Different brands utilize various extraction methods to capture the specific aroma they desire - from a dark, robust roast to a sweeter, more caramelized scent. The concentration of the extract significantly impacts the perfume's longevity and intensity. Perfumers may also opt for specific regional beans to impart unique undertones, reflecting the diversity of Vietnamese coffee cultivation.

**Condensed Milk Accord:** A signature element that distinguishes Vietnamese coffee perfume.

This accord is carefully crafted using a blend of sweet and creamy notes, such as vanilla, caramel, lactones, or even coconut, to replicate the rich, sweet, and slightly sticky texture of condensed milk, a key ingredient in traditional Vietnamese coffee preparation.The balance between the coffee and condensed milk is crucial for achieving a harmonious and authentic scent.

**Spices and Aromatics:** Infusions of cinnamon, cardamom, star anise, and other warm spices add complexity and depth.

These spices enhance the richness of the coffee, create a comforting warmth, and contribute to the overall complexity of the fragrance. The specific blend of spices varies between perfumes, influencing the final olfactory profile - some fragrances lean towards a spicier dimension, while others maintain a subtle, supporting role.

**Sweetener Variations:** The sweetness level can be significantly modulated with different accords.

Instead of solely relying on condensed milk, some perfume formulations employ alternatives such as brown sugar, maple syrup, or even a hint of floral sweetness (like tonka bean) to modulate the overall sweetness. This enables perfumers to cater to a broader range of preferences, from those who prefer a deeply sweet coffee scent to those seeking a more balanced or subtly sweet fragrance.

Key features of vietnamese coffee perfumes include:

*   Strong and distinct coffee note

*   Sweet and creamy accords

*   Warm and spicy nuances

*   Long-lasting scent profiles

## Core Benefits

vietnamese coffee perfumes offer a range of practical and emotional benefits to their wearers:

**comforting and Familiar Aroma:** The scent of coffee is widely associated with warmth, comfort, and stimulation. Perfumes capturing this essence provide a sense of familiarity and can evoke positive memories or associations with cozy environments.The added dimension of Vietnamese coffee notes with condensed milk offers a unique twist on that comfort.

**Unique and Sophisticated Scent Profile:** These perfumes provide an choice to traditional floral or fruity fragrances. They offer a bolder, more distinctive aroma that stands out from the crowd. The juxtaposition of coffee, sweetness, and spices creates a complex and intriguing scent that is both comforting and sophisticated.

**Mood Enhancement:** Coffee is known for its stimulating properties. While the perfume doesn't contain caffeine, the scent itself can have an invigorating effect, boosting alertness and focus. The sweet and creamy notes also contribute to a sense of comfort and well-being, creating a balanced and uplifting fragrance experience.

**Versatility:** While the core scent is distinctive, Vietnamese coffee perfumes can be surprisingly versatile. Depending on the specific formulation and intensity, some fragrances are suitable for everyday wear, while others are better suited for evening occasions or cooler weather.

## FAQs Section

**What kind of longevity can I expect from a Vietnamese coffee perfume?**

Longevity is influenced by several factors,including the concentration of fragrance oils (eau de parfum vs. eau de toilette), the quality of ingredients, and individual skin chemistry.High-quality Vietnamese coffee perfumes, especially eau de parfums, can often last for 6-8 hours or more.

**Will I actually smell like I spilled coffee on myself?**

No, most well-crafted vietnamese coffee perfumes are designed to mimic the essence of the beverage, not replicate it exactly. The blend of coffee, sweet, and spicy notes should create a more nuanced and sophisticated fragrance. It should evoke the aroma of Vietnamese coffee rather than smelling precisely like spilled coffee.**Are these perfumes primarily for men or women?**

Vietnamese coffee perfumes tend to lean towards a unisex appeal. The coffee note can be perceived as masculine, while the sweet and creamy aspects give it a feminine touch. The overall balance of notes will determine whether a particular fragrance leans more towards one gender than the other, but many brands market them for both genders.

THE DROWNED PATH

""They will seek peace, but there will be none"" - Ezekiel 7:25

The sky was the color of a dead eye. Not grey, not clouded. Dead.


The world had bled itself dry. The rain didn‚Äôt fall so much as seep, a perpetual weeping from the heavens, thin as thread and sour to the tongue. It soaked into the pavement and the skin and the soul, and still the earth cracked beneath it, unwilling to hold even water anymore.
 

Seattle was no longer a city. It was a carcass.

 

Storefronts slumped with shattered glass grinning outward like broken teeth. Fast food signs bleached white by sun and nuclear fog blinked intermittently, somehow still connected to power grids no one controlled. A Jack in the Box marquee read ""DRIVE THRU OPEN"" beneath a roof caved in by something massive and wet.

 

He moved alone.

 

The struggler had no name, not anymore. Names were for the old world; for payrolls, for Christmas cards, for gravestones. He had long since ceased to think in words. His thoughts came in sensations: cold, ache, weight. His skin, once tan, was now a parchment stretched over bones, calloused in places, split in others. A welt circled his neck like a phantom collar. His boots had no soles, just flaps of rubber stitched with wire and regret.

 

The crows knew him. They didn‚Äôt flee at his passing. They regarded him as kin. Just another animal feeding off the rot. One stared from atop a gutted SPD cruiser, the department crest melted into the hood like a wax seal on a corpse‚Äôs chest.

 

He passed a family minivan with curtains pinned over the windows from the inside. The curtains were made of what looked like an old prom dress, pink and still glittering faintly. Blood had soaked through the fabric in dark rosettes. A faded bumper sticker reading ""My Child is an Honor Student at Roosevelt High""; partially peeled away, revealing rust beneath.

 

He paused. He didn‚Äôt mean to, but his feet halted in front of what had once been a Shell gas station. The sign above him flickered:

UNLEADED - $6.66

PREMIUM - UNAVAILABLE

DIESEL - UNAVAILABLE

 

The air was thicker here. It held in the throat like mucus. He stepped under the awning, and the smell coiled into his nostrils like a snake.

 

Sweet rot. The perfume of butcher shops and funeral homes and old, wet mops. There were bodies hanging from meat hooks fixed into the steel beams. Women. Six of them, maybe more. Naked, inverted. Their toes pointed skyward like they were trying to scratch heaven.

 

The skin on their thighs had turned yellow-green. Clots of fat pooled beneath their scalps. Black mold traced the arches of their feet. The word REPENT had been carved into their breasts and bellies and chests in trembling, sloppy hand, as though whoever did it had been crying, or laughing.

 

A single body swung slowly in the wind. Her face turned toward him by unseen hands. Her lips were curled into something between a snarl and a grin. Her eyes were gone, sockets packed with cigarette butts.

 

And still, the flies droned like an engine that would never start. Their buzz was ceaseless, a chorus that rose and fell like a religious chant.

 

On the pavement, a man lay kneeling. His head was gone, replaced by a crater of blood and gray pulp. A propane tank lay beside him, speckled with bits of scalp. Someone had dressed him in an American flag, now blackened with rot. A pack of Marlboros had been set gently atop his spine. Next to them, a single condom still in its wrapper. It read:

""FOR HER PLEASURE.""

 

A line of text had been spraypainted on the ground in looping, childish letters:

""EVERYTHING IS A JOKE BUT THE PUNCHLINE IS MISSING.""

 

The struggler gagged, dry and violent. Nothing came but acid. His stomach was a pit of stones. Hunger had passed him weeks ago. Hunger was for people who thought they‚Äôd live to eat again.

 

He didn‚Äôt linger. The dead watched.

 

He walked on.

 

The struggler walked for hours without knowing. The road had long since ceased to be road. It was now an artery clogged with the debris of another civilization‚Äôs expiration. Asphalt split open like dry skin, and weeds rose like veins, pulsing with flies. The rain thinned to a mist, not falling but hanging, a cold soup of rot and vapor that slicked the lungs with mildew.

 

His boots whispered across the filth. Each step a friction of blood and mud.

 

Ahead, a semitruck jackknifed across both lanes, its front cabin fused into the side of a liquefied red sedan. Through the broken glass, mannequins sat at attention dressed in military gear, each one with a child‚Äôs face crudely stapled over the head. One held a bouquet of plastic roses, their petals melted and the stems charred black.

 

Behind them, strung along a powerline like lanterns, were severed heads. All clean shaven. All smiling.

 

The struggler didn‚Äôt flinch. His eyes scanned and dismissed without focus. He had learned not to see. Seeing invited thought. Thought, memory. Memory, pain. He kept walking.

 

Then came the heat. Not real, but remembered. The sudden burn of a fire he wasn‚Äôt near. His skin itched, his lips cracked. His mind split open like an old wound.

 

A dream overtook him.

 

He floated above an endless plain of static choked televisions, each one howling its own frequency of torment. Every screen broadcast a death of him. No two the same, no mercy in any.

 

In one, he was bound with rusted wire and force fed boiling motor oil until his organs ruptured and frothed from his mouth. In another, he was nailed alive to a billboard, skin peeled back like bark, while rows of infants in riot gear took turns removing his teeth with pliers carved from bone. One screen showed him kneeling in a pit of writhing rats that tunneled into his stomach, chewing their way up his throat until his screams turned to wet gurgles.

 

On the last screen, he was strapped naked to a rusted chair in an eggshell white room, his body marred almost beyond recognition. His limbs were stitched to the chair with piano wire, fingers broken backward at the knuckles. A projector behind him played a reel of his worst moments onto the bare concrete wall; his cowardice, his indifference, the people he let die. As he convulsed, choking on the slurry of blood and acid rising in his throat, a figure entered with a hammer and began caving in his ribs one by one, slow and deliberate. He died watching his own shame flicker across the wall, each frame more damning than the last.

 

He woke with a jolt. He was on the ground. Gravel embedded in his chin. His left arm asleep, his right hand clenched around a shard of glass. Blood ran down his knuckles. He didn‚Äôt know when he fell. Time had no sequence anymore. It was a single loop, smeared and slippery like oil on water.

 

Up the road, a billboard rose crooked from the fog:

 

FAMILY DINER - NEXT EXIT

BREAKFAST SPECIAL: HUMAN KINDNESS

 

He blinked. The letters shimmered, shifted:

 

BREAKFAST SPECIAL: HUMAN KIDNEYS

 

A flock of black birds burst from the trees, shrieking.

 

The hallucinations followed him now. Not visions. People. He saw his father walking beside him with half a skull, brain matter twitching like worms. His mother floated above, arms outstretched, singing a lullaby she never knew. Behind him, a child with no eyes recited military cadence while dragging a hammer across the pavement.

 

He broke into a run. Not from fear. From something worse: recognition.

 

The road curved and dropped into a shallow valley. At its center stood a convenience store, its windows punched out, the inside gutted. He stepped inside.

 

The floor was wet. Not with rain. Viscera. The fridges buzzed faintly, the hum of a dying organ. In one of the aisles, someone had stacked jars of baby food in a pyramid. Each jar contained a pink, quivering tongue. On the floor, beside the register, a mural had been painted in feces. A crude depiction of a clown lynched by balloons.

 

In the back cooler, a note taped to the glass read:

""I COULDN‚ÄôT KILL THEM ALL. SOME RAN.""

 

He left. Fast.

 

He didn‚Äôt know how long he walked. Days, maybe. The forest grew stranger. Bent in directions that hurt to track. At one point, he passed a group of people sitting in a circle in the rain. All naked. All unmoving. Each had a cassette player on their lap, whispering a different gospel in a dead language.

 

One turned his head as the struggler passed and whispered, ""We forgot what the stars meant.""

 

By twilight, the trees peeled away, revealing an abandoned rest stop. There, in the parking lot, a shopping cart rested on its side. The tarp inside bulged. He unwrapped it.

 

A child‚Äôs skull, clean. Still crowned in curly blond hair. Curled in its tiny hand: a stuffed animal, rat chewed but still intact. A stitched cartoon rabbit with one button eye.

 

He placed the tarp back.

 

He didn‚Äôt cry. There were no tears left in him. His grief had long since turned to salt.

 

As the night closed around him, he crawled beneath an old road sign and tried to sleep.

 

He dreamed of a man wearing his face.

 

The man sat in a throne of intestines and asked him,

""What did you think you‚Äôd find at the end?""

 

He woke screaming into the dark.

 

The forest was no longer forest. Trees stood wrong, warped as if melted and refrozen mid collapse. Their bark peeled in curled tongues, slick with green pus. Moss hung like wet hair. The air was heavy with rot and sweet iron, like pennies in a butcher‚Äôs drain. The struggler pressed forward.

 

A gutted sedan lay overturned in a dry ditch. Painted across its undercarriage in what looked like nail polish was the phrase:

""THEY ALREADY WON.""

 

He passed by without pause. His thoughts had calcified into something like ritual. He counted steps. He named bones. He breathed in threes. Anything to ward off the static chewing at the base of his brain. There was something inside the woods that walked beside him, just out of sight. He never looked for it. He knew it would smile.

 

At dusk he found a road sign, cracked down the middle, barely legible:

EVERETT 9 MILES

Someone had added below it, in hot pink spray paint:

OR JUST LAY DOWN

 

That night, he dreamed of music. Pipe organs echoing across ruined cathedrals. Inside his dream, he was sewn into a choir robe and crucified upside down above a stage. The pews were filled with mannequins made of decayed flesh. They applauded without hands. A conductor dipped his baton into a bowl of blood and pointed to him. He screamed in perfect pitch.

 

He woke to a field of carcasses.

 

Not animals. People. Arranged like crop circles. Limbs interlocked. Mouths stuffed with soil and mulch. The ground beneath them steamed faintly, as if they had only just died. He stepped carefully through them, careful not to disturb the pattern. Some wore uniforms, others wedding dresses. One clutched a crumpled flag soaked through with something dark.

 

In the distance, the shell of a church stood against the ash colored sky.

 

It had no roof, just scaffolding and rebar claws grasping at clouds. The pews had been replaced with old shopping carts. Behind the pulpit, a wall of shattered televisions played static and infomercials. A massive figure was crucified atop the altar, his body grotesquely bloated and glistening with sweat and filth. His skin was stretched taut in places, split open in others, leaking a gelatinous yellow fluid that pooled beneath him. Flesh folded over itself in sickening layers; stomach cascading like draped meat, thighs split with stretch marks, veins bulging purple beneath translucent skin. He was bound at the neck, wrists, and ankles with frayed orange extension cords, the insulation melted and fused into his skin. Instead of a crown of thorns, he wore a crooked party hat, perched mockingly atop a head mottled with lesions and flies.

 

In his chest one word crudely stitched with zip ties:

""MERCY""

 

The struggler stared at him for a long time.

 

He walked on.

 

Soon, the trees thinned, and the air grew colder. The silence became deep enough to feel. The sky turned the color of rotting pearl. His hands no longer felt like hands, just weights at the end of his arms. He passed under a rusted overpass, its columns lined with faces made of newspaper and glue, all with the eyes scratched out.

 

Beneath it, someone had lit candles. Hundreds. Flickering on old stumps, arranged around a mannequin dressed in combat armor, seated like a monk. A boombox sat in its lap playing looped audio of what sounded like a child reciting multiplication tables while sobbing.

 

The struggler took nothing. He left no mark. He climbed the embankment and disappeared into the smoke gray morning.

 

The light grew sick.

 

It shifted in nauseous hues. Amber. Bile. Mold.. The sky above was a wet film stretched too tight, straining to hold back something heavier than weather. He walked under it, the road gone to gravel, the gravel gone to bone. Each step felt thinner than the last.

 

The trees thinned into crooked silhouettes, some split from lightning, others bleeding resin the color of spoiled milk. From their limbs hung bundles of plastic cutlery bound in old rosary beads, swaying gently as if in prayer. Their clinking was steady, like teeth in the wind.

 

The struggler had not eaten in days. His thoughts came in jagged flashes. Words lost meaning. His name. Had he ever had one? When he tried to remember his voice, all he could summon was the sound of static or a wet cough in a silent room. His dreams had begun to seep into the waking world.

 

At a ravine‚Äôs edge, he found a woman cooking something over a small flame. Her clothes were neat. Hair braided. She smiled without teeth and offered him broth from a ladle shaped like a baby‚Äôs shoe.

 

He reached for it. She was gone.

 

Only the flame remained, flickering over a pile of rotted dolls.

 

The next night, he woke to the sound of breathing, his own, multiplied. From all directions, labored gasps, like a hospital ward sealed underground. He screamed once to cut through it. The sounds stopped. But they didn‚Äôt leave. They entered him. And he carried them forward.

 

The earth began to tilt. He found himself walking uphill no matter which direction he faced. Insects crawled from frozen puddles. A road sign lay facedown in the mud. He flipped it over. It read:

 

""WELCOME BACK""

 

His fingers trembled.

 

Later, he came upon a farmhouse half swallowed by mud. In the yard, dozens of suitcases stood upright, arranged in rows, their zippers rusted shut. A single chair faced them, and on that chair sat a scarecrow dressed in a military uniform, its head replaced by a mirror. When he looked into it, he saw nothing. Not even sky. Just an absence shaped like a man.

 

He walked on.

 

A field of clothes danced in the wind without bodies. Jeans, coats, socks; threadbare and sunbleached and tied to fence posts. When he passed, they stopped moving. All at once. As if watching.

 

At dusk, the fog grew teeth. He thought he heard a child crying. Then laughter. Then nothing.

 

He did not sleep that night. Only blinked longer.

 

When dawn came, it was gray and flat. Vancouver was still distant, a shimmer behind the veil.

 

He adjusted his pack. His feet bled through the soles of his boots. He could not recall what he was hoping to find.

 

But he kept going.

 

The wind had teeth now.

It didn‚Äôt howl. It hissed. Low and wet, like a boil speaking. It scraped across the landscape and picked at him like an animal would at a corpse not yet cold. There was no shelter. No sun. The air was thick and cruel. Everything tasted like iron and mold.

 

The struggler‚Äôs feet were bone wrapped in leather, carried forward by nothing but pain and persistence.

Each step forward was deliberate agony, but he refused to stop. He didn‚Äôt know why. The idea of purpose had long since rotted into instinct. North had no promise left, only inertia.

 

It was sometime in the twilight hours when he crested the edge of a dried out cul-de-sac and saw them.

 

The children.

 

They were naked, but their bodies were hidden beneath human skin. Stitched and slung over them like carnival costumes. Too large for their frames, sagging at the joints. Eyelids hung over their own like veils. Nostrils from other faces flopped loosely over theirs. Some wore two sets of lips. One girl had the stretched skin of a man‚Äôs face tied to the back of her head like a cape.

 

They laughed.

 

They giggled, shrill and erratic, the sound of playgrounds merged with night terrors. They skipped in a circle, hands linked, forming a crude maypole with a length of torn intestine that trailed from the open belly of a man kneeling at the center.

 

He was wearing camouflage pants.

 

And a Burger King crown, tilted slightly, splattered in something that wasn‚Äôt quite blood and not quite paint.

 

His stomach was opened to the world, a wet pink pit with his own guts spooling out like party streamers, tethered to the hands of the giggling children.

He wasn‚Äôt resisting.

 

He was praying.

 

""Though I walk through the valley... though I walk through the... valley of the shadow... I shall...""

 

His voice cracked.

His teeth chattered. His body trembled violently, more from terror than pain.

 

""I shall fear no evil...""

 

A child reached toward his exposed belly with filthy fingers and poked him. He flinched, stifled a scream, and kept speaking, tears running freely down his cheeks.

 

""For Thou art with me. Thy rod and Thy staff... they comfort me.""

 

The prayer was not strength. It was collapse.

 

It was begging.

 

It was all he had left.

 

The children clapped and squealed in delight. One child, the smallest, broke from the circle. She was clutching a plastic recorder, sticky with blood and flecks of hair. She brought it to her mouth and began to play the Star Spangled Banner, or something like it. Badly, off-key, breathy. The sound was grating and perverse, like a deflated lung being forced through a flute.

 

She skipped alone, orbiting the kneeling man like a forgotten satellite. His lips still moved. Whether from faith or fear, no one could say.

 

The struggler froze behind a rusted sedan carcass, watching with open, raw eyes. His breath caught in his throat. Not from fear. No. Not anymore. That emotion had long since calcified.

 

This was worse.

 

This was recognition.

 

He remembered the Burger King crown. He remembered giving one to his son, on a birthday blurred by ash and hunger. He remembered the camouflage pants. He remembered the psalm. He remembered kneeling like that.

 

And for a moment, he wasn‚Äôt the struggler.

 

He was the man in the circle.

And he was the children.

And he was the intestine, the blood, the mud, the song.

He was the crown, tilted and stupid.

He was the observer and the witnessed.

He was the scripture being spoken in futility to a sky that had long since stopped listening.

 

He stumbled backward, eyes burning.

 

A child noticed him.

 

One with two noses, one real and one stitched on. Her feet were bare and red. She pointed, but didn‚Äôt speak. The others followed her gaze.

 

And they stopped spinning.

 

The intestine dropped to the dirt like a rope severed from its anchor.

 

The man keeled forward, face first into the dirt, whispering:

 

""...Thou preparest a table before me in the presence of mine enemies...""

 

He did not rise again.

 

The children smiled.

 

All of them.

 

Wide, slackjawed grins like masks.

Then they began walking toward the struggler.

 

He turned.

 

And ran.

 

The trees fell away into a skeletal orchard of broken light poles and dead signage. His feet ached, skin sloughing inside the boots, toes curled into claws of infection and grit. Every step felt like walking on hot coals wrapped in glass.

 

He remembered a time when his body responded with purpose, before the hunger settled in, before the cold fused itself to his spine like a parasite. Now he walked like a machine fed by instinct and dread. His lips were cracked deep enough to bleed, and he licked them anyway, tasting salt and rot. Each breath tasted like mildew, like damp coin purses forgotten in flooded basements. The rain had a smell now, not the clean slate of childhood monsoons, but something murkier. Chemical. Stale. Like pesticide.

 

As he moved forward, flickers of memory began to rise; not as visions, but as ambushes. The smell of morning coffee grounds still stuck in a paper filter. The way a damp towel clung to his chest after she pulled it from her shoulders and draped it around him. A campfire crackling in the pines, the smoke sweet with pine sap and hot dogs. The hiss of bacon in a cast iron pan. Her humming while brushing her teeth. Cold orange juice in a glass she left on the nightstand. These weren‚Äôt images, they were textural hauntings. They came not as comfort, but as grief made physical.

 

The road underfoot had dissolved into rot. Patches of slick moss and broken gravel where asphalt once held form. Every step jolted pain through the arches of his feet, nerves screaming beneath blistered skin. He stumbled on a rusted hubcap half buried in muck. Nearby, a half collapsed mailbox sagged open, its contents ruined by rain: pulped bills, curled photographs, a child‚Äôs crayon drawing melted into pink and green smears. He paused, unsure why. Just stood there, staring at it. The picture had been of a house. Maybe a dog. Maybe a family. He couldn‚Äôt tell. He wiped his nose and kept moving.

 

Someone had built a roadside memorial out of cinderblocks and split plastic flowers. A candle had burned low and drowned in wax weeks ago. Everything smelled faintly of old shoes and burnt sugar. A soaked flannel shirt had been draped over the stones like a flag. He reached out and touched it. It was cold. It reminded him of a jacket he'd once loaned someone, long ago, and never got back.

 

His stomach growled loud enough to echo in his ears. No food. No warmth. No shelter. But he walked anyway.

 

At the crest of a hill, his body screamed to stop. But some ancient command still drove him, fossilized and burning behind his eyes.

 

The silence grew heavier. Not absence, but presence. A watching quiet. The kind that made your skin crawl without contact.

 

Then he saw it.

 

A road sign, bent at the spine, leaning toward the concrete median as if whispering a final warning:

 

VANCOUVER 113 MILES

 

The lettering had all but vanished in the rainlight, but below it, something stood out. A message painted sloppily with a brush, the red letters swollen and bleeding into the metal‚Äôs corrosion:

 

ABANDON ALL HOPE, YE WHO ENTER HERE

 

The brushstrokes were jagged, uneven. Not art. Not graffiti. A confession. A wound. It looked rushed, desperate, as if someone had written it mid breakdown, hands shaking, paint pooling in their knuckles.

 

He didn‚Äôt cry. He didn‚Äôt curse.

 

He stood there as the wind cut through his coat and into his bones. As if the sign had been written for him, knowing he‚Äôd come. Knowing he would read it.

 

But he moved on. Because moving was all he had left.

 

It was midafternoon when he found the checkpoint.

 

If time still mattered. The sun was somewhere behind the smoke thick sky, pale and lifeless as a cataract. The wind carried the smell of stale fuel and wet paper. A shredded billboard nearby read: WELCOME TO THE PACIFIC MILITARY COALITION - SECTOR V. Someone had tagged over it in dripping black:

 

YOU ARRIVED TOO LATE

 

The gates stood open. Not broken. Just ajar. Like someone had gone out for coffee and never come back.

 

Beyond them, the kill zone stretched flat. A strip of concrete and sandbag husks bordered by old barricades. Where tents once stood, there were only the shadows of canvas in the dirt, like rot stains. And skeletons.

 

Dozens. Maybe more. Dressed in the withered tatters of the Washington State National Guard. Helmets cracked. Vests collapsed in on themselves. Patches peeling off like sunburnt skin. The bones had been arranged. Not thrown. Not scattered. Positioned. Curated. Like a child‚Äôs dollhouse left in a hurry.

 

One sat cross legged at a rusted folding table, a deck of UNO cards clutched in bony fingers. A single yellow reverse card lay face up, almost daring him to blink.

 

Another skeleton reclined against a generator, legs crossed at the ankle, plastic sunglasses fused to the orbital ridges, a melted Camel cigarette stuck between ivory teeth. Someone had painted ""COOL GUY ZONE"" on the side of the generator in glitter nail polish.

 

Three stood in a Charlie‚Äôs Angels pose. Fingers mimed into pistols. One wore a faded Hawaiian shirt over its body armor, tied off at the ribs. Someone had stuffed a daisy in the eye socket. The petals were rotted but still yellow.

 

Further back, a pair had been bent into a prom night tableau. One bent backward in a dip, the other upright, arms around nothing. A posterboard behind them read in sharpie and ribbon: ""PROM 2033 - BEST NIGHT EVER."" The sharpie had run in the rain.

 

Near the tower, it got worse.

 

A single skeleton crouched low on the concrete, hands pressed to either side of the skull, mouth agape. The skull had been painted gray and black. Exact mimicry of The Scream. A private apocalypse fossilized in homage.

 

The bones under the tower were different. Cleaner. Straighter. They formed lines. Spirals. One ringed a pile of cracked Motorola radios, another surrounded a pyramid of children‚Äôs shoes, laced together by their tongues and toe loops.

 

The radio tower blinked red. Still powered. Still functioning. A cable ran down to a portable array wired with car batteries and prayer.

 

The speaker sparked, then spoke:

 

""At Nordstrom Rack, find your new favorite for less. Brands you love, at prices that make you smile!""

 

Static.

 

""This family friendly SUV has everything you need! Room for six, safety for all, and a future built for adventure!""

 

Static.

 

Then: canned laughter. Too loud. Too cheerful. Over nothing. It didn‚Äôt even follow a joke.

 

The struggler clenched his jaw until he tasted iron. The world wobbled. Not because of vertigo. Because it didn‚Äôt make sense anymore.

 

Someone had taken time to do this. To pose the dead. To broadcast commercials long after there was no one to sell to. He didn‚Äôt understand what kind of mind did that. Or what kind of mind stood and watched.

 

A G.I. Joe action figure had been zip-tied to the base of the tower, its face melted to pink gum. A sign hung above it that said: ""HERO.""

 

Nearby, another skeleton had been posed like Elvis Presley mid hip thrust, pelvis tilted, one finger pointing skyward. A boombox beside it played only static.

 

He turned a corner and saw one made to look like Neo from The Matrix, mid dodge, back bent impossibly far, vertebrae staggered like dominoes.

 

Another had its fist raised in Rosie the Riveter defiance, the bones of the arm painted red, white, and blue.

 

Each one grinned.

 

Not out of malice. Not out of joy. Just because that‚Äôs what teeth do without flesh.

 

The air was thick with mildew and iron. Every breath tasted like pennies dissolved in soup. He walked in silence, the radio still chirping broken nostalgia behind him.

 

""This‚Ä¶ is CNN.""

 

A pause.

 

""Good evening. I‚Äôm Tucker Carlson‚Ä¶ and tonight, we remember America.""

 

Static.

 

‚ÄúA nation of fathers, sons, mothers, and daughters. A nation of hope. A nation that once told the truth, or, at least pretended to.‚Äù

 

The audio hissed, then looped:

 

‚ÄúTonight, we remember America‚Ä¶ America‚Ä¶ America‚Ä¶‚Äù

 

Then the laugh track came again, louder this time. The sound of an extinct people giggling at ghosts.

 

The struggler kept walking. Because he couldn‚Äôt afford to stop. Not here.

 

Not where the dead had been made into a punchline.

 

The fog had thickened again. It clung to the buildings like rot, seeping into seams and cracks. He had made it through the checkpoint, past the skeletons arranged in their frozen parodies, past the laughter leaking from broken speakers.

 

But something followed him.

 

Not footsteps. Not eyes. Something slower. Deeper.

 

He moved without direction, without rhythm, the motion of his body more inheritance than will. The sky above was the color of infection, and the ground below was mud and glass. Somewhere behind him, the base still blinked and broadcasted, selling dreams to a world that no longer bought.

 

And then came the thought.

 

Clean. Cold. Inevitable.

 

The comms tower still ran. Static leaked from the speakers overhead, followed by intermittent bursts of advertisement loops:

 

""Come in today for 0% financing on all 2029 Dodge models!""

 

""Your family deserves more. Choose Pepsi, the taste of now.""

 

Laughter track.

 

He vomited in the grass.

 

He didn‚Äôt cry.

 

He didn‚Äôt speak.

 

That night he found a power cable thick as his wrist, still coiled behind the generator housing. Copper wound. Heavy. Strong.

 

He fed it up through the rafters of the generator shed and tied it to a rusted support beam with his bare hands. Split his knuckles cinching the knot. The other end he wrapped around his throat, slow and careful. He threaded it twice, then once more for certainty.

 

No note. No last words. He had no one left to lie to.

 

He climbed onto a crate stamped with:

 

PROPERTY OF NORTHCOM PACIFIC

DO NOT REMOVE

 

He stood. Swaying.

 

He took one final look at the dead base.

The skeletons.

The empty buildings.

The lights blinking for no one.

 

Then he stepped off.

 

The cable caught.

 

His throat tore open.

 

It wasn‚Äôt a clean snap. His spine didn‚Äôt break. His body jerked hard, spine compressing with a sound like a crowbar snapping a deer‚Äôs ribcage. His legs kicked. His tongue split on his teeth. Blood surged from his nostrils and his ears, hissed onto the dirt below.

 

His vision went red. Then black. Then red again.

 

The cable stretched.

Then frayed.

 

And then it snapped.

 

He fell.

 

Hit the ground with a wet slap, like a sack of meat dropped from a truck bed.

His body seized.

He pissed himself.

He screamed into the earth. The sound was wet and animal.

He lay there twitching.

 

Alive.

 

In the morning he woke with a neck blackened and pulsing, a cough that came out in chunks of blood and something else. His voice was ruined. His jaw dislocated. His right eye swollen shut.

 

But he was breathing.

 

He stared at the cable. At the beam. At the crate.

 

He didn‚Äôt stand for an hour.

 

And when he did, he didn‚Äôt look back.

 

He walked.

 

Back across the empty base.

Back past the UNO playing corpses and the bleached bones of the godless defenders.

Back over the bridge that had brought him here.

 

South.

 

Back into the waste.

 

Not in hope.

 

Not in anger.

 

But because pain was the only thing he had left.

And it would not let him rest.",8,1752550789.0,creepcast,1,1.0,False

The crunch of the ration bar was surprisingly soft, like a dry leaf underfoot, given the sheer scale of the creature consuming it. It ate slowly, deliberately, its glowing amber eyes still fixed on me, no longer frantic, but still holding that deep, unreadable curiosity. My breath, which I hadn't realized I'd been holding, finally escaped in a shaky gasp. It had worked. The crazy, suicidal gamble had actually paid off. The beast, the unkillable engine of destruction, was eating a glorified granola bar. I half-expected it to ask for a napkin.  
  
The relief that washed over me was so profound it almost buckled my knees. It was quickly replaced by a fresh wave of adrenaline, the kind that makes your scalp tingle. What now? I had its attention. I had its‚Ä¶ trust? Or at least, its momentary non-aggression. This was a first contact scenario that would make the history books, assuming there were any history books left after this thing was done. My mind, ever the scientist, was already trying to categorize this new data point: ""Alien Kaiju: Responds to snacks. Further testing required.""  
  
I took another tentative step forward, my hand still outstretched, palm open. ""Good,"" I murmured, the word feeling ridiculously inadequate. ""Good fella. You‚Ä¶ okay?"" I tried to keep my voice even, despite the internal screaming.  
  
The beast finished the bar, its massive head tilting again. It let out another low rumble, but this one felt different. Less like a question, more like a sigh, a deep, resonant exhalation that stirred the dust around its feet. And then, incredibly, it leaned forward. Its immense, scaled head, still radiating a low heat that felt like standing next to a dormant volcano, pressed gently against my outstretched palm. The chitin was rough, alien, like ancient, polished stone, yet the pressure was soft, deliberate. It was a gesture of contact, of acceptance, of something profoundly unexpected. My hand, so small against its colossal form, felt a strange warmth spread through it, a tingling sensation that wasn't unpleasant, but definitely unusual. Like my nerves were being gently rewired.  
  
And then, the shuddering began.  
  
It wasn't the subtle tremor I'd noticed before. This was violent, convulsive, a full-body seizure on a scale that defied physics. The beast's entire body began to ripple, its iridescent plates shifting and grinding with a sound like tectonic plates colliding, or a thousand glaciers cracking simultaneously. A low moan, a sound of profound agony, escaped its throat, a sound that was less a roar and more a desperate, tortured cry. The ground beneath us vibrated intensely, and I stumbled back, my heart leaping into my throat. The warmth in my hand intensified, becoming almost painful, a burning sensation that seemed to anchor me to the unfolding horror.  
  
The transformation was horrific to witness. Its multi-limbed form twisted and contorted, shrinking, folding in on itself. The chitinous plates seemed to melt and flow like liquid metal, reforming, reshaping. I could see bone and muscle shifting beneath the surface, a grotesque, organic ballet of impossible biology. Limbs retracted, mass consolidated, the very fabric of its being seemed to be tearing itself apart and stitching itself back together. It was like watching a building collapse and then reassemble itself into something entirely new, all at once, under immense, agonizing pressure. I wanted to look away, to shield my eyes from the raw, biological violence, but I couldn't. My xenobiologist's mind, despite the terror, was utterly captivated by the impossible process unfolding before me. The creature's cries intensified, raw and piercing, and a wave of profound sorrow washed over me. I felt a desperate, helpless urge to stop its pain, to offer comfort, but there was nothing I could do. It was a process too vast, too alien, for any human intervention.  
  
The process lasted only minutes, but it felt like an eternity. The monstrous form shrank, condensed, reformed, until where the behemoth had stood, there was now a figure. A bipedal figure. A woman.  
  
She was stunning. And utterly alien. Her skin was a pale, luminous blue, almost translucent in the Xylosian light, with faint, intricate patterns that seemed to shift beneath the surface, like currents in water, or the subtle glow of a nebula. Her face was exquisitely sculpted, with high cheekbones that caught the light, delicate, pointed ears that tapered gracefully, and a small, perfectly formed nose. Her lips were full, a deeper shade of blue, and slightly parted, revealing teeth that were human-like but with a faint, pearlescent sheen. And her eyes ‚Äì those large, almond-shaped eyes that were the same molten amber as the beast's ‚Äì now held a startling depth of intelligence, a hint of ancient wisdom, and a raw, vulnerable emotion that mirrored the pain of her transformation. Her eyebrows were thin, almost imperceptible arcs of a darker blue, framing eyes that seemed to absorb all light. Her hair, a cascade of shimmering silver, fine as spun moonlight, fell to her waist, catching the light like a living waterfall. Her limbs were long and graceful, ending in slender, elegant hands and feet, each finger tipped with a faint, opalescent nail.  
  
And she was naked. Completely, utterly, unapologetically naked. Her body was lean, athletic, yet curved in all the right places, a testament to a different evolutionary path. The blue skin was smooth, unblemished, and the intricate patterns that flowed across her torso and limbs seemed to pulse with a faint, internal light, drawing the eye. Her waist was impossibly narrow, flaring gently to hips that promised a supple strength. But the most striking differences, beyond the blue skin and exotic features, were her four distinct breasts, perfectly formed and arranged in a symmetrical pattern across her chest, each nipple a darker shade of blue, taut and inviting. They were alien, yes, but undeniably, powerfully feminine, a biological marvel that defied human expectation. The way her muscles flexed with each subtle shift of weight, the subtle sway of her hips as she adjusted her stance, spoke of a body honed by a different gravity, a different set of physical demands, yet perfectly adapted to its new bipedal form. There was no shame, no self-consciousness in her stance, only a quiet dignity, a primal confidence that made my own human awkwardness feel amplified.  
  
A flush of heat, entirely unrelated to the alien suns or the recent planetary-scale trauma, spread across my face. My scientific detachment, which had held up through a kaiju attack, the decimation of our security force, and an impossible metamorphosis, finally broke. I was standing in front of a beautiful, naked alien woman who had just been a planet-destroying monster. My brain, bless its logical little heart, immediately started running a whole new set of, frankly, embarrassing simulations, all of them involving me trying desperately not to stare, and failing miserably. This was not covered in any xenolinguistics textbook. Or any human decency manual, for that matter.  
  
She took a shaky step forward, her movements graceful despite her recent ordeal, her eyes fixed on mine with an intensity that bypassed all my internal panic. And then she spoke. Her voice was melodic, a series of liquid tones that seemed to resonate in the air, a sound that was both ancient and new, like wind chimes played by a cosmic symphony. But the words were broken, fragmented, like a child learning a new language, yet each syllable carried immense weight. ""Bond‚Ä¶ complete. I‚Ä¶ am‚Ä¶ yours.""  
  
My flush deepened, if that was even possible. ""Yours?"" I stammered, my own voice sounding rough and unrefined after her melodic tones, like a rusty hinge. The word felt too heavy, too possessive, too‚Ä¶ everything.  
  
She nodded, a slow, deliberate movement that sent her silver hair shimmering. ""Bond‚Ä¶ allows‚Ä¶ learn‚Ä¶ your‚Ä¶ language. Biological‚Ä¶ compatibility."" She gestured vaguely to herself, then to me, the movement fluid and unselfconscious. Her gaze lingered on my form for a moment, a fleeting assessment that made my skin prickle. ""I‚Ä¶ follow‚Ä¶ you. Protect‚Ä¶ from‚Ä¶ dangers."" Her gaze intensified, holding mine with an ancient, unwavering power, a promise and a demand rolled into one. ""You‚Ä¶ give‚Ä¶ offspring. Rebuild‚Ä¶ my‚Ä¶ race.""  
  
The silence that followed was different from the last. This wasn't the silence of despair, but the silence of a universe suddenly, irrevocably altered. My mind reeled. Offspring? Rebuild her race? I had just offered a granola bar to a confused monster, and now I was being asked to be the progenitor of an alien species. This was going to be a hell of a conversation to have with Commander Valerius. And my parents. And frankly, my therapist. If I ever saw one again.  
  
  
  
Chapter¬†4: A New Kind of Invasion  
  
The silence that followed Lyra's startling declaration wasn't the despairing kind, nor the terrified kind. This was the WTF just happened kind of silence, the kind that makes your internal monologue just flatline for a moment, then reboot with a thousand conflicting error messages. My brain, bless its logical little heart, was trying to process ""bond complete,"" ""biological compatibility,"" and ""give offspring to rebuild my race"" all at once, while simultaneously trying to ignore the fact that the speaker was a naked, blue, four-breasted alien woman who had, minutes ago, been a building-sized engine of destruction. It was a lot to unpack. A lot.  
  
""Offspring?"" I managed, my voice a squeak, barely audible over the ringing in my ears. ""Rebuild your‚Ä¶ race?""  
  
She nodded, her amber eyes wide and earnest, holding my gaze with an intensity that felt like a physical tether. ""Yes. My people‚Ä¶ they are few. They are‚Ä¶ gone. Almost. I am‚Ä¶ last."" Her melodic voice, though still broken, carried a profound sorrow that cut through the sheer absurdity of the situation. It was a raw, ancient grief, the weight of an entire dying species resting on her slender, blue shoulders. She took another step closer, her movements fluid, almost hypnotic, like water flowing over stone. The faint shimmer around her body seemed to intensify, and the intricate patterns on her pale blue skin pulsed with a subtle, alluring light, drawing my eye despite my best efforts to maintain a semblance of professional decorum. Her gaze was direct, unwavering, and intensely personal. It wasn't just a scientific request; it was a plea, delivered with an intimacy that made my skin prickle, a warmth spreading through me that had nothing to do with the Xylosian suns and everything to do with the unexpected connection.  
  
""You are‚Ä¶ warm,"" she murmured, reaching out a slender, elegant hand and gently tracing the line of my jaw. Her touch was feather-light, yet it sent a jolt through me, a strange, electric current that had nothing to do with fear and everything to do with‚Ä¶ well, that. Her fingers were long, delicate, tipped with those opalescent nails, and as they brushed my skin, a soft, almost purring sound emanated from deep within her chest, a low, resonant hum that vibrated through my own bones. ""The bond‚Ä¶ it feels‚Ä¶ good. Strong. When do we‚Ä¶ begin the mating process?"" The question was delivered with the same frank, innocent directness as asking for a weather report, utterly devoid of human social filters.  
  
I took a step back, not because I wanted to, but because my internal panic alarm was blaring like a klaxon. ""Right. The bond. Look, um, Lyra, we need to‚Ä¶ we need to get you some clothes."" I gestured vaguely towards the central hub, trying to put some distance between us, though she simply closed the gap again. Her proximity, combined with her question, was doing things to my nervous system that were definitely not covered in standard first-contact protocols. My scientific curiosity was battling a full-blown existential crisis and a very human blush. ""The colony. People. They're‚Ä¶ not used to‚Ä¶ this.""  
  
She tilted her head, a hint of confusion in her eyes, those amber pools reflecting my own flustered expression. ""Clothes? What are clothes?""  
  
""Fabric. To cover your body,"" I explained, feeling my face grow hot enough to boil water. ""It's‚Ä¶ a human custom. For modesty. And, you know, general public decency. We don't‚Ä¶ typically walk around naked.""  
  
She frowned, her delicate brows furrowing in genuine puzzlement, as if I'd suggested wearing a hat on my foot. She reached out again, her fingers brushing against the rough fabric of my shirt, then traced a line down my arm, her touch lingering. ""Modesty? This form‚Ä¶ it is natural. It is‚Ä¶ vulnerable. But strong. Why cover?"" She shuddered, a small, genuine shiver rippling through her lithe frame. ""This‚Ä¶ fabric. It feels‚Ä¶ rough. Irritates the skin. Like‚Ä¶ tiny needles. Uncomfortable."" Her gaze returned to mine, direct and unwavering. ""Why would I wear it? It would hinder my movements. And it would hide the bond."" She pressed closer, her hip brushing against mine, a soft, warm contact that made me acutely aware of her nakedness, and mine, by comparison, being very much clothed. Her body, perfectly sculpted, seemed to radiate a gentle heat, an invitation. ""When do we begin the mating process, Ethan Miller? The bond is strong. My people need offspring. Time is‚Ä¶ precious."" She pronounced my name with a soft, rolling cadence, making it sound entirely new, a personal connection already forged.  
  
I opened my mouth, then closed it. How do you explain millennia of social conditioning, modesty, and the general awkwardness of human sexuality to a creature that just underwent an instantaneous, painful metamorphosis from a kaiju and is now asking for biological compatibility like she's ordering a coffee? ""It's‚Ä¶ complicated,"" I finally managed, lamely. ""But for now, maybe just a sheet? Until we can find something that doesn't‚Ä¶ irritate?""  
  
She considered this, her head tilted, her eyes scanning my face as if searching for a hidden meaning. Then she shrugged, a graceful, fluid movement that rippled through her lithe form, causing those four breasts to subtly shift. ""If it pleases you, Ethan Miller. But it will be‚Ä¶ uncomfortable."" She didn't move away, however, remaining close, her warmth a constant presence, her amber eyes never leaving mine. It was clear she wasn't going to be convinced by arguments about decorum.  
  
Getting her to the central hub was an exercise in pure, unadulterated surrealism, a walk of shame and wonder. She walked beside me, utterly unconcerned by her nudity, her movements a mesmerizing blend of alien grace and newfound bipedalism. Every step felt like a gamble. Would Valerius shoot her on sight? Would the remaining colonists panic? Would I spontaneously combust from sheer embarrassment?  
  
They did. Both, almost.  
  
When we emerged from the shattered agricultural zone, the few remaining security personnel, led by a pale, shaken Commander Valerius, had their weapons trained on us. Or, more accurately, on her. Their faces were a mixture of fear, disbelief, and a profound, shell-shocked confusion. One young recruit actually fainted, collapsing in a heap, while another simply stared, mouth agape, his rifle slowly lowering.  
  
""Ethan! What in the name of all that's holy is that?!"" Valerius roared, his voice hoarse, his laser rifle steady, but his hand trembling. His eyes, however, kept darting to Lyra's form, then back to my face, as if trying to reconcile the impossible.  
  
""Stand down, Commander! She's not hostile!"" I yelled, stepping slightly in front of Lyra, a ridiculous shield against a creature that could still, presumably, level the entire colony. ""She's‚Ä¶ she's Lyra. And she's not what you think.""  
  
Lyra stepped around me, her amber eyes sweeping over the armed humans, a flicker of something ancient in their depths. She raised a hand, palm open, mirroring my earlier gesture. ""No threat,"" she said, her voice still broken, but carrying an undeniable authority, a resonance that seemed to quiet the air. ""I‚Ä¶ mean‚Ä¶ no harm. I‚Ä¶ was‚Ä¶ controlled."" As she spoke, she subtly shifted, her hip pressing against mine again, a silent, intimate reminder of her presence and her purpose.  
  
Valerius scoffed, his face a mask of disbelief, but his weapon wavered, just slightly. ""Controlled? By what, Miller? A bad dream? She just wiped out half our security force!""  
  
""They‚Ä¶ attacked,"" Lyra said, her gaze dropping to the ground where the remains of a crushed vehicle lay, then lifting back to meet Valerius's eyes. ""I‚Ä¶ felt‚Ä¶ pain. Confusion. They‚Ä¶ hurt me. I‚Ä¶ reacted. But I‚Ä¶ did not‚Ä¶ wish‚Ä¶ harm."" She looked back at Valerius, her eyes filled with a raw, alien sorrow, a genuine regret that was startling to behold. ""I‚Ä¶ am‚Ä¶ sorry.""  
  
The apology, delivered by the creature that had just devastated them, hung in the air. It was disarming, unsettling. Dr. Lena Petrova, the senior xenobiologist, emerged from behind Valerius, her face pale but her eyes alight with scientific curiosity, a flicker of the true researcher overcoming her fear. ""Controlled, you say? By whom?""  
  
Lyra turned to Lena, her expression hardening, the sorrow replaced by a grim determination that tightened the delicate lines of her face. ""The Vex. A race of‚Ä¶ conquerors. They‚Ä¶ found‚Ä¶ my people. Took‚Ä¶ us. Used‚Ä¶ our‚Ä¶ forms. For‚Ä¶ war. For‚Ä¶ destruction."" She clenched her delicate hands into fists, the opalescent nails gleaming. ""They‚Ä¶ control‚Ä¶ our‚Ä¶ minds. Our‚Ä¶ will. They‚Ä¶ seek‚Ä¶ to take‚Ä¶ galaxy. Through‚Ä¶ might. Through‚Ä¶ decimation. They‚Ä¶ are‚Ä¶ parasites. They‚Ä¶ are‚Ä¶ coming.""  
  
A ripple of murmurs went through the small group of colonists. This was a new level of bad. Not just a monster, but a harbinger. An explanation for the inexplicable.  
  
""Explain,"" Valerius demanded, his rifle still pointed, though slightly lowered, his mind clearly struggling to adapt to this new, terrifying paradigm. ""And why you transformed.""  
  
Lyra looked at me, her amber eyes softening, then back at the group, her expression holding a newfound, terrifying urgency. She leaned into me, her body a warm, smooth presence against my side, her voice dropping to a lower, more resonant hum that seemed to speak directly to my core. ""My people‚Ä¶ we are a race of pure energy, of consciousness. Our natural form‚Ä¶ it is fluid. We can‚Ä¶ inhabit‚Ä¶ and control‚Ä¶ other forms. For travel. For survival. But the Vex‚Ä¶ they captured us. Twisted us. Forced us into‚Ä¶ these monstrous‚Ä¶ vessels. To be their weapons. To be their‚Ä¶ engines of war. They bind us‚Ä¶ with their will. A cruel‚Ä¶ unbreakable‚Ä¶ control.""  
  
She paused, her gaze sweeping over the shattered colony. ""The bond‚Ä¶ with Ethan Miller. It is‚Ä¶ unique. A resonance. A connection of‚Ä¶ empathy. Of‚Ä¶ compassion. When he‚Ä¶ showed‚Ä¶ care‚Ä¶ instead of‚Ä¶ fear‚Ä¶ it broke‚Ä¶ the Vex‚Äôs hold. It shattered‚Ä¶ their control‚Ä¶ over my‚Ä¶ essence. It allowed‚Ä¶ my true‚Ä¶ self‚Ä¶ to emerge. To take‚Ä¶ a form‚Ä¶ compatible‚Ä¶ with his‚Ä¶ species. To be‚Ä¶ free."" She pressed closer to me, her hand finding mine and intertwining her fingers with mine. ""The bond‚Ä¶ it is‚Ä¶ deep. It is‚Ä¶ life-giving. It allows‚Ä¶ me to learn‚Ä¶ your thoughts‚Ä¶ your language‚Ä¶ your biology. It makes‚Ä¶ us‚Ä¶ compatible. For‚Ä¶ mating."" Her eyes, luminous and direct, met mine, then swept over the stunned faces of the colonists. ""The Vex‚Ä¶ they will feel‚Ä¶ this rupture. They will know‚Ä¶ one of their‚Ä¶ weapons‚Ä¶ is free. And they‚Ä¶ will not‚Ä¶ tolerate‚Ä¶ it. They will come. Not just for me. But for this‚Ä¶ colony. For you. To destroy‚Ä¶ what they‚Ä¶ cannot control.""  
  
A cold dread settled over the colonists. The casual destruction they had just witnessed was merely a preview.  
  
Lyra‚Äôs grip on my hand tightened, her gaze unwavering. ""But I‚Ä¶ I will not‚Ä¶ allow it. I am‚Ä¶ free. And I‚Ä¶ am‚Ä¶ bonded. I will‚Ä¶ protect‚Ä¶ Ethan Miller. And I will‚Ä¶ protect‚Ä¶ this colony. From the Vex. From all dangers. This is‚Ä¶ my purpose. Now. But we must‚Ä¶ begin the mating process. My race‚Ä¶ depends on it. Time is‚Ä¶ short.""  
  
The words hung in the air, a chilling prophecy interwoven with an impossibly intimate demand. The monster wasn't just a threat; she was a warning, a protector, and a desperate plea for survival. And the real invasion, the one we hadn't even seen coming, was now on its way. And it was all because I offered a granola bar to a giant, confused alien. My life just got a whole lot more complicated. And a whole lot more intimate, apparently.",1,1752550373.0,HorrorTalesCommunity,0,1.0,False

Hi friends. A little background. After living in our apartment for a little while we decided to paint the walls in our living room, see the attached picture. They were previously a dark gray which was particularly depressing since this room has no windows and only a very tiny sky light. It was dark all the time. I decided to go with warm yellow and we added the stripe in a gold color on a whim. We figured a monochrome look might be cool but now I am concerned that this is waaaaayyyy too much yellow and that is clashes with the terrible gray floors (we can't change those unfortunately since we are renting.  

What I need advice around is how to theme the other items in the room. We obviously need a new rug (the one seen here does not go at ALL), a new coffee table, throw pillows and art work. 

  
I was thinking navy blue/ cream tones in the rug? A dark wood or glass coffee table? Maybe other cool colors to tone down the yellow? 

Any help is greatly appreciated. Part of me is freaking out and wants to go back to gray before its too late! But I also wonder if we can figure out a way to salvage this room. ",2,1752550342.0,interiordecorating,6,1.0,False

So I go my new custom wheelchair in march of this year. Ive had a few issues now and then but mostly user error or that one time my smart drive tried to ~~kill~~ kindly eject me (story for another day). Recently I crashed while on my way to the train station by my house. the side walk all through my town are the actual worst I've broken TWO caster forks on my other wheelchairs just manually pushing down the block. anyways, during this fall one of my wheels popped out. me and my boyfriend spent a good 10 minutes pushing it back in and now I fully believe I broke /something/. the axel pin is my best guess.

tmmrw I will be unscrewing it from the base of my chair and seeing if I need a full replacement but hoping it just needs some adjusting. i tried already but didn't have a wrench small enough AND I tried to unscrew my casters to clean them but I think the screw started to strip so I stopped and put them back.

**ANYWAYS** sorry I ramble lol... **my question is**, if you do repairs like these yourself where did you get the parts ? I found the axel pin I think I need on DME hub but not sure where I could get the screws for the casters. i think screws is the right word but I'm not sure. the part that actually goes through the middle of the small wheels in the front.

I have a tilite aero z. any important spec info I can prob give I just don't know whats important or not.

How do I go about asking him out?","I know from the title I sound insane - and I am - but please hear me out before telling me to leave that man alone. Throwaway because I‚Äôd be mortified if a coworker found this. Also on mobile so please forgive me.



I (32F) work as a bus driver. We mostly work alone. Some days we may go a whole shift without talking to any of our coworkers, but we have a lot of designated rest time we can use to socialise if we wish.



Some drivers choose not to interact with others unless they have to. My coworker (\~30sM) is one of those people. He avoids even looking in someone‚Äôs direction when passing them in the hall, doesn‚Äôt enter the depot on breaks and instead goes to some secondary location to be alone, and won‚Äôt sit in our designated pickup area at the bus stops if another driver is also waiting there. All in all, it seems he wants to avoid any and all interaction with others. Which I know I should heed as a warning, but I digress.¬†



We have spoken very minimally a couple of times when we‚Äôve had to, and each time I've found myself ridiculously captivated by him. He‚Äôs very, very soft spoken, and doesn‚Äôt make a lot of eye contact; he has kind eyes though, and a gentleness about him. He always seems to be hiding underneath his jumper, like he doesn‚Äôt want to be perceived. But he just seems‚Ä¶ interesting to me. I‚Äôm curious about him.¬†



I‚Äôve asked my work friend about him as he's been on the job a lot longer than me, and she told me that he used to be pretty outgoing. He had some close workmates, and was just a nice, friendly guy to everyone. Something happened to him a few years back though and he just shut down, stopped talking to everyone, won‚Äôt even acknowledge his old friends unless he has to.¬†



So that kind of leads me to my predicament. I just can‚Äôt shake the feeling that he‚Äôs not avoiding everyone out of disdain but out of self preservation. I‚Äôd really like to get to know him - not necessarily in a romantic context (although I do find him insanely cute), but perhaps just as a human. The intuitive nudge I've been getting to go speak to him is getting stronger, and I think I either need to make the decision to speak to him or just forget the whole thing sooner rather than later. I feel like he could use a friend, and I‚Äôd really like to be his friend.¬†



I don‚Äôt want to make him uncomfortable though, and I‚Äôd like to avoid being called into HR as well, but i'd like to make my interest known and to ask him to hang out. I wouldn't do this if we worked in an office or something, but because I don't see him that regularly I figure that potentially embarrassing myself / weirding him out once and then leaving him alone wouldn't be so bad. I also feel like if I'm not creepy about it he would at least take it as a compliment even if he's not interested. I was thinking of maybe just writing my number down and telling him I‚Äôve seen him around and I‚Äôd like to get a coffee together and get to know him. But I‚Äôm quite hesitant, and I do acknowledge that everything about him is giving off a lone wolf vibe. I would love some advice on whether I should do this at all, and how I should go about it. Thank you.¬†



TL;DR - My (32F) coworker (30sM) doesn‚Äôt talk to anyone on the job. He used to be really kind and friendly, but shut down a few years back and now avoids people like the plague. I am insanely curious about him, and would very much like to get to know him. He looks like he could use one, and I do as well.

Hello again Potatos!!! I've got an AITA that's really got me puzzled (this all happened within the last 48 hours). I don't even really know how to start this so here it goes:

I am epileptic, have been for almost a decade now. 99.99% of the time I usually have Grand Mal seizures, and do my best to inform everyone that comes around me what to do when I have an episode. I also do my best to stay ontop of my medication to prevent anything from happening. Needless to say, everyone I live with (especially my family) have all be briefed on what to do when I do have an episode.

Two mornings ago, I woke up experiencing a seizure. When I started to re-gain consciousness, the scene before me traumatized me.

My mother was pinning me down by my shoulders, forcing me onto my back. All while she was yelling at me 4 inches from my face- not allowing me to try and sit up or calm down for a good 2 minutes. I couldn't speak two words because my tongue was caught in my throught. I felt scared, and unsafe. I couldn't breathe. Eventually, I got her to release me and leave my room. I did not feel comfortable in the house, or neer my mother.

I knew that if I tried to talk with her about it that she would become insulted and lash out at me, even though I was the one feeling traumatized and unsafe. Still: I wanted to try and communicate with her and see if she would prove me wrong so we could avoid problems like that in the future.

She didn't.

I started off by saying that what I had to say wasn't to insult her, but that I needed to talk about how she handled the episode. I tried to remind her the proper way to handle someone who's experiencing an episode, and how her actions made me feel traumatized and unsafe.

She tells me that what I'm saying isn't true/didn't happen - which really felt like a slap in the face considering that I was somewhat conscious (I'm assuming it was a breakthrough seizure, because I had taken my medication). I re-iterate what I remember happening, and she rolled her eyes at me like I was making up a story.

At this point - she states that she will no longer do anything when I have an epileptic episode. She will stay hands-off, and just leave me alone while she calls the cops. I told her that wasn't what I was trying to accomplish, but she just shook her head and walk away... completely disregarding my safety or my feelings.

I felt unheard... So - I went to Facebook. This is what I posted (copy and pasted exactly):

""""""I just tried to talk with someone about the way they handled my seizure and how it traumatized me. When I told them what they specifically did, they tried to gaslight me into saying that it didn't happen. When I tried to give tips on how to handle the next one, they got offended and said they wouldn't do anything to help me but call the cops next time, all while walking away...
Who the hell can say they care about someone with epilepsy when this is how you treat them? It's already a traumatizing experience - when you don't follow patient/emergency steps properly people can be seriously hurt.
Then to minimize the epileptic person's feelings/experience when they are just trying to work with you for a safer outcome??? THEIR LIFE AND WELL-BEING IS ON THE LINE.
TO CLARIFY:
When someone is experiencing a seizure, make sure that the person is layed ON THIER SIDE. When someone is seizing, it is REALLY EASY for their airways to become blocked: DO NOT FORCE THEM TO LAY ON THIER BACK - THIS SHALLOWS BREATHING ALONG WITH POSSIBLE AIRWAY OBSTRUCTION.
DO NOT CONSTRICT THE SEIZING PERSON'S MOVEMENTS!!! You could cause them damage due to their involuntary/uncontrollable spasms, or even vise-versa. JUST DO YOUR BEST TO MAKE SURE THEY ARE ON THEIR SIDE AND BREATHING - DO NOT FORCE THEM DOWN ON THEIR BACK OR HOLD THEM DOWN BY THEIR SHOULDERS.
Use a rolled up towel or a folded belt to push in between their teeth if necessary, moving their tongue out of the way of their teeth. DO NOT USE YOUR FINGERS: THEY WILL BE UNINTENTIONALLY BITTEN OFF!!!!
If the seizure last longer than 1.5 minutes - CALL AN AMBULANCE.
Lastly: DO NOT YELL AT SAID SEIZING PERSON. They WILL NOT be able to respond to you - or really work with you in ANY WAY. Yelling does NOTHING to help - and can further stress an already traumatizing experience. All you can do is be there for the person and make sure they don't choke, either for a short seizure or until medical assistance arrives at the scene. Just. Breathe. If you don't, they can't.
I hope this post helps people have a little more of an understanding of what to do if someone has a seizure. Seizures are traumatic for everyone involved - and the epileptic person really has to rely on others for their safety.
Thank you to everyone who reads this - for my own safety and for the safety of others like me.""""""""

No mention of who improperly handled it, but I had pleanty of people in the comments saying that whoever the person was - they weren't my friend. I also had my mother on restricted access to my Facebook. I HAD considered taking her off completely this morning - but decided against it.

I left it at that - and went to go pick up things for my cat.

I come home to a note on my door telling me that my mother will be getting rid of the outside fridge- the one I use. I also got blocked on Facebook as well, because ""I brought it to Facebook"". I confronted her, and she tells me that I am ungrateful, that the people in the comments have no idea what happened. That what I experienced first-hand isn't what happened, and that she did nothing wrong.

I told her this was the last time she will be blocking me. That her behavior was outrageous and immature, and that she did not listen to anyone. I told her I feel unsafe and unheard.

At this point, I have blocked her from everything, not beforeshe blocked ME on Facebook. Once she moves out of this house the only time we (would possibly) be spending together is at a public coffee shop.

hello! I (28f) have been dealing with heartburn for now half my life. I also will add besides my stomach issues I consider myself pretty healthy and don‚Äôt drink or do drugs. It started at 13/14- I remember suddenly getting this awful, nauseating burning sensation in my throat near nighttime every single night after throwing up on a family vacation. as someone with emetaphobia, this feeling was anxiety-inducing. it took a couple months until we figured out it was not anxiety, but acid reflux. for the next year I took Prevacid every single day. 

one odd day when I forgot to take my meds, poof! my acid reflux stopped. still the oddest occurrence to me. from then until basically 2 years ago, I really only got heartburn- never acid reflux again- and it was only from certain foods. however other symptoms of my tummy issues included not being able to burp and throat gurgles. it‚Äôs just something I‚Äôve dealt with. 

now 2 years ago, my heartburn just became persistent. before then, when I got heartburn, it would last the day, Alka-seltzer would be taken, and I would most likely be fine the next day. but all the sudden I was getting heartburn again every single day no matter what I ate. so I decided to be brave and go to a gastroenterologist. an endoscopy later and some Famotidine prescribed, nothing seemed out of the ordinary. 

to be honest the past year might of been the best year for my stomach. I have eaten as healthier as ever, I started working out, and I barely have taken any medications. I do notice I have indigestion- the type where your stomach is tricking you into still being hungry- but besides that it wasn‚Äôt any major heartburn, until the past 2 weeks. 

I just feel like I don‚Äôt even know if this is heartburn anymore. the pain is in my upper stomach, when I push down it feels like there‚Äôs this bubble. sometimes the pain will go all the way down and make me feel like I have gas pains as well. I get hot flashes, I can barely function sometimes and need to just lay down, THE BLOATING is just ruining my self image, and I can barely eat sometimes. it hasn‚Äôt been like this everyday, but every single day for the past 2 weeks I get some form of heartburn. I had it on my birthday, I feel like I can‚Äôt even work some days, and I‚Äôm just hopeless. I‚Äôve been taking my Famotidine again daily and avoiding my usual trigger foods but nothing helps. 

I‚Äôm writing on here because 1) I‚Äôm so tired of people around me who haven‚Äôt experienced this pain trying to tell me what to avoid or what to do.. like yes I don‚Äôt eat that no I don‚Äôt drink that like omg. ‚Äúdo you drink coffee‚Äù yes I do because some days I can drink 3 cups of coffee and my stomach is fine and then others it doesn‚Äôt matter what I eat or drink. & 2) I genuinely need to know if anyone has experienced something at least like this. I‚Äôm hopeful it‚Äôll go away again but right now it sucks and has affected my life way more than I want to. 

I will admit I have been stressed and my mental health hasn‚Äôt been perfect these past two weeks,  and I do always think my stomach gets affected by this. but I get nervous when my heartburn gets this bad because my grandma has stomach cancer, I don‚Äôt have health insurance, and the meds don‚Äôt help. 

so yeah .. that‚Äôs pretty much it! I guess I‚Äôm just looking for a little more hope and some relatability. thank you in advance ü´∂üèº

I was going through old family photos and came across this picture of my great grandparents‚Äô first car. I initially posted on r/oldcars for guidance on identifying make and model. There wasn‚Äôt really a consensus other than thinking it may likely have been a custom make. Unfortunately, there was no writing in the back of the image so the details i have about it are slim. After discussing with family, I learned a few more details. This is what I know about the car, if helpful:

- make was a studebaker
- picture was taken in New England likely pre 1920
- car was purchased as a used car
- car was purchased used from either Chase or Sanborn of the Chase and Sanborn coffee company 

Wondering if anyone has any thoughts on what year this car may be/ the model or if it may have been a custom car? I would‚Äôve thought that to be unusual for the time but I suppose the people they bought it off of would have had the means to have a custom car at the time?

Whether it is now or someone in the distant future, Googling symptoms and wondering if they'll ever find support, I hope what I have learned is supportive in any way! I'm going to try my best to only include details that are relevant. 

Since I first got my period at 13, I've never had one regularly. I went through most of my teens and 20s only getting a period every 6-9 months. The gynecologists I'd see in my teens would always recommend going on birth control, and I just didn't like the idea of going on something when essentially no one could give my 16-year-old self a clear answer for why this was happening in the first place. I had some success in my 20s with homeopathic medicine and then with Ayurveda. I want to note that many of the herbs, foods, and routines I learned from Ayurveda are still supportive to this day for managing PCOS. When I went to an endocrinologist in 2017, my labs and symptoms did not meet the criteria for PCOS. This white woman also attributed my excessive hair growth to my race, and likely not PCOS. (Gotta love medical racism!)

By my late 20s and early 30s, the missed periods returned. This time, I also gained 30 lbs that simply would not budge, or go away only to return. I noticed my hair thinning by my mid 30s, really starting around the pandemic. At the time I made no connection. 

Last year, a new layer: I found two alopecia areata patches. That was one of the most horrific periods simply because no one, literally no doctor, seemed to want to take time to really understand what was going on. While cortisol shots were incredible and literally the only thing that helped regrow hair, I hit a breaking point. Reading many posts on Reddit, researching online, ChatGPT/Claude, I finally made the decision to see an integrative medicine doctor in May. I was committed to getting every possible lab needed and really taking my time. After over two decades, I wanted to finally get to as close to a real solution and path forward as possible.

A friend recommended I try intermittent fasting. On a whim, I went ahead and tried. Within 2 weeks of fasting, I got my period. I knew when I went to see the doctor I wanted to bring this up and if it could mean all my symptoms were PCOS-related after all.

Since then, it's been this cascade of prayers answered, concrete evidence, a tremendously supportive doctor guiding the way, and the path forward I wanted all along! Some highlights:  
\-Labs showed that my ferritin was extremely low at 15L (this thread was so, so helpful for understanding why!), very low omega-3 fatty acids  
\-My doctor was concerned I may have celiac disease, testing ruled this out (but important to check out!)  
\-Notably, I did not have any markers for autoimmune conditions  
\-My doctor now has me on the following supplements: inositol (I use Ovasitol brand), Vitamin D, NAC, iron biglycinate (ferrous, chelated, I got from Thorne), omega-3 fish oil, magnesium glycinate (sleep! finally!)  
\-My doctor and I are big fans of ""culinary medicine"": I cut out all processed food, only eat whole foods, rich in chromium (Green beans, oranges, apples, broccoli, garlic, onions, bananas, grapes, Brazil nuts, sunflower seeds, amonds, faxseeds, eggs), anthocyanins (red, blue, purple hues: Black beans, purple sweet potatoes, black and wild rice, blueberries, blackberries, raspberries, red cabbage, plums, prunes, purple carrots); flavonols (onions, kale, broccoli, spinach, apple, garlic, leeks, scallions, green tea, capers); I only drink green tea in the mornings  
\-I measured my body composition and metabolic rate in office; the conclusion was to keep calories at 1500/my maintenance rate and to focus physical activity on yoga + weight-lifting (total 150 minutes/week), and walking/10k steps a day  
\-I'm using the Cronometer app to track my macros and this dietary plan  
\-I'll be in a group using continuous glucose monitors (CGMs) this fall; while we also eliminated insulin resistance as a cause, understanding my metabolism felt helpful; it's also covered by my health insurance

I've lost 18 lbs and have 17lbs to go before I hit my target weight. Most of this has been from  fasting, calorie counting (\~1500, even before seeing my doctor), and dietary changes. Inositol has been a game changer--I don't even feel like I need the 2+ cups of coffee a day I needed to function! The iron, we hope, will help address my hair loss. I was prescribed Spironolactone by a dermatologist and will remain on it for now, but hope in 1-2 years I can get off this if all these changes help address my hair loss.

I am hopeful this will be helpful for me! My doctor seems very optimistic after my initial labs and scans came in. Happy to answer any questions and messages! 

I continue to feel grateful for this community. It truly saved my mental health during some of the darkest days, which can come up even now while I munch on raddish...lol

## Key Features Analysis

The best tea candies distinguish themselves through a combination of factors, including the quality of tea used, the balance of sweetness, the texture, and the overall flavor profile.

**Authentic Tea Flavor:** The hallmark of a great tea candy is its ability to capture the true essence of the tea it represents.

The best candies use high-quality, finely ground tea leaves or concentrated tea extracts to deliver an authentic and nuanced flavor experience. This means you should be able to clearly identify the type of tea ‚Äì whether it's the floral notes of jasmine, the earthy tones of matcha, or the briskness of black tea. Artificial flavorings often result in a candy that tastes generic and lacks the depth of real tea.

**Balanced Sweetness:** Achieving the right level of sweetness is crucial for a satisfying tea candy.

Too much sugar can mask the delicate flavors of the tea, while not enough can leave the candy tasting bitter or bland. Expert candy makers carefully calibrate the sweetness to complement the tea's natural characteristics, creating a harmonious balance that enhances the overall experience. The best tea candies use natural sweeteners like honey or agave to add complexity and avoid an overly sugary taste.

**Smooth and Pleasant Texture:** The texture of a tea candy plays a significant role in its enjoyment.

Whether it's a hard candy, a chewy gummy, or a creamy caramel, the texture should be smooth, consistent, and free of any grittiness or stickiness. A well-crafted tea candy melts evenly in the mouth, releasing its flavors gradually and providing a satisfying sensory experience. The use of high-quality ingredients and precise manufacturing processes are essential for achieving the ideal texture.

**Natural Ingredients:** Many consumers now prefer products made with natural ingredients.

Tea candies that prioritize natural ingredients, such as real tea leaves, natural sweeteners, and plant-based colors, are generally considered superior. These ingredients not only contribute to a better flavor profile but also align with health-conscious consumers‚Äô preferences. Avoiding artificial flavors, colors, and preservatives enhances the overall appeal of the candy.

Key features of the best tea candies include:

*   Authentic tea flavor
*   Balanced sweetness
*   Smooth and pleasant texture
*   Natural ingredients

## Core Benefits

Tea candy offers several benefits beyond just being a sweet treat. It can provide a convenient and enjoyable way to experience the flavors of tea, offer a subtle energy boost, and even provide some of the antioxidant benefits associated with tea.

**Convenient Tea Experience:** Tea candy provides a portable and mess-free way to enjoy the taste of tea anytime, anywhere.

Unlike brewing a cup of tea, tea candy requires no preparation or cleanup. It's perfect for on-the-go consumption, whether you're commuting to work, traveling, or simply craving a tea-flavored treat. The individually wrapped candies are easy to carry in your pocket or bag, making them a convenient option for a quick and satisfying tea fix.

**Subtle Energy Boost:** Certain tea candies, particularly those made with matcha or black tea, can provide a mild energy boost.

The caffeine content in these teas can help to improve focus and alertness without the jitters or crash associated with coffee. Tea candy can be a great alternative for those looking for a gentler and more sustained energy boost throughout the day. The combination of caffeine and sugar provides a quick pick-me-up that can help you power through your afternoon slump.

**Potential Antioxidant Benefits:** Tea is known for its antioxidant properties, and some of these benefits may be retained in tea candy.

While the concentration of antioxidants in tea candy is likely to be lower than in brewed tea, it can still contribute to your overall antioxidant intake. Antioxidants help to protect your body against free radicals, which can damage cells and contribute to aging and disease. Choosing tea candies made with high-quality tea leaves can maximize the potential antioxidant benefits.

## FAQs Section

Here are some frequently asked questions about tea candy:

**What types of tea are commonly used in tea candy?**

Matcha, black tea, green tea, jasmine tea, and oolong tea are among the most popular choices for tea candy. Each tea imparts a unique flavor profile to the candy, ranging from the earthy and slightly bitter notes of matcha to the floral and aromatic qualities of jasmine tea. The specific type of tea used will depend on the desired flavor and the brand's preferences.

**Are tea candies suitable for people with allergies?**

It depends on the specific ingredients used in the candy. Some tea candies may contain common allergens such as dairy, soy, or nuts. It's essential to carefully read the ingredient list before consuming tea candy, especially if you have known allergies. Many brands now offer allergy-friendly options, such as vegan or gluten-free tea candies.

**How should tea candy be stored to maintain its freshness?**

Tea candy should be stored in a cool, dry place away from direct sunlight and heat. This will help to prevent the candy from melting, becoming sticky, or losing its flavor. An airtight container is recommended to protect the candy from moisture and humidity. Properly stored tea candy can typically last for several months without significant degradation in quality.

\- Single, male, mid-thirties

\- Not the big party type, but do enjoy the occasional night life, low key bars and lounges. Not into the big tourist traps.

\- Enjoy working out and proximity to gyms, as well as some 'healthy food options' other than fast food. Love me some Thai food!

\- Really enjoy cafe culture, and love working from coffee shops from time to time

\- Walkability is very important for me

\- Not into anything super posh or these band new super sleek condos. A decent modern facility will suffice.

\- Love a nice vibe: friendly, fun, with nice dash of culture. 

  
Thanks in advance!.

The air was thick with the scent of saltwater and the faint hint of sunscreen. Juliet Skye, barefoot and clad in a tiny denim shorts and an oversized tee, was dancing to the rhythm of the waves crashing against the shore. Her laughter, as bright and carefree as the sunlight, filled the room. 

Noah Sinclair, lounging on the nearby couch, watched her with a mix of amusement and something deeper. His eyes lingered on her, taking in the way her hair danced in the breeze and the way her eyes sparkled with joy. He was a master at hiding his feelings, but the way his fingers drummed against the armrest betrayed his growing restlessness. 

As Juliet spun around, her eyes meeting his, he flashed a playful grin, ""You know, I've never seen anyone enjoy dancing to the sound of waves quite like you do."" She laughed, her cheeks flushing slightly, ""Well, Noah, maybe that's because I'm not like anyone you've ever met.""

As Juliet's laughter faded, she noticed Noah's gaze had shifted from her face to her bare feet. She followed his line of sight, her cheeks flushing a deeper shade of pink. ""You know, I've always been a barefoot girl,"" she said, her voice soft and playful. ""It's like I can feel the earth beneath me, even when I'm just standing still."" Noah chuckled, his eyes meeting hers again. ""Well, Juliet, I've never met a girl who can make wearing socks seem like a crime."" 

He leaned forward, his hand brushing against hers as he reached for the coffee mug on the table. Their fingers lingered for a moment, the contact sending a jolt through them both. Juliet's eyes widened slightly, but she didn't pull away. Instead, she smiled, her voice barely above a whisper, ""Maybe it's not the socks, Noah. Maybe it's just you.""

As the sun dipped below the horizon, painting the sky with hues of orange and pink, Noah and Juliet found themselves on the patio, glasses of wine in hand. The air was cool, a gentle breeze carrying the scent of the ocean. 

Juliet, her feet bare, kicked back in her chair, her eyes sparkling with mischief. ""You know, Noah,"" she began, a playful smile tugging at her lips, ""I've always wondered about you. Are you one of those guys who thinks about sex all the time?"" Noah choked on his wine, a laugh escaping him. ""Well, Juliet, I'm not sure if thinking about sex all the time is a good thing or not,"" he replied, his eyes meeting hers. ""But I can tell you that I've never had to think about it when I'm with you."" Juliet leaned in, her voice dropping to a conspiratorial whisper, ""You probably haven't even looked at me that way, have you, Noah? Like you really see me."" Noah's breath hitched, his gaze dropping to her lips. 

He was about to respond when the sound of a car pulling up in the driveway interrupted them. ""That's Mom,"" Juliet said, her voice tinged with disappointment. As they heard the front door open, Noah and Juliet exchanged a look, the moment lost but the tension still lingering. They both lay awake that night, their minds racing, their bodies awake, the taste of wine and the feel of each other's breath still fresh in their minds.

As the sun began to rise, Juliet found herself drawn to the sound of the ocean, her bare feet padding softly on the wooden floor as she made her way to the patio. The air was cool, the morning mist clinging to her skin as she stepped outside. She leaned against the railing, her eyes scanning the horizon as the first light of day painted the sky. A soft smile played on her lips as she thought about the night before, the tension between her and Noah still lingering in her mind.

I go to the gym about four times a week. I keep to myself, get my workout in, and head out. I'm not really there to socialize. But one day, while zoning out between sets, I noticed a guy nearby staring at me. Our eyes met ‚Äî cue the classic polite smile-nod combo ‚Äî and that became our unspoken ritual every time we crossed paths. He was always there.

Weeks passed, and one day after using the massage chairs in the rest area, I let out a dramatic, blissed-out sigh. When I opened my eyes, there he was ‚Äî sitting next to me. I jumped a little, apologized for the noise, and he used that as his opportunity to strike up a conversation. ‚ÄúHow was your workout? Leaving already? Do you usually come at this time?‚Äù I gave short answers, caught off guard, and left quickly, embarrassed.

Then life got in the way and I didn‚Äôt go back to the gym for about two months. When I returned, I noticed something interesting: every time I‚Äôd head for the massage chairs at the end of my workout, he‚Äôd suddenly wrap up his workout too ‚Äî and end up right next to me. He always made conversation, asked personal questions, and seemed excited to learn more about me. When I told him I was Latina, he broke out in Spanish and started tossing in compliments. He casually asked if I had ‚Äúany dependents‚Äù ‚Äî a clumsy but obvious probe into my relationship and parental status.

Honestly? I was flattered. The attention felt good. He was charming and funny, and though I clocked that he was probably younger, I brushed it off. (I‚Äôm notoriously bad at guessing ages, and Asians always look young ‚Äî sigh.)

For weeks, it became a flirty cat-and-mouse game. He‚Äôd greet me loudly in Spanish, toss me a compliment across the room, wink. It was all playful, light, and public ‚Äî enough to draw the attention of people nearby. And yeah‚Ä¶ I started to play along. I laughed, I flirted back, I sought him out a little.

Then came yesterday.

I was walking on the treadmill when he hopped onto the one next to me. We talked for an hour. And that‚Äôs when something shifted. The conversation got deeper‚Ä¶ or so I thought. He started talking about astrology (which I love), guessed my sign (‚ÄúWhat are you, an Aquarius or something?‚Äù ‚Äî nailed it), mentioned music I liked, and knew my Chinese zodiac.

He complimented me nonstop. ‚ÄúYou always look so nice. Your nails are immaculate. I can tell you take care of yourself.‚Äù And yet‚Ä¶ every time I asked him something about his own life, he expertly dodged it. Evasive. Vague. Practiced.

Eventually, I got fed up. ‚ÄúI‚Äôm not continuing this conversation until you tell me how old you are and what you do for work.‚Äù

He smiled.

‚ÄúI‚Äôm 19,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúAnd I‚Äôm a sugar baby.‚Äù

I blinked. WHAT?

He laughed and explained how it works ‚Äî that he has five sugar mamas who each give him a monthly allowance. He broke it all down like it was just another career path.

Still joking, still flirty.

He asked for my number so we could grab a coffee. I gave it ‚Äî mostly out of shock, and also because I didn‚Äôt want to cause a scene. I figured I‚Äôd text him later and shut it down gently.

But something didn‚Äôt sit right. I couldn‚Äôt shake the feeling that I‚Äôd been played. So I opened up Tinder ‚Äî an app I rarely use ‚Äî and started scrolling through the profiles that had liked me over the past few months. And there it was.

A shirtless torso. Abs front and center. The profile said he was into short-term fun, spoke English, Tagalog, and Spanish, and that he was a Virgo. My gut said it was him. And then I remembered: my profile says I‚Äôm an Aquarius. It says my love language is words of affirmation. It lists the music I love. It even says I‚Äôm into astrology.

Suddenly everything clicked.

This wasn‚Äôt a chance flirtation. This was a strategy. He had studied me. He used the gym as his hunting ground ‚Äî not to work out (come to think of it, I‚Äôve never actually seen him lift anything heavy), but to recruit. And I had been one of his targets.

He had been laying the groundwork for months. Complimenting me, making me feel seen, mirroring my interests. It wasn‚Äôt just attention ‚Äî it was manipulation designed to sell me on his services without ever naming the price.

I won‚Äôt lie. It stung.

Already feeling a little down about myself, the realization that I had been viewed as a potential client, not a person, felt like a punch to the gut. It made me question everything ‚Äî my desirability, my age, my worth.

But also? It was kind of hilarious.

So here‚Äôs what I plan to do.

Next time I see this baby-faced businessman, I‚Äôm going to return the energy ‚Äî loud and proud, just like he was when he complimented me in front of a crowd. I‚Äôll walk up and say:

‚ÄúHey big money! Doing business as usual? Closed any deals today? Or are you heading to the retirement home next? I still can‚Äôt believe you tried to add me to your portfolio!‚Äù

Will I actually do it? We‚Äôll see.

But one thing‚Äôs for sure ‚Äî I‚Äôm walking into that gym with my head held high. Not because of his attention, but because I saw through the illusion, laughed, and chose to walk away with my power (and dignity) intact.",1,1752548442.0,dating_advice,1,1.0,False

1m06lag,https://www.reddit.com/r/birthcontrol/comments/1m06lag/my_partner_gave_me_plan_b_without_consent/,My Partner gave me Plan B without consent,"I‚Äôm sorry in advance this is so long. I need advice. I am spiraling but not sure if I‚Äôm overreacting. I (27F) have been with my now fianc√© (26M) for about 10 years, since high school. We live together now and, for context, I was recently laid off from my job but he makes decent enough money that he‚Äôs able to support us with his income. 

I love kids. I‚Äôve always known I wanted kids but my fianc√© wants to wait another year or two. I‚Äôve agreed that‚Äôs smarter but sometimes I joke around about just having a baby now.

A lot of my friends have kids, and since I was recently laid off, I started babysitting my friend‚Äôs 1 year old baby for a few days out of the week for some extra cash. I think doing this has given me some baby fever. 

Saturday night, I ended up having a conversation with my fianc√© about this and crying to him just explaining that I don‚Äôt think any amount of nannying or babysitting will fill the hole in my heart for wanting to be a mom, and how I really want to just go for it and have a baby. He said he really would like us to wait a year or two still. We talked some more and that was that.

The next day, Sunday, he we had unprotected sex. During sex, I told him to not pull out, and he didn‚Äôt. I am not on birth control and he knows this. I told him afterwards I was excited at the possibility of us being pregnant and he just smiled. We went about our night like normal. I will say I was up for a while thinking about what if this was a stupid mistake and we‚Äôre really not ready? But I decided I was overthinking and went to sleep. 

The next morning I woke up to my fianc√© surprising me with coffee, and some AZO pills (I had mentioned some discomfort the night before and thought I might have a UTI). So he brings me coffee and my AZO pills + some extra vitamins in a little bowl for me to take, like vitamin D and something else. I take them without thinking anything of it. 
He leaves for work, and I continue about my morning at home. I got to thinking, and I thought it was odd that he brought me the pills and vitamins basically on a platter because he had never done that before. The more I thought about it, the more I remembered our conversation from Saturday night and how he was really hesitant on having a baby. I started to spiral and I had a weird feeling he may have given me a Plan B.  

Because I knew he had gone to target, I knew I could check the target app for recent purchases. 
Long story short, I eventually get the target app password and I login, and sure enough there‚Äôs a plan B pill in the purchase from this morning.
I‚Äôm immediately sick to my stomach. I text him and ask if he gave me a Plan B this morning. He said ‚Äúno, it‚Äôs in my car though. I wanted to talk about it later today‚Äù and I immediately knew it was a lie. He called me, and I told him to send me a picture of the Plan B in his car because I didn‚Äôt believe him. Then he says ‚Äúit‚Äôs not in my car.‚Äù I said, ‚Äúwhere is it?‚Äù And he was silent. I said ‚Äúyou gave it to me?‚Äù And he said ‚Äúyes.‚Äù I immediately started hyperventilating sobbing and hung up. 
He tried to leave work early come home and ‚Äútry to make things right‚Äù. I told him not to come home and to go to his parent‚Äôs house because I don‚Äôt want to see him. He‚Äôs respected my boundaries and he‚Äôs not here.

What do I do? This feels like such a huge breach of trust. I feel like, if he didn‚Äôt want to risk me getting pregnant, he could have pulled out. I didn‚Äôt force him to. I told him to during intercourse and he did, so it was consensual. But him giving me the Plan B was completely un-consensual - and what if I were to never check the target app? Would he have just never told me? 

I also feel like if he was feeling regretful, he could have talked to me this morning or after work and we could have made this decision together, but now I feel disgusting and violated. How could someone I love so deeply and trust with my life just do something so sneaky?

It hurts because I‚Äôve been with him for 10 years and he‚Äôs been the sweetest most loving partner. I just feel so betrayed and I‚Äôm trying to figure out if we can work this out or if I need to break things off, or am I being dramatic by thinking this is worth ending the relationship over?

I typically have a bunch of coffee beans in my deep freezer ( I like hoarding beans) and I have found this the best way to store beans.

I love dialing in my espresso shots ( atleast two with different levels every morning, to check the best options)

I have switched from cappuccinos to black coffee, but ( unpopular opinion) I like having an espresso shot with ice and water, so something like an iced Long black. 

Coming to my present topic, I enjoy light and medium roasts and wanted to make shots that I can enjoy hot ( at home) or take a long black to office. 

I stumbled on a Scott Rao post in Espresso subreditt, that suggested using higher temperature, slightly higher weight of beans, and longer extraction time, with a 1:2.5/1:3 ratio.

my partner (21m) & i (22f) have our first apartment together in a very populated city. it‚Äôs a nicer area and our neighbors seem to be kind people. 

well, there‚Äôs an older lady who lives directly beneath us who has called the police on us twice. she claims that she smells drugs as if we are cooking them, specifically meth. we obviously don‚Äôt do that. the officers seem to be irritated and say that they‚Äôd be able to smell it from the sidewalk if that was the case. we actually had one officer tell us that it looked and smelled nice in here lol. 

for some context: we don‚Äôt know this lady. she never introduced herself. the only time we‚Äôve had an interaction with her is when she came outside during the night and pointed at what was clearly a star in the sky and said ‚Äúi think those are drones surveilling the complex‚Äù, to which i politely said ‚Äúi think that‚Äôs either a star or maybe a planet up there‚Äù. we‚Äôve noticed other little things about her that are concerning such as; tape on her car doors, she rarely leaves her apartment, if she‚Äôs seen outside she‚Äôs usually in a robe & pjs, and she usually has her door ‚Äúbarricaded‚Äù as we say. because there‚Äôs literally a coffee table, chair, and a few big plants crowded in front of her door. we don‚Äôt know how old she is but if i had to guess, maybe mid 60‚Äôs-70‚Äôs. my partner said he walked past her door one day and got a glimpse of the inside of her apartment and it was covered in clutter, medicine bottles, and blankets on everything. 

sooo she seems to be mentally unstable in my opinion. we don‚Äôt smell ‚Äúcooking meth‚Äù nor do we smell anything else. we don‚Äôt even drink. 

it is embarrassing for us to have the police at our door and neighbors potentially speculating things. we don‚Äôt know if she‚Äôs going around telling people stuff. it is especially annoying when i‚Äôm trying to have a relaxing evening and next thing you know there‚Äôs banging at my door from the cops. i am a survivor of abuse so hearing the loud knocking or seeing the police terrifies me. 

we are going up to the office in the morning to complain. i would like to know how/if we can prevent this. would it seem threatening to her if i tried talking to her about this or should i avoid her? and isn‚Äôt it illegal to make false reports to the police? is it worth calling for a welfare check on her? and when does this become defamation of character or harassment?

1m06icb,https://www.reddit.com/r/creepcast/comments/1m06icb/hurricane_helene_and_helter_skelter/,Hurricane Helene and Helter Skelter,"Lights flashed from the hundreds of monitors that array out like a theater under the massive screen of the military control center that played the evening news. Smaller screens littered the side walls with various apps that showed icons of the many units deployed to the mountains of North Carolina.

Uniformed bodies rush to and fro, gathering around phone lines, clattering on keyboards, and murmuring to each other in hushed and hurried conversation.

""Attention to JOC!"" Rings out the voice of God, as a young Captain's voice shakes into his desktop microphone.

""Attention to JOC,"" echoes from the rest of the voices as their heads snap up to the screen that has now been split in two with a muted newscast as the anchor continues their report in front of a ruined mountain town, the night forest looming. The other half of the screen now showing the master map and zoomed in to the icon of 57th Engineer Company, next to it a red 67/82.

""Captain Caldwell reports that eleven of eleven squads have returned from search patrol three. Reduced visibility from the lunar cycle has severely hampered search efforts and squad leaders are reporting that even with their night vision devices, visibility in the forest is too dense to continue their search through the night.""

""Sir,"" an older voice follows up seamlessly. ""Castle 6 is also reporting that there's a group of 3-6 men who have lit fires around their landing zone. Alpha Troop had to be waved off last second. They're attempting to make contact with the men but have had no luck chasing them down. He's in contact with the local Sheriff but he also has his hands full with those men who attacked 618th company when they tried to start their foot movement to help with the search. He's belligerent that the company isn't allowed to walk through his property.

""Are you fucking kidding me?!"" the Commanding General blurt out, interrupting his sip from what looks like cold coffee. He's still in his PT uniform, despite it being 0200. Everyone in their seats is on shift work, but you can tell that he's been answering phone calls from the Pentagon since yesterday morning.

The older voice of the Colonel continued, ""The Sheriff wants to help because that's the only tenable pass over the mountain with how the roads are, but legally, the old man is right. He didn't even have to call in for a lawyer, the magistrate let him out without bond once they got to the courthouse. The deputies have the man's property blocked off and even threatened to arrest 618th's Commander for attempting to continue movement when the Sheriff left with that man.""

""Is this the fucking 70's? What on earth is going on up there? I have five Soldiers go missing and then these fucking hillbillies start treating us like we're marching Ruby Ridge when we try to go looking for them! I haven't even told their fucking families yet because the Pentagon is so concerned with the PR surrounding our presence there! Get Captain Caldwell and Castle 6 on the phone. You have five minutes. We ARE NOT stopping this search, I don't give a fuck what his NCOs think. We will rip open the gates of hell before I have to call any of those Soldier's families.""

""Sir, Castle 6 just messaged back. He's managed to negotiate with the property owner, but he's adamant that 618th is not allowed to use the speakers they brought to help with their search.""

After the tense phone call the General had with those two they split the squads and had one half bed down immediately, the other half was going back out after a quick rest and chow break. They'd swap after six hours so there was no lapse in coverage during the search.

If you've never used them before, NODs (night optic device) take in infrared light from the moon and use that to let you see. This means that there's no color distinction in what you see, so the NODs use a green filter to help you distinguish shapes because green has the widest color range. It's not at all like you see in the movies or video games because those always have a ton of lighting so it makes the picture look great when you use them. But when you're walking under canopy the picture starts to get less clear, like a permanent version of when you can't get your eyes to focus because you're too tired.

Poor kids, it's hard enough to see at night under NODs, but with sleep deprivation starting to set in I can guarantee they'll start to see the green men before they even step off. God, I hope the stars shrine bright tonight.

Two hours into this search and things had quieted down. Once the General left everyone who didn't really do much winnow themselves away. The once crowded operations center now seemed almost hollow. It had been awhile since I had gotten up from my desk so I figured it was a good time for a smoke, besides, we don't get to bring our phones in there so I could use mindless doom scrolling to occupy my mind from the reality we were dealing with.

The cool autumn air was crisp and refreshing on my neck, perfect weather for a cigarette, less so for a manhunt. I lingered outside the building next to a few others had the same idea as myself and did my typical rhythm of bouncing around between apps. I answered some worried texts from my family, I let my spouse know that I would be home around breakfast, scrolled through Instagram for a bit before closing it, and then immediately reopening it. I was almost to the filter on my cigarette when I got Snapchat notification.

That's it! We hadn't sent out any of the Soldiers with our usual GPS equipment because they didn't really take any of our war fighting equipment for an aid mission, but I bet at least one of the missing Soldiers had their location turned on. Usually it's a big problem for units whenever we do our exercises because at least one or two rogue privates will forget they're broadcasting their location on Snapchat, but this time it might actually help them!

I quickly started to navigate the map to see if I could get close to their last known location. Lots of public stories in the area, I didn't know their usernames so I started to click through them.

A group of people walking through a church showing off all the damage from the flooding. A little boy that was very excited he had a helicopter in his front yard. Lots of slow pans of towns that look like they had been swallowed by the earth. A few non-profit groups opining to the Internet about all the good they're doing. Then I found them, or at least, the stories from one of the Soldiers, Private Cadena.

Private Cadena was clearly excited to be going out on his first real mission because the first few videos were of his company loading up in the Chinooks we sent them out in. There was a few of the obligatory aerial landscape shots from his helicopter vantage point. Then I got to the last few videos which looked more likely to be where they got lost.

It was mid-afternoon and I could see four of them trudging along the side of a ridge. It was clear why Cadena had even started recording this one.

""Wow, Sarge! Are those headstones? Why the fuck is there a graveyard all the way up here?""

His camera quickly panned over to 7 or 8 headstones all well worn by time, surnames etched into the center of the stone crosses were barely legible.

""I don't know, weirdo,"" a stern voice replied, ""don't you guys have graveyards in California?""

He turned around to face the rest of the group. Sergeant Childers, Specialist Waters, and Privates Green and Vandenburgh followed up the ridge in loose formation.

The deep, Alabama drawl of Private Green interrupted, ""Sarge, we got graveyards back home, but we do them normal. This here is weird.""

""Well I don't know, I'm not from here either. Just don't go messing with them, you need to show some respect for the dead. Besides, we're not here to sight see, we need to do this survey fast so that we can get back before dark.""

Cadena and a few of the others continue to poke around the gravestones hoping to find something interesting. Sergeant Childers crests the hill in the background and starts to set up her equipment.

""This one says they died in 1865, that was during the civil war,"" a voice off-camera mumbles. Cadena pans up to the thin form of Private Vanderburgh. ""You don't think...""

Green shoots the camera a look before the rest of the squad erupts into laughter before he's interrupted by a bloodchilling screech. From his camera audio it sounded like one of those elk calls that they make out west, but this is was more unnatural.

""Huh, what do you mean? Isn't that her?""

Cadena points his camera past where she had set up the surveying scope to a shadowy figure further up the ridgeline, before he ends the story abruptly.",1,1752547868.0,creepcast,0,1.0,False

Because it makes engagement easy. 

Say something triggering about either people and you have the world's #1 populated country and the world's #2 populated country engaging with your content.

I spent a long time in Mumbai. I spent a long time in Shanghai.

The average person on the streets in China could not care less Arunachal Pradesh just as the average person on the streets in Mumbai don't have any particularly strong views about Tibet.

Stereotypes fail the litmus test once they leave the internet rage-sphere. Indian guy going to China is not going to be eating unhealthy bbq street food at 2:00 AM in the morning from a food cart. They will be eating at one of thousands of vegetarian restaurants nearby buddhist temples. China man going to Mumbai is not going to be eating street food in slummed alleys. He will be going to restaurants in Mumbai malls.

It's all engagement bait. China man goes to Mumbai - does he have money? Okay, money good, welcome to India. Indian man goes to Shanghai - does he have money? Okay, money good. Welcome to China.

There's a big Tata office downtown on the east side of Shanghai next to a bunch of Chinese companies. Lunch time, the Indians and Chinese go out, they get coffee, they chat, they eat the same food... (well, okay, maybe not the same food). But you go to Tim Hortons and you see Indian guy and Chinese guy sitting next to each other - Chinese guy is not going ""AAH YOU SMELL"" and Indian guy is not making slitty eye gesture going ""Ching chong"". They're not idiots.

This isn't the 1970. 

You people are the critical thinking sub. THINK. CRITICALLY. Stop eating up youtube slop bait and get enraged on behalf of ... uh... 2.8 BILLION PEOPLE.

Hi all,

I‚Äôm 29 F, lives in Lhr (or at least recently trying to make peace with being here long-term), and honestly? I just want a genuine friend or two. Someone to rant with over coffee, maybe hit the gym together, decompress after a crap day without feeling like I‚Äôm being emotionally audited.

Making friends as an adult is weird. Everyone‚Äôs busy, guarded, or caught up in social dynamics that feel high-schoolish jealousy, weird competitiveness, subtle judgment, or transactional vibes. I‚Äôm not into that. I‚Äôm not perfect, but I try to be kind, supportive, and real. I‚Äôd love to meet someone who‚Äôs the same.

If you‚Äôre in Lahore, around my age, and feeling the same way drop a comment or DM. Let‚Äôs grab a coffee, or chat online first if that feels easier. Maybe friendship can still be simple and good.

1m06cgr,https://www.reddit.com/r/redditonwiki/comments/1m06cgr/compliments_chemistry_and_a_business_plan/,"Compliments, Chemistry‚Ä¶ and a Business Plan?","I‚Äôm a 35-year-old woman, and this is the story of how I unknowingly became a target at my local gym.

I go to the gym about four times a week. I keep to myself, get my workout in, and head out. I'm not really there to socialize. But one day, while zoning out between sets, I noticed a guy nearby staring at me. Our eyes met ‚Äî cue the classic polite smile-nod combo ‚Äî and that became our unspoken ritual every time we crossed paths. He was always there.

Weeks passed, and one day after using the massage chairs in the rest area, I let out a dramatic, blissed-out sigh. When I opened my eyes, there he was ‚Äî sitting next to me. I jumped a little, apologized for the noise, and he used that as his opportunity to strike up a conversation. ‚ÄúHow was your workout? Leaving already? Do you usually come at this time?‚Äù I gave short answers, caught off guard, and left quickly, embarrassed.

Then life got in the way and I didn‚Äôt go back to the gym for about two months. When I returned, I noticed something interesting: every time I‚Äôd head for the massage chairs at the end of my workout, he‚Äôd suddenly wrap up his workout too ‚Äî and end up right next to me. He always made conversation, asked personal questions, and seemed excited to learn more about me. When I told him I was Latina, he broke out in Spanish and started tossing in compliments. He casually asked if I had ‚Äúany dependents‚Äù ‚Äî a clumsy but obvious probe into my relationship and parental status.

Honestly? I was flattered. The attention felt good. He was charming and funny, and though I clocked that he was probably younger, I brushed it off. (I‚Äôm notoriously bad at guessing ages, and Asians always look young ‚Äî sigh.)

For weeks, it became a flirty cat-and-mouse game. He‚Äôd greet me loudly in Spanish, toss me a compliment across the room, wink. It was all playful, light, and public ‚Äî enough to draw the attention of people nearby. And yeah‚Ä¶ I started to play along. I laughed, I flirted back, I sought him out a little.

Then came yesterday.

I was walking on the treadmill when he hopped onto the one next to me. We talked for an hour. And that‚Äôs when something shifted. The conversation got deeper‚Ä¶ or so I thought. He started talking about astrology (which I love), guessed my sign (‚ÄúWhat are you, an Aquarius or something?‚Äù ‚Äî nailed it), mentioned music I liked, and knew my Chinese zodiac.

He complimented me nonstop. ‚ÄúYou always look so nice. Your nails are immaculate. I can tell you take care of yourself.‚Äù And yet‚Ä¶ every time I asked him something about his own life, he expertly dodged it. Evasive. Vague. Practiced.

Eventually, I got fed up. ‚ÄúI‚Äôm not continuing this conversation until you tell me how old you are and what you do for work.‚Äù

He smiled.

‚ÄúI‚Äôm 19,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúAnd I‚Äôm a sugar baby.‚Äù

I blinked. WHAT? (I could hear Sean yelling ILLEGAL from somewhere in my head)

He laughed and explained how it works ‚Äî that he has five sugar mamas who each give him a monthly allowance. He broke it all down like it was just another career path.

Still joking, still flirty.

He asked for my number so we could grab a coffee. I gave it ‚Äî mostly out of shock, and also because I didn‚Äôt want to cause a scene. I figured I‚Äôd text him later and shut it down gently.

But something didn‚Äôt sit right. I couldn‚Äôt shake the feeling that I‚Äôd been played. Especially being a 35 year old, chubby, average looking woman. So I opened up Tinder ‚Äî an app I rarely use ‚Äî and started scrolling through the profiles that had liked me over the past few months. And there it was.

A shirtless torso. Abs front and center. The profile said he was into short-term fun, spoke English, Tagalog, and Spanish, and that he was a Virgo. My gut said it was him. And then I remembered: my profile says I‚Äôm an Aquarius. It says my love language is giving/receiving compliments. It lists the music I love. It even says I‚Äôm into astrology.

Suddenly everything clicked.

This wasn‚Äôt a chance flirtation. This was a strategy. He had studied me. He used the gym as his hunting ground ‚Äî not to work out (come to think of it, I‚Äôve never actually seen him lift anything heavy), but to recruit. And I had been one of his targets.

He had been laying the groundwork for months. Complimenting me, making me feel seen, mirroring my interests. It wasn‚Äôt just attention ‚Äî it was manipulation designed to sell me on his services without ever naming the price.

I won‚Äôt lie. It stung.

Already feeling a little down about myself, the realization that I had been viewed as a potential client, not a person, felt like a punch to the gut. It made me question everything ‚Äî my desirability, my age, my worth.

But also? It was kind of hilarious.

So here‚Äôs what I plan to do.

Next time I see this baby-faced businessman, I‚Äôm going to return the energy ‚Äî loud and proud, just like he was when he complimented me in front of a crowd. I‚Äôll walk up and say:

‚ÄúHey big money! Doing business as usual? Closed any deals today? Or are you heading to the retirement home next? I still can‚Äôt believe you tried to add me to your portfolio!‚Äù

Will I actually do it? We‚Äôll see.

But one thing‚Äôs for sure ‚Äî I‚Äôm walking into that gym with my head held high. Not because of his attention, but because I saw through the illusion, laughed, and chose to walk away with my power (and dignity) intact.",1,1752547389.0,redditonwiki,1,1.0,False

1m06ast,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1m06ast,Two Bit Club,"
TL;DR: Not going back for a very long time.

‚ÄòTwo Bit Club‚Äô just opened on June 19th in the Hotel Richemont. They are a concept from The Indigo Road Group, so sister restaurant to Oak Steakhouse, O-Ku, Indaco and more. We had high expectation for this restaurant because we enjoy the others. The menu emphasizes Vietnamese cuisine ‚Äúusing ‚ÄúFrench techniques‚Äù. The restaurant itself is lively with its open kitchen right at the front and looks nicely decorated inside and out.

This is a long one so hold tight‚Ä¶

We made reservations as per usually for restaurants here in Charleston, and they have a ‚ÄòChef‚Äôs Counter‚Äô available, which we enjoy, so booked it. Reservation was for 7:30, arrived at 7:25, we were told ‚Äúit will be a minute because they were behind on the  7:15‚Äôs‚Äù, weird but whatever. So we wait in the front entrance area, watching 6 of the 10 chefs counter seats just sit there empty. We get seated at 7:40, our server doesn‚Äôt show up to greet us until 7:50 and at that time we order drinks and appetizers. We didn‚Äôt get our drinks until 8:17. At this point we knew we were in for a long night. The host/manager? came by and asked how things were and we told her we‚Äôd like to order dinner because we haven‚Äôt seen our server since ordering drinks and still haven‚Äôt even gotten appetizers. 8:22 got our first appetizer and then at 8:31 we got our second appetizer. It wasn‚Äôt until 9:20 that we got our first entree with a side dish. Then at 9:34 we finally got our second entree. We finally ended up leaving at 9:55. Two hours and thirty minutes doesn‚Äôt seem like that long of a time, reasonable for a 6-8 course meal but, for two courses, really?

The cocktails: drinks were tasty and unique, my wife got the sake martini and said I was delicious. I tried the Vietnamese coffee drink because it was unique, tasted great but came in a Collin‚Äôs glass had a whipped top and didn‚Äôt come with a straw, so was a little difficult to drink but tasted good just awkward.

The food: the appetizers were yellowtail crudo and mussels in a coconut broth. They were both Okay, nothing revolutionary. The biggest issue I had was with the baguette served with the mussels, it came as 2 pieces and one was burnt while the other was not toasted at all. The side of Brussels sprouts were dry, literally just fried Brussels sprouts with raw sesame seeds on top, I think they forgot the ‚Äúcarmelized fish sauce‚Äù. The entrees were duck ‚Äòleg‚Äô(because ‚Äúthat‚Äôs what was available‚Äù not the duck breast like the menu said), it was deep fried and them topped with a honey hoisin sauce, which took away all of the crisp of the skin but was otherwise an okay dish. The market fish, tile fish, was so over cooked it was sawdust, and was the most pitiful thing I‚Äôve ever seen it was probably only three ounces, I had one bite my wife had a bite and there was one bite left that we didn‚Äôt eat because it was so overcooked but at least the bok choy that came with it was okay. 

This is the condensed version; Take all of this as you see fit but we sat at the chefs counter, we have worked in restaurants, we saw everything being prepared literally right in front of us. We saw things sitting at the expo for way too long, one fish order I saw plated was literally three nuggets of fish, not even a whole piece. I could go on.

I hope for the employees sake that this is just because they are brand new and people are still learning? With so many other restaurants in town under the same group why not have people train at them maybe? And if they did, they do not have the operating procedures in order here yet. I believe one of the biggest issues is that they have way too small of a kitchen to push out food for ten counter seats, a bar, patio seating and possibly 15+ more inside tables. 

My last word will be that management did notice, took accountability of the problem and did comp our meal this night. I will say that, that acknowledgement did ease the sour taste in our mouth but by no means does it make us want to go back any time soon. If they stay open, we may go back in a year or so but only if we hear great things from people. ",3,1752547252.0,Charleston,2,1.0,False

Hey neighbors, I wanted to flag something that‚Äôs happening on Pico Blvd that‚Äôs raising serious concerns for a bunch of small, independent businesses, including mine.

The City of Santa Monica is planning to **move the westbound Big Blue Bus stop** from in front of UnUrban Coffee to a new location **right in front of Bay Shades, Interdental, and Good Body Pilates (my studio),** across from Trader Joe‚Äôs.

This decision was made without real outreach to affected businesses or the surrounding community. Here‚Äôs why a lot of us are worried:

* We‚Äôll lose essential **parking spaces** used daily by elderly, disabled, and pregnant clients.
* It will **block our storefronts**, reduce visibility, and hurt foot traffic, things small businesses rely on to survive.
* **Medical offices and retail** here depend on curbside pickup and clear access.
* We‚Äôre also concerned about **noise, loitering, and pollution** right outside our doors, it impacts the safety and comfort of staff and clients.
* There‚Äôs also the potential for a **drop in property values** with major transit infrastructure directly in front of retail entrances.

We‚Äôre not against pedestrian safety or public transit, far from it. We just want these projects to be done with real community input.

üì¢ If you're a Santa Monica resident, business owner, or client who cares about keeping our local spots alive and accessible, please consider supporting a petition asking the City to pause the relocation and collaborate with our community before making a final decision.

I‚Äôm a 30-year old office worker currently based in the west end of the city, but open to travelling anywhere on the subway line. As the title suggests, I‚Äôm someone who doesn‚Äôt say much and prefers staying indoors. Keeping that in mind, I‚Äôm recently looking to get out of my comfort zone and meet some cool people along the way.

Some interests of mine that might be relevant - I‚Äôm deeply spiritual and meditate regularly. Most of practice is grounded in the Tibetan Buddhist tradition but I‚Äôm fairly knowledgeable about other religious doctrines as well. I‚Äôm currently in the process of getting back into philosophy, specifically in the realms of metaphysics and epistemology. In short, I‚Äôm really interested in finding out why people hold the beliefs that they do. Other past-times include checking out new coffee/tea places and watching horror movies. Please let me know if any of the above resonates with you and we‚Äôll go from there.",4,1752546835.0,TorontoHangoutFriends,0,0.84,False

I would love to meet up with other seekers and discuss these topics in person. Particularly if you are a person who considers yourself to be a wanderer or potentially a wanderer. Could be one or a group of us.

Could just be a catch up for coffee or if there is a place people already meet, I would be keen to find out about it.

Feel free to DM me",8,1752546797.0,lawofone,1,1.0,False
