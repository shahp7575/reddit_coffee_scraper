1hrjjh9,https://www.reddit.com/r/Harrisburg/comments/1hrjjh9/looking_to_create_local_art_group/,Looking to create local art group!,"Howdy! I (25F) just moved up here from Kentucky and am looking for other people who would like to get together at a local coffee shop to paint/draw/craft and just vibe overall maybe once every week or two. I looked around on Facebook, Meetup etc and was suprised to not find anything like that so I figured I would just create my own! I mostly work from home so it's been hard finding social connections and I would love to invite anybody who is interested to join the Discord I just made so that we can start planning some coffee shop hangouts. I'll put the Discord link below, thanks y'all!

1hrjg50,https://www.reddit.com/r/mikesonofpeter/comments/1hrjg50/after_happily_ever_after_part_4/,After Happily Ever After Part 4,"Osvald and I stepped back onto the ship, the renegade nobleman taking the helm once more.  It was impossible to tell that he was the same man as the one in the cell who had completely given up on everything.  He was confident, driven, and sporting a wicked smile.

“Sorry it took so long,” Dan said.  “I didn’t know how long to wait and couldn’t figure out how to fly the ship at first.  Also, I fell asleep.”

“It’s fine,” said Osvald.  “Though admittedly you are cutting it close.”  Although it was early morning, the sky was dark—the eclipse had just begun.  

“Not much time,” I said.  “What’s the game plan now?”

“No time for anything elegant,” Osvald said.  “We do this the old-fashioned way—storm in and take Emma.  The guards will be aware of our escape but hopefully we can rush in and grab her before reinforcements can take us down.”

“Now that’s a pirate move!” Dan said.  

“I admit, it’s a bit more violent than I usually would prefer,” Osvald said.  “But I suppose one must sometimes do unsightly things in the name of love.”

“Yeah,” I said, smiling at Osvald’s words for reasons he wouldn’t understand.  “You gonna tell her the truth?” 

Osvald nodded.  “Indeed.  Whether she reciprocates or not, I know I will regret it if I don’t.  I’m through being a coward.  I’m going to do whatever it takes to save Emma—to save the woman I love!”

“Oh cool, he admitted it,” said Dan.  “Guess the night in prison was productive after all.”

Down below, the castle was active and on high alert.  Blowing up a prison usually made that happen, to be fair.  Osvald steered the ship to a building next to the castle, a large structure with a stained-glass roof.  The ship came to a stop right above the building.

“That’s our destination,” Osvald said.  “This is the cathedral.  Ardnoth will be performing the ritual here.  Once the eclipse reaches its zenith, Emma will be sacrificed.”

“How much time do we have?” I asked. 

“Not long.  The zenith will be in the next few minutes.  According to my research, this eclipse will last maybe ten minutes.  If we are unable to liberate Emma, then the least we can do is prevent the ritual from moving forward until the eclipse ends.  That will force Ardnoth to postpone his plans until the next one.”

I put a hand on Osvald’s shoulder.  “Are you willing to settle for that?”

Osvald let out a maniacal laugh.  “Please, Mike.  A villain like yours truly?  I don’t settle for anything other than perfect.”

“Good.  Best of luck to you.”  As I gave Osvald my best wishes, the skeleton pirates were grabbing weapons and rope, both of which were also handed to Osvald and I.  I looked at the items in my hand and then to Osvald.  “You’re making me come with you, aren’t you?”

“But of course,” Osvald said smugly.  “Like I said before, I need all the help I can get, especially now.  Besides, you defeated *me* in battle.  You can handle these pushover guards.”

“Yeah, Mike,” said Dan.  “Quit being a baby.”

“Easy for you to say!  Are you even coming with?”

Dan scoffed.  “’Course not!  Somebody’s gotta fly the ship!”

“Quite,” said Osvald.  He raised his sword into the air.  “Men, we’re off!  Let’s go save a princess!”  With that, Osvald and several of the undead pirates jumped off the side of the ship and down to the cathedral below.  

I looked down at the insane display of airborne piracy and realized they expected me to follow suit.  “Oh, *hell* no.  I am not—” I didn’t get to finish my thought as one of the skeletons shoved me off the side of the ship.  I managed to grab hold of my rope and hurtled towards the cathedral roof, screaming all way through.  Just before we crashed, Osvald whipped out his wand and fired a blast of pure force at the ceiling, shattering it.  We fell straight through the opening and landed inside the cathedral—gently and safely, inexplicably enough.

The cathedral was occupied by several robed figures and some guards.  The king was near an altar in the back along with a high priest looking type and Emma.  It seems not a single one of them was ready for Osvald and his group to just drop from the ceiling and they all just stood in shock for a moment.

I doubled checked my person to make sure I hadn’t died during the fall.  “How the hell did we survive that?”

“Enchanted rope,” Osvald said.  “Let’s us safely land no matter how high up we are.  What, did you really think a sky pirate wouldn’t take precautions against falling to his death?”  Osvald turned toward the king and pointed his wand at him with a dramatic flourish.  “We meet again, old man.”

The king was foaming at the mouth.  He moved to stand between us and Emma.  “It seems my mercy was misplaced,” he snarled.  “I won’t make that mistake again.  Guards, kill every last one of them!  Do not let them interrupt the ceremony!”

The guards rushed us but Osvald was undeterred.  “I don’t think so!”  He thrust his wand forward and fired another wave of force that sent the charging soldiers flying backwards.  The king went to make a move but Osvald trained his wand on him, forcing him to stand down.  Meanwhile, the skeletons kept the guards busy while I helped—and by helped, I mean wildly swinging my sword in the general direction of any bad guy who came remotely close to me.  Again, I never claimed to be a fighter.  

“You’ll pay for this, boy,” the king growled.

“Silence,” Osvald calmly commanded.  “I’m not here to talk to you.”  He turned his attention towards Emma.

“What are you doing here, Osvald?” the princess asked.  “Please, just leave us alone!  I don’t want to hear your lies anymore!”

“Then listen to my truth!” cried Osvald.  His voice was shaky and panicked.  He stood there silently, avoiding looking Emma in the eye.  I thought he might back down again but he found his resolve and faced Emma directly.  “When my parents died, the world resented me, it rejected me.  I told myself that I didn’t need anyone else.  That I could succeed on my own.”  Osvald laughed bitterly.  “What a pathetic lie that was!  I just didn't want to face the truth—that I was lonely.  That no one wanted me.  I thought my solitude was my strength but in truth it was my weakness.  Al I ever wanted was to reach out to someone, anyone, and for them to take my hand.”  Osvald’s knees had been shaking since he started talking but at that moment, the shakes vanished, the quiver in his voice faded.  “And then I gave you that handkerchief.  I reached out.  You accepted.  And then everything changed.  I told you villains don’t love, Emma.  And that too was a lie.”

Emma covered her mouth with her hands.  “Then, do you mean…?”

“Yes,” Osvald said softly.  “Emma, I…” Osvald took a big breath and spoke confidently.  “I’m in love with you!  I want to be with you!  I want to save you!  Please, believe me, your father lies to you!  About your siblings, about the war, the curse!  He does not care about you.  But I do!”

“Osvald…” Emma whispered with tears in her eyes.

The king just barked out a mocking laugh.  “Pathetic!  Do you really think this makes up for your crimes?  Need I remind you that you have kidnapped her time and time again!  Emmalinde will never love you!  Not after all that you’ve done!”

“I don’t care about that!” said Osvald.  “Even if she never loves me, even if she hates me, I will do everything for her!  All I have to my name is my ship but I will give Emma everything her heart desires.  A lovely mansion, beautiful clothes, delicious food, anything she wants!  I’ll make sure she lives like a queen!   And I…” Osvald grew quiet again.  “I'll be whatever she wants.  I'll be her king, her servant, even her jester.  Just as long as I can give her the life she deserves.  But right now…” Determination filled Osvald’s eyes as he flourished his sword in the other hand and pointed it at the king.  “I think I'll be her knight.” 

Emma’s eyes were full of stars and her cheeks were crimson.  Osvald’s confession had let her speechless.  Her father, on the other hand, had plenty to say.  “You speak of Emmalinde as if you truly know her but the only time you have spent with her are moments stolen from those more deserving.  I am her father!  I raised her, fed her, clothed her, taught her everything she knows!  I have been there for every milestone, every important moment from infancy to adulthood!  You can’t hope to match that!”

“I don’t care about any of that!” Osvald replied.

The king shook his head.  “That is because you are ignorant.”

Osvald was quiet at this.  But eventually he responded.  “…then tell me this—what is Emma’s favorite flower?”

Ardnoth doubled back.  “What?”

“If you know her so well then you should know what her favorite kind of flower is.”

Ardnoth sighed.  “This is ridiculous.  I think I’ve entertained you long enou—” A burst of pure magical force soared through the air straight to Ardnoth’s chest.  A circle of glowing green runes appeared between the king and the attack and the magical volley slammed into the circle.  The force of the impact knocked the king back a step but otherwise he was totally fine.  Ardnoth flashed another smug grin as he reached under his shirt to pull out a medallion glowing the same green color as the runes.

“White.  Lilies,” said Osvald.  “Her favorite flowers are white lilies.  A field of them look like a starry sky.”

“Nice try, hedge mage,” said the king.  “But I’m prepared for your tricks.”

Emma gasped.  “Father, what is that?  Is that magic?!?”

“Only a precaution, my dear,” said Ardnoth.  “A charm to defend against the occult.  I detest using magic like so but it is a last resort.”

I clumsily battered back a guard’s spear with my sword and shouted back “Feels like you have a lot of last resort magic, huh?!?”

The king ignored me, his sights set on Osvald.  “Your magic is strong, but this charm absorbs any and all spells cast at me.  It is hopeless to—” Osvald refused to let the king finish, firing another spell at him.  The amulet once again blocked the attack but it still staggered Ardnoth backwards.  

Osvald refused to give the king a moment to breath.  He hammered Ardnoth with spell after spell, stepping closer and closer to his target with each wave of the wand.  The attacks weren’t damaging him but they did keep the king stunned in place.  Osvald continued speaking, each statement punctuated with another blast from his wand.  “Her favorite animal is the songbird because of the beautiful music they make.  She loves to watch the sun rise and set, to see how the color of the sky changes.”  Osvald blasted the king over and over, the crystal at the end of his wand glowing more and more violently.  “She loves to dance when she thinks no one is looking but I manage to sneak a peek all the time and even when she notices me, she still dances!  She’s read *The Flameheart Knight and the Frozen Maiden* so much she can recite it word for word!  One day she wishes to write a fairy tale of her own!”

The last spell from Osvald’s wand was apparently the straw that broke the camel’s back.  The wand exploded in his hands and Osvald yelled out in pain.  Emma reached out and cried “Osvald!”  The light of the explosion dissipated and Osvald stood there holding the stump of his wand with a bloody hand.  The broken wand fell to the floor and Osvald attempted and failed to move his injured arm.  He dropped the sword in his uninjured hand and shakily reached into his coat to pull out a new wand tipped with a sparkling blue crystal.  “And she loves to sing.  She hums these cute little songs she makes up and sings them to herself, not caring who could hear her.  He voice is beautiful.” 

With the onslaught paused, Ardnoth rushed Osvald with a roar but the pirate noble flicked his wrist and launched a bolt of lightning at the king.  The runes once again blocked the magic but the momentum caused Ardnoth to fall backwards.  Osvald continued his unrelenting attack as the king struggled to stand back up.  “But you would take that from her.  You would take *everything* from her!”  Osvald waved his wand, storing up a massive amount of electricity.  “BUT I WON’T LET YOU TAKE *HER*!”  He fired a humongous bolt of lightning at the king.  “SO LET EMMA GO!”

Right before the bolt made contact, Ardnoth screamed and held out a hand.  The lightning crashed into his open hand and he struggled to hold the spell back.  The king spoke some eldritch words in an ancient tongue and rose a foot in the air.  The lightning in his hand swirled around his body and shifted from blue-white to a blood red.  With another incantation, Ardnoth fired the lightning back at Osvald, sending him flying backwards to the ground.  Osvald laid still, breathing ragged and eyes closed.

“Osvald!” cried Emma.

“No!” I screamed out.  I looked around and saw the skeletons were losing ground to the castle guards.  In an instant, the battle had shifted against us.

The king floated gently to the ground as the magic around him faded.  His own breathing was heavy but none of Osvald’s spells had injured him.  “A fine attempt,” he said.  “But pointless.”

“Father,” said Emma.  “What—what *was* that?  How did you do that?”

“Another trick I picked up,” he said proudly.  “A way to redirect spells thrown at me back at the caster.  Our little count here was hoist by his own petard.”

Ema gasped in horror.  “But…but you used magic!  You told me that magic was vile, used by monsters and those willing to blacken their souls!”

Ardnoth chuckled.  “Ah my dear, you are still young.  One day you will understand.  But for now, we must hurry.  We need to complete the ceremony soon.  Don’t you wish to end the curse?”

“I…” Emma looked down at Osvald who was beginning to stir.  He opened his eyes and stared into Emma’s tear-filled ones.  They held each other’s gaze as Osvald futilely attempted to reach a hand out to her.  After a moment, his arm dropped to the ground, his head soon following.  Emma turned back towards her father, shoulders square and the tears in her eyes replaced with fire.  “No.”

“What?” said Ardnoth.

“I refuse to complete this ceremony.  Not until I have spoken with my siblings.”

Ardnoth’s eyes grew wide.  “Your…your siblings?”

“Yes,” said Emma with a nod.  “You told me that not all of them had been taken by the curse.  Many of them had been married off to other nobles.  I wish to ask them about this ritual.  Surely, they have heard of it, yes?”

The king nervously chuckled.  “E-Emmalinde, dear.  This ritual was just discovered recently!  None of them would have heard of it before!”

“Then I would like to inform them that we have found a way to free them of our shared curse.”

The king looked up at the sky.  I followed his gaze.  I averted my eyes from the eclipse (I wasn’t trying to go blind from this quest) but I could tell the darkness was fading.  The eclipse was nearing its end—and Ardnoth’s time limit was almost up.

“There’s no time!” shouted Ardnoth.  The fear was obvious in his voice.  “The ritual must be completed during the eclipse!  If we do not perform it now then we will lose our chance!”

“That’s fine,” said the princess, undeterred.  “There will be another eclipse next year.  We can perform the ritual then.”

The king reeled back in surprise.  “How can you be certain?!?”

Emma gave a soft smile.  “The royal library contains many books that predict celestial phenomena, from passing comets to eclipses.  I have had much time to read all about them.”  Emma squinted at her father.  “After all, I have spent *many* years trapped inside my room.”

“I-I see,” said the king.  “W-well, we cannot guarantee that the curse won’t take you by then!”

Emma shrugged.  “My elder siblings seem to be doing well.  I feel like we can take the risk.”

Ardnoth grit his teeth.  “Have you let that pirate’s words poison your mind?  I am your father!  Are you saying you don’t believe me?  That I am a liar?  Well?”

“I—” Emma averted her eyes and became silent.

Ardnoth sighed in frustration.  “Emmalinde, my dear, I promise that I will answer all your questions.  But for now, let us hurry and complete the ritual.”

Emma stared down at the floor.  The girl had spent her entire life controlled by her father and I guess a minute of bravery wasn’t quite enough to undo her programming.  “…I understand.”

“Good.  Now, let’s—”

“One last question,” Emma interrupted.

Ardnoth groaned.  “What is it now?!?”

Emma looked up and locked eyes with her father.  “What is the name of our enemy?”

The king blinked.  “The…enemy?”

“Yes,” she said with zero emotion.  “The enemy nation we have been warring with for all this time.  The one’s who cursed our family.  You’ve spoken about them but you have never told me their name.  I wish to know the names of those who have cursed me.”

“A-ah, yes!  Of-of course!  Surely, I had mentioned it already, yes?  You must have forgotten.”

“I did not forget,” she said coldly.  “What is their name?”

The king gulped.  There was a bead of sweat on his brow.  “It…it is…” A flash of inspiration struck Ardnoth’s face.  “Idrilis!  Yes, that was it!  In the excitement and chaos of the attack it slipped my mind until now!  I apologize, princess.  Now, are we ready to begin the ceremony?”

Emma just stared at her father unmoving.  “…the Flameheart Knight.”

“What?”

“Idrilis.  That is the name of the kingdom in *The Flameheart Knight and the Frozen Maiden*.  It is my favorite story.  Osvald just mentioned it.  That is probably why you chose that name just now.”

Ardnoth’s face grew pale.  “Now, Emmalinde, dear—”

Emma just got in the king’s face.  “They’re right, aren’t they?  Osvald and Mike.  You’re lying to me.  About everything.  Aren’t you?”

Ardnoth stammered, trying to come up with another lie to cover for him but nothing came to mind.  After a few moments of panic, his face suddenly became cold and hard.  “I am done being nice today.”  He forcefully grabbed Emma’s arm.  “We are going to complete the ritual.  *Now*.”

Emma struggled to break free from the king’s grasp but failed.  “No, let me go!” she cried as her father began to drag her to the altar.  “Someone, please, help!”

“Shit!” I said.  “Hold on, I’m—” I didn’t get to finish my thought as a blur of movement rushed towards Ardnoth.  The king had time to turn around just in time for a furious Osvald to stab him in the chest with his sword.  The king cried out in pain, spitting blood from his mouth.  He let go of Emma, who backed away and screamed.

“Interesting,” said Osvald through clenched teeth.  “That bauble of yours protects you from magic.  But it seems my sword works just fine!” 

Ardnoth choked out “You vile little—” before Osvald thrust his sword further into the king’s chest and through his back.  He let go of the sword and the king stumbled backwards.  He fell to the ground and stopped moving.

Osvald glared at the king’s body.  “For my mother and father, you *bastard*.”

Emma cried out and rushed into Osvald’s arms—well, arm, seeing as his injured one still wasn’t moving much.  The princess sobbed into the count’s chest, averting her eyes from her father’s body.  Through sobs she asked “Is he…”

“I’m sorry,” Osvald said.  He turned to me and said “We need to go.  Hurry, before—” A pained groan interrupted him.  The three of us looked in horror as King Ardnoth slowly stood back on his feet.  He grabbed the sword in his chest and pulled it out, the wound in his chest immediately sealing.  

“Apologies, Count Rosenveld,” the king said with a wry smile.  “But you’ll have to try harder than that if you want to kill *me*.”  Osvald went to make a move but the king was quicker, casually swinging Osvald’s blade and slicing the count’s chest.  Osvald fell to the ground in pain as the king dropped the sword, grabbed Osvald by the neck, and lifted him into the air.  Osvald struggled to breath and with only one arm to work with, he couldn’t fight out of Ardnoth’s grasp.  

“Father!” Emma cried out.  “Please stop this at—” The king casually backhanded her with his other hand, knocking her to the ground.  Osvald’s furiously clawed at his attacker’s arm but the king did not react.

“No!” yelled King Ardnoth.  “I have been merciful but you shall make no more orders.  I am King Ardnoth Brenione, the ruler of the greatest kingdom in all the realm!  All that I see I conquer, all that I desire I take!  And I will crush anyone who stands in the way of what I want!  Whether it be my daughter—” He tightened his grip on Osvald’s throat.  “—or a treasonous pirate.”

“No!” cried Emma.  “Stop!  Don’t hurt him!”  She grabbed her father and tried to pull him away from Osvald but it was pointless.  The king just laughed, bringing Osvald closer to his face. 

“What’s the matter, count?” Ardnoth mockingly asked.  “You had plenty to say moments ago?  Are you tongue tied?  Can’t *choke* out another speech?  Hm?”  He laughed in Osvald’s face—blissfully unaware that Osvald had seized his amulet.  He ripped it from the king’s neck and hurled it to the other side of the room.  “NO!” the king yelled out.  He dropped Osvald and dashed towards his amulet.  Osvald hit the ground and locked eyes with me before looking to the floor—towards his wand at my feet.  I grabbed the wand and tossed it to Osvald.  He snatched it out of the air and pointed the violently sparking tip at Ardnoth.  The king turned back to Osvald just as a massive lightning bolt fired into his now-unprotected chest.  With a painful cry, Ardnoth was sent sailing through the air, slamming into the wall, and collapsing in a heap.

I rushed to Osvald’s side and Emma and I helped him to his feet.  “Excellent throw,” he said, panting heavily. 

Emma removed her hand from Osvald’s chest and saw it was stained crimson.  “You’re hurt!” she said.

“It is not a serious wound,” he replied.  “But I will need medical attention.  Hurry, we need to go.”  As he said that, the doors of the cathedral blew open as more guards rushed inside.  They charged towards us but they were blown into the air by a magical explosion—Osvald’s ship had fired on them.  I looked up to see Dan leaning over the railing of the ship.

“Hey!” he yelled.  “I figured out how to fire the cannons!  That was fucking *awesome*!”

“Nice one, Dan!” I called out.  I asked Osvald “How are we getting out of here?”

“The ropes,” he said.  “Tug one twice and it will pull you up.  Just be sure to hold on tight.”  He went to grab a rope but stumbled.

“I’ve got you,” Emma said.  She put his arm around her shoulders and they both tugged on a rope.  The skeleton crew members grabbed their own ropes and I did the same.  The ropes returned to the ship and pulled us with them.  In about ten seconds, all of us were back on the deck of the ship.  

“Get us moving!” I yelled to Dan.

“Aye aye!” he said.  He turned the wheel and the ship began flying away from the castle and towards the horizon.  

One of the skeletons relieved Dan of steering the ship while a few more began to tend to their captain’s wounds.  Osvald winced as they dressed his wounds but otherwise, he seemed no worse for wear for somebody who got his hand blown up and struck by lightning.  I leaned on the railing of the ship and let out a big sigh.  “Finally,” I said.  “It’s over.  Thank God.”  Right as I said that, I heard several high-pitched screeching noises.  They were far away but getting louder—and closer.  “Fuck,” I mumbled as I turned to see a hoard of stone gargoyles chasing after us.  On the back of one of them was King Ardnoth himself.  His skin was gaunt and skeletal, his eyes dark and sunken in.  He looked like one of Osvald’s skeletal pirates and he had an insane grin on his face.

“You will not escape me!” he shouted.  “Ur’galon’s debt shall be paid!  I will have what was promised to me!”

The other joined me at the railing, watching the gargoyles gain on us.  “What are those?” asked Emma in horror.

Osvald grunted.  “It seems King Ardnoth has given the castle statuary sentience.  More dark magic from that foul demon lord.”

“This is really ruining the *Gargoyles* cartoon for me,” Dan said.

“He just does not know when to give up, does he?” I asked.

“Then we will teach him,” said Osvald.  He faced the crew.  “Full speed ahead!  Ready the cannons!  Open fire!  Do not let them board!”  The crew got to work as the ship made evasive maneuvers to outpace the king and get the cannons in position to fire.  Osvald took out several more wands from his coat and handed them to everyone.  “Do you know how to use one of these?” he asked me.

“I don’t know,” I said.  “I’ve never really—” I flicked my wrist and a crackling bolt of crimson energy launched out of the tip and straight at one of the gargoyles, shattering it into a thousand pieces.  I admired my handiwork for a moment and said “Yeah, I think I’ve got it.”

Emma stared at the wand in her hand with utter revulsion, shoving it back at Osvald.  “I can’t use this, it’s magic!”

Osvald gave her an understanding look and said “I understand your reservations but if those things board the ship, you will die!”  Osvald gently grabbed her hand.  “Please, princess.”  Emma hesitated for a moment before accepting the wand.

The four of us got to work blasting the gargoyles.  Our aim wasn’t the greatest—Dan and I didn’t really have much experience using wands and Emma had even less.  Osvald was still recuperating from his injuries and using his off hand to fire.  It was a miracle he was even standing, let alone still fighting.  Despite the handicap, the sheer amount of targets meant we pretty much managed to land most of our shots.  Osvald tried to shoot the king out of the sky but he was in the middle of the pack so he had plenty of cover.  Cannon fire shredded through the gargoyles but it was hard to get a good shot on them with cannons while also running away from them.  Our combined efforts were keeping them back but the stonework army was getting closer and closer.

One gargoyle managed to slip by and land on the deck, knocking us back with the beat of its stone wings.  It went to strike at Osvald but Emma blasted it to smithereens with her wand.  She was covered in dust and panting in fear but there was a glimmer of pride in her eyes.

“Nice one!” I said as we returned to blasting our pursuers.  We were slowly whittling them down but there were just too many of them.  The gargoyles would be on us in seconds and Emma would be within their grasp.

“It’s not looking good!” Dan cried.

“Just hold on!” shouted Osvald.  “We just need to hold on and—” He was interrupted by a screech of something much bigger than the gargoyles.  A massive black shape shot past the ship and towards the gargoyles, shattering a dozen of them and sending others crashing to the ground.  The creature unfurled its wings and let out a challenging roar as the gigantic vulture that Dan and I had allied with at the start of this adventure came to the rescue.

“Vulture friend!” said Dan.  “You’re back!  Kick their asses!”  The vulture let out a cry that was probably an affirmative one as it got to work thinning out the herd.  The vulture was a whirlwind of beak, talons, and wings, diving in and out of the mass of stone monsters.  In seconds, the army had thinned to about a dozen or so that the four of us on deck had a much easier time of handling.  

Ardnoth screamed in frustration.  His gargoyle mount slipped past the vulture and charged straight at us.  The vulture turned to pursue it and managed to chomp the gargoyle mount in half.  Ardnoth leapt off the gargoyle and slammed into the railing of the ship.  He pulled himself over the railing and began trying to climb aboard. 

Osvald raised his wand at the king.  “I won’t let you—aargh!” Another gargoyle had slipped past the vulture and tackled Osvald.  Two more followed shortly, gunning for Dan and I.  The three of us were forced to deal with our attackers—leaving Emma alone to face her father.

“Emmalinde,” the king said.  “Please, come with me.  Don’t let them deceive you!  I’m your father, I love you!  Everything I’ve ever done has been to keep you safe!”

I whiffed a shot at my gargoyle.  “He’s lying!” I landed the second shot and clipped its wing causing it to slam down on the deck.  The skeletons all jumped on it to finish it off for me.  I tired to rush to Emma’s side but Dan’s gargoyle had knocked him back into me, sending us both tumbling onto the deck of the ship.

The king continued his spiel.  “I know this is all so confusing to you but I promise I will explain everything to you!  Just pull me up!  Quickly, I’m starting to slip!”

Emma froze.  Her resolve wavered at her father’s pleas.  She made a move to reach towards the king then suddenly stopped.  “What is my favorite flower?” she asked.

“What?” asked Ardnoth.  “I’m holding on for dear life and you’re asking me about *flowers*?!?”

“If you truly love me, you would know.  Osvald just said the answer a few minutes ago.  What is my favorite flower?”

The king panicked as he tried to recall the answer.  “Um, yes, I know this, it’s, um…yes, that’s it!  It was tulips!  Your favorite flowers are tulips!”

Emma just closed her eyes and sighed.  “I truly wished you had answered correctly.”  She raised her wand at the king and the tip began to glow.  “Goodbye, father.”  A scarlet blast domed the king in the forehead and sent him tumbling into the sky.  He screamed as he plummeted until his voice was too distant to hear.  The gargoyles that had boarded the ship quickly flew off to try and save their master while the remaining stragglers were either shot down by Osvald or destroyed by the vulture.  Soon, our pursuers were gone and the ship made a speedy getaway from the castle, finally giving us a moment to breathe.  

Emma fell to her knees are started crying.  I awkwardly put a hand on her shoulder to try and comfort her.  

“You were right, Mike,” Emma said as her tears stopped.  “Everything my father said was a lie.  You were only trying to help.  I’m sorry.”

“Don’t be,” I said.  “I get why you didn’t believe us.  I didn’t believe it at first either.  Plus, I didn’t exactly do myself any favors by leading you on like I did.  Sorry about that.”

Emma wiped her tears on her sleeve.  “All is forgiven,” Emma said.  She was quiet for a moment.  “I wanted to believe it was all still a lie.  But my father—my father is…” She began to cry again.  “My father is a monster!”  She buried her head in my chest and I just sat there and let her cry it out.  After a few minutes, she composed herself and dried her eyes with her handkerchief.  She stopped midway and just stared at the handkerchief before turning her attention towards Osvald.  The skeletons had finished dressing Osvald’s wounds and he was standing upright, albeit a little wobbly.  Emma stood up and the two gazed into each other’s eyes.

“Are you alright?” Osvald asked.

“You are the one who was injured,” she replied.  “I should be the one asking that question.”

Osvald tried to look tough and shake it off.  “Such is the life of piracy.  You get used to this sort of thing.”  The count averted his eyes from Emma and softly said “I’m glad you’re safe, princess.”

Emma walked over to the railing of the ship and looked down.  With her back to us, she asked “My father, do you think he…”

Dan, Osvald, and I looked at each other for a second.  “Survived?” Osvald asked.  “Yes, I believe he did.  His pact with the demon lord makes any conventional method of killing him impossible.  We stopped the ritual that would extend this pact but I do not believe he will immediately die from it.  I feel certain that his time is running out, however.”

“I see...,” said Emma.  She was silent for a moment.  “I suppose this makes me a fugitive of Brenione like yourself then.”

Osvald looked down sheepishly.  “Yes.  As long as your father still lives, he will not rest until he has you in his clutches again.  You won’t be able to return home.  I am sorry.”

“…then I suppose this means I am your prisoner once more?”

Osvald jerked back in shock.  “What?!?  No!  Princess, I—” He stopped as Emma giggled and turned around to show she was smiling softly.

“Oh, to be your captive once again,” Emma said teasingly.  She put her hand to her forehead in a dramatic gesture and walked over to Osvald.  “Kidnapped by the dashing yet nefarious Count Osvald von Rosenveld.  Does your wickedness know no bounds?”

“Princess, what are you talking—” Osvald finally seemed to understand what Emma was doing and he just laughed to himself.  He brushed the hair out of his face and put on his most wicked grin.  “’Tis only fitting for a scion of evil like myself.”

Dan leaned over to me and whispered.  “The hell?  Are they—are they *roleplaying*?”  I simply shrugged silently while Emma and Osvald continued their scene.

“Then I shall be trapped here?” Emma asked.  “On this heinous vessel of yours?”

“Indeed,” replied Osvald.  “I am merciful, however.  I shall give you free reign of my aircraft.  Explore to your heart’s content.”

“Oh?” she said with a raised eyebrow.  “Confidant I won’t try to escape?”

“Confidant you won’t be able to,” he replied.  “After all, we both remember what happened last time.”

 “It wasn’t that bad!”

“That bad?  If I hadn’t come along and saved you, you would have been eaten by a carnivorous bramblehide!”

Emma laughed.  “I suppose you’re right.”  She put her hands to Osvald’s chest.  The count stopped breathing the moment her hands touched him.  “It seems you’ve always been saving me, haven’t you?”

“Ha!  D—don’t go around saying things like that!  People might start to think I’m not the villain I say I am!”

“Of course.  Apologies.”  Emma gazed into Osvald’s eyes, her face a bit more serious now.  “My father will not stop util he has rescued me from your clutches.  You will have to never let me out of your sight, to keep me at your side at all times.”  She stroked the side of his face.  “Do you think you can do that?”

Osvald’s villainous façade cracked at her touch.  “I…” He regained his composure and wrapped a shaky hand around her waist.  “Yes.  I promise you, as long as I draw breath, I will never let you leave my side.”

“I see,” whispered Emma.  Her eyes were half-closed and her lips were slightly parted.  The two were inches apart from one another.  “I suppose…such a fate would not be too terrible after all…” The two closed the distance and kissed each other passionately.  The skeletal crew started applauding and Dan and I joined in.  The two broke the kiss, faces red and laughing with embarrassment, and gazed into each other’s eyes.

“I love you, Emma,” said Osvald. 

“And I love you, Osvald,” said Emma.  The two kissed again and held each other in a tight embrace.

Dan and I just enjoyed the heartwarming moment before he asked “So, is this relationship okay?”

“What do you mean?” I asked.

“Like, is this a kind of Stockholm syndrome kind of thing?”

“Oh,” I said, having never really thought about it that way.  “Um…no,” I said not so confidently.  I followed it with a much more confidant “No, I think it’s fine.  Yeah!  They, like, definitely were in love with each other before the whole kidnapping thing.”

“Yeah!” Dan said.  “Plus, he was saving her the whole time!”

“Yes!” I said.  “Exactly.”  As Dan and I cleared our doubts, the morning sky shone once more as the eclipse ended and the happy couple sailed into the horizon towards a brand-new life of freedom and love.

***

Osvald dropped Dan and I home not long after we escaped from the king and promised us that he would stay in touch.  A few weeks later, he kept that promise by calling us via a magic crystal ball.  I had been gifted one on one of my many adventures years ago and had pretty much forgotten about it until now.  I sat down on the couch and placed the crystal ball on the coffee table.  The crystal ball showed Osvald and Emma in the cabin of the ship, still holding on to one another.

“So, things have been going good then?” I asked.

“Yes,” said Emma.  “Relatively, anyways.  Father survived the fall, as expected.  He’s branded me a traitor to the crown and put out a bounty on me.  But I’ve heard rumor that many Bren’s are divided on this.  It seems I was beloved by the people of Brenione and now they are beginning to question my father.”

“That’s great!” I said.

“Indeed,” said Osvald.  “In fact, Emma and I have discussed trying to rally the people to our side.  No one believed me due to my reputation as a scion of evil but with Emma by my side I think we can get them to see the truth.”

“Wonderful,” I said.  “And I take it your dad is still trying to capture you for the demon pact?”

“Yes,” Emma said.  “But I do not believe we will need to worry about that.”

“Really?  Why?”

The couple averted their gaze from mine and both their faces turned red.  “W-well,” Osvald stammered.  “You see, a few days ago I discovered that, um, one of the stipulations for being sacrificed was that the child still be…well, a, um, ‘maiden.’  And, well, by that point Emma and I had already—uh, that is to say, we’ve—”

I held up a hand to them.  “It’s fine, I think I figured it out.  Well, anyways, congrats on everything, Emma.  Er, I guess I should call you Emmalinde?  Since you said Emma is reserved for the man you love?”

Emma shook her head.  “No, Emma is fine.  For years, I associated the name Emma with a villain.  But now—” She looked down at the floor sadly.  “Emmalinde is the name I associate with unpleasant memories.”  She smiled and gazed lovingly into Osvald’s eyes.  “I am no longer Princess Emmalinde Brenione.  I am simply just Emma.  And I would have it no other way.”

I smiled.  “Well, in that case, I hope the rebellion is a success, Emma.”

“As do I.”  Emma smiled at me.  “All my life, I thought the world was as simple as the stories I read.  But now I see just how wrong I was.  I wish to make my kingdom a better place.  I wish to give Brenione their happily ever after.  I know it won’t be easy.  And what comes after will be hard.  But I believe it can be done.  And once it is—” She gazed at Osvald.  “I can finally see what comes after happily ever after.”  Osvald squeezed her hand and kissed her tenderly.

“Good,” I said.  “Well, I’ll let you go.  Be safe out there.”  We said our goodbyes and I hung up.  I leaned back in my chair and exhaled.  “Glad that those kids got together.  Good for them.”

Dan came out of his room.  “Speaking of love lives, I just got off the phone with Liz and explained to her that the whole ‘princess fiancée’ was just a big misunderstanding.  So, it looks like you still have a shot with her, lady-killer.”

“Seriously?” I asked.  “How’d you swing that?”

Dan just shrugged.  “What can I say?  I have a gift.”

“Well, thanks.  Glad that’s resolved.”

“Well, I’m just glad we don’t have a princess living in our apartment anymore.”

“Heh, true.”  As I enjoyed this adventure finally being over, there was a knock on the door.  I got up to answer it and saw my brother-in-law, Prince Percival.

“Percy?” I said.  “What are you doing here?”

“Ah, Mike, perfect,” he said.  Percy had a suitcase with him and looked a bit sheepish.  “Well, your sister and I had a little fight and I need somewhere to stay for a bit.  Do you have a room I could use?”

I stood in the doorway in silence.  I looked back at Dan, who simply put a finger to his nose and said “Not it.”",1,1735785212.0,mikesonofpeter,0,1.0,False

Have a Saeco Xelsis for a while now. Do not use it much since not an avid coffee drinker, but recently had an issue started with it. When selecting any type of coffe, but lets say espresso lungo (today), I selected a double shot (x2) and literally NOTHING was dispensed. It all went into the tray instead of out the spout and into the cup. I descaled it, cleaned the brew group, followed everything to a T but then tried to do the espresso lungo (x2) again, and same exact situation... Grinds the coffee, runs theough dispensing it... Into the tray, then completes. Then i tried another selection from the screen, americano, and same aituation, though towards the end i did get a tiny little bit that made its way into the cup. Ao i went back to the espresso lungo and again, same thing... 

Any ideas what could be causing any and all water to go to the tray instead of out the spout as it should. 

Please help. This dang machine has been a problem since day one but love how it looks but should definitly work better than it does for a $1500 price tag.

He let me plan our wedding until the day we broke up. I am still heartbroken.,"My (F33) ex-fiancé (M29) broke off our relationship in July. He let me plan our wedding until the day we broke up. I am still heartbroken.
 


Back story - my ex fiancé was friends with my brother for 11 years, since he (ex) was 18 and friends with sister in law (my brothers wife) for 7 years give or take. They were in a band together and spent a lot of time together as a band and with their group of friends 

Ex and I started dating March 2022 and I moved in with him about a year later, he proposed December 2023. He was my best friend and I trusted him more than any person in my life. It just seemed so natural and comforting. I know we were in love and he cared about me a lot. We never fought or raised our voices at each other…

We got in an argument on the way home from our Fourth of July trip, which took up pretty much the whole day because we stopped to look at 2 wedding venues on the way home. That night when we got home we had an argument, he went for a walk and when he came back I told him I’m here to talk when he’s ready, and laid in bed. He didnt talk to me and I woke up crying at 5 am.. he asked if I wanted to talk or be comforted and I said I wanted to talk. I asked him if he thought we got engaged too soon and he said yes, then I asked him how we can move forward and work on things and he said “I don’t think we can” and that was that. He was extremely adamant about not making it work and going our separate ways. I tried and tried to get him to change his mind but he was sure about not wanting to be with me. Mind you, we talked the whole weekend with his parents about the wedding plans, looked at venues on the way home and even discussed our bridal party the weekend before at a coffee shop we used to go to saying we wanted to bring our wedding party there to tell them.  We also took engagement pictures 3 weeks before breaking up.. i had NO idea that he was feeling this way. He later (after breaking up) expressed that he felt like he couldn’t come to me about issues because I can be “defensive” and he didn’t feel I was a “safe space for him” I never knew he felt like that. He brought up other things like I was on my phone too much (I was planning our wedding) and our sex life wasn’t as much as he wanted, he said we were incompatible and wanted a relationship like his brother & sister in law (I still don’t know what he meant by that) because in my eyes we were best friends. He also said we didn’t communicate well.. We were so happy and (I thought) respectful of each other but he basically blamed me for everything.. I really just had no idea he felt this  way, he said he had built up resentment and regret because of all of it. 

My brother and sister in law don’t speak to him anymore and he doesn’t hang out with their friend group and band mates anymore either. They all lost so much respect for him and he essentially isolated himself away from his friends too. These are friends we would see frequently and some friends he knew since high school. 

Come to find out about 4 months after we broke up, he started dating his coworker. I had a suspicion of this coworker (F25) even though I trust my ex at the time. He actually introduced me to her and she has come to his band’s shows twice throughout the year. He also spent work trips with her, & went to one of her parties while I was out of town.. But again I met her and have had conversations with her, and didn’t think much of it. But their friendship started to make me feel uncomfortable and I expressed that to him. I told him I didn’t like him hanging out with her and he said his other coworkers were there everytime and “you don’t trust me?” I said I did trust him but it makes me uncomfortable and I’m setting a boundary. They’re both musicians and are on their company’s social media/creative team.. they post reels/videos on many different platforms playing music together and interviewing other musicians, etc. I think he had harbored feelings for her and saw things in her that he essentially liked better. I still can’t even think about dating or being in a serious relationship with someone new. 4 months after an engagement he’s dating his coworker!! 

My sister in law said this is a pattern of his to be a serial dater and has even left an ex for someone new in the past. He has always been in a relationship and I think 4 months of us not being together might be the longest he’s ever been without a girlfriend. I thought I could trust him because he was so close with my family and friends. I really thought I would spend my life with him. 

Writing this all out makes me realize that it’s a him problem and although I have things I need to work on, this is just who he is as a person. The beginning of the relationship was so sweet and intimate, he said I love you first (after 10 days of dating 🚩) but at the time I thought it was sweet, I told him I didn’t feel the same way but I still cared for him a lot and I know I will eventually feel the same. 

I just feel so terrible about myself and feel like I could have done things differently to avoid us breaking up. It hurts so much still. I am slowly feeling better but it affected me a lot and I don’t see myself being in a serious relationship for a long time. I am beside myself that he has the capacity to be in a new relationship.

1hrj6on,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1hrj6on,4 weeks in…Bambino Plus & DF54 REVIEW,"After 4 weeks, I can say I’m very happy with the Bambino Plus and DF54 combo. Love the small amount of counter space needed for the machine and grinder. Love the accessories I got initially and the ones I’ve added. I’m running back to back cappuccinos everyday with no problems and even ran 3 milk drinks consecutively for a couple days when my gf’s dad visited. For my needs, the Bambino is serving me extremely well. I’m still sticking by my last post in regards to what a beginner should look for in their first setup.  

Coffee beans > grinder > machine > accessories 

Some tips for Bambino owners:
You will first face the challenge of pulling a proper shot. I find the best results with 17g of dark roast (and quite oily) coffee. 18g can clog the machine, though some find a way to make it work I’m sure. Your grind needs to be fine enough but not too fine where it clogs the bambino, and not too course or it water will pass through your puck too fast. I am typically staying at the 20 setting on my DF54 that has the zero calibrated. I use the stock portafilter and single wall basket with plastic insert removed. Milk frothing and latte art will be super challenging at first, but every day you get a chance to improve. Find a milk brand that works well, I have to use non-dairy and I have a soy milk that is working for me. It can be more challenging to work with and separates faster. I’ve learned speed is key and violently spinning the pitcher and tapping it on the mat to incorporate it altogether before pouring helps a lot. YT videos will be your best friend to learn pouring techniques. See my second photo and let me know if you see a swan, a turkey, a flamingo or a lochness monster. 

I mentioned all my accessories I initially purchased in my last post (tamp, dosing funnel, dosing cup, dosing capsules, mdt tool). Since then, I’ve added a few that really make sense to me:
• A puck screen - normcore brand. This keeps the head gasket where water dispenses from clean. It’s personally annoying to have to reach under and clean that every shot so a puck screen was super nice to use. 
• A nice big rubber bar mat - makes workflow easier as there is always somewhere to set your stuff down. My gf customized a logo for me for a made up coffee shop and it turned out great. Got this on Etsy for 17 bucks. 
• Spray bottle - doesn’t have to be nice but I got normcore to match the color scheme I got going here. Helps remove the static build up in your grinder which makes coffee stick in places and potentially clog your grinder. 
• Portafilter holder - this one really isn’t necessary but I got it as a Xmas gift. Does make it pretty level for when you tamp. This is also Normcore brand.

DF54 is treating me very well. I truly enjoy the sound it makes and the grind quality. Would highly recommend at the price point. 

All in all, did not return anything I bought so far. It’s all worked well and I think I got a bit lucky and received good units with no defects. I have been drinking significantly more coffee (sometime 4 shots a day) but I’m cool with that. This hobby has been too fun. Every morning I wake up, put on some dark classical piano playlist on Spotify, and run through my workflow. Then I enjoy the best drink ever to start the day. I go to bed looking forward to the morning to do it all over again. 

I am in search of your FAVORITE BEANS particularly for espresso. Please post any recommendations in this thread. I’ve personally only been using Ruta Maya (Dark Roast) purchased from Costco so far. It works great for creamy smooth shots but I want some variety now. Cheers to some great espresso in 2024!",2,1735784409.0,espresso,2,1.0,False

My work gives me a $1000 wellness spending account and after going my whole life not liking coffee, I realized last year that I actually enjoy coffee and want to spend that money on an espresso set up. I’m a complete beginner at coffee and only drink milk drinks unless it’s a light roast drip coffee (again sorry if I’m using the wrong terminology here). I don’t think I’ll be drinking my espresso shots by themselves any time soon. 

So what would you recommend? I’ve been doing some research in this subreddit and on YouTube and I’m leaning towards a Breville Bambino + which retails for $500 on Amazon or $649.99 on the Breville website (another question would be if it’s better to order off of Amazon since it’s so much cheaper?) and then the rest of the money would go towards a grinder and accessories. I’ve also seen some good things about the Ninja Luxe though and the automation does interest me as a beginner, especially considering the low price point of the machine for what it can do.

I don’t know enough about coffee to be able to really differentiate how espresso shots taste and I currently get my latte fix from Tim Hortons (which if you don’t know is probably at the bottom tier as far as coffee goes). So I’m open to anything that is easy to use, completely within my budget, and will allow me to make milk drinks. Thank you so much in advance!",1,1735784235.0,espresso,0,1.0,False

My last day at my current location is the 4th before I transfer to a new location that we are opening.

For context today we had someone call out sick but I was on a requested and approved leave for New Year’s Eve and New Year’s Day. (However I was put in a position where I had to work New Year’s Eve last night)
So, I messaged our groups to find a cover but couldn’t find anyone. Apparently we were slammed all morning and I tried to contact the crew on to see how they were doing but no one was answering until about noon when a new crew would take over for the mid shift. I then was able to find two people to come in and help for the mid shift crew. 

At 4pm I get a call from a shift lead who tells me everyone’s pissed at me for not coming in to help today because I was expected to be there. Now, knowing my company they’re going to tell me I was not a team player for coming in today but at the same time I had a leave request submitted months ago for me to have this ONE holiday off. I also feel that the manager should not have taken these specific dates off after I requested it off first and he’s missing my last week at our location so I feel like I just got stranded during a busy time. 
But, I am preparing for the conversation with our upper boss where he tells me I should’ve been there to help after potential crew complaints and I’d like to know how I should handle it because ultimately I want to tell him in a respectful way that I am not compensated enough to be coming in during my requested time off and I do feel that if I have approved time off that it simply should be time off, no questions asked. If I was out of town I don’t know how they’d expect me to be there still. 

(moving locations in less than a week to be with a different manager is what I am looking forward to because it won’t be like this type of chaotic and unorganized however I will still have the same upper boss but am hoping some communication will work this out for us) 

In summary: how do I tell my boss respectfully that I’m not compensated enough for this shit and deserve my days off properly? ",1,1735784165.0,Advice,0,1.0,False

1hrj3dt,https://www.reddit.com/r/JapanTravelTips/comments/1hrj3dt/2_week_trip_review/,2 Week Trip Review! ,"2 Week Trip Review

I posted this itinerary before we left and almost everyone said to not do so much and leave a good chunk out. I’m so glad we didn’t listen to the advice and did what we wanted to do! I encourage people to do the same when planning. 

Day 1: Landed around 7PM, went to check in to our hotel in Ueno district and then got Ichiran and 7-11. Loved Ichiran! And our first of many Japanese 7-11 experiences was great! 

Day 2: First time navigating the JR rail at the stations, much easier than I thought it would be, especially with Google maps. Went to Shinjuku, Shibuya, Ikebukuro, and Asakusa. We did our first Donki shop and it was definitely overstimulating. Standouts from this day were taking the JR rail, Senso-ji temple at night, Kirby Cafe, Shibuya Crossing, walking around Shinjuku, Sunshine City, and the Christmas market at Skytree. 

Day 3: Disney Sea! The scale and detail of this place was amazing and so much better in person, the YouTube videos do not do this place justice. There was a lot of people in the morning, I think we got there at 7 and made it in for 8:30. Unfortunately did not get in to the Frozen ride but we did dine in the main hall of the castle. Loved the Tangled ride, Journey to the center of the universe, the food was great, and Fantasy Springs was very beautiful. 

Day 4: Explored Ueno park for a bit which was very beautiful and calm in the morning. Had some nice lattes in a local shop (Coffee Muraski), checked out of the hotel, went to Akhibara which I really loved as a gamer and someone who grew up with video games, then we took our first Shinkansen to Nagoya. The shinkansen was amazing, we saw our first glimpse of Fuji. Checked in to our Nagoya hotel, went to an Izakaya and had great food then went to do our first onsen at our hotel which really elevated our trip especially with all the walking we were doing. Onsens are so rejuvenating. 

Day 5: Had a great big Japanese buffet breakfast at our hotel and went to Ghibli Park, I really loved the Grand Warehouse and seeing Kiki’s restaurant but I didn’t know as much as my girlfriend, she loved Howls Moving Castle, the park itself is very nice to walk around in, I loved the garden area and the gift shops had great things to buy. We then made our way up to Takayama and checked in to our Japanese style hotel, and this was a highlight! The rooftop private onsen at the hotel was glorious and the free ramen at night was a nice touch. 

Day 6: We had another big Japanese breakfast buffet, I got to try Hida beef which was so tender and delicious. We went to the morning market and got really cute cat and dog drinks in a cookie cup, saw koi fish in the canal, walked around the old village and went to see a pagoda and Takayama Jinya (the old edo period government house).  We made our way to Shirakawa-go, and it was very beautiful around there, not much to do expect walk around and visit some of the houses but glad we went. Made our way down to Kyoto and checked in to our hotel afterward.

Day 7: Went to Hiroshima to visit the Peace Memorial Museum and Park, harrowing and gut wrenching. Especially being in the area where it all went down. The A bomb site was surreal and even just seeing the canals. I had my first okonomiyaki which was unfortunately a microwaved version, still enjoyed it. We took the ferry to Miyajima afterwards and it was so beautiful, the landscape, the deer, the shrine and temple on the water, the birds, we loved everything about the island and had my first oysters here, amazing food. We will be back! Made our way back to Kyoto. 

Day 8: Went to Kiyomizu Dera, the parks, temples, shrines, pagoda and village along the way are beautiful. We had a private tea ceremony in kimonos which made our experience very special. The giant bhudda, Ryozen Kannon is incredible, so glad we stumbled upon this. Went to Fushimi Inari, I was very impressed with the scale of this shrine, very beautiful! We then went to do some shopping (Pokémon Center, Nintendo Kyoto, Kiddy Land) and had dinner at a conveyor belt sushi place - delicious, but I got food poisoning :( 

Day 9: Went to Nara park, the deer are very funny and there are so many of them! It was kind of sad to see the tourists take advantage of them and mess with them, we saw one guy feed a deer his styrofoam tray for an example… Saw Todaiji Temple, amazing! After, we went to Dotonbori which was hell for me as I was still sick from the sushi last night. I really did not like this place and may have been because I was sick but wow it was dirty, loud, hectic, and had hoards of people. We saw Osaka castle which was massive, the moat around it was so impressive. We went to Pokémon Cafe which was fun and back to Kyoto.

Day 10: Went to Arashiyama monkey park, bamboo grove, and Otagi-nenbutsu - all were very beautiful. The song during the feeding for the monkeys was sort of unnecessary to me. The monkeys were so cute and funny. Bamboo grove is quite beautiful, the bamboo are so thick it’s crazy. Otaji-nenbutsu is very unique and the bhudda statues are so nice. After, tried to make it to Hoshun-in to see the bonsai but it seems it was closed that day :( Sad for me. After, Starbucks Ninenzka Yasaka Chaya, and a night stroll. 

Day 11: went to Kawaguchiko Lake and stayed at a traditional ryokan, very beautiful evening. Fuji was clear and the sunset along the lake was beautiful. We had a very enjoyable and calm night at the ryokan with an onsen and hot springs from Fujiyama.

Day 12: went to stay at a bit of an upgraded ryokan, again, relaxing, beautiful, and loved the onsen! We also saw Chureito Pagoda which was very beautiful on a sunny day! Although this onsen was just regular water. 

Day 13: Went back to Tokyo, stayed in Shinagawa as our flight was at night. The next day. We tried getting tattoos but it was quite difficult, we were in Harajuku and it was so busy, all the animal cafes sucked to see! I had a solo adventure to Tokyo station, went to Ginza, Shinjuku, and Shibuya. Did some shopping, saw a shit load of people on a busy Saturday night, tried to get Ichiran but they all had hour to two hour waiting times so I settled for premium ramen at 7-11 with some sides. Fun night!

Day 14: Went back to Harajuku to try and get tattoos from a different place, couldn’t find the place. Checked some cool stores out, did some last minute shopping. Went to the airport, and chilled before our flight! 

Left out some things but wanted to generalize it! 

Overall Japan is an amazing, tourist-friendly, clean country full of culture, amazing landscapes, tons to do, and friendly, courteous people. 

The JR rail was so impressive and easy to use. I hate the animal cafes! Loved the konbinis and shopping here. Visiting Pokémon Centers was so fun. The amount of malls and how big they were was insane! I loved how people minded their business, coming from a Western society, it was a nice change of pace. Everything was so convenient! Takayama, Miyajima, Kawaguchiko Lake were highlights, of course Tokyo too. 

Thanks for your warm hospitality and being so open to welcome tourists in your beautiful country.

I’m excited to share something I’ve been dreaming about for a while. My brother and I are planning to open a small coffee shop in the vibrant and beautiful suburb where we grew up, here in Athens, Greece. We have both spent more than a decade abroad, working and living in the USA and Ireland. 

We have found a spot and we are close to sign the lease. It’s just 200m from the center of the neighbourhood, and our focus will be on creating a cozy spot for local residents to grab great coffee, relax, and connect.

This area holds a special place in my heart—it’s where I spent my childhood, and now I want to give something back to the community. My vision is to keep it simple and welcoming: quality coffee and bagels.

I’d love to hear your thoughts:

1hrj02a,https://www.reddit.com/r/dividends/comments/1hrj02a/jm_smucker_sjm_a_dividend_aristocrat_and_staple/,J.M. Smucker (SJM): A Dividend Aristocrat and Staple in Your Pantry (and Portfolio),"JM Smucker (NYSE: SJM) is a true staple—not just in the kitchen but potentially in your portfolio. With 23 consecutive years of dividend increases, iconic brands, and a recession-resistant business model, Smucker exemplifies the reliability that dividend-growth investors seek. Here’s why SJM might be worth a closer look.

# Why Smucker Stands Out

1. **Iconic Brands**: Smucker’s portfolio includes household favorites like **Uncrustables**, **Jif**, **Milk-Bone**, **Café Bustelo**, and newly acquired **Hostess**. Over 90% of U.S. households purchase its products, ensuring steady cash flows.
2. **Dividend Growth**:
   * 23 consecutive years of increases.
   * A 6% CAGR over the past decade.
   * Current dividend yield: **\~3.9%**, with a sustainable payout ratio of 40-45%.
3. **Capital Allocation Discipline**: Smucker consistently balances growth investments with shareholder returns:
   * Focused on paying down **$500M in debt annually** to hit a leverage ratio below 3x by FY2027.
   * Returns excess cash to shareholders through dividends and opportunistic share repurchases.
4. **Attractive Valuation**: At just **10.8x forward EPS** and a **7.6% free cash flow yield**, Smucker offers an appealing entry point for conservative dividend-growth investors.

# Growth Potential

Smucker combines its legacy of stability with strategic growth initiatives across key segments:

* **Uncrustables**: This $1 billion brand (up from $1 million in 1998!) is expanding distribution and targeting new markets like schools and foodservice.
* **Hostess**: The recent $5.6 billion acquisition taps into the fast-growing snack category, with innovation driving 15% of its revenue.
* **Pet Food**: Premium brands like Milk-Bone and Meow Mix dominate, with margin expansion projected into the high 20% range.
* **Coffee**: Café Bustelo and Dunkin’ lead with consistent growth, supported by innovation in cold brews and K-Cups.

Smucker targets **10%+ EPS growth** annually, driven by innovation, pricing power, and operational efficiency.

# Risks to Consider

While Smucker offers many positives, it’s worth noting:

1. **Customer Concentration**: Walmart accounts for 33% of revenue, creating some pricing pressure.
2. **Slower Long-Term Growth**: Smucker’s core categories (e.g., peanut butter, coffee) are mature, which limits organic growth opportunities.
3. **Acquisition Costs**: Deals like Hostess reduce near-term cash flow but could pay off in the long run.

# Final Thoughts

Smucker combines iconic brands, disciplined capital allocation, and steady dividend growth, making it a great option for conservative, income-focused investors. With a forward dividend yield near multi-year highs and a shareholder yield (dividends + debt paydown) exceeding **8%**, SJM offers both stability and compounding potential.

What do you think? Does JM Smucker belong in a dividend-growth portfolio, or are there better options in the consumer staples space? Let’s discuss!",0,1735783831.0,dividends,1,0.5,False

1hrixzc,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1hrixzc,After GBC I beat Risky‘s Revenge,"Ah~ My introduction to this beautiful series.
Back then I was just a kid browsing through the AppStore when I was drawn in by the games artwork.
While it’s not hard to guess why I showed interest in a beautiful lady with a revealing outfit, it was soon the gameplay and the story that tied me to this series.

It really shows how knowing a game from having played it 4 times before, makes you better at it than a similar game that you play for the first time.
It took me 5 days to 100% Shantae GBC & only 4.5 hours to do the same for Risky’s Revenge.
Not bad for a game I hadn’t touched since before Seven Sirens came out.

Risky’s Revenge is a huge step up from the first game.
The sprites are just gorgeous, the music has more depth (although it loops terrible), the difficulty is progressive and a lot of mechanics got reworked for the better.

One thing I was surprised by though is how short the game actually is.
Half an hour in & already done with the first dungeon?
Little me was suuuper bad at games it seems😅
The game is also very easy, seeing as I didn’t get a game over more than thrice.
Something that threw me for a loop in a positive way was the reworked warp system.
Having only played the game on iOS previously, I knew the pedestals as the Warp Twins, one would warp you to the end of its area & the other back to the beginning.
Seeing them as Warp Brothers now, being able to freely warp through the map was something I did NOT expect from the Directors Cut.
What I did expect (sadly) was that I couldn’t freely swap between outfits anymore, kinda a shame, but also fun to be forced to stay with double damage when I choose it from the get go.

Interesting we’re also details that I had completely forgotten about or straight up didn’t know until I played it again.
Like Bolo giving you bribe money to find the Mayor, or the coffee side quest (though I remembered that the instant I saw Abner and Poe) & something I had to look up cause I wasn’t sure if this was a new feature, the Golden Baby Warp Squids.
I COMPLETELY forgot about them.

It’s also interesting to think about how Risky is actually successful this time around.
While Nega Shantae got destroyed, her main goal was to take revenge on Shantae for foiling her plans in the first game & by stripping her of her powers, she actually succeeded (though it does come back to bite her in PC 😅).
One detail I also didn’t think of until fighting Nega Shantae again after so long, is how her boss fight actually makes complete sense story wise.
She’s Shantae’s magical half, for all intents and purposes a full genie & this uses stronger versions of Shantae‘s transformations.
But a smaller detail, she uses only that.
She doesn’t attack with her hair once, which is according to Mimic part of her human half (that being the reason Shantae can still use it to attack).
So not being human in the slightest rebders Nega Shantae unable to use her hair.
I kinda popped off mid-battle when I realized that 😅

So what do I do when I 100% the game in a few hours?
Obviously I look up how many victory screens there are and proceed to get them all as well 😆
If I’m gonna replay (or play for the first time in GBC’s and PC‘s cases) the entire series, obviously I’m gonna get every single victory screens (I will play through HGH so many times 🤣).
Admittedly, I strongly overestimated myself & thought I could do a „perfect run“ in which I collect most of the items & beat the game sub 2 hours (any% speedrun), re-enter the same save, collect some more & beat the game (any%) & re-enter a third time to collect the rest and beat it sub 3 hours (100% speedrun).
That….didn’t work at all😓
Both because I decided to do that in magic mode (too many game over screens 🥲) & because I fumbled looking for the coffee beans and got every single item in the woods before them, resulting in me missing the sub 2 hour mark with 24/34 items.
I decided to get the last 10 items (9 Jams & 1 heart holder), but skipped buying the Mega Puff, finishing sub 3 hours with 33/34 items, giving me my second win screen.
Re-enter, but the Mega Puff, beat the final boss again, 2:53 100% & third screen.

But hey, if there’s one thing about me and games, is that I’m extremely stubborn and masochistic, meaning I absolutely love way too hard challenges (like Inner Agent 3, Sans, Champions Road(s), etc.) & Speed Running (casually at least 😅) & I always want to go at my best.
If I know I can improve even a single jump, I’ll retry as long as it takes to get that perfect run.
So I beat the game again any% in 1:50 (kinda anticlimactic to simply say it that way, I know 😅).

I really love this game.
If it wasn’t for ~~my admittedly shameful behavior~~ me finding it randomly as a child, who knows when I would have discovered this amazing franchise.
It has more than just cute girls in revealing outfits.
Gameplay, story, music, comedy….a LOT of comedy, and obviously the eye-catching girls.
Truly amazing ⭐️

NOW ONTO PLAYING PIRATES CURSE FOR THE FIRST TIME 😆 (and at least a few more times to get the win-screens unless I deem the game too long for me to do it and remain sane).


Side notes that I didn’t know where to put:
- I love how unlike the GBC game, which just had too many enemies with way too much hp (especially at night), which resulted in it being frustratingly hard, that Risky’s Revenge has a progressive difficulty spike, with several areas getting more and different enemies as you progress with the story
- I also like how there’s a “shadow” of GBC left, with Fireball and Storm Puff being mandatory to progress; GBC had some heart holders locked behind puzzles that you needed specific items from the shop for, RR has 2 mandatory spots like this (Monkey Bullet & Hypno Baron’s labyrinth) & a few Jam puzzles that need Spitfire, although it’s much easier since they are now magic instead of finite items 
- this game introduced the magic system, with times not being a finite recourse, but a perma-upgrade and I’m so thankful for that (PC will take that away from me, won’t it?)
- my favorite win screens are any% (Shantae), 100% speedrun (Rotty), any% speedrun (Beach Shantae) & 100% (Risky) in that order; Rotty IS my favorite character, yet the regular win screen looks the nicest and cutest to me; also Risky’s win screen looks kinda cursed, like I don’t like how her face looks (sorry to whoever made that artwork in the non-zero chance they see this post)

Well then, until next time, see ya when I beat Pirates Curse either once or as often as needed for all screens ⭐️",7,1735783657.0,Shantae,0,1.0,False

LETS NEVER MEET AGAIN!!,"Hi Courtney,I don’t really know how to start this so I’m just gonna start off by saying most of my stories are pretty long so I’m sorry if it gets pretty lengthy.
 
I’m gonna give you some backstory on the area I lived in. I live in a slightly larger town, but not really considered a city and at the time of this happening I was living in one of the ghetto parts of town. We would always have crazies who are probably on drugs, walking up and down our streets and just doing strange things, but our neighborhood was pretty tighten and all the grown-ups watched out for us kids who were just running around the neighborhood.

I don’t know specific dates or anything but one day when I was probably about 7 or 8 my friend and I were playing outside, playing one of our imaginary games. (As most kids do) I remember specifically we were acting like we were running away from our evil stepmother. We were in the back of my dad’s truck which was our getaway car and all of a sudden, in real life. This older gentleman starts walking up to us. I don’t know why it said gentleman. Honestly he deserves to be called a pervert. just for a reference. My driveway was a pretty long way up to my house so we saw him from pretty far, although it wasn’t strange for people to walk through our yard to get to the alleyway behind it, they never did it while we were outside, but while he was walking up, I started to run towards the house to go inside and tell my parents, but my friend decided that she was going to stay in the back of the truck and just freeze. I guess it really was like a freeze or flights kind of thing. Since my friend stayed in the truck and was not moving. I decided to stay outside so she wasn’t alone. The man walked up and got in my friends face like super close to her. He was talking about some nonsense about the Church that was behind us asking us if they had a wedding or something I don’t really remember. I just knew it was weird because I was like hey why would I know that Like I’m just a kid it’s not like I keep tabs on the Church that I don’t even go to. anyways he asked if he could just go ahead and pass through the yard and since he was already halfway through it, I said go ahead. I should not have done that after I told him that day that he could walk to the yard he took that as a sign that he could just torment us whenever he wanted. 

We had a trampoline outside in the front yard and we would play on it every day and every day we would see him either walking down the street, staring at us or hiding behind a garbage can just staring at us. It was really creepy as a kid so of course, I was kind of afraid of him. This next part I’m not sure if it happened in real life or if it was just one of my super realistic dreams that I was having back then about him. I know that every other dream wasn’t real, except for this one which leads me to believe that it actually happened. I don’t remember waking up from the dream. I just remember falling back to sleep. One night I was watching Nickelodeon at night and I heard a little tap on my window. Never did I ever dare to look outside at night time even if I didn’t hear anything. I guess you could say I was a paranoid kid but that night I had a really bad gut feeling so I slightly opened my curtain and I saw him cupping his hands over my window, trying to look in. I was paralyzed and fear. I just covered my face with my blanket and fell asleep. When I told my dad, he told me it was just a dream and that he couldn’t be looking through my window because he would need a ladder and there wasn’t a ladder by my window. We didn’t have a two story house or anything but our house was lifted off the ground because we lived in a trailer house. I was always super paranoid anytime someone came to the door or if I saw someone walking down the street I was just paranoid in general. One day he decided to actually come up and knock on the door and I hid. He asked my parents if they had any food or coffee that he could have and he was looking around the living room for me. It was an awful feeling my parents said no we don’t have any food. We’re kind of running low ourselves. They said we had a coffee packet if you really needed it but we couldn’t make it for him. He said that he would like to have the coffee packet and so my mom went and got it for him while my dad was at the door talking to him. I don’t remember what the small talk was about, but he did ask if I was home and my dad told him no. Even though my dad told him no he continued looking around the living room for me the entire time. When my parents tried to close the door and send him on his way, he decided to put his foot in the door and try to push his way in, my dad started screaming at him and told him that if he didn’t leave that he was calling the cops so the guy left, but that didn’t stop him from watching us play outside or following us while we are walking to each other‘s houses. It got so bad to the point where people would just stay out on their porches waiting for us to walk by to tell the creep to leave us alone. Mine and my brother older friend who is now an MMA fighter actually got in a fight with the guy because he was not leaving us alone so he just beat him up I guess, and after that the guy disappeared we knew where he lived, and it looked abandoned most of the time, but you could tell that there was no one living there until one day he just disappeared. His door was open. All of his furniture was just outside and we never saw him again. That was until a few years later me and my mom were just talking about him and the horrible experiences we had with him and the next day I shit you not he showed back up. I was a little bit older this time probably around 11 and he was still stalking us, but at 11 I wasn’t really outside as much just walking back-and-forth from my friends houses and maybe going to the Church park to play but I still saw him everywhere I went and he followed me a couple of times. But once again like the time before he just disappeared out of nowhere, his house was all in shambles. The door left wide open. There was talk around town that they took him to a mental institution for a while and that’s why and that he was on patrol and I guess they found out what he was doing again I don’t really know.
anyways I ended up moving off that side of town into a much safer part and I didn’t see him until I was about 16. I would just frequently see him walking around town or going into Walmart or begging for food at restaurants. I tried to stay the fuck away from him. Believe it or not I did have another run in with him. I was eating out after one of my choir concerts with a whole bunch of the kids from the choir. We were a pretty close nit group. He walked right behind me and grazed my lower back as I was getting up to go to the restroom. I literally had a panic attack. When I started freaking out he looked at me like what the hell is wrong with you and one of my guy friends from the group literally stood up and told him to walk away and he did thankfully. Honestly, even as a psycho I probably would too. There was about 12 to 15 of us. after that, I haven’t seen him. He went to jail for arson when I found that out It was a little bit after the last incident and it said that he was sentenced to 10 to 15 years. I’m 18 now and I’m about to move out of this town so to the creep who stalked me whenever I was just a little kid. I hope we NEVER MEET AGAIN!!!

I setup my tent in some trees. Got in. Hung out for a bit on here. Watched the rest of The Bee Keeper. And went to sleep.

I slept in spurts between rolling over from side to side. I was cold enough to make steady sleep impossible. I woke up at about a quarter after five in the morning, not feeling rested. Cold. A thought in my head, 'tarp burrito' I unfolded my tarp and laid it over me doubled up. The warmth started to build. I fell back asleep.

I woke up around eleven, feeling much better. Pulled the tarp out of the tent to dry in the sun. Cigarette. Gear packed. Into the truck stop for a bathroom and some coffee.

Charged my phone while enjoying some organic sumatran - my favorite - with some hazelnut cream and sugar in the raw. Great start. Out to the road.

It took about two hours to catch the first ride. A guy from Greenwood going back home to visit his mom. We talked a little life philosophy. He started to drop me off in the middle of town off the highway I was on. I politely asked if he would deop me back on the 49. ""Sure, no problem. I get dropped outside of town next to a huge cross.

There's nothing out here but farm land. No gas station, nothing. The sun is setting. He told me when he dropped me off that I was in the poorest part of the country, predominantly black. I look around and see a decent spot to camp, but I'd really like to keep going and get back near some sign of civilization. Gear down, thumb out.

Several cars go by. Some curious looks. Some enthusiastic waves. 'Well, at least people are friendly.'

An old farmer/ex drinker and drug addict stops to pick me up. We get to talking. Usual stuff. ""Where you going?"" ""Where ya from?"" A story about how he picked up a guy with rainbow colored hair with a broke down motor cycle in the freezing rain a couple years ago out here. Multicolored hair is none too common out here on the delta. Then he says, ""You're in a really black area. Don't fuck with them. I mean it. These are not the type of black people your used to."" 

He drops me off across the street from a gas station/restaurant. Deep in farm land. There's a Dollar general, the gas station, a handful of houses, and nothing else. I spot some semi trailers across the dirt lot I'm on, say thank you very much, grab my gear, and head straight to go hide between the trailers. With the warning he gave me I'm a bit nervous. The sun's down but it's still light out. I'm hoping nobody saw me.

I drop my gear under tha back of a trailer and start pacing back and forth to keep warm and wait for it to get dark. I really don't want to be seen. I figure it's about as dark as it's gonna be here with the one street light off in the distance.

I grab my gear, start putting up my tent between a couple trailers as out of sight as I can get. I should be good until morning. I'll probably need to get up at first light in the freezing cold, pack my gear and get out before anybody sees me. That'll suck, but you gotta do what you gotta do. Headlights pull into the lot. Shit. There coming directly at me. 'This is probably not gonna be good.'

A guy I can't see gets out. Asks me what I'm doing. ""I'm just traveling through. I got dropped here. I was just gonna spend the night and be out in the morning. I'm not here to cause any trouble."" At this point were close enough I can see a badge on his belt. 'Oh, a cop.' ""Unless you know of a better spot"" I say.

""I saw a tent and thought I'd come over and see what was going on. My family owns this land and you have permission to be here tonight. You have ID on you and all that?"" ""Yeah sure do. Here you go."" ""I'll get back with you in little while."" He goes to his patrol car, I go back to setting up my tent. 'That's a new one.'

A few minutes later he comes over. Hands me my ID, and says, ""Ok. You're good to go. You have permission to be here. Have a good night."" ""Thanks! I really appreciate it."" ""No problem."" Back to setting up the tent.

Not five minutes later anothe patrol vehicle pulls up. I walk over. Say hi. I start to explain I just talked to another officer, he gave me permission be here. The new cop says, ""I know. He just told me. I'm just checking to see if you're alright."" ""I'm good. Thank you."" ""You're not hungry?"" 

I could've used a meal at this point but between the warning from dude and two cops now I say I'm good. I don't want to go where people can see me. I figure it will take about eight minutes before everyone in town knows I'm here. Dude gave me a twenty when he dropped me off and said there's good food across the street. My paranoia says tomorrow when it's light out will be a better time to make my appearance. 

Tent finally setup. Gear in. Pad unrolled. Sleeping bag on pad. Tarp over Sleeping bag. Shoes off. Feet dry. I get in my 'bed' and get comfy. Grab my phone to relate the days happenings to you lovely people... And another vehicle pulls in, lights my tent up. Brights on. Brights off. Tent lit up like daylight.

Get out of the bag. Shoes on. Out of the tent. Walk over.

It's cop #2. ""Hey how's it going?"" I ask. ""Here you go."" He hands me a ten with an empathetic look in his eye. ""Ah thanks so much"" I say. ""Have a good night"" he tells me. Off he goes. Back in the tent. Back to bed. 

I'm warm but my feet are cold. And of course I have to pee. Time to dig some socks out of the pack...",44,1735783423.0,vagabond,20,0.98,False

These conversations are inspiring for me and I hope they could be for you, too. When I went to art school on the east coast 20 years ago we would do critiques as peers and I miss it! I’d be up for giving/receiving some [constructive] critiques.

A little about me and what I’ve been up to:
Since we’re in the colder months and I prefer to stay warm and cozy, I’m taking advantage of the time indoors to do an archives project- scanning my negatives from college!!!! Three binders of them! The process is bringing back some really fun memories I had with friends back then who loved art as much as I did.

Well you see, I just finished the anime and before you type out your comment on what a grave mistake I have made and the likes. Let my stop you right there. 

I knew how the trilogy would go in general and also the murderer in the final case as I enjoy gaming as a whole and with the franchise being pretty big I knew the general way of Phoenix Wright way before booting up the first episode.

With the two seasons done now I see myself confronted with a particular problem. Obviously, I now know how the cases of the trilogy play out, well except for one of course.
 
Asking the Ace Attorney Subreddit if it is stil worth my time to play the Trilogy seems like a pretty stupid idea but here I am anyways, a foolish fool who in his foolishness forgot that it may be a good idea to actually play the games first.

I know basically nothing about the contents of Apollo Justice nor Edgeworth's games but for both these sets I see very conflicting takes on how good they are out there in this subreddit.
So now I sit here wondering if I even like the visual novel style gameplay as I have yet to play one.

So to put my rambling into a shorter question:
What do the games bring to me that I may have missed from the show adaptation? Will it be worth my time already knowing the answers and are the other games good for newcomer to jump into?

Or to phrase it as something you may actually understand: 
What good does drinking a cup of self ground coffee just for the sake of it bring me after getting my coffein fix from a cheap powder alternative mixed with water?

I'm studying sustainability, working part time and saving for a wedding next April. 

So I want to reduce my consumption for the planet, but also pay off my debt and work on changing my reliance on the dopamine hit that comes with purchasing things.

So posting here to be accountable.

No purchasing:
- Takeaway coffees (unless with a friend)
- Work lunches 
- Takeaway dinners (keep to a minimum, dine in if I'm planning to eat out with my partner)
- No new clothing
- No makeup / skincare until I totally run out. I don't have a huge collection, but I do have enough.
- No house items unless they're planned with my partner

Low purchasing:
- Concert tickets are my biggest cost. I want to go to more small, local shows which are cheaper and also support artists more. Bigger shows I will only commit if I haven't seen them recently, or they're a top artist of mine. Most of my fave bands have toured recently so I think this is achievable
- I will trade / giveaway / take items from my local Buy Nothing groups, but I won't pick up things on a whim.

Yes:
- I'll continue to donate to the climate charity I volunteer for
- Repairs - I have a broken coffee machine and a bike that needs servicing, plus some clothing that needs tailoring. I'll save to get these fixed 
- Gifts - have a few weddings and 30th this year, so I'll chip in for gifts. But I'll aim to gift experiences rather than items.

I hope it's okay if I post this. I feel like it would be a good thing to discuss with a parent but... Unfortunately, my parents and I aren't on talking terms... So, can I ask for your opinion on this situation. What would you do/feel?

I have (had?) a friend, whose vibes been off since I had my baby. I took a month off from hanging out with anyone but prior to this we had been hanging out daily, constantly interacting and engaging each other. Since my hiatus, new people have joined our friend group. Though, I feel like a 3rd wheel because I've been gone a while. 

Let me know if you need more back story because there's been other moments that I was like OK maybe it's not just hormones.

Here's some specific situations:

1)I've seen my friend and the two new people together hanging out without having received a text asking if I wanted to join. Which was after this situation :

2)asking if this friend wanted to hang and her saying yeah she's got nothing going on. So we were literally in the middle of making plans when in the group chat one of the new people messaged about wanting to do something and Friend said yes, but then ghosted me. 

3)Fast forward, she and I had plans to spend the day before our friends group christmas party to make goodies. I confirmed with her twice in advance. 
The evening before, I messaged asking what time she wanted to come over. She said she was getting coffee with one of the new people in the morning. I had to ask a few times before I found out she had other plans and wasn't actually planning on coming over.

So I had gotten her presents during this whole fiasco because it's the holidays. Got the young kids loaded in the car and called her like hey is she home (she was at one of the new girls apartment) and I was like well I have your Christmas gift, can I drop them off and just leave them in front of her door? (okay so no worries about things being stolen so no worries) 
She literally said no. Like she was saying she was wanting to do it when she also had a gift for me so it was equal but I told her I wasn't expecting anything in exchange. She repeated she didn't want them until she had something for me, so I let up like okay I don't want her to feel uncomfortable. The weird thing is our other friends have gifted her presents but as far as I'm aware there was no stipulations on reciprocation so this has me confused. 

So now it's the 2nd here and I haven't heard anything more from her so like what do I do? 

Do I just return her gift because I don't really want it lol it's literally dentist art  like a tooth implant that's big and framed. (she is a dental hygienist and loves teeth) I already gave my older kid her other gift that was like a jaw model and the kid loves it. 

Her birthday is a few weeks away so do I just give it to her the? 

Do I just... Idk.... What do I do? 
Any advice or words of wisdom would be greatly appreciated 🥲

1hriorp,https://www.reddit.com/r/Sedevacantists/comments/1hriorp/confused_with_church_history/,Confused with Church history,"This is not a troll post. I recently attended Mass at a sedevacantist mission chapel. I don't remember what is the name of the group, but as soon as I entered all women were veiled and wearing long dresses. All men were wearing suits. All children were nicely dressed. The chapel itself had no pews. Everyone stood through the entire Mass. The Mass was quite long, about 2 hours long. At the end of the Mass, everyone went to kiss the priest's hand. I was so confused because I've never experienced that in other TLM churches. I went to talk to the priest after most people left to another room for some coffee and cookies. I asked the priest a question and I was astonished at his answer. I asked ""what would a real Catholic society look like?"". He smiled and said it was the first time someone asked this question. He went to get his computer to read from a Google Docs he had written in the past.

It said (he sent me a copy) :

""Only the most devout and demonstrably sinless would be allowed to attend the liturgy physically inside the nave. The unworthy would observe from outside, prostrating as a sign of their penitence. Every liturgy would last no less than 3 hours, including the chanting of parts of the Psalter, and public penitential rites. Latin would be the only liturgical language, and attendees would be required to demonstrate proficiency in it. Homilies would be short (max 10 minutes) and in the vernacular language. The faithful would fast for 24 hours before receiving Communion, abstaining from all food and drink except bread and water, or from midnight if attending Mass everyday. The Adoration of the Blessed Sacrament would happen at all times outside of liturgy. Communion would be regarded as so holy that Catholics would receive it only after having gone to confession earlier that day or on the preceding day. Marriage would be permitted for sterile people only if they commit to complete continence. Marriage would be permitted for others only if they make vows to be fruitful and multiply. Adult baptism (for converts) would require the catechumen to endure physical and spiritual trials, such as fasting for 40 days, sleeping on stone floors, and proving doctrinal orthodoxy in public debates. Clergy would undergo decades of ascetic training, including living in wilderness hermitages, before ordination. A priest found guilty of any grave sin would be stripped of his office and sent to live as a penitent hermit for life. Bishops would rule their dioceses as absolute monarchs, answerable only to the Pope. Disobedience to a bishop would result in immediate excommunication. The Pope would hold direct and immediate authority over all temporal and spiritual matters, and his decrees would be enforced with the threat of excommunication. Any deviation from Catholic doctrine, no matter how minor, would be punished with excommunication, ensuring doctrinal purity. The Bible and the teachings of the Church Fathers, and teachings of the Magisterium would be the only permissible sources of study for clergy. All other texts would be removed from seminaries. Every Catholic would be required have the Catechism, the Psalter, and key theological texts in book format at home. Every Catholic would undergo tests by their parish to prove their knowledge. The Church would govern all nations directly, with secular governments abolished. Every individual would live under canon law, with bishops acting as judges in all civil and criminal matters. All non-Catholics would be required to convert or face exile. Non-Catholic places of worship would be destroyed, and their religious texts burned. Apostolic Churches (like the Orthodox Churches) would be tolerated, as destroying their churches or books would be sacrilege. All modernist, liberal, and relativist technology, art, and culture would be banned. During Lent, every Catholic would fast every day except Sundays and solemn feasts, abstaining from meat, dairy, and luxury foods entirely. It would be encouraged to fast from all food and water during the day during Lent (like Muslims do) and only eat after Compline and stop eating before Matins. Catholics would be required to report on the spiritual and moral conduct of their neighbors, ensuring that no grave sin goes unpunished. Silence would be the default mode of Mass. The faithful would be required to spend the time in church in prayer and meditation. A loud voice in church would only be permitted when the liturgy permits it. Worldly talk would be banned in church until the end of the liturgy, during coffee hour. All schools would be run by the Church, teaching theology, Latin, and sacred history. Relativist sciences and philosophies would be eradicated as distractions from the pursuit of holiness. All books, artworks, and media not explicitly approved by the Church would be banned. Libraries, museums, and historical sites associated with non-Catholic cultures would be dismantled to eliminate any distractions from the faith. Orthodox libraries would be accepted. Non-Catholic nations would be invaded and their governments overthrown. Missionaries would be required to live lives of extreme poverty, embracing martyrdom as their ultimate goal.""

We have a brand new higher end coffee table and today my daughter her a black washable marker that she smudged on the coffee table. She’s 2.5years old so it was an accident. It was not a big area by any means, but I smudged it more by using the dry eraser end of the marker to “erase it off”.  It removed most of it but kind of spread it out a little bit more in smudge form even though it was much lighter at that point. I should’ve left it as is because to anyone else, it wouldn’t have been noticeable but I personally couldn’t unsee it. My biggest mistake to continue fixing it was then to get on Google to see how to clean a black marker smudge off a wood table. One of the options was nail polish remover and like an idiot, I applied some nail polish remover to the small area without even thinking about it. Huge mistake. It clearly made the entire thing worse and removed the wood/stain. I am at a loss of what to do and just devastated because this is a brand new table. I think the area is too big to be hidden by a wooden marker touch up. Do I need to just find a wood stainer that is a close enough match to apply to the flawed area?

2. If I need a small business loan at some point after I started my business, do you think there is any difference if I have LLC or S Corp? I mean, Do loan lenders  approve loans easier if I have S Corp?

3. I talked to some companies and they offer to give me coffee machines for free in the beginning. Of course I need to pay monthly and I need to buy coffee from them all the time. Do you suggest this option, or should I buy my own machine and being independent even if it will increase my initial cost.

Other details I remember (some of which may be inaccurate):

* It was specifically about public/council housing in the UK.
* It focused on [Missing middle housing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Missing_middle_housing) — medium density multifamily housing like midsized apartments and row homes, rather than high rises or standalone houses.
* It was about building communities that work for mothers, children, intergenerational households, etc.

I (38M 6ft/183cm American of European ancestry) finally weigh 165lbs/74.8kg/11.8st. I have not been this weight since I was a teenager.

I think 165 is the ***ideal*** weight for a six foot tall man, who is not an athlete, mil/leo, or laborer.

###How did I do this?

Two months ago, on Halloween, I was clocking in at 196 lbs. I responded to a social media ad for compounded semaglutide, subscribed for only two shipments, and injected myself—it’s painless. The only weird part is the extra time you have from absence of meals—and all the planning and cooking that went into them.


I modified my titration schedule, and reshot myself every four days instead of seven.

Now the goal is to reset my “point weight” to 165. I intend to microdose with the remaining sema. (The compounding pharmacy sent me way more product than I need, yay!)


###Marijuana.

Smoked a lot of it throughout because semaglutide makes you tired af and it feels draining, so the weed helped allieviate that—without munchies.

###Food.

Ate about 1000 calories or less daily for two months, basically a tin of fish, pasta or grains, and a fruit or vegetable.

Honey, yes [honey](https://bowtiedfarmer.com/products/farmers-no-mess-honey), can provide protective reproductive benefits for young men and women. I'm not going to say this is the end all be all but I'm betting if you improve your diet overall, go to the gym, workout, you can probably get added benefit from including honey - say by putting [honey in your coffee](https://bowtiedfarmer.com/blogs/all-about-honey/honey-in-coffee) instead of sugar.

The plan right now is to get a deep L-shaped sectional which backs to the front door and bay window. We would also like to incorporate a second piece of furniture in the “dead zone” that faces the tv and fireplace, perhaps an extra-deep lounge sofa or a chesterfield style large lounge. A coffee table seems to make sense with this layout, right in the middle of the rug. 

We would also like to consider different colors and textures for the furniture, such as a green velvet for the couch and leather for the secondary piece. Included are some items we have bookmarked as well. 

Is there a better design for our living room layout? Comfort is our primary goal but we also want it to be aesthetically pleasing. Our style is described as being “rustic modern”.

Background info, I'm 20F, I've had emetophobia as long as I can remember but the last few months it's reallyyy went from 0-100. I considered myself pretty recovered. I didn't think about vomiting unless I felt nauseous not due to foods I ate like dairy or coffee etc. Ended up developing severe ARFID. 

I've had a rocky relationship with my sister (22) even before this, but most of it isn't relevant to what's happening now. Most of it has to do with her trying to parent or therapize me and in general being not supportive. 

She's getting married this July. In September we had a talk and she said she didn't have the ""confidence"" that I could stand up in her wedding without getting anxious or dizzy or drawing attention to myself or eat around people without drawing attention to myself. Later I told her how hurtful it was. If I had an only physical illness, it would be incredibly rude to say any of those things. If someone was in a wheelchair or had cancer or kidney failure or something, you wouldn't worry about them taking attention away from you, you'd accommodate them if you can. 

She's said a lot of hurtful things about me not caring about her and stuff and I've told her my first priority right now is myself and recovery because I truly don't have the energy to maintain my relationships right now. I'm on leave from work and school right now. 

She's had some relationship struggles the last few weeks and was experiencing anxiety (doesn't have an anxiety disorder, just gets anxious on occasion). She said it was embarrassing I saw her like that and I said she's seen me at worse situations and she said ""well that's different"". She was saying how she felt out of control of her brain and body and she couldn't stop shaking. 

My question is, how do you deal with family members that make your recovery process more difficult? If any of my friends treated me the way she treats me, they wouldn't be a part of my life. When I have convos with her about it, she gets defensive and yells and insults. I'm her maid of honor and we have a tight knit family, and we live with our parents when she's home from school so cutting her out is not an option. ",2,1735780431.0,emetophobiarecovery,1,1.0,False

I love self help - I have anxiety and have had depression on and off. I read a \*ton\* of romance at night but that's not really what I want to be reading while watching my kid.

How Would you vision a 4th Season of META RUNNER I liked the show started thinking about it again after read Ninja Turtles the Last Ronin(which I recommend reading for the 3rd time along with its Prequel and Sequel) and Marvel 2099 comics by Steve Orlando(which I also recommend) and and the current Transformers comics by Skybound/Image Comics because the setting of these comic reminded me of Meta Runner and made me think and really to many comics ether about Robots and/or the Future 

Which got me thinking how Would a Hypothetical 4th season of Meta Runner would be like you know since would be picking up where we Last left off the characters there probably be some plot points that need to be explored like how does Tari return to a physical body and what type of Villain should there be for 4th season personally I like season 4 to be basically ""Tari and friends"" at least for first half never really got that then Villain really shows up for the 2nd act so we can see the little moments like Tari getting Coffee and Silica City during the day and afternoon hours would be interesting to see

Basically my version of Season 4 or any form of continuation one of the themes would be ""now what?""

Speaking of a Hypothetical season 4 should show more of the city like its park or something

There's the fact Glitch has improved animation wise can you imagine how a season 4 would look like?

But that's me how do Vision it? Like how much time has passed since  Season 3 and how Would the tone of it be  compared to Seasons 1-3?

Where do I start?

Back in 2022 I (22F, at that time was 20) started seeing this guy Z I worked with. We only went out for about two months. We went out on a couple of dates, all was going well. One day we slept together and in the morning, I know I was acting weird but I was so on guard from previous times that he was going to completely lose interest after we slept together. After I leave I then do kind of shut down for the next couple of days waiting for the moment he tells me he’s no longer interested - so I understand I didn’t deal with things correctly here. Well well well, three days later he lets me know that he doesn’t think we are the right match. 

Two months later he’s in a relationship. 

My issue is, I’ve never been as infatuated and seemingly “into” someone since him. Like I would genuinely be imagining our life together and we weren’t ever even officially together. 

Since then I’ve been out with a few people but even ended things because I don’t feel my feelings are developing at all. 

Recently 4 months ago I met someone called A (24m) and we live about 2.5hrs apart so don’t get to see each other much. But he’s never been in a relationship before so I think he’s very eager for this to turn into one. I do like him a lot and we get on but the thing that’s holding me back is I feel he lacks a lot of motivation which is really important to me. He even asked me to be official and I said I want to get to know him better first so things aren’t off the cards. But he’s so nice and literally tells me I’m perfect. 

Two weeks ago Z messages me catching up on what we’ve been doing, jobs, life etc and then he also says that he realises he didn’t handle things right those couple of years ago and if i can forgive him if I’d like to meet up for a coffee. 

I told him I’m seeing someone and (he was always a bit too confident) asks me how serious and that if needed he will wait for me!

I wouldn’t meet up with Z while still seeing A, but I feel now I know Z wants to see me it’s really clouding my judgement with A. Still after all these years I can safely say I’m into and attracted to Z and he has that motivation in life! But am I putting him on a pedestal? 

Do I try things properly with A and if not see Z? But I feel my judgement is always going to be bias now I know Z wants to see me again

Little bit about me, I'm 25F quite small in size and height and I've been busboy/barback for about 3 years now. I work out decently, but clearly not enough for my new job. I recently started working for a company that organizes outdoor events in Montreal.

The last one I did attracted about 60,000 people (new year's event). We had 28 bars to tend to + 1 kitchen to make hot wine, coffee, hot water (we're about 15 busboys? unsure). I worked 13 hours pretty much non-stop lifting 18L Cambros, 18L water jugs over my head. At the end, I felt a sharp electric-like pain in my upper back and my feet were super sore. There's a lot of mud and snow that makes our work harder when we have to transport the bottles/soft drinks/bar material. 

Do you guys have good exercises I could implement at the gym and/or daily life or recommendations to help me not break my back and body? Thank you!

  
TLDR : working in a very high volume event, body not strong enough. Asking for tips to get stronger or more efficient. Thank you!",5,1735779614.0,bartenders,6,1.0,False

1hrhikl,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskDocs/comments/1hrhikl/thoughts_on_selfdiagnosing/,Thoughts on self-diagnosing?,"I’m just wondering what doctors thoughts are on self diagnosing, specifically when a diagnosis wouldn’t help your life anyways.

I (25F, 57kg, 161cm) suffer from what I have just labeled as migraines, because it really checks all the boxes of it. It started popping up when I was 21, my sister’s diagnosed with migraines and my dad’s side of the family all struggle with the same “My head just stops functioning to the point I need the day off, if I don’t sleep enough”. 

It’s not chronic, and I can generally avoid them by cutting out alcohol, having a regular sleep schedule and cutting out stress factors, the exact advice for avoiding migraines. And on bad days, I also have to avoid coffee, chocolate, smoked meat and chili, as I’ve experienced all of them trigger it if I’m not at my best.

Because of that, I’ve gotten them down from experiencing migraines several times a week to once every second month. But when it happens, it usually starts with a loss of language. I can’t pronounce words correctly and start saying completely different words than I mean (like saying “lemon” when I mean “cucumber”), sometimes my mother tongue becomes a completely foreign language and I can only guess what is being said. Then the headache comes. Usually feeling like my eye is getting loose and someone’s carving it out with a spoon. The rest is just pain. It tones down if I lock myself into a dark room, sometimes temporarily disappear, but mostly stay until late evening or carry on for the entire next day. I can sometimes work if it’s mostly just physical labour in dim lights, but a screen kills me and I’ve had to leave early or cancel school because of it. 

My dad’s generally very against self diagnosies and wants me to visit a doctor about it, but personally, I don’t see how a professional diagnosis would change my life at all. ",1,1735779393.0,AskDocs,1,1.0,False

1hrhdnt,https://i.redd.it/fgsvuwg3ahae1.jpeg,Haul & product review✨,"from the cyber monday sale !! been needing to rebuy & restock after finishing a few products. 
a lot of my staple products in my skin care & routine are glossier ✨ here are some opinions: 

body hero dry oil: i’ve been using this product since September 2022 & i love it. its apart of my full body routine when i want to feel extra good about myself. it’s got a great subtle scent that mixes with the soaps i use in the shower. i apply it when my skins still a lil wet & it’s not very oily. makes my skin feel soft afterwards and supple! 

cloud paint (dune): ive been using cloud paint for ten years, and love it. it’s my staple routine face product for a natural look. i wanted to try to get a bronzer to contour with cloud paint blushes and this was perfect for me! i need a time size at most and apply along my jaw, cheeks, and nose. it blends well and is very natural glowy look. highly recommend! 

haloscope (quartz): another product i’ve been using for years and love as a staple in my collection. very natural glowy dewy look. only downside is it’s sticky sometimes and when it’s on my nose and i drink a coffee it’ll stick lol 

glossier You: finally got a sample of this to try and i really love it! it’s strong but in a very natural refreshing way. it blends and layers well. i got a full size bottle for christmas after getting to try this sample and i love it ☻ i personally apply a bit on my chest, wrists, and neck! 

cleanser concentrate: another bad boy ive been using for two years. love it, i use it every other day or so to really clean my skin. i swear afterwards i can see all my pimples come to the surface so i can treat them more effectively. along side this i also use the regular cleanser for my daily washes! ♡ 

overall i love all these products and these are my continuous staples i use and enjoy daily! thanks for the yap ✨
