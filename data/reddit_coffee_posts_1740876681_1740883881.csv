1j1guh4,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1j1guh4,"Row On 5 * (London, Feb 2025)","Row on 5 has been mentioned here a few times without much detail, so I thought I'd take a moment to fill in the gaps. I apologise for the quality of my photography - never been a big skill of mine. 

The restaurant was opened in November by Jason Atherton, who should need no introduction, with the kitchen headed up by Spencer Metzger, who has spent most of his career at The Ritz. The team opened up a similar concept, Row on 45 in Dubai, quickly earning 2* last year.

The UK Michelin Guide awarded Ro5 1* around the time of my visit, and I would say this is purely a function of the short time the restaurant has been open. It stands way above the crop of other 1* restaurants in London and (for me) would be strong at 2*, being in the same bracket as, and maybe even a bit better than, Kitchen Table. It sits in my top 5 meals in London and my top 10 globally for sure; I just haven't worked out exactly where in those yet.

Row on 5 occupies one of the most expensive addresses in London, Savile Row, and is next door to where the Beatles' famous rooftop concert took place. The restaurant has been fitted out to match, plush materials everywhere, and feels genuinely luxurious. You move from the downstairs lounge for snacks, up to the main dining room, then back down again for petits fours and digestifs. The air of luxury is set nicely by the very first impression, where the host offers to have your coats dry cleaned - for no additional cost - as you dine. Service is charming throughout, it feels as if they have stolen the best of the best from London's other restaurants. Dishes are generally served by chefs, all of whom are personable, but the rest of the team is outstanding too, a particular highlight being an infectiously enthusiastic sommelier (whose name I looked up afterwards - Roxane Dupuy). It's worth noting at this point that the restaurant serves some serious wines in its pairings. There are three levels, with the first two relatively close together price-wise. I chose the second, which included Egon Muller Scharzhofberger, a Dauvissat 1er Cru, and The Mascot. Pours are quite small, but it is refreshing to see a restaurant serving such serious wines as part of a pairing. There is an extensive by-the-glass menu with prices to suit all budgets, and the bottle list is a weighty tome hundreds of pages long. 

Let's get onto the food!

Snacks:

Oyster and Pearls - introduced as being inspired by the famous Thomas Keller dish. Macaron base with chives, then N25 Kaluga caviar topped with a sphere of oyster cream glazed in Beurre Blanc. This made me realise instantly I was in for a superb meal - technically impressive and tasted great.

Raw Cornish Bluefin tuna in a tartlet made from a reduced and dried tuna bone stock, marinated in fermented yuzu and chile, and with a crispy kombu nest on top. Well-flavoured tuna as I expected from previous occasions I have tried the produce from this trial UK fishery. 

'Cheese and Onion' - onions cooked slowly with rice to form a soccarat which is then baked and layered with 50-month Lincolnshire Poacher cheese, an onion jam which was like an intense brown sauce, and lemon thyme. Very bold flavours here and a nod to childhood British foods like the cheese and pickle sandwich.

(Not pictured) Langoustine claw tempura (a big big claw!) with a galangal and langoustine stock emulsion. Delicate, and very good - the emulsion was fantastic - and this course has one little non-food-related surprise I will leave for others to discover which was quite cool.

Now we move upstairs and to the more substantial dishes...

The rest of the langoustine! The tail is very lightly cooked, brushed with smoked vinegar, and topped with something crisp (not sure what) and shiso flowers. This came with finger lime, curry leaf oil, and salted duck egg sabayon. The langoustine was wonderful but the saucing was even better.

Half an Orkney scallop - would have been a huge one when whole - with a chilli-infused scallop coral XO, salmon roe and sansho leaf in a sake, chive and pike roe beurre blanc. Accurately cooked and flavourful scallop and again, superb saucing. I would say the well-known scallop dishes Core has served beat this out but it was still excellent and to be honest that is a very high level to compare it with. 

Laminated brioche with a honey glaze and served with chicken skin and yeast butter, topped with chicken skin, lemon thyme, and a cep concentrate. Technically excellent, tasted great, a bit messy to rip apart! To be honest, I would love to see the sourdough fad come back for bread courses, brioche has become a bit too ubiquitous in London recently and the amazing bread at Muse for instance provided more joy than this. 

No comparing this dish against other restaurants - it was one of the best fish dishes I have had in years. Lightly aged turbot brushed in brown butter and lemon juice, served with a delightful variant of a sauce Albufera made from a turbot bone stock and which had cured monkfish liver blended into it. In the sauce were some flavourful razor clams, and it was finished with a touch of lovage oil. One of the simpler dishes served, but absolutely stunning, and one which could happily grace any restaurant with any number of stars in the world. 

Sika deer, briefly aged and cooked rare over pine and juniper wood. This had great depth of flavour and came with some equally remarkably flavourful beetroot and a little blackcurrant puree. This was topped with brined and smoked bone marrow and sprinkled with sansho pepper. There was a venison stock, mushroom, port and juniper sauce - massively complex again, as with all the saucing here. Served separately, there was a fried dim sum of the braised haunch. Deer will never be my favourite meat, but I enjoyed this a lot.

Cheese course! Colston Basset Stilton tart with white chocolate, a gel of either quince or apple I think (sorry, forgot here!) and lemon verbena flowers. Sounds crazy, I was sceptical, but it in fact worked incredibly well, especially alongside the port served with it. 

(Not pictured). A citrus pre-dessert with a variety of citruses from a farm near the Pyrenees that they were very proud to source from, which were expressed in the form of a curd on the base and a topping of east-Asian style shaved ice. In between the two of these was Sauternes jelly. A dusting of kaffir lime leaf finished the dish off. Refreshing!

An artful and complex dessert which I struggle to remember the full composition of. A chocolate mousse, chocolate sphere, miso caramel fudge, salted Jerusalem artichoke, hazelnut and a coffee sabayon - I think! It was great anyway. I might have liked to get the Jerusalem Artichoke flavour over a tiny bit more, but then I am one of these people who prefers my dessert to be invaded by bits of herbs and vegetables which I know is controversial. 



And then downstairs for plus fours and digestifs! I am not going to go into great detail on these - they were notably excellent - but as you may have guessed from talking about the dessert above, sweets are never the highlight of my meal. I will mention briefly the 70+ per cent dark chocolate tart served just melted with smoked olive oil, as well as the little draws with a bewildering variety of other little treats you can see in the last pic (matcha tart may have been my favourite, though there was also a pretty cool hay caramel and a cobnut praline. 

Overall a stellar meal. High quality ingredients, technically spot-on cooking, some invention, and superb saucing that will stick with me. Finances permitting I am keen to get back as soon as the next menu is launched. The dinner is not cheap, at £250 for food alone, but I would say it is worth it. I preferred Row on 5 to, for instance, The Ledbury, which is pretty good going after such a short time and I am sure the Michelin inspectors will be back with at least one more star next year.

Dear \[Agent’s Name\],

I am seeking representation for my suspense novel, *Echoes in the Snow* (approximately 65,000 words). Blending the brutal reality of survival with an emotional journey of self-discovery and loss, this suspenseful novel will appeal to readers of both survival fiction and literary drama—especially fans of *The Crash* by Freida McFadden and *The Great Alone* by Kristin Hannah.

Olivia Hart never expected to see Jace Mendoza again, let alone be trapped in a car with him. But when a blizzard strands them in the remote Wyoming mountains on the way to a mutual friend’s wedding, the past they’ve both tried to bury resurfaces with a vengeance. Jace, a former soldier who once shattered Olivia’s heart, is now her only shot at survival. But as the frigid conditions turn deadly, old wounds reopen, and Olivia must decide if she can trust the man who once walked away.

With dwindling supplies, treacherous terrain, and the relentless cold closing in, Olivia and Jace must rely on each other to make it out alive. But survival means more than just enduring the storm—it means facing the truths that tore them apart. And when Jace falls dangerously ill, Olivia is forced to confront the one thing scarier than losing him before: losing him for good.

I am the self-published author of *Under the Sweet Gum Trees*, a young adult contemporary novel that explores themes of emotional abuse and depression. Since its publication, I have sold over 200 copies and gained valuable experience navigating the publishing process and engaging with readers.

Sincerely,  
strawberryshortycake

First 300 words:

The late afternoon sunlight filtered through the blinds, throwing soft, golden streaks across the living room floor. I discarded my purse and stack of mail onto the coffee table, except for a single ivory envelope. I stared at the neat, cursive handwritten address. Ms. Olivia Hart. My eyes flickered between my name and the return address. My heart leaped when I saw the sender’s name, a name I had not spoken in several months. I dropped onto the couch and carefully opened the envelope. Inside, a beautifully ornate wedding invitation awaited. I traced the embossed lettering with my fingers, feeling the faint ridges beneath my touch.

Maria was my first friend when I started teaching. We were both first-year teachers, fresh out of college, thrust headfirst into the chaotic world of kindergarten at Willow Creek Elementary School. It was the kind of chaos that forced you to trauma bond, and that is exactly what we did. We became close friends by navigating the tangled web of lesson plans, parent-teacher conferences, and the almost never-ending energy of five-year-olds.

In those days, Maria and I worked closely together, trading classroom management tips, sharing creative bulletin board ideas, and staying late to create miniature wonderlands in our classrooms. Weekends became our lifeline—cheap wine, venting, and a much-needed escape from the endless demands of our new career. The other teachers noticed our bond almost immediately. If someone spotted one of us walking the halls alone, they inevitably teased, “Where’s your partner in crime?” It became a running joke, but there was truth behind it.

1j1gojs,https://www.reddit.com/r/u_theonlineforyou/comments/1j1gojs/how_to_practice_gratitude_for_a_happier_life/,How to Practice Gratitude for a Happier Life,"Gratitude is a powerful emotion that can transform the way we perceive our lives. By focusing on the positive aspects of our existence, we shift our mindset and invite more happiness into our everyday experiences. When practiced regularly, gratitude can improve your mental well-being, foster stronger relationships, and increase overall life satisfaction. But how can we cultivate gratitude in our daily lives? Here are a few simple yet impactful ways to practice gratitude and lead a happier life.

# 1. Start a Gratitude Journal

One of the easiest and most effective ways to practice gratitude is by keeping a gratitude journal. Each day, take a few moments to write down three things you're grateful for. These can be big or small—perhaps a supportive friend, a delicious meal, or the warmth of the sun. The key is to focus on the positive moments that bring joy or peace to your life. Over time, this simple ritual can shift your perspective, helping you notice and appreciate the good things that might otherwise go unnoticed. A gratitude journal is a reminder that even on challenging days, there is always something to be thankful for.

# 2. Express Your Appreciation to Others

Gratitude isn’t just something you feel—it’s something you can share. Take time each day to express appreciation to the people around you. Whether it’s a simple “thank you” to a colleague, a heartfelt note to a friend, or a loving word to a family member, expressing gratitude strengthens your relationships and spreads positivity. When you acknowledge the kindness and efforts of others, you not only uplift their spirits but also cultivate a sense of connection that enriches your own life. Gratitude is contagious, and by sharing it, you create a ripple effect of kindness and joy.

# 3. Focus on the Present Moment

In the hustle and bustle of daily life, it’s easy to overlook the small joys around us. Practicing gratitude means pausing and savoring the present moment. Whether it’s enjoying a cup of coffee, taking a walk in nature, or spending time with loved ones, bring your full attention to the experience. Notice the details, breathe in the sights and sounds, and embrace the moment with appreciation. By shifting your focus to the here and now, you can cultivate gratitude for life’s simple pleasures and experience more contentment in the present.

# 4. Reframe Negative Thoughts

Gratitude is a powerful tool for changing the way we think. When negative thoughts arise—whether it’s frustration at a challenging situation or dissatisfaction with our current circumstances—try to reframe them with a gratitude-focused mindset. For example, instead of focusing on what you lack or what’s not going right, consider what lessons or opportunities the situation might bring. Gratitude allows you to shift your perspective, turning challenges into opportunities for growth and learning. This positive outlook can help reduce stress and increase your sense of control, ultimately leading to greater happiness.

# 5. Practice Mindfulness

Mindfulness and gratitude go hand in hand. Mindfulness is the practice of being fully present in the moment, and it can enhance your ability to notice and appreciate the good things around you. Whether you’re eating a meal, talking to a friend, or just sitting quietly, being mindful helps you tune into your senses and experience life with greater awareness. By cultivating mindfulness, you naturally increase your capacity for gratitude. You begin to appreciate the richness of each moment, which in turn boosts your happiness and mental well-being.

# 6. Create a Gratitude Ritual

Incorporating gratitude into your daily routine can be a simple yet powerful way to make it a consistent practice. Consider creating a gratitude ritual that fits seamlessly into your day. This could be as simple as taking a few moments in the morning to express thanks for a new day or reflecting on the things you're grateful for before going to bed. By turning gratitude into a habit, it becomes easier to maintain a positive mindset and integrate appreciation into all areas of your life. Over time, this ritual will have a lasting impact on your happiness and overall well-being.

# 7. Volunteer or Give Back

Another meaningful way to practice gratitude is by giving back to others. Volunteering your time, skills, or resources can help you gain perspective on the things you often take for granted. Helping others in need fosters a sense of purpose and reinforces your appreciation for what you have. When you give back, you not only enrich someone else’s life but also deepen your own sense of gratitude for the blessings in your life. This act of kindness not only enhances your happiness but also strengthens the sense of community and interconnectedness.

# Conclusion

Practicing gratitude is one of the most powerful ways to enhance your happiness and improve your mental well-being. By focusing on the positive, expressing appreciation to others, and incorporating gratitude into your daily routine, you can shift your perspective and invite more joy into your life. Remember, gratitude is a practice, not a one-time event, and with regular attention, it can help you cultivate a deeper sense of contentment and fulfillment. So start today—express your thanks, embrace the present moment, and watch your life transform for the better.",1,1740883182.0,u_theonlineforyou,0,1.0,False

As someone who is a lost son of the Celts, O'Brien was easily my favorite regular cast member on DS9. He had a large number of great moments over the course of the show's 7 seasons, and even beyond the show's timeline as well. For myself, there's so many good moments that it's impossible to choose just one. One of my favorite moments was in ""Image in the Sand"" when he got drunk with Worf, trying to figure out why he was so upset—and then the next day he's at Quark's with Bashir and Quark, clearly hung over, drinking coffee. He even *looked* hung over! I love those scenes because they were so close to real life.

The next moment was outside of Deep Space Nine, but another favorite O'Brien moment for me was him and Capt. Ben Maxwell singing ""The Minstrel Boy"" together. That solemn moment as he talked down Maxwell was very powerful.

I want new plasma donors to be more informed and become safer donors. I have solid educational advice for new plasma donors who may be considering to try it out, earn extra money, and save lives:\
    • Plasma is 92% water and the rest is protein elements and electrolytes. With proper protein consumption and electrolyte drinks, your body is able to fully replenish the plasma you lost from donating within 24 to 48 hours. And that's a key reason there's a 48 hour wait in-between your two possible weekly donations.\
    • The plasma is separated from your blood and your red blood cells are returned to you in cycles.\
\
    • Per FDA regulations, you're only allowed to donate plasma twice in a 7 day period, with a 48 hour wait in-between those two times. Don't risk your health by hopping around to different plasma donation centers to circumvent these regulations, and you may get caught if you do.\
    1. Eat a meal high in protein 2-3 hours before donating, but your plasma protein levels depend on what you ate the day before.\
    2. Drink plenty of water and/or non-caffeinated juice before donating to stay hydrated. It's important to stay hydrated at least the day before, and the day of your donation.\
    3. Avoid caffeine such as in coffee or soda before donating or you may get nauseous and vomit or faint during your donation. \
    4. No alcohol 24 hours before, and for a little while after donating. \
    5. No exercising for at least 6 hours after donating as it can put too much stress on the vein. \
    6. Some people get away with smoking or vaping nicotine before and after donating, but it's recommended not to for 2 hours before and after. The nicotine can raise your heart's pulse rate. \
    7. If your pulse rate is 100 or above, you'll be able to do a vitals retake after a 15 minute wait. But if it's 100 or higher again you'll be deferred for the day. Taking sort of slower but deep breaths for 10 to 15 minutes before getting your vitals taken should help lower your pulse rate. If your pulse rate is an issue, listen to ""Pink Noise"" or ""Green Noise"" at a low volume before donating which may help reduce your pulse rate, along with its effect on lowering your blood pressure. \
    8. There is a risk of getting a blown vein if the worker is having a hard time finding your vein when they're sticking you with the needle or if you have small veins. You may get deferred until your vein heals if that happens. But it's ok, your body is able to regenerate your veins with a process called Angiogenesis. \
    9. There is a risk of blood clots, but when your blood is constantly moving through the machine it prevents that from happening. \
    10. You may be subject to drug screening. The drug screening tests for methamphetamines, cocaine, and heroin. Certain pharma prescription meds may show up as a false positive so you'll want to let the plasma center know what meds you're taking. Testing positive for these drugs can result in a permanent deferral from donating plasma. \
    11. A sample of your blood will be drawn periodically to test for certain sexually transmitted infections (STIs). A positive test will result in either a temporary or permanent deferral from donating plasma. If you've ever been diagnosed or received treatment for HIV/AIDS, Hepatitis B (HBV) or Hepatitis C (HCV) you will be permanently deferred from donating plasma.\
\
  • Wait a few hours before taking the bandage wrap off of your arm after donating.\
    • It's recommended to use Vitamin E oil/Mineral oil on the needle site for the puncture area to heal better. A Q-tip can be used to apply it easier. I simply dip the Q-Tip in the bottle, but never dip the used cotton back into the bottle.\
    • Frequently donating over a prolonged period of time may lead to your body having decreased vitamin D levels.\
    • Red meats are particularly high in the protein vitamins and minerals found in plasma. \
    • Personally, I take a Now brand Vitamin D supplement that contains vitamin D3, Calcium, Magnesium, and Zinc. But I only take a half a dose, 1 gel capsule instead of 2, since I get these from eating meats and other foods as well. It's bad for your health if you take too much of these vitamins and minerals over time. I also take an Iron supplement once or twice a week. I also try to drink a protein shake before donating. Just to be safe.\
\
Donating Plasma with Managed Diabetes\
\
Individuals with well-controlled diabetes can contribute to plasma donation, but certain criteria need to be met:\
Absence of Complications: This means no existing diabetic complications affecting your kidneys, heart, blood vessels, or eyes.\
Insulin Independence: If you rely on insulin for diabetes management, a three-month waiting period is required after using needles for non-prescribed medications. Additionally, you must be free of symptoms or treatment needs related to blood sugar fluctuations (high or low) for the past three months.\
    1. Healthy Feet: Active foot ulcers requiring medical attention will disqualify you from donation. \
    2. Steady Balance: You shouldn't experience dizziness or lightheadedness upon standing. \
    3. Type 1 Consideration: For Type 1 diabetics, eating within two hours of donation is mandatory. \

1j1ghtj,https://www.reddit.com/r/Advice/comments/1j1ghtj/my_mom_constantly_comments_on_my_eating_habits/,My mom constantly comments on my eating habits and it's making me paranoid.,"Hello Reddit. I need some advice on how to navigate this.

I never had the healthiest lifestyle. Growing up I'd constantly skip breakfast and then have chocolate or snacks at school, then coming home me and my brother weren't huge fans of fruits and veggies, so our parents would cook more meat based meals. Still, my weight was average, sometimes underweight, maybe because I'd drink tons of water and would eat quite modestly, not sure. In any case, even here my eating habits were not a concern, not for me or my family.

Fast forward a couple years I started dating a man who was a bit overweight, and being both food lovers we would eat a lot of junk stuff. At the time I graduated school, which meant no PE classes anymore. At this time I had gained some weight; not a lot for me to be considered overweight, but enough to have some belly showing, and people noticing. Both my boyfriend at the time and my mother have expressed their desire for me to lose weight, so I could recover the great body proportions I had as a teenager.

Fast forward again, I'm no longer dating this person, but my mom has upgraded her weight concerns to health concerns. I was no longer eating as much junk food as before, but I wasn't quitting it completely. At the time I was a young unemployed adult still living under my parent's roof, and my diet had become a bit more ""boring"" I would say. Things like plain meat with no side dish and dry chicken. I would ask her for something else to eat, like cereals, and she would refuse to buy it because they were too unhealthy. It was her money, so I couldn't complain, but this did sort of accumulate.

So of course when I got a job, I bought all the snacks and foods I actually wanted to eat. Chocolate cereal, chicken nuggets, candies, etc. Basically got that whim out. Despite this I didn't binge, I still have a lot of candy left from a bag I got last year, the cereal box is unopened in favor of a sugar free option, and fast-food restaurants are too expensive so I only buy there once a month at most. Still, this doesn't mean I've quit all these unhealthy foods completely.

At the same time, my mom got an Instagram account. She's been wanting to lose weight for quite some time so she follows a lot of nutrition accounts and such. And this is where our issue begins.

She wants me to quit all these foods completely. Nearly every day she comes up with a new food that I should avoid eating. First it was the obvious ones, like McDonald's and fried foods. Then it was bread, pasta, anything that uses flour. Then cereal, I don't know why but they are unhealthy according to her. Then chicken, because they inject chicken with hormones to make them bigger and thus should not be eaten. Rice, only one specific kind of it. Salt and butter are literal poison. And the most recent one, sugar causes cancer. She also sent me a video of how salmon is toxic to our bodies.

And now, the problem with it is that these comments started to get to me. I've been having health anxiety for a few years, and this is making it worse. Whenever I eat something I shouldn't, I start to worry that I'm going to die soon. Because sugar was the most recent I now have an issue with sugar. Should I put sugar on my tea or just learn to like it bitter? Should I drink chocolate milk? If it's 98ºF outside, do I buy some ice-cream or forget it because it has too much sugar, even if I eat a little bit?

Overall I don't think I'm an unhealthy person. I have incorporated more greens into my diet, I love beans, I much prefer water to any other kind of soda, I have reduced my coffee consumption to a minimum, I'm eating a lot more fruits than when I was a teen, I'm trying to eat less just to lose weight, and I'm about to start exercising. But at the same time I haven't quit all the unhealthy foods, I still eat pasta, I still get myself chocolate, ice cream, cookies, chips, hotdogs. And I'm terrified that this is not enough, and that I'll make myself sick from not quitting everything.

So the advice I'm asking for is, how can I get a healthy relationship with food, while ignoring my mom's comments about how every piece of food can kill me? Or maybe she's completely right and I should learn to control my cravings, in which case, how to do that, when certain foods are what I look for to mitigate my anxiety?",1,1740882593.0,Advice,1,1.0,False

So I’m a bearded and tattooed guy that is also a dad. I’m married, have a fantastic job, travel a lot, and living a life most would be envious of. I guess it depends on what makes you envious. I don’t brag but I’ve been told it’s desirable, but it mostly just tears me apart.

But I’m also lonely and mostly tired.

About me first. I work quite a bit. Sometimes I travel, most times I find. But my life is basically just meetings about meetings and it’s exhausting. I play some music while working. I play guitar and piano, neither one very good but I think they’re decent at least. I read a lot which makes me write a lot. I write mostly poetry and short stories. Nothing longer has lived up to my expectations. 

I’m a coffee snob that loves concerts. If you like a band I let have already seen them live. I love it. I love to cook, and I really enjoy nerdy things like making spreadsheets for everything. Both arms are covered in ink and I plan to get many more.

You? Just be cool. I don’t have stipulations other than you at least try to have convo. I want to be seen and heard and I want someone I look forward to talking to.

1j1gha3,https://i.redd.it/p1kr8y2lt6me1.jpeg,Yet another Sorce review post 💗💗💗 pt. 2,"It took me longer than I meant to finish testing the rest of my Sorce store sample haul, but I finally did it! If you're interested in the first half of the reviews you can find them [here!](https://www.reddit.com/r/Indiemakeupandmore/s/nW1LtlyAHf)

💗💗💗

**Match Made in Heaven** - *Matcha, vanilla soft serve, cherry blossom, almond, waffle cone, powdered sugar, creamy sandalwood* 

**Rating:** (3/5)

Mmmm this is pretty! Matcha powder mixed into vanilla ice cream served in a freshly made wafflecone. Yep it's what it says on the tin! Historically I have not liked matcha (neither in perfumes or beverages), but this matcha note is less bitter and grassy than others I've tried. I can smell a hint of floral cherry blossoms and a delicate almond note that doesn't overpower everything else like I find it has a tendency to do for me in other scents. It's sugary; not in a way that'll make your teeth hurt, but just enough to treat yourself with! Just like 2am in Lafayette is the best coffee scent I've tried, I'd say this is the best matcha, but as pretty as it is I think I would like to smell this in the air rather than wear it myself.

**A Witch's Valentine** - *Raspberry puree, Turkish, Moroccan, and Bulgarian rose absolutes, marshmallow, sugar, white chocolate, suede.*

**Rating:** (4/5)

This scent feels like a fuzzy pink heart-shaped pillow! Delicate and velvety roses laid over raspberry jam, topped with sugar and soft marshmallows. It's hard not to feel giddy sniffing this, it's just so unabashedly lovely! The suede adds an interesting sort of buttery texture. White chocolate is not very detectable to me until it starts to dry where the scent then becomes more creamy, finally settling down into a sweetened suede. I usually don't care much for rose (it's not a hated note, just not a love) but this one is so well done I could see myself reaching for it occasionally, whenever I'm in the mood to feel luxuriously romantic and pink! I would consider grabbing a bottle of this one if I pan the sample.

**String of Light in the Forest** - *Vanilla milkshake, Haitian vetiver, lavender maillette, beeswax absolute, golden orbs of amber, Ambroxan*

**Rating:** (3/5)

This is vanilla milkshake right up front, it's delicious and makes me want to locate the nearest ice cream shop asap! The amber and beeswax are rich and chewy, both giving the feel that the perfume is glowing from within. After a few minutes I start to notice a slight powderyness beneath the edible vanilla and a soft cozy lavender, which is more sweet than herbal. As it dries it becomes muskier and the vanilla becomes less intense, leaving the beeswax and golden amber glow, but it still remains a foodie scent for me. This is the only oil sample I have in my haul and I must note that this oil is strong - I can still smell it after a hot shower. If you like gourmand vanilla/amber scents I think you will love this, but I just know it's going to make me crave ice cream every time I wear it.

**English Major** - *Library books, orris absolute, marshmallow, decalepis hamiltonii absolute*, carrot seed, sandalwood, fallen leaves*

**Rating:** (3/5)

Initial thought - yep that's marshmallow alright! Most marshmallow notes have not worked for me, but this has the right balance of sweet to powdery for my nose. There's also the texture of paper and a gentle cool airiness, but the initial phase is mainly marshmallow and orris. Sandalwood becomes more detectable in the drydown and the carrot seed adds an interesting, violet-like element to the scent that begins to take over. It's only subtlety earthy to my nose and sweet, but not as sweet as some of the others have been. It's quite nice, but ultimately not for me. 

**Moon Magic** - *Lavender sugar, Tonka bean, chai spices, vanilla steamed milk, Cashmeran, Ambroxan, crystals charged by the moonlight.*

**Rating:** (4/5)

Sweetened lavender and warm chai mingle in the opening of this perfume. Lavender is typically not my favorite (I've been saying this a lot haven't I?) but I'm enjoying it here, it's pleasant and dreamy and not as herbaceous as it can be. The vanilla milk, more vanilla than milk to my nose, adds a creamy element that slowly warms up the longer it wears. Dairy notes can often read as sour to me, but this stays firmly sweet. Underneath the sweetness is a musky fuzziness, the texture of cashmere that grows stronger as it dries. This would be lovely as a bedtime scent; it feels like it's lulling me into a gentle sleep.

**Snow Moon Magic** - *Lavender sugar, vanilla steamed milk, chai spices, tonka bean, Cashmeran, Ambroxan, crystals charged by the moonlight (our crystal accord), marshmallow, cookie butter, and Tahitian vanilla.*

**Rating:** (3/5)

I sprayed Moon Magic and Snow Moon Magic on opposite wrists at the same time for a side by side comparison. SMM subdues the lavender of MM, drops some mini marshmallows into the warm cup of chai, and sets a plate with a pile of cookies down next to it. Then a fan is put next to those cookies to blow the delicious smell toward you, drawing you in nose first like some kind of cartoon. Cookies! Did I mention cookies? Man I want a cookie. Out of the two I prefer Moon Magic because that cookie note is gonna be too distracting for me!

💗💗💗

To summarize, there are two scents I absolutely loved and will be full-sizing (likely in both EDP and oils for layering): Sit for a Spell and The Ghost Wants Birthday Cake - cannot express how much I love those two lol. Some runner-ups were A Witch's Valentine, Moon Magic, Dreaming Evil, Serpentine, and Your Girlfriend is a Badass. Overall I did not dislike any of the samples and will keep them all in my collection as a special reminder/scent memory of a fun day. 

I'm so glad I got the chance to try all of these and see what the buzz was about. I can confidently say Sorce is worth the hype! I was pleasantly surprised to find a gourmand I could really love, and many examples of notes I usually dislike done in ways I couldn't help but enjoy. Sorce really has a magic touch!

I run a small business, and keeping track of everything in Google Sheets has become a massive time drain. I’m always setting up formulas, formatting columns, and trying to organize my inventory, sales, and expenses manually.

I started thinking—what if there was a tool where you could just type what you need in plain language, and it builds the spreadsheet for you?

For example, imagine you could just type:
➡ “Make me a spreadsheet to track my coffee bean inventory, organized by type, weight in pounds, cost per pound, total cost, and the date received.”

And instantly, the system generates a structured spreadsheet for you—without needing to set up formulas or formatting.

Smart Dashboard & AI Insights

Beyond just creating spreadsheets, I’d want this tool to include a Smart Dashboard where you can:
✅ Track the metrics that matter to you (sales, inventory, expenses, etc.)
✅ AI-powered insights—the system automatically analyzes trends and flags important data
✅ Advanced data queries—you could type:
➡ “How many total sales did I have from January through May?”
➡ “Which products are selling the fastest?”
➡ “What months do I run low on inventory?”

1j1g84w,https://www.reddit.com/r/quickbooksonline/comments/1j1g84w/reconciling_your_quickbooks_accounts_a_guide_to/,Reconciling Your Quickbooks Accounts: A Guide to Keeping Your Sanity,"**Picture this:** you, a mountain of coffee cups, and a QuickBooks Online reconciliation screen that looks like a battlefield of numbers. Sound familiar? If you're ready to trade the chaos for clarity, I've put together a guide to help you conquer the reconciliation beast. It's like a survival manual for anyone who's ever tried to reconcile their accounts while running on caffeine and sheer willpower.  
  
Let's dive in:

I. **Preparation: Brew the Extra Strength with Espresso**

1. **Gather Your Statements:**
   * Obtain your bank or credit card statement for the period you want to reconcile.
      * Some banks will automatically import transactions into QBO but most you'll have to get manually.
   * Ensure the statement is for a specific, closed period (e.g., the end of the month).
2. **Verify Your Starting/Beginning Balance:**
   * In QBO, go to the ""Transactions"" tab and select ""Reconcile""
   * Select the account you want to reconcile from the ""Account"" dropdown.
   * Compare the beginning balance on your statement to the beginning balance in QBO.
      * If they don't match, you'll need to investigate and correct the discrepancy before reconciling.
      * There may be a message that shows ""We can help you fix it."" in blue above the account selection.
      * If you click this, it will show the changes in previously reconciled transactions that are throwing off the balance.
      * There could also be an issue with the opening balance of the account that may need adjustment.
3. **Ensure All Transactions Are Entered:**
   * Before you begin, enter all transactions (deposits, payments, fees, etc.) that occurred during the statement period into QBO.
      * If you have your bank account connected in QBO, make sure all transactions have been categorized for the period you are reconciling.
      * If there are transactions in the ""For Review"" section, they will not show in the reconciliation as they have not been added to the ledger.
   * Double-check for any missing or incorrect entries.
4. **Resolve Outstanding Transactions:**
   * If you have any transactions that have been lingering for a long time, investigate and resolve them. This could involve contacting your bank or reviewing your records.
   * You may find it easier to finish the reconciliation and see which transactions have remained unreconciled from previous periods.

II. **The Mind Bender - The Reconciliation Process**

1. **Start the reconciliation while continuing to breath:**
   * In QBO, go to the ""Accounting"" or ""Transactions"" tab and select ""Reconcile.""
      * You can also click the ""Gear Icon"" then ""Reconcile"" under the Tools column.
   * Choose the account you want to reconcile from the ""Account"" drop-down menu.
   * Enter the ""Ending balance"" from your statement.
   * Enter the ""Ending date"" from your statement.
   * Enter the ""Service Charge"" and ""Interest Earned"" information from the bank statement if applicable. If you do not enter this information here, you can enter it into the register later.
   * Click ""Start reconciling.""
2. **Match what's on the statement to the transactions in the register:**
   * QBO will display a list of transactions that are in the ledger/register for the selected period.
      * Please make sure that the filters are selected correctly to include all relevant transactions.
      * Recommendation: Clear filters, then unselect all the transactions by using the top button. (There are often transactions already selected and can throw your balance off.) Then reapply filters for the period of the reconciliation.
   * Carefully compare each transaction on your statement to the transactions in QBO.
      * Recommendation: Start with the deposits to verify there is the correct amount of them in QBO since most statements show total amount of deposits. (Click the ""Deposits"" tab)
   * Check the box next to each transaction in QBO that matches a transaction on your statement.
      * Recommendation: Start at the beginning of the month and work to the end.
   * As you check off transactions, the ""Difference"" at the top of the screen will decrease.
3. **Address discrepancies and don't breakdown:**
   * Transactions on the statement but not in QBO:
      * Click ""Add"" within the reconciliation screen to enter the missing transaction.
      * If your account is connected, check the ""Bank Transactions"" tab, For Review section.
   * Transactions in QBO but not on the statement:
      * These are usually outstanding transactions. If they remain outstanding for too long, investigate them.
      * These are usually checks that have been written but not processed yet.
   * Incorrect amounts:
      * Edit the transaction in QBO to match the correct amount from your statement.
   * Duplicate transactions:
      * Investigate and delete the duplicate transaction in QBO.
4. **Finish the reconciliation and try not to cry tears of joy:**
   * Once you've matched all transactions, the ""Difference"" at the top of the screen should be $0.00.
   * Click ""Finish now.""
   * QBO will display a reconciliation report. You can choose to view, print, or save this report.

**III. Find out why your hair is being pulled out**

* Common Reconciliation Problems:
   * Incorrect starting balance: Double-check your starting balance and correct it if necessary.
   * Verify there is no error when starting the reconciliation due to deleted or edited transactions.
* Missing transactions: Ensure all transactions are entered into QBO
   * Confirm all transactions in the ""For Review"" section have been added to the register for that period.
* Incorrect transaction amounts and dates: Verify the amounts and dates of all transactions.
   * If you have a transaction that is missing, you can search it in the main search to check if it has been entered into QBO and verify it has the correct amounts and dates.

* **Best Practices:**
   * Reconcile your accounts regularly (at least monthly).
   * Keep accurate records of all transactions.
   * Investigate any discrepancies immediately.
   * Save and review your reconciliation reports.
   * Use bank feeds to automate transaction entry, but still reconcile.  
* **Using Bank Feeds:**
   * Bank feeds can automatically import transactions into QBO, saving you time.
   * However, it's still essential to reconcile regularly to ensure accuracy.
   * Review and categorize downloaded transactions carefully and on a regular basis.  
* **Reconciliation Reports:**
   * These reports provide a detailed record of your reconciliation.
   * Save and review these reports regularly for auditing purposes.  
* **Undoing a Reconciliation:**
   * It is possible to undo a reconciliation, but it is not recommended unless absolutely necessary. Be aware that undoing a reconciliation can cause a lot of issues and has to be done by an accountant user.

By following these steps, you can confidently reconcile your accounts in QBO and maintain accurate financial records. If you have questions or if anything here is unclear, please leave a comment or reach out, and I'll gladly help explain more.   
  
May your coffee be strong, your numbers add up, your reconciliations be painless and your sanity stay (mostly) intact.",1,1740881730.0,quickbooksonline,0,1.0,False

1j1g7gy,https://www.reddit.com/r/AO3/comments/1j1g7gy/fanon_vs_canon_character_perception/,Fanon vs Canon Character perception,"Have you ever joined a fandom through fanfiction and really got into it, to the point where you believe that you know and understand the character completely? Only to find out that the fanon character is completely different from canon, and now whenever you see the character in fanfics be fanon instead of canon, you’re like “that’s wrong” and I hate that Ik it’s wrong. 

For example, for me I got into Batman/DC universe by fanfiction. The way Tim Drake is characterized is that he never sleeps, loves his coffee, where it’s the only thing he’ll ingest, and has no friends/is a loner. Only to find out, that canonically he doesn’t drink coffee and has tons of friends. He’s actually quite popular and has the most friends of the batfam. I just read a fanfic where Bruce is de-aged and is slowly getting his memories back and Tim says he has some friends, namely the Teen Titans. And Bruce is like “whaaa?? My baby has friends? I’m pretty sure I could count the number of friends he used to have on one hand with fingers left over”. And I’m like “that’s not true, he canonically has so many friends and is loved by a lot of ppl.

However, they asked me to send notes they could use in their referral, which gave me pause, since I'm not sure what notes would be helpful to share and feel slightly uncomfortable about the idea of ""writing"" my own referral.

Whilst I sometimes feel anxious in large group settings - I’m usually quite outgoing / sociable and most notably…independent.

I love going to coffee shops and restaurants on my own and exploring where i am (museums/shops etc), I love joining classes and taking up new hobbies to meet people - whether in my home city or travelling abroad. 

But in NYC I feel…intimidated? Does anyone else feel like this or know what could help? What intimidates me is that it feels like everyone has something to do or somewhere to go.  I feel like I never see anyone else alone in this city, trying to figure it out - even walking around it feels like everyone is walking with someone and everyone knows exactly where to go. Maybe I’m just projecting because I feel so lonely right now - but even walking into a coffee shop or a store feels intimidating. I feel pressure to order something as soon as I step in before I even get a chance to even see a menu… everything feels overwhelming.

I’m CharmedCynic, a 30-year-old Japanese-American woman currently living in Stamford, Connecticut working as a middle school math tutor. Education and teaching light up my world, and I can’t wait to grow further down this rewarding path.

I’m 5’4” with deep brown almond-shaped eyes, medium-length dark brown hair, two pierced ears, and three tattoos. 

I enjoy life’s simple pleasures: sipping a cranberry vodka or gin and tonic while taking in the city lights, or sharing a good laugh over coffee and cake. I prefer quiet moments over loud parties and thoughtful conversations over shallow mindless chatter. I also prefer bookstores and libraries, I just love bookstores and coffee shops. 

Most importantly... Why am I here, especially on Reddit, with all the dating apps out there? Glad you asked! It’s because Reddit feels more authentic than those apps. You know the drill, right? You meet someone on a dating app, go on a date, and then realize you just don’t click. Afterward, there’s that empty feeling that lingers. Maybe they talk over you when they're drunk, dominate the conversation, or even ghost you with no explanation. The cycle also continues by deleting the app, reinstalling it and repeating the process all over again. 

Well, I’m here today to help you break that cycle. If you choose to respond to this post, you might just be putting an end to the repetitive dating app cycle—for good. What I’m looking for is an old-fashioned romance. The kind where you go on real dates—where you’re picked up at your place and the date never, ever takes place at their home. It’s about creating memories in real-life settings, not just online or in someone’s living room.

When I’m not working, you’ll find me writing, drawing, listening to synthwave, or watching nostalgic 80s/90s films. I’m a die-hard fan of the original *Gossip Girl* (2007—no reboot, please!) and would love a partner who’s down to binge it with me. My favorite films include *Dogfight*, *Cruel Intentions*, *Stand By Me*, *Career Opportunities*, *Secret Admirer*, and *The Bling Ring*. My playlists are filled with dreamy tracks like “Sunset” by The Midnight, “Summer Eyes” by Coastal, and “Miracle Love” by Lazer Club.

While I treasure my independence, I’m ready to share my life with someone who feels like my best friend. I’m looking for a connection that’s rooted in laughter, trust, and genuine care. I want us to be that couple who creates silly inside jokes, enjoys the little things, and has each other’s backs through it all. Romantic moments are my favorite—those quiet seconds when you lock eyes, smile, and know you’ve found your person.

What I’m looking for:

* **Age Range:** 28-37
* **Height:** 5’10” or taller
* **Build:** Slim/fit/lean
* **Lifestyle:** Drug-free (molly, edibles, coke, etc.) with moderate drinking okay
* **Location:** Connecticut or within 25-35 miles, US/Canada preferred
* **Relationship Goals:** Long-term, monogamous, with marriage potential. Bonus points if you’re open to starting a family someday!

A few non-negotiables: You’re emotionally available, employed, stable, single, and not in touch with exes (I think it’s important we’re both fully present). You’re someone who communicates openly and values consistency—it’s the small, thoughtful texts and actions that mean the most to me.

If you’re kind, stable, and seeking a relationship filled with joy and mutual respect, I’d love to hear from you! Please include a photo in your message, and if we vibe, I’ll happily share one back. Let’s see where this journey could take us! 💕

1j1fx5r,https://www.reddit.com/r/Christian/comments/1j1fx5r/i_am_so_sad/,I am so sad..,"Hi!
I guess I would like some advice. All is welcomed. 
Here is my story:

I am stuck here wondering if I did the right thing. I guess some people could say "" the right thing for you as a victim  is diffrent from the right thing for someone who isn't a victim"" 

I was talking to this guy who claimed to be a Christian for 3 months. Everything was going well and I opened up to him because I thought I could trust him. He seemed trustable. But after a while He was being obsessive always demanding to see me and saying that he loved me and it freaked me out so I told him to please stop with the behaviours because I was uncomfortable. He didn't listen. I had to call the police on him because he kept harrasing me and showing up and my house and work after I blocked him because he wasn't respecting my boundaries. The police talked to him and called me back reassuring me that he now understood that if he continues that he will be arrested. 
Everything stopped. I'm now in therapy and closely working on trauma recovery and it's been very hard.  I never would have thought that this would of happened to me. Weather he was a Christian or faked it to get close to me I don't know. 
In my heart I don't think what he did was very Christian like. He should of respected my boundaries and backed off the second I told him to stop. We were never even a couple, only friends. The whole situation was wild and it still gives me the chills. I just thank god that I'm safe now. 

Now fast forward to 6 months later. 
I'm still in therapy and haven't talked to any other guy since. 

I was at work (I work as a barista in a coffee shop and I'm a part time makeup artist aswell) one of my regulars Mike comes every day and gets his usual large double double with a shot of caramel and a carrot muffin. We always have friendly chats. I always got excited when he came
In. He always brightened my day. 
He asked me if he could take me out for a bite to eat after my shift. At first I declined and he looked so sad but respected my decision. After every day of seeing him that week I kept getting butterflies. So the next Monday when he came in I said "" hey Mike, is that invitation for a bite to eat still open""
He looked at me with stars in his eyes and smiled and said "" I thought you'd never ask... yes of course, how is tonight?"" I said "" I'm off at 6."" He said okay I'll be here. 
Fast forward 2 months we've been talking everyday and and feelings are growing, I talked to him about the last guy and was open about my fears and how I wanted to take this slow, he reacted with sadness and said "" wow... I'm so sorry that happened to you.."" 

I called my good friend of 15 years and told them about Mike how I was seeing him weekly and how we were slowly getting to know each other because of fears. I was excited.  She asked me who? I told him his name is Mike  Adams (this isn't his real name by the way) she paused and said... iris I hate to tell you this.. I love you but I went to college with him and he's a stalker and a manipulative person. He stalked my sisters bestfriend for years and wouldn't stop. Her father had to get involved. For the love of god please stay away from him. You can do so much better than him. I don't want to see you hurt by him... I was so shocked and puzzled after hearing this I broke down crying and my friend came over to spent the night. 
How can this happen...... two creepy stalkers in a row.... what the f......
The ptsd was flowing... 
I wished I was dreaming and I would of woken up from this hellish nightmare. 
I was so scared I blocked him. 
The next day he showed up at my work (as usual) and asked me why I blocked him that I wasn't answering his phone calls anymore and that he wanted a explaination .
I told him respectfully that someone warned me about you and now I'm scared and I have to distance myself. This isn't about anything other than keeping myself safe. And that I was sorry. He demanded to get the name of the person who told me that and the information that they said. 
I didn't want to get my friend in trouble so I said ""I'm not comfortable sharing that information."" He called me a liar and told me ""if you can't tell me who said that and what they said clearly you're lying."" I got scared and told him  ""can you please
Leave now that you got your coffee and muffin I'm uncomfortable"" 
He left. It's now been a month and I haven't seen him again. (Thank you Jesus)

As a Christian I feel bad. I know my friend of 15 years wouldn't lie to me. I trust her with my whole soul. We've been through so much together. But at the same
Time I didn't listen to his side of the story. (Does it matter?) 
Did I do the right thing. Or should of I let him tell me his side of the story? In the last 2 weeks I also had 2 other girls (friends in common with my friend of 15 years also comfirm that he's creepy and manipulative and controlling... 


I know god wants us to reconcile with people.but this is hard. I think of him still, wondering how I made him feel about this and not letting me hear his side of the story... 
this is so hard to deal with. 

My therapist said : iris, it doesn't matter what his side of the story was. What matters is you did what you felt was necessary to keep you safe and that's powerful after everything you've been through"" 


Now, can you share your opinions on this and maybe share how you would of dealt with this? 

Why do I feel like I'm in the wrong.

The person I’m seeing travels 1.5 hours one way to see me every week and I picked up some gift cards for gas that I would like to give him. Wondering if this could be taken in a negative light. 


When we first started seeing each other, the general consensus was that the person that did the driving got treated to dinner etc, so of if I went to his town, covered the date and if he came to mine, I covered the date. 

But, it quickly became clear that his home was really not suitable for hangouts. And it’s also far out of the city so it turned out that he comes to me. And if we do go out to eat or another paid activity I cover the cost. But the last few weekends, either due to weather or both of us needing to work or just stay in, we have had our meals at home. I make the meals or order in. Still I can’t help feeling that the weekly trips must be a strain on him. He has said many times, he doesn’t mind. 

He will also often have flowers or coffee delivered to me during the week. I can’t do the same for him because he lives in an area that doesn’t have doordash type service. So I feel things are a bit unbalanced and would like to offer gift cards for gas. Somewhat related, I am at a higher income level and I worry that offering this may be seen as a slight. Or like I’m making our relationship transactional and I don’t want that. 

I would also welcome other ideas to show appreciation and some level of meeting eachother half way. ",0,1740880661.0,datingoverforty,14,0.5,False

The entire day has just been shit. Spent money on crap coffee and lunch I couldn't eat. I'm starving and not in the mood to do shit but my partner wanted to go out.

Dinner hits and we order in. Expensive but usually worth the money. A spot we've had before. I have 16 different food allergies and discover new ones all the damn time. We always make sure to put in notices or comments around the allergies.

Food showed up and has allergens in it. Now I'm pissed off and my partner is afraid to eat their food around me (they do not have allergies) because I'm mad.

I'm so fucking sick of not being able to just eat normally! I want to just go to a restaurant and order food or place an order for delivery and not have to wonder if the food will kill me. I'm fucking tired of only being able to eat like 5 different foods! If I have to eat white rice and grilled chicken or lentils again I'm going to fucking lose it!!

I had to take Benadryl. I can't afford epi's so I just avoid the allergens. Now I get to be in pain and wait it out while my body tries to destroy itself because of some fucking avocado that wasn't supposed to be on my $50 order.

I fucking hate food. I hate having to eat daily. I don't want this shit anymore!!

I've talked with Dr's and allergy specialists, they can't help. I cant afford most treatments or shots even with insurance. Dr's say all I can do is avoid the foods I'm allergic to. Fuck food, I hate this shit!!",1,1740880659.0,FoodAllergies,1,1.0,False

After the first chores fight, my husband (31M), and I (33F) decided that we would have “zones” so to speak to clean. He is responsible for our room, bathroom and laundry. I’m responsible for the kitchen, I’m also the only one who cooks.
Kids have living room and other things. We agreed to alternate floors since we have dogs and the kitchen is a high traffic area and our bedroom is not. 

The other night after my daughter put away the dishes I was loading them when I asked for husband to help by putting the food away and wiping the counters. So the fight ensues. He did it but I’m not happy with our current arrangement anymore. 

He doesn’t do his part well. I’ve had to do laundry because he doesn’t do it in time for me to have clean work clothes. The bathroom got so disgusting I had to ask him for a week to do it. Toilet and tub never get done. He doesn’t vacuum the bedroom floor. He basically only does laundry and poorly at that. My matching socks are never there, I have his socks and he has mine. He hangs up things in the wrong spot after being told where/how to do it. He just wants to make everything the easiest so he doesn’t care if I have to rearrange everything. 

Me on the other hand, I’m constantly doing dishes ! Even if I cook I have to do them. If he cooks I do them. He doesn’t clean up after himself at all. If the dishwasher is empty and he has a coffee mug, he’ll put it in the sink for me to take care of. I’m getting tired because the kitchen is a lot more work than our room and he refuses to help. We have his son every other week and the mess doubles because he doesn’t clean up after him either. He just sees it as “my job.” 

His side is that I leave the bedroom a mess but I disagree because the laundry on the floor comes from him not folding it or putting it away. I put everything in the hamper. Also putting something in the hamper is a lot easier than scrubbing dishes. He says my daughter is 70% of the mess and she should do everything without being told to do so. She’s 11 and listens well and has chores of her own. He expects her to be clean and perfect 100% of the time. I say that’s unreasonable because she’s a child who needs to be parented. We don’t have a chore schedule for her, I just ask her to do something and she does it. Either way the kitchen wouldn’t be her job anyway right ? But she helps with it anyway when asked. He doesn’t think she should be asked ever. 


We’ve come to a standstill and I’m looking for an outside perspective. I think he’s being lazy and needs to step up. He won’t help because he doesn’t think he makes enough of a mess to warrant helping I guess.

TLDR: husband does his chores poorly and I do mine constantly. I ask for help and he says no. What’s reasonable to ask for ?",1,1740880431.0,AITA_Relationships,1,1.0,False

“Ah, so you have a memory of running?”

“That’s quite intriguing.. After being put on that anesthetic, most people wake up without memory of the last few hours or so.. You must have been pretty eager to get away.”

“Now, before you start screaming and crying, tell me, what’s your association with Icarus?”

“If you’re not going to give answers to the person who has you tied down to a chair, you’re either incredibly brave or incredibly stupid.”

“Alright, then. If you aren’t going to tell me your relationship to him, I’m just going to assume that you’re his lover. How about that?”

“Oh-ho-ho, that got you talking.”

“The coffee shop? So you’re his co-worker?”

“In what world would a guy like Icarus be striking up conversation with random regulars at his place of work? Are we talking about the same person?”

“Enough chatter. Tell me the truth, are you a lover, a friend, co-worker, family member, what the hell are you to him? Because, I find it laughable to even consider the idea that you’re just some nobody he met a few days ago.”

“M..hm… Fine. I’ll suspend my disbelief.”

“What does he usually talk about?”

“What has he told you about *us*? His old friends.”

“How disappointing, not that I expected better from him. He has guts to be talking about how awful *we* are, it’s not like he hasn’t partook in his share of.. morally questionable deeds.”

“Oh, nothing. I’d *hate* to be the one to ruin your image of perfect Icarus.”

“It's a shame we couldn't catch him. He was right there, almost in our grasp. It doesn't surprise me, though. His speed was always his best quality.”

“It really is disheartening to hear that you only know him by chance.. I was hoping you’d be his partner, or a sibling, long-time friend, *anything* other than some random that he met at work. But, I suppose it’ll do.”

“Let’s just say that we’re trying to lure him back to this area, and *you* are the bait.”

“I know you’re not *too* close with him, but, from the impression that you’ve made of him over the past few days, can you safely say whether or not he’d save you if he thought you were in danger?”

“Something that’s always amused me about humans is their confidence. But, hey, if you’re so sure, who am I to say he won’t? After all, it’s in my best interest if he does turn up.”

“Well, here’s what we’ll do. I’m going to get someone to send a message to Icarus, telling him you’re here. If he doesn’t show up to save you by sundown..”

“You’ll find out.”

*Creak.*

“I wish we had some better scenery, rather than this dingy old place.. I can’t stand the creaking.”

“No clue. What matters is that it’s clearly long-abandoned, it’s impressive it's still standing.”

“I suppose the local government is more focused on putting tax dollars towards vampiric control than demolishing useless buildings.”

“Well- I guess it’s not *useless*, look at us now.”

“Isn’t that ironic? Putting off demolishing an obsolete warehouse in order to focus on getting rid of the vampires, only for vampires to use that building for illegal activities.”

“No- not those kinds of illegal activities! But holding hostages is hella illegal.”

“I really hope you knew that.”

“Of course you want to know why I care so much about getting Icarus here... You understand that you’re not exactly in a position to be asking questions, right?”

“You know what? I’ll entertain your question, I’m bored. It’s simple, really. He couldn’t stomach the fact that vampirism means hurting humans, so, like the coward he is, he ditched us. Once someone comes in, they can’t be let out. It’s just how things work.”

“One question is the limit. My voice is already tired.”

(Augustus brings his voice down as he gets closer to the listener.)

“My eyes, on the other hand, are perfectly awake.”

“You look so nice, tied up, helpless, and your neck is *oh-so enticing…”*

“While we wait for the main attraction, what do you say I have a little taste? Icarus wouldn’t have to know…”

“Don’t struggle, just listen to my words. Allow yourself to relax, just look at me, and you’ll barely feel a thing…”

“You’re a tricky one, aren’t you? No need to fight it- *just-”*

*(The speaker’s voice is cut off by the sound of an arrow. He falls to his knees as he crumples down on the floor, dead.) (womp womp)*

*(Icarus shouts, out of breath.)*

“How’s that for a grand entrance, Augustus?”

“Is he dead?”

“Good enough.”

*His voice gets closer.*

“I’m assuming you’re tied down?”

“Thought so. You know, countless people have been in that very same chair, but someone getting out of it alive? Probably a first.”

“Yep, same chair every time. Cheap.”

“Hold on, before I untie you, let me just make sure he’s..”

“No pulse. Well- wait, vampire. Of course he has no pulse. Let me-”

*Icarus slaps Augustus’ face.*

“Yeah, he’s gone.”

“Alright, let’s get you out of that chair.”

(Icarus unties the listener as he speaks.)

“He didn’t hurt you, did he?”

“I suppose it could’ve been worse. *Much* worse.”

“Let’s get out of here, I don’t want to take any risks. We can call the police and tell them about the dead vampires once we’re secure, alright?”

“Well, yeah. Dead vampires, plural. The ones I couldn’t sneak past have already been, uh, neutralized. But those were only the ones I ran into. And considering the fact that I yelled from the balcony after shooting Augustus for dramatic effect, if anyone heard me, they’re surely on their way.”

“Exactly- so come on, let’s fuck off out of here!”

*(Icarus speaks his next lines as they leave the premises.)*

“And- you *promise* you’re okay?”

“Whatever you say, but- one thing’s for sure. I owe you multiple coffees, and at this point, probably some sessions with a trained therapist.”

1j1fhr6,https://www.reddit.com/r/shortscarystories/comments/1j1fhr6/the_last_humans_on_menandros/,The Last Humans on Menandros,"The cave wall glistened with pulsing green goo. The color reflected, dulled and distorted, in Bernard Gluzman’s eyes.

“Coffee,” he said, angling the keypad on his forearm toward his assistant. Natalie punched in a code, and a tube extended into his expectant mouth, delivering a perfectly brewed portion of Nott’s Dark Roast.

Satisfied, he strode further into the cave, and Natalie hurried after him. Dr. Brunner trailed meekly behind.

While they had needed the scientist’s guidance to find the cave system, now that they were inside, the green goo led the way. It coated the walls, running thickly along ribs of rock. Where it dripped on their suits, sensors flashed red, indicating high heat. Intermittently, their helmets fogged up, as if hot breath were blowing on them.

As if they descended down the throat of a monster.

*Thud.*

Natalie turned around. Brunner, a foot taller than her, had hit his head on an overhang of rock.

“You have to see this,” Bernard said from around the corner. Natalie ran after him, then stopped in her tracks.

They had reached the end of the cave. From the back wall, green goo gushed in a vibrant torrent, filling a pool lined with round stones.

“This is wonderful!” Bernard said. “Enough gluzoline for decades.”

*Gluzoline.* Bernard Gluzman’s name for the mysterious green gloop found on planet Menandros, which generated an unfathomable amount of power. This amount could indeed power Earth for decades, as well as make Bernard the richest man to ever live.

Natalie was thinking about something else entirely.

“Mr. Gluzman,” she said, “who put those stones around the pool?”

“A natural formation,” he said dismissively. “Ugh, why is my face so itchy?” He patted his helmet with glove-encased hands.

“So itchy,” he repeated. His hand moved to his keypad.

Natalie realized what he was doing a second too late.

“Stop!” she shouted, just as his keypad beeped and his helmet visor slid back. He raked his fingers along his face, moaning with satisfaction.

“Mr. Gluzman,” Natalie said, “you need to–”

*Crunch.*

She whirled around to find that Brunner had broken his keypad against a rock.

“Don’t let them make you open your helmet,” he whispered. Then he groaned, clawing at his visor. He smashed his head into the wall, harder and harder.

Bernard screamed. His face was sloughing off, revealing muscle and bone slicked with blood.

*Crack.* Brunner dug his fingers into the hole he had made in his helmet.

Bernard’s eyeballs swelled to twice their size, and popped.

Brunner laughed as he scratched his face, dragging the skin off in strips.

Natalie, frozen in horror, noticed something rising from the pool behind Bernard. A mass of writhing tentacles slopped goo onto the floor as it dragged itself out.

By the time it had fully emerged, both men lay dead beside Natalie.

Words rang in her mind.

*I’m sorry to do this. But last time we let the tall one go, and he brought more of you.*

Being a plant parent is a rewarding journey, but it comes with its own set of challenges. Here are 10 life hacks that every plant mom or dad can use to enhance their green thumb lifestyle.

### 1. Use App Notifications

Download plant care apps that send reminders for watering, fertilizing, and repotting. This ensures you never forget your plant's needs.

### 2. DIY Self-Watering Pots

Create self-watering pots using a simple water reservoir system. This will help your plants stay hydrated and reduce watering frequency.

### 3. Invest in Quality Soil

Opt for high-quality potting soil that contains organic materials. A well-balanced mix can improve drainage and promote healthy root growth.

### 4. Group Plants Together

Cluster your plants to create a microclimate that retains humidity. This is especially beneficial for tropical plants that thrive in moist conditions.

### 5. Utilize Natural Fertilizers

Use kitchen scraps like coffee grounds and banana peels as natural fertilizers. They enrich the soil and promote healthy growth without chemical additives.

### 6. Rotate Your Plants

Regularly rotate your plants to ensure even light exposure. This prevents them from leaning toward the light source and promotes balanced growth.

### 7. Create a Plant Schedule

Establish a care routine based on your plants’ needs and create a schedule. This will streamline your tasks and keep your plant care organized.

### 8. Use Pebbles for Drainage

Add a layer of pebbles at the bottom of pots to improve drainage. This prevents root rot and increases airflow to the roots.

### 9. Monitor Indoor Humidity

Keep an eye on indoor humidity levels with a hygrometer. Adjust your environment with a humidifier or by placing trays of water near your plants.

### 10. Share Your Passion

Join a local plant club or online community. Sharing your experiences and learning from others can enhance your plant care knowledge.

These hacks are designed to make plant parenting easier and more enjoyable, ensuring your leafy friends thrive in a loving environment.

It was a horribly beautiful spring day, the hills alive with vibrant colors and sweet scents.

I shoved his urn into the closet, drank too much peanut butter whiskey, and cried myself to sleep.

I woke to darkness and familiar footsteps. Jeremy worked a late shift at the hospital, so I was used to him sneaking into bed in the dead of night. The mattress sagged behind me, and an arm wrapped around my waist. I smiled and closed my eyes.

A moment later, my eyes flew open.

Jeremy was dead.

I jumped out of bed, a scream rising in my throat. I tried to turn the light on, my finger jamming painfully into the wall. On a second attempt, I managed to click the switch.

The bed was empty.

The next night, I lay awake, my heart hammering in my chest, as my husband snored behind me. When the first bit of sunlight slipped through the blinds, his presence disappeared.

I discovered that as long as I didn't look directly at him, Jeremy came to bed at 1:23am every night and left at sunrise. I began talking to him, gossiping about my coworkers and showing pictures of the neighbor's new cat. He never replied, but I sometimes felt his head on my shoulder.

I was sure I was losing my mind.

But I was at peace.

Then the cute guy at the coffee shop asked me out. I hesitated, but it had been a year. After a few hours at a hipster bar, I stumbled home drunk at 2am.

As soon as I opened the front door, I felt Jeremy’s presence in the living room. It was heavy. Angry.

“Yerz dead,” I slurred, tripping over my feet as I tried to unstrap my heels. The feeling of anger intensified, and I could imagine him thinning his lips and shaking his head, as he did when alive.

“Yer in my head!” I shouted. “Leave me alone!”

“Who are you talking to?”

I spun around, grabbing at the door to steady myself. My date stood on the porch, his head tilted and eyes gleaming.

He had dropped me off half a block away. Had he followed me?

“Stay–there–,” I mumbled, backing away.

He stepped across the threshold into the house. I tried to run, but he forced me onto the floor, pinning me under him. A hungry smile split his face.

Suddenly there was a shattering sound. My would-be attacker fell sideways off me, blood pouring from his head.

I stood shakily. What remained of Jeremy’s urn was scattered around us, in sharp shards and piles of reddening ash.

His presence was gone.

My eyes filled with tears. “Don’t leave me,” I begged.

But he wasn’t there.

I sank to the floor, my body shaking with sobs.

Then, faintly, cold arms encircled me, and phantom lips brushed the nape of my neck.",1,1740878857.0,u_TinkaDreamsofWings,1,1.0,False

All of them except me are muslims and I live a fairly ""Western"" life compared to them. I drink, smoke, go to parties and casually date. They are generally your typical muslim girls and we never judged each other for the way we live and respected each others boundaries without hesitation, helped each other through a lot and formed a sisterhood.

We decided to meet up today but Blue couldn't make it so she is irrelevant to the story. Orange, whom i am closest to, and I meet up earlier in the day and Green came later to break fast with us (it was her plan to come late by the way). I didn't eat/drink anything to show respect even though I wasn't fasting. 


Later on, we decided to grab some coffee and desert and Orange got a chocolate éclair. We sit down and they are talking about the size of the éclair, Green told Orange that ""Pink would know the sizes as she is the most experienced"". ( I HATE to explain this but I had a total of 3 sexual partners in my life, one being a serious relationship, so no I don't ""sleep around"" as implied and it would still be fine if I did, I don't see anything wrong with people having consensual sex as much as they want.) they lauged but I brused that off and said I didn't know the exact size. The conversation evolves into the flavors of éclairs and Green, this time way more sarcastically, says ""Pink can tell us what they ALL tatse like, she would know"" (obviously with sexual implications). This time they laugh WAY harder. I felt so bad (even cried a bit) told her this is not okay to joke about and I'm uncomfortable. Orange immediately came to her defense by saying ""it's just a joke between friends"" which suprised me as she is not much of a confrontational personin general. I told her I still don't find this to be appropriate.

This is not our usual humor, of course we joke around and talk about sex, but when in a *different* situation where I called Green ""selfish"" they all scolded me in the group chat, or when I told her(Green) that she dictated my birthday when we canceled our plans because she said she couldn't come, I still apologized for using the word ""dictating"". They can be sensitive and I get that but I see this as a double standart at this point. Why do I have to apologize for every little thing but they get a free pass joking about who I share my bed with?..

Orange did apologize multiple times and seemed genuinely very remorseful. We talked it through but honestly I'm not sure if I can just brush this off as a joke and move on. But I mean.. would it be wise to lose my best friends for a joke they apologized for? I'm sure she didn't mean it in a bad way.

I'm not sure If I can share my intimate secrets with them anymore. If it was anyone else, I'm pretty sure Orange would tell me to cut that person off and she had some sexual experiences as well but Green is more radical as she wears a hijab also.

So my question is, is it really just a joke that can be forgiven?

# THE DEANNA MCONIE SITUATION™

Nobody really knows how it happened, but rumors started flying after Long Caster allegedly picked up Deanna McOnie in the dumbest way possible.

According to *some* sources (*Count, who insists he was there*), the pickup line was:

*""Hey, you look like you know where the good coffee is. Wanna prove it?""*

Jaeger, who is still in disbelief about the whole thing, swears the conversation went something like:

Deanna: *""Are you serious?""*  
Long Caster: *""I’m always serious. Except when I’m not.""*  
Deanna: *(silence, then laughter)* *""Alright, I’ll bite.""*

The next thing anyone knew, they were leaving together, and now no one knows if they’re actually dating or if Long Caster somehow finessed his way into a casual coffee arrangement that may or may not involve romance.

Blaze, ever the composed one, has *refused* to weigh in on the situation.

Cossette finds it ridiculously funny.

Alex is just impressed at the audacity.

Count is mad because he still doesn’t understand how that actually worked

# CATCHPHRASES

* *""Look alive, Strider. Or don’t. I’m not your dad.""*
* *""You could fly smarter… but you won’t.""* *(Directed at Trigger, usually.)*
* *""So, anyone wanna explain why my radar just lit up like a damn Christmas tree?""*
* *""No pressure, but if you screw this up, we all die.""*
* *""Ah, our big friend is back.""* *(Still calls the Arsenal Bird this.)*

1j1f00q,https://www.reddit.com/r/legaladvice/comments/1j1f00q/us_california_apartment_neighbor_monitors_my/,US (California) apartment neighbor monitors my every move,"TL:DR - I am new to the US and since moving into an apartment, my front door has an issue with the mechanism, which has caused a neighbor dispute. I tried to resolve it peacefully and it ended up with her inviting me out then rejecting me - since the rejection, I am being targeted by this neighbor and she even comes out of her apartment to film me, and is now filming my every arrival/exit with a security camera. I am now under a ""lease violation"" notice with the apartment management and today the police showed up at my door over a ""noise complaint"". What do I do to protect myself?

\----

So I moved into a large apartment complex in December. Since I moved in, my front door (fire door) seemed to make a thunking noise with the closing mechanism. I thought it might just be how all the doors are in this place. After a few weeks, a notice goes out to residents about ""door slamming noises"" in ""your area of the building"". I thought it was odd as I hadn't heard anything. A few weeks later I get a call from management asking me if I had heard anything with noises in my area of the building - I said no, I hadn't, it all seemed OK.

A few more weeks go by and then one day as I am walking to my car, my neighbor runs up to me saying ""IT'S YOU! YOU'RE THE ONE!""

I was like ""excuse me, what?"" - then she said ""You're the one slamming the door!"". I was actually kind of shocked and I apologized, I told her that I didn't realize it was so loud and that I would do my best to make sure it doesn't make any kind of noise when I leave. This seemed to calm her down and we even exchanged numbers and she invited me out for coffee later that day, as she knew I was new to the US.

I messaged her a bit later and we went out for coffee and got chatting about various things - she even asked if I went to the gym on-site and whether I wanted to go with her as she said she was ""scared"". I showed her some photos from tips I'd taken and she said she liked them, and even asked if I could ""take some photos of her"" to remember her time here. It did seem a little strange, but I just thought she was being friendly.

After our coffee, I sent her some links as we had been talking about different places to visit and exchanging info about the area and the broader city. She didn't reply for a few days, but eventually said thanks for it all.

Later on in the week I just sent a hello message and asking if the door was better now, as I was being suuuuuuper careful opening and closing it. She thanked me again and said thanks for being a good neighbor.

A bit later in the week we had a huge rain event and when I came home my apartment was flooded - I messaged my neighbor (same floor obviously) and said my place had flooded and asked how hers was. No reply, until a few days later.

She messages and says she needs to have a ""conversation"" with me... so I said sure, whenever suits... then she said she was down at the local cafe right now and is free. So I go down there and she said that she thinks she's given me the wrong impression and that she's not interested in me - I was again kind of shocked, I said no, I'm sorry, I wasn't thinking that - explained that I had just messaged her about very basic things and didn't see things like that at all.

From that moment, I did not send any more messages nor have initiated any kind of contact - though we did bump into each other in the hallway twice during the week on my way to/from work. I just said hi but that was it - she wanted to say something but I said I had a meeting/was late to work (both true).

So last night (2 weeks after her chasing me down in the carpark) - I get a call from the apartment management saying that they have ""confirmation"" that it is me causing door slamming in the apartment area and that I am now under a lease violation. They asked if I am going to ""continue this behavior""... I explained everything to the person and said that I will put in a maintenance request to have the door looked at, and that I have made every effort to be as quiet as possible. The person's attitude changed after I was very polite and she offered to send me a direct e-mail so that I could contact her about any issues directly.

After that call, I went to check my door and see when it does actually make the noise. It's not 100% of the time, but I managed to figure out when it does it. As I was doing that, the neighbor started filming me from her door and then placed a security camera outside. I told her that I think something is wrong with the door and that I've put a maintenance request in, I told her that I've been very careful to open/close it, and I even offered for her to try the door herself to see that it's not just me making things up. She refused to come out and refused to try, so I didn't bother saying anything else.

This afternoon - on the advice of some friends - I went to apartment management and explained the whole story, timeline, the messaging back-forth, I even showed video of me leaving the apartment and how I close the door, and I asked the apartment management staff to come with me to see. Thankfully they did - and she saw first-hand the noise and when it happens. I also mentioned the video camera, and the apartment staff said that that is not allowed (!!!).

PHEW. I thought - case closed everything will be fine. No!

About 2hrs later - the police show up at my door!!! I again explained everything to them and they asked for my name. I said I can go and get my ID, they let me do that and as the door closed it made the noise (!!!) - when I came back, I said ""I'm not sure if you heard that..."" and the policeman interrupted me and said he did, and that he was talking to his colleague about it (2 police were there). From that moment his attitude changed and he seemed much more chill. He took down my ID details and basically said have a nice day.

SO... now I am VERY concerned about what is going to happen next - this neighbor does not seem in a good state of mind, I do not want any trouble with law enforcement or apartment management or ANYTHING, I just want to live my life peacefully.

Do I need to place a restraining order? Can I get a stalking charge over the video camera + audio recording? Please someone who is familiar with this country/state, I need some advice.

1j1ezp2,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1j1ezp2,2007 Hungarian Menu H7 - Almost a total loss.....,"Hi folks,

I had high hopes for this one, but they were crushed as soon as my son and I opened it.

As you can see, we needed gloves for this one. 

This ration was basically a total loss. It was a sealed ration and the seller is not at fault here, they had no idea and still have one in thier own collection. They, and I, are hoping is not in as bad of shape as mine was. They also issued a partial refund for the order, which I appreciate very much.

As you can see from pics, items were beat up pretty bad and leakage occurred which rusted the cans (pics 4-6) and caused everything in the accessory pack (pic 2) to get soaked in a foul smelling liquid, not even sure what it was to be honest.

Those cracker packs are supposed to be 100% silver and, as you can see, one of the packs basically has no silver left (pic 3 and 7).

I did salvage both coffees and the black currant beverage base (pics 15 and 16), that actually makes 1.5 liters of beverage, which is quite a lot! I made it and it was actually just fine I think but I did not care for the taste at all. The coffees were just fine!

I took one bite of a cracker from the pack in pic 7, it was stale, rancid, soft, and very bland with no salt.

That gum in pic 12 was wicked looking!

Pic 17 shows one of the pates,  the only one of the meat items I opened because it wasn't loose and shaking around in the tin.  To be fair, it smelled ok, but I could not bring myself to try it given the state of the other items. 

A great experience for my son and I regardless of the condition of the ration and, since I did eat a bite of cracker and drink the coffees, I am counting this country off my list bringing my total to 16 different countries now! 

Stay tuned next month for country 17 as I'm only doing one new country a month from now on.

Remember to always use all your senses when it comes to rations, especially older ones!

Take care folks!

Tencent’s new Hunyuan Turbo S just might be that kind of speed demon in the world of AI, boasting one-second response times that leave some competitors scrambling to catch up. But wait—before we crown it the Usain Bolt of AI tools, let's dig into the benchmarks. 

Hunyuan Turbo S is flexing its muscles, especially in Chinese language processing, outperforming many rivals in key tests. It’s leaving others like Claude 3.5 and GPT-4o in the digital dust on many fronts. But DeepSeek-R1-Zero still lurks in the shadows, leading in other areas like math and knowledge, reminding us that there's always another level in this game of technological leapfrog.

The real question isn't just how fast and strong these AI platforms are, but how this speed and efficiency translate into real-world benefits—and potential disruptions. With Tencent throwing its hat in the ring so aggressively, we could be on the brink of an AI revolution that reshapes how businesses operate and innovate.

So here's the million-dollar question for you armchair tech strategists and entrepreneurs out there: If AI could do anything in one second, what industry do you think it would turn upside down first? Let the debate begin! 👇",1,1740877312.0,AiKilledMyStartUp,0,1.0,False

So far, Google Maps has burned through 75mb - and I haven't even left the house. I keep checking and the fucking thing keep bumping itself up. I've zoomed in and out a few times, at 1-3mb per zoom, been up and down the highway just to see, at 3-5mb per scroll, checked out 2-3 nearby towns at a glance again to see what that would do to data - up to 6mb for a zoom out, scroll, and zoom into a town or city. I did check out reviews for an old coffee shop I worked at - this must have been 25mb right there. 

What utter garbage. Videos are turned off, timeline has been turned off, and now I've even deselected automatic sattelite view even though its the only way I like to look around. Data saver on, background data usage on maps in the kilobytes. Samsung Galaxy S24 Ultra. I have noticed this phone just loves to gorge itself on data like its free. Sorry, a jpg is still a jpg, even if we're flirting with 6G now and speed change is minute.

Any suggestions? Going to the gas station and buying an analog map of the area I live? Chucking my phone down the toilet? Calling google and telling them to sniff their own farts? Writing this, google maps data usage has gone up incrimentally, even with the app closed. Anyone??",1,1740877215.0,GoogleMaps,1,1.0,False

I’ve always struggled to find someone I connect with, and I think I might also be demisexual.

I live in a very red/conservative area, so meeting other women has been tough. Recently, I joined an LGBTQ+ book club in a different city hoping to meet other queer people. At the first meeting, I met another woman (30F), and we were the only two lesbians there, so we started talking. We exchanged numbers, but didn’t start texting until after the second meeting, and after the third, I finally asked if she wanted to grab coffee.

Now here’s where I messed up, I thought it was a date, but during our coffee, she mentioned her girlfriend of 5 years. I was pretty sad because I’ve had such a difficult time meeting other lesbians, let alone someone I felt a real connection with.

So should I stop contacting her, or is it okay to continue being friends if I’ve started developing feelings? I’m just unsure if it’s okay to keep talking to her or it might hurt down the line, I also don't want to make it weird for her or her girlfriend. 

Anyone have advice or a similar experience? ",3,1740877031.0,ActualLesbiansOver25,2,1.0,False
