Hope all is well! The life of being single near the holidays always has me swiping on the apps or lurking on reddit üòÇ So here's another post where, I usually end up rambling about myself (red and green flags and all) So cheers to everyone here and let me talk to your ear off.

Before I charm you with my wit (from the large amount of editing that I can do behind the screen) - physically I'm 5'8"", Chinese, average weight ~165lbs.

Not doing much for New years so always down to find someone to chat with or game the night away with! Anyone got any fun New Years resolutions? Besides the classic, get healthy, meal prep, do new things, read more.. I'm gonna try my best to get my parents off my back about being single for too long. So hello out there single ladies, I'm here ready to be cuffed üôã

Looking out for that best friend with - someone to cook with, laze around with, or try new things! like shopping for clothes or random gadgets, axe throwing, puzzle rooms, museums, all that jazz. Though, I'm definitely a introvert, who needs some time to let the social battery recharge. Help drag me out to new places! I need someone to go watch Hadestown on Broadway with!

Besides that, I've definitely fallen off the bandwagon on my most recent health kick, but have been getting back into it - goal is lose weight, gain muscles! Maybe lose the dad bod eventually (though I know some people love it) .. but if you do have some healthy meal prep you like to make ( high protein low calorie) hit me up! I've been a big fan of chili so far.

Hobbies wise, there's a 95% chance that I'm probably watching TV, reading, playing video games, or cooking ü§ì.

5% chance that someone's dragged me out of my cave to go rock climbing or outside to touch grass.

I definitely gravitate more to the gamer side, but I call myself a super nerd. Cause I play, read / watch:

video games (TFT, WoW, and soo much more)
anime, manga / manhua
Korean dramas, reality TV, anything about cooking, survival shows
books (Wind and Truth anyone?)
DnD
and that's just the tip of the iceberg (maybe)
You might be able to tell I'm a little bit of a homebody. Discord and media has definitely made it so comfy to stay at home... but, with enough convincing, I've been known to venture out into the unknown.

Here's a picture of me at a Spartan Race (that I definitely did not sign up 4 days before the race) https://imgur.com/a/SIIYGiN

There is a lot of meme potential in some of the photos of me from the race that I will hold out from you for now... So hit me up if you wanna see some üòÇ. I might bargain with you for a selfie of yours though

Anyways, that's a little bit (or a lot) about me. If I've piqued any interest, feel free to send me a message! I'm mainly looking for someone in the area, but let's just chat and see what happens! Hopefully our conversations won't dry out and we'll hit it off and be one of those success stories ‚ò∫Ô∏è. But let's keep that a secret (we definitely met on Hinge). Also if you're not single, please help me with my flirting skills, those are definitely non-existent lmao

One thing I‚Äôm really going to miss living in Galway city centre is all the great coffee shops. Specifically the coffee places that focus  on high quality roasts typically sourced from individual farms and roasted to bring out their distinctive flavors.

I‚Äôm by no means a coffee snob-I just appreciate a nice latte/flat white. I find that the coffee you get from older cafes/chains just isn‚Äôt as good-and definitely not worth ‚Ç¨5 IMHO.

So outside of Galway, do you recommend any good coffee shops in Connacht in general? Or can you recommend any in or around Castlebar/Westport?

1hpm06z,https://www.reddit.com/r/u_Camus_wept/comments/1hpm06z/sleepless/,Sleepless,"I'm not sure why, but I just couldn't fall asleep tonight. My brain refused to shut off. The ADHD, maybe, or the lack of bedtime routine while on break from work. Maybe I took my stimulants too late in the day today. I guess it doesn't really matter why, what matters is that I couldn't sleep no matter what I tried. 

So now it's five a.m, and I'm cleaning the bathroom. Just letting the comet powder sit for a minute before I wipe out the sink, then I'll clean the mirror. I'll wait until it's a normal time to be awake before I do the tub, so I don't wake the neighbors by running the shower. 

I wanted to go out to a ski hill tomorrow. Or today, rather. I don't think that will happen, I expect I'll be mostly down for the count, even if I do manage to get any sleep. 

I'd hoped making myself get out of bed and do something would help me feel tired. No such luck, all I've gotten out of it so far is a headache from the bleach smell, and a marginally cleaner bathroom. But it is sort of nice, to use this time productively instead of uselessly tossing and turning in bed. 

It's also reminding me of cleaning your bathroom. How I'd done it as an expression of care and love, doing something for you, to take it off your plate, while you made a meal for us. How it was so much easier to do that while I was caring for someone else, instead of doing it for myself. I'm trying to move away from that, a little, and towards treating myself as someone I care about, too. 

I still have a ways to go, my depression nest can still be described as such, but I'm unraveling it bit by bit. The real trick will be keeping it from happening again once my apartment is presentable. That's always the hard part, being consistent. 

It's time to go wipe out the sink. Then I'll see about getting some sleep. Or some coffee. Depends on how the next hour goes.

I‚Äôve been thinking about this while dodging another swarm of Glyphids and wondering why the hell I‚Äôm still risking my beard for Morkite. What if Mission Control is actually an **Orc**? And what if this entire corporate operation, Deep Rock Galactic, is secretly being run by a bunch of shady **Elves**?

Sounds crazy, I know, but stick with me.

# Mission Control = Orc Energy

First off, let‚Äôs talk about Mission Control. This guy‚Äôs whole vibe is *so Orc*. Gruff, no-nonsense, always barking orders like you‚Äôre a slacker just because you took five extra seconds to pet the Loot Bug. He‚Äôs got that ‚Äúmiddle manager with anger issues‚Äù energy, but it goes deeper. Look at him‚Äîhe even **looks like an Orc** with that lighting, the bulky build, and the permanent scowl.

Orcs were born to manage stuff like this. They don‚Äôt care about your feelings; they care about efficiency. They‚Äôre the perfect enforcers for a big, shady corporation like DRG. Who better to keep us dwarves in line than someone who‚Äôs just one coffee spill away from flipping a desk?

# The Elves Are Behind It All

Now, let‚Äôs get to the real villains: the **Elves**. Think about it. Who else would have the brains and arrogance to set up a galaxy-spanning mining operation and exploit the hardest-working, beer-loving species in the universe?

1. **Elves Love Exploitation**: The Elves probably sat in their boardrooms (which are definitely made of polished white stone with leafy vines everywhere) and thought, ‚ÄúHmm, how do we make money without getting our hands dirty? I know‚Äîhire the dwarves to do the digging and the Orcs to keep them in line.‚Äù
2. **Environmental Hypocrisy**: You know how Elves are always preaching about preserving nature and harmony? Yeah, that‚Äôs because they don‚Äôt want *their* hands dirty. Meanwhile, they send us down to Hoxxes IV to strip-mine the place and annihilate the local ecosystem.
3. **The Real Profit**: All that gold, Morkite, and whatever else we‚Äôre hauling back? Do you think we‚Äôre getting the real cut of that? Hell no. The Elves are selling it to some shady galactic buyers and rolling in space cash while we get‚Ä¶ free beer.

# The ‚ÄúBeer and Brotherhood‚Äù Distraction

Speaking of beer‚Äîdoesn‚Äôt it all feel a little‚Ä¶ too convenient? The Space Rig has a fully stocked bar, endless pints, and a vibe that keeps us chanting ‚ÄúRock and Stone!‚Äù instead of asking why we‚Äôre getting sent into certain death for barely any recognition.

It‚Äôs genius. Keep the workforce drunk, bonded, and proud of their work, and they won‚Äôt start thinking about how **Karl probably died because DRG refused to send a rescue pod until he hit the quota**.

# Hoxxes IV: The Biggest Scam

Now let‚Äôs talk about Hoxxes IV. That place is a nightmare. You‚Äôre telling me it‚Äôs totally natural for a planet to have bugs the size of a drop pod and exploding plants? Nah, man. I think the Elves knew exactly what they were doing when they found it. They saw a resource-rich deathtrap and thought, ‚ÄúPerfect. Let the dwarves deal with the bugs.‚Äù

And you know what‚Äôs really gonna mess us up? If we dig deep enough one day and find **Elf ruins**. Just imagine: ancient Elf tech hidden at the core of Hoxxes IV, proving they‚Äôve been running this whole operation for centuries. Mission Control would immediately cut us off with, ‚ÄúStay focused, miners. Get back to the Morkite.‚Äù

# Why Orcs and Elves?

It makes perfect sense. Orcs do the dirty work of yelling at us and keeping us on task, while the Elves stay hidden and rake in the profits. The dwarves are the perfect workforce: brave, loyal, and fueled by beer. And as long as we keep chanting ‚ÄúRock and Stone,‚Äù the whole system keeps running smoothly.

**TL;DR**: Mission Control is an Orc. The Elves are secretly running Deep Rock Galactic. They‚Äôre exploiting us dwarves for profit, destroying the ecosystem of Hoxxes IV, and distracting us with beer and catchy slogans. One day, we‚Äôll dig too deep and find out the truth‚Äîbut until then, Rock and Stone, I guess.

**EDIT**: Okay, maybe I‚Äôve had one too many Glyphid Slammers, but tell me this doesn‚Äôt make sense. **You can‚Äôt.**",2,1735560722.0,DeepRockGalactic,0,1.0,False
1hply2b,https://i.redd.it/aaag5ps19z9e1.jpeg,the warehouse sale got me üò≠üò≠ my first time w all these products + yapping some opinions down below ,"i‚Äôve never owned a bdc before and i gotta say i‚Äôm IMPRESSED with how well it moisturises my lips. i do have some individual opinions on each of the lippies though - 

lavender: she‚Äôs great, nice pinkish purple tint. the fragrance isn‚Äôt so strong but if i were to smell it up close it‚Äôs quite waxy/crayon-y but not in a bad way. 

espresso: a weird observation i have with the bdc duo is that it literally smells like the cereal, koko krunch?? (anyone that grew up in SE asia know what i‚Äôm talking about??) mind you, i haven‚Äôt had koko krunch in over a decade but it‚Äôs does remind me of my childhood üòÖ not so coffee-like but a sort of artificial chocolate with milk powder. 

unfortunately it‚Äôs my least fav due to colour on my lips, looks a bit liked i smeared melted chocolate on them but it‚Äôll defs work better on people with darker lips. i‚Äôll probably use it over a dark lipstick for extra gloss.

biscotti: defs a more no-makeup product i‚Äôll use as it gives my lips a light brown glow that‚Äôs a bit closer to my skintone (G8-9). the smell is pretty waxy/crayon-y with a sweet caramel note. not as elegant as i‚Äôd hoped for but it‚Äôs not revolting.

the ultra lip in pony: SHE‚ÄôS THATTTT GIRL. i was worried i would be a bit too dark for the shade but she makes my lips look ü´¶ such a gorgeous & natural glow, i fully converted from clinique black honey. my only gripe is the lid keeps falling off (and it was partially off when i received my order oops).

‚Äî as for the non-lip products ‚Äî

the lash kit: to be honest, i just wanted to try the mascara without getting the curler but it was more expensive to get it separately.

imo the curler SUCKS. it feels flimsy and cheap, there‚Äôs no ‚Äòbounce‚Äô to the press, and i pinched my eyelid trying to curl my lashes. i have much better & cheaper boots (UK pharmacy) curler that i‚Äôm still going to use.

the mascara is lovely though, it definitely elevates my lashes in a way that isn‚Äôt over the top, doesn‚Äôt clump, and looks very clean. it reminds me of clear mascaras that i used to have in my teenage years.


future dew solid vs. haloscope: i‚Äôm putting these two together because they‚Äôre pretty much the same thing. future dew is more wet, while haloscope has a lot more sheen. for both, if i already have my makeup on, i‚Äôd worry about the drag as there‚Äôs a bit of friction on application. i would probably dab some on a finger and dot the product in ‚ú®the glossier way‚ú®

you (solid): it smells as concentrated as the the liquid, but really doesn‚Äôt have much sillage on application as expected. i can‚Äôt really smell the top notes, it goes straight to the mid/base notes of pink pepper and woody musk.

it‚Äôll be nice for a touch-up but i would pair it with the liquid you or use it to layer with another complimenting scent :)

However, someone in the tech industry invited me to join their small SaaS startup. Their product is scheduled to launch in Q1 2025, and it‚Äôs a lead generation tool. To be honest, I‚Äôve never had much knowledge about this type of tool. After having a cup of coffee with the founder, I could sense their confidence in the product, but I still have doubts about whether joining such a startup team is the right choice. 

I‚Äôve already done some research on lead generation tools and learned that there are existing options available, such as Leadfeeder, LeadsRebel, and LeadsNavi. While I can‚Äôt provide detailed insights into the product, I would say it will be somewhat similar to LeadsNavi, which tracks visitor IPs on clients‚Äô websites and captures some details. The startup‚Äôs product may offer a slightly broader range of features at a lower annual price (but the monthly plan will be higher than the competitor).

My husband got an espresso machine for Christmas as we both really like coffee but have never really gotten into drinking ‚Äúproper‚Äù ones. 
So far we‚Äôve just went to the nearest grocery store and bought beans from a brand we‚Äôve heard of. After a few cups and some research we found out that making coffee with fresh roasted beans is best. 

So off to a journey to local coffee shops. Found one that offered a trial package for beans, 4 100g packs with various intensities. Although none of them had a date when it was roasted, just the usual expiry date.

Neither of us has got any clue which kind of beans we would like. I am going to go to a local roaster we have found and see what I can get there. I‚Äôm just afraid of two things:


- beans come in so many varieties, is it even likely to find ‚Äúthe perfect‚Äù ones?
- beans are also not really cheap if you‚Äôre looking to buy a bunch at once just to try 


Question now is, is there any ideas how to find out beans we‚Äôd like and start trying to get those beans properly made into coffee? Because for each different bean we‚Äôve tried, the amount of graded beans and pressure and so on varies so hard, it‚Äôs almost impossible to be consistent and actually get good at brewing.


More info:

I‚Äôm a latte drinker, I enjoy softer yet not sweet coffees

My partner likes the sweeter coffees, at best with some Sirup or extras in his cup (like Cinnamon)

We have got a barista machine from a no name brand that got recommended to us. It has a grinder with 15 settings, pressure meter and milk steam thingy. To a beginner like me absolutely overwhelming to find out how to make it just right. 

Current budget for beans is around 50-100‚Ç¨ until our salary comes mid January.

Not as of yet at least. BUT, I have noticed improvement, and I‚Äôd like to share my experience so far.

I was/am afraid of making a post like this lest I jinx myself but if this will bring a little bit of comfort to anyone in the same situation as me it‚Äôll be great. Lord knows I needed something like this months ago.

Just in case you‚Äôre not interested in reading my lengthy case study:

‚ÄúHow long did it take you to really notice healing and/or improvement?‚Äù
6 months (for me personally).
I‚Äôm still nowhere near fully healed, but progress is something.

I‚Äôll start off by sharing what happened and my hypothesis on what caused my gastritis:

My Diagnosis: Chronic Mild Gastritis (Inactive)

I‚Äôm 21F (20 when it happened) My gastritis started early July (so it‚Äôs been 6 months now) and it began with an acid reflux flair while eating a cookie. I‚Äôve never experienced anything like that before, so it was terrifying. I felt a burning sensation in my chest and feeling of acid rising but I couldn‚Äôt vomit with strong heart palpitations and tightness in throat. It happened at 1-2 am and it took about an hour to calm down.

After a week of it not going away, I went to the doc, who prescribed me omeprazole 20 mg off the bat. I went home and took it. After a week the change was like night and day. The pain was still there, but it wasn‚Äôt as constant and excruciatingly hard to ignore as before.

A month after I began omeprazole I had lab work (stool, blood, urine) and an endoscopy with biopsy done. I was negative for H. Pylori and the inflammation was in the body and antrum of my stomach. I was prescribed a couple other meds to take for 14 days that in all honesty, didn‚Äôt make much of a difference past the first couple days. After the round of meds, I didn‚Äôt feel better, so I went back on omeprazole for relief. The short time I went off meds I felt super nauseous so I had to go back.

2-3 months into my gastritis predicament is when I really started to be strict about my diet. I‚Äôd like to add that I wasn‚Äôt eating trigger food items before hand, I was just eating eggs, rice, and yogurt that is if I ate anything at all because of the fear of pain. Everything I ate hurt those early months. I was losing weight too quickly so I tried to broaden food items within the gastric safe diet
A couple of foods I ate that were safe (FOR ME):

- Plain white rice
- Eggs (scrambled, boiled)
- Sourdough bread
- Non fat Greek yogurt 
- Avocado
- Salmon
- Tilapia
- Plain boiled chicken
- SWEET POTATO 
- Papaya (Can also make juice out of this)

There are more, but I wish I got some item ideas back then instead of doing a lot of research on my own.
DISCLAIMER: I am aware everyone is different. I know some can‚Äôt handle salmon or avocados, but this is just an idea. You know your body best. Trial and error within your diet boundary is what will help you establish a meal plan and what‚Äôs safe.

Current time, I‚Äôm officially omeprazole free.
Why did I stop taking omeprazole?
I decided it was for the best. After 4-5 months of taking it the side effects outweighed the benefits and I felt more comfortable attempting to get off of it. I felt weak all the time, developed carpal tunnel, had horrible constipation and migraines.
I just thought it was best. My dose never changed from 20 mg. As to how I did it, I just researched online and the Reddit and took some advice along with listening to how my own body reacted. It‚Äôs been 12 days since my last dose.
YET ANOTHER DISCLAIMER: I am no professional licensed doctor. I IMPLORE you to talk with your primary care doctor or gastro specialist if you have one on how to proceed and what‚Äôs best for YOU. The only reason I took this route is because I didn‚Äôt have the resources or privilege to make more appointments or see a specialist. But if you do, I highly recommend it.

My Origin Cause Hypothesis:

I don‚Äôt know the cause for a fact. I had a lot of bad habits when it came to eating, but with research I realized it isn‚Äôt necessarily just about the food you eat. I didn‚Äôt eat ‚Äúunhealthy‚Äù foods often. No fast food, no spicy foods, no smoking, no drinking, any of that. I had my occasional fried food but not so often to think it‚Äôd be a problem. I say this to say, sometimes it isn‚Äôt JUST about those things.

I didn‚Äôt realize how little I chewed my food until now. It‚Äôs actually recommended for people to chew 32 times thoroughly to aid digestion. Your saliva helps break down your food so your stomach will have an easier time, and I didn‚Äôt do that properly. I think back then at most my normal was 10-15 chews if I were to guess. Now I make sure to bite carefully, especially after those weeks of having a constricted throat.

2. Binge eating, especially late night
‚Äî
I‚Äôm a night owl. I‚Äôd sleep very late and would often eat out of boredom or habit. I‚Äôd eat even when I was not hungry or even full. I‚Äôve stopped doing this and do not eat after a certain time at night. (Tea helps. If I‚Äôm feeling peckish I just have a cup of chamomile tea w/ honey)

3. Sleeping face down
‚Äî
I LOVED sleeping face down. It was the most comfortable for me. But this coupled with my late night snacking habits, weren‚Äôt good for me. I could have a full meal late night, be on my phone for 5-10 minutes and then immediately go lay in bed on my stomach. I can‚Äôt imagine that pressure was good for my full stomach and sleeping does slow down digestion. Now I sleep with my head/chest elevated on my left side or face up on bad nights.

4. Fasting
‚Äî
I had an eating disorder. As jarring as that sounds it‚Äôs as simple as I can put it lol. I would go nearly full days of not eating a thing promptly followed by binge sessions BECAUSE I was starving. For me it was either side of the extremes. I would either eat too much to the point of pain and discomfort, or nothing at all. I didn‚Äôt know how to eat normally, and that‚Äôs something I‚Äôm working on fixing with a schedule and thought out meals!

5. Caffeine
‚Äî
Coffee apparently isn‚Äôt meant to be drank on an empty stomach. This was NEWS to me. I‚Äôd wake up and have coffee right after more than not. I‚Äôd also have green tea with 0 calorie sweetener (highly processed I imagine), as well as decaf later in the day. YES, apparently even decaf coffee can do harm. I no longer drink those, I opt for chamomile tea with honey. I love coffee so it sucks, but it‚Äôs for the better.

6. Weight and Activity
‚Äî
I began a weight loss journey about a year and some months ago. From then to today I‚Äôve officially lost over 80 pounds. 60 before gastritis and 20 after gastritis began. When I started losing weight initially I‚Äôd go on walks and get about 4-8k steps in, sometimes 10k. But after a while I kind of just stopped. It was several months after I stopped being active that my gastritis began. I‚Äôm not saying it cause it, but activity does aid digestion. I haven‚Äôt been as active as I used to be, but my new year resolution is to start going on walks again even if they‚Äôre small.

7. STRESS!!!
‚Äî
I cannot stress this enough, stress. I‚Äôm a full bottle of anxiety wrapped in a red bow. There could be absolutely nothing wrong and I‚Äôll still stress. On occasion I still get stress rashes. I think I will always have an issue with it, but I‚Äôm trying to learn relaxation methods and emotional regulation. Hell, I stress about not stressing. My best friend nowadays is distractions. Hobbies, friends, shows, books, anything! I just remind myself that things are OKAY. And even if they aren‚Äôt, they won‚Äôt always be like this.

8. Nutrition
‚Äî
I don‚Äôt mean this as just the usual discourse about spicy, fatty, or fried foods because although those do play a part, there‚Äôs also other questions I asked myself.
‚ÄúIs the food I‚Äôm eating too calorie dense for its size?‚Äù
‚ÄúDo I continue to habitually eat meals that make me feel bad just for the taste?‚Äù
‚ÄúHow processed are the products I‚Äôm consuming?‚Äù
All these I imagine played a part in my inflammation. I‚Äôm also lactose intolerant, and I love all things lactose. I‚Äôd eat it anyway and just deal with the tummy ache. It really is a curse. I‚Äôm lactose free now and when and if I do heal to a 100% I‚Äôm still going to try to avoid it, sadly. Any thing to keep my stomach happy and inflammation free.

My Intial Symptoms:
- Heart Palpitations
- Burning in stomach
- Throat tightness 
- Chest pain (middle, left, and right)
- Belching
- Nausea
- Bloating
- Feeling painfully full all the time
- Loss of appetite
- Malabsorption
- Upper back pain
- Abdominal pain (intestinal area)
- Pain in sides
- Blood in stool
- Constipation

My Symptoms Now:
- Chest pain
- Belching 
- Malabsorption
- Pain in sides
- Constipation
- Abdominal pain (intestinal)
- Back pain (occasional)
- Bloating (occasional)
- Rib pain
- Burn in stomach (occasional)

Improvement is improvement! Hopefully it‚Äôs up from here. Again, I hope I do not jinx anything!

I hope this was able to help someone or at least bring some comfort. If you did read all this, thank you I know it‚Äôs quite a lot. I wish you all steady healing this year. Nobody talks about how hard it is to live like this but regardless I think we are all doing our best. Here‚Äôs to a new year!

1hplt9q,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskDocs/comments/1hplt9q/i_seem_to_neither_gain_or_lose_weight/,I seem to neither gain or lose weight.,"Male, mid-20s, around 6'0 tall.


Last year, I weighed around 144lbs and had a low (around 12%) body fat percentage. I always had seemed to have a very high metabolic rate and naturally burned fat off very efficiently even without additional daily exercise.


In the year since then, I've gone through a bad period of alcohol abuse (about 6 months long) that saw my weight jump to just over 200lbs. I was in very bad cardiovascular health as a result and was so much heavier than I was randomly straining/injuring my Achilles tendon just from walking around.


Since then, I've stopped drinking entirely and have focussed on losing all of that weight and getting back to my original 12% body fat. This went fine for a while and I quickly dropped lbs, but then I reached 154lbs (10lbs heavier than my starting weight) and... Nothing is changing.


I am consistently eating within a 500-1,000 calorie daily deficit and I'm just not losing any weight. I'm always still 154lbs or just under (which is a natural daily fluctuation, not progress).You could argue that maybe I'm not being attentive enough with my diet, but I am. I log the calories I ingest in *everything* - even down to the tiny amount of milk in my coffee. I'm in caloric deficit.


You could also argue that maybe my weight is balancing out due to muscle growth, but it's not that either. My body fat percentage has remained the same and I'm visibly still fattier than I should be.


I don't want to suggest that I'm somehow breaking the laws of science because I know how ridiculous that sounds, but this is my experience.


Perhaps most bizarrely, I don't seem to gain weight either. Over the Christmas period, I've broken my calorie deficit for about a week straight so that I can enjoy the food. Despite all of the calories I've consumed in chocolate alone, I haven't gained any weight. I'm still 154lbs. I don't understand it.


For what it's worth, most of my body fat seems to be centred around my abdomen/stomach. I'm beginning to question whether the alcohol abuse has made me develop a condition that has locked me at 154lbs with some sort of abdominal fluid retention that is making me appear fattier than I actually am.",1,1735560189.0,AskDocs,1,1.0,False
1hplt11,https://www.reddit.com/r/ftm/comments/1hplt11/a_group_of_kids_actually_treated_me_as_a_guy/,A group of kids actually treated me as a guy ,"Okay, I know it's not a big deal. But I live in a rather small community. My hair's currently longer than I'd like it to be, and I have a massive baby face. I just went out to get my weekly shopping done, and I was going back home. There's a school on my way back, and their football court is always open, and you can pass through there anytime you want. The problem is that there's multiple places for balls to get stuck - and even adults have trouble with getting them back. I attended said school, so I know how to get those balls back. 

A group of kids was playing on that court, and of course their ball got stuck. Generally it's seen as rude in here to retrieve those balls for them - the kids really like their independence, and it's a MASSIVE ego boost for whoever gets the ball back. But no, those kids actually approached me, and I swear i almost cried at ""excuse me sir?"". Weird? Yeah, kinda. But that's actually the first, first, FIRST time someone said it to me naturally, without prompting or anything. My native language is heavily gendered, and even after seeing what I look like and hearing my voice (let's sum it up by saying I've successfully done stereotypical anime girl monologues), they kept referring to me as male. I actually got to play the strong adult and get that ball for them. It might be weird but I'm in tears as I type this. These kids didn't hesitate for a second, they just saw an adult who could help and asked for it, but to me it's a massive deal. And now I'm sitting in bed, drinking a black coffee (idk why, it's always been a very stereotypically masculine drink here, it's fun)

And oh my god i hope i see them again.",1,1735560163.0,ftm,1,0.99,False

1hplnne,https://www.reddit.com/r/childfree/comments/1hplnne/why_dont_breeders_control_their_spawn/,Why don‚Äôt breeders control their spawn??,My friend gifted me a steel tumbler cup for Christmas which I‚Äôve been loving as it encourages me to make my own coffee at home and keeps my drinks cold all day. I filled it with coffee this morning and brought it to work and I‚Äôve left it at my register. A lady came in with three rowdy kids and she didn‚Äôt even pay any attention to them! They were playing with the products in the store meaning I‚Äôll have to clean everything up. We have some gift sets on display at my counter and my tumbler was a few inches behind them. The kids made their way to the counter and suddenly I heard a loud bang. They had knocked over one of the gift sets and it created a domino effect and pretty much launched my new tumbler off the counter and broke the lid. There was coffee all over the floor and the mother watched me pick up every piece of the cup and wipe up the spill. All she said was ‚Äúoh was that your coffee? Haha! Sorry!‚Äù The lid is completely broken meaning I can‚Äôt take it out anymore and the function to close the cup is unusable. I‚Äôm so angry! I don‚Äôt mind kids being in the store as long as they are behaving. But when parents just let their kids run wild in stores because they won‚Äôt have to clean up any damage? It drives me absolutely insane. The lady is lucky I was working because I‚Äôm not afraid to speak my mind and say things as they are. But I like my job so I held my tongue. I can‚Äôt even finish the remainder of the coffee that didn‚Äôt spill as I fear there may be plastic in it. Stupid dumb bitch I hope karma comes for her. ,14,1735559619.0,childfree,13,0.89,False

Friday: 
Da'rell Anderson Agent (They/Them) 6:27 PM You know, it's fascinating how some people can convince themselves they're always right, even when everyone around them sees the truth. I've been reflecting on how that must feel. You know? 

Da'rell Anderson Agent in (They/ Them) PM 6:30 I guess some people build a reality so intricate, they actually believe their own lies. It must be exhausting keeping track of which version of the truth they've told. Well, guess a latte is out. I'll be seeing you soon enough. Maybe then, coffee? I would love to hear your fable. The one you wrote way back in college. Not the current one.


I'm transitioning out of academia and into the world that requires a LinkedIn page. I didn't want to make one but then I started noticing jobs requiring a LinkedIn so I started to throw one together. I honestly thought they were doing it to verify identities but apparently they're all militantly checking resumes against LinkedIn profiles?! Hahaha oh no üôà. I'm bad with dates and COVID completely wrecked my time keeping abilities so I'm sure the years are off by one or 2. 

But aside from that, everything is true, it's just crudely out together. I wouldn't consider the page ""complete"" yet. I do chunks at a time. 

Well, I didn't think anyone could see it and I made zero connections and just kind of tried to hide in the corner of LinkedIn High drawing no attention to myself. Like I'm only here because you're forcing me to be here type of vibe. 

So I get a few friend or whatever requests. I also get views from people I have really bad vibes with right now. Idk why I responded to this message. Maybe because their location was super local and because I was kind of offended that they acted like I sought them out when they viewed my profile first! The LinkedIn High drama has officially sucked me in. I shouldn't have spoken to anyone. 
But I did speak to someone and now I'm dealing with the consequences.

They said all of the weird and mean stuff and referenced places I'm a regular at just like whatever. That award they ask about, like, you're this crazy investigator but you can't figure out how to call the uni I taught at and confirm my nomination? It's a really prestigious award and it usually goes to tenured long term profs and I was nominated for it at the end of my first year of teaching full-time. I was and am very proud of that so that's why the f*ck it's on there. And who cares. 

At first I thought they were asking me out on a date. Then I thought they were trying to intimidate me. Then I thought they were trying to scare me on the verge of being kind of threatening. 

I contacted LinkedIn, they said this is totally not a violation of any rules, this is life at LinkedIn High. So I think now I have my profile as locked down as it can possibly be which makes it feel pretty useless, but none of this felt normal to me, to the point of me really wondering if it's a mean bot. Rude Robot? Negging Nightmare? Just a misunderstanding? A bad date ask? Or I am unknowingly committing white collar crimes even though i can't even put together a LinkedIn page?? And the fable thing! Omg I won an award for writing something and I was applying for a writing job so I just dumped everything in there. But again, who cares? Why is this person/bot being absolutely crazy like this? It's also worth noting that a fable is has specific requirements to technically be a fable- a moral taught and talking animals, so like, they think my dog is talking to me. 

Can anyone tell me if this is just what to expect from LinkedIn? It's making me feel uneasy.    ",1,1735559541.0,jobs,0,1.0,False

So this happened to me about a month ago. I wasn‚Äôt looking for anything serious as I‚Äôm currently living overseas and was planning to go back home soon. Anyways, I met this girl on an online dating app and we spoke for a month everyday and then finally met up. Instant chemistry and sparks from the get go, after that we were inseparable and she was coming over to cook at mine and spend time with me and my dogs. I would say she loved bomb me writing me love letters and doing so many nice gestures for me to the point I was like this might be the one. Even when I was overseas for work she‚Äôd travel to my house to check on my dogs. I had come out of a long term relationship of 9 years and got cheated on so I didn‚Äôt want to jump into anything so soon but she played everything right. 

So after about 2 months of getting closer and her telling me she loves me and she hasn‚Äôt had this with a guy in a long time I started to change my plans and put things in place to stay in the country for another year to see how it goes (which is a big deal changing my life plans around for someone). Then her behaviour started changing towards me after everything was perfect saying she was feeling ‚Äútoo comfortable‚Äù and felt like we were an old couple only spending time at home & that I don‚Äôt plan enough dates. This is not true as we did go out many times. Anyways this wasn‚Äôt a big deal for me I said of course we can do more dates and activities it was her who was loving to spend time at mine. Then she turned to being stand offish with me so I did so many nice gestures to get her back like sending flowers to her work, coffees in the morning etc and planned a very romantic dinner out. During the night this dinner was perfect we had so much fun laughing and enjoying eachother company, there was drinks involved but both of us were still fine. We ended up back at mine and the next morning she left in a hurry and that was the end of it. She said I took advantage of her on all levels and crossed all boundaries she can‚Äôt remember half the night from leaving dinner and feels abused (she drove her car back to mine lol). I just don‚Äôt understand this behaviour we are two adults and I didn‚Äôt force her to do anything but she won‚Äôt take any accountability. It‚Äôs not like it‚Äôs the first she‚Äôs stayed at mine or we‚Äôve been intimate. I tried multiple times to try and communicate to resolve this but she said she‚Äôs done and feels traumatised and if I keep trying to get in contact she‚Äôll go to the police and file a report. Some of her reasoning is ‚ÄúI‚Äôm not gentleman enough‚Äù not removing her makeup and things like that she would always complain about things like which side of the road I‚Äôd walk on and just very picky always bringing down my character. Keep in mind I know I‚Äôm a gentlemen and a very caring person.

Anyways it‚Äôs left me not only heart broken but so confused in my own mind how someone can go one from one extreme to the other and then out of my life that easily‚Ä¶",2,1735558490.0,ghosting,0,1.0,False
1hpld9l,https://www.reddit.com/r/offmychest/comments/1hpld9l/relationships_are_dead/,Relationships are dead,"Someone please try to change my mind, cause i think i am slowly becoming jaded. I think modern relationships are dead and not worth the effort. 

I don't want this to eventually end up in man vs. woman or women-bad/men-bad type of discussion, because I think it essentialy boils down to how many options someone have. Women are usually ones with more options, but that doesn't mean men cannot also have a full plate to chose from. But since i am a man, there is nothing i can do, but to speak from my experience and point of view. 

I had quite a few flings, short relationships, situationships and a few long relationships, longest for two years. When i was younger, i had a flings with taken women and i also been cheated on, call it karma, cause maybe it is. But those experiences showed me from both sides that we humans are....well human and things are more complicated that the promise of relationship. 

Anyone wants the best for himself, that is truth anyone should respect. ""The best"" may vary, be it looks, status, money, sense of humor, world view, morals. I am constantly trying to better myself, as i am figuring out new things, but there are men, that have it better figured out or whatever. Now what happens, when i am already in relationship and suddenly meet someone better than my partner? 

I spent some time thinking hypoteticaly, what would happen, if I was in a happy relationship for a year or two with a cute girl next door and suddenly i met like Sydney Sweeney or someone that is absolutely my type and she would make it very clear that she wants to have something with me. Now i am entering shallow territory, but bear with me. 

It is easy to say the first no, almost like jumping to an icy cold water. The less you think about it the soon you push off the ground and in the air you don't have much control about what will happen. It is also easy to be dismissive, if she wouldn't take no for an answer and start to be agressive and pushy. but what would happen, if she played her cards just right? 

I see it all around me, guys are either players who don't give a fuck, or kind of desperate for intimacy, so they don't give a shit about someone having an relationship. Girls and guys can act same in this situation. You meeting new people in bars, clubs, concerts, in libraries, or coffee shop, job etc. it is more common that men finding girls even through social media. Eventually you bound to meet someone who has all the good traits of your SO but few better ones. 

Most people are not going to give up the time spent building a relationship, at least not if you spent a year on that relationship. But you met someone, that at first looked like a better match, even if you are not considering break up, that one thing that intrigued you stays in your mind and there is a good chance you might start to project it on your partner, to get them to be like that. thats when the tension start and that i feel is like a finish line to the end. 

If you are a catch, you have choices, so you can afford to put pressure on the relationship you currently in. I think women have better choices, because it's still expected from men to make a move, court a woman, take her on dates and so on. Woman can easily get a date, if she wants to, and as i've been told and as i understand it, women have more guys to pick from, but most of the guys are either creeps or unattractive to her. She can even approach, if she likes a man that much, but he is not doing anything. 

That said, men have it harder and harder to find a relationship. Some succeed, some fail, and there is more and more guys out there, who want a partner, but can't get one. They improve, but somewhere on that path some guys stop giving a shit about the status of girls relationship and still try to get in her good graces. For this many women seem to go from relationship to relationship. 

It is what it is, but it doesn't mean that everyone is bad, maybe a bit shallow, but in many situations, we can't help ourselves, or doesn't know any better, asi it would take a literal prophet to know al the right choices. Sometimes it can happen even not intentionally. You meet a cool person you like maybe in the romantic way and want to see what's up. They are in relationship and you respect that, so you talk like a friends. Then they tell you they have feelings for you and they break up, or have already broken up with their partner. Sometimes you don't even know it was for you.

As far as I can tell, I have VMs since 6/7yo. The first diagnostic that I had was by a surgery on this one. Its a VM localized on my right scapula. It was really inflated and there was some intense pulse in there. After the surgery they deduced it was an muscle hypertrophy (they only found some veins here).

Back in 2018, one day after an intense movement, I felt again an intense pain/pulse in my legs (clearly similar to the one on my scapula. After some medical examination, they found that I had 10/20 VMs in my body (legs, face, arms, fingers, ...). I had some embolisation/laser on some of my VMs but I have no decrease of those VMs. The only thing that worked was on a VM localized on one of my finger that was scalped. It didn't came back since the surgery.

Today I am 23yo. I am on Kardegic 160mg, it helps by reducing the pain in my VMs. I also try to drink less alcohol, eat less sugar and eat less fatty food (I have the feeling that I have less pain since I do that) and I like coffee has it reduce the pain also. I also have 3/4 pairs of compression socks...

The weekend was over, and cursed Monday was here again. Groaning, I struggled out of my cozy bed, shuffled to the washroom, and begrudgingly brushed my teeth. An unsuccessful attempt to do my business added to my morning misery.

Throwing on a t-shirt and pants, I longed for my comfy pajamas. As I moved to the kitchen, the warm lights pierced my sleepy eyes. I stood at the counter, brain foggy, body sluggish, and skin still warm from my shower. A sudden chill in the room snapped me back.

‚ÄúBreakfast,‚Äù my brain muttered. I reached for the oats, poured milk, and set the pot on the hob. While they cooked, I remembered my dying phone and plugged it in. Back at the counter, I stirred the oats, dumped them on a plate, and realized the time: 8:05. My friend would pick me up at 8:30.

I wolfed down my bland oats like a toddler, added honey for mercy, and rushed to get ready. Shoes? Check. Socks? Oh, wait‚Ä¶ Back to the bedroom, grabbed a pair, and was finally good to go. As I grabbed my backpack and stepped out, my friend texted, ‚ÄúArriving in 3 minutes.‚Äù Perfect timing.

Outside, I spotted his car, hopped in, and immediately appreciated the seat warmer. ‚ÄúMorning,‚Äù I greeted. He reciprocated with a smile, and we exchanged weekend updates as he drove. Before I knew it, we reached my office‚Äîtraffic was light thanks to vacation season.

Bidding him goodbye, I scanned into the building. In the elevator, I noticed a speck of mud on my shoe. ‚ÄúGreat,‚Äù I thought. The strong, strange smell in the elevator distracted me, but I chalked it up to poor ventilation. Coffee was my next stop, hoping caffeine could salvage my mood.

With coffee in hand, I reached my room‚Äîand froze. A horrifying realization struck: that wasn‚Äôt mud on my shoe. Lifting my right leg, I confirmed the awful truth. Dog poop. The sole was caked in it.

Panicked, I dashed to the bathroom. Paper towels, soap, and sheer determination helped me clean the mess. But then, disaster struck again: my jacket brushed against the poop. Now my hand, shoe, and jacket were victims. After scrubbing everything furiously, a colleague walked in, catching me mid-poop-cleanup yoga pose. Mortified, I muttered something about bad mornings, and he quickly retreated.

As if the universe hadn‚Äôt punished me enough, the sink was choked, filled with murky water. I managed to clean my shoe somewhat and went to inform the janitor. On the way, I intercepted another colleague heading to the cursed bathroom. ‚ÄúTrust me, you don‚Äôt want to go in there,‚Äù I said, leading him to an alternate washroom.

All this chaos, embarrassment, and rage because some pet owner couldn‚Äôt pick up after their dog. Seriously, folks, if you‚Äôre a pet parent, please clean up your dog‚Äôs business. Spare the rest of us your neglect‚Äôs shitty consequences‚Äîliterally.",2,1735557885.0,Finland,7,0.56,False

After a quick trip to Nashville the Stewarts are off to shop for a new car, buy Gil a new iPhone and head to the mountains for Gil‚Äôs 60th birthday celebration. Carlin is able to successfully navigate the weekend without speaking to or even standing near Erin and manages to corral Tori in for a quick picture. 2025 is sure to be a big year for the Stew Crew‚Ä¶ will it include speech therapy, a security fence around the pool OR an ounce of privacy for their children?

2.Katie Clark continues to land big partnerships. The latest is Land‚Äôs End. Meanwhile, her 1 year old is still paying the bills. Hailey is in full on sistermom training mode baby wearing her doll and helping to feed baby Harvey. The Clarks head to the mall for the 65th time this month and have their kids picture made with Santa while both are fast asleep. Katie sold letters to Santa, takes pictures with Santa but refuses to say that Santa visits her kids. Katie announces that she is undergoing a major, massive hair overhaul. This involves removing her extensions, dying her hair the same exact color and trimming 1/4 of an inch. Travis just lavishes praise on her by saying she ‚Äúlooks like 2019 Katie‚Äù‚Ä¶ and she lets us know that she will likely be getting extensions added again. They film a fake Christmas morning a week early for maximum exploitation and then Travis runs away to go play in Nashville while Katie has to recruit her mom to help her take Hailey to the doctor to have her cast removed. Travis makes a video with some YouTube duo named Caleb&Kelsey. It‚Äôs a cover of an old hymn but never fear‚Ä¶ on the long trip to Jersey, he shares new music that sounds exactly like all of his other music and says it will be released in January. In their weekly vlog Katie is near tears again while talking about her hair, Travis explains that they have a dog sitter and they rerun the video of him and Evan singing at the tree farm. Driving home from NJ Katie tells us that she now has an Oura ring, they have a ski trip in Utah with her family in February, and all of their children will have an H name. They buy Gil 2 pair of shoes, which is definitely NOT a car and head off to the big weekend party. Katie films a party game where her parents are blindfolded and have to guess which child is speaking to them‚Ä¶ someone in the crowd yells about 37 grandkids‚Ä¶ they currently have 35 and one on the way‚Ä¶ 2025 will definitely include a move for these 2‚Ä¶. Will Travis become a Dove Award winner? Will they offer their children the slightest bit of privacy?

3. Josie Balka is determined to be the bougiest Bates. Days before Christmas, she flies to NYC with friends and coworkers to pose and model at all of the hotspots, including MOMA, the Rockettes and Lion King on Broadway. The pool noodle is featured heavily and her friends are merely accessories. Back at home, Josie gets back to exploiting her children by taking them to Target and filming as they choose wrapping paper. Other shoppers are staring and stopped in their tracks‚Ä¶but Josie films anyway. Kelton shows off a ginormous 7 rib roast he was gifted by the guys at work. He preps and grills it for Christmas dinner. Shortly after Christmas Josie says they are all sick, except for Kelton, who of course is catering to them all hand and foot and made homemade chicken (pool?)noodle soup. They have to miss the big birthday getaway but the Effortless Shop continues to churn out hair curling content. 2025 should be the year the Balkas move into their secret McMansion in the country‚Ä¶ will Josie eek another year out of the curler empire? Will the girls be filmed from the back only??

4. The original gangster, Alyssa Webster, returned to IG after almost 3 weeks of barely posting‚Ä¶& she came to slay. There was coffee content, doughnut content and deserted parks galore. We also saw garage workouts and heavily filtered cartoon children with disappearing noses‚Ä¶ she really rolled out all of the greatest hits. Momma got a Hydrojug sponsorship and she promotes it disguised as a Q and A where she tells us all about her new hair which is bleached blonde, fried and frizzled with cow-lick bangs that she probably already regrets. The filter she uses is warped and she has never seemed more dated in her holey jeans. After all of the coffee content, she has a girls night at a coffee shop. A Christmas miracle seems to have happened and with no promotion at all, her sad hat shop has one less child sized hat, and one less adult sized hat. We don‚Äôt know if she actually sold two hats, or if John and Rhett just needed new ones. The weekly of Vlog shows baby Rhett with a mouth injury. Alyssa says he fell from a table‚Ä¶ The cut is inside of his mouth and outside of his mouth, but they decide not to take him to a doctor. Instead, Alyssa allows him to open a Christmas present early while the girls have to watch. The Webster‚Äôs Christmas tree is full of gifts‚Ä¶ Three times as many as usual. Alyssa says she went overboard with Christmas this year because the girls are getting bigger and they were very good girls this year. I think it is to make up for all of the gifts they will not be getting from the Bates family. Everything is wrapped in boring brown paper. They drop their Christmas special on YouTube and it shows the family in matching pajamas while Alyssa rules over them like a drill sergeant. They have to draw numbers this year and sit in a line to open gifts. The girls are beside themselves to have real gifts instead of shoes and Dollar Tree junk. Allie receives a Critter Corner dollhouse and figures and Maci receives a mermaid dollhouse. The middle two girls have to share a dollhouse and accessories. The gifts are nowhere near even and King Rhett has about 10  different things to open. Lurch is clueless about any of the gifts and has no idea what anything is. Several of the gifts are travel friendly and Alyssa mentions using them on the plane and for travel. Back during her 30th birthday Q and A she said she was contemplating possibly going to Tennessee for her dad‚Äòs 60th birthday‚Ä¶ At the time she said she was thinking about it. Could that be the plane ride she is speaking of? Post Christmas, Alyssa features a picture of she and John wearing Tennessee shirts‚Ä¶ The music behind the picture is a bluegrass song talking about missing my Tennessee home. Obviously Alyssa is trolling‚Ä¶ The speculation about her attendance at her dad‚Äòs 60th birthday is the most excitement she has generated in quite some time. The party weekend comes and goes and no Websters are spotted. Will she fly in when everyone else goes home? Will she stop by on her way to Washington DC for her father-in-law‚Äòs swearing in? In 2025 will we discover WHO Alyssa is angry with? Will she finally land a coffee partnership? Will her children be allowed out of the house?

5. Zach and Whitney Bates celebrated their 11th wedding anniversary with a night out on the town. Whitney wears the boutiques clothes for the date and remains the main one focused on the business. Zach films a reel cooking another steak meal with Bradley and I am convinced they own stock in a cattle farm. Zach invites Michael on for an episode of the Bates Kitchen. He watches while she makes a skillet cobbler with Kaci and Khloe. She has made this hundreds of times growing up. Zach eeks out a second episode with Michael featuring a question and answer session where they talk about their childhood. Michael says cooking was one of the chore choices and she always chose it and Zach gives her credit for raising babies and doing the majority of the cooking. Zach and Whitney take their kids to Dollywood with their new influencer friends and the Stew Crew. Christmas night, Whitney is the first to begin posting links again. They pack up and head out for Gil‚Äòs 60th birthday and on the way Zach tells us that their dog Scout always stays with a dog trainer/border when they travel. Whitney shares pictures of the baby with the dog. It‚Äôs a great proof of life that Scout is alive and well, and probably proof that they live in this Sub. At the resort, we see Zach four wheeling with his kids and grilling. They gift his dad a Blackstone grill for his birthday and Zach says he will give Gil a tutorial. Will 2025 bring Zach a Food Network contract? Will Whitney manage to chug down even more powdered supplements? Will their kids continue to be exploited for the almighty dollar??

6. Erin Paine managed to escape from her beef fat manufacturing long enough to beg the Internet to give her a hammered dulcimer for her kid‚Äôs Christmas‚Ä¶ Let that sentence sink in‚Ä¶ She also happily promoted Lawson‚Äòs Cowboy Christmas song by saying her children had listened to it on repeat. Once Erin sold all of her beef fat moisturizer, she had enough money to rent a moving truck, and suddenly their plans to spend Christmas in Florida changed, and packing quickly commenced. Isaiah and Addee showed up to help pack, along with some Florida friends and that allowed Erin to sit on the couch and film it all. Erin celebrates her best friend and sister Tori‚Äôs birthday and she is absolutely giddy to report that they are heading to a cabin in the Smoky mountains to celebrate Christmas with Tori and her family. I guess Bobby is OK with the Paines constantly crashing his vacation. Erin tells us that they have finally found a home, but they will not be moving in until after the holidays and celebrating her dad‚Äòs birthday. Erin happily shows off her Oura ring along with her homemade gifts from her children and the huge beef tenderloin they have for Christmas dinner. Erin manages to keep several siblings between her and Carlin all weekend while celebrating her dad‚Äòs birthday. 2025 could see the Paine family drop the doodles and become full time beef fat forgers. Will they stay consistent on YouTube for a check? Will Carson/Charles(Carles) begin to smile again?

7. Lydia Bates decided to make over her bedroom and changed her white bed to‚Ä¶ a different white bed. Trace insists on shaving off baby Ryker‚Äòs hair and Lydia does not seem happy about it. Their Vlog is sponsored by Barbers United and Ryker ends up with the same haircut as every other fundie man. They promise to show their families reactions of their birth announcement, but wind up with just a few seconds of reaction‚Ä¶ Trace tells us they lost the other footage, but to trust him that everyone was so excited‚Ä¶rookie mistake Trace. Trace and Lydia head to the farm in South Carolina for Christmas and they are the only married couple there. JebJud and Callie squeeze into the backseat for the ride. We see aunt Jenny‚Äòs Christmas party and cookie decorating contest. Lydia and Trace seem to be very close with the extended family and don‚Äôt miss many get togethers.  They head back home for Gil‚Äòs 60th birthday party. In 2025 we know a new baby will arrive‚Ä¶ will they move? Will Trace actually work construction jobs or will Ryker continue to be the main provider?

8. Michael and Brandon feature the Balka girls making cookies while they discuss Christmas memories. Tori‚Äôs kids pop up for a craft and one of them is wearing Alyssa‚Äôs sad hat. Michael helps Zach out by actually competently cooking on film and explains that she and Brandon plan to switch to vlogging in the New Year. At Gil‚Äòs birthday party in the resort Michael plays nanny all weekend, holding babies, watching kids and completing crafts. Her siblings all praise her. What will 2025 bring for the Keilens? Will we find out about Brandon‚Äôs mystery job? Will Michael up her babysitter fees? Will they continue to exploit their nieces and nephews for views? 

9. Lawson and Tiffany continue their California trip with lots of eating out, tea parties and placing baby Will in odd places like under the Christmas tree. Lawson debuts a music video for his cringey Cowboy Christmas song. Tiffany shows off her dad‚Äòs antique airplane and continuously shows Lawson and the baby in bed shirtless. After several weeks, they have a new YouTube Vlog which shows Lawson in the studio recording Christmas music while Tiffany attempts to handle the baby alone. Apparently it is too much for her to handle because they show up for day two in the studio with a babysitter. Tiffany sings Silent Night and all of the comments are praising her while Lawson‚Äòs talents bring‚Ä¶ Crickets. Out of all of the Christmas songs, he only releases his fever dream and Tiffy‚Äôs remains buried. Maybe next year! Mysteriously their YouTube vlogs that have been out for months have over 100,000 views‚Ä¶ They are receiving pretty good money from YouTube at this point. Tiffy posts several reels reminding everyone that last Christmas no one knew she was pregnant‚Ä¶ Is that a hint? Lawson and Tiffany leave California and make it to Tennessee in time for Gil‚Äôs 60th birthday party‚Ä¶ Tiffany shares nothing from the party but does share pictures of her family with baby Will on the beach. Lawson shares pictures of baby Will with Jane and Bill who are in town for the party. 2025 could be the year these 2 fully move to California‚Ä¶ will they show us Duke again? Will Lawson learn to hold his child? Will Tiffy finally be accepted by the Bates sisters?

10.Kelly was busy wishing happy birthday to Tori, happy anniversary to Zach and Whitney and Bobby and Tori as well as celebrating her own anniversary. Gil did absolutely nothing special for the day and Kelly shows them at home eating lasagna made by Michael. There is now a big screen TV on the wall of the big house‚Ä¶ Times are definitely changing. Proving that she is becoming a full on influencer, Kelly featured the Bates Sisters Boutique lounge sets for a mere $80 apiece. She also tagged the resort that comped them the cabins for Gil‚Äôs 60th birthday. We see pictures and videos of Kelly and Gil with the younger children at the farm for Christmas. Almost all of the children praise her for the huge display of gifts she gave everyone. Who knows where Kelly is getting her money from these days‚Ä¶ but they certainly don‚Äôt mention Gil in the praises. In the new year will KJ continue her glow up? Will she become a full on content creator? Will she trade in the dang denim skirt??

Happy New Year friends‚Ä¶. Here‚Äôs wishing you all a prosperous 2025!

1hpl48k,https://www.reddit.com/r/FriendshipAdvice/comments/1hpl48k/reconsider_to_fix_friendship_or_no/,reconsider to fix friendship or no?,"so i had this big friend group from junior high school, and that friend group was made because of how we all always hang out somewhere after class until late at night. and funny thing is in that friend group was me, my bf, and his ex-situationship (who was my ex-bff). yep there were fights here and there how i not know girl code, and i was villainized enough back then. but then, we were all eventually okay after being with my bf and still got along and hang out until senior high school. but then, as teenagers going through mental issues and still learning stuff in life back then, me and my bf got toxic and was always fighting and breaking up; somehow which wasn't supposed to be intentional, the friend group also gets affected by us. in another perspective of mine, they always butt in in our relationship like they're always a part of our relationship.

since it's a big friend group, ofc there are inner friendships also going on in there, i was bff with one girl and one gay whom i know since elementary and are like my sisters already. there's also another couple in there, some group of girl friendships too, and extensive bff's of my bff's and the bff's of my bf as well.

until pandemic came, and the gay bff of my bf shared something on Facebook which ticked me off because it was clearly about me and my bf on how we are always fighting and so toxic. and even our batchmates and other classmates and those in our friend group are also the ones who reacted on it and are even on the comments about like, ""oops, let's not talk about who it is üôä"" type of sh- and so, i was so angry that i let my bf confront his bff about it on who it is, just so he can say it directly to our faces what's his deal with us. yep i catched that bullet because all the evidences are there how they're all thinking the same on who it is, and yes i know it's us. and yep, he admitted that it was for us.

AFTER ALL THAT, they still have the guts to ask my bf if they can hang out on his house. and i chatted my bf to not let them after what they've done to us, but there goes my bf letting them in. and then i just heard that my bf's gay bff opened my bf and i's chat and red that i didn't like them to hang out at my bf's place and shared it to the whole group without my bf knowing that. and so when my bf returned to them, my girl bff asked my bf how was i and how we were in our relationship and all that, and there she opened up about her and my gay bff (who wasn't there that time) not being able to handle me anymore (pertaining to my behavior and issues).

days after that hangout, my bf asked to see me and there he spilled that my girl bff chatted him on cutting me off completely and that she has no plans on talking to me anymore to say goodbyes or such, as it was a ""cut off."" and yet, she wants my bf to stay in the friend group with them, but ofc my bf said no if they will cut me off. and i just cried heartbrokenly after hearing that. 

after all these years, i still miss them and her mostly. and i'm always thinking to myself, should i have insisted on meeting her back then or talked to her? maybe she was just testing me on our friendship if i really value it? what if i go to their house right now even if that was years ago, we all have changed and have grown since then anyway. i was always hoping to bump into her to meet her for coffee and just have a talk with her.

the friend group is still alive btw; me, my bf, his gay bff, and my gay bff are just the ones not with them anymore. but then, me and my bf's gay bffs still meet up with some of them. they're still okay. i still hang out with my gay bff but with another old classmate of ours (my bf's girl bff), and yet my gay bff also meets up with my ex- girl bff and another girl from the old friend group.

sometimes, i think it's for the better because even before that issue from pandemic, some of us already felt left out during senior high school, it wasn't fun to hang out with them anymore. and my bf also mentioned that that friendship is just for means of hanging out, that they're not really in-depth friends. but atleast, someone to hangout with..",1,1735557407.0,FriendshipAdvice,0,1.0,False

Their Georgia influencer friends, the Hills, showed up for nail dates, shopping trips, Dollywood and a visit to the Biltmore Estate. Tyler Hill and Evan are so enamored that Evan recites Tyler‚Äôs Starbucks order from memory, and forgets to ask Carlin if she even wants anything. Carlin is now featuring mini-vlogs on her IG which Evan says she films with her iPhone. They rerun this same content on their YouTube where he has filmed everything with his Hollywood camera. That means the kids are being filmed by both parents at all times. They must spend an enormous amount of time editing out all of the normal/gross things kids do bc all we see from Layla and Zade is the same wide eyed wonder, faux excitement and Princess smiles. Over and over they feature Zade with heavy subtitles‚Ä¶ subtitles are much easier than speech therapy, obviously. Carlin films herself wrapping gifts so they can have fake, filmed Christmas before heading to Nashville for real Christmas. They make a huge deal of the kids choosing presents for each other and exchanging them in brown paper sacks with white paper. They have a new in home camera set up so Evan can get overhead shots. They film openly in busy stores where you can see people stopping to watch‚Ä¶and they think this is a flex. Evan has the starring role in the new cult church‚Äôs Christmas cantata and then we see the Pastor and his wife piled up under blankets watching movies with their children. That seems normal‚Ä¶Both Layla and Zade work the entire holiday season making ads for Target and Amazon. Carlin happily packs and repacks their new $2000+ luggage sets and tries to convince us she doesn‚Äôt wash her hair while pushing dry shampoo. After a quick trip to Nashville the Stewarts are off to shop for a new car, buy Gil a new iPhone and head to the mountains for Gil‚Äôs 60th birthday celebration. Carlin is able to successfully navigate the weekend without speaking to or even standing near Erin and manages to corral Tori in for a quick picture. 2025 is sure to be a big year for the Stew Crew‚Ä¶ will it include speech therapy, a security fence around the pool OR an ounce of privacy for their children?

In 2025 will we discover WHO Alyssa is angry with? Will she finally land a coffee partnership? Will her children be allowed out of the house?

5. Zach and Whitney Bates celebrated their 11th wedding anniversary with a night out on the town. Whitney wears the boutiques clothes for the date and remains the main one focused on the business. Zach films a reel cooking another steak meal with Bradley and I am convinced they own stock in a cattle farm. Zach invites Michael on for an episode of the Bates Kitchen.

Erin happily shows off her Oura ring along with her homemade gifts from her children and the huge beef tenderloin they have for Christmas dinner. Erin manages to keep several siblings between her and Carlin all weekend while celebrating her dad‚Äòs birthday. 2025 could see the Paine family drop the doodles and become full time beef fat forgers.

Michael helps Zach out by actually competently cooking on film and explains that she and Brandon plan to switch to vlogging in the New Year.

Lawson shares pictures of baby Will with Jane and Bill who are in town for the party. 2025 could be the year these 2 fully move to California‚Ä¶ will they show us Duke again? Will Lawson learn to hold his child? Will Tiffy finally be accepted by the Bates sisters?

10.Kelly was busy wishing happy birthday to Tori, happy anniversary to Zach and Whitney and Bobby and Tori as well as celebrating her own anniversary. Gil did absolutely nothing special for the day and Kelly shows them at home eating lasagna made by Michael. There is now a big screen TV on the wall of the big house‚Ä¶ Times are definitely changing. Proving that she is becoming a full on influencer, Kelly featured the Bates Sisters Boutique lounge sets for a mere $80 apiece. She also tagged the resort that comped them the cabins for Gil‚Äôs 60th birthday. We see pictures and videos of Kelly and Gil with the younger children at the farm for Christmas. Almost all of the children praise her for the huge display of gifts she gave everyone. Who knows where Kelly is getting her money from these days‚Ä¶ but they certainly don‚Äôt mention Gil in the praises. In the new year will KJ continue her glow up? Will she become a full on content creator? Will she trade in the dang denim skirt??

Happy New Year friends‚Ä¶. Here‚Äôs wishing you all a prosperous 2025!

I‚Äôm up! Can‚Äôt believe what has happened in the past 24 hours! Can‚Äôt believe that I will be waking up next to this beautiful and kind-hearted soldier for the rest of my life. And one day with kid toy soldiers next to us.



Let him sleep a bit more? Wake him up for one run around the bases? Scrub him in the shower so his buddies can't see the rings under his eyes at Sergeant Delgado‚Äôs office at 9am? All of the above? IDK. In the meanwhile, I am ordering breakfast and a gigantic flask of coffee from roomservice.



We did gongyo late last night and I had some powerful realizations. This past week Rabbi Mandel spoke about feeling God‚Äôs presence in a pure and harmonious home. Mrs. Mandel spoke about how in Jewish tradition a wife supports and fulfills the husband‚Äôs wishes. I realize that I saw this exactly in Mama. My purpose now should not be to play volleyball or flute as much as I love them. I am an old 16 with woman responsibilities and not a young sweet 16. I have to get ready to be there to support my husband when he finishes BCT. I have to figure out how to get my high school diploma as fast as possible. Maybe I need to transfer to another school that can help me do that. It breaks my heart but it builds my new heart as well.



Anyway, Robert is waking up and reaching for me. Maybe I should be there and let the morning work itself out.

We finished 2 x8 times of chemo, first was heavier with carboplatin. His tumor was 4x5 before and shrinked to 3x4. He is stage 3 as far as i know. No coughing. Single tumor and increased size in one of lymph nodes 2.5cm. His suv value after first round of chemo was 14. It noted reduced size but hyper metabolic activity in pet report. We started 2nd cycle of chemo and this week we are finishing the last 8'th one. We started radiotheraphy at the start of the 2nd cycle of chemo. A total of 4500 radiation units applied in 20 rounds as 20x225. Afterwards they requested a tomography and applied 400x5 units as boost to the core of the tumor. Tomorrow we are going to get the final radiotheraphy. Final 400 unit boost. Afterwards they are going to ask for a new pet scan. My father lost around %13 of his weight since the start. They say its a side effect of chemo. Did not puke not coughed so far. I love him so much. Going to coffee shop everyday and coming back. Crying on the road and pretending everything is normal when i arrive. Everything is normal apart from side effects. I am giving my father good targets that we are going to sit together under the lights of our garden in summerhouse. Speaking of galatasaray, how good we are playing. Watching the matches together.

I am the eldest of 3 sons. My Mom is 60 years old and I feel like she overrelies on her children. She often asks for help doing things, for example:

* Needing help on how to access her bank account. She cannot do this a lot and never remembers her password. I've told her to write it down but whenever I ask her where it is, she says she doesn't know.
* Writing reviews for Shopee - she will ask ""what should I say"", and I will tell her just write what you think about the product. But she will say ""I don't know what the product is like"" when she has been using it and has already given us her opinion on it, and I have to guide her by telling her ""do you think it is good or bad?"".
* Selling things on Carousell - when a buyer messages her, she will say things like ""should I say hello back?"", ""I don't know how to take photos"", ""the buyer is saying he will buy it, what does that mean? What should I say now?"". Then after I tell her, she will say ""oh he replied where do we meet up. What does that mean? How do I reply?"".
* Deciding on basic things - like if she wants to go out or not. She will often say that she wants to go out and I will make sure to be ready on that day to drive her there, but she will cancel suddenly with excuses for things such as ""my favourite shirt is not dry"".
* She will also refuse to read things. E.g When letters come, she will ask us to read it. I will tell her it's simple and she can read it, and then she will just take a look at it and say that she doesn't understand English. She is not amazing at English but she is perfectly capable of talking in it and it's the main language she talks to us and everyone in.

We have taught her the above many times, I've even made guidebooks for her, but she always says she doesn't know how to do it. She constantly justifies that she can't learn or do things because she is ""uneducated"" since she only has secondary school level education.

It makes me very frustrated because it feels like she is purposely being helpless as a form of laziness, and worst of all, she will do this whenever I'm working. She will call me while I'm at work and ask me to help her refund something on Shopee. I have gotten angry at her for the past five years over this, like walking into my room while I'm having meetings, to ask for help on how to reply a message her friend sent (very simple things like ""Do you want to go out for coffee?""). But she still keeps doing it.

She also acts like a child a lot by imitating a baby voice and trying to act cute, and justifying that because she is now old she is regressing into a child. And she says that because we are her children she can rely on us for everything, that's what we were raised for. Whenever I refuse to help and say I will teach her, she will go to my middle brother, who will spoil her by doing everything for her, and so she continues to be helpless.

I don't know how to get through to her that she can't keep acting like a helpless child. At the same time I don't know if I'm being too hard on her and if I should accept that this is just how 60 year olds are - sometimes I worry that I'll regret not giving in to her because she's old. Any advice? This is stressing me out and I honestly am starting to resent her because of this.",17,1735556460.0,askSingapore,55,0.9,False

1hpkuwa,https://www.reddit.com/r/sadstories/comments/1hpkuwa/my_dog_rex_and_christmas_eve_2020/,"My Dog Rex, And Christmas Eve 2020.","This is my first time posting any kind of story. Based on true events, to the best of my memory.

In the Early part of my childhood, around the time I turned 3 or 4, my older brother was around 5, this was 2009-2010.

We had been living in my Nana's (Grandmas) House for about a year, she lived in a spacious house made for a family of 6 or 7 built way back in the 40s from what my dad tells me. Previously we had lived in a cramped apartment that my parents struggled to pay for. My parents had struck up a deal with my Nana to live in the house as long as my parents pay for half the rent -i don't know how much they were paying. Me and my brother shared an office room, repurposed for us to live in, and my parents got the guest room. My Nana already had a dog, a large golden lab, named butterball. Butterball was not the smartest tool in the shed, he could follow any basic commands but besides that there were a few screws loose, like eating grass throwing it up then eating it again. The one part I hated about butterballs treatment at my Nana's house was the fact that she would slap and hit butterball when he didn't do something she wanted him to do, especially if she had  had a lot of the wine in her fridge, and all he could do was cower because he didn't understand. I hated seeing that. About a year after we moved in after my birthday, around 4 years old, my mom and dad decided one day that they would go out and buy me and my brother, a Dog. One that we both would take care of, which we already took care of one dog so they didn't see any harm in getting us one of our own. They leave, later in the evening, and a couple hours later they come through the front door, a small adorable puppy in their arms, My Rex.

Me and my brother (let's call him M), Me and M are ecstatic, this adorable, cute, fragile little thing, scared, and shy, was ours? It was too good to be true. We get him in the backyard, and set him down. This puppy was nearly a year old, and had never seen grass before. He was excited, so excited. And so we just outside Me, M, and Rex. Soon enough we took him back inside after cleaning up after his potty break and playtime. Gotta figure out what he's gonna eat. Give him some of butterballs food, scarfs it down, three bites max. He loves beef! That is the earliest memory I have.

The second memory that comes to mind is my little brother's birthday, Pipsqueak. 2011 October, In and out of the hospital with my dad and brother, waiting and watching. Time flies by. He's arrived. Let's call him E. Snuggled like a bug in a rug, I remember him being wheeled in on one of those little carts, so small, so cute. Just sleeping away. No worry in the world. I get to hold him. Absolutely adorable, this little bundle of joy. Next few days, visit mom in hospital, she's eating ice in a cup, E in bed beside her. Discharge. Back home. As soon as E gets home, we put the car seat down, Rex and Butterball both come up to the seat, E reaches out with his little hands, each party driven by curiosity, one smelling the new scent, the other bewildered by the two creatures that lay before it. Day and night, Rex would not leave E by his lonesome, late at night he would keep watch right next to Es crib. Scared. But brave. Fearfull at what might happen if he didn't watch this small creature. The next day rolls around and me and M are back from school, we do our homework, then lay down where Es planted in a playset, on a soft padded blanket in the second living room. Rex lays next to him watching Es every move. Tossing E a new toy every so often and gently playing tug of war with the gigglepuss.

Christmas 2012, Es walking now. So chunky. Rex loves to play with him and just follow wherever the toddler wanders. He's stomping to the playroom? ""I follow"" is what I imagined he would think. Rex was so loving. We open presents, have family over, great time, great day. Then E opens his gifts. A small toy, a plastic can with a pop of lid, which when pulled off, releases a small spring loaded smiley face into the air. Startles E at first, then he starts giggling, so much giggling. I grab the toy for him and reload it, again and again he motions for me to keep doing it, grabbing it and bringing the spring back. So much giggling. Rex keeping watch from behind one of my Nana's antique chairs, where his bed was put. Just watching my family. Then we get Rex's gift. A rope toy. He loved it. Played tug of war with him over and over and over, he would grab and crouch, then yank yank yank yank, all while doing a low growl that sounded like a racecar ""RRRRRrrrrrRRRRRRRrrrrrrrrRRRRRR"" Every time he tanks he gets louder.

Another memory that I get reminded of often, was ""The Trail"". ""The Trail"" was a pathway through my Nana's yard covering the entire perimeter. Her backyard was very spacious, sporting a tree, concrete paths, and a large pond, a pond that I would eventually learn to swim in. This path was dug through the entire yard cutting through what was once grass was now a dry dirt path. Rex and Butterball were inseparable, where one went the other followed, they made that path with their paws, every day. They would just walk along the path sniffing the grass, the trees, the fence. I remember just watching out the playroom windows, playing with Legos, as they made their laps around. Sometimes a bird or squirrel would find their way into the yard, and when they did, Rex would Get low... Creep upon the poor bird or squirrel... Then he'd pounce. Sometimes he actually got a bird, which I then learned how to put out of its misery, the dog was just being a dog, sorry bird. But, there was one day where he got a squirrel, but not before the squirrel got him. He pounced on a squirrel, which he nipped by its leg, but it then but his lip, to which he tried to shake off, and only managed in spooking butterball who just kept barking and howling. Eventually he shook off the squirrel, which ran up a tree out of more harms way. Comes back inside. Bleeding from the lip, but looking happy, like ""You see that! I got that squirrel! Mhm!"".

Another memory I have is how bad my Mom, Dad and Nana hated when Rex and Butterball used to fart, they always said it smelled like Onions and dead fish. I never knew and still don't know what smell is. I was born with congenital anosmia. No matter how bad they said it smelled, I didn't care, because I couldn't care. I didn't know, and I still don't know. Sometimes I used to think it was a curse, not being able to smell. I was in charge of cleaning poop out the yard, and tedious chore with how many times they used to poop in the large yard.

Yet another memory I have is when I ""Ran away"" as my Grandpa (Moms Parent) puts it. I had accidentally unlatched the back gate to the backyard, leading into the alleyway, where both Rex and Butterball wandered out into the Alley. Come back outside. No dogs? I go out the gate, and see them a long ways down the alley. I chased after them for a while and grabbed them both by their collars to drag them back to the house. Got the scare of my life when my parents run out and sprint at me at full speed as I'm coming back with the dogs in tow cause they thought I ran away, as I had disappeared from the house.

Sometime around around 2013-2014, I believe, we got guinea pigs, two guinea pigs, my little brother's pets. Two females, Stella and Luna. So sweet, and very calm. Hard to feed and keep up with, very high maintenance, lots of poop cleaned up those years. Didn't have the proper cage for them either, dad made a cage out of an old dog kennel, plastic, and a blanket. We used to take them out and place them on the ground to have them run around a lil bit. Rex and Butterball never once tried to harm them. They knew these were friends. We used to put them on Butterballs back, their little claws would dog into and grab hold of his fur, and they'd go on a piggyback ride through the house, keeping a careful watch to make sure they don't fall. One day Stella got sick. Really sick. Don't know how, don't know why, go to bed, wakeup, check the guinea pigs. Take off the little hut. Open eyes, on her side, no response, I pick her up just to make sure. Cold. Ice cold. No breathing. Goodbye Stella. Mom makes the decision to give Luna away for free to some little girl as her birthday present.     I hope you lived well Luna. 

Yet another memory, Sometimes, in the middle of the night or even the middle of the day, Rex would be sleeping or taking a nap. He used to sleep under our coffee table, in the living room near the front door. Coffee table was maybe a foot tall with a shelf low to the ground. Used to shuffle under the cramped space completely flat to the ground. We called it his chicken legs because all that stuck out was his legs and tail.

Then the unthinkable happened, one day I come back from school like usual, only to find my Nana gone. Nowhere to be seen. ""Oh welp."" Go do my homework. Play with Rex. Food, water. Lay down and just pet him.
Front door opens. Nana's back. Rushes past me through the living room. No butterball? Somethings not adding up. Next day. Come home. Nana's at the kitchen table. Cooking something, or reading a book and eating, I can't remember. She sits me and M down. Butterballs gone.
Tumors in his lungs. His lungs were filling with blood, had thrown up all over the backyard, and then collapsed near the playroom door. Butterball was gone. So confused. How could a dog go? How could a dog get cancer? Tell me this is a prank? Will Rex be okay? After that Nana went down a spiral. Drink. Eat a snack. Work. Drink. Eat a snack. Sleep. Repeat. She got really bad. A prominent memory I have of her, is me coming down the hallway from my room. The memory is foggy, but I remember seeing a chair fly from the living room into the kitchen, my Nana screaming bloody Mary. Too much to drink. I spot Rex scramble from his post under the coffee table and down the hallway with me, we scramble back into my room. My dad and mom yelling. Crash boom bang, there goes the aquarium with the fish. Chair busted a hole straight through the bottom corner. Then we moved out. Cramped apartment. Just before we moved out, I noticed one day a small lump in both is ear and his left hind leg.

Moved into cramped apartment early 2016. Big bold letters. NO PETS. Rex cant stay. No matter how bad me and M wanted him there. Not enough space, no place for a dog. Grandma and Papa (Dad's Parents)(Nana is moms) come to our aid and rescue, they have a dog over their own, a small Chihuahua named Lolly, old, but still kicking, mean little thing, but could be sweet sometimes, she used to love me when she could see. Send Rex off to Grandma's.

Turns out they got along well, she would let Rex eat any food she didn't eat, plus Grandma was feeding him her and papas table scraps, come to visit a couple months after the move in, he's gotten chunky, he's sitting behind the screen door, smile on his face, wagging his tail as me and M walk up the porch steps. He's as happy as he could be here. Before we leave, I check the lumps just in case. They're much bigger. The one in his ear the size of a grape, the other in his leg about the size of a toddlers fist. Say our goodbyes, leave and try and get Rex some new diet food. Couple months more, he's back in a healthy weight, we get a photo of him from grandma, both him and Papa were in the backyard, digging up gophers (They're a problem out where they live) and he's got a big fat gopher between his jowls, wagging his tail, and being pet for his good work. I bet he felt so proud, I was so proud.

December 23rd 2020, We come to visit with our mom, he's still happy eating well getting along with Lolly and playing with her just like butterball and Rex used too. Steals her treat while we're here, and Lolly kind of shrugs it off, too old to care. Check the bumps. Holy ####. The one in the ear? Still a grape. The hindleg? It's the size of two baseballs side by side. You can SEE it sway side to side with each step he takes. When you feel the tumor, the veins between it and his skin bulge outward, pumping lots of blood into the tumor. He seems okay? Not in any pain. Doesn't seem to bother him. I think he'll be fine. Say goodbyes, Merry Christmas, cause I won't see them till after the holiday, right? Give my good boy a treat, so happy, I take my leave.

December 24th, Wake up the next morning. Phonecall. Grandma? Hello?
What?

Rush to Grandma and Papas.

Burst through the door, nearly knocking the door off it's hinges, no joke. Where is he? ""He's out back!"" My grandma exclaims.

Get out the back door.

Turn left.

There he is.

Laying in his dog bed.

He's so happy to see me. Tail wags.

Then I look down.

Early in the morning around 3 or 4, he was sleeping inside, my Grandparents usually wake up at random hours of the night, and sometimes they'll let the dogs out. It's my Papa who lets them out this time. Doesn't notice anything unusual. Lets them in, goes to the kitchen grabs a coffee, then turns around. Blood. Lots of blood. Tons. Buckets. Globs of the stuff. Trailing from the backdoor and into the living room. Living rooms got a huge puddle. Turns around and sees Rex his whole bottom half, Drenched in it.

Sometime that night, the tumor either really hurt his leg while he was sleeping, or was bothering him, and sunk his own teeth into it.

I crouch down low and approach Rex bawling my eyes out. He's got a rudimentary bandage around his hind leg. He licks some of the area to clean it a little better.
My grandma rushed out of bed and tied a bandage around the wound, disinfected it, and even bathed him.
Then they set his bed outside with tons of blankets for support. He hasn't gotten up at all. I check his injury over, very bad.

Mom And Dad rush to Grandma's, they get there. Call vet. Emergency. Get him in. Get him in. Get him in. Dad grabs a piece of plywood. Shove it under Rex's bed. Rex stirs. No. Sit boy. It's okay. Lift him up and out to Moms Car. Fight back tears. Rush to Vet. Run two red lights. He'll be okay. 

Get to vet, unload, rush inside, taken away. Sit down. Wait. Cry. Wait. Cry. Wait. Tap my foot. Check my phone. Tap foot. Cry. Check the clock. 9:23. Tap foot. Look around. Mom sitting. Dad standing. Grandma and Papa holding each other. E on floor. Matt sitting. Wait. Cry. Tap foot.

Door opens, they call us back to the room he's in. Walk inside. He's on the floor. He didn't want to be on the bed. Nothing they can do? Bull####. He's gonna be okay. Nurse starts speaking. Save him. Lost too much blood. Save him. Condition declining fast. Save him. Euthanasia. Sit on floor. E and M pet Rex. Nurse leaves. Tap foot. Wait. Check clock. 9:29. Wait. Tap foot. Cry. Doctor comes back. Needle and IV in hand. Plugs it into his thigh. I don't want to say goodbye. Say your last goodbyes. I dont want to say goodbye. E hugs Rex. I dont want to say goodbye. M hugs Rex. I dont want to say goodbye. Mom, Dad, Grandma, and Papa pet Rex and say goodbye. Why do I have to say goodbye. Hug Rex and hold onto him. The nurse squeezes the needle.
I don't want him to go. There was so much I wanted to do. So much you should've seen. So much you could've tasted. So many new smells you could've sensed. His breathing comes to a halt, his eyes close as I stare into them for the last time. 

Wake up Christmas December 25th 2020, 8:30. Shuffle through gifts and presents. Cry. Hot coco? Cry. Christmas games? Cry. Christmas dinner. Eat. Cry. Go to bed. Cry myself to sleep.

Dear Rex, When you first came into my life, I was a small child, as were you. You brightened my worst days. And made. The bright ones even brighter. You brought Me and my family a happiness I know I will never again get back. You were the best Damn Dog I've ever had and met. So happy, so full of life, you had such a great personality. I'm not religious, but I do hope that wherever or whoever you are with, you stay happy and loved, as much as we loved you here, and you got to see and smell everything you missed. There is not a Christmas or any day that goes by where you are not on my mind, or a memory I play on repeat. You were such a good Boy, and I really miss you. 

This story was hard to write. I spend a lot of time thinking about memories and what they mean to me, and this was something I wished to write about for a while. I hope whoever reads this finds this a story worth their time. By the time of writing this it's about to be New years 2025. Happy New Year.

1hpkiiw,https://www.reddit.com/r/CreditCardsIndia/comments/1hpkiiw/encalm_lounge_at_hyderabad_airport_is_the_most/,Encalm lounge at Hyderabad airport is the most successful restaurant,"These are some pics of the Encalm lounge near gate 11 around 4pm on 13th December.

At roughly 10$ per person, the lounge is raking in money. Great business.

There were 4-5 queues of people trying to get in through one of the several cards in their wallet. Several people were seen arguing and producing one card after another to get in leading to long wait times. There were also two self-service machines to enter the lounge on both sides. Roughly about 60-70 people standing outside when I arrived.

Luckily, the Priority Pass line was separate and empty and I was able to get in after one line jumper who failed to get in after producing 4 different cards.

The situation inside was more akin to a busy railway platform than anything related to the words ""Encalm"" or ""Lounge"". Very very noisy. Kids screaming, people watching videos on their mobiles w/o headphones, talking loudly on their phones, etc.

People were filling up their plates with everything and sadly wasting a lot of food everywhere. :-( Given the time, I was surprised people were even this hungry. Tables were being shared between 2-3 sets of travelers similar to a roadside Thali place.

To top this all, I had someone from the lounge service staff come up to me and ask for feedback. I don't think she pressed submit on the form after I filled out the evaluation. :-D

I left after 20 mins - after grabbing a bottle of water and not wishing to stand in line for coffee and made my way to a restaurant upstairs where I could read in peace.

If this is after CC devaluations, I am scared to know what happened before. Going to stick to a quiet restaurant from now on. They should just rename it to `Encalm Thali` or something and remove the ""Lounge"" from the name.

1hpkgja,https://www.reddit.com/r/Diamondsreview/comments/1hpkgja/g_color_diamonds_expert_tips_and_complete_value/,G Color Diamonds: Expert Tips and Complete Value Analysis,"# Key Notes and Bottom Line

G color diamonds offer an excellent balance of quality and value, appearing colorless to the naked eye while costing significantly less than D-F diamonds. They're ideal for savvy shoppers seeking a beautiful diamond without overpaying.

# Bottom Line:

* G color is the at the top of the ""near colorless"" range (G-J)
* Visually indistinguishable from colorless diamonds in most settings
* Price difference: A 1.00 carat G VS1 diamond costs $4,460 while a similar D color diamond costs $6,040, a 35% price difference
* G color diamonds are excellent choice for maximizing beauty and budget
* The average price of a 1.00 carat G color diamond is $5,507
* Alternatively, you can save significantly more if you choose a lower near colorless grade. For example, the average price of a 1.00 carat I color diamond is $3,745, approximately 32% price difference.
* Lab-grown diamonds offer significant cost savings compared to natural diamonds. A 2.00 carat G color with VVS1 clarity natural diamond is sold for $25,240 while a similar lab-grown diamond is sold for $2,900, an 88% difference!
* **Recommended Vendors**: For a reliable buying experience, consider purchasing [from trusted retailers such as those](https://labdiamondsreview.com/diamonds/) that provide comprehensive grading reports and advanced visualization tools to assist in selecting the perfect stone.

# Who is this for?

* Budget-conscious shoppers who want a visually colorless diamond
* Those prioritizing cut quality and overall appearance over technical color grades
* Buyers looking for the best value in white diamonds

# Who is this not for?

* Collectors or buyers insisting on only the highest color grades
* Those extremely sensitive to slight color differences
* Shoppers with unlimited budgets who prefer D-F colors

# Pros and Cons

Pros:

* Appears colorless in most settings
* Significant savings compared to D-F diamonds
* Versatile for various jewelry styles

Cons:

* Slight color may be visible in larger stones or certain cuts
* Not as rare or valuable as D-F diamonds

# Recommendations for Smart Buying:

1. Prioritize cut quality - an excellent cut can make a G color diamond look whiter
2. Consider round brilliant cuts, which hide color better than other shapes
3. Choose white metal settings (platinum, white gold) to enhance colorless appearance
4. Compare G diamonds to F and H to find the best value for your eye
5. For larger stones (2+ carats), consider moving up to F color if budget allows

# FAQ

Q: Can I see the difference between G and D-F colors?

A: In most cases, no. The difference is minimal and usually undetectable without specialized equipment.

Q: Are G color diamonds good for engagement rings?

A: Yes, they're an excellent choice, offering a colorless appearance at a better value than D-F diamonds.

Q: How does a G color look in yellow gold?

A: While G colors look best in white metals, they can still appear beautiful in yellow gold, especially with smaller stones.

Q: Is the price difference between G and H significant?

A: There's about a 15% price difference, but visually, they're very similar. H can offer even better value if you're not color-sensitive.

Remember, while color is important, cut quality has the biggest impact on a diamond's beauty. A well-cut G color diamond can outshine a poorly cut D color stone. Focus on overall appearance and value rather than just the color grade.

1hpkcap,https://www.reddit.com/r/Marriage/comments/1hpkcap/am_i_overreacting/,Am I overreacting? ,"For people who are happily married, I beg you to help me out here. I do not know if I am actually crazy or I am just stupid or perhaps both. 

My husband's parents came to visit from another country in Europe for three weeks, they are staying with us. I never had a great relationship with them, it is ok. I respect them and that's that. From the moment they wake up they are sitting in front of the sofa watching TV. If I go to the kitchen to do my own thing my MIL in law comes to see what I am doing. I was doing some stuff on my pc and she sneaked from behind to see what I was doing. Every morning I ask them if they want to have a coffee and I make them fresh coffee and bring them to the table right in front of them. FIL eats chips in front of the tv and makes an absolute mess, so I go even morning cleaning after them whilst they go out on their morning walk for 30min. They come back and they carry on watching tv, chilling and making more mess i.e crisps pan the carpet and.not cleaning after himself. Everyday, I just clean after them.   
Husband comes from work and he takes them out, and my FIL is asking me what will be for dinner as in what I am cooking. I feel like the maid in my own house. 

They do not even take the trash out when they see the trash bin is full. They do not even remember to dust around or use the vacuum cleaner to clean after themselves. FIL is nit picking on pretty much everything. I have had some orders come in and he commented 'WOW, you are spending so much money, you won't save anything' my husband stood there and smiled when his father said this to me. I said back to my FIL to worry about himself not about what I do with my own money. I am good at maligning my own money having worked in finance.   
I wash their clothes and when I put them on the line, my MIL only picks their clothes and leaves ours still outside on the line despite the fact they are dry. 

I asked them politely not to cook a certain type of meat as I do not like the specific food, he is nit picking of that. Husband does not say anything to them. In my husband's mind I am overreacting. 

This morning I told them their coffee is ready and to come and get it from the kitchen. They didn't and it clicked in my head they treat me indeed like the maid. FIL asked me again, what will he have for dinner. I said I don't know, ask your son. I am going out for the rest of the day. MIL turns and says ohhh, great in a very rude way as if I have been out on her way all the time. 

My husband says to me I am always overreacting, am I tho? Am I really crazy? I asked him to book them a hotel for several days, but my husband doesn't want to and he told me they came here to spend time with us. Whenever I bring up an issue, my husband tells me I am trying to create an argument. 

He never listens to me, if I tell him something he doesn't believe me. For example his mother stole a book from our home last time when I was packing our old home and she came to help me. It was my own book, I had it for ages as it was a very dear book to me. I knew she took it because It was only me and her and I saw her reading the book. She didn't ask me to borrow the book or anything. My husband says his mum probably made a mistake and took it by mistake, which she didn't.  Whatever I say he never listens to me, his family are always joking, etc.  

Husband never wants to confront someone, they can tell me to go to hell he will just sit there and smile as long as there is peace and he doesn't create a fuss.   
I did not spot this in my husband before we got married. His brother had a go at me few months ago for something that I wanted to talk about and bear in mind, his brother put his voice so high at me and I replied back. I got annoyed and I increased my voice too, husband did not say anything to his brother, but he turned and said ""both of you, stop"".

We do not have kids yet, but I am thinking of just consulting with divorce attorney to see what my options are. I cannot do anything right and his family in his eyes are always right whatever they do or say. ",2,1735554150.0,Marriage,5,1.0,False
1hpkbg1,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskIreland/comments/1hpkbg1/why_dont_irish_men_ask_women_out_like_they_do_in/,Why don't Irish men ask women out like they do in other cultures?,"I'll preface by saying that I, a woman, know that I _should_ have the guts to make the first move but personally, I have a deep fear of rejection and need a guy to establish that he likes me before reciprocating. That aside, let's not focus on how in this day and age it shouldn't be left up to men (I agree that it shouldn't) but in general, Irish men aren't known to chat women  up unless they're drunk at the end of the night in Coppers or wherever. 
I'm interested to hear from men here... What's stopping you from asking someone out in a coffee shop or supermarket like other cultures are known to do? Is it also a general fear of rejection? 
Or are you a guy that does do that and what has been the response?
Just curious is all!
