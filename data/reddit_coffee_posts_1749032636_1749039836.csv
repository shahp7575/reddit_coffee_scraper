Work was a disaster from start to finish‚Äîmy boss gave me last-minute changes on a project, the printer jammed right before an important meeting, and I spilled coffee all over myself (ugh, classic!). By the time I got home, I was completely drained and, tbh, felt pretty defeated.

But then, out of the blue, my boyfriend knocked on my door. He brought over my favorite takeout‚Äîextra spring rolls, just how I like it‚Äîand suggested we have an impromptu picnic on my living room floor. We spread out an old blanket, lit a few candles, and just... talked. Nothing grand, nothing planned, just us sharing stories, laughs, even the not-so-great parts of our day.

It felt like the weight of everything just lifted. Honestly, just having him there, spending quality time together, made everything seem a bit less overwhelming. We didn't need to talk about the tough stuff the whole time; just being together was its own kind of comfort. I guess it's true what they say‚Äîsometimes it's the simple moments that matter the most. üòä‚ú®",1,1749039683.0,fiveWaysOfLove,0,1.0,False

At one of my projects we were nearing completion of an office renovation and the tenants had moved in while we‚Äôre were still finishing up (mounting devices like light switches or computer outlets under desks) during our last couple days there. 

We would take a coffee break at 9:30am and return at 9:45am and the office staff would take theirs at 10am. One day, my journeyman and I cam back from coffee and returned to our spots under desks wiring in the outlets. Soon after, we heard the elevator doors open and a few women returned from their coffee break. We were under desks, so they didn‚Äôt see anyone in the room. One of the women had apparently been telling the others about some guy she had met at the bar on the weekend. 

I was going to indicate our presence to them since the details of the event we‚Äôre getting quite sexual but I looked over at my journeyman under a desk across from me and he was frantically indicating with his hands I should not say a word so he could hear what she had to say to her coworkers. 

So we stayed hidden under our desks as she gave every sordid detail about how she gave the guy a blowjob in his car. She described its shape, length, how it felt in her hands‚Ä¶ how he responded to her touch, and the sounds he made when she gave him an earth shattering orgasm. 

One of her coworkers asked ‚ÄúDo you think he‚Äôll call you?‚Äù and before she could respond all you heard from under a desk was my journeyman‚Äôs voice casually saying ‚ÄúI sure would‚Äù.

# Chapter 1

""Ms. Sampson, this is your fake death plan. Do you want to 'fall off a cliff and die' on the day of the global wedding live broadcast in half a month?""

""Yes.""

The staff solemnly said, ""If you fake your death during the live broadcast, you will never be able to restore your current identity.""

Julissa Sampson clenched the proposal in her hand and nodded heavily.

""Yes, I am sure.""

Leaving the building, Julissa came face to face with the giant screen in the commercial square, where Adonis Ferguson was hugging her and announcing their engagement in a video.

The man was handsome and wealthy, the woman was graceful and beautiful, even the passing vehicles were attracted by this scene, and they slowed down one after another.

In the video, Adonis held her tightly. He was always decisive, but at that moment his eyes were red-rimmed and his voice was trembling uncontrollably.

""Today was the most important day of my life, because Ms. Sampson accepted my proposal. Here, I solemnly invite everyone to join us for the live global broadcast of our wedding next month...""

The barrage on the big screen was rolling rapidly.

It is said that he fell in love with Julissa at first sight when he was nineteen years old;

At the age of twenty, she chose to start a business in order to live up to her family background.

At the age of twenty-two, he flew over two hundred times in one year to see his overseas study partner Julissa.

""Man's love brain is actually the best 'bonus point'!""

Glancing at the barrage of comments, Julissa's eyes were full of mockery. She lowered her head and brightened the screen of her phone, looking again at the chat screenshots on her phone.

In the top photo, a strange woman seductively looked at the camera with her eyes like silk, her skirt lifted high, revealing a swollen red buttocks.

""Adonis, you really hurt my butt yesterday! You have half an hour to come over and give me a massage, or else I'll cry, the kind that can't be comforted!""

And Adonis below almost instantly replied, ""Wait for me.""

\*\*\*

The whole world envied her for finding a good man, and everyone said how much Adonis loved her.

Only she knew that Adonis had been keeping a female college student outside for two whole years.

Tears blurred Julissa's vision, and she felt a bit dazed.

When she was nineteen, her parents passed away. As she cried until she almost fainted, Adonis held her in his arms and swore to her deceased parents that he would take care of her in the future.

He once had his leg broken by a huge rock to protect her, and once because of her love for food, he flew all over Cuskeoland.

She knew all his bank passwords and phone passwords, and every profile picture on his social media platforms was her...

Even on the day of the proposal, Adonis cried and said that he could never live without her in his life, and asked her to swear that she would marry him for eternity.

He was such a man who, while saying he couldn't live without her, went to see another woman for an affair on the night he proposed.

Thinking about the scene she saw the night she was proposed to, Julissa closed her eyes in despair.

Since he betrayed so thoroughly, don't blame her for breaking her vow.

She had to fake her death in front of everyone, completely erase all traces of ""Julissa,"" and disappear forever from his side.

Julissa wiped away her tears and was about to stand up when suddenly her shoulder sank.

A tall figure bent down to help her up, carefully wrapping her in his arms.

""Julissa, didn't I ask you to wait obediently for me to go choose the engagement ring together? Why did you come out on your own and squat by the roadside?""

Seeing the tears on her face, Adonis's tone carried a hint of anxiety.

""Why are you crying? Did you get hurt somewhere?""

Julissa did not answer, she just looked at him quietly.

The anxiety and concern on his face did not seem fake, but the fresh scent of citrus perfume indicated that he had been in close contact with that woman.

She turned her head to avoid the scent of perfume on him, lowered her eyes to conceal the fleeting disgust that passed through her.

If just seeing her tears made him so flustered, she wondered what his reaction would be when he watched her die at the wedding.

After a long time, until Adonis checked her up and down to make sure she was not injured, Julissa spoke faintly, ""Aunt Flo is here, my stomach hurts.""

# Chapter 2

Adonis's hand paused, his tone a bit stiff.

""Sorry Julissa, I have been too busy lately and forgot that you were on your period. We are almost back to the car, and there is a blanket in the car!""

Julissa silently followed him back to the car, letting Adonis wrap her up in a blanket.

In the past, he always remembered her menstrual period even more clearly than she did herself, but in just a few short months, everything changed.

The smell of citrus perfume filled the car, and she inexplicably thought of the photo taken in the car some time ago.

The woman leaned against the car window, her whole body disheveled, while Adonis beside her had a smile of horror on his face.

\*\*\*

The driver parked the car in front of the jewelry store, but Adonis remained silent for a long time.

Julissa turned her head slightly and caught sight of Adonis's lips curling up high, as well as the cute cat avatar on the phone screen.

Noticing her gaze, he quickly turned off his phone, reached out to rub her head, and handed her a black gold card, saying, ""Julissa, the company has some temporary issues, so you go to the jewelry store first, and I'll come back to pick you up later.""

Julissa got out of the car in silence.

She had barely stood firm when Adonis directed the driver to turn the car around, and in less than three seconds, he disappeared from her sight.

The jewelry store clerk approached eagerly, ""Ms. Sampson, Mr. Ferguson had the designer create 34 different styles for you to choose from!""

Turning her gaze away, Julissa shook her head at the store clerk, saying, ""Don't bother looking, just pick one for me.""

After all, she was going to ""commit suicide"" at her own wedding, and a dead bride would not have the chance to wear a wedding ring.

\*\*\*

Julissa did not listen to Adonis's advice and, after casually choosing a diamond ring, she went home alone.

The first thing she did when she got home was to grind a cup of coffee - she had been suffering from insomnia for over ten days, relying on coffee to keep herself awake every day.

A message suddenly popped up on the phone, and Julissa's hand holding the coffee shook violently.

The scalding hot coffee splashed all over her chest, but she didn't even notice, just staring fixedly at the screen.

Selina Greene texted her again, this time with a video.

The video was blurry, and only the bodies intertwined could be vaguely seen, but the conversation in it was incredibly clear.

Selina gasped, out of breath, ""Adonis... is my butt perky or... is her butt perky?""

A familiar voice murmured hoarsely, ""You are sexier than her.""

Later, a bony hand forcefully twisted a woman's buttocks.

The hand even wore a gemstone ring personally designed for him by Julissa.

Julissa was trembling all over, and she almost had to use all her strength to turn off the screen.

She forced herself to shift her focus, flipping through the documents and new identity provided by the fake death organization. From dawn until dusk, she had not received any messages from Adonis. Just as she was about to go to sleep, her text message alert suddenly sounded.

She lowered her head to look, but it was a series of photos sent by Selina.

The first picture is a profile of Adonis sleeping, followed by several selfies of Selina.

The snow-white body was covered with congested love bites.

""Adonis said he wanted to leave his marks all over my body, otherwise he wouldn't let me go...""

""Julissa, was his need for you so strong?""

Julissa looked unusually calm.

For the next seven hours, she did nothing.

She just stared at the phone screen, ""until the sky was getting light.""

When Adonis came back, he saw Julissa, with red eyes, curled up on the sofa, her hands tightly gripping the phone and trembling slightly.

He was surprised and quickly stepped forward to embrace Julissa in his arms, ""Julissa, why are your eyes so red? Have you been crying?""

Julissa turned off her phone and rubbed her eyes haphazardly.

Looking at Adonis's disheveled appearance, she tugged at the corner of her mouth, revealing a smile that didn't reach her eyes.

""It's nothing, I just had a nightmare just now.""

# Chapter 3

Adonis's tense body relaxed, he rubbed her head, and bent down to give her a gentle kiss on her forehead.

""The baby doesn't need to be afraid of nightmares, the husband is back, the husband will protect you!""

Seeing Julissa in a daze, Adonis softened and kissed her deeply twice, full of remorse.

""Julissa, yesterday I left you alone in the jewelry store, I was wrong, tomorrow I will take you to buy a few estates to compensate you, okay?""

Julissa still did not speak, but he took it as acquiescence, carried her back to the bedroom, tucked her in, and stayed by her side studying the property locations all night.

The next afternoon, Adonis personally did her hair and poured a full pot of milk for her, then took her to the real estate company.

The real estate agent showed the couple around various estate models, and whenever Julissa took a second look, Adonis would not hesitate to have the agent book it, even though she was actually not interested in these properties.

During the downtime of the paperwork, the real estate agent took them to the golf course behind the company.

On the field, several bosses who had worked with the Ferguson Group gathered around to joke about Adonis's deeds when they heard about it.

""Mr. Ferguson really spared no expense for his beauty, several vacation estates I had picked out for my wife were all taken away!""

""Mr. Ferguson, can I have that vacation estate? Next time we work together, I can give you a profit share?""

Adonis carefully poured a glass of milk and handed it to Julissa, ""What happens in our house is not up to me, only Julissa's approval matters.""

Julissa pretended not to hear, gently pushing away the milk in his hand, ""I'm not thirsty.""

Seeing the situation, Jaron knew it was hopeless, and he returned to his place dejectedly.

""Wanna play golf? I'll accompany you!"" Adonis smiled gently, lightly holding her hand.

Julissa was just about to refuse when there was a commotion coming from the adjacent Jaron's serving station.

A girl screamed and fell to the ground, while Jaron slammed and hit the ground with a club, cursing angrily, ""Isn't being a part-time caddy just for people to sleep with? How dare you push me, watch me beat you to death today!""

Adonis looked over to the next door and suddenly froze.

Julissa followed his gaze and saw a face that had appeared countless times on her phone screen, now appearing in front of her.

Selina wore a pure white sporty skirt suit today. She, full of youthful energy, sat at Jaron's feet, like a clean and delicate little white flower.

As Jaron's swearing became increasingly vulgar, Selina began to sob, casting pleading looks towards Adonis.

Julissa had just about to avert her gaze when she felt a light touch on her hand.

Adonis let go of her hand.

His pace quickened with anxiety, ""Julissa, it seems like my friend has run into some trouble. Wait for me here.""

Without waiting for her answer, he strode quickly to the adjacent serving table.

Adonis negotiated with great tact, but throughout, his gaze was nervously fixed on Selina's injured leg, without once looking back at her.

Selina left, and he quickly returned to her side, but she still sensed something unusual from his tense tone.

""It was just a misunderstanding. I handed over our vacation estate to Jaron, just to make amends...""

Julissa paused, nodded gently.

The next second, Adonis glanced down at his phone, discreetly turned the screen away from her view, and then kissed Julissa's forehead.

""Julissa, there was a problem with the paperwork for the house, I went to talk to them.""

With that, he turned around and left without looking back.

Julissa watched Adonis leave in silence, not releasing her tightly clenched hand until she could no longer see his back.

Her long manicured nails were deeply embedded in the flesh, her palm already a bloody mess. But she seemed oblivious, staring fixedly at the messages on her phone screen.

""Adonis, he insisted on being in the bathroom with me, saying it's more exciting this way...""

She sat still for a long time, then got up and walked to the bathroom.

\*\*\*

The lights were dim, and the doors of each cubicle in the bathroom were wide open, except for the one closest to the inside.

The sound of the collision echoed throughout the corridor.

The further she went in, the low gasps of women and men mixed together rushed into Julissa's ears.

After a loud ""thud"", the compartment was filled with increasingly intense banging sounds.

The man's low growl became more pronounced.

The man's voice was so familiar, so familiar that Julissa didn't need to see for herself to know who it was.

She desperately covered her mouth, suppressing her sobs.

# Chapter 4

A muffled groan was heard, and the sound of impact in the compartment ceased.

The sizzling sound of kisses continued.

Julissa couldn't take it anymore and ran out, covering her mouth and stumbling.

She avoided all places where she might run into people, and desperately ran in the opposite direction of the bathroom, hiding behind the sofa in the coffee room.

She gasped heavily, tears streaming down like a broken dam.

She thought she had become numb long ago after seeing those photos and videos.

She could feel the pain even more acutely when she bumped into it face to face, and she was on the verge of fainting.

She couldn't help but think of her intimate moments with Adonis.

The frequency between them was not high, but every time he was with her, he was gentle and tender. Whenever she cried out in pain, he would stop, no matter how uncomfortable he was.

Even when she actively wanted to play more boldly, he refused, saying it would make her too tired.

She originally thought she had found someone who would truly hold her in the palm of their hand and protect her.

But now it seems that he probably found being with her not exciting enough, and wanted to find someone who could arouse his desires more.

Her hands tightly covered her face, tears streaming continuously through her fingers.

Adonis called, she silenced the phone and let the incoming call notification light up the screen.

Almost at the same time, Selina's message popped up again.

""Adonis was so fierce this time, did we scare our sister? But it's all my fault. Who asked him to just save me and give that vacation villa to Jaron as a favor... And also, this ring, Adonis said he gave it to me!""

At a glance, Julissa recognized that the ring in the photo was the same one Adonis was wearing.

The diamond on this ring is a rare sapphire that Julissa searched for three months to find, and the ring setting with the embedded gemstone is hammered into shape by her own hands with a small hammer. In order to carve the patterns on it, she suffered a permanent waist injury.

The ring, which she had polished for half a year, is now worn on Selina's hand.

Closing her eyes, Julissa turned off her phone.

She applied ice cubes to her slightly swollen eyes, and then used an eyeliner pencil to redraw the eyeliner that had already smudged.

When she finished her makeup and walked out the door, she ran into Adonis who was calling her name.

Adonis pulled her into his arms and said with a tense voice, ""I have been looking for you after completing the property transfer procedures, why are you running around everywhere!""

Julissa took a deep breath, the scent of citrus filling her nostrils. She looked into his eyes and struggled to suppress the lump in her throat.

""Have the procedures been completed? Perfect timing, I was planning to go on vacation next week, I want to stay in that holiday villa.""

His eyes flickered, and he looked around before saying, ""We are getting married soon, why go there? Julissa, stop acting like a child and thinking one thing after another.""

Upon hearing this, Julissa raised her lips and glanced over Adonis's fingers, the ring was indeed missing.

In the past, not to mention next week, even if she wanted to go to a certain city that afternoon, Adonis could take her there immediately. He always said she was lovely, full of tricks and ideas.

Now there was another woman, and in his eyes, her thoughts had all become immature.

She looked at Adonis with tears in her eyes.

From the age of nineteen until now, she only just realized that he is such a hypocritical person.

Looking at Julissa's expression, Adonis felt a hint of panic and pity in his eyes. He gently rubbed her head and said, ""If you want me to go with you, it's fine. It doesn't matter where we stay. I'll book the presidential suite at the Hilton in advance for you, so you can stay comfortably...""

Julissa's tears fell uncontrollably, with a self-deprecating smile hanging at the corner of her mouth.

This man not only double standards, but also doesn't need to take notes when lying.

Adonis anxiously reached out to wipe away Julissa's tears, but suddenly a voice sounded in his ear.

""Mr. Ferguson, I wanted to come specially to thank you for your help...""

Selina was still dressed in a simple white sportswear, looking pitiful and fragile.

Adonis stiffened suddenly, then casually waved his hand, ""You're welcome, it's nothing.""

He wanted to continue helping Julissa wipe away her tears, but she pushed him away and said, ""I have something to do, I'm leaving.""

""Julissa!""

He instinctively wanted to chase after her, but Selina just climbed onto his arm.

After a moment of distraction, Julissa disappeared around the corner.

Adonis turned pale and abruptly let go of Selina's hand, ""How many times have I told you not to appear in the same place as Julissa at the same time?! If she finds out, be careful, I'll kill you!""

Selina stood still, her face turning pale and then white. This was the first time in two years that she had seen him look at her with such a fierce and unforgiving expression, showing no trace of the past affection.

She bit her lip unwillingly, and the next second she immediately coquettishly said with tears in her eyes, ""I just wanted to work part-time at the stadium to buy you a gift, I didn't expect to run into you. And she didn't seem to notice, did she?""

""In order to buy you a birthday gift, I did all kinds of part-time jobs every day, my legs were bruised...""

Tears in her eyes gradually turned into sobs, she cried uncontrollably, and directly squatted on the ground. Her collar was pulled down by him, exposing her white chest with most of it exposed as she squatted down, covered with kiss marks.

Upon hearing her sincere words and seeing this scene, Adonis' eyes darkened and his throat kept rolling uncontrollably.

He could no longer bear it, so he bent down and picked her up with a horizontal lift...

# Chapter 5

Adonis didn't come back all night, only sending a message saying ""there was something to work overtime at the company.""

Julissa knew he was lying, but she didn't ask him, let alone cry and make a scene, just buried herself in her own affairs.

Since she had decided to fake her own death and leave him, she was determined to cover all her tracks.

After the wedding, he never found anything related to her again except for a corpse.

She first packed away the infrequently used items, and then sent them along with her personal valuables to the fake death company. After all, the secure and proper storage of personal belongings is also part of the fake death service.

Finally, she took out a large jewelry box from the safe on the dressing table.

She was a jewelry designer, and her most satisfying works, apart from the award-winning pieces, were all in this box.

Inside were the couple accessories she designed on every anniversary since they met, belonging only to her and Adonis.

Couples' engagement rings, couples' watches, couples' necklaces, and couples' brooches, each adorned with diamonds and jewels, are priceless.

Adonis would open it every now and then to admire it for a long time, touching it over and over again,¬†",1,1749039051.0,NovelNexus,0,1.0,False

You know, that annoying voice in the back of your head telling you that you don't really deserve your accomplishments.

Here's the deal: every night before bed, I jot down three things I genuinely appreciate about myself or my day. Just three quick bullet points‚Äîlike, ""nailed that project presentation"" or ""had a great chat with my friend over coffee"". I keep it simple, but specific. The key part is connecting each thing back to something I did or something about me.

I've noticed that acknowledging even these small wins makes the ""I'm not good enough"" feelings sorta fade... just a bit every time.

1l33w5r,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/1l33w5r/im_24m_having_trouble_getting_over_my_24f_gfs/,I‚Äôm [24M] having trouble getting over my [24F] gf‚Äôs past mistakes now that she‚Äôs gotten on meds,"I‚Äôll try and make this short:

tl;dr: we‚Äôve been dating for two years, much of which she spent emotionally cheating on me with two people. she got on meds and is now better than ever but I am still reeling and I haven‚Äôt gotten over it, and it severely bothers me on a daily basis. can I cope or would it be best if I just leave?

My girlfriend [24F] did lots of bad things which I ended up trying to forgive because of her mental illness. We‚Äôve been dating since June of 2023. 

Twice, she emotionally cheated on me. The first was with someone she used to fuck before we met, John, but who ghosted her and left her hurt. Her rationale for this was that she didn‚Äôt understand why he ‚Äúcame back.‚Äù It became an obsession that I just had to live with because no amount of protesting fixed it. She never met up with him but she‚Äôd go out of her way to flirt with him over text - and being a ‚Äúwitchy type‚Äù believed that he was stalking her. He streamed on Twitch. So naturally, she stalked him and drove to his house on a couple of occasions to see what car he drove. That ended after six months of begging because of particularly bad temper flare-up on my part. 

The second time, someone came into her job at Starbucks who worked at the adjacent barbershop. Moe is a married man who ‚Äúhad the ability to make her feel beautiful, even when she was at her worst‚Äù (covered in coffee at Starbucks. 

I found out about Moe while she joined me on vacation with my family. She was waiting for an important call while she showered and asked me to mind her cell phone. I did, and she got a text from him. Spare me the moral discussion and outrage of doing this, but I read the messages, and the entire night prior, and for days leading up to her joining my family on vacation, she was having very clear ‚Äúgetting to know someone you want to fuck‚Äù conversation with Moe, including telling him that she was going on vacation with *her* family, lying about being in a relationship (birds of a feather on that count). I sent her the 2.5 hrs home. Nothing physical happened in this instance either. It only came out he was married when his wife contacted her about 6 weeks later, when she found about his indiscretion. 

This was January - August of 24. In this time period, I was taking a gap year between grad school and law school, dealing with family bereavement stuff and working. Now I‚Äôm done with my first year. I basically spent all my free time with her. This was not a matter of neglect on my part. I enjoyed the good times, which there were, but these incidents existed as a horrible mental slog for me. It genuinely kept me up at night. To this day, being in her bedroom is a claustrophobic, anxiety inducing experience because of the things I had to grapple with - and the sleepless nights I had thinking about these things - within it. 

In the time between August 24 and today, a lot still has happened. We came to blows (mostly emotionally, but she got physical with me on one occasion) numerous times, basically starting in Oct/Nov and ending around March. The cheating stopped because, I assume, she realized being a homewrecker isn‚Äôt a good look. Her main justification, for both of them, was concern about reputation - she didn‚Äôt want to be deemed the ‚Äúcrazy girl‚Äù who can‚Äôt remain friends with guys - and my main counter to that was ‚Äúso to preserve yourself, you let me walk around with the cuckold title!?‚Äù 

But basically, in March, something internally within her snapped and after some intervention from a family member of hers she got put on Zoloft. The fighting hasn‚Äôt ended but the severity of her anger - at least towards me - has decreased. We had many conversations where we were blunt about this. She apologized, renounced all of it, and blocked anyone she was previously contacting. She is loving and doting towards me and only me in the way I always wanted and I am too emotionally damaged by her actions now to want or accept it.

I am in therapy now because, on top of working almost constantly, whether it‚Äôs on my academics, or getting a job, or working the one I already have, I am still extremely angry about all of this. Almost daily, I have intrusive thoughts that bring me to a complete stop and make me irrationally angry. And yet, the person I‚Äôm mad at isn‚Äôt really the person that‚Äôs in front of me. I‚Äôm trying to get past these feelings but I don‚Äôt think that I can without ending the relationship or taking a break. I‚Äôve discussed the lingering feelings with her - and her main stance is that she‚Äôs upset that the old saying that ‚Äútime heals all wounds‚Äù hasn‚Äôt worked here. And her attitude towards our relationship is so positive and forward looking where mine is stuck on her past actions. The bottom line is that I would never spend my life with someone who so routinely and regularly betrayed me. But because she wasn‚Äôt betrayed, and those actions are in the past, she doesn‚Äôt see that. So I‚Äôm just kind of left to seethe on what are basically moot points.

Is the only way to move past this to just end it once and for all?

# Before I Found Moringa Magic, I Thought Constant Fatigue Was Just ‚ÄúNormal.‚Äù

Let me paint you a picture of what life used to look like:

I‚Äôd wake up groggy, even after 8 hours of sleep. My mornings started with coffee, not out of joy, but pure survival.

Mid-day crashes were my regular; by evening, I had¬†*zero*¬†motivation to cook, exercise, or do anything productive.

Honestly, I thought I was just getting older‚Ä¶ or maybe burning out. But no matter how many self-care routines I tried, the¬†*energy*¬†just wasn‚Äôt there.

Then, a friend casually mentioned something called¬†**Moringa Magic**¬†, and my life took a surprisingly simple turn for the better.

# What Even Is Moringa Magic?

Moringa Magic is a supplement made from the Moringa Oleifera plant, known as the¬†**‚Äúmiracle tree‚Äù**¬†for a reason.

Packed with over¬†**90 nutrients**,¬†**46 antioxidants**, and¬†**all 9 essential amino acids**, this thing is¬†*loaded*¬†with goodness.

But what stood out to me?  
It‚Äôs 100% natural. No artificial nonsense. No sugar. No caffeine. Just pure, plant-based fuel for your body.

# Week 1: ‚ÄúWait‚Ä¶ Why Do I Feel So Clear?‚Äù

I started taking just¬†**one capsule a day**¬†with water in the morning. I didn‚Äôt expect fireworks, but within a few days, I noticed something weird:

* My mind felt clearer
* I wasn‚Äôt dragging myself through the afternoon
* I even¬†*forgot*¬†to have coffee one morning‚Ä¶ and didn‚Äôt crash!

For the first time, I felt like my body was working¬†*with*¬†me.

# Weeks 2 & 3: Energy, Digestion, and‚Ä¶ My Skin?

By the second week, I noticed that my¬†**digestion improved**¬†‚Äî no more bloating after meals or sluggish feelings in my stomach.

And surprisingly, my skin looked¬†*healthier*. Softer. Less irritated.

My daily routine didn‚Äôt change ‚Äî except that I added one small capsule.

Let me be clear: this wasn‚Äôt some overnight miracle. But the¬†*compounding effect*¬†of small improvements made a huge difference.

I had more energy, more focus, and I didn‚Äôt feel overwhelmed at the end of each day anymore.

*Give your body the nutrition it‚Äôs been waiting for.*

# Why I Think Moringa Magic Is Different

There are¬†*so many*¬†health supplements out there, and I‚Äôve tried my fair share. But Moringa Magic hit differently. Here‚Äôs why:

* **No crashes**¬†‚Äî unlike caffeine
* **No synthetic ingredients**¬†‚Äî just Moringa
* **Real, gentle results**¬†‚Äî not hype

It wasn‚Äôt trying to ‚Äúhack‚Äù my body. It was just giving my body what it was missing all along.

# The Power of One Simple Change

We spend so much time looking for big transformations‚Ä¶ diets, routines, complicated regimens. But what if one¬†*small change*¬†could start the shift?

For me,¬†**Moringa Magic**¬†was that shift.

I sleep better. I feel lighter. I don‚Äôt need three cups of coffee to survive the day. And when life gets hectic (which it does), my body can handle it better.

*Experience the difference. You‚Äôve got nothing to lose and everything to gain.*

# Final Thoughts: One Small Habit, One Big Difference

After 30 days with¬†**Moringa Magic**, I‚Äôve learned something important ‚Äî your energy, focus, and overall wellness aren‚Äôt just things you have to ‚Äúdeal with.‚Äù They‚Äôre signals. And when you give your body what it‚Äôs craving, the shift is real.

No more relying on caffeine. No more dragging through the day. No more wondering¬†*‚ÄúIs this just how it is now?‚Äù*

This one small habit changed how I feel every single day.

I've been having a random problem for probably 6 or 7 months that has turned into an almost daily issue. The right side of my head (around the temple and ear area) feels like...well, the best way I can describe it is someone put a 120 watt bulb in a lamp, took off the shade and is holding it a half an inch from my skin. It doesn't necessarily feel warm to the touch but it feels like it's *on fire* otherwise. I sleep on my couch and have to run a fan on my coffee table pointed at my temple area just to offset the ""heat."" On top of that, I'll get random throbbing, pulsating pains in my temple that last anywhere between a few minutes and an hour or two, again, only on the right side of my head.

I also just noticed my right ear is noticeably red, while my left ear looks normal. I'm not sure if that's related, but it seems like too much of a coincidence not to be. As I said, it's not really much warmer to the touch than my left side, but it *feels* likes someone is pointing a heat gun to my temple and ear.

Frankly, it's scaring me, but I keep trying to tell myself if it was something super serious, it would have escalated by now, so I don't want to be the person that runs to the ER over something that might be silly and pointless.

1l33t0j,https://www.reddit.com/r/Marriage/comments/1l33t0j/men_vs_women_sex_and_intimacy/,Men vs Women Sex and Intimacy,"(OP Below)
I really like the first half of this post but I seriously don‚Äôt understand, why is this so one sided? Everything in the first half the man should do is stated as facts ‚Äúthis is what needs to be done‚Äù but the second half for the girls stuff to change everything is ‚Äúmaybe they could try this.‚Äù How is this not an equal problem? If women have to be treated a certain way, why should men not be too? If it‚Äôs understood on a teachable level that women need emotional connection and communication to have sex why isn‚Äôt it explained to the women men are just sex machines? To make us feel more calm and connected to you to be able to communicate we need to have a sexual connection first . Again I really like the first half, I just don‚Äôt understand the heavy lean to change men first. Like there‚Äôs nothing the women could do? No post ever tells the women to be the bigger person and change first but yours explicitly tells the male to be the bigger person. I don‚Äôt understand that if we are all supposed to be equals.

===============================

This is very common in long marriages. Sometimes a woman stops desiring sex because she feels mundane, ignored, and has lost the desire for sex because there is no longer any foreplay or pursuance.

Men stop ‚Äúchasing‚Äù their wives. They stop calling them beautiful, stop taking them on dates and stop giving them attention- but still expect there to be innate sexual desire. That‚Äôs not how most women‚Äôs sex drive works, it‚Äôs emotionally tied- not a raging instinct. You need to ask: what did I do today to turn my wife on? To make her feel secure and feel desired? Nothing? Did I even show her I loved her today, or this week- at all?

Also, acting overly sexual or loving for seemingly no reason, out of the blue one day to pressure her into sex isn‚Äôt going to work either. You have to slowly reignite the romance and trust, not because you want to get sex but because you want her to feel treasured and special. That is the only way to get back any semblance of how it ‚Äúused to be.‚Äù The desire slowly died away so the desire needs to slowly and naturally return. You have to change your heart‚Äôs desire from SEX to wanting to see her happy and loved, again.

Don‚Äôt pursue sex. Pursue love, tenderness, intimacy, attention, fondness, etc. The return of those things may help the sex return.

‚ÄúNo sex‚Äù is usually a symptom of a larger issue. And that larger issue is sometimes lack of closeness.

Men, when your women stop wanting sex, maybe show a little bit of introspection and ask yourself if maybe, after many years, you‚Äôve dropped the ball on keeping the love and her spirit alive.

‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî

*Edit: for the people asking ‚Äúew, why do the men have to put in all the work:‚Äù

1.	‚Å†The things above are things you should have been doing all along. It‚Äôs basic maintenance to keep a relationship healthy and another human being happy.
2.	‚Å†Thinking this way is contributing to something called The Cycle Of Pain. You feel hurt, so you don‚Äôt put in effort, and hurt her. She then feels hurt and so she doesn‚Äôt put in effort and hurts you. Round and round you go until you both spiral downward together. SOMEONE has to break this cycle, why not you?
3.	‚Å†I have a comment below listing the things women should be working on to help keep the relationship healthy, as well.

‚Äî‚Äî

**Edit: here is the below comment, because it‚Äôs getting hard to scroll and find it:

Okay: since everyone is asking, here is what can be talked about from the women‚Äôs side.

She may need less stress on her plate- and she may need to consider turning her time and energy inward to the relationship. If she has felt alone or unvalued for a long time, she may have put all her mental attention to other things to keep her going, like the children, or outside social circles, work or hobbies.

Re-honing her effort back into the husband will help her come back to him. Maybe opening up communication- telling him her needs and her hurts. She needs to maybe work on being short tempered or demeaning, as she probably developed this coping mechanism to deal with her growing frustration. This can be difficult, so she may need time to work on these.

It‚Äôs important for love to be a connection for both people. Perhaps she could suggest and plan some date ideas, or some get-away time for you both.

She needs to be able to open up and trust that he might be open to listen to her struggles and as to why sex isn‚Äôt appealing anymore. This can also be difficult after a long period of avoidance.

Together, the couple could open up about sexual taboos. What are they wanting in sex that they maybe never spoke about before due to shame or reluctance to talk about sexual needs? Don‚Äôt mock each other or become defensive. Have this convo alone and dedicate sit-down time for discussions over coffee or a meal at home, or when all the kids are gone/alseep.

She most likely needs to mentally decompress and become more vulnerable. Counseling can help with this. Maybe she has put up walls over the past few years, and she needs to honestly wipe the slate clean and really put effort into trusting her husband and letting him back into her life. She is probably afraid of being disappointed, shut out again, rushed or betrayed.

Most of the time disappointment is the failure of unspoken expectations. So maybe she can be open about what in the relationship is disappointing her. Sometimes expectations are too high, and when spoken out loud- one can realize they‚Äôre not realistic. We have to realize we can‚Äôt completely control or change someone else- especially men who dislike this at their core being. She might need to realize her coping mechanism of control is unhealthy for everyone around her. But sometimes the many small and very realistic expectations are dismissed. These little every day disappointments can make women feel like their partner is not putting in any daily effort. (Like not listening to small requests, not remembering small details, etc.)

‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî

TLDR: There is always work to be done on both sides, but my point stands that lack of sex is usually a symptom of larger issues. And sex doesn‚Äôt fix the relationship issues. Men just typically don‚Äôt realize there ARE issues until they notice the sex is gone.

The warmth filled my belly, a fleeting comfort, as I slumped back into the dusty red couch. Its fabric, faded and stained, threatened to tear with every shift of my weight. The walls around me peeled with age, threatening to uncover what lay dormant beneath the paint. Decay. It was a familiar, suffocating embrace. My tongue bit between my teeth in concentration. My fingers danced across the worn controller, a blur of motion against the backdrop of a flickering television screen. Dust motes swirled around the air, glowing in the early morning sunbeams that pierced the grimy windowpanes. I drew in a deep breath, the air a thick with a tang of mold and mildew, and something else too ‚Äì the pungent sweetness of stale blood, an echo of the night prior.

""Finish Him!"" crackled from the television‚Äôs shot speakers, breaking the silence.

Squealing in excitement, I mashed the buttons harder. ""Down, forward, back, B!"" I hissed under my breath.

I watched as Mileena removed her mask to reveal a horrific, fanged mouth, then devoured her opponent whole, spitting out his skeletal remains. ""Fatality!"" rang out into the dead air. I rocketed up, reeling in my victory. In my excitement, I failed to remember the chord tethering the controller to the console, tearing it from the wall, replacing the image with a roar of static.

""Fuck me.""

Groaning, I shoved Nathan out of the way and stumbled towards the television, switching it off. I spun on my heels to face him, my fists planted on my hips in triumph. 

""And the student becomes the master.""

Nathan, slumped against the couch, offering only a blank, unblinking stare. Not a word. My forced smile faded, and my eyes narrowed. ""Well fine, if you're gonna be that way!"" I plopped back onto the worn cushion beside him, his head bouncing dramatically with the sudden force of my impact. I shot him one last aggrieved glance, the dull ache of my own hunger beginning to throb behind my eyes. I leaned over, my gaze fixed on the already blood-soaked expanse of his neck. His flesh still held a deceptive softness. I sank my teeth in, a familiar, desperate urge driving me. I felt the sickening pop of his tendons giving way. Blood, thick and metallic, rushed into my mouth, a dark tide of sustenance. As it began to run down my throat, I suddenly recoiled back in disgust, a wave of revulsion washing over me. I spat his already cool and clotting blood onto the stained carpet, the dark crimson blooming against the faded floral pattern. 

""Goddammit, it‚Äôs already cold."" I muttered, wiping the sticky red stains from my chin with the back of my hand.

Leaning back, I rested my head on his shoulder. It was stiff, cool, almost waxy to the touch. My eyes drifted towards the arched window behind us, watching as the morning sun climbed higher in the sky, its golden rays making the dewy grass outside sparkle with an almost mocking brilliance. It had been hours since I had killed him. The sun had barely set the night before when my fangs had first pierced his skin. Still, a foolish, desperate part of me had hoped the warm summer night might have kept him more pliable. His head slumped further, coming to rest on mine, breaking my daze. The dull ache began to throb behind my eyes again.

It took both hands and feet to get his heavy corpse from me. He sank backwards, his head hitting the windowpane with a soft, hollow thud.

""Well, Nathan,"" I said, the words dry and rasping in my throat, ""thanks for an exciting night.""

I rose to my feet, stretching my arms in front of me. My elbows popping with a satisfying crack, relieving the stiffness of a sleepless night.

I lurched my body up the creaky stairs towards the bedroom. The light flickered on, humming with a sickly yellow glow. I stared at my reflection in the mirror leaning in the corner of the room. Yeesh, I‚Äôm a mess. My duffel bag lay next to it right where I had left it the night before. 

I flicked through his closet, the stale scent of his life clinging to the fabric. I grabbed an old band tee and some worn jeans and threw them onto his bed. Lifting my own stained t-shirt over my head, I held it out in front of me. Why did I ever decide to wear white? I discarded it into his laundry basket, shimmied out of my stolen pajama pants, and tossed them in too. I pulled on the outfit laying on the bed before giving myself a quick, last check in the mirror. I gazed for a moment at my pale skin, stretched taut over high cheekbones, seeming to glow in the early light. My eyes, usually the color of moss, were now pools of deep crimson. It was hunger, a constant, gnawing presence. My dark hair, almost black, was perpetually a tangled mess, defying any and all attempts at fixing.

Snatching my hoodie from the bedpost, I fastened it around my waist and snatched up my bag and slung it around my shoulder before heading back down the stairs. I swung around the banister in mock childish joy and gave Nathan one last wave goodbye. I passed through the kitchen, its surfaces still cluttered with the remnants of his life, and grabbed his keys and the cash, shoved haphazardly in his wallet. I spun around, pulled the door open, and I was off. I climbed into the driver‚Äôs seat of his truck, the interior smelling faintly of stale coffee and cigarettes. With a turn of the keys, the engine sputtered to life with a hesitant cough. Then, with a jolt, I pulled out of the old gravely driveway, leaving the decaying house and its silent occupant behind. Headed down the empty streets.

It was always like this. A messy feed, a hasty retreat, a fleeting moment of guilt gnawing at the edges of my consciousness. Then‚Ä¶ the road. Always on the road. An endless stretch of asphalt, unspooling beneath the tires like a ribbon of fate. Each mile a desperate push against what I‚Äôd done, the suffocating shame that never truly went away.

I was maybe six years old, a lifetime ago, my legs swinging freely as I sat on the porch swing next to my dad. The late afternoon sun, warm and golden, cast long, distorted shadows across the overgrown lawn of our house. He was reading aloud, his voice a warm, comforting rumble that vibrated through me, from a battered, well-loved copy of ""The Hobbit.""

""In a hole in the ground there lived a hobbit,"" he read, his calloused finger tracing the words on the page.

""Daddy, what's a hobbit?""

He chuckled, ""Well, sweetheart, a hobbit is a small, cheerful creature who loves good food and good company. They're very brave, even though they don't always look like it."" His voice held a quiet certainty.

""Like me?"" I asked,"" tilting my head.

He smiled, his eyes crinkling at the corners, ""Exactly like you. You're my little hobbit."" His words a desperate attempt to protect me from the truth of what I was.

My dad, Andrew, was everything. He was my rock. He was the only normal thing in my increasingly strange world. He knew about my‚Ä¶ condition. He knew I was different. Not just peculiar, but fundamentally wrong, a deviation from the natural order. He didn't know the full extent of it ‚Äì not yet ‚Äì but he knew enough to try and protect me, to keep me hidden from the world's harsh judgment. He kept me home, a prisoner of his love. He pulled me from school when the whispers started, when the other children recoiled from my unnatural paleness, my uncanny stare. He saw the subtle, horrifying shifts in my skin, the veins growing more prominent, the capillaries spider-webbing beneath the surface. He saw the unnatural sharpness behind my eyes, a predatory glint behind my innocent facade. A shadow grew in me, a silent, malevolent presence taking root in my very soul.

My mother, however, was a ghost in my mind. A faint memory that grew fainter with each passing year, her face dissolving into a hazy outline. She had left when I was young, too young to truly understand, claiming she couldn't handle the ""burden"" of a half-human child. My father never spoke ill of her name. He never uttered a harsh word, but the sorrow in his eyes told a different story. A gaping wound she left behind, one that time couldn't heal.

He took me to doctors. One after another, a parade of specialists, each offering a new theory, a new failed treatment. Desperate for a diagnosis, a cure, a reason for my abnormalities. He read books on genetics, folklore, anything that might offer a flicker of hope. He even took me to a‚Ä¶ specialist. A woman who lived deep in the Vermont woods, her cabin shrouded in mist. She claimed to be an expert in ""rare blood disorders."" She gave me bitter herbs and performed strange rituals under a waning moon. She spoke in hushed tones about ancient bloodlines, about curses and legacies. It was all useless, of course. Nothing worked. Each failed attempt chipped away at his hope and mine, leaving us both hollowed out. I saw his despair, a crushing weight in his eyes, and I felt it, a mirror of my own hopelessness.

Then came the night that changed everything, the night my world shattered. The air grew thick, heavy with dread, a premonition of doom. The hunger took over. Not a hunger for food, not the mundane pangs of a human stomach. It was something deeper, older, a raw, clawing emptiness inside my gut that demanded to be filled. My throat burned, a fire relentlessly spread through my veins, consuming me from within. My body hummed with a terrible, unfamiliar power, monstrous instinct overriding all reason.

I stumbled through the house, a phantom in my own home. My vision blurred, colors warping into sickening distortions. My body shook, a primal tremor that threatened to tear me apart. Every nerve ending felt exposed, raw and screaming.

I found him in the kitchen. He was making himself a late-night snack. The soft light from the refrigerator illuminated him in a fluorescent glow. The smell of his blood‚Ä¶ it hit me like a physical blow, a concussive wave of desire. Hot. Metallic. Intoxicating. It filled my head, a suffocating cloud overwhelming me, drowning out everything else. An ancient and irresistible urge tore through me. It drowned out everything else ‚Äì my father's face, his kind, weary eyes, the lifetime of love and sacrifice. All of it faded behind a blinding red haze, a curtain of bloodlust.

I didn't understand. Not until it was too late. The ripping sound, a wet, tearing noise that would haunt my nightmares for eternity. The sudden, terrible silence that followed, deafening in its finality. The warmth on my hands, a sticky, viscous coating that would never truly wash away.

I killed him.

The memory of that night was a jagged, burning, and heavy on my soul. It festered and ate away at my being. Not a scar, but an open wound that bled constantly, staining every thought, every action. I ran, of course. I couldn't face what I had done. I couldn't face what I had become. The monster I tried to hide, the monster he tried to protect me from. It had won. And it had taken him away. I had taken him away. With every mile I strayed from what was once home, the monster he'd tried to shield me from stretched its limbs within, hungry for the next inevitable feast.

**I know why compilation takes a certain time and how it works.** But what I still can't understand is how developers handle script compilation wait times, especially in Unity and Unreal Engine.

**I'm talking here only about script compilation that's required when you make a small change in any script.**

When I tried Unity I was waiting 1 minute on a really small prototype and from what I read, it can takes up to 10 minutes for larger projects.

In web developement, the usual script compilation you'll encounter is when you're using TypeScript, and it's around 50ms when you save a file. I built the habit to make quick and small changes to my scripts to see in real-time the result on my second screen. So for me waiting 10 minutes to compile a small change is complete madness. Even 1 minute is crazy.

I feel like I'm missing something here because I can't believe every developers using Unity and Unreal (with C++) are waiting even more than 1 minute when they add a semicolon.

Is there a workflow or approach I'm not aware of? Is this why AAA games takes years to be made?  
If there isn't any solution to this, what do developers do during compilation? Especially in offices, do they just wander here drinking coffee? Watch videos?",1,1749038370.0,gamedev,5,1.0,False

I moved into a condo in Bangkok 5 days ago and have been dealing with serious issues since day one. I‚Äôm hoping someone here can offer advice on how to get my deposit back so I can move out.

Here‚Äôs what I‚Äôve experienced:
	‚Ä¢	The unit was not properly cleaned before I moved in ‚Äî there was dust everywhere, dead cockroaches, bug droppings, mold in the washing machine and shower, and a strong musty smell throughout.
	‚Ä¢	The bathroom smells like sewage and the shower ceiling has visible water damage.
	‚Ä¢	Furniture is in terrible condition: the dinner table completely broke, the couch is falling apart, the coffee table has water damage, and the drawers don‚Äôt open.
	‚Ä¢	The air conditioner takes over 10 minutes just to turn on.
	‚Ä¢	Overall, everything feels old, broken, and neglected. I could list more issues, but you get the ideas.

The unit is only 26 sq. meters and I‚Äôm paying 15,000 baht per month. It had been sitting empty for over 3 months ‚Äî and now I see why.

I raised these concerns with the agent immediately and asked for everything to be fixed or to return my 2-month deposit so I can move out. I even offered to forfeit one month‚Äôs rent to make things easier for them ‚Äî I thought that was a fair compromise. But the owner has refused to return my deposit. I should also mention that the owner is a Chinese man.

Yesterday the owner sent a cleaner into the condo without informing me. I was in the unit when someone suddenly unlocked the door and walked right in. It was a complete shock ‚Äî I thought someone was breaking in. I believe it‚Äôs a serious violation of my privacy and safety to give out a key without my consent.

This is my first time renting on my own, so I realize I may have made some mistakes in the process. I just want to move into a clean, safe, and well-maintained place, but right now I feel stuck.

Does anyone know what steps I can take to get my deposit back? Any advice would be appreciated ‚Äî legal, practical, or personal experience. Thanks in advance.",3,1749038191.0,Bangkok,15,0.67,False

## What is Riven Trust?

**Riven Trust** is an automated trading platform designed to simplify the trading experience for users‚Äîespecially those who are new to the game. Think of it like your personal trading assistant that watches the markets 24/7 and makes trades based on pre-set algorithms.

It‚Äôs marketed as being beginner-friendly, with a dashboard that‚Äôs easy to navigate and tools that don‚Äôt require a PhD in finance. Riven Trust supports trading across multiple asset classes: **cryptocurrencies, forex, stocks, and commodities**. It uses AI-driven technology to analyze market data in real-time and execute trades automatically when profitable opportunities arise.

So if you‚Äôve ever been intimidated by trading charts or missed out on big moves because you weren‚Äôt glued to your screen, Riven Trust aims to take that pressure off your shoulders.

## Who Created Riven Trust?

There‚Äôs not a ton of public info out there about the *exact* team behind Riven Trust, which is pretty common with platforms in this space. What we do know is that the platform appears to follow a similar structure to others like **Bitcoin Code** and **Immediate Edge**, which suggests it may be developed by a team with previous experience in fintech and trading software.

While the anonymity might raise a few eyebrows, it‚Äôs worth noting that many legit platforms (especially in crypto) start off without big-name founders. Still, I‚Äôd love to see more transparency going forward‚Äîespecially as the platform gains traction.

## How Does Riven Trust Work?

At its core, Riven Trust uses **automated trading algorithms** to make buy/sell decisions based on market signals. Once you create an account and deposit funds, the system gets to work scanning the markets in real-time.

Here‚Äôs a simplified version of how it flows:

1. **You set your preferences** (risk level, assets to trade, etc.)
2. Riven Trust‚Äôs algorithm analyzes the market using technical indicators and news trends.
3. When a solid trade opportunity pops up, it executes trades on your behalf.
4. You sit back and monitor performance (or tweak settings if needed).

It‚Äôs not a magic money machine (no platform is), but it does take out a lot of the guesswork‚Äîespecially for people who aren‚Äôt pros.

## Riven Trust Pros and Cons

**Pros:**

- ‚úÖ Simple and beginner-friendly interface  
- ‚úÖ Automated trading with minimal manual effort  
- ‚úÖ Supports multiple asset classes  
- ‚úÖ Demo account available for practice  
- ‚úÖ 24/7 customer support  
- ‚úÖ Quick deposit and withdrawal process  

**Cons:**

- ‚ùå Not regulated by any major financial authority  
- ‚ùå Limited transparency about the founding team  
- ‚ùå Market risks still apply despite automation  
- ‚ùå No mobile app (only browser-based mobile access)

- **Desktop/Laptop** ‚Äì works smoothly on Chrome, Firefox, Safari  
- **Smartphones/Tablets** ‚Äì fully responsive on mobile browsers  

While there‚Äôs no dedicated mobile app (yet), the mobile experience is solid. I played around on both Android and iPhone browsers and didn‚Äôt run into any issues.

## Riven Trust ‚Äì Supported Countries

Riven Trust is available in **most countries**, especially those in Europe, Asia, and South America. It‚Äôs also functional in parts of **North America**, but **users in the U.S. and Canada** might face some restrictions depending on local regulations.

Before signing up, it‚Äôs best to check if the platform is available in your region. Some users have reported needing to use a VPN to access the dashboard if they're in a restricted country.

## Riven Trust ‚Äì Top Features

### Real-Time Market Analysis

The platform uses AI to scan the markets **in real-time**, looking for patterns and trends. It‚Äôs like having a team of analysts working for you 24/7‚Äîexcept it doesn‚Äôt sleep or take coffee breaks.

Short answer: **No, it doesn‚Äôt appear to be a scam**.

Longer answer: While it‚Äôs not regulated, which is always something to note, there are no major red flags in terms of user experience. The platform doesn‚Äôt promise ‚Äúget rich quick‚Äù returns, and you can withdraw your money at any time (which I tested).

However, as with any trading platform‚Äîespecially automated ones‚Äî**you should always be cautious**. Stick with the demo mode first, don‚Äôt invest more than you can afford to lose, and understand that there‚Äôs risk involved.

## What is the Minimum Deposit Required on Riven Trust?

The **minimum deposit is $250**, which is pretty standard for platforms in this space. That deposit gives you full access to the features and lets the trading bot start executing trades for you.

1l33ji8,https://www.reddit.com/r/scarystories/comments/1l33ji8/the_day_i_killed_myself/,The day I killed myself,"I was embedded in pain, it felt like constantly wearing a heavy blanket around my shoulders. Nobody could see or feel it. I was screaming but at the same time I was mute. 4 Years ago, I decided to finally end my suffering. I hanged myself from a wooden beam in my house. Surprisingly, I kicked, punched and tried to loosen the rope around my neck. For a few seconds the will of life entered my body.



It did not last long because I knew it was a farce. A self defense mechanism, nothing more. I closed my eyes waiting for my last breath to leave my nostrils. I could feel my blood turn cold and my heartbeat slowing down. It was very peaceful. I opened my eyes and what I saw was my dead body hanging from the beam. My feet were dangling. I looked like a doll my sister always played with.¬†



I went to the bathroom to wash my face and to brush my teeth. It was time to work. At the bus stop I saw an elderly woman reading the newspaper, she gave me a brief smile and I smiled at her back. Before I entered my workplace I decided to get a coffee and bagels. The young cashier wished me a nice day and complimented my shirt. It was a plain white shirt, nothing special but I enjoyed the little compliment.



At lunch, I got invited by some co-workers to join them. We talked about trivial stuff, the weather, sports, and the newest gossip about celebrities. I will never forget the stupid joke Paul made about what a rich man and a poor man gift their wives. I think i heard it before but his thick boston accent made it funnier.¬†



My boss told me he was pleased with my work and he would like to talk to me next week about giving me a promotion. I nodded and continued with my work but inside me was literally a firework going on. I could not wait to tell my wife about it when I am home.



I arrived home, my wife was busy with work related stuff but we agreed to celebrate my promotion later at a nice bar. I went to the attic, to see if my body was still hanging there.¬†



It was gone, only a note was left. The note read ‚ÄúKeep going.‚Äù

When I click the button ""previous round"", I want it to destroy the boulder and spawn it back at the previous location using the above variables. When plugged in to the spawn actor, the boulder spawns at 0,0,0. 

Am I storing or calling it incorrectly?

\- The spawn actor at start location works perfectly, those variables are set on BeginPlay. Only disconnected while troubleshooting.   
\- I have swapped the destroy and spawn actors around, didn't help.  
\- I have tried world transform with the same result.   
\- I have swapped the StartLocation and StartRotation variables and this spawns the actor at the correct location.  
\- I have split the location variable and increased the Z but this just spawns the actor at 0,0,1000

The numbers run counter to President Donald Trump‚Äôs messaging that his economic policies, including tariffs, will reduce U.S. trade imbalances. The politically inconvenient data prompted administration officials to block publication of the written analysis normally attached to the report because they disliked what it said about the deficit.

The published report, released Monday but dated May 29, includes numbers that are unchanged from how they would‚Äôve read in the unredacted report, said the people, who were granted anonymity to discuss internal decision-making.

Policymakers, farm groups and commodities traders rely on the closely watched report, which the Agriculture Department issues quarterly, for its analysis of imports and exports of major farm commodities including cotton and livestock. The highly unusual rollout could raise questions about potential political meddling with government reports that have traditionally been trusted for decades.

‚ÄúObjectivity is really key here and the public depends on it,‚Äù said Joe Glauber, a former USDA chief economist. ‚ÄúTo lose that trust would be terrible.‚Äù

A USDA spokesperson blamed the delay on an internal review.

‚ÄúThe report was hung up in internal clearance process and was not finalized in time for its typical deadline,‚Äù said USDA spokesperson Alec Varsamis in a statement. ‚ÄúGiven this report is not statutory as with many other reports USDA does, the Department is undergoing a review of all of its non-statutory reports, including this one, to determine next steps.‚Äù

It‚Äôs not clear when or if the written analysis portion will be released.

The previous forecast, published in February, projected a deficit of $49 billion for the current fiscal year, an increase from the November 2024 report. The new analysis revises the projection to a record $49.5 billion, beating the previous record of $31.8 billion in fiscal 2024.

Republicans used the quarterly report‚Äôs rising trade deficit projections during the Biden administration to accuse then-Secretary Tom Vilsack of not doing enough to promote U.S. farm exports. Agriculture secretaries historically have used the forecasts to promote policy initiatives.

The May report reflects Trump‚Äôs on-again, off-again tariffs, the people said. The president has announced sharply higher tariffs on China and ‚Äúreciprocal‚Äù levies of at least 10 percent on most U.S. trading partners.

Tariffs are not the only contributing factor to any trade deficit or surplus, Glauber said. Americans‚Äô love for blueberries year-round, loyalty to French wines and addiction to goods like coffees ‚Äî which the U.S. largely does not produce ‚Äî also contribute. A strong dollar can also widen the deficit.",1,1749037618.0,WhatTrumpHasDone,0,1.0,False

Usually I would start snacking after dinner even though I had already had a meal of protein and vegetable. Wasn‚Äôt hungry just snacking if you know what I mean. Now, I don‚Äôt snack after dinner. I was on Optavia and lost 50 pounds. When I started eating regular food I gained all the weight back plus some. I think it shot my metabolism being on such a low calorie restricted diet. Don‚Äôt know but just my thoughts. Also, after stopping Optavia  it was like I was borderline binge eating. Lost a lot of hair. That is what leads me to ask if anyone lost hair from the low calorie intake while being on contrave from not being hungry and eating less? The positives so far is I have found myself having so much more energy. I think the bupropion has helped me with the mild depression I had. I have never been on an anti depressant but if I stop contrave I will ask for a rx for bupropion. The only side effects I have noticed is mild constipation and a little jittery after I drink a cup of coffee in the morning. Has anyone had this as a side effective with coffee or caffeine?

Whether you‚Äôre trading Bitcoin, Ethereum, or even forex, these tools promise to make trading more accessible and potentially more profitable.

So in this full-on, no-BS review of Myrion Spectre, I‚Äôll break down how it works, what makes it different, and whether it‚Äôs worth your time (and money). I‚Äôll also toss in some of my own experiences and thoughts‚Äîboth the good and the ‚Äúmeh.‚Äù Let‚Äôs go.

## What is Myrion Spectre?

Myrion Spectre is an **automated trading software** that uses artificial intelligence and advanced algorithms to analyze market trends and execute trades on your behalf. It‚Äôs built for both newbies and experienced traders who want to save time and potentially improve their trading accuracy.

The platform claims to use real-time market data, predictive analytics, and customizable trading settings to help users make better decisions. This isn‚Äôt just another random crypto bot‚Äîit supports **multiple assets**, including cryptocurrencies, forex, stocks, and even commodities.

Think of it like your own digital trading assistant. You set your preferences, and it handles the rest. Sounds cool, right? But of course, automation isn‚Äôt magic‚Äîthere are still risks involved.

## Who Created Myrion Spectre?

The creators of Myrion Spectre remain somewhat mysterious, which is pretty typical for tools like this. However, based on available info and similarities with platforms like Bitcoin Era and Immediate Edge, it appears to be built by a **team of financial tech developers and market analysts**.

What stands out is the platform‚Äôs **partnership with regulated brokers**, which adds a layer of credibility. Even though the devs aren‚Äôt household names, the platform‚Äôs performance and user feedback suggest they know what they‚Äôre doing.

That said, I always prefer a bit more transparency. Knowing the team behind a tool builds trust. So I‚Äôm docking a few points here, but not enough to disregard the product.

I'm a 29yo khv (in a few months I'll be a wizard!). I've spent the last few year looking for a partner with no success, and seem to be making no progress. The reason I started so late was that in high school I was forbidden from dating. In college I was painfully socially anxious, addicted to video games and alcohol, and had no friends. After graduating in 2017, I was focused on working for the first time while balancing a drug addiction and not thinking about dating. Then COVID happened. Finally, in 2021, at 26, I got medicated with Adderall because I wasn't adjusting to wfh well, which actually helped my social anxiety. I finally realized I had to start focusing on dating or I would die alone, so a few months after getting medicated I started putting myself out there. 



The past few years, I've tried a couple of approaches The first approach is the apps. I've tried Tinder and Hinge on and off, usually for a couple weeks before the lack of success starts fucking with me mentally and I delete them until I feel better enough to try again. On Tinder, I might get like 3 likes in 2-3 weeks. But I almost never match with any of them, and I literally swipe right on 95% of girls (because they honestly are attractive to me). I've gotten 3 matches total: two never responded to my opener, one did. But we completely misread each others vibes, and did not click. The 1 response did motivate me to keep going, but it was literally 2 years ago at this point. I've tried Hinge as well, and send out my 8 messages per day, but have literally never gotten a response or like, so I gave up on Hinge 



There's a few things that probably don't help: visibly balding, South Asian (yes I know), have a foreign-sounding name, and look just generically ethnic. But to my credit, I have a good job, live near a big city, not short (5'10), and I'm in decent shape (regularly go to the gym). I though these traits would balance out a little, but I literally am swiping right on 95% of girls. And have only gotten maybe like 8 likes total over the course of 3 years, some of whom were bots/in different countries. I thought was like a 3-4 at least, and would be able to match with a fellow 3-4. To realize that probably thousands of women have looked at my profile and only the tiniest percentage of them were attracted enough to me to even just swipe right is absolutely brutal. Does that make me a 1 or even a 0?



The other option is meeting in person in a social setting. I've gone to meetups, dance groups, volunteered the past few years, though admittedly not as much as I should. But it's always feels so obvious I'm there looking for a partner, I can't hide the desperation. And knowing you're talking to a desperate dude just throws off the vibes of what's supposed to be a friendly gathering. I know you're supposed to just be casual, and let connections and chemistry form naturally, but I can't seem to do that. Partly because I'm socially awkward and suck at conversation. And partly because I don't know how to be around a person consistently enough to form a natural connection. People are constantly changing between gatherings, and it feels weird to be ""clingy"" to those that aren't, if that makes sense. It feels like I have ulterior intentions, especially if it's a woman. Because I do, I'm truthfully not there to make friends (though that would be a great side effect), but to find a partner



The last option is cold approaching. I tried once. A cute librarian kept smiling at me when walking by, and kept making eye contact, so I felt like she was checking me out. I know you're not supposed to ask girls out while they're working, but I was 100% sure she was sending signals. So while she was checking out my books, I asked if she wanted to get coffee sometime. From the immediate look of panic in her eyes, I realized I had completely misread her. She just said ""Uhh"" uncomfortably and turned to her fellow librarian, and I immediately apologized. I don't blame her at all, I think she just didn't know what to do. Going home, I kept thinking about the look in her eyes, and how her had voice tightened up, and how she turned to her fellow librarian for help. I, a strange man, had made her feel so uncomfortable by imposing my desire on her while she was just trying to do her job. I vowed to never try cold approaching again, because clearly I can't read signals well. I was so sure she was into me, or at least checking me out



So what are my options here fellas? I've tried everything I can think of the past few years, with no luck. Anything I haven't considered? Or am I to just die alone, which I've actually made my peace with. Historically speaking a lot of men died alone, so I have good company I guess

(oops)

----

Now: Good evening 

(‚ÄúGood evening, Seth.‚Äù) 

(As Seth, Jane briefly handled the two photographs Id placed on the coffee table between us.) 

I am doing two things here ‚Äî but you can also have the material on any picture separately if you choose to. 

(‚ÄúYes.‚Äù) 

Each of you, again, chose your parents and environment. You spoke in your notes (two days ago) of 
precognition in connection with art ‚Äî an excellent point. Precognition in those terms also applies 
at your birth, when ahead of time you are quite aware on unconscious levels of those conditions 
that you will meet. You have chosen them and projected them ahead of you, out into the medium of time.

----

I unwittingly dived into the deep end without any swim lessons and floundered. Uknown Reality has
no chapter structure and does not answer the basic questions found in ""Seth Speaks"".

Although I was lost, I saw a precision of language and a rigor for capturing and analyzing the
information. I knew this was something special.

I then figured out where I went wrong, bought ""Seth Speaks"" and I was hooked.

----

So you may be reading the Seth material trying to figure out how to internalize all of this just like I was.

My suggestion is simple. 

I ask you to take ten minutes and do this now:

Write down the most pressing questions that you have.

Reduce this list to seven. Seven is the maximum slots of short term memory you have. This doesn't
mean this list lives in short term memory but I think it is a good ""rule of thumb"" to work with.

This is a serious exercise and so I urge you to not just read these words, but get out a piece of paper,
write down your seven questions and make them available to you as you study the Seth material.

----

**This is my current priority list of questions:**

1. How can I consciously think in the Sumari Language?

2. How can I go OBE at will?

3. What exactly does Seth do in his spare time?

4. How does Seth manipulate his consciousness?

5. How is ""All That Is"" inscribed within the body?

6. How can I become aware of my simultaneous selves?

7. What is the true perspective of the entity?

I am not asking this group for answers. These are my questions and I will continue to ponder them and I will find the answers that I seek.

----

By writing these questions down, it forces you to crystalize what drives you to read Seth. Everyone
has their own questions.

Take this quote from ""Seth Speaks"":

*Now, each whole self, or multidimensional personality, has its own purposes, missions, and creative 
endeavors that are initial and basic parts of itself and that determine those qualities that make it eternally valid and eternally seeking.*

And so when you write down these questions, they are yours. Your questions are not my questions. These questions are facets of what makes you unique and eternally seeking.

And as you read the Seth material, you will filter everything thru the lens of these questions. And you will find answers that you
would not have found otherwise. And those answer will lead to new questions.

----

**This is the secret to learning anything:**

questions -> answers -> questions -> repeat forever

No matter how developed you are and the scope of your awareness, there will always be questions to drive you.

----

Lets take this scene from Oversoul Seven:

Seven answered, worried. 

*""And there's one thing I want to know. How long has this conversation between us been going on? Before I came in on it, I mean?""* 

She (Cyprus) just looked at him. For a brief instant the handsome man of indeterminate age and the 
beautiful woman of indeterminate age materialized again and merged, stabilized, focused until it was 
so vivid and brilliant that Seven could hardly bear it. 

*""Don't you know? Don't you know?""* 

The musical voice seemed to come from everywhere, from inside Oversoul Seven, and outside him, from the clouds and the jet. 
The words seemed to echo through time as he knew it and didn't know it, until he felt that Lydia and 
Proteus and Josef and Ma-ah were all singing, and asking the question all at once. 

The phenomenon vanished so quickly and completely that Seven almost lost the balance of his consciousness. 

*""What was that?""* he gasped, *""What happened?""* 

*""Every once in a while you ask a really important question,""* Cyprus said. *""Or rather, 
the question that you actually ask has a really important one hidden inside of it. Then you get an answer.""*

----

Lets end with this scene from The Matrix (This movie stands the test of time):

**Trinity:** Right now, all I can tell you is that you‚Äôre in danger. I brought you here to warn you.

**Neo:** Of what?

**Trinity:** They‚Äôre watching you, Neo.

**Neo:** Who is?

**Trinity:** Please just listen. I know why you‚Äôre here, Neo. I know what you‚Äôve been doing. I know why you hardly sleep, why you live alone, and why night after night you sit at your computer. You‚Äôre looking for him. I know, because I was once looking for the same thing. And when he found me, he told me I wasn‚Äôt really looking for him. I was looking for an answer. It‚Äôs the question that drives us, Neo. It‚Äôs the question that brought you here. You know the question just as I did.

**Neo:** What is the Matrix?

My dad and I went through the drive-through and my dad ordered a coffee. They asked if he wanted sugar, and he said ‚ÄúI would like Splenda.‚Äù They asked how much or how many packets he wanted. My dad replied with ‚ÄúTwenty-seven.‚Äù 

Cue malicious compliance!

So, when we got the coffee, I looked in the bag and I was said, ‚ÄúDad your Splenda is not in the bag.‚Äù My dad started to get a little a bit upset. I suddenly got look of realization on my face.  I turned to him and I asked him, ‚ÄúUh, dad? You don‚Äôt think they put all of the packets in your coffee do you?‚Äù 

The moment he took a sip, he nearly spat it out. Turns out they didn‚Äôt realize he was joking. They thought he was serious. He ended up throwing the cup of coffee away when we got to whatever store we ended up going to after getting whatever he ended up getting at McDonald‚Äôs. 

My dad was completely joking. My dad is someone who likes to tease, but I feel like he wanted the amount of splendid so that he could have extra packets, but he did not think that they would actually put that much in there. They didn‚Äôt even ask if he was sure.  

They maliciously complied with his request, not even questioning anything which honestly quite stupid on their part.

1l32zac,https://www.reddit.com/r/Dublin/comments/1l32zac/eli5_how_dublin_works/,ELI5 how Dublin works.,"So for context, I grew up here and went overseas in my early 20s. Never meant to stay away but things happened and we have lived overseas for 15 years. Just how things go I guess.

 We come back as often as we can and I'm always struck by how much it changes. The Dublin I left is much different to what it's like now. I loved it when I was here and I love it now too.  

It feels clean, it feels safe, it feels vibrant. The Luas is cheap as chips and much more connected. All the bars and restaurants are full, all the shops are packed. There is people everywhere and a great buzz around the place. People seem happy. Everytime we've been back since about 2017 or maybe 2019 it's felt better and better, at least from an outside perspective. I'm aware that is probably different if you live here.

What I can't get my head around is how people are doing all those things. We both work decent jobs but there is no way we could afford to go out or shop here, if we weren't on a holiday. Food is double the cost to eat out. Pints are expensive and I'm vaguely aware of the housing situation from keeping an eye on RTE. 

Are people here actually earning huge money? Or is that all tourists? It didn't sound like tourists. If you are working in Dublin is it affordable? Are people just spending everything because of the housing situation? Or is it just that there are so many people around it looks busy? Is it something else?

We're always conscious when we visit we are seeing a fake version of what it would be like to live here as we're on holidays and drinking coffee at 11am instead of working. I'd love to hear your perspective. I'd love to live back here someday but I'm an outsider now. Your experience would be interesting.

Their only cake decorator is a nasty bitch of a woman with even nastier opinions about gay people, and she is a real piece of work, let me tell you.

One of my siblings who is LGBT+ works in the store, too, and they've been fed up with this lady for a while. Well, a couple days ago, this sibling told my family that for their upcoming birthday, they want us to custom order them a pride-themed cake from the store so that this homophobic woman will have to make a cake that stands for everything she so openly hates.

My family¬†*is*¬†going to do this, but we're doing so much more than that, too. One of my other siblings already ordered a pride cake so that we could all have cake just because. My mother ordered a pride cake to give to our favourite (and openly gay) barista at a coffee shop we like. My wife ordered a pride cake just because she loves me and knows I love cake.

You see where this is going?

I have A LOT of siblings. My siblings have families and friends. I have family and friends. And our family and friends have their own share of family and friends, and so on. And because we're not pieces of shit, and because in my family, we all share a powerful strand of petty DNA, we ALL are ordering pride cakes. This homophobic cake-decorator will be making hundreds of pride cakes this month.

And the icing on the pride cake? The cake-decorator's manager saw the first cake, the first one my sibling ordered, and loved the concept. The manager figures they can sell extra cakes this month if they advertise that they can theme them for Pride Month (she's definitely right), so she told the decorator to make one for the display case. Now, all the LGBT+ in town will see it, and this homophobic waste of space will have to make even MORE pride cakes.

Sometimes, life is beautiful. It brings me genuine joy to think of this woman spending her month making more cakes than this town orders in a typical year, and all of them themed for Pride.",1151,1749035040.0,pettyrevenge,161,0.88,False

He seemed nice & polite when he approached me so we became friends. He asked me to an event that he ""already had tickets to and otherwise would go to waste"" so I attended with him. We chatted over coffee after the not so fun event at a diner for 2 hrs talking about life, etc.

So never have I implied I liked him asides from as friends only and have been nothing but polite to him but he's been holding onto the 2 hr coffee shop banter as some cue we have some awesome connection (just hell no).

So for the past 20 yrs it's been; following my social accts (when I used to be on them regularly), replying and agreeing with my posts, emailing regularly, asking me to attend various functions with him (all declined), asking me if I needed anyone to make me food, drive me,do errands for me while I am receiving medical care, to the more serious contorting his profession to try to fit the mould of men I date; investment capitalists, professors, authors, etc, and actually posting that to his linkedin and telling me all about it. I don't think he's an investment capitalist at all nor could he even cosplay one so this is... odd.

He's now 56 yrs old and I don't think he's ever had a relationship, like ever.

Then he looked up my brother on LinkedIn, connects with him (doesn't even know my brother), asks my bro for my changed phone#, which my bro didn't give him. Just recently sees that my bro, as VP of Finance, is looking for another job as their company was bought out. He then sends emails to random people he connected himself to on LinkedIn to see if he can get my brother a different job when My brother hasn't even asked or contacted him about it. My brother finds him very inappropriate and odd as well as imposing and uncomfortable. Also, he then asks my brother, after sending these referral emails to essentially strangers, to ""let's all have dinner with your sister now"" , to which my brother firmly told him no.

This ""friend"", really an acquaintance, has tried to look up my current address and phone number, emails me asking if I need anything, a ride, for him to cook for me, or if I need anything at all, or if I'm under the weather he'll ""hold my hand and read to me"" , or anything else he'll do it for me, on top of still asking for dates for which I have innumerously declined every time.

He's really annoying and irritating, I think this may be his problem with women. He's SO clueless and inappropriate. He posted the ONE photo of us together that we took at that ONE event on his X acct. No,I do not want to be pictured with him at all, even from 20 yrs ago. Why is he holding onto a memory I can barely recall?

He recently sent me a belated e-bday card on HIS bday (my bday was 3 months ago). I was confused and had to ask why he sent this and why on this date. Then he said it was HIS bday, WTF.

So basically told him I had explosive mutual attraction with my dad's surgeon a month ago and that actually pulled me out of a long held depression (due to health reasons) and I felt alive again. I also made it clear that without any chemistry or physical attraction I wouldn't be interested in a relationship. Unfortunately, I believe this friend would be crazy enough to try to look up the handsome young surgeon at the local University Hospital here which he knows my dad had surgery in.

He messaged back a day later after I told him about the doctor thanking me for my reply and that he'll get back to me. That was like a week ago and frankly I hope he doesn't reply back and just gets the message that I have never been attracted to him other than as a friend and not even that anymore.",0,1749034768.0,datingoverforty,33,0.33,False

So, I've been thinking about something quite a bit recently, and figured I'd throw it out into the abyss of the internet. Ever just sit and wonder if all our rushed greetings and casual 'how are you's are more than just routine? Like, I bumped into an old friend from college last week at a coffee shop ‚Äì she's doing great, by the way, happily engaged and all ‚Äì but what struck me was this moment. 

Alright, here's the thing. After the usual 'it's been so long!' chit-chat, she asked me, really genuinely, 'How are you, really?' And in that second, I felt this warmth. I mean, how often do we really want the honest answer when we ask that question? It made me think about how easy it is to float through interactions on autopilot, and how refreshing it was for someone to actually pause the script for a second.

I guess it's got me wondering if we're all sorta craving more than just these surface-level exchanges, deep down. Are those rare genuine moments what stick with us because they're different, revealing what we really want ‚Äì true connection? Maybe it sounds cheesy, but there's beauty in those pauses. ü§î

Their only cake decorator is a nasty bitch of a woman with even nastier opinions about gay people, and she is a real piece of work, let me tell you. 

One of my siblings who is LGBT+ works in the store, too, and they've been fed up with this lady for a while. Well, a couple days ago, this sibling told my family that for their upcoming birthday, they want us to custom order them a pride-themed cake from the store so that this homophobic woman will have to make a cake that stands for everything she so openly hates. 

My family *is* going to do this, but we're doing so much more than that, too. One of my other siblings already ordered a pride cake so that we could all have cake just because. My mother ordered a pride cake to give to our favourite (and openly gay) barista at a coffee shop we like. My wife ordered a pride cake just because she loves me and knows I love cake. 

You see where this is going? 

I have A LOT of siblings. My siblings have families and friends. I have family and friends. And our family and friends have their own share of family and friends, and so on. And because we're not pieces of shit, and because in my family, we all share a powerful strand of petty DNA, we ALL are ordering pride cakes. This homophobic cake-decorator will be making hundreds of pride cakes this month. 

And the icing on the pride cake? The cake-decorator's manager saw the first cake, the first one my sibling ordered, and loved the concept. The manager figures they can sell extra cakes this month if they advertise that they can theme them for Pride Month (she's definitely right), so she told the decorator to make one for the display case. Now, all the LGBT+ in town will see it, and this homophobic waste of space will have to make even MORE pride cakes. 

Sometimes, life is beautiful. It brings me genuine joy to think of this woman spending her month making more cakes than this town orders in a typical year, and all of them themed for Pride. ",125,1749034488.0,CharlotteDobreYouTube,18,0.96,False

1l32gxd,https://www.reddit.com/r/TalesFromTheFrontDesk/comments/1l32gxd/incompetent_chef/,Incompetent Chef,"My disdain for the main breakfast chef began a mere two months after I began my career as a front desk agent. I noticed that, for the life of him, he would not and could not stay in his own damn lane. He'd report anything and everything he witness to anyone and everyone that listened. He would always come through the back office to access the storage room so he could carefully observe whatever it is I was doing. He could have easily gone through the door on the other side and saved me the bother. 

Every time I hear him opening the door, I do my best to hide any traces of fun or whimsy. If I'm playing a game on my computer, I urgently slam it shut. If I'm doodling in a notebook, I slam it shut. Doodling on a sheet of paper? Flip it over and pretend to write something else that has to do with work. In fact I've had to shut my laptop three times since I started typing this. The whole things is pretty funny considering that I've both doodled and used my laptop directly in front of my boss. It took me a very long time to be comfortable using my phone around him, but now it's all I do when I hear him approaching. Eyes down, fixed on the screen. I do, however, completely mute the audio, because I don't need him knowing that I'm a human who gets bored sometimes. 

Anything the chef is unable to do for whatever reason, the front desk is expected to take care of. It is fr lugs the trash bags overflowing with team parents' cheap beer cans out to the dumpster, despite the trashcan being located in the dining room. The dining room is his responsibility. The front desk and back office are mine. 

We even do things for him that he's perfectly capable of doing himself. For example, making coffee. As a night auditor, I am expected to have to coffee ready whenever Chef Wacko clocks in. Sometimes, he'd pop in up to two hours early. He would always come bitch at me to come make the coffee for him. Sometimes I gave in, and others I flat out refused.

About a month ago, his car engine blew out. Cars and car repairs are expensive, I get it. At first, he payed for his own taxis and Ubers. Two weeks ago, my manager instructed me to take cash out of the drawer. I was also in charged of watching for the chef's taxi and then bringing the cash out to the driver. I understand not having the money to fix a car, or being late to work because you don't have a way to get there. But having the hotel pay? Really? 

Whenever he's late, I'm asked to put the bread in the bread holder, and to turn on the juice machine and food warmers. Every so often I don't mind doing this. It usually happens once every month or two anyway. Twice in the last week I've recieved texts from my manager asking me to put the food out. ""Chef Wacko will be a bit late. I'm getting him an Uber."" What do you mean *you're* getting him an  Uber? Passing your money problems onto the hotel and its management is absolutely unacceptable. This man needs to get his shit together enough to where people 1/2 and 1/3 of his age don't have to help him out with every minor inconvenience. Enough for us to not have to do even more of his job for him than we do already. ",17,1749034261.0,TalesFromTheFrontDesk,4,1.0,False
1l32gix,https://www.reddit.com/r/HFY/comments/1l32gix/the_human_resource/,The Human Resource.,"""There's something going on in this company."" The Boss said. He twisted in his chair, red tentacles flapping about, some caressing the keys of his cyroputer while others touched various objects in the room. Vorexians always see better through touch.

""I can't be bothered."" I answered.

""Gilvox, I value you, you know that? To me you're the future of this corporation.""

""To be honest, I don't give a fuck about you or this company. I'm only here so I can pay rent."" I answered.

""That's another thing about you Tetromites, you always speak your mind. That's why I enjoy talking to you, you can't hide what you're thinking."" The Boss leaned forward, his bulbous head dripping slime on the desk top. ""Since the human was hired, production levels have gone up four hundred percent with him leading in the output. It's unprecedented, the amount of work we're putting in is the dream of every boss. But there's something here, this isn't normal.""

Of course it wasn't normal. I'd noticed it, even pointed it out in the break room as the human brewed a pot of what he called 'coffee.' Some disgusting looking brown-black liquid that humans must drink to function. I pointed out how odd it was that since the human came, the amount of work everyone was putting in was fairly higher than usual. I'd also pointed out that the coffee the human drunk every moment of every passing day resembled the runny shits of a Biromiteran. Many agreed with the comparison with runny shits but few commented on the level of work output. The human just looked at me like I wasn't even there. 

""You've noticed it haven't you?"" The Boss said. ""The human must be up to something. Do you think he wants my job?""

""The human doesn't look bothered about anything.""

""Sort of like you. That's why I need you to get close to him, figure out what's going on and we shall see about a raise."" The Boss lowered his head and closed his eyes without waiting for a reply. Fast asleep, he'd be like that for the next twelve hours. That's the benefit of being the boss.

I understood his dilemma, the more the work output the more pressure he'd have to increase salaries. Also, the company was a branch of an interstellar organization and with the output, profits were sky rocketing which meant they would attract the attention of the higher ups. Which meant promotion, and this would require the boss to leave his comfortable post to go somewhere with more responsibilities. Something he loathed. The lazy bastard.

I exited the office but not before snatching one of the gold ink fountain pens that are worth a month if my salary. I went straight to the secretary in charge of gossip within the office. Her name was Imelada, a Hivoxian from Planet Osteris.

I found her typing on her cyroputer. Her fingers a blur on the keyboard. She only ever wrote four hundred words a day, summarizing everything as 'Uneventful.' Now she was stacking up files full of written accounting details, categorized according to data input in relation to work output. A task that takes seven workers to do in three months, she was doing alone within a day.

""Hello Imelada."" I said.

""I'm not in the mood for your negative vibes."" Imelada answered. Her tentacle hair was standing on end, which was odd for things that usually slither. Her yellow eyes were too large, and too bright. She lifted a brown case of some liquid and took a sip of it before smacking her lips."" What do you want?""

""Awful amount of work you're doing there."" I said.

""What's it to you?""

""Just odd you know, I normally find you surfing cooking blogs but for the past two days you've been working. Diiigently. It's odd.""

""Fuck off."" She said while still typing.

""It has something to do with the human."" I said. Her hands stopped, fingers hovering over the keyboard. ""It does, doesn't it? There's something the human has done to everyone in this office.""

Imelada turned her eyes to me and smiled. ""I have no idea what you're talking about."" Then she went back to typing. 

The Jerrocian who normally delivers papers and files from one office to another at a slow even pace that takes him close to half an hour to make a full circuit was sprinting right past where I was standing. A silver flask in one hand that he was bringing to his lips as his feet flew him across the room, completing circuits within five minutes of what normally took him thirty minutes. A stash of files and papers were pressed to his midriff with one of his three hands while the other waved at me as he sprinted by. I grabbed his waving arm and tagged him to me. 

""What the fuck is going on?"" I asked. 

""I can't stop."" He started pumping himself up and down. Lowering his four jointed legs and raising them repeatedly. ""I can't stop! If I stop I'll explode! Let go of me!"" 

""What's going on? I want to know what's going on! You never run! You've been called to the boss's office numerous times because you fell asleep while walking and now you're sprinting?"" 

""Let go of me!"" He tagged his arm free of me and brought the flask in one of his hands to his mouth and that's when I saw the liquid as it poured into his maw. Dark and brown like the runny shits of a Biromiteran. The Jerrocian jumped up once then broke into a fresh sprint.

I turned my eyes around the office. There was the Bigorian standing by the copy printer, printing what appeared to be thousands of pages of a novel he'd written in three days and had already recieved a publishing contract for according to office rumors. In his hand was a mug of dark brown liquid. 

There was the Spiloxian at the work board, handling statistical analysis alone, something that takes a team of three. While sipping from a yellow canteen.

And the Dirodian at HR, carrying out a full meeting on appropriate work place behavior. Her third meeting of the day. She used to do one in four months. And beside her desk was a flask of dark brown liquid.

The same liquid. Coffee. 

I rushed to the human's cubicle and found him fast asleep, head resting on his chest. There were pots of coffee all over the floor of his workspace. And a bunch of flasks and thermoses. He was fast asleep, his cyroputer was turned off and a fresh stack of filed paperwork was completed and resting on his work desk.

""You have been giving them coffee."" I said. The human's eyes fluttered open and he peered over at me with clear brown eyes. ""It's the coffee that makes them work like this.""

""So?"" The human asked. Nonchalant as always. 

""So? I will report you to the boss! There are drug policies to be enforced within the work place.""

""And what will the Boss do?""

""He'll fire you!""

""How about I just quit?""

""What?""

The human raised his voice louder. ""Fine! I'll quit my job if that'll make you happy."" I wondered why he was shouting.

Suddenly there was a stempede as everyone in the workplace except the sleeping Boss suddenly crowded into the human's cubicle, pushing me in until I was pressed to the wall.

""Did I hear the human say he will quit?""

""It's Gilvox! He was threatening the human!""

Suddenly hands, mandibles, tentacles, telekinetic force and slime covered skin gripped every part of my body. I was raised and pushed higher up the wall by almost everybody in the office. I wanted to shout but someone's pincers were pressed to my neck.

Sweet Betsy from the records department took a bottle and broke it upon the human's desk and she brought the sharp broken end of the bottle close to my face ""Listen here Gilvox. You have a loud mouth so I just need you to nod if you understand. Not speak, nod."" She said and I nodded. ""The human is important to all of us. The human brings us coffee.""

""Yes, without the coffee, we can't function. It's as simple as that."" Another employee said.

""He's the only one who can brew the damn thing you see, so we need him to continue working here. Not quiting, not being fired. But forever working here."" A Fijloid said, flipping a barbed tentacle at my groin.

""Not that he works or anything. We handle all his work for him, his only task is the coffee. As long as the steady flow of coffee continues, all is well within this company."" A Remesian said, its floppy tongue that drips acid was inches from my naked arm. 

""The coffee must flow!"" A Polisadrian said while poking my side with what was unmistakably a pocket knife. 

""Do you understand?"" Sweet Betsy asked, broken bottle pressing to my cheek.

I nodded. 

""What will you tell the Boss?"" The human asked. He sat in his chair with two employees flanking him. He looked like a damn king as the rest of the workers held me down for his pleasure. The pincers at my neck relented and I could take in a shaky breath. 

The Fijloid touched my groin again with its barbed tentacle. ""What will you tell the Boss?"" It echoed the human's words. ""You Tetromites can't lie.""

They all moved to skewer, strangle, poke, grope and prod me so I screamed out. ""I'll resign! I'll resign!"" And I meant it. Instead of letting me go I was carried away from the human's cubicle  over the heads of everyone. I watched as the human sat there, a menacing smile on his face as he poured himself a mug of coffee that he brought to his lips until he was hidden from view by the mob of workers. They carried me outside the building and flung me onto the road.

""Don't come back here tomorrow or we'll kill you."" The Jerrocian said while twisting open his flask of coffee.

None of this works for me.

I‚Äôm week 3-4 right now on carnivore for the second time. Last time it was the same.
I haven‚Äôt pooped for like 1-2 weeks. 
I‚Äôm like 2 weeks off 2.5 mounjaro which helped me a lot. I did that for 6 weeks but then started carnivore and the digestion got too slow.

-> you may say mounjaro was the issue, but this happened to me last year on carnivore diet when I‚Äôd never tried mounjaro and was extremely pure in terms of any medications.

When I do poop, it‚Äôs so dense, hard, dry and wide and my anus bleeds and is so painful for days after.

I‚Äôm currently experimenting with betaine HCl + Pepsin but am only on around 350mg per meal and about to double that tomorrow.
(I was previously HCLF vegan for 6.5 years aka sugar diet. Trying carnivore on and off for the last recent year - stopped being able to digest food on vegan)

Anyway the constipation feels dangerous. I feel I have a lot of poop in me but no urges to go, and no movement.

I‚Äôm on day two of taking osmolax twice daily but nothing is happening.

I have Metamucil that I haven‚Äôt tried yet and not sure about it.

I‚Äôm on carnivore due to gut inflammation and mood which is helping soooo much. But the constipation doesn‚Äôt feel safe.

I‚Äôm hoping the HCl will help me absorb nutrition that deficiency could be causing poor gut mobility and stomach acid level etc.

I don‚Äôt eat dairy. Rarely. Small lac free latte maybe 2-4 times a week and cheese every 2 weeks cos it doesn‚Äôt even taste that good and makes me feel so inflamed.

What should I try now? Vegetables? I don‚Äôt want to get anxious again or eat sugar cos I have ADHD binge eating issues and will need Mounjaro to get back on carnivore. (Trust me I need that shit I‚Äôm not being a baby my mood swings get so intense)",1,1749034137.0,carnivorediet,23,0.67,False

I've always had my eyes set on the Bambino Plus and a separate grinder. However I was wondering what the difference exactly is between the Bambino Plus and Barista Touch. What can the latter do what the Bambino can't? 

My main usage is just for making milk based espresso coffees (Flat White). Any difference between the machines when it comes to espresso?

1l32bs3,https://www.reddit.com/r/sleeptrain/comments/1l32bs3/i_feel_like_im_starting_to_have_my_life_back_a/,I feel like I'm starting to have my life back a little bit,"I was too scared to do sleep training as I didn't want to hear my baby cry, and so I opted for a very very gentle method. My baby only contact naps but sleeps in next to me cot at night once she's in a deep sleep (usually hold her for 20ish mins before putting in a cot).

I have started my super gentle sleep training by placing her in her room cot once she's in a deep sleep and supporting her through when she was linking her sleep cycles (stroking, picking up if that didn't work). Sometimes she sleeps on her own for up to 90 mins, sometimes I have to support her. 

I got to a point I wanted to stop contact napping, whilst I will really miss it, I am ready to have some of my life back. Yesterday, I took advantage of her being very tired and placed her in her cot. She fell asleep within 30 mins and had a 30 min nap. Today, I placed her in her cot again, after 25 mins, she needed a bit of stroking but fell asleep almost instantly with some support and had 35 min nap. I know these are small steps but I just wanted to share my approach for those who don't feel comfortable with CIO approach. It's possible, it'll just take time. Yesterday I watched telly with a volume and today I had a coffee in peace in our conservatory, these are my small wins that makes it worth it.

My current baby schedule is approx 2/3.5/3.5 ww but it depends, sometimes she needs a 3rd nap (due to regression and teething). She wakes up at 8.30am and goes to bed at 7.30pm and if no issues I.e. regression, teething, she tends have her last feed 2130pm, then 9am ish. She wakes up once as she very recently dropped her 3am feed but falls asleep with some support.

1l32bnb,https://www.reddit.com/r/adultery/comments/1l32bnb/wish_exap_a_happy_birthday/,Wish exAP a happy birthday?,"My exAP and I were involved for about a year. He was in an open relationship which at times involved tension at home and a jealous SO. From March to April, he was also overwhelmed by work, putting in 60‚Äì80 hours a week. On April 13, he sent a message saying he felt I was jealous, that he felt suffocated, and no longer looked forward to our dates. He wasn‚Äôt sure if these feelings came from our dynamic or from the pressure in his home life. He said he didn‚Äôt want to hurt me.

I had already noticed him becoming more distant before that message. That‚Äôs when I started asking for reassurance and honesty. After his message, I gave it 20 days of space, without contact. Then I reached out briefly to wish him a good holiday. He responded kindly and suggested we meet for coffee if we wanted to talk more about what happend when I started to talk about it. After that we had some light conversations, but then communication faded again. That silence gave me the clarity I needed: I didn‚Äôt want to be treated like that anymore. The idea to end it had already been growing during the 20 days apart, especially because that time brought me peace.

Eventually, I called him and calmly said I wanted to end things. He agreed it was the right decision and said he‚Äôd still like to be friends. I told him that wouldn‚Äôt be possible in the short term. I‚Äôve since removed him from my social media, though I haven‚Äôt blocked him. I suspect he might have an avoidant attachment style.

Now, a month has passed without contact. His birthday is coming up soon, and I find myself wondering: should I reach out and wish him happy birthday, or is it better to stay silent and protect my own healing? 

Part of me still cares, and I don‚Äôt want to close the door completely. I think I know what to do but I need to hear it again. ",0,1749033728.0,adultery,9,0.5,False

1l32846,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1l32846,Can you help me take care of a cute Mediterranean house gecko that decided to live in my kitchen? (and bonus pics),"I noticed it three weeks ago in my kitchen.

They are not native here (Milan, Italy), but they are native elsewhere in the country, so I guess climate change is expanding their habitat.

I tried to see if it wanted to leave by opening the window and/or the mosquito net, but every time I do it gets startled and scuttles further indoors.

It has been exterminating all small arthropods, I see no more insects or web spiders. Only jumping spiders seems to survive (probably because they are diurnal and can avoid the gecko).

I found 5 gecko poops so far (3 indoors in hidden corners, and 2 outside my window but inside the mosquito net), so I guess it's eating something.

Every night I leave a small amount of water near the window (in a tiny coffee plate), and every now and then I see some diluted ""dirt"" floating in it, so I assume it's drinking.

My questions:

* I live on the 7th floor: does it really like living in my apartment, or should I try to relocate it outdoors on the balcony or the external walls?
* Soon I will have to leave for one month: how long could it survive by itself without me accidentally letting insects/spiders in by opening and closing windows, leaving some water, etcetera? (In case I can instruct my mom to replenish the water, and/or open the windows every some days)
* Can I build a convincing nest and entice the gecko to use it as preferred hiding spot, instead of hiding and pooping behind furniture?
* Will it ever stop being scared of my presence? I noticed it's tolerating me more and more without hiding, but I cannot approach it at all.
* Is there a way to tell if it's male or female from afar?",5,1749033366.0,geckos,1,0.86,False

1l326ef,https://www.reddit.com/r/mindHacksToday/comments/1l326ef/announcing_my_calmunderpressure_trick_mastering/,Announcing my calm-under-pressure trick: mastering the art of micro-breaks,"So I had this realization recently that when I'm stressed out and my to-do list looks like a novel, I kinda hit a wall and get all frazzled. Then I started taking these intentional 'micro-breaks'. üßò‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è It sounds fancy, but it's really just stepping away for a sec‚Äîlike standing up and stretching or staring out the window for a minute. 

Here's what clicked for me: it's based on this psychological concept that our brains need quick resets to process info more efficiently. It felt counterintuitive at first (like, seriously? take a break when I'm drowning?), but it's been amazing at keeping me less on-edge. Instead of going straight panic mode, I pause, breathe, and come back way clearer on what needs to happen. Sometimes I even trick myself into enjoying these tiny pauses with a sip of coffee or petting my cat. üò∏ 

I mean, we're all juggling a bunch of stuff, right? Might as well make it a little easier on ourselves. Time pressure was really kicking my butt before, but turns out, a few seconds away can really rewire your approach. Anyone else tried a similar trick or is it just me finding zen in chaos? üòÇ",8,1749033188.0,mindHacksToday,0,1.0,False

My plan:

* Trying to maintain streak for decaf on my iPhone's calendar and downloaded NOCAF app for motivation and auto streak management¬†
* Staying super hydrated
* Planning to sleep¬†A LOT this¬†first week
* Stocked up on herbal teas and electrolytes
* Taking¬†time off from¬†intense workouts for now

I recently became the manager of a small coffee shop solely due to me being at the cafe for the longest while other managers left or were fired. My boss doesn't offer advice because he says I'm the manager, and I need to decide when to put my foot down. We have an employee who was originally hired to help when our old manager disappeared off the grid, but she was then turned into kind of a barista interior designer, to help improve our shop. I don't like being harsh on people, as I don't want the work environment to be toxic, and she's older with more experience than me, so it feels wrong. She does small things that irk me, like constantly forgetting to count the till money after her shift, coming into work when she's not on shift, and telling me to do it when I open, telling me to my face she's ""not here to make coffee,""  ,stacking dishes hazardously, putting knives and ceramic mugs together on shelves to dry, and throwing knives in the sink. Last time we were on shift together, I stuck my hand in the sink to wash dishes, and a knife went under my nail. I explained that it's a hazard, and she repeatedly did it anyway. Whenever I message her about these things, she doesn't respond. I don't want to be harsh, but it's frustrating to spend 20 extra minutes while opening just to unclutter her mountain of dishes.

**Chapter 1 The Hot Stranger**



MONALISA 



I walked down the rainy and lonely path leading home, not caring about the rain pouring down my body and wetting me up in a way my boyfriend could never. 



My boyfriend had just broken up with me and I was heartbroken, perhaps not very much so but it did hurt me. His reasons? I never responded to his touches well enough and never melted in his arms like I should. 



He claimed I never let him touch me enough too. Just once I had let him hug me¬†and his remark? I was stiff as a board. 



That was just a week ago and today he had broken up with me, giving me one advise... To become a nun for the rest of my life as I was too insensitive to a man's touch. 



I was mad at how much he had shamed my body. I knew that was not entirely my fault. It could not be my fault. 



I had to be attracted to some type of people but I had no idea what type of people I could be attracted to. At a point, I had thought maybe I wasn't straight but that wasn't the case. 



I was straight but I was just not physically attracted to¬†my now ex boyfriend. 



""Forget about¬†him!"" I muttered, almost angrily and stopped at the gates that led into my home. 



The lights were out and that was a little bit weird as I was sure that mum should be inside. Brushing it off with a guess that she went somewhere and was caught up there because of the rain, I proceeded into the house. 



My father was dead, long dead in fact. I was just 6 when he died and if it wasn't for the pictures I stare at constantly, I would probably not even recall what he still looked like. 



After my father's death, things had gone south for a few years until we suddenly moved into this huge beautiful estate. Mum said it belonged to Dad's friend who had found out about our state. 



I had never seen him, never even heard his voice but he was the owner of the estate and also the one sponsoring my education. I pushed the door open after unlocking it with my thumb print and walked into the living room. 



It was dark inside with only a small lamp turned on but almost immediately, I sensed the presence of someone in the living room. I looked towards the sofa and I was shocked to find a man sitting on the sofa. 



He was shirtless and the only fabric on him was the towel wrapped around his waist. As much as the first thing I wanted was to scream at this strange man in our house, I could not. 



I found myself tongue tied. His abs were visibly well built and those biceps and triceps, they made my insides churn with excitement! 



His tanned skin looked so smooth, so well taken care of and my gaze trailed slowly to his face. He had a stern look on his face but that didn't take one bit or gorgeousness away from him. 



I could see his blue eyes as he raised his head up and his eyes met with mine making my heart jump. 



That was one weird feeling. I had never felt my heart react like that to my ex boyfriend. 



""What are you doing?"" He spoke. His voice so magnetic, that it sent a shiver down ¬†my spine¬†like an electric current running through my body! With just this man's voice. 



It was little wonder though. His voice was deep and in all shades, masculine. It was hot!



""Get over here already, I am not so patient,"" he added in that same voice and I feel a surge of heat run all over my body¬†again. But this time I tried to reason, who was this man? Why was he in my home? And why was he calling me over?



But strangely, I could not reason. His voice was authoritative and I could not help myself from doing just what he said. I walked over to him, my heart thumped in excitement. 



I was definitely going crazy! And out of my mind too! But this also... It also felt good.



**Chapter 2 He Is Lucius Devine?!**



MONALISA 



So it turned out I wasn't insensitive to a man's touches. I was just insensitive to my ex boyfriend's touches!



The man got up to his feet,¬†and there he stood like a Greek god itself, in all glory. 



Suddenly we both heard the door click open and realising that could be mum, I hurriedly jumped¬†away from him. 



""I will get back to you,"" he said to me, making obvious our height difference. 



I wasn't short. I was 5'7 but this man had to be at least 6'3 or 6'4. 



""Lisa?"" Mum called as she turned on the lights of the living room. 



""Mum,"" I replied with an awkward smile, tucking my wet hair behind my ears. 



""Lisa??"" The man called my name in surprise and turned to face me. 



""You are Lisa?"" He asked me but I remained silent. The fact that mum wasn't panicking meant that she knew this strange man. 



""Yes, Mr. Dina. This is Lisa, my daughter. I see that the both of you have met already,"" mum smiled at the man. 



I heard him curse roughly. 



""Is there anything wrong? Was she rude to you?"" Mum asked and faced me. 



""Were you rude to him?"" She asked with a scolding expression. 



""Don't scold her, she wasn't rude to me at all,"" the man replied. 



""Oh, I am glad. Lisa, meet Mr. Devine, your father's friend who has been helping us out for years,"" mum said to me and my eyes widened. 



The man¬†I just did some indescribable things with was my father's friend!!



What.¬†Have.¬†I.¬†done?!



**Chapter 3** 



MONALISA



""Lisa, greet him and show your appreciation,"" mum whispered to me, clearly irked by my attitude. 



I turned to face him squarely with a smile on my face and stretched my hand out for a handshake which he took, hue big hands covering mine made me feel small and yet... Desired. 



'Lisa! It's a handshake!' I scolded myself mentally. 



""Nice meeting you...""



""You can just call me Lucius,"" he cut me off and swears, the fact that mum was standing in the living room with us didn't change the effect this man's voice had on me. 



My gaze dropped to his¬†lower part of body¬†for a second, but I looked away as soon as possible, raising my head up to look at his blue, mesmerising eyes. 



""Nice meeting you then, Lucius. Thank you for your help,"" I thanked him and pulled my hand out of his immediately. 



I was crazy and I needed to be away from this man like right now! Without spending another second, I grabbed my handbag, pulled my hand away from his and sprinted out of the living room. 



""Lisa!!"" I heard mum call my name but I paid no heed to her and just sprinted to my room. 



I shut the door behind me, breathing heavily. Not just because of running but because of what had just happened. My first taste was my father's friend who had been helping us all these while. 



But why had he called me over to do that? Seeing the surprised look on his face, he had definitely mistaken me for someone else. Perhaps he had thought I was the¬†woman¬†he had paid for to come over? That could only be the case based on the words he had said to me. 



But why was he here? And why was my body reacting to him so much? 



These questions were however not the most urgent thing at the moment. 



I reached for my door and locked it, to ensure that I kept mum out of my room. 



My hand reached for my wet clothes and I pulled them off my body hastily along with my panties. I dumped them on the clean, tiled floor and pulled my phone out of my bag. I had to get myself¬†to climax. I desperately had to finish. 



I got on my bed and played a video I had on my phone. I started to touch myself.



""Oh god"" I moaned. 



With my eyes shut, I could see myself in place of the girl in the video,¬†I had also replaced the image of the man in my head, it was him, my father's friend. 



""Oh heavens! Yes,¬†daddy!"" I cried out and that was my undoing as I came hard, my body bucking and shaking terribly. 



I had just had the best experience¬†my 'insensitive' body had ever known and that was because of my father's friend. 



I was so¬†done!



LUCIUS



I ran my hands through my dark hair, my jaw clenched as I thought over what I had done earlier. I was now in my own home and though only a few rooms had been cleaned up, I had to make do with it for now. 



Lisa's mum, Stella had meant for me to stay over at their own home. She had also told me that she would not be coming home that night and I would have the house to myself until tomorrow when I would have my mansion appropriately cleaned up. 



To release my jet lag and to warm up on such a cold night as this one, I had called my friend to send a woman over to me but how could I have been that silly? 



How would the woman¬†I asked to come over be able to open the door herself?



But it definitely wasn't entirely my fault, Lisa could have simply told me who she was and nothing would have happened between us but she just did it as I ordered. 



""Gam√≥to!"" I cursed roughly underneath my breath. 



She clearly had no experience and that most probably was her first time but she made me¬†felt so good. ¬†



""Nah, Lucius."" I groaned and got up on my feet. I was thinking too far already. 



What happened tonight was a grave mistake that I had to ensure would never reoccur in the future. Lisa should be like a daughter to me and nothing more. 



It was terribly wrong to think about Lisa, a young lady who should be like a daughter to me while jerking off but I could not help it. 



Just this once. I would do it, thinking about her just this once and I will never do it again. 



It was a promise I made to myself.



**Chapter 4 My First Man**



MONALISA



""Do you understand?"" Mum asked and I nodded in affirmation. 



""Yes, mum.""



""He is our...""



""Mum, I am going to be late for lectures. You have told me over and over again. I will be nice and respectful towards him.""



""Great. You're coming home tonight?"" Mum asked me. 



""I don't really know yet...""



""Don't waste your free time roaming about with your friends. Just come back home and stay with me, okay?"" She asked. 



""Alright. I will just come back home."" I replied and leaned in, kissing her on both cheeks before pulling away and biding her bye. 



I skipped out of the house with my bag in hand. It was a new day and I was trying my very best not to think about what had happened last night. 



Mum had told me he just returned to the country yesterday and was moving into the mansion opposite ours. 



I looked at the beautiful and huge mansion that was opposite our home and nodded firmly. To own that mansion and this entire estate, that man had to be a multi billionaire. 



I kicked the thoughts of him out of my head once more and headed to school. 



...



""Leon really broke up with you?"" Francesca, my best friend asked in a whisper. 



""Yeah, let's talk about it when class is over,"" I whispered back to her. 



""How could he?"" Francesca huffed and turned her attention back to the lecturer. 



The lecture was almost done and I could see that Francesca could barely wait for that to happen. In a couple of minutes, the lecture was concluded and the lecturer left class. 



""Tell me about it, Lisa,"" Francesca immediately turned to face me and I sighed softly. 



""He said I am too..."" I looked around. 



""Maybe we should visit the coffee shop and talk about this there,"" I said, getting up on my feet. 



Francesca did the same and we both headed to the coffee shop, with Francesca ranting about how she was going to rip Leon's body apart for breaking up with me. 



We finally settled in the coffee shop, ordered two cups of coffee and got ready to talk. 



""So, Leon said I am too insensitive to a man's touches and that I should just turn into a nun already."" I shrugged and drank a bit from my coffee. 



""What the?! He¬†thinks he is anything? He should be lucky that you agreed to dating him in the first place. He is way, way, way below your league,"" Francesca replied. 



""You know what? I have an idea,"" Francesca said as I dropped my cup of coffee on the table. 



""What idea is that?""



""You have to date someone else. Someone hotter than Leon. I bet it's his fault if you are not turned on while with him. Just find another guy who turns you on and...""



I could no longer hear what Francesca was saying as her earlier words repeated in my head. 



'Another guy who turns me on...'



I could only think of one person. The one person I should not even be thinking of. 



""Lisa? Are you even listening to me?"" She knocked on the table and I jolted back. 



""Yeah? Yes, I am. I am listening."" 



""Doesn't seem like so. Are you that heartbroken about the breakup?"" Her face turned soft and emotional. 



""Not really."" I mumbled. 



""Of course, you wouldn't be that hurt. You guys only dated for like three or four months in fact, right? But you spaced out, what were you thinking of?"" Francesca asked. 



""Nothing. Nothing at all,"" I replied, not wanting to think back at last night. 



""I can introduce you to a new guy. He is smoking hot! One of the hottest guys in college at the moment!"" She said to me. 



""Really?""



""Yes. I am sure you are going to drool¬†at just the sight of him,"" Francesca giggled. 



""I hope so,"" I mumbled. 



""I will introduce you to him tomorrow. Get ready to lose that v card in the sweetest way possible, Lisa.""



...



""Mum, do I really have to go give him these cupcakes?"" I asked mum with a grumble, clutching onto the plate of cupcakes in my hands. I was back home and after mum's long lecture, I was about to give cupcakes to Lucius Devine.



""Yes, Lisa. We need to be as nice as possible to him for letting us stay here for this long and financing us big time. He is like a father to you, okay?"" Mum asked me and I just pressed my lips into a thin line. 



""Fine, it's just giving him these nicely and respectfully. I will do just that,"" I replied her and walked away. 



It was obvious that mum was very much grateful to Mr. Devine and yeah I was grateful too but I could not help but feel nervous and awkward, going to give cupcakes to him. 



Immediately I got to the gates of his home, I was stopped by a few men in black suit. They had never been around before and they were not the guards of the estate whom I knew pretty well. 



""I just live right there."" I said to one of them, pointing back at our place. 



""Your name, Miss?"" He requested. 



""Lisa."" I replied simply and he moved away from me to make a phone call. 



A few seconds later, he was back. 



""Please go on in,"" he said to me. 



""Thank you."" I mumbled and walked in, wondering why this man needed so many men to guard his place despite the amount of security the estate itself had already. 



I shrugged it off and stopped in front of the door. I drew in a deep breath and let it out before reaching for the door handle. The door clicked on its own and I pushed it open. He must have opened the door. 



I walked into the mansion that was simply breathtaking. He had just arrived in the country, right? So how could he furnish this place so well already. 



'He is a billionaire, Lisa!' I reminded myself and stopped in his living room. 



""You're here."" I heard his deep, attractive¬†voice. 



Pardon me for using the word attractive¬†but I just could not help it. It was the truth!



I looked towards the direction of the voice and saw him walking down the stairs and as if with an intention of tempting¬†me, he was without a shirt. 



All he had on was a grey sweatpants and I tried not to look at those intricately shaped abs but I failed at trying as I stared at it so obviously and then my gaze dropped and I tried again. Believe me I tried not to look down at his body¬†but I did anyways and I could see the outline of his bulge. 



""You are staring inappropriately, Lisa,"" he said and I quickly looked away, feeling my cheeks heating up. 



I pressed my thighs together quickly and looked the other way. 



I continued looking the other way until I felt him close to me, close enough for my nostrils to draw in the scent of his cologne. 



I swallowed hard and turned to face him. 



""Hello Mr. Devine,"" I flashed him an awkward smile. 



""My mum asked me to give these cupcakes to you. She just made them and..."" I pressed my lips into a thin line, not knowing what more to say. Standing by this man had taken the words away from me. 



""Last night was a mistake. I took you for someone else and as much as I do not know why you played along, I still want us to forget it. Like it never happened."" he said to me and I moved two steps away from him, to be able to speak better, away from all of that... Sexiness. 



""I didn't mean to play along and I am usually not like that..."" I didn't know why I felt a need to clarify. 



""Last night just happened. I wasn't in the right state of mind and I am glad things didn't go any further than it did,"" I glanced back at his lower body, unable to help it. 



""Lisa, my eyes are up here,"" he said and I quickly looked back up at his face. 



""I want to make things clear between us. You will be like a daughter to me and I will be like a father to you."" He said and immediately he said those words, I could only think of one other word...



Daddy. 



I don't know if that thought was innocent or downright wrong¬†but my blabbering mouth let out some silly words. 



""If you are like a father to me, then I can call you daddy?"" I asked and heard him groan deeply. 



The next second, he had yanked me closer to himself, making the plate of cupcakes in my hands drop and before I could even do anything... Which I wasn't actually trying to do anything tho. 



He had bent down to my height and took my lips in his and! His lips fitted mine perfectly. 



This wasn't my first time kissing but it was my best time kissing! I had heard tales of girls getting weak in the knees while kissing but not once had I felt that but with this man who was way older than me, I felt my knees giving way. 



His lips brushed mine hard and with a tinge of possessiveness, his arm around my waist pulling me even closer into his body!



Throwing caution into the air, I moved my arms to his broad, strong shoulders and kissed him back but¬†surely¬†did he dominate the kiss, his tongue lashing out against mine. 



After letting out a soft moan into the kiss, I heard him let out a low, deep growl¬†and¬†the next second, he pulled away from the kiss and held my chin up with his right hand while his left hand remained on my back. 



""Don't never¬†call me daddy next time,"" his hand squeezed my back¬†and ignoring the serious look on his face, I moaned again. 



""Gamo, get out,"" he pulled away from me completely and turned away. 



But I wanted more from this man. ¬†



I wanted him to be the first man to take¬†me.",1,1749032859.0,Hot_Romance_Stories,0,1.0,False

I‚Äôm going to Trondheim for an exchange semester from August to December and I‚Äôm currently trying to find a place to live ‚Äì ideally a shared flat. I‚Äôve been checking Hybel and a few other sites, but it seems pretty tricky to find something short-term just for one semester.

So I wanted to ask: Does anyone have tips on how to best go about this? Are there other websites worth checking out? Or any advice on how people usually find short-term housing in Trondheim?

Also ‚Äì if anyone happens to know of a room opening up and wouldn‚Äôt mind a chill and tidy flatmate  who‚Äôs into hiking, coffee, the occasional bar night... feel free to reach out üòÑ

Thanks in advance for any tips or recommendations!",2,1749032800.0,trondheim,6,1.0,False
