1hjvq32,https://www.reddit.com/r/TrueOffMyChest/comments/1hjvq32/i_finfp_had_a_date_with_a_boy_istj_ive_only_known/,I (f/infp) had a date with a boy (istj) i've only known for a week. ,"For the context, he came from Greece and has been in this country for only two months, no passpoort, not ackowledged with the language. 

Despite the fact we matched really well, had a few phone calls, I ended up liking his personality a lot, still, the meeting did feel way too rushed. We live like 30 minutes apart so we decided to have a first date yesterday,, and to watch a movie together, cuz of the excitement and stuff. I guess he was intenting to make use (?) of the activities we were planning to do, because he was just overly clingy in the chat, told me things like ""cuddle when we meet"" and ""I will wait for you forever"", though I always emphasised that I probably need a year to decide if he is the one for me, which he didn't respect. 

Anyways, I went to him, he picked me up, and drank some coffee together at a crowded café he suggested. Suddenly, after about hour of talking, he made the move to call someone and had a conversation in his own language. Afterwards, he hung up and, told me that his little brother does not have his keys, and he needed him to open the door. So he called the movie off, in that instant, as well. Even though I was surprised, I wasn't naive enough to believe I told him it's fine and that family is important. The fact he had the audacity to call off a date with a girl, cuz he wanted to help his little brother with keys..it speaks for itself, right? And I do not like confrontation at all and accepted the fact that the date therefore lasted three hours, as unexpected. 

If anyone has any clue about what this means (to ISTJ's), because I'm the worse at at it, lease let me know. I'm still in doubt, cuz his behavior in chat completely changed. From very clingy, to dry-and-you-could-help-me texts. My brain just concludes this as an another experience to help him own his passpoort. Idk..

1hjvptj,https://www.reddit.com/r/gastricsleeve/comments/1hjvptj/drinking_water_too_fast_pouch_stretching/,Drinking Water Too Fast? Pouch Stretching?,"Reposting this to hopefully get an answer:



Hello all.

I got the sleeve done almost 5 months ago and I've done well so far. Have lost about 65 pounds, only regained during one particularly bad week and I've never had any bad reactions to food or thrown up or anything like that.

However, I've run into a problem, and that is my water intake. I used to drink water in chugs pre-op. Like, I would drink an entire water bottle within one minute and then do another right after. I'd do this two or three times a day to make sure i got my water intake. Of course, with the sleeve, that's not really possible. However, I have been drinking water faster than i probably should now. I'll drink a full water bottle in about 20 minutes. I take a drink of like 3 ounces and wait a minute or two and then drink again. It doesn't really hurt or anything, and the only sign I ever get to slow down is that I'll start burping(and this rarely happens), and I slow down after that. It's the only way I can get all the water intake I need. If I drink water the way I drink everything else (takes me like an hour and a half to drink my morning coffee), I'd never get enough in my system.

Does drinking water this way stretch the pouch? I have been doing it to make sure I'm on track and I don't really feel any pain from it, but was wondering if this will hurt me in the long run and stretch my pouch out.",1,1734862032.0,gastricsleeve,0,1.0,False

I have been single and on bumble for a year now. I use to pick up  girls from the bar/clubs when i first became single. Now i want something serious and to settle down. I joined bumble a year ago to look for dates hoping to turn into something serious. This entire year i matched with tons of women and they never said a word back to me after i made the first move. I have yet to have a conversation from a woman from bumble until 4 days ago. (Side note i work with all men at my job and i am in some after work activities but with all men in them. I live around all seniors and families)

So i matched with this beautiful woman who lived close to me. She was the 1st one to not only make the first move but to actually talk to me on that app. We matched in the morning and texted the entire day until that night. I called her and we talked for hours until the middle of the night. We had so much in common and did not want to stop talking to each other. After doing about the same thing the next day i said ""ok we have to meet up, you sound like such a great person i would love to meet you."" So i asked her out on a lunch coffee date for Saturday. She said she would love to and was really excited about it. I got really excited and texted all my friends saying ""guess who finally has a date?"". I told them all about her and they said ""man i hope it goes well for you, i can tell you really like her"". I really was so excited and could not wait to meet her. We talked nonstop until the date, both by text and then by Voice call.

Saturday afternoon comes and i arrive at the coffee shop an hour early. I sit on my phone and go on social media and play a few phone video games waiting for her. Finally the hour gets here and i sit in the coffee shop and wait. 30 minutes go by and i wonder ""where is she?"". I take my phone and go to text her ""hey i am here, are you running a little late?"" 
and push send. I get a notification back saying ""message could not be delivered."" I said ""oh no"" out loud. I went to bumble and pulled open her profile and she unmatched me. I sat there for another 30 minutes trying to process what happened and felt so sad i almost wanted to cry. I hang my head down low and finally walked out of the coffee shop in a sad state.

1hjvokl,https://www.reddit.com/r/booksuggestions/comments/1hjvokl/looking_for_semi_specific_mm_books/,Looking for semi specific M|M books,"Realized recently im really big on books about guys crushing on (and then usually getting with) another guy who’s closeted. Carry On (MC discovers he’s into guys as he spends more time with the secondary protagonist), Heartstopper (gay guy crushing on a suspected straight classmate who discovers he is bi), Coffee Boy (queer trans man crushing on a guy and slowly realizes he’s into guys too), Wolfsong and Bear Otter and the kid where the MC slowly realizes he’s bi (although more into books where the MC is known queer and it’s about the discovery of the other guy), even of note are several Sherlock Holmes fanfics where Holmes is into Watson and Watson slowly discovers he is bi, or reveals to Holmes he’s bi as well. I think as a queer guy this sort of dynamic is super relatable. Would even be down for gay guy crushing on a guy who turns out to be straight and they still become close friends (I haven’t read any like this and would be curious to see it done well).


I’m really into books that can center a romance  but don’t totally feature the romance as the main plot, if that makes sense. Like how Carry On is more about the Chosen One trope, or how House in the Cerulean Sea is about unjust systems and magic in addition to the romances. I do enjoy romance genre stories but they really have to be incredibly strong plot and character wise, and many to me feel like romance/sex just for the sake of it (only my opinion!)",1,1734861858.0,booksuggestions,0,1.0,False

I've looked for this on and off when it pops into my head over the last 20 years, but haven't had any luck so far.

Basically, it was a short segment about Iceland, shot in Iceland, and narrated by an Icelandic person. The thing that stuck with me is this sentence sentence, something like ""[In Iceland] we have more bands than families"". (Families meaning two parent households where both parents are married to each other. I'm pretty sure there was something about the high divorce rate/low marriage rate also earlier in the segment ) If I remember correctly, this narration was played over a clip of some teenagers in a garage holding guitars/standing behind a drumkit and not playing. I think the whole thing was about why music was so important to Icelanders. 

The most likely time I wouid have seen this was somewhere between 1999 and 2001 during Dawn Patrol in the early morning, I watched it every day as I got ready for school (and I have a distinct memory of discovering the video for Blur's Coffee & TV from there). I'm basing this on the fact that both Sigur Rós and Björk were releasing acclaimed high concept videos in '99 AND Coffee & TV was also a 1999 release, so it's most likely from 1999 or 2000. It could be slightly later because I watched MTV pretty regularly through the early 2000s for Daria and through the TRL era. But from what I remember of the clothes, it feels more 90s. In the previous post, someone responded that the clip was familiar to them as well and agreed with the time frame. 

I'm 99% sure it was MTV, but I also watched a lot of Nick and VH1 as well in that era, so it might be from one of those channels, but the vibe of the clip was very MTV.

Any ideas? I'd also be interested any recordings of MTV music blocks people know of from that era to watch and try and find it.

In December, on my actual birthday (Friday), he said he needed to visit someone who had an accident, and I was fine with that. The next day, Saturday, I finished work at 12 PM, hoping he’d spend time with me, maybe just coffee, but he didn’t make an effort. I didn’t complain, but he assumed I was upset about him visiting his friend or something else.

I was busy and exhausted that weekend (video car shoot work, a marathon, and Caribou), but I explained my fatigue. However, he suddenly became cold and distant. I confronted him, saying his silent treatment wasn’t acceptable, but he dismissed my feelings, saying there are “bigger problems in the world.”

We argued a lot, and I clarified that I wasn’t upset about minor things like him visiting his friend or the gifts. It was the lack of effort on Saturday and his cold attitude that hurt me.

# Why did you choose this coffee for the Advent Calendar?

“Johan visited this farm last year, just when this coffee was harvested and could see all the work that was involved in creating this micro-lot. Boyce Harris, the owner, has got two neigbouring farms – Chania & Oreti – and on Oreti there is a plot of pure very old SL28 trees. They were planted by Boyce grand-grand-parent in early 20th century (the farm has been run by the same family since 1904). And the trees have been given fruit ever since. Even though these old trees are not very productive, Boyce continues to take care of them as a part of the family´s legacy. And because the trees produce an amazing coffee. We have been begging to buy this coffee ever since we first tried the coffee in 2018, but this is the first time that we got a chance to actually get our hand on a very small volume.”

# How to brew this coffee

Are you looking for simple yet powerful ways to improve your health and well-being? One of the easiest changes you can make is to incorporate drinking water into your daily routine. This often-overlooked habit comes with a treasure trove of benefits that can significantly enhance your quality of life.

### The Importance of Staying Hydrated

Water makes up a large part of our body, and staying hydrated is vital for our physical and mental health. When you drink enough water, you can boost your energy levels and improve your concentration. On the flip side, even slight dehydration can lead to fatigue and headaches. Making water a priority can help you feel your best.

### Top Benefits of Drinking Water

- **Supports Healthy Skin:** Hydration plays a crucial role in maintaining skin elasticity and a healthy glow. Drinking enough water can reduce dryness and flakiness.
- **Aids Digestion:** Water helps break down food so your body can absorb nutrients. It also prevents constipation by promoting regularity in your digestive system.
- **Regulates Body Temperature:** Sweating is the body's way of cooling down, and water is essential for this process. Proper hydration helps maintain a stable body temperature.
- **Increases Energy Levels:** Fatigue often sets in when you're dehydrated. Staying hydrated helps keep your energy levels up, so you're more alert and ready to tackle the day.
- **Promotes Weight Loss:** Drinking water can help control appetite. A glass of water before meals can make you feel fuller, which may help you eat less.

### How to Incorporate More Water into Your Routine

Now that you know the benefits, you might be wondering how to drink more water consistently. Here are some tips:

- **Flavor Your Water:** If plain water is boring, try adding fruits or herbs like lemon, cucumber, or mint for a refreshing twist.
- **Keep Water Accessible:** Make it easy! Always have a water bottle or glass within reach at your desk, in your bag, or by your bedside.
- **Replace Other Drinks:** Whenever possible, swap sugary drinks, sodas, or even some teas with water. You'll reduce calorie intake while reaping hydration benefits.
- **Set Reminders:** Use your phone or sticky notes as a reminder to drink water throughout the day.

### Signs You Need to Drink More Water

Pay attention to your body. Here are some signs that might indicate you need to increase your water intake:

- **Thirst:** This is the most obvious sign, but don’t wait until you're parched to drink.
- **Dark Urine:** Light yellow urine is usually a sign of good hydration, while darker shades may indicate dehydration.

- **Fatigue:** Constant feelings of tiredness can often be remedied with just a little more hydration.
- **Headaches:** Frequent headaches can sometimes be tied to dehydration.

How Hydration Influences Your Energy Levels
-------------------------------------------

When you feel tired and sluggish, have you ever considered how much water you've consumed lately? Staying hydrated is crucial for maintaining your energy levels throughout the day. Water supports various bodily functions that directly influence how energetic you feel. Let's dive into how hydration can power up your energy levels.

### The Role of Water in Energy Production

Your body needs water to perform essential functions, including the production of energy. Every cell in your body requires water to metabolize nutrients. When you don't drink enough water, your body struggles to convert food into energy. This can lead to feelings of fatigue and lethargy.

Studies show that even mild dehydration can impact your stamina and focus. So, ensuring that you're adequately hydrated is the first step in combating tiredness.

Understanding how dehydration affects your body can help you appreciate the need for proper hydration:

- **Decreased Cognitive Function:** Lack of water can impair your brain's ability to function. This may result in poor concentration and slower thinking.
- **Fatigue:** Not drinking enough water can lead to general tiredness, as your body works harder to perform daily activities.
- **Reduced Physical Performance:** During exercise or physical tasks, dehydration can crank down your strength, speed, and endurance.

Every time you skip hydrating properly, your body pays the price in energy levels and overall performance.

### Signs of Dehydration

Recognizing the signs of dehydration is crucial for maintaining your energy. Here are common symptoms:

Discover the Secret to the Best Infused Water for Health and Weight Loss – Click Here: https://fastingonwater.com/  
  
- **Set Reminders:** Use your phone or a timer to remind yourself to drink water at regular intervals.

- **Drink Before Meals:** Having a glass of water before meals can not only hydrate you but also help with digestion.
- **Monitor Your Intake:** Aim for at least eight 8-ounce glasses of water a day, and adjust according to your physical activity and environment.

By integrating these practices into your daily life, you'll notice a significant boost in your energy levels.

- **At Work:** Staying hydrated can help keep your focus sharp. Take a hydration break during meetings or while working on tasks that require your full attention.

Proper hydration into your routine is not just about quenching your thirst; it's about supporting your body's energy production mechanisms.

The Role of Water in Weight Management
--------------------------------------

When it comes to weight management, one often overlooked ally is water. Many people focus on calories, macronutrients, and exercise routines, but the role of hydration is vital for overall health and effective weight management. Let’s explore how incorporating water into your daily routine can aid you in maintaining a healthy weight.

Discover the Secret to the Best Infused Water for Health and Weight Loss – Click Here: https://fastingonwater.com/  
  
### The Importance of Hydration

Your body is made up of about 60% water, and staying hydrated is crucial for every system to function properly. When you're well-hydrated, your body can efficiently process nutrients, burn fat, and eliminate waste products. Conversely, dehydration can lead to feelings of fatigue, confusion, and irritability, making it more challenging to stick to a weight management plan.

### How Water Affects Appetite

Drinking water can help control your appetite and reduce calorie intake. Here’s how:

Discover the Secret to the Best Infused Water for Health and Weight Loss – Click Here: https://fastingonwater.com/  
  
- **Feeling Full:** Water takes up space in your stomach, which can signal fullness to your brain. That can help curb unnecessary snacking and overeating.
- **Confusing Thirst with Hunger:** Sometimes, your body confuses thirst for hunger. Staying hydrated can prevent you from eating when all you really need is a glass of water.

### Water as a Metabolism Booster

Studies have shown that drinking water can temporarily boost your metabolism. When you consume cold water, your body expends energy to warm it up to body temperature, which may slightly increase the number of calories you burn.

### Healthy Alternatives

Choosing water instead of sugary drinks is one of the simplest changes you can make to assist with weight management. Here are some reasons to swap beverages:

Discover the Secret to the Best Infused Water for Health and Weight Loss – Click Here: https://fastingonwater.com/  
  
- **Less Sugar:** Sugary drinks can pack on calories quickly, contributing to weight gain. Water, on the other hand, is calorie-free.
- **Hydration Without Additives:** Water hydrates without artificial colors, flavors, or sweeteners, making it a healthier choice than sodas and juices.

### Promoting Activity and Energy Levels

Proper hydration enhances your physical performance. When you’re well-hydrated, you can exercise longer and with greater intensity, which is essential for burning calories. Plus, being hydrated helps prevent fatigue, meaning you’ll have the energy to stay active throughout the day.

### Water Into Your Routine

Water into your daily routine can be straightforward and enjoyable. Here are some practical tips:

Discover the Secret to the Best Infused Water for Health and Weight Loss – Click Here: https://fastingonwater.com/  
  
- **Carry a Water Bottle:** Keep a reusable water bottle with you. This makes it easy to sip water throughout the day.
- **Set Reminders:** Use your phone or apps that remind you to drink water at regular intervals.
- **Infuse with Flavor:** If plain water seems dull, try infusing it with fruits or herbs. Cucumber, lemon, and mint can create a refreshing drink.
- **Drink Before Meals:** Have a glass of water before meals. This practice can help you eat less and feel full more quickly.

### Staying Consistent

To see the benefits of water for weight management, consistency is key. Make it a daily habit to prioritize hydration. Set specific goals, such as drinking at least eight glasses of water a day or increasing your intake based on your activity levels.

Water is more than just a thirst quencher; it plays a substantial role in weight management. From reducing appetite to boosting metabolism, the benefits of incorporating water into your daily routine are numerous and impactful. Make it a point to stay hydrated, and you may find it easier to reach your weight management goals while improving your overall well-being.

### Flavor Your Water Naturally

If infusing water doesn’t interest you much, try naturally flavored sparkling water or herbal teas. These options often provide a satisfying taste without added sugars or calories. Just make sure to check for any ingredients you may want to avoid.

### Replace Other Beverages

Identify the sugary drinks or other high-calorie beverages you might typically consume, such as soda or sugary coffee drinks. Make a conscious choice to replace these with water. Start small by substituting just one drink a day, and gradually you will find it easier to choose water in various situations.

### Be Mindful of Your Drinking Habits

By implementing these creative strategies, you can significantly increase your daily water intake while enjoying the process. Remember, staying hydrated plays a crucial role in your health, energy levels, and overall well-being. Make hydration a fun and essential part of your daily routine, and you’ll feel the benefits in no time!

1hjv6cn,https://www.reddit.com/r/u_createdjustforthi-23/comments/1hjv6cn/22122024/,22/12/2024,"I haven’t really journaled today. 

Here’s what I’ve written: 

* I feel and look like utter garbage today. What the f is wrong with me? WHY AM I SO ALLERGICKY? It’s uncomfortable and I look disgusting. 
* I’ve had INXS’s burn for you stuck in my head for much of today. Where did it come from? Like truly, *where*? It’s the first verse and the do do dodo do and then the tilt the hat chorus bit. 

And that’s it. 

Here’s some other things: 

* I came up to mum and dads today, dad came to pick me up which was very nice. We went for a coffee en route and also stopped at bunnings and I got some pots and plants for the other family members. They’re quite cute I think, they’re back up so if no one else brings a present for me then I can keep them :) 
* I feel so ugly.
* Puppy was so happy to see me and it made me feel really good. He’s so cute. Baby. I learned today he has basically model parents, his mama was a *champion* pedigree in the UK and his papa was a handsome working cocker, I’m deciding to picture them as a supermodel and some rakish country man. And out came my pretty lil prince. I wish I could get a photo that truly captures how sweet and gorgeous he is, none do him justice. 
* I made dinner tonight, it was bean wraps also with spicy chicken for mum and dad. And then all the extras like cucumber, spring onion, toasted sweet corn, capsicum and tomato (no thanks for meee) and sour cream. No avocado as they were all green. Anyway we turned them into a quesadilla/empanada hybrid thing as mum had them at her friends recently and said they were amazing so I wanted to try and it was delicious. 
* I’ve noticed I feel not heard or understood when it comes to my mental health things and my mum. My dad seems to get it, or rather he doesn’t assume anything. Whereas mum will chastise me for doing or not doing things and saying you have zero reason to not do this and it’s like well I do and I have told you idk how many times? But I don’t say that and just say yeah okay or something. I understand her point, just because I struggle doesn’t give me an excuse, but also if I can barely handle myself then don’t f’ing chastise me for not having my niece over for sleepovers and stuff? Like yeah I should be more present with them, I know this, don’t keep talking about it to me. I’ve tried to tell her how I have issues with some things and it’s hard to do things but I feel like she doesn’t get it or she doesn’t even try to. I don’t expect her to understand, but she just doesn’t show any attempt majority of the time. Like what else am I meant to say, that I’ve had periods of my life where I’m just consumed in thinking and planning how I don’t want to be here anymore? It’s none of her business? It’s not anyone’s business? And I shouldn’t have to use that to say I’m not okay. If I say it just f’ing BELIEVE ME? It just sucks because I don’t find opening up easy, and so for her to disregard everything I’ve told her because it doesn’t fit what she chooses or wants to believe makes me feel not listened to, not cared about and ultimately it makes me feel like what I feel isn’t valid. And that’s a huge thing I have come to terms of, because the past ten + years I haven’t considered my feelings valid, and through therapy I’ve learned that it’s okay to feel the way I do even if I have no ‘reason’ as such to. So for her to disregard it all, idk it makes me upset. I just don’t see the point in trying to be open if she isn’t going to be mindful of it. I’m not asking to be coddled nor do I want it to be an excuse to not do things, but equally respect the fact that I do not think and live the same as you? I sound like a drama queeny spoilt brat don’t I. And already I’m going back to thinking how maybe she’s right and the way I feel isn’t valid and I am just being a pathetic weak girl.
* I have so much to do in the next two days. So much for “holidays”. A small selection of things to do? Hang paintings, tidy up the garden, clean, take a *bunch* of stuff to the back area of the garden, supermarket shopping for Christmas Day, present shopping for the kids as my parents haven’t done it yet and someone has to, move the furniture around in the living room, hang Christmas lights, help prepare Christmas Day food like the salads etc. And I still have to make Christmas cards for mum and dad and get my brother a present etc. It’s just a lot. And I feel *disgusting* with this allergy stuff and uncomfortable and I don’t want to do any of this and I bet $1000 part of this “allergy” thing is stress related because stress comes out physically for me sometimes and dbsgsjsgsjsgsbsgs. And mums working next two days so she can’t help much. Dad will help but there’s only so much he can physically do at a time because of his heart stuff so it then falls to me. It’s fine and it is what it is but I don’t even want Christmas Day, I’m dreading it, so it’s like all this work for something I’m anxious over and dreading. It’ll be fine, but still. 
* I feel sick with guilt over not getting Andy’s presents to him. Complete and utter failure. I know we’re doing Christmas in January and he’s so unbelievably sweet for that, it lifted a lot of stress from me, but I still feel like I can’t even get presents to him on time, can I do *anything* right? 
* Speaking of him, he’s so cute? And hot? He was talking to me about fridges this morning as he needs to get a new one and at one point I was so distracted thinking about him all over me with that insane voice of his right in my ear. I think a lot about him kissing and biting my neck lately, idk why, it’s not like I’ve watched twilight. I said that sarcastically but also let’s be real here shall we? Anyway he’s so HOT SHSGSJSGSJSG. Truly the luckiest girl. I hope he gets a good deal on a fridge. 
* I think slice of heaven has to be the most kiwi sounding song of all time. That and footrot flats, but they go hand in hand don’t they.
* This eye allergy thing is so annoying but at least the rest of my skin is playing nice at the moment. I feel so ugly. Like an ogre.

The big man met with business owners, volunteers and leaders in the wider Toronto community to discuss issues that impact business, people and communitarian practices in the area. A lot of them expressed disappointment that the Government didn't bother doing a budget this term. Winston agreed - very disappointing! SAD!

10am - Winston drove down to Rexdale to his former high school - Monsignor Percy Johnson Catholic High School. Winston posed with students and teachers following an impromptu assembly that the Big W spoke at. He then hit the griddy with the school mascot, it was very epic

12.30pm - the Big W met up with the local Tory volunteers who were canvassing the streets to ask for people's thoughts on the current Government under the leadership of former Deputy Prime Minister Yapper. He then took them out to lunch afterwards at the Queen and Beaver pub where he heard feedback about the happenings of the morning - lots of volunteers told him about how dismayed voters were with the fact that the former Deputy Prime Minister had still not taken up the mantle of a Prime Minister, given he has thus far done nothing to justify that salary - even Drebin with that terrible name of his did that - isn't it funny how Drebin now calls himself Dr Frank after we pointed that little fact out? Everybody thought it, Drebin's a terrible name. What is he even a doctor of anyway? Does he have a doctorate in mediocrity with a minor in resignation? lol.

2pm - Winston joined his volunteers in door-to-door canvassing, literally everybody he met with expressed interest in donating to his campaign because of how much Toronto hates the Liberal Government. 

5pm - Following doorknocking, Winston and his team went on down to the Etobicoke Civic Centre which Winston had booked out to deliver a town hall address to the local community. A transcript of this address will be published separately. Following this, Winston took questions from the community which was met with a great deal of engagement.

7.30pm - After shouting the team a cheeky kebab the Big W went down to the CN Tower where he went live on CFRB Newstalk to outline why he joined the Conservative Party and some of the big debates he participated in throughout the last Parliamentary term. He spoke at great length about this Government's attack on the public service with their ridiculous cultural and sensitivity mandatory requirements and about how this is really unnecessary for teachers and nurses just trying to get by and make a living while giving back to their local community, he suggested that if the Government actually cared about these people they should lend some thought to giving them a bloody payraise instead of adding on to their increasingly cumbersome workload.

9pm - Winston went back to his campaign HQ where he brought in several kegs and got on the beers with his volunteers to mark the beginning of a successful campaign. He gave a short address thanking them for their commitment today and for their commitment to come, and promised many more lighthearted chances to let their hair back and network amongst themselves throughout the campaign.",1,1734859308.0,ElectionsCMHoC,0,1.0,False

I take 20 plant based supplements a day (quercetin, resveratrol, curcumin etc) for a year, and 7 prescription medications started throughout the year, to manage the ‘mystery condition’ until figuring out it was mould last week. 

Great Plains results: Ochratoxin A: 51.23, Aflatoxin B1: 12.24, Citrinin: 85.74, Sterigmatocystin: 4.12

Diet protocols i have tried/am looking to combine:
- Vegan (4+years)
- limited processed food (3 years)
GOT SICK HERE
- did try low FODMAP and no sugar for 6months but to ill and developed sensitivities to that diet so stopped
- Low-histamine for MCAS (1 year), gluten-free (6months)
- no citrus in the day (4 months bcs of adhd meds)
And now considering the addition of
- low mould contamination (citric acid, contamination lists?)
- low amylose (admittedly not researched yet)
- low refined sugar/ simple carbs (rice and popcorn are like the only food that doesn’t give me anxiety these days)
- low pesticide (organic and avoid dirty dozen)

I am especially concerned about limiting spices as that seems impossible and excessive - do they really matter that much?

My safe foods for the past 6months are huel, protein bars, oatcakes, coconut yoghurt, flax seeds, apples, tofu, rice, carrots, broccoli, THIS isn’t chicken, THIS isn’t bacon, pistachios, cashews, ricecakes, dark chocolate, lots of coffee, salad and veg excluded from the above categories, edamame or buckwheat pasta

Any advice at all would be appreciated I’m just scared to eat at this point.

Great news for drivers in Dubai! A new two-lane bridge has just opened on Hessa Street, and it promises to make your daily commute a lot smoother. This impressive 1,000-meter structure connects directly with Al Khail Road, which is crucial for easing the flow of traffic in the area.

One of the standout features of this new bridge is the dramatic reduction in travel time. What used to take about 15 minutes can now be done in just 3 minutes, saving precious time for both residents and visitors.

================================

When it comes to our furry companions, we often delight in their playful antics and the unconditional love they bring into our lives. However, one thing can certainly put a damper on all that joy—bad breath! If you've ever found yourself wrinkling your nose at your dog's less-than-pleasant mouth odor, you might be asking, ""Why does my dog have bad breath?"" Well, you're not alone, and understanding the reasons behind that stinky smile is more vital than you might think.

In this extensive guide, we’ll delve into the myriad of causes behind your dog’s foul breath, from dental dilemmas to dietary decisions. We’ll also offer some tips on how to tackle this problem effectively and improve your pup's oral health. So, grab a cup of coffee, settle in, and let’s embark on this informative journey together.

1. Common Causes of Bad Breath in Dogs
--------------------------------------

Now, before we dig deeper, let's take a moment to consider what might be causing your dog's breath to smell like a dumpster fire. After all, understanding the root cause is half the battle. Here are some common culprits:

### 1.1 Poor Dental Hygiene

Just like humans, dogs need regular dental care. When brushing and vet check-ups slide down the priority list, plaque and tartar can build up, leading to a host of problems. Bad breath can be one of the first signs of dental disease, which can be quite serious if left unchecked.

### 1.2 Gum Disease

Gum disease (or periodontal disease) is another significant cause of bad breath in dogs. It typically arises from the accumulation of plaque, leading to inflammation and infection. Imagine how bad our breath would be if we had inflamed gums!

#### Signs of Gum Disease:

- Bleeding or swollen gums
- Chewing difficulties
- Excessive drooling

### 1.3 Diet and Food Choices

What you feed your dog can play a role in their breath. For instance, feeding them low-quality kibble or tables scraps may contribute to the problem. Sometimes, even certain treats designed for freshening breath can backfire if they contain poor-quality ingredients.

### 1.4 Health Issues

At times, bad breath can signal issues beyond dental health. Conditions such as diabetes, liver disease, or kidney problems might be the hidden cause of your dog's stinky chompers. It's crucial to pay attention to any accompanying symptoms like lethargy, changes in appetite, or excessive thirst.

2. The Role of Oral Care in Foul Breath
---------------------------------------

Now that we've explored some of the common causes, let’s talk about how maintaining good oral hygiene can be a game changer. Regular brushing and dental check-ups are essential to keep that foul smell at bay. Whether you're a pro at handling a toothbrush or a rookie just starting out, every bit counts.

### 2.1 Brushing Your Dog’s Teeth

You might feel apprehensive about brushing your dog’s teeth, but fear not! With the right approach, it can be a breeze. Here's how to do it:

1. **Choose the Right Tools**: Get a pet-safe toothbrush and toothpaste. Don't use human toothpaste as it can be harmful to dogs.
2. **Start Slowly**: Let your dog sniff and taste the toothpaste before diving in. You want them to associate this process with something pleasant.
3. **Brush Gently**: Use small circular motions and focus on the gum line. Don’t rush it; just make it a part of your routine.
4. **Reward Them**: Just like kids, dogs respond well to praise and rewards. Give them a treat (that’s safe for dogs) or some extra belly rubs afterward.

### 2.2 Regular Vet Check-ups

Taking your dog to the vet for regular dental check-ups is key. Vets can perform professional cleanings, check for gum diseases, and advise you on specific dietary needs for your pup’s breed.

3. Alternative Solutions for Dog Breath
---------------------------------------

If you’ve tried brushing and it hasn’t done the trick, don’t despair! There are a variety of alternative solutions you can explore to freshen up that doggy breath.

### 3.1 Dental Chews and Toys

Consider investing in dental chews and toys that promote chewing. These can help scrape off plaque and tartar while giving your dog a little entertainment.

### 3.2 Water Additives

Water additives are another great option. Simply add them to your dog’s water bowl—easy peasy! They work by helping reduce bacteria in the mouth, offering a simple and effective way to improve oral hygiene.

### 3.3 Natural Remedies

Some pet owners swear by natural remedies. Herbs like parsley or mint can freshen breath; just be sure to research safe quantities and consult with your vet before introducing anything new into their diet.

4. Health Concerns Linked to Bad Breath
---------------------------------------

So, let’s return to that burning question—why is my dog have bad breath? Sometimes, the answer lies in underlying health conditions. It’s important to be aware of the signs that could indicate something more serious.

### 4.1 Diabetes Symptoms

Bad breath often associated with diabetes can smell sweet or fruity. Keep an eye out for symptoms like excessive thirst, frequent urination, and changes in weight.

### 4.2 Kidney Disease Indicators

When kidney disease is a player, the breath might take on a urine-like smell. Other warning signs include vomiting, lethargy, and a lack of appetite.

### 4.3 Liver Issues

You may notice a rancid odor if liver problems are involved. Look for symptoms like jaundice (yellowing of the skin or eyes), vomiting, and behavioral changes.

5. Preventive Measures for Fresh Breath
---------------------------------------

There's no magic wand to wave away bad breath, but good practices can help keep it at bay. Prevention is always better than cure!

### 5.1 Balanced Diet

Proper nutrition is key. Feed your dog a high-quality diet that meets their specific needs. Talk to your vet about appropriate options for your breed and age group.

### 5.2 Hydration

Ensure your dog has constant access to fresh, clean water. Hydration helps wash away food particles and bacteria potentially causing bad breath.

### 5.3 Regular Exercise

Did you know that regular exercise can also improve your dog’s oral health? Physical activity promotes overall well-being, supporting a happy and healthy mouth.

### 5.4 Routine Dental Cleanings

We can't stress enough how crucial routine dental care is. Make brushing a regular part of your routine, and schedule those vet check-ups as recommended.

6. What to Do if Your Dog’s Breath Stinks
-----------------------------------------

If your dog’s breath continues to reek despite your best efforts, it's time to take action. Here's your game plan:

1. **Schedule a Vet Appointment**: If you suspect something’s off, don't delay in getting professional advice. A vet can diagnose underlying conditions that need treatment.
2. **Evaluate Their Diet**: Take a closer look at what you’re feeding your dog. Is it high quality? Do you see any correlation between their diet and breath?
3. **Try Alternatives**: Experiment with dental treats, water additives, or toys until you find what works best for your pup.
4. **Be Consistent**: Whatever measures you decide to implement, consistency is key. Stick with your routine and keep monitoring your dog's breath over time.

Conclusion
----------

In conclusion, bad breath in dogs can have several underlying causes, ranging from poor dental hygiene to serious health issues. Don't be disheartened if you find out your dog has a case of the stinky breath—understanding the root causes is the first step toward finding a solution. Regular dental care, proper diet, and routine vet visits can all contribute to fresher breath and a healthier, happier pup.

Remember, when you ask yourself, ""Why is my dog have bad breath?"" you’re not just seeking an answer; you’re embarking on a journey to better health for your furry friend. As they say, ""An ounce of prevention is worth a pound of cure.""

I went to a friends party over the summer and met a mutual friend and we chatted a bit about fitness as we both had in common — training for an upcoming race. I thought he was cute and found it attractive because he was fit but didn’t think much about these thoughts as I was still getting over my ex. After the party he found me on strava and since then in the last months, I’ve noticed how he consistently gives me kudos on all of my posts and will comment on them as well here and there esp on my big race achievements. I know strava is innocent so also didn’t read into it. Lately I had the thought of asking our mutual friend for his number, I’m usually pretty confident to ask people to hangout if I find them interesting whether in a friendship or romantic context and I now feel ready to start dating again, having gained closure of my last relationship. To my surprise I got a text from him recently where he said he asked our mutual friend for my number and invited me to his nye party and that if I’m in town I should come. I will admit I was surprised how he beat me to getting my number and I was a bit keen to hear from him. I responded how I’ll let him know if I can make it but also asked how he’s been and mentioned how I’ve been meaning to ask him about one of his hobbies that I’m thinking of getting into - as a means of starting convo and maybe them asking he wants to grab coffee sometime. Thing is he hasn’t responded to my text and now I feel like I’m overthinking whether he’s interested cause he prob would’ve responded more promptly if u would want to talk to someone! Also with this nye party, I’m a bit hesitant cause none of my mutual friends will prob not be there so I would be going into a party blindly besides knowing him - I am social and extroverted but will admit that as I get older (26F) I’m a little less keen about going to parties not knowing anyone.

1hjuk2u,https://www.reddit.com/r/HealthProductsNatural/comments/1hjuk2u/how_does_a_hydrogen_water_bottle_work_my/,How Does a Hydrogen Water Bottle Work? My Experience with the LifeWater Hydrogen Bottle,"Hydrogen water bottles have been popping up everywhere lately, claiming to make your water “smarter” and healthier. If you’ve ever wondered what they actually do—or whether they work—I’ve got you covered. After using the **LifeWater Hydrogen Water Bottle** for a few weeks, I’ve learned quite a bit about how these bottles function and what they bring to the table.

Here’s a simple breakdown of how they work and my experience using one.

# What is a Hydrogen Water Bottle?

At its core, a hydrogen water bottle, like the **lifewater hydrogen bottle**, transforms regular water into hydrogen-rich water using advanced technology. Hydrogen water contains dissolved hydrogen gas, which is believed to provide antioxidant and anti-inflammatory benefits.

This isn’t just about filtering water for purity. It’s about enhancing water to make it more beneficial for your body.

# How Does the LifeWater Hydrogen Bottle Work?

The **LifeWater Hydrogen Bottle** uses a process called **electrolysis** to separate water molecules into hydrogen and oxygen. Here’s how it works step by step:

1. **Fill the Bottle**: You add regular water to the bottle.
2. **Press the Button**: The bottle starts its process with a simple button press.
3. **Electrolysis in Action**: Inside, the **Solid Polymer Electrolyte (SPE)** and **Proton Exchange Membrane (PEM)** systems work to break water molecules apart.
   * The oxygen and other gases are vented out.
   * The hydrogen is infused back into the water, creating tiny nano-bubbles of hydrogen gas.
4. **Ready in 3 Minutes**: In just three minutes, you have hydrogen-rich water ready to drink.

The result is water that’s loaded with molecular hydrogen, which is easier for your body to absorb and provides a range of health benefits.

# What Does Hydrogen Water Do?

Hydrogen water is thought to:

* **Improve hydration**: It hydrates your cells more effectively than regular water.
* **Neutralize free radicals**: Acting as a powerful antioxidant, it helps reduce oxidative stress in the body.
* **Reduce inflammation**: This can be helpful for those dealing with joint pain or chronic conditions.
* **Boost energy and focus**: By improving cellular health, hydrogen water may help you feel more alert.
* **Support skin health**: Antioxidants in the water can promote clearer, healthier skin.

# My Experience with the LifeWater Water Bottle

I decided to test the **LifeWater Hydrogen Bottle** because I wanted to see if it would make a difference in my hydration and energy levels. Here’s what I noticed after a few weeks of consistent use:

1. **Better Hydration**: I felt less thirsty throughout the day, even when drinking less water than usual. It seemed like the hydrogen-rich water was more effective.
2. **More Energy**: My afternoons felt less sluggish, and I wasn’t reaching for coffee as often.
3. **Skin Clarity**: I noticed small improvements in my skin, which felt more hydrated and looked a bit healthier.
4. **Joint Comfort**: I deal with occasional joint stiffness, and while it didn’t vanish, it felt noticeably less bothersome.

# Who Should Try It?

The **LifeWater Hydrogen Bottle** could be useful for:

* **Fitness enthusiasts**: It’s great for hydration and recovery after workouts.
* **People with inflammation issues**: Conditions like arthritis or gout might benefit from hydrogen water’s anti-inflammatory properties.
* **Busy individuals**: It helps maintain energy and focus throughout the day.
* **Anyone curious about improving hydration**: It’s a simple way to try something new and potentially boost your health.

# What I Liked and What to Consider

**What I Liked:**

* **Easy to Use**: It’s straightforward—just fill, press a button, and wait three minutes.
* **Portable**: Compact and leakproof, perfect for on-the-go use.
* **No Maintenance**: No filters to replace or complicated parts to clean.

**Things to Keep in Mind:**

* **Price**: It’s more expensive than a regular water bottle, but you’re paying for advanced technology.
* **Charging**: The base needs charging every few days, which might not be ideal for everyone.

# Does It Work?

After using the **LifeWater Hydrogen Bottle**, I’d say hydrogen water works—but it’s not a miracle. The changes are subtle but noticeable. I feel more hydrated, energized, and overall better. It’s a small upgrade to my daily routine, but one that feels worthwhile.

The Benefits of Face-to-Face Learning for Children
--------------------------------------------------

When it comes to learning, children thrive in environments that are engaging and interactive. One of the most effective ways to nurture this aspect of education is through face-to-face learning. This form of learning offers numerous benefits that significantly contribute to a child's overall development.

My #1 Choice for Residual Income in 2025: https://freepage.pro/mylestonedigital/map-passive  
  
### Personal Interaction

In-person education allows children to interact personally with their teachers and peers. This interaction helps build strong relationships and fosters a sense of belonging, which is essential for a child’s emotional and social growth. Here are some key points regarding personal interaction:

- Develops communication skills.
- Fosters teamwork and collaboration.
- Enhances emotional intelligence.

### Hands-On Learning

Face-to-face learning encourages hands-on experiences that are often vital for understanding complex subjects. Children engage their senses in a way that’s hard to replicate through online learning. Here’s how hands-on learning makes a difference:

My #1 Choice for Residual Income in 2025: https://freepage.pro/mylestonedigital/map-passive  
  
- Experiential learning helps cement knowledge.
- Engaging activities keep kids interested.
- Real-world applications make subjects relatable.

### Immediate Feedback

One of the most significant advantages of in-person learning is the ability to receive immediate feedback from teachers. This timely feedback plays a crucial role in the learning process:

- Clarifies doubts quickly.
- Encourages children to ask questions without hesitation.
- Helps in adjusting learning methods based on individual needs.

### Structured Environment

In-person learning provides a structured environment, which is crucial for young children. The classroom setup usually follows a schedule that helps children understand time management:

My #1 Choice for Residual Income in 2025: https://freepage.pro/mylestonedigital/map-passive  
  
- Promotes discipline and focus.
- Reduces distractions that may exist at home.
- Encourages routine, which is important for young minds.

### Social Skills Development

Children learn the art of communication and interaction through face-to-face learning. Being physically present among peers allows them to develop crucial social skills:

- Effective listening skills.
- Conflict resolution through social interaction.
- Empathy towards others by understanding their feelings.

### Encouraging Creativity

In-person classes often involve activities like group projects, art sessions, and interactive discussions, which stimulate creativity. Participation helps unlock a child’s imaginative potential:

My #1 Choice for Residual Income in 2025: https://freepage.pro/mylestonedigital/map-passive  
  
- Presents opportunities for collaboration on creative tasks.
- Encourages diverse perspectives through teamwork.
- Boosts self-esteem when sharing ideas publicly.

### Physical Movement

Unlike remote learning, face-to-face educational settings naturally involve more physical movement. Transitioning between classrooms, engaging in physical education, or participating in extracurricular activities keeps children active:

- Improves physical health overall.
- Boosts concentration levels.
- Encourages a balanced lifestyle through activity.

Face-to-face learning creates a dynamic environment that benefits children not only academically but also emotionally and socially. The personal connections formed, the immediate feedback received, and the overall structured atmosphere foster comprehensive growth that remote learning often struggles to provide. As we navigate a world where learning methods continue to evolve, the importance of in-person education remains vital for nurturing well-rounded individuals.

Developing Engaging Lesson Plans for Young Learners
---------------------------------------------------

Creating lesson plans that engage young learners is essential for effective teaching. These plans should inspire curiosity and promote active participation. When kids find learning fun and relevant, they are more likely to absorb the information. Here are some tips to help you develop engaging lesson plans that capture the interest of young children.

### Understand Your Audience

The first step in designing an engaging lesson is to know who your students are. Consider their age, interests, and learning styles. For example:

- **Age:** Young children respond well to visual stimuli and hands-on activities.
- **Interests:** Use their favorite characters or activities to make lessons relatable.
- **Learning Styles:** Incorporate different methods, such as visual aids, auditory instructions, and kinesthetic activities to reach every child.

### Set Clear Objectives

Before you dive into the content, define what you want your students to learn. Clear objectives help in both planning and assessing the lesson’s success. For instance, instead of saying, “learn math,” specify “understand addition with numbers up to 10.” This clarity keeps your lesson focused and purposeful.

### Incorporate Interactive Activities

Young learners thrive on activity and interaction. Therefore, integrating games and group tasks can enhance engagement. Here are some interactive ideas:

- **Role-Playing:** Allow children to act out stories or scenarios. This makes learning memorable.
- **Hands-On Projects:** Create crafts or experiments. For example, building shapes from clay reinforces geometry.
- **Class Discussions:** Foster an open environment where children can share thoughts and ideas, promoting language and social skills.

### Utilize Technology Wisely

Technology into your lesson plans can greatly increase interest. However, it is essential to use it wisely. Consider tools like:

- **Educational Apps:** Use apps that are interactive and age-appropriate to reinforce learning.
- **Videos:** Short, educational videos can spark interest and aid in explanation.
- **Interactive Whiteboards:** They allow for fun, multimedia engagement, making the content lively.

### Maintain a Flexible Attitude

No lesson plan is perfect. Be prepared to adapt as needed. Some activities may not go as planned, or students may show interest in a different topic. Flexibility allows you to pivot and adjust your lesson in real-time. This keeps engagement high and respects the children’s natural learning pace.

### Incorporate Stories and Themes

Children love stories, and they can be powerful teaching tools. Using a central story or theme can tie multiple subjects together. For example, a unit on ocean life can involve:

- **Reading:** Books about marine animals.
- **Science:** Discussions on ocean ecosystems.
- **Art:** Creating ocean-themed art projects.

This kind of integration helps reinforce knowledge across different subjects by making connections.

### Assessment and Feedback

Assess the effectiveness of your lesson plans. Gathering feedback from students can guide you on what works and what doesn’t. Simple methods like exit tickets, where students can write a new thing they learned, can provide great insights. Also, don't forget to reflect on your teaching methods, as self-assessment is vital to becoming a better educator.

Developing engaging lesson plans for young learners involves understanding your students, setting clear goals, incorporating interactive activities, using technology wisely, remaining flexible, utilizing stories, and consistently assessing the effectiveness of your strategies. When children are engaged, they learn better, and creating absorbing lesson plans is key to fostering a love for learning.

Balancing Teaching and Personal Time: Tips for Educators
--------------------------------------------------------

Teaching can be a fulfilling profession, but it often comes with its challenges, especially when it comes to finding a balance between work and personal life. Striking this balance is crucial not only for your well-being but also for your effectiveness as an educator. Here are some practical tips to help you manage your time more effectively.

### Establish Clear Boundaries

One of the first steps to balancing your professional and personal life is to set clear boundaries. This means defining your work hours and sticking to them. Here’s how you can do that:

- **Limit After-School Work:** Choose a set time each day when your workday ends. This helps in curtailing the urge to bring home lesson planning and grading.
- **Create a Dedicated Workspace:** If you work from home, have a defined area where you conduct your teaching tasks, separate from your personal space.
- **Communicate Availability:** Let students and parents know your working hours. This encourages them to respect your time.

### Prioritize Tasks with a Planner

Using a planner can significantly increase your productivity. Taking time each week to organize tasks can prevent workloads from spilling over into your personal time. Consider these strategies:

My #1 Choice for Residual Income in 2025: https://freepage.pro/mylestonedigital/map-passive  
  
- **Daily To-Do Lists:** Write down the most important tasks you need to accomplish each day. Focus on them first and celebrate small wins.
- **Weekly Reviews:** At the end of each week, review what you accomplished. Adjust your plans for the next week based on this reflection.
- **Chunking Tasks:** Break down larger projects into smaller, manageable tasks. This can help reduce feelings of overwhelm.

### Incorporate Personal Time into Your Schedule

To ensure you get personal time, deliberately include it in your schedule. This can seem counterintuitive, but having set times for personal activities can be incredibly beneficial. Here are some ideas:

- **Schedule Breaks:** Allow yourself short breaks throughout the day. Even a 10-minute walk can refresh your mind.
- **Pencil in “Me Time”:** Reserve time for hobbies or relaxing activities in your calendar just like you would for meetings.
- **Connect with Loved Ones:** Make time for family and friends. Social interactions are crucial for maintaining your mental health.

### Delegate and Collaborate

You don’t have to do everything alone. Reach out to fellow educators and consider collaborating on projects. Here’s how you can delegate effectively:

My #1 Choice for Residual Income in 2025: https://freepage.pro/mylestonedigital/map-passive  
  
- **Share Resources:** Collaborate with colleagues to share lesson plans and resources, which can save time.
- **Involve Students:** Where appropriate, involve older students in peer-assisted learning. This not only benefits the students but also gives you more time to focus on teaching.
- **Utilize Parents:** Engage parents in classroom activities. They can assist with tasks such as organizing events or managing classroom supplies.

### Practice Self-Care

Your mental and physical well-being directly impacts your teaching effectiveness. Make self-care a priority by integrating these tips:

- **Get Enough Sleep:** Aim for 7-9 hours of restful sleep each night. A well-rested mind is more productive.
- **Stay Active:** Incorporate physical activity into your routine. Whether it’s yoga, jogging, or dancing, movement helps relieve stress.
- **Mindfulness Practices:** Try meditation or deep-breathing exercises to stay grounded and calm in your teaching environment.

Finding the right balance between teaching and personal time is not easy, but it is achievable with intent and care. By establishing boundaries, prioritizing tasks, and ensuring that you take time for yourself, you will not only enhance your quality of life but also your effectiveness as an educator. Remember, a happy you leads to a successful classroom environment!

I asked a girl out, but now I need some advice.","So I (M30) went to the pet shop with my (F21) roommate and ended up chatting to the store attendant, chatted for a while and shared pictures of our cats and some light jokes.
We left the store and I mentioned to my room mate that I thought the attendant was cute and my roommate convinced me to ask her out. My roommate wrote down my number on some paper and said girls prefer that so they can choose to message the guy.

We went back in the store pretending to need more things and I got chatting to the clerk again for pet toy recommendations. She suggested some and said she’d give me some time to think about it and went to the back of the store to with the other shop attendant. 
About 5mins later she came back out and she came over and asked what cologne I had on, I told her the brand and she sheepishly said “ok well I’m going to go over here now”
She hung around a little bit so I picked some cat treats and went over and asked if they were fattening for cats (dumb I know 🤦)
She said no and I said I had one more question.
I said “I really enjoyed talking before about our cats before and was wondering if you are seeing anyone at the moment?” she said no but she went though a break up a few weeks back. 
I asked her if she was open to seeing people at the moment and she said yes so I proposed a coffee date.

I’m not sure if this is where I fumbled, she agreed and said she was on instagram but not Facebook where as I have Facebook but not instagram. I then gave her the piece of paper with my number on it and said no pressure though (given that she’d not long broken up) and she took it and said she’d like to go out for a coffee and we can talk more about our cats and then said “well now I’m blushing”
We parted ways and I felt good about the interaction.

However, that was Friday afternoon and it’s now Sunday evening with no message. 
Was she just being polite? Should I have asked for her number? 
She’s the first girl I’ve ever asked out in person that isn’t from an online app so it’s unfamiliar territory for me.

I'm a university student trying to bounce back from a rough patch with depression, alcohol, and substance abuse. The struggle's real, especially with staying focused during study sessions. It's a pain having to read stuff repeatedly just to remember what it said. But bupropion's been a lifesaver—it really helps with focus and energy. Only bummer is I sweat bullets when I drink coffee, but I'm not giving up caffeine since I can finally feel its effects, thanks to bupropion.

But I'm not a bkfrapper, and jyhthat's not the lifestyle for me. Anyone know of supplements that help curb overall drug cravings? I've got my drinking under control, so that's one less thing to worry about.
