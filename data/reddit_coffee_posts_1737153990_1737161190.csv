1i3vhns,https://www.reddit.com/r/Crushes/comments/1i3vhns/should_i_ask_him_for_coffee/,should I ask him for coffee?,"I (22F) have worked with this guy (24M) for just over a year now and started developing a crush on him about 2 months ago. I don't have any ""for sure"" proof that he likes me or anything, just things like I catch him looking at me a lot, and my coworker/friend says she sees him hanging around me a lot and that he's never in my dept when I'm not working. but then he also will talk to just about anyone who's around EXCEPT me, like he'll strike up a convo with people a few feet from me and then talk for ten minutes without ever involving me, and he'll only talk to me when I start the convo, which is almost never longer than ""hey how are you"". So some days I feel like maybe he likes me and some days I feel exactly the opposite. 

anyway, I don't really want to buy into this too much in advance and would rather make a decision on whether to just ask him for coffee or to leave it alone and let this crush die on its own...

Drive out society, science and history

Thanks for the comments on my last post! (I don‚Äôt know how to share the link).

So, Wednesday morning, I was making my coffee, and Isa came to talk to me.
I already knew she would because Sally told me the day before that Isa wanted to talk.

Isa = the one who cries
Sally = admin assistant

It was super early, so we were the only ones in the office.
She apologized but also kinda tried to justify herself.
She said sorry for crying and explained why she acted the way she did. I just stood there listening.

She said she felt hurt because Sally and I know her, and the fact that we thought she was annoyed about putting Sally in CC upset her.
I told her, calmly, that it was the way she acted in my office‚Äîher gestures, her tone, and how she stormed out.

She admitted she wasn‚Äôt in a good mood üòë Then she goes, ‚ÄúYou could‚Äôve asked how I was doing.‚Äù
And I told her, ‚ÄúThat‚Äôs literally what we did, and look how you reacted!‚Äù
She apologized again and said she feels like she‚Äôs walking on eggshells all the time because she‚Äôs afraid people will react badly. Then she asked me not to tell anyone... All this over a CC üôÑ

Honestly, after 15 months of this, I‚Äôve really started wondering if she just doesn‚Äôt get how office/social stuff works.

First incident (months ago):
Isa thought she was getting too many emails and being CC‚Äôd unnecessarily. Instead of just talking to the person directly, she emailed 2 project managers, CC‚Äôd me, and their boss.
It ended badly. I straight-up told her, ‚ÄúWhy didn‚Äôt you just talk to the person directly?‚Äù
And to make things worse, those project managers were new.

100 incidents later, yesterday:

Isa was copied on an email (about a project that has absolutely nothing to do with her). The client was just following up with the project manager. Isa calls her boss and says, ‚ÄúI think Rosalia is having problems with her projects.‚Äù
Rosalia told me about it because I‚Äôm working on that project with her, and she was super upset.

I think something‚Äôs going to happen in the next 2 weeks. Isa already has several complaints against her, and she knows that if HR and the director meet with her again, she‚Äôs out.

I honestly don‚Äôt know if she‚Äôs doing this stuff on purpose or what. I‚Äôve told her so many times, ‚ÄúJust talk to the person first. Don‚Äôt go straight to the bosses.‚Äù If that doesn‚Äôt work, then go higher up.

This is her first job in the country since she was a student, so maybe that‚Äôs part of it, but... I don‚Äôt know.

Anyway, Thursdays and Fridays she isn't in the office, and honestly? I‚Äôm so relieved.

* Grinder: [Kingrinder K6](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B09WH9JKY1)
* Flair: Classic w/ [pressure gauge add-on](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B07N45CS8T)

* Tamper: [Boicafe](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B09FPPLVK4)

* Beans: [El Injerto Malawi Gesha from Elixr](https://elixrcoffee.com/collections/elixr/products/el-injerto-geisha-reserve-8oz)

Workflow:

1. Weigh 15g of beans
2. Grind at 38 clicks (2 clicks finer than the 40 mark, going counterclockwise from the ""zero point"" where it won't spin anymore). Sandy texture with minimal clumpage
3. Boil some water, preheat the Flair's chamber for ~30 sec after boiled
4. Pull a shot at ~6-8 bar for 25-30 sec, getting 28-33g out (fluctuates as I experiment) and lowering the Flair's lever most or all of the way
5. Taste and then mix into whatever milk drink I feel like

Espresso profile:

* Consistently present but minimal crema, usually around 2mm (~1/16th of the cup) layer at the top of the shot glass

* Some sharp-ish acidity, less-so as I've gotten my pressure right once I got the gauge but still distracts a lot from the actual coffee taste

* A tiny bit of the tastes described by Elixr for this blend but mostly just acidic and bitter

Notes:

* When I tamp the puck, I think I'm applying around 30lbs of pressure? I definitely press fairly hard and can feel the ""crunch"" of the grounds compressing. Also appears quite flat, and when I press lighter I get a tiny bit of coming up through the filter and turning the water in the chamber light brow. There's also 8-10mm of empty space above the puck after tamping

1i3vazl,https://www.reddit.com/r/Tik_tok_stories/comments/1i3vazl/a_niagara_vacation/,A Niagara vacation,"
 It was so terribly cold. Snow was falling, and it was almost dark, when out of the blue, my wife called me at work. ""We're going to Niagara Falls for the weekend. I got us an awesome deal!""

We had both been working at our first ""full-fledged"" jobs for a year and had reached that moment after graduation when you suddenly realize you can't make that impact on the world your student enthusiasm once promised. At first, I just sighed. It was the dead of January, and I had already expended all my energy on a week of inconsequential stress. I just wanted to collapse on the couch for two days. Sarah felt a similar weary exhaustion. I could tell. Her tone was more hopeful than excited, but she had dreaded the routine we were sinking into and was trying her best to pull us free.

I looked to the ceiling and adjusted my telephone headset. At that time I was working at Stats Canada on the tele-query desk. I took a deep breath and, as convincingly as possible, said, ""Sounds good."" I don't think she bought it, but we went nonetheless.

This was Niagara Falls before the casinos when there was a very distinct off-season. When we got to the hotel, we were given the details of our ""lovers' special"". One dinner to be used either Friday or Saturday, two breakfasts, a roll of tokens for the arcade, 10% off some ""4D"" movie ride experience, and a 2-for-1 coupon to Max Tussaud's. I guessed it was Madame's nephew? We also got a bottle of sparkling wine in our room and chocolate treats on our pillows. I was impressed. It sounded good.

When we got into our room and saw the ""bottle"" of wine - basically an aeroplane-sized glass and half - and the chocolates - ""fun wrapped"" Oh Henry's left over from Halloween - we both started to laugh. The tone for two wonderful days had been set. We decided to cash in on our dinner coupon right away.

The restaurant off the lobby had hopes of being better. There were huge panoramic windows that promised a view of the gorge. Unfortunately, they had some winter moisture problems that day, and it felt like we were defrosting amid the dripping streaks and foggy patches. The decor was your standard booths and tables though the ""romantic"" lighting was unique. Dollar store battery-powered tea lights were lodged inside thick tumbler glasses and shed a muted pleasantness in a ""what a great idea for a craft"" sort of way. I had a feeling they were created by our waitress since she was the one who always seemed to be fussing with them. Only one other couple was in the dining room, so she attended to us immediately.

""Can I get you something to start?""

""Sure."" ""Thank you, that would be nice."" We both responded simultaneously.

""And what would the lady like this evening?""

Sarah smiled at the flattery. ""I think I'll have a glass of white wine."" She glanced over at me to see my reaction. This was a subtle cue of the mood to follow. Diet Coke was usually the beverage of choice. She didn't normally drink alcohol. One glass numbed her nose and made her giggle far too easily. When she did drink, however, it meant she was comfortable with my company and open to anything to follow. I raised my eyebrows in a debonair way.

""And for the gentleman?""

""Do you have Foster's on tap?""

""Yes we do.""

""I'll have a pint please.""

Sarah smiled at the happy memories I invoked. At university, Foster's was my signature beer. It was at a time when Crocodile Dundee was a known name, and Australia was inexplicably cool. 15 cent buffalo wings and a pitcher of Foster's was the Tuesday night special at the London Arms pub. There the Classics Club would meet and, as a group, circle the wagons and drink ourselves into extroverts.

As soon as the waitress left, Sarah smiled at me. She reached out and held my hand across the table. With my gaze on hers, she slipped her foot from her shoe and slowly began sliding it up my pant leg.

""I got a pedicure this morning."" She announced seductively.

I nodded and pretended I didn't notice her invitation. ""What colour?"" I asked.

""I'm not telling."" She teased. ""You'll just have to find out later."" Her devious little smile was gorgeous.

""Mmmm. I can't wait.""

When the waitress returned with our drinks, we immediately retreated to our personal spaces as if we had been discovered by the chaperone. Sarah opened the menu and began to salivate at the variety.

""Can we add an appetizer to the package dinner?"" Her question seemed innocent enough.

""You're on the package?"" Our friendly waitress disappeared, and we were no longer a lady or a gentleman. She ripped the menu out of Sarah's hand and took mine before I had even opened it. She then scurried to her podium and brought back a tattered, grease-stained, photocopied page that we had to share. We both burst out laughing.

The waitress was flustered that we were not as bothered as she was. ""The drinks are NOT included!""

""What choices do we have?"" I asked, expecting the usual chicken or fish. I had been on many packages before with my parents.

""Coffee or tea."" The waitress snapped.

Sarah and I looked at each other in amused disbelief.

""I'll have coffee please."" I didn't even flinch at the ridiculously limited package. I was eager to get my order in early.

""And I'll have the tea!"" Sarah followed my lead. ""Can I have some milk with that?""

""Yes."" The waitress snarled.

""Fantastic!"" I enthused.

""Yes, great! I'm glad we got the package, Honey."" Sarah joked.

The waitress stormed off and returned sometime later with our lettuce-only salads drowned in Kraft's Italian dressing and our chewy chicken dinners, which she had thoughtfully allowed to cool. She tossed the plates on the table and left us to peacefully devour our deal. We didn't see her again until we requested the bill. For some reason, we found it amusing to leave a generous tip, which of course, defeated the purpose of the package, but we didn't care. It was fun.

The rest of the holiday was marred with similar off-season products and services. The wax museum was only half open, so we couldn't see the pop stars of the seventies. I didn't think it was a problem, but Sarah pouted playfully. She really wanted to see young Bowie. Meanwhile, the arcade was particularly stingy about spitting out coupons. So much so that Mike, the scraggly-haired repair guy, ended up escorting us from game to game and repairing the devices on demand. In no time, he was acting like an old drinking buddy. He joked and laughed, then, out of the blue, revealed that working at the Niagara Falls Fun Centre wasn't his career choice, that his dream was to be part of a travelling carnival. He desperately wanted to see more of the world, he explained and socialize with a greater variety of ""wildlife."" Mike winked at Sarah to punctuate his meaning, then began advising her on which games to play.

Sarah was partial to Skee ball and clearly had career potential in the sport, but Mike quickly pointed out that the token-to-coupon payout was not the best. In a furtive whisper, he revealed that The Storm Stopper was your best bet, provided the arcade had left it on its original factory settings. He assured us the ones here were ""cool."" The game had lights that ran around the outside in opposite directions and you had to hit the button at just the right spot to win. It looked impossible, but Mike was right; if you calculated tokens in versus coupons won, it was the best deal. It only took a little practice to win a minor jackpot every 5 or 6 times.

We would cheer each win as if Toronto had won the Stanley Cup. I would give a quick fist pump and a full lung ""Yes!"" while Sarah would jump up and down screaming, ""WhoooHooo!"" Of course, in the end, when we cashed in, ""Mike's secret"" only bumped us up from a key-chain flashlight to a ""deluxe"" nail beauty set. Mind you, it did come complete with clippers, scissors, a file AND a cuticle scraper. Not only that, it was all neatly packaged in a paisley-patterned pink and green plastic vinyl case. Mike was so pleased to give us our prize and to be honest, we were thrilled to win it if only to see his broad chicletted smile. It was more of a trophy than a grooming set.

That night, I made reservations for us at a fancy Chinese food restaurant - the Bamboo Garden. When we arrived, we had half-expected renovations of some sort. Instead, the place was immaculate. Gentle pools teeming with goldfish highlighted the epic black and red Ming dynasty decor. Real candles flickered on crisp white tablecloths. Again, the restaurant was virtually ours. The reservations on my part were entirely unnecessary. In fact, as soon as we entered, they knew us by name and guided us directly to our table. A live lounge piano caressed the air, its notes danced vaguely around familiar harmonies until finally, as if prompted by our presence, a song emerged immediately accompanied by the velvet voice of oriental karaoke.

1i3v70r,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1i3v70r,AIW for thinking you should be able to ask your partner anything as long as you‚Äôre okay with hearing ‚Äúno‚Äù,"I feel like I‚Äôm losing my mind. Throw away because I don‚Äôt want my past posts about this relationship to cloud this issue. I‚Äôm going to be as objective as I can.

My (32F) bf (38M) of 7 years just had a huge argument and likely will break up today. So! Today I had to run to my school/job for just an hour or so and normally I have to park pretty far and walk like 15 to get to my office. NBD but I thought that since my bf was home today and we were planning to go to the dog park right after, that I‚Äôd ask him if he‚Äôd be okay to just drop me off and pick me up from my building before the dog park. Went like this

Me: ‚ÄúDo you want to drop me off and pick me up so I don‚Äôt have to park?‚Äù (I don‚Äôt remember this verbatim because I didn‚Äôt know this would blow tf up but I often phrase questions this way. I know I was not demanding in my tone/words at all).
Him: ‚ÄúSure‚Äù
Me: ‚ÄúYou don‚Äôt have to, I would just have to leave 15 min earlier‚Äù (I 100% remember saying this AND I always qualify my ‚Äúasks‚Äù so he knows he can say no, because we‚Äôve had similar convos to the one that‚Äôs about to happen.)

Fast forward to time to go
Me: ‚ÄúReady Freddy?‚Äù
Him: no response that I can hear. He said later that he said ‚Äúyes‚Äù in response but I didn‚Äôt hear it and he didn‚Äôt move or otherwise acknowledge me for several moments. 
Me: ‚ÄúHellooooo?‚Äù (Silly tone but I do see how no matter the tone that could be rude)
Him: ‚ÄúI SAID FINE‚Äù (rudely)

Then, from my perspective, he threw a tantrum by saying that we couldn‚Äôt bring the dog for the one hour (either he would have been in the car with her the entire time or I suggested they walk around campus or go to one of the many nearby coffee/parks/bars/restaurants/etc. around campus). He said we‚Äôd have to come back for the dog which whatever, the school is less than 10 min from our house. He def seemed upset so I said ‚Äúyou didn‚Äôt have to take me but now I‚Äôll be late if you don‚Äôt, you could have told me you didn‚Äôt want to‚Äù. Then he went on and on during the ride that it was ‚Äúcommon sense‚Äù and he shouldn‚Äôt have to tell me. Defending myself that I can‚Äôt read his mind and he could have taken the dog for a walk or something just made him more hostile. 

Whatever, meeting and dog park done. He‚Äôs about to leave for his weekly MTG league after laying next to me playing on our phones for like an hour when he gets on me for losing a lid to his thermos that I don‚Äôt use (he also loses, misplaces, and forgets stuff all the time [ADHD] and I don‚Äôt so I was very confused at his accusatory tone and why he wasn‚Äôt relenting and is so convinced it‚Äôs me who lost it). He gets mad that I respond unequivocally that I know it wasn‚Äôt me instead of saying ‚ÄúI‚Äôll help you find it‚Äù or ‚ÄúI‚Äôll keep an eye out for it‚Äù. 

We spiral. I feel, and often feel, like he‚Äôll accuse me of something or attack my character or complain that I‚Äôm not doing something that I should be and when I use past experiences or other evidence to defend myself each statement gets challenged and when I defend that statement with evidence, that evidence gets challenged, and we end up somewhere far away from where we started. 

Anyways, this one ended up focusing on how I ‚Äúdon‚Äôt consider him or his day‚Äù when I asked for a ride. I, again, defended myself that he could have told me no or let me know he‚Äôs rather not. He says that I‚Äôm selfish and ‚Äúshouldn‚Äôt ask if it‚Äôs unreasonable‚Äù. He says I don‚Äôt do anything for him but he does a lot for me. He does do a lot for me but he either flat out diminishes what I do do (I‚Äôm the only one who cleans, I‚Äôm solely responsible for all of our social connection besides his once a week MTG game, I used to do bedroom stuff I didn‚Äôt really care for [but have since stopped], I clean up after him, finish his laundry, etc.). He‚Äôll say ‚Äúwell I don‚Äôt care about that stuff‚Äù as in a clean house or having social support or help nearby and he said he couldn‚Äôt appreciate the bedroom stuff because he can tell that I don‚Äôt like it so it‚Äôs not really ‚Äúfor him‚Äù if I‚Äôve told him I‚Äôm not into it and doing it for him‚Ä¶AND he says he shouldn‚Äôt have to ask for me to do anything specific because it doesn‚Äôt count if he has to ask. 

I told him and continue to say that I think anyone should be able to ask those close to them, especially their partners, anything in the world as long as they are sincerely okay with getting a ‚Äúno‚Äù. He says that he wants me to stop asking and is never going to ask anything of me and that if I ask him for anything that he‚Äôs just going to do it and that will make me selfish. I am unwilling to compromise on my opinion on this because I just think it‚Äôs so much simpler than all this crazy guesswork that he wants me to do and that I never seem to get right anyway. 

And here are some texts because OF COURSE it continued after he left. I‚Äôm def no saint in them but I said I was gonna try and be objective. The snoring stuff is because I can‚Äôt sleep in the same room as him and he refuses to try anything or talk to an expert to help it and tells me all of my proposed solutions don‚Äôt work without trying anything. 

AIW? I feel like he‚Äôs being so unreasonable and I‚Äôm sick of trying to baby him when I feel like he‚Äôs bullshitting me. Is he doing that thing that guys do when they say they want to be with you but are then purposefully impossible to be with to make the other one leave? ",1,1737160207.0,AIW,0,1.0,False

# Bryan Johnson's Don't Die Protocol: A Guide to Eating for Longevity  

The ""Don't Die"" protocol provides a straightforward blueprint for eating mindfully, emphasizing nutrient-rich foods and avoiding harmful dietary choices. This guide is built on three key pillars: complex carbs, lean proteins, and healthy fats.  

## The Foundation: What to Eat  

### 1. **Complex Carbs & Fruits/Veggies**  
The backbone of a healthy diet includes clean, unprocessed carbohydrates and vegetables rich in fiber and antioxidants. These support energy levels and overall cellular health.  
**Examples include:**  
- Berries  
- Root vegetables  
- Leafy greens  
- Cruciferous vegetables (e.g., broccoli, cauliflower)  
- Lentils and legumes  
- Whole oats, quinoa, and Manuka honey  

### 2. **Protein**  
Protein is essential for muscle maintenance and overall bodily function. The protocol encourages lean, high-quality sources to meet daily needs.  
**Examples include:**  
- Chicken and turkey breast  
- Fatty fish (rich in omega-3s)  
- Eggs  
- Whey and casein protein powders  
- Plant-based options like pea and hemp protein  
- Unsweetened yogurt  

### 3. **Healthy Fats**  
Healthy fats are crucial for brain function, hormone regulation, and controlling inflammation. Incorporating nutrient-rich fats is a cornerstone of the protocol.  
**Examples include:**  
- Extra virgin olive oil  
- Avocado  
- Nuts (e.g., macadamia, almonds, walnuts, hazelnuts)  
- Seeds (e.g., chia, pumpkin, flax, hemp)  
- Cocoa  

---  

## What to Drink  
Hydration is key, and the guide recommends sticking to simple, unsweetened beverages like:  
- Water  
- Coffee  
- Tea  

---  

## What to Limit  
Certain foods and ingredients should be consumed occasionally, as they might not align with optimal health goals. These include:  
- Red meat  
- Organ meat  
- Animal and dairy fats  
- Refined carbs like rice, pasta, and bread  

---  

## What to Avoid  
Some dietary items are best avoided entirely. These include:  
- Sugar and high-fructose corn syrup  
- Junk and fried foods  
- Processed deli meats  
- Artificial sweeteners like aspartame  
- Hydrogenated oils (e.g., corn oil, soybean oil)  
- Trans fats  
- Alcohol  

---  

## Adjustments for Individual Needs  
Dietary needs may vary depending on life stage and activity levels:  
- **Children:** May require higher carbs to support growth and activity.  
- **Older Adults:** Should prioritize protein to preserve muscle mass.  
- **Athletes:** May need additional carbs to fuel intense physical demands.  
- **People with health conditions (e.g., diabetes or kidney issues):** Should seek personalized dietary guidance.

""This place is like an hour from your house"" he said

""So?"" I replied.

This has happened on multiple occasions and it's always so funny to me. My favorite part is when the walk distance is 15 minutes and they think it's too much.

At the time, I (19F, lets call me V) was asked by my long-term friend (20F, lets call her Carol), to be the Maid of Honor in her wedding. For context, I was in college several hours away and was home on Thanksgiving break when she asked. I was thrilled for her and said I felt honored, but did ask if she was sure. This was not to be disrespectful, but because this was the first wedding I would ever be part of let alone, THE FIRST one I had gone to. Plus I was away at college 85% of the time. I expressed I wanted her to have the best wedding, and with me being away so much (and a broke college kid working 3 jobs) I wanted her to have the most attentive MOH and I was not sure I could give her that, leading up to her big day. For additional context her wedding was in July of the following year (7 months away). After explaining my concerns, Carol said she still wanted me as her MOH, and they would work with it the best they could. 

  
At first everything went well. The other bridesmaids (4 others) and myself got along, and created a group chat to talk all things wedding. Carol's soon to be sister in law (lets call her Paula, age 32) did a lot of the organizing and essentially took over the MOH duties. When I politely asked what MOH duties I could do, she told me to ""figure out"" the bachelorette party. I am very passive so I just started doing research. About a week later, Paula said in the group chat, she found an ocean front hotel at the beach that would be perfect for the bachelorette weekend. After reviewing the link, the price per person would be close to $700 for the weekend. As expressed before, I was a broke college kid working three jobs and the money I did make went towards funding food and bills at college. I asked if we could find something more budget friendly, and Paula said she already booked it and would be expecting payments from everyone. I did not respond to the chat and just decided to work extra to save for the weekend.

  
Two months before the bachelorette weekend, my family got word that our family member across the country had passed due to an illness. Her ""celebration of life"" ceremony was that weekend. This family member meant a great deal to me and the rest of my family. I reached out to Carol and explained the situation and she said she would completely understand if I went and missed the bachelorette weekend since it was family. I triple checked with her on this, and she said yes. After getting the brides approval, I used the funds I was saving up for the bach trip to buy a plane ticket to California for the service. The service was beautiful and I am glad I went. Afterwords, the bridesmaids, Paula and Carol were being very cold towards me. They stopped communicating in the original group chat with me so I heard next to no updates on things. However, Paula reached out once I returned asking when I would be paying her the $700 for my portion of the Bach trip.  I polietely told her I had to use the funds for my plane ticket, and I did not think it was fair to ask me when i got the brides permission and gave two months notice about not being able to attend. Paula went off about how she is unable to take her family on vacation due to my ""poor financial planning"", and how I should have been there to celebrate Carol instead. Paula even added she ""did not understand how close a family member can be when they live across the country from you. It sounds like an way out of paying your half for this trip"". I ended up not responding and just tried to do my best from there.

  
After two weeks of radio silence, Carol asked if I would make one of my famous desserts for her bridal shower (I have a pastry background with my family). I said sure, but since I was tight on funds I could do it if she just paid me for the cost of ingredients ($30 for a dessert for 70 people). At the shower, none of the bridesmaids would look at me, let alone talk to me. I was confused but I did not want to ask or start any issues at an event for Carol. Carol's mother asked me to note who got Carol what gifts, so i took a seat near to log all the items. That is when I noticed Carol rolling her eyes every time she told/showed me the gift and who got it for her. Again, it was her event I thought best to keep my head down and just do what I was told. Afterwords, Carol told me to get the money from her mother for the dessert (which was a huge hit). Carol's mother seemed surprised when I told her what she said, but gave me the funds and I left. It was at this point Paula sent me a scathing text about how tacky it was asking for funds from the brides mother for a dessert that should have been complimentary from the MOH.

  
It was at this point I informed Carol about what was occuring with Paula, and the cold shoulder I felt from everyone. I apologized again about missing her Bach trip, but I thought we were okay after I addressed it with her. She just stared blankly at me and gave no real response other than okay so now what? I asked if she wanted me to drop out of the wedding party or just as the MOH since it appeared I was being slowly iced out. I was trying my best, but it is hard to do that when nobody is communicating with me, and on the rare occassion they were it is very short and cold. I told Carol, Paula has been trying to do MOH duties since the begining it seems, and I did not want to step on any toes I just wanted Carol to have the best wedding day possible. She told me she still wanted me as the MOH she just wanted me to be more attentive. 

  
The day of the wedding I was attentive and got Carol anything she needed. I even brought coffee and some food the morning of while the girls and myself got ready. While waiting my turn to have hair and makeup down, I decided to help Carols mom set up the decorations in the reception space. When I came back I overhead Paula, Carol and the other bridesmaids saying things like ""V ruined the entire wedding experience for Carol with her lack of attentiveness"", ""I cannot believe she actually showed her face here today. No amount of makeup is going to cover up her ugliness on the inside"", and the worst yet was from Carol saying ""V has some nerve showing her face here today. She just can't take a hint on what a bitch she is and that I don't actually like her anymore"". 

  
I wanted to cry after hearing this. I asked so many times if she was sure about me being the MOH or even in the wedding. We were friends for 8 years and had been thick as thieves at one point. I thought we were close enough to talk to eachother about issues, and I had tried to be there the best I could. For some reason, I still decided to be there for her and not cause a scene with my absence or by addressing the issue. I made the decision then I would be there for her for her day unless she told me otherwise. I knew her mom would flip if she saw me leave and I just did not want any confrontation. The wedding went off without a hitch, she married her sweetheart and I stayed in the background unless told otherwise. I helped her  clean up the venue and said as little as possible which was for the best because every time I was near her she was glaring daggers into me. After her wedding, a fellow bridesmaid showed me the second group chat that was made and what was said. It was essentially the same things as before, mocking my intelligence, appearance, and calling me a bunch of words I would rather not repeat. At this point I just blocked Carol, Paula and the other bridesmaid (all but the one who told me the truth) on everything. 

  
I have been racking my brain for weeks trying to figure out if I was in the wrong and ruined her day. As far as I know Carol has not tried to reach out either. So reddit, AITA for ending a 8-year long friendship after a wedding?",1,1737159602.0,CharlotteDobreYouTube,0,1.0,False

We plan to have contractors build out the space to what‚Äôs needed for seating, counters for coffee, beer, etc a bar top and storage. 

If we do a handful of draft beers do we need to have a walk in cooler for kegs? What would be the best way to operate draft beers with very limited space (think small dive bar size but fancier) ? If we decided to just go bottles and cans I know we‚Äôd still need refrigeration storage aside from what would be in the display fridge by the bar.

Raven Maddox: Welcome to the Maddox Morning Podcast. As we greet you this morning across the airwaves and through the internet, the election is a week behind us now. President-elect Jane Allgood‚Äôs margin of victory was so large that her supporters are proclaiming she has an absolute mandate to implement everything on her agenda, including something this news commentator finds very concerning.

The clip I‚Äôm about to play is from an interview Joseph Porchsmith conducted yesterday with the Security News Channel‚Äôs Sean O‚ÄôBrien.

{Looking off camera to producer}Sally, is it acceptable to start referring to SNC as a state-run news agency? Huh? I think it is. {laughter} Sally is holding up the ‚Äòno comment‚Äô sign. Roll clip, please, Sally.

SNC Sean O‚ÄôBrien: Congratulations, Mr. Porchsmith, on the chief of staff role. I know you are going to be invaluable to the new president in getting this country back on track. What I find very interesting, from inside sources, is that the Senator, John Taylor from Montana, has declined _any_ cabinet position. This is _extremely_ interesting and _highly_ unexpected.

Porchsmith: That‚Äôs correct, Sean. I‚Äôve been authorized to provide some insight on this matter. Taylor will not hold a cabinet position, but he will be very active in the administration.

Look, we have a domestic terrorism problem. That‚Äôs a fact. We have unchecked immigration due to the Earth Treaty instituted by past administrations. Moreover, the refugee projects, commonly referred to as Asiatowns, have become de facto no-go zones for law enforcement. They are corrupt cesspools for non-American enterprises, havens for drugs, gangs, and the kind of prostitution you don‚Äôt want to talk about.

As the CEO of John Taylor Securities, Senator Taylor has built the most successful private security apparatus the world has ever seen. He has agreed to use his resources, experience, and expertise to establish a new federal law enforcement organization that is going to tackle these problems head-on.

SNC Sean O‚ÄôBrien: God knows America certainly needs it, Joe. Is there a name for this new initiative? And how do you plan on getting this through the Senate without a super majority?

Porchsmith: Those are good questions. The senator has proposed the name Hammer Force, and he‚Äôs going to be the Chief Hammer.

SNC Sean O‚ÄôBrien {laughs}: I like the sound of that.

Porchsmith: As for Congress, we see no reason to go that route. We believe we possess the constitutional authority to institute this on the executive side as a branch of the DHS.

SNC Sean O‚ÄôBrien: Now that‚Äôs some news I can get behind. We‚Äôll be following this closely, and we wish the senator luck. There are a lot of dents to hammer out‚Ä¶

|clip ends|

Raven Maddox: If that doesn‚Äôt send chills down your spine, nothing will. Two and a half months before the inauguration, and this new administration is already shredding the Constitution. Buckle up. It‚Äôs going to be a bumpy ride.

We‚Äôre going to try to gain some perspective by speaking with a few supporters and detractors of the new president. But first, it feels like a jazzy morning. Let‚Äôs enjoy a little Miles Davis. This is ‚ÄòViolet.‚Äô Pour yourself some coffee, get comfortable. We‚Äôll be right back.

**A Jiffy Stop Morning**

Francis slept soundly on the sofa in the television room. He had taken to staying up until the early hours playing the ancient arcade games. Little Joe had presented him with a round key to the quarter compartments and showed him how to run quarters through to get as many credits as he needed.

The Greta had made a stoop for herself on the far wall where she sat cross-legged. The glow of the beer sign above her gave her the aura of a religious statue.

Like all devout Gretas, she was mute. Gwen said she had seen her during Comstock‚Äôs aggressive booking procedures. She‚Äôd been burned badly, more than likely during that great and tragic fire in a canyon near Modesto, California, when the Santa Ana winds had spread a spark across the largest gathering of Gretas in United States history.

Alan had tried to speak to her on two occasions. Her only response had been to stare at him with her beady eyes through the stretched perforations of the sackcloth veil she‚Äôd stitched into the t-shirt around her head. He gave her a pen and a piece of paper to write on, but she let them fall by her feet.

He got the drift. He knew when women didn‚Äôt like him.

‚ÄúThey only sew their words,‚Äù Gwen said.

Indeed, she took her sacred seat and started stitching on a square of fabric. When she was done, she limped to where he was sitting at a booth and dropped it in front of him. Then she limped back to her bed.

_Man, what have you done?_

He looked across at her, but she was lying with her face to the wall. The message was neatly cross-stitched, and the word _Man_ was missing a stitch in its vowel. A mum profanity, no doubt.

He‚Äôd read it again and again until he became nauseous with interpretation. He grew angry because it meant nothing. He remembered the schoolboy jokes about the best way to lose your virginity.

_‚ÄúWhat‚Äôd she say? Nothing really!‚Äù_

_‚ÄúHow did she like it? She was speechless.‚Äù_

_‚ÄúWhat‚Äôs the best part about fucking a Greta? They never ask to cuddle.‚Äù_

They were a mad cult of harridans, shrill in their silence. A wave of satisfaction washed over him at their fiery tragedy. He added this toxicity to the all-guilt deep inside and pushed it down.

Despite their tactics, they were not wrong. The earth, our mother, was dying.

_Man, what have you done?_

Gwen had taken up reading trashy novels from the spinning book rack near the restrooms. She was currently on her third romance, which rested in front of her now on the table. The cover displayed a hero with golden locks, and a white shirt ripped open to reveal his impossibly shredded physique as he pulled a buxom damsel out of a bed of thorns and roses.

Alan tried not to look‚Äîor at least to appear as though he wasn‚Äôt looking‚Äîwhen she was there across the lounge, when she descended the stairs, when she came out of the showers damp and clean, or when she was in the booth, knees drawn to her chest. The sight of her, her cream skin, her pert breasts. He yearned for her touch in a way that an old and impotent man yearned for the fresh young girls of his youth. Before‚Ä¶ the hurt, he would have let her know his desire. Now, apart from that one brief encounter‚Äîthat mercy fuck‚Äîhe was resigned to his frozen solitude.

Carter Nash worked on Ol‚Äô Betsy. On the outside, the van was a relic from an era long since passed. On the inside, it was an achievement of technology, functionality, and luxury. From what Alan could surmise, Nash had been an engineer of some caliber during his active service days‚Äîhe‚Äôd seen combat but wouldn‚Äôt talk about it‚Å†. The hippie had revamped _her_ from the ground up, starting with the addition of four-wheel drive and hydraulic suspension. Now, with the help of Little Joe, _she_ also had a hacked version of Self-Drive, rendering the rig completely untraceable. The most remarkable feat was that he was able to do all this with an ever-present joint perched between his lips, rolled from his stash of high-quality ganja hidden in a secret compartment beneath Ol‚Äô Betsy‚Äôs floor.

Apart from a modest pension, the hippie followed a circuit of independent music festivals, where he‚Äôd sell packs of marijuana cigarettes for a tidy sum. He called himself a Weed Elf, or a facilitator of good vibrations.

Little Joe, or LJ as Francis called him, was much more than his fa√ßade of an obese truck stop owner. Upon realizing he was stuck with them, he had closed for the season by barring the iron gates leading in and out of his business. He changed the message on the reader board that flashed out toward Highway 93: _Too Damn Cold. Closed For Winter. No Service._

Yesterday morning, for the sake of politeness, Alan apologized for ruining his business. The fat man waved his hand and said, ‚ÄúYou think I make any money off this place? Now the real work starts!‚Äù

The _real work,_ it turned out, was hacking smartphones, computers, or any other technology he could get his hands on so that they could not be tracked by various governmental or corporate surveillance systems. ‚ÄúThe trick,‚Äù said Little Joe, ‚Äúis to use the dumb AI to stay one step to the side of the smart AI.‚Äù This was an illegal but lucrative occupation in Montana, where most of his customers were conspiracy theorists, off-gridders, and doomsday preppers.

On this particular day, Little Joe was out dropping off a shipment to one of his clients. Alan‚Äîwhile being nosy, both to avoid the boy because of the hope sparked in his mind regarding his birthday and to avoid Gwen because he couldn‚Äôt get that night out of his head‚Äîdiscovered a wet bar in the small office room behind the counter. He helped himself to a bottle of potato vodka and left a note and a hundred dollars for Little Joe to find later.

I'm still learning the city and need some help figuring out a place to have coffee with a woman that doesn't speak a lot of English and I don't speak a lot of Spanish lol. I have translator ear pieces, I'll wear one and she'll wear the other. It will be interesting to say the least. We like each other and are both in our early to mid 50s. She likes Italian food and I like Asian food but those would be more for 2nd dates.

Anyway, we both like coffee and she agreed to have coffee somewhere this weekend. So I need help in figuring out a place to drink coffee and talk a bit to see if this language barrier can be overcome. I'd prefer it to be somewhat quiet, just to be able to hear the translator. I know there's Starbucks and Dutch bros, but I'd like something a little less known if possible.

1i3upj8,https://www.reddit.com/r/SatisfactoryGame/comments/1i3upj8/time_crystals_are_a_real_thing/,Time crystals are a real thing,"The in-game description of time crystals says

>Time Crystals are Diamonds that have been reconfigured on a sub-atomic level

For anyone interested, that would be actually quite a realistic way of producing time crystals:

>The formation of discrete time crystals, a novel phase of matter, has been proposed for some many-body quantum systems under periodic driving conditions. Randall¬†*et al*. used an array of nuclear spins surrounding a nitrogen vacancy center in diamond as their many-body quantum system.  
  
Source: [https://www.science.org/doi/10.1126/science.abk0603](https://www.science.org/doi/10.1126/science.abk0603)

The in-game description follows with

>This allows them to be used in the development of quantum processing and storage technologies.

Again, quite a realistic usage of the actual real-time crystals:

>As for applications, Monroe and co make a couple of suggestions. They say, for example, that time crystals could be used for quantum information tasks, such as implementing a robust quantum memory.

Sorry, this might be a long vent post but I just need to complain to people who get it. 

I graduated and moved out 2 years ago and now after being a mess I‚Äôve finally gotten diagnosed and medicated. I‚Äôm trying so hard to get my life together. I want my social, work, financial, and home life to run smoothly. 

At work I‚Äôve been working so hard to catch up on a years worth of procrastinated/bad attn to detail work and getting all of my current tasks organized. I‚Äôve been trying to set up schedules to check on my responsibilities too. But emergencies keep popping up and suddenly resources that I‚Äôm in charge of are needing repair faster than before. And I‚Äôm on cooler projects but then suddenly the deadline turns into a hard deadline 3 months earlier. Or once I fix a responsibility and get it running smoothly I go focus on the next one and the first one metaphorically blows up. 

With my friends I‚Äôm trying to organize schedules social events on a weekday or two so that I don‚Äôt waste 5/7 of my life yearning for the last 2/7, and I‚Äôm scheduling them early so I can look forward to them but have a planned calendar. I‚Äôm also trying to be a better friend, complain less and try not to interrupt+talk over people in conversation. But then suddenly I need to cancel things for car emergencies or things run late. Friends that I‚Äôve been limiting time with due to being very energy draining are ending up very active in my life for various reasons. People are cancelling on me last minute or springing last minute plans on me and begging me to come. Or some people are avoiding me even though I‚Äôm trying to be better to be around. OR some people that I thought were my friends are saying mean things to my face like they‚Äôre not mean.

I try setting up my finances so I can try to get a condo. I set myself fun budgets. I organize bank accounts. I set autopayments. I create goals. I adjust my benefits. But then things spring up like a sudden doctors visit, or my therapy apparently not being paid in full every month and not showing a balance before now (but the receipt I requested confirms it). Or my car needing a new battery. Or my close friend coming to town for a work trip and wanting to do things (in the winter, where the only free activity for someone who doesn‚Äôt enjoy the cold is to sit in my small apartment). Or the only social things my friends want to do cost money. Or an artist I love who hasn‚Äôt toured since 2019 is coming to town. Or my coworkers finally are inviting me to things but it‚Äôs lunch off-site every Friday. Or my appliance is breaking and needs replacement. Or I miss a bill I thought I had on autopay and have to pay late fees. Or my healing piercings decide they don‚Äôt want to heal anymore and I‚Äôve gotta go back to the piercer.

I‚Äôm trying to fix my home life. I got myself tools to keep organized and created stations. I‚Äôve been revamping my bathroom to be organized and I am getting rid of clothes i don‚Äôt wear. I‚Äôm trying to catch up on chores I‚Äôve fallen really behind on, cook and meal prep more, and set a schedule. I‚Äôm trying to get to bed on time and wake up for a morning routine that will result in me making it to work on time. I‚Äôm trying to exercise more. I‚Äôm deleting social media so I stop spiraling about if I‚Äôm annoying and unlikable. But suddenly my dryer is shrinking my clothing despite being the same settings, or something breaks in my dryer that rips my favorite Victoria‚Äôs Secret bra. And my dishwasher is leaving residue streaks in my dishes. And the grossest spider ever was living in my trash. And my rice cooker isn‚Äôt nonstick anymore, and my whiteboard ripped my command hook off the wall with a chunk of paint. And the AC in the gym is broken and there‚Äôs going to be a high of like 0¬∞F this weekend, and I‚Äôve been eating at a deficit for half a year and working out 2-4 days a week and can‚Äôt lose a pound towards getting back to a healthy weight. And my toilet seat hinge cracked so the seat is loose. And I stained my couch with soup. And no matter what I do and what I clean and how recently I‚Äôve taken out trash and how many fans and candles I put on my kitchen smells like stale food. And time is moving so fast that one minute the lights are turning off to signal I should get ready for bed at the next it‚Äôs midnight thirty. And I‚Äôm sleeping through my alarms by a huge amount and showing up to work an hour late. And apparently Apple devices have had some weird glitch where sometimes alarms just don‚Äôt go off. And my alarm clock shat out. And I can‚Äôt figure out if I lost my final pack of birth control or if I forgot to call for my next refill and meanwhile my period is having the time of her life.

And I just ran out of fucking coffee.

Why does it have to be so hard. It feels like I‚Äôm having more problems now than I‚Äôm actually trying, it is so hard to not just give up. It feels like I‚Äôm gathering my whole entire will to take a step forward and every time I manage to do it I stub my goddamn toe.",1,1737158341.0,adhdwomen,1,1.0,False

I'm quite confident I'd say as much as one can be.. I have my matters in order. I know this sounds very disciplined and rigid but I have sooo much leeway for anything and everything.

Idk there's loads of stuff :D

I enjoy deep chats quite a lot, philosophy, and endless banter especially no-holds-barred type of banters are fun... honestly any no-holds convo can turn into something funny :lol :D

I'd say I'm quite caring, protective, solution-oriented, open to communicate, and quite straightforward guy... but as you might've guessed already those just don't come from day one... feelings are feelings because we can't control them, right?  
Maybe we can walk in the parks holding hands talking about the movie we watched yesterday and about the characters? We can read poems to each other and maybe learn different things every other day and share them? We can prank each other, come up with weird jokes to see others reaction :D... all those lovely stuff... live in a wee village outskirts of a big bustling city but not in it and have late-night drives together? We can go for an ice cream at 3 am and settle for a terrible garage coffee LOL...

I'd say someone who has her life in somewhat order, who's in touch with her emotions, who's honest or should I say blunt (in a nice way :D), who's loyal, and who's curious about things in life... who knows what she wants, someone who's giving, caring and good at communication. we don't want to play guess games right ?

I'd say I'm an ambivert so I like going out for gigs, stand-ups, pints with peeps, but also need my alone time and indoors time so I love to have a cozy nights in so would prefer someone who'd be okay with this kind of cadence. But I should say I'm more leaning into spending time at home.

I live in Kansas City, but I've spent most of my life in the NYC metro. I moved here in 2015 for a great job, and I've been here since. I live alone in a nice, modern home in the South Hyde Park area. I love living inside the city and don't see myself living far away from an urban area.

I'm handsome, slim, and in great shape. I have deep, dark eyes and dark hair peppered with greys. I keep my facial hair short and well-groomed. I don't currently have any tattoos or piercings.

I pass regular background checks due to my job so you know I'm not shady. I have no debt or unpaid bills. I'm not addicted to anything. I don't need to be taught basic adult skills like how to care for myself or my home. You won't have to pick up after me or take an overwhelming share of the mental load. I've even kept my plants alive for years! Hopefully, you've got stability and minimal drama in your life. Ideally, you're independent and have a job that you enjoy. 

Politically, I'm a very passionate progressive/liberal. If you have some ""conservative"" values, that may not necessarily be a source of conflict. However, if you're a supporter of the modern Republican party and the MAGA movement, we are not a good fit. I'm not a religious person, but it is okay if you are as long as you can accept that I am not. Lastly, I do not have children and would prefer to date someone without children or whose kids are older and independent.

Except for a fulfilling relationship with a loving partner, I have a happy and comfortable life that doesn't want for anything. I'm capable, confident, independent, and have my life together. I want to meet someone with the intent of developing an enduring relationship. We can proceed at a pace that makes sense for us.

-------------------------
**Some things I enjoy:**

* **Food**: I have a very adventurous palate and love trying new foods. I avoid eating at the same restaurant twice to force myself to broaden my food experiences. If you're a vegan/vegetarian, that's fine! I'm open to the idea of some version of vegetarianism myself. I'm a competent cook, but I don't enjoy cooking. I'd prefer a partner who does. I promise that I'm great at doing the dishes and cleaning up in the kitchen.

* **Fitness**: My health is important, especially as I get older. I exercise regularly and also run. I'd love someone who prioritizes their health and fitness as well.

* **Coffee**: My COVID project was learning to appreciate coffee. My home ""cafe"" looks like a meth lab. I love it. I'll make you a great, fresh cup of pour-over in the morning. 

* **Bread**: Well, now that I'm kind of an expert in fresh pour-over coffee, I've somehow stumbled onto sourdough. I obtained a 220 starter from San Francisco named Doughlene and am raising her child Doughrothy. I've managed to keep her alive (I'm really good at taking care of stuff!) so far and have made various flatbreads. Maybe I'll try an actual loaf soon...

* **Riding**: I own a modern-retro scooter (a la Vespa) and enjoy riding it around the city. Don't worry, you do not need to get on the scooter if you don't want to. I promise I ride safely and with proper gear, and never speed or get on the highway.

* **Therapy**: I have been seeing a therapist for about half a year, and I'm finding it invaluable. After my previous relationships failed, I felt it was important to work on myself and set up future relationships for success. I think everyone would benefit from therapy at various points in their life.

* **Politics**: I'm a ""political junkie"". I frequently read articles and listen to podcasts. I also have a great deal of interest in the Supreme Court.

* **Movies**: I'm a huge cinephile and enjoy going to the theater. 

* **Music**: I love live music. I'm tolerant of most genres but gravitate towards indie, pop, and EDM. I like discovering new music, so if you want to share something you're vibing to and think I might like it, please share it with me.

* **Gaming**: I love to play board games with a group or my partner. I especially like games that involve some sort of social component and intuition, like The Resistance. Going out for trivia nights at bars is also one of my favorite things to do. I sometimes play single-player video games that allow me to stop at any time.

* **Cleanliness**: I'm probably the tidiest man you'll ever meet. I keep both my home and myself tidy. I'm something of a minimalist as well. I am not a big fan of collecting tons of trinkets and knickknacks and would not do well with a hoarder.

* **Drugs**: I have no dependencies or addictions whatsoever. I only drink socially and in moderation. I don't smoke *anything*, and I don't want to date someone who smokes a lot of anything. It smells gross and makes you taste gross. I sometimes enjoy a low-dose edible or a psychedelic. It's okay with me if you casually enjoy alcohol, marijuana, or ""lighter"" drugs more often than I do. 

* **Traveling**: I'm more of a homebody, but I like road trips. I want to drive across the country in a camper someday. I enjoy hiking and ""glamping"", but don't love prolonged camping. I would be agreeable to traveling far and wide with a partner.

It is perfectly fine if you don't share all my interests. I want you to be your own person with your own passions. As long as we align on our core values and ideals, the rest is not all that important.

------------
Please be serious about meeting in person. I don't want to text endlessly. If you're interested, feel free to reach out to me via chat or Reddit mail (preferred). **Please include a picture of your face with your message and describe yourself physically**. It's not much different than if we were on a dating app. I **will** ask for a picture if you didn't include one to start. Being weird about this would lead me to believe you're not serious and I'll likely move on.

------------
If you're **long-distance** (i.e. more than 2 hours away) and still interested, feel free to message me, but *only if* you're willing to make an actual effort to meet me in person after chatting for a bit. Ideally, you're in a position where you'll be able to relocate to Kansas City to live with me in a hypothetical future in which we're both committed to one another.

I'd say I'm an ambivert so I like going out for gigs, stand-ups, pints with peeps, but also need my alone time and indoors time so I love to have a cozy nights in so would prefer someone who'd be okay with this kind of cadence. But I should say I'm more leaning into spending time at home.

I was gifted a Beryl-AX GL-MT3000 for the trip, but I'm technologically incompetent, and not sure if it'll be of use. From my understanding, the Beryl-AX is sort of a ""middle man"" that connects to an existing wifi network, amplifies that wifi, and then securely connects to multiple devices, allowing them to use the internet. Is this understanding correct, or am I missing something?

This seems useful, but the reason I'm hesitant to keep the Beryl-AX is that I may not always have wifi to connect it to. Some locations have free wifi (i.e. hotel, airport, train station), but last time I was in Japan it was hard to come by in public, especially in smaller towns and the country side. So if I'm working out in public, it seems I'll need to find a way to get wifi to begin with. Would it be worth getting an e-sim, setting my phone as a hotspot, connecting the Beryl-AX to the hotspot, and then connecting my other devices to the Beryl-AX?",2,1737157907.0,GlInet,1,1.0,False

Make sure you remove everything even things as minute as a headache (which I got flagged for) and back pain. I‚Äôm waiting on waivers. Allergies make sure you get them removed from your history. (Don‚Äôt lie about serious ones like to antibiotics or pain medicine). I‚Äôll give you a detailed picture of what my meps( fort Hamilton) did to give you a better understanding. When you arrive at meps, you‚Äôll check in. They‚Äôll line you up (try and get there early the earlier the better I promise! You‚Äôll head upstairs to medical. You‚Äôll check in upstairs as well. Be patient. Wear comfortable shoes a lot of standing. A lot of waiting. You then get sent to blood pressure (DO NOT DRINK ANYTHING CAFFEINATED and or SALTY! I promise you they will retake it up to 3 times and send you home) then you‚Äôll go to vision. (If you wear glasses be sure to make sure it‚Äôs not a serious astigmatism they will flag you for it) you do a color blind test from a book. You can practice at home. The eye exam consists of looking into a machine and reading lines. They check farsighted and near sighted. Corrective and uncorrected. I scored 20/30 my right eye‚Ä¶ line 7 is a night mare extremely small. Then you‚Äôll head to briefing where you‚Äôll be given a breathalyzer do not drink anything not even mouthwash. They tell you about the actual physical. Then you‚Äôll get your hearing checked. (You‚Äôll be in a booth with ear phones press the button every time you hear even the faintest noise.) after this is done.. you‚Äôre almost at the end. You get blood drawn, they test for anemia, hiv. (You can‚Äôt have either even if you hide it) once you‚Äôre done there you‚Äôll head to the urine test. (Which is shipped) you have to pee with open stalls, pants down to your ankles someone watches you you get tested for pregnancy and drugs (72 hrs) make sure you hold your pee and avoid thinking about someone watching you. They give you 3 chances to go if you don‚Äôt you must come back at another time. Then you‚Äôll get your physical ladies as I‚Äôm female‚Ä¶ I can tell you my part. So you sit in a room with a doctor. (Mine was cool) they will bring up your history right in front of you. I got flagged for back pain and a headache and an allergy I don‚Äôt even have. So make sure you opt out of everything. (Anemia will still pop up with the blood test no use in hiding it your automatically DQ. ) you will then be asked to remove your clothes down to bra and underwear. Get used to this cause you‚Äôll also be taped in your underwear. Neck stomach and hips. Be comfortable being uncomfortable cause the whole process is uncomfortable. Make sure you clean your ears cause they will send you to get your ears cleaned if they can‚Äôt see your ear drum. Avoid AirPods and headphones till the end of the process. They check your eyes and teeth. They will check for scars on your arms to see if you hurt yourself in the past. Then you do squats to make sure your legs knees and back work. They will check for scoliosis. And the famous duck walk (practice get real low and walk heel to toe. (My doctor didn‚Äôt make me yours might) you‚Äôll do the duck walk from one side and back. Prepare for that it‚Äôs a few steps (mine was) then you lay on the the table she‚Äôll check for hernia press on your stomach and make you cough. Then check for lumps. Then she‚Äôll ask you to remove your underwear,  look at your vagina and ask you to spread those booty cheeks. Then check the flexibility of your hips knees and feet. And if all goes well you‚Äôll be done‚Ä¶ if you require a wavier you‚Äôll go to your branch recruiter and they‚Äôll submit the wavier ( depending on what it is for this might take a while) if you‚Äôre good to go they‚Äôll send you back to your branch in the meantime you will eat (ham and cheese, turkey, vegan option or roast beef this is what we had) we also had other options coffee and tea after. You WILL BE THERE ALLDAY PREPARE FOR THAT. Treat them with respect and they‚Äôll treat you with respect if they tell you to do something do it QUICKLY. They are NOT YOUR FRIENDS OR DOCTORS. KEEP YOUR MOUTH SHUT. I was there for 10 hours today. Keep this in your mind. They don‚Äôt gaf if you have your period‚Ä¶ they are checking to make sure no masses scars or herpes are on your genitalia. Men they will feel your balls and check those booty cheeks too.

First things first, I‚Äôm a 25-year-old male, so please be 21+. This is my first time posting an ad of my own (but I‚Äôve got about 10 years of experience), so bear with me. 

I typically lean towards more slice of life, romance roles, as that‚Äôs just what I‚Äôm most comfortable writing! I‚Äôve never dabbled in fantasy or sci-fi and don‚Äôt really intend to start now. I‚Äôm fairly literate, usually writing around 3 paragraphs, but I can always stretch that out if it requires more detail. In any dialogue-heavy moments, lesser might be more, to not drag it out.

I‚Äôm in PST, if that matters, but I don‚Äôt mind what your  time zone is! My availability is pretty flexible, thanks to my job not having concrete hours. I‚Äôm a lot more online later in the afternoon and evening, around 4pm-11pm PST, but I check in throughout the day and if work allows, can always send a response!

Now for my ideas (they‚Äôre more like rough outlines) - my character is A, your character is B

1. Muse A has recently moved into town after opening a small bookstore/coffee house with his sister. Muse B lives in the neighboring townhouse, and due to events in her past, she's spent the last two years locked and hidden away in her home. Given that they share an entryway, the two met the day he moved in after his brother-in-law propped a mattress up against her door, blocking her view through her peephole. This drove her to open the door to see what was going on, and the two briefly met. Muse A was taken with Muse B just upon exchanging a few quick words, but the same couldn't be said for her. He was more outgoing than she was, and very intent on getting to know her. From bringing over mail that was mistakenly delivered to his address, to dropping off books and pastries on her doorstep, he tries everything he can think of to try and strike up a conversation, not knowing exactly what her struggles are. (I hope to have the two characters eventually start to form a friendship, and then eventually a relationship. Fairly angsty, slow burn and all that.)

2. Muse A and Muse B are both doctors at Boston General Hospital (what kind of doctor is up to you). They met a few years ago when B first started, and for the last year or so have been having an affair. (A would be the one that‚Äôs married, with B being a couple years younger than A). To make things simple for themselves, they made some ground rules. There are five, simple and clear, that define their relationship: 1) Be professional at work. 2) Keep it secret. 3) Don‚Äôt get attached. 4) Meet only at her apartment. 5) No sleepovers. They agreed not to break any of them, but rules 3 and 5 had been getting harder to follow. Muse B was getting more and more attached to Muse A, and it seemed that he was struggling to follow that rule as well. (This one is very rough, and more of a general idea but we can decide how things play out together. Again, angsty, slow burn and drama-filled.)

If either of these caught your attention, feel free to send me a DM or a chat! Being that it‚Äôs Friday, I may be a little busier than usual but I should see all messages fairly quickly!

I met a guy with an avoidant attachment style and he is pretty classic. We‚Äôve been friends for 1 year. He‚Äôs gone away a a few months before and come back. I try not to think about it super hard although it can be hurtful. I try to remind myself I‚Äôve only been divorced for a year and it ok to just be friends with benefits. 
Well it‚Äôs been a year since we started talking. (Right around same time as my divorce)  He always pays for dinner. We go on hikes and I text him about my day. I treat him like my best friend, he responds we text multiple times a day. We usually hang out once a week, I spend the night. He makes me coffee, he starts my car for me. He‚Äôs met my family and he has ‚Äúmentioned me to his family.‚Äù But I am not his girl friend. 
I recently had sent him a text (I realize this is more comfortable for him) asking again to clarify it if we are in a relationship and he says no. He says he likes his life the way it is now.  
I was like, do you like your life with me in it? He says yes. I asked, do you ever see us being in a relationship and he doesn‚Äôt answer. 
It‚Äôs all silly because we do everything a couple would do, his is essentially my boyfriend. 

So my therapist retired and I  need a new one.  But she told me it‚Äôs important to keep meeting people if you‚Äôre not in a relationship. So a guy who I previously dated popped up and asked me to get a drink. 

I know rationally I can go get a drink with this guy but my emotional brain is saying this is wrong and that I‚Äôm essentially in a relationship. 

Any advice?

I've been interested in penpalling ever since I was a kid - back in the days before you could more easily meet someone from half way across the world sooner than a neighbor a few doors down. I've been fortunate enough to have had a few before, mostly focusing on item exchanges, letters, and postcards, and would like to see if I can find that again, being able to live those experiences and to give that to someone else as well.

Ideally, I'd like to have a physical exchange, with my preference being letters and items. Due to the private nature of penpaling, however, I'd like us to actually chat a bit and get to know each other before diving right into those physical aspects of it. Let's become familiar with each other to make sure we're a good fit. All that being said, I'm also interested in having e-mail penpals, which I'd be open to in the immediate now. It's more than possible for one form to transition into the other or for us to have multiple forms of penpalling going on at the same time.

My ideal communication method with someone is in the form of lengthy, detailed, intricate paragraphs and pages that delve into a variety of topics and themes. Even when meeting people in less defined ways we sometimes end up becoming de facto penpals due to how long it takes to properly respond to each other. So, if digital exchange is what you're after, this is the style it should take. I'm less particular when it comes to the physical.

","We're facing a loneliness epidemic in America, and I believe our suburban landscape is partly to blame. The way we've designed our communities over the past 70+ years has literally built isolation into our daily lives, and it's time we talked about it.

The Power of Spontaneous Interactions:

Have you ever noticed how a brief chat with a barista, a quick hello to a neighbor, or a spontaneous conversation at a park can brighten your entire day? These seemingly minor interactions, what sociologists call ""weak ties,"" are actually crucial for our mental and physical health. Research shows that these casual encounters:

1. Boost our sense of belonging and community connection
2. ¬†Release oxytocin and other positive neurochemicals
3. Reduce stress and anxiety levels
4. Create a social safety net that we can rely on in times of need

The problem? Suburban design actively prevents these vital interactions from happening naturally.

¬†The Problem with Suburban Design:

Think about your typical American suburb: Singlefamily homes set far apart, no sidewalks in many areas, and you need to drive everywhere¬† to get groceries, meet friends, or grab a coffee. This isn't just inconvenient; it's actively harmful to our mental and physical health.

A 2023 study by the American Public Health Association found that residents in cardependent suburbs reported 13% higher rates of social isolation compared to those living in walkable urban areas. Another study in the Journal of Urban Health showed that people living in walkable neighborhoods had nearly twice as many meaningful social interactions per day compared to those in suburban areas.

The Hidden Health Costs of Suburban Living:

The health impacts of suburban living go far beyond social isolation. Research has revealed numerous concerning correlations:

¬†Physical Health:

1. Suburban residents walk an average of 39% less than their urban counterparts
2. ¬†Higher rates of obesity and cardiovascular disease in cardependent neighborhoods
3. Increased risk of high blood pressure due to longer commute times
4. ¬†Higher rates of respiratory issues due to increased car dependency



¬†Mental Health:

1. 47% higher rates of depression in suburban areas compared to walkable urban neighborhoods
2. Increased stress levels from commuting and car dependency
3. Higher rates of anxiety disorders, particularly among teenagers who lack independence in cardependent areas
4. ¬†Greater feelings of disconnection and alienation from community



¬†The Science Behind Social Infrastructure:



When we look at the healthiest, happiest communities worldwide, they share common features:

1. Dense, walkable neighborhoods
2. ¬†Abundant ""third places"" (locations that aren't home or work where people can gather)
3. ¬†Reliable public transportation
4. ¬†Mixeduse development that puts amenities within walking distance



Research from the Journal of Transport & Health shows that people who rely on public transportation have 3x more spontaneous social interactions than those who primarily drive. These aren't just statistics, they represent real opportunities for human connection that we're missing in suburban America.

¬†The Urban Alternative:

Cities like Portland, Minneapolis, and Boulder are showing us what's possible when we prioritize human centered design: Minneapolis eliminated singlefamily zoning, allowing for more density and affordable housing options. The result? A 27% increase in new neighborhood businesses and a measurable increase in community engagement. Portland's investment in bike infrastructure and public transit has led to residents reporting higher levels of social satisfaction and community belonging compared to suburban counterparts, according to city surveys.

The Myth of Suburban Family Life:

One of the biggest obstacles we face in creating healthier communities is the deeply ingrained belief that suburbs are the ""best place to raise a family."" This idea, heavily promoted since the 1950s through everything from advertising to government policies, has become almost sacred in American culture. But the data tells a different story:

1. Children in walkable urban areas have greater independence and develop stronger social skills. A study of 12-16 year olds showed that those in walkable neighborhoods had more diverse friend groups and higher measures of social confidence.
2. Urban children get more physical activity. Without having to rely on parents for transportation, they're more likely to walk or bike to activities, friends' houses, and school.
3. Contrary to popular belief, dense urban areas often have lower crime rates per capita than suburbs. The perception of suburban safety vs urban danger is largely a myth perpetuated by media coverage and historical biases.
4. Children in urban environments develop better problem-solving skills and spatial awareness from navigating their environment independently.
5. Families in walkable urban areas report spending more quality time together, often because they spend less time commuting and shuttling kids to activities.

The irony is that many of the things parents move to the suburbs for ‚Äì safety, community, healthy environment for kids ‚Äì are actually more readily available in well-designed urban areas. When we choose suburbs because ""that's what's best for the kids,"" we might actually be depriving them of valuable developmental experiences and social connections.

# Looking Forward

The good news is that perspectives are starting to shift. More young families are choosing to stay in cities, and many suburbs are being redesigned to incorporate urban elements like walkable town centers and mixed-use development. These changes don't happen overnight, but every step toward more human-centered design is a step toward healthier, more connected communities.

What we need now is a cultural shift in how we think about ""good places to raise a family."" Instead of automatically equating suburban life with family values, we need to consider what truly makes a community healthy for children and adults alike: social connection, independence, active lifestyles, and genuine community engagement.

The good news is that change is possible. Many suburbs are already experimenting with retrofitting more walkable town centers and improving public transit connections. These changes don't happen overnight, but every step toward more humancentered design is a step toward healthier, more connected communities.

What We Can Do

We need to:

1. Support zoning reform that allows for mixeduse development and higher density
2. Invest in public transportation infrastructure
3. Require new developments to include walkable features and public gathering spaces
4. Convert existing suburban areas to include more pedestrianfriendly infrastructure
5. Design neighborhoods that facilitate natural, spontaneous interactions

  
This isn't just about transportation or urban planning, it's about mental health, community resilience, and human connection. The research is clear: when we build places for cars instead of people, we pay for it with our social lives and our health.

I (20F) used to live with my roommate (19F). We are both sophomores in a relatively big university. At the beginning of term, she was the run of the mill small town girl moving into a big city. She was shy, clean and didn‚Äôt stay up too late so she was a good enough roommate. We rarely talked but I was alright with that arrangement as I (as a neuroscience major) was swamped with work or studying most of the time. Some time into the term, my roommate, let‚Äôs call her em, gets a boyfriend. He came over a lot and they were always listening to songs, laughing or making out. Obviously a big change to our initial arrangement. I brought it up to her a couple of times but she would say she‚Äôd not bring him around but it would work for a couple of days and she would be back at it. I am not a very confrontational person so i just stopped bringing it up. But to my surprise and glee, em and her boyfriend broke up few months in. You‚Äôd think that would solve my problem, right? NO. Turns out she broke up with him so she could ‚Äúhave more time to explore new things‚Äù and those new things turned out to be endless numbers of men in our dorm room. Boy, I do not exaggerate when I say I did not see the same person twice. I started spending more nights at my friend‚Äôs dorm room but her roommate obviously minded. I would spend so much time at those poor girl‚Äôs room that everyone would make jokes about it. I had clothes and even my toiletries there. And EVERYONE on the floor knew. I even complained to the RA but they did not care enough to do anything. Then, FINALLY the year was over. I could sleep in an actual bed and not have to do a soldier crawl to get clothes, my makeup from my OWN room. On moving day, I even met em‚Äôs parents who were so sweet to me and helped me move my things as well. I decided to let everything go and have a fresh start and not confront em. Now, it‚Äôs a few months into being sophomores (we were roommates in freshman year) I found out from people that em has been telling everyone THAT I WAS A NIGHTMARE OF A ROOMMATE. THAT I BROUGHT AROUND COUNTLESS MEN TO OUR DORM ROOM TO THE POINT SHE COULDN‚ÄôT EVEN STAY IN HER ROOM. ME. Obviously there are people to back me up but most of our class now thinks i‚Äôm a slut. I obviously was very angry and I went to politely ask em why she had been spreading the rumours about me. She continued, (it was just the two of us) on that lie and insisted that what she had said was the truth and I was making stuff up. I was so speechless that (this is where i might be the asshole) I started cursing her out and dumped (hot) coffee on her clothes. I am not proud of this at all. People came and she said I ‚Äúunprovoked‚Äù lashed out on her. I got a warning. I talked about this to my friends and they said I could have handled the situation better and should not have yelled/poured the coffee on her. So, Am I the Asshole?

1i3tm24,https://www.reddit.com/r/u_Coverage_Ink/comments/1i3tm24/writing_slick_scene_descriptions/,Writing Slick Scene Descriptions,"Scene descriptions are the place to show off your voice, but never forget that screenplays are judged, in part, on their **terseness** and **brevity**. How few words can you use to say something? Here is your mission, if you chose to accept it: show your wit, spark and creativity, **but do so with great efficiency and economy of words**.

First order of business: delete some verbs from your vocabulary‚Äîlike ‚Äúwalk‚Äù and ‚Äútalk‚Äù. Pretend they never existed; forget you once knew them. Why? They are bland and boring and they don‚Äôt tell us anything. Don‚Äôt believe me?

Here is what **NOT** to do:

**Peter is tired and confused. He walks into the room and sits down on the couch while he talks to nobody in particular.**

Bland and boring, right? How about this:

**Peter slumps into the room, collapses on the couch and grouses under his breath.**

More descriptive, less boring, fewer words. And we‚Äôve substituted the more interesting and evocative ‚Äúslumps‚Äù and ‚Äúgrouses‚Äù for ‚Äúwalks‚Äù and ‚Äútalks.‚Äù

Another common mistake is to overdescribe environments. The reader doesn‚Äôt need the details of every piece of furniture in a room or every single item on a desk. We‚Äôve all been inside churches, pizzerias, coffee shops, etc., so there‚Äôs no need to waste time describing these places *unless there is something noteworthy or atypical about them.*

Just give us a flavor: the ‚Äò50s-inspired coffee shop, the hole-in-the-wall pizza joint that only sells slices; the church whose stained glass windows have seen better days. Comment on something that makes the scene unusual from what we expect. For example,

EXT. PIZZA JOINT ‚Äì DAY

Title: The Perfect Family ‚Äì A Dark Secret

Growing up, I always thought my family was perfect. We were the kind of family that everyone admired on YouTube: the happy smiles, the cute challenges, and the picturesque vacations. Dad was the charismatic figure, the one who could make anyone laugh. Mom was the sweet, devoted parent, always supporting Dad‚Äôs crazy ideas. And my younger siblings? They were adorable little stars in our videos.

But behind the camera, things were very different. The laughter you heard in our vlogs often masked the tension that simmered in our home. Dad had a temper that could erupt without warning, and we all knew to tread carefully. If things didn‚Äôt go his way, he would unleash a storm of anger that left us all shaken.

The worst part was the nights. Each evening, after the cameras were off, we were confined to our rooms, doors locked tight. I would hear my mom‚Äôs muffled cries as Dad forced her to do things she didn‚Äôt want to, always under the guise of keeping the family together. It was a twisted game he played, and no one outside our home had a clue.

I lived in a constant state of fear, feeling guilty for not being the perfect daughter in his eyes. I tried to maintain the facade, to keep up with the videos, but inside, I felt like I was breaking. I knew I had to escape this life, but I was terrified of what would happen if I did.

One night, after a particularly violent episode, I decided I couldn‚Äôt take it anymore. I waited until everyone was asleep, my heart pounding in my chest. With a mixture of fear and determination, I quietly made my way to the door of my room. The lock clicked ominously as I turned it, but I had to push forward.

I crept through the dark house, my breath hitching with every creak of the floorboards. I could hear Dad‚Äôs heavy breathing from the living room, and I held my breath, praying he wouldn‚Äôt wake up.

Then, I heard it. A sharp scream. Mom‚Äôs voice, desperate and broken. It wasn‚Äôt the first time, but this time, it was different. There was something more... final in her cry. My body froze. The door to my room was still cracked open, and I wanted to run, to go to her. But something held me back. Fear. My limbs felt heavy, like I was sinking into the darkness of the house.

I stayed in my room, paralyzed by the sound of her sobbing and pleading. I pressed my hands over my ears, trying to block it out, but the sound cut through me like a knife.

When the house finally fell silent, I waited. Hours seemed to pass before I dared to open my door again, but I couldn‚Äôt bring myself to look into the living room. The darkness felt heavier now, as if the walls were closing in. But I had to know.

I tiptoed down the hallway, my breath shallow. As I passed the living room, I saw him sitting there. Dad. He was slouched in his chair, his face grim. He didn‚Äôt look at me, but I saw the blood on his collar. Dark, fresh blood that looked wrong against his white shirt.

My heart stopped.

I turned and fled back to my room, locking the door behind me. I pressed my back against it, unable to move, my mind racing. What had happened? Was Mom okay? Was she still here? I couldn‚Äôt bring myself to check.

The next morning, everything seemed off. The house felt... too still. I crept out of my room and went to the kitchen. Dad was there, pouring coffee, like nothing had happened. But when I asked about Mom, his eyes narrowed, and he said nothing.

I asked again, my voice trembling. ""Where‚Äôs Mom?""

He looked at me with a smile that didn‚Äôt reach his eyes. ""She‚Äôs gone. She left.""

The blood on his shirt‚Äîit was a detail I couldn‚Äôt ignore. I wanted to scream, to demand the truth, but I knew better. His temper was unpredictable, and I wasn‚Äôt sure what he was capable of anymore.

As we ate breakfast, I noticed something else strange. Around 7:15 a.m., just before my younger siblings and I were about to leave for school, I saw Dad slip out the back door. His footsteps were quiet, but I saw him. The moment he was out of sight, I felt a shiver run through me. He was always so careful to never leave when we were awake.

By the time we finished breakfast and grabbed our things to leave for school, Dad was back. He slipped in through the front door, the same door we‚Äôd used to leave not ten minutes before, as if he had never left at all.

I could feel my pulse quicken. What was he up to? Why the secrecy?

But I couldn‚Äôt ask. I couldn‚Äôt risk angering him more than I already had.

I turned and left with my siblings, but the unease in my chest only grew. I wasn‚Äôt sure what he was hiding, but I knew enough to know that whatever it was, it was dangerous. And the blood on his collar wasn‚Äôt the only thing that would haunt me that day.

That night, I made up my mind. I couldn‚Äôt stay. I couldn‚Äôt let the cycle continue. As I packed a small bag, I heard Dad moving around the house, but I didn‚Äôt look back.

I couldn‚Äôt.

The world outside was terrifying, but it was also the only place left where I could hope to find peace. To break free from the chains of my past. I had to leave behind the family that never was, and start the journey of reclaiming my life. Where‚Äôs my mom? What is wrong with dad? Are me and my siblings safe?

Radiation appointments in the afternoon have been horrible (long),"I was debating whether morning or afternoon appointments since I work and we have a daily morning meeting I opted for afternoon- also it helps being home for my almost 16 year old as he heads out to school.

At the end of week two and they‚Äôve run late almost every day- I know that things can get delayed as the day rolls through, but damn! Today was 1.5 hrs late and I had one day that it was 2 hrs. Both caused by incidents with patients. One soiled a changing room and today one soiled themselves on the machine. ü§¢

Story time:
Today was the icing on the cake. I get there at 2:45 for my 3 pm appointment. They tell me they‚Äôre running 45 minutes behind. OK, I‚Äôll help myself to a cup of coffee. Coffee machine is broken. I ask the receptionist how to get to the cafeteria (it‚Äôs in another building in the complex). 

I try following his instructions but the doors are blocked. I end up going the long way. By the time I go through security and make it down, Starbucks is closed. üò¢ I go get a soda and get soda all over my arm (and lymph sleeve) since the soda machine is broken.  *sigh*

I walk back following signs and that exit hallway is also closed. Backtrack go up some stairs, out to the cold and back at the building to wait. I see people finally getting called back. I‚Äôm still waiting. 45 minutes pass, 1 hour. They call back a lady who‚Äôs appointment was at 3:45. Huh? I ask the front desk. He has no answer, but says I can go to the back room to change. She‚Äôs the only one there. I change out and wait and they call me in 20 minutes after her. I was told they had her on a different machine which was why they took her ahead.
 
Anyway, I get done in less than 10 minutes. I go back to the ladies waiting room and see the lady that had the accident in the changing room the other day waiting on her turn. I‚Äôm nervous. I go into the changing room and I thought I was going to throw up. I‚Äôve never changed clothes so quickly. It was horrible. I can‚Äôt even explain the smell. I was dry heaving. There was some streaks of liquid on the floor. I felt bad for the lady since she could hear me, but they seriously need to do something. It was the icing on the cake. I mentioned it to one of the techs as I left. 

Ugh! I‚Äôm hoping next week is better.

I can't think of any other way to describe him. He was friendly enough and usually kept to himself, but he didn‚Äôt say much‚Äîand when he did, it was the weirdest shit ever. 

So, I didn‚Äôt talk to Ethan often. 

He used a whiteboard to communicate, which could get tedious, especially when he took forever to respond.

Yesterday, I was shopping with my mom, and we ran into my English teacher, who, for some reason, dumped Ethan Wilder‚Äôs books into my arms.

Apparently, Ethan missed summer school, so Mrs. Caine was on the warpath. 

She didn‚Äôt want to visit him directly, and my mother, of course, piped up with, ‚ÄúOh, yes, Luke would *love* to help out!‚Äù

I did say, ‚ÄúNo, I‚Äôm good.‚Äù But both my mother and my teacher collectively agreed that I was doing this, and I had zero choice. It‚Äôs worth noting that I‚Äôve already graduated. Ethan was repeating a year, and since I was no longer a student, as well as a fully grown *adult*, I didn‚Äôt have to follow my teacher‚Äôs orders. 

However, being in the midst of two middle-aged women, with one being my mother, put me at a disadvantage. 

When I pulled a face, Mom called me adorable and tugged my cheeks, which made me want to crawl into a hole. 

Mrs. Caine dumped an entire semester‚Äôs worth of workbooks into my arms and then gave me his home address.

It‚Äôs the middle of summer, and the sun was baking the back of my neck. I had to walk to Ethan Wilder‚Äôs place with zero choice. 

I didn‚Äôt even get a fucking reward.

You‚Äôd think I‚Äôd get cash, but no, according to my mother, it was just a *gesture of goodwill.* 

I don‚Äôt have a car, and maybe it was my fault for not asking my teacher for a ride, but by the time I reached Ethan‚Äôs house, I was two steps from throwing up.

I had to gather myself on the doorstep. I was soaked through with sweat, and my head felt like it was going to explode. 

Ethan‚Äôs place was not what I expected‚Äîa regular suburban household with a white picket fence. Maybe I was just being a judgmental asshole, but Ethan didn‚Äôt strike me as a Brady Bunch type of son. 

I definitely had a mental image of where he lived, and this was not it.

I think Jake, a guy in my class, once said Ethan lived in the trailer park. I guess I believed him.

Knocking three times on the Wilder family‚Äôs door, I just wanted to get it over with. The sun was already setting, and I wasn‚Äôt looking forward to the walk back.

Mom disengaged herself from *mom* duties after 6 p.m., so it was my responsibility to make my own way home. 

Now, I know I said Ethan was weird, but I wasn‚Äôt expecting him to answer the door with a strip of duct tape over his mouth.

The stench that followed him, and clung to him, was like a physical entity slamming into me. It was a mixture of rotten food and feces. Ethan‚Äôs face had grown noticeably thinner, sunken eyes and hollow cheeks giving him a gaunt, almost skeletal appearance. 

His clothes were visibly filthy, with his jeans and shirt clinging to a wiry frame like a second skin. It was the lack of spark, of life, in his eyes‚Äîtwo hollowed-out caverns penetrating right through me‚Äîthat sent me stumbling back, my heart in my throat. 

Before I could speak, the guy pulled out a roll of duct tape from his pocket and took a stumbled step towards me. 

Without a word, Ethan tore off a single strip, and before I could stop him, he plastered it across my mouth.

What the fuck. 

I didn't know what to say or do. Ethan Wilder was weird. 

But he wasn't *this* fucking weird. 

The moment was surreal and fucking confusing, and I couldn‚Äôt understand why I wasn‚Äôt running away, instead paralysed, while he glued it in place. 

We were two nineteen-year-old guys, so why did I feel like we were back in kindergarten?

I started to tear it off, but he manically shook his head, reaching for his whiteboard.

‚ÄúHi,‚Äù Ethan scribbled. ‚ÄúCome in.‚Äù

‚ÄúNo, it‚Äôs okay,‚Äù I said, then remembered my mouth was taped up.

I gestured to his workbooks in my arms, but he ignored them.

‚ÄúCome in!‚Äù he scribbled. ‚ÄúYou look like you could use a drink of water :).‚Äù

I tried to tear off the tape again, but Ethan stuck it back in place.

‚ÄúNo, Luke,‚Äù he wrote down, shoving the whiteboard in my face. ‚ÄúYou can‚Äôt speak.‚Äù

I could see his lips stretching into a grin through the creases in his gag. 

He went back to his whiteboard, scribbling another message. I noticed it took him three tries to write the word *come* before he gave up and just drew a large arrow pointing inside the house. 

I didn‚Äôt know what to say. I wanted to laugh, but laughing felt wrong.

I didn‚Äôt realize how young and stupid I was, or how much I wanted my mother, until I was standing in front of Ethan Wilder, who wrapped his hand around my wrist and yanked me forward. 

I dropped the books, but he didn‚Äôt care, pulling me over the threshold and slamming the door.

Ethan‚Äôs grasp was strangely gentle, but I knew if I started tugging away, his nails would start to dig in. I had no choice but to follow him.

*This guy was a fucking psychopath.*

To my confusion, the main hallway in the Wilder household was one big mattress. 

I wasn't expecting it, already stumbling forward. Ethan still had a tight grasp on my wrist, yanking me into the lounge. 

It was what you would expect, a modern family-oriented living room with a couch, a coffee table, and a TV pinned to the wall.

Looking around, something cold slithered up my throat. 

I don't think I registered the walls at first. 

I think my brain skipped over them, maybe on purpose. But once my gaze left the crystal paperweights on the mantelpiece and the family photos, something snapped inside me, like a bungee cord severing, and my gaze was stuck, suddenly, glued to every corner.

**The walls,** I thought dizzily, my thoughts beginning to twitch and contort. I recognized the markings as *writing*, but that's where my brain short-circuited.

All I could see was writing. So much writing, so many markings scrawled into what had been picture-perfect paintwork. It didn't hit me until I was moving closer that the words were carved and scrawled and scribbled in dripping, intense scarlet.

But the more I tried to understand what I was reading, I could feel myself sinking deeper. For a disorienting moment, I forgot my own name. 

Then my mom‚Äôs name. I forgot why I was there in the first place, and then, after a stumbling step forward that dragged my body towards the walls, phantom fingers twining around my neck, I didn't know who I was. 

These words were pouring into my head and setting my blood alight, numbing my bones. It felt like my mind was being drained, sucked right through my skull by an invisible vacuum. I remember dropping to my knees, as if in prayer. 

But I don't know who I was praying to.

I could sense it in the air, a suffocating presence forcing me into a bow.

It allowed me to lift my head slowly, so I didn't take it in all at once.

And like a puppet, my body obeyed, paralyzed.

The writing on the walls, the indistinguishable scribbles splattered in scarlet, were fucking *talking* to me.

I could hear them, static whispers I couldn't understand bleeding into my skull.

The same words were written, carved, and scrawled in a language that twisted my gut, igniting thoughts and feelings I couldn't comprehend, already twisting and contorting my expression. 

Happiness. 

Joy that wasn't mine, that flooded my brain, tricking me into believing I was feeling pleasure. I was grinning through the duct-tape gag, my lips violently stretched across my face until I could taste blood.

But then there was despair. Pain and anger and pleasure coming together in a cocktail that filled my eyes with tears, my lips parting in a shriek I couldn't swallow.

I didn‚Äôt understand the words, and yet my body did.

I had to get out, the thought buzzed in my mind.

I had to get out.

I had to get out.

I had to get out.

I had to get out.  

But then my thoughts were backwards, the words mixing up and together and apart.

I couldn‚Äôt move. I couldn't think or breathe. Because my eyes were already reading and re-reading each scarlet word, and, like I was in a trance, I crawled forward, my trembling hands itching to *touch* them. 

I could sense my sharp breaths struggling against my gag, hysterical beads of laughter crawling up my throat. I reached out with trembling hands, pressing the palms of my hands against the writing, carving my fingernails into each indentation. 

I could feel the urge hit me like a wave of ice water, my own fingers twitching, ready to tear into my skin and imprint myself on these walls. 

It was the only way I was going to give back, the only way I could pledge myself to these words. 

Ethan grasped my hand, pulling me to my feet, and my head spun, my identity crashing back into me. 

Blinking rapidly, I shuffled back, swallowing bouts of barf filling my  mouth. It wasn't words that were carved into every wall in Ethan Wilder‚Äôs living room. It was something else, a language, a *thing* that made me want to scream and claw my hair out, rip the flesh of my bones. It made me feel fucking crazy. 

Reality seeped back into fruition, and I was staring at entrails ingrained into the wall, old red pooling from each marking.

*I was Luke....*

 The thought was delayed, already suffocated. 

*Nineteen years old.*

*I had a Mom, and her name was Iris.*

Ethan pulled me back, and like a doll cut from its strings, I stumbled toward him. 

I barely felt his hand still wrapped around my wrist. 

**‚ÄúSorry :)‚Äù** I couldn't register what he was writing for a moment, before clarity hit. The stink was worse, hanging stagnant in the air, and I had already clawed into my own arm, a single line of red drawn across my skin.  I could barely feel the sting. It felt alien to me, like it wasn't attached to my body. 

Ethan prodded his board, and his writing contorted into shape, actual English. 

**‚ÄúThat was my parents. They made a mess.‚Äù**

I nodded slowly, dazedly. I could still feel it, the sensation of drowning wrapped around me, suffocating my senses, slimy phantom hands covering my eyes and snaking into my mouth.

When Ethan twisted around and skipped upstairs, taking the steps two at a time, I followed, like something bound us together. 

I was half aware of my mind screaming at me to run. But the rest of me, polluted thoughts and contorted words, wanted to go further into the Wilder house. 

I started up the staircase, one by one. The walls upstairs were covered in writing too. 

**GET OUT.** 

**SAVE MY BABY. GOD. SAVE MY BABY. SAVE MY BABY. SAVE MY BABY.**

I could see the writer's slow descent into insanity through every warning. When I reached the top, I stepped on something that squelched through my toes. I didn't remember taking off my shoes and socks.

When my gaze found the floor, I was standing in something writhing, a slimy red substance pooling across the cream carpet. The smell hit me again. Putrid and thick. But I could barely register that somehow, it was moving, sinking into the flesh of my feet, bleeding into my blood. 

Part of me wanted to jump back, while this severed puppet version of me was swaying back and forth, while phantom hands tried to pull me back onto my knees. 

Ethan held up his whiteboard, and I steadied myself. **‚ÄúMom gave birth to my little sister right here.‚Äù** 

His words twisted in and out of view, blurring together. 

They became numbers, then letters, then numbers, and then *blank*. 

Ethan tugged me down the hallway, and I finally met his parents. Mr. and Mrs. Wilder looked like they *might* have been normal. 

Mrs. Wilder was still wearing her wedding ring. 

Through my foggy vision, all I could see were two unmoving, skin colored figures standing in front of the wall, and in one sudden, jolting movement, they started to writhe, flailing, like performing an interpretive dance. 

Ethan‚Äôs parents were completely naked, their skin ridged and wrinkly. Mrs Wilder was pulling out her entrails and smearing them across pretty pink paint. 

Mrs. Wilder‚Äôs mouth was stretched wide, a grotesque, horrific grin, like she was laughing, but only gasps of breath escaped her lips. Her laughter was silent, fingers carving those exact same words on the downstairs walls. 

The severed part of me could *understand* this unearthly, inhuman urge they had to replicate these words, carving and drawing them into every surface, everything that *could* be drawn on. The bedsheets were covered in nonsensical scribbles, the carpet torn into and shredded, bearing each symbol, which were slowly burning themselves into my entangled brain. 

The more I looked at them and tried to figure them out, I wanted to copy them until my fingers were bleeding, and then I would use *myself*. 

That sudden, poisonous thought was enough to bring me back to reality. 

Ethan had a tight hold on my arm, his fingers digging into my flesh, choking up the shriek building in my throat. 

I caught a glimpse of a twisted, unsettling grin that flashed across his face, contorting back to fear and pain. 

His eyes were hollow and crying out, and then they were empty caverns glittering lunacy I didn't think possible. 

The guy jumped up and down on his heels. I could see his grin through the tape, growing wider, more and more maniacal. 

Whatever Ethan Wilder had been fighting, he had lost. **‚ÄúDo you want to see her?‚Äù** he asked, writing on the whiteboard.

‚ÄúHer?‚Äù I spoke through the tape, my voice no longer mine. 

Ethan responded with wide, blinking eyes, jumping up and down like a toddler. 

His shirt rode up, revealing that twisting, contorted script carved into the flesh of his stomach. Even his face. 

Looking closer, real close, I could see scars where he'd marked himself, slicing each blank letter onto his own skin. 

Ethan, with barely contained excitement, kept shoving his whiteboard in my face, furiously scribbling with his pen.

I managed to take two steps back, but by now it felt like I was stuck in quicksand. 

My legs were trapped, frozen in place. 

Ethan held up his whiteboard, and every word he scrawled looked and felt physical, like it was skittering across the surface. 

**‚ÄúWhen my sister was born, the nurse who delivered her ripped out her own eyes.‚Äù** He wrote, before erasing it with his sleeve. Ethan‚Äôs eyes were frenzied, like he was enjoying himself. 

**‚ÄúThe people in black told us she would turn our town mad.‚Äù**

Another step back, and I was struggling to breathe. 

**‚ÄúThey put her to sleep! And they refused to take her away, because they were scared of her. So they left her with us :(.""**

Ethan held up his whiteboard, hiding behind it.

**""The wall sickness took Mom and Dad. It made them want to wake up my little sister.‚Äù**

He erased that, and continued scribbling. **‚ÄúI was scared of her and what it did to my parents, Luke! I didn't want to get the wall sickness too! Mom and Dad were too loud, and I had to be QUIET.‚Äù**

Ethan dramatised his words with a finger to his taped up mouth.‚Äù

He erased that, and added, **‚ÄúSo, I cut out their voices and stitched them back up! Everything had to be quiet. That's what the people said.‚Äù*""

He tipped his head to the side, and I heard an unmistakable laugh muffle through the tape. 

**‚ÄúTHEN I STARTED TO READ THE WORDS ON THE WALL andandand :)))))))‚Äù** 

His words started to shift and twist together, mimicking the words on the wall. 

Ethan was giggling through his gag when he pushed me through another door. 

I didn't realize how many doors were in the house. I counted two upstairs, but when Ethan was shoving me through one at the end of the hallway, I counted six. 

There were *six* doors. 

The room I stumbled into, Ethan by my side, was a nursery. 

Mrs Wilder had decorated the room a light purple, pastel colors blending together. 

I found myself in front of a crib, a tiny bundle of entangled blankets.

But there was no baby, only empty space bleeding between the cloth. The more I stared and looked for it, there was nothing, and in the nothing was *something*, but I couldn't *see* it.

I choked on my own hysterical shriek of laughter. I reached out and touched the blankets, touched the oozing space between the blankets and thin air, and the nothing in-between. 

It was that nothing, that snapped something inside me. 

I was already laughing, already tearing at my face, already being forced to my knees to pray. Ethan finally ripped the tape off his mouth. ‚ÄúI want you to do it,‚Äù he whispered, his words collapsing into tangled gibberish. 

I could feel my own tongue already contorting, ancient words dripping from my swollen mouth. 

But I swallowed them down.

Ethan let out a single shriek of laughter. **‚ÄúI want you to wake Lula up!‚Äù**

I could sense myself already giving in to the walls. 

The six doors that were expanding into seven, eight, nine, ten, eleven, twelve‚Äì

But then it let go of me. 

Slowly, I sensed it, *felt* it detach itself from my mind. 

I could think again. 

Breathe again. 

Ethan was still howling with laughter, dancing in circles, and I was moving back. 

I was out of the door before it could grab me again. 

Before it could wrap itself around me, suffocating my brain, I ripped the tape off my mouth, and the sting snapped me out of it. I stumbled downstairs, and out of the door, back into the late evening sun shining in my eyes. 

It was so easy to escape. So easy to turn around and run. 

So, why didn't I in the first place? 

I went home and I went straight to my room. 

I showered and scrubbed myself until my skin was raw. 

I keep looking for the blank language on my skin, because it FEELS like it's part of me. I want to tell Mom about Ethan, but I don't know how to explain what I just saw. 

What almost fucking consumed me, body and mind. 

Please, someone tell me what the FUCK I just witnessed, because I think I'm going mad. 

Mom asked me what the markings are on my arm, but the last time I looked, I didn't have any. 

Now I do. There's a single word carved into my skin, and I can't read it. 

I can't fucking read it, and it's driving me crazy. 

It makes me want to write it until I can understand it. Until I can comprehend it. I've already scratched it into my dresser, and then my own walls. But the words, or ‚Äòwords‚Äô still don't look right. 

Maybe if I try a different angle. I'll carve into my ceiling next. 

I need to understand them. I don't think Ethan did. 

I think that's why he ended up like that. 

Please help me understand what I saw, I'm fucking terrified. 

Edit: Can you also help me understand why there are two extra doors in my house?",7,1737155261.0,Odd_directions,1,0.89,False
1i3tg7y,https://www.reddit.com/r/Fibromyalgia/comments/1i3tg7y/resource_for_migraine/,Resource for migraine,"Heal Your Headache by David Buchholz, MD is a really good resource on migraine. I will be honest and say that I have not followed his program to the letter because I can‚Äôt give up caffeine or opioids. However, the understanding I gained from the book has helped me manage my migraines better. Also since all of these pain triggers and painful conditions play off of each other, understanding what triggers one condition helps control everything else to a degree.

Personally what makes fibromyalgia the terror it is for me is its lack of predictability and the way good leads to bad so often.  That may sound like a contradiction but if you live with this you know what I mean. 

Anyway I hadn‚Äôt seen this book mentioned so I just wanted to throw it out there. It is very pointed and strong in its tone. It‚Äôs kind of like if you don‚Äôt do exactly as he says you are to blame for your suffering and that sort of thing is not always welcome in my mind so it might not be welcome in yours either. Use what works (the list of food triggers is excellent for instance as is the discussion of the idea of a migraine threshold) and say your choice of profanity to what you don‚Äôt like. He‚Äôs not listening. I respect him and believe he is probably right about the whole regime but my chronic pain needs the opioids and my ADHD and depression need the caffeine and my soul needs my coffee. I genuinely love it and I have given up soooo much.  So no shade to the doc personally. Hope this helps someone!",2,1737155256.0,Fibromyalgia,2,1.0,False

4 Recaps this week: The Stewart Fam, Trace & Lydia, Chad & Erin, Lawson Bates. 

Enjoy!

**The Stewart Fam: ‚ÄúOUR SON STARTS SPEECH THERAPY + A NEW FAMILY CAR!‚Äù**

Starts off with a recap of New Years Eve with the kids, Carlin and Evan dancing round a 2025 balloon banner, B Roll of a countdown.

Trace and Evan work out together (Carlins relationships with her siblings seem to have gone strength to strength since Erin moved as I honestly wouldn‚Äôt have seen this one coming ‚Äì especially since the whole dirty house drama).

Thrive Ad coincides with the fact their fridge and freezer have been out for nearly a week, they are waiting for an engineer but it keeps dragging out. 

Cut to them in the back of an Uber to Chattanooga, where they call back to last weeks video regarding car shopping. They say that they have plans to grow their family so they needed to consider future vehicle plans or throw it back to a Tesla. They decided the bigger cars were too big a jump and that Tesla is a perfect ‚Äúfamily of four car‚Äù, that they don‚Äôt need a 8 seater when they have 2 kids, and that they are very minimalistic and don‚Äôt love the style of the larger cars. If all goes well they will be picking up their new Tesla that day then when they bring up who gets to drive it home, Evan throws Carlin straight under the bus by confirming it was her who wrecked Tesla 1.0 so he should get the first drive of Tesla 2.0.

B Roll of them in the dealership then Evan explains that they have been told that it is not uncommon for new cars to be damaged during transit and that their car has had some cosmetic damage. They want to talk to them about taking it anyway and having it fixed later in Knoxville since they are in Chattanooga. When it pulls up it is the blue Model X with white interior, Carlin is immediately back in love with it and wants to get everything set up. They are able to agree to take it with the fixes happening at a later date.

They plug Carlin‚Äôs Instagram with a reel she made of picking up the Tesla which at the end shows Zade‚Äôs reaction, he is super excited. 

Zades Speech Therapy Evaluation Appt: They have waited a little while for the appointment, but they do believe he is doing way better and trying to talk, but they both feel the evaluation is necessary and as parents they want to learn any tips and tricks to help him too. B Roll of the kids playing in the waiting room and presumably the patient room too. They recap in the car that it was a great appointment in terms of the speech therapist immediately bonded with Zade, she can see straight away the things that would help him, and that there is a plan in place for an appt every other week for a couple months with the main focus on pronunciation and ending words as opposed to repeating the first syllable. His understanding is perfect and he scored great on those charts but his actual communication was lower than the therapist wanted. C&E are excited for the appointments and also happy that Zade is excited too. The kids babble talk into the camera then we cut to the snow days.

Layla prayed for snow taller than their house and they are about to go out in the snow once Zade has woken up. They are way more prepared for snow than last year, they had no snow gear for the kids and were cowboy engineering all kinds of fixes. But this year they are sorted and have all the clothing and are totally prepared ‚Äì other than the broken fridge. They are now at over a week and have yet to talk to an actual person, just an online update saying the parts are delayed. Carlin and her sister shopped the day before, the shops were chaos due to the fact that people in Tennessee panic, stores close etc. The ‚Äúbest part‚Äù is that Travis and Katie are coming to sleepover and enjoy the snow together.

They have been organizing their pantry and getting work done around the house. Evan goes outside to show that the hot tub cover blew over and the hot tub got filled with leaves, rest assured he has cleaned it out. They tease the snow/sleepover content for next weeks Vlog and close out.

**Trace & Lydia: ‚ÄúHearing Baby‚Äôs heartbeat for the first time + SNOW DAY‚Äù**

Coming Up: They show Lydia going to one of her appointments with Josie, then Ryker and Trace out in the snow.

November 7th 2024: Lydia is getting ready in the mirror. Exciting and nerve-wracking day as it is the first ultrasound appointment. She is 8 weeks and 4 or 5 days along at this point and the appointment will let her hear the heartbeat for the first time and talk to a doctor for peace of mind. It‚Äôs been an emotional day since Trace is in Spain at this point with MedicCorps distributing Starlinks for the flooding victims and to re-establish communications. She is selfishly sad as he is now missing this appointment but that it is God‚Äôs Work and understands why he isn‚Äôt there. 
That morning she woke with a little spotting which people do say is normal, but that she had none with Ryker and that is how her miscarriage started in February. Because of this she is extra emotional and worried. Many people have tried to reassure her that a little spotting is normal so she is trying to remain calm. Josie is coming with her which is calming her as she won‚Äôt be alone, and Ellie is coming to watch Ryker. She has been so sick which shockingly is calming her as that does suggest that while she is sick the baby is growing and alive. Lots of morning sickness, symptoms have been so different to Ryker‚Äôs pregnancy so she speculates the gender based on this. She doesn‚Äôt feel like she will calm until after 20 weeks and is finding it such a different experience after a miscarriage but Ryker keeps her busy and not overthinking too much. 

She left way too early for the appointment due to nerves so is waiting for Josie in the parking lot. Then shows them walking in, Josie says it‚Äôs the biggest honor ever to be going and she may cry. They show the baby on the screen then Lydia shows the ultrasound pictures, heartbeat is confirmed and everything is looking perfect. There is only one baby despite the tech waiting over a minute while she checked for twins which made them nervous. She feels so relaxed now and wants to get food to celebrate. She misses Trace so much since he never missed an appointment with Ryker, and the receptionists knew him last time because he was always there.

January 10th 2025: Trace and Evan are leaving the gym after their workout. The snow is falling heavily so he is heading home to take Ryker out in the snow once he wakes up. 

Shows some drone footage of their neighborhood covered in snow, before zooming right into their house with Ryker at the window waiting excitedly.

They get Ryker dressed in snow gear and practice with his sled in the living room. He waddles outside and takes in the snow. Trace and Lydia‚Äôs snowboarding clothes and gear are at ‚ÄúThe Big House‚Äù so they are less prepared than Ryker. They show him going down the hill on his sled multiple times, with Trace pulling him and riding with him before Lydia has a turn too. They attempt snowmen and snow angels.

Lydia is inside and the boys are back outside for round 2 since Ryker absolutely loves it and does not want to come inside. Tells everyone to enjoy the snow and how beautiful it is. 

**Chad & Erin: ‚ÄúHOME FOR THE HOLIDAYS (AND GROCERY SHOPPING FOR THE BATES FAMILY)‚Äù**

Chad opens by saying it‚Äôs been a whirlwind last couple weeks and that the Lord has led them to a new place. They miss Addee who has flown back to Tennessee and they‚Äôll miss her on their car ride back to the Smokey Mountains for Christmas, which has a lot of special memories for all of them and it is the kids highlight. They will be celebrating Gil‚Äôs 60th Birthday, and that he is one of Chad‚Äôs heroes and they can‚Äôt wait to celebrate him. Chad is heading back before New Years to tidy up the last couple things to leave the house in good condition and take the goats to their new home. It‚Äôs a bittersweet time. Erin thanks everyone for following along and they are hitting the road in their overloaded car.

They show themselves driving in the foothills of the Smokey Mountains for a Tennessee Christmas. It was a wild ride up the mountains to the cabins. They have Jeb with them and this seems like a separate Cabin from the Birthday retreat. It looks like Tori and Erin just planned a cabin Christmas for their families out with the Bates‚Äô plans. 


After a few shots of the views we see Tori and Bobby making dinner with them and all of the kids running round the cabin, watching videos and eating cookies.

Christmas Eve: Breakfast in the cabin with Bobby and all the kids, then they show the kids sitting telling Chad what they are grateful for. Answers range from: My mom and dad, the snow, my cousins and a bath. They open presents from Nana and Papaw (presumably Chad‚Äôs parents). As Chad washes up dishes, Erin declares it their best Christmas ever.

The older kids play playdough and boardgames. 

Christmas Day 2024: The kids are naming the gifts brought by the wise men in turn as they read the Christmas story, then sing ‚ÄòGo Tell it on the Mountain‚Äô (I have this song burned in my head from the BUB episodes). It looks like they have Christmas dinner just the two families as opposed to a big Bates event, then the kids have root beer floats on the balcony. 

December 26th 2024: They leave the cabin to go to the Big House for the family Christmas Party and Gil‚Äôs 60th Birthday. 

Esther Tori and Erin do the grocery shopping for the party, they have 3 carts full and are absolutely stacked full on the drive home with no room to move for grocery bags. 

Teaser for next episode: Gil‚Äôs 60th Birthday at the Royal Blue cabins. 

**Lawson Bates: ‚ÄúFAMILY SECRETS! BRINGING UP BATES EMOTIONAL RETURN!‚Äù**

Disclaimer: This video is 30 minutes long. It is a lot of similar footage as all of last weeks recaps, therefore I‚Äôm not going into huge detail regarding Gil‚Äôs birthday trip. If there is anything not already covered I‚Äôll cover it. Also spoiler ‚Äì he has fully ‚Äúclickbates‚Äôd‚Äù the title- there is no mention of Bringing Up Bates or its return, or Tiffany being pregnant despite numerous hints throughout.

Coming Up: We see William flailing on his baby blanket excitedly ‚Äúhyped‚Äù for the upcoming trip, Lawson letting Duke run around the back yard and then Lawson hugging William saying ‚Äúa little spoiling before things even out with kiddo number 2‚Äù. They show William on Tiffany‚Äôs knee in the car after arriving at the cabins, the nieces and nephews all running around outside and various shots of Bates and in laws holding babies and chasing kids, before yet more footage of the praises of Gil‚Äôs birthday, and Papa Bill and Mama Jane, and a baby announcement teaser.

Starts off with Lawson talking to the camera, getting ready for ‚Äúa huge Bates adventure‚Äù. Baby William is content on his blanket, and then he explains its for Grandpa Bates 60th Birthday and Bates Christmas Party in Rocky Top. 

Lawson makes a show of picking up the baby, throwing him up high in the sky then tucks him in his arm like a football.

Sponsored content is for a solar powered power bank.

They are outside playing with Duke, William is mesmerized and Lawson says ‚ÄúWills like look at you big fella last time I saw you I was even tinier‚Äù ‚Äì The dynamic of Duke baffles me, he didn‚Äôt meet the baby for weeks and now this reference suggests it has been some time. Is Duke elsewhere or is he kept exclusively outside? Their YT timeline in general is so hard to follow. Anyway, this trip to Rocky Top Duke gets to go (and probably left afterwards). He says Duke has too many toys, which is like William at Christmas, he‚Äôs spoiled but that‚Äôs ok because he‚Äôs the first born, and that that will stabilize out when number 2 comes along‚Ä¶ ‚Äúwe‚Äôll have to see when that will be‚Äù.

They are now at Royal Blue ATV Park, which Lawson plugs as one of the top 4 ATV parks in America (I‚Äôm not sure where this stat comes from as after a quick Google, the park doesn‚Äôt even come up in the entire first page of results.) He compares all the kids out playing to the Von Trapp‚Äôs and pans round the cabin porch saying that almost all of the original Bates kids are there plus ‚Äú30 bazillion grandkids, who knows how many more will be announced in this episode‚Äù. (Spoiler ‚Äì None.)

He basically goes round all the youngest grandkids, Harvey, Graham, Lily. Shows Michael holding William for a picture, Zade cuddling Kelly Jo then Finley Paine running through.


Kelly Jo announces they‚Äôre going to ‚Äúwheel Papa Bill out in his wheelchair for anyone that wants pictures‚Äù ‚Äì yikes. 

Gil‚Äôs speech again. More kids just hanging out then he shows about 10-15 trash bags waiting to go to the dump after just one day of celebrations with that many people.

Nathan says he and Esther drove through the night so the kids slept the whole way, but they don‚Äôt think they‚Äôd do that again.

They show again Kelly Jo‚Äôs speech, Gil‚Äôs birth story, games and gifts. We see Katie and Travis gifting him 2 pairs of On Cloud trainers, The Stewarts give him a new iPhone, a grill from I think Zach and Whitney and Bobby and Tori gift him a Bunn Coffee maker (this is what was clipped up at the start to look like an announcement, ‚Äúdoes this mean there‚Äôs a Bunn in the oven?!‚Äù).  They then told the birth order of all the kids. Baby Will is curled up with Mama Jane. 

Gil summarizes the birthday in that he is grateful and blessed, and still has 7 children living at home. He and Lawson debate how many kids Lawson could have, they settle on 8-9 being a good number. Tiffany was barely in this video but it closes out with her holding William and talking about heading back to the music city.

I appreciate the kind comments on last weeks. I debated waiting to get Travis and Katie's up in the same post but their posting schedule is all over the place and may not post this week. Whenever they do it‚Äôll be included in next update.

Have a great week!

""My dearest Drea,

My hope is that someday, it‚Äôs you who discovers this letter. Adrian can be impulsive and unpredictable, and I have no idea what he might do in the future.

Drea, my little spark, my strength‚ÄîI wish I‚Äôd had more time to see you grow, to be there for you. You are my heart, my sunshine, and please, always remember that. There‚Äôs so much I want to say, but time has grown scarce; I can feel it slipping away. My health is failing quickly, and it‚Äôs not by accident.

You deserve to know, Drea, that the reason for my failing health is Vivian‚Äîyour mother. I wanted so badly for our marriage to work, wanted to share everything with her. But she only cared about my fortune, and she‚Äôs gone to great lengths to secure it for herself.

My estate belongs solely to you and Adrian. I wanted to make this clear in a will, but I never expected time to run out this way. I‚Äôve long suspected Vivian was tainting my drinks, but today, I‚Äôm certain. She brought me coffee not long ago, and there, faintly on the cup‚Äôs rim, were traces of a familiar poison. I could call the police or rush to the hospital, but instead, I choose to write to you now, hoping you find this someday, hidden here in your nursery.

If things go as I hope, David may look after you, maybe even adopt you, though he doesn‚Äôt know of you yet. If not, I pray Adrian finds you and keeps you safe. I believe you‚Äôll grow into a remarkable woman, strong and resilient, Drea. Know that I loved you fiercely. Please tell Adrian that despite his anger over my choices, I‚Äôm deeply sorry and that I love him as well.

I love you both,

\~Emerson Grant""

The letter slipped from Drea‚Äôs trembling fingers, her legs giving way. Sorin quickly wrapped an arm around her shoulders, holding her upright as she crumpled into his side.

Tears blurred her vision, and through them, she looked up at Sorin, whose expression held a quiet grief. Though he was only a child back then, his affection for his uncle had been real.

She managed to choke out, ‚ÄúW-what does this mean?‚Äù

""Shh,"" Sorin soothed her, bending to pick up the letter and carefully slipping it into her book. ‚ÄúNot here, not now. Let‚Äôs get home, then we can talk.‚Äù

She nodded, her lips trembling as tears spilled over. Sorin gently wiped them away, wrapped an arm around her waist, and guided her out of the room. They descended the stairs quietly, moving toward the exit.

Just as they reached the door, her mother‚Äôs shrill voice called after them, ‚ÄúLeaving already? You haven‚Äôt stayed for lunch.‚Äù

Sorin‚Äôs jaw clenched tightly. Murderous woman, he thought, before turning to face her with a forced smile. ‚ÄúI‚Äôd rather have lunch alone with my wife. Thanks.‚Äù With that, he steered Drea out the door.

Once they were safely away, he pulled the car to a stop by the side of the road, dropping his head against the steering wheel. ‚ÄúDamn it, damn it, damn it.‚Äù

A soft touch settled over his hand, gripping the wheel tightly. Lifting his head, he found Drea‚Äôs gaze, shimmering with unshed tears as she tried to hold them back.

‚ÄúD-do you‚Ä¶ think this could really be true?‚Äù Her voice trembled with uncertainty.

He reached for the book and retrieved the letter, directing her gaze to its signature. ‚ÄúLook, he signed it. If we can track down some old documents he might‚Äôve signed, we‚Äôll have proof.‚Äù He paused, deep in thought. ‚ÄúDad must have something lying around.‚Äù A loud groan escaped him as he pinched the bridge of his nose, tears gathering in his eyes. ‚ÄúWhy did my uncle have to be so reckless? He could‚Äôve at least confided in my father and asked for his help! Damn it!‚Äù

Drea intertwined her fingers with his, offering a comforting squeeze. ‚ÄúWe‚Ä¶ we don‚Äôt really know what was going on back then‚Ä¶‚Äù

A sob erupted from him. ‚ÄúI loved him so much, Drea. I don‚Äôt remember everything, but I know I did. To learn he met such a tragic end‚Ä¶‚Äù

Leaning forward, Drea rested her forehead against his bicep, weeping alongside him. He lowered his chin onto her head, tears streaming down his cheeks as they sought solace in one another‚Äôs embrace.

After several moments, he wiped his eyes and said, ‚ÄúCall Adrian. Tell him to meet us at home.‚Äù

Drea nodded as Sorin drove away. When they arrived, Adrian sat at the dining table, his head bowed and hands gripping his hair in despair, the letter sprawled before him.

Taking a seat beside him, Drea wrapped her arm around him, offering comfort while Sorin stood back, his mind racing as he contemplated their next steps. Grief could wait; justice for his uncle was their immediate priority, and Sorin vowed he wouldn‚Äôt rest until it was served.

Suddenly, Adrian shot up from his seat, his eyes bloodshot and wild. He pulled out his pistol from the holster at his waist, making Drea gasp softly in shock.

‚ÄúThat‚Äôs it! That woman is going to pay today. I‚Äôve tolerated her long enough!‚Äù He growled, striding toward the door. Drea grasped his wrist, desperately trying to halt him.

‚ÄúAdrian, no!‚Äù

1i3tdpo,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/1i3tdpo/my_fiancee_35m_keeps_flirting_with_his_coworker/,My fiancee (35M) keeps flirting with his co-worker (33F) who is set to be divorced. It¬¥s been going on for 2 years.,"# 

So 2 years ago I found out that my boyfriend M 35 and his co-worker F (married at that time) are texting a lot. . Some of the texts were them flirting, they spent all day at work together. But that seems to be not enough, they write each other almost all the time during office hours but also started writing on the weekends, in the evening. While he went to the mountains with his friends, he sent her same pictures he sent to me (not selfies or anything like that) but pics of all of the guys and him there, video from the pub of them singing, pic of dogs in the pub..Innocent things right..But why the need? Why send the same things he sent to me at 11 pm to just a co-worker at the same time? But they were texting about badminton - because they go together during lung break quite a lot and she said that next time she will train with him and he replied, what will we train? and she replied badminton what he meant by that and he said that you can train a lot of things, but that he also meant badminton...This he explained to me, that that was too much and he realized that, but couldn't tell me why he did it, I asked if it was alcohol, why the need. I feel so betrayed that he is texting me and at the same time he is texting his colleague, sending her the same pics..

He also started to call her name in a diminutive form (don't know if that is a correct way to say that). She asked him to join her on a work trip and he said I will go anywhere with you.

I confronted him about all of this, said that this is too much for me, this is flirting and I am not okay with that, I asked him how would he feel if I texted with my coworker like that, if I wrote him while I was away drinking, after office hours.

I told him that I want him to limit the contact with her to only work-related..

He said he loves me, he didn't mean anything by that, he would never act on that, it stops there for him, that he will change the tone, now that he knows that I am not okay with that, he won't engage that.

This was almost 2 years ago.

Well, same situation repeated a few times..I read their conversations and found something everytime..I know it¬¥s bad to look, I feel bad for going through his phone, but my trust was broken...

And at first he tried to limit the messages, but fell right back into it...

Yesterday, I discovered that she is divorcing her husband. Don¬¥t know what to think of that.

I also read one of their conversations when they were discussing their seating plan. Now they are sitting across from each other and when we were on vacation, she wrote to him that she misses him, that she has no one to kick under the table with her legs. And now they were messaging if it was better for him to sit next to her or stay across from her so he could have contact under the table, to which she replied that she liked both options, but that if he sat next to her she wouldn't have to keep getting up, when she wants to express everything to him only with one look.

Then they were discussing her vacation this year, that she has lot of vacation days and will be using them (guess it¬¥s needed and good for her because of the divorce) and he wrote that he won¬¥t let her go and then that he will want reports from her - to stay in touch.

Well I read all of this and confronted him again..it¬¥s tiring because it keeps repeating..I honestly don¬¥t know what to do, because he told me it¬¥s just flirting and it means nothing to him and the reason he flirts is because it¬¥s for fun and that he has been doing it for years and it¬¥s hard to stop.

Also he usually doesn¬¥t tell me anything about this colleague, he for example had a day off and just went to work to stop by for a coffee to see her (not her specifically he said, she was there with another coworker) and he did not say this to me. He avoids telling me anything related to her, because I guess he is afraid of my reaction, I called her names, eventhough I don¬¥t even know her personally, but he just made me not like her..In summer he also didn¬¥t tell me he was leaving for a weekend for a race they both (and more people from work) signed up for and he told me the evening before, eventhough we had plans and were supposed to go to see his parents...so many other examples

I told him that what I hate about this it that I told him more than once that this is uncomfortable for me, that it hurts me and I think it¬¥s disrespectful and that I don¬¥t like it and he promised he will stop now he knows I don¬¥t like it. But I heard this before..and it keeps happening..

He tells me he loves me, that he doesn¬¥t have feelings for her, that it¬¥s just stupid flirting that would never lead to anything more. I asked him how would he feel if I was doing same things and he said he wouldn¬¥t mind, which I find a bit too hard to believe. I don¬¥t know what to do, because my trust is broken and I love him, but he keeps disappointing me and it¬¥s tiring...He keeps repeating that it means nothing to him, and I keep repeating to him that I don¬¥t like it and that he should respect that..",1,1737155057.0,relationship_advice,4,0.67,False

Found myself craving it a couple days later, but was pretty sure I was just craving that underlying buldak flavor and the beloved noodle texture. 

Went to a different Walmart and got carbonara, and a bottle of the carbonara sauce. (Great adittion to enchiladas, by the way.) 

I made one, and it was.... not as good as I remembered? Figured it was a fluke and I just hadn't done my inclusions right. 

Made a batch two days later and found myself feeling like something was missing. Added extra sauce, that helped, but wasn't quite it. 

I just made my last habenero lime. My normal inclusions. Garlic, a little pasta water, scoop of mayo, egg yolk, full packet, and a splash of cream to loosen it all up at the end. 

It hit the spot like no other craving has in so long. I'm not ashamed to say I licked the bowl clean. (Ok, I used my finger to scoop up the sauce, but still.) 

This is such a goofy post. But it almost kinda feels like when I had to accept that I just didn't like coffee anymore after 20 years of it being a large part of my personality. Lmao. Carbonara IS my favorite. I'm a carbonara girly, damnit! üò≠

-----------------------------------------------

When it comes to setting up your kitchen, having the right dishes can make all the difference. You want your kitchen to not only be functional but also inviting for family meals and entertaining guests. Understanding the essential kitchen dishes can guide you in making smart choices that elevate your cooking and serving experiences.

Here are the crucial kitchen dishes that every home should have:

- **Core Dinnerware Set**: A reliable dinnerware set is foundational. Look for a set that includes dinner plates, salad plates, and bowls. Porcelain or stoneware options are durable and elegant.
- **Serving Platters**: Whether hosting a dinner party or serving a family meal, serving platters are versatile and useful. Choose different sizes to accommodate various dishes, from main courses to appetizers.
- **Mixing Bowls**: Mixing bowls are essential not just for mixing ingredients but also for serving items. Opt for a set that includes different sizes. Stainless steel or glass bowls are easy to clean and can withstand various temperatures.
- **Measuring Cups and Spoons**: Accurate measurements are vital for successful cooking and baking. Invest in a good set of measuring cups and spoons, both dry and liquid. This ensures your recipes turn out perfectly every time.
- **Cutting Board**: A sturdy cutting board is a must-have for food preparation. Consider wooden or bamboo boards for slicing, and have a plastic one for raw meats to avoid contamination.
- **Glass Bakeware**: Versatility is key in the kitchen. Glass bakeware can go from oven to table with ease. They‚Äôre perfect for casseroles, lasagna, and desserts, making them an essential addition.
- **Non-stick Frying Pan**: Ideal for frying, scrambling eggs, or saut√©ing vegetables, a non-stick frying pan allows for easy cooking. Choose one that is durable and can handle high heat.
- **Stock Pot**: A large stock pot is perfect for making soup, boiling pasta, or preparing large batches of food. Look for one that is heavy-duty and can distribute heat evenly.
- **Roasting Pan**: If you love cooking meats or vegetables in the oven, a roasting pan is essential. Choose a pan with high sides and sturdy handles for easy maneuvering.
- **Cups and Mugs**: For your morning coffee or tea, a set of decorative cups and mugs can brighten your kitchen. Opt for varying styles to suit different occasions and preferences.

Equipping your kitchen with these essential dishes not only prepares you for daily cooking but also enhances your hosting capabilities. Each piece serves a purpose and combines functionality with style. You want your kitchen to reflect your taste while ensuring it meets the practical needs of meal preparation and serving.

Creative Ways to Organize and Store Your Kitchen Dishware
---------------------------------------------------------

When it comes to organizing and storing your kitchen dishware, creativity can transform your culinary space into a more functional and appealing area. Dishes are an essential part of your dining experience, and keeping them neat and accessible can enhance your cooking and entertaining. Here are some inventive ideas to help you efficiently organize and store your kitchen dishware.

Claim Here: https://digitalgooglyus.com/home-essentials-kitchen-dishes  
  
### Utilize Vertical Space

Making the most of vertical space is crucial in a kitchen. Here are some practical tips:

- **Wall-Mounted Racks:** Install a wall-mounted rack to hang plates and bowls. This not only saves cupboard space but also adds a decorative element to your kitchen.
- **Floating Shelves:** Use floating shelves to display your favorite dishware. This approach keeps your dishes accessible while showcasing your style.
- **Tall Cabinets:** If you have tall cabinets, utilize stackable containers to maximize the height.

### Leverage Drawer Dividers

Keeping your dishes organized in drawers is made easy by using dividers. Here‚Äôs how you can do it:

Claim Here: https://digitalgooglyus.com/home-essentials-kitchen-dishes  
  
- **Custom Dividers:** Invest in custom dividers that fit your drawer size. Segregating different types of dishware like plates, bowls, and cups keeps them neat and easy to find.
- **Adjustable Inserts:** Consider adjustable drawer inserts. This flexibility allows you to change the layout as your needs evolve.

### Experiment with Baskets and Bins

Baskets and bins are not only functional but also add a touch of charm to your kitchen. Here's how to incorporate them:

- **Woven Baskets:** Use woven baskets to hold smaller dishware items. Place them on shelves or countertops to offer easy access while adding texture to your kitchen decor.
- **Clear Plastic Bins:** Utilize clear bins for organization. Label each bin according to the content, whether it‚Äôs dinnerware or bakeware, making it simple to locate what you need.

### Optimize Cabinet Layout

Your cabinet layout can significantly impact dishware organization. To optimize your space:

Claim Here: https://digitalgooglyus.com/home-essentials-kitchen-dishes  
  
- **Lazy Susans:** a lazy Susan in your cabinets can improve accessibility. Place your dishes on the turntable so you can reach them easily, even in the back.
- **Pull-Out Shelves:** If you can, install pull-out shelves. They help you avoid digging through stacks of dishes to find what you're looking for.

### Incorporate Hooks and Pegboards

Hooks and pegboards are versatile options that can help you maintain a tidy kitchen:

- **Hooks:** Attach hooks inside cabinet doors to hang lightweight dishware items such as mugs. This strategy makes the best use of underutilized space.
- **Pegboards:** Install a pegboard on a wall for a creative display option. You can hang everything from plates to utensils, turning storage into art.

### Store Dishes in Different Stations

Instead of storing all your dishware in one place, consider various stations:

Claim Here: https://digitalgooglyus.com/home-essentials-kitchen-dishes  
  
- **Serving Area:** Set up a dedicated serving area in your kitchen where larger dishes and platters can be stored for easy reach during meals or gatherings.
- **Baking Area:** Keep baking dishware near your prep area. This makes it convenient when you're whipping up sweet treats.

### Consider Dish Rack Options

Dish racks can be more than just drying stations. Here are some interesting uses:

- **Multi-Tiered Racks:** Use multi-tiered dish racks to display plates while they dry. This keeps them organized and allows them to air out properly.
- **Expandable Racks:** Look for expandable dish racks that can adjust in size according to your needs. This adaptability is perfect for various dishware sizes.

By implementing these innovative methods, you can effectively organize and store your kitchen dishware in a way that suits your lifestyle. Remember, a well-organized kitchen not only looks good but also makes cooking and serving more enjoyable. Get creative, use the space you have, and design a kitchen setup that enhances your cooking experience!

### Conclusion

Every kitchen can benefit from a well-curated selection of essential dishes and thoughtful organization. When you equip your home with the right kitchen dishes‚Äîsuch as versatile plates, functional bowls, and durable cookware‚Äîyou ensure that meal preparation and dining become easy and enjoyable experiences. These essentials not only serve practical purposes but also contribute to the overall ambiance of your home.

By categorizing your items and stacking dishes wisely, you can maximize space and reduce clutter, making your cooking area more inviting.

1i3tb24,https://www.reddit.com/r/BabyBumps/comments/1i3tb24/mild_weight_concerns/,Mild Weight Concerns,"17wks today and I'm just a teeny bit worried about being a teeny bit ""underweight"" for my stage, or not quite gaining at the rate that I ""should"" be.

I read through a weight-related thread here recently and it seemed like almost everyone was saying it really doesn't matter all that much overall; I saw you folks basically say everything from you gained 100lbs to you gained 5lbs (I may be mildly exaggerating, lol), or it was mostly at the beginning or it was mostly toward the end, and no one on your care team was worried, and you and your baby turned out fine, etc. So, I think it's probably fine, but like I said I am just \*mildly\* concerned at this point.

I think lil friend may just be having a growth spurt, hehe...I did read today that they are starting to make fat cells! And I feel like I keep reading it's going to double in size, like all the time, I dunno, lol...

**Some more details below, optional, and I guess in general I'm looking for reassurance, and/or if anyone thinks this is something I should worry about (and yes, I will ask my care team too),**  
**and also, does anyone have ideas for how to either:**  
**a) track your food with some app that does NOT involve weight loss, for crying out loud? lol, like calories and nutrients?**  
**and/or**  
**b) start to add more food into your daily life, now that I guess I am at a stage in the pregnancy where I \*actually\* need more calories than usual? I'm thinking of maybe making a batch of smoothies for the week or something? I like them but hate cleaning the blender, so maybe a few at a time would help. Oh and vegan-friendly ideas, pretty please. <3**

Some deets:

\-started at a ""normal"" ""healthy"" ""average"" type BMI, for general reference, although we know BMI is mostly stupid and innacurate in a lot of ways. I'm generally seen as ""thin/slender"" but really am just kinda average/medium/small-to-medium size, never been even close to ""underweight"" and I think I have just-fine muscle tone (for someone who doesn't work out as much as she'd like) and bone density (educated guessing), and enough fat to have regularly menstruated for ever, etc. Mesomorph body type? idk.

\-was sorta nauseous first trimester but seemingly to an average or minor degree. Def not nearly HG, I didn't puke once (like 2-3 close calls, lol) and was eating and drinking. Not much nausea so far in the second, feeling mostly decent and reasonably hungry.

\-gained about 5lbs in first tri, which seems to be just about the ""correct"" amount for my starting point.

\-When they checked my iron at my first appointment they said my levels were great, and to ""keep taking my prenatal with iron."" Felt like a big win because while I AM taking a prenatal, it doesn't have iron and I don't think I have ever taken an iron supplement, so that made me feel like I was generally doing a good job on the whole nutrients-from-food thing!

\-for kinda random (work-related) reasons, I had some of my major organs (heart, lungs, kidneys, spleen...) looked at with an ultrasound recently, and they were all real nice-looking, according to some med students. :D I learned I have a small fat pad on my heart, which apparently is normal and healthy, and provides a lil cushion, and which made me think I am probably eating a just-fine amount of fat/calories in general in my life.

\-I got really sick for about 24-48hrs about two weeks ago, probably with one of these trendy stomach bugs that's so hip this year, lol, or maybe some sort of food poisoning, so I lost like 3lbs in two days, and it's entirely possible I'm still catching up.  
I did think I ""caught up"" last week, as it seemed like the 3lbs was more or less back, and I even thought I had gained another pound for the week. But I got home from a week-long house-sit the other day, so I was using someone elses scale while away, and probably don't weigh myself at the same time every day, though I try to do it before eating anything and without much clothing...and anyway yesterday it seemed like I was down a pound and today it seemed I was down another. :\_(

\-Have been vegetarian for about a million years, and vegan/mostly vegan for the past 15 or so. During that time my weight has fluctuated up and down depending on various factors, but all within the ""healthy"" range, and within about 15 or so pounds. I'm medium height for a gal, about 5' 5"", so +/- 15lbs is noticeable but not life-altering. I say all this about the fluctuating mostly to say that while I was on the lower end of my usual range when I got pregnant, it's not like I'm immune to gaining weight just because I'm vegan.

\-I eat a pretty healthy and varied diet, but-and not extremely healthy or strict or picky aside from not eating animal foods *(mostly - I'll occasionally eat non-vegan baked goods someone shares, or other treats, and I sometimes eat fish/eggs/dairy when I travel, very occasionally, but I'm not the sort of ""vegan"" to eat a bacon cheeseburger on sundays or something, lol)* , lots of fresh and processed fruits and veggies, whole grains, non-whole grains lol (meaning white flour, white rice, etc), tofu, almonds/almond butter, peanuts/peanut butter, all kinds of other nuts, pumpkin seeds, tea/coffee, soy milk, sugar and honey but also stevia, pasta, pizza, crappy fake cheese, better fake cheese, cookies, lemonade, electrolyte drinks, water (just saying lol), oatmeal, raisins, chocolate, candy (not a ton, just saying), snacks, blah blah blah. Some of my favorite foods are broccoli, chickpeas/hummus, mashed potatoes, salads, and cake, hehe.

\-my exercise level isn't that great; not sedentary but not consistent, and right now most of my exercise is from walking around, chores, various work-related things, and then occasionally something more intentional. This week I went lap-swimming for the first time in awhile, and I'd like to try and make that a regular thing, once or twice a week...maybe I lost a pound swimming? lol idk.

\-I am on a stimulant for ADHD, and I also have ADHD lol, and also a weird and varied ""schedule,"" so I am somewhat disorganized in general and with food, and I do spend a large part of the day with somewhat dampened hunger signals. I try to make sure and just eat 2-6 (lol) meals a day, and not wait to feel ""hungry"" since I know all this. Honestly before I was medicated I think my hunger signals were even more messed up, in that I never really felt satisfied, even when I felt physically full, so I think if anything, as long as I don't ""forget"" or neglect to eat, I'm healthier eating-wise on the meds. (and yes, I've fully discussed to-meds-or-not-to-meds with my care team, so this isn't a discussion about that.)

\-heartburn, yes, at least once a day, ugh. especially if I bend down to do anything, and especially later in the day/night, possibly because I tend to eat the bigger meal(s) then. I also think I have had more of a tendency toward heartburn for reasons that precede pregnancy. Have started keeping some tums on hand and eating usually 1-3 a day. *(but would like to get some of the ""naturals"" ones I saw online, now that I've read the artifical color etc. ingredients, ick.)*

whew! well that was all a lot, thanks in advance to anyone who read this! and for any advice/tips/anecdotes.

Let‚Äôs face it‚Äîmost Indian podcasts are just repackaged TV interviews with a new logo slapped on. They‚Äôre not podcasts; they‚Äôre glorified Q&A sessions where the host sticks to a rigid script like a nervous HR manager. The guest talks, the host nods, and we all pretend it‚Äôs groundbreaking content. Add some pseudo-science (Yeti ka Sach,"" ""Ravana ka Punarjanm,"" ""Aliens ka Rahasya"") or thinly-veiled PR for scammers, and you‚Äôve got the typical Indian ""podcast.""  

Now compare that to something like Joe Rogan, Lex Fridman, or Rich Roll. These guys don‚Äôt do interviews‚Äîthey have conversations. Podcasts are meant to be unscripted, organic discussions where you start on one topic and naturally drift into another. It‚Äôs not about sticking to a Q&A format but about letting ideas evolve, exploring tangents, and creating those ""Oh damn, I never thought of that!"" moments.  

What we get in India, though, feels like someone rehashing Aap Ki Adalat or Coffee With Karan but calling it a podcast. Why can‚Äôt we have thoughtful, deep, and real conversations that go beyond the surface? Is there any Indian podcast that captures that free-flowing vibe, or are we forever stuck with scripted sensationalism disguised as content?  

Let me know if I‚Äôm missing out on something truly good‚Äîor if I need to start our own desi Rogan experience.

1i3t8mo,https://www.reddit.com/r/BreakUps/comments/1i3t8mo/mourning_the_adventurous_life_i_29f_could_have/,"Mourning the adventurous life I (29F) could have lived with my ex (37M), and I can't stop feeling sad, bitter & resentful about it. (Very long venting post, including reasons why we broke up).","Let me preface by saying - I have Not been able to go no contact with my ex since we broke up last April, because he is my coworker. We are nurses that work on the same hospital floor. I am on night shifts and he works dayshifts- and while we work opposite schedules/opposite weekends, sometimes schedules get switched around where we are forced to cross paths with one another, and sometimes we have to give each other nursing reports. Our manager & assistant managers are aware that we dated and broke up, but sometimes you just can't help it with the scheduling.  
Because of this, we have been caught in an unhealthy post-break up loop for more than 9 months now, and it has been a mind twisting, emotional torture in a way. (We only dated for 5 months- but it was intense). We have also been in a ""friends with benefits"" situation in these 9 almost 10 months post break up - and even though I feel wrong about it after the fact, the familiarity with him makes it easy to slip back into it. He has tried to reassure me that he wants me as a friend than nothing at all, and though I've tried multiple times to say I don't want to be intimate anymore, he always pushes the boundaries, and is used to me always caving and having sex with him. (Not in an SA sort of way - he hasn't tried to force himself on me physically) I just mean emotionally, and because I have that physical/sexual familiarity tie with him, my physical desires take over so we end up sleeping together again. He tells me he enjoys having sex with me and it doesn't bother him even though we are ""friends"" and when I tell him I feel wrong about it, he tells me that hurts him. So anyway me caving and ending up sleeping with him - I take responsibility for my lack of strength there, and contribution to this twistedness. But I still want and Need to write this post. When he has told me he is my ""friend"" and wants me as a friend, he still uses manipulative tactics with me, especially when I've tried to set boundaries. But those tactics work on me too easily, unfortunately. I feel stuck in it. And I've been having to walk on eggshells, because if I set clear boundaries and tell him ""No"" and stick by it, he will either give me the cold shoulder, gaslight me &/or I might have to face emotional repercussions from him outside and inside of the work setting.

Since he and I broke up, I think we've both been struggling with a continuous attachment to one another. Not only did we date but we also in a way became eachother's only and closest friends. I don't have any family in this city where we live, and he is a bit introverted (though charming & outgoing to peers) - so we became to eachother the kind of friend if you will who you could call and say ""hey wanna go see that movie?"" or ""hey wanna go get burritos later?"" Any other (friend) is the type that you feel like you're inconveniencing for reaching out to and they have to find time on their calendar to hang out with you.

So needless to say that has made things extremely difficult and hard for both of us to let go, especially me since I don't have family or other close friends here. (He lives with some family who live here).

My ex and I first connected at work when we found out that we both speak the same foreign language. We also connected over an interest in traveling, and some unique commonalities/connections we had . He's older than I am so he's obviously done more traveling than I have, and his family also lives overseas. He's a dual citizen american and of the european country they're from - so he travels back there often to see his siblings and parents. It's one of the most beautiful countries in the world and of course while he's there he has access and is a hop-skip away to the other beautiful countries. He plans to move back there someday in the next few years, and of course when you start dating someone like this, you can't help but imagine what your future could look like together. Moving overseas with him, living a beautiful and adventurous life of travel and romance etc, country hopping. It's hard to let this go and come to terms that this will never happen now, and that he will eventually move on and find the next woman in his life to live this adventurous life with. While I've unfollowed (*not unfriended because I find that too harsh*) him and his sisters and mother on facebook, I can't help but occasionally look on their pages every so often, and see them posting about their amazing life, which just feels like salt rubbing into my wounds.

Knowing him, I know he probably takes solace in the *win* that me not going back to him is my loss since I won't be able to go to and live in Europe with him now. But as hard of a pill as this is to swallow, it's simply not enough of a pro vs con for me to have continued being with him.

***Now let me explain the reasons why we broke up:***

I could sit here and write a whole article on why we broke up. And I apologize that this will likely run very long, so if you're willing to read- I appreciate it. Please understand that I know my general faults in life and in this situation, so this is not me trying to act like I'm perfect. I'm just going to list things, in no particular order. And some of these things are out of order, either *before* or *after* we broke up.

1). **He was intensely rushing the relationship** (as many ""older"" men in new relationships tend to do from my understanding) **and figuratively pushing me into a corner, while being totally uninvested in getting to know me as a person or my life. -** Not only did he say I love you Really fast without really having gotten to know me - (which ok I know some people claim to ""*know*"" right away) and insisted on introducing me to his family *really* quickly (*in the same intensity as if we'd been dating for a long time--we'd only been seeing each other for maybe a week at that point.. he even got me to drive to Canada with him to meet his parents who were visiting from overseas*) - but he made Everything about Him and his life and would try to basically force his life onto me, while never engaging with me to get to know me. *Never* asking questions about my life. Even if I tried to bring things up about my parents or things I was interested in etc, he would half-listen and then interrupt me, and change the subject to talk more about his interests, his siblings, his dog, his niece and nephews, his sister in law, his parents etc. I felt like he wasn't interested in *me*, for who I was,  but rather created an *idea* of me, and the role I could play in his life.

He lives with his older brother, sister in law and their kids - so he is actively involved in their life. Without even having gotten a chance to organically get to know these people on my own, within a week (and again mind you, the conversation being 90% about him, 10% about me, even if I tried) he would blow my phone up with pictures & videos of his niece and nephews, pictures of his dog. Conversations (and even now) would always be about what *he* wanted to talk about. It really got to a point where it felt like he was wanting me to play an ""aunty"" role to kids I barely knew, to act like a Stepmom to his dog I barely knew. I would try to sometimes talk about my parents dog (an english bulldog who I loved very much and knew well because they got her when I still lived with them before moving here) and he would either ignore it completely or just respond with a short response like ""haha."" and then send 10 more photos of HIS dog. Almost as if to make a point that his dog was more important and I should be paying more focus on HIS dog now. He would make comments to me like ""you had the pleasure of meeting Zeke."" On a walk in the park one day we were talking about something else, we come across a small stream under a bridge and he goes ""you know who really loves streams?"" and i start thinking he's gonna bring a person up, he says ""Zeke does.""  
We never went on dates together, even if I suggested it, he'd find an excuse why we couldn't (usually the dog). It was always that we'd either do an activity with the dog or him bringing me over to his brother's house and forcing me to play with his niece and nephews. I tried to be polite about it, but as time went on, my patience level was running really thin and I was becoming increasingly more unhappy.  
(I guess an anology for how it felt would be like if you and I were in a room together and you liked pop music and I liked jazz. And every time you said ""oh I like pop music"" instead of me asking you to elaborate more on that and asking you questions about who your favorite pop artists were and to show me some of your favorite songs - I would instead inch towards you closer into your personal space everytime you started mentioning pop and saying ""I like jazz. You should listen to jazz. No you ARE going to listen to Jazz. Jazz is your favorite genre now. Here is my favorite jazz album, I got it for you for your birthday."")

**--** As previously mentioned/implied, he would push his interests onto me. For example he is really into wine, really into running. While I was very interested in hearing more about winemaking etc, it was his thing not mine. I am into making music (which by the way the one time he listened to me play something, he fell asleep), I enjoy listening to certain artists, playing piano. For christmas 2024 I got him a cool wine opener, a foreign language version of his favorite book that we had talked about when we first met, and sketch books & journal because he had mentioned that he used to enjoy sketching and writing poetry and had shown me some. For christmas he got me 2 books on wine making, and a headlamp just like the one he had for running & walking at night, and a stuffed animal of a german Shepard (the breed his dog is). On the contrary, a friend of mine who I hardly see, got me a piano book. Because she actually bothers to know and care about me.

**--** One time (shortly before we broke up) we were planning a road trip together. I had mentioned a ton that I enjoy swimming and am not a runner - and I had mentioned that I really don't enjoy running. The trip out of town we were planning seemed clear that it was going to be a leisurely trip of us enjoying the city were were visiting together. Then out of the blue he tells me that he's planning on us doing a ""run"" there together, a 10k run event there. This upset me because he was clearly pushing something on to me that I wouldn't be interested in doing even though I'd said multiple times that I don't enjoy running & marathons. I finally said to him ""I really feel like you like the idea of me more than me for who I am."" and he got EXTREMELY defensive and started gaslighting me and putting words into my mouth. And then when I completely ignored him, he did a 180 and started love-bombing me to try to get my attention back (this was all through text).

2). **He's very immature for his age and would fib/withhold info, be selfish and he could be very manipulative when he didn't get his way. -** Yes this is coming from someone who is significantly younger than he is. But let me tell you, I've been around enough people in his age group to know that most people his age have a sense of responsibility & maturity in the way they carry themselves. Here are some examples of this point #2.  
**--** He would always expect me to stay over at his place, but he never wanted to stay over at mine, and always used the dog as an excuse. He would take his dog with him everywhere (he had an unhealthy attachment/obsessions with his dog). Even when I tried to tell him that the dog could come stay at my place with us, he would come up with excuses. Whenever he did come to my place, he would purposely leave the dog in his car, come up, initiate sex, and then he'd use the dog as an excuse to leave saying ""You want the good news or the bad news? Good news is I loved kissing you, bad news is I better go, Zeke is in the car. "" And then he'd get changed really fast and then kiss me and leave. It was like this and he would say this. Every. Single. Time.  
**--** I had given a lot of my time and focus on him and his family because that's what he seemed to expect out of me, doing things constantly to try to please him and be polite. Finally one day when one of *my* family members finally came into town (my godmother), I was excited for him to meet someone from my life. She was there on a short layover in our city, she asked if I wanted to meet for dinner. Of course I asked him to join me as I wanted to introduce her to my new boyfriend, and he came up with every excuse under the sun to not come with me. The main one being that his back was hurting. I didn't want to push because I didn't want to question the pain he claimed to have, but I was really disappointed that for once he didn't try to bend in my direction and compromise to try to please me for a change.  
The worst part of it was that on the way back, driving home from seeing my godmother, he had the audacity to call me to ask if I was headed over to his place. So he didn't make the effort to meet my godmother/someone from my life, but he still expected me to do what was most convenient for him, and go to his place and have sex with him and then stay over.  
Later on when I pointed out this story to him as an example of his selfishness (right after we broke up), he started these crocodile tears with me and randomly brought up a story about how he had gotten a couple of DUI's in the past (trying to get me to feel sorry for him) and then regarding my godmother he makes up some excuse/lie and he says to me ""there's something I didn't tell you about that day."" and I said ""what."" and he goes ""I wanted to treat you and your godmother to dinner, but I didn't have enough money that day."" Let me remind you that this grown man is an RN who makes decent money, and lives RENT FREE with his brother and sister in law and would always spend money for himself on random things to fund his running and outdoor activities, and his dog etc. I don't even want to go into the fact that he's perfectly ok living off his brother and sister in law for free despite the fact they have kids and a household to pay for, and him being a late 30's male has no incentive or drive whatsoever to live in his own place, to save for a downpayment on a home or atleast insist on paying his family some rent money. So him telling me he was broke the day I invited him to dinner because I wanted him to meet my godmother (*even though I would have definitely offered and insisted on paying for the dinner),* his made-up excuse of being broke was a bunch of bullcrap. I know he had money, he just didn't want to go that day and he was lying to my face.

**--** Another example was a time when I was **STILL** trying to please him (to avoid being stonewalled by him) even after we broke up. We had broken up in April of 2024, but he was still actively involving himself in my life (I think a control thing) and I was still letting him because I wasn't fully over the attachment to him. One of the commonalities that I mentioned at the beginning was that he grew up in a city (in a different state) which I happened to know well because my aunt and uncle live there (and so did my grandmother when she was still living); So I would visit there in the summers growing up and was familiar with the area he'd happen to grow up in. It was the summer of last year (July 2024), and I decided to take a trip for a week to visit my aunt and uncle, because my uncle is elderly and battling bladder cancer. I wanted to go spend time with him and them, because who knows how much longer he has. Because it would only be a short visit, I really wanted to prioritize spending quality time with them. I wouldn't have time to do other things.  
My ex, despite this information, was putting a TON of pressure on me to go do x,y & z while I was visiting his hometown. And he especially put pressure on me to visit these 2 specific girls he knew who he said were really close friends of his who he had grown up with. I told him, MULTIPLE. TIMES. that ""Hey, I'm really going there to spend time with my uncle who is sick."" Yet he didn't care, and absolutely disregarded this and would say ""ok I get that but I really think you should go and visit my friend (Jane) and (Anna)."" and then proceeded to say ""I texted them your phone number, here is the number of my friend Jane. And there was no further engagement on the relationship with my aunt and uncle, questions about my uncle etc. It was all about my ex and the fact that it was HIS hometown and him telling me what to do and setting out expectations for me to see HIS friends, and visiting such and such places and shops. (not to mention that he claims these girls were always JUST friends of his - and even after we broke up; in May of 2024 he had taken a road trip to his home state and took pictures with himself and one of these girls (Anna), cheek-to-cheek, and made a point to text me the photos he took with and of her. He played it off like he was only innocently sharing and I actually believed him but now in the back of my mind I know he was trying to make me feel jealous.

Well because my ex is manipulative and self-centered, I know that if in this whole time if I don't do everything that he asks of me and if I actually speak up and set boundaries or say no, he stonewalls me and gives me the cold shoulder all of a sudden. So because I was afraid of this, and because he had me so entwined emotionally despite the toxicity, I still made time to meet up with one of his friends (Jane) who was the only one who actually reached out to me, to her credit. She ended up being very nice, and we met for coffee and had a nice chat. I sent him a picture of us and he acted so pleased and happy. I even went to visit one of the places he told me to visit and took photos for him. While they were pleasant experiences, I only did these things to try to please him. And he didn't seem to actually care about that. He had a short memory. One thing to please this guy would quickly be forgotten, and on to the next thing he expects of me, to please him.  
Let me remind you that he insisted that these were ""good friends"" of his, and I actually trusted him on that.  
As it actually turns out, later he tells me had a 2 year relationship with ""Jane"" when he was in highschool and thought he was ""in love with her"" he says, and he had a sexual relationship with Anna.

**--** The week we broke up (in April of last year) I was really upset because I really didn't *want* to break up, but I was so unhappy and pushed into a corner that I felt I had no other choice. It was really hard (and still is) to accept that he would Never change. He acted super dramatically as if he didn't expect it coming, texting me right away to try to guilt trip me saying ""thank you for all the good times together little star"" ""I just read through all of our old texts and it made me sad"" ""goodbye my little star"" as if I was dead or something. Like it hadn't even been half an hour since he left my apartment and he was texting me these things. A hundred to zero. And then he made it even harder by texting me that night and saying ""I was just wondering if you might consider giving this a second chance.""  
I cried because I so badly wanted to but I knew he would never change. He was the type that would *pretend* to change, for maybe a day, but then things would return right as they were, and he would expect me to act like nothing happened, as if no conversation happened, and things would carry on the way they were, things would be the way he wanted, and I would continue on being miserable.

The weekend after our break up, I went on a weekend trip with a friend to celebrate her birthday. It was myself, my friend and another friend of hers. Instead of leaving me alone, the whole weekend he was texting me and trying to use gaslighting phrases to blame me and guilt trip me back into being in a relationship with him. I wished I had the strength to ignore it but he was really deeply affecting me and I was feeding into it. It pretty much ruined my weekend with my friends. And he had nearly successfully manipulated me enough to consider giving him a second chance.  
When I got home from the weekend, I finally had this realization of ""What the hell is wrong with me."" I realized I was allowing this guy to manipulate me and treat me a certain way because he wasn't getting his way and how immature & toxic it was. And that if he truly cared about and respected me (instead of viewing me as a tool for his own self interests), he would never be treating me this way. He was just upset that I wasn't putting up with his behavior, and he wasn't willing to change. So initially while I had agreed that he and I could talk in person when I got back, I ended up texting him and saying ""you know what, I thought about it some more.."" and basically told him it was probably the right choice for us to be broken up/separated. About an hour after sending this text, he texts me and says ""Just a heads up. I'm heading over to your place to drop off some stuff."" and he shows up to my apartment with a Trash Bag full of random petty things, notes that I had written him, momentos from our relationship, even things like a menu to a chinese restaurant we had gone to, the christmas gifts I'd given him etc."" He handed it to me coldly and then walked away. He was trying to hurt me and make me feel like it was all my fault, but he was just pissed that he failed at manipulating me and I actually held my ground. He upset me so much though that I actually called our work manager to ask for a transfer waiver to work on a different floor. But I ended up deciding to cancel the transfer waiver because I didn't think it would look good on my resume to leave the job less than a year in (at that point).

**--** He doesn't really seem to have much of a mind of his own. He follows suit with whatever his older sisters and older brother do. Doesn't try to forge a life of his own. Granted his older sisters live a very adventurous life, and he often tried to push me to act like his sisters were my instant best friends even though I didn't know them at all. Pressured me to follow and reach out to them on social media. When he's with them he does whatever they plan for him. He's more of a follower than a leader. He honestly implied one time that he wanted me to be like one of his older sisters. And being his partner would essentially be me living the life of whatever his sisters and older brother had planned. There were times when I wanted to tell him ""why don't you go and marry your sister""

3). **He prioritized the relationship he had with his dog over me.**

**--** I love dogs and I'm not the type of woman to tell a man he has to choose me over the dog. But in this situation it was bad. My ex is obsessed with his dog. Every photo he posts on his social media is of his dog. He'll write captions as if the dog is speaking in first person. He'll write about the dog in third person.

All of our time together, even from the very beginning, would be planned around the dog. As mentioned previously, he never wanted to go on dates together, he only wanted me to join him on activities that involved his dog. Even our first ""date"" was me walking his dog with him in the park. He would constantly talk about the dog and as I said, if I tried to mention my parents' dog who I loved, he would steamroll me to force me to see more photos and hear more about his dog.  
So you can only imagine how tired I was of this dog. And I felt bad, because it wasn't the dog's fault. But my ex was imposing him on me constantly.

But it got even weirder, in that when I would go to my ex's house, not only was the dog's hair all over the bedding, but when my ex and I were getting intimate, he would often let the dog jump on the bed, so the dog would be ON the bed while my ex and I were having sex, or the dog would start whining while my ex and I were having sex, and he would stop mid-sex to give affection and attention to the dog. Petting him ""Zeke whatcha doing buddy??""

Most guys would take their women on dates, plan trips together without the pet, kick the dog out of the room so that them and their partners can be privately intimate together. Nope not with my ex.

**--** Remember when I mentioned that my ex and I were planning a trip out of town (the trip where he was nonchalantly planning & expecting me to run a marathon with him even though he knew I didn't enjoy running). Well after the running thing was forgotten about, we were planning the trip. As I said, he involved the dog with all of our time together. I honestly felt like the pet while the dog was his girlfriend. That's genuinely how it felt. (Although I'm sure if he read that he'd laugh and find that funny).

But anyway, I really for once wanted to enjoy a trip with him, just me and him, without the dog. I don't have a very strong sort of personality, so I didn't feel comfortable straight up telling him ""We are NOT bringing this dog."" instead I tried to gently ask ""hey, is there anyway you might consider leaving Zeke here for the weekend? (we were only going for a weekend)..so that we could enjoy time together just you and me?"" Well needless to say, my ex came up with EVERY excuse under the sun as to why he couldn't leave the dog here for the weekend. Even though whenever my ex has gone on trips overseas, he magically finds a way for the dog to be taken care of several weeks at a time (via his brother & a dog-walker taking care of the dog - the dog never goes to boarding). He could have easily asked his brother to take care of the dog for the weekend, by my ex simply wasn't willing and wanted things his way. And he knew I was a pushover. Little did he know that this was the trip that would finally give me to push to break up with him because I was so over it.  
I also really wanted to go just me and him, because the thing were were going to see out of town involved crowds where there would likely be other dogs. And my ex's dog has behavioral issues and doesn't get along with other dogs, is aggressive towards them. Any dog in sight and his dog Zeke loses his crap and gets aggressive.  
We ended up leaving way later than I had asked (on my ex's time per usual), and in planning, he got me to look for an airbnb that accepted dogs. In the message I sent to the host about the dog, I accidentally got Zeke's age wrong, with which my ex took offense and quickly corrected me (""Zeke is 6, not 7."")

The trip turned out to be an absolute disaster and I was so miserable. The day that was meant to be spent sighseeing was completely ruined because he insisted on bringing his dog. There were tons of people, and we could not take 10 steps without the dog absolutely losing it and trying to attack other dogs. It was also chilly outside, and time was wasted and ruined because he had to constantly coax and calm the dog down. So we were unable to enjoy the area or day, and all of it could have been avoided if my ex had respected my wishes or listened to what I had said. I know he could tell I was upset but per usual he expected me to just shove it under the rug and forget about me being upset, and he forced me to pose for pictures, and then even though he knew I was really upset, he still made a point to post pictures of us and the dog on facebook, for all our coworkers to see, I think it was a control thing because he knew I was mad but he wanted me to feel unable to do or say anything because we'd already put on a show (via his pictures) to our coworkers.  
The rest of the trip was so unenjoyable. Other parts of the city I wanted to visit he would shoot me down because ""we couldn't leave the dog in the car.""

On the trip back, I started talking about plans I had to maybe leave the state we both live in to go pursue something else. And he took it so personally and said ""well what about us then?"" (at this point I was so upset and over this horrible trip that I nearly wanted to break up with him then and there but I didn't) instead I said ""I don't know."" and then he started yelling and raising his voice at me in the car and getting very angry because I insinuated leaving the city to go somewhere else. He was quiet the rest of trip, I felt too afraid to say anything else, and he turned up the music in his car and would turn around and pet his dog like his dog was his therapy animal or something.  
This trip happened in april by the way, right before I broke up with him.

4) **Other random things I've noticed lately:**  
**--** He was always pushing his country and culture on me. Even though my family come from their own unique culture, he didn't show much interest or pay mind, he seemed to want to push the idea of me completely incorporating his country into my life. This last time he went to visit the country (about 4 months ago), he tried to pressure me to go with him. I had to find strength within me to say no, though I had to find an excuse so that he wouldn't emotionally retaliate against me for it. I even took care of his dog for him while he was gone. I've come to realize that him pressuring me to go to the europe with me was his way of trying to woo me or charm me back into being with him. While the opportunity to see the country would have been amazing, I know there were ulterior motives here, and this would have been a ploy for him to try to manipulate me back into being with him. And even if I had stood my ground as a ""friend"" he would've been pissed and probably used it against me saying something like ""I've done so much for you, I even brought you with me to my country"" etc. I can see it now.  
The reason I also know it's a ploy and his trick to try to woo a woman, is because a couple months ago, I was out getting food with him, and I happened to see pictures of him and his ex in his country. He also had taken her to Paris. So clearly he was trying to do the exact same thing with me. This felt so cheap and shallow. Because I know for me personally, I wouldn't want to bring a guy to my parent's home country with me unless it was the man I knew I was going to marry. Not every romantic interest in my life. I asked him, ""do you bring every girlfriend to (the country)"" and he tried to downplay it, ""it was just something that seemed fun at the time"" and then changed the subject. I also saw pictures of his ex girlfriend chummy with his mom and sisters. So clearly the push to be besties with his sisters and mom is a common theme here too. And he doesn't at all talk to the ex anymore (as far as I know). So in a way I'm actually proud of myself that I didn't add myself to the list of girls he's taken to europe.

**--** Conversational incompatibilities. I like to talk about things at length and in-depth, he likes to talk about things superficially. Mainly all he wanted to talk about were what his sister did, what his brother did on an outting with his niece, things that happened at work.. every day things. Mind you most of his communication is via text. But in person I feel like our conversations reach a lull. We don't like talking about the same things and in the same way. I couldn't have long in depth conversations with him about things. I also felt like his humor was really immature, and he would make childish jokes a lot that I didn't find funny. Just not a very mature person. I feel like he would make himself 10x more attractive by being  generally more mature and acting his age, being more responsible and forging a life for himself, having his own opinions - instead of doing everything his siblings map out for him and copying their opinions. I'm not really into politics but when I tried discussing those things with him, he just lost interest and would change the subject. Unless it was about everyday things & topics for him, or things he liked to discuss. After months of being involved with eachother, he couldn't even name one of my favorite artists, which doesn't surprise me since he never cared enough to ask, or listen if i tried to bring it up.

**--** He's really good at being charming in the work setting, and absolutely everybody loves him. My manager, our coworkers.. you can imagine that he gets a lot of female attention. And it's not even a jealousy thing for me, but when we broke up I feel like everybody probably just assumed that it was my fault and that I was too young for him. But really they don't know how toxic and manipulative he can be in a romantic relationship, and how childish he can be.

**--** Last thing I'll add cause while it's therapeutic to organize and remember all these things, it is exhausting. My ex didn't respect my time or things I wanted to do. While we were dating he would always talk about planning more time together and coordinating days off together so we could spend time together. It even went as far as me asking my manager to switch weekends so he and I would be on the same weekend. On days off he wouldn't get in touch with me till nearly the evening time and then by that point all he wanted to do was go walk the dog and then have sex with me at my place, and then leave. Even the times when we did actually do *something* couple-y together, he would always cut our time short so that he could go tend to the dog who he insisted on walking atleast 3x a day. Never wanted to sacrifice time with the dog for time spent with me.  
Whenever I would try to plan a day with him, he would completely ignore it and then change the plans to be something or do things in a way *he* wanted to do. So I felt I had no control or say in the relationship.  
In regards to time; as i mentioned even though i'd ask him to meet earlier in the day, he'd still not wind up reaching out to me until early evening usually. There were times when he would insist on giving me rides to the airport when i'd fly home to visit my parents, and he would run late. Just didn't respect my time at all. The disastrous trip we took out of town with his dog, it was 6 hours away so I asked him multiple times (knowing he'd usually run late) if we could please leave early in the morning so that we could get there at a good time. As usual things ended up going his way and he showed up whenever he wanted to show up, which was mid afternoon, so we didn't end up getting to our destination until evening.

**Final Thoughts**

My ex has successfully manipulated me for well over a year now (if you include when we started dating to now, it would be a total of 14 months). And I have been weak and contributed to the toxicity because he has such an emotional stronghold over me.  
I am planning on moving out of state in the next 6 months and finding a new job.  
But I can't help despite all of this, feeling bitter that he's just going to mentally dump me eventually and view me as a loser for missing out the chance to live this amazing international life with him, going on lots of adventures that he will go on with his sisters who are world travelers. He will move to his european country and live an amazing life. And I don't wish him any ill but I just feel so salty about it (I will admit that). I wish I had a dual citizen ship but I don't, he does.

My Godmother later told me at some point, that I shouldn't be holding on to the idea of him being the key to me living an adventurous life. That I should make that life for myself.",1,1737154663.0,BreakUps,1,1.0,False

Saving money? Yeah, that felt like something only rich people could do. But guess what? I hit my $10,000 savings goal last month, and I want to tell you how I crawled out of that f\*\*ing mess.

It wasn't easy. There were setbacks, breakdowns over my sh\*tty budget, and times where I thought I was just screwed. But, step by step, things got better. Here's how I finally saved $10,000:

**1. Step One: Facing the Mess** I kept dodging my finances because it was too damn stressful. But one night, I said screw it and wrote it all down:

Income: $2,100/month after taxes

Expenses: $1,950/month (basically leaving me with $150 what a joke)

Debt: $15,000 across credit cards, medical bills, and loans

Turns out, it wasn't my income that was f\*\*\*ed up, it was my lack of a plan. So, I got serious and made a budget that squeezed every dollar till it begged for mercy.

**2. Step Two: Finding Quick Wins**

*Negotiated Bills:* I called up my internet provider and cut $15/month off my bill. I also switched to Mint Mobile and saved another $50.

*Cut Subscriptions:* Bye, Netflix and Spotify. Library apps and free trials became my best friends.

*Grocery Savings:* I started meal prepping and buying in bulk. Boom‚Äîgrocery bill down by $100.

Just like that, I freed up $200 a month, and straight into savings it went.

**3. Step Three: Hustling Hard** After cutting down expenses, I had to make more money. Here's how I hustled:

* *Side Hustles:* I walked dogs on weekends, making around $500/month.

* *Selling Sh*t:\* Over a few months, I made $1,200 selling old clothes, furniture, and random crap I didn‚Äôt need on Facebook Marketplace.

* *Freelancing:* I did some graphic design gigs on the side, racking up an extra $300/month.

Every penny of that extra income? I stashed it in a high-yield savings account (HYSA) and didn‚Äôt touch it.

**4. Step Four: Living Frugally** I had to stop blowing money on dumb sh\*t. and this is probably the main thing that helped me to win on this journey:

there is a lot of tips, I found this blog summarizing it all : ([12 Frugal Living Tips to Help You Save More Money](https://grow-my-moneyy.blogspot.com/2025/01/12-frugal-living-tips-to-help-you-save.html))

Living like this wasn‚Äôt fun, but it got me closer to my goal faster.

**5. Step Five: Automating and Treating Myself** I set up an automatic transfer of $150 into my savings account every week. Watching that account grow was the motivation I needed.

Every time I hit another $1,000 saved, I treated myself to a little reward (nothing crazy‚Äîlike a $10 coffee splurge or a $20 thrift store run).

**6. Step Six: Learning From F**\* Ups\*\* There were some months that just kicked my ass. A $900 car repair wiped out a chunk of savings. A surprise medical bill meant I had to pause saving for a bit. But I didn‚Äôt let it ruin everything‚ÄîI adjusted the budget and kept going.

**7. The Final Push**

*Cashback Apps:* I used Fetch, Ibotta, and Rakuten and racked up $300 in gift cards.

*Class Action Settlements:* Following some TikTok account got me $150 in random payouts.

*Refunds:* I called and disputed a medical bill and got $500 back (pro tip: never sleep on fighting for your money).

**The Result**

Two years later, I've saved $10,000 and knocked out $8,000 in debt. I‚Äôm not rolling in cash, but I‚Äôm finally breathing easier.

Its all about the mindset if you want you can. If you‚Äôre struggling, know that you‚Äôre not alone, and small steps really add up.",42,1737154618.0,povertyfinance,8,0.75,False

So, I got here 20‚Äì25 minutes ago, maybe. All the tables outside were taken‚Ä¶ this place is BUSY! We managed to get a table inside. It‚Äôs my first time here, and the place is cute with a wall full of coffee mugs. I think if you order coffee here to go, they write quotes on the paper cups too? I haven‚Äôt ordered a coffee, though, because I‚Äôm a matcha girl, and unfortunately, they don‚Äôt do matcha üò≠! I got an iced peach tea, and it was yum‚Äîkind of what you‚Äôd expect, but not as sweet as Lipton lol.

For food, we got two CHICKEN SANDOS and one BEEF SANDO. I loved my chicken sandos! When I finished, there was some sauce and spring onions left on my plate‚Ä¶ I actually picked it up with my finger to eat it because it was DELICIOUS. The CHICKEN was tender! My mate rated this 9/10, and I agree. I said one thing to my mate as a joke, though, when we got the food: ‚ÄúWHY IS YOUR CHICKEN SANDO BIGGER THAN MINE? ü§£ü§£ü§£‚Äù

The beef sando my other mate rated 8/10 and said it reminded him of a Big Mac. I took a bite too‚Äîit tasted like a burger in sandwich form, yes. Delicious too.

Service was really quick. The slight annoyance was that there were 5‚Äì7ish flies inside the shop, but I guess can always sit outside. Would recommend this place for sure cuz the food was AWESOME!!! Curious about Pancake Sunday and Taco Friday now!!!",15,1737154596.0,aucklandeats,18,0.86,False

Hello there!! As the title says, I am looking for a casual chat partner to make days stress-free. Who doesn't want a bit of dopamine? It's easier said than done, to be honest, but if you are here, hopefully, we will connect.

I am 39 from UK, a working professional who landed on Reddit by chance and just got hooked on it, as most of us do, due to wonderful communities and subs. I am married and father to a wonderful daughter whom I love to the moon and back.

So, what am I seeking here? That's a good question, and to be honest, I am just trying to explore and discover myself. Yes, at this age, I am. I have been working rigorously for the last 15 years nonstop and have given my all to my family and running finances, but in the last couple of years it has been a landslide spiral down in my personal space, so  I decided that I should pay a bit of attention to discovering outside my monotonous life.

Please do not judge me. I love my family to the core, but this whole thing is about me, and I don't want to give an explanation about it to anyone else; perhaps someone in my situation will understand my point of view.

I am a shy and introverted personality with a minimum social circle. I am an exceptionally good listener and I never judge. A kind heart who always prioritizes smiles on others rather on self - as my near ones say. I give off nerd vibes - so love technology and gadgets, and I watch a lot of sci-fi. Space movies intrigue me a lot and mix that with Dragonball anime - you know how I am.

I love coffee and chocolates, I can be bribed over them.

I am open to chatting about anything, yes, anything (SFW/NSFW/mix), and if we hit it off, I don't mind it being a long-term connection. Oh! I just love the thrill of waiting for a message - the anticipation!!!

You can be anywhere in the world! Just have an open mind! If you like what I wrote drop a Reddit message with a few lines about yourself. Also, I am not looking for any affair or relationship. Just harmless fun!

Looking forward to connecting.",1,1737154262.0,LetsChat,0,1.0,False

Or have drinking be a part of it. My wife and I now take nature walks on Saturdays. We go to restaurants I always snubbed because they didn't serve alcohol. We'll drink tea and coffee in the evenings and play Yahtzee.... 

We love to cruise. We try to at least twice a year. And buying the unlimited srnk package was always a big part of that. Mimosas and bloody Mary's at 7am, and go until I stumble out of the casino at midnight. So for our upcoming cruise in March, we decided that since we weren't spending $1500 on booze, we'd upgrade to a suite.

Well, now I'm really having second thoughts on even going. I'm so worried I'm going to have such a hard time avoiding the temptation, I'm going to be a total buzzkill. I feel like I've done so well in changing my lifestyle, but I just don't know how this is gonna work for me. It might end up being a  non-issue. We have plans to just enjoy tons of time on our HUGE balcony, take advantage of room service for once, and I have a stack of books already set aside. 

Any ideas for helping keep my mind off alcohol? I already plan to attend meetings - they're offered daily on ship, although they're self-led. Thanks for any thoughts and insights. ",3,1737154072.0,alcoholicsanonymous,2,1.0,False

My husband and I live 3h drive away from his family.   
My son being the 1st grandchild, my in laws have been over the moon ever since we announced our pregnancy. I genuinely felt so relieved, that I would be getting help from them once the baby was there, and my initial anxiety over raising a child alone without family around (I'm an immigrant) faded. 

Fast forward to my LO being 3 months now and things are not as exciting anymore. They hardly visit, and when they do they don't interact with the baby besides the usual interaction that any stranger would have in the supermarket. They don't hold him because 'he's too heavy' and when he fusses they immediately hand him over to me.   
How is my baby suppose to bond with his grandparents if they don't even give him a chance?

I was so disappointed after they came over this weekend to stay with us, as my husband is travelling and I have been all alone with the baby.   
I thought I would catch up on some chores, at least get few minutes of  rest and/or eat dinner with both my hands but for the entire weekend they played with the baby for 2 minutes each and didn't even hold him. Matter of fact, I had to make lunch for them, arrange dinner and take out, and serve coffee and whatnot while they sat around and watched TV, admiring from afar.   
Even though they saw me struggling and juggling different things through the day, they tried to play it nice, but did not give my baby a slight chance to properly play with them.  

The least I expected was that they would either cook, or bring a meal over, knowing that my baby is very clingy so I could not make dinner.   
Heck, even some cookies or chocolate for the gesture but nothing. They brought the baby a cheap sweater and a soft toy.    
They also behaved like this when my LO was a few weeks old, where they were staying at a hotel and demanded my husband to pick them up everyday, drive them back and forth while we had a literal newborn at home. 

I just don't get it, was the excitement purely for the show? Are they just not good with newborns and should I hold on to the hope for the future when LO is a toddler and more 'fun' to have these moments with grandparents? I want him to have a good relationship with his family, but I am being so resentful to the point that I don't want to even seem them in my house ever again.   
I also don't want to offend my husband but I feel like I need to say something about this firmly. 

Am I overreacting?   
If grandparents don't have the patience then who am I suppose to count on? Only on people that I have to pay to babysit I guess?  
Thanks for the long read. ",3,1737154006.0,beyondthebump,7,0.72,False
