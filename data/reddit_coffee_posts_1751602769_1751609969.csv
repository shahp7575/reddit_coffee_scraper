However, deeply understand what triggers current situation and my anxiety:  
**Learning without thought brings naught;**  
**Thought without learning dangers wrought.**  
  
I don't know if there is anyone like me, being one who just keeps thinking in own manner,I keep obsessing over my future — career, life, everything — All of it turns out to be my anxiety and discomfort **but with ZERO real engineering experience**, I’m just mental masturbating. The more I think, the dumber I feel :)  
  
So, i wish to read more books and network with experienced engineers and people from all walks of life to coffee chat, to absorb, to learn from them. Well, at least now, it might be the best way to push me to do some real stuff, not **overthinking everything and stuck in own head.** So glad to chat with anyone and appreciate any advice, and I wanna get myself out of the endless loop of just thinking without learning. 

I'm a freshman in UIUC and major in system engineering and design, just another name for major General Engineering, and I wish to switch into Comp Eng, sounds like a best choice now cuz it involves both software and hardware sections :0

glad to chat with schoolfellow!

NO, IT’S YOUR KINGMAKER'S Novel__I dumped him right then and there. He immediately went and proposed to his ex.","On our three-year anniversary, Caden Wren sent me $1.43 cents via Venmo while transferring $143,000 to his ex-girlfriend Isolde Vance.

When I refused to accept it, he actually had the nerve to call me a gold digger:

""Look, I sent Isolde that money because I was worried her financial situation, not because I still have feelings for her.""

""You've got my mom helping you out—what more do you want? Have you ever gone without anything since we've been together? This was meant to be your final test. Pass it, and we'd get married. God, you've really disappointed me""

I dumped him right then and there. He immediately went and proposed to his ex.

Five years later, we bumped into each other at one of Manhattan's most exclusive hotels. His company was about to go public, and he had Isolde on his arm—stunning in designer everything, looking absolutely perfect.

There I was, covered in dirt, digging through a trash can, he frowned with complete disgust:

""Wow, Elowen Hale. You wouldn't even look at $1.43 cents back then, but now you could dig through ten dumpsters and still come up empty-handed.""

""Even if you've become a beggar, don't think showing up here looking pathetic is going to make me take you back. Not happening.""

I completely ignored him. My son Jasper had found some special seashells at the beach earlier, but his dad had carelessly thrown them in this trash bin. My little boy was having a complete meltdown, and I needed to find those shells fast.

In the hotel lobby, Caden appeared with Isolde on his arm, looking every inch the power couple.

His perfectly tailored suit showed off his athletic build, and he had that confident swagger that screamed successful businessman. People in the lobby quickly recognized him and flocked over with eager smiles.

""Caden! Didn't expect to see you at the Finance Summit! Taking your company public in just five years after the takeover—man, that's impressive for someone your age!""

""You're here chasing that big investor too, right?""

Caden gave a slight nod, and everyone got the hint. Pretty much everyone here was after the same secret heir Zion Lark.

Someone turned to Isolde with a flattering smile:

""This gorgeous lady must be Mrs. Wren! You two make such a perfect couple!""

Isolde immediately pressed closer to Caden, flashing a radiant smile:

""Oh, we're not married yet! We're totally doing it right after the IPO goes through. You guys better save the date!""

Caden's expression tightened slightly before he forced an awkward smile:

""Yeah, we’re both buried in work. We already know we're meant for each other—don't really need a piece of paper to prove anything.""

More congratulations followed.

I was honestly shocked—they still weren't married? After our breakup five years ago, he'd proposed to Isolde immediately. They were posting engagement photos all over social media within a week.

He was so obsessed with her back then—you'd think he would've locked that down by now. Plus, his mother had been dying for grandchildren since day one.

A hotel staff member suddenly appeared next to me, looking pissed.

""Ma'am, this is a five-star resort, not some homeless shelter.""

He looked me up and down with undisguised disgust.

""And digging through trash cans? Absolutely not. You need to leave. Now.""

I'd just gotten back from beachcombing with my son—covered in sand, salt water, hair a complete mess. I definitely didn't look like I belonged here.

I quickly explained:

""Look, I'm sorry, but something of mine got thrown away by mistake. I'll go back to my room as soon as I find it. I'll clean this up, I promise...""

The guy cut me off impatiently:

""Lady, there's no way in hell someone looking like you is staying here. Get out before I call security.""

His voice carried, and people started staring.

That's when Caden casually glanced back.

Our eyes met, and I watched his face go through about five different emotions: ""Elowen Hale?""

The staff member looked surprised: ""Mr. Wren, you know this... person?""

Caden's expression quickly returned to ice-cold:

""Some charity chase my mother used to sponsor. We're not close.""

He looked away dismissively, exactly like when he'd coldly told me to get out during our breakup.

Seeing this, the staff member actually started pushing me:

""Time to go! I've dealt with people like you before. Someone throws you a bone once, and you think you can milk it forever?""

I stepped aside to avoid his hands, getting annoyed:

""I already told you—I'll leave as soon as I find what I'm looking for. I'll pay for any damage.""

He actually laughed in my face:

""Pay? With what money?"" He pointed at the trash can.

""You see this? Italian designer, custom-made. Ten thousand bucks! You gonna cover that?""

""Stop talking out of your ass! Everything in this place costs more than you'll make in a year!""

He reached for me again.

""Knock it off.""

Caden, who'd been heading toward the elevator, suddenly turned back. He walked over, his face expressionless, eyes like ice.

""What are you even looking for? Just tell me how much you want. I'll Venmo you right now.""

""And quit this whole pathetic act to get my attention. It's embarrassing, and I'm not buying it.""

Isolde immediately tightened her grip on his arm, putting on her sweetest smile:

""Elowen, honey, we're getting married. I get that you're still hurt about the breakup, but this is just... sad. I hope you can maintain some dignity""

I smiled back genuinely:

""Congratulations, you two. Hope you'll be really happy together.""

I ignored them and crouched down to continue searching for Jasper's shells.

""Seriously, what's it gonna take for you to just... go away? Are you still bitter about that $143,000 I sent to Isolde?""

Caden pulled out his phone impatiently, fingers flying across the screen:

""Fine. Whatever. I'll send you the money right now. Take it and disappear. I never want to see you again.""

""I've always been in love with Isolde. Those two years with you? That was just me running from my real feelings for her.""

""This money's enough for you to get your life together. Find some guy who's actually on your level and stop obsessing over me.""

Suddenly, his fingers stopped moving.

""Wait, what the hell? Your account's frozen. You're a deadbeat?""

Chapter 2

It suddenly clicked.

He was trying to transfer money to that old card from when I was on charity.

After getting married, I'd been using my husband's black card exclusively. Of course that old account got frozen—totally normal, right?

Apparently in his mind, I'm still the same person I was back then. Used to be a gold digger and a charity case, now I've been upgraded to deadbeat.

""I don't need your money."" My voice was flat. I really couldn't be bothered to explain.

His tone got colder:

""You're literally digging through trash cans, but you won't accept help?""

I frowned, confused:

""We broke up five years ago. We're strangers now—why would I need your help?""

After a pause, I added:

""Seriously, don't send me money. I don't need it.""

If a certain someone found out some guy was transferring money to me, he’d interrogate me relentlessly, digging for answers. And if he dug up my history with Caden, he'd be jealous for months.

Caden looked stunned, then let out a mocking laugh:

""Elowen, I think you're confused. I'm offering you money out of pity. Don't worry—I have zero interest in you.""

He stared at my disheveled appearance for a long moment, his expression growing complicated:

""You've really became a beggar. Maybe the breakup messed you up more than I thought... I guess I do bear some responsibility for that.""

""You won't take the money because you want me to feel guilty forever?""

Isolde immediately stepped in to comfort him:

""Caden, honey, she's a med school graduate with two working hands. Finding a job to support herself shouldn't be that hard.""

""She's in this mess because she's lazy and has no ambition.""

""Actually, we could see it even back then. Sure, her family was poor, but she could've worked part-time to pay for school. Instead, she just took your mom's money like it was owed to her. Shows you what kind of person she is—poor and lazy...""

""Isolde!"" I snapped. ""I paid back every penny of that charity money with interest. Watch your mouth.""

Isolde flinched and tugged on Caden's sleeve:

""Forget it, Caden. She cares too much about appearances. Your kindness will just feel like an insult to her. Let's just leave her alone.""

""My business is none of your concern."" I turned back to the trash can coldly.

Suddenly, I spotted a bag of colorful shells.

I breathed a sigh of relief and reached for it, but Caden suddenly grabbed my wrist and yanked me up roughly.

""Elowen, You wouldn't even look at $1.43 cents back then, but now you could dig through ten dumpsters and still come up empty-handed.""

""Even if you've become a beggar, showing up here looking pathetic isn't going to make me take you back.""

I was speechless.

After all these years, he still thought I broke up with him over $1.43 cents?

That year, Isolde had left for grad school abroad without a word—a brutal breakup that nearly destroyed him. His mother asked me to look after him, and out of gratitude for her support, I stayed by his side through it all.

Eventually, we naturally ended up together.

But as soon as Isolde came back, he started getting cold. Wouldn't answer my calls, ignored my texts.

On our three-year anniversary, he sent me $1.43 cents—wasn't that basically telling me to leave?

The pathetic part was, I still couldn't let go.

Not until Isolde sent me that message did I finally give up. Didn't he remember?

I stared at his hand gripping my wrist and said calmly:

""Caden, I'm doing great now. I've never thought about coming back to you. You can relax.""

I tried to pull my hand away, but he wouldn't budge.

""Weren't you the one who said not to come crying back to you after we broke up? I've never forgotten that.""

He narrowed his eyes at me. To completely put his mind at ease, I added:

""I'm married now. My husband has a bit of a temper. If he saw us like this, it wouldn't be good for anyone.""

He immediately let go, his face full of shock:

""You dare get married without my permission?""

Chapter 3

He frowned deeply:

""Where the hell is your husband? What kind of man lets his wife fall so low like this?""

I didn't answer. He suddenly let out a mocking laugh:

""Nice try. Almost had me fooled. What, trying to make me jealous by claiming you're married? Even if you said you had kids, I wouldn't give a damn.""

He didn't need to spell it out.

I knew better than anyone that Isolde was the only one in his heart.

But he was the one who came to me first back then.

I'd asked him over and over if he was really over Isolde, and he swore up and down that he'd forgotten all about her. Only then did I agree to be with him.

Now somehow I'm the one who was supposedly scheming and clinging to him?

I shrugged, not caring anymore:

""Think whatever you want.""

Isolde dramatically took a step back:

""Caden, honey, it smells awful here. Let's go. She clearly doesn't appreciate our help anyway.""

But Caden's eyes stayed locked on me, showing no intention of leaving.

Isolde shot me a cold look:

""Such ridiculous pride. Tell you what—we're meeting with an investor today, and we could use someone to serve coffee and water. If you're willing, I can pay you fifty grand.""

""That should be enough for someone like you to live on for a whole year, right?""

Caden finally responded:

""Elowen, you're just too stubborn. You won't take money directly, but you should at least accept payment for work, right?""

I was so angry I almost laughed.

""Are you two seriously that bored? I don't have time for your little rich people charity games. Stay away from me.""

I'd specifically turned down several major surgeries to squeeze out these three days for Jasper's summer vacation.

And they wanted me to serve coffee? Absolutely ridiculous.

My repeated refusals made Caden's face darken, and even the usually composed Isolde couldn't help rolling her eyes.

The crowd around us started murmuring:

""Caden, this woman's broke and stubborn as hell. You really want her serving that VIP guest?""

""I'd just drop it. If she pisses off the wrong person, we'll all be screwed.""

The staff member panicked and quickly called security:

""Get her out of here! The investor pitch is about to start, and that guest in the penthouse suite could come down any minute.""

He glared at me through gritted teeth:

""Ma'am, today's guests are all Manhattan's elite! Especially that young heir from the Lark family in Boston—he even brought his wife and kid. This is the biggest event our hotel has ever hosted!""

""Usually, I might look the other way when you dig through trash, maybe even give you some cardboard to sell. But not today! You causing a scene will ruin the hotel's reputation with the elite from both cities!""

""That's not something a lowly staff member like me can handle... Please, I'm begging you, just leave.""

The security guards immediately moved forward to physically drag me away.

I struggled free: ""I can walk myself out!""

Seeing that I was finally leaving, everyone in the lobby let out a collective sigh of relief.

""Wait!""

Caden suddenly shouted.

His eyes were fixed on the shells in my hand, his fists clenched so tight at his sides that his knuckles had turned white.

""Elowen,"" his voice was hoarse, ""why don't you get it... I don't need these shells anymore.""",1,1751608936.0,BlackNovel,0,1.0,False

Just recently, I finally said yes to his proposal.

But the night before our wedding, I overheard something I was never supposed to hear.

""Sloane Mercer? She's as dull as drywall. If it weren't for the mission, I wouldn't even look at her.""

""Once I secure the wedding, the second it's done, I'm dumping her ass.""

I pretended I didn't hear a thing.

I played along—right up until the wedding.

Then I walked away without looking back.

Later, my friend told me that cold, composed Professor Vaughn lost it for the first time—right there in front of a whole room full of stunned guests.

\---

Everett always wore that calm, untouchable mask in public.

So when I saw him holding hands with another woman, smiling like a goddamn fairytale, I froze.

The wedding was just days away.

I'd just stepped out of the bridal boutique, still half-floating from trying on my gown.

Then I got in my car—and saw him.

My fiancé. Everett Vaughn.

The same Everett who'd told me he was too busy with work to meet today.

Now he was standing on a crowded downtown sidewalk…

Making out with some girl like the world didn't even exist.

It was like someone dumped a bucket of ice water over me.

Two hours ago, he held me and said I was the only woman he'd ever love.

Now he was kissing someone else like I never even existed.

I couldn't believe my eyes.

I don't know how long I sat there, staring like a ghost.

Eventually, my hand moved on its own—I called him.

A few feet away, Everett flinched at the ringtone.

His smile vanished, jaw tightening just a bit.

Still, he answered.

""Hey, babe,"" he said, voice soft as ever.

""Miss me already?""

It was the same charming voice I'd fallen for.

My heart twisted so hard I thought it might split open. My mind was blank.

""Everett… what are you doing right now?""

He chuckled, low and warm. Like everything was fine.

""Just wrapped up a lecture, sweetheart.""

""Was about to grab that cake you love. Be home soon, okay?""

He sounded so natural. Not a crack in his act.

Then—he reached over and ran his fingers through the other girl's hair.

So casually. So gently.

I watched them, numb, tears sliding down my cheeks before I could stop them.

I'd thought Everett was the answer to the broken pieces of my life.

I thought he was my safe place, my ending.

But this?

This was never love.

It was a goddamn lie.

He chased me for three years.

And under a rain of flowers and applause, I said yes.

I thought it was forever.

Turned out it was all just a setup.

It took me a long time to find my voice.

""Sure,"" I whispered. ""I'll be waiting.""

Chapter 2

Everett came back not long after.

His expression was as soft as always—those eyes practically dripping with affection when they landed on me.

He set the little cake box down on the table, then walked over and wrapped his arms around me, resting his chin gently on my shoulder like we were the only two people on Earth.

""God, I missed you,"" he whispered.

""I keep thinking—we're getting married in just two weeks, and I can't even handle how happy that makes me…""

I just stood there, numb. Empty.

I hadn't figured out how to even process the betrayal, let alone confront it.

I stepped out of his embrace.

""I'm tired. I think I'll lie down for a bit.""

He kissed me lightly on the cheek.

""Of course, baby. Go rest. I'm gonna shower real quick.""

Mind spinning, I walked toward the bedroom—only to realize I'd left my phone on the coffee table.

As I passed the bathroom, I heard his voice.

""System, where's her affection level at?""

""Congratulations, Host. Target's affection level has reached ninety-eight percent.""

Everett let out a laugh—low, giddy, like he was finally winning something.

""Finally! God, these last three years have been pure hell.""

""Sloane Mercer is such a damn bore.""

""If it wasn't for the mission, I wouldn't even look at her!""

""Soon as I marry her and the mission's done, I'm dumping her ass—no hesitation.""

Then that… whatever it was—the ""System""—spoke again.

""Host, are you saying there's not even a sliver of genuine feeling for her?""

Everett chuckled. Arrogant. Cruel.

""For her? Are you kidding?""

""I'd have to be out of my damn mind. She's dull as dry toast.""

""Give me a girl like Noelle any day.""

I stood outside the door, frozen.

Four words echoed in my head.

Dull as dry toast.

So that's what I'd been to him all along.

All those quiet doubts I'd buried for years finally clawed their way to the surface.

I grew up without parents. Bounced between foster homes. Always felt like a stray.

So when someone like Everett came after me, I didn't understand it.

A man like him? Smart. Charming. Accomplished.

Why would he ever want… me?

Now I knew.

It wasn't love. It was strategy.

Some sick, twisted ""mission.""

Chapter 3

I grabbed my phone and headed to the bedroom.

But instead of sleeping, I started torturing myself.

I pulled up Everett's Twitter.

He posted there all the time—every little moment we shared, every meal, every silly inside joke.

I liked every single post.

And I was his only follow.

At least… I thought I was.

There was someone else.

A second account.

Username: [u/orangesaretheonlyfruit](https://www.reddit.com/user/orangesaretheonlyfruit/)

My gut twisted.

Orange? Noelle?

Before I could stop myself, I tapped on her profile.

The latest tweet was from two hours ago.

""You showed up the second I called. So… does that mean you kinda like me?""

Attached was a photo.

Two hands. Intertwined.

I recognized one of them immediately.

Everett's.

If his feed was all about me, hers was all about him.

And I couldn't look away.

I scrolled and scrolled—self-destructing on purpose.

Then I saw the oldest post.

""Finally got a date with my dream guy. So happy.""

The image?

A hotel room door.

The timestamp?

Three years ago.

Three months after Everett and I started dating.

They'd been together since the beginning.

My stomach turned.

Nausea rolled in waves.

I doubled over, shaking. Eyes burning.

I remembered the early days with Everett.

How insecure I was.

Once, he showed up late to dinner—by five minutes.

I snapped. Lashed out.

He didn't argue. Didn't defend himself.

He just held me.

Later, I apologized.

He'd smiled, brushed my hair back so gently.

""Baby, you're only mad because you care. I love that about you. I'm not mad—not even a little.""

He kissed me, slow and tender.

""Sloane Mercer, you don't ever have to pretend around me. Be yourself—always.""

I cried in his arms that night, overwhelmed by the warmth.

And he just looked at me like I was his whole world.

Was that all fake too?

Because back then, it sure felt real.

I've changed from kpop lover to 'hater' in 1 day after actually having a conversation with these people. Ik it's not just kpop stans who are toxic but it's overwhelmingly exhausting with them.

Always knew they were toxic & hypocrites & it wasn't my 1st time having a disagreement with them. But this time was my final straw.

I was curious about what brand Identity would fit katseye since they seem all over the place music wise. I had no idea how to start so I asked chatgpt instead. The plan was good so I thought of sharing it with kpop stans to see what they think.

What do y'all think happened next? Some creative input and insights perhaps??? Not at all 🤣 they took out their pitchforks & started flaming me for using chatgpt. Got told to get a hobby, when they literally responded to my post & replies within 2 minutes of posting. Like brooo are you replying to me from a yacht in Monaco, you also got free time on your hands if you're strolling on reddit be fr 😑

I also hate ai most of the time because of deep fakes & stuff but kpop stans pointing fingers is the biggest hypocritical move I've seen. Pretty much all of our digital life from smartphones, streaming Netflix, scrolling social media depends on those same data centers, which already use a lot of electricity and water. Manufacturing electronics (phones, laptops, etc) also consume water and creates waste during production and disposal. Printing massive banners & renting billboards for their idols & mass buying physical albums create a lot of plastic, electricity and paper waste too. Spending hours streaming kpop videos and songs online contributes to the digital water and energy footprint (like with AI and phones). 🤣

But kpop stans will boycott & bully someone for drinking coffee & using chatgpt. Even Google uses it now like wth. If they cared so much they should become monks or nuns.

They won't call out their community but little old me asking chatgpt a question is a sin that would make Satan gasped in shock and applaud.

Like give me a break. On top of that they pick & choose what to call cultural appropriation or not, they defend racism with so much passion to not break their fantasy bubble. Every release is overanalyzed as if it's gonna get nominated for the grammys, it's exhausting. I don't even open comments anymore.

Let’s not forget the idols. You won't catch me defending them against racism anymore, most of these people are racists, ignorant and colorists themselves.

The only ones who made me stay was bts because their songs were really good. But I find it hard to respect them as much when they still rely and encourage parasocial relationships & toxic fans. I understand they had no power before but they're definitely so big now that even if they call out their fans and set clear boundaries, they'll still have millions of people backing them. Like y'all are so rich and powerful how much more do you need? They're doing livestreams of their nap time, showing private conversations/time with family, etc just to make the relationships deeper with armies.

Bts have never call out their fans for bullying women, celebs or even their own families. I'm surprised somebody didn't off themselves because of armies & i hope it never happens. I saw like 1 or 2 people crying live because of armies bullying them.  
I gave them the benefit of the doubt but they didn't say anything when James corden mentioned it on TV in front of them.

If they actually called out their fans and set boundaries clearly, instead of encouraging it. I would respect them and keep supporting.

And the overdramatic celebration for their comeback from military showed me just why i should step away from them. There wasn't a moment during that hiatus where bts members weren't active, if they took a long offline hiatus I would get the hype. But they were each very active during 'the hiatus' but armies comments were like ""Finally they're back home 🥹"", ""I missed them so much idk how we survived this hiatus 🥹"".

Even 1D or fifth harmony stans won't be that dramatic if they made a comeback. It's creepy how attached they are to the boys where a 2-3 yr hiatus where each member was active in turns provokes such an emotional response. It's even more weird that bts subtly encourage this continuously. Like just make your art and go you have already achieved so much in life, you don't need all that.

Jhope from bts taking his phone in the bathroom & livestreaming when showering (he didn't show his naked body he closed the door). Afterwards jungkook is sleeping live shirtless.. they keep calling their fans gfs, etc. These are grown men they know what they're doing.

Those boys are hardworking & humble but they're grown & powerful. They could tell their fans to cancel Beyonce and Bruno mars and they would do it, that's how powerful they are. They can't control millions of people but they have no excuse when they keep making the problem worse. For my own sanity I choose to step away and only occasionally listen to some songs I like. I don't wanna be there when they get hate for really dating. Nor do I will waste my time defending them against racists when they never put out an official apology for their own actions.

I really have no love for any kpop idols or fans whatsoever, barely 2 will still get my support.

I don't care if I get downvoted 😂 They get mad over everything at this point so who cares.

1lrb366,https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/1lrb366/i_work_alone_in_a_subway_control_room_beneath_nyc/,I Work Alone in a Subway Control Room Beneath NYC. Something Down Here Isn't Following the Schedule.,"I’ve worked in the subway control system for the MTA for nearly nine years now. Most of the job is exactly what you’d expect—staring at screens, logging signal changes, rerouting trains when there’s an issue. The control room I’m assigned to is one of the older ones, located several stories beneath the Lower East Side. No windows. Flickering fluorescents. The kind of place where time forgets you.

They moved me onto night shifts a few months back. Budget cuts. I didn’t mind. It’s quiet down here after midnight. The rumble of trains becomes rhythmic. You get into a flow. Monitor the boards. Make sure the tracks are clear. Listen to the radios. Wait for the dawn shift to relieve you.

But about two weeks ago, something started… slipping.

At first, it was small stuff. A red signal flickering to green for no reason—just for a second. A train ID blinking in on a track that should’ve been empty. Glitches, probably. Old software, ancient wiring. You'd be surprised how much of this system still runs on stuff from the '70s.

Then last Thursday, I saw something I can’t explain.

It was 3:17 AM. Most lines were closed for overnight cleaning, but Track 3 at Bowery Station was listed as active. That shouldn’t have been possible. I triple-checked. There were no trains scheduled through Bowery after 2:45.

Then I heard it—faint, but unmistakable: the low mechanical squeal of brakes, echoing through the room’s overhead intercom.

I thought maybe a maintenance train had gone off-script. That happens. But when I called up the feed for that platform, the camera wouldn’t load. Just black. Not static. Just… black, like the lens was covered.

I pinged the camera. No response.

Then, the radio chirped.

Not my main radio. Not the digital one we use now. This was the old analog unit, mounted in the corner, which hasn’t been in active use since I’ve been here.

It crackled for a few seconds, then a voice—no greeting, no call sign—just a whisper:

""Last stop. All passengers must exit.""

I stared at it, frozen.

That’s the announcement conductors give when a train terminates service.

The thing is, there hadn’t been a conductor scheduled anywhere near Bowery for 40 minutes. And I was alone in the room.

I logged it, like I’m supposed to. Technical issue. Radio cross-talk. MTA loves when you put it in those terms.

But the next night, it happened again.

3:14 AM. Same platform. Same non-existent train.

Only this time, the screen came on. And I saw it.

A train pulled into the station—an old R16 model, long decommissioned, the kind they phased out back in the '80s. It looked pristine. Like it had been polished. Even had the original TA logo instead of MTA.

But the car was empty. No operator. No passengers. It stopped with mechanical precision. Doors slid open. Stayed like that for thirty seconds.

Then the lights inside flickered. And the camera cut out.

A minute later, the analog radio crackled again:

""Step away from the doors.""

My hands were shaking. I didn’t log it that night.

The next day, I went digging through archives. I found an incident report from 1974: a train on the old EE line had gone missing during a late-night run. Six passengers, one operator, one conductor. Vanished between Canal and Bowery.

Declared a “catastrophic electrical failure” and quietly written off.

Guess what kind of train it was?

An R16.

Last night, I made a decision.

I brought coffee. Stayed alert. Pulled up the Bowery feed an hour early.

Sure enough, at 3:13 AM, the signal registered. Track 3: occupied.

The lights on the map flickered.

Then, the camera kicked in—and the train pulled in again. Exactly like before.

Except this time... one of the doors opened, and someone stepped off.

A man in a suit. Disheveled. Pale. Looked around, confused.

He wandered the platform like he’d just woken up from a dream. He walked to the edge, stared at the tunnel.

And then he looked directly into the camera.

Straight at me.

And smiled.

I pulled the radio. Called Central. Told them we had a trespasser. They brushed it off. Said Bowery was sealed. No one down there. No trains scheduled for another hour.

But I kept watching. The man walked to the wall. Placed his hand on a maintenance door. And vanished.

Like he stepped into the concrete.

It’s 2:51 AM now.

The system just pinged me.

Track 3. Bowery.

Inbound.

But this time, the map shows two signals active:

One labeled “TRAIN”.

One labeled “CONTROL”.

And the second one...

No warning, no do you mind? just “Can’t wait to catch up I’ll stay with you!” We were close as kids, but we’ve kind of drifted. She’s super spontaneous and kind of lives in the moment, and I’m not. I work full-time and was honestly looking forward to a quiet weekend.

I replied and told her I’d love to see her and could definitely meet up for coffee or something, but I wasn’t able to host. My apartment’s small, I didn’t have anything prepped, and it just wasn’t something I had bandwidth for. She left me on read for a full day, then sent back this super passive-aggressive message like, Didn’t realize I was such a burden. Guess I know where we stand now. Which really rubbed me the wrong way because what?

Anyway, it turned into a whole thing. Her mom (my aunt) ended up calling and basically told me I was being cold and selfish and that family should always make room. A couple other cousins chimed in too, saying it was just one night and I could’ve made it work. But I don’t know. I feel like I was clear and respectful, and I just don’t think being family gives you a free pass to invite yourself into someone’s home without asking. Still, now everything feels tense and weird.

1lrb10n,https://www.reddit.com/r/BreakUps/comments/1lrb10n/this_breakup_broke_me/,This breakup broke me.,"We met on FB dating in 2022. It was one of the first times in my adult life that I felt a fucking **spark**. It's fucking stupid and cliche, but I felt **alive**. She was so curiously interesting. Knew exactly how to make me fall for her. She was genuinely interested in getting to know how I took my coffee in the morning.

A week later, we had planned our first date. I drove down to Central California early. About three hours away. I can still remember vividly how when I pulled up in front of her Grandma's house, she was facing away and turned to look at me. That smile melted my fucking heart.

She was 25 at the time, and I 38. Bit of an age gap, but It never felt as such. She was quite brilliant. Sharp. Loved to read. Intelligent by all accounts. Our first date was one of the most memorable days of my life.

Fast forward a few weeks and we go to a concert in Berkely. My stepdaughter had come to visit at the time. Angsty 15 year old she was. We were seeing Fleet Foxes. It was at that concert that some pure magic happened. I fell in love with this girl. The way she was keeping an eye on my stepdaughter -- Like a hawk. I knew she was the one. We shared nachos and laughed and I could feel it. Beautiful and perfect beginnings. I want to marry this girl, I repeated to myself, as quietly as I could that day. 

  
Sept 2024.  
  
She had a seizure and a concussion. A bad one. I call 911 and they get her in ASAP. We head down with her son after the ambulance and we're there. They stabilize her. I panic. I'm scared. I'm a mess. They let us know that the road to recovery will be rough. 

She starts having a bit of memory problems, but the oddest thing is that I started noticing some patterns and behaviors. Forgetting to wipe her chrome history, random texts from random numbers, whispers, other voices, etc. 

I start cautiously monitoring and keeping an eye on her behavior. It gets progressively more bold. Shes starting to go on walks more, more random phone numbers showing up, the works. 

May 2025.

I now have a compiled list of her frequently visiting sugardaddy sites, etc etc. Overwhelming evidence, like multiple whatsapp accounts, contacts in her phone listed as family with everchanging numbers. I keep asking her to be honest, she refuses. Repeatedly.

Last week of may, she starts hysterically crying. Loudly. Cops get called, they talk to her, she's manic -- they can see it. They 51/50 her. She gets diagnosed with bipolar. Goes to stay with her aunt locally. More phone calls, sneaky behavior. CPS gets engaged by the cops from this incident. CPS sets a date to do a home check for June 4th. 

Comes back for a few days -- rinse and repeat. Leaves to her aunts again, and from there, directly books a flight to go back to her mothers in Oklahoma. Arrives there, and poof -- I'm ghosted. She left June 4th. 

Well, I checked my credit report shortly after she flew to her mothers. Two accounts were opened a year ago: Cellphone account and a credit card in my name. This aligns with her making efforts to keep cheating. She also refused to return the cellphone I pay for. 

I was forced to file a police report for the stolen items, and the fraudulent accounts. Also reported it to Identitytheft.gov.

The last time I spoke to her was June 8th. She wouldn't talk to me more than 5 minutes at a time. Kept saying her mom was going to get mad for talking to me, etc etc. 

Fathers day and my Birthday (June 22nd), I truly hoped I'd get a call. Nothing.  
None of this makes any fucking sense.

I can't make coffee without breaking down crying. I can't sleep in our bedroom for longer than two or three hours. I can't work more than half a day. I've been in therapy since before she left, and It's not helping. I'm trying to find positive ways to reframe things, but it's really tough. I've never been this close to just ending things. This is the hardest breakup I've ever had / experienced. Being blindsided like this really fucked me up. 

What are some things you guys can suggest that would help? Seriously, I need some suggestions. If it wasn't for my two precious babies, Syn and Loki, I wouldn't be writing this. They've seriously come and laid with me or pawed at me every time I sob uncontrollably.

My orthodontist said that this is just a draft of the starting point, and that we probably have to finely correct it with a few additional trays at the end of the treatment for small adjustments.

However, so far the gap in the bottom is almost completely closed (with exceptions to a small black triangle that we’ll need to close with IPR and maybe composite). But, the midline hasn’t changed at all, all though he says everything looks good according to the plan. When he said that in the clinic, he did actually not check the plan and made a comparison. More like he just threw it out in a «coffee talk». 

On the internet I see people using rubber bands in the front like this, which he did not give me:

Else than that the bite adjustment on the right side is going really well (the teeth/ligament has moved forward just according to the plan).

I (31f) live with my sister, her fiancé, her newborn baby, my 4-year-old autistic son, and my best friend, Margo (28f). Margo and I have been close since college. She’s also the godmother to my son.

When she told me she no longer felt comfortable living at home, said she felt treated like a child and couldn’t do what she wanted, I opened my door to her.

At the time, she was working 21 hours a week at a coffee shop for $15 an hour. My sister and I didn’t need another roommate. We made enough to cover our $2,600 rent and $600 in utilities between the two of us. But we wanted to help. We asked what she could afford, and she said $700 a month. We agreed, and I even covered her utilities for a while to help her get on her feet.

But from the moment she moved in, it felt like the household had to shrink around her.

Before Margo joined us, we used to host Friday night hangouts and I held regular D&D sessions. These were things she knew about and even attended before moving in. Once she settled in, she started complaining about noise even during the day. We compromised by setting quiet hours at 10 p.m. on weekdays and 11 p.m. on weekends. Eventually, we scaled back to just one or two events the entire year. Still, it wasn’t enough. She’d complain about my son making noise, even though he’s four, speech delayed, and just being a kid.

She also treated the hallway bathroom like it was her private one. Even though I explained from the beginning that it was shared, she removed all of my son’s bath items and got upset when anyone else used it.

In February, we re-signed our lease and rent increased to $2,798. We split rent based on who lived here at the time me, my sister, and Margo. Everyone’s share went up by $100, including hers. That brought her portion to $800, while my sister and I were still paying $1,300 each.

In March, I lost my job and started receiving $1,600 a month in unemployment. Meanwhile, Margo had landed a new job at a bakery back in October, working 40 hours a week at $17 an hour almost double what she was making before.(not that I’m watching her pockets lol but she does have more wiggle room then when she moved in and that was always the goal)

In June, my sister’s fiancé moved in to help with the baby and avoid bouncing between two homes. I reworked the budget and split the total expenses among the four adults. Everyone’s share came out to $858. That meant Margo’s would only increase by $58.

When I brought it up, she claimed she was told her rent would always stay at $700, which we never agreed to. She said it wasn’t “practical” for her to pay more. I reminded her of what she once told me: “If I got it, you got it.” But when I needed support, she responded, “Don’t bring friendship into this. I’m your roommate.”

That hit hard.

Because I’ve gone above and beyond for her, not just emotionally but physically too. I’ve driven 30 minutes to get her food when she was too tired. I helped wash her hair. I supported her through her breast reduction recovery. I showed up like a best friend should. But when I asked for help with my son her godson there was always an excuse. It was too much. Too inconvenient.

When I finally stood my ground during a meeting to discuss the rent and said she was being selfish, she yelled at me. I never raised my voice at her but She did and said I was wrong for calling her that but I still stand by what I said. Because when someone says, “In the real world, you’d be evicted,” regarding me having to pay more than what I could currently afford after everything we’ve done to support them, that’s not just harsh. It’s cold.

She later apologized through a long text and said maybe our lifestyles just aren’t compatible. She said she doesn’t have the option to move out right now but wants to eventually. She also stated she’s learning empathy which to me I’m like what you said was not empathetic like at all but ok . because saying you are learning is more than just saying it it’s actually putting it into the things you say and do .

So I stopped showing up as a best friend. I started treating her like what she asked to be: just a roommate. No more bending. No more sacrifices. No more caretaking. I’m tired honestly she keeps saying she has to reevaluate our friendship because I called her selfish and I told her if that’s what she needs to do then go ahead because that’s not going to change how I feel at this point . 

But now I’m wondering: Am I the asshole for doing that? For taking her words at face value?

Also If someone insists they’re just renting a room, do they really get to dictate how the rest of the house operates? Especially when there’s been no compromise on their part?

Because it feels like I gave her friendship, family, and flexibility. And all she really wanted was control.",4,1751607433.0,CharlotteDobreYouTube,1,1.0,False

* Start the day with warm lemon water
* Light stretching or a short walk
* Breakfast: Soaked chia seeds with dates, almonds, and one banana or plain oats with a little honey
* Black coffee or green tea, no sugar

**Afternoon**

* Lunch: One or two chapatis or a bowl of rice with dal, sabzi, and salad like cucumber or beetroot
* Sometimes I add paneer or an egg for protein
* I drink a lot of water throughout the day

**Evening (Pre-Gym)**

* A fruit like papaya or apple before workout
* Black coffee if I need a boost
* Snack: roasted makhana or a boiled egg
* Gym session in the evening around 6 or 7

**Dinner**

* Light dinner: mostly vegetables or soup
* Sometimes one chapati with dal if I feel hungrier
* No fried or oily food at night

1lrarkg,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1lrarkg,Master Google My Business Optimisation: Your Ultimate Guide to Dominating Local Search,"In today's digital age, your Google Business Profile is often the very first interaction customers have with your local business. But here's the crucial question: is it truly optimised to attract them, or is it merely sitting there, underperforming?

[Google My Business optimisation](https://designpoint.com.au/blog/how-do-i-choose-the-right-seo-company-near-me/) is the strategic process of enhancing your Google Business Profile (formerly known as GMB) to rank higher in local search results and magnetise more customers directly from Google Search and Maps. It has a direct, profound impact on your local visibility and your ability to attract local customers precisely when they're looking for what you offer.

This ultimate guide will walk you through every aspect of Google My Business optimisation, providing actionable, clear steps to boost your business profile on Google and genuinely dominate your local market.

# What Google My Business Optimisation Means



So, ""What is Google My Business Optimisation?"" At its core, it's the ongoing process of meticulously refining your Google Business Profile to significantly improve its performance in local search ranking and Google Maps ranking. Think of your Google Business Profile as a free, incredibly powerful tool for local business SEO.

It's crucial for any small business SEO strategy because of its direct impact:

* **Direct Visibility:** Your business appears prominently in the coveted local pack ranking (those top few businesses shown on a map) and within Maps results.
* **First Impressions:** It often serves as your digital storefront, providing essential information at a glance, making or breaking a customer's decision to engage.
* **Trust & Credibility:** A well-optimised profile, especially one boasting positive online reviews, builds immense consumer confidence before they even visit.
* **Direct Customer Connection:** It enables potential customers to call you, get directions, or visit your website with just a tap, all directly from the search results.

This powerful tool is your key to ensuring you're not just online, but genuinely found.

# How to Power Up Your Google Business Profile: A Step-by-Step Guide

Many ask, ""How do I SEO Google My Business?"" or ""How do I boost my business profile on Google?"" and ""How do I use Google optimisation?"" The answer lies in a series of actionable steps:

**1. Claim and Verify Your Profile:** This is the absolute foundational step for any GMB strategy. Until your profile is verified, you can't unlock its full potential. Google's verification process is straightforward but essential, usually involving a postcard by mail or sometimes phone/email. Don't skip this!

2. Complete and Accurate Business Information (NAP Consistency is Key!):

\* Name, Address, Phone (NAP): This is paramount. Ensure your business name, address, and phone number are identical across your Google Business Profile and every other online mention or local citation. Inconsistencies confuse Google and potential customers.

\* Categories: Choose your primary and secondary categories accurately for local search engine optimisation. Be specific! If you're a ""coffee shop,"" don't just put ""food."" Add ""cafe"" or ""espresso bar.""

\* Business Hours: Keep them meticulously updated, especially for holidays or special events. There's nothing more frustrating for a customer than showing up at a closed business.

\* Website & Appointment Links: Always direct customers to your website or an online booking system.

\* Description: Craft a compelling, keyword-rich overview of your business and your local SEO solutions. Think about what makes you unique and what problems you solve for local customers.

3. Leverage GMB Features for Maximum Impact: Google provides a suite of tools directly within your profile to enhance engagement.

\* Photos & Videos: High-quality images are non-negotiable. Showcase your storefront, your products, your team, and your services. Photos significantly boost engagement and give customers a real feel for your business.

\* Products and Services: Directly detail your offerings on your profile. This helps you rank for specific service searches and gives customers immediate clarity on what you provide.

\* Google Posts: Regularly share updates, offers, events, and news. These posts keep your profile fresh, engaging, and provide timely information to potential customers.

\* Q&A: Proactively answer common questions you anticipate customers might have. Also, monitor and respond to user-submitted questions. This shows you're attentive and helpful.

4. Master Online Reviews: Online reviews are critical. They impact your local search ranking, but more importantly, they build deep customer trust.

\* Develop strategies for encouraging genuine customer reviews (e.g., politely asking at the point of sale, sending follow-up emails after a service).

\* Always, always respond to all reviews, whether positive or negative. Respond professionally and promptly. This demonstrates that you actively listen and value customer input, turning potential negatives into positives.

**5. Utilise GMB Insights & Performance Monitoring:** Google provides free ""Insights"" within your profile. Learn how to access and interpret these crucial analytics (views, searches, actions like calls/directions). Using this data to refine your GMB strategy and continuously optimise your GMB profile is key to ongoing success.

# Advanced Strategies for Top Local Rankings



Beyond the basics, truly dominating local search with Google My Business optimisation requires a deeper dive:

* **Location-Specific Content:** For businesses with multiple locations, each Google Business Profile should be individually optimised with unique, hyper-local content.
* **Schema Markup (Local Business Schema):** This is a technical SEO signal. Briefly, it involves adding specific code to your website that helps search engines precisely understand your vital business data, giving your business a distinct advantage in local search.
* **Google Business Profile Website:** For those without a primary website, GMB offers a simple, free website builder. It's basic but better than nothing!
* **Reinforce with Local Citations:** Beyond GMB, ensure your business information is consistent across all other relevant online directories. This reinforces your legitimacy to search engines.
* **Integrate Local Keyword Research:** Make sure your GMB profile uses keywords that specifically attract local customers through 'near me' SEO. Think like your customer.
* **Consider a Google My Business Expert:** When things get complex or you simply lack the time, partnering with a professional or engaging local SEO services can provide significant leverage.

# The Investment: Is Google My Business Optimisation Free?

""What is the cost of Google My Business optimisation?"" and ""Is Google My Business free?"" are vital questions.

The truth is, creating and maintaining a *basic* Google Business Profile is indeed free. However, true, effective, and competitive Google My Business optimisation demands significant time, expertise, and potentially investment in paid tools or professional local SEO services. Just like building a house requires more than just free land, achieving a high-performing profile demands skill and consistent effort.

When considering professional services, factors influencing the Google Business Profile cost include:

* **Complexity of your business:** Single location vs. multiple locations.
* **Competitiveness of your industry:** How many other businesses are vying for the same local search terms?
* **Scope of services:** Are you just optimising GMB, or building a full local SEO strategy?
* **Ongoing management vs. one-time setup:** Do you need continuous support or just initial optimisation?

Ultimately, view this cost as an investment in local lead generation and driving foot traffic. A well-optimised profile offers a strong return on investment, leading to more customers and increased revenue.

# Your Path to Local Search Dominance

Diligent Google My Business optimisation is paramount for any local business looking to thrive in today's digital landscape. It's the bedrock of effective local business SEO, allowing you to boost your local visibility and truly connect with customers in your area.

Now, it's time to take control. Start by applying these strategies to your profile. For those seeking a faster, more comprehensive path to success, or for businesses with complex needs, consider partnering with a trusted local SEO expert or a professional local SEO agency for robust local SEO solutions. Don't let your business remain a hidden gem; let Google My Business optimisation make it shine brightest, ensuring you're always found by the customers who matter most.

Most days, I’m okay.I can finally sleep again.I order my coffee without wondering what you’d want too.You still cross my mind, but my heart doesn’t break the way it used to.

But as that date draws closer, the one that once meant everything, I find myself grieving again.Not just the love we lost, but the best friend I lost in you too..

I miss our endless walls of texts,our daily check-ins,the way we never ran out of things to share.I miss laughing with you, crying with you but most of all, I miss being with you.That feeling of being truly seen, truly wanted.

I know you’re probably out there now,talking to someone new,laughing and connecting the way we once did..So am I.But no one feels quite like you.No one speaks to my heart and mirrors me the way you did.

Even after everything..the distance, the silence, the unraveling,the fights and heartbreak I still carry us -Our memories. Our dreams.

I still see us wandering through a food market, grabbing too many samples.I still feel the laughter of our silly PB&J dances in the kitchen.I still picture the house we imagined — full of chaos and dogs, because “one pup per kid and one for me” felt just right.And I still feel the love loud and light, effortless and real.

We were magic, even if fleeting.And if there’s another life after this one,I know we’ll find each other again 
and this time, we’ll stay.

Until then..I’ll keep a small piece of youin the softest part of me.And no matter where life takes us,I’ll keep rooting for you.

Yours,Always.

I (30 M) feel like I have a severe caffeine addiction. My daily intake is probably close to 1000- 2000 MG, split up between multiple monster rehab drinks, zero sugar sweet tea, multiple pots of coffee, and the occasional soda.

 I've been this way for a really long time, and ever since my wife and I had our first child, plus working full time for software development company, and going to college full time, I've been even more hard pressed to drink the speed juice (my humor is only to break up tension, this is not something I'm trying to make light of). 

I'm on 15 MG adderal to help with the adhd diagnosis. And sertraline for the anxiety, and neither of those are recommended to take with caffeine, yet I consume more than I ever have.

I never feel rested, just various stages of groginess that never goes away. I sleep ""fine"" between the hours of 130 am and 5 am, which is when I go to sleep from studying and I wake up to go to work. 

I think I've gotten used to the levels of caffeine I drink, because I never feel any different. My heart rate stays around 72 to 78 bpm, no excessive sweating, and I'll drink it just to go fall right asleep afterwards.

I want to back off of it, some ""healthy"" like a cup or two of coffee in the morning and some tea here and there, but I've never had much success in stopping. I went 6 months with nothing and then fell off the wagon hard.

I'm writing this at 12:20 in the morning because I hate that I live like this and spend all this money on cans of stimulants. 

What do people recommend starting with? Are there safer alternatives that I could switch to? I've talked to my doctor, but I always get the generic ""stick to coffee tea and water and your be fine"" schpiel. 

Sorry for the long post. I just want to make sure I get to see my kids grow up before my heart explodes from this shit.",3,1751606675.0,decaf,1,1.0,False

So you think you want to be in a rockin’ band huh? You think you can handle the truth?

$150 to $350 per show is what you can expect to earn on tour with a B-Lister legacy rock band like Warrant, Sebastian Bach, Quiet Riot, Dangerous Toys, Stephen Pearcy, Enuff Z’Nuff, LA Guns, etc…

I’ve stepped in a few times with a number of these artists, and this has been the pay among my peers and myself.

What you receive as part of your contract depends highly on your reliability score and overall reputation within the music industry.

The truth is, the industry, especially for rock n roll, is dead. Labels don’t support or bother to help develop artists anymore… so there’s never any money to go around from cash advances.

I’m sitting here drinking coffee, scrolling the web, watching musicians complain and turn down amazing opportunities to work with great artists because “the pay ain’t enough…”

Hate to break it to ya, Kid… but you’re in for a world of surprises if you’re playing rock n roll for “the money”

Again, this is for Rock N Roll, B-Lister artists…

So if you’re just starting to tour, or you want to give touring a shot for the first time, and you get an offer to go out and perform for peanuts… take it. Cause truly that’s how you move up.

If it’s a small band with a bit of buzz, and they can offer you $40-$50 a night… consider yourself LUCKY in the rock industry.

If a band is staying in hotels, and offering you this kind of pay, they are likely one of few relevant artists who have a chance…

In other words, take the deal and GROW!

In conclusion: If you’re just starting out, quit moaning about money and learn to be comfortable with being uncomfortable…

Don’t expect to make big bucks with a C-Lister artist… let alone a band that’s just starting out.

Hard pill to swallow, I know.
But it’s a beautiful life once you’re in.

TLDR:
B-Lister Rock Acts pay hired-guns roughly $150-$350 per show, based on credibility. If you’re just starting out, and you’re offered any kind of pay for a small tour… take it and run!

Learn to be comfortable with being uncomfortable - this is the key to success.

1lrakay,https://i.redd.it/axocvit3ksaf1.jpeg,"[misc] “One Flesh, One End” Cocktail","I had a book-themed cocktail party with friends earlier this year and I made a Locked Tomb themed cocktail, “One Flesh, One End, Bitch!” I wanted a two part drink where each part was good on their own, but better together (debatable if I achieved that). I made Harrow a shot because out of the two I felt like that was accurate. The shot was 1:1 White Chocolate liqueur and White Rum. I added chocolate sauce to the bottom of the skull shaped shot glass and used a tooth pick to drag designs up the glass! I think dark chocolate sauce would look better, but I couldn’t find any at the store when I went. Gideon’s drink is 1:1 Vodka and Coffee liqueur because she is the BARI star! I also used a bit of raspberry syrup to add a little sweetness. In the glass is a rose-shaped piece of ice for the “flower” of the Ninth House. Above the glass is a black rapier pick piercing two black cherries because they were the closest, tastiest things I could find like a heart! I couldn’t find any picks that look like railings. Both drinks are incredibly strong because I felt like both of them are hard to swallow as people! Also if you ever make them, once you mix them together shoot it quickly! They can be drank slowly individually, but will curdle if you add them and let them sit for too long! Overall, it’s not perfect but I still am proud of how they turned out!

1lrah3i,https://www.reddit.com/r/polyamory/comments/1lrah3i/i_am_new_and_my_situation_is_unique_help/,I am new and my situation is unique… help..,"Hello! My husband and I (F) recently decided (after years of joking about it) to look for a partner (F) to join us as FWB. There were rules set in place for no solo play as he felt that was cheating. He met someone, they had coffee and hit it off. She knew right from the start where we stood and shared that she only wanted him. Not me. 

He later asked if that was ok and despite my feelings on it, I wanted to be a good wife and support him. We were getting married that weekend. They held off on all contact until after we were back from our destination wedding. 

It was supposed to stay strictly sexual but progressed into feelings between them. I did my best to keep up with their feelings and allow him to feel free to explore himself in this way. He does not want me to be polyamorous outside of him and her, if she will ever open up to this. She knows we are married with kids and that I am to stay monogamous.

My husband is always asking if I am ok, checks in with me before they meet or before he goes in to her place for their ‘time’. He never asks to see her if we have plans and always asks me what I would like to do if we have nothing going on, before he asks to see her. He’s very thoughtful and keeps me included as best as possible. 

I sometimes drown in grief at him sharing emotional connections with her, that I thought were special to me. I am letting go little by little that something’s aren’t as special or sacred to be kept as “ours only”, if that makes sense. 

I don’t want to date anyone else. I married my best friend and wanted to grow our relationship together. And in some ways this is that but not like we planned. He comes home so happy from her place and shares how they connected emotionally. He keeps events/actions to himself but shares the emotional connection and feeling seen and vulnerable. Am I selfish for wishing I solely gave that to him? 

He works on the east coast but I am a SAHM, working remote FT with our kids on the west coast. They’re spending the weekend off the fourth together out there and I agreed/supported this trip for them. I still do but I can’t help but feel so lonely. We have yet to find time to plan me and the kids to come visit him, so she is the first out there with him.

When they aren’t together, I talk with them both and encourage them to take time together but when it comes time, I’m unsure why I suddenly feel so sad. 

I wonder if I really want this or if I am making room for him to have this. I feel it’s fair to say I am doing this for him but he doesn’t appreciate that and wants me to see that because of this I have a happy husband, a new friend (his partner) and help. In the context that when I am busy with the house, kids and our animals, she is helping by giving attention to him while he is away from home. Am I wrong or not understanding?

She truly is such a lovely woman and I’ve spent quite a bit of time with her. The only hang up is I feel so sad after everything is said and done or while they spend the time together.

I made the mistake of bottling up the small uneasy feelings until I tried to express them and it came out as an explosion. Which threw them into fear that I was dishonest, lying and they can’t trust my feelings. That they now live in fear that I will pull the plug. I should have shared when the feelings came up but they didn’t feel big until there were enough of them that they added up. And then boom. Total meltdown. So, I created a safe word for when those small feelings come up. They both know it and know that it means I am feeling off, (sad, lonely, unsure, out of sorts, scared, etc) when something is happening or if fear gets ahold of me. Giving this safe word means I am not ok but I am not pulling the plug. That I just need someone to listen to me or just be there with me. To know that I will work through it, this is temporary. I’ve made it strict that I won’t ever use my safe word for any other situation except this. That way if it randomly comes out, there is no question as to what I am referencing. 

Any and all advice, knowledge, stories and/or suggestions to handle and manage my feelings better, is welcome. Any guidance is greatly appreciated and loved too. Looking into reading Ethical Slut and I have been listening to Multiamory podcast. It’s great info but most of what I have heard is just partners dating, I haven’t found much of married couples with only one poly spouse. By choice of the mono partner and restrictions by the poly partner. 

I am 5 months postpartum, working on my health, nursing our baby and managing work/home.

Thank you. 
From my heart to yours.  

Edit*** the situation is new/unique to me as I haven’t found much info on how to become better at compression or see the beauty in it over the fear of it.

1lraewp,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1lraewp,Mre Diet day 5,"White Chicken chunks
No hot sauce or coffee in this one which seems like a sin. It does come with mayo and cheese spread but that doesn’t make up for it. Luckily I saved the powdered hot sauce from yesterday. 

Marbled pound cake 
I wasn’t sure what the marbling would be, but it appears it was a chocolate and vanilla cake. Tastes good, it’s moist and rich. It wasn’t overly sweet, and I’m very happy that niether pound cake I’ve had was dry. I think I like the lemon poppyseed one better, but I’d gladly eat this one again. 

Baked snack crackers 
I was not expecting to see cheese its when I opened the package. They taste pretty much the same as the ones you would buy from the store, but more crushed. I was actually a little upset about these as I like to split up my snacks over several hours instead of eating everything at once, but I felt like I needed to pour these onto my chicken wrap that I’d be making later. It didn’t stop me from eating a few though. 

Skittles
The skittles were a little stale but overall nothing wrong with them. They’d be a nice treat on a hike. I always like when there is something I could tuck into my breast pocket and pull out later in the day like these, or that first strike bar from yesterday would be a good option. With the IMPs I always did that with the jam and peanut butter. 

Tortillas 
The tortillas had my hopes up, everyone wanted the tortillas from the Canadian IMPs. The hamburger bun or “pain hamburger” was horrible. They are much softer than the Canadian ones, and not nearly as dry. Flavour is almost the same but I like the US ones better. 

For the first time ever, my flameless ration heater has failed. It started heating up initially but  when I checked on it a couple minutes later it was cold.  Looks like I will be eating these at body temp. Not sure why it would fail, it was slightly overfilled with water but I’ve never had that be an issue.  

The chicken on its own sucked. It’s plain chicken. There was no juice inside which I had seen warnings about previously, but it wasn’t dry. It did look pink which was a little concerning but I ate it anyway. I poured the rest of the hot sauce powder inside and stirred it, before adding it to the tortillas with the mayo, cheese sauce, and crushed cheese its. The cheese its proved to be invaluable adding a nice crunch to the wrap. All together it was actually an enjoyable meal, and I was quite relieved that it tasted better than I had initially expected. Without the hot sauce it wouldn’t be as good, so ensure to have some on hand. If you make the wraps, the mayo is a little redundant with the cheese sauce. Next time I eat one of these I may just make a cheese wrap and then pour hot sauce, cheese its, and the mayo into the bag and consume it that way. 

I finished the meal with the lemon lime drink, which has been the best drink thus far. Previously one mre came with a sugar free lemon drink in a small packet and it was alright, but this was much better. It also blew the orange drink out of the water in my opinion.  Definitely a lighter meal compared to yesterday’s, but I wasn’t left hungry. I was more tired earlier in the night than normal, but I had a busier day as well. ",5,1751605520.0,MRE,0,1.0,False

That friend has told her she prefers Reese to shower with her rather than poop with her. Reese has said before that she talks to people while she's trying to poop.   
  
She says she's doing better today and she feels like Finn is in a good place. ""It helps to get all of the love and support from you guys,"" she says. ""... So many people have really come through."" A fan says she has a lot of lapis beads she wants to send Reese and asks if Reese has someone who can string them for her. Reese thanks her and says she'll find someone to do that.   
  
Reese says she had to take her dog Beau to the vet today because he has an ear infection. She claims she was silly-talking really loudly to Gertie in the waiting room and freaking other people out. Reese is complaining that the vet's office didn't put medicine in Beau's ear and just instructed her how to do it. ""I'm glad I paid for that,"" she says, adding that she was at the vet for a long time because the office had to work Beau in.   
  
Reese claims another woman kept side-eyeing her at the vet's office for an ungodly amount of time. She alleges that no one in her area knows who she is, but we know that a number of people from that area have been on Reddit talking about her occasionally for about a year.   
  
Reese says when she went to pay, her cup of coffee spilled because she was holding Gertie and Beau jerked his leash. I feel bad for the people who work at that vet's office. She's told many stories about trying to make them feel uncomfortable and now she's spilling coffee too.   
  
Reese says the vet tech seemed irritated because she asked Reese if she wanted to put Beau and Gertie in the car and then come back and pay. ""I don't because it's 104 degrees and I don't kill animals,"" Reese says she told her, adding that employees at the vet's office should have offered to hold Gertie and Beau while she paid.  
  
Reese claims the tech at H's recent doctor's appointment stared at her for a long time too and then told Reese she looked really familiar. Reese told her she didn't live in Tennessee. Reese laughs and says she does that all the time. Reese starts joking that she asked the tech if she watches porn or has a dad or grandfather Reese might have dated.   
  
Reese insists she never talks about YouTube outside of her office, but that's a lie. She's done streams at the Nashville org and at many different places in Murfreesboro and Wartrace. She streamed at a Nashville flea market. Reese has talked negatively about a bunch of other people in Tennessee, so a lot of people know who she is in that area.   
  
I've heard her tell multiple people in Tennessee that she has a YouTube channel called Relatable Reese and they tell her they'll check it out. She has said her salesperson from Sephora watches her channel. Maybe she thinks she's fooling her fans because often they will just go along with whatever she says.   
  
Reese makes fun of the woman who was side-eyeing her today, saying that she was wearing weird leggings that only came up to her knees. She then makes a snide comment about how most people in her area dress.   
  
She starts joking that Anna Wintour offered her a job at Vogue and that Reese told her she might need some time off this fall because she's potentially being sued in Vermont by a biscuit lady. She says she might do a movie called The Devil Wears Target.   
  
Reese starts looking at her phone and says she has some people who think they have been blocked. If they have, it's totally an accident, she says.   
  
She says she had a very long Zoom call today with some of her friends. She's asking what non-Scientologists do to celebrate the Fourth of July. ""We've never celebrated it,"" she says, throwing in that her birthday is July 8. But her July 4th stream from last year was named Freedom From Now On and she had fireworks and a flag in her thumbnail.  
  
She claims again that she never really did anything for holidays or her birthday in the past, but she has talked about family Christmas parties from years ago and she did a huge birthday stream for herself last year.   
  
Reese alleges she doesn't really know why the United States celebrates the Fourth of July. When she was married to Jeff, I'm certain he would have explained that to her. One of her first mods, Barb, used to send Reese daily facts about history to help her learn. I don't buy that Reese is nearly as clueless as she claims. She's really playing up Aaron's ""I grew up in a cult. What do I know?"" schtick.   
  
She asks if the Constitution has to do with the Fourth of July. Kathy Anne, one of Reese's main mods, says that the Declaration of Independence was signed on that day. ""Oh,"" Reese says. ""Different thing."" People in the chat are telling Reese that they celebrate with fireworks and barbecues. ""It represents freedom. Am I wrong?"" she asks. I'm convinced she's trolling people by acting this ignorant.   
  
She says she's always hated the Fourth of July because the fireworks scare the shit out of animals. She claims she didn't know the United States declared its independence from England and she says she doesn't have anybody to cook out with.   
  
She asks what freedom means to her viewers. She says her friends today suggested that she could celebrate her freedom from Scientology tomorrow. That's great, but the thumbnail for her video last year told people she was already doing that. Tommy was in Tennessee with her and H last year. A fan says her birthday is today. Reese says Tommy's birthday is today. ""Happy birthday to him too,"" she says.

Reese says she thinks a lot of people experience not being able to have a voice without fear or shame. That's true. She's known that very well for a long time if she's been actually listening to people in her chat.   
  
A superchatter says she came from a Communist country so she doesn't take freedom for granted. Reese says she doesn't really understand what Communist means. She says she knows it has to do with not entirely having freedom. Reese drives a lot of engagement every time she asks a question like this. She knows exactly what she's doing.   
  
She claims she doesn't know that the United States is a capitalist country and says that from what chatters are telling her, she thinks Scientology could be considered Communist. ""We're all equal except the upper levels,"" she says. A chatter tells Reese most Communist regimes are high-control groups so there are a lot of similarities to Scientology. Reese says she wants to make sure she doesn't sound stupid if she compares Scientology to Communism.   
  
Some people in the chat are arguing about politics and Reese disagrees when a chatter says the discussion is getting political. Reese says she doesn't mean to make the stream uncomfortable for people.   
  
She claims that she really believed Aaron when he told her a long time ago on a stream that Jesus wrote the Constitution. She insists she's not playing dumb.   
  
Reese says she voted once. ""I'm not much of a voter,"" she says. ""However, I did just register to vote where I live."" Reese has either voted more than she claims now or she was lying in October 2023. A chatter asked Reese back then if she votes in elections. “Absolutely, yeah. Definitely,” Reese said. “I started voting not at like 18. I started voting later than that.”

Then Reese asks if people vote outside of America ""because you guys don't have presidents, right? ... I knew there was a prime minister in England because I've seen Love Actually."" She gets a superchat from a longtime fan telling her that not knowing something doesn't make her stupid.   
  
A chatter tells Reese that the Sea Org is more like Communism, but public Scientology is not. ""I disagree with that,"" Reese says.   
  
Reese asks people to explain fascism to her. She asks if Gettysburg is in another country and says it sounds special. Reese's Bible superchatter gets confused and tells Reese it's in Virginia and then corrects herself to say it's in Pennsylvania. She spends $20 to send Reese a verse later in this stream even though she admits she has spent too much money on Reese lately.   
  
Reese says her dad shamed her for asking any questions that didn't have to do with Scientology. She claims he told her that school wasn't important and that she shouldn't be interested in the history of the world.   
  
People are trying to explain fascism to Reese, but she says it's over her head, adding that as long as she equates it to Knife Hoarder, it makes total sense. She jokes that a fascist is someone who makes fun of another person's dead husband and pet and also is friends with someone in Vermont who is a pile of shit.   
  
Reese says her haters offer less than nothing to society. She goes on another mini rant about Knife Hoarder and Marilyn and says it deserves airtime sometimes even though a lot of fans want her to move on.   
  
She brings Shamus on camera for the first time since before she brought Finn home. She says she loves Shamus and Moose, the two other stray cats she took in since moving to Tennessee, but adds that she would give them away if someone else said they loved them and wanted to take them. ""They really just exist here. They don't give a shit about me,"" she says.   
  
Reese wanted to give Moose away for a while but as soon as Tommy broke up with her, she refused to give Moose to him. She had said that Moose kept hurting her other cat, Kid. But as soon as Tommy told his viewers he was excited to bring Moose home with him, Reese said she wanted to keep Moose and claimed that Moose and Kid were magically getting along better.   
  
Months ago, Reese did a stream about an abandoned dog she claimed she'd like to foster. She said she's not crazy about Beau and he's not a good fit for her but she'll keep him until the day he dies because she chose to rescue him. To me, Beau seemed more connected to Jeff when they lived in Kansas City, and Jeff had offered to keep Beau but Reese made it sound like Jeff was threatening to take him away from her and that Beau would be miserable.   
  
Reese said months ago she's a ""little dog person"" and if somebody wanted Beau, she'd probably love to rehome him because he's so expensive and problematic. But she said she wouldn't do it because it would break Beau's heart. ""That dog is loyal to me to a fault,"" she said, adding that because she's been disconnected from, she refuses to just abandon an animal. But now she's saying she would rehome Moose and Shamus.   
  
When her audience was sending a lot of money, treats and food for Moose and Shamus, Reese never told her audience that they're basically barn cats. But as soon as Finn came into the picture, Reese started saying that Moose and Shamus spend almost all their time outside. ""Kid I'm in love with. I would never let anybody take Kid,"" she says, emphasizing that taking care of three cats is a lot.   
  
A chatter asks Reese how H's visit to his dad's place is going. Reese doesn't read the question out loud and just says ""It's going really well."" That's why it's so important for people to pay attention to Reese's chat. People who just listen to her streams or don't read the chat miss a lot of information that Reese confirms or denies with a quick yes or no.

Reese says Marilyn, Suzy and Knife Hoarder ""are like those bullies that got that girl to kill herself last week."" She mocks Marilyn and Suzy for saying that she hurt their friends' feelings. She tells Marilyn that her channel has millions of views and she's going to make Marilyn famous for buddying up to a Nazi and all of the bullying that she does.   
  
Reese says Marilyn reminds her very much of Zero Dark Tony ""except I think he was smarter. Probably a little wittier, funnier."" That's going to piss Marilyn off because ZDT was extra cruel to her and she prides herself on being funny. ""I don't know that anyone has ever laughed at anything she's ever said,"" Reese says. ""... Zero personality. You go watch that shit. It's hard to do."" Anyone who even mildly sticks up for Reese in Marilyn's chat is thrown out, Reese claims.   
  
Reese laughs and calls out a chatter who puts a hashtag in the chat that says Free Duncan. Duncan is Marilyn's husband.   
  
Reese lies by saying that Marilyn makes fun of her child. ""It's too much,"" she says. I have never heard Marilyn make fun of H. She and Suzy have been very protective of H. Marilyn did lie about never saying H's name, but that's a far cry from making fun of him. Reese and Marilyn are really playing dirty with each other.   
  
One of Reese's channel members says ""Nobody cares about her two 'best friends' Reese hurt. That was two years ago."" That's far from the truth. Keilah was still in Reese's chat for her birthday stream last year and she sent Reese money.   
  
""Tonight is brought to you by money and we appreciate it,"" Reese says as she ends her stream.

1lra6j5,https://www.reddit.com/r/shortstories/comments/1lra6j5/sf_emotion_pills/,[SF] Emotion Pills,"I started out taking happy. The package was blue with a yellow smiley-face. I read the label but there were no major listed side effects and they advertised it as non-chemically addictive. I took one happy pill and it did indeed make me happy, but immediately there was nothing for me to do. If I’m already satisfied what’s the point in gaming? If I’m already satisfied with my life, what’s the point in a laborious effort of self-improvement? I spent the time staring at a wall and I was happy.



I decided to try sad next. It came in a blue and purple bottle with a frowny-face. The label said it WAS NOT depression, that comes in a black and red bottle. Sadness made me feel sad. I wasn’t productive, but at least I was able to get myself to play some games. I felt lazy and terrible the whole time, like some looming dread was lurking over my shoulder in the way it used to when I procrastinated assignments, but at least I was doing something.



I decided to try PRODUCTIVITY next. The name was capitalized on the orange bottle, and I was, indeed, productive. I powered through my work but when I finished I felt empty and starving and tired all at once, and I immediately realized that my bosses would come to expect that level of output all the time if I did it ever again. I swore to myself that I would pretend the day’s work actually took the entire week and decided to quietly take off to spend time taking more emotion pills. Productivity could have been used for personal projects, but at the time I decided they weren’t worth pursuing as they didn’t maximize value, which is… one way of looking at things.



Next I decided to try… abstract art? The cover of the bottle was some kind of Jackson Pollock painting and the feeling was indescribable. It was like I was in a million places at once, as if the whole world finally fit together. I was human and in my living room and alive. I was free to do what I wanted and to achieve my goals and dreams should only I understand that the nature of life is bound up in what you spend it on. Everything I am and ever was is bound up in what I’ve already done and am doing. I am human and I am free, unrestrained, restrained only by my own habits and what is already easy.



By this point it was clear the pills were incredible, but I wanted to try taking a day off. I couldn’t. It wasn’t because the pills were chemically addictive, they were very clear about it on the packaging. It wasn’t even that I particularly craved the feelings of the pills, but by the time I finished my morning coffee I realized that my day was just empty. There was no strong emotion, there was nothing there at all. I thought forward to the rest of my day and realized that the act of not taking a pill was equivalent to taking the apathy pill.



I decided to take depression and immediately regretted it. The bottle was black and red and warned in very strong, bold letters that the product SHOULD NOT be taken if you are not happy by default. I should have listened to that. By the time the pill wore off my wrists were bleeding and my head hurt and my eyes and nose were chaffed from the crying and contemplation of how empty my life has always been. Of how empty it must necessarily be for these pills to be so interesting as to destroy what little semblance of normalcy I once had.



Obviously the next move was to take joy, which I did not wait for. I took the pill out of the cyan-pink bottle while still on depression. The outcome was apathy until the depression ended, presumably having taken me back to baseline. After this the joy mounted until I was positively beaming off the walls. Unfortunately, this did mean I destroyed my television by deciding I was so happy I didn’t need it and so in need of internal fulfillment I shouldn’t have it. Joy appears to have been a mistake, spiralling me deeper into the pills for entertainment.



Next I decided to try BLELLO. My face was melting, my brain exploding, my eyes falling out like soup. The floor dissolved and I became one with the ceiling. What is gravity to a creature of abstract thought?



FJDLsjfeilw;ajhf;flijesalfj was next. I feel as if I’ve been broken. It’s been days and I can’t forget. I can’t forget that feeling of sameness. Of oneness with myself above the world. As an entity made of abstract thought imposed on consciousness. A manifested order temporarily organized out of chaos in boundaries of flesh that would soon dissolve. In that moment I felt terror. I felt the terror in knowing that I am nothing at all. That everything I am is a thin layer of skin between rippling surging chaos beneath the fabric of the world that I meant nothing to at all and would return to without it ever having realized I was gone. Without ever having actually been gone.



I tried to quit, but for four days I’ve taken happy. It helps me forget.

She’s never been the type to chase the spotlight. Red carpets, curated stories, flashing cameras—none of that was ever her. She’s the girl behind the scenes: the one who brings him coffee after eighteen-hour days in the studio, the one who tucks love notes into his bags before he flies across the world, the one who stays silent when the tabloids pair him with someone else yet again. She’s known him longer than the world has—before the fame, the tours, the ego. And somewhere along the way, she fell in love with the boy he used to be when no one else was watching.

But somewhere along the way, she became invisible.

The story begins on her birthday—a regular Tuesday for him. She doesn’t expect much; she never has. Just a few hours, maybe a walk, maybe a movie on the couch like they used to do before his phone never stopped buzzing. She doesn’t say it outright. She never demands. She just smiles, quiet as ever, and suggests, *“Maybe when you’re done at the studio… we could just do something. Anything, really.”* But he brushes her off, distracted, already halfway out the door.

She doesn’t cry—not at first. She just sits in the quiet, one hand resting on her belly—a new secret, just starting to show. A life growing inside her. His child. And she wonders if he’ll even notice when she’s gone. Because she’s not angry—just tired. Tired of being a second thought in a world she never wanted to compete with. Tired of giving everything and getting almost nothing in return.

**What I’m Looking For:**  
I’m searching for someone to write the role of the celebrity in this emotional, slow-burn story about love, and neglect.. Your character could be a musician, actor, influencer—whatever feels right. The key is that he’s lost in his own world, too caught up in the demands of his fame to see how much he’s hurting the only person who’s never wanted anything from him but love.

Aita for refusing to speak to my brother, and creating a divide in my family?

This is gonna be a super long one so drink some coffee, get a snack and relax. This is a heavy story and I'm aware I'm not the A-hole but the family doesn’t like me so i want to know if i'm in the right from another perspective.

(excuse all of the typos or bad grammar, I'm tired and wrote this in about 20 minutes)

Background on my family

My mom, Taylor, had 6 kids 

Mark, 26 (male)

Jessie, 25 (female)

Elliot, 23 (male)

Blake, 18 (male)

Me, Maegan, 17 (female)

And Hailey, 11 (female)



I grew up with my mom having a new boyfriend every few moths and a new husband ever couple years. Everyone in my home gained some kind of health and mental health issues from a young age and most still haven't recovered from them.



I, maegan, 17 female, grew up as a quiet kid who didnt like to talk, even to my family. I practically raised my younger sister, hailey, since she was born and also raised my brother blake. I was more mature than him, even though he was older. We were treated as twins because we were so close in age and even looked similar. He was a typical brother, he played video games, football, and had a lot of friends from a bad friend group. However something that wasn't so typical was his anger issues. He really didn't know how to control himself when he was upset. When we got into arguments, which was very often, he would throw CDs at me from a movie shelf we had in the living room. Sometimes cutting me but mostly missing. One argument we had was simply over the fact that it was his turn to do dishes, i told him it was his turn and he refused to let me leave the kitchen. I pushed him to get around him and he punched me in the face. This was a common thing however when my mom heard about these fights, i always got in trouble because i was the “mature one” and i should've known how it would end and avoided it. This behavior continued for a while. I just stopped telling my mom when we had fights or he broke a rule because most times i was to blame anyways. I was very asthmatic when i was younger and once a day i had to be on the machine. I couldn't exert myself as much as my siblings but regardless my mom made me do wall sits and run laps as punishments. Regardless of how insufferable my brother was, my older siblings all had friends and jobs and therefore where never home and even when they were they were smoking weed or getting drunk, so I didn't hang out with them. I really only had blake. Even if he was an asshole. I didn't make friends at school because frankly I was mean. I was a smart but ugly kid who got bullied every day so I stopped taking compliments seriously and eventually became the nonchalant kid. I took care of my brother when he was bullied, I was kinda his therapist in a way, every time he had an issue I gave him a pep talk and helped him through it. When he had lice so bad everyone in the house had it, i treated him, not my mom, not my older siblings, me. He didn't even care for it but it was so bad he should've just shaved his head. Every night I would sit him down and comb through his hair even if we had a fight that day. I cooked dinner a lot, i made him food, i was his only real friend. But he wasn't mine, and a part of me knew that. I helped him get girlfriends, but they never lasted long because he was mean. I tried teaching him empathy, I just wanted a kind brother.. We started watching anime and stuff together, bonding stuff y'know. We would play hide n seek, i learned how to play video games to hang out with him, i even adjusted my vocabulary to seem cooler. Even though the fights never stopped. I used to sit on the bathroom toilet and just cry, sobbing about it  for hours with the door open so if anyone wanted to check on me they could, but they just looked at me and walked away. 



Anyways, now this is where the biggest issue occurred. You have to understand my mom hates when i bring up issues he has, she hates problems and any time i mention one she makes it known i am the issue. One time, my older sister jessie, made a funny trump joke when he was running for office for the first time.. And my mom kicked her out. She's very conservative and phobic of everything other than herself (straight, cis, white woman). I also find it important to mention when I was younger I had severe sleep paralysis, so when I saw things in the middle of the night or felt anything touch me I simply couldn't move. I was always frozen with fear. One night, i was sleeping in the living room and i was about 9, i had a small blanket covering my small body, and i woke up to the feeling of my blanket being moved. (this wasn't too irregular but i knew something was different) then seconds later i felt the space beside me on the couch settle, as if someone sat down. Then i felt a hand on my a\*s. I really didn't know how to react, i just laid there, it only lasted maybe 20 minutes but i was frozen. It was just someone's hand on my a\*s but i didn't react, i just laid there.. And once the person left, i fixed my blanket and silently cried. At the time i didnt even know why i was crying, nothing had happened.. I didn't tell anyone because it felt too small to tell my mom. She would probably have told me to wear more clothes to sleep or something. So i didnt…



I got my period not long after and i also felt that was too small to tell her, so i simply didnt. There were pads in the bathroom and I wasn't stupid, so I used one and went on with my day. Slowly my life became too small to tell my mom.. And my siblings were too busy to tell them. At least once a week i would feel someone in my room, touching me… it started on my a\*s and every once in a while, it got worse, it was my breasts, or a full handful..  I was always caught off guard so i had no idea how to react. I always just froze, sitting silently, not letting this person know i was awake.. But one night.. When it was over, i peeked to see who it was.. It wasn't hard to tell.. Blake was quite large, he was stubby but held a lot of mass.. I knew it was him.. Slowly I noticed his footsteps and recognized him throughout the house. We shared a room for a few years.. But i never told my mom.. She wouldn't care… Then when Hailey started getting older, we all hung out.. We bonded, she was my only happiness in the house.. But she was also my moms, so a part of me didn't like her.. But I knew it wasn't her fault. Anyways.. As time went on I started getting night terrors and i didnt tell my mom about those either, we all thought the house was haunted anyways so it wouldn't change much. Anyways a few years go by and i gain  bit more attitude.. I have bad memory and im bad about being nice in my house because i feel that ill be let down. I saw blake hanging around hailey a lot and i thought it was whatever because it was simple things like sword fights or playing video games.. Then once i knew he was using the bathroom and i couldn't find hailey. It was only us home and my older sister, jessie was in her room.. I panicked and knocked on the bathroom door. He answered saying he was using the bathroom.. I waited.. He came out and closed the door with the light off. I made a joke to him and he walked away. I walked just far enough away for myself to not be seen through the bathroom door and low and behold, hailey walked out of the bathroom. At the time she was only 7. My entire heart sank and I ran to her, calmly and asked her about it. She shrugged me off and got mad at me for mentioning it. Jessie walked to the kitchen after this and I told her immediately. I knew how this kinda thing went down and i didnt want it to happen to my little sister. Jessie confronted blake, asking why they were in there together, while I was talking to Hailey, drawing pictures and trying to figure out what happened.. After about an hour of talking hailey says he made her look at his “pee pee” my heart sank. I immediately told jessie again but she shrugged me off and said he denied it and that hailey must be lying because he isn't the kind of person to do that. I was furious. I didn't know how to handle the situation. I was only like 14 and I was the only person who believed her. I waited to collect more evidence. Meanwhile he was still touching me while I slept. I felt wrong.. I felt like they wouldn't believe me even if I told them.. Because we openly didn't get along so it wouldn't be too wrong for me to say something that would make people hate him, or so that's what my mom thinks. Meanwhile, i was helping him through his suicidal thoughts.. I didn't hate him even though he did so many bad things. I mildly disliked him.. That sucks to say but he's the only person who listened to me. I knew his phone password and would sometimes prank him by texting his friends stupid messages, and one day, stupid me got curious and I looked at his google search history.. He didn't know how to delete it so I thought it would be interesting. That's when I found child hentai porn on his phone. I immediately took it to Jessie and my mom and they simply confronted him and called him gross but he was “just a teen” he was 15 jerking off to literal children. Wtf. then a few weeks later, i saw him sitting under a sheet with hailey… i was immediately alarmed and told hailey to come with me because i wanted to “show her something” when in reality i just had a bad feeling. She kept saying no.. and then started getting mean.. That's when I tried to simply pull the sheet off of them and blake got defensive and got mad at me, holding the sheet there as if it were their only clothes.. Then it hit me. I ran to my moms room and got her and ran back but my mom didn't care.. When I got back I saw Hailey standing with the sheet still over her as if she were putting her underwear back on.. I was panicking and nobody was listening, I pulled her aside and questioned her again but she always just got angry. I took her to jessie and jessie dismissed me again. So I slowly gave up, I never saw anything like that happen again for a while. Then one day I was doing a zoom call (during covid) and I heard a loud scream. My older sister Jessie started yelling. I ended the call and immediately ran to the room where the screams were coming from. Jessie was screaming at blake and punching him. He was standing without a shirt but with boxers on. Hailey was sitting inside the room, naked. My entire heart sank. I was confused and scared. Jessie yelled at me to get hailey and check on her and make sure she didn't have any bruising between her legs. I was crying while doing so. Once I did, she was okay. I got her dressed and then picked her up and carried her to our backhouse. At the time my two oldest brothers, Mark and Elliot, were over with Mark's cousin, jack. I ran inside, crying, and they rushed to me and I told them that blake was found trying to R-word hailey. They all ran out and told me to stay there. They jumped him in the alleyway behind my house and when my mom got back from work around the same time she sat him down and found a whip in her closet and hit him with it over and over for a while. There's a lot wrong with this family but this kinda thing has happened with my moms brother when he was younger so she thought it was just a mental illness. Afterwards. I was told to go back to the main house. Where me and hailey would sleep yet again. With him sleeping in the living room. As if nothing had happened. I didn't sleep that night. My mom says that night traumatized her so we don't talk about it. Mark's cousin, Jack, left a few days after that and someone had called CPS. they simply questioned us, we all lied to avoid issues (our mother) and then we went on with our lives. Nothing had changed. Not a single thing. And we were bullied by each other if we acted any kinda way about the topic. I didn't care. I shared my anger freely. But at the same time, he was my only friend. I hated my life and was severely suicidal. I even wrote letters to my family. Then school started and I met a girl that made me feel happy to be alive. (I'm still friends with her to this day and she's my best friend in the entire world) she helped me through all of it and helped me make something with my life. But I was expected to live alongside blake without issues. He never stopped touching me however it did become less frequent. Then i thought it had stopped with hailey. But then a couple years later, she had told me that he touched her in the night and i raged. I told jessie and we lightly spoke with Hailey to see if she would say anything else about it and she did. Then Jessie took Blake to my moms room and they all confronted him. They got into a big argument and they said Hailey was lying and just bringing up past stuff. Then I started crying and texting my best friend. Asking for advice, she said i should call the cops.. But i didn't think it was that bad, especially without proof of anything. Then i went to my room and started crying, trying to figure out what to do. Jessie came into my room and asked me what was wrong and i spilled. I told her everything, I told her that he touched me too, that its been for years and i didnt think i could tell anyone and that i needed her on my side that me and hailey need her with us and she came through. My mom walked in and asked us what was wrong and jessie got mad and told her too. My mom got pissed. She walked back into her room and yelled at blake, questioning him and he denied it all. Then jessie screamed at him to get out of the house and then my mom got mad at her and kicked her out too for kicking him out. Then my mom screamed at me and said i was lying about all of it for attention. She said that the only time anyones ever touched me is when she whoops me. I then realized i have nobody on my side other than my best friend. My mom left, screaming and saying shes never coming back.. I didn't know what to do. This felt real, not like all those times where she just needs a nice car drive to breathe.. It felt real. She wasn't coming back. I looked at my phone, it was on 3 percent.. I texted my best friend and asked her if she would call the cops for me. She did so immediately. I walked outside with hailey and i waited. As soon as the cops arrived i couldn't stop crying. I was so relieved. I told them i had a pedophile in the house and they had been touching us and we needed help and he asked for clarification a few times and i repeated myself however i was sobbing while i spoke so it was hard. But i tried my best. Then the cop asked if i knew what that word meant and that i was using it wrong.. I was confused and said i was using it right. A 17 year old boy who is trying to sleep like an 8 year old… erm. I think thats pedo behavior.. But the cop didn't think so. I explained that there was a huge fight and i didnt think my mom was coming back and we needed help but he shrugged me off and then my mom showed up. I knew it was over… she was gonna get her way again. He sighed and then said he wanted to talk to her for a minute. Then they started laughing and I knew he had already forgotten everything I had said. I cried in defeat. Even when i do the right thing, it wasn't worth it. It was embarrassing, laughable that I tried to get help. Then another cop came by, he looked maybe 25. He talked to me, I explained it to him and he asked me one thing. One thing only.. “Do you have a roof over your head and food in your fridge?” I was baffled. What do you say to that… I gave up. I stormed inside and they said I cried too much for it to be real.. I was upset to say the least. Then my mom came back inside, on the phone with my brother elliot, screaming that i was lying about everything and both of them saying im a horrible person and i just couldn't hold it together… that night i was mad but jessie came back and they fought and then settled down. I slept with hailey that night. And Blake moved in with my brother mark. They all visit all the time but over time my mom forgot about my “lie” . She seriously believed it was a lie and forgot about it. I still openly don't like him but hailey has forgotten about the entire incident. Everyone else is recovering and saying hes a better person but realistically i knew him the best. I knew all of his thoughts when he was at his lowest and those don't just recover. Those thoughts were sewn into his brain. He cant simply fix that kinda thing by “being better” he is a horrible person who thrives off of the pain of others.. And there's no fixing that.



My family is upset with me because that was about 2 years ago now, and i still hate him.

Idk what to do from here but i should probably get therapy when i can afford it..



I have a lot more stories so stay tuned I guess.

also if anyone has any advice on how to get better mentally from this kinda thing that would be cool too",0,1751604389.0,AITAH,5,0.5,False

Here’s a little about me to help you decide if you'd like to reach out!

I consider myself to be outgoing, sincere, passionate, kind-hearted, and at times a bit overwhelming. I strive to see the good in people, but I also trust my instincts. While I have plenty of friends, many of them are married with children, which makes it challenging to find time to hang out. I completely understand their commitments, but it feels like we’re on different paths in life right now. So, I’m not really looking to connect with married friends at the moment.

I'm an avid reader and a huge fan of audiobooks. Since I travel frequently, listening to books is a convenient way for me to enjoy stories. Plus, I love the experience of being read to! I often listen at double speed, so if you want to chat about literature, I’d be thrilled. Some of the most recents books I loved were 
Music holds a special place in my heart. At the moment, I'm curating a dinner playlist, and it's turning out fantastic; it features artists like Kacey Musgraves and Ella Fitzgerald. In fact, I have a playlist that spans 20 hours and includes a diverse range of genres.

Theater, ballet, and opera . I adore dressing up to witness exceptionally talented performances—it’s always a magical experience.


When it comes to food, I enjoy dining out and experiencing new restaurants. While I can cook and do enjoy it, I’m currently in a phase where exploring brunch and dinner spots with friends is my preference. I’m a big fan of iced coffee and enjoy sharing too much champagne with good company! 

I've traveled extensively, from Bali to Paris to Kenya, and I've explored all 50 states. At this point, it feels like I've ticked off most of the destinations on my wishlist. However, if you mention any city, I can definitely provide you with some fantastic restaurant suggestions!

I was recently  engaged, but I decided to end that relationship. While I feel at peace with my choice, I'm seeking genuine friends to help navigate the craziness of the world right now. Things in America have become truly overwhelming, and it is  both heartbreaking and frightening.


I'm looking for someone aged between 26 and 50, located in the United States, who shares my preference for voting blue. Connecting with like-minded individuals is essential for me.

I turned my pile earlier and it is getting hot, idk how hot as I don’t have a thermometer, enough to feel the heat through the cheap fabric gardening gloves with rubber grips. My pile has currently been made of various dead weed stalks plus dirt, a small shredder bin full of newspapers and then a ton of dried corn husks for the browns and then a bunch of veggie scraps including potato peels, lettuce scrap, onion peels and various other scraps for the greens plus coffee grounds. The pile is probably about 3 x 3 as a rough guess. I have two more questions/concerns after turning the pile. 1) it almost looks as if the corn husks are turning to ash, they are black but covered in what appears to be a powdery white layer much like you see on charcoal. Is this something that can normally happen with hot compost? 2) there are a ton of roaches in my pile, I’m fine with them if they stay in the pile as they help break down stuff I’m aware but if they are thriving there does that mean my pile isn’t very hot?

I swear that in the moment I return the glances, the teasing, the smiles, and sometimes even get flustered when they talk to me, but then I’ll see these same guys in passing and they don’t even look in my direction, even if I look at them and smile.

They seem to have zero interest in talking to me beyond the times where we’ve *had* to talk (working directly together, sitting next to each other in a class, paired up in some sort of group setting).

I can’t tell if I’m giving off the wrong vibes by not pretty much throwing myself at a guy as soon as he smiles at me, or if I’m reading too much into nice, outgoing dudes being friendly with me and scaring them off because I interpret their kindness as interest and they can tell hahaha",1,1751604044.0,dating_advice,4,1.0,False

Sharing an early WIP (work-in-progress) of a coworking space booking platform I’m building for a real client.



🧠 Idea:

Let users explore premium workspaces, check amenities, and book by the hour or on a daily basis — fast, responsive, and mobile-friendly.



⚒️ What’s Done (3 Days Frontend Sprint):

\- Location-based workspace search

\- Time slot selection UI

\- Reviews, pricing, and amenities section

\- Fully responsive design (HTML, CSS, JS)



🧩 Backend Status:

Currently working on user login, booking logic, and database setup. This is still frontend-only, but will be fully functional soon.



📌 Would love feedback:

\- What do you think of the UX/UI?

\- Any features you'd add before launch?

\- Does this feel client-ready?

1lr9ujt,https://www.reddit.com/r/nicenewcontact/comments/1lr9ujt/excited_about_our_unexpected_movie_chat_at_the/,Excited about our unexpected movie chat at the coffee shop ☕️,"So I was at this cozy coffee shop, waiting for my usual latte when I overheard a guy at the next table talking about the latest Marvel movie. I couldn't help but jump in with, 'Did you just say that Captain Marvel is overpowered?' He laughed and said, 'Only because she could totally take down Thanos alone.' 

We ended up chatting about our favorite Marvel heroes for ages, and it was adorable how he pretended to be Hulk with his 'HULK SMASH' imitations that made the barista giggle. 

At one point, trying to be all dramatic, he leaned closer and said, 'If you were a superhero, I bet you'd have the power to make the best latte.' 

I shot back, 'Well, as long as you promise you're not secretly Loki in disguise, I won't mind sharing a cup with you again.' 😏

And just like that, I walked out with not only a double shot of caffeine but also a big smile—sometimes a little nerdy talk can turn a coffee stop into a meet-cute!",7,1751603533.0,nicenewcontact,1,1.0,False

Do you know of any daytime dance events in Tokyo eg, like ""Beats and beans"" in Singapore, or similar coffee shop raves or day time parties in Tokyo like ""Piknik electronik"" in Montreal? I used to go to an event called ""Tokyo Speakeasy"" years ago which was exactly this but it seems they stopped during Covid and don't exist anymore.  

I'm not quite the clubber I used to be but I'd still like to dance my ass off in the daytime sometime!  

  
Thanks you for any info!

1lr9pq7,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1lr9pq7,Almost finished couch build.,"Several days ago, I asked about finish for this project. It's made of douglas fir. We didn't want anything fancy. My wife actually wanted it rough-looking. It just needs to work, be comfortable, and be relatively German Shepherd proof. I'm a hobbyist, a DIYer of many things, not a pro. We haven't selected a finish for it yet, though I'm pretty certain we're going to use shellac. It still needs finish sanding, some holes filled, leveling feet, and a few other odds and ends before we can finish it. Next up, we're building a coffee table to go with it.",16,1751603079.0,woodworking,5,0.87,False

any length, rating, ships, or characters are welcome! my only hard no is pwp—smut is fine as long as it’s not the focus. and i’m not typically a fan of overly sweet fluff or “modern aus” like coffee shop but i’ll give it a chance if you think it’s worth trying.

that said, if you want some more info to work off of, here are some things i’m *definitely* interested in:
- ships: >!**anaxaglaea**, DHIL/yingxing!<
- characters: >!**sunday**, cipher, jiaoqiu, the HCQ, yanqing!<
- tropes: >!political intrigue, transmigration/isekai, identity porn, for want of a nail!<

I am bisexual and cisgender. I was diagnosed with PDDNOS in elementary school and am the ""high book smarts, low street smarts"" type. I have never had sex or even been to first base with anyone. I have been set up with a few coffee dates here and there that went nowhere and I didn't care for the experience. Same with dating sites, everything about them is so dispiriting. I would never approach anyone IRL. 

Virginity and being single never bothered me too much (I have no hateful ""incel"" leanings) until a few years ago when it dawned on me I always thought I would have this figured out by now. So I want to start but am basically afraid to. 

I am telling myself anything to avoid going through with it. You'll get hurt, you'll do something weird, you're too fat, you have no life. Relationships are a rats' nest of unwritten rules that your autistic ass cannot handle. No one wants a thirtysomething male virgin. 

I am starting to recognize that this is all bullshit. Part of me still knows companionship is attainable. 

But I cannot see any path forward.

Does anyone have advice for me? ",3,1751602922.0,autism,5,0.81,False
