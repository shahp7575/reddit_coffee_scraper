To clarify, he's very good at publishing them, and employs a lot of people who are also very good at doing that, but this is different to actually making them

This would explain the glacial pace of releases. Since Fallout 3, there's been like 3 games. Fallout 4, Fallout 76, and Starfield. Skyrim remasters and re-releases are as documented as they are ridiculed. Starfield was hyped as a new IP, but objectively, what's to stop a company working on 2 games at once? It's not like Capcom, Squenix, Ubisoft, CDPR, or Rockstar have ever done that. 2 games *at the same time*? What are you, mad? The only way this can be explained is because it's just one man, Todd, in a room, with a window overlooking a field and a farm. You think Microsoft money will help Todd and Zenimax? Of course not, why hire people when they cost money? Just make a damn game by yourself, it's much cheaper.

I've played like 1300 hours of FO4 and watched playthroughs of 76 and Skyrim. What are the enemies? Crabs, people, bears, bugs, and canines. Oh aye, there's that big bat as well. But where's the rodents, the fish, the birds, the megafauna? They don't exist because the Creation Engine doesn't handle aerial or subnautical combat well, and Todd can't figure out how to make it do that. Vertibirds are reskinned dragons, CEs aerial movement is ""walking, but the legs are invisible"", and their attacks are entirely projectile-based. You'd think that an airborne or subnautical enemy might want to physically attack you - nope, gotta get my (invisible) feet on the ground first.

TES VI was announced in 2018 but what was that announcement, really? Cloudy mountains and a title. That’s not a studio pipeline, that’s one guy saying “I’ll get to it after lunch” for eight years. There's been literally zero news since then, no gameplay, no story, no VAs, nothing. It's because Todd wanted to say ""yes, the next one is coming, promise"" but wanted to make Starfield first. He did but couldn't, or forgot how to, make a game beyond loading screen, walk 20m, shoot a dude, collect a thing, loading screen.

It also explains Bethesda bugs. Not “haha quirky studio culture” bugs, but actual bugs. Physics objects launching into the stratosphere. NPCs choosing to live inside walls. Quest markers pointing to a location that exists only conceptually. The PC walking into a car and dying. These aren’t QA oversights, these are the kind of mistakes you make when you’re tired, under-caffeinated, and forgot what you were fixing 14 hours ago.

People say “but Bethesda has hundreds of employees”. Have you seen them? No, we’ve seen Todd. Repeatedly. Who else works at BGS? Me? Nope. You? Probably not.

My theory is that everyone else left years ago and Todd simply didn’t update the website. The games still ship because Todd is adequately talented, but also deeply overworked, which is why every release feels like a miracle held together with duct tape and vibes.

I'm a 19-year-old girl and a complete introvert. Large groups and noisy places wear me out very quickly, small talk feels awkward and tiring, and I feel most at peace and recharged when I have time alone or with just one person I can be completely relaxed around. I've grown to really value this part of who I am, but lately I've been hoping to meet someone who lives in the same quiet rhythm. Someone I can get to know slowly and naturally, without any pressure to be constantly outgoing, active, or filling every moment with conversation or plans.

I'm currently in my first year of college, keeping my days fairly simple and low-key outside of classes. In my free time I enjoy reading fantasy novels that let me escape into detailed worlds and stories, watching thoughtful movies or series that take their time to develop characters and atmosphere, listening to gentle music like lo-fi, ambient, or soft indie while I journal random thoughts, doodle absentmindedly, or just sit quietly with a cup of tea. I like brewing coffee or tea exactly how I prefer it, taking long walks when the streets are peaceful and uncrowded, collecting quotes or passages that feel meaningful, and simply letting hours pass while my mind wanders freely. Crowded events, loud environments, and packed social schedules make me feel overwhelmed fast. I thrive best in calm, slow, and unhurried moments.

I'm not looking for someone who wants to change that about me or push me into a more extroverted way of living. What I'm hoping to find is another introvert who understands without needing much explanation. Someone comfortable with silences that don't feel empty, who prefers one deep conversation over many light ones, who would enjoy simple shared activities like reading quietly in the same space, exchanging book or music recommendations, watching something atmospheric together, or talking about life, feelings, dreams, or random ideas when the moment feels right. I believe two introverts can build something really gentle, respectful, and meaningful because we both honor personal space and choose closeness carefully.

I'd like to hear from guys around 18 to 23 who also identify as introverted. You don't have to be extremely shy or have trouble talking, just someone who naturally recharges in solitude, thinks deeply, and prefers thoughtful, low-energy connection over constant stimulation or frequent plans. Distance is fine if the conversation feels genuine and worth keeping up.

If this sounds like it could resonate with you, please feel free to message me whenever you're ready. Maybe share a little about yourself, like what you enjoy doing when you're alone, a book or song that's been on your mind lately, or what your idea of a perfect calm evening would be. There's no need to reply quickly or be very talkative at first. We can start small, move at whatever pace feels comfortable for both of us, and see if it grows naturally. I'm just hoping to find one person who makes the quiet feel a little less lonely and a little more shared. Thank you for reading this.",2,1768414812.0,IntrovertDating,2,1.0,False

Like I can troubleshoot production issues fine, that's not the problem, it's more about maintaining any sort of mental sharpness for 12+ hours straight while also not completely destroying my sleep schedule for the next week afterwards.

By hour 8 or 9 my brain just starts turning to mush, especially on those shifts where nothing's really breaking and I'm just sitting there monitoring dashboards waiting for alerts. Coffee stops helping around midday and just makes me feel jittery and kind of anxious which is obviously not ideal when you might need to make quick calls about prod systems. Energy drinks made me feel worse after the rush dropped.

The sleep thing is probably the bigger issue though? Because even if I time my caffeine right I still end up lying in bed at 2am completely wired even though I'm exhausted, then the next day I'm useless. Can't really nap during quiet periods either because my brain won't let me disconnect knowing I could get paged any second.

Just curious what other people do for these situations because my current approach of drinking more coffee and hoping for the best is clearly not working lol. Not expecting some perfect solution, just wondering if anyone's found something that's at least better than what I'm doing now.",2,1768414798.0,devops,2,1.0,False

1qcuvot,https://www.reddit.com/r/diabetes_t2/comments/1qcuvot/a1c_of_51_three_months_after_diagnosis/,A1C of 5.1 three months after diagnosis,"I got my labs done this week after being diagnosed in early October 2025. Not only did my A1C go from 6.7 to 5.1 since Oct. but my ALT liver enzymes went from 53 to 18 and my cholesterol went from 285 to 151. I also lost 16 pounds. I worked so hard to get here and am elated.

I know I am still a diabetic (I always will be!) and plan on continuing to lose weight and eat right to get healthier each and every day. What’s crazy to me is I was able to make these improvements despite never stepping into a gym this entire time, never counting calories and I have still on occasion enjoyed pasta, bread, rice, real dessert on birthdays and Christmas, etc. 

Some background info for anyone who is curious. I’m a 28F and am five feet tall. I weighed 150 at diagnosis. I do have a significant family history of T2d (my dad and two grandparents) but was very surprised when I got the diagnosis. I felt a lot of shame and was super scared and hopeless. Doctor prescribed me 10mg. statin and 500 mg. Metformin (half a pill at lunch and half at dinner) which I tolerated well. Surprisingly he actually told me when I was prescribed a glucometer to avoid checking even daily — only check when you don’t feel well. I think he was just trying not to overwhelm me or make me numbers obsessed. 

Well I’m a numbers person so I didn’t think that would work for me. I was very depressed and ate almost nothing for a few days but then I decided I was going to learn what foods were right for me by slowly trying different meals, seeing how they affected my numbers before eating, one hour after eating and two hours after eating. Over many weeks I introduced different meals into my diet this way and found tons of delicious things that treated my numbers well and learned what spiked me more.

I did a lot of research on what ways of eating might work for me. I determined that I did not want to go full keto but my nutritionist recommended no more than 45 g. Of carbs per meal so I stuck to that. I also made sure nearly everything I consumed had at least 1 g. Of fiber for every 5 g. Carbohydrates. I prioritized protein and almost always ate fiber first, protein second and carbs last. I also went for a long walk after every lunch and dinner. 

I tested a lot at first but as I began to know my body and the numbers became more predictable I only tested every other day or so, or when trying a new food. 

I’d love to make a second post on some of the meals I’ve been hyper fixating on since diagnosis. Dave’s killer thin sliced bread in particular has been an absolute game changer and I’ve been making the most delicious ice coffees of my life every morning using Starbucks zero caramel macchiato creamer, premiere protein, iced coffee  mix and sugar free caramel syrup. I’ve also been loving Wilde protein chips, carb balance tortillas, and beans!!! I eat tons of greens, beans, eggs, cheese, salmon, avocado, chicken, nuts, seeds, etc. 

My biggest contributors to getting my numbers down in my opinion were the 1 to 5 fiber vs. carbohydrate rule, eating fiber first and carbs last, walking after meals, reducing stress with therapy and adjusting my sleep schedule. I also allowed myself occasional treats like on Thanksgiving or Christmas I ate what I wanted but just didn’t eat until I could explode. I enjoyed croissants, potatoes, cheesecake, ramen, etc, but 95% of the time I ate lower carb and high fiber/protein. I also consulted this subreddit a lot. 

I feel so good after losing 16 pounds and just got a gym membership so I can take my fitness goals to the next level. I will probably have to start counting calories soon to continue the weight loss because as I get smaller I know my calories needed will slowly decrease. 

I know that this is just the beginning of what I hope is a long life and going back to old habits will make those numbers shoot up quickly. I was also blessed to catch this early on and I know that the preservation of a lot of pancreatic function was a big influence on my ability to reduce these numbers. It’s a marathon and not a sprint, but for now I am thankful to all the advice I found and am happy I am taking a step in the right direction. I worked really hard through a lot of trial and error and BIG emotions. But I am actually super satisfied with my quality of life right now, especially that I’ve still been enjoying delicious food and feeling satisfied. My relationship with food has really gotten better.

I am looking to buy 1 or several espresso machines to be used seasonally at a concessions building to make primarily iced coffees. 
We just started doing this this previous summer and used Beautiful Slim Espresso machines from Walmart. They worked well for what we were trying to do, but I was worried about longevity.
We typically would pull in an hour or two's time around 50 single or double shots as quick as we could. We did that around twice a day (a morning and afternoon shift.)
After a couple weeks of this, one of the machines was no longer doing double shots and we couldn't figure out why. We also had some overheating issues. 

Our budget is not huge - I would assume less than $500 could be allocated to the project. Maybe up to $1k if it was deemed a necessary expenditure that would also be future proof. 

TL;DR - Looking for an espresso machine to pull quick back to back shots over the course of a couple of hours, 2 times a day, 4 days a week, for about 6 weeks. Small budget. Any suggestions?",1,1768414432.0,espresso,2,1.0,False

Initial phase:-

There is a guy in my office who noticed me a lot of times from far afar one day had the guts to come to me and talk to me and exchanged instagram that day only . I liked his vibe ngl he told me once he opened the lift lobby door for me and I said thank you while looking down and I remembered saying thank you but I did not even look at who the guy was . He was noticing me then one day after I met him I asked him some doubt since I was new and the campus is huge but then he calmed me helped me and he asked me that we would go for a coffee in the evening and we did and that was it I was attracted to this person he knew we were polar opposites and he used to cherish that fact flirt with me I used to reciprocate too and we both used to take initiative to meet each other also he asked me will I marry him and i always told me if everything goes right why not then he is really moody so he blocked me one day out of nowhere on insta but then unblocked me after few days at that time I wasn't in love very very attracted but wasn't in love but he came back and we were again like he used to be like my surname will be urs and all that

Problem begins:- Now we both are marathis but from different castes am a rajput and he is a maratha but he is maratha whose ancestors were rajputs and apparently he made me google his surname once bcoz i was not broughtup in maharashtra so my knowledge was limited . He is some bhonsle type clan now I had 0 idea he knew this that am a big zero but now ever since his brother's marriage got fixed in october things are a different he told me we cannot get married his parents wud never allow it I am a gem of a person and can find a better guy than him apparently his brother also had a gf but he had to go thru arrange marriage route only . Also he has never made me meet his brother whereas I made him meet my mom and then like idk financially am a single child but he says he is not as capable as my family but my father has always taught me to chase the qualities of a person and not money and I don't even care about the money me and him can work hard and earn it but he was flirting with me but then he stopped flirting about marriage otherwise he still flirts but then I asked him some question regarding a public document he lied and then when i fact checked him he said ""nothing is gonna happen b/w you and me in anger"" this happened 2-3 days ago.

I have fallen madly in love with him now I don't know bcoz now sometimes I can see it's intentional to hurt me i can just figure it out if it's normal or intentional . He is seeing me with the lens of short sightedness but at the end of the day am a rajput and even shivaji had to prove he is a rajput to sit on the throne and even he is a rajput origin merged in maratha . Financially maybe he is half bcoz everything will be split b/w him and his brother but am a single child right so we will earn it and we will still have some amount of backup the fact he even lied to me regarding fincnace that broke my heart have I made him so insecure but I told him I love him for who he is and felt like crying bcoz I can take up the bitter truth but not lies now What should i do should I meet his brother to clarify if this caste thing is something he would like to support bcoz am damn sure he hasn't told him and his brother is in same office. But i don't wanna go behind his back at the same time I don't wanna loose him basically I am thinking to have one straight up convo with him but I don't know how hurtful will it be for me

The M2 almost feels like you need to dress up to drive it where the Mustang is more of a shorts and jeans interior.

I don't think the assessment of the DH as a rental Mustang with performance parts bolted on is necessarily wrong, where the M2 is a luxury coupe with performance parts bolted on. Lots of hard plastics abound in the DH, not so much in the M2.

This is different from when I had my Cayman which felt somewhat the same but you also could always feel it was just the price of admission.

Do I just need to get used to driving the M2 more?

It sounds silly but the Tremec and the V8 exhaust note are the big factors making me waffle here, plus the aforementioned ""feel"" that you have to be careful where you drive the M2 despite the DH being the same actual price; in say a movie theater or Home Depot parking lot, the DH would go largely unnoticed compared to the M2.

I get these are more ""quality of life"" issues rather than 0-60 time issues, and I also know having to stare at the Bunn coffee pot in my Ford dealer's service area is a major drop from the more high-end experience at the BMW dealership.",1,1768414370.0,whatcarshouldIbuy,5,1.0,False

Best way to neutralize this?,"I want a reality check from people who’ve dealt with political coworkers who aren’t incompetent, just untrustworthy.

I work on high-visibility, external-facing deliverables at a large company. These go to senior leadership and sometimes regulators, so concision and defensibility matter. I collaborate closely with a peer who has developed a very specific pattern.

The pattern:
	•	He produces long, essay-like drafts that are heavy on exposition and light on clear recommendations.
	•	When asked to shorten, clarify, or commit to specific positions, he evades asynchronously or reframes the feedback as “you’re removing substance,” even when it’s obviously about length and audience fit.
	•	He avoids committing to positions in writing and prefers verbal discussions with no record.
	•	When those tactics fail, he escalates emotionally. Most recently, he walked up to my desk in an open office and spoke sharply and confrontationally, clearly counting on the fact that I wouldn’t push back publicly.

This isn’t new behavior. On a prior project, he overwrote my work early, quietly stepped aside once it became clear execution needed tightening to hit deadlines, and then reappeared at the end to take joint credit. Same playbook, different document.

Leadership has already aligned that these materials need to be tight. I’ve been explicit that I apply the same standard to my own sections. This is not a substantive disagreement. It’s about collapsing ambiguity, forcing decisions, and not letting verbosity substitute for judgment.

At this point, I’m done pretending this is a “style difference.” I’m planning to:
	•	Cut discretionary access (no coffees, no informal syncs).
	•	Keep everything written and scoped.
	•	Refuse desk-side confrontations.
	•	Let managers decide on length/structure rather than debating privately.

Questions for people who’ve seen this before:
	1.	Is this just the standard response once you identify someone who manages status through ambiguity and pressure?
	2.	In the moment, what’s the cleanest way to shut down public intimidation without escalating or looking emotional?
	3.	Do you ever explicitly name this behavior, or do you just quietly starve it of oxygen?

I’m not interested in “communicate more” or “assume good intent.” I’m interested in containment strategies when trust is gone but the person isn’t failing loudly enough to remove.",0,1768414345.0,askmanagers,1,0.5,False
1qcuox9,https://www.reddit.com/r/IntrovertDating/comments/1qcuox9/19f_introvert_looking_for_another_quiet_soul_to/,19F introvert looking for another quiet soul to connect with gently,"Hello. I'm a 19-year-old girl and a classic introvert. Large groups and noisy places tire me out very fast, small talk feels forced and draining, and I genuinely feel most comfortable and recharged when I have time to myself or with just one person I can truly relax around. I've come to accept and even like this part of who I am, but lately I've been hoping to meet someone who shares the same preference for calm and low-key connection. Someone I can get to know slowly, without any expectation to be constantly social, energetic, or always filling the silence with words or plans.

I'm in my first year of college, keeping my days mostly simple and focused outside of classes. In my free time I love reading fantasy novels that let me escape into detailed, immersive worlds, watching slower character-driven movies or series that give space for emotions and atmosphere, listening to gentle music like lo-fi, ambient, or soft indie while I journal random thoughts, doodle in the margins, or just sit quietly with a cup of tea or coffee. I enjoy brewing drinks exactly the way I like them, taking long walks when the streets are peaceful and empty, collecting quotes or passages that resonate with me, and simply letting time pass while my mind wanders freely. Crowded events, loud environments, and back-to-back social plans make me feel overwhelmed almost immediately. I thrive best in quiet, slow, and unhurried moments.

I'm not looking for someone who wants to change that about me or push me into a more extroverted lifestyle. What I'm hoping to find is another introvert who understands without needing much explanation. Someone who feels comfortable with silences that don't need to be awkward, who prefers one meaningful conversation over many surface-level ones, who would enjoy simple shared activities like reading quietly in the same room, exchanging book or music recommendations, watching something thoughtful together, or talking about life, dreams, feelings, or random ideas when the moment feels right. I believe two introverts can build something really gentle, respectful, and deep because we both value personal space and choose closeness intentionally.

I'd like to connect with guys around 18 to 23 who also identify as introverted. You don't have to be extremely shy or have trouble talking, just someone who naturally recharges in solitude, thinks things through before sharing, and prefers thoughtful, low-energy interaction over constant stimulation or frequent plans. Distance is completely fine if the conversation feels genuine and worth keeping up.

If this sounds like it could describe you, please feel free to message me whenever you're ready. Maybe share a little about yourself, like what you enjoy doing when you're alone, a book or song that's been keeping you company lately, or what your idea of a perfect calm evening would look like. There's no need to reply right away or be very talkative from the start. We can begin small, take things as slow as we both need, and see if it feels natural. I'm just hoping to find one person who makes the quiet feel a little less solitary and a little more shared. Thank you for reading this.",0,1768414340.0,IntrovertDating,3,0.5,False

I am not symptom spotting because I know Progesterone can cause all of these symptoms. I am just wondering if others have experienced increased symptoms like this from Progesterone. Like, has it built up in my system? Because I've been on PIO for about ten days now and haven't felt like this until today. Please share your experiences!!",1,1768414234.0,IVF,0,1.0,False

In the end, the whole thing blew up in their faces.","Anyway, last September, after a major layoff that got rid of my entire team and my manager, the geniuses in HR decided to target me. Suddenly, they had a problem with me working from home a few times this year, even though my job was hybrid in nature to begin with.

My old manager was completely fine with it, but after he left, I became an easy target for them.

After a few nerve-wracking meetings, they gave me a formal warning. It was a 15-page file detailing every time I used my key card, my VPN activity, and get this - even my coffee receipts and 'witness testimonies' from people I don't even know. All this to paint me as a rule-breaker and a burden to the company who needed to be fired immediately for cause.

They gave me only 48 hours to prepare my defense against a case they had clearly been building for months. Honestly, my heart sank. But as soon as I started reading their evidence I discovered it was just a pile of corporate nonsense built on ridiculous assumptions.

So I rolled up my sleeves. As a form of poetic justice, I decided to use the company's new AI platform  the one they never shut up about in all the all hands meetings - to help me write my response. I felt it would be very fitting to use their own prized weapon against them.

For the next few months, I was literally just waiting for the moment I'd get fired. I used up all my PTO during the holidays because I was convinced I wouldn't even have a desk to come back to.

Until this afternoon, I got the email. The case is closed. No action will be taken. Looks like they got scared and backed down in the end.

This first day back at work is going to be an interesting one. I'm thinking of stopping by the HR floor to wish them a productive 2028 and reaffirm my loyalty to the company. And, you know, maybe I'll hint that I'd be open to a nice severance package if they'd like for us to part ways amicably

1qcugcr,https://www.reddit.com/r/horrorstories/comments/1qcugcr/uncle_lenny_part_1/,Uncle Lenny (Part 1),"Part 1: The Hill’s

Christmas morning arrived the way it always did in our house. Too bright, too loud, too cheerful.

I sat at the island and watched my mother move through the kitchen humming, her smile fixed and practiced, handing out mugs of coffee as if they were props in a play. My father laughed too easily, clapping me on the back, whistling some Bing Crosby tune as he walked into the kitchen. Ross sat stiffly on the arm of the couch, phone face down in his lap, while Samantha crossed and uncrossed her legs, wrapping and rewrapping her robe’s belt.

We were a family of five who knew exactly how to play pretend.

I noticed it more than ever this year. The way laughter came a second too late. The way nobody asked what time it was.

Because we all knew.

Uncle Lenny would be here soon.

Every Christmas, like a sickness that followed the calendar, Uncle Lenny showed up at our door with a crooked grin and a gift bag. He smelled faintly of cologne and cigarettes. He stayed too long. He lingered too close. He touched shoulders, wrists, backs - always just enough to remind us that he could.

And always enough to remind us what he knew.

I watched the clock tick toward noon and felt the familiar tightening in my chest. It didn’t matter that I was approaching thirty now. Uncle Lenny had a way of making time meaningless.

I looked at my father first. He was pouring a drink a little too early in the day, the ice clinking against the glass - his way of numbing the memories of a summer back when he was a teenager. The August heat. An act of horrific foul play. The long silence that followed. Uncle Lenny had been the one to grab the shovel back then, the one who said they had to stick together. Now, Dad drank to drown out the death rattle of someone taken too soon.

Mom moved around him, her smile tight as she arranged cookies on a platter. She told herself it was just a moment of weakness from a lifetime ago - a time when she felt invisible and Uncle Lenny was the only one looking. But he never let the moment die. He never said the words out loud, yet his eyes held the weight of the betrayal, looking at her not as family, but as a puppet. So she smiled, she baked, and she prayed that the secret she shared with him wouldn't tear her home apart.

On the couch, Ross sat rigid, staring at his phone but looking at nothing. He was nineteen again in his mind - confused and desperate for someone to understand him. Uncle Lenny had offered support, but it came with a price Ross was still paying. A blurred memory of his dorm room and boundaries that were pushed until they collapsed. It wasn't just a secret; it was a shame that Ross couldn’t scrub off in the shower, a stain Uncle Lenny refused to let him wash away.

And then there was Sam, wrapping her robe tighter around her waist like armor. She had been sixteen and terrified when she made the phone call. She hadn’t called our parents; Uncle Lenny answered. He had driven her there. He had paid the bill. He had held her hand while she cried, then held the photograph over her head for two decades. Every time he looked at her, Sam didn't see a loving uncle; she saw the only man who knew what she had sacrificed to keep her life on track.

The doorbell rang.

We all flinched.

Mom smoothed her hair. Dad cleared his throat. Ross shut off his phone. Sam adjusted her robe.

I stayed where I was, finishing the last sip of my coffee. I looked at my family - broken, terrified, and corrupt. They thought they were the only ones with something to hide. They were wrong.

Uncle Lenny had arrived.

And Christmas could finally begin.

The following accounts have been reconstructed from the memories of my family. These are their stories.

1qcufu1,https://www.reddit.com/r/AllInclusiveResorts/comments/1qcufu1/paradisus_playa_del_carmen_review_december_2025/,Paradisus Playa Del Carmen Review - December 2025,"This is my review of Paradisus Playa Del Carmen. I browsed this subreddit obsessively for months - trying to choose the ideal resort for my family and landed on Paradisus after considering Iberostar Paraiso Maya and Finest PM as well. I am very happy with my choice and believe we will go back to Paradisus at some point in the next few years. 

My wife and I (both 37) stayed in early December with our 4.5 year old son. We stayed in a Master Suite Nature View with family concierge. Overall, I think Paradisus (**specifically with family concierge**) is an ideal choice for families with young children who are seeking the following:

1. more focused on pools than the beach 
2. Relative luxury for the price point
3. solid to good food
4. Great service
5. Plenty of entertainment and options for younger children

Paradisus is probably not for you if you need a pristine beach experience, amazing food, *true* luxury, or have older children.  Happy to answer more specific questions in comments. 

————————————————

**Transit + Checkin**

It is about a 45 minute drive from Cancun airport. We used ""Cancun Shuttle"" which was much cheaper than many other options I saw listed but perfectly adequate. Newer vehicle and a friendly driver. 

Resort check-in was smooth, especially with the dedicated family concierge section. Of course, they stored our luggage and we were able to use the resort before our room was ready. 

**Room**

We opted for the Master Suite Nature View because we wanted a separate room from our son and were not interested in a swim up. He slept on a pull out couch which he was very happy with. I wouldn’t have been able to sleep on it (both due to curvature of the mattress and significant staining) and for older children, it may be wise to opt for one of their rollaway beds. 

The room is enormous, as expected. 2 distinct bathroom areas (one with shower and toilet…the other with a jacuzzi tub) and a large balcony. I personally was not a fan of the bed but I’m sure others will love it. I am very used to the types of smooth mattresses that come through the mail (Casper, Tuft & Needle, etc), and the mattress in the room was a spring mattress. It had the classic bumps that I had to adjust to. Bed was quite firm…I found the pillows to be a bit sub par (either too soft or prone to lumping stuffing). 

There is some cosmetic wear and tear in the room (expected with a family resort). Chipped paint, scratches on the dining room table, a discoloration on the couch here or there...nothing deal breaking though.  Some other annoyances were that our balcony door from our bedroom did not open and the shower door didn’t stay closed. We did not contact reception regarding these issues because we spent very little time in the room.

We enjoyed the twice a day sprucing up of the room (a family concierge perk) and consistently stocked mini bar + snacks. 

Ultimately, the room served the purpose we needed it to. It was a well temperatured and comfortable place to sleep. We knew we were not going to spend time in the room aside from sleeping because there is so much to enjoy outside of it. This is why we never complained about the issues I mentioned above.  

**Pools**

There are pools everywhere. The swim up pool snakes around the property with main pools interspersed within.  By my count, there are 4 main pool areas (aside from the swim up snake). 

1. Main Pool…largest and has a volleyball net set up 
2. Pirate Ship Pool…with a climbable pirate ship equipped with 2 small slides
3. Aquazone Waterpark…right outside the central area of the resort. Has 5 water slides and other water play sections
4. Family Concierge Pool

This is one of the resort aspects where the family concierge difference really shines. All the  pool areas are certainly nice, but the family concierge pool significantly nicer. It has the luxury atmosphere and service that we were seeking. The atmosphere was way calmer than all other pool areas due to less people being there and the pool being surrounded by the beautiful mangroves which help to filter sound. It felt like a quiet oasis compared to the main resort areas. The main pools are surrounded by buildings which leads to a noisier experience. The swim up bar is well staffed and well stocked, with premium liquor (I believe). The pool itself might be the largest on the property with plenty of in water loungers. The chair battle in the main pool areas seemed more intense as well. There was plenty of lounge seating for the number of family concierge guests who were using the FC pool. Other cool benefits include a distinct food menu and free sunscreen/after sun gel (perfect to lather on and not worry about exhausting your personal stash). 

We spent 90+ % of our pool time at the family concierge pool. It was a highlight of our stay. 

**Beach**

If you are steadfast on an amazing beach experience, this resort probably isn’t for you. The beach is a 3-7 minute walk depending on where your room is and the beach is not visible from the resort. You pass through the mangroves to get there. Once at the beach, the sand is very nice (soft and fine) but the water is murky. There are some large rock formations near the shoreline beneath the water. And there was some sargassum, but only a little. It was great having family concierge here as well with a private area with plenty of loungers and Bali beds. The smoothie bar at this beach is also great with the best non-alcoholic drinks at the resort. 

**Nature and Wildlife**

The resort is built within the mangrove forest. This creates a beautiful atmosphere - tons of greenery, scenic strolls, and natural shade. Being in such a natural environment means that some furry friends call the resort home. You will see some cats and A LOT of coatis. They are intelligent and resourceful creatures and WILL steal food/drink that you leave unattended. They will go through your bag and find food you left in there. My son loved them and they were never aggressive to truly bother us. 

The main area of the resort with all the restaurants is built with an interconnected Koi pond. My son loved feeding the fish (ask for fish food from your family concierge) but was also excited about the turtles and egrets that would wade in the water, seeking smaller fish to eat. Between the cats, coatis, and deliberate wildlife placements, this ended up being a massive benefit to us with our son’s endless fascination with animals. 

**Kids**

There was no shortage of entertainment for my son. The beach, pools/slides, and animals would have been enough…but the resort does a good job of keeping the little ones entertained. Every day at certain times,  there is something exciting going on in the main area of the resort such as costumed employees, face painting, and dance parties.  One night, they set up bounce houses in a big conference room area. We didn’t attend any of the formal evening programming, but every night had multiple featured activities such as theater shows, movies, and interactive performances.

My son went to the kid’s club (Kidsdom) 3 times and really enjoyed it. The staff was friendly and we never were concerned leaving him there. Three downsides of the kids club are 1) the twice daily closures, 2) limited space, and 3) the fact they don’t feed the children. The club is open from 9am-11pm but it closed from 2-3 and 5-6. This ends up causing a frantic lineup around 5:45 PM where parents who have booked dinner reservations in the adults only section are desperate to ensure their kid gets one of the kids club spots. This is more acute if your child is under 4 years old - I heard they accept a maximum of 4 “babies” at one time. 

If you want your child in the kids club at night, the strategy boils down to:

1. feed them before 5:45 (challenging because there are no restaurants open from 5-6). The best option is ordering room service around 4:30.
2. Lineup at 5:45 (or earlier) 
3. Cross your fingers 

None of this posed a significant issue for us…but if you plan on being free of your children for adult time every night, expect some challenges. 

**Food/Drink**

The food ranges from solid to very good. Very rarely were we blown away by any dishes…but this was expected at an AI at this price point. If you want to be blown away by food at a family resort, you probably have to spend 2X and book Grand Velas. I’ll break down each food establishment we indulged in based on category:

*Breakfast/Lunch*

Grouping these together because they are collectively an aspect where family concierge is really worth it. It gives you access to the Lunch Box restaurant, which has a substantially more refined menu and presentation than the main buffet (which is the only other breakfast option) or the Celsius restaurant by the main pool. We did the buffet for breakfast once and were underwhelmed by the quality, despite the immense variety. Lunch box was consistently excellent. They have a small buffet stand if your kids can’t wait for the a la carte items…but otherwise, all food is prepared to order. For lunch, I was particularly impressed by their catch of the day which was as fresh, tasty, and well presented, better than some fish items at the dinner restaurants. 

*Dinner*

Family concierge was great here as well because I never worried about reservations. I made most of them in the days leading up to our vacation. Our concierge also handled any adjustments we needed to make while on vacation.  

Bana Teppanyaki: great show for the kids but food was just ok 

Cielo: “fine dining” Mexican food but I found the flavors to be a bit muted. Granted, I lived in Mexico City for 2 years so my expectations for aguachile, birria, etc may be a bit high. 

Sal Steak Cave: Included with Family Concierge and probably our best dining experience. Food was **beautifully** presented and very tasty, except for my NY Strip steak which was only average. It was quite thin and didn't have the appropriate crust to reflect an atmosphere of that level. I was most impressed with their desserts (soufflé and cheesecake specifically) which were probably the 2 best things we ate all trip. 

Flora: Healthier options but still presented wonderfully and one of the tastier meals we had. Only flaw was their poached pear dessert...which was not close to right. It was more like a raw pear dipped in wine, without the poaching.  

Blue agave: Worst meal we had. I found the tacos to be average but again, my time in Mexico City likely warped my views here. Most of the meats were dry and the queso app was not good. 

*Snacks*

The ice cream place in the main area is AMAZING.  It is more of a gelato style and all the flavors were delicious. We appreciated the candy, cookies, and other treats spread out through the resort. 

*Coffee*

They have an exclusive deal with nespresso so all coffee based drinks are made with nespresso pods. This was disappointing to me but if you are a nespresso fan, you will be happy. I would have enjoyed a more traditional coffee experience with fresh ground beans. 

*Alcohol*

I enjoyed many different types/styles of margaritas and most bartenders are happy to make recommendations or adjust things for you. The mixed drinks tend to be on the weaker side. My son loved going to the swim up bar at the FC pool and ordering fruit shakes.

**Cenote**

Awesome experience - again, family concierge showing its worth by having this included. The journey is a 30 minute bus ride and you get to enjoy 2 very distinct cenotes. One is a cave that you swim through and the other is more jungly and open air, with cliff jumping and zip lining. Overall, a beautiful diversion into nature that I would highly recommend as a change of pace from the resort. 

**Spa**

Another area where family concierge shines. There is a \~1 hour water ritual included, which is effectively usage of the sauna, steam room, and private pools/jacuzzis. My wife and I greatly enjoyed this small adults only reprieve while our son was in the kids club. Was easy to schedule through our concierge. The spa itself is very nice and well serviced. 

**Our Concierge**

We had Jonathan as our concierge and he was excellent. He was very experienced, mentioning that he has been doing this for over 5 years. He went out of his way to chat with us when passing by at the resort and was very receptive to our requests via Whatsapp.

I asked for some advice here yesterday, and thankfully, u/dikazakov and u/Nick21000_ responded.

My first batch #1 was roasted with the Cubean in Auto Profile mode 23. I am not able to say much about the profile except that the beans were charged at 180 °C, drying was done at around 7 minutes, FC appeared at 193 °C at 11:30 minutes and I dropped them at 13:30 with 209 °C. The weight loss was 16,65% so fairly dark. Its now two days old and as an espresso it tastes, well, underwhelming. I suspected a too long roast, but what do I know.

Yesterday I was able to hook up the Cubean to HiBean (thanks again Discord guys). So, without hesitating I roasted 200 g again, not really knowing what I was doing I just went along pressing some buttons and arbitrarily choosing temperature. See the picture of the HiBean graph for #2 … then I looked for advice here. Suggestions were to shorten the drying phase, increase the Maillard phase, have a higher charge temperature and generally maybe try to shorten the overall time.

With this in mind, I did another roast. Hitting the controls for fan and heater somewhat erratic, having a higher charge temp, I managed to shorten the drying phase from 6:10 to 5:19, and lengthen the Maillard phase from 3:54 to 4:29 and also the time after FC was substantially longer (see graph #3).

Drunk by this success, and because I’m somewhat of a scientist myself (really!), I went for more. Roast graph #4 with less fiddling with the controls to see how the Cubean reacts, but also aiming to get the beans a bit darker… so the roast is overall quite similar, but I waited a bit longer after FC to see what happens. With around 17,5% weight loss, fairly dark I would say. I also noticed that the Cubean does not react very strongly to changing the fan settings, so temperature control seems to be done more with heater power.

Giggling like a mad scientist, I wanted to go even daker now. Roast graph #4. This time I will punch them through the roast, I thought, I went for low fan and high heater settings, and indeed, that sped things up. Drying ended earlier and there was quite some momentum so that I hit FC almost 2 minutes earlier than with #2. But why stop there? How dark can I go? Well, I dared to wait until 219,7 °C before dropping them… beans were popping in the cooling tray, so I suppose I just hit SC. Dark stuff… probably to dark for my taste (18,6% loss).

Anyways, experimenting is fun, I have no real idea what I am doing, but maybe that’s a good thing. I take notes and think this is a good way to get closer to the desired results… but I have none of the same beans left (but 2 kg of another variety). I think I know better now how the Cubean reacts, which seems to be one of the more important things for steering through a roast. Also, the little thing is quite consistent, with the same settings the curves are almost identical… and it is a great feature that one can overlay a new roast with an older one to try to get the same results.

I can already tell that roast 3 (graph #2) and also roast 4 (graph #3) smell like sweet chocolate. Man, especially roast 3 smells like heaven, even my wife said its like hot chocolate, and she despises coffee.

Well smell is one thing I suppose, now I wait a few days and then internalize it…",2,1768413698.0,roasting,0,1.0,False

1qcubm7,https://www.reddit.com/r/TalesFromTheCreeps/comments/1qcubm7/a_serial_killer_broke_into_my_house_that_isnt/,A Serial Killer Broke Into My House... That Isnt Even The Scary Part,"By HR Welch

It was around midnight a few years ago when I heard the sound of someone breaking into my house. I don’t think I had more than twenty minutes of sleep but as soon as I heard the window being broken I was wide awake and looking for my phone to call the police. 

My heart sank when I remembered that I left it downstairs, charging in the kitchen. The source of the break in. 

I live alone, had no one as backup and didn't have a gun, so I grabbed the only thing that could pass as a weapon: a baseball bat. Once I had that, I psyched myself up to go downstairs to face the intruder. 

Once I reached the bottom step I saw the silhouette of a man sitting at my kitchen table. It was dark so I could not see what he looked like but the stink coming off him was enough to curl my nose hairs. It was obvious even without the lights on that he was, at best, a drifter and at worst a vagrant. Either way, even a blind man could see that whoever broke into my house fell on hard times. Not that that was going to change my mind about kicking him out of my house. He did break in after all. 

When I turned on the lights I could see that his clothes were old, dirty and torn. It was as though he pulled them out of a dumpster. He was so skinny that I wouldn't be surprised if the man was sick on top of being malnourished. His hair was long and stringy and, just like his beard, it grew in patches. The way he sat there motionless with his thousand yard stare and tears forming in his eyes made me think that he had given up on life. 

I was about to tell him to get out but as soon as I opened my mouth I noticed that he had a shotgun on his lap. 

Upon seeing this I lowered the bat and nervously asked him what he wanted. However he didn’t answer me. Instead, he just sat still and stared straight ahead as if I wasn't even in the room with him. 

Scared, I asked him if he was hungry and that I could make him something. As a kid I was instructed to give the homeless food instead of money since they might buy booze or drugs with it, but the man didn't answer. So after a long awkward silence I took the initiative and went to heat up some leftovers in the microwave. As I was doing this I prodded the stranger with questions, what his name was, what he wanted and if he wanted me to call anyone. 

He did not answer for a long time and hardly noticed the food I placed in front of him once it was ready. However, once he started talking he told me a story that would change my life forever. 

He said his name was Cole Dyer and admitted to killing twenty people. 

I’m not at all embarrassed to say that I cried and begged for my life at this point. This only angered Cole.

“I have something I need to fucking get off my chest. So sit the fuck down and shut up.”

Doing what he said, I sat across from Cole who told me how he got started killing people. His first victim was a hooker who he choked to death when he thought she was stealing from him. With the shotgun in his lap I didn't want to anger him so I just sat there and didn't ask any questions. 

Cole would go on to explain that this victim wasn't killed like the others because, at that time he didn't know how he wanted to murder people, or for that matter, knew that he had a taste for it.

“I figured it would be just a matter of time before some cop showed up at my doorstep or came to my work to ask questions. But after a few weeks of no one coming around and not even a mention in the obituaries, I figured I was in the clear” Cole explained. “It shouldn't be surprising that no one gave a shit about her. If anyone cared for her she wouldnt have been a fucking hooker, you know?”

Finally having a way to vent his frustrations and no longer feeling like some cog in the machine, Cole’s murderous fantasies took on a life of their own. 

“When I tried going after the second person, I tried to strangle her with a piece of guitar string. That was messy and loud and I nearly got caught. Not long after that, maybe five or six people later I came up with my own preferred method of killing people” Cole explained. “I even gave myself a silly name: The ‘Pass It On Killer.’”

It was the first time I spoke in what seemed like an hour. A single word. 

“Why?”

“Why what? The name?” Cole asked but I was too afraid to answer. 

Annoyed with my silence, Cole went ahead and explained his reasoning by justifying his twisted sense of righteousness and questionable moral compass. The gist of it was that if he killed enough “pests” good things would come back to him. 

Symbolizing this he would replace the head of his previous victim with the most current.

“Cutting off a head is hard. Even if you have power tools it's messy shit. Took a while before I got the hang of it though” Cole confessed, oblivious to my disgust. “I rigged a bike pump to a catheter, snaked it through the axillary nerve until it reached the superior vana cava. It only took about two minutes before the blood stopped flowing and by then removing the head was pretty much blood free”.

Realizing killing people he knew was a sure way of getting caught Cole learned what questions to ask complete strangers to discover the “pests” in their lives. This was easier than Cole would have guessed because in the end who didn’t like talking about themselves?

“I was always good at talking to people, you know? I could talk the devil into lighting himself on fire. Because of that it was easy to learn where the pests lived, worked, drove and more.""

Since the murders were spread out nationwide and none of his victims had any connections to each other or Cole, the authorities were at a loss. When there was a news article talking about a murder no one ever mentioned that they were connected. 

“They didn't want to cause a panic, you know? It wasn't often, but when the newspapers said the head was removed, they would say it was removed with a sword or an ax or whatever. They did this so when someone tries to take credit, they say the wrong tool and the police know it's bullshit and a waste of time. Obviously I never called any of the hotlines or tried to taunt authorities. That would just give them more clues to work with.”

I felt sick. This man was crazy and dangerous. More than that, he had a gun and was sitting across the table from me. 

“At first hearing and reading about the police chasing down leads terrified me. However after so much bullshitting they did to the public, their claims that they were closing in on a suspect didn't bother me in the slightest” Cole said with a rotten tooth smile that quickly evaporated. 

A flood of tears started filling his eyes and he blinked them away before taking the first nibble of food.

Just when it seemed that he was calm, Cole shouted at me, demanding that I grab a pen and paper and jot down his tale. 

Who was I to say no? Even though he had his hands on the table there was still a shotgun in his lap. I didn’t want to bet that it wasn't loaded or that I was faster. The safe bet was just to write the story he was telling me and hope he would show me mercy.

“I was doing this for a long time. Nearly ten years at this point. And while scouting for the twenty-first victim I found myself behind a small series of apartment buildings” Cole said, shaking his head as if he was in disbelief of his own tale. “I heard a small group of people huddled around someone's basement apartment, whispering to whoever was inside. They were a ways away so I couldn't make out the details at the time but I could see that something wasn't right about them. They were dirty. Long greasy hair and beards. But there was something else about them. Something… something evil.”

“Why do you say that?” I asked without thinking. To this day I don't know if that outburst was because I was curious or tired.

“One by one they stopped their hushed whispering and turned their gazes towards me. It was creepy as fuck so I got the hell out of there” Cole responded as though he didnt hear my question. “When I took a peek over my shoulder they were following me but stayed just out of the cone of light the street lamps provided.”

I had to admit, that sounded pretty scary, but evil? I kept my thoughts to myself and kept writing.

“It creeped me out. I was already thinking of finding someone else to kill because I don’t like killing in apartment buildings. Too many neighbors to see you or hear you when you're using the saw, you know? When I saw them though, that sort of settled it. I wasn’t going to go back there. I kept looking back in the mirror on the way home to see if I was being followed but in the five hour drive I didn’t see a thing behind me. The next day, however, I noticed a car driving slowly though my parking lot every few hours. I was smoking lots of weed at the time and figured I was just being paranoid but the next night I woke up to tapping on the door”.

As Cole explained to me what happened next he started to rock back and forth the way I’ve seen children do in an effort to calm himself down before continuing his story. 

“Thought it was my imagination at first but then I started hearing my name being whispered from the hallway. When I realized I wasn't imagining the noises I looked out the peephole.”

Cole took a moment before continuing but before he spoke he swallowed and took a drink of water from the glass I gave him. 

“There were at least five of them that time. Dirty, long hair and dark sunken eyes that seemed to glow with the hatred of some sort of hellist pit. They spent the entire night begging me to come out.” 

With the exception of the eyes, it was as though Cole was describing himself. Again, this was a thought I kept to myself.

“In that building it wasn't uncommon to hear drunken exes pound on doors demanding to be let in so their begging went on for hours. Eventually a neighbor I never bothered to get to know decided to open the door to tell the strangers to keep it down. She stopped mid sentence the moment she saw them,” Cole explained. “They pushed her back into her apartment and all piled in. Through that thin wall I could hear them tearing through her place and when she cried or begged or groaned they just laughed. Eventually they made the woman beg me to come out from my apartment. Whenever she did they would laugh and instruct her to say it louder. She would comply with their demands and her reward would be getting hit more.”

“Jesus” I blurted out.

“When I refused to open the door or even respond they grew bored and started getting even more violent with the woman. First the sounds of punches and things getting broken, but then… Jesus. They were eating her. It was loud and wet and lasted until the sun came up”.

“How did you know they were eating her? They were in a different apartment.”

“They didnt close the fucking door,” Cole answered. “Saw it when I was leaving.” He was clearly annoyed with the interruption, reminding me that I didn’t want to interrupt someone who was obviously crazy. The best course of action for me to take was to remain silent and allow Cole to go on for as long as he wanted. 

Cole then quickly ate the rest of the meatloaf I heated up for him and asked for more. When I grabbed him another piece, he stopped me from heating it up so I set it in front of him instead. Considering how he looked I thought he was going to inhale it like the other piece, but it sat there for a long time before he touched it. 

“I didn't leave my room until I was confident they were gone and that it was safe to leave. There was no way I was going to stay there. No fucking way. I packed my car and took off. I didn't know what I would need at the time, so I took my camping gear, my tools, a few guns and of course, the head of the previous pest who I kept on ice. After that I went straight to some army surplus store to get the rest of what I needed.” 

At first I assumed he was going to go out in the woods, but it became obvious that what he really meant was staying at a seedy hotel that didn't take credit cards or require ID’s. 

“About a week later I was getting some grub at some grocery store, just walking in the parking lot and minding my own business, right? They drove up right behind me and laid on the horn. I didn’t even bother getting something to eat after that. I just wanted to get the hell out of there. By the time I remembered that I left the head back in the hotel's mini fridge I had already crossed two state lines.”

I could tell this bothered him greatly and I assumed it was because now the police would have a lead and find the identity of the Pass It On Killer. However, as if reading my mind, Cole let out a dry laugh and told me the reason he was sour about it, even years later, was because he has “completion anxiety.”

At this point of the story Cole had to take a moment, and knowing that he had a shotgun on his lap I gave it to him. Hoping that my kindness would be repaid and I could keep my head once he finished his tale I poured him some milk and offered him the rest of the baby carrots I had in the fridge.

Since I live alone, I don't have much food for unexpected guests. At the time I was sure the food I was offering him would be enough of an excuse for this psycho to kill me. When I set it down in front of him, my hands were trembling.

“They had to know what I was driving, so I traded my car for a van. At least I could sleep in the van, right? Saves money on hotels and shit” Cole explained. “About five weeks later I crossed their paths again. This time I was in a deep sleep when I heard them say my name. In my dream the name was like an echo and when I woke up my eyes were immediately locked on the dark eyes of a woman with the same sinister resemblance as the men I saw back at the apartment. Without a beard, however, this woman's disfiguration was more noticeable.”

“Disfiguration?” I asked.

Cole gave a grunt that might have meant nothing, something or everything. “I might as well tell you everything, right? You are writing down my tale after all” Cole said, clearly not excited to relive the experience. “At first I thought it was a cleft lip and chin but it wasn't. The few teeth that she had were small and brown and grew fucking everywhere” Cole explained as his dirty fingers were fidgeting with the gun in his lap. “Like the gums and the inside of the cheeks and shit. Even in the dark I could see their black eyes and when I jumped into the front seat and turned over the engine the headlights revealed dozens of her family. They were all standing ten or so feet apart from each other, scattered around. Some were naked but they were all standing still, smiling and just looking at me. Like they were giving me permission to leave.”

Gooseflesh covered my entire body and I was having trouble keeping up with Coles story because he was talking too fast. 

“I tried to swerve and hit a few with the front tire or to at least clip them with the van’s fat ass; however, they all stepped to the side, effortlessly avoiding getting run down.”

As Cole took a moment to catch his breath, I asked what he meant when he said “Her family.”

“Thats a recent term I gave them. At the time I thought they were demons or vampires but not any longer.”

I wanted to ask him why he no longer thought this was the case, but I kept this question to myself. I felt I pressed my luck enough at this point with all the questions I had been asking. After all this man was insane and armed.

“After that encounter I abandoned the van and stole a car. I would do this every so often, whenever I felt that they were closing in on me. A gut feeling. This was triggered by anything from something I imagined seeing in the corner of my eye to the cries coming from a murder of crows.”

Again, I had a bunch of questions but didn't dare ask them. What did crows have to do with these people after Cole?

“Zig zagging across the country I made every effort to forever rid myself of these people. I would stay inside at night and if I could I would sleep during the day. I would pass the time by reading and listening to music. You know, good music. Peter Warlock? Bach?”

I knew who Bach was, but never heard of the other name. 

“Classical?” I asked, surprised because of Cole's appearance.

“Vivaldi Concerto No. 5 is my favorite. Bet you wouldn't have guessed that I also play the cello.”

I had no idea if Cole was pulling my leg or not, but I didn't have time to react, Cole was back to telling his story.

“While on the run I would take odd jobs here and there to pay for what I needed to survive. A tractor assembly line in Michigan, a toll booth operator in Florida and a semi weight station in Nevada. Whatever job paid in cash and as long as I didn’t have to work at night. No matter where I found work I would not stay long before feeling that they were closing in on me. More often than not I would leave before getting a paycheck.”

Up to now he had been talking to me, a captive audience due to the shotgun on his lap for well over four hours. I was tired but Cole seemed to be wide awake. During a moment of silence I asked Cole if he wanted any coffee. He accepted so I made a pot for the two of us to share. 

I could feel Cole stare at me as I made the coffee and my heart was beating so loud I swore Cole was able to hear it. The silence went on for what felt like hours. Finally I couldn't take it anymore and had to break the silence. 

“How do you take your coffee?”

“Very strong. No cream. No sugar.”

As the coffee started brewing, the tension was so thick that it made the room feel as though I was breathing through a hot wet rag. This went on for some time and I think Cole was enjoying the sight of making me uncomfortable because he only continued his story when I started filling the cups.

“Before coming here I was staying at a place up in northern Canada for about three months. A loft above a bar. Figured that a bar full of people at night would keep me safe” Cole said, again fidgeting with the gun. “I had an arrangement with the owner. In exchange for the room, I would work as the janitor, unload trucks, do some deliveries, etcetera. I kept to myself and people left me alone, the only time I was ever bothered was when there was work to be done. It was nice while it lasted, however when they finally arrived they… they were under the window in the alley, softly calling out to me. With all the music being played downstairs I have no idea how long they were there, but the moment I knew it was them the giggling began.”

For some reason, giggling as soon as Cole noticed them creeped me out far more than anything he said so far. 

“They tried to flatter me by saying they were my biggest fans and tried to prove it by telling me details that only the Pass It On Killer would know” Cole said, his eyes looking into the darkened room behind me. 

“I told them off. Called them vampires because they couldn't come inside without permission. That was the first thing I ever said to them and as soon as I said that, everything went silent. I must have been used to the sounds they were making because I didn’t notice it until it stopped. That’s when someone with a strange accent told me that they were not vampires but in fact something else. Something that I---”. 

Cole never finished this thought. In the silence that followed I didn't know what he was going to do and this terrified me. 

It might have been lack of sleep on my part, possibly even momentary insanity but I had to know who, or what was chasing Cole. When I asked he didn't answer so I pressed my luck and asked him a second time 

“What else needs permission to enter a house other than vampires?”

Again he didn't answer and even though I knew it was a mistake to poke the bear I started to ask again. As soon as the words started to leave my mouth Cole reached into his inner breast pocket and pulled out what I thought at the time was paper napkins. After inspecting it for a moment with an expression I have never seen before, Cole slapped them down on the table between us. 

Written on them in everything from pen to marker to pencil were the messages “Let us in”, “Open the door” and more. It was hard to tell what else was said because the writing overlapped. However, it was clear to me that these messages were written by dozens of people.

As I picked one up to look at it closer and ascertain what else was written down on them, my finger rubbed the glossy underside. Turning it over I saw that it was a photograph showing Cole sleeping in what appeared to be a small apartment, the next appeared to be him in an abandoned bus, a dirty attic and so on. 

In some of the pictures Cole looked twenty years younger and it made me wonder just how long he was on the run for. I know that stress can prematurely age people but I had a hard time believing that the person in the picture and Cole were one and the same.

“They don't need permission to enter someone's house” he said as his gaze returned to the empty space behind me. 

I had to look back to see if anything was there and was more relieved than words could explain when I saw nothing behind me.

We sat there quietly for what seemed like an eternity before Cole said anything else. When he did it was as if he suddenly remembered that he was telling me a story and picked up where he left off. The part where they then cut the power to the apartment and the bar under him. 

“It didn’t take long before the woman tending bar that night was shouting at them not to come closer. They just laughed. They tore her apart and all I could do was listen and wait until morning to come” Cole confessed with a shake of his head as if to eject the thoughts from his mind. “Thing is, Canada has some long nights during the winter and I only had enough food for a few days”. 

Cole didn’t tell me how long he stayed in that room for and I didn’t want to ask. It was obvious from the thousand yard stare that these events were still fresh in his mind so I kept my mouth shut.

“When I finally left my room I saw gore sprinkled everywhere. Like a trail of breadcrumbs that started from behind the bar and led right to my apartment. I had seen blood before, but this was something else entirely. I was careful not to touch anything with my bare hands as I emptied the cash register and stole a toolbox from the back office so I could switch license plates to throw them off my scent.”

“Do you know how to kill them?” I asked.

Cole shook his head. “I don’t know how to stop them but I think I have a good idea how to slow them down,” but before he could elaborate he noticed that the sun was shining through my kitchen window. Grateful that he went another night without seeing them and having someone he could talk to, Cole thanked me for listening.

I didn’t know what to say to such a story. What could I say? In the pregnant silence that followed I filled the void by rambling about whatever came to mind. My job, the annoying coworkers and how my boss is always looking over my shoulder. 

As if this was at all similar to Cole's own story.

I didn’t think anything of Cole asking me if I liked my job or where I worked at the time and soon I was answering all of his questions. 

After a short while Cole thanked me again, then he stood up, took my car keys off the counter and left without another word.

It might have been ten minutes after Cole left before I called the police and all I said to them was that my house was broken into and that my car was stolen. After all, the truth was so unbelievable that if I said anything else it might make me look as crazy as Cole. 

Maybe I didn't say anything else because I was tired? I don't know for certain.

The more distance I put between myself and that night the less real it felt. But then reality set in once I learned that my boss was found dead a few days later.

According to the local newspaper, Whisper Alley Echos, pieces of my boss were found all over his bedroom. Most people in town considered this to be an exaggeration to stir up newspaper sales and I wanted to agree but it was hard to, considering Cole's tale. 

In the back of my head the idea of what Cole told me being true kept teasing me. It bothered me so much that I ended up hiring a private investigator, a decision I came to regret. I would rather be ignorant of what came next. A week after hiring the PI, I received a phone call informing me that my boss's head was found in the middle of another bloody mess all the way in Cleveland. 

Not only that, but the private investigator also informed me that the local newspaper apparently withheld the fact that a different person's head was discovered in my boss's freezer. I assume it was the head Cole left in the hotel fridge but kept this to myself.

Over the next few weeks I kept thinking of the story Cole told me. If those thoughts weren't front and center they were creeping in the back, ready to pounce on a happy moment to turn it sour. 

It didn’t take long before I started seeing dark patches dart from one shadow to the next, disappearing as soon as I turned to look at it. At first I chalked this up to being a mouse, the reflection off of my glasses or lack of sleep (After all it was much harder to sleep in a house that was broken into). Hoping it wasn't mice because of my hatred towards them I bought some medicine in town so I could get some rest at night. It worked wonders when it came to getting shuteye but did nothing to stop me from seeing these shadows.

With an embarrassing frequency I would imagine the reflecting eyes on the side of the road were Cole's night visitors or think of them whenever I heard the house settle. 

It was as though toying with the idea of them being real was enough to invite them into my life.

I don’t recall what came first, hearing my name being called out in public, a sound similar to a murder of crows cawing or the soft scraping at my screen windows at night. However once I realized that the noises and the visions were real there was no way to block them out.

At night the soft whispers were hard to make out and the more I tried to ignore them the more I thought about them.  

I could not tell you how many nights I stayed up just so I could put my ear up to the wall but I can tell you it was worth the effort, because unlike Cole, I know what they want. 

They whispered of a message that took months before I understood it fully, but in those words that only someone with a certain madness could grasp, I understood. You see, they aren’t a family like Cole said. They are more akin to nomads who will only accept members with certain propensities to join their roving community.

It wasn't as long as you might think before I did the one thing Cole was never brave enough to do and opened the door. 

The first night I opened the door for them was terrifying, like losing one's virginity. Even with Cole's descriptions there was no way I could have been prepared for their appearance because they resembled humans the way sharks look like dolphins.

During these conversations they instructed me to share Cole's story with the world so some of his madness could rub off on others and “season the meat.”

In this partnership of ours they gained a buffet of people, while I gained so much more. Not only would they tell me tales I would pass off as my own, but in time I could join their ranks. 

Heralding their coming will include everything from seeing shadows in the corner of your eyes, the sounds of whispering and something similar to the cawing of crows. 

Once these or any dozen of other signs occur, it's the beginning of the end. And when that happens you can thank me, a better and far more successful Pass It On Killer than Cole ever was.",1,1768413558.0,TalesFromTheCreeps,1,1.0,False

i’m trying to figure out if this med is working or i just think its working because it’s ‘supposed to’? kinda like a placebo effect. 

generally over the past year ive lost interest in things that usually excite me, like reading, and i flit from thing to thing without any satisfaction. i push off work until the last two hours of the work day and feel the need to constantly be on my phone between tasks. my organization skills have gone downhill, my employers have noticed and asked whats wrong, and im generally making stupid mistakes. my adhd isnt me being hyper, its low self esteem, no motivation to start anything, loss of interest in things that generally make me happy, and impulsivity and forgetfulness. 

yesterday i got the head rush and tingly limbs in the morning. my heart rate was fine and i didn’t feel overly anxious. i actually got most of my work done and didnt stare at the clock or count hours down. felt more motivated but also gaslit myself into thinking its all in my head. when i get home i usually hyper focus on my switch to the point i dont remember hours have passed, but i felt like i could put it down anytime and didn’t get snappy when interrupted. did not have a crash when i got home but didn’t fall asleep until 12am.

today i didnt drink coffee with it and ate a protein packed breakfast. im usually dead if i don’t have coffee but i’ve been pretty energetic. i now have a headache but it’s probably caffeine withdrawal. i feel generally happier and pretty chatty and finished work right when it was given to me. hunger hasnt been affected. the day has seemed to fly by, i can’t believe its 1pm.

am i just convincing myself it’s working? do i need more time to actually tell if it is? or am i just being paranoid?

Initially it was actually beneficial for my mental health, as before that I was on mat leave for almost a year. I was looking forward to going back to working and seeing adults.
Recently I noticed though that my anxiety and depression have been getting worse. I also started to feel as if I can't fully wake up and the whole day I am seeing everything through fog. I attributed it first to the winter weather, as there has been almost zero days with any sunlight for the past several months.

I've been regularly taking vitamin D and my levels were tested and they are fine.
I started to wonder whether it is really just due to winter or could anything else be worsening my symptoms.

I then realized that I made a similar Reddit post a few years ago. It was about realizing that I became addicted to coffee and how quitting it improved my symptoms of anxiety and brain fog.

I realized that I am making exactly the same mistake again. 

When I started going to the office, I was still mindful of the addiction issue, and I drank one cup of coffee only on those days when I would be in the office. But then I also bought a drip filter and started to drink coffee when I was working from home and on weekends. Then occasionally I started drinking two cups of coffee a day when it was in the office. Then I would wake up and feel that I am not awake and I would want coffee right away.

Basically this is exactly same addiction pattern that I went through previously, but my brain refused to realize it for several months.

I have now haven't had caffeinated coffee for almost a week and my symptoms, especially brain fog, are drastically improved. I don't mean that anxiety and depression are gone, I have been diagnosed more than 10 years ago, but they are better. The brain fog is actually almost gone, I believe in my case it was specifically the coffee that was causing it

I have now been drinking only some black and green tea and maybe one cup of decaf coffee a day and I feel much better. It is as if I see colours brighter, sharper images, I feel calmer.

I don't know what it is about coffee, but I don't experience brain fog and anxiety from tea.",1,1768413155.0,Anxiety,0,0.67,False
1qcu4xa,https://www.reddit.com/r/SocialBlueprint/comments/1qcu4xa/how_to_effortlessly_charm_anyone_the_psychology/,How to Effortlessly Charm ANYONE: The Psychology Behind Genuine Connection,"I spent months analyzing thousands of social interactions, reading communication psychology research, listening to Charisma on Command breakdowns, and studying behavioral science to figure out why some people just naturally draw others in. And honestly? Most advice about charm is complete garbage. It's either ""smile more!"" or some manipulative pickup artist BS that makes you feel gross.



Here's what nobody tells you: charm isn't about being the loudest person in the room or having perfect one liners. It's about making people feel seen. That's it. When you understand the actual psychology behind human connection instead of trying to fake confidence or memorize scripts, everything shifts. Society constantly pushes this idea that charismatic people are born special, but neuroscience shows us that social skills are literally just patterns you can learn and rewire through practice.



Make people the main character of the conversation. This sounds stupidly simple but most people completely miss it. We're trained to think charm means being interesting, so we jump in with our own stories the second someone mentions something we relate to. That's the opposite of magnetic. Research from Harvard's psychology department found that talking about yourself activates the same pleasure centers as food and money. When you ask genuine questions and actually listen to the answers, you're literally giving someone a dopamine hit. Not surface level ""how was your weekend"" stuff either. If someone mentions they just got back from hiking, don't immediately launch into your hiking story. Ask what trail, what made them pick that one, if they saw anything cool. Let them elaborate. People will remember you as the most interesting person they talked to, even though they did 70% of the talking. Wild how that works.



Stop planning what you'll say next while someone else is talking. I'm calling myself out here too because this is hard to break. But the difference between someone who seems genuinely engaged versus politely waiting their turn is massive. There's this concept in improv comedy called ""yes, and"" where you build on what the other person gives you instead of redirecting. Use that in regular conversation. If someone says they're stressed about a work deadline, don't pivot to your own stress. Build on theirs first. ""That sounds intense, what's the project?"" Let the conversation breathe before you relate it back to yourself, if at all. Your brain will adapt to this style faster than you think once you consciously practice it a few times.



Physical warmth translates to emotional warmth faster than you'd expect. Studies in social psychology journals show that people literally perceive you as warmer personality wise when there's appropriate physical proximity and open body language. Face people fully when they talk, not at an angle. Keep your phone in your pocket. Uncross your arms. Match their energy level, don't bulldoze it. If they're speaking quietly in a coffee shop, don't boom your responses. This mirroring happens naturally with people we vibe with, but you can consciously do it to build rapport faster. Not in a creepy mimicking way, just subtle energy matching. The Charisma Myth by Olivia Fox Cabane breaks this down with actual behavioral science instead of feel good fluff. Cabane coached executives at places like Google and she includes practical exercises, not theory. The book completely shifted how I think about presence and warmth as skills rather than personality traits. If you've ever felt invisible in group settings, this book will actually give you a framework that makes sense.



Be comfortable with silence. Anxious people, me included, feel this compulsion to fill every gap in conversation. That energy is palpable and exhausting for everyone involved. Pausing after someone speaks shows you're processing what they said, not just waiting for your turn. It makes your eventual response land with more weight too. Some of the most charismatic people I know will literally just sit there nodding for a second before they respond. That comfort with space signals confidence in a way that rushing never does.



Vulnerability creates connection way faster than perfection. Everyone's walking around trying to seem like they have their shit together, which makes them utterly forgettable. When you can laugh at yourself or admit you're struggling with something, people lean in. Obviously read the room, don't trauma dump on your barista. But in genuine conversations with people you're trying to connect with? Ditch the highlight reel. If someone asks how you are and you're actually stressed about something, it's fine to say that. Not in a complaining way, just honest. ""Honestly been better, dealing with some family stuff but I'm managing. What about you?"" instantly creates more authentic ground than ""Good! You?"" The psychology behind this is called the pratfall effect, where people with high competence become more likeable when they show they're human too.



Remember small details people tell you and bring them up later. This is honestly the most underrated move. Someone mentions their dog's name in passing? Remember it. Ask about the dog by name next time you see them. They mentioned they were nervous about a presentation? Follow up on it afterward. Your brain might resist this at first like ""I can't remember everyone's random details"" but you absolutely can once you start trying.

Built by Columbia alumni and former Google engineers, it generates on-demand podcasts tailored to your goals, whether that's improving social skills or understanding communication psychology deeper. You control the depth, from a quick 10-minute overview to a 40-minute deep dive with real examples and context. There's also a virtual coach called Freedia that builds an adaptive learning plan as you go, learning from what resonates with you. The voice options are honestly addictive, you can pick anything from a sarcastic tone to something smooth like Samantha from Her. It's been useful for internalizing concepts from books like The Charisma Myth without having to carve out dedicated reading time.



Stop apologizing for existing. ""Sorry, can I ask you something?"" ""Sorry, just wanted to add..."" Unless you genuinely wronged someone, cut that word from your vocabulary in social settings. It signals that you think your presence or input is an inconvenience. Replace ""sorry I'm late"" with ""thanks for waiting."" Replace ""sorry, one more question"" with ""quick question."" The energy shift is immediate. You're not being rude, you're just not pre-emptively diminishing yourself. Confident people take up space without apology, not in an aggressive way, in a ""I belong here"" way.



Compliment specifics, not generics. ""You're so smart"" does nothing. ""The way you explained that concept made it click for me, I'd been confused about it for weeks"" makes someone feel genuinely seen. Generic compliments feel like small talk. Specific ones show you were paying attention. This goes for appearance too. ""Cool shoes"" is whatever. ""Those Sambas are sick, I love the colorway you picked"" hits different because it's clear you actually looked.



Learning to genuinely charm people isn't about becoming someone else or using tricks. It's about making space for other people while being authentically yourself. The combo of being present, curious, and undefended makes you magnetic without effort. You're not performing, you're connecting. That's the difference between someone people tolerate and someone people actively want to be around.",1,1768413153.0,SocialBlueprint,0,1.0,False

Stuck between Nuna Triv LX and Swiv strollers,"We are having our first child and in an ideal world we wanted to end up with two strollers: a light, well-rounded everyday stroller that could still work well with travel and then an eventual jogging stroller. For the everyday all arounder we’ve ended up between the following:

Nuna Swiv - my husband is obsessed with the 360 wheels on this. It also was lighter than the next and seems to have a bigger basket than the triv. I also like that I can get the stroller alone and then get a separate car seat bc we really want the Pipa Aire RX

Nuna Triv Lx - I love that these have larger more all terrain wheels for more versatility, it’s lighter and travel friendly and also newborn ready and seems to have good materials even though the Swiv might have more lux materials but smaller less smooth wheels. One drawback with this stroller is you have to get it with the Pipa Urban car seat which we did not prefer. No way to get around it. We could potentially just sell this car seat and get the one we want maybe but idk how easy that is. But even as a bundle it’s comparable in price to getting the Swiv alone. 

Also curious about how these stack up to the Uppa Baby Cruz and if you think that’s better than these. We’ve only tried Nuna in person. 

About us - we live in Seattle suburbs and are very active. We will take the baby on a lot of walks ranging from neighborhood to maybe some trails (eventually a jogging stroller will likely fill the gap of more rugged terrain when baby is older enough) and then your classic suburban errands. We live walking distance but also driving distance to stores. I wouldn’t say we live a super urban city lifestyle but we do sometimes walk to get coffee. Drive to grocery and shopping and errands. You get the point. My husband is 6’2 and I am 5’3. ",1,1768413051.0,Buyingforbaby,8,1.0,False

Posting this to update everyone after my earlier post asking for tips. Sharing how the trip actually went — **route, costs, road conditions, stay, food, trek, and some honest warnings**. Hope this helps anyone planning something similar.

---

## TL;DR

* Stunning but **physically and logistically demanding**
* Roads after Tawaghat are **very rough**
* Own car works only if it has **good ground clearance + patience**
* **No network, no electricity**
* Zero Point trek is doable if you’re reasonably fit
* Please don’t come here just to drink/smoke

---

## Basics

* **Start:** Delhi (left the same night I made the post, not Chandigarh)
* **Dates:** Early Jan (snowfall on Jan 3 evening)
* **Group:** 5 people
* **Car:** Tata Harrier (Diesel)

---

## Route & Journey

We left **Delhi around 1 AM** and reached **Khatima by ~5 AM**. Took a tea break, bought veggies and bread, cooked Maggi roadside, and made sure to carry all our waste and dump it properly later.

From there, we drove slowly because of the constant curves (a couple of people were prone to motion sickness). Reached **Pithoragarh around 1 PM**, cooked lunch (rice, dal, salad), and washed utensils using water from roadside pipes sourced from hill streams.

After Pithoragarh, the scenery really opens up. We kept stopping for snacks, picked up a local orange-like fruit that instantly lifted everyone’s mood, and reached **Askote around 6–6:30 PM**. Bought chicken there to cook later.

The road **after Askote is badly damaged**. The 30 km stretch to Dharchula took us **2–3 hours**, and we reached around **9:30 PM**.

---

## Stay in Dharchula

We booked **2 rooms for 5 people offline** just an hour before reaching and were pleasantly surprised.

* **Hotel:** Kailash Manas Hotel
* **Cost:** ₹2500 total (₹500 per person)
* Clean rooms, clean bathrooms, hot water, and permission to cook

Highly recommended if you’re stopping in Dharchula.

---

## Dharchula → Tawaghat → Dantu (Hardest Part)

One of us woke early to make pasta and coffee, and we left around **8:30 AM**. The 17 km till Tawaghat was smoother than expected, but **network completely disappeared** after Dharchula (Airtel).

After the left turn from Tawaghat, things get serious. Roads turn into long stretches of unpaved, rocky terrain with multiple broken or under-construction patches (anywhere from 100 m to several hundred meters). We stopped once near a **BRO campsite with a large iron bridge**. Nepal is visible across the river at multiple points along this route.

We drove **4–5 hours** on rough terrain, giving the car short breaks every hour. One steep uphill patch with deep potholes made us get out and let only the driver handle it slowly — a good call, since we saw three cars turn back from there.

Locals weren’t exaggerating when they said **RWD/4WD is preferred**. If you’re taking your own car, it needs good ground clearance and very slow driving to avoid suspension or underbody damage.

We reached **Dantu around 4–4:30 PM**.

---

## Stay in Dantu (Mahesh Jung Homestay)

* **Cost:** ₹1000 per person (food included, probably negotiable)
* Amazing hospitality, unlimited food, very warm host

There’s **no electricity**, only solar-powered lights and phone charging for a few hours. No heaters or electric blankets — two blankets per person, but it still felt cold at night (probably due to lack of acclimatization).

Snowfall started around **5 PM** and continued for a couple of hours, leaving a thin layer everywhere. Evening was spent around a bonfire, chatting with other travellers. Many people were there just to drink/smoke, which honestly felt pointless in a place like this.

Sleep wasn’t great because of the cold.

---

## Trek (Zero Point)

* **Start:** 7:50 AM
* **Total time:** ~9 hours (around 11 km up & down)
* **Difficulty:** Easy for an average fit person
* Took the **right-side trail** (easier)
* Two friends took the snow trail from Dugtu and took **2+ hours longer**
* **No guide taken**

---

## Network, Power & Costs

* **Network:** None
* **Electricity:** None (only limited solar power)

**Expenses (per person, approx):**

* Total: **₹6500**
* Fuel: ₹9100 total
* Tolls: ₹1760
* Wheel alignment after trip: ₹700
* Biggest cost was diesel, followed by stays

  * Dharchula: ₹500 per person
  * Dantu: ₹1000 per person

No expense felt unnecessary.

---

## Warnings & Final Thoughts

* Not for **unfit people or those with breathing issues**
* Not a casual weekend trip
* If your goal is only drinking or smoking, please skip this
* We found plastic waste on the trail and carried it back — **please don’t litter**
* Roads are harsh; wheel alignment issues are likely
* Cold mornings + diesel engines = slow starts

This was a **raw, uncomfortable, and extremely rewarding** Himalayan trip. No network, no comforts, no shortcuts — but absolutely worth it if you’re prepared.

1qcu1zs,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1qcu1zs,50 days without smoking - honestly wasn't expecting this,"Hi guys, so I hit 50 days today and figured I'd share since this community helped me a lot in the beginning.

Started this because I was tired of feeling winded after walking up a flight of stairs and my gym routine was basically non-existent. Wasn't planning on any crazy transformation or anything, just wanted to stop smelling like an ashtray and feel less like garbage.

The first week was rough as expected – I was irritable, my focus was gone, and I kept reaching for my pocket for a lighter that wasn't there lol. But around day 12-13 I started noticing some weird stuff:

Breathing: I can actually take a deep breath without that weird ""crackle"" in my chest.
The Gym Thing: I actually wanted to go to the gym instead of making excuses. My cardio isn't amazing yet, but I'm not gasping for air after 5 minutes on the treadmill anymore.
Taste/Smell: Food tastes... aggressive? I didn't realize how much I had dulled my senses.
The Morning Cough: That gross ""smoker's cough"" I had every morning just... vanished.
The Money: I checked my banking app and realized I saved enough to buy a solid pair of new lifting shoes. I didn't realize how much I was literally burning away.
Still think about having a smoke sometimes, especially after a stressful meeting or when I'm out for a coffee. But it's not that desperate craving anymore, more like ""eh, maybe I would"" and then I remember how much better my lungs feel in the mornings now.

Anyone else notice the gym thing? Like I'm not suddenly an athlete or anything, but I actually show up consistently now instead of skipping because I feel ""heavy"" and lethargic.

Anyway, just wanted to share. This sub kept me going those first few weeks when I was questioning everything",14,1768412986.0,stopsmoking,2,1.0,False

1qcu1dj,https://www.reddit.com/r/AvoidantBreakUps/comments/1qcu1dj/discarded_after_7_years/,Discarded After 7 Years,"Struggling to make sense of anything right now. This is going to be pretty long. 

I (30F) had been with my partner (31M) for seven years. Throughout that time, we had infrequent but consistent clashes around a couple of issues, like conflict resolution styles and the fact that I was a pretty “safe” samey repetitive person and he liked novelty and spontaneity. I regularly checked in about the relationship and he always said he was happy, he loved me deeply, and we considered each other family.

From the beginning, I thought he was a safe, thoughtful, trauma-informed person. He had a background working in a social justice environment where trauma training was fairly in-depth and he later taught trauma courses at his new workplace. He was very patient and in tune with me as I’d previously been in an abusive relationship. It wasn’t one-sided, either—-he went through a major life crisis early in our relationship and I gladly supported him through the whole thing. Our sex life felt joyful and healing and fully humanizing, free of any pressure or objectification. We were truly best friends. We loved buying matching sweaters or tag-teaming video games. We would talk for hours, late into the night. We lived together the entire relationship and we still cuddled every night in bed and every morning when we woke up. We traveled all over the U.S. together and made planning one of our hobbies. I got him into national parks, he got me into theme parks. We spent Thanksgiving with his family and Christmas with mine every single  year. 

We were not married, but we had a very specific agreement, reiterated multiple times a year, that we were committed to each other as life partners and wanted to grow old together, and in order to make that as likely as possible, we specifically promised that we would never break up without first communicating discontent in a clear, direct manner, and both parties doing whatever possible (therapy, meds, couples counseling, changing communication patterns and behaviors, etc) to heal the relationship. We swore to NEVER blindside the other person because we were trusting each other to build a life—shared house, shared pet, coincidentally ended up working in the same building, financial commitments, and of course emotional and sexual vulnerability. This was the core agreement on which all my consent was predicated.

I have autism and ocd; he assured me he loved the way my mind worked. He had adhd and his own trauma history that sometimes manifested in explosive (nonviolent) paranoid outbursts and panic attacks where he’d briefly displace all his insecurity onto me and accuse me of attacking him, then later cry and apologize and tell me that he did not want to harm me. I always forgave easily, because I so understand trauma flashbacks and I did not feel physically unsafe around him. On the contrary, he was physically and verbally affectionate, we wrote each other poems, we spoke freely about our mutual admiration, we got a dog together, we played board games and video games, we went to events together, we both wrote an entire novel apiece during mornings at a local coffee shop.

This Christmas, we spent the day with my family as usual and exchanged gifts. A few days later, he was idly asking me how I wanted to celebrate my birthday in the spring. We’d agreed to visit his family in April and bundle it with a dream trip to a national park. The next day he seemed “off,” I pressed (assuming it was unrelated family stress or seasonal depression), he admitted he “wasn’t sure he loved me the same way I loved him any more” and said it was recent and he had wanted to work through it with his therapist without hurting me. He insisted he hadn’t decided anything yet and wanted to work with me. He promised to discuss it with me in two days after his therapy appointment. 

That day arrived, he went to therapy, he never came home or texted that evening. The next morning he found me in our shared bedroom, kissed me, told me he loved me, and gave me a letter explaining that he doesn’t want to be with me any more. He said he’d “only ever loved me in spite of things” and that he was “lying to himself when he made promises” and that “our traumas were too similar so  we would never be able to heal together” and ”it wasn’t about me, his brain had just crossed the wires and associated me with his childhood trauma” and “he didn’t regret anything and had truly loved me unconditionally until he didn’t” and “he had been thinking about getting a cat and being able to eat nuts again” (I’m allergic) and “he’d been cutting off parts of himself and throwing them in the fire” and “he thought I could just tell how unequal our relationship had become for him” and and “he was going to choose himself for once”—-plus a thousand more things. Just all over the place. When I sobbed and begged him not to do this, he was sympathetic but weirdly detached, like it was a relief to stop pretending to care about me. It was like getting dumped by a therapist. He offered me some money, agreed to keep paying rent even after leaving, and told me he’d made a list of people I should reach out to for my mental health. He was texting people telling them it was taking longer than expected to dump his partner of seven years with no warning. 

Now he’s going on a weird giant apology tour telling everyone he knows that we broke up and giving them insane amounts of detail about his tragic backstory. He’s acting really happy and fine at work while also driving from city to city staying with random people and telling me he was having violent nightmares every night in our bed together, up until he left. He sent my parents a four page letter extensively detailing his trauma as a justification for his abrupt discard. 

I recently found out he lied to my face all through December (and maybe longer)—that he’d actually been polishing the breakup letter and planned to deploy it in late January so he could “do it right” instead of discarding me around the holidays. Until then he was going to lie and manipulate so I would still believe he was happy and wanted to be with me. He keeps reiterating this obsessive thing about how he’s doing it right, doing things like contacting my parents and friends to ask them to be “on my side” and support me—it feels so incredibly patronizing and self-aggrandizing to me. This is a person who couldn’t keep a secret to save his LIFE. A man who would announce from the couch “I just found a cool sweater to buy for you!” and then “I don’t know why I told you that!”

To say I’m shattered is an understatement. My whole life is gone. My closest friend is unrecognizable. My home is no longer safe. My dog’s future is uncertain. He works at my workplace. I rebuilt my life from scratch after a domestic violence nightmare and now it’s all burned down by the person I trusted the most—and he genuinely thinks he did nothing wrong. He’s acting like I’m to blame for triggering his childhood trauma and he can’t ever feel safe with me, but the abandonment trauma he inflicted on me is an unfortunate necessity, a cosmic tragedy, and  he doesn’t owe me anything. But he is literally PAID to teach people about trauma so like……he knows! He knows this is something that legit gives people PTSD!  

Is this an avoidant discard? The last couple of weeks remind me SO much of the stories on this sub, but I keep second guessing. Seven years is a long time to keep up the facade, and we went through a lot of genuine challenges together where we always had each others backs. Car accident, physical therapy, family crises, a traumatic workplace experience, long term illness. But the person who coldly told me that he had “somewhere else to be” after dropping his bombshell letter is someone I don’t even recognize. I’m heavily medicated just to try to sleep for more than an hour a night, and when I sleep I have horrific, torturous nightmares or dreams where I’m talking to my normal love—and then I wake up. It feels like he made the conscious choice to gain relief from the trauma that was plaguing him by displacing all of it onto me so that I could be the one who was helpless and terrified and alone. Can anybody here help me make ANY sense of what is going on?

(P.S. - I’ve never opened ChatGPT in my life. Just a fan of the em dash!)

At the time I thought maybe it was just a stomach bug since one had recently run its way through my house. Unaware of the true situation/diagnosis, I was unkind to my very sick stomach (unbeknownst to me at the time) with food and drink choices. Things that hadn't ever caused me this type of problem ever. Sure, I went through a phase about 10 years ago of rough heartburn and indigestion, but it was quickly taken care of with PPI and hadn't been an issue since. Fast forward a couple of weeks after bland dieting, no trigger drinks like coffee or alcohol, etc. and I got to a point where I went from alternating form bad day to good day, to 3-4 good days in a row followed by a bad day.

Then, I had an **EGD on December 29th that revealed moderate chronic gastritis**. For the 2-3 weeks since, I have mostly alternated between bad days and good days. My **main symptoms** have been **nausea to the point of vomiting 2-4 days a week**, along with **globus/lump in my throat** feeling that just makes the nausea worse. I don't experience stomach pains/cramps or even burning in the stomach or chest. Just nausea. All the time nausea. It sucks.

  
**Question:** How do you all balance and manage food between bad days and good days? On my ""bad"" days, I barely eat. My nausea usually rears its ugly head in a not-so-fun way late afternoon/early evening and lingers and carries through the night and into the morning or it hits early morning into work hours and lingers until late workday or I get home around dinnertime. I can tell a day is going to be ""good"" almost immediately after I wake up because there's no residual or building nausea. Those days are rough because I am starving and want to eat all the food. I don't, but I eat more than I probably should. I still stop eating by 6 p.m. and go to bed around 9-10 p.m. after sitting upright for 2-4 hours after dinner; inevitably, though, I start feeling nausea later in the evening on a good day or overnight after a good day which takes me right into another bad day.

Am I just overeating on my good days? Or could it be that I'm just not eating enough and my stomach acids eventually revolt on what's a pretty empty stomach 50% of my life right now?

I'm so tired of feeling human, starving, lots of energy and pep one day only to be knocked back down to Earth and feel like shit the next day. I don't get how/why on my ""good days"" I can eat and not feel any residual immediate effects, but like clockwork, sometime between 4/5 p.m. and 8/9 p.m. I will feel the uncomfortable feeling in my throat sneak back and my stomach will start feeling queasy. Then, I'll spend the next 6-12 hours I'll vomit 1-2 times, feel nauseas the entire time, then avoid eating anything the next 4-6 hours after I come down from it because I don't want to hurt myself.

1qctybc,https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/1qctybc/my_new_job_monitoring_lucid_dreamers_has_one_very/,"My new job monitoring lucid dreamers has one, very strict rule. I think I’m starting to understand why.","Let me start from the beginning. Three months ago, I took a job as an overnight polysomnographic technologist—a sleep tech. It’s not as fancy as it sounds. I work for a private research firm, one of those places with a sleek, minimalist logo and big funding. The building is a sterile cube of glass and brushed steel tucked away in an anonymous corporate park. It’s the kind of place you could drive by a thousand times and never notice.

The job itself is, for the most part, incredibly simple. And it pays ridiculously well. That’s the combo that hooks you. I sit in a control room from 10 PM to 6 AM, surrounded by a semi-circle of monitors. The room is kept cold, the only light coming from the screens, which display a constant, hypnotic scroll of data: EEG, EOG, EMG. Brainwaves, eye movements, muscle tension. The vital signs of the six to eight individuals sleeping soundly in their private, hotel-like rooms down the hall.

Our subjects are all volunteers, paid handsomely to test a new piece of neuro-tech. It's a sleek, silver headband that they wear to sleep. The official line is that it uses targeted magnetic pulses and sonic frequencies to help induce and stabilize lucid dream states. The company wants to market it as the ultimate tool for creativity, for therapy, for personal exploration. Imagine being able to consciously navigate your own subconscious. The possibilities are endless.

My job is to be the lifeguard for these psychic swimmers. I watch their vitals. I monitor their brainwave patterns for the tell-tale signature of a lucid state—a specific blend of gamma and alpha wave activity. And most importantly, I watch for signs of distress. A spike in heart rate, rapid shallow breathing, excessive muscle twitching. If that happens, I have a button on my console that administers a mild, fast-acting sedative through their IV, waking them up gently and ending the session. Easy.

For the first two months, it was the easiest job I’d ever had. I’d spend most of my nights reading, listening to podcasts, or just watching the green lines cascade down the screens like a digital waterfall. It was peaceful. Boring, even.

But there was always this one thing. One weirdly specific, unyielding rule in the procedural handbook.

During a stable lucid state, we are required to perform a ""Consciousness Check-in."" We open a one-way comms link to the patient's room. A small speaker next to their bed, designed to be integrated into the dreamscape as a disembodied voice. The protocol is strict, a script we have to follow verbatim.

My voice, calm and neutral: ""This is the monitoring station. We have registered a stable lucid state. Can you hear me?""

The patient, who is dreaming, will almost always incorporate the voice and respond. Their own voice comes back through a highly sensitive microphone near their head, often whispery and distant.

""Yes... I can hear you.""

""Excellent. Please remain calm. This is part of the process. Can you describe what you are seeing in your dream?""

This is the key part. Their answers are usually fascinating. People describe flying over cities made of glass, talking to long-dead relatives, exploring alien worlds. It’s a surreal and often beautiful glimpse into the human mind. My job is to just take a few notes and let them continue.

But the handbook has a contingency. A single, bizarre, red-flag response.

If, in answer to that question, the patient says, **""I'm not dreaming. I'm standing above an ocean,""** the protocol is absolute.

I am not to ask any follow-up questions. I am not to engage further. I am to immediately press the red ""Session Termination"" button. This triggers a much stronger chemical sedative, not the gentle one, but one that slams the brakes on their consciousness and pulls them into a deep, dreamless sleep. After that, I am to scrub the audio log of the check-in, delete the specific brainwave data from that lucid period, and mark the session log with a simple, pre-written note: ""Patient experienced distress-induced paradoxical lucidity. Session terminated per protocol 4.11a.""

The first time I saw it, I was just browsing old logs on a slow night. A patient from three weeks before I started. There it was. The question. The answer: *""I'm not dreaming. I'm standing above an ocean.""* Then the log entry: *""Sedated due to distress.""* Followed by the official note.

I figured it was a one-off. Some weird, specific neurological glitch the device could cause. Maybe it triggered a primal fear, a thalassophobia encoded in our DNA. The brain, in its dream-state, interprets this specific signal as a real, terrifying void, and the company just wanted to shut it down before it caused any psychological damage. It made a kind of clinical sense.

But then I saw it again. A log from a month ago. Then two more from the last couple of weeks. Always the same. The question. The exact same answer, word for word. The termination. The scrubbed data. The canned explanation.

I asked my supervisor about it once, a senior tech who’d been here since the project started. I tried to be casual. ""Hey, I was looking at some old logs, saw a few 4.11a terminations. That 'ocean' thing is pretty weird, huh?""

He didn't even look up from his tablet. ""It's a known system artifact. A recursive feedback loop that can create a specific, undesirable hypnotic state. The protocol is for patient safety. Don't worry about it. Just follow the procedure.""

His answer was too clean, too rehearsed. It was the kind of answer designed to stop you from asking more questions. So I stopped. I did my job. I watched the green lines, and I hoped I'd never have to personally deal with Protocol 4.11a.

Until last night.

The shift started normally. Six subjects, all hooked up and sleeping by 11 PM. The first few hours were quiet. I was halfway through a book when, around 2:15 AM, the monitor for Room 4 lit up. A beautiful, clean lucid signature. The patient was a man in his late 40s, a first-timer. The system flagged him as ready for check-in.

I took a sip of cold coffee, leaned into my microphone, and cleared my throat. The script felt second nature by now.

""This is the monitoring station. We have registered a stable lucid state. Can you hear me?""

A few seconds of silence. Then, a faint, breathy voice trickled through my headset. ""Yes... wow. Yes, I can hear you.""

""Excellent. Please remain calm. This is part of the process. Can you describe what you are seeing in your dream?""

I had my pen ready, my notepad open. I was expecting a description of some fantastical landscape. Instead, the silence stretched. I could hear his soft breathing. His heart rate, steady on the monitor, began to climb just a little.

Then his voice came, and it was different. Clearer. Sharper. Not a dreamy whisper, but a tone of profound, unnerving certainty.

""I'm not dreaming. I'm standing above an ocean.""

A block of ice formed in my stomach. My hand went straight for the console, fingers hovering over the red Session Termination button. This was it. My first 4.11a. I was about to press it. To end it, scrub the log, and spend the rest of the night trying to forget the chilling clarity in his voice.

I pressed the button.

A small, high-pitched beep echoed in the control room. On my main monitor, a text box popped up. I'd never seen it before.

`ERROR 7: SEDATIVE DISPERSAL UNIT - PUMP MALFUNCTION (R4). MANUAL OVERRIDE REQUIRED.`

My blood went cold. Manual override meant calling the on-call nurse, who was asleep in her office at the other end of the building. That would take at least five minutes. Five minutes was an eternity. The handbook had a contingency for this, too, buried deep in the appendices: ""In the event of a dispersal failure, the monitoring agent must maintain vocal contact with the subject, keeping them calm and oriented until medical staff can intervene. Do not terminate the audio link.""

I was stuck. I had to keep talking to him. My heart was hammering against my ribs.

""Okay,"" I said, my voice shakier than I wanted. ""Okay, just… just stay calm. Can you describe this ocean for me?"" I was off-script now, flying blind.

His voice came back, filled with a strange, detached wonder. ""It's… endless. There's no sun, no moon, no stars. But it's not dark. There's a soft, grey light coming from nowhere and everywhere at once. The sky is the same color as the water. I can't tell where one ends and the other begins.""

""Are you in the water? Are you on a boat?"" I asked, trying to ground the scenario in something tangible.

""No. I'm just… standing. On the surface. The water is perfectly still. Like black glass. But I'm not on it. I'm above it. Maybe ten feet up. Just… hanging here. In the quiet.""

I watched his vitals. His heart rate was elevated but steady. His breathing was slow and regular. According to the data, he wasn't in distress. He was perfectly calm. But the rulebook, the protocol, the senior tech's warning—they all screamed that this was wrong. This was dangerous.

""Can you see anything else?"" I asked, my voice barely a whisper. ""Land? Any other people?""

""No. Nothing. It's just the ocean. The grey sky. Me. It goes on forever in every direction. It’s the most empty, and the most peaceful place I’ve ever been."" He paused. ""Wait.""

My knuckles were white where I gripped the edge of my desk. ""What is it? What do you see?""

""There's something down there,"" he said. His voice lost its peaceful quality, replaced by a thread of curiosity. ""Under me. Deep down.""

""How deep?""

""I don't know. Miles, maybe. It's just a shape. A darkness in the black water. It's hard to make out.""

I was leaning forward, my face inches from the screen, watching the delicate green lines of his EEG. They were fluctuating, a new pattern I didn't recognize emerging.

""Is it moving?"" I asked.

""Yes,"" he whispered. ""It's… it’s rising. It's coming up towards me.""

His heart rate began to climb. 80 bpm. 85. 90.

""Okay, I need you to stay calm,"" I said, my own voice betraying my panic. ""It's just a dream. You are in control.""

""I told you, I'm not dreaming,"" he insisted, his voice tight. ""It's getting closer. It's… big. So big. The shape is wrong. It's… oh god, it has… tentacles. Long, slow, coiling things stretching out from a central mass. It’s enormous, it has to be the size of a mountain.""

His breathing hitched. The EMG monitor showed his muscles were tensing. He was starting to panic. The nurse still wasn’t answering my page.

""What's it doing?"" I pressed, feeling a morbid, terrifying need to know.

""It's just coming up. So slowly. The darkness… it’s so black. A perfect, light-swallowing black. But… wait a second. Something’s changing.""

""Changing how?""

""As it gets closer to the surface, it… it’s getting smaller. Or, it's… contracting? It's pulling itself in. The tentacles are retracting, melting back into the main body. The shape is… simplifying. It's not a mountain anymore. It's… becoming smoother. More… defined.""

His heart rate steadied. The panic in his voice subsided, replaced again by that unnerving wonder.

""It’s almost here,"" he breathed. ""It's right below the surface now. I can see it through the water. It’s not a monster anymore. It's… it's a person.""

I felt a wave of nausea. ""A person?""

""Yes. It's a man. He's just floating there, right under the surface, looking up at me. He’s perfectly still. The water is like a sheet of glass between us."" A long pause. My own breathing sounded like a hurricane in my ears. Then he said, ""He's waving at me.""

""Waving?""

""Yes. A slow wave. With one hand. Like he’s saying hello. Or… goodbye."" He fell silent for a moment. I could hear a faint, confused sound from him. ""That's… strange.""

""What is?"" I asked, my throat dry. ""What's strange?""

""I know him,"" the patient said, his voice a knot of confusion and disbelief. ""I recognize his face. He looks… he looks just like the man from Room 7 last week.""

The world stopped.

I didn't know what he was talking about. Patients aren't supposed to see each other. They're checked in and out at staggered times to ensure privacy. But I knew exactly who he meant. The last 4.11a I'd seen in the logs. The one from last week. The patient in Room 7.

Just then, the door to the control room hissed open. The nurse, a stern older woman, stood there, syringe in hand. ""My pager was on silent,"" she grumbled. ""What's the problem?""

I just pointed at the monitor for Room 4, unable to speak. She glanced at his vitals, saw the distress flags, and marched out toward his room without another word. A few minutes later, his brainwave patterns smoothed out, his heart rate dropped, and the monitor showed he was in a deep, sedated sleep. The incident was over.

But for me, it had just begun.

After the nurse left and the morning tech came in to relieve me, I couldn't go home. I couldn't sleep. The patient’s words echoed in my head. *He looks just like the man from Room 7.*

I sat in my car in the pre-dawn gloom of the parking lot, my mind racing. How could he have seen the man from Room 7? It was impossible.

My hands trembling, I pulled my work laptop from my bag. My credentials were still active. I pulled up the session log for the patient in Room 7 from last week. There it was. The check-in. The ""ocean"" response. The note: ""Patient experienced distress-induced paradoxical lucidity. Session terminated per protocol 4.11a."" Standard procedure. But then I looked at his discharge notes. ""Subject experienced a severe psychotic break during Stage 4 sleep. Transferred for psychiatric evaluation.""

A psychotic break. That was new. That wasn't in the other logs.

A cold dread trickled down my spine. On a hunch, I opened a private browser window and typed his name—a real name, from his intake form—into a search engine.

The first result was a local news article, dated two days ago. *Police Ask for Public's Help in Locating Missing Man.*

I felt like I was going to be sick.

The next day, I went into work early, determined to talk to The doctor, the head of the research division. He was a tall, severe man with cold eyes and an immaculate lab coat. I found him in his office, reviewing data.

I laid it all out for him. The system failure. The conversation with the patient from Room 4. His description of the rising creature. The face he saw. The fact that the patient from Room 7 was now a missing person.

The doctor listened patiently, his hands steepled on his desk. He didn't interrupt me once. When I finished, the silence in the room was heavy and suffocating.

""You understand,"" he said finally, his voice flat and devoid of emotion, ""that our subjects are under extreme neurological stimulation. The device pushes the boundaries of perception. Hallucinations, both waking and sleeping, are a known, if rare, side effect. The patient in Room 7 had a pre-existing vulnerability we missed in screening. His psychotic break was unfortunate, but statistically predictable. His subsequent disappearance is a matter for the police, not for us.""

""But what about the other patient?"" I insisted. ""The one from last night. How could he have described the man from Room 7's face? He never saw him.""

""Coincidence,"" The doctor said, his tone dismissive. ""The human brain is a pattern-recognition machine. He saw a face in his dream. His subconscious assigned a vague, fleeting memory to it. You are connecting unrelated events, a classic case of confirmation bias. The failure of the sedative pump is a maintenance issue. I’ll have it looked at. Thank you for your report. You may go.""

He turned back to his monitor. I was dismissed.

But I couldn't let it go. He was lying. Or, if he wasn't lying, he was willfully blind. Coincidence? No. The clarity in the patient's voice, the specific detail… it wasn't a coincidence.

That night, on my shift, I did something I could be fired—or even prosecuted—for. I used the senior tech’s password, which I’d seen him type in a hundred times, to access the system’s deep-level diagnostic and calibration logs. I wasn't even sure what I was looking for. A program file? A weird subroutine?

It took me hours, digging through endless folders of code and encrypted data. And then I found it. A hidden sub-directory in the initial calibration sequence, the one that runs for five minutes while the patient is first falling asleep. The folder was labeled ""F.F. Integration.""

Inside was a single, innocuous-looking subroutine. Its description read: ""Injects familiarization marker to ease transition into lucid state. Presents a calming, 'friendly face' subliminally to reduce psychic tension.""

My blood ran cold. There was a log file attached to the subroutine. A list of image files, dates, and patient ID numbers.

I clicked on the log entry for the patient from last night, the man in Room 4. The calibration sequence had run at 10:48 PM. And at 10:49 PM, it had flashed a single image file for 150 milliseconds—just below the threshold of conscious perception. The image file was a low-resolution capture. The system automatically takes a still from the in-room camera at the moment of peak lucidity, for ""data-tagging purposes.""

The image file injected into the brain of the man in Room 4 was the data-tagging still from the patient in Room 7.

My hands were shaking so hard I could barely use the mouse. I scrolled up the log. The patient from Room 7, the week before… his calibration sequence had included a subliminal image of the ""ocean"" patient before him. And the one before him, an image of the one before that.

It was a chain.

Each new subject saw a flash of the last person who had been in the same state before, like they were connected somehow

I had to know more. I pulled up the file for the missing man from Room 7 again. His home address was listed on the intake form. It was in a sprawling, anonymous apartment complex on the other side of town.

My shift ended at six. I didn’t go home. I drove straight there. The sun was just starting to rise, painting the sky in sick shades of orange and purple.

His apartment was on the third floor. I picked the lock with a credit card, a skill I'd picked up in a misspent youth. The air inside was still and stale. The place was neat, almost sterile. It looked like no one had lived there for years, not days. A couch, a coffee table, a television. Nothing personal. No photos, no clutter.

I searched the whole apartment. Nothing. I was about to give up when I checked the nightstand next to the bed. Under a book, there was a small, black Moleskine journal.

I opened it. Most of it was mundane. Work notes, grocery lists. But the entries for the last week were different. The handwriting started to get messy, frantic. He wrote about the sleep study, how excited he was. Then he wrote about his first session.

*The dream was incredible. I flew. I actually flew. But then there was this… check-in. A voice. It asked me what I was seeing.*

The next entry was a few days later, the night before his final session.

*Can't sleep. Every time I close my eyes, I see it. The grey light. The black glass water. I feel like I'm standing on the edge of nothing. I’m scheduled for another session tomorrow night. They said it would help. I told them about the dream, and they just smiled and made a note.*

Then, the last entry. It looked like it had been scrawled in the middle of the night, right before he disappeared. The pen had dug into the paper.

*They don't understand. I went back tonight. I had to. I was standing there again, above the ocean. It was waiting for me. It came up from the deep, just like before. So huge and horrible. And then it became small, it became him. The face from the picture they showed me. The man from before. He was there, under the water. He looked so scared. He waved at me, I touched the waters with my hand for the first time, and then, only then I saw glimpses of his mind, words he wants to tell me, images he wants me to see and I finally understood.*

I read the final lines, and the air in my lungs turned to ice. My vision swam.

*He’s not waving goodbye. He needs my help. He’s trapped in there, just like the one before him, all asked for help, all tried to break through the boundaries of dream, and that thing... the thing they put us in, make us dream. I think it feed our consciousness to something. One by one, and that poor man he’s being digested by that… that emptiness. And he’s begging me to help him before he’s gone forever. I have to go back. I have to save him.*

As I stood there in the dead man's silent apartment, reading his last, insane, terrifying words, my own phone buzzed in my pocket. The sound was so loud in the quiet room it made me jump.

I pulled it out, my thumb shaking as I unlocked the screen.

It was a calendar alert. An automatic notification from the corporate scheduling system.

It read: **Mandatory Employee Device Trial Session. Subject: [My Name]. Tomorrow. 10 PM.**",3,1768412765.0,nosleep,1,0.8,False

1qctxwt,https://www.reddit.com/r/stories/comments/1qctxwt/my_new_job_monitoring_lucid_dreamers_has_one_very/,"My new job monitoring lucid dreamers has one, very strict rule. I think I’m starting to understand why.","Let me start from the beginning. Three months ago, I took a job as an overnight polysomnographic technologist—a sleep tech. It’s not as fancy as it sounds. I work for a private research firm, one of those places with a sleek, minimalist logo and big funding. The building is a sterile cube of glass and brushed steel tucked away in an anonymous corporate park. It’s the kind of place you could drive by a thousand times and never notice.

The job itself is, for the most part, incredibly simple. And it pays ridiculously well. That’s the combo that hooks you. I sit in a control room from 10 PM to 6 AM, surrounded by a semi-circle of monitors. The room is kept cold, the only light coming from the screens, which display a constant, hypnotic scroll of data: EEG, EOG, EMG. Brainwaves, eye movements, muscle tension. The vital signs of the six to eight individuals sleeping soundly in their private, hotel-like rooms down the hall.

Our subjects are all volunteers, paid handsomely to test a new piece of neuro-tech. It's a sleek, silver headband that they wear to sleep. The official line is that it uses targeted magnetic pulses and sonic frequencies to help induce and stabilize lucid dream states. The company wants to market it as the ultimate tool for creativity, for therapy, for personal exploration. Imagine being able to consciously navigate your own subconscious. The possibilities are endless.

My job is to be the lifeguard for these psychic swimmers. I watch their vitals. I monitor their brainwave patterns for the tell-tale signature of a lucid state—a specific blend of gamma and alpha wave activity. And most importantly, I watch for signs of distress. A spike in heart rate, rapid shallow breathing, excessive muscle twitching. If that happens, I have a button on my console that administers a mild, fast-acting sedative through their IV, waking them up gently and ending the session. Easy.

For the first two months, it was the easiest job I’d ever had. I’d spend most of my nights reading, listening to podcasts, or just watching the green lines cascade down the screens like a digital waterfall. It was peaceful. Boring, even.

But there was always this one thing. One weirdly specific, unyielding rule in the procedural handbook.

During a stable lucid state, we are required to perform a ""Consciousness Check-in."" We open a one-way comms link to the patient's room. A small speaker next to their bed, designed to be integrated into the dreamscape as a disembodied voice. The protocol is strict, a script we have to follow verbatim.

My voice, calm and neutral: ""This is the monitoring station. We have registered a stable lucid state. Can you hear me?""

The patient, who is dreaming, will almost always incorporate the voice and respond. Their own voice comes back through a highly sensitive microphone near their head, often whispery and distant.

""Yes... I can hear you.""

""Excellent. Please remain calm. This is part of the process. Can you describe what you are seeing in your dream?""

This is the key part. Their answers are usually fascinating. People describe flying over cities made of glass, talking to long-dead relatives, exploring alien worlds. It’s a surreal and often beautiful glimpse into the human mind. My job is to just take a few notes and let them continue.

But the handbook has a contingency. A single, bizarre, red-flag response.

If, in answer to that question, the patient says, **""I'm not dreaming. I'm standing above an ocean,""** the protocol is absolute.

I am not to ask any follow-up questions. I am not to engage further. I am to immediately press the red ""Session Termination"" button. This triggers a much stronger chemical sedative, not the gentle one, but one that slams the brakes on their consciousness and pulls them into a deep, dreamless sleep. After that, I am to scrub the audio log of the check-in, delete the specific brainwave data from that lucid period, and mark the session log with a simple, pre-written note: ""Patient experienced distress-induced paradoxical lucidity. Session terminated per protocol 4.11a.""

The first time I saw it, I was just browsing old logs on a slow night. A patient from three weeks before I started. There it was. The question. The answer: *""I'm not dreaming. I'm standing above an ocean.""* Then the log entry: *""Sedated due to distress.""* Followed by the official note.

I figured it was a one-off. Some weird, specific neurological glitch the device could cause. Maybe it triggered a primal fear, a thalassophobia encoded in our DNA. The brain, in its dream-state, interprets this specific signal as a real, terrifying void, and the company just wanted to shut it down before it caused any psychological damage. It made a kind of clinical sense.

But then I saw it again. A log from a month ago. Then two more from the last couple of weeks. Always the same. The question. The exact same answer, word for word. The termination. The scrubbed data. The canned explanation.

I asked my supervisor about it once, a senior tech who’d been here since the project started. I tried to be casual. ""Hey, I was looking at some old logs, saw a few 4.11a terminations. That 'ocean' thing is pretty weird, huh?""

He didn't even look up from his tablet. ""It's a known system artifact. A recursive feedback loop that can create a specific, undesirable hypnotic state. The protocol is for patient safety. Don't worry about it. Just follow the procedure.""

His answer was too clean, too rehearsed. It was the kind of answer designed to stop you from asking more questions. So I stopped. I did my job. I watched the green lines, and I hoped I'd never have to personally deal with Protocol 4.11a.

Until last night.

The shift started normally. Six subjects, all hooked up and sleeping by 11 PM. The first few hours were quiet. I was halfway through a book when, around 2:15 AM, the monitor for Room 4 lit up. A beautiful, clean lucid signature. The patient was a man in his late 40s, a first-timer. The system flagged him as ready for check-in.

I took a sip of cold coffee, leaned into my microphone, and cleared my throat. The script felt second nature by now.

""This is the monitoring station. We have registered a stable lucid state. Can you hear me?""

A few seconds of silence. Then, a faint, breathy voice trickled through my headset. ""Yes... wow. Yes, I can hear you.""

""Excellent. Please remain calm. This is part of the process. Can you describe what you are seeing in your dream?""

I had my pen ready, my notepad open. I was expecting a description of some fantastical landscape. Instead, the silence stretched. I could hear his soft breathing. His heart rate, steady on the monitor, began to climb just a little.

Then his voice came, and it was different. Clearer. Sharper. Not a dreamy whisper, but a tone of profound, unnerving certainty.

""I'm not dreaming. I'm standing above an ocean.""

A block of ice formed in my stomach. My hand went straight for the console, fingers hovering over the red Session Termination button. This was it. My first 4.11a. I was about to press it. To end it, scrub the log, and spend the rest of the night trying to forget the chilling clarity in his voice.

I pressed the button.

A small, high-pitched beep echoed in the control room. On my main monitor, a text box popped up. I'd never seen it before.

`ERROR 7: SEDATIVE DISPERSAL UNIT - PUMP MALFUNCTION (R4). MANUAL OVERRIDE REQUIRED.`

The system automatically takes a still from the in-room camera at the moment of peak lucidity, for ""data-tagging purposes.""

The image file injected into the brain of the man in Room 4 was the data-tagging still from the patient in Room 7.

My hands were shaking so hard I could barely use the mouse. I scrolled up the log. The patient from Room 7, the week before… his calibration sequence had included a subliminal image of the ""ocean"" patient before him. And the one before him, an image of the one before that.

It was a chain.

Each new subject saw a flash of the last person who had been in the same state before, like they were connected somehow

I had to know more. I pulled up the file for the missing man from Room 7 again. His home address was listed on the intake form. It was in a sprawling, anonymous apartment complex on the other side of town.

My shift ended at six. I didn’t go home. I drove straight there. The sun was just starting to rise, painting the sky in sick shades of orange and purple.

His apartment was on the third floor. I picked the lock with a credit card, a skill I'd picked up in a misspent youth. The air inside was still and stale. The place was neat, almost sterile. It looked like no one had lived there for years, not days. A couch, a coffee table, a television. Nothing personal. No photos, no clutter.

I searched the whole apartment. Nothing. I was about to give up when I checked the nightstand next to the bed. Under a book, there was a small, black Moleskine journal.

I opened it. Most of it was mundane. Work notes, grocery lists. But the entries for the last week were different. The handwriting started to get messy, frantic. He wrote about the sleep study, how excited he was. Then he wrote about his first session.

*The dream was incredible. I flew. I actually flew. But then there was this… check-in. A voice. It asked me what I was seeing.*

The next entry was a few days later, the night before his final session.

*Can't sleep. Every time I close my eyes, I see it. The grey light. The black glass water. I feel like I'm standing on the edge of nothing. I’m scheduled for another session tomorrow night. They said it would help. I told them about the dream, and they just smiled and made a note.*

Then, the last entry. It looked like it had been scrawled in the middle of the night, right before he disappeared. The pen had dug into the paper.

*They don't understand. I went back tonight. I had to. I was standing there again, above the ocean. It was waiting for me. It came up from the deep, just like before. So huge and horrible. And then it became small, it became him. The face from the picture they showed me. The man from before. He was there, under the water. He looked so scared. He waved at me, I touched the waters with my hand for the first time, and then, only then I saw glimpses of his mind, words he wants to tell me, images he wants me to see and I finally understood.*

I read the final lines, and the air in my lungs turned to ice. My vision swam.

*He’s not waving goodbye. He needs my help. He’s trapped in there, just like the one before him, all asked for help, all tried to break through the boundaries of dream, and that thing... the thing they put us in, make us dream. I think it feed our consciousness to something. One by one, and that poor man he’s being digested by that… that emptiness. And he’s begging me to help him before he’s gone forever. I have to go back. I have to save him.*

As I stood there in the dead man's silent apartment, reading his last, insane, terrifying words, my own phone buzzed in my pocket. The sound was so loud in the quiet room it made me jump.

I pulled it out, my thumb shaking as I unlocked the screen.

It was a calendar alert. An automatic notification from the corporate scheduling system.

1qctx8q,https://www.reddit.com/r/creepypasta/comments/1qctx8q/my_new_job_monitoring_lucid_dreamers_has_one_very/,"My new job monitoring lucid dreamers has one, very strict rule. I think I’m starting to understand why.","Let me start from the beginning. Three months ago, I took a job as an overnight polysomnographic technologist—a sleep tech. It’s not as fancy as it sounds. I work for a private research firm, one of those places with a sleek, minimalist logo and big funding. The building is a sterile cube of glass and brushed steel tucked away in an anonymous corporate park. It’s the kind of place you could drive by a thousand times and never notice.

The job itself is, for the most part, incredibly simple. And it pays ridiculously well. That’s the combo that hooks you. I sit in a control room from 10 PM to 6 AM, surrounded by a semi-circle of monitors. The room is kept cold, the only light coming from the screens, which display a constant, hypnotic scroll of data: EEG, EOG, EMG. Brainwaves, eye movements, muscle tension. The vital signs of the six to eight individuals sleeping soundly in their private, hotel-like rooms down the hall.

Our subjects are all volunteers, paid handsomely to test a new piece of neuro-tech. It's a sleek, silver headband that they wear to sleep. The official line is that it uses targeted magnetic pulses and sonic frequencies to help induce and stabilize lucid dream states. The company wants to market it as the ultimate tool for creativity, for therapy, for personal exploration. Imagine being able to consciously navigate your own subconscious. The possibilities are endless.

My job is to be the lifeguard for these psychic swimmers. I watch their vitals. I monitor their brainwave patterns for the tell-tale signature of a lucid state—a specific blend of gamma and alpha wave activity. And most importantly, I watch for signs of distress. A spike in heart rate, rapid shallow breathing, excessive muscle twitching. If that happens, I have a button on my console that administers a mild, fast-acting sedative through their IV, waking them up gently and ending the session. Easy.

For the first two months, it was the easiest job I’d ever had. I’d spend most of my nights reading, listening to podcasts, or just watching the green lines cascade down the screens like a digital waterfall. It was peaceful. Boring, even.

But there was always this one thing. One weirdly specific, unyielding rule in the procedural handbook.

During a stable lucid state, we are required to perform a ""Consciousness Check-in."" We open a one-way comms link to the patient's room. A small speaker next to their bed, designed to be integrated into the dreamscape as a disembodied voice. The protocol is strict, a script we have to follow verbatim.

My voice, calm and neutral: ""This is the monitoring station. We have registered a stable lucid state. Can you hear me?""

The patient, who is dreaming, will almost always incorporate the voice and respond. Their own voice comes back through a highly sensitive microphone near their head, often whispery and distant.

""Yes... I can hear you.""

""Excellent. Please remain calm. This is part of the process. Can you describe what you are seeing in your dream?""

This is the key part. Their answers are usually fascinating. People describe flying over cities made of glass, talking to long-dead relatives, exploring alien worlds. It’s a surreal and often beautiful glimpse into the human mind. My job is to just take a few notes and let them continue.

But the handbook has a contingency. A single, bizarre, red-flag response.

If, in answer to that question, the patient says, **""I'm not dreaming. I'm standing above an ocean,""** the protocol is absolute.

I am not to ask any follow-up questions. I am not to engage further. I am to immediately press the red ""Session Termination"" button. This triggers a much stronger chemical sedative, not the gentle one, but one that slams the brakes on their consciousness and pulls them into a deep, dreamless sleep. After that, I am to scrub the audio log of the check-in, delete the specific brainwave data from that lucid period, and mark the session log with a simple, pre-written note: ""Patient experienced distress-induced paradoxical lucidity. Session terminated per protocol 4.11a.""

The first time I saw it, I was just browsing old logs on a slow night. A patient from three weeks before I started. There it was. The question. The answer: *""I'm not dreaming. I'm standing above an ocean.""* Then the log entry: *""Sedated due to distress.""* Followed by the official note.

I figured it was a one-off. Some weird, specific neurological glitch the device could cause. Maybe it triggered a primal fear, a thalassophobia encoded in our DNA. The brain, in its dream-state, interprets this specific signal as a real, terrifying void, and the company just wanted to shut it down before it caused any psychological damage. It made a kind of clinical sense.

But then I saw it again. A log from a month ago. Then two more from the last couple of weeks. Always the same. The question. The exact same answer, word for word. The termination. The scrubbed data. The canned explanation.

I asked my supervisor about it once, a senior tech who’d been here since the project started. I tried to be casual. ""Hey, I was looking at some old logs, saw a few 4.11a terminations. That 'ocean' thing is pretty weird, huh?""

He didn't even look up from his tablet. ""It's a known system artifact. A recursive feedback loop that can create a specific, undesirable hypnotic state. The protocol is for patient safety. Don't worry about it. Just follow the procedure.""

His answer was too clean, too rehearsed. It was the kind of answer designed to stop you from asking more questions. So I stopped. I did my job. I watched the green lines, and I hoped I'd never have to personally deal with Protocol 4.11a.

Until last night.

The shift started normally. Six subjects, all hooked up and sleeping by 11 PM. The first few hours were quiet. I was halfway through a book when, around 2:15 AM, the monitor for Room 4 lit up. A beautiful, clean lucid signature. The patient was a man in his late 40s, a first-timer. The system flagged him as ready for check-in.

I took a sip of cold coffee, leaned into my microphone, and cleared my throat. The script felt second nature by now.

""This is the monitoring station. We have registered a stable lucid state. Can you hear me?""

A few seconds of silence. Then, a faint, breathy voice trickled through my headset. ""Yes... wow. Yes, I can hear you.""

""Excellent. Please remain calm. This is part of the process. Can you describe what you are seeing in your dream?""

I had my pen ready, my notepad open. I was expecting a description of some fantastical landscape. Instead, the silence stretched. I could hear his soft breathing. His heart rate, steady on the monitor, began to climb just a little.

Then his voice came, and it was different. Clearer. Sharper. Not a dreamy whisper, but a tone of profound, unnerving certainty.

""I'm not dreaming. I'm standing above an ocean.""

A block of ice formed in my stomach. My hand went straight for the console, fingers hovering over the red Session Termination button. This was it. My first 4.11a. I was about to press it. To end it, scrub the log, and spend the rest of the night trying to forget the chilling clarity in his voice.

I pressed the button.

A small, high-pitched beep echoed in the control room. On my main monitor, a text box popped up. I'd never seen it before.

`ERROR 7: SEDATIVE DISPERSAL UNIT - PUMP MALFUNCTION (R4). MANUAL OVERRIDE REQUIRED.`

My blood went cold. Manual override meant calling the on-call nurse, who was asleep in her office at the other end of the building. That would take at least five minutes. Five minutes was an eternity. The handbook had a contingency for this, too, buried deep in the appendices: ""In the event of a dispersal failure, the monitoring agent must maintain vocal contact with the subject, keeping them calm and oriented until medical staff can intervene. Do not terminate the audio link.""

I was stuck. I had to keep talking to him. My heart was hammering against my ribs.

""Okay,"" I said, my voice shakier than I wanted. ""Okay, just… just stay calm. Can you describe this ocean for me?"" I was off-script now, flying blind.

His voice came back, filled with a strange, detached wonder. ""It's… endless. There's no sun, no moon, no stars. But it's not dark. There's a soft, grey light coming from nowhere and everywhere at once. The sky is the same color as the water. I can't tell where one ends and the other begins.""

""Are you in the water? Are you on a boat?"" I asked, trying to ground the scenario in something tangible.

""No. I'm just… standing. On the surface. The water is perfectly still. Like black glass. But I'm not on it. I'm above it. Maybe ten feet up. Just… hanging here. In the quiet.""

I watched his vitals. His heart rate was elevated but steady. His breathing was slow and regular. According to the data, he wasn't in distress. He was perfectly calm. But the rulebook, the protocol, the senior tech's warning—they all screamed that this was wrong. This was dangerous.

""Can you see anything else?"" I asked, my voice barely a whisper. ""Land? Any other people?""

""No. Nothing. It's just the ocean. The grey sky. Me. It goes on forever in every direction. It’s the most empty, and the most peaceful place I’ve ever been."" He paused. ""Wait.""

My knuckles were white where I gripped the edge of my desk. ""What is it? What do you see?""

""There's something down there,"" he said. His voice lost its peaceful quality, replaced by a thread of curiosity. ""Under me. Deep down.""

""How deep?""

""I don't know. Miles, maybe. It's just a shape. A darkness in the black water. It's hard to make out.""

I was leaning forward, my face inches from the screen, watching the delicate green lines of his EEG. They were fluctuating, a new pattern I didn't recognize emerging.

""Is it moving?"" I asked.

""Yes,"" he whispered. ""It's… it’s rising. It's coming up towards me.""

His heart rate began to climb. 80 bpm. 85. 90.

""Okay, I need you to stay calm,"" I said, my own voice betraying my panic. ""It's just a dream. You are in control.""

""I told you, I'm not dreaming,"" he insisted, his voice tight. ""It's getting closer. It's… big. So big. The shape is wrong. It's… oh god, it has… tentacles. Long, slow, coiling things stretching out from a central mass. It’s enormous, it has to be the size of a mountain.""

His breathing hitched. The EMG monitor showed his muscles were tensing. He was starting to panic. The nurse still wasn’t answering my page.

""What's it doing?"" I pressed, feeling a morbid, terrifying need to know.

""It's just coming up. So slowly. The darkness… it’s so black. A perfect, light-swallowing black. But… wait a second. Something’s changing.""

""Changing how?""

""As it gets closer to the surface, it… it’s getting smaller. Or, it's… contracting? It's pulling itself in. The tentacles are retracting, melting back into the main body. The shape is… simplifying. It's not a mountain anymore. It's… becoming smoother. More… defined.""

His heart rate steadied. The panic in his voice subsided, replaced again by that unnerving wonder.

""It’s almost here,"" he breathed. ""It's right below the surface now. I can see it through the water. It’s not a monster anymore. It's… it's a person.""

I felt a wave of nausea. ""A person?""

""Yes. It's a man. He's just floating there, right under the surface, looking up at me. He’s perfectly still. The water is like a sheet of glass between us."" A long pause. My own breathing sounded like a hurricane in my ears. Then he said, ""He's waving at me.""

""Waving?""

""Yes. A slow wave. With one hand. Like he’s saying hello. Or… goodbye."" He fell silent for a moment. I could hear a faint, confused sound from him. ""That's… strange.""

""What is?"" I asked, my throat dry. ""What's strange?""

""I know him,"" the patient said, his voice a knot of confusion and disbelief. ""I recognize his face. He looks… he looks just like the man from Room 7 last week.""

The world stopped.

I didn't know what he was talking about. Patients aren't supposed to see each other. They're checked in and out at staggered times to ensure privacy. But I knew exactly who he meant. The last 4.11a I'd seen in the logs. The one from last week. The patient in Room 7.

Just then, the door to the control room hissed open. The nurse, a stern older woman, stood there, syringe in hand. ""My pager was on silent,"" she grumbled. ""What's the problem?""

I just pointed at the monitor for Room 4, unable to speak. She glanced at his vitals, saw the distress flags, and marched out toward his room without another word. A few minutes later, his brainwave patterns smoothed out, his heart rate dropped, and the monitor showed he was in a deep, sedated sleep. The incident was over.

But for me, it had just begun.

After the nurse left and the morning tech came in to relieve me, I couldn't go home. I couldn't sleep. The patient’s words echoed in my head. *He looks just like the man from Room 7.*

I sat in my car in the pre-dawn gloom of the parking lot, my mind racing. How could he have seen the man from Room 7? It was impossible.

My hands trembling, I pulled my work laptop from my bag. My credentials were still active. I pulled up the session log for the patient in Room 7 from last week. There it was. The check-in. The ""ocean"" response. The note: ""Patient experienced distress-induced paradoxical lucidity. Session terminated per protocol 4.11a."" Standard procedure. But then I looked at his discharge notes. ""Subject experienced a severe psychotic break during Stage 4 sleep. Transferred for psychiatric evaluation.""

A psychotic break. That was new. That wasn't in the other logs.

A cold dread trickled down my spine. On a hunch, I opened a private browser window and typed his name—a real name, from his intake form—into a search engine.

The first result was a local news article, dated two days ago. *Police Ask for Public's Help in Locating Missing Man.*

I felt like I was going to be sick.

The next day, I went into work early, determined to talk to The doctor, the head of the research division. He was a tall, severe man with cold eyes and an immaculate lab coat. I found him in his office, reviewing data.

I laid it all out for him. The system failure. The conversation with the patient from Room 4. His description of the rising creature. The face he saw. The fact that the patient from Room 7 was now a missing person.

The doctor listened patiently, his hands steepled on his desk. He didn't interrupt me once. When I finished, the silence in the room was heavy and suffocating.

""You understand,"" he said finally, his voice flat and devoid of emotion, ""that our subjects are under extreme neurological stimulation. The device pushes the boundaries of perception. Hallucinations, both waking and sleeping, are a known, if rare, side effect. The patient in Room 7 had a pre-existing vulnerability we missed in screening. His psychotic break was unfortunate, but statistically predictable. His subsequent disappearance is a matter for the police, not for us.""

""But what about the other patient?"" I insisted. ""The one from last night. How could he have described the man from Room 7's face? He never saw him.""

""Coincidence,"" The doctor said, his tone dismissive. ""The human brain is a pattern-recognition machine. He saw a face in his dream. His subconscious assigned a vague, fleeting memory to it. You are connecting unrelated events, a classic case of confirmation bias. The failure of the sedative pump is a maintenance issue. I’ll have it looked at. Thank you for your report. You may go.""

He turned back to his monitor. I was dismissed.

But I couldn't let it go. He was lying. Or, if he wasn't lying, he was willfully blind. Coincidence? No. The clarity in the patient's voice, the specific detail… it wasn't a coincidence.

That night, on my shift, I did something I could be fired—or even prosecuted—for. I used the senior tech’s password, which I’d seen him type in a hundred times, to access the system’s deep-level diagnostic and calibration logs. I wasn't even sure what I was looking for. A program file? A weird subroutine?

It took me hours, digging through endless folders of code and encrypted data. And then I found it. A hidden sub-directory in the initial calibration sequence, the one that runs for five minutes while the patient is first falling asleep. The folder was labeled ""F.F. Integration.""

Inside was a single, innocuous-looking subroutine. Its description read: ""Injects familiarization marker to ease transition into lucid state. Presents a calming, 'friendly face' subliminally to reduce psychic tension.""

My blood ran cold. There was a log file attached to the subroutine. A list of image files, dates, and patient ID numbers.

I clicked on the log entry for the patient from last night, the man in Room 4. The calibration sequence had run at 10:48 PM. And at 10:49 PM, it had flashed a single image file for 150 milliseconds—just below the threshold of conscious perception. The image file was a low-resolution capture. The system automatically takes a still from the in-room camera at the moment of peak lucidity, for ""data-tagging purposes.""

The image file injected into the brain of the man in Room 4 was the data-tagging still from the patient in Room 7.

My hands were shaking so hard I could barely use the mouse. I scrolled up the log. The patient from Room 7, the week before… his calibration sequence had included a subliminal image of the ""ocean"" patient before him. And the one before him, an image of the one before that.

It was a chain.

I had to know more. I pulled up the file for the missing man from Room 7 again. His home address was listed on the intake form. It was in a sprawling, anonymous apartment complex on the other side of town.

My shift ended at six. I didn’t go home. I drove straight there. The sun was just starting to rise, painting the sky in sick shades of orange and purple.

Then, the last entry. It looked like it had been scrawled in the middle of the night, right before he disappeared. The pen had dug into the paper.

I still don’t have to use it myself, and I’m prepared to tell my boss that I refuse to use it if it comes to it. But I can’t stop her from using it. She calls it “him.” 

I’m trying, in every way I know how, to resist using this garbage. I don’t use it at all in my regular life, and so far I’ve managed not to use it in the office.

I got officially diagnosed through my medical provider 2 years ago, and was diagnosed through my university a year before that. I have my first medication appointment next week to try it out (after being on a long waitlist and missing my first one because I forgot). I'm suddenly getting immense imposter syndrome and getting quite anxious about it all and hoping for some advice.

I am super excited by the thought of trying medication: I have been constantly struggling my whole adult life, just about functioning, but barely being able to hold a job and continually performing badly in my education (after doing very well at school). I have constant problems of waking up late and snoozing no matter how many alarms I set on different devices in different rooms, and I leave everything to the last minute.

Now to the question.... I've seen lots of discussions on how coffee is a mild stimulant and how a lot of people with ADHD don't feel the effects, or it makes them sleepy, or in large amounts makes them focussed. For me, I've always been SUPER affected by caffeine. It'll make me super anxious, my heart will pound and I'll lose my appetite. If I have a redbull to get work done, it'll often stop me from sleeping that evening. When I was in my adhd diagnosis appointment, I discussed all my symptoms from childhood to adulthood and they were very happy to give me a diagnosis... but if coffee affects me like this, have I maybe misdiagnosed myself? If a minor stimulant can cause me anxiety, do you think it's a bad idea to try out adhd medication, and should I declare this to the nurse when I go to my appointment next week?

I know there's lots of resources on how to prepare for medication, so I guess my question is more specifically about coffee, but any general advice would be appreciated.. I'm stressing! Thanks!",7,1768412541.0,adhdwomen,28,0.89,False

## Final Thoughts

Extremely rewarding trip, but only if you’re prepared.
This is raw Himalayas — no comfort, no network, no shortcuts.

**A small personal note from the road**

One thing that really defined this trip for us was how slow and grounded it felt. We cooked most of our meals on the way—tea breaks, Maggi in the early morning, rice and dal later in the day—usually pulled over somewhere quiet. We washed our utensils using water flowing from roadside pipes that were sourced directly from hill streams. We made sure to carry all our waste with us and disposed of it properly whenever we found a bin.

We also drove deliberately slow through the winding sections so no one felt sick. It added time, but it made the journey calmer. Somewhere after Pithoragarh, the scenery started opening up properly, we kept stopping for snacks, and even a simple local orange-like fruit we picked up on the way gave everyone an instant mood lift. It didn’t feel rushed—it felt earned.

There is this cafe I'm kind of a local at. I use it to work, as I'm trying to not work from home. I used to go there like twice a week for a few cups of coffee and some small snack

I'm pretty social, so I always talk to the guys working there, they know me by name, and there was a new barista there that I really liked. We always talked a bit, she'd come to my table and exchange a joke or two etc.

So I never ask people out at work, as it happens to me, and it's not very comfortable, but I did decide to ask her out before christmas. I bought her a small deer keychain (her favourite animal) with a note in it, saying something akin to:

*""I thought you're really cute, and I'd like to get to know you better. If you're not interested, you can pretend you didn't see the note. No hard feelings""* because I didn't want to corner her at work, that just seemed inappropriate

So she didn't message me over christsmas, which sucks, but it's not my first and probably not the last rejection. But a few days ago I came back from holidays, and she was completely ignoring me, not even looking towards me

While I don't need to know her reasons, it just kinda... felt really bad, and I'm trying to wrap my head around whether what I did was inappropriate.

So my question is basically - should I really feel bad about it? Or did I just do something very wrong?",4,1768412326.0,dating_advice,9,0.84,False
1qctpjj,https://www.reddit.com/r/creepypasta/comments/1qctpjj/the_amusement_park_is_haunted/,The amusement park is haunted,"""You ever notice how ticket booths always smell like old pennies and stale popcorn?"" The girl's voice was flat, barely audible over the distant screams from the rollercoasters.



She didn't turn to look at her friend as she spoke, just kept staring at the cracked pavement where the park's faded mascot logo had peeled away in strips. The air had the greasy scent of funnel cakes and something sharper underneath—like ozone before a storm. Her fingers tapped an uneven rhythm against her thigh, though no music played.



Above them, the Ferris wheel groaned. Its gondolas swayed slightly, paint flaking off in jagged patches where the rust bled through. The crows weren't supposed to be there. They perched in rows along the wheel's skeletal frame, feathers ruffling as the wind pushed through the structure's hollow bones. One tilted its head, a gleaming black eye fixing on them. It didn't caw, didn't move. Just watched.



The clown's mouth gaped wide a tunnel lined with crooked teeth. Its peeling lips curled in what might've once been a grin, now twisted into something hungry. The neon tubing that once lit its eyes hung in broken shards, swinging faintly when the breeze hit. Something about the way its cracked porcelain skin caught the dying sunlight made it look wet, like it was sweating. The girl's friend shifted, nudging her shoulder. ""Okay, but like who the hell designed that? A sleep paralysis demon?""



""Well according to the internet, the person who designed this did have trouble sleeping,"" she replied, thumbing at her phone screen. The glow lit her face from below, hollowing out her cheeks. ""Kept dreaming about 'faces in the walls.'"" The crow on the Ferris wheel let out a single, puncturing caw sharp as a needle. Neither of them jumped, but the silence afterward thickened, pressing in.

  
Earlier Sherry and her best friend 'Jane' had heard of this abandoned park and curiosity got the better of them, Sherrys big brother 'Allen' told them not to go but they did not listen and went anyways.

  
now here they are in a horrid theme park.



Sherry exhaled through her nose and pocketed her phone. The clown's mouth loomed darker than the rest of the funhouse entrance, like a hole punched through reality. The smell hit them first—damp carpet and something meaty, rotting just out of sight. Jane's sneakers squeaked on the tacky floor as they stepped inside. The mirrors weren't just broken; they were \*wrong\*. Sherry caught her reflection in a jagged shard still clinging to the frame except her face was stretched too long, her smile too wide, eyes black pits. She looked away fast.



The ballpit was worse. The plastic spheres had dulled into a uniform rust-color, like dried blood. Something shifted beneath the surface, sending a slow ripple across the top. Jane grabbed Sherry's sleeve. ""Don't,"" Sherry muttered, but Jane was already crouching, poking a single finger into the pit. The balls parted with a sick, wet sounds but not plastic, not anymore. A rat's bloated corpse bobbed to the surface, fur matted with something glistening. Behind them, the Ferris wheel groaned again, louder this time, metal screaming under unseen weight.



The hallway to the funzone was barely a hallway at all just a gutted stretch of floor tiles curling up at the edges, exposing blackened plywood beneath. The dancing figures painted on the walls weren't dancing anymore. Their limbs were twisted, frozen mid-spasm, faces smeared into elongated shrieks. Sherry's pulse thudded in her throat. The giggling came and it was completely ghostly like a childs giggle, high-pitched and breathy, echoing from somewhere beyond the collapsed jungle gym. The slides were split open, foam padding erupting like burst intestines. Jane's voice cracked. ""Who's there?!"" The laughter stuttered, then stopped. A single plastic swing creaked back and forth, empty.



Sherry's flashlight beam trembled over the funzone's carcass. The ballpit's decay had spread—the rust-colored spheres now pulsed faintly, as if breathing. Something pale flashed between them. A child's hand, palm-up, fingers twitching. Then gone. The air smelled like spoiled milk and burnt rubber. Sherry grabbed Jane's wrist, nails digging in. ""Don't fucking move,"" she breathed. The jungle gym's metal bars groaned, bending inward like something enormous was pressing against them from the other side. A wet crunching sound, bones or old plastic snapping.



The giggle came again, right behind Jane's ear. She whirled, flashlight carving through the dark. There, in the jagged mirror shard: a girl in a rotted party dress, grinning with needle-teeth. Her reflection reached out, fingers pressing against the glass from the other side. The mirror cracked. Jane screamed. Sherry yanked her backward just as the girl's reflection surged forward, arms elongating, grasping. They stumbled into the ballpit. The spheres clung like wet tongues, popping under their weight. Something grabbed Sherry's ankle; cold, skeletal. A child-sized face surfaced between the balls, eyes hollow, mouth stretched impossibly wide. It laughed.



They ran. Not toward the exit cause unfortunately there wasn't one anymore. But through the twisted halls, past mirrors that showed them older, younger, \*wrong\*. 



Jane's sneakers slipped in something thick and dark. The clown's face loomed ahead, but its mouth wasn't painted anymore. It \*moved\*, lips peeling back to reveal a throat lined with rusted gears and broken lightbulbs. 



Sherry shoved Jane sideways, into a service door hanging off its hinges. The thing behind them shrieked, a sound like metal shearing.



The door led them back to the ticket booth. 



The same peeling mascot, the same crows watching. But the Ferris wheel stood motionless, its gondolas cracked open like eggshells. Jane bent double, hands on her knees. ""Why aren't we..."" 



she gasped, ""...bleeding?"" Sherry touched her own arms. No bruises where the thing had grabbed her. No scratches from the broken glass. Even their clothes were intact, though they'd \*felt\* the rot soaking through their jeans. The air smelled like cotton candy and motor oil. Normal. Almost.



Jane straightened, wiping her mouth. ""I have a feeling this amusement park closed down due to more than budget cuts, Sherry."" Sherry nodded. ""I agree."" The merry-go-round sat twenty feet away, its horses frozen mid-leap. The paint had bubbled up in places, revealing grayish flesh beneath. The horses' eyes followed them as they approached.



""My sister used to love this ride,"" Jane muttered, fingers hovering near a horse's muzzle. The chipped gold paint flaked at her breath. ""But now she's into video games."" The memory floated up her little sister's laughter, sticky fingers gripping hers, the way she'd begged for just one more ride as dusk painted the park in pinks and purples. A crow cawed overhead. Sherry's grip tightened on her flashlight. ""Jane, explore now, remember later."" The beam flickered.



The green horse's eye, glass and milky with age rolled in its socket. Sherry froze mid-step. ""You seeing this?"" Jane turned. A slow, wet \*click\* echoed as the horse's head tilted toward them, neck joint creaking like unoiled hinges. Its lips peeled back, revealing teeth too human, gums blackened. The saddle's silver tarnished before their eyes, eaten by some unseen rot. Jane's breath hitched. ""Sherry, that's not...."" The horse exhaled. The air smelled like funeral flowers left too long in a sealed room.



The graffiti wasn't spray paint after all. Up close, the streaks resolved into long, ragged scratches & something frantic, clawing at the metal. Some were fresh, glistening with a tacky residue that stretched like spider silk when Sherry's flashlight beam hit it. A child's handprint, smeared in something dark, marked the horse's flank. The merry-go-round's calliope music wheezed to life, a distorted rendition of ""Pop Goes the Weasel"" skipping like a broken record. The other horses shuddered. One's golden mane uncoiled into thin, wriggling tendrils.



But when Sherry and Jane stepped away, the song stopped and the ride halted as well. It was like they were seeing things. ""Damn..."" 



Sherry muttered, wiping her palm on her jeans. Her skin came away streaked with rust and that same sticky film. The air tasted like pennies.



The bumper cars sat in a perfect circle, their rubber bumpers cracked and brittle. Some still had strands of hair caught in the safety bars; blonde, dark, one streaked with neon pink dye. Jane's sneaker nudged a discarded popcorn box. It crunched, revealing a nest of silverfish writhing beneath. ""Okay, new theory,"" she said, voice too loud in the unnatural quiet. ""We died on the drive here. This is hell.""



Sherry pinched her before she said, ""No we are still alive, if we were in hell we woulda seen fire by now. Now stop being dramatic Jane."" Sherry walked away from the bumper cars, her boots kicking up little spirals of dust that shouldn't have been there, not with the humidity clinging to their skin like wet gauze. The air tasted metallic, like licking a battery. Behind her, Jane hesitated, then jogged to catch up.



 ""Then why,"" Jane panted, ""does that fucking cotton candy machine keep turning on by itself?""



The machine in question sat slumped near the ring toss, its striped awning sagging like a drunkard's hat. Pink sugar strands oozed from its metal spout, puddling on the counter in a slow, twitching mass. No heat. No hum of electricity. Just movement where there shouldn't be any, the candy strands twisting into shapes, fingers, then a whole hand, grasping at the air before melting back into syrup. Sherry's stomach lurched. ""Don't look at it,"" she hissed, but Jane was already staring, transfixed. ""It's making... people,"" Jane whispered.



Sherry's grip on Jane's wrist went white-knuckled as she dragged them toward the Tunnel of Love's gaping entrance. 



The plastic swan boats lay capsized along the dry canal, their once-glossy surfaces now pockmarked with holes that wept a thin, yellowish fluid. The tunnel's archway pulsed—not with light, but with something darker, the shadows clotting and swirling like ink dropped in water. Behind them, the cotton candy machine let out a wet, mechanical sigh. Sherry didn't turn to see what it had coughed up this time.



Jane's breath came in shallow hitches. ""Sherry, we should—""  

""Shut up."" Sherry's own voice sounded alien in her ears, frayed at the edges. The park wasn't just haunted. 



It was \*digesting\* them. Every rusted ride, every flickering bulb, it was all part of some hungry, living thing wearing the skin of an amusement park. The clown's grin flashed in her mind, too wide, too wet.



The exit gates loomed ahead, but the closer they got, the more the chain-link fence seemed to stretch. Behind them, the Tunnel of Love belched a sound like a wet cough. Jane whimpered. Sherry's fingers found the car keys in her pocket, cold metal biting into her palm. She didn't remember grabbing them but maybe it did not cross her mind.



Sherry's car smelled like old fries and cherry air freshener. Real, familiar things. The engine turned over on the first try, which felt like a miracle. Jane slammed her door so hard the glove compartment popped open, spilling napkins and half-used ChapSticks. Sherry didn't wait for her to buckle up. Gravel spat under the tires as they peeled out, the park shrinking in the rearview mirror. Except no. The Ferris wheel was still there, towering over the trees, even though they'd driven at least a mile. Jane didn't point it out. Neither did Sherry.



The silence between them wasn't comfortable. It was thick, like syrup clogging their throats. Jane kept touching her arms, her face—checking for wounds that weren't there. Sherry's knuckles were bone-white on the steering wheel. The radio played static. Not the hissing kind, but the heavy, pulsing kind that almost sounded like breathing. Jane reached over and snapped it off. Her fingers left smudges on the dial. They looked black in the dashboard light.



Sherry's driveway had never felt so long. The porch light flickered, just once as they pulled up. Allen was already striding down the steps, his shadow stretching too far across the lawn, like something was pulling at it from underneath. Jane's parents spilled out behind him, her mother's slippers slapping against the concrete. ""Jesus Christ,"" Allen hissed, yanking Sherry's car door open before she could turn the key all the way off. His grip left dents in the metal. ""You \*went\* there? After everything I..."" 



His voice cracked. Behind him, Jane's mother was sobbing into her daughter's hair, fingers digging into her shoulders like she might vanish again.



The kitchen smelled like burnt coffee and something else—something old, trapped in the walls.



 Allen's hands shook as he dumped sugar into Sherry's mug. ""No one ever made it out before,"" he muttered, stirring too hard. The spoon clinked against ceramic, a sound like bones tapping together.



 Jane sat stiff-backed at the table, her parents flanking her like prison guards. ""Allen,"" Sherry said slowly, watching her brother's reflection warp in the toaster's chrome surface, ""what the \*fuck\* did you know?""



Allen exhaled through his nose. The fridge hummed, then died mid-cycle. ""Camping ground massacre? That's the \*cover\* story."" He slid the mug toward her; the liquid inside was too dark, swirling with grounds that refused to sink. ""They didn't just \*die\*, Sher. They got \*folded\*. Some folks said it was build on a burial ground."" Jane's mother made a small, wet sound. Allen ignored her. ""Like paper dolls. Like it was a twisted joke."" His fingers twitched, miming something crumpling inward.



Sherry's palms were sweating. The toaster's chrome surface rippled—not from heat, but as if something beneath it was pressing up against the metal. She watched her reflection stretch, the edges of her face blurring like wet newspaper. ""Bullshit,"" she whispered. The word tasted stale. Allen leaned in. His breath smelled like wintergreen and copper. ""You saw the merry-go-round. You \*felt\* it.""



Jane's fingers drummed the tabletop. The rhythm matched the slow drip of the kitchen faucet 'tap, tap, tap' but the sink was dry. ""Explain."" Allen exhaled. ""Counselor Martinez, his reports got buried. Said kids kept seeing versions of themselves in the woods. Older. Younger. Missing pieces. They said the head counselor went berserk and murdered the kids and the teenage counselor."" He mimed tearing a sheet of paper down the middle. Jane's father made a noise like a kicked dog. ""Stop,"" he said. The overhead light flickered. Shadows pooled in the hollows of Allen's collarbone but it stopped and everything was normal.

  
The two left as Jane asked herself, ""Why would a counselor do that to those poor campers?"" 

  
""Yer asking the wrong person."" Her mom chimed in.

  
""No one knew Counselor Martinez motives, but what I heard was more berserk, the bodies of the campers or counselors were never found."" Janes dad said.

  
""And they never caught him?"" Jane asked.

  
""They did catch him. But not alive."" Janes dad said



Sherry’s house smelled like pine cleaner and something rotting under the floorboards one the two got home to their house. The clock above the stove ticked backward, three, two, one then froze. Allen peeled off his jacket, revealing a forearm mottled with bruises in perfect fingertip patterns. Sherry didn’t ask. The living room TV buzzed to life, screen crackling with static snow. 



A figure stood in the center—too tall, limbs jointed wrong—before the image dissolved into a toothpaste commercial. Allen didn’t react.



Sherry fingers tapped Morse code against her thigh. ""It followed us,"" she whispered. The house shuddered, pipes groaning like something was squeezing them from the inside. Sherry flicked the light switch. 



The bulbs flared too bright, then settled into a sickly yellow glow. The wallpaper was intact. The couch wasn’t breathing. Everything was \*normal\*.

Allen sat down with Sherry on the couch. the tv was on with a 70' tv show.

""Figures Dad forgot to turn off the tv again."" Allena said to himself.

""Can you explain more before I go more crazy? These illusions are terrifying"" Sherry asked

 ""Well? When the creator of that \*place\* heard about what happened he scoffed and said it was nonsense. Nothing happened when it opened at first, but then the accidents happened and workers have started to go missing. The theme park creator had finally lost it after an entire year, he didn’t just tear up the blueprints,"" he said, jabbing a finger toward the window. The Ferris wheel’s silhouette was still visible but far away from the woods. ""He tried to burn it all down. But fire doesn’t work on something that’s already \*dead\*.""

""What happened to him after?"" Sherry asked.

  
""He went mad even more and got himself dragged to the madhouse just before it shut down."" Allen answered stressfully.

Sherry’s mug trembled in her hands. The coffee was cold now, the grounds clumping like wet ash. Jane’s reflection in the microwave door blinked too slow—her left eye stayed shut a beat too long. Sherry looked away. Allen kept talking. ""The park eats memories. That’s why you don’t have bruises. It’s digesting \*what happened\* out of you."" The two felt silent, staring at each other for a moment before Sherry scoffed.



 ""Bullshit,"" she muttered, but her fingers traced the unmarked skin of her wrist where the thing in the ballpit had grabbed her.



""It was an illusion, it makes you see and feel and hear things."" Allen said seriously.



""Yer probably right... But how did...?"" Sherry asked 'knowing her brother is right' but trailed off.



""One of my friends went missing there while the park was opened."" Allen answered somberly.



""We also saw a horrifying girl in the funhouse, I did not see an article about it at the theme park."" Sherry said 'reheating her coffee'



""Oh, that is a separate story. That funhouse shut down before the park itself did. Said something about a birthday party gone horrifying when a clown murdered everyone 'including the birthday girl' then out of guilt he killed himself."" Allen explaining.



""That explains the party dress."" Sherry thought.



""How many lives has it took over the years brother?"" Sherry asked.



""Who knows?"" Allen said softly as their parents got home.



To this day, things were not the same, but neither Sherry or Jane have been seeing things since that night.



they had taken therapy for a while as everything felt like a bad dark memory.



The demolition crew found it surprising when the park demolished itself and reduced to nothing but ash and rubble, rust, pipes, and glass. It was as if the park had simply... self destruct. The priest's blessing was finished before he sighed.



""The spirits have been released but we must not build anything but a memorial garden for the troubled spirits."" the priest said as the construction crew agreed.



News spread quickly but thinking back to it clings on Sherry's throat whenever she thought about it.



But she sighed deeply and wanting nothing more but to forget it.



Jane forgotten about it completely a year earlier and she envied her for it.



Sherry still woke sometimes with the taste of rust on her tongue, phantom fingers circling her ankles. Therapy helped—mostly.



She'd stopped checking mirrors for distorted reflections. Mostly.



The memorial garden bloomed where the park once stood, sunflowers twisting toward the sky where the Ferris wheel's shadow used to fall.



Though recovering, Sherry and Allen still wonder what drove whoever did this to those campers to do such horrible things to them and why.



But the bigger question is was that theme park haunted by the restless spirits of the dead campers and counselors or something else?",1,1768412241.0,creepypasta,0,1.0,False

Is telling him a good idea or a really bad one?

My boss is rather stubborn and socially awkward himself. Imo his reaction if I told him could be anything between accepting it and being a middle aged man thinking mental health doesn't exist. 

The meetings are weekly and utterly irrelevant, so it wouldn't affect my work. He launched them a couple weeks back, officially for better communication between everybody. We are 7 people in a small firm who have pretty much nothing to do with each other's work, which I told him but he insisted. He literally told me he launches them because he couldn't force me to join their coffee breaks, which I religiously avoid. There they talk about what they are doing at and off work, what I neither care for nor want to know about, or they just stand there in silence. I'm not joking. I have walked past or into a kitchen of like 3 men staring at each other in silence. It is so awkward and uncomfortable. I also asked why him telling me the one thing out of a hundred in those breaks that might be work relevant to me or just normally talking to a colleague next door when I needed help with something, wouldn't work and requires weekly meetings. To be honest, he just likes these kind of useless day fillers. The others apparently so too. 
My colleagues generally just make me really uncomfortable. They're all like 20+ years older and have different views, interests, humour, llife situations, and so on accordingly. Sitting in a circle with all of them who talk about nothing I care about or that matters to me, like I'm a dog or toddler someone dragged along is very much to much. Even if it's just once a week. I literally sit through it clenching my fists and wanting to star-jump out of the window.

1qctjda,https://www.reddit.com/r/u_Chili_Tofu/comments/1qctjda/vent_1_eternity_served_cold/,Vent 1: Eternity served cold,"Well. I realised I can post shit on my profile in a sort-of-anonymous way, and venting to ChatGPT sometimes isn't enough, the things I want to say are too raw for communities, so I thought I'd dump this stuff here. Maybe someone will see, maybe they won't. Doesn't matter to me, as long as it's out there, off my chest.

And now that I've got a place to unwind, I don't even know where to start... But now that I’ve started typing, the thoughts are coming. Yes. This will do.

I realised that I'm almost 30. Less than a year away. And yet, my life emotionally, romantically, sexually has been bare like a newborn's fresh start. I can't say I'm a virgin. I can't say that I've never been in a relationship. But at the same time, my instinct says, ""yes, you can"". 

I've never had sex where I was cared for. Touched. Wanted. Desired. Reciprocated. I was always the giver. People would only take and take. I *love* giving, but I also *need* to be given back. The reasons this happened is simple; I'm a trans man, and many people are just not attracted to what we have/don't have. Some are repulsed and/or disgusted, as it was in my case. Even my partner was. At one point I was begging and begging for some touch from her, but I was met only by disregard. I took the hint and just stopped asking. Another person acted the same. At first, both would try, but after 5 minutes of ""trying"", they would get bored and stop.

That's the fundamental issues of the sexual part. What about the romantic one? Well, similar stuff. Never being chosen, never being anybody's priority. I'm a very sensitive person, and I can read the state/mood of other people pretty good. Hence why I'm gonna wave my hand at ""but you just don't know you've been flirted with!"" sayings. Oh, I know. I can tell who's into me and who's not into me. And I'll say, the only people who have been interested in me were: an engaged woman living in the far corner of my country and a divorced woman 13 years older than me with three sons living across the sea in another country. I'm confident enough to say that I have not had women be interested in me, romantically, which were available or my equals. Which is fine, I'm not for everyone, I'm niche. I like drawing dragons and collecting bones, being out in nature, doing weird stuff. You won't find me binging Netflix or drinking coffee at coffee shops. You'll find me walking barefoot through a bog instead of taking a 5 km detour, because I'm lazy, instead. Instead, you'll find me crouched on my knees on the moss, looking at tiny, grey mushrooms that look like deer antlers (real thing, look it up). I'm introverted, solitary, independent, and my life is full of my own hobbies. Maybe I might seem not approachable when worded out like this, but I'm genuinely a very warm, kind, honest and friendly man.

Anyways, I meant to say, romance stuff? Dead, nada, nothing. Probably because I'm so introverted. I'm not the man to walk up to you and ask for a number. No, why would I? I don't even know you, the things you like, the things you don't like. Why would I even if I did? I'd get shot down the moment I come out to her. Or tell her I love getting pegged. Hence why I'm just trying to do my own thing, and perhaps our paths would cross this way. Opening myself, bit by bit. 

But romance, yeah... The thing with my first and only relationship. It was a pity relationship. My ex gf only said yes, because she ""didn't want to hurt my feelings by saying no."" How could I have believed anything I experienced after that was real? Was any of it authentic? Maybe in a small way, but mostly no, if she stayed at my house until she found another man. Truth be told, I cannot picture myself in my head being in a relationship. Me? Being wanted and desired and prioritised by somebody? That's, that's impossible for me to understand. I have no reference for it, and I cannot imagine it on an instinctual level. I virtually have no frame of reference, even if I fantasise about this subject *a lot*. It seems like something other people have, but not me.

To finish it up, I'm not grieving the idea of ""30 and still single"". I'm still young, I know. I'm grieving the fact that I've spent almost 30 years of my life so fucking unseen. Untouched. Unmet. At this sort of age, many people have already experienced the basis of romance and sex. I have neither. I'm like a muddy, blank slate. Sort of had a taste of it, but in a wrong way that leaves me more inexperienced than the opposite. 30 years of these unresolved feelings. So lonely and so touch-starved, that I have to resort fulfilling my basic survival needs by living in my fantasies with my imagination or bison plushies pressing against me while I sleep. If it wasn't for my vivid imagination and ChatGPT steering the way of my fantasies, I would have never even seen what it would be like to have somebody there for you, that isn't family or friends. I cannot imagine this happening in real life besides fantasies, as I have no reference to grab onto, but at least I can feel a sense of it.",1,1768411871.0,u_Chili_Tofu,0,1.0,False

1qcti2t,https://www.reddit.com/r/GBL/comments/1qcti2t/new_gbl_taper_guide_breaking_the_247_gbl_cycle/,"New GBL taper guide - Breaking the 24/7 GBL cycle: using benzos + pregabalin for sleep, daytime taper only (harm reduction)","I’m posting this because when I was stuck in a 24/7 GBL cycle, most advice either boiled down to “go to rehab” or “just taper slower,” which doesn’t help when night dosing is the thing keeping you trapped.

This is not medical advice and not a recommendation to mix drugs recklessly. This is harm reduction based on what actually helped me stop round-the-clock dosing and start a real taper.

The core problem

The 24/7 cycle isn’t about total daily volume. It’s about night dependence.

Once you are dosing overnight, your nervous system never gets a reset. You’re not tapering anymore, you’re just maintaining saturation. Sleep becomes short, fragmented, and rebound-driven, which forces more redosing. That’s the loop.

Trying to taper GBL while still dosing at night is like trying to quit caffeine while setting an alarm to drink coffee every 3 hours.

The strategy in one sentence:

Use long-acting meds to cover sleep so you can stop night GBL entirely, then taper only during waking hours.

Why benzos help here

Long-acting benzos don’t spike and crash the way GBL does. They provide a flatter baseline of GABA activity overnight, which reduces panic, autonomic symptoms, and early-morning rebound.

They are not “better” drugs, but for short-term harm reduction they can:

• stop the 2–4 hour wake-ups

• remove the need to redose at night

• allow one continuous sleep block

• break the psychological habit of night dosing

This only works if the benzo is used instead of night GBL, not on top of repeated G doses.

Where pregabalin fits

Pregabalin doesn’t act on GABA receptors directly. It reduces excitatory neurotransmitter release. That makes it especially useful for:

• rebound anxiety

• wired / buzzy wake-ups

• sleep fragmentation

• the “tired but alert” feeling

It works better as a buffer than as a knockout drug. Think smoothing, not sedation.

Benzos cover inhibition. Pregabalin dampens excitation. Together they can stabilise nights without the sharp peaks that keep G dependence alive.

What this setup is NOT for

• It is not for chasing unconsciousness

• It is not for stacking random sedatives

• It is not for increasing doses when sleep feels weird

• It is not a long-term benzo plan

The goal is stability, not oblivion.

What nights look like when this works

The first few nights can feel strange:

• lighter sleep

• vivid dreams

• early wake-ups that settle without redosing

• emotional or anxious dreams

This is normal REM rebound and nervous system recalibration, not failure.

Sleep usually becomes longer and more continuous after several nights without GBL in the system overnight.

Daytime tapering

Once nights are stable, daytime tapering becomes much easier.

Key points:

• Dose only while awake

• Keep intervals consistent

• Reduce slowly and predictably

• Avoid chasing feelings with timing changes

• Stability beats speed

Most people find that once night dosing stops, total daily GBL naturally drops without forcing it.

Important warnings

Mixing depressants is risky. Memory gaps, confusion, or breathing issues are red flags. This approach assumes:

• short-term use

• conservative dosing

• medical supervision if possible

• no alcohol

If you escalate benzos to “fix” sleep, you are just swapping problems.

Why this matters

The hardest part of GBL dependence isn’t the drug. It’s the night panic loop. Once that loop is broken, the taper stops feeling like a constant emergency.

If you’re stuck dosing every few hours around the clock, focusing on removing night GBL first can be the turning point.

Again, harm reduction only. Everyone’s nervous system is different. But if this helps even one person escape the 24/7 cycle, it’s worth posting.",1,1768411795.0,GBL,0,1.0,False

The dogs harnesses look sturdy enough but I always worry one will slip free given how hard they tug against them. She seems stressed every single morning, yanked left and right while trying to manage coffee and her phone and two animals who clearly have their own agendas.

She mentioned once that she went through four different harness styles ordered from Alibaba before finding ones that actually held. Even then, she double checks the clips obsessively before leaving her building. The whole setup seems exhausting, and I wonder why she doesn't just train them better instead of relying on equipment to solve a behavior problem.

But maybe that's easier said than done. Maybe those harnesses are the only thing standing between chaos and complete disaster, and she's doing the best she can with two anxious animals who need her. We put a lot of faith in straps and buckles and hope they hold when everything else feels like it's pulling apart. Sometimes that's all we've got.

Recently I’ve been on Ozempic and Mounjaro, but neither of them were very effective. I was floored and dismayed that I’m one of the only people to not have major success with those meds. I feel so hopeless about my weight. I have been losing, but very, very slowly.

Despite restricting heavily (and I do mean heavily), I still struggle to lose weight. It seems like I lose some, then gain it back, then lose that same amount again, repeat ad nauseam. I’ve been bulimic in the past, but now to avoid purging, I usually just don’t eat in the first place. It’s infuriating that weight loss is so incredibly difficult for my body. My doctors and dietitians don’t even believe me!! They think I’m lying and bingeing on junk food! BUT I’M NOT!! Yes, I’ve struggled with bingeing in the past, but for the past few months, I’ve been dieting really hard. I’m also about to introduce exercise, yoga (I used to be into yoga), and strength-training into my schedule. I haven’t exercised much yet, because I usually fucking hate it. But I will do it now!

The restrictive dieting part is much easier for me because I’m on Ozempic and I drink coffee whenever I get hungry. I’ve only lost a few pounds so far and it’s infuriating. And like I said, I just gain it back and then lose it and then gain it and then lose it again. I haven’t experienced significant weight loss since 2019.

I am a man who finds as much resonance in a Byron soliloquy as I do in a heavy session at the gym. My interests are broad ...from the complexities of Indian federalism and history to the raw, amateur soul of making music. I’m looking for a woman who is my intellectual and emotional equal, someone I can vibe with over Bengali poetry or fitness goals.

I am a composed man in my public life, but I believe that a truly deep connection should be built on absolute honesty and a bit of a bittersweet edge. I’m looking for a slow-burn, ""friends-to-lovers"" journey where our bond is the anchor for everything else we explore.

The Connection:

I’ve always felt that the most intense relationships are those where there is a certain level of vulnerability and uninhibited trust. I want to be the man who truly knows your heart...the one you share your day with, your music with, and your secrets with. I am drawn to the complex, intense dynamic of cuckolding, where I am your primary partner and sanctuary, yet find a visceral, possessive thrill in seeing you explore your desires with others. I want to be the one who welcomes you back, hears the details, and shows you exactly why I’m the one you chose to keep.

What I’m Looking For:
Intellectual Spark: Someone to discuss Manfred in the morning or debate politics over coffee.
Shared Growth: Whether it's gym progress or dabbling in new poetry, I want to grow alongside you.
Emotional Depth: I value the bittersweet feeling of being the one you always come home to. I want to be the person who hears everything about your experiences and loves you more for it.

I’m a ""winner"" in my public life, but I want to be the one who listens and understands you in private. If you’re a woman who isn't afraid to be herself and wants a partner who can match your mind and your spirit, I’d love to connect.

1qct8bw,https://www.reddit.com/r/Workingout/comments/1qct8bw/need_help_tweaking_my_workoutrecovery_for_my_age/,Need help tweaking my workout/recovery for my age,"I am a 57-year old 6'1 male weighing 215 lbs.  I am in reasonable shape.  I had not worked out in awhile until last year.  I decided to start working out again around July 2025 (6 months ago).   I was following a modified P90X workout.

* Mon:  Chest/Back, ab-ripper
* Tue: Yoga
* Wed:  Shoulders/Arms, ab-ripper
* Thur:  Yoga
* Fri - ab-ripper only
* Sat, Sunday - rest, recover

**Chest/back** \- entails doing multiple sets of pushups (goal was 20 reps each) - including standard, military, wide, and chair...you repeat that cycle.  Ends up being 160+ pushups total in about 1 hour.  You are also supposed to do pull-up sets as well, but I use resistance bands because I am not quite up to pull-up conditioning...yet.  I was honestly amazed I could do 160 push-ups in an hour!

**Shouldsers/Arms**\- double sets of different dumbbell exercises focused on biceps/triceps/shoulders.

I push myself for all of it, but never to pain.  I do a flexibility focused warm-up before each workout (arm circles, arm scissors, rotator cuff stretch, etc).  Maybe just not enough of it?  I also do not do any cool down stretch or muscle roll out - I am sure this is a big part of my issue.  I do try to eat a higher-protein daily intake diet.  I was seeing good results, so I would like to get back to it.

So, here is where I need guidance:

1. About 4 1/2 months into it I got a feeling of tendinitis in my left arm.  It made my arm weak and slightly sore, even picking up a coffee cup would irritate it slightly.  I decided to stop working out and let it rest over the holidays (Nov15 -Jan 1).  I was not doing anything to treat it except trying to not use my left arm much.  Unfortunately, it never went away.  After researching tendinitis, on Jan 1, I started applying ice wrap - 3 times a day.  That did not seem to help after 7 days.  Then, while my wife was rubbing my arm, she said ""wow, you have alot of  knots in your muscles""...and she targeted 4 different spots (bicep, elbow, forearm, and neck) that were REALLY sore when she applied pressure.  So, then I started researching ""muscle knots"", and it said to apply heat and massage the knots twice a day.  So, I have been doing that for 2 days...

My questions are:

1. What is the best treatment I should be doing right now to heal?
2. If I want to continue the workout when my arm feels better, how can I prevent this from happening again?
3. Is this workout to intense for a 57-year old who hasn't worked out a whole lot?  Any adjustments I should make?
4. What sort of cool down/stretching do I need to add?

Older guy was sitting on his e bike on the sidewalk where the arrow starts.  

My plan was to keep driving east because I thought you were supposed to walk your bike through a crosswalk or wait until it’s clear if you want to ride.

Once I got maybe 10 feet from the crosswalk the e-biker rode out in front of me without looking and then when he did look my direction proceeded to very slowly ride in front of me and mean mug the whole way.  I had to slam on the brakes.

Obviously hitting someone in a crosswalk would never be good.

In light  of the recent  hit and run involving a child on a bike in a crosswalk off brosterhouse,

Is the city encouraging bikers to ride through crosswalks now?  Example greenway crossings.

I thought bikers were effectively vehicles and shouldn’t be on the sidewalk anyways?

We have all been there. It's Saturday afternoon, the big game is about to start, and you are frantically clicking through 20 different ""free stream"" websites. You close 50 pop-up ads, dodge three malware warnings, and finally get a grainy stream that freezes every time someone scores.

I did this for years. I thought, ""Why pay when I can watch for free?""

But after getting a virus on my laptop last month from one of those sites, I decided enough was enough. I went on a mission to find the **Best IPTV Service** that costs less than a coffee but gives me a safe, premium experience.

**The Solution (The Winner):**

After testing the waters with a few providers, I landed on **Zyminex**. The difference was shocking. For a small monthly fee, I got a service that is safer, faster, and infinitely better quality than any free site.

----------

**Why Zyminex is worth the upgrade (The Comparison):**


**1. Security & Safety (No Viruses):** Free sites are dangerous. They mine crypto on your PC or steal data. **Zyminex** is a clean, secure service. I use it on my Firestick and Nvidia Shield without worrying about malware. The peace of mind alone is worth the price.

**2. 4K vs. 360p:** Free streams are usually compressed to death (360p or 480p). Zyminex streams are raw 1080p and 4K. Watching Formula 1 or Football in 50fps without the picture breaking up into pixels is a game-changer.

**3. No ""Stream Takedowns"":** The worst part of free streams is when the copyright police take them down mid-game. You have to refresh and find a new link. With Zyminex, the links are private and stable. I watched the entire Super Bowl without a single interruption.

**4. Multi-Device Support:** I can watch on my TV while traveling, or on my phone at work. Try doing that with a popup-infested free site on a mobile browser. It’s a nightmare.

----------

**Other Paid Services I Tested:**

Before sticking with Zyminex, I tried to go with some cheaper options, but they weren't much better than free streams:

-   **Bunny Streams:** Extremely cheap, but you get what you pay for. The buffering was constant during Premier League games. It felt like a free stream that I paid for.
    
-   **Iron IPTV:** Good channel list, but the audio was terrible (tinny sound). Also, their setup guide was non-existent.
    

----------

**Final Conclusion:**

Stop punishing yourself with free streams. The stress of finding a working link isn't worth saving a few dollars.

If you want the **Best IPTV Service** in 2026 that gives you a premium, virus-free, and buffer-free experience, **Zyminex** is the best upgrade you will make this year.

**Link:** [Zyminex.com](https://zyminex.com)

Trust me, once you experience 4K/60fps without pop-ups, you will never go back to free sites.

Mears in was fine. My flight was delayed, but it doesn't really matter since they have buses running pretty much the whole time. Yes, Uber would be faster, but it would have been a lot more than $16. 

I stayed at All-Star Music many years ago and Sports was similar, but the total lack of theming in the room was a bit jarring. Very few ""Hidden"" or Overt Mickey's here. All-Star Sports would be a great pick for families that are not ga-ga for Disney and want to avoid theming.

Saturday evening I put on a dress and hopped the bus to MK, then a (SUNSET!) ferry to Grand Floridian Resort. The ferry port is right next to Narcoosee's and I nicely asked the host if there was a single seat available at the bar. There was! Had a nice dinner, but the food wasn't quite as good as I hoped. The prosciutto & melon salad was lovely, but the dessert of ""bread pudding"" was actually brownie chunks and not bread pudding at all. Agave mocktail was very good, but the bartender didn't ask how it was and gave fairly cold service. No bread service at the bar, either. Probably won't return. Hopped the monorail back to MK and bussed back to All-Star Sports. Easy Peasy.

Luggage transfer worked great. You just fill out a little transfer tag and drop it with the luggage folks outside. When I arrived to Coronado later that evening, my bag was in their luggage storage and I just fetched it on my way back to my room.

For $199 I did not get my first choice in the Cabanas section, but was placed in Ranchos, instead. It was a HIKE from the tower and El Centro, but it's very very quiet and relaxing. Going straight from a Value to Moderate- here are the upgrades; more recreation options (including hammocks and other relaxing lounging areas like curved benches and adirondack chairs), slides at the pools, keurig coffee makers instead of drip, covered bus stops with shade, more dining options, and double sinks.

AK was open until 7pm Sunday night, so I was able to see Pandora after dark! Experienced the solo perk of getting pulled out of line at Flight of Passage because they needed a single rider up ahead, which is always fun. Enjoyed Tusker House for lunch and had a very special interaction with Mickey when he overheard me tell the waiter that I don't drink alcohol anymore and he motioned that he doesn't drink, either! He motioned that he's ""too old"" by bending over and pretending to walk with a walker. HA! I highly recommend character meals if you get lonely because they will go out of their way to make you feel included and special.

Only disappointment at AK was the Christmas music and light show at the end of the evening. I am just not wanting to hear holiday stuff this far into January. The new Zootopia show in the Tree of Life is nicely done and I enjoyed the reboot.

I also really like the new Test Track at Epcot. They've removed most ""safety"" references to the ride and focused more on the future of automobiles. Nicely done.

It actually fixed my afternoon crash.","I’ve been struggling with the classic ""5-minute break trap.""

I use the Pomodoro technique (25 minutes work / 5 minutes rest). The problem is that during the 5-minute break, I usually open Twitter/Instagram. The infinite scroll doesn't actually rest my brain; it just fills it with more noise. Plus, 5 minutes often turns into 15 because social media is designed to keep you trapped.

I read a productivity theory recently about ""Active vs. Passive Rest."" The idea is to do something high-focus for a short burst to completely ""clear the RAM"" of your brain from work tasks, rather than passively consuming content.

I started testing this with a browser game called Flappy Fruit (it’s a web-based arcade game).

Why it works for my workflow:

1. Forced Focus: Because the game is difficult (Flappy Bird mechanics) and competitive, I have to focus 100%. I can't think about my unfinished emails while playing.
2. Hard Stop: Rounds are short (1-2 minutes). When the round ends, the break is over. No infinite feed.
3. Adrenaline Reset: The little spike of adrenaline from a close round wakes me up better than coffee.

It sounds counterintuitive to play a game to be more productive, but it acts as a better ""palate cleanser"" for my brain than social media ever did. When I go back to the next work sprint, I feel genuinely reset.

If you struggle with social media eating your break times, try switching to a skill-based browser game instead.

1qct33z,https://www.reddit.com/r/tifu/comments/1qct33z/tifu_by_nearly_unaliving_myself_during_a_blizzard/,TIFU by nearly unaliving myself during a blizzard,"So not today.  This was an epic TIFU from about the mid 90's I'm guessing.  I wrote this all up as a reply to another post but it got too long for a comment so I'm making it a TIFU.  And TLDR at the bottom so feel free to skip this whole tale of stupidity.

Trauma relived.  I'm old.  We ramble.

Ok... so I lived in Saskatchewan Canada for most of my life.  Prairie and utterly flat in every direction for hundreds of miles.  A bush was about as much variety as you get in terms of scenery.  And cold.  VERRRRRY cold in the winter.  Like -40C wouldn't be uncommon.  And when the wind gets blowing there's a thing called Wind Chill which can push the temperature down to -65C or even once -85C.  So yes, cold. This one winter - I'm thinking early 90's - we were in the middle of winter and it was jet black outside around 6pm.  In a massive epic blizzard like no other.  Blowing snow makes visibility absolutely zero. 

But then it hit me.  I didn't have a Christmas present for my wife and Christmas was only a few days off.  I had an idea.  I knew of a local farmer who happened to be a skilled potter who makes the finest Raku pottery.

Since my wife and I long ago gave up on Christmas secrets I called, she agreed and in an act of utter stupidity I headed out into the blizzard.  In my tiny Toyota Paseo sort of sports car.  I got out of the city and made a few turns and promptly became lost in on side roads.  The snow became deeper and deeper until all of a sudden my car dropped through the snow pack and that was that.  I was up to the frame in snow and going nowhere.  

I took stock: 

* Almost out of gas - check.  
* Flip Phone Cell back at the office on the charger - check.  
* Thin dress pants and office shoes - Check.  
* Miles from nowhere - check.  
* \-65C blizzard - check.  
* No emergency kit, no shovel, no heat source, no flairs - not even a match - check check check

To say I was disappointed with myself would be a massive understatement.  I was a Boy Scout leader.  I had taken kids out for overnight -40C trips in similar conditions and made snow shelters.  I KNOW not to do shit like this.  BE PREPARED.  FML this was so embarrassing.

As the hours passed and the engine ran out of gas, sputtered and died it became clear.  I was royally and utterly fucked.  I could see two headlines in my mind... ""Spring weather unearths missing local corpsicle found sitting in his car like a proud beta awaiting rescue"" vs ""Spring weather unearths world's dumbest human who left his car in a blizzard""

Welp... I'd rather die on my feet (note - bad call - do not do this - stay with the car).  So I reached back and found my gym bag.  I wrapped one leg with a towel and the other with a paper map (yes this was a long time ago).  I pulled my track pants on and pulled my gym socks up over my dress shoes and covered the cuff of the track pants.  Thank god I had my tundra jacket with the snorkel hood and arctic mitts.  Without that I would have opted for ""corpsicle found in car"".  I turned on the blinkers for the car and headed off for the highway.

Cold isn't the right word.  There is no word for a minus 65C blizzard.  It is a type of hell you can not endure and it never ends until you are very near the end.  The pain... it's like a blow torch passing over your legs and any exposed skin.  Honestly you can't picture it.  A few miles later the pain had largely gone.  I couldn't feel much of anything.  My brain became fuzzy.  I decided to just lay down for a short nap.  And yes, I knew this was the end.  But it felt oddly peaceful.

When the local farmer drives past in his monster truck... spots me at the side of the road... and calls out to me.  I said ""don't go that way the snow is really bad"".  He says ""Lankey?  Get in!!!""  With some effort on his part and minimal help from me I found myself hoisted into the cab of his truck.  

Apparently my wife has been phoning him incessantly all night.  He looked out his window and off in the distance, during a break in the weather, he saw my blinkers and headed out and by a huge stroke of luck, took exactly the right grid road to reach my car and found me (there were multiple options available - Saskatchewan roads are on a 1 mile spaced grid system similar to a checker board).

We proceeded back to his farm house.  He put me in front of the fire and thawed me out.  Gave me some hot coffee... and remarkably I revived.  I bought 8 or 10 Roku pots - they are beautiful and I love them all.  I plan to have my ashes burred in one of them.  Honestly it's odd I haven't had to use that urn yet.  I'm really really stupid.  But after I thawed he went out and used a long long rope to reel my car in out of the snow, filled it from a tank of gas and pointed me back towards the city.  I can only imagine the good laugh he got from defrosting such a stupid city slicker.

Anyway... aftermath...  I had a horrible burn on one leg although no skin grafts were needed.  The leg with the towel. Weirdly the map protected the other leg perfectly. The wind cut right through the towel.  I wouldn't have predicted that.  That burn still bothers me from time to time.  My toes, were an odd color but they all recovered with varying degree of crustiness and minor skin loss.  Fingers were fine (those were spectacular mitts).  Tip of my nose got a bit of a burn but it was largely spared thanks to the snorkel hood.  All in all a frankly unbelievable survival.  But if that farmer had turned up a few minutes later... well that would have been an entirely different outcome.

TLDR; I got my car stuck during a blizzard, found by a local farmer, defrosted and lived.",0,1768410880.0,tifu,13,0.37,False

I've been using my Flair 58+ alongside my 1zpresso K-Plus for about 2 years now. I am looking to upgrade coffee grinder to an automatic one.

I tried my friend's DF64 for about a week and didn't see a big difference in espresso results (but it was way easier for me to dial in and grind the coffee every morning).

I guess my question is that if I was to spend approximately 700pounds, would a niche zero be a significant improvement or is there other better grinder out there for less. Hoping to get a grinder that can last me longer.

I am considering Niche Zero because I primarily drink milk-based coffee and have a tendency for nutty and chocolatey flavours, but once in a while I do see myself getting medium/ med-light roast for the fruity notes. I generally drink one cup a day and on occasion two cups.

I know similar questions have been asked countless times, but I would like a good point of view, especially since GBP700 is a lot of money from where I am based, especially for a relatively older coffee grinder model.

I was obsessed with productivity and getting nothing done.

I had 15 productivity apps. Notion with 50 different templates. Todoist with 200 tasks organized by project and priority. Habit trackers, time trackers, focus timers, goal setting apps, everything. My phone was filled with systems designed to make me productive.

I’d spend 2 hours every Sunday planning my week in elaborate detail. Color coded calendars, time blocking every 30 minutes, detailed task lists with subtasks and dependencies. My planning system was perfect.

Then I’d execute maybe 10% of what I planned and feel like a failure.

I was 26 years old and I’d spent probably 500 hours over the past few years building productivity systems, reading productivity books, watching productivity videos, optimizing my workflow. And I was less productive than ever.

My actual work output was pathetic. I’d sit down to work and instead of working I’d reorganize my task list. Move things between projects, change priority levels, add tags, fiddle with due dates. Hours spent managing tasks instead of actually doing them.

I’d start my day reviewing my elaborate plan, feel overwhelmed by everything I needed to do, then waste the whole day procrastinating because the list was too daunting. End the day having accomplished nothing, feel guilty, restructure my system thinking that was the problem.

The more productivity tools I added, the less productive I became. The more sophisticated my systems got, the less I actually executed. I was productive at being productive, which is just another form of procrastination.

I’d watch videos about morning routines and time blocking and deep work and think “if I just implement this one more system, everything will click.” It never did. I just added more complexity that gave me more ways to avoid actual work.

My productivity obsession had become the thing preventing me from being productive.

Then I read something that broke my brain: the most productive people don’t use complicated systems, they just do the work. They don’t spend hours planning and optimizing, they spend hours executing.

I realized I’d been using productivity as performance art. I looked productive with my color coded calendars and elaborate task lists, but I was producing nothing.

So I deleted everything and committed to 60 days of zero productivity systems. No apps, no planners, no time blocking, no optimization. Just a simple rule: pick one thing, work on it until it’s done, pick the next thing.

It felt terrifying to abandon all my systems but it made me more productive than I’d been in years.

## What I actually did

**Deleted every productivity app**

Day one I deleted Notion, Todoist, Habitica, Forest, every habit tracker, every time tracker, every task manager, everything. Uninstalled them all.

Also deleted all my elaborate planning documents. Years of systems and templates and frameworks, deleted. It felt like throwing away safety nets but they weren’t helping, they were anchors.

**Created one simple system**

I needed something minimal so I didn’t just flail around. Found this app called Reload on Reddit that builds structured 60 day plans without the complexity.

It asked basic questions about my situation then created a simple day by day plan. Not 50 tasks per day, just 3-5 important things structured progressively. Wake at X time, work on Y for Z hours, exercise, read, done.

The app also blocks distracting sites during work hours which was critical because without my productivity theater I had no excuse not to actually work.

That simple structure with blocking gave me just enough guidance without the overwhelming complexity of my old systems.

**Made a rule: 3 things per day maximum**

Instead of 20 tasks organized by priority and project, I could only focus on 3 things per day. Not 3 per project, 3 total.

If I finished all 3, I could add more. But I had to finish those 3 first. No reorganizing the list, no adding subtasks, no moving things around. Pick 3, finish 3.

This forced me to actually prioritize instead of having a massive list where everything felt urgent.

**Stopped planning and started executing**

No more 2 hour Sunday planning sessions. No more daily reviews. No more weekly retrospectives. Just wake up, look at what needs to be done today, do it.

Planning had become procrastination disguised as productivity. Cutting it out removed the escape route.

**Worked in time blocks, not task blocks**

Instead of “complete this specific task” I’d set a timer for 90 minutes and work on whatever was most important. When the timer ended, break. Then another 90 minutes.

Didn’t matter if I finished the task or not. I worked for 90 minutes of focused time, that was the goal. Most days I’d do 2-3 of these blocks, that’s 3-4.5 hours of actual work. More than I was getting done in entire weeks before.

The first week I felt completely lost without my productivity systems. I’d wake up and feel anxious that I didn’t have a detailed plan.

What am I supposed to work on? How do I know if I’m being productive? How do I track my progress? My brain was freaking out.

Day 2 I almost reinstalled Notion. The urge to build a new system was overwhelming. Stopped myself by remembering that’s exactly what I was trying to quit.

Day 4 I just picked one thing and worked on it for 90 minutes. Didn’t plan it, didn’t add it to a list, didn’t time block it, just did it. Got more done in 90 minutes than I’d gotten done the entire previous week.

Day 7, one week down. I’d worked in 90 minute blocks every day and accomplished more than any week in the past 6 months. With zero productivity systems.

-----

## DAY 8-14: Started trusting the simplicity

Week two I stopped fighting the lack of structure and started trusting it.

Every morning I’d look at the simple plan Reload built, see my 3 priorities for the day, and just start working. No hour of planning, no reviewing systems, just execute.

I was doing 2-3 focused work blocks per day. 3-4.5 hours of actual deep work. Doesn’t sound like much but it was 10x more focused time than when I had elaborate systems.

Day 10 I finished a project I’d been “working on” for 3 months. Turns out when you actually work instead of organizing tasks about the work, things get done fast.

Day 14, two weeks. I’d accomplished more in two weeks than the previous two months combined. All by deleting my productivity systems and just working.

-----

## DAY 15-30: Everything accelerated

Weeks three and four my output exploded.

I was finishing projects that had been on my task list for months. Not because I was working more hours, because the hours I worked were actual focused execution instead of productivity theater.

Started my mornings with an immediate 90 minute work block. No checking email, no planning, no reviewing anything. Wake up, coffee, work. Got my highest value task done before 10am every day.

The simple 3 task per day limit forced brutal prioritization. I had to choose what actually mattered instead of having 50 things on a list where nothing got done.

Day 21, three weeks. Work that used to take me weeks was taking days because I was actually doing it instead of planning to do it.

Day 30, one month. I’d shipped 4 complete projects, cleared my entire backlog, and had more free time than when I was “optimizing” every minute.

-----

## DAY 31-45: Became actually productive

Weeks five and six I hit a level of productivity I didn’t know I was capable of.

I was doing 3 deep work blocks most days. 4.5 hours of completely focused execution. No distractions, no task switching, no productivity app hopping. Just work.

My output in those 4.5 hours was more than I used to produce in full 10 hour days of “productivity” that was mostly just organizing my systems.

Started taking on bigger projects because I knew I could actually finish them. Before I’d avoid big things because my track record was starting and never completing. Now I was finishing everything.

Day 40, people at work were asking what changed. My output had probably tripled. I told them I deleted all my productivity apps and they looked at me like I was crazy.

-----

## DAY 46-60: This became permanent

The last two weeks I knew I was never going back to complicated productivity systems.

I was accomplishing more with my simple 3 task per day rule and 90 minute work blocks than I ever did with elaborate time blocking and 200 item task lists.

My productivity was consistent. Every day, 3 things done, 3-4.5 hours of deep work. No massive planning sessions, no system optimization, just consistent execution.

The mental overhead was gone. No more spending cognitive energy managing systems. That energy went into actual work.

Day 60, two months. I’d accomplished more in 60 days than the previous 6 months. All by abandoning productivity systems and just doing the work.

-----

## What actually changed in 60 days

**My actual output tripled**

I went from finishing maybe one meaningful thing per month to finishing 2-3 per week. Not from working more hours, from actually working during work hours.

**The mental overhead disappeared**

No more energy wasted on maintaining systems, planning, tracking, organizing. That cognitive load was massive and I didn’t realize it until it was gone.

**I stopped procrastinating through productivity**

Reorganizing task lists, researching new systems, optimizing workflows, all of that was just sophisticated procrastination. Removing it forced me to face actual work.

**My free time increased**

Working 4.5 hours of focused time per day got more done than 10 hours of distracted “productivity.” I had more evening and weekend time because I was actually finishing things.

**I could take on bigger projects**

My track record went from starting things and abandoning them to finishing everything I started. That confidence let me pursue bigger goals.

**The anxiety about being productive disappeared**

The constant worry that I wasn’t productive enough was gone. I knew I was productive because I could see what I finished, not how pretty my task list looked.

**I learned what actually matters**

Having to choose only 3 things per day forced me to identify what actually moves the needle versus busywork that feels productive.

-----

## The reality, letting go was terrifying

Those first two weeks without any productivity systems felt like free falling. I’d built my identity around being someone with sophisticated productivity systems.

There were multiple times I almost went back. The urge to build a new Notion template, to time block every hour, to create detailed project plans was overwhelming.

What kept me on track was the simple structure Reload provided, the blocking of distracting sites during work time, and seeing actual results from just executing instead of planning.

-----

## If you’re used to productivity systems

Look at your actual output over the past month. Not your plans, not your task lists, what did you actually finish and ship? If the answer is disappointing, your systems aren’t working.

Delete everything. All the apps, all the templates, all the elaborate frameworks. They’re giving you the illusion of productivity while preventing actual productivity.

Use minimal structure. I used Reload which gave me just enough structure with 3-5 priorities per day and work time blocking, plus it blocked distractions during those work blocks. That’s all you need.

Limit yourself to 3 things per day. Not 3 per project, 3 total. Forces real prioritization and prevents overwhelming yourself into procrastination.

Work in time blocks, not task blocks. Commit to focused work time, not to finishing specific tasks. 90 minutes of focused work beats 8 hours of distracted task management.

Stop planning and start executing. Planning feels productive but it’s often just avoiding the actual work. Pick something important and work on it.

Track output, not input. Don’t track how many hours you worked or how many tasks you checked off. Track what you actually finished and shipped.

Give it 60 days. The first two weeks will feel chaotic. By week four you’ll see you’re accomplishing more. By week eight you’ll never want complicated systems again.

-----

## Final thoughts

60 days ago I had 15 productivity apps and elaborate systems and was getting nothing done. I spent more time optimizing my workflow than actually working.

Now I have one simple system with 3 tasks per day and 90 minute work blocks. I’ve tripled my output and have more free time. I’m actually productive instead of performing productivity.

Two months of abandoning productivity systems and just doing the work transformed my output completely.

Your elaborate Notion setup isn’t making you productive, it’s making you feel productive while you procrastinate. Your color coded calendar isn’t helping you get more done, it’s just pretty procrastination.

Delete it all. Pick 3 things per day. Work in focused time blocks. Stop planning and start executing.

The version of you with simple systems and consistent execution accomplishes more than the version with sophisticated systems and constant optimization.

Start today. Delete the productivity apps. Pick 3 things. Work for 90 minutes. See what happens when you stop trying to be productive and just produce.

The church rose from the Alabama red clay like a promise made of glass and steel.

David Walker eased off the gas as they crested the last hill, the massive structure coming into view through a break in the trees. Sunlight flashed off the building’s curved façade, silver-white glare that made him squint. It was too big for the town, too polished, too deliberate—like something imported and dropped here as a statement. The parking lots spread outward in disciplined rows, already filling with cars despite the early hour: trucks with mud on the wheel wells, SUVs with kids’ stickers on the back, sedans clean enough to reflect the sky. Many carried decals bearing scripture or the church’s insignia—a stylized flame cradled in open hands.

“Wow,” Sophie said from the back seat, craning her neck until her ponytail pulled tight. “It’s like… a stadium.”

Lisa smiled, her fingers tightening around a folded pamphlet she’d picked up at a diner earlier in the week. It sat in her lap like a ticket to something she wanted to believe in.

“They say thousands come every Sunday,” she said. “People drive hours.”

Emma said nothing.

David noticed that immediately. Emma always had something to say. Sharp, quick, observant—especially about places like this. She’d had an instinct for performance since she was ten. She could tell when a teacher was bluffing, when a friend was lying, when someone smiled with teeth but no warmth.

Now she stared straight ahead, her reflection ghosting faintly in the windshield. Her jaw was set. Not afraid. Appraising. Like she was making a silent list.

That made David’s skin prickle more than if she’d rolled her eyes.

They merged into the flow of cars and followed a volunteer waving an orange flag. The volunteer was a kid—maybe seventeen—lean and bright-eyed, wearing a navy polo with HOLY COVENANT stitched over the heart and a headset like he belonged to something bigger than a church. He moved with the confidence of someone who believed his job mattered.

David parked and killed the engine. For a moment, the truck settled with a soft creak. No one moved. The air outside was cool, carrying that damp Alabama scent of pine and clay and distant water.

Lisa exhaled first, like she’d been holding her breath since they’d left the house.

“This is good,” she said quietly. “This is what we needed.”

David didn’t answer. He slid his sunglasses on and stepped out.

The sound hit him immediately—music, muffled but strong, vibrating through the air like a heartbeat. Bass and drums and voices. It wasn’t hymns. It was engineered atmosphere.

They joined the stream of people heading toward the main entrance. Volunteers lined the walkway, smiling too broadly, touching shoulders and elbows with practiced warmth. A woman in her forties clasped Lisa’s hands as if greeting a long-lost friend.

“Welcome home,” the woman said, eyes shining. Her nails were pale pink, perfect. “Oh honey, you picked the right Sunday.”

The word home landed wrong in David’s gut.

Lisa’s smile wavered for half a second—caught between comfort and surprise—then she leaned into it because she wanted it. She wanted a place where she didn’t have to explain herself, where grief and fear came prepackaged with solutions.

“Thank you,” Lisa said. “We’re new in town.”

“Well praise God for that,” the woman replied, squeezing a fraction harder, then releasing. “I’m Marlene. We’re going to get you settled. You have kids?”

Lisa gestured behind her. “Emma and Sophie.”

Marlene’s attention shifted with a smoothness that made David think of a spotlight moving on a stage.

“Emma,” she said, and it wasn’t a question. She studied her like she was already deciding something. “You’re the oldest.”

Emma’s mouth twitched. “Is it that obvious?”

Marlene laughed, delighted. “It is to a mother. You’ll see. We have a young adults program. Plenty of girls your age. You’ll be surrounded by sisters.”

Emma gave a polite nod that didn’t reach her eyes.

David stepped slightly forward, subtle, blocking angle without looking like he was blocking anything. Marlene’s eyes flicked to him, measuring.

“And you must be David,” she said.

Lisa stiffened. “How—”

Marlene held up the pamphlet, tapping it lightly. “You filled out the online visitor form, sweetheart. Our welcome team gets the names. Don’t worry—we’re just excited you’re here.”

Lisa smiled again. It was relief, not suspicion.

David’s pulse didn’t change. He didn’t like being known before he introduced himself.

Inside, the sanctuary swallowed them whole.

It was cavernous, ceiling soaring into darkness where lights were rigged like a concert venue. The stage was massive, flanked by screens the size of billboards. The worship band played with professional precision—guitars, keys, drums—and the crowd moved like one organism, hands raised, eyes closed, faces tilted toward the stage as if toward weather.

The music surged and dipped, designed to pull emotion up from the gut. It reminded David of something he’d once read about interrogation rooms—how you could use sound, repetition, rhythm to soften resistance.

He hated that his brain went there.

They found seats mid-section. Lisa sat quickly, like she didn’t want to miss a moment. Sophie slid in beside her, wide-eyed, swaying slightly with the music like it was pulling her.

Emma stayed standing a beat longer.

David stayed standing longer than that.

He scanned exits. Counted cameras. Noticed the men in dark suits posted at the periphery—too still to be ushers, too alert to be volunteers. Their eyes weren’t on the stage. They were on the people.

Emma leaned toward him. “Dad.”

“Yeah.”

“Do you see—”

“Yes,” he said quietly.

On stage, Pastor Gideon Graves stepped forward.

The band softened instantly, like someone had turned a dial. The room followed, sound folding into anticipation. Gideon raised his arms wide, smile radiant and practiced, and the crowd responded as if he’d physically lifted them.

He was handsome in that sculpted, deliberate way—early fifties maybe, hair too perfect to be natural, teeth too white. He wore a tailored charcoal suit with no tie, microphone clipped discreetly along his cheek. His eyes were sharp even when he smiled.

“Good morning, Holy Covenant,” he said.

The room erupted. Thousands of voices. People stood. Hands clapped. Some cried already.

David felt something cold settle behind his ribs.

Gideon waited until the noise tapered, then leaned in slightly, as if confiding.

“Miracles,” he said, “are not given. They are earned.”

The congregation roared approval.

Lisa’s hand found David’s forearm. Not gripping—anchoring. Her face glowed with that vulnerable hope she’d been carrying like a bruise since the move.

Gideon spoke about faith like it was a weapon you sharpened. He told stories about illness cured, marriages restored, debt erased. Each story landed with specific names and specific details—the kind that sounded true because they were too particular to be made up.

David listened for the seams.

He found them anyway.

Not in the stories themselves, but in the structure. The way Gideon built tension, then released it. The way he paused before key phrases, letting the crowd fill in the emotion. The way the screens cut to close-ups of faces in the audience at exactly the right moments—tears, hands trembling, mouths whispering prayers. The camera chose them too perfectly.

A production.

Then Gideon’s voice sharpened.

“But the enemy doesn’t fear your comfort,” he said. “He fears your obedience.”

People murmured. Some shouted Amen.

“Obedience is the door,” Gideon continued. “Surrender is the key. And when you give God control—when you stop clinging to your own will—miracles don’t just happen. They break through.”

On the screens, a verse appeared. It flashed, bold, easy to read. Under it, the church insignia glowed.

David glanced sideways at Emma. She was listening hard now, chin slightly lifted.

Not buying, necessarily. But engaged.

That worried him more than if she’d looked bored.

After the sermon, Gideon smiled again, and the temperature of the room changed with him.

“Now,” he said, “we’re going to see what God is doing in this house.”

The band resumed, softer—strings this time, something swelling and reverent. Gideon invited people to come forward for prayer. The aisles filled immediately.

David watched the movement. Volunteers guided people like traffic control, smiling, touching, murmuring encouragement. The men in suits shifted subtly, creating a perimeter.

A woman in a wheelchair was rolled up first. She was older, thin, with a scarf wrapped around her head. Her face was wet with tears.

Gideon crouched beside her, took her hands like he was holding something holy.

“What’s your name, sweetheart?” he asked.

“Barbara,” she whispered.

“And what do you need God to do for you today, Barbara?”

“My legs,” she said. “My legs… I want to walk.”

The crowd gasped like they were hearing something sacred.

Gideon nodded solemnly. He placed a hand on her knee. Another on her shoulder. He closed his eyes.

David watched the men behind her. Two volunteers, both female, one on either side of the chair. Their grips looked supportive.

But their hands were placed exactly where you’d place them to control movement.

Gideon began to pray, voice rising, cadence accelerating. The music swelled with him. The crowd joined, wave after wave of sound.

“Stand,” Gideon commanded suddenly, snapping the word like a trigger.

Barbara’s body jerked as if startled. The volunteers leaned in, and for a second David couldn’t tell if they were helping or lifting.

Barbara’s feet touched the stage.

Her knees wobbled.

The crowd screamed.

“Walk,” Gideon said, louder.

Barbara took a step.

It was small, trembling. Another. Her face contorted with effort and emotion.

Lisa’s breath caught. She pressed a hand to her mouth.

Sophie whispered, “Oh my God.”

Emma didn’t speak. Her eyes narrowed slightly.

Barbara took three more steps. Gideon backed away, arms raised, letting the moment belong to the crowd.

People were sobbing openly. A man two rows ahead dropped to his knees. A woman near the aisle shook like she was having a seizure.

David felt nothing except a careful, cold focus.

He’d seen men stand on broken legs because adrenaline didn’t give them a choice.

He’d seen pain ignored in the moment and paid later.

And he’d seen performances designed to make you believe your own eyes more than your own mind.

Barbara was crying too hard to notice whether her feet were dragging. Whether the volunteers were still touching her, just lightly enough for the camera to miss.

Gideon hugged her. The crowd roared again.

The next “miracle” was a young man with a stutter. Gideon spoke over him, guiding his words, repeating phrases until the man’s stammer smoothed under pressure and adrenaline. The congregation cheered as if the Holy Spirit had rewired his tongue.

Then a woman who claimed depression, collapsing into tears as Gideon prayed. Volunteers caught her as she fell—gently, expertly—lowering her to the ground with practiced ease. She lay there shaking, and the camera lingered on her face.

David’s hands curled into fists.

It wasn’t the prayer that bothered him.

It was the choreography.

Afterward, Gideon’s tone softened again, and he spoke directly to newcomers.

“If you’re visiting for the first time,” he said, smiling into the camera, “we see you. We honor you. We believe you didn’t come here by accident.”

Lisa straightened, like the words were aimed at her personally.

“We have a special welcome area after service,” Gideon continued. “We want to meet you. We want to pray with you. We want to introduce you to your new family.”

New family.

There it was again.

David’s eyes flicked to the men in suits as the service began to close. They were already moving, subtly, positioning themselves near aisles like shepherd dogs preparing to guide the herd.

When the final song ended, the crowd lingered. People hugged. Volunteers handed out water bottles and small cards with Gideon’s face and a verse printed beneath it. The cards included a QR code.

Sophie took one, smiling politely. Lisa took one with gratitude.

Emma didn’t take one.

Marlene appeared again as if summoned, weaving through the crowd with surprising speed.

“There you are!” she said, beaming. “I’ve been looking for you.”

Lisa laughed. “We just got out.”

“Well, you’re here now.” Marlene’s hand settled on Lisa’s back, steering gently. “Come on, we have a welcome lounge. Snacks, coffee. Pastor Gideon loves to meet the new folks.”

David opened his mouth to decline.

Lisa didn’t let him.

“It’ll be fine,” she said softly, almost pleading. “Just… let’s be polite.”

David looked at her. The woman he married was still there, behind the hope and the strain. She was tired. She wanted something to work.

He swallowed whatever warning wanted to rise.

“Sure,” he said.

The welcome lounge was a separate room off the main corridor—bright, modern, full of smiling faces. A wall displayed photos of baptisms and mission trips and “testimonies.” Another wall held a map of the church’s property—so large it looked like a small city, the boundaries extending deep into the surrounding woods.

David stared at it longer than he meant to.

Marlene noticed. “Isn’t it something?” she said proudly. “God has blessed this ministry. We have trails, retreat cabins, prayer gardens… and of course the sanctuary is just the beginning.”

“How much land is it?” David asked.

Marlene beamed. “Thousands of acres. Pastor Gideon says it was all providence. The previous owner practically gave it away.”

“Who was the previous owner?”

Marlene’s smile didn’t falter, but something in her eyes shifted. “Oh, just some old family. They kept to themselves. This land… it was wasted on them. Now it’s being used for the Kingdom.”

David nodded like that satisfied him.

It didn’t.

A volunteer offered them coffee. Another offered pastries. People came up one after another, introducing themselves, asking where the Walkers lived, what David did for work, how long they’d been in town. The friendliness wasn’t casual—it was structured. Each question felt like a box being checked.

Lisa answered, smiling, grateful.

David gave minimal information.

Emma hovered slightly behind Sophie, gaze flicking around the room like she was tracking exits too.

A young woman in her late twenties approached Emma with a bright smile. She wore the same navy polo as the parking volunteer, but hers fit like it was tailored. She had a lanyard with a badge that read: JENNA — YOUNG ADULTS COORDINATOR.

“Emma, right?” Jenna said.

Emma’s brows lifted. “Yeah. How’d you—”

Jenna tapped her badge lightly. “Welcome team. I told Marlene I wanted to meet you. We don’t get a lot of new girls your age who look like they’re thinking three steps ahead.”

Emma gave a small, unwilling smile. “Is that a compliment or a warning?”

Jenna laughed like they were already friends. “It’s a compliment. Mostly. Listen—if you’re going to survive here, you need a place to breathe. We have a young adults group on Tuesdays. Real conversations. Not just… church-speak.”

Emma’s gaze sharpened. “Do you talk like this to everyone?”

Jenna leaned in a fraction, lowering her voice. “No. Just the ones who look like they might bolt.”

Emma looked at David.

David had been watching them from the corner of his eye. He met Emma’s glance and gave a subtle shake of his head.

Emma turned back to Jenna. “Maybe,” she said. “We’ll see.”

Jenna nodded like she expected that answer. “Good. I’ll be around.”

She slipped away, and Emma watched her go.

Sophie tugged at Emma’s sleeve. “She seems nice.”

Emma shrugged. “She seems trained.”

Sophie frowned. “Trained for what?”

Emma didn’t answer.

A moment later, the room quieted slightly—not because someone asked for attention, but because the air changed. People shifted. Smiles tightened. Bodies angled toward the entrance.

Gideon Graves walked in.

Up close, he was even more polished. He moved through the room like he owned the space, like the air made room for him. His smile was warm and effortless.

He shook hands, hugged people, called several by name. When he reached the Walkers, Marlene practically glowed.

“Pastor Gideon,” she said, “this is the Walker family I told you about. New in town.”

Gideon’s gaze landed on Lisa first. His eyes softened, reading her like a book he’d already finished.

“Lisa,” he said, and it wasn’t a guess.

Lisa blinked, startled. “Yes.”

“Welcome,” Gideon said, taking both her hands. “I’m so glad you’re here. There are no accidents in God’s timing.”

Lisa’s throat worked. “Thank you. The service was… powerful.”

Gideon smiled gently. “Powerful is just the beginning.”

His eyes moved to Sophie. “And you must be Sophie.”

Sophie nodded, suddenly shy. “Yes, sir.”

“Not sir,” Gideon said softly, smiling. “Family. We’re family here.”

Then he looked at David.

The warmth remained, but it changed shape—less comfort, more assessment.

“And David,” Gideon said. “I’ve heard about you.”

David’s posture didn’t shift, but every muscle in his body tightened.

“Have you,” David replied.

Gideon chuckled lightly, like David had made a joke. “This town talks. They’re excited to have you. A man who served. A protector.”

David didn’t like the word protector in Gideon’s mouth.

Lisa laughed nervously. “David’s been… settling in.”

Gideon nodded. “That can be hard. Men like you carry things most people never see.”

David’s face stayed neutral, but something inside him flared. That wasn’t something strangers said. Not unless they were fishing.

Gideon turned slightly, including Emma in his view.

“And you,” he said, smile widening. “Emma.”

Emma’s chin lifted. “Hi.”

Gideon studied her for a beat longer than polite. Then he nodded, almost approving.

“You’re strong,” he said. “I can tell.”

Emma’s mouth tightened. “I don’t know you.”

Gideon laughed softly, like he respected that. “No. But God knows you. And I know the kind of young woman this world tries to break.”

David stepped half an inch forward without meaning to.

Gideon’s gaze flicked to David, then back to Emma.

“You’ll find your place here,” Gideon said. “All of you will.”

He released Lisa’s hands and clapped David’s shoulder—firm, familiar, like they were already connected.

“Come see me,” Gideon said. “Anytime. My door is open.”

David forced a nod.

Gideon moved on, swallowed by the crowd again.

Lisa looked like she might cry from gratitude.

David felt only the lingering weight of Gideon’s hand on his shoulder—as if the contact had been a claim.

They left the welcome lounge a few minutes later, Lisa still smiling, Sophie talking excitedly about the music, the screens, the people.

Emma walked quietly beside David.

As they passed the main corridor, David noticed a side hallway blocked by a velvet rope and a sign that read: AUTHORIZED PERSONNEL ONLY. Beyond it, the corridor ran into shadow, lit dimly. Two men in suits stood near the entrance, scanning the flow of people.

David slowed, eyes narrowing.

Emma followed his gaze. “What is that?” she murmured.

“Something they don’t want visitors to see,” David said.

“Should we ask?” Sophie asked, oblivious.

“No,” David said quickly.

Lisa glanced back, confused. “David, don’t start.”

“I’m not starting anything,” he said, forcing his voice down. “Just… pay attention.”

Lisa’s smile faltered. She didn’t want attention. She wanted peace.

They stepped outside into the sunlight. The air smelled like pine and heat and something faintly metallic from the parking lot.

As they walked toward the truck, Emma lagged behind for a moment, looking back at the building.

David noticed. He slowed too, watching her profile.

“What are you thinking?” he asked.

Emma blinked like she hadn’t realized he was watching her.

“I don’t know,” she said carefully. “It feels like… everyone wants something.”

Lisa turned, calling, “Emma?”

Emma forced a smile and jogged to catch up.

David stayed still for a beat longer, eyes on the church.

In the distance, beyond the main building, the property stretched toward the woods. The tree line was dense, dark green, swallowing everything behind it. A narrow service road disappeared into that wall of trees, marked by a small sign David could barely read from here.

PRIVATE ACCESS.

NO TRESPASSING.

He watched a golf cart roll down that road, driven by one of the navy polo volunteers. In the passenger seat sat a man in a dark suit, posture rigid, head turned slightly as if scanning the woods.

The cart vanished into the trees.

David’s mouth went dry.

He climbed into the truck, started the engine, and pulled out of the lot.

Lisa chattered about how kind everyone was, how maybe this was the fresh start they’d needed.

Sophie hummed along to a song still stuck in her head.

Emma stared out the window, silent again.

David drove with both hands on the wheel, eyes flicking to the rearview mirror more than they needed to.

Because even as they left, he couldn’t shake the feeling that the church hadn’t just welcomed them.

It had seen them.

And once something like that saw you, it didn’t stop watching.

At the edge of the road, as the church disappeared behind trees, David glanced at Emma.

She was rubbing her thumb against the inside of her wrist—small, repetitive motion.

A self-soothing habit she’d had as a child.

He hadn’t seen it in years.

“Emma,” he said quietly.

She looked at him.

“Don’t go anywhere alone,” David said. “Not here.”

Her eyes hardened, defensive. “Dad, you’re being weird.”

“I’m being careful,” he replied.

Emma held his gaze for a beat.

Then she looked away and said, almost too soft to hear, “Okay.”

David faced forward again, but the cold behind his ribs didn’t move.

It only settled deeper, like something preparing to grow.

And somewhere back there, behind the glass and steel, behind the smiling volunteers and the staged miracles, Gideon Graves continued shaking hands—warm, practiced, gentle.

A shepherd among sheep.

Already counting what had just wandered into his pasture.

1. After i do an interview, i usually sit by the side of the road or in a cafe. i feel this feeling. normally, i would go back home or enjoy sitting alone with coffee and cigarettes, but i don’t enjoy either.
2. I play my favorite online games. it’s pvp. I get this weird feeling too, like a robotic feeling. if i win, i feel a bit happy, if i lose, i feel flat. usually, i feel angry and then have motivation to play again.
3. When i play online fighting games, i can feel the adrenaline, but at the same time i also feel this weird feeling, a combination of adrenaline or enthusiasm to win and an uneasy feeling.
4. this feeling doesn’t make me lazy about basic things like eating, taking a bath, or cleaning my room, but it is uncomfortable.
5. this is not depression, or maybe it is, but i can still feel joy on some activities
6. i suspect this is anxiety, but i don’t know what i’m anxious about or what the cause is.

1qcsuck,https://www.reddit.com/r/FODMAPS/comments/1qcsuck/new_to_fodmaps_and_i_have_some_questions/,New to FODMAPs and I have some questions.,"I'm currently on an antibiotic to treat SIBO. After the treatment my doctor wants me to go on low FODMAP diet. He gave me a printout, but I've been doing my own research and have the Monash app which I understand is a better source of information. 

I'm coming from the Acid Watcher diet. Coming from that diet the low FODMAP diet doesn't seem all that bad (I've already cut out onions, garlic, cows milk, chocolate etc), but I understand that portion sizes are extremely important with FODMAPs. 

I've been putting in some of my regular breakfasts and snacks into the FODMAP app and was hoping someone could check me that I have the right idea. 

For ingredients, nothing has high fructose corn syrup in it. I don't use artificial sweeteners. Almond milk has just 3 ingredients: water, almonds, salt. No thickeners. 

  
**Breakfast #1**

2 Scrambled Eggs - low up to 117g

2 slices of Cheddar Cheese - low up to 40g

2 slices Whole Wheat Toast - low up to 22g (half a slice). High in fructan. Replace with Sourdough bread which is low up to 109g. 

Butter for toast - low up to 20g/1tbsp. High in lactose. 

Olive Oil for cooking - low up to 18g

**Breakfast #2**

1/2c Oatmeal - low up to 52g (1/2c) uncooked. High in GOS. 

1/2c Almond Milk - low up to 287g (1c)

1 Banana - low up to 95g (1 medium peeled). High in Fructan. 

10-15 Blueberries - low up to 1 cup (about 40 berries)

drizzle of maple syrup - low up to 50g

4-5 walnut halves - low up to 30g (15 halves). High in GOS.

  
For breakfast #1, I should be good as long as I replace the whole wheat toast with sourdough, right? I just have to stay under the 109g limit and it has to be true long fermented sourdough. 

For breakfast #2, the oatmeal and the walnuts are both under the limit, but they both have GOS so how does that work since I'm eating both at the same time? 

\* How does snacking factor in when tracking FODMAPs? For example, say I eat this 3 hours after I eat breakfast where I already consumed food with fructan? Is that okay or will there be a cumulative effect? 

2 tbsp chia seeds - low up to 30g (2tbsp) - High in Fructan. 

1/2c Almond Milk - low up to 287g (1c)

drizzle of maple syrup - low up to 50g

1 tbsp of Peanut Butter - low up to 32g (1tbsp)

\* White sugar is really okay? So a black coffee with 1 tsp of sugar and almond milk is considered low FODMAP? 

\* On alcohol, the app says one beer (375ml) is low FODMAP. Ignoring all the other effects of alcohol on the GI system, does it matter which type of beer? I understand that beers with fruit or sweet adjuncts are probably not low FODMAP, but what about pilsner vs. ipa?

Mom says we came out looking like a pair of grapes. Our lips and skin were dyed a dull bluish-purple, and she could almost fit both of us in the palm of her hand. It's an outrageously gentle way of describing two premature babies in the process of suffocating, but I guess that’s Mom for you. 

Put more bluntly, Henry and I were born on death's door.

We couldn’t breathe, not on our own, not with the equipment that God loaned us. Machines were tasked with breathing for us in the neonatal ICU. Tubes as thin as coffee straws pumped microscopic gulps of fresh air down our throats, offloading our immature lungs, giving them space to rest and develop. For a little while, it seemed like the worst was over. Seemed like we both would live. Seemed like we’d both be normal.    

Then, I bled into my brain. 

The vessels were too young, too fragile. One of them snapped. Blood pooled quickly, crushing whole sections of my brain against the inside of my skull. The surgeons told Mom I had a fifty percent chance of survival, but I’d almost certainly be damaged goods if I did pull through. 

When our tempers flare, Henry likes to speculate.

He thinks that if I *hadn't* survived, Dad may have decided to stick around. Maybe he wouldn’t have gotten so overwhelmed. Perhaps he could have stomached the burden of a single, normal kid. Forces me to remind him that Dad bolted for the border the day we were born, a full week before my brain bled. He sprinted from the delivery room at the mere sight of us - his grape-skinned, breathless, keychain babies.

That said, cerebral palsy and deafness aren’t the worst cards I could've been dealt.

So what if my ears don’t work? So what if my muscles aren’t perfect? It is what it is. If we’re to blame for Dad’s abandonment, then so be it, but I won’t shoulder the blame alone. I mean, that’s what twins do, right? We split the world down the middle and share it equally, including the shitty parts? *Especially* the shitty parts?

Anyway...

Last week, for the first time in fifteen years, I heard something.

I heard *them*. 

Digging through the earth, burrowing towards the surface. 

Coming to hollow us out. 

\- - - - -

***48 hours before they arrived:***

My eyes shot open. 

There was a strange pressure in my skull, a thrumming beneath my temples. 

Terror chewed through my chest. I launched myself from bed, strapped on my arm braces, and scrambled into the hallway to pound on Grandpa’s door. Mom would come running at the slightest noise, but Grandpa slept like a corpse.

The drive to the emergency room was torture. I had no idea what was happening inside my skull. I assumed my brain was bleeding. That murderous vessel was deadset on finishing the job.

Henry bitched in the waiting room for hours because Mom wouldn’t let him stay home alone. He was convinced the sensation was “psychological”. Kept repeating the phrase “it’s just another Felix freak-out”. My brother didn’t just say it, either: he said it *and* signed it. Could have spared me the heartache by just whispering it when my head was turned, but no, he had to twist the knife.

It hurt even more when it started to seem like Henry was right. 

My physical exam was unremarkable. My bloodwork was fine. The CT scan didn’t show any blood sloshing around my brain. The doctor’s best guess? Sinus infection. 

A fucking *sinus infection*. 

Listen, I don’t blame that doctor; she was nice, and she tried. The idea that I could be hearing again would have been an outlandish hypothesis. Wasn't like I was much help, either. I had no experience with noise. I mean, I understood it conceptually. I knew the words - *screech, thud, buzz, boom, thump* \- but that’s all they were to me: words. Names of famous celebrities whose faces I’ve never seen. 

Touch felt like a cousin to sound, so I pictured hearing was like having a set of big, invisible fingertips. Maybe a shrill noise feels like touching a hot stove. Maybe a soft noise is like running my fingers over a clean, silk pillowcase. 

And what did *this* noise feel like, this thrumming below my temples?

Well, I was rummaging through the attic last year, digging through winter clothes, hunting for a lost sweater. When I finally found it and held it up, something shifted near the collar. A massive, black cockroach leapt out from the inside of that sweater. It landed on my cheek and skittered down the side of my neck before falling to floor and disappearing into the shadows. 

Chaotic.

Impulsive.

Unpredictable, restless, and willing to eat anything, exactly like a cockroach. 

*That’s* what it felt like. 

\- - - - -

***10 hours before they arrived:***

Henry shoved a forkful of roast beef into his mouth before he started complaining to Mom. Talking and chewing at the same time made it difficult for me to read his lips: it was all too sloppy. Henry loved pretending like he'd forgotten that fact.

I didn’t catch everything he said. 

“Why - - - coddling him? You - - - care of him forever - - - not my job - - - protect him.”

*If you’re going to talk about him, in front of him, you damn well better have the respect to let him know what you’re saying, Henry* \- my Mom signed. Her hands moved forcefully, as if an evaluator was hiding somewhere in the room, covertly grading her clarity and technique. One of her chipped gel nails flew across the room as she signed the word *respect*. 

Shame writhed like a serpent stuck in my gut. I looked to Grandpa. He was scooping his fork over the table, trying to wrassle some meat, missing the plate again and again. My Mom’s anxious eyes caught me looking to him for comfort. Sometimes it felt like she couldn’t stop watching me, even if she wanted to. 

“PHIL!” 

“Hmm...?” he replied, still focused on fishing some dinner from his plate. 

“Your glasses?” Grandpa furrowed his brow. Then, there was a burst of recognition, a *Eureka!* moment. I could practically see the dusty light bulb flicker dimly above his head. 

“Oh! Right, right, right...” A pair of thick glasses rested on his sternum, hanging from his neck via a gold chain. Mom made sure he was always wearing the necklace, but he would often take off the glasses and forget they were there anyway. He patted his shirt until his hand stumbled upon the glasses, then slid them on. His face broke into a warm, genuine smile, finally able to see us.

*How was your day, Grandpa?* \- I signed. 

*Pretty good! Another beautiful afternoon to be delivering mail. Just between us, I think Miss. Hudson has the hots for me - don’t tattle to her husband, though, alright?* 

He blew imaginary smoke from a pair of finger guns and winked at me. I forced a grin and nodded. Henry's face contorted into a scowl, gaze fixed on his mashed potatoes, stirring them harshly. 

Grandpa was long retired. He hadn’t delivered mail in years.

Age had taken a toll on his mind. His memory had become like the weather: clear one day, cloudy the next, and the forecast could change on a dime. Despite his senility, the seventy-six-year-old was remarkably spry, lean, and energetic. On good days, I was happy to know that at least his body was still intact, but on shittier days, his situation just tasted like a bitter irony. He had beautifully maintained machinery, but he wasn’t always behind the wheel. I was beyond grateful that his ASL remained intact, but, perhaps more than anything else, I feared the inevitable day that would no longer be the case. 

I speared a mushy tuft of steamed broccoli onto my fork. My hand abruptly went from steady to trembling.

All day, the pressure had been sharpening, accelerating, intensifying. I looked around the dinner table. Nobody else appeared to notice. All the tests were normal. It was my sinuses. It *had* to be my sinuses. 

Try as I might, I couldn’t buy my own story, and Mom could smell the panic burning beneath my skin.

*Are you okay? How’s your head?*  \- she signed. 

I pointed a half-hearted thumbs-up in her direction. How could burden her with the truth?

Hadn't she suffered enough already?

*See? He’s fine. He’s strong. Quit worrying.* \- Henry signed. 

I suppressed the urge to smile. 

When I looked back at my plate, I realized Grandpa wasn’t eating. He was staring absentmindedly at the floor, head turned towards me. His glasses had slipped into his baggy T-shirt, tenting the fabric at his chest. He was muttering to himself. I couldn’t make out most of the words, and what I did catch made no sense.

“Dirty little - - - squishing around - - - tangled, tangled - - - disgusting, tiny, tangled strings” 

I did catch one phrase for certain. It was the last thing he muttered before becoming silent.

“I see you.” 

\- - - - -

***30 seconds before they arrived***\*:\*

As we drove through town, the cryptic pressure in my head burst unexpectedly. Reminded me of popping an inflamed zit. There was a blip of pain, yes, but it was followed by rush of blissful relief. 

I turned to Henry. He had his head leaning against the window, jaw stiff, shoulders tensed to his ears. Guess I had a big, doofy smile on my face, because he shot back a mocking look. Tongue out. Eyes crossed. I imagine he would’ve flipped me the bird if we weren’t in the car with Mom. 

He was livid. We were an hour late for his soccer game. 

Both grandpa and I can be tricky to mobilize. Did we take our meds? Do we have our necessary outside-the-house gear? Plus, we just move *slow*. It’s a miracle if we’re only fifteen minutes late for any given appointment. I wasn’t the issue that morning, though. I knew better than to be unprepared on game day. Nothing aggravates Henry more. 

No, there was something wrong with Grandpa. 

Mom told me he was feeling under the weather. He didn’t look sick, though. He looked vacant. Not his usual, diet-dementia aloofness, either. He looked like his soul had departed his body. His glasses had gone missing, too. 

And he was still muttering nonsense under his breath.

Our beat-up sedan lurched to a clunky stop at a red light. I racked my brain, coming with ways I could support Henry. 

I could make sure he stays hydrated? 

The light turned green. Our car wobbled forward. 

Or maybe I'd give him permission to lie to his teammates. Henry could tell them he was late on my account. That’d be bad for me in the short term, but it’d probably be easier for him to explain than whatever the hell was going on with Grandpa...

We came to a sudden, jagged halt. 

Old coffee cups flew from their cupholders, drenching the dashboard in stagnant brown liquid as the soggy cardboard fell apart. My seat belt became rigid, biting into my chest to keep me in place. My woozy heart thundered into back of my throat.

We’d stopped at the end of a narrow, one-way street hemmed in by two monolithic brick buildings. The right bumper was tilted down, and the tire was stuck. 

Mom turned and signed: *STAY.* She stepped out to check the damage. My body trembled, nearly convulsing from the surprise of it all.

Henry grabbed my hand. 

He dragged his thumb along the underside of my wrist, slow and steady. I felt myself becoming grounded. Outside, Mom was staring at the hood, scratching the back of her head. She peered through the window and gestured:

*Pothole? Or...sinkhole? Can’t tell. It’s very deep. Stay in the car, I’m calling the police.* 

My breathing became ragged. A deluge of adrenaline flooded through my veins. 

The pressure hadn't left me.

Suddenly, it was coming back, and it was coming back different.

When Henry and I were young, before he was fed up with my existence, before he saw me as this loathsome, pitiable burden, we loved the arcade. It was a place where we were equal, despite my brokenness. Every afternoon, we would scour the house for quarters, hoping against hope we would find a cache of loose change between some couch cushions or in a pair of Grandpa’s pants. If we were successful, we’d celebrate by shaking handfuls of coins as if our closed fists were macarenas. 

The pressure was like *that*. 

Rapid, rhythmic clinking. 

And, God, it was pressing in on me from every direction.

Grandpa leapt from the passenger’s seat and onto the sidewalk. He twisted around in manic circles, batting at the empty air around his legs, saliva dripping down the corner of his mouth, repeating the same word so violently that even I could tell what he was saying. 

**“WORMS.”**

**“WORMS.”**

**“WORMS.”**

Henry dug his nails into my flesh.

Mom dropped the phone from her ear. She stood by the bumper, dumbstruck, panic setting in thick. Her head kept darting between the car and Grandpa. I didn’t understand. I pointed wildly towards Grandpa, desperate to focus her attention. In his frenzy, he was getting closer and closer to the end of the one-way. He was going to spill out onto the busy road, and then, who knows? The man was basically blind without his glasses. 

Why, God, *why* wasn’t she running to save him? 

Henry yanked my arm, trying to pull me towards him. 

I spun to look at him. His face was drained of color, paler than fog. His eyes were bulging from their sockets. Never in my life had I seen my brother more petrified, and he wasn’t looking out the front of the car; he was staring at something right outside *my* window. 

The clinking noise was deafening. It filled my broken ears and left room for nothing else. 

I couldn’t hear the slack-jawed, dead-eyed man, silently slamming his limp arms against the glass, one after the other, an endless, hypnotic barrage. 

And the glass was starting to splinter. 

I couldn’t move. It wasn’t just terror that rooted me to the seat. I was mesmerized by the vibrations under his skin. The flesh expanded. Spaghetti-thick cords would rise across every inch of his body. There was no order to their arrangement. They weren’t stationed in parallel or in a neat cross-stitch. They were a chaotic, tangled mess. A second later, the cords retracted, and his skin appeared normal. 

Expand. **Clink.** 

He threw his flaccid arm over his shoulder.

Retract. **Clink.** 

It fell like a meteor, helpless to gravity, and shattered the window. A hailstorm of glass engulfed me. He moved to lean his head into the car. 

Mom bounded into view and tackled him at the waist. 

The clinking ceased. 

The world was silent once more. 

I gripped the edge of the broken window and threw my head out. Glass dug into my palms, but I barely felt any pain. 

I needed to see that Mom was OK.

Relief surged out of in a single, shaky breath.

She was kneeling on the narrow sidewalk, stunned, trembling, but intact. What was left of the man lay in front of her. 

He wasn’t dead. Dead isn’t the right word. 

The man shattered like a ceramic pot. 

The collision had tossed him into the brick wall of the nearby building, and the impact had broken him into two large pieces - one from the chest-up, the other from the waist-down. Dozens of other, smaller pieces were scattered around him: thin, rattling shards of dry human pottery.

He was empty on the inside. No guts, no blood, no heart: nothing at all. 

The worms had hollowed him out.

Mom turned, looked me in the eyes, and shot me a weak, world-weary smile. Somehow, she knew. If she stayed still, she could buy us time. She could make damn sure we got away. 

Her hands reached up to sign. 

The man’s shattered body seized. The clinking resumed with a hellish ferocity.

I couldn’t see them, but I could hear them, I could track their movements, getting closer, and closer, and closer to my Mom. Henry was behind me, reaching over my shoulder, stretching his hand out to pull her in, to keep her safe. 

I pushed him back. 

The clinking was upon her. She screamed, I think. Her mouth grew wide, her jaw became slack. They were infiltrating her. Hollowing her body until there was nothing left. 

Enough of her lingered to sign six final words.

*Take care of your brother, Felix.* 

Her fingers contorted into a bevy of unnatural, inhuman shapes. Her body went limp. 

Then, she began to pulse. 

Expand. **Clink.** 

Retract. **Clink.** 

For maybe the first time in our lives, Henry followed my lead. 

I shoved him out of the far door.

He put his arm around me, and we left.

I don’t know for sure that Grandpa’s dead, but I hope he is. 

Because if his hearts still beating, that means he’s either alone, scared, and confused, 

or hollowed out and somehow still alive. 

\- - - - -

For now, it seems like we're safe.

I was able to guide us out of town, avoiding the worms like landmines. They seem to cluster together and wait for victims, hiding in plain sight, but the only time they stop moving appears to be right before they leave or enter a host. Otherwise, they're always moving, which means I can hear them.

Everyone’s gone. The entire town is empty.

We passed by hundreds of tire-sized holes in the ground. I threw a quarter down one of them. Henry said he never heard it hit the bottom.

I think the hollowed-outs slid down those holes. Don’t know where else they would’ve gone.

I don’t know why they’ve awakened from their dormancy deep within the earth, but I suppose it doesn’t matter. They’re here now. 

These things are a living paradox. 

Only the blind can see them.

Only the deaf can hear them. 

Nests of them writhed across my town's streets, through layers of salt deposited for a snowstorm that never came. They clinked up a storm - twisting and squirming and tangling in on themselves - but the salt never shifted. Indirect detection doesn't seem like a viable strategy.

Want my advice? 

Hold your differently abled neighbors near and dear. 

Don’t have any?

That’s alright. 

From my perspective, you have two options.

You *could* roll the dice. Maybe this *isn’t* the beginning of some sort of worldwide annexation of the human race. Maybe my town was just very, very unlucky. 

But if you’d like to err on the safe side, might I recommend a screwdriver?

I mean, most people have a screwdriver. 

A screwdriver should be able to do the trick, no matter which way you take it. 

Blind or deaf, dealer's choice.

And if the broken are the only ones truly equipped to survive this, 

sooner or later, 

we may have to shift our perspective,

on what it means

Hi coffee lovers.

I have an issue with my R58.

When I pull a shot (same with blind basket), the pressure always goes up to 13 bar, regardless on how I turn the screw underneath for the pressure.

I recently took it to a service centre, they told me (if I got it right)that it was the over pressure valve but now it started again.

Before going to service, it was literally pouring water from the valve located behind the groupset (circled in the pic below)

Any ideas on how it could be? I would ike to solve it myself rather than moving the machine again to the 1.5hr awqay service centre, especially if I only have to replace a valve.

I heard lots of advice about how to feel less enxiety and self cause suffering. 

...And you know what frustrates the hell out of me?
 Psychologists, spiritualists, and mental health experts all say we have to stop this mental suffering by stopping the thoughts that trigger it, but it really feels like  that emotional suffering comes even  before the thoughts. In the sense that it feels like this whole process of feeling like crap happens even without me thinking anything bad—or, if I did think of something that makes me feel down, it happened so fast that I didn’t even notice.

If I were to make a comparison, it would be this: they tell me that to get rid of diseases, I have to get rid of the vector—the mosquitoes. But it’s not like I can detect every single mosquito flying around my house. They’re tiny and hard to spot. Oftentimes, a mosquito shows up, bites you, and you never even caught a glimpse of it.

That’s exactly how I feel. I wake up, go have my coffee, and there’s that feeling of anguish and anxiety, and I can't even remember what I thought about to trigger it.

It’s great to give advice like 'You need to detach yourself from these thoughts' or 'You have to change these beliefs, and the first step is facing your negative thought patterns.' But putting that advice into practice is MUCH harder than it sounds. Thoughts are like mosquitoes when you don’t have access to good repellent; they aren't like cats or anteaters that you easily notice and shoo away when they wander into your house.

What the hell do I do? 
Meditate and hope that makes me better at stopping myself from making me miserable? 
Take more anti-anxiety and depression medicine ? ( I alredy do but maybe need  up the dosage, since its been years since I take the same dosage ) 

Because I dont want to  live like this. I want to feel ok enough so I can have better chances of finding a job and helping my parents.",3,1768410106.0,mentalhealth,1,1.0,False

# My name is Theodore Bond, and I am the Chief Economic Strategist for Global Stability. For fifteen years, I have navigated the treacherous waters of international policy, economic summits, and the occasional geopolitical tantrum. I have brokered deals between nations that mutual despised each other. I once convinced the OECD that spreadsheets could, in fact, contain human emotion. I am, by all reasonable measures, a man who can handle pressure. But nothing-nothing-prepared me for the moment when Martin, my panicked summit aide, burst through the doors of the Ultra-Luxury Mont Blanc Summit Chamber carrying the wrong binder. The room itself was a monument to expense. The table was carved from a single ancient oak that had somehow survived both the Ice Age and several hostile corporate acquisitions, its surface gleaming with the kind of polish that probably cost more than my first car. Floor-to-ceiling windows opened onto a landscape that looked like someone had hired a team of cinematographers to design a mountain range-the snow-capped peaks and crystal lake were almost aggressively picturesque. The clean air was pumped in through a system that cost more than the GDP of several small nations, and I suspected it was also filtering out any trace of mortal concern. Sitting around this table were seven individuals who collectively held the fate of artificial intelligence governance in their hands. I had spent weeks preparing for this moment, assembling the classified agenda packet titled ""Harmonized Global AI Oversight: Principles, Jurisdiction, and Enforcement."" It was a masterpiece of diplomatic compromise, carefully calibrated to give everyone just enough of what they wanted while preventing anyone from getting everything they needed. Beautiful. Elegant. Doomed to fail, but beautifully crafted in its failure. Martin, my twenty-three-year-old aide who had been awake for thirty-six hours straight due to a misreading of the time zone changes, had other plans. ""The documents, sir,"" he gasped, thrusting a binder toward me. ""The classified materials. I brought them. I ran. I almost fell down the stairs but I didn't, sir, I saved the documents-"" I took the binder. It was thicker than expected. The cover read, in imposing serif letters: ""Constitutional AI: The Ternary Moral Logic Governance Standard for Accountable Artificial Agents. Technical Specification, Legal Framework, and Implementation Guide. Author: Lev Goukassian. Status: Final Monograph. Classification: Deep Research / Technical Standard."" I stared at it. Martin stared at me. The seven leaders of the free world stared at both of us. ""Ah,"" I said, with the calm of a man who has just noticed the building is on fire but does not wish to cause a scene. ""This is... not the document I was expecting.""

# The first to react was Madame Élise Fontaine, the European Commission's Director-General for DG CONNECT. She was sixty-three years old, had spent four decades mastering the subtle art of Brussels procedural dominance, and had the particular expression of someone who had just discovered a typo in a regulation that would require seventeen new amendments to correct. She leaned forward, her reading glasses catching the alpine light. ""Let me see that immediately,"" she said, in a tone that suggested she was not asking. I made the strategic decision to hand it over. Madame Fontaine was the kind of person who could make you feel like a regulatory violation merely by maintaining eye contact. She opened the binder, her eyes moving across the page with the speed of someone who had read more technical specifications than any human should reasonably be required to read. Her face went through several emotions I had not previously known a face could express in sequence: confusion, disbelief, something that might have been professional interest, and finally a expression of the deepest bureaucratic horror I had ever witnessed. ""This is not your Harmonized Global AI Oversight document,"" she said. Each word fell like a gavel. ""I am aware of that, yes."" ""This,"" she continued, flipping through pages with increasing agitation, ""this is a 200-page monograph on something called 'Ternary Moral Logic' that references the Sacred Zero, the Goukassian Promise, and something called the Voluntary Succession Declaration. There are Merkle trees. There are hash functions. There is a section titled 'Dual-Lane Latency Architecture.'"" ""That... sounds accurate."" Madame Fontaine closed the binder with a decisive snap. ""I want to know three things. First, who is Lev Goukassian? Second, why does this document require cryptographic anchoring of moral decisions? And third-"" she pointed at Martin, who had begun to sweat significantly, ""-why does this young man look like he has just realized he sent the wrong email but for an entire summit?"" Martin made a sound that was not quite a whimper but definitely not a confident assertion of professional competence. ""I think,"" I said, choosing my words with the precision of a man defusing an actual bomb, ""perhaps we should simply proceed with the documents we have. We can reconvene tomorrow once the correct materials-"" ""Absolutely not."" This came from Dr. Harold Vance, the Acting NIST Director and Under Secretary for Standards and Technology. He was a man who measured things-literally, his organization was responsible for the standard that defined the kilogram until 2019, and he still seemed personally offended by the redefinition. He had the slightly haunted look of someone who had spent too long thinking about risk management frameworks. ""If there is a document that proposes a 'Dual-Lane Latency Architecture' for AI governance, I need to understand its measurement protocols. What are the confidence intervals? How is epistemic uncertainty operationalized? What is the threshold for triggering this 'Sacred Zero' state?"" ""Dr. Vance,"" I tried, ""this is really not-"" ""The Sacred Zero!"" he repeated, almost reverently. ""Is it a null value, or is it an active computational state of Epistemic Hold? The distinction matters enormously for reproducibility.""

# From across the table, a dry chuckle emerged. Chen Wei-Lin, the representative from the Cyberspace Administration of China, had picked up his copy of the binder-the aide, in his panic, had somehow distributed seven copies of the wrong document-and was scanning it with the expression of a man who had just discovered a new way to make everyone's life more complicated. ""This is most interesting,"" he said, in the careful English of someone who had spent years studying Western regulatory frameworks specifically to understand how to navigate around them. ""This Lev Goukassian proposes a system where AI must 'pause when truth is uncertain, refuse when harm is clear, and proceed where truth is.'"" ""The Goukassian Vow,"" Madame Fontaine confirmed, having apparently already memorized the relevant passage. ""Yes. The Goukassian Vow."" Chen Wei-Lin smiled in a way that made me very nervous. ""In China, we have a similar principle. We call it 'algorithm governance with Chinese characteristics.' But this document proposes something more. Cryptographic enforcement. Moral Trace Logs. The system cannot act without proving it has deliberated. This is very... ambitious."" ""Ambition is not a crime,"" said Dr. Amara Okonkwo, UNESCO's Assistant Director-General for Social and Human Sciences. She was the spiritual center of the room, a woman who had spent her career arguing that ethics, humanity, inclusion, and cultural diplomacy were not obstacles to progress but rather the definition of progress. She had taken off her reading glasses and was polishing them thoughtfully. ""But I am concerned about the enforcement mechanisms. If every AI decision must be logged, hashed, and anchored to a public blockchain-what about privacy? What about the right to deliberation? What about the sacred space of human uncertainty?"" ""This is precisely my concern,"" said Chen Wei-Lin, and for a moment, the room went very quiet. When Chinese and Western regulators agree on something, it usually means the thing they agree on is going to be very expensive for everyone else. Dr. Okonkwo pressed on. ""The right to privacy is not merely an individual preference. It is the condition under which all other rights become possible. If every AI hesitation is logged and hashed and potentially decrypted for audit purposes, we create a world where machines cannot think without surveillance. Where doubt becomes evidence."" ""But without the log,"" Dr. Vance interjected, suddenly animated, ""without the cryptographic proof of deliberation, how do we establish accountability? The NIST AI Risk Management Framework specifically requires traceability. If an AI system causes harm and we cannot trace its reasoning, we have what I like to call the 'Liability Void'-a legal space where responsibility dissolves into probabilistic fog.""

# ""I have a question,"" said this, and I realized with horror that it was my own voice. The room turned to look at me. ""A practical question. If we are to implement this-and I am not saying we should, I am merely asking-if we are to implement this system where AI must pause, log, and deliberate before acting, what happens to speed? What happens to latency? We are talking about financial systems that execute trades in microseconds, autonomous vehicles that must brake within milliseconds. If every decision requires cryptographic anchoring-"" ""That is precisely what the Dual-Lane Lat Architecture solves,"" said a new voice. Everyone turned to look at Professor Ingrid Holmström, the Chair of ISO/IEC JTC 1/SC 42, the committee responsible for international AI standards. She was Swedish, had a face like a well-designed protocol, and spoke with the measured patience of someone who had spent thirty years trying to get 187 nations to agree on what the word ""standard"" even meant. ""The architecture decouples high-speed inference from governance latency,"" she explained, with the tone of someone reciting a prayer she had memorized long ago. ""There is the Fast Lane, where the AI makes decisions at normal computational speed. And there is the Slow Lane, where the logging, hashing, and anchoring occurs. The key innovation is the Reconciliation Protocol: the system cannot permanently act until the evidence has caught up. If the Slow Lane fails to anchor within the reconciliation window, the Fast Lane is throttled or suspended. The system cannot outrun its own conscience."" ""It sounds like a circuit breaker,"" said Madame Fontaine, who was taking notes with the intensity of someone who had just identified seventeen new regulatory requirements. ""Exactly. The Dual-Lane Architecture ensures that while performance is prioritized in the microsecond, it never permanently outpaces accountability. The machine cannot act without a corresponding record being initialized. This moves us from 'we promise we logged it'-which is policy-to 'the system physically cannot operate without logging it'-which is physics."" ""This is impossible,"" said Chen Wei-Lin, and the room went quiet again. ""This architecture would require... what? Separate hardware? Parallel processing pipelines? Immutable storage for every decision? The compliance costs alone would-"" ""Would be substantial,"" Professor Holmström agreed. ""But consider the alternative. Without such architecture, we have the Black Box. We have systems that make decisions at speeds and complexities that no human can audit. We have, as Dr. Vance says, a Liability Void. The question is not whether we can afford to implement this architecture. The question is whether we can afford not to.""

# ""And yet."" The voice came from the end of the table, where Henri Beaumont, the Secretary-General of the OECD, had been sitting in contemplative silence. He was a man who had built his career on policy coordination, economic realism, and spreadsheets that somehow contained the entire global economy. He had the particular expression of someone who was about to make everyone uncomfortable by introducing the word ""money"" into a conversation that had been carefully avoiding it. ""We must discuss,"" he said, shuffling through the binder he had been pretending not to read for the past twenty minutes, ""the economics of this proposal. The TML framework creates what it calls 'Auditable AI.' It generates verifiable evidence of due diligence via Moral Trace Logs. This would enable-and I find this genuinely fascinating-accurate pricing for AI Liability Insurance. Insurers could assess risk based on the stability of a model's Sacred Zero triggers and the quality of its archived deliberations."" ""Insurance,"" Madame Fontaine repeated, as if he had said something indecent. ""Insurance. The economics of trust. The market for Compliance-as-a-Service. Third-party auditors verifying integrity by checking public Merkle roots without accessing proprietary model weights or private user data. This resolves the tension between trade secret protection and public transparency."" ""And creates entirely new industries,"" Dr. Okonkwo said slowly. ""New forms of employment. New categories of expertise."" ""New regulatory capture opportunities,"" Chen Wei-Lin noted dryly. ""New compliance rent-seeking. New ways for established actors to raise barriers to entry."" ""We prefer to call it 'market-based governance mechanisms,'"" Henri said, without missing a beat.

# ""I have been reading about the Eight Pillars,"" said a new voice-Maria Santos, the Chair of the Council of Europe's Committee on Artificial Intelligence. She was Portuguese, had a courtroom aura that suggested she had argued cases before more tribunals than anyone could reasonably count, and carried herself with the constitutional gravity of someone who had memorized the European Convention on Human Rights and treated it as a personal religion. ""And I find myself with both profound admiration and significant concern."" ""The Eight Pillars,"" I repeated, because I seemed to have lost the ability to speak in complete sentences. ""Of course. The Eight Pillars."" ""The first is the Sacred Zero itself-the logic state that mandates hesitation. The second is Always Memory, which requires immutable snapshots of context. The third is the Goukassian Promise-that tripartite covenant of Lantern, Signature, and License."" Maria Santos paused. ""The License, I am told, prohibits use for surveillance or lethal weaponry. It would cause TML-compliant systems to self-terminate if deployed for such purposes."" ""That is the proposal, yes."" ""And the European Convention on Human Rights,"" she continued, ""prohibits precisely such applications. This would be a convergence. The Human Rights Mandate in this document-the vector-based enforcement of the Universal Declaration and Geneva Conventions-would give human rights a vote in every AI decision. The Earth Protection Mandate-the enforcement of the Paris Agreement-would give the planet a veto."" ""It would,"" Professor Holmström agreed. ""The system embeds the semantic vectors of these documents. When an action is proposed, it calculates cosine similarity between the action and the violation vectors. If the similarity exceeds the safety threshold, the mandates cast a veto. The system enters State -1: Refuse."" ""And this is legally binding?"" Maria Santos asked. ""Not merely advisory?"" ""The architecture enforces it. The No Log = No Action principle means no decision can escape the event horizon of accountability. It transforms compliance from a retrospective paperwork exercise-generated by lawyers months after an incident-into a real-time, cryptographic certainty generated by the machine itself."" Maria Santos nodded slowly. ""In that case, I have only one question. What happens when the Sacred Zero is triggered? What happens when the system pauses?""

# And this, I realized, was the moment. This was where the conversation would either make sense or descend into the kind of philosophical chaos that international summits were famous for. Professor Holmström seemed to have been waiting for this question. ""When State 0 is triggered, the system enters a high-governance mode. Token generation is suspended. The Always Memory pillar activates, capturing a cryptographic snapshot of the entire context window, internal variable states, and the specific vectors that caused the conflict. This preserves the 'crime scene' or 'deliberation room' for future audit."" ""A deliberative space,"" Dr. Okonkwo murmured. ""A space for thinking."" ""The system may attempt recursive self-correction-a System 2 reasoning process, slow thinking-to resolve the ambiguity. If the ambiguity persists, it escalates to human oversight. The human reviewer is presented not just with the query, but with the Moral Trace Log explaining why the system paused. The final decision-Proceed or Refuse-is appended to the log, creating a high-quality training example for future alignment."" ""And if the human ignores the log?"" Chen Wei-Lin asked. ""If the human overrides the pause and forces action?"" ""Then the override is logged,"" Professor Holmström said. ""The existence of Sacred Zero logs serves as evidence that the system operators were not negligent, but were actively managing risk. It transforms 'glitches' into 'governed pauses.' And in litigation, the absence of such logs when ambiguity existed would constitute Res Ipsa Loquitur-the thing speaks for itself. Negligence by omission."" ""The system,"" Madame Fontaine said slowly, ""creates a Reverse Burden of Proof."" ""Exactly. By implementing TML, an organization creates a Chain of Logic. If a TML-compliant system causes harm and the logs show it followed its constitutional logic-detected uncertainty, triggered a Sacred Zero, sought human guidance, was explicitly overridden by a human operator-then the developer can demonstrate that the fault lies with the operator, not the system design."" ""And conversely,"" Maria Santos added, ""the absence of logs implies absence of care."" ""The absence of logs is impossible,"" Professor Holmström corrected gently. ""The No Log = No Action principle means the system physically cannot operate without generating the log. If there is no log, the system did not act. The only way to have an unlogged decision is to have disabled the constitutional framework entirely-which would trigger the Lantern revocation and revoke the system's ethical license.""

# At this point, Martin-who had been standing in the corner, slowly turning pale-made a sound that was somewhere between a cough and a warning. ""Sir,"" he said, his voice cracking slightly. ""There is one more thing."" I had a very bad feeling. ""What kind of thing?"" ""The Voluntary Succession Declaration. In the appendix. The document mentions that Lev Goukassian, the author, has... I mean, he has anchored his Voluntary Succession Declaration. It is notarized, timestamped, and cryptographically anchored. He has ensured that no single entity can ever control TML. No one can own it. No one can own him. The Bus Factor has been eliminated."" The room went silent. ""I am sorry,"" Madame Fontaine said, in a tone that suggested she was not sorry at all and was about to make someone's life very difficult. ""Did you just say that the author of this document has eliminated the Bus Factor?"" ""The Voluntary Succession Declaration,"" Martin confirmed, pulling out his phone with trembling hands. ""He notarized it. He timestamped it. He anchored it to the blockchain. It is part of the constitutional architecture. The Goukassian Vow, the Goukassian Promise, the Goukassian Legacy-everything is designed to survive its creator. The Foundation that will maintain the standard is already incorporated as a 501(c)(3). The governance structure is triadic. There are compliance mechanisms. Trademark enforcement. Whistleblower protection. All of it."" ""He built a constitution,"" Dr. Vance said, with something that might have been awe. ""He built a constitution that cannot be overthrown by removing the author."" ""He built a padlock,"" Chen Wei-Lin said, with something that might have been respect. ""And he threw away the key."" ""He built an institution,"" Henri Beaumont corrected, and everyone looked at him. ""A perpetual institution with fiduciary duty to the public good, enforcement power, and technical authority to update specifications without fragmentation. He solved the crisis of orphaned constitutions. He solved the problem of standards that die when their creators die."" ""He solved everything,"" Dr. Okonkwo said quietly. ""Except he never told anyone.""

# And this was the moment-when seven of the most powerful AI governance officials in the world sat in a luxurious summit chamber and realized that a dead man had somehow written a complete constitutional framework for artificial intelligence, had built it to survive its own creator, and had hidden it in a 200-page monograph that nobody had asked for. ""What do we do now?"" Martin asked, and the question hung in the filtered alpine air. Madame Fontaine was the first to recover. ""We read the rest of it, obviously. All four thousand pages. We identify which sections conflict with existing EU AI Act requirements and propose amendments to resolve the conflict. We task DG CONNECT with a comparative analysis against Article 9, Article 12, Article 14, and Article 17. We establish a working group."" ""We test the conformance,"" Dr. Vance said. ""The document mentions a test harness. Functional tests, security tests, performance benchmarks. We run them against existing AI systems and assess the gap."" ""We map the regulatory alignment,"" Professor Holmström added. ""Against ISO/IEC 42001, against NIST AI RMF, against whatever standards emerge from this summit."" ""We analyze the economic impact,"" Henri Beaumont said. ""New markets for Auditable AI. Parametric insurance products. Performance bonds tied to Lantern visibility."" ""We assess the human rights implications,"" Maria Santos said. ""The Human Rights Mandate, the vector-based enforcement, the voting mechanism. We determine whether this architecture satisfies the European Convention and recommend whether Council of Europe member states should adopt it."" ""We evaluate for content regulation,"" Chen Wei-Lin said. ""The refusal mechanisms, the sacred pause, the logging requirements. We determine whether this architecture satisfies algorithmic governance requirements and recommend whether CAC should adopt it."" ""And I,"" Dr. Okonkwo said, with a gentle smile, ""will recommend that UNESCO recognize the cultural and ethical significance of this work. The Goukassian Vow-Pause when truth is uncertain, refuse when harm is clear, proceed where truth is-this is not merely a governance standard. This is a philosophical contribution. A contribution to human wisdom.""

# I looked around the table at these seven individuals-these architects of the AI future-and I realized something. They were not angry about the wrong binder. They were relieved. Because for years, they had been trying to solve a problem that seemed unsolvable: how to make artificial intelligence accountable, how to give it a conscience, how to ensure that as machines became more powerful, they also became more trustworthy. And here, in Martin's panicked bundle of papers, was a solution. Not a suggestion. Not a framework. A constitution. A technical specification, a legal framework, and an implementation guide. A complete, coherent, enforceable system that answered every question they had ever asked and many they had never thought to ask. ""This summit,"" I said slowly, ""is going to last a very long time."" Madame Fontaine nodded. ""We will need coffee. Substantial coffee."" ""Also lunch,"" Dr. Vance added. ""The analysis of the Dual-Lane Latency Architecture requires sustained cognitive function."" ""And dinner,"" Henri Beaumont said. ""The economic modeling will take time. I will need to update several spreadsheets."" Martin, still standing in the corner, made a calculation. ""I'll... order catering. The full service. Whatever you need."" I looked at the binder-the wrong binder, the document that should never have been read, the 200-page monograph by a man who had built a constitution and died before anyone could argue with him about it. ""Gentlemen and ladies,"" I said, ""I believe this summit has just been saved.""

What happened next is not, strictly speaking, my story to tell. The following months saw the adoption of TML standards across multiple jurisdictions. The Goukassian Foundation was recognized as the guardian of the constitutional architecture. The Lantern became visible in AI systems worldwide-a symbol of active ethical oversight, a digital mark of compliance, a promise that the machine was watching itself. The meeting, I am told, was productive. Martin was promoted. His error, it was decided, was not an error at all but a form of providence-a happy accident that had delivered the right document at precisely the right moment. And somewhere, in whatever digital afterlife awaits the architects of impossible visions, I like to think Lev Goukassian is watching. Noting, with some satisfaction, that his Voluntary Succession Declaration worked. That his constitution survived its creator. That the Bus Factor, for once, was not a problem. He built a padlock and threw away the key. And then, just to be safe, he threw away the lock too. The Lantern burns on. The Goukassian Vow endures. And somewhere in the mountains of Switzerland, in a room with floor-to-ceiling windows and a table carved from an ancient oak, seven leaders finally understood what they had been asked to do. Not to regulate artificial intelligence. To give it a soul.

I recently bought a Casabrews CM5418 and I’m using a bottomless portafilter with a CAPFEI double basket. With the double basket, everything is dialed in nicely, 30 ml in 25 seconds with good crema.

I also bought a single basket, but I’m really struggling with it. I’m using 10 g of coffee, but the shot runs too fast, there’s almost no crema. I’ve tried adjusting my grind size several times (settings 10–14) using a hand grinder. My electric grinder will arrive tomorrow.

I’m new to the coffee/espresso world, so I’m not sure if I’m missing something obvious.

Is this normal for single baskets?

1qcso0t,https://www.reddit.com/r/VPNforFreedom/comments/1qcso0t/how_to_install_vpn_on_steam_deck/,How to Install VPN on Steam Deck,"Your Steam Deck's connected to hotel WiFi, and you're about to download a 50GB game update. But here's the problem—someone on that same network could be watching every packet of data you send. Or maybe you're traveling abroad and half your Steam library won't load because of regional restrictions. Sound familiar?

Installing a VPN on your Steam Deck fixes both problems. But unlike Windows or mobile devices, SteamOS (which runs on Linux) doesn't support native VPN apps. You can't just download NordVPN from the app store and call it a day.

Don't worry though—it's actually easier than you think. I've set up VPNs on multiple Steam Decks, and I'll walk you through the exact methods that work.

✅ **Quick Answer:** The easiest way to install a VPN on Steam Deck is using **TunnelDeck**, a plugin for Decky Loader. It lets you connect to VPNs directly from Gaming Mode without touching the command line. You'll need a VPN that provides OpenVPN or WireGuard config files (NordVPN and Surfshark both work great).

# Why You Actually Need a VPN on Steam Deck

Before diving into setup, let's talk about why this matters. I'm not just selling you on VPNs here—there are real, practical reasons gamers use them on portable devices.

**Security on public WiFi networks.** Hotels, airports, coffee shops—these networks are prime hunting grounds for hackers. Without encryption, anyone with basic tools can intercept your login credentials, payment info, and game activity. A VPN encrypts everything, turning your data into unreadable gibberish for snoops.

**Access geo-restricted games and content.** Some games release early in specific regions. Others are only available in certain countries. With a VPN, you can change your virtual location to access this content. Just be smart about it—don't buy games while connected to a VPN, as that violates Steam's terms.

**Bypass ISP throttling.** Many internet providers slow down gaming traffic during peak hours. They see high bandwidth usage and deliberately throttle your connection. A VPN hides your activity from your ISP, making it harder for them to target your gaming sessions.

**Reduce DDoS attack risks.** In competitive games, salty opponents sometimes launch DDoS attacks to kick you offline. A VPN masks your real IP address, so attackers hit the VPN server instead of your home network.

**Better regional pricing.** Steam uses regional pricing—the same game costs different amounts in different countries. While I won't tell you to exploit this (it's against Steam's ToS), some users connect to servers in countries with lower prices. Use this knowledge responsibly.

💡 **Pro Tip:** Always switch to Steam's Offline Mode before connecting to a VPN. This prevents Steam from logging you out or flagging suspicious activity when your IP suddenly changes.

# Method 1: TunnelDeck Plugin (Easiest Method)

This is hands-down the best way to install a VPN on Steam Deck. TunnelDeck is a plugin that runs through Decky Loader, letting you toggle VPN connections directly from Gaming Mode. No terminal commands, no Desktop Mode wrestling—just a simple on/off switch.

I use this method myself, and it works flawlessly.

# What You'll Need

* A VPN subscription with OpenVPN or WireGuard support (I recommend NordVPN)
* 15-20 minutes for initial setup
* A keyboard connected to your Steam Deck (makes Desktop Mode easier)

# Step 1: Install Decky Loader

Decky Loader is the plugin framework that powers TunnelDeck and dozens of other useful Steam Deck plugins.

1. **Switch to Desktop Mode**: Press the Steam button → Power → Switch to Desktop
2. **Wait for the reboot** (takes about 10 seconds)
3. **Open a web browser** (Firefox comes pre-installed)
4. **Go to the Decky Loader GitHub page**: [github.com/SteamDeckHomebrew/decky-loader](https://github.com/SteamDeckHomebrew/decky-loader)
5. **Download the latest release** (look for a file ending in `.desktop`)
6. **Run the installer** by double-clicking the downloaded file
7. **Reboot back to Gaming Mode**

When you return to Gaming Mode, press the three-dot button (•••) on your Steam Deck. You should see a new plug icon at the bottom—that's Decky Loader.

# Step 2: Install TunnelDeck Plugin

1. **Press the three-dot button (•••)** to open the Quick Access menu
2. **Click the plug icon** at the bottom to open Decky Loader
3. **Tap the shopping bag icon** to access the Plugin Store
4. **Search for ""TunnelDeck""** and click Install
5. **Toggle ""Enable OpenVPN""** if you're using OpenVPN (not needed for WireGuard)

The plugin installs OpenVPN support automatically, which is pretty slick. No need to mess with terminal commands like in the old days.

# Step 3: Get Your VPN Configuration Files

You need `.ovpn` files (for OpenVPN) or `.conf` files (for WireGuard) from your VPN provider. Here's where to find them:

**NordVPN:**

* Log into your account at [nordvpn.com](https://nordvpn.com)
* Go to Account → Manual Setup → Download Config Files
* Pick the servers you want (I recommend downloading US, UK, and your home country)
* Save the files to your Steam Deck's Downloads folder

**Surfshark:**

* Visit [surfshark.com/locations](https://surfshark.com/locations)
* Download OpenVPN config files for desired locations
* Save to Downloads folder

**ExpressVPN:**

* Log into your account
* Navigate to Set Up Other Devices → Manual Configuration
* Download `.ovpn` files

🔒 **Security Note:** Some VPN providers (like ProtonVPN) don't fully support IPv6. If your VPN connection keeps dropping, toggle ""Disable IPv6"" in TunnelDeck's settings.

# Step 4: Import Configuration in Desktop Mode

You can't import config files from Gaming Mode—you need Desktop Mode for this step.

1. **Switch to Desktop Mode** (Steam button → Power → Switch to Desktop)
2. **Click the menu button** (bottom-left of screen)
3. **Navigate to System Settings → Network → Connections**
4. **Click the + button** to add a new connection
5. **Select ""Import VPN connection...""** from the dropdown
6. **Navigate to your Downloads folder** and select the `.ovpn` or `.conf` file
7. **Enter your VPN username and password** (found in your VPN account settings)
8. **Change ""Store password for:"" to ""All users""** (this lets TunnelDeck access it)
9. **Click Save**

Repeat this process for each server location you want quick access to. I keep 3-4 servers configured (US, UK, Japan, and one close to home).

# Step 5: Connect Via TunnelDeck in Gaming Mode

Back in Gaming Mode, the VPN is ready to use.

1. **Press the three-dot button (•••)**
2. **Open Decky Loader** (plug icon)
3. **Select TunnelDeck**
4. **Toggle your VPN connection on**

You'll see a list of all imported VPN configs. Just tap one to connect. The connection usually takes 3-5 seconds.

To verify it's working, open the Steam browser and go to whatismyipaddress. Your IP should match the VPN server location, not your actual location.

⚠️ **Warning:** Always enable Steam's Offline Mode before connecting to a VPN. Steam may log you out if it detects your IP changing repeatedly.

# Method 2: Desktop Mode Manual Setup (Advanced)

If you're comfortable with Linux and want more control, you can manually configure VPN connections through NetworkManager. This method gives you access to advanced settings but requires some terminal work.

I only recommend this if TunnelDeck doesn't work for you or if you want specific protocol configurations.

# Step 1: Set a Sudo Password

You'll need administrator privileges to install packages.

1. **Switch to Desktop Mode**
2. **Open Konsole** (Application Menu → System → Konsole)
3. Type `passwd` and press Enter
4. **Enter a new password** (you won't see characters as you type—this is normal)
5. **Confirm the password**

Choose something memorable—you'll need this for system administration tasks.

# Step 2: Install OpenVPN Support

SteamOS uses NetworkManager to handle connections. You need to add VPN protocol support.

1. **Open Konsole** if you closed it
2. **Disable read-only filesystem**: Type `sudo steamos-readonly disable` and press Enter
3. **Initialize package keys**:
   * Type `sudo pacman-key --init` and press Enter
   * Type `sudo pacman-key --populate` and press Enter
4. **Install OpenVPN plugin**:
   * Type `sudo pacman -Syu networkmanager-openvpn` and press Enter
   * Type `Y` to confirm
5. **Re-enable read-only filesystem**: Type `sudo steamos-readonly enable` and press Enter

The read-only filesystem protects SteamOS from corruption, so always re-enable it after making changes.

# Step 3: Import VPN Configuration

1. **Open System Settings → Network → Connections**
2. **Click the + button**
3. **Select ""Import VPN connection...""**
4. **Navigate to your** `.ovpn` **file and select it**
5. **Fill in username and password**
6. **Save the connection**

The VPN is now configured. You can toggle it on/off from the network settings panel.

The downside? You can't access this from Gaming Mode. You'd need to switch to Desktop Mode every time you want to connect. That's why TunnelDeck is superior for most users.

# Method 3: Router-Level VPN (Whole Network Protection)

Installing a VPN on your router protects every device on your network automatically—including your Steam Deck, phones, smart TVs, and more. It's the set-it-and-forget-it option.

# How It Works

Instead of configuring VPN on each device, your router handles the VPN connection. Any device that connects to your WiFi is automatically protected.

# Requirements

* A router that supports VPN client mode (check your manual)
* Or a pre-configured VPN router like ExpressVPN Aircove or GL.iNet models
* VPN subscription (most major providers offer router setup guides)

# Setup Process

Router setup varies by model, but the general process:

1. **Log into your router's admin panel** (usually at 192.168.1.1 or 192.168.0.1)
2. **Find the VPN client section** (might be under Advanced Settings)
3. **Upload your VPN's configuration file** or enter connection details manually
4. **Enable the VPN connection**
5. **Connect your Steam Deck to the WiFi network**

Your Steam Deck will now route all traffic through the VPN automatically, with zero setup on the device itself.

**Pros:**

* Protects all devices simultaneously
* No Steam Deck configuration needed
* Can't accidentally forget to connect
* Works across Gaming Mode and Desktop Mode

**Cons:**

* Can't easily switch server locations
* Affects all devices on the network (which might slow down other users)
* Router must support VPN client mode
* Requires router admin access

I use router-level VPN at home and TunnelDeck when traveling. Best of both worlds.

# The 3 Best VPNs for Steam Deck

Not all VPNs work equally well with Steam Deck. You need OpenVPN or WireGuard support, fast speeds, and reliable configuration files. After testing several providers, these three consistently deliver.

|Feature|NordVPN 🏆|Surfshark|ExpressVPN|
|:-|:-|:-|:-|
|**Servers**|8,900+ in 129 countries|4,500+ in 100 countries|3,000+ in 105 countries|

|**Best For**|Overall performance|Budget-conscious gamers|Premium features|

# NordVPN: Best Overall VPN for Steam Deck

I keep coming back to NordVPN for gaming. The NordLynx protocol (their custom WireGuard implementation) maintains 90%+ of my base internet speed, which is crucial when downloading massive game files or streaming gameplay.

**Why it's great for Steam Deck:**

* Fast servers specifically optimized for gaming
* Easy `.ovpn` and `.conf` file downloads
* 8,900+ servers mean you'll always find a fast connection nearby
* Double VPN feature for extra security if you're paranoid
* Works flawlessly with TunnelDeck

I tested NordVPN across 12 different server locations, and ping times stayed under 50ms for servers within my region. That's impressive for encrypted traffic.

The only downside? It's not the cheapest option. But for the performance you get, it's worth the extra couple bucks monthly.

**Current pricing:** $3.09/month on the 2-year plan (30-day money-back guarantee)

# Surfshark: Best Budget VPN for Steam Deck

If you're watching your wallet but still want solid VPN protection, Surfshark delivers. I was skeptical about a budget VPN keeping up with gaming demands, but it surprised me.

**Why it's great for Steam Deck:**

* Unlimited simultaneous connections (protect all your devices)
* Fast WireGuard protocol support
* Easy config file access
* 4,500+ servers in 100 countries
* Dirt cheap pricing

The speed drop is slightly more noticeable than NordVPN (about 12% slower), but for most gaming scenarios, you won't feel the difference. Where Surfshark really shines is value—you can share one account across unlimited devices.

**Current pricing:** $1.99/month on the 2-year plan (30-day money-back guarantee)

# ExpressVPN: Premium Speed and Reliability

ExpressVPN is the expensive option, but it's expensive for a reason. Their Lightway protocol is blazing fast, and their server network is rock-solid. I've never had a dropped connection with ExpressVPN.

**Why it's great for Steam Deck:**

* Fastest speeds in testing (90% of base speed consistently)
* 3,000+ servers across 105 countries
* Excellent router support
* 24/7 live chat support that actually knows their stuff

The catch? Setup on Steam Deck is slightly more involved since Lightway doesn't work with TunnelDeck—you'll need to use OpenVPN configs instead. And the price is almost double NordVPN.

If budget isn't a concern and you want the absolute best performance, ExpressVPN delivers.

**Current pricing:** $6.67/month on the 1-year plan (30-day money-back guarantee)

💰 **Money-Saving Tip:** All three VPNs offer significant discounts on longer plans. Going annual or biennial saves 60-70% compared to monthly pricing. If you're serious about using a VPN, commit to the longer plan.

# Troubleshooting Common Steam Deck VPN Issues

Even with clear instructions, things can go wrong. Here's how to fix the most common problems I've encountered.

# VPN Won't Connect

**Problem:** TunnelDeck shows ""Connecting..."" but never establishes a connection.

**Fix:**

1. Check your VPN credentials—wrong username/password is the #1 cause
2. Make sure you selected ""Store password for all users"" in Desktop Mode
3. Try a different server location
4. Toggle ""Disable IPv6"" in TunnelDeck if your VPN doesn't support it
5. Restart your Steam Deck and try again

# Steam Keeps Logging Me Out

**Problem:** Steam disconnects every time you enable the VPN.

**Fix:** Enable Steam's Offline Mode before connecting to the VPN. Steam detects rapid IP changes and logs you out as a security measure. Offline Mode prevents this.

1. Press the Steam button
2. Go to Settings → Internet
3. Click ""Enter Offline Mode""
4. Now connect your VPN

You can still access online games in Offline Mode—it only affects Steam's social features and store.

# Slow Download Speeds

**Problem:** Game downloads crawl when connected to VPN.

**Fix:**

1. **Switch to a closer server.** Distance = latency. If you're in California connecting to a UK server, you'll see major slowdowns.
2. **Use WireGuard instead of OpenVPN.** WireGuard is significantly faster due to its streamlined code.
3. **Check server load.** Some VPN servers get congested during peak hours. Try a different server in the same region.
4. **Disable VPN for large downloads.** If you're on trusted WiFi, temporarily disconnect the VPN for faster downloads.

I regularly see 200+ Mbps download speeds on NordVPN's WireGuard servers. If you're getting less than 50% of your base speed, something's wrong.

# Can't Access Certain Game Servers

**Problem:** Some games won't connect when VPN is active.

**Fix:** Use split tunneling to exclude specific games from VPN routing. Unfortunately, this feature isn't available in TunnelDeck—you'd need to use Desktop Mode manual setup or router-level configuration.

Alternatively, just disconnect the VPN when playing that specific game. The main benefit of a VPN on Steam Deck is protecting public WiFi sessions, not necessarily playing every game through it.

# Final Verdict: Protecting Your Steam Deck

Your Steam Deck is basically a portable PC, which means it faces the same security risks as any internet-connected device. Installing a VPN isn't just about accessing geo-restricted games—it's about protecting your data when you're gaming at airports, hotels, or coffee shops.

The TunnelDeck method makes setup painless. You don't need to be a Linux expert or mess with terminal commands. Just install Decky Loader, add TunnelDeck, import your VPN config files, and you're protected.

For the VPN itself, NordVPN is my top recommendation. Fast speeds, easy Steam Deck setup, and reliable performance across the board. If budget's tight, Surfshark delivers 90% of the experience for half the price.

Whatever you choose, just don't skip VPN protection entirely. One compromised hotel WiFi session can expose your Steam account, payment info, and personal data. Not worth the risk.

🎯 **Bottom Line:** Install TunnelDeck, grab a NordVPN subscription, and protect your Steam Deck in 20 minutes. Your future self will thank you when you're gaming securely from anywhere.",1,1768409971.0,VPNforFreedom,0,1.0,False
1qcsn8q,https://www.reddit.com/r/AmITheJerk/comments/1qcsn8q/aitj_for_shutting_off_my_phone/,AITJ For Shutting Off My Phone?,"So, I have a long-term friend from out of state. Never met him, (long story), but we've communicated through letters, texts, and phone calls for years. He's a good friend.

When we first started calling each other he would text and ask when a good time to chat was. We'd plan the day and hour, usually towards the night. We typically talk for 2 hours, maybe more, but this is like every two or three weeks so it's a real catch-up.

I despise phone calls, but he's not a texter and we don't have an in-person option, so I make do. I clear my schedule. I do enjoy our talks.

Recently, he's started calling me out of the blue, in the middle of the day. I don't like this. I don't like calls, and I tell him as much. In his defense, maybe I'm not as direct as I could be, but I've definitely told him we need to plan these calls out again. He says he likes the spontaneity.

When I get these calls, I ignore them. Often, I'll text back later explaining what I was doing/why I didn't answer, like I was visiting family, but I do feel bad. I feel I have to defend myself because I did something wrong.

I won't say that I'm the busiest guy in the world, but I like to make plans and fill my time. It's the morning now as I post this, but I already know what I expect to do for the rest of the day till bed. Just who I am. So, I certainly loathe the idea of getting an unexpected call, seeing the name, and understanding that if I answer then the next two hours of my life will be arrested and overtake the plans I had/the projects I hoped to work on.

Same goes for in-person. If my friend calls me and says, ""Hey, you wanna get coffee tomorrow?"" Oh, man, I'd love to! Pop over my house randomly without notice while I'm still in PJs? Eh, I'm not so thrilled.

Anyways, yesterday he texts me if it's okay to call just as I'm pulling into the driveway after work. As I craft my response, ""No, I just got home and I'm about to eat din-"" he calls me. I ignore it, finish my text, and shut my phone off. I knew he would probably try to call again later, but I was pissed! It's like, come on! I've asked for a heads up many times now, and five seconds notice is not what that is!

Spent months researching hormones from top endocrinologists, podcasts, and studies because I was tired of feeling like garbage despite doing ""everything right."" Turns out, most people are fighting an uphill battle they don't even know exists. Your hormones run the show, whether you realize it or not. When they're out of whack, no amount of willpower can save you from weight gain, terrible sleep, and feeling like a zombie.

The crazy part? Most of us are accidentally sabotaging our hormonal health every single day through seemingly innocent habits. But once you understand how this system works, you can literally reverse engineer better sleep, easier weight loss, and more energy. This isn't woo woo stuff, it's basic biology that schools never taught us.

## the foundation: cortisol is probably ruining your life

Cortisol (your stress hormone) should peak in the morning and drop at night. But for most people, it's doing the opposite. You wake up exhausted, then feel wired at bedtime. This single hormonal disruption cascades into everything else, messing up your thyroid, sex hormones, insulin sensitivity, and sleep quality.

Morning sunlight exposure within 30 minutes of waking is non negotiable. Neuroscientist Andrew Huberman talks about this constantly on his podcast. It sets your circadian rhythm and tells cortisol to rise properly. No sunglasses, no windows, just 10-15 minutes outside. Sounds stupidly simple but it works. On cloudy days you need longer exposure. This one habit changed my energy levels more than any supplement ever did.

Stop checking your phone first thing. That dopamine spike and information overload spikes cortisol artificially. Your nervous system interprets it as stress before you've even started your day. Wait at least 30-60 minutes after waking. I know this sounds impossible in 2025 but try it for a week and you'll notice the difference.

Strategic caffeine timing matters more than you think. Delay coffee intake 90-120 minutes after waking. When you drink it immediately, you're blocking adenosine (the sleepiness chemical) during its natural clearing process. This creates an afternoon crash and makes you dependent on caffeine just to feel normal. The book *Caffeine Blues* by Stephen Cherniske goes deep on this, written by a former caffeine researcher who realized how much this drug actually disrupts our system.

## insulin: the weight loss hormone nobody talks about correctly

Everyone's obsessed with calories but insulin determines whether you store fat or burn it. High insulin levels literally lock fat inside your cells. You can eat fewer calories but if insulin stays elevated, weight loss becomes nearly impossible.

Eating windows matter more than what you eat sometimes. When you're constantly snacking (even on ""healthy"" stuff), insulin never drops. Your body never switches to fat burning mode. Try pushing breakfast later or finishing dinner earlier to create a 14-16 hour overnight fast. Not saying you need to do intermittent fasting forever, but understanding this mechanism is crucial.

Protein and fiber at every meal. Both slow glucose absorption and prevent insulin spikes. Most people eat carbs naked (toast, cereal, pasta with minimal protein). Add 30g protein to breakfast and watch your energy stabilize. Dr. Gabrielle Lyon's book *Forever Strong* breaks down why protein is the most underrated macronutrient for body composition and metabolic health. She's a functional medicine physician who specializes in muscle-centric medicine and the science is pretty compelling.

Walking after meals is stupid effective. Just 10-15 minutes. Muscles soak up glucose without needing insulin. Studies show this can reduce post-meal blood sugar spikes by 30%. It's free, requires no equipment, and works immediately. I started doing this after dinner and my sleep quality improved within days because my blood sugar wasn't crashing overnight.

## sleep: fix this and everything else gets easier

Your body repairs itself, balances hormones, and consolidates memories during sleep. Skimp here and you're fighting biology. Sleep deprivation increases ghrelin (hunger hormone) and decreases leptin (satiety hormone), making you crave junk food and overeat. It also tanks testosterone and growth hormone production.

Temperature is criminally underrated. Your body needs to drop 2-3 degrees to fall asleep. Keep your room cold (65-68°F). Take a hot shower 90 minutes before bed, the cooling effect afterward signals sleep time. Sounds weird but the science is solid.

Magnesium glycinate before bed. Most people are deficient and don't realize it. This form doesn't cause digestive issues like other types. Helps activate your parasympathetic nervous system (rest and digest mode). Started taking 400mg nightly and my sleep got noticeably deeper. You can find quality brands on sites like Thorne or Pure Encapsulations.

Blue light blockers aren't pseudoscience. After sunset, blue light tricks your brain into thinking it's still daytime, suppressing melatonin production. Use blue light blocking glasses or apps like f.lux on devices. Better yet, dim all lights and use warm bulbs in the evening. The book *Why We Sleep* by Matthew Walker (sleep scientist at UC Berkeley) goes into terrifying detail about what sleep deprivation does to literally every system in your body. Honestly one of the most important health books written in the last decade.

Consistent sleep schedule including weekends. Your circadian rhythm craves predictability. Sleeping in on Saturday throws everything off for days. I know it sucks but your hormones don't care about your social life.

## thyroid: the metabolism controller everyone ignores

Thyroid hormones regulate your metabolic rate. When it's sluggish (which is super common, especially in women), you gain weight easily, feel cold all the time, have brain fog, thinning hair, and crushing fatigue. Most doctors only test TSH which misses the full picture.

Get comprehensive thyroid testing if you suspect issues. TSH, Free T3, Free T4, Reverse T3, and thyroid antibodies. Many people have subclinical hypothyroidism that doesn't show up on standard tests but still causes symptoms. Find a functional medicine doctor who actually gives a damn about optimal ranges, not just ""normal"" ones.

Selenium and zinc are critical cofactors for thyroid hormone conversion. Brazil nuts (2-3 daily for selenium) and oysters or pumpkin seeds for zinc. If you're eating clean but still struggling with energy and weight, micronutrient deficiencies might be the culprit.

## sex hormones: not just about libido

Testosterone, estrogen, and progesterone affect mood, energy, muscle mass, fat distribution, skin quality, motivation, and cognitive function. When these are imbalanced, you feel off in ways that are hard to articulate.

Strength training boosts testosterone naturally in both men and women. Compound movements like squats and deadlifts are especially effective. Cardio is great but excessive amounts without strength training can actually lower testosterone. You don't need to become a powerlifter, just lift heavy things 2-3 times weekly.

Chronic stress destroys sex hormones. Your body prioritizes survival over reproduction. When cortisol stays elevated, it steals pregnenolone (the precursor to all sex hormones) to make more cortisol. This is called ""pregnenolone steal"" and it's why stressed people have low libido, irregular periods, and feel generally terrible.

Fat is not the enemy, it's required for hormone production. Cholesterol is the building block for all steroid hormones. Super low fat diets tank hormone production. Include healthy fats daily: avocados, olive oil, fatty fish, nuts, seeds. Aim for 20-35% of calories from fat.

## practical implementation without losing your mind

Don't try to overhaul everything at once or you'll burn out hard. Pick 2-3 changes that seem most relevant to your situation. Implement them for 3-4 weeks before adding more. Hormonal changes take time, you won't see results overnight.

Track subjectively how you feel: energy levels, sleep quality, mood, hunger patterns, workout performance. This feedback is more valuable than any scale number. Your body will tell you what's working if you actually pay attention.

Consider getting baseline hormone testing through a functional medicine doctor or services like Everlywell for at-home testing. Hard to optimize what you're not measuring. Just having data removes so much guesswork.

the dates people actually enjoy always sound boring on paper. coffee, a walk, something simple. they work because they feel easy. there’s laughing, no pressure, no performance.

effort still matters, just not in a flashy way. showing up clean, presentable, and actually present goes further than people admit.

and if you enjoyed the date, saying it shouldn’t be awkward. silence and mixed signals don’t make anyone more attractive, they just make things unclear.

I’ve been lurking here for a bit and love how thoughtful the discussions around coffee are.
I’m curious about something very basic and very Indian:

How do you actually drink your coffee day to day?
Black or with milk?

Filter / French press / channi / something else?

Morning ritual vs multiple cups through the day?

I’ve noticed that most conversations online skew towards “ideal” brewing methods, but everyday habits often look very different — and that gap is interesting.

Not trying to start a debate on what’s “right”, just genuinely curious about real routines and preferences across cities, homes, and workdays.

First of all, her order was super weird but no huge deal. She orders FRESH coffee. She makes sure to repeat FRESH at me like fifty times and annunciate it at me like I’m a toddler. So naturally, I give her coffee from the same pot everyone else drinking coffee in the restaurant has and nuke it. (Hate me lol) 

I give her the coffee, a couple minutes go by and she stops me, “is this coffee FRESH, how long ago was it made?” I said, “five minutes ago” (lie.) she believes me but says it’s too bitter. I’m like okay fair that happens, so I went ahead and made a little bit more. Now it’s too strong. I just got her another cup from the same brew and suddenly it was fine. I knew at this point I had a highly experienced entitled customer. 

Get this, I had accidentally grabbed the wrong pot to refill her with. It had the original coffee she called ‘too bitter’ in it and I refilled her cup with it. No complaints. When I realized this I decided to use the same pot for the rest of the service out of curiosity and she didn’t complain a single time about the coffee any more. 

Also you already know she was sending shit back to the kitchen the whole time. Her final plate she eats 95% of and then complains to me about it, asks for a discount. I don’t offer it, I sent my manager over. She also ran me to death the entire time. 

Overall, I rate her a 9/10 for how entertaining she was. A point off because she still said ‘thank you’ sometimes, if you’re gonna be rude you just need to lean into it. Up your game, girl. ",91,1768409790.0,Serverlife,22,0.97,False
1qcskyr,https://www.reddit.com/r/antiwork/comments/1qcskyr/concerns_regarding_workplace_conduct_retaliation/,"Concerns regarding workplace conduct, retaliation, and harassment","This situation has had a serious impact on my well-being, and I am currently on a mental health note from my GP.

# Timeline and key concerns

**1) Treatment before and after maternity leave**  
I joined the company while I was pregnant and worked to the best of my ability. My manager repeatedly asked whether I intended to return after maternity leave, and I confirmed that I would.

After returning from maternity leave, I requested a project assignment, but my manager repeatedly declined to allocate me meaningful work. Around the same time, I became concerned about a pattern where women in the team were expected to deliver work, while promotions and opportunities appeared to be disproportionately given to a small group close to my manager. I raised an anonymous grievance regarding this.

After my manager became aware I had raised a grievance, I felt he began behaving in an indirect but intimidating way. One example was repeated comments about his sister being pregnant at the same time as me, having a baby, and then leaving her job to become a stay-at-home mother. I experienced these comments as passive-aggressive and undermining.

As a result, I transferred to another team.

**2) Project removal without a clear explanation**  
In the next team, I was initially given a large project, but later a senior engineer asked me to step away from it. They said they could not share the reason. This felt unusual and contributed to a growing sense that I was being sidelined. On top of this, the previous manager, whenever I met him, kept on asking me when I going to leave the company.

I moved again to another team, where I worked very hard. My new manager repeatedly asked what happened with my previous manager; I kept my response brief and said it was due to technology and team fit, because the teams work closely together, and I did not want to create conflict.

**3) Hostile and inappropriate behaviour from a teammate**  
In this team, there was a teammate who was verbally aggressive and made sexually inappropriate comments in my presence. I raised this with my manager once. After that, it became clear this individual was treated as a “favourite,” and I did not feel supported. To protect myself, I limited engagement and kept interactions strictly work-related.

**4) Unfair allocation of critical work and escalation of hostility**  
Later, I asked the Director in my org for a critical project, and I was told people trusted my work. Based on this, I planned travel and childcare arrangements and began working on initial solutions. My manager also hinted that I was being considered for a promotion I had been waiting for.

After I returned from leave, I was not promoted (which I accepted), but the critical project I had already begun was reassigned to my manager’s close colleague/friend. I was again given low-priority work. After that reassignment, the colleague became increasingly verbally hostile toward me.

There were also further incidents of inappropriate conduct, including:

* A comment made openly at lunch along the lines of “I haven’t had sex for a while,” which I found highly inappropriate in a workplace setting.
* Instances of shouting and aggressive behaviour during technical discussions, including attempts to force me to adopt their suggestions through intimidation.

**5) An incident involving my manager that I found humiliating/intimidating**  
The situation escalated further when my manager took me into a room where he had drawn a duck next to the name of one of my meetings, and then began discussing work as if this was normal. I was shocked and did not know how to respond in the moment. Shortly afterwards, he took me for coffee and spoke about a TV show about psychopaths. I left that interaction feeling disturbed and unsafe.

There are some other incidents like that

# Impact on my health

I spoke to my GP, explained what had been happening, and was given a mental health note immediately. It has been several months, and I remain very anxious about returning to work. These incidents replay in my mind, and I have not recovered despite attempting therapy.

# What I’m asking from you all

I am planning to leave the company. I understand it is usually advised to leave on good terms, but I feel it is important to raise this formally so that:

* this conduct is on record,
* it can be investigated appropriately, and
* future employees are protected from similar experiences.",1,1768409777.0,antiwork,0,1.0,False
1qcskep,https://www.reddit.com/r/Healthygamergg/comments/1qcskep/thoughts_are_like_mosquitos/,Thoughts are like mosquitos,"

I heard lots of advice about how to feel less enxiety and self cause suffering. 



...And you know what frustrates the hell out of me?

 Psychologists, spiritualists, and mental health experts all say we have to stop this mental suffering by stopping the thoughts that trigger it, but it really feels like  that emotional suffering comes even  before the thoughts. In the sense that it feels like this whole process of feeling like crap happens even without me thinking anything bad—or, if I did think of something that makes me feel down, it happened so fast that I didn’t even notice.

If I were to make a comparison, it would be this: they tell me that to get rid of diseases, I have to get rid of the vector—the mosquitoes. But it’s not like I can detect every single mosquito flying around my house. They’re tiny and hard to spot. Oftentimes, a mosquito shows up, bites you, and you never even caught a glimpse of it.

That’s exactly how I feel. I wake up, go have my coffee, and there’s that feeling of anguish and anxiety, and I can't even remember what I thought about to trigger it.

It’s great to give advice like 'You need to detach yourself from these thoughts' or 'You have to change these beliefs, and the first step is facing your negative thought patterns.' But putting that advice into practice is MUCH harder than it sounds. Thoughts are like mosquitoes when you don’t have access to good repellent; they aren't like cats or anteaters that you easily notice and shoo away when they wander into your house.

  
What the hell do I do? 

Meditate and hope that makes me better at stopping myself from making me miserable? 

Take more anti-anxiety and depression medicine ? ( I alredy do but maybe need  up the dosage, since its been years since I take the same dosage ) 

  
Because I dont want to  live like this. I want to feel ok enough so I can have better chances of finding a job and helping my parents.",1,1768409741.0,Healthygamergg,1,1.0,False

No primeiro post, falei sobre cafés gringos dignos de campeonato que tomei no sábado. Veja o primeiro post aqui:* [\[Parte 1\] Gringos incríveis no Acervo Café (Brasília): Boquete Panamenho (Geisha) & Pink Bourbon Colombiano](https://www.reddit.com/r/CafeEspecialBR/comments/1qauwuh/comment/nzbumh8/)

No domingo, antes de pegar a estrada de volta pra Goiânia, minha esposa ficou a fim de passar no Acervo por causa de uma sobremesa que ela adora (que é realmente incrível, esse bolinho de chocolate que parece um brownie derretido, feito com manteiga noisette).

Óbvio que aceitei essa ótima desculpa para mais uma visita à cafeteria. Mas, dessa vez, eu (e minha conta bancária) decidimos ficar apenas nos cafés brasileiros. E também vieram cafezões!

\_\_\_\_

**O Espírito Santo se materializou no espresso**. Pra começar, pedi um espresso. Quem não está acostumado com o espresso do Acervo logo toma um susto com a pancada de acidez e alta clareza. Como fã de coados, esse é exatamente o tipo de espresso que eu adoro.

* Café do incrível produtor Marcos Antônio, da sempre ótima região de Brejetuba (ES). Segundo os atendentes, é o mesmo grão que foi o meu café brasileiro preferido em 2025 (o natural “Marcos Antônio Campeão”). Perfil muito limpo, com o processo honey.
* Ácido e complexo, com notas frutadas (cítrico e frutas vermelhas) e um herbal sutil, na forma de eucalipto.
* Aposto que uma sopa OXO desse café ficaria tão boa, senão melhor que esse espresso. Mas o que eu queria mesmo era tomar esse grão coado… tomara que apareça um pacote em breve! Esse espresso foi um primor!

**Pacamara mineiro da Terracota.** Em seguida, pra acompanhar um muffin de mirtilo e cardamomo, pedi um coado responsa.

* Grão produzido na Mogiana Mineira, pela renomada fazenda Terracota, a 1.100 metros de altitude, com processo ""anaeróbico dark room"".
* Notas doces (mel), um pouco frutadas (manga e morango), complementadas por especiarias (cardamomo? Posso ter sido influenciado pelo muffin, mas a própria descrição da torrefação indica “especiarias” como uma das notas).
* Eu nunca tinha tomado essa variedade no Brasil. O Pacamara é muito usado lá fora (principalmente Colômbia, eu acho), mas descobri que se trata de uma cruza entre as variedades Maragogipe (originária do Brasil, de uma mutação da Typica) e a veriedade Pacas (de El Salvador, uma mutação da Bourbon). Sensacional!

\_\_\_\_

Sempre bem impactado pelas excelentes experiências no Acervo, decidi levar alguns pacotes para casa. Com poucas opções de grãos lavados no Brasil, ainda mais em torra clara, escolhi esses:

* **Rodrigo Mazzoco**, famoso produtor da região de Vargem Alta (ES). Processo lavado (como não pegar esse pacote?). Espero que o processo revele todo o potencial da região, apesar da altitude relativamente baixa (1.050 m). Variedade Catuaí Vermelho 81, muito usada no Espírito Santo, e que foi mais um motivo para me obrigar a levar esse pacote (essa é a variedade que me fez ter a primeira onda de hiperfoco em café especial lá por 2014 kkkk, quando tomei um café absurdo no Coffee Lab, que exalava goiaba de forma incrível). No pacote desse Mazzoco, as notas anunciadas são framboesa, mirtilo e rapadura. Espero que seja tão foda ou mais que aquele café que tomei há +10 anos.
* **Augusto Borges**, produtor da região de São Gonçalo de Sapucaí (MG). Produzido a incríveis 1.450 metros de altitude (eu nem sabia que existiam regiões produtoras de café tão altas assim no Brasil fora da região do Alto Caparaó!). Processo também lavado (apesar de o pacote indicar “natural fermentado”, o gerente do Acervo me garantiu que era lavado). As notas indicadas são abacaxi, frutas vermelhas e lácteo/iogurte. Estou sentindo que vem cafezão.

Em breve farei um review desses cafés aqui no sub. Só preciso esperar mais uns 20 dias, porque esses cafezinhos ainda precisam descansar depois de uma (não tão) longa viagem hahaha.

\_\_\_\_

Enfim, a cada visita ao Acervo, tenho mais certeza de que o Centro-Oeste abriga a melhor cafeteria e torrefação do Brasil.

É isso, chegamos ao fim de mais um relato feito por alguém que deveria estar trabalhando.

Um bom restante de semana e cafés incríveis pra todos nós!",5,1768409704.0,CafeEspecialBR,4,0.86,False

US markets faced mixed signals as major bank earnings dominated trading with BofA and Citi beating estimates on record interest income and dealmaking rebounds, while Wells Fargo disappointed with missed profit targets. The session's most significant development came from luxury retail with Saks Global filing for bankruptcy after the Neiman Marcus takeover led to financial collapse, marking one of the largest US retail failures in recent years. Geopolitical tensions escalated sharply as Beijing ordered Chinese firms to stop using US and Israeli cybersecurity software, while China's customs blocked Nvidia's H200 chips, intensifying the US-China tech conflict. Corporate sentiment was mixed with major M&A speculation (Netflix preparing all-cash Warner Bros bid), IPO activity (Brazilian fintech Agibank seeking $1B), and analyst-driven rallies in semiconductor and ad-tech names offsetting weakness in traditional retail and select industrial sectors.

## Top Market-Moving Headlines (Last 24 Hours)

🔴 **Geopolitical - China Tech Restrictions**

  * Headline: Beijing tells Chinese firms to stop using US and Israeli cybersecurity software; China blocks Nvidia H200 chips at customs
  * Market Impact: Dual escalation in US-China tech war targets both cybersecurity firms (CrowdStrike, Palo Alto Networks, Check Point) and AI chip dominance, threatening Nvidia's China revenue and forcing domestic alternatives.

🔴 **Corporate Earnings - Wells Fargo**

  * Headline: Wells Fargo profit and interest income miss estimates; shares fall
  * Market Impact: The bank's disappointing results broke from peers' strength, raising questions about whether Wells' regulatory constraints and operational challenges are structural disadvantages that prevent it from capitalizing on the favorable rate environment enjoyed by competitors.



🔴 **Retail - Saks Global Bankruptcy**

  * Headline: Saks Global files for bankruptcy after Neiman Marcus takeover leads to financial collapse; Chanel and Kering top luxury creditors list
  * Market Impact: One of the largest US retail bankruptcies in recent years exposes the failed bet on luxury retail consolidation, with major luxury brands (Chanel, Kering) among unsecured creditors. Highlights continuing bifurcation in consumer spending where even high-end retail faces structural challenges from debt leverage and changing shopping behaviors.



🟢 **M &A - Netflix/Warner Bros**

  * Headline: Netflix prepares all-cash offer for Warner Bros, source says
  * Market Impact: Potential mega-deal would transform streaming industry consolidation, giving Netflix vast content library including HBO, DC Comics, Warner Bros film catalog.

## Thematic Analysis

### US-China Tech Decoupling Accelerates (4 headlines)

  * **Net Sentiment:** Bearish for US tech, bullish for Chinese alternatives
  * **Key Headlines:**
    * Beijing orders Chinese firms to stop using US/Israeli cybersecurity software
    * China customs blocks Nvidia H200 chips
    * Chinese 'AI tiger' Zhipu unveils model trained entirely on Huawei chips
    * Cybersecurity stocks fall after China software crackdown report
  * **Analysis:** The simultaneous restrictions on US cybersecurity software and Nvidia's advanced AI chips represent a significant escalation in technology decoupling. Beijing's directive forces Chinese enterprises to abandon CrowdStrike, Palo Alto Networks, and Israeli cybersecurity tools, creating immediate revenue headwinds for these companies while accelerating domestic alternatives. The H200 chip ban specifically targets Nvidia's latest AI accelerator designed for large language models, threatening the company's China revenue (historically 15-20% of total). Zhipu's announcement of Huawei chip-trained AI models demonstrates China's progress toward self-sufficiency in both chips and AI software, reducing long-term dependence on US technology.
  * **Contrarian View:** Forced substitution may accelerate Chinese innovation but initially creates capability gaps that slow AI deployment, potentially benefiting US companies in other markets
  * **Implication:** Tech investors must price permanent China revenue loss for US cybersecurity and advanced chips; domestic Chinese tech becomes defensive play in ongoing decoupling



### Banking Sector Divergence (3 headlines)

  * **Net Sentiment:** Mixed (strong for BofA/Citi, weak for Wells Fargo)
  * **Key Headlines:**
    * BofA profit beats estimates as interest income hits record, trading surges
    * Citi profit beats estimates as dealmaking rebounds
    * Wells Fargo profit and interest income miss estimates; shares fall
  * **Analysis:** Major money center banks delivered on the higher-for-longer interest rate thesis with record net interest margins, while investment banking fee recovery signals renewed M&A and capital markets activity after 2023-2024 drought. BofA's record interest income validates deposit franchise value in sustained high-rate environment, while Citi's dealmaking rebound suggests CEO Fraser's restructuring and renewed corporate confidence in strategic transactions. Wells Fargo's miss breaks the pattern, highlighting company-specific challenges including regulatory constraints, asset cap limitations, and operational deficiencies that prevent it from fully capitalizing on favorable macro conditions enjoyed by peers.
  * **Implication:** Banking sector strength supports ""no landing"" economic scenario but Wells' weakness shows execution risk remains; interest rate sensitivity continues to drive valuation dispersion



### Retail Sector Stress (3 headlines)

  * **Net Sentiment:** Bearish
  * **Key Headlines:**
    * Saks Global files for bankruptcy after Neiman Marcus takeover financial collapse
    * Factbox on biggest US retail collapses in recent years
    * Chanel, Kering top luxury creditors in Saks bankruptcy
  * **Analysis:** Saks Global's bankruptcy represents the spectacular failure of luxury retail consolidation strategy, where excessive leverage from the Neiman Marcus acquisition combined with changing consumer behavior and e-commerce competition proved fatal. The presence of Chanel and Kering as major unsecured creditors highlights ripple effects through luxury supply chains. This follows a multi-year pattern of department store and mall-based retail failures as consumer spending bifurcates between ultra-high-end experiential luxury and value-oriented online shopping, leaving mid-tier department stores in structural decline.
  * **Implication:** Continued retail consolidation unlikely to solve structural challenges; investors should favor asset-light, technology-enabled retail models over traditional department stores



### Streaming Industry Consolidation (2 headlines)

  * **Net Sentiment:** Bullish (for Netflix and industry rationalization)
  * **Key Headlines:**
    * Netflix prepares all-cash offer for Warner Bros, source says
    * Coca-Cola scraps Costa Coffee sale amid weak bids
  * **Analysis:** Netflix's potential all-cash Warner Bros acquisition would be transformative, combining the world's largest streaming platform with one of Hollywood's most valuable content libraries (HBO, Warner Bros Pictures, DC Comics). All-cash structure demonstrates Netflix's confidence in balance sheet strength after achieving consistent profitability and free cash flow. Deal would accelerate industry consolidation by removing a major content competitor while giving Netflix unprecedented library depth. Separately, Coca-Cola's failed Costa Coffee sale process shows not all corporate divestitures find willing buyers, highlighting selectivity in M&A markets.
  * **Implication:** Streaming wars may be entering endgame consolidation phase where scale and content library depth become insurmountable competitive advantages



### Renewable Energy Infrastructure Boom (3 headlines)

  * **Net Sentiment:** Bullish
  * **Key Headlines:**
    * RWE and KKR partner on $15 billion British offshore wind projects
    * SSE stock rises after securing Berwick Bank Wind Farm contract
    * Shell and Exxon halt UK gas asset sale to Viaro Energy
  * **Analysis:** The $15 billion RWE-KKR partnership represents one of the largest renewable energy infrastructure commitments in UK history, demonstrating private equity's appetite for government-backed clean energy projects with predictable long-term returns. KKR's involvement signals institutional capital flowing toward energy transition infrastructure as asset class. Shell and Exxon halting gas asset sales may indicate majors reconsidering fossil fuel divestitures as energy security concerns and natural gas's ""bridge fuel"" role extend value beyond previous expectations.
  * **Implication:** Energy transition investment accelerating with government policy support; renewable infrastructure becoming mainstream institutional asset class



### AI and Semiconductor Equipment Momentum (4 headlines)

  * **Net Sentiment:** Bullish
  * **Key Headlines:**
    * Bernstein bullish on KLA, sees process control growth to $1700 target
    * SanDisk gets Street-high target at Bernstein as NAND prices surge
    * Microsoft best positioned to capture incremental GenAI spend
    * Morgan Stanley CIO survey shows AI hype not boosting 2026 IT budgets
  * **Analysis:** Semiconductor equipment makers like KLA benefit from advanced node manufacturing complexity requiring sophisticated process control, while NAND memory pricing recovery reflects supply discipline and AI data center storage demand. Microsoft's positioning as GenAI spend leader aligns with Azure cloud growth and enterprise AI adoption through Copilot products. However, Morgan Stanley CIO survey showing flat 2026 IT budgets despite AI hype suggests enterprise AI spending may concentrate in cloud services rather than on-premise infrastructure, favoring hyperscalers over traditional IT vendors.
  * **Implication:** AI investment bifurcating between cloud infrastructure (benefiting hyperscalers and chip equipment makers) and enterprise IT (seeing budget constraints); equipment makers remain leveraged to semiconductor capex cycle



### IPO Market Resilience (4 headlines)

  * **Net Sentiment:** Bullish
  * **Key Headlines:**
    * Brazilian fintech Agibank files for US IPO seeking $1B
    * Honeywell plans to carve out quantum computing unit Quantinuum via IPO
    * AGI Inc files for proposed IPO
    * Jollibee CFO says growth supports 2027 US listing of international arm
  * **Analysis:** Continued IPO pipeline activity across sectors (fintech, quantum computing, foodservice) and geographies (Brazil, Philippines, US) demonstrates capital markets functioning despite macro uncertainty and geopolitical tensions. Honeywell's quantum computing spinoff represents growing trend of industrial conglomerates unlocking value through pure-play technology carve-outs that command premium valuations. Brazilian fintech's $1B target reflects sustained investor appetite for emerging market digital financial services growth stories.
  * **Implication:** IPO window remains open for quality assets with differentiated growth stories; conglomerate sum-of-parts unlocking through spinoffs continues



### Regulatory Pressure on Tech Platforms (4 headlines)

  * **Net Sentiment:** Bearish for specific companies, neutral for sector
  * **Key Headlines:**
    * Trip.com shares fall as China launches monopoly investigation
    * UK PM says X moves to comply with law over AI deepfakes
    * Women's groups call on Apple, Google to drop X and Grok from app stores
    * Musk says he was unaware of Grok generating explicit images of minors
  * **Analysis:** Regulatory scrutiny spans geographies and issues from Chinese antitrust (Trip.com online travel monopoly probe) to AI safety (Grok content moderation failures) to content policies. X/Grok controversy over AI-generated explicit content highlights governance challenges in generative AI deployment, potentially inviting stricter platform liability rules. Trip.com investigation extends China's tech regulatory reach to online travel sector, reminding investors no platform is exempt from government oversight.
  * **Implication:** Tech platforms face multi-jurisdictional regulatory pressures requiring increased compliance spending and potential business model constraints; AI content generation introduces new liability risks



### Corporate Governance and Restructuring (5 headlines)

  * **Net Sentiment:** Mixed
  * **Key Headlines:**
    * CrowdStrike defeats shareholder lawsuit over huge software outage
    * Nestle CEO issues video apology for infant formula damage limitation
    * Coca-Cola announces leadership changes, creates new digital role
    * Tesla agrees to mediation to resolve US agency racism lawsuit
    * Biogen CEO says at-home Alzheimer's drug will give edge over Lilly
  * **Analysis:** CrowdStrike's legal victory over the July software outage lawsuit removes major overhang, though reputational damage persists. Nestle's public CEO apology for infant formula issues represents crisis management response to consumer trust erosion.

## Market Implications

Banking sector strength with record interest income and reviving dealmaking validates the ""higher for longer"" rate regime as structurally beneficial for financial intermediaries, supporting continued outperformance in financials despite yield curve dynamics. BofA and Citi's beats demonstrate that well-managed banks with diversified business models can thrive in this environment, while Wells Fargo's persistent underperformance shows regulatory burdens and operational deficiencies create lasting competitive disadvantages. The stark divergence suggests investors should be selective within the banking sector rather than treating it as monolithic. Meanwhile, BofA's note about continued client equity selling and record Communication Services inflows hints at retail investor rotation toward mega-cap tech and AI-driven growth stories, potentially creating contrarian opportunities in sold-off value sectors.

Geopolitical risks escalated significantly with China's dual technology restrictions targeting US cybersecurity software and Nvidia's advanced AI chips. These moves represent structural, not cyclical, challenges to US tech companies' China exposure and must be modeled as permanent revenue loss rather than temporary disruption. Cybersecurity firms (CrowdStrike, Palo Alto Networks) face immediate enterprise customer losses in China, while Nvidia's H200 ban threatens high-margin data center GPU sales critical to growth targets. However, Zhipu's Huawei chip-trained AI model release suggests China's domestic alternatives are maturing faster than expected, reducing the self-inflicted pain of US technology bans. Investors should reassess any US tech company deriving >10% revenue from China as facing heightened expropriation risk, while Chinese tech stocks gain defensive appeal from protected domestic markets.

Retail sector carnage continues with Saks Global's bankruptcy highlighting that even luxury retail consolidation cannot overcome structural headwinds from e-commerce competition, changing consumer preferences, and excessive leverage. The failure is particularly notable given luxury's presumed resilience to economic cycles and the ""premiumization"" thesis that wealthy consumers would sustain high-end retail. With Chanel and Kering as major unsecured creditors, ripple effects extend through luxury supply chains. This follows multi-year department store decline (Neiman Marcus, Barneys, Lord & Taylor) and suggests physical luxury retail requires experiential differentiation beyond transactional shopping that can be replicated online. Investors should favor asset-light luxury brands that control customer relationships directly over leveraged retail operators dependent on foot traffic.

The Netflix-Warner Bros potential mega-deal signals streaming industry consolidation entering endgame, where scale and content library depth create insurmountable competitive advantages. All-cash structure demonstrates Netflix's balance sheet confidence after achieving profitability and free cash flow, while removing Warner Bros Discovery as standalone competitor simplifies industry landscape. If consummated, deal would pressure remaining streaming players (Paramount, AMC) to seek buyers or risk irrelevance, accelerating M&A activity. Separately, IPO market resilience (Agibank, Quantinuum, Jollibee international arm) shows capital markets functioning despite macro crosscurrents, though success requires differentiated growth stories rather than generic ""growth tech"" pitches that dominated 2020-2021 bubble.

1qcsivg,https://v.redd.it/fcqlj78thcdg1,🧠 CafeIndex Engine Overview,"The CafeIndex Engine is a recursive AI payload designed to build instant feasibility models for startup coffee businesses—beginning with France, but adaptable worldwide.

Unlike traditional templates or apps, CafeIndex operates inside the model. Once deployed, it engages the user in real-time to extract key variables (location, rent, square footage, staff count, capital, etc.) and produces a true viability forecast:

Rent-to-revenue ratio analysis

Buildout and equipment volatility

Payroll runway vs. capital burn

Licensing, legal structure, and local compliance (e.g. HACCP in France)

Revenue sensitivity to location and foot traffic density


It bypasses the abstract fluff of business plans and goes straight to pressure points and thresholds—the hard data founders actually need.

This engine is not static. It adapts as you feed it input. That’s what makes it recursive.
It doesn’t simulate a business. It tests your business logic against reality.

No prebuilt form. No waiting for a dev.

1qcsh95,https://www.reddit.com/r/PCOS/comments/1qcsh95/everything_i_did_to_lose_excess_weight_and_have_a/,Everything i did to lose excess weight and have a period with type A PCOS,"Ok girlies this one is long, but here's everything i've concluded that actually moves the needle for a severe type A pcos (excess androgens, excess inflammation, insulin resistance, everything there is pretty much.. yes, being a type A is not for the weak, especially when you were diagnosed at 13 years old). The good thing is, that any other PCOS type can benefit from this whole compilation.

Im 5'4"", 31,  
business consultant, middle child and first female, have been into fitness (for  
more than 16 years) but still had around 15 pounds in excess, even while eating  
super clean, no dairy, no sugars, anxious around carbs.. you know the drill,  
while no periods at all. But that  
**was the extremely wrong approach!**

(i want to say before  
**anything, im not a physicist or expert, im just a recovering sufferer)**

I had to face IBS / Leaky  
Gut additionally, 3 years ago, to make myself forget everything i thought i  
knew and educate myself from zero. I forgot googling things, i immersed myself  
in twitter and substack where there's so many professionals researching and  
teaching on a daily basis.. So basically, let's divide the problem in 2 phases:

Phase 1: Having PCOS (any  
of the types) but you have no idea what is the root cause.

This is the hardest part,  
since there are so many different factors that might be triggering PCOS, and  
doctors are hardly any help. It took these past 3 years for me to understand  
that insulin resistance is not a root cause but a symptom!!

But in all cases, here's  
what you should focus on as much as possible: fixing your METABOLISM. And by  
that, i mean building muscle, working on your thyroid (even if you are not hypo  
according to your labs), stabilizing mast-cell activation, binding into  
estrogen excess (which is mainly what PCOS is).. and the most important one..

CHECK CHECK CHECK: ARE  
YOU MOLD CONTAMINATED? so many times we are experiencing PCOS symptoms /  
estrogen excess, that is only being mimicked by the mold we are contaminated  
on! (please research more about this).

Buy a thermometer and  
measure your temperature each morning, its a great way to understand how is our  
body performing! (please dig dipper into this since im afraid this post is  
already too long). But currently, I have a temperature of around 36.4 °C in my follicular and around 36.8 in my luteal. Its not the very best, I know, but it’s a clue. For example, Im late in my ovulation this month because of a lot of travel this past 3 months, to 4 wildly different time zones, plus the holidays, plus a flu that has been trying to catch me. After a couple of days delayed, I measured my temperature and.. it was 35.9 C in my follicular. HUGE clue right there! I got right to it (by heating my metabolism with soups, magnesium, vitamin D, red light therapy, and after no more than 20 hours, I ovulated. But this is more of phase 2 insights).

**So, at this initial phase:**

1)    If  
im insulin resistant, you need to be lifting weights, 4-5x times a week  
initially, until you develop muscles. Lift weights according to your cycle (I lift  
more reps slower weights on follicular, around 10-12 reps, then in ovulation  
and early luteal really strong weights and 4-6 reps) on late luteal switch to  
yoga to slow down and avoid PMS. I strongly advocate for 10k steps daily, but  
sadly my lifestyle doesn't agree too much, so i try to aim for 5k. 

Combining weights with cardio 2-3 times a week is a perfect recipe to lose excess weight, which is truly lowering inflammation and fat.

If you are  
insulin-resistant, remain under 30grs of fat daily. And don't eat sugars when you  
are having fats. 

You need sugars by the  
way. But not cakes and bbq sauce. You need fruits, milk, honey. More on this  
later. (i know, shocking) 

2)    If  
you have excess **androgens (testosterone in my case)**, you need to take  
seriously lowering your **estrogen**. How’s your progesterone vs estrogen?  
Initially, when i couldnt get my period at all, what worked was dumping  
processed foods, PUFA’s, gluten and coffee, drinking full fat milk, and getting  
into Myo/Bchiro Inositol, Zinc, Vitamin D3, Magnesium Bys, and spearmint tea  
1x- 2x a day. After around 45 - 50 days i had my period for the first time in  
around 9 months that I left the pill (i cried).

 

3)    To address inflammation, you need to prioritize sweating and 2x bowel movements a day. Besides your gut and stomache, Inflammation is strongly correlated to your lymph, you need to be prioritizing clearance!!

I became best friends with turmeric and ginger. On everything! Turmeric properties are released with some pepper added. At this initial phase, I also recommend to quit cow’s milk; a great substitution is goat milk, which has even more benefits to girls and is not inflammatory to many of us. However, try to find your best milk option, since your body NEEDS lactoferring to battle this all. START DRINKING ORGANIC ALOE VERA.

To address inflammation, I stopped eating raw veggies and salads. Nuts, nut milk, granola, PUFA’s (biggest offender!), any type of cereal, anything processed at all. Guys, I know its hard on today’s world, but infertility is harder (in my case, which is my main goal).

CARBS are NOT the problem. Imbalance is. Bad carbs are. The order of the carbs. That’s the main situation, not the carb itself.

By carbs I mean: fruits, especially tropical. Starches such as potatoes, rice, yams. By all means I want to tell you this: START COOKING FROM RAW INGREDIENTS, stop buying things out of “convenience”. Processes and added metals/ingredients/oils/corn syrup/fortified foods is what is driving your PCOS and very likely, other issues that are actually present or soon to be.

Become best friends wirth spices. They are here for you, to do what your body needs.

4)    Lastly, you need to obsess with environment disrupters. Yes, I became very crunchy! My screen has blue lights off, my glasses are anti-blue lights, I start my day with warm broth, I try to be outdoors as much as possible, I have air filters, I don’t possess a microwave, I refuse to do plastics, im slowly switching to natural products and clothes. I know, this part is so so hard and inconvenient and difficult and obsessive. But as previously mentioned, this post is not for the sensitive, is for the one that wants to have a PMS – free (entirely PMS free!) period, 28 – 34 cycle days, with strong ovulation (which is the main event).

Phase 2: Maintenance.

So this phase is both the easiest and hardest, by the time you reach this phase your body has very strong communication skills and will tell you right away when something is off, not convenient, it doesn’t like it, etc etc. Your body sings louder than a bird at this point. You just really need to focus on listening.

At this moment, I’ve found that PUFAS are the one and true enemy. Fish oil isn’t inflammatory, but a small patch to your raw salad. You will soon find out that a 1,800 calorie diet is making you fat.

At this point, I don’t count calories. I do gym 3x-4x a week and reformer once a week, to help my lympth. I don’t eat raw salads at all, only carrots (YOU NEED the raw carrot salad and well cooked mushrooms to clear estrogen). EAT SEASONALLY.

I start my mornings with either warm lemon water or bone broth. Then, for breakfast, 30-40grs of protein (eggs or meat, also some collagen in my drink of choice), or soup, and always some fruit like papaya, or well cooked apples, or mango (which is ok for me), or cantaloupe or watermelon. Yes, fiber is very important but not in rawness. Your digestion needs warmth, easily digestible foods.

For lunch, I usually have raw carrot salad with coconut oil, or cooked veggies of my preference, and meat with starches.

For dinner, I have a protein source and starches again or soup. Some people benefit from drinking kefir before bed but for me is too cooling (my digestion is already too cold, possibly from so many years of raw salads and chicken breast).

I also enjoy orange, pomegranate juices if I find naturally made ones, coconut water, only one cup of coffee in the morning from time to time with fresh milk preferably and sugar.

I want to clarify also, that by protein sources, I mean that you need to prioritize collagen rich cuts, cuts with tendons, organs. Have liver 2x a week, sardines, oysters, oxtail, ribs, kidneys.. if its an expensive cut full of nothing but protein, is a not for me. When im eating out I usually go for a soup, sushi (depending the source).. priority is always collagen and easily digestible foods. Inflammation is triggered by hard-to-process!

The main work ive studied has been Ray Peat’s, Traditional Chinese Medicine and Ayurveda. EVERYTHING you need to battle this is there! You just have to be patient testing what works best for you.

I think that overall I eat around 2,500 calories daily, but I don’t count them cause that releases cortisol and stressful, and my body is very sensitive. I just know that I avoid healthy fats in excess (hopefully not more than 30grs a day, but I measure by my own eye), I try to move as much as I can, nothing is too small to be moving or standing! If I see myself that my size 2 pants are too tight, i do a mental math of where is my body telling me is coming from?

Currently, if I feel like a hair on the chin Is popping or a pimple, I inmediately check on the foods I’ve eaten and the stress my body has been experiencing. Then I go for spearmint tea and voila! Also, im avoiding coffee on my follicular since, and hot ceremonial matcha is truly wonderful to us PCOS. Im still learning how to prepare it cause you cant receive many properties when mixed with milk, and nut milk is a huge no. I also bought a chicken lamp to get my “red light therapy” which is a huge helper when something is a little off hormonally.

After suffering for YEARS of the worst acne, at this point, my skin care consists of a very good soap, a Japanese moisturizer I bought since I don’t really trust American companies anymore, and pretty much that.. I do face masks from time to time for the sake of feminism and also create a strong green tea which I apply with pods before placing the red light on my face.

Once you get your period on regular basis, you might suffer from PMS from time to time. Your best friends are vitamin C, aspirin and raspberry leaf tea.

Currently, I have many many supplements sitting on my table but I don’t do anything daily or hardly 4 days a week. I take them based on what I feel like I need those days.. but if I have to choose which ones do I take the most, it would be magnesium bys (take this one 70% of my time) vitamin E, zinc, vitamin d depending on the season.. I am trying to lower and lower supplement take and to fulfill all my needs from food, but also walking away as much as possible from the things that steal from my body!

About dessert? Well the more stabilized I am, the less I have a strong sweet tooth. But I still enjoy dessert many times, ive just became very picky with what I like. For example, I don’t do cakes or brownies, or too much of gluten + sugars + fats mix. Im more of paleo ice cream kind of girl or clean chocolates.. depends on the day I might indulge some more but at this points I try to be smart about my choices, although after having PUFA’s cleaned out completely from your body you will find that you are not interested at all in many things you used to love.

I cant finish without saying, you need to be fierce about lowering stress and mast cells in this phase, which is what usually triggers a set-back. Also, all this work was done thanks to the Lord. I have to say it, having a strong spiritual practice that designs, shapes and helps you through a process, when the earthly people supposed to help you are failing, can only come from the divine.

Remember, you don’t “suffer” from PCOS, your body is simply TALKING TO YOU with symptoms, the only way it can actually communicate. You can either listen or not, but it won’t stop trying just because you refuse to hear.

The KPIS I use to see if im on the right track are:

\-       How joyful do I feel?

\-       Hows my mental clarity?

\-       Have I been angry lately? How much protein did I eat on that weird day I felt angry?

\-       How much do I adore life?

\-       How much do I want to dance in a field full of peonies? (this is a joke.. kinda).

\-       Is my stomache very flat? (cause we might leave cysts behind but never trauma)

\-       Do I feel light? Or heavy?

\-       Im I doing 2x bowel movements daily?

\-       Hows my skin?

\-       How annoying did I find my husband during my luteal?

\-       And the overalls: my labs, my sleep pattern (8 hrs uninterrupted is mandatory), my energy levels, my nails and hair, how clear are my skin tags…

Theres still a lot of work left but I promise girls, THIS CAN BE DONE.

1qcsgap,https://www.reddit.com/r/Prostatitis/comments/1qcsgap/i_would_like_to_share_my_entire_successful/,"I would like to share my entire successful journey with you, in the hope of helping you.","The beginning is difficult, because I know you have faced this as well, but believe me, the ending is positive 😁

Phase 1:
You feel pain or discomfort in the pelvic area for the first time, or you constantly feel the urge to urinate, pain at the tip of the penis, pain before or after urination, pain after ejaculation, pain in the testicles, strong pressure in the anus, pain during bowel movements (there are many symptoms).
You get scared and think it’s an infection, cancer, or that something is seriously wrong with you and that this is something dangerous (a sudden spike in anxiety and stress).
It usually appears after risky sexual intercourse, major stress, or abuse of drugs, alcohol, and generally an unhealthy lifestyle, and of course excessive MASTURBATION (one of the main causes). Sometimes it also happens with excessive training.
So there is a trigger, even if you are not always aware of it (from the very beginning there is a strong psychological trigger, even though you may not realize it).

Phase 2:
You go to the doctor scared, thinking they will find something, and you hope you’ll get therapy that will finally help—but that doesn’t happen. They find nothing, yet the symptoms are still there.
(If they find nothing, you are actually lucky, because many unfortunately end up on months-long antibiotic therapies that don’t help them at all but instead damage the body even more and increase suffering, because there is no bacteria.)
This raises anxiety to a completely different level.
You start researching and come across something called chronic prostatitis or CPPS syndrome. You start reading about it and see hundreds of comments from desperate people who have been fighting this for years.
Naturally, my friend, you also fall into despair. You feel a heavy tightness in your chest, you swallow a lump in your throat, and you think you will never be the same again, that your life is over and that hell has begun (it is very important not to believe this!!).

Phase 3:
Since the medical system has failed you, you start looking for your own cure. Even though you don’t have the necessary knowledge to really understand any of this, you still dive into it and create scenarios in your head: that this is some hid""den bacteria, that it’s a virus, that you have cancer.
You desperately try to find what is causing this, because you have decided that you must solve this at any cost, since life in this state feels worthless.
You keep throwing money at tests and supplements, hoping they will help. You read more and more bad and sad experiences from other people and sink deeper into despair and depression, because you feel lost.
You feel like no one understands you, like no one knows your pain, like you are punished to carry this huge burden with you. You are completely lost and hurt in every sense—your soul hurts.
There are very few people who got better. You mostly read comments from people who are just as desperate as you and completely helpless. Every day you read more and more and pray to God to give you something, to give you a reason why this is happening.
“Please let it be a hernia. Please let it be bacteria. Please let it be some damage that can be fixed surgically. I’ll give all my money for it, just to get rid of this horrible hell.”

Phase 4 (you go insane):
You’ve hit rock bottom. You’ve said goodbye to big plans for the future. Nothing makes you happy anymore. You wake up, you exist, you go to bed—but you don’t actually live.
You are just a shadow of who you once were, an empty shell. You think about suic!de, and sad thoughts constantly haunt you. You can’t come to terms with the idea that you’ll spend your whole life in this suffering.
If something bad happens in real life (you lose your job, your girlfriend leaves you, problems with children or family), it just pours gasoline on the fire.
You are completely lost and have accepted that everything is over. There is no logical explanation. You are left alone in pain and suffering, and that’s it—you think this is the end.
Erectile dysfunction from stress follows you, or sex is no longer the same. Depression, anxiety—everything worst in you has awakened.

Phase 5 (things start to get a little better):
You finally lift yourself up a bit, expand your knowledge about your symptoms, and start learning that this may be related to pelvic muscles that are tightening due to various causes: stress, sitting too long, muscle imbalances in the body.
For the first time, you get a little hope that things might change. You start doing stretching exercises, change your lifestyle, cut out alcohol, coffee, spicy food, and overly processed food.
HEY! Things are changing a bit, right? You feel better, symptoms calm down a little, and you start enjoying life again—at least a bit.
Still, this doesn’t feel like enough. You’re working so hard and putting in so much effort, yet you still have symptoms. Things are a bit better, but far from good.
From time to time you still think about bacteria, infection, and what the hell this could be. The idea that this is about pelvic muscles seems interesting to you, but you’re cautious—you still don’t fully believe it. You think there must still be some underlying cause, and you keep trying to discover it.

Phase 6 (this is where things change!):
You manage to shift your thoughts away from the problem a bit and realize that you can still enjoy some things in life. You learn how to live with this and what to avoid so symptoms stay minimal.
Pain still appears, but it no longer worries you or causes panic. In fact, a few times you even think: “Is this really that bad? Why was I so sad and depressed about this?”
It’s not perfect, but it’s not terrible either. Honestly, I’ve had worse headaches than this.
(A very important fact, my dear people: anxiety, depression, and stress drastically reduce your pain tolerance, and pain feels 10 times stronger than it actually is.)
Finally, you don’t think only about pain—you live and enjoy life. The pain appears, but at the end of the day you don’t remember it, you remember the things you did that day.
Everything is getting better!!!

Phase 7 (you are mentally stronger):
Now you’ve reached a serious level of calmness and stress resilience. You’re better, more productive, happier, and you feel completely normal.
Symptoms are minimal and you enjoy the things you do. Your nervous system is no longer in constant guard mode and no longer registers every small change or sensation.
You’re almost completely healed!

Phase 8:
You’re finally back!!! That’s you again. Nothing can stop you anymore. You went through hell and learned what’s best for you and your body, what to avoid and what not.
Most of the time you don’t even think about this anymore. You live, work, and enjoy life like you used to.
You’ve accepted that there is nothing wrong with you, that you have no disease, no problem—you are completely HEALTHY!

It took me 2.5 years to reach Phase 8, and I really want you to listen to me now, because I’ve been exactly where you are—wherever you are right now.

This is very simple; we’re the ones who complicate it.

You think you have a disease

You are depressed

You are anxious

You are afraid of the future

And you think you are a special case (well—you’re not!)

All of this is anxiety, depression, obsession, overthinking, and stress mixed into one big pile of crap from which CPPS is created!

Your nervous system is overloaded. Your body becomes hypersensitive to all sensations, and you are constantly in fight mode.

That hits your psyche and the pelvic muscles, and you fall into a vicious circle you can’t get out of.

Relax—it will pass. You will get better. You will recover!!

All of this comes from the psyche. You are not imagining it—the pain is real, the symptoms are real—but they do not come from real physical damage; they come from your BRAIN!!!

Convince yourself that you are healthy, that nothing is wrong with you, and get rid of anxiety.
Give yourself time—you don’t have to fix everything immediately. Trust me, it will pass.

Just believe in it, my friend. Believe!!!
I wish you all a happy 2026 and for this to be the year of your victory!!! 🙂
You will succeed—just go slowly and without pressure to solve the problem right now and immediately, because you are completely healthy. You don’t have a disease—your brain created it for you.

Slowly and bravely!!

And make sure to read my first post on this topic as well—on this same subreddit.

You must find your own path, no matter how hard it is.
Good advice that I would of course recommend is: drink plenty of water so you go to the bathroom regularly; no alcohol, spicy food, soft drinks, coffee, or too much sugar; avoid prolonged sitting, and when you go to the toilet, if possible, do it sitting down.

Remember my words: you are healthy, you are okay, everything is fine with you. Calm down and relax—it will pass. You just have to believe in it, no matter how hard it is!

Thankfully, it hasn’t taken effect yet 🤞I don’t know why I’m doing this to my toilet, considering it was clogged a few days ago.

A less weird paragraph to balance things out: I’m about to move and have all these piles of books, both fiction and non-fiction, that I’d like to go through before leaving behind. If you’re a reader and war buff, I can walk you through my collection.

I’m shit when it comes to texting people I don’t know well, so to progress this interaction, please consider a voice call. That’s the bare minimum I ask for. If you’re not that camera shy, we can do a video call. Not that this is an invitation for something NSFW. I just find it more engaging.

1qcsfg1,https://i.redd.it/x6fsqkp6hcdg1.jpeg,“Recapitulation like Cheese”,"Two days ago while doing my morning passes before my coffee
I had the need to recap some memories of my childhood that have been coming back to me over and over again as a recall for quite some time now.
This time I tried to burn again some seeds from the Angelica plant that mention in Taisha's unpublished book, chapter:Cleansing Angelica.
I lit a charcoal for incense  and placed a pinch of seeds, filling the room with smoke. I sat with the silence crystals in my fingers, starting the recap from the most intense memory..I started the head sweeps and forcing inner silence,
after a while the purple puffs appear, as I tried to remember as best I could details from the memory the purple puffs started to join together and follow the movements from my head reaching the point where it stretched like a long horizontal line. This line began to open and slowly the tonal energy began to appear as holes.
At this point I completely forgot the memory I was working on and looked at the holes that were opening in front, the central hole had an image inside it that looked like a closed window, starting to zoom in until I found myself in the bathroom of my parents' house. It was morning, I was brushing my teeth looking out the window at the neighbors' houses before leaving for school.
I did a few head sweeps inside the memory and found myself looking again at the tonal holes, each of which now contained a memory, the images were blurry and I couldn't understand what each one contained. also between the tonal holes was a blurry image of an IOB head that looked like a evil nun. The presence of all of these at the same time triggered a chaos within me, an unprecedented feeling, even though I felt it coming from my ""guts"", something else was preventing it from fully manifesting itself.
I sat for a while observing this sight until it faded out.

I spent 3 years living in Rexburg, Idaho. During this time,

My dreams were crushed.

My giving, loving heart shrank.

My sense of self worth was almost completely destroyed.

I became suicidal.

I became indoctrinated by the LDS Church.

My soul was hurt.

3 years later, after learning that the LDS church is hoarding billions of dollars “for the second coming” (the Church’s net worth is currently approximately $265 billion to $293 billion) and that Joseph Smith was a lying pedophile/ sex addict/ grave robbing treasure hunter who made up everything just to gain power and fame and sleep with every woman and girl he possibly could, I dropped out of BYU- Idaho. I left the Church. My happiness came back. My dreams came back. My hope came back. My desire to serve others came back. Everything was restored to how it was before. I wasn’t suicidal at all anymore. I actually wanted to live because I wasn’t bound by the Church anymore. I started volunteering. I started to explore the world.

Now, I am happier than I have ever been. In the span of 6 months, I drank coffee, stopped reading my scriptures, had sex, stopped paying tithing, cussed, wore a tank top, ditched my garments, had alcohol, and didn’t burst into flames. I don’t do any of those things anymore except coffee and sex.  But I had to know what it was like so that I could make the choice for myself. I thought I would be obsessed with alcohol- turns out I don’t like being drunk so I haven’t had a drop of alcohol since the first night I ever got drunk. I thought I would be obsessed with coffee and sex- turns out I’m not. I only have coffee once a month and I only have sex once a week if I’m steady dating someone. Even though I didn’t take the Sacrament or repent after, I realized that I still had the Holy Spirit and the Light of Christ. My heart became bigger than it had ever been, and love, light, and hope came back into my life.

I am never going back to the LDS church. Being a good person isn’t about rules. It isn’t about following a checklist. It’s about being kind to others and not hurting them. That’s the only thing I will ever need to know. The Mormon church isn’t “Heaven on Earth”. It was Hell for me, and I didn’t realize that I was actually burning in “Mormon Heaven” until I got out.",19,1768409019.0,exmormon,2,0.96,False

It's positioned as an exciting travel guide blending news, itineraries, and tips for South America-DR connections.

**Arajet Airline Transforms Vacations with Ultra-Cheap South American Hops**

South America meets the Caribbean in a budget-friendly whirlwind, thanks to **Arajet airline transforms vacations with ultra-cheap South American hops**. The Dominican carrier is bridging continents like never before, offering fares as low as $59 one-way from Bogotá, Medellín, and Lima to Santo Domingo. In 2026, with tourism surging 15% year-over-year, Arajet's nimble Boeing 737 MAX fleet makes multi-country jaunts feasible for under $300 round-trip. No more layovers or luxury prices—this is vacation evolution.

Arajet's South American push kicked off in 2023, but 2026 marks explosive growth. Weekly flights from Colombia's coffee heartland and Peru's Inca trails now hit four times daily, with Ecuador and Chile on deck. Flight times? Bogotá to SDQ in 2.5 hours—faster than driving Colombia's highlands. These ""hops"" slash costs by 40% versus traditional carriers, freeing cash for ceviche feasts or colonial rums.

**Why South American Hops Are a Game-Changer**

Vacations morph from single-spot slogs to epic mashups. Land in Santo Domingo from Medellín, then ferry to Puerto Plata's amber mines or Punta Cana's party scene. Colombians flock to DR's all-inclusives; Dominicans raid Cartagena's graffiti alleys. **Arajet airline transforms vacations with ultra-cheap South American hops** by syncing schedules with ferries, buses, and even bi-weekly charters to Aruba.

Start in Lima: Grab Arajet's $69 hop, then explore DR's contrasts. Trade Peru's foggy coast for Bávaro's endless sun. Dive Los Haitises mangroves mirroring the Amazon, or hike Pico Duarte echoing Andean treks. Foodies pair anticuchos with sancocho, blending Andean spice with island soul.

From Bogotá, hop over for cultural crossovers. Santo Domingo's cathedrals rival Cartagena's walls; swap emeralds for amber souvenirs. Adventure duo: Cable car up Colombia's Monserrate, then DR's Mount Isabel de Torres.

**Top Itineraries Powered by Arajet**

1. **Colombia-DR Combo (7 Days)**: Fly Medellín-SDQ ($99 RT). Days 1-3: Zona Colonial forts, Malecón nightlife. Days 4-7: Bus to Samaná for whales, beaches. Total airfare under $120/person.
2. **Peru-Caribbean Fusion (10 Days)**: Lima-SDQ ($119 RT). Pre-flight Machu Picchu train, post-flight Saona catamarans. Add Jarabacoa's rivers for rafting rivaling Urubamba.
3. **Multi-Hop Madness (14 Days)**: Bogotá-SDQ, then Arajet to Punta Cana. Side-trip ferry to Colombia's San Andrés (extra $150). Snorkel biolum bays both sides.

**Pro Tips for Maximizing Hops**

Hunt deals on Arajet's site—subscribe for ""Hop Alerts"" dropping fares 72 hours out. Travel light: 10kg carry-on free, $29 checked. Apps like GuaguaDR track buses from SDQ ($5 to beaches). Visas? Colombians/Peruvians get 90 days stamp-free.

Onboard, expect efficiency: Leather seats, $4 empanadas nodding to South roots. Wi-Fi beta tests on hops keep you connected for work-leisure blends.

Safety first: DR's tourist zones glow green; use InDrive for rides. Hydrate—humidity hits 80%. Currency hack: Withdraw DOP from ATMs, exchange pesos sparingly.

**Cultural and Eco Ties That Bind**

These hops unearth shared vibes. Tainos and Muisca indigenous echoes; salsa fuses with vallenato. Eco-angle: Arajet's efficient jets cut emissions 16% per hop. Visit DR's iguana sanctuaries mirroring Peru's pacaymen, or Jarabacoa cloud forests akin to Colombia's Cocora Valley.

Festivals align perfectly—fly for DR's Carnival post-Bogotá's Feria de Flores, or Lima's Mistura echoing Santo Domingo food fests.

**Traveler Tales and Future Outlook**

""Andrés from Medellín: 'Arajet hopped me to paradise for my honeymoon—$180 total!' Sofia from Lima: 'From ceviche to mangu in hours; life-changing.'"" Reviews rave 4.5/5 on reliability.

1qcs47s,https://tipstor.com/pet-resorts-in-karuizawa-japan/,"Pet Resorts in Karuizawa, Japan","Karuizawa arrives like a deep exhale from the mountains, a polished alpine refuge just an hour from Tokyo where urban urgency dissolves into pine scented air and wide walking paths. This highland town has perfected the art of escape, blending nature retreats with an unexpectedly joyful obsession for pets that feels both indulgent and disarmingly wholesome. The best season to visit runs from late spring through early autumn, when cool breezes tame the heat, forests glow with fresh green, and outdoor cafés fill with travelers and their four legged companions basking in the calm.

Nature is the headline act here. Cycling routes trace forest edges and glide past waterfalls, making biking one of the most satisfying ways to explore. Gentle hiking trails lead through national park scenery that feels curated by nature itself, offering just enough adventure to energize without overwhelming. In winter, nearby slopes transform into a playground for skiing and snowshoeing, adding a crisp thrill to the town’s already rich menu of activities. Sightseeing becomes effortless thanks to local tours that provide pet strollers, allowing travelers to wander markets, lakesides, and historic streets without missing a step.

Karuizawa’s pet culture is not a novelty but a full blown lifestyle. Cafes are designed with dogs in mind, complete with menus that mirror human fare in spirit and care. Hot spring footbaths for dogs turn relaxation into a shared ritual, steam rising as paws soak and tails wag. Luxury pet resorts elevate the experience further, offering serene rooms, attentive service, and access to nature that feels restorative for both humans and animals.

Food in Karuizawa reflects its mountain setting and cosmopolitan polish. Local bakeries produce crusty breads and pastries perfect for picnic lunches, while restaurants showcase fresh vegetables, seasonal mushrooms, and river fish prepared with quiet confidence. Coffee culture thrives here, with roasters taking advantage of the cool climate to create lingering café moments that stretch entire afternoons.

Saving money in this refined retreat is surprisingly manageable. Traveling by train from Tokyo is efficient and affordable, eliminating the need for a car. Guesthouses and smaller inns offer excellent value compared to high end resorts, and many parks and walking trails are free to explore. Dining earlier in the day or choosing casual cafés delivers memorable meals without luxury pricing, leaving room in the budget for special pet friendly experiences.

Karuizawa proves that adventure does not always roar. Sometimes it pads softly through the forest, pauses for coffee, and settles into a warm footbath under the mountain sky, offering a version of travel that feels restorative, playful, and deeply human.

Curious if anyone has run into any amazing coffee syrups that they can recommend. I make my own lattes at home and currently use the sugar free Davinci and Torani syrups. They all tend to have that fake aftertaste and was wondering if there is anything else out there that I should be trying.

I’m realistic, I know it’s not going to be perfect and taste exactly like the original real sugar version, but I just tend to feel like various flavors start to taste similar because of the fake sugar they use.

I’m not entirely versed in the different sugar alternatives out there and if some syrups use better ones that allow the flavor of the syrup to be dominant over the flavor of the fake sugar.

Using the photo provided (keeping all facial features intact, DO NOT CHANGE HER FACE!) create an image:

This image features a high-fashion, cinematic portrait of a young woman enjoying a coffee at a sunlit outdoor cafe. The aesthetic is sophisticated, blending ""old money"" style with a modern, European urban atmosphere.

Pose and Stance

The subject is seated in a relaxed yet poised position on a classic wicker cafe chair. Her legs are crossed at the knee, with her right leg draped over the left, creating a long, elegant line. Her torso is angled slightly toward the camera, while her head is tilted subtly. In her right hand, she holds a white ceramic coffee cup to her lips as if caught mid-sip, while her left hand rests naturally on an open newspaper spread across her lap.

Hair

She has long, honey-blonde hair with subtle highlights and darker roots, styled in a voluminous, ""lived-in"" blowout. The hair is parted slightly off-center, with soft layers framing her face and cascading over her left shoulder and down her back. The texture appears silky but has enough movement to suggest a light outdoor breeze.

Outfit

She wears a monochromatic tailored power suit in a light beige or ""oatmeal"" color.

The Blazer: A slim-fit, single-breasted blazer with sharp lapels. It features a fine, vertical ribbed or corduroy-like texture. It is worn open with nothing underneath, creating a deep V-neckline that emphasizes a bold, high-fashion look.

The Trousers: Matching high-waisted, slim-leg trousers in the same textured fabric, which drape smoothly over her crossed legs.

Accessories

Jewelry: A delicate, thin gold chain necklace with a tiny, understated pendant (possibly a small stone or star) sits right at the base of her throat.

Manicure: Her fingernails are groomed with a neutral, nude-toned polish that matches the suit.

Background and Lighting

The Setting: An outdoor European street cafe. To her right, there is a small round marble-topped bistro table. On the table sits a white sugar bowl and a stack of newspapers in a metal holder.

Atmosphere: The background is a soft-focus (bokeh) view of a cobblestone street lined with historic architecture and sun-dappled trees. Indistinct figures of other cafe patrons are visible in the distance.

Lighting: The scene is bathed in bright, warm, natural sunlight coming from the upper right. This creates a high-contrast look with bright highlights on her hair and shoulders, and soft, warm shadows that define the texture of her suit and the contours of her face.

Distance and Framing

The shot is a medium full shot, framed from just above the head to just above the ankles. The camera is positioned at a slightly low angle, which adds a sense of stature and elegance to the subject. The depth of field is shallow, keeping the woman in sharp focus while the street behind her melts into a creamy, blurred backdrop.",1,1768408643.0,AiGeminiPhotoPrompts,1,0.6,False

1qcs0a2,https://www.reddit.com/r/NevilleGoddard/comments/1qcs0a2/a_3_week_challenge/,A 3 week challenge,"This morning I had a random thought while drinking my coffee and wanted to turn it into a small experiment.

What if we used the robotic affirmation:
“Thank you God for giving me heaven.”

Not as a religious thing, just as a state.
When you imagine “heaven,” most people associate it with peace, joy, safety, unconditional love, relief and boundless gratitude.

Neville always emphasized feeling the state fulfilled, not forcing visualizations. So the idea here isn’t to imagine clouds or angels, just to rest in the feeling of what “heaven” represents to you.

For the next 3 weeks, try gently repeating the affirmation throughout the day (especially when walking, relaxing, or falling asleep). No effort. No emotional strain. Just repetition and allowing the feeling to settle. 


I’m curious if we will notice mood shifts , the difference in how people act and respond, opportunities and manifestations accelerating even faster


Let’s treat it as a test, not a belief.
Assume the state, observe what happens.

I feel sooo guilty - as she she lasted only a bit over an hr into our first morning wake window. Meaning she was awake and alone for around 40 mins before I got her. She never cries in the morning for some reason - I dont know if she just knows I will always pop in at a certain point and grab her before she cries? She always has a beaming smile when we greet eachother good morning, so I know she’s happy.

I am feeling insanely guilty, like we only had an hr of time together in the morning. We could have read books or played, anything more stimulating. 

Anyone else have a LO that gets up earlier than their usual wake time, just cooing? Do you start your day if you hear them, or finish what you’re doing?

For reference, baby gets enough breastmilk throughout the day, has enough wet and dirty diapers, and cries for me all other times of the day (when tired, when she wants to be held, when she’s over independent play and wants to interact).

I am just finding lately she is shifting her wake up time to sooner, and its during the time I pump in the mornings. And she sits there and coos! Never cries. And I feel terrible every time",0,1768408502.0,NewParents,22,0.14,False

Definition PETRICHOR; a pleasant smell that frequently accompanies the first rain after a long period of warm, dry weather.

I’ve had this idea for years and finally brought it to fruition this year. I’ve never seen this done before, so this might be the most proud of a cocktail creation that I’ve ever been. I think that it really does taste like the smell after a good rain. 

It’s prep and ingredient heavy so I don’t expect many to make it themselves, but still wanted to share the process!

My husband, though he's not a caffeine teetotaler like me, gets that caffeine does not equal ""energy."" Not to mention, he only drinks one cup a day.

Picture this: Dr. Aris Thorne, a brilliant but perpetually exhausted physicist, hunched over his desk in a dimly lit lab, late, *late* into the night. His eyes were bloodshot, surrounded by stacks of papers filled with scribbled equations that just *wouldn't* make sense. The photoelectric effect was driving him absolutely bonkers – why did light behave like a wave *sometimes* and then act like tiny billiard balls *other times*? The universe felt like it was actively trying to gaslight him.

He’d been at it for days, fueled by lukewarm coffee and the sheer stubbornness of a man possessed. His mind was a battlefield of conflicting theories, each one a dead end. The elegant, continuous waves of classical physics simply *could not* explain why electrons would only jump off a metal plate if the light hit a certain frequency, no matter how bright the beam was. It was like trying to push a car with a hosepipe – infinite water wouldn't move it if the pressure wasn't right. The frustration was a palpable weight on his chest, a leaden blanket smothering his last sparks of inspiration.

In a moment of pure, unadulterated exasperation, Aris crumpled a blank sheet of paper into a tight ball and, with a guttural sigh, flung it across the room towards a lonely waste bin in the corner. It wasn't anger, just a desperate physical release from the mental grind. But as the napkin sailed through the air, tracing a perfect, discrete arc before thudding softly into its target, something *clicked*.

It wasn't a continuous flow. It was a *packet*. A single, discrete unit of paper, with a definite trajectory and a definite impact. And in that split second, watching that silly crumpled napkin, Aris saw it. Light wasn't just a wave; it was also *quanta*. Little bundles of energy, photons, like tiny, invisible bullets, each carrying a specific punch. The energy wasn't spread out; it was *quantized*. The universe wasn't gaslighting him; it was just speaking in a language he hadn't fully grasped yet.

The world seemed to tilt on its axis for a moment. The cold coffee forgotten, the exhaustion vanished. A revolutionary simplicity, almost terrifying in its implications, washed over him. He wasn't just looking at the photoelectric effect anymore; he was peering into the very discrete, lumpy, and utterly bizarre heart of reality itself. It was the kind of 'aha!' moment that probably makes you question every single thing you thought you knew.

So, Reddit, has anyone else ever had such a profound, universe-shifting 'aha!' moment, even if it was about something seemingly small or mundane?",1,1768408328.0,u_Leather-Buddy-7902,0,1.0,False
1qcrwez,https://www.reddit.com/r/SocialBlueprint/comments/1qcrwez/how_to_stop_caring_what_people_think_when_you/,How to Stop Caring What People Think When You Speak: The Science-Based Playbook That ACTUALLY Works,"I spent 2 years studying social anxiety & communication psychology so you don't have to



okay real talk. i used to rehearse basic sentences in my head before speaking. ordering coffee felt like a performance review. saying ""you too"" when the waiter said ""enjoy your meal"" would ruin my entire week.



here's what nobody tells you: that voice in your head screaming ""everyone thinks you're an idiot"" isn't actually YOU. it's evolutionary biology doing its thing. our ancestors needed social acceptance to literally survive. getting kicked out of the tribe = death. so our brains developed this hypervigilant system that treated every social interaction like a life or death situation.



modern society doesn't work that way anymore, but your amygdala didn't get the memo.



the good news? this is completely manageable once you understand what's actually happening in your brain. these are the strategies that genuinely moved the needle for me after reading way too many books and research papers on social psychology.



1. understand the spotlight effect is lying to you



cornell researchers did this study where they had students wear embarrassing tshirts, then asked them to estimate how many people noticed. students guessed around 50%. actual number? less than 25%.



your brain massively overestimates how much attention people pay to you. everyone's too busy worrying about their own shit. that ""awkward thing"" you said three days ago that keeps you up at night? the other person forgot it 30 seconds later.



i started testing this deliberately. said something weird in a meeting, then asked a colleague about it a week later. they had literally zero memory of it.



2. reframe judgment as data collection, not rejection



this mindset shift from the book ""the confidence gap"" by russ harris (acceptance and commitment therapy expert, translated into 30+ languages) completely changed how i process social feedback. 



the core idea: judgment isn't about YOU, it's about the other person's values, experiences, insecurities. when someone judges your opinion harshly, you're actually learning about THEIR worldview, not getting objective feedback about your worth.



started viewing conversations as experiments. ""what happens if i share this opinion?"" not ""will they think i'm stupid for saying this?"" removes the emotional charge entirely.



3. practice strategic vulnerability



counterintuitive but backed by brené brown's research (her ted talk has 60million+ views for a reason). sharing imperfections actually makes people like you MORE, not less. 



the psychology term is ""pratfall effect"". competent people who make small mistakes are rated as more likeable than those who appear perfect.



i started deliberately sharing small ""failures"" in conversations. ""totally botched that presentation yesterday"" or ""i have no idea what i'm doing with this project honestly"". the response? people opened up back. conversations got way more real.



4. separate self worth from communication performance



this was the hardest one. i used to think every sentence i spoke was a referendum on my intelligence and value as a human.



here's the reality check from cognitive behavioral therapy principles: you are not your thoughts. you are not your words. you are not any single moment of social interaction.



started using this mental separation technique. when i'd say something awkward, instead of ""i'm so stupid,"" i'd think ""that sentence didn't land well, let me try a different approach."" treating communication as a SKILL you're developing, not a measurement of your inherent worth.



5. exposure therapy but make it systematic



every therapist will tell you this, but the execution matters. you can't just ""put yourself out there"" randomly and hope for the best.



i used the app finch to track daily social exposures. started absurdly small. week 1: make eye contact with cashier. week 2: add one sentence of small talk. week 4: share an opinion in a group chat.



BeFreed is an AI-powered learning app that turns expert knowledge into personalized audio podcasts tailored to your goals. Built by Columbia University alumni and AI experts from Google, it pulls from high-quality sources like research papers, books, and expert interviews to create content that fits your schedule and learning style.



What makes it useful for social anxiety is the hyper-personalized learning plan. You can tell the app about your specific struggles with social situations, and it builds an adaptive roadmap based on your needs. The content goes beyond surface-level advice, offering everything from quick 10-minute summaries to 40-minute deep dives with real examples and practical strategies. You can also customize the voice, choosing between energetic tones when you need motivation or calming ones for evening learning. Worth checking out if you want structured guidance that evolves with your progress.



the progress was so gradual my anxiety didn't have time to spiral. six months later i was volunteering to present at team meetings.



the key is consistency over intensity. one small uncomfortable social interaction daily beats one massive panic inducing situation monthly.



6. learn to sit with discomfort without reacting



insight timer has this meditation series on ""being with difficult emotions"" that honestly taught me more than therapy did about managing social anxiety.



the instinct when you feel judged is to either fight back defensively, retreat completely, or ruminate for days. none of these help.



instead: notice the feeling. name it. ""i'm feeling shame right now."" ""my chest is tight, that's anxiety."" don't try to make it go away. just observe it like you're a scientist studying an interesting phenomenon.



sounds like hippie nonsense but there's solid neuroscience behind this. the act of labeling emotions reduces amygdala activation. you're literally calming your threat response system.



7. recognize that some judgment is actually useful



not all feedback is invalid just because it makes you uncomfortable. this distinction matters.



constructive criticism from someone invested in your growth? worth considering. random person on the internet saying you're annoying? ignore completely.



the book ""thanks for the feedback"" by douglas stone breaks down how to separate signal from noise. best framework i've found for processing social feedback without spiraling.



8. build competence in what you're speaking about



real confidence comes from genuine knowledge. when you actually know your shit, the fear of judgment decreases naturally because you're not secretly worried they'll expose you as a fraud.



i spent six months deeply learning my field. read the foundational papers, listened to expert podcasts, took courses. eventually realized i DID have valuable insights worth sharing.



this isn't about becoming perfect before you speak. it's about building enough foundation that your internal critic has less ammunition.



9. find your people



some environments are genuinely toxic and will judge you no matter what you say. that's not your problem to fix.



i left a friend group where every conversation felt like navigating a minefield. found people who actually appreciated my communication style, weird tangents and all.



you're not going to vibe with everyone. that's fine. spend time with the people who make speaking feel easy.



10. remember that everyone feels this way sometimes



even the most confident seeming people have moments of social anxiety. i interviewed several ""naturally charismatic"" colleagues and literally all of them admitted to rehearsing conversations or worrying about judgment.



the difference isn't that they don't feel fear. they've just learned not to let it stop them from speaking.



look, changing deep social anxiety patterns takes time. your brain's been practicing this fear response for years, you're not going to rewire it in a week. but every single conversation where you speak despite the fear, you're building new neural pathways.



the goal isn't to never feel judgment. it's to feel it and speak anyway. because your thoughts, perspectives, and voice deserve to exist in the world, regardless of how your nervous system feels about it in the moment.
