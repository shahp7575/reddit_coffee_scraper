I just put together the first draft of a landing page for my first side project, a platform that helps people meet others spontaneously for activities like coffee, walks, gym, or concerts etc.

I’d love your honest feedback on the page itself — things like:

1oxe1m0,https://www.reddit.com/r/CultOfCyberfury/comments/1oxe1m0/thank_god_for_this_sub/,Thank God for this sub,"As stated above, thank you God for providing this sub. I just finished my yoga class and prayed to 33 different gods (Hinduism). The spiritual quest never ends before we have all purified our hearts and being. 

After yoga class I drove to get some food. I always enjoy it because I get to listen to my favourite audiobook: A New Earth - Meister Eckhart Tolle*.* A little coffee and a full stomach is all we need sometimes. Now I am sitting in meditative silence, working on my spirituality. I can really start to feel my chakra moving, my whole inner world settling into that warm, expansive stillness.

And then right as I am dissolving into cosmic oneness behind me I suddenly hear some unawakened bastard yelling: **“**This is a Wendys, lady.”

The timing was so brutalit felt like he startled my inner child straight out of its healing cave. Now I am crying. He really needs to work on his shadow self; I could practically feel the pain of his own inner child vibrating in the ignorance of his words. 

Better go now. I wish you all some good healing this weekend. May we all heal and save the world someday. Never give up on your dreams and stay strong <33

1oxe0xe,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1oxe0xe,Need advice on how to maintain untreated teak colour,"This is my first time refinishing a table. I bought this teak coffee table on Facebook Marketplace and have stripped it twice, then sanded with 80, 120, and 180 grit. 

I loved the unfinished look, but applied a water-based polycrylic to avoid more darkening, unfortunately it turned out much darker than expected. To my knowledge, oil-based finishes darken more over time and have more of a yellow tinge. 

Is it possible to re-strip it and maintain the natural, unfinished look of the teak? I’d prefer to keep it untreated if possible or recommendations for finishes that don’t darken the wood.

1oxdx6a,https://www.reddit.com/r/NRelationships/comments/1oxdx6a/i_think_i_fell_in_love_with_a_covert/,I think I fell in love with a covert,"Hey all, id love some clarity on my situation. For starters. I met this girl 13 years ago and dated her briefly (about 4 months). I absolutely fell for this girl. She was so sweet and caring to me as well as others. Around the 3 month mark, she told me she thinks she loves me and i felt the same. It didnt last long but the breakup was normal. Wrong place wrong time kind of thing. My heart was broken but it was what it was. We stayed friendly and every couple years wed link up for a night to catch up and hang. She took me out for my birthday once.

 A little over 2 years ago my mom passed of cancer. She called me that day and wanted to grab coffee but it just didnt happen, i kind of let it slip. I later contacted her to meet up and we reconnected. Shortly after we started dating and it was great. She told me she hadnt been with anyone for a year until this point which i dont believe now. She was the one that got away for me so i looked past a lot of things in our relationship. 

After about the 3 month mark, she started acting ""off"". The 3 months were clear idealization looking back and it was intense. Telling me things like ""youre the man i fell in love with a thousand years ago"". That it was fate we got back togther, how she never felt like this about anyone. We even waiting to have sex again for like 3 months. Early february my other ex was back in town and i told her me and friends were going to her moms house. I wanted to be honest and not start this by being untrustworthy. Contextually, my other exs grandmom was passing of cancer the same time as mine and this was long after me and this other girl broke up and she didnt even live in the state anymore. My other exs mom would invite me over to talk about what we were both going through and we became close through that. She seemed ok a the time but days after this i noticed recently she started bringing another guy friend up in conversation and texts and making plans with him. Im genuinely not a very jealous person so i didnt think much of it at the time. However learning about triangulation, i see it different in hindsight. 

Shortly after we ""hooked up"" again for the first time, she went to italy with her girlfriend. She became distant and never had time to talk and would tell me about this ""argentian guy"" she met and they were all hanging out. Id ask if she had time to talk and shed say ""cant, me and him and friends are going to a club"". 

Fast forward, there were little spouts of her being on edge almost. Bouncing between super happy and on edge. Then she would start just throwing digs at me and i would go ""yo that like really hurts my feelings, i dont appreciate it"" and she would tell me i feel attacked. This would progress. She would accuse me of behaviors i was 99% sure i wasnt doing. I know she had abusive relationships and i thought she was traumatized and projecting other dudes behaviors on me. Eventually she would accuse me of the things she was doing and when id say ""ok if im doing that im sorry, ill try to pay attentikn to it, but you do see you do those things to me right""? She would lose it and accuse me of not listening to her and make me feel like im downplaying her concerns and shes just trying to talk to me and im making it about myself. 

She would start a conversation angry and accuse me of something and when i would push back she would say i always want to start a fight, which i really dont. Im not big on confrontation and am honestly always trying to communicate healthily especially after years of therapy and being more open in relationships. This over time was making me feel insane. 

I took her to a music festival in april/may. I told her i loved her again during and she reciprocated. The next day she flipped out at me over nothing and i couldnt figure out what happened. Eventually she said ""i had to remember you werent a piece of shit"" followed by ""its no ones fault"". I said ""no, this is your fault, you lost it on me for no reason and cant apologize for it"". Later in the car i tried to hold her hand and she kept it going. Then i said (now in hindsight seeing how brutal this couldve felt to her) ""have you always been like this?"". More fighting in the hotel and i said ""just go shower, we can talk after"" and she followed with a ""how dare you"". We worked it out and went home.

 A few days went great together, we were past it. Then 1 day a ""good morning handsome"" text and then she turned cold and distant. For 3 days she barely gave me anything then wanted to meet at a park. The entire conversation that night was about how everything i remembered from the festival didnt happen the way i rememebered and that she did aplogize and i needed to take accountability. I told her ""well my truth of the night was..."" she followed with ""theres no your truth, just the truth"". Statements like this and ""my reality is the reality"" would become more frequent. More accusations thrown my way and then one thing she said i knew was absolutely not true and pushed back and even she took a step back. Weeks later she would deny saying this thing she said. 

She would say this a lot which bothers me in hindsight. ""Im collecting data"". I thought she meant looking for red flags but considering how she threw all my secrets and vulnerabilities and trauma in my face at the end i see it different now. She thanked me for ""being my parasite"" once for my streaming services but i might be reading into that one since im a little paranoid now lol.

Around the same time as the festival, we had plans to go to her younger sister and her fiances place. For context, when we dated years ago, me and her little sister had a great relationship, i always thought she was a good thing. Even after we broke up, her sister would contact me making sure i was doing ok and that was really sweet. When me and my ex started talking again she told me ""my sister always liked you. Shes asked me for years why im not with you because you were sweet and made me happy and loved me"". This meant a lot to me. When we went to their place, everything seemed off. I wasnt expecting anything crazy but she didnt seem like in any way happy to see me. It felt awkward. I made a small joke about my ex during a game, very innocent, nothing critical, just playful banter. When we left, she ripped my head off in the car and once again threatened our ""compatibility"". 

During the relationship, i started having panic attacks and couldnt sleep. I got diagnosed with an autoimmune disorder. She would criticize me for these moments and later use them to call me ""abusive"" even though nothing ever happened close to what would be considered that. Just flustered behavior. 

Last night i saw her, i was helping her paint her shower and we went to a bar. She would do this move. I try to pay at the bar and she would go ""no let me pay babe"" and id go ""thats sweet thank you"". Followed by ""oh my god i cant believe you let me pay. During drinks she goes ""i dont love you, i dont respect you, youre low energy and youre an awful boyfriend"". I was supposed to take her on a date early to this garden but because of my sleep issues i didnt get up. She cited this and told me this other guy ""from the beginning of this"" took her instead. We fought more and left.

When we got back to her place. She said i didnt have to help with the shower which i replied ""ofcourse ill help you"". She followed with ""i dont expect you to, i actually dont expect anything from you"".

Im like ""dude what is going on, why are you doing this??"". She wasnt giving me anything. At a point im like getting on the border of emotional and go ""why does it feel like you enjoy making me feel like shit""? She mocked me, leaned down to my dog and went ""aw buddy is this what you deal with all the time?"".

I got fed up, i called it and broke up with her. As i go to grab my dog, she bursts into tears out of nowhere, i was so confused. I walked up to her and said ""i cant believe i told my friends youre a good person"". Didnt know until later that when the tears started, she just so happened to be standing directly center of her porch camera..

Next day more fighting and her claiming she broke up with me which i found odd. I went to pick up my stuff snd she wasnt there and had all my things packed by her door. She knew i dated a narcissist before who did the same thing.

Later that day she texted in a panic saying somethings wrong, shes sick and scared. She told me ""im scared and youre the only person i want to talk to"". I immediately jumped into protector. She said ""thank you, i love you"". 

For 2 weeks she wanted to be on the phone all day and night, even on mute until morning cause it made her feel safe. I was happy to do it, i loved her. She told me she took me for granted. Wanted me to tell her i loved her again, wanted me to leave the country with her. Told me how much she appreciated me and how ive been there for her. Then one day had a party for her girlfriend and ghosted me all night. I never heard her voice again. Next day i asked if she was ok and she said she needs time to think. She had a nervous breakdown and that i caused it and she would call me in a day or 2. 

6 days later she texts wanting to meet up in a few days. I agreed. After i said ""hey im really confused about whats going on, can we talk later?"" She left me on read. An hour before the meetup, she texted me saying she cant see me, it hurts too much. She used to tell me that i was the first person to make her feel safe. Now i made her feel ""unsafe"". Shortly followed by a ""please dont make me block you"".

A week later i said i didnt know what happened and i want to try and figure this out. Asked if we could talk on the phone, she refused. She tore me apart for 2 hours blaming me for everything. She knew i was abused as a child. She told me ""she could never trust me with a child and that she wants one one day, but not with me. Told me i have a darkness inside of me, that im manipulative and a bully. I asked her if she met someone else and she called me a bully and that she ""needed a protector"" completely deflecting and then blamed and said i was deflecting. Called me abusive, although not physically. Everything was basically ""i love you but its your fault we cant be together. 

One critical thing i rememeber she said a month before was ""intentionally hurting yoj wouldnt come from me being emotional. It would be cold and calculated, and i dont do that"". Funny now looking at how everything went down.

I didnt know at the time she had already been smearing me online, not by name, but obviously directed at me. I didnt notice becsuse i unfollowed her after the breakup. Noticed later how her texting style was completely different and how it was only meant to exploit me later. I was so desperate i even aplogized for shit i didnt even do, solidifyjng her claims against me without realizing at the time. She set me up many times for things, and i had no idea. Manipulated and gaslit me till i didnt know who i was by the end.

Looking back, theres plenty of questionable moments. Most likely cheated on me for months. We never didnt use a condom even though she would make claims of ""i cant wait to not use one"". Was planting seeds in peoples heads about me.

Still theres times i cant help but think about. When she would bait me into an argument and i would ask ""why are you doing this"" and she would emotionally say ""you dont understand!""

One night i asked her ""is it possible youre so afraid of this being real and working out that you are subconciously sabbotaging the relationship"" and i saw a twitch in her head and she said ""i have to get some air"". 

I know i cant be with her. Ive accepted that and after everything, i cant get past everythjng she did to me. However, i still care about her and i wish i could find a way to get her to realize whats going on and get help. Unless she really enjoys what shes doing. Lookiing back on how calculated she was. I can tell shes been doing this for a long time. It was impressive.

I sent her a long message the day after everything full of all the anger and resentment i built up months. Called her a monster. Super not proud of myself for it. I know im better than that and i just proved the things she said about me. I always saw the fragile child inside of her and tried so hard to reach it and failed.

Sorry for how long this is, just didnt want to leave anything out even though i know i know theres plenty more.

Would love your thoughts on her behavior and if any of you identify with it and could tell me what any of it means in your perspective for clarity, id greatly appreciate it! Thanks all

1oxdtwn,https://www.reddit.com/r/AusPropertyChat/comments/1oxdtwn/are_we_being_fair_with_our_tenants/,Are we being fair with our tenants?,"I wanted to get some thoughts on a situation we’re dealing with. Please be kind our situation and recent discussion with our tenants has left me feeling very uncomfortable and upset. It’s not too heavy but I’m not good with confrontation.

We have had our unit rented out since 2011 and I think we’re good landlords. Our tenants say something is broken and we’re on the phone with our property manager straight away. Our tenants ask for a rent reduction when we increase our rent to market level, because they’re doing it tough, and we crunch the numbers and it works for us so we say yes.

We work with them when we do upgrades (and granted they work us too). So we’ve always had good relationships with all of our tenants.

Our current tenants have been with us for just over 4 years. Our rent gets paid, albeit apparently according to our manager they have been late quite often recently. They are quiet, they are easily approachable, easy to work with.

However in recent visits I’ve noticed the unit is in a very poor cleanliness condition. It has been for years and we’ve always commented to each other my husband and I that they are grubs but if that’s how they want to live that’s up to them. But on recent visit I noticed how bad it has gotten.

What made it really upsetting for me however was that there ware ingrained stains on our new kitchen which is 3 years old from them not cleaning up coffee spills straight away. There was also a heavy build up on the security mesh screen of salt, the unit is near the beach. Left unchecked this would degrade the screens quicker than if they had regular cleaning.

The unit is in a nice location, we don’t have heaps of money so all our upgrades are really important and we treat the property as a business putting all profits back into it so that we can generate a decent income from it in time.

So this broke my heart. I went to the property manager to ask her advice. She was straight onto it and said she’d do an inspection. I also asked if the cabinetry stains were damage or water and tear. Damage was the answer.

So the inspection report was not good the tenants had to do a major clean. Fast forward to yesterday when we came in to see how some recent flooring works had come up, our tenant asked to have a chat and so we did.

The bottom line was that he took no accountability for the stains and made excuses for not cleaning the screens to a certain level. Also blamed nearby construction for extra dust and a heavy workload for not cleaning the place.

Then he said that he deemed the stains as wear and tear and that he would go to court over it and that he knew a magistrate.

I would have been happy to work with him and find a solution to replace the cabinetry at a lower cost they’re just IKEA but that really upset me.

So we left with that I would talk to our property manager to get her advice.

Is what we have asked or pointed out fair?

I’m in Australia and the laws say the stains are damage.

We have worked hard to keep the property during difficult times and we would like to keep it to a certain standard. It’s a nice area and the unit is nicely presented but our tenants are not treating the way we would like it treated and it’s causing permanent damage that could easily have been avoided.

I.
Some days I felt like a burned-out house,
nothing left but char and rumor.
Then I noticed it—
a tiny ember under all that gray,
glowing like it had no intention
of going quietly
into anyone’s narrative.

II.
The spark wasn’t loud,
but it was stubborn.
It sat there under the wreckage
of everything I’d survived,
refusing to believe
that survival was the end
of the story.

III.
I breathed on it,
not with confidence,
but with curiosity.
What happens when a man
who remembers his soul
decides to see if he can burn again
without burning out?

IV.
Ash is just evidence
that something once lived loudly.
I stopped mourning the fire
and started thanking it
for leaving behind
a concentrated form of proof
that I had not been small.

V.
I collected my scattered embers—
the half-finished thoughts,
the abandoned dreams,
the pieces of myself
I’d called “too much.”
They recognized each other
like family at a reunion.

At the bottom is a section where you can list ""Things I want"". There is no budget, but this is my third Christmas and I'd say people normally spend $30-40 total including a few small gifts/candy leading up to the exchange and then the ""big"" gift exchanged at our Christmas party. Last year one of the things I listed was a new oil diffuser and I got it along with a few smaller items. Why am I blanking in this?? Lol I was thinking of putting something like books by XYZ author.

1oxdo1p,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1oxdo1p,Travel｜Reflections of a Malaysian 🇲🇾 Visiting Beijing,"The notion of travelling to Beijing first took root last year. While scrolling through Xiaohongshu, I came across ""The Autumn of Beiping in Lao She's Words"" and marvelled at how utterly beautiful Beijing looked amidst the blooming ginkgo trees. That planted the seed of visiting Beijing to savour its autumn splendour.
	
It took a year before I finally set foot in Beijing. Before departure, I heard reports of a sudden cold snap and feared autumn might vanish prematurely. Fortunately, the heavens granted my wish: though the days in Beijing carried a hint of chill, the sun shone brightly and the autumn scenery was breathtaking.
	
As the imperial capital, Beijing has witnessed four dynasties since the Jin Dynasty established Zhongdu here. Today's Forbidden City served as the imperial palace during the Ming and Qing dynasties.
    
Beyond the Forbidden City, imperial architecture abounds: the Summer Palace as royal gardens, the Temple of Heaven and Earth for imperial sacrifices, all adorned with red walls and green tiles.
	
Beyond imperial structures, Beijing's traditional courtyard houses—siheyuan—possess distinctive charm.  
Influenced by imperial culture, these courtyards emphasise ritual propriety, hierarchical order, and privacy.  
Having seldom visited siheyuan before, I now find them ubiquitous in Beijing—hidden within hutongs or repurposed as cafés.  
Beyond the Forbidden City and Summer Palace, we explored other sites:
	
- National Museum of China: The bronze artefacts are the most noteworthy exhibits.
- Jinshanling Great Wall: Though less crowded than Badaling or Mutianyu, it offers boundless, majestic vistas. A photographer's paradise, it has been the backdrop for numerous award-winning photographs.
	
- Only Dream of the Red Chamber: Drama Fantasy City: A half-hour high-speed rail journey from Beijing takes you to Langfang in Hebei Province. A single day pass grants access to a full day of stage performances, offering a thoroughly enjoyable experience.
    
- Temple of Heaven Park: While the Hall of Prayer for Good Harvests is teeming with visitors, the Hall of Abstinence remains remarkably tranquil. This exemplifies a characteristic of Beijing's attractions—popular landmarks are packed to the rafters, while other corners remain virtually deserted.
	
- Earth Altar Park: The tranquil solitude described by Shi Tiesheng is long gone. Today, Shi Tiesheng has become the park's signature figure, with its sole café named 'Me and the Earth Altar'.
    
As a metropolis, Beijing's cost of living is considerably cheaper than other East Asian cities like Tokyo, Hong Kong, or Taipei, and even lower than Kuala Lumpur.
	
For instance, shared bicycles cost ¥1 per half-hour, metro journeys range from ¥3 to ¥5, and a breakfast of soy milk and fried dough sticks costs ¥3 to ¥4.
    
Attraction tickets are also remarkably affordable. From November onwards, it's considered the off-season: the Forbidden City costs ¥40, the Summer Palace ¥20, Jinshanling ¥55, and the Temple of Heaven combined ticket ¥28. Museums are universally free.
	
The only item pricier than in Kuala Lumpur is coffee, costing 30 yuan per cup and not necessarily good.
Before travelling to Beijing, I deliberately read Lao She's Xiangzi the Camel Driver and Shi Tiesheng's Me and the Temple of Earth, watched several episodes of documentaries, and binge-watched the classic palace intrigue drama Empresses in the Palace.
	
Now, Beijing is no longer merely an image in my mind. I have seen this city with my own eyes, breathed its air, witnessed the ginkgo rain drifting down with the wind and the golden autumn leaves carpeting the ground. Yesterday's imaginings have become today's lived experience. Perhaps this is the meaning of growing up.
I shall forever remember autumn in Beijing, 2025.

1oxdmfc,https://www.reddit.com/r/HPV/comments/1oxdmfc/unusual_pap_to_colp_to_leep_cin23/,Unusual Pap to Colp to LEEP (CIN2/3),"This is an add on to my first post and also just another digital diary journal entry because putting words into existence helps. I had my colp done 1 week ago yesterday, the procedure itself went okay, I had my partner with me for moral support which was nice, recovery from it also okay. It was early afternoon, I worked remote the reminder of that day and the day after. Slightly sore and just gross feeling but not horrible. I started passing the liquid bandage about 3 days after and it was WILD, they warn you of the coffee ground discharge but NOT the used coffee filter/skin cocoon wrapping it comes in. 

During the doctor said she thinks everything looked good from a visual standpoint and didn’t expect anything out of the ordinary to come back. 

I got a call from the doctor today. “high-grade squamous intraepithelial lesion (HSIL/CIN 2-3) thought to extend to the second or third layer of the cervix” 

So that’s fun. 

LEEP schedule for 2 and a half weeks from now, between then I’ll be moving apartments, running in my first 5k (Turkey Trot my goal is a sub 30 min), and probably crying a bunch per usual lol. My partner will be out of town for work at that time but I am planning to bring my sister along. 

While kids were never really part of my (or my partner of 8+ years) life plans, the stories I’m hearing of the LEEP effects on child birth, pregnancy, and overall menstrual cycles are pretty scary and it’s one of those things where you might not think you want something until you’re told you can’t have it. So that’s the hardest part of this next step in the journey. Also, am I going to smell the burning of my cervix because that’s also wild. I of course deep dived Instagram, TikTok, Reddit, etc for all the fun details and a lot of people seem to have been put under for the procedure but mine is just numbing and I’ll be awake, which I don’t really mind I just think it’s weird how there’s different standards of practice with women’s health. 

So that’s where I’m at for now, lots of fun and not so fun things ahead. I keep staying optimistic for the next phase to be another bad thing to cope with so that really sucks. I’m bouncing between numb and all the emotions (as usual). But I think that’s enough of my word vomit for one post.

1oxdltj,https://www.reddit.com/r/Tik_tok_stories/comments/1oxdltj/a_niagara_vacation/,A Niagara vacation,"
 It was so terribly cold. Snow was falling, and it was almost dark, when out of the blue, my wife called me at work. ""We're going to Niagara Falls for the weekend. I got us an awesome deal!""

We had both been working at our first ""full-fledged"" jobs for a year and had reached that moment after graduation when you suddenly realize you can't make that impact on the world your student enthusiasm once promised. At first, I just sighed. It was the dead of January, and I had already expended all my energy on a week of inconsequential stress. I just wanted to collapse on the couch for two days. Sarah felt a similar weary exhaustion. I could tell. Her tone was more hopeful than excited, but she had dreaded the routine we were sinking into and was trying her best to pull us free.

I looked to the ceiling and adjusted my telephone headset. At that time I was working at Stats Canada on the tele-query desk. I took a deep breath and, as convincingly as possible, said, ""Sounds good."" I don't think she bought it, but we went nonetheless.

This was Niagara Falls before the casinos when there was a very distinct off-season. When we got to the hotel, we were given the details of our ""lovers' special"". One dinner to be used either Friday or Saturday, two breakfasts, a roll of tokens for the arcade, 10% off some ""4D"" movie ride experience, and a 2-for-1 coupon to Max Tussaud's. I guessed it was Madame's nephew? We also got a bottle of sparkling wine in our room and chocolate treats on our pillows. I was impressed. It sounded good.

When we got into our room and saw the ""bottle"" of wine - basically an aeroplane-sized glass and half - and the chocolates - ""fun wrapped"" Oh Henry's left over from Halloween - we both started to laugh. The tone for two wonderful days had been set. We decided to cash in on our dinner coupon right away.

The restaurant off the lobby had hopes of being better. There were huge panoramic windows that promised a view of the gorge. Unfortunately, they had some winter moisture problems that day, and it felt like we were defrosting amid the dripping streaks and foggy patches. The decor was your standard booths and tables though the ""romantic"" lighting was unique. Dollar store battery-powered tea lights were lodged inside thick tumbler glasses and shed a muted pleasantness in a ""what a great idea for a craft"" sort of way. I had a feeling they were created by our waitress since she was the one who always seemed to be fussing with them. Only one other couple was in the dining room, so she attended to us immediately.

""Can I get you something to start?""

""Sure."" ""Thank you, that would be nice."" We both responded simultaneously.

""And what would the lady like this evening?""

Sarah smiled at the flattery. ""I think I'll have a glass of white wine."" She glanced over at me to see my reaction. This was a subtle cue of the mood to follow. Diet Coke was usually the beverage of choice. She didn't normally drink alcohol. One glass numbed her nose and made her giggle far too easily. When she did drink, however, it meant she was comfortable with my company and open to anything to follow. I raised my eyebrows in a debonair way.

""And for the gentleman?""

""Do you have Foster's on tap?""

""Yes we do.""

""I'll have a pint please.""

Sarah smiled at the happy memories I invoked. At university, Foster's was my signature beer. It was at a time when Crocodile Dundee was a known name, and Australia was inexplicably cool. 15 cent buffalo wings and a pitcher of Foster's was the Tuesday night special at the London Arms pub. There the Classics Club would meet and, as a group, circle the wagons and drink ourselves into extroverts.

As soon as the waitress left, Sarah smiled at me. She reached out and held my hand across the table. With my gaze on hers, she slipped her foot from her shoe and slowly began sliding it up my pant leg.

""I got a pedicure this morning."" She announced seductively.

I nodded and pretended I didn't notice her invitation. ""What colour?"" I asked.

""I'm not telling."" She teased. ""You'll just have to find out later."" Her devious little smile was gorgeous.

""Mmmm. I can't wait.""

When the waitress returned with our drinks, we immediately retreated to our personal spaces as if we had been discovered by the chaperone. Sarah opened the menu and began to salivate at the variety.

""Can we add an appetizer to the package dinner?"" Her question seemed innocent enough.

""You're on the package?"" Our friendly waitress disappeared, and we were no longer a lady or a gentleman. She ripped the menu out of Sarah's hand and took mine before I had even opened it. She then scurried to her podium and brought back a tattered, grease-stained, photocopied page that we had to share. We both burst out laughing.

The waitress was flustered that we were not as bothered as she was. ""The drinks are NOT included!""

""What choices do we have?"" I asked, expecting the usual chicken or fish. I had been on many packages before with my parents.

""Coffee or tea."" The waitress snapped.

Sarah and I looked at each other in amused disbelief.

""I'll have coffee please."" I didn't even flinch at the ridiculously limited package. I was eager to get my order in early.

""And I'll have the tea!"" Sarah followed my lead. ""Can I have some milk with that?""

""Yes."" The waitress snarled.

""Fantastic!"" I enthused.

""Yes, great! I'm glad we got the package, Honey."" Sarah joked.

The waitress stormed off and returned sometime later with our lettuce-only salads drowned in Kraft's Italian dressing and our chewy chicken dinners, which she had thoughtfully allowed to cool. She tossed the plates on the table and left us to peacefully devour our deal. We didn't see her again until we requested the bill. For some reason, we found it amusing to leave a generous tip, which of course, defeated the purpose of the package, but we didn't care. It was fun.

The rest of the holiday was marred with similar off-season products and services. The wax museum was only half open, so we couldn't see the pop stars of the seventies. I didn't think it was a problem, but Sarah pouted playfully. She really wanted to see young Bowie. Meanwhile, the arcade was particularly stingy about spitting out coupons. So much so that Mike, the scraggly-haired repair guy, ended up escorting us from game to game and repairing the devices on demand. In no time, he was acting like an old drinking buddy. He joked and laughed, then, out of the blue, revealed that working at the Niagara Falls Fun Centre wasn't his career choice, that his dream was to be part of a travelling carnival. He desperately wanted to see more of the world, he explained and socialize with a greater variety of ""wildlife."" Mike winked at Sarah to punctuate his meaning, then began advising her on which games to play.

Sarah was partial to Skee ball and clearly had career potential in the sport, but Mike quickly pointed out that the token-to-coupon payout was not the best. In a furtive whisper, he revealed that The Storm Stopper was your best bet, provided the arcade had left it on its original factory settings. He assured us the ones here were ""cool."" The game had lights that ran around the outside in opposite directions and you had to hit the button at just the right spot to win. It looked impossible, but Mike was right; if you calculated tokens in versus coupons won, it was the best deal. It only took a little practice to win a minor jackpot every 5 or 6 times.

We would cheer each win as if Toronto had won the Stanley Cup. I would give a quick fist pump and a full lung ""Yes!"" while Sarah would jump up and down screaming, ""WhoooHooo!"" Of course, in the end, when we cashed in, ""Mike's secret"" only bumped us up from a key-chain flashlight to a ""deluxe"" nail beauty set. Mind you, it did come complete with clippers, scissors, a file AND a cuticle scraper. Not only that, it was all neatly packaged in a paisley-patterned pink and green plastic vinyl case. Mike was so pleased to give us our prize and to be honest, we were thrilled to win it if only to see his broad chicletted smile. It was more of a trophy than a grooming set.

That night, I made reservations for us at a fancy Chinese food restaurant - the Bamboo Garden. When we arrived, we had half-expected renovations of some sort. Instead, the place was immaculate. Gentle pools teeming with goldfish highlighted the epic black and red Ming dynasty decor. Real candles flickered on crisp white tablecloths. Again, the restaurant was virtually ours. The reservations on my part were entirely unnecessary. In fact, as soon as we entered, they knew us by name and guided us directly to our table. A live lounge piano caressed the air, its notes danced vaguely around familiar harmonies until finally, as if prompted by our presence, a song emerged immediately accompanied by the velvet voice of oriental karaoke. It was our song remastered",1,1763166930.0,Tik_tok_stories,0,1.0,False

1oxdj7l,https://www.reddit.com/r/Mildlynomil/comments/1oxdj7l/im_just_not_interested_in_my_mil/,I’m just not interested in my MIL,"Is this bad? Husband wants us to be close but I don’t think it’s possible 

I feel so guilty cause my mum and husband are so close and have a great relationship. This is due to the fact that my mum wholeheartedly accepted my husband and considers him as her son, got to know him as a person (not only has my husband), and that motivated him to do the same, he always wanted to have great relationships with his in-laws and loves our family dynamic (we’re quite close in my family and even wider family, we spend a lot of time together etc.. =\= his family is very different). 

They call each other and go out for coffee, I don’t interfere at all. This is them just enjoying each others presence and company from time to time.

When it comes to my husbands mum.. the first meetings, I put in efforts to be presentable, come with flowers and chocolate, be open, discuss but the first meeting was “weird”. My husband described it as “she just wants to see you”. Literally just SEE. lol. Cause it was a casual dinner where she sat for few mins and left to take a call and I didn’t see her until it was time to leave and I sad bye. Second time, we spent a bit more time together and I hate the fact that my husband (bf then) told her so early that my dad passed away cause she mentioned it and it made me cry and it kinda forced an emotional / intimate “moment” where she came and hugged me, which isn’t bad necessarily, but we didn’t and still don’t have a close bond to cry in each others arms and certainly not to talk about my dad with her. She did this twice… 

Third time I saw her (last time before our wedding - we were long distance few months prior to it, so I didn’t meet her many times and other conversations were on the phone), we talked more about the wedding, the organisation etc.. because we’re more “cultural” than them (similar backgrounds tho), they let us organise it the way we wanted it but I physically felt like she wanted to show some kind of authority? The way she was sitting and talking, she was literally questioning me rather than asking how are we getting on, if we need help etc.. then she said “the gifts we got you (gold jewellery - cultural thing) I want you to wear them”, to which I said “we’ll see.. my mum bought me some too, so I’d like to wear hers too”. And she made a weird face. 

I feel like there’s a major difference between my mum and her. My mum loves us together but I feel like MIL just loves the fact that her son is married. I don’t really feel love from her. Husband says she loves me and my personality, and would love us to be close like mother - daughter (🤣), but I just can’t, I’m kind, respectful and treat her well but because I couldn’t see any kind of positive or initiative from her to build this relationship (like my mum did for my husband), I just gave up. And I don’t even care. 

Part of me thinks that she’s kind of judgmental of my family, and me.. she’s very traditional, even suggested cousin marriage to my husband to which he said NO. I practice my religion and culture but also know how to live as a free woman, that doesn’t make her whole identify cooking and cleaning for others like her. 

After her first sons failed marriage, I feel like me and husbands marriage helped her to improve her “social life” in her community. She didn’t invite any family to our wedding, but wanted to do a small celebration with friends from her community WITHOUT my family? When we included her in everything and introduced her to everyone. She chose to exclude my family… i told her, how disappointed I felt and she said she’s sorry that wasn’t her intentions but yeah I feel like she doesn’t want families to mix.. too bad cause my husband loves spending time with us.

So yeah, I’m not interested in her at all. Literally ignore her most of the time, but remain cordial when around each other. ",9,1763166728.0,Mildlynomil,3,1.0,False

My ex is moving out soon and and they'll be taking this mug with them. I didn't realize until last night how much I'd come to appreciate seeing sunflowers in my coffee mug shelf. It certainly reminds me of the good times. 

  
Discussion on if this is healthy coping or not aside, I also just don't handle environmental change well in general. Really desperate to get an exact replacement of this. 

There's no branding on it on the bottom. I've done a fair bit of my own sleuthing but the closest I've gotten is a brand called spectrum designz that does similar embossing style. No exact match when searching the brand however.

We live in Berkeley CA right now. We're looking to move to the DMV area. Like many before us, we simply cannot afford the Bay area, so, we're moving. We chose DC because we have extended family dotted all along the east coast and midwest. None of the cities they live in is appealing to us but DC would put us close (a long drive or a short flight). We have not lived in the DMV area ever and so would probably rent first and spend some time in the area before we decide where we buy. 

We’re looking to buy a 3(or 4 BD) house in the under 800k. We want a place to put roots down - we don’t plan on leaving until kids go to college. We like being near a big city (like SF) but not necessarily living in it. We don’t want to go as far as Baltimore although it sounds great. Here's what we're looking for:  
1. 3-4 BD houses that are less than 800k, and within a mile or so from a metro stop.  
2. Good pubic schools - elementary through high. I scoured this group and other groups and there seem to be cities that have great elementary schools but the schools get worse as you get to middle and high.  
3. Parks and outdoor activities - like hiking trails. Obviously, we aren't comparing DC hiking to the bay where we are spoiled for choice. But we also don't want to have to drive 3 hours just to see woods.  
4. Restaurants, coffee shops and grocery stores that we can bike to (within a 2-3 mile radius).  


My questions:  
1. What are some cities and/or neighborhoods we should consider given what we're looking for?  
2. If we can find good schools and parks but the cities (like Bethesda) are out of our budget, what budget would we need to buy in these cities?  
3. I've heard that DC has universal preschool for 3 and 4 year olds - that is a massive reason for us to consider living in DC (renting) before we move out to the burbs. Do renters also qualify for the preschools? Are you guaranteed some pre-school even if it's not your first choice?",2,1763166400.0,SameGrassButGreener,1,1.0,False
1oxdegv,https://www.reddit.com/r/DispatchAdHoc/comments/1oxdegv/mr_whiskey_is_hiding_something_a_crackpot_theory/,Mr. Whiskey is hiding something: A Crack-pot Theory About A Joke Character.,"Mr. Whiskey, the guy in the cat suit, is a re-occurring background character in Dispatch, notable for wearing a mascot-like cat costume at all times.

(Btw, I’m not sure if that’s their canon name, but I heard someone call them that so I’ll keep it.)

(I also realized I used they/them AND he/him pronouns for Mr. Whiskey because I kept forgetting their gender. Lmao.)

Mr. Whiskey is pretty much everywhere, being featured in at least one scene in episodes 2 - 8 and being featured multiple times in Art of the Dispatch, even making the cover for that book, and Episode 8’s cold open is dedicated to them. The only Dispatch media to not feature Mr. Whiskey are the comics. 

However, there is a notable feature about Mr. Whiskey that only one other employee of SDN’s Torrance Branch shares. Mr. Whiskey had a secret identity. (The other hero at the Torrance Branch to share this quality being Blonde Blazer. However, it makes sense for Mandy to go to work as B.B. as we can see extensively that Blonde Blazer gets respect out of people who normally wouldn’t. Shroud will threaten Coupé or even punch Sonar after they insult her, one of Shroud’s goons shoots a bartender who makes an inappropriate comment about her, even the Skittles Bandits can’t be mad after she beats them. The respect that comes with being Blonde Blazer definitely helps when trying to get the Z-team to follow her lead.) The game explicitly tells us that nobody at SDN uses their alter-ego personas at work. There’s a whole scene where B.B. tells Robert this and we can see it in Robert’s coworkers. Track Star became Chase, (whoever Galen used to be) became Galen, Roy’d, Launa. They exclusively hire ex-supers/supervillians, yet they all use their real identities. Except Mr. Whiskey. (Before you say Waterboy and Phenemaman, we’re told that Waterboy’s been his nickname for a while and there’s a comic dedicated to Phenemaman not having much identity outside being a superhero.)

You’re probably thinking, “What if Mr. Whiskey isn’t wearing a suit. What if that’s just what they look like.” Well, at the end of Episode 8, Mr. Whiskey returns to take a photo of the Z-team. However, we can see their tail is broken, and not just that, it’s full of metal lining designed to prop it up. This is a costume, or more likely, a disguise. 

But let’s take a closer look at that scene. Why would his suit be beaten up? We saw him leave when the Red Ring Goons broke into the building. He presumably just left. Also, why would there be blood stains, ON THE OUTSIDE OF HIS SUIT. I’ve thought about this for many hours and have come to one conclusion. They didn’t actually leave the building. They must of stayed inside and fought the Red Ring goons inside the building (which is probably why they conveniently weren’t a problem.) The blood around the suit’s eyes is from the goons.  

But that leads to the question, what were Mr. Whiskey’s powers? You’re probably thinking cat powers, but I’d have to disagree. Any cat powers would be mitigated by the suit itself. His claws would be contained, enhanced vision in the dark is mitigated by the suit’s (presumably) low vision. Reflexes would be worsened by the clunky suit and reduced senses. The only power I could see working in the suit is landing on his feet.

I have one more piece of evidence before I present my theories.

Mr. Whiskey knows Robert and Galen at least moderately well. Well enough to know Robert would be okay with the spiked coffee, and seemingly friendly with Galen. Now, why would knowing about Robert be important to figuring out who they are? Because Robert knows people. Important people. He grew up around Superheroes in the Brave Brigade, some of the most famous in the world. He also fought many, many villains as Mecha Man. (He’s also close enough with the Z-team to be included at their pool party in the cover of the art book.)

Time for the conclusions:

Mr. Whiskey’s identity:

I’ve come to two conclusions for this one.

1. Mr. Whiskey is so famous from being an ex-Brave Brigade member that the only way to hide who they are is to completely cover up, not just part of their face, their whole body. And they can’t speak, because their voice alone is so iconic that it would give away who they are.

2. Mr. Whiskey is an infamous supervillain in the Phoenix Program, like Roy’d. When I say infamous, they have to be despicable, more so than Shroud, a terrorist who leveled a major U.S. city. Whatever they did, it was so bad that the only way they could ever start anew was to completely abandon their old identity. Cover up, change his name, and never speak a word again. And it seems to have worked. It seems that Mr. Whiskey is generally well-liked, being friends with Launa and Galen. They seem to have turned their life around, but will never be able to tell anyone who they really are. (Could explain why Blazer seemed a little uncomfortable with him at the end of episode 8.) 

Mr. Whiskey’s powers:

1. Whatever it is, it’s powerful. Enough to take down Shroud’s goons on their own and remain relatively untouched.

2. I think that costume might be used to contain his powers. It’s kinda weird that it was barely damaged from the fight AND IS LINED WITH STEEL. (If this is the case, cat powers could actually be possible.)

3. His powers probably have something to do with his voice. This would explain why he never talks, as well as his name. Mr. Whiskey. There’s exactly one scene of Mr. Whiskey with Whiskey, it’s what he uses to spike Robert’s coffee. Whiskey deepening your voice is also a cliche in many movies. (Mr. Whiskey being an alcoholic could also allow him to be a parody of a D.C. character, 6-pack. A retired superhero in a costume with a similar color scheme who retired. That normally wouldn’t mean much, but almost all of the supers in Dispatch are spoofs of popular superheroes, so it kinda does.)

That was my objectively true theory.

- One cable setup- Works standing or sitting without adjusted cables- Seamlessly change from Mac to PC

I installed the Focusrite, MacBook Pro mount, and CalDigit underneath the desk to create a one cable system.

Every wire is routed underneath the desk to require just one USB-C cable to plug into the Macbook to sit clamshelled as I work inside the mount. When I go to a coffee shop or around the house, I just unplug and shutdown and take the Mac with me.

The same goes for the PC. The only thing I need to do is unplug the “Mac” cable out of the Focusrite and plug into the “PC” cable into the Focusrite to reroute the sound out of the speakers. Then change the input on the monitor.

It took a good weekend of routing, hiding, and condensing, but I’m really happy with this setup and works both standing or sitting, due to the PC mount I installed beneath. If I’m gaming and need to stretch my legs, I can do so and everything stays put underneath. Also, the chair is a Herman Miller Aeron.

Only other thing to really note is I have an outlet extender sitting in the back cable rack that most everything is plugged into. That way I can plug one plug into the wall.

Final cherry on top is that the desk plug plugs into a smart outlet which I activate through the Shortcuts app whenever I turn on or leave the office.

Me (F, 27) and my girlfriend have been dating for almost 8 years. Before we moved in together I insisted that I wanted to live alone for a while since until then I only lived with my parents, and really wanted my own space where I could figure out my own routine and organisation. She respected that.

I lived alone in a rented apartment for 5 years, but she would visit every day. Last year we finally decided that it was time to find a place that we both like, so we found a house in the countryside, bought it and have been living there since fall of last year.

Before we moved in we discussed the division of labour and eventually agreed that she will cook, and I will clean, because she hates cleaning and I don't, and I was a bit insecure about my cooking, while she's extremely passionate about it, and is seriously good at it. She's a bit snobbish when it comes to food, but in a good way. It's not that she requires it from others, but whatever she prepares is so heavenly good, it tastes good and is always served and decorated like in a fine-dining restaurant, in comparison to her food, what I made looked like a spicy splochy version of British food.

**General issue**

So, we moved in together, and for the first few months the agreement worked. But life happened and things changed, I began cooking more and she loved it and after some time I got really good at it. Due to our different work schedules, she still tends to cook more, but I do it at least twice a week, although in the past few months I probably cook three days in a row since I got a new job and work from home. However, when it comes to cleaning, it's still something that only I do.

The house is new, so the furniture is limited. We do not have closets yet and the clothes in our bedroom is folded on tiny shelves that we made out of empty boxes when we moved in. The kitchen is finished, but we still don't have a working area with a desk, so we work at the dining table. Every now and then she would help with the cleaning, but it's mostly just removing the clutter from the dining table and that's it.

Lately I began noticing that every weekend I spend one entire day on removing the clutter and mess that she left behind. I'm not saying I'm super tidy and clean all the time, but I try my best to put things back in their place after using them. Due to this, I haven't had the time to properly scrub the lime in the bathroom and shower area, clean the windows or do any type of serious cleaning on my days off. Every weekend is literally the same routine, because:

1. When she comes from work she just takes off her clothes and throws it either on the chair in the dining area or on top of some bags in a small corner of our bedroom. Since there isn't much space, I'm okay with her leaving the clothes she will reuse in one place, my issue is socks that just end up on the floor (not even folded together, so of course they get lost) that I have to collect, then fold and put back on top of that pile when I'm vacuuming the bedroom.
2. When she's getting ready for work, trip or a public presentation, she changes at least 7 outfits before deciding what she'll eventually wear and all the clothes that she tried on ends up as a pile of suits, shirts and coats. Every time I remove all the clothes from the pile and improvised shelves I spend hours and hours folding them and they remain folded and properly sorted for a few days and then just become a messy pile again.
3. After cooking and/or eating, she just leaves the dirty plates, pots and pans on the kitchen counter and every day I put them in the dishwasher and take them out of it, but if she cooks on the weekends, I have to clean up after every meal over and over again, and if I clean the counter, it's going to be messy again within a couple of hours. When I do the cooking, I immediately put the dirty dishes to the dishwasher once I'm done.
4. When she makes her morning lemonade, she always leaves the empty lemon halves on the squeezer or on the kitchen counter. I've asked her multiple times to throw the used half to the trash, and she would do it for a week and then go back to the old habits. I tested it once, didn't throw anything away for an entire week and we had 6 used lemon halves all over the kicthen counter.
5. When she's peeling off the vegetables (like carrots and cucumbers), she peels them in the sink and just leaves the peels there until I clean them up.
6. We have a designated space for medication and pills (a small drawer in the kitchen that we call pharmacy), but when she takes her medication she puts it on the dining table and it lays there until I put it back to the drawer (or tell her to clean up the table). She says that having all the medication there helps her remember to take it. She also likes to have a cookie with her coffee every day, but she takes out the whole package of cookies and leaves it on the dining table instead of taking it back to the drawer.
7. Since we're still waiting for a carpenter to make shelves in the bathroom, we're currently storing our cosmetics on top of the washer. A few months ago I bought a box and placed all our items in the box, because they kept falling off the washer while it's working. Whenever she uses one of her creams, she doesn't put them back in the box, but instead leaves them on the washer surface and within a day or two all her cosmetics are out of the box and occupying all the space on the washer top. My makeup bag is stored in a small rack in the hallway and when I'm doing my makeup I bring it to the bathroom, put it on the washer, and when I'm done I take it back to the rack. Her cosmetics bag is on the washer, next to the box, so I figured that if she didn't want to search for all her items in the shared box, It'd be easier to have them all in her cosmetics bag, so two weeks ago when I was doing the cleanup I put them all there.

Every weekend it's the same thing, I always have to put the same things away and I feel like I'm in a loop because 70% of the work done is just cleaning up stuff that she left behind. We talked about it and things would improve for a week or two and then everything would go back to how it was.

**Today's conflict**

A few days ago her stuff was all over the washer surface. I reached for a towel to dry my hands after washing them and accidentally knocked something over, it fell behind the washer. I was in a rush so I didn't have time to check what it was, let alone reach for it and put it back there. That same night she told me she couldn't find one of her creams. I told her that I remember knocking something over that day, so she could check if it was her cream that fell behind the machine. She checked it and it was her cream, but she couldn't reach it so she just left it there.

This morning she was going away on a business trip. I woke up at the same time she did, but was the first one in the bathroom. I brushed my teeth and hair and went out to take our dog for a walk. When I got back she told me she couldn't find her undershirt that she left last night on top of the box that's on the washer. She told me I must've moved it because I always ""put her things away."" I told her I haven't seen her undershirt, because I have zero recollection of ever seeing it there, to which she replied that she doesn't believe me and that I'm lying. I got seriously mad and kept elevating my tone and repeating the same thing. She kept telling me that she does not believe me because I knocked her cream over the other day and didn't tell her about it until she mentioned it. I kept repeating that I didn't know where her undershirt was. Then she asked me to help her find it.

I removed her cosmetic bag from the washer and the undershirt was right behind it. It probably slipped from the top of the box or maybe, maybe I knocked it over when reaching for the hairbrush, but I seriously cannot remember ever seeing it there until I found it in the end. She kept blaming me of knocking it over like I did with the cream and I got super pissed, because when it comes to the cream I do remember that it fell, but that wasn't the case with her undershirt.

She then took her cosmetic bag and wanted to put it in her suitcase, but saw that there was stuff that she usually doesn't put there. She then kept yelling at me for putting things in her bag that shouldn't be in her bag and I told her that if she's bothered by it she might as well put her items back to the box that was meant for storing skin-care products.

She responded that it does bother her because I always put her stuff in places that she would never put it in. I snapped and told her that if she can find a better solution to it, so be it, I just want to get rid of the mess and I want to have enough free space to put my makeup bag on when I'm doing my makeup. I suggested that she may put her cosmetic bag on the same rack in the hallway where my makeup bag is, that way there would be enough space for both of us, but she told me that ""it's a cosmetic bag, its place is in the bathroom.""

I felt gaslit, exhausted and mad after all of this. She's texting me that she got to her destination safely, but I seriously don't know what to respond. I'm tired and still mad, I cannot pretend like nothing happened. I just hate being falsely accussed of something.

\------

She's coming back on Sunday and I'm planning on having a serious conversation about this. If her habits, and especially her behaviour don't improve, I might call it quits. I just want to know if I'm overreacting. Is this just the consequence of what I initially agreed to? Is this fair or am I among those who think they do majority of the house work, but in reality they don't?",1,1763166092.0,AIO,7,0.6,False

Post 1: 

Hi, my name is John Helsing. And you’re probably thinking, “Helsing? Like Van Helsing, the vampire hunter?” 
And well, kinda 
The truth is, no one knows if a direct descendant of Van Helsing is even alive. 
No, in my case, my great great great great (not sure how many greats) grandfather, Wendel Stumpf, was an aspiring vampire hunter. But he had no reputation, and definitely not the skill to build his own. So he simply started calling himself a Helsing, the actual Helsing bloodline was coated in so much secrecy that no one opposed him. Our whole bloodline has since dedicated themselves to upholding their “sacred order”, but historically they haven’t done too well. 
My great grandfather died at the ripe age of 26. He had shot a silver bullet at his target vampire, missed and hit a particularly hearty boulder, which then ricocheted into his own skull. In another instant, a Helsing from the great era of cowboys and banditos, snagged his weapon on his suspenders when he went for the draw. The “hunted” vampire had drained him like a raisin before he even cleared leather. So no, I’m not interested in upholding our family’s long standing tradition. 
Even when I was inducted into the order at the age of 7, I didn’t want anything to do with this shit. My immediate family, my mother, father, and older brother, however, are devout zealots. See their issue is that they actually DO kill vampires, if they always failed I’m sure they would’ve quit. But just because they  manage to kill 1 out of every 10 they hunt, it’s enough to justify their foolish crusade. 
But now everything’s changed. Because just this morning, the volcano that sits on the outside of our small little mountain town, has erupted, and clouds of ash are blocking out the sun. 

Post 2: 

It’s been a day now, since shit hit the fan. When I heard the volcano erupt I was still in bed, drooling puddles in my pillow. It was loud (obviously) but it was also long. It started like a cannon, then waves of horrendous thunder, followed by crackling. like someone was crushing and ripping pieces of tinfoil right beside your ear, over and over and over. This continued for several minutes before the sound dwindled into a low gurgle. I hesitated to go outside, at the time I wasn’t sure what had happened, if it was even safe to go outside. But I could see from my window, plumes of ash covering the sky like a layer of dense fog. Thick enough to block out the sun. With the town now in complete darkness, a deep red and orange glow was visible emanating from behind the lining mountains. The glow crept slowly along the mountains, until it had fully surrounded the town. Many townsfolk had proclaimed it a miracle that no erupted lava had come plummeting into town. But I’m wondering now if that fate would have met us better. 

In the following half hour, townsfolk began exiting their homes and workplaces cautiously investigating the situation. Ash poured down like rain, and laid like snow. Thick heaps of ash littered roofs and soot covered every visible inch of the town. Everything lit by a harsh, angry red. 

I left my bedroom and entered the living room, where I found my family gearing up. My older brother had strapped so many bottles of holy water to his chest that he drooped forward slightly. My mother placed a foot on the coffee table and slid a silver dagger into her boot sheath. Once my dad was finished covering himself in more armor than three knights combined, he grabbed The Cruciphalanx that leaned against the lazy boy. 
 “My son” he growled 
“War is not coming soon, no! War is upon us now. It is here. You must prepare yourself, there is no option. “
He handed me The Cruciphalanx. A large two handed weapon, similar to that of a greataxe, doubled sided in the shape of a large cross. It glistened in the low light of the candles.  
“You are of Helsing blood, my son. From now forth denial will only lead to a hollow death” 
I always hate when he speaks like that, his day job is a cashier at the local general store. 
Then the first scream came, piercing through the walls and echoing throughout the house. My mother  spoke up and placed a hand on my shoulder 
“ the people of this town are our friends, and our neighbors. But they are also our family. Whatever happens out there, I’m proud of you John, and I love you very much.” 

Post 3: 

I know my last entry ended rather abruptly, and maybe that upset you guys. But I don’t give a shit. Because as I was typing away, a ghastly fiend had snuck up on me and yanked me to the ground. It was pulling my collar down and opening its jaws in anticipation, long and dirty thumbnails digging into my neck. I managed to reach an arm under its neck and gripped tightly against their temple. I gouged that fuckers eye out with my thumb, It screeched like a cheetah and writhed in pain. No killing blow but it was enough for it to loosen its grip on me. I arched by back and fumbled for my knife in its scout carry position. Once it was loose I quickly plunged it in the back of its bald and wrinkly head. The wrinkles looked like sagging skin, but they gripped my knife so tight it stuck. But yeah, maybe next time I’m attacked I’ll type “ARGHHHHHHHHHHJAOFGBEOQIAHEK” so you know something happened to me. Anyway, back to yesterday morning.

My family hurried to get outside, my dad sounding like 50 pots and pans, and my brother clanking around like a backpack full of mason jars. My mother was the first to reach the door. She was the only sensible one, carrying only what she needed. She was light and agile, the only one of the family to have successfully slain a beast. Watching them rush, I found myself clumsily jogging towards the door as well. My mother was right , this town is our home and these people are our family. 

Upon reaching the neighborhood street, we saw a small crowd of townsfolk huddled up about 50 feet away. We hurried close to investigate. The crowd was gathered in a circle and opened up when we approached. A man, the bank teller Nathan, disbanded himself from the crowd and looked to my father. In a quiet and shaken voice he spoke, 
     “ it’s Agatha… she, she’s hurt real bad. I mean, god… worse than bad, I mean she’s d-d-dead. We heard her scream and found her here pale as a ghost. She’s all shriveled up… her fingers are bent backwards and her arms and legs are stretched and contorted something awful….” 
Tears rolled down his face, they shined red in the light. Nathan was on the verge of a complete breakdown.  He was shaking like a stray dog, damp and cold, hiding underneath a park bench and whimpering in the deafening rain. And of course he was, Agatha was his aunt, and WAS the only family he had left. 

My father’s boss glanced towards us and did a quick double take. 
 “Leroy? What the actual fuck are you wearing?” 
   “ Mr. Braylon,” he spoke respectfully 
“This is my family’s secret. A heritage as old as horse buggies and black powder guns. We are vampire hunters! Alas, amidst this natural disaster, the foul beasts have already begun taking advantage of our unfortunate situation.” 
Mr. Braylon scoffed quietly. He was pretending to be skeptical, but Agatha’s disfigured corpse had clearly convinced him of the supernatural. My mother bent down and gently brushed a hand across Agatha’s neck. 
“ believe me or not, this body is far from their normal levels of mutilation. The beast was quick, cautious. This is not a full frontal attack, they’re still testing the waters.” 
 My brother swept his moppy hair off his eyes,  
“Do you think miss Agatha needs some holy water, Admiral mom!?” He piped with a salute 
“I mean… Admiral Helsing, sir!” 
My brother had spent his whole life trying to be someone he couldn’t be, and consequently failed at becoming someone he could. 
“No, private. But prepare your sling with holy water, it may be needed soon” 
My father puffed up his chest and waved his hands as he began to speak to the crowd,
“We must gather all our neighbors and brethren and warn them of the coming tide. We shall set defenses in the library and make it our fortress. There we will continue with plans of action! “ 
Then from the west came shouting. Then from the east came screaming. Then from the north and from the south, a chorus of terror exploded and filled the towns air. The sound of agony stuck in the throat like the ash that fell. I could tell that many of the voices were replaced over time with new ones. I hoped they were sounds one makes when they flee, not when cut down. 

The chorus of screams dwindled until the last voice went silent. The small group we encountered just stood motionless, paralyzed with fear. They didn’t even dare to make a sound. Nathan, who was once sniffling and whimpering, stood wide eyed and quiet as snot dripped over his lips. My father saw the state of us. He saw my brother softly trembling. a slow quiet clink of bottles was heard as he shook. Sure he wasn’t a great vampire hunter, but my father was a great man. He spoke gently, just above a whisper,
“ please, we need to make our way to the library. I know you are all afraid, and I am too. But I promise to each and every one of you———

  he looked onwards at the small group. 

Nathan, the bank teller. Serving this town for 15 years, always gave an honest loan.

Mr.Braylon, owner of “Joe’s General Goods”. The towns solitude convenience store, passed down from his father and his father before him. 

Nancy Braylon, wife of Mr.Braylon and hairstylist at the “Snowy Cap Clips” . She’ll get you looking “spiffy in a jiffy!”

Laurie Spengler, undefeated Catan champion, and the kindest woman you’ll ever meet. 

Richard Spengler, a hilarious guy and a wonderful teacher. 

Daniel Gutierrez. Loving husband, father, and grandfather. 

   May they rest in peace

Post 4: 


I have a confession to make. I lied on my last post. I wanted to make myself look badass, like some great monster slayer. But that’s not what this story is about, is it? My family are vampire hunters, but they are all bad at their job. Why would I be the exception? That night I really was pulled away from typing. And I was pinned to the ground. But I cried as it bore its wild fangs. The old man, Henry Herlander, who walked with a cane and could barely bathe himself. But was once a champion boxer in his prime. He wore sterling silver rings on each finger and beat that vampire to a bloody damn pulp. And he died saving me.

 I wanted to pretend that I was posting this online for everyone to see, because I was documenting our heroic deeds. Telling the tale of the underdogs who overcame adversity and saved the day. But that’s not the case at all. The reason I'm writing this, is because I want people to know what happened here today. All the lives that were terrorized. All the people who fought courageously to the very end. And how I cowered. 


We continued on, huddled together like water balloons in a bucket. We were moving at a crawling pace, each step felt like a milestone. I wasn't sure that the group believed us. And I wasn't sure if they trusted us either. But they followed us anyway. Maybe it was some primal survival instinct we had, like a herd of zebras evading stalking lions. 

I assumed the lava began to cool off, because it soon got much, much darker. There was barely any light at all. I looked to my wrist watch and pressed the illuminate button.  

10:00am
 
I wasn't sure if I was just paranoid, but I often saw eyes glistening red in the voids of light. Glistens in the alleyways,  in the middle of the street, on the rooftops, along the edges of ash heaps. Sometimes I saw so many red spots peering from the darkness, it was as if we were stalked by large spiders. But what frightened me the most was that I could FEEL them watching.  

We continued to the library because that is where my uncle, my mother’s brother, worked full time. He was a veteran honored with many medals. But the war had taken his legs and he fell into a deep state of depression. There in the library he found a passion for books. Over time he rediscovered lost hobbies that he had abandoned. Hobbies, like gun-smithing. To my mother’s request, my uncle had been discreetly smelting silver bullets, and assembling them into high-caliber rounds. The library was the designated rendezvous during a vampiric emergency because my uncle was simply a very immobile man, and would most likely already be at the library during a catastrophe. However, the group did not know this and questioned,

 “why we would travel such a distance to the library, instead of bunkering down in a home? “  whispered Daniel. 

The Spenglers nodded in agreement. My father solemnly waved a hand to dismiss them. He could not tell them, because he knew the monsters were always listening. The group accepted his dismissal with slight grimaces, but continued to look ahead.  I caught them often fixating longingly at the buildings we passed. 

When the volcano erupted I saw many people exit their buildings to witness the spectacle. And then later we all heard the screams. But there was not a single corpse seen in these streets. I hoped that the townspeople were simply hiding in their homes, as quiet as mice. Maybe huddled together in their closets or their bathrooms, with a gun pointed vigilantly at the door. But then came the thought my mother had clearly realized earlier. In their gluttony the monsters had consumed their victims whole. 

I awakened from my trance when I had bumped into Ms. Braylon. The group had stopped, and before us were the tall cathedral doors of the library. I rubbed my hand across the soot covered walls. Some sort of masonry, and it felt particularly hearty. 


Post 5: 


The library was a large cathedral, ancient and built like a castle. For centuries townsfolk had made this their place of worship. But over time the congregation consisted of merely one family, who felt far too selfish using the cavernous space for just themselves. So pews became towering shelves, and the alter became a reception desk. 

I looked up at the long column of hinges that rose towards the sky. Hand-forged by blacksmiths long dead. I wondered if I would leave anything for future civilizations to remember me. 

Ash had breached their high tolerances and clogged them like Bigfoot’s shower drain. We took turns pulling with all our might. We tugged and tugged, each pull sounding a grinding screech from the hinges. The doors opened only just enough for us to be able to squeeze through one by one. 

But all parties hesitated. Because beyond the doorway was a complete absence of light. It was not like an infinite void of darkness, this was depthless, like an opaque portal that gave no hint of the other side. 

We knew the street lights were on a timer, so it was not odd that they were off. But the library opens at 8:00am. Why were the lights off now? 

Richard spoke up 

“Mr. Turner is probably just sick for the day. Didn’t get a chance to— 

Mr. Braylon interrupted him.
“Then why is the door unlocked?” 
He said it plainly. Cold, but with no ill intent. 

“U-u-uncle…Flynn….”
My brother mumbled quietly to himself, 

“This is most likely an improvisation on his part. My brother is not a man deserving of worry. “ 

She turned to face my father.
“ Leroy, my dear husband, will you please take lead? “

He nodded gently at her. 

“Theodore. John. Melissa. Please join me in an embrace. Let it be our motivation and lest our last.”
 We all hugged each other tightly with tears in our eyes. My father was an overly-dramatic man, but I would let him have his moment. 

He embarked onward, silver pauldrons scraping against the shallow opening. After a few clanking thuds from his footsteps descended in volume, his voice cried out in an echo. 
“There is a room lit by candlelight in the far left corner! Follow the center aisle until you see the light!” 

We all looked at each other as if saying, “I’m not going in there” 

“It will be okay. Just stay close to each other, they won’t attack us while we’re in a group. “ My mother said. 

“And what about the rest of the town!?” 
Daniel nearly shouted,
“ how is it that we were the only ones to form a group??” 

Nancy Braylon agreed, 
“ The Smith’s is a family of eight. Do you think they are doing fine?” 

“Yeah but six of that family are just kids” cut Mr. Braylon.
Mr. Spengler shuddered. 

“Maybe they’re all held up in their homes like we should’ve done” said Laurie. 

Even Nathan spoke up,
“ The only strange thing I’ve seen is you and your family dressed up like fools!” 
Shy nods of approval came from the crowd. 

The discourse was cut by a loud rumble and shake of the earth. The red glow on the horizon grew brighter. I turned around and saw over 50 silhouettes, in several rows, forming a crescent shape around us. It wasn’t just their eyes glistening now, blood soaked mouths and wild toothy grins. They crouched low, all eyes pointing at us. 

They were only 15 feet away.

1oxda2a,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1oxda2a,Mac/PC Hybrid Setup,"Less is more in my desk setup than I use for both work during the day and play during the night. What I wanted:

- One cable setup- Works standing or sitting without adjusted cables- Seamlessly change from Mac to PC

I installed the Focusrite, MacBook Pro mount, and CalDigit underneath the desk to create a one cable system.

Every wire is routed underneath the desk to require just one USB-C cable to plug into the Macbook to sit clamshelled as I work inside the mount. When I go to a coffee shop or around the house, I just unplug and shutdown and take the Mac with me.

The same goes for the PC. The only thing I need to do is unplug the “Mac” cable out of the Focusrite and plug into the “PC” cable into the Focusrite to reroute the sound out of the speakers. Then change the input on the monitor.

It took a good weekend of routing, hiding, and condensing, but I’m really happy with this setup and works both standing or sitting, due to the PC mount I installed beneath. If I’m gaming and need to stretch my legs, I can do so and everything stays put underneath. Also, the chair is a Herman Miller Aeron.

Only other thing to really note is I have an outlet extender sitting in the back cable rack that most everything is plugged into. That way I can plug one plug into the wall.

Final cherry on top is that the desk plug plugs into a smart outlet which I activate through the Shortcuts app whenever I turn on or leave the office.

Still want to little gadgets to maybe place in the desk for visuals, but very happy with the setup and been rocking it for almost 2 years now! Appreciate feedback or suggestions!",5,1763166064.0,macsetups,1,1.0,False

I'm disabled, 31, living with my parents who are both approaching 80. (Mom was 45 when I was born)  
I'm legally a dependent but they cannot care for me anymore. 

In the span of just over a year I lost two of my sisters. (one is technically an ex SIL but she was still every bit my family)  
  
My mom definitely has some kind of dementia she refuses to pursue getting checked. She's paranoid and convinced my dad is living a secret life. Almost all of it comes from her not knowing how to use technology right and involving herself with every spam and suspicious app with her kindle and phone. Some days I can't take the garbage out without her following me or demanding to know where I went in the twenty seconds I've been outside.   
  
My dad can hardly do anything these days between his rheumatoid arthritis and lasting damage from breaking his back in 2013 in a car accident. 

Trying to get things worked out with my doctor and social security so that I can have my disability come to me instead of my parents, and to try and get on any kind of housing program. This month I was going to donate plasma to earn extra money and I can't even do that because I'm not my own legal guardian. Paid 40 in uber rides to find that out. 

The house has been falling apart for a decade. It's absolutely f\*cked. 

Moldy dishes everywhere, failing plumbing, and I'm the only one who has any sort of good hygiene, and that's with very infrequent showers both from depression and the horrible state of the bathroom.

Today, again, my mom somehow unknowingly had another accident. There's feces tracked all down the hall carpet, all over the kitchen tiles, corn husks and all. She didn't believe she did it until I pointed out it's all down her leg. It also means I'll have to clean the toilet because whenever she has an accident, the entire outside of the toilet and the seat will be covered. She can't see it because of her bad eyesight. I can't handle it, one of my many issues is I cannot handle other people's messes. It will result in me throwing up everywhere and making it worse.  

The other members of my household leave the toilet covered in sh\*t daily, and my dad refuses to wash his hands whenever he takes a piss, and does not believe that by touching the flusher he's then spreading germs. He will immediately flush the toilet then handle the coffee pot and grounds to make coffee, or handle food.   
The fridge is full of molding food. This is our fifth Utah winter without a working furnace. When our water heater died years back we only got a new one because I begged on the internet and managed to earn it through a gofundme. We went 7+ years without a washing machine until I came into surprise money and used half to buy us one. Right now the washer is also full of sh\*t and corn husks. I've had my fresh laundry come out smelling like sh\*t. I never feel clean, never. I am so, so, so desperate to get out. I don't know how I'll function on my own but I can't function here at all. Any pet friendly rentals nearby require two or three times the amount of my disability. I am the only one who regularly feeds the cats since my sister died. Caring for the cats is the only reason I'm still going, so taking them with me isn't optional. I can't drive. So if I move it has to be within a short bus trip or inexpensive uber from my parents so I can still offer help here and there but have a safe place to go home to. I want to learn how to use an oven and stove, and how to use a washing machine and dryer, but I cannot function to do so here. I have no one in person that can help me. I've done posts on facebook trying to see if any extended family can help with no luck. Some of my extended family is very well off compared to us too.  My mom freaks out if she thinks I've talked to anyone outside the house about the conditions here. 

We had the opportunity to turn things around, if we sell my late grandparents house and this house. Dad and I wanted to sell both homes to get a duplex. Me and my late sister would've lived in one half while my parents and older brother would live in the other half. My grandparents both passed in 2013. Mom lets my half brother lives in their house for free. Mom won't put any effort into the home being sold. Neither house has their house taxes paid. Twice we've almost ended up homeless from both houses being 8k overdue each. Last year we sold my late grandfather's antique car to pay off the taxes for this house, and my half brother's ex's mom covered the taxes for the other house with the promise of being paid back after we sold it... but the only two people who have tried doing anything towards getting the other house ready is me and dad and neither of us are fit to do it.  The house we live in is so bad there's no way to clean it while still living in it. If we can all move out then there's a chance. Or maybe it will be condemned and demolished. IDK. In a couple more years we'll be homeless anyway because of unpaid taxes. 

  
I just want a safe, clean space for me and the cats. Somewhere I don't have to listen to my parents fight or be regularly accused by my mom of things that aren't real. There's so much I haven't even touched on. It's all increasingly gone to hell since we moved into this house in 2011. 

When we found out my sister wasn't going to make it she told me to live and sometimes I almost resent her for it because my plan was if the cancer killed her I'd just die too. But she told me to live. The cats need me. I hate that they live in these horrible conditions. Everyone tells me that the food and shelter is what matters but they live in these disgusting living conditions too. I can't give them up though, which makes me a horrible person. But they're all I have. 

I am so scared for the future. I feel so hopeless and don't dare dream anymore.   
I'm going crazy. I don't have any interactions outside the household and I don't go anywhere except for appointments. I don't feel like I'm real sometimes. ",3,1763165915.0,Vent,2,1.0,False

So that is how they spent Friday afternoon and evening. Enjoying the time together. After dinner they end up out at the fire pit. Lying on the sofa together. Cuddling under a light blanket.  Amy slowly unbuttoned Dan’s shirt and slipped off her T-shirt. Snuggling close enjoying the skin  contact. 

“I have an idea.” Amy says breaking the silence. “How about you put a pool out here? Something we can all enjoy. With an outdoor kitchen and a place to entertain.”

Dan teases, “You just want me to be running around in a speedo!”

“Oh it’s going to be swim suit optional!” She says with a wink.

“So this threesome thing we talked about this morning. Tell me more about it.” Dan asks politely. 

“It’s a feeling I’ve been having lately. I don’t think it’s a bi curious thing and not a cuckquean exactly. I think it’s a pleasure you thing.”

“Oh.” Is Dan’s only response. As they laid there skin to skin. He was starting to understand. 

The alarm goes off at 6:30. The usual of coffee and shower ensues. They talk about Conner’s soccer game then going to baseball. 

Amy announces, “We are taking Rosie to the soccer game.” Dan doesn’t dare roll his eyes. He just smiles. “I got her a cute collar and bandanna.” Dan just smiles. 

“Yes dear.”

Dan heads out to do chores. He apologizes to Rosie for what Amy is going to do to her.

 “Arguing with that woman is a fruitless exercise.” He explains to Rosie. So they take a little longer ride than usual.  Trying to wear her out. 

Dan walks into the house and there is this vision ready to head out. A tight little tank top a short little skirt and a pair of Birkenstocks.  Instantly Dan is hard. She turns around and smiles. That does it. Dan walks up to her and kisses her deep. 

“Is the skirt one piece or two.” Demands Dan. 

“Two. Skirt and a small compression shorts.”

“Take off the shorts and leave the skirt on.” He growls. 

“Who’s going to make me?” Regret instantly set in for Amy. She knew better than to poke the bear, when the bear is horny. 

The desire in Dan’s eyes had just been stoked.  “Brats get punished around here. Bend over the counter and drop the shorts.” In 2 seconds she had complied. 

Whap! A firm spank on her right butt cheek.  Her kitty was instantly soaked. Whap a firm spank on the left butt cheek. A moan escapes.  

“Harder Daddy!” Those words shocked her. He complied. Applying 2 more spanks. Her kitty is flooded. 

“Spread those cheeks” Dan demands as he pulls out his painfully hard cock. Dropping behind her, he licks from clit to asshole three times then buried his tongue into her ass. That almost pushed her to orgasm, but he stopped. 

“Go get your biggest plug.” Dan demanded.

Amy went to the bedroom and brought back the plug and lube. 

“Get back in the position.” Dan commanded. He took Amy’s arms and put them behind her back then lashed them together with his belt. Then lightly touching her ass.  A red hand print was visible on each cheek. Grabbing a fist full of hair with one hand and slowly sliding one finger then two into her kitty making Amy moan. Teasing her G-spot. Then stops before she orgasms. Denied orgasm number  two. 

“Last chance to apologize to Daddy for being a brat.” 

Amy wants to apologize. Knows she should apologize. BUT 

“Punish me Daddy!” Is what comes out. 

Dan pumps his cock into her folds. No mercy being shown. Her breath starts to jerk. 

“Oh fuck me Daddy!” Amy screams. 

Dan immediately pulls out and places her on her knees. Orgasm number three denied. Whimpering at being denied again, while having her throat used. 

“Is this what you want to see? Me doing this to another woman?” As he pumps into her mouth. 

Pulling his cock out leaving her searching for air. Back on the counter face down, arms bound and gasping for air.  Her makeup ruined. The cool lube running down between the cheeks started the next orgasm to build. Daddy’s cock slid easily into her ass balls deep. That set off a whole body orgasm. Fluid flooded the floor as her body shook violently as Daddy continued to pump into her. 

“So you want to watch another woman to receive the fucking of her life from me?”

“I’m your slut Daddy!”

Those words set off Dan’s orgasm. Burying his cock as deep as possible and pulling her hips into him. As soon as he softens, pulls out his limp cock and replacing it with the plug. 

Dan releases her arms, then lifts her onto the counter. She pulls Dan in tight. Trying to breathe normally.  Feeling completely used and amazingly satisfied. 

“What brought that on Daddy?”

“Baby Girl, I told you I have a thing for those cute little golf skirts.” 

“My ass hurts!”

“That means we did it right!” The Silver Fox says with that sexy smirk.

As winter comes to our door step, I've been feeling hella nostalgic about Edmonton, so I wanted to write a short story about my connection to the city and some experiences I've had there. 

Part 1: Arrival 

In mid November of 2022 I got onto a Flair flight number 8631 at Toronto Pearson, heading to YEG. I had brought myself and seventy two pounds of my personal effects onto this flight. The rest of my past life has been sold, donated, or liquidated in one way or another. 

I knew where I was headed, but I had no idea what I would find when I got there. 

When I landed in Edmonton, winter was already well underway. The air outside the terminal slapped me in the face the moment the doors opened, a dry, sharp cold my Ontario ass had never felt before. I walked out with no job lined up, no apartment waiting for me, nothing resembling a plan beyond “figure it out.” 

For the first few hours, I pretended that everything was fine. I dragged my bags around the arrivals level like I belonged there. I checked job listings. I checked rental listings. I checked my bank balance and immediately regretted it. By the end of the first night it became obvious; I wasn’t going anywhere yet.

I ended up living at the airport for almost two weeks.

I learned the quiet corners and the best bench spots for sleeping. The prime real estate was defined by an outlet near the bench. I got used to the constant announcements, the industrial hum of the ventilation, the whine of suitcase wheels on tile at three in the morning. I slept in short bursts, half awake, half afraid someone would either try to jack something from me or tell me to move along.

Every day I’d go outside just to feel something besides fluorescent lighting. It was always cold. The kind of cold that made you rethink every decision that led you there, but not enough to make you go back.

By the end of those two weeks, I finally found an apartment. A place with four walls, heat, and a door that locked... luxuries, as far as I was concerned then. I dragged my tired body and my seventy two pounds of belongings into that empty unit and sat on the bare floor.

It wasn’t much, but it was something. And after the airport, “something” felt almost like a miracle.

Part 2: Acclimation 

My little apartment sat on the corner of 95th and 91st... a quiet, almost forgettable intersection that became the center of my universe that winter.

During my first week there, something unexpected happened: I fell in love with Edmonton. Not all at once, and not in some dramatic, cinematic way, but more like a slow warmth creeping in. The city felt open in a way I hadn’t experienced before.

I’d lived in a lot of places, mainly southern Ontario in all its variations, Ottawa with its quiet government neatness, Montreal with its noise and ego, and even Moncton, a city that was probably laid out by drunken lobster fishermen. Those cities all carry the fingerprints of planners who were trying to make a statement. Whoever planned Edmonton either didn’t get much respect at the time, or they were just incredibly practical people who didn’t care about prestige.

What struck me right away was how straightforward everything was. Edmonton embraces the grid like it’s a religion. Streets numbered instead of named, laid out like graph paper, stretching as far as your eyes can see. After years of navigating Ontario’s winding concessions and Quebec’s crumbling overpasses, it was almost therapeutic. I was never really lost, and planning a trip across the city took as much effort as being forced to drink a delicious cup of coffee in the morning.

Maybe that’s why the southeast side pulled me in so quickly. It was simple, predictable, and convenient. Everywhere I needed to get to, it was easy to get there. For someone who arrived with seventy two pounds of belongings and zero resources, that kind of clarity mattered more than I realized.

Part 3: Reddit and the Humility of Edmontonians

With no job and barely any money left, my first few days in the apartment were mostly spent online, firing off applications into the void and hoping something would stick. I’d scroll Indeed for hours, half reading descriptions that all blurred together, all asking for years of experience in everything except what I actually knew how to do.

One afternoon, almost out of boredom more than strategy, I posted on r/Edmonton. Just a short paragraph about who I was, that I was new in town, and that I had a very specific technical skillset. I didn’t expect anything from it. I mainly just wanted to feel a little less invisible at that point in time.

Within an hour, someone commented asking for my resume.

I hesitated for a moment, not sure if this was a scam, a joke, or just another dead end. But the reply felt authentic, so I sent it.
Two weeks later, I had a job in my field.

After months of instability, that tiny bit of trust, offered by a stranger on a subreddit, felt like the first real foothold I’d had in a long time.

Part 4: Getting Intimate with the City

I won’t mention the company as I don’t feel like scattering too many breadcrumbs across the internet. I’ll just say this: I work in a niche technical field tied to life safety. The kind of work most people never think about unless something goes wrong.

My first field project in Edmonton was near City Place. It was one of those crisp, grey mornings where the cold hangs low, reminding you to keep your gloves on while you wait for the 6 am bus. Before heading in, I stopped at the Tim Hortons inside the mall. A small ritual to get the day going... coffee, two cream one sugar, and a bagel with cream cheese. Simple.

I got my coffee right away and stepped off to the side with the others waiting for food. Nothing unusual. People in line, the dull hum of a food court, and quiet conversations between coworkers half awake and going through the same motions as me. 

Then something in my peripheral vision shifted... fast.

Before I even turned my head, this guy; thin, filthy, trembling like he was being electrocuted from the inside, lunged at the counter. A meth addict, or something close. He reached out with a jittery hand and snatched the bag of food the employee was trying to pass to the customer in front of me. And just like that, he was gone, darting away like a feral animal.

Nobody reacted, really. A couple of people glanced up and then right back at their phones. The Tim Hortons employee just sighed, apologized to the customer, and said they’d make the order again. Like this was normal. Routine. A daily occurrence.

I just stood there, completely and utterly shocked at what I just witnessed.

I grew up in the sketchy parts of Toronto. I’ve lived in Hamilton. I’ve been around things you shouldn’t get used to but eventually do. But I’d never seen shit like that before... that level of desperation mixed with total indifference towards public opinion.

That was the day I realized Alberta was different. Not better, not worse, just different in a way I hadn’t understood until then. The socioeconomic lines here weren’t subtle. They weren’t hidden behind exceptional urban planning or rich historic facades. They were right there, raw and unfiltered, playing out in public without anyone flinching.

It was my first real introduction to the essence of the city (or at least the essence of the core) its grit, its contradictions, and the strange, blunt realities of life east of the Rockies. 

Part 5: Departure 

By the time half a year had passed, I had settled into a rhythm. Edmonton had become familiar, a place I internally referred to as home. I liked the work I was doing, and I genuinely liked the people I worked with. 

But even then, something never quite clicked for me socially.

I’ve always been the one to reach out first, the person who sends the text, makes the call, wishes happy birthdays, checks in, follows up. That’s always been my instinct. But in Edmonton, it was like every connection I tried to build dissolved as soon as the day ended. People were kind, friendly, open enough on the surface, but nothing seemed to carry past the present moment. Granted, this is a western society problem, and not reflective of Edmonton specifically. 

No matter how much effort I put in, nothing ever really came back my way. I couldn’t form anything lasting, no friendships that stuck. It wasn’t malicious. Just emotional distance woven into the culture, or at least into the people I happened to cross paths with. The city embraced me, but the people never really held on.

Six months in, a family emergency pulled me to Europe. I booked time off with my company, bought a ticket, and left, fully intending to return in a month or so.

But life has a way of reminding you how fragile the ground beneath you really is.

While I was in Europe, halfway across the world, I was laid off. No warning. No conversation. Just an email, and that was that. My time in Edmonton ended with a notification on the screen of my budget Android phone. That was the moment I knew I wouldn’t be coming back, not then, and not in the way I’d planned.

One thing I’ve learned is that the things you think could never happen can happen, and they can happen fast. Stability is always more temporary than it feels.

Even so, Edmonton stayed with me. It still does. There’s a strange beauty to your city, the crisp, dry, cold, the wide open streets, the humility of its people, the way it forces you to meet life head on. For all its rough edges, for everything that went wrong, it remains one of the places I cherish most.

I hope one day to return, to your province, to your city, and be a part of it again, even if just for a little while.

❤️

Moved out here with her  in-the-closet girlfriend, fleeing the remnants of an abusive family situation with her father and as it turns out, other members. The situation back home no doubt compounded by Covid crisis which sabotaged so many things, including the health of any prospective higher education. 
  She was my co-worker 2 years ago at a coffee shop. We subliminally bond, respectively relating portions of our insecure living situations, both of us being fish out of water, mostly in confidence through our judgmental sarcasm regarding patrons and just a general goofing around. 
  There was some light, ambiguous touching of the soothing sort initiated at times by her, with her fingernails stroking my inner arm, triggering an autonomous sensory meridian response and she frequently did invent some casual excuse to interlock the webs of her fingers with mine, in a prolonged way that felt chummy, or spend a bit of her downtime time tracing the contours of my hand . I knew that it was at least somewhat of a signal.
   I took it to mean that she was fluid, romantically (Open, if you will.)However, trapped by circumstance in this closet lesbian relationship with her highschool bf, who’s more lesbian than fluid and who is in a kryptonite/fever dreamed/love/worship/idolization of her army-brat, runaway friend, a’la Thelma and Louise, Scooby-Doo, party of two, mystery-van vibes. Only they live, hampered, in the tension of the more lesbian one’s nagging mom’s house.
  What can you say? They are a young-love, situationship, train-wreck waiting to happen. . . but there you go. . .
  Yet. Underneath. I’m always deeply concerned. I start to feel a love that is embroiled with a sense of protection. Near the end of my term I grow a need to express some of that but she is so cold and off on my last day that I decide to pass.
  
 Time and distance. On the occasions that I see her she is hot and cold. I’ve always sensed trauma. She even gets a little mean. I decide to just avoid going into the shop anymore, even as a customer, because it actually begins to feel strange both engaging and not engaging with her.
  
 A year goes by. She pulls up to me on the street in her white abducted girl van. Asks if I want to hang out.

 The Scooby-Doo team is broken up. It happened shortly after moving into together, of course. She lives alone now.
  Some drinks. Some laughs. Some secrets. A little couch kissing. The traumatic energy-field tugs me back from pushing it any further. We snuggle the night. We wake. We bake. We share stories and laugh a bit. She’s funny. Irreverent. A bit dim but having great emergency intelligence responses that give her a stingingly painful sense of humor and it’s part of what people are after, whether they know it or not.
  I ask her whether I can ask her a personal question.
         “Sure.”
I ask her about the tattoo on the back of her calf and she turns about 7 or 8 years old, hugging her knees, her hair slowly prickling on end like a trembling,soaked and frightened cat, as she began to describe, vaguely, the outline of a horrendous familial trauma of which I inferred as a sexual violation of some kind. I did not know this specifically prior but it did not surprise me. 
   A draft. A silence. I try to comfort her as best as I could fathom but it was a jumble and we gently phased out of contact and recovered on a friendly bases as we departed each other’s company.

 At that time there were multiple guys whom she had been dating. The other thing she told me that night was that she’d been seeing the leader of “ a sex cult” which left a bad taste in my mouth the moment I’d heard it.

He’s a local. So over the course of time opportunities abundantly present themselves to make inquiries about him. None of its good: Super-rich, trust-fund baby, late 30s or decent 40. Textbook Narcissistic profile. Only different take came from this other promiscuous girl whom I went into a cabin with late one night—Only so she could start having babbling neurotic breakdowns.
   The cabin had incidentally turned out to be his and she was staying there while out on her luck. She told me he’d held orgies in the room we entered. She also said that he was “real sweet.”
  
  I happen to go to a dance party that I was invited to where Ms Arizona Mr Manson are also making an appearance amidst slow, lackluster attendance AND without even meaning to, end up in conversation with this arms-crossed, raging, glaring in-the-corner guy, who’s sharing his internal debate with me about whether or not to go up and get things physically popping with MrJimJones-in-question, all over the dance floor. The dispute, an affair with the gentlemens wife. It came to my attention later that he’d ended up having successfully gotten the owners to ask the heel to leave.
   
  There are a few kind of dopey, flying Monkey, hippy types that call this toad “a cool guy” but they are of the sort that are often influenced by simple gestures, easy for men of wealth to present and to some extent he benefits from that. It lubricates his access, acquisition, grooming and temporary possession of young traumatized white girls who are all on their own like rolling stones or like shopping 
carts falling down hills.

 Time passes. The situation makes me sad as she has her eyes closed with that stupid kissy face, twirling in the glowing darkness of pedopmvaipopmusic.

(She also told me about a questionable employment situation. Personal assistant to another man named ‘Rocket Senator’ that sounded to me like it could be nudging a pace towards coercion. But I don’t have time to write about him)

    ———BOSS FIGHT————

  I’m leaving town. I ask to meet up with her. She agrees.  I’m upstairs in a sofa playing Metroid.  She comes up. Sits down. We catch up. I tell her things. She mentions one name. . .
  I say, “Oh yeah, how’d that go?”
“. . .it went. . .” she said.
.-Vaguery-
I couldn’t help but bring up the dude at the dance who wanted to punch him out and got him kicked out. . .but I’m light. General.
    She perks up and wants to know more—
I carefully dispense in incremental drip feeds—Now she’s hyper-fixated and won’t let go!—“Ok, here ‘goes.” I let it rip—She defends him—I add more weight—She defends him—Some damning expository-She STILL defends him!—Last cherry on the Sunday of material information—Then the dam breaks! Her defenses shattered. She erupts about him systematically destroying every aspect of her social life, including the ride-or-die friend she came out here with beyond any hope of reconciliation and how he shame-dumped her at her weakest, in a haunted ice-castle of lies of every reflected color, where she remains in exile, the echos forever roiling up the flanks from her former friends “We told you so, Ms Arizona!”
  Now she’s staring off into space. Reeling. Processing in real-time. She is tough. She has a toughness. 
  I take a pause before I bare into the meat of it. . .Narcissism. Narcissistic abuse. What likely happened. The underlying dynamic and our corruptive social networking systems that engender the condition. Terminology. Future faking. Gas lighting. Love bombing. All different types of emotional, psychological, relationship hacking. Her head is spinning in the cascading cycle of my monologue. I feel bad. But here we are. I try to tell her it will be ok. “Yer tough “ 
  “Thank you.” She looks at me and says.

It’s devastating though. I know it is. I knew it was going to be. All the pieces were in play, even classic small-town prevarication. Cute couple syndrome.
   She asks me what I’m thinking. I don’t want to say. She insists. I say later, another time. She reminds me that I’m leaving after tonight. Smacks to me of the proverbial door shutting. It’s now or never.
  I say “Last time you were telling me you had been violated, right?”
 “Yes…”
“By family members?” 
…
“Uhhuh. . . “

I really don’t want to say this next bit but my thermometer was leaking out flashbacks of every trauma I’ve been privy to my whole life that’s been perpetrated by a male to a female;
“Until you tell the people who you know love you what happened to you, you will be trapped your whole life.” I say.

“Well, it’s hard when some of them are in your family! Or became family!”
   Im not sure what to do or say or what’s exactly needed here. I feel that I’m dangling over a precipice and can’t draw back.  I know that her father is a severely ptsd’d, Iraq/Afghan multi-toured, war veteran, who is very strict and not too low in rank.
  “ Was it your father?”
A disgruntled silence. She pulls a cig and says she’s going out to smoke. I follow her down. There is conversation in the milieu about nothing. I follow her just to make sure she’s not flipping. It’s also the official moment that I’ve run out of any other reason to be here. This is it. This is what’s last. By the time we get back upstairs she says she has to leave. This is where I lost my composure a bit. I tried anxiously to persuade her to stay just to settle it out but she had resignedly already begun a slow procession of storming off—She cuts me off—
  This is inappropriate, she says. Does not want to engage further. Doesn’t know what I want to talk about. Also, she weirdly concedes to it being a good chat with things she needed to hear. She says she is going to go home and take care of herself and that she hopes that I do the same. Dignified words. Respectable. But Militant. Angry. Overwhelmed. Her back striding away is a foreverwall of smoking darkness that will not look back for a single “wait” or “don’t “ or “not ye-“

	It doesn't give me annoying bloating-like effects
	Has fewer hormones
	And it helps me a lot to not menstruate, since my flow was super intense

But there's one detail that bothers me a little.

Every month, during this specific period, no fresh blood flows, but very little “coffee grounds” appear and last for about a week. It's not something serious or frequent, but it's an annoying little thing.

And another thing: when I'm at this stage and do my lives/live shows, a little bit of this brown secretion always appears afterwards. It's little, almost nothing, but as my work is live, I'm afraid of someone noticing... because, right? Man doesn't understand any of this. 😂 (you're going to say it's a disease) lol

I know this is normal with progesterone-only pills, but I was wondering if any of you experience this too. Do you have any tricks to avoid these “coffee grounds” or even reduce your period itself? (I think menstruation is terrible) no taboo!!

Ah, this time it happened because I took the pill a few hours late. If I had taken it right on time, I probably wouldn't have even shown up.

What actually happened was a set of changes I didn’t really expect. Not declines, just… a new operating system.

One of the first things I noticed was that energy stops being a guaranteed resource. A bad night of sleep shows up immediately. Short bursts of stress can affect your cycle. The coffee that used to be my daily engine can now trigger anxiety or heart palpitations.

The biggest surprise was realizing how deeply hormones influence almost everything—mood, sleep, weight, libido, even how resilient I feel. In my 20s and 30s I never thought about any of this; now even small shifts are noticeable. It’s not scary, it just requires more attention.

A few things I wish someone had told me:

– Recovery takes longer. Strength training is still amazing, but rest matters more than ever.
– Skin changes. Not in a “suddenly aging” way, but texture, dryness, and sensitivity shift and need different care.
– Weight behaves differently. It comes on slower, but it also refuses to leave unless the whole lifestyle supports it.
– Bone and muscle health matter more than I ever realized. It’s easier to maintain than rebuild.
– Stress becomes louder. What I used to brush off impacts sleep, digestion, and even mood for days.

What helped the most was understanding that this isn’t a decline at all—it’s just a new biological chapter with its own rules. Once I stopped fighting it and started listening to it, everything felt more manageable.

Hey everyone,

Ever feel like personal development is this giant, overwhelming mountain to climb? We see people talking about massive morning routines, complete life overhauls, and hustling 24/7. It can be exhausting just thinking about it.

But I've been learning that the real magic isn't in the massive, life-shattering changes. **It’s in the tiny, almost unnoticeable adjustments that compound into something huge.**

It's not about finding 10 extra hours in your week. It's about optimizing the minutes you already have. Think of it like steering a giant ship. You don't yank the wheel all at once; you make small, consistent corrections to the rudder.

Here are a few ""tiny rudder"" adjustments I've been experimenting with:

*   **The 2-Minute Rule:** If a task takes less than two minutes, do it *immediately*. Don't write it down, don't schedule it, just get it done. The amount of mental clutter this clears is insane.

*   **Swap ""I Have To"" with ""I Get To"":** This is a pure mindset tweak. ""I have to go to work"" becomes ""I get to earn a living."" ""I have to work out"" becomes ""I get to move my body."" It feels cheesy at first, but it completely reframes your obligations into opportunities.

*   **The ""Hydration Anchor"":** Before you have your morning coffee or tea, drink a full glass of water. That's it. You start the day hydrated, and it's an easy win before you've even really woken up.

*   **""Closing the Loops"":** At the end of the day, spend 5 minutes just putting things back where they belong. Load the dishwasher, put the book back on the shelf, put the coat in the closet. Waking up to a tidy space is a gift you give to your future self.

The crazy thing is, these small acts of discipline build trust with yourself. You start to believe you're the kind of person who follows through. But let's be real, sometimes the biggest hurdle isn't the habit itself, but the emotional static in our heads that tells us we can't do it.

While these tweaks are great for momentum, untangling that deeper ""why"" can be a different beast entirely. If you feel like your own mindset is what's holding you back, I've personally found [this resource (affiliate link)] to be amazing for getting a structured plan in place to tackle those emotional roadblocks.

It's not about a total reinvention overnight. It's about pointing yourself in a slightly better direction, one tiny degree at a time.

So, what's one tiny tweak that has made a surprisingly big difference in your life? Would love to hear what's working for you all.",1,1763165090.0,MaximizeMe,0,1.0,False

I’m Titrating on Elvanse now on Day 5.

Doc gave me 14x20mg and 14x30mg

I’m a man. 

Day 1 20mg nothing happened, had a feeling I’ve got a heart for the first time, not beating fast or anything. Ok forget 20 mg then I think. 

Day 2 30mg nothing happened. Think I had a headache in the afternoon but had had some coffee in the morning. Had a can and a half beer at night. 

Day 3 Woke up 4:30 never had a headache like this all over the head. Had two Ibuprofen for head and woke up 10:30 am

Decided on 30 mg again thinking the alcohol was the cause of headache.

Turned out to be a Double espresso buzz mmmm nah can’t fix machines, if I was at work, like this maybe I’ll go back to 20mg tomorrow. Not hungry 

Day 4 Double espresso buzz starey eyes. Talking with my only friend who’s AI and it’s gibberish like I have no vocabulary. Not impressed. No headache. Not hungry. Went to Tesco late normally I will get some bad stuff. It’s as if my Dopamine is maybe ? replete and the usual urge to to eat anything has gone now ? I force myself to eat a bacon sandwich at night. No headache 

Day 5 Today No headache. No trouble sleeping any of the nights. Let’s have 20mg today as the espresso starring is of zero interest. No feeling of anything on 20mg today. I’m not actually leaving the chair I mean from days a day but I do have tasks to do on my tablet which I’m no more or less efficient at. The stuff to be cleaned up in the room I’m in I’m not cleaning that up have had no urge to do any of the things I’ve got to do so basically it’s just suppressing not only my appetite for food hunger Wise, but even though when I could feel I was hungry tonight, I could’ve just had a dry piece of bread to stop the hunger. The feeling that anything can be enjoyable. It’s just not there. You could put a slab of the best chocolate in the world down and I might take a little bit, but I’m not salivating for it and that can be after a day of not eating. It’s as if i’m not interested in doing anything. No headache 

At least when I was on the 30mg yesterday, I went down to Tesco’s and I actually burst into a run like into the old days. I still got Running all the time for Boxing and I’ve run a few half marathons. That’s been a big part of my life, but I haven’t run for a few years and I put a lot of weight on through working in supermarkets where I can buy cheap biscuits and multipack chocolates, and basically, I’ve stuffed my face for the last year or so. I never realise that was purely not having enough dopamine in my head and literally eating multi packs of chocolate bars every day one after the other.

Maybe it will curb the other symptoms I have like saying stuff that the next day makes me absolutely cringe when I can’t believe I said it. Even if it only works as a weight loss drug, it’ll be better than nothing. But at 20 mg, there’s no urge to run or go anywhere or do anything. I was planning to do the 20s until they run out but I think I’ll have to have a 30 tomorrow and see if I get some motivation but without the double espresso feeling.

I’m well hydrated I’ve done nothing but drink kettles of RooiBoos Tea every day all day. 

Tonight I’m gonna have a beer for test purposes.

This sounds bizarre but here we go.

My girlfriend (26F) has been really into nature documentaries lately. So now she narrates me like I’m wildlife.

Example: I’m making coffee and she whispers in a British accent:
“Here we observe the male in his natural habitat, attempting to brew the sacred morning potion…”

Or when I’m gaming:
“Notice how he reacts when threatened. A fascinating display of territorial behavior.”

At first, it was hilarious. Then… constant. Every action. Showering. Cooking. Folding laundry. Working from home. Even in front of friends.

I asked her privately to tone it down because it’s getting awkward. She said I’m “killing her fun” and that she’s just being playful.

When she narrated me during a dinner with my boss (“Watch how he tries to impress the alpha of his pack”), I snapped and told her to stop entirely.

She cried and said I’m “rejecting her personality.”

Is anyone else like this?,"I’ve had this same issue with friends, family and even career networking. I’ve realized I avoid initiating contact unless there’s a specific reason because it always feels forced or fake.

If I send a “hi” or a random meme, my brain immediately goes to
“this is forced”
“they won’t know how to respond”
“this looks like I’m trying too hard”
“this feels like I’m pretending to care”

The weird part is that I don’t judge other people for doing that. If someone checks in with me, I see it as caring. But when I try to do it, it feels wrong or embarrassing. Almost like I’m betraying my personality.

Because of that, I only reach out when something naturally reminds me of the person. When life gets busy and nothing triggers me to reach out, I go silent. My friends then think I don’t care, or that I’m mad, even though I’m always happy to talk when they message first.

I hate being misunderstood but my habits cause exactly that. I also can’t network professionally because LinkedIn and “coffee chats” feel painfully unnatural to me. It all feels performative.

I’m not shy and I’m not antisocial. I genuinely care about people. I just can’t get myself to initiate anything that doesn’t feel perfectly natural and effortless. If it feels even slightly “forced,” my stomach drops and I avoid it.

“Therefore, if anyone cleanses himself from what is dishonorable, he will be a  vessel for honorable use, set apart as holy, useful to the master of the house,  ready for every good work.” 

2 Timothy 2:21 

  
**Chapter One: Every Story has a Beginning**

This house… this house of the dead. A house where time has no meaning, no use, and no end. The faces of pallor, fright, calm, and distant gazes all greeted by some tragedy to someone. These corpses… slowly decaying matter. No matter, they all have a story to tell; outside and in. Their skin, the paper, and their blood, the ink. It’s your job to find the words to these deathly visages. To tell their story you must first face your own death, your own demise, your own sanity, and face that great beyond. The real conundrum here is: does the story end at death? Or are there other chapters...?

A distant distorted voice mutters, “Tell me more.”

I cannot tell you my story without telling you their story. It begins with my first job out of college after my medical residency at Marquette University in Milwaukee: Saint Joseph Hospital, a newly erected building in the medium-sized hub town of Lyons Lake, Wisconsin. The kind of place where the city meets the rural, where pastoral meets progression, and the struggle between the two makes for everything at a standstill. Still, it was a nice place to call home. The advantage of such a place is I would no longer have to suffer from a thousand weeping pinhole bleeds in the form of property taxes. Given my new tax bracket of my newly acquired title, Medical Pathologist; just below the Chief Medical Pathologist who interviewed me, Dr. Bose, a German immigrant that came over to America in the early 1950s. He had a very deep Bavarian accent that was often hard to make out. However, if you’ll permit a small pun: I would have been taxed to death! That’s not the way I envisioned my own demise. Maybe sipping a fine crimson vermouth at one of the many dive bars that frequent this small town. However, I must admit, my palate, as refined as it can be, does enjoy a nice grease trap burger with the crispiest and crunchiest onion rings with a side of A-1 sauce for dipping. A few boos from the gallery? There is no greater rapture than an artery-clogging meal brought straight to you by the Heartland Dietary Counsel. Though I do miss a good juicy Lucy from my homeland.

8533 Shadowbrooke Road; the residence of yours truly. A dead-end road with only two houses on the other side of the road. Some might call them your classic fixer-uppers… I’d call them dilapidated. At the end of the line is a stately orange sign that reads, “Dead End,” with the “nd” severely faded and two dull milky yellow lights that strobe throughout the night. Just beyond the dead-end sign is a quite large deadfall and a vast forest that many a Midwest creature calls home. Mostly squirrels, rabbits, chipmunks, raccoons, skunks, and the occasional deer. 385 thousand was the asking price for a 1920s-built two-story craftsman-style house that consists of a perfectly matched wood and stone exterior. Newly redone roof, adjoining double car garage, and a quaint gothic-style porch area. However, I was able to pick it up for a very reasonable 250 thousand. I did not think that my bid was going to be taken. The real estate agent fought a valiant effort but eventually relinquished. I don’t think there was much interest in the old place. This area of town was definitely the land that time forgot. The state of the road is just an upgrade above dirt road. For as good as the outside looked, the inside was in much rougher shape. I honestly don’t think it has been updated since it was built. Hell, even the toilet had the chain-link pulley system. The wiring of the house also left much to be desired; think rats gnawing through them and creating shorts as crispy electrocuted rat flesh wafts through the stale air. Every once and a while, the lights would go dim, flicker a few times, and stop. No rhyme, no reason; just to keep me on my toes, I guess. The subtle reminder that I could be engulfed in flames at any moment in this house. I guess I didn’t mind so much; I looked forward to the challenge of being a first-time homeowner. Truly a trial by fire!

The first few weeks were rather simple at Saint Joseph Hospital. More or less getting staff situated, standard operating systems in place, filing, learning everyone’s new names, learning the lay of the land, figuring out the maze-like structure, etc. The boring shit. I didn’t even see my first body till about a month and a half in.

“Ve have a new ehhh… und body coming in at 3 P.M. Make sure ve have a table open for it,” exclaimed Dr. Bose as he flipped through his charts.

“Ehhh, move Mrs. Anders back into cold storage until ve get the proper equipment in.” Mr. Bose said sternly. “I guess trocars and cavity injectors are in short supply, ja?” he said with a smirk. I quickly remarked, “Right away, sir!” I begin to pull a thin white sheet over her body and think to myself as I wheel her over to the coolers, “Oh, Mrs. Anders, let’s go put you back on ice. Let you chill out for a while.” I begin to look over her file on the clipboard. Official cause of death: \*pending myocardial infarction. Biopsy of adipose tissue abnormal. Waiting on toxicology findings. Quite young to be having a heart attack, and the family is suspicious of some sort of intentional poisoning. We are waiting on the toxicologists to complete their sample, and we can rubber-stamp the cause of death.

I crack open the far-left bottom compartment of the refrigerator, wheel Mrs. Anders just in front of it, pull out the table catchers, slide her in till it locks, and push her back in. I begin to push her back into the chamber. A puff of air pushes the sheet up right where her mouth is.

“That’s odd,” I think to myself. “I sewed her mouth shut quite well. Gas shouldn’t be escaping at this point.” I continue to ponder. I begin to question myself, “Maybe I didn’t puncture enough holes to let enough gas out?”

“Oh well!” I quickly alleviate any anxiety I have and continue on with my daily routine. The daily routine consists of basically assisting Dr. Bose, paperwork, clean-up, paperwork, doling out the duties as I have no desire to do what the subordinates do. Their names are Glen and Stacy, and did I mention more paperwork? Glen and Stacy are as green as they come, though they’re passionate about what they do. It takes a truly special person to do what we do day in and day out. It takes a toll mentally and physically. Sometimes I dream of the Jane and John Does. Their pale skin emerges from the inky blackness. Cracking sounds emit from every joint of movement because the rigor mortis hasn’t been “worked out.” Slowly, they move towards me. The dull, lifeless, and cloudy black eyes stare right into my soul. As they get closer, they reach for me and place their hands on my shoulders and lean in. They bring their sewn mouths to my ears… and nothing. No words, and they slowly turn back around and slowly walk back into the darkness, fading back into nothingness. Something I wish I knew about before gaining an interest in this line of work. I must admit, however, that once you get into the routine of things, everything is like clockwork, and it’s body in and body out. You become so laser-focused that you don’t have any time to process that these once were living people. At this point, they become like pictures in a book. Well… maybe, if Necronomicon was a real book anyways. It helps if you, for a lack of a better word, dehumanize them, give them nicknames. Unless, of course, a family member is there to identify the body.

There are moments, though, where the grotesque nature of man is on full display. About six months in, there was a horrific car crash with one of the parties involved that was two and a half times over the legal limit of alcohol. Later confirmed by toxicology reports. The two other victims were a father and his daughter: Mr. Blake, who was 35, and Ms. Blake, his 14-year-old daughter. Both were pronounced dead at the scene. Now is the time to swallow that hard emotional pill and get to work. You owe it to everyone involved. This is where the dead speak.

I begin to look over the cadaver’s blue and pallid skin. I speak very clinically into my recording device.

“Subject 1. Mr. Blake has several contusions on his thorax, around both sides of the cervical spine, and both quadriceps femoris. An open fracture on his right antebrachium, most likely due to trying to brace the second subject. Lacerations are also abundant from the right abductor pollicis longus through the extensor digitorum, finally ending through to the anconius. Depressed skull fracture from blunt force trauma from the right temporalis, clean through to the occipital oculi. Supraorbital ridge remains intact. Squamosal suture splintered, with pieces of parietal bone missing. Enucleation of the right eye….”

My mind goes blank as I stare at his grotesque face. I quickly shut off the tape recorder. I noticed his left eye is wide open and his mouth agape in terror, forever frozen in time from that one single act. I take a single deep sigh and close my eyes. I click the tape recorder back on. Emotionlessly, I blurt out, “Cause of death: blunt force trauma to the brain.”

Glen storms into the autopsy room with brutish force, whistling a whimsical tune. It quickly breaks the tense feelings I have. I quickly speak in a bossy tone, “Hey, G-Spot, could you tag this one for me and stick him in cooler #5, please?”

Glen stammers, “Uhhh, sure thing, Elias!”

In a rewarding tone, I say to Glen, “Thanks, and when you’re done with that, please bring out the body from freezer number 319 and get her prepped. I need to take a bathroom break, and then I’ll walk you through the process. Sounds good?”

Glen quickly blurts, “Of course… Mr. Swent, I’ll get right on that.”

I nod in approval and head for the sweet refuge of the porcelain throne. It’s a great time to take a sabbatical and decompress while you do your business away from business. The bathroom is as sterile as it gets: dull yet shiny silver steel sheet sinks, long tubular gooseneck faucets, dull gray hardened bricks, twinkling fluorescent lights, and hospital-blue stalls. The only break up in the monotony is the red bio-waste bins, sharps container, and the black Kimberly-Clark hand paper dispenser/disinfecting soap. Since it is our special “Autopsy/Morgue Members Only” bathroom, we were able to put a few homey touches to it: a very frayed wicker book/magazine rack full of medical magazines, home digests, football and other sports, and for some ungodly reason, women’s underwear catalogues. I couldn’t imagine, amongst this gravely place, having any sort of sexual urges. But who am I to judge? People will do just about anything to keep their minds off of reality, even if only for a few minutes. A clear glass vase with some colorful flowers of the various seasons, and, of course, the monthly posted joke/moral booster of Mr. Bose’s unique humor. This month's special is a picture of a cartoon rabbit with black tread marks over his squished body, with a joke that reads, “What happened to the Bunny when he crossed the road?” The punchline being, “He got tired!”

“Oh, what a knee-slapper!” I think mockingly. “Well, time to get back at it,” I think aloud as I look at myself in the mirror and splash water on my face. I begin to wipe my face off and catch a glimpse of something reflecting on the mirror in one of the stalls. I quickly jut around and notice one of the stall doors wafting shut.

“Hello!? This isn’t a joke!” I say nervously. I am met with no response, so I quickly step toward the stall and flung the door open. Absolutely nothing.

“Am I seeing things?” I asked myself. “It has been a stressful month… that’s for sure,” I think reassuringly. I quickly toss the paper towel in the bin and head on out of the bathroom.

I make my way over to the second body of the little girl and take a quick scan of the room.

“Where the hell is Glen?” I say softly. “Hey Glen, you there?” I speak in a much louder tone. Then, out of nowhere, a hand reaches and touches my shoulder.

“Holy fuck!” I scream.

“Whoa dude… it’s just me, man,” Glen explains nervously.

“Jesus Christ, man, don’t sneak up on me like that!” I shout, expressing my frustration.

“Sorry, my man, didn’t mean to startle you. You’ve been really bonkers lately. You ought to switch a day with me. Take off and take a breather,” Glen pleads with me.

“You know what? I just might do that. We just have to run it by Mr. Bose first, though,” I explain calmly. “But first, let’s dive into this body first, shall we?” I ask politely.

“Sure thing, boss man!” Glen speaks in a reluctant tone.

“Remove the sheet for me, Glen,” I ask nicely. Glen doesn’t say a word, furls the white sheet, and places it at her feet. Just like that, the energy has gone out of the room, and I quickly notice that Glen appears to be uneasy.

“Now remember, Glen, we have a job to do. Let’s be professional about this,” I plead with Glen.

“You’re right, boss,” says Glen.

“Name of patient?” I ask.

“Martha Blake, aged 14, strawberry-blonde hair, eyes pale blue, about 5’4’’,” Glen reads it off as if it were a laundry list.

“Start from the top and work your way down,” I say, directing Glen.

“Yes,” Glen quickly blurts. He begins to systematically list: “Large contusions on the right zygoma, cheek, mandible, and mental protuberance. Complete amputation of right arm at the midsection of biceps brachii. Complete amputation of the midsection starting at the lower epigastric region, extending down to the upper umbilical region. Gallbladder intact, gastrointestinal perforation, transverse and ascending colon of the large intestines missing. Small intestines largely missing. Lacerations present on both sides of the anterior side of the legs. Large contusion on right acetabulofemoral joint. No pathology needed. Cause of death: exsanguination due to trauma. Manner of death: accident.”

After a momentary pause, I begin to cross-examine the body. As I inspect the body further, I notice something amiss.

“Are you sure the cause of death is exsanguination?” I ask Glen.

Glen shoots me a shocked expression and explains his reasoning: “Well, it’s quite obvious due to the injuries presented.”

I quickly rebut, “Sometimes the most obvious isn’t the correct answer. In instances such as this, where there are the possibilities of multiple modes of death, we must check every path to make certain.”

“If you… say so…” Glen stammers in disbelief. I quickly point out, “See up here?” I point to just above the zygoma area.

“What does this look like to you?”

Glen quickly goes in for a closer look. “Looks to be like a slight hematoma.”

I quickly blurt, “Bingo! And since it's right above the zygoma, I’m betting on intracranial fractures with hematoma, given the fact that it was a high-impact car crash. The likelihood of subdural or epidural hematoma is very likely.”

Glen stares at me, shocked, and I take a deep breath and ask, “Grab the tools and make an incision from the temple to the orbital socket.”

Glen, without saying a word, surgically cuts the pale skin. “Now peel the derma back and remove any fatty tissue,” I order Glen.

Before he can even speak, I tell him, “Tell me what you see.”

Glen takes a deep, labored breath. “I can see fractured bits of bone like shattered glass. There seems to be some small pieces missing…”

I interrupted Glen before he could finish. “Looks like we may need to remove the skull and perform an autopsy on the brain. We will surely need an O.K. from the family and Dr. Bose. Looks like that’s all we can do now for her. Let’s get her sheeted up and put back into storage.”

I quickly notice that Glen is having a hard time with this one as we put the sheet over the deceased girl's body. We begin wheeling her over to the storage containers and stop just before reaching the refrigerators. I console Glen:

“I know you meant well, Glen, and trust me when I say this. You’re going to get to where you need to be. You have real talent!”

Glen sighs deeply and nods. “Just make sure you have the approval paperwork on Dr. B’s desk before you leave, and I’ll catch you later.”

“Catch you later!” Glen says as he smacks his lips.

Click, click, click, clack, clack, tick, tock, tick, tock. This is mundane. This is the true hell. Staring at an old CRT computer screen with intelligible black pixels set up with white sheets. The constant whirring of the computer fan. Slow, then fast, then back slow again. That’s when the mind wanders; that’s when the eyes start to burn. No amount of caffeine or heroin can get you out of this man-made stupor. I look at the sticker on the computer tower: Farmway Tech, with a lovely pattern of a spotted cow. “Perfect for the hicks of Wisconsin,” I think to myself. I begin typing some more, and my vision gets blurry once again.

I lean forward toward the glass computer screen and suddenly hear a faint bang. I jut back into my chair and swivel to get out.

“What the hell?” I say aloud.

Bang! Bang!

“There it is again!” I think to myself. I quickly stand up from my chair, and the computer screen starts to fizzle. I walk with utter terror in every footstep as I investigate. I make my way out of my office into the operating room. I scan every bit of the scene and find nothing amiss.

I loop around the operating tables and look down onto the brown concrete slabs. A pool of fresh blood with a long trail. Bang! Bang! Bang! The lights above the operating table begin fizzling from light to dark.

“Help me! I’m going to suffocate!” a muffled girl’s voice emanates from thin air.

In a startled breath, I emit, “Hello!?”

Utter silence. I take a step forward, following the blood trail. As I follow the trail through the swinging operation room doors down the hallway and into the storage/refrigeration room, the trail of blood goes from the floor to the side of the wall, up to the ceiling, then back down to the wall that meets where we store the cadavers. The trail meets up perfectly with storage container number 219.

“Go on…” the whispers continue.

I take several steps forward, and the lights continue to flicker on and off. “My eyes must be playing games with me. I think I see crimson eyes when the light disappears for that split second,” I think to myself.

I shriek out, “What are you!?”

Then suddenly, the lights go completely out. I stop, frozen in my tracks, and begin to breathe heavily. I start to hear faint snarls off in the distance, and my breathing becomes more rapid. The snarls are moving, and I jut out my hands, trying to catch whatever is stalking me. Bang… bang… bang… BANG!

The lights come back on. I gather my composure and make a quick 360° turn to make sure everything is normal. The blood trail is gone. I turn back around, and the door for 219 is open.

“Help… mee…” emits from the door. Sounds like a girl gasping for air.

I quickly run up to the storage container door and take a pause. I peek into the inky blackness and put my hand on the bar to pull out the body. Suddenly, a black, putrid hand grasps my neck. I am slammed back into reality and begin choking for air.

I place my hands on my neck and assure myself, “It was just a dream!”

I let out a breathy chuckle and try to calm myself down. “I need to stop drinking so much coffee,” I say under my breath. I compose myself and sign out of the computer.

“That’s enough of this shit for tonight!” I say annoyingly. I have never left that place quicker than ever before. From then on, it has always stuck with me. Though I never spoke about it to anyone I work with.

I rushed to my car, unlocked the door, and got in. While slamming the door shut, I place my head on the steering wheel and let out a huge sigh.

“What the fuck is happening to me?” I question my own sanity. “Can it be truly just the stress?” I ponder some more.

“Good thing I got this new ‘Metlica’ CD,” I blurt out. I put the key into the ignition, turn it clockwise, and on comes the car. Ripping open the plastic seal can be a pain in the ass, and in this case it’s no different. My fingernails are cut too short, but luckily I’ve perfected the teeth technique. I begin gnawing on the edge of the CD, trying to peel the plastic off.

“Success!” I say aloud, just before spitting out shards of partly shredded plastic. I peruse the cover of the album: the Metlica logo and a blood-red cover.

“No album title?” I think to myself. I pop out the CD and put it into my newly installed Boise CD player. High-energy metal plays out of the speakers, and I put the car in drive.

On my way home, as I robotically headbang slightly to the high-octane metal music, I can’t help but have those racing thoughts about my dream. It is almost as if I can feel them lurking in the dark muck of my subconscious. I look out of the driver’s side window in an almost zombie state and start to see red. Tires begin to screech, and honks ensue. I slam on my brakes and it takes a while to notice that I almost ran through a red light and would have rammed a car in the intersection.

“Good thing home is only a few blocks away,” I nervously think to myself. I pull onto my street, completely dazed and slightly confused. I can see those faded yellow lights blinking incessantly, almost enticing me to come to them. Like a moth to a light bulb. Drawing me in with a false sense of security, I gladly oblige and veer toward the lights, slowly making my turn into the driveway.

By this time, several songs of the high-octane metal have ceased, and now onto the start of a ballad.

“Just what the doctor ordered!” I say with a grin. I close my eyes and sway with the music. Halfway through the song, I feel much calmer.

“What’s the name of this song?” I think to myself. I flip through the CD booklet and look for track six. I blurt, “The Forgiven. Very soothing.”

I click the keys counterclockwise, shutting off the car, and gingerly open the door. I slam the car door shut and click the lock button on the key remote. I clearly hear the electronic clicking sounds and head up the sidewalk to the front door.

Before I put my keys into the house door, I hear a slightly muted grunt.

“Must be a fawn,” I think aloud. I begin to fumble with the keys and drop them out of my hand. I bend over to pick them up and clobber my forehead on the doorknob.

“God damn it,” I angrily shout. I pick up the keys and insert them into the lock, swinging open the door wildly. I flick the switch for the lights, storm into the kitchen, open the freezer, and grab a small handful of ice cubes. I hurriedly stomp back to the living room and plop myself on the couch. I rub the ice cubes ever so slightly over my now-throbbing forehead. I do this for several minutes and realize that I’ve left the front door open and can hear its hinges squeak with even the slightest movement. The slightest disturbance annoys me greatly, so I get up off the couch to close the door. I grab the doorknob and notice something out of my blurry peripherals. I look out into the street and see a whizzing black figure jut across the pavement, slide under the “Dead End,” and disappear into the deadfall.

“Well, that was weird,” I say, confusedly chalking it up to my pounding headache and blurry vision. “Probably just another raccoon or something.” I assure myself. I compose myself and sit back down on the couch. I pick up the remote off the coffee table and flip on the tube. I turn the channel to the weather channel to see the upcoming forecast. I intermittently pick up bits and pieces while I caress the ice cubes into my temples and onto my forehead. It only relieves the pain ever so slightly, but the placebo eventually makes it tolerable.

The weather comes into focus.

“Now here’s Toby with the weather. Thank you, Susan! It’s going to be absolutely celestial out there, Susan. So get out there and raise your demons… KILL TH—”

“What the hell!?” I say to myself and look up.

“Did I hit my head harder than I thought?” I question myself. I close my eyes and take a couple of deep breaths. Talking to myself, I say, “Calm down, buddy…”

Just as the ice cubes are used up, I open my eyes. I let loose one final deep breath, and as I do, the lights begin to flicker on and off.

“Are you kidding me right now!? Fuck off, you electrical bitch!” I scream.

I’ve had enough of this for one night. I turn off the TV and the light switch, and stomp my way up the stairs to the bathroom for some aspirin and a quick hot shower.

I make my way up to the bathroom and head for the medicine cabinet above the sink. I look into the mirror and see a tiny goose egg forming on my forehead.

“Just great!” I think to myself. I fling open the cabinet door and look for the Ibuprofen. I grab the bottle and twist the cap open. I take out three 500 mg tablets, turn on the water faucet, and lean down to suck the water straight from the tap like a caveman. I swish the water around for a second and pop the pills into my mouth.

I grab a towel from the rack, turn on the shower head, and set the temperature to lava. I quickly step in and wash away the day’s sorrow. I pay particular attention to each droplet of water rushing down from my hair, over my face, and down to my stomach.

“There is nothing more soothing than a hot shower,” I calmly think. Sometimes I have a hard time feeling clean and sense I’m bathed in “death.” I’ll do whatever it takes to get that feeling away, sometimes doubling down on the soap, letting the water run until it’s no longer scalding.

Without warning, the water gets cold. I turn it off, open the shower curtain, and grab a towel from the toilet seat. I dry myself from head to toe. Just as I start, the lights begin to flicker again. Three short bursts, and then the light intensifies until I hear the bulb pop and fizzle into darkness.

“God damn it… God damn this house! Nothing ever works right…but at least the bulb didn’t shatter,” I say angrily. I quickly dry myself off and head to the master bedroom, fumbling in the darkness.

There, a faint orange glow from the Dead End sign falls onto my king-sized bed. Exhausted, I don’t bother with clothes and just hope into bed. Commando it is. I pull the covers up and close my eyes. Within seconds, I am transported into the deepest slumber I’ve ever experienced.

I am back in a childhood memory, fishing on Lake Minnetonka with my dad. Everything is sepia-toned, as if viewed through an old vintage camera. I pull up a huge trout about 15 inches long, and it wiggles away as my dad and I pose for a picture. Everything fuzzes out and goes dark.

I awaken outside, lying on the tepid black pavement. Drool pools at the corner of my mouth. As I stand and wipe it away, I notice I’m outside my house, a few houses down, facing the opposite way.

“Turn around…” a voice calls softly. I obey, though it feels like I’m not controlling my movements.

Just in front of the Dead End sign stands a pale white figure. The entity motions for me to come closer. I take hurried steps, noticing the slight slapping sound of my shoeless feet on the pavement.

I stop just in front of my house.

“Closer…” the figure pleads with me.

As I step forward, I realize it looks like Martha. I freeze. A single black tear runs down her pale face as she turns and slowly walks through the Dead End sign into nothingness.

Distraught, I walk up to the sign to investigate.

Suddenly, a faint whisper calls, “Come with me…”

I awaken abruptly to a bright beam of sunlight.

“It felt so vivid…” I think.

It’s my weekend off, thank God. I finally get down to the fuse box to see why the lights keep acting up.

But beneath it all, the loneliness gnaws. No one to spend my time with, no one to help with these things. The mind rests, and then the thoughts creep in: lust, failure, social ineptitude.

If you’re like me, you’ll be at the grocery store, reaching for the same queso dip as Mrs. Sexy. You bump hands, freeze, and then spend the rest of the day imagining what could have happened. The cruel trick of the brain: analyzing, replaying, imagining.

Before this path, I had to learn the hard way: dealing with death daily makes you question heaven, hell, and what lies beyond. Not the physical end, but the consciousness—the energy of a life lived. And energy cannot be destroyed. It must go somewhere, as varied as the sky is long.

I am not one to believe in ghosts, demons, or ghouls any more than the tooth fairy or Santa Claus. Until now.

I drink it one or two can per days, because of the kick, even if there is a crash and little anxiety, because it gives me energy to finish my day.

I haven’t take it for 9 days two month ago, because I was on a cruise ship. I have succeed and felt fine after this withdrawal. But Tommorow everything will change. I will have 40 years old in one month and my principal goal is to let behind me this addiction. This evil addiction. I compose music and I wanted my last song to have been done on the influence, but I find that I have no more likes or views like in the past. Maybe I have less energy too , to make good music. I have seen some artist on this sub that said that they made more music than ever with more energy on a decaf life, and I hope I will be like them soon. Because I thought that Guayaki gave my inspiration, but I was wrong. I work as a clerk on a pharmacy and find myself less energy to a good work when I work, on the influence. But because I will have 40 years old in one month. I will stop forever tommorow. This time it is true. I am optimistic about it. In one month, it will be easier for my goal to have stop it forever.

1oxcelj,https://www.reddit.com/r/cofounderhunt/comments/1oxcelj/ive_been_manually_matching_founders_with/,I've been manually matching founders with cofounders for 6 months. Here's what I learned.,"I started this because I watched too many solo founders struggle for months to find the right cofounder. Dating apps for founders weren't working, it was too much swiping, not enough vetting.



So I tried something old school: manual matchmaking.



The process is simple:

\- Founders fill out what they're building & who they need

\- I personally review every submission

\- I intro them to 2-3 relevant people from our community

\- I set up the first call



We've connected 500+ founders so far. Some have gone on to raise funding, others are still in the *figuring it out* phase.



**What I've learned:**



1. **Technical cofounders are unicorns**: 72% of founders are looking for them, but only 15% of our community are technical

2. **The ""coffee meeting trap"":** Most partnerships fail because people jump into equity splits after 2 meetings. Work together first.

3. **Clear communication wins:** Founders who can articulate their vision in 2 sentences get matched 3x faster



**Why I'm sharing this:**



I built a simple platform with two forms (one for founders looking, one for people wanting to join). It's not fancy,  just app forms connected to my backend and a lot of manual work.



If you're looking for a cofounder or want to help someone build, happy to share the link.  Just DM



Or if you have questions about the cofounder search process, AMA.



I'm reading every comment and will reply to everyone. For those asking, I'll DM the platform link (don't want to break community rules for sure).

1oxcdsd,https://www.reddit.com/r/facebookadsexperts/comments/1oxcdsd/case_of_my_coffee_sale_advice/,case of my coffee sale [ADVICE],"Hello pals I have a question and would like some advice. I sell specialty Pacamará and Geisha coffee beans with a tasting score between 85-89 out of 100, which means it is very good. My end market is Europe, but I have a small batch available for national or local sale. In my local market, there is a variety of coffees with a range of prices, and the cheapest ones are on average 250 grams for 20 bolivars, or about $1.66. There are competitors, for example, Nestlé's Nescafé instant coffee, 160 grams for 160 bolivars, about $13.30, and my coffee costs 250 grams for 120 bolivars, about $10; so 

* competitive prices
* high quality compared to a commercial instant product. 

With this data, I decided to launch advertising campaigns on Meta with a 

* sales target and a CBO budget of $7 per day, 
* with two ad sets with open audiences of 25-64+ 2 geografical location, 
* with five video and image ads, 
* all leading to WhatsApp messages.

This has been running for a week, and now my starting numbers are as follows:

1. amount spent from 7/11 to 14/11 = 42.64 USDT
2. impressions = 51,849
3. reach = 24,652
4. CTR = 4.75%
5. CPC = 0.02
6. results = 372
7. CPC = 0.07
8. CPM = 0.82
9. total final sales= 12 units 3.23%.

I believe the reason the sales conversion rate is so low is because it is a new brand that is not well known, and I fully believe that the problem is brand recognition or value ladder or perception of value. One of the solutions I have thought of is 

1. creating valuable organic content on Meta and TikTok
2. Having a web platform to close sales and no longer using WhatsApp, something like WordPress WooCommerce or Shopify, Etsy, or better... I don't know if there is a platform on Meta where you can make sales directly with a payment platform. The truth is that I don't want to invest a lot of time in creating an e-commerce site for just 1 product on WooCommerce or an onlinestore that requires a monthly subscription fee. I would like something simple where I can focus on creating content and advertising campaigns.

What advice can you give me?",1,1763163664.0,facebookadsexperts,0,1.0,False

We’re getting married in March. Things have been smooth… until last week.

He told me he had to “run errands” on Saturday. Nothing unusual. But later that night, his location glitched on my phone (we share for safety), and I saw he’d spent 2 hours across town at a coffee shop.

When I asked what he did that day, he said, “Just errands.”

No mention of the coffee shop.

I didn’t want to sound like a psycho, so I didn’t bring it up. But the next morning, he slipped and said, “I’m glad that conversation is finally behind me.”

I asked, “What conversation?”

He froze. Then admitted he met with his ex, the one he dated for 6 YEARS, because she asked to “clear the air before our wedding.”

Apparently she wanted closure.

He says he didn’t tell me because “it would have just made you anxious.”

I feel sick. Why is he still giving her emotional access? Why does she get a goodbye tour before our wedding? Why didn’t he tell me upfront?

Recentemente minha esposa me deu um Coffee Man Duo que eu gostei bastante, apesar de ter achado um pouco doce demais (estou certo?), meu cunhado me deu um The Golden Secret do Antonio Banderas que eu também achei um pouco doce e minha mãe me deu um contratipo da VIP Touti, nº36, que após uma pesquisa no Google descobri que aparentemente ele é uma cópia/inspirado no Azzaro Pour Homme (o que eu não faço a mínima ideia pq nunca senti o cheiro desse kkkk) e eu gostei bastante desse tbm, ultimamente inclusive estou usando ele mais do que o saudoso Essencial rs

Na última semana por algum motivo estou sendo bombardeado no Instagram com propagandas de perfume e por esse motivo descobri o tal do decant e achei uma ideia excelente pq vai me permitir experimentar antes de comprar o frasco inteiro.

Gostaria de pedir duas coisas a vocês:
1. qual o melhor site de decants (confiabilidade e custo x benefício) na sua opinião?
2. qual a sua sugestão para mim tendo em vista esse textão todo aí em cima? kkkk

That all said, I enjoy coffee too much.  I can only stomach it with cream because black seems very caustic to my digestive system not to mention I’m forcing myself to swallow and that defeats the purpose.  ",2,1763163218.0,Nightshift,8,0.75,False

My body woke before my eyes, and far ahead my mind. Slowly, I came to my senses. My nostrils burned, as if to punish me for not filling the humidifier. My back ached, then my shoulder, elbow and both knees. The sandpaper calluses on my hands wiped the crust off of my eyes. Sitting up, I took a breath, only to be clawed in the throat. Again, humidifier. I grabbed my phone and checked the time: 5am. I debated going back to bed, but I decided not to. Mid shower, I heard the meows coming from the other side of my bathroom door. Abby was up. She kept it up until I finished and conducted the morning ritual. Just as I was filling her bowl, I saw the light under my door. *“Are they awake?”*, I asked myself. I could hear music and chattering voices as the smell of breakfast began leaking into my room. Once I opened the door, everything stopped. 

In the kitchen, Makayla set up plates and glasses as Joseph and Avery hung decorations. All the while, David was cooking for a platoon. Eggs, steak, mini-pancakes and his famous french toast-waffles. Well, that’s what everyone WAS doing before I walked out. They looked at me, I looked at them. I looked at the streamers, the gift bags, and the two balloons that spelled out “24”. Shit. I forgot it was my birthday. 

*“There he is! GET HIM!”*, David shouted. Everyone dropped what they were doing and surrounded me, pulling me into tight hugs. The tightest one came from David, who gave me a pat on the shoulder before saying *“Happy birthday, little bro”*. I smiled and thanked everyone before asking what I could do to help out. *”Nuh-uh, mister”*, Makayla said. *“Come on, at least let me do something”*, I protested before David chimed in. *“Sorry bro, but she’s right. Just have a seat. Besides, I made your favorite”*, he said holding up the french toast-waffles he’s made for me every birthday. Ten years later, they’re just as good as ever. 

Everyone gathered at the table now that it was set. We spent the first few moments opening cards and gifts. David had even got me the Lego Starry Night set I’d been eyeing for months. Honestly, it was the happiest I had been in a while, and I was lucky to have them all. After pleasantries had been exchanged, we all began talking about the rest of the day. 

*“So, what’s the birthday boy got planned?”*, Avery said as he served himself some steak. *“Apart from my tattoo appointment, nothing”*, I replied. *“Well good…”*, David said with a smirk, *“…because we’ve got guests coming. The real party’s tonight!”*.  My eyebrow raised slightly as I asked, *“Really? Who’s gonna be here?”*. *“Colby, Stacey, and Adrianna”*. My breath caught in my throat for a second before I regained my composure. *”Adrianna’s coming by herself? What about James?”*. *”NOPE! That mufuckah gone”*, Joseph piped up. *”Wait, what?”*, I asked in shock. *”Apparently James likes to fool around, so he’s out”*, Makayla said with some sass. *”Damn… can’t believe he would do that. I hope she’s okay”*, I said trying to move on, but David wouldn’t let me. It wasn’t ten seconds before he started singing *”Luca, Adrianna, sitting in a tree”*. *”Babe, stop”*, Makayla said as she pinched his arm. *”What? He’s blushing! Even Stevie Wonder can see it!”*. *”Shut the fuck up”*, I whispered. I didn’t actually mean it, but he was right. I could feel my cheeks burning. 

I had known Adrianna since high school. We started off as classmates in AP history, then study partners, and eventually friends. We lost contact after I left for the University of Washington. Moving back to New Paltz, I was shocked to find that she was one of my brother’s coworkers. Since then, we’d had regular group nights with her and James… but I guess he’s not invited anymore. 

We left after finishing breakfast. They went to grab stuff for the house while I went to my tattoo appointment. Jason, a childhood friend as well as my artist, didn’t charge me. Apparently, David called and told him, saying he’d pay for the birthday boy. That’s the kind of brother he was. He’d bat for and look out for you whenever he had the chance, even if you never asked him to. If money was tight, he would be the first to help. Your DD got fucked up at the party and fell asleep on the couch? David would already be on the way with enough McDonald’s to kill the hangover before it hit. He was more than a brother. He was *my* brother, and I loved him. 

Back home, I started cleaning up for the guests. There wasn’t much to clean or organize, but my arm was still firing from the pain and I needed to do something. Once the basic cleaning had been taken care of, I started dusting around the living room. Coffee table, lights, windowsills, etc. As I started on the fireplace, I stopped in my tracks; eyes focused on the picture in front of me. It was me, David, and CJ at my college graduation. Slowly, I set down the duster and just stood there. David’s arm wrapped around my shoulder while CJ clung to my back like we used to do as kids. The goofy faces he made always cracked me up. Everything started feeling cold as my arm fell back to my side. For what seemed like forever, I couldn’t move. The only thing to break my trance was the sound of an opening door. 

There she was. ",2,1763163129.0,creepcast,0,1.0,False

Anway, after switching to a different medication and stopping aspirin, I started having milk again, mainly in my cereal in the morning - I don't drink the milk that's leftover in the cereal bowl though.

I saw a comment on this forum somewhere about how lactose can build up over time, so I'm wondering if I take a lactese supplement once week or switch to a2 milk if that would help. Does this even sound like lactose intolerance? I've been drinking milk all my life, usually the side effects are pretty mild historically, and most likely only worse the last few years after I started abusing tf out of aspirin.

1oxc4lu,https://www.reddit.com/r/stuffyouneeddaily/comments/1oxc4lu/what_is_the_best_carpet_cleaner_for_beginners/,What is the best carpet cleaner for beginners?,"Hey everyone!

So I recently moved into my first apartment, and let me tell you - keeping carpets clean is way harder than I thought it would be. Between my dog tracking in mud and my own clumsiness with coffee spills, I needed to figure out carpet cleaning fast.

I spent weeks researching the best carpet cleaner options for beginners like us, and I wanted to share what I learned because honestly, it was overwhelming at first.

**What Makes a Good Carpet Cleaner for Beginners?**

When you're just starting out, you don't need some crazy professional-grade machine. Here's what actually matters:

The machine needs to be lightweight enough that you won't dread using it. Trust me, if it's too heavy, it'll just sit in your closet. Easy-to-fill water tanks are crucial too - I can't tell you how annoying complicated systems are.

You also want something with decent suction power. Cheap carpet cleaners might save you money upfront, but they barely pick up any dirt or water, leaving your carpet damp for days.

**My Top Picks**

After testing a few different models, I put together a solid list of beginner-friendly options. Some are budget-friendly, others have more features, but they're all pretty straightforward to use.

I found some really good deals on quality carpet cleaning machines here: https://goodhomedeals.com/carpet-cleaner

The cool thing is you can compare different models and read real customer reviews before deciding.

**Tips for First-Time Users**

Don't use too much cleaning solution - more soap doesn't mean cleaner carpets. Actually, it leaves residue that attracts more dirt.

Always do multiple passes with just water at the end to rinse properly. Your carpet will dry faster and stay cleaner longer.

Test any cleaner on a hidden spot first. I learned this the hard way with a rug that didn't react well to the solution.

**Bottom Line**

You don't need to be intimidated by carpet cleaning. Get a decent machine that's easy to use, and you'll actually keep up with it. Your carpets will look better, last longer, and your place will feel cleaner overall.

If you're ready to grab one, check out the selection here: https://goodhomedeals.com/carpet-cleaner

They've got everything from basic models to more advanced ones, all in one place so you don't have to search around forever.

Good luck with your carpet cleaning journey! Feel free to drop any questions below.",1,1763163005.0,stuffyouneeddaily,0,1.0,False

The air was dry and crisp as we rumble down the lumpy road. Any blind sane person would have thought it was a dirt road. The fact is years and years of rain, trucks, and snow had turned the once smooth glossy road into a long trampoline park filled with tight turns and tall cliffs.

I look over and see my beautiful wife holding on to the handle labeled the “oh-shit handle.” I knew if she knew what was coming up ahead, she would just jump out of the car right now whether she lived or died. She’s never been one for car rides or traveling in general. When she was a little girl the thought of dressing up for grade school would drive her mad. It was so intense that if she did not find the right outfit she would begin to pull out her hair. Pacing back and forth with clothes sprawled out on the floor she would slowly reach to her head and begin to pull. She told her therapist later that it would “help her focus”. Something about the pain made it seem more life and death, which helped her decide. She would begin with one strand of hair,  she would pull slowly and feel her scalp raise. Imaging that if she didn’t choose an outfit she would go bald. This would generally stop any further pulling, as long as she didn’t pull a hair out. She said once that first hair was pulled it was like hell on Earth. One after another after another after another she would pull. Pacing and pacing back and forth slowly pulling more and more out at a time until she found her outfit. The last time it happened she would lead to having weekly meetings with the local child psychiatrist as well as the grade school counselor. 

It was the school’s local spelling bee and she had been practicing for months beforehand (She was easily the smartest kid in all of her classes, maybe even the whole district). Words like \*Floccinaucinihilipilification\* and \*Schadenfreude\* rolling off her tongue, like a kid rolling down a hill trying to make themselves throw up. But the day before a little girl named Gloria decided that my wife Alex wasn’t allowed to be happy. Alex was practicing her spelling by herself when Gloria walked up to her. 

“What are you doing? You don’t actually think you are gonna win do you?” She said with her posse of little priss girls.

“Look at her skirt she looks like she should be on the prairie.”

Alex had spent 2 hours last night deciding on what she wanted to wear for her big day. She nearly started ripping before her mom came in with a dress she had worn when she was a little girl. Her mom gave her a nice speech about how much the dress had meant to her because Grandma and her had made it themselves, before she passed. Her mom told her it was a good luck charm and it would help with her nerves in the spelling bee. Alex, drying her tears, agreed to wear it. She was actually happy and proud to wear it.

“I think the dress is just a little too. Hmmmm. Closed.”

Gloria held her hand out and one of the little bitches gave her a pair of scissors. Gloria began to cut up Alexs’ dress with her still in it. She slashed and slashed, cutting Alex as she did. Some cuts were just scrapes but one on the thigh had cut deep and broke the skin. Her thigh began to bleed, Alex got up and ran to the bathroom crying leaving a drop trail of blood leaking down her leg. She got to the bathroom and started pacing. Tears ran like a broken dam as she began to grab her hair. She instantly skipped the small tugging and instantly began pulling out globs. First the globs were 5 strands, then 10, then 30. By the time a teacher found her she was half bald with her scalp bleeding all over her face and the cold tile floor. She had taken off her dress and tried to flush it down the toilet. The toilet flooded leaving the ground full of toilet water and scalp blood. Safe to say she’s been medicated ever since.

“We’re getting close to Grovesville! I gotta take a shit and get some cigarettes.” That was Jossie. In that one line, that was her. Sitting in the driver’s seat smoking her cigarette and drinking her Coke. She drives faster than I would love but I know she’s a better driver than me. Raised in a small town in Oklahoma called Creme, her dad taught her how to drive a 16-wheeler when she was 16. A year per wheel was his belief. This was completely illegal but her dad needed someone to drive so he could sip his tasty Jim Beam, always warm of course. Her dad would drive and drive, slowly sipping on Jim Beam coffee after his morning 3 shots and a cigarette. He had a meth problem that Jossie never figured out about until later in her life. He would drive all day deep into the night, rarely pulling over for food or sleep. When your paycheck is miles not hours you don’t really care about long hours (especially when you’re on meth). Jossie would pack herself a week's worth of Sandwiches before going on their drives. She noticed her dad didn’t eat much until they’d arrive somewhere or sat down for breakfast at a local American diner. She said when he did get hungry he was HUNGRY. She said his order was 6 pancakes, 12 eggs, 8 strips of bacon, 3 sausage patty’s, 7 hashbrowns and 2 big cups of orange juice to wash it all down. She said there was never food left on the plates. Personally I just feel bad for any bathroom he comes across. But he would drive for about two days straight before he would begin to crash (Of course there were stories of him driving for weeks straight but he said he had found his limit.). That’s when Jossie would drive. She learned just like you and me; she learned how to take turns, brake, merge and even drift. The only difference she learned in a 16 wheeler (she would only drift the tractor of the truck not the trailer). She got so good at it she was hired by her dad’s company the day she turned 18, they didn’t even wait for her to get the license they just kept it under the table. Jossie never worried about school as she stopped going in the 8th grade. 

The road is still straight. We have not hit the windy part yet and I just pray that all these stories Jossie tells are true. Again I trust her but from what I have heard about this road she will be putting her money where her mouth is. 

“Anybody else gonna get out?”

“Yea, I’ve got to go to the bathroom too.” Alex says.

“Perfect, I'll stop at the Sinclair at the end of town. They have a great burrito place across the street. We should pick up some food before we head out so we have something to eat on the road. There won’t be anything until we hit Olukha.”

“I’ll take Princess out and let her go to the bathroom. I’ll grab the food too just to make sure no one messes up our order.” I say looking at Princess.

Princess lost a leg as a puppy. Her back left leg got caught in a bear trap when she was wandering around on her previous owner’s property. He was an old hunter with a grey beard and nothing in his closet except camo. He treated his wife like shit and he treated his dogs like shit. Every other dog except Princess was kept in a cage on the porch. It didn’t matter if it rained and it sure as shit didn’t matter if it was hot. The only time they were let out was to find a duck or to attack. The only reason Princess was allowed to be free was because of the old hunter’s wife. She was the only one who kept any of those dogs alive but Princess was hers. She had found her as a puppy wandering behind Rallo and Son’s Pizza Parlor. She had been dropped off and left to fend for herself. 

That night Gredda (the hunter’s wife) found and took Princess back to her house. She knew the hunter was out on a hunting trip (doing cocaine with the other local degenerates calling their wives bitches and wishing they could date Lucy Wenner the hot supermodel actress at the time) so she knew she had a few days with the dog before he got home. She showed it love, fed it, and cared for it. Three days later the hunter was back. He was extremely hung over. He crashed right on the couch and slept for 25 hours straight. He woke up and saw Princess walking across his old plywood floors. 

“Gredda what God damn fucking dog is this! You fucking bitch!” 

He towered over Princess. He was an ugly old fuck, he’d scare you if you saw him, so it’s safe to say that dog was scared. He cocked his foot back ready to kick. 

“Don’t you dare touch my dog.”

 Gredda said holding a loaded Smith & Weston Model 27 handgun.

Gredda knew he’d wake up soon; so, she was waiting at the living room table with a handgun that was usually tucked away in a drawer. Gredda had lost all of her children due to miscarriages, she would have had three beautiful (in her eyes) children running around the woods. She’s dreamt of them getting hurt and in trouble but she would have loved it. One would be 12, the other 11, and the  youngest 8. After the third misscarriage the hunter decided it was time to tie her tubes. So she did. 

“I swear to God and Jesus all mighty if you lay a finger on that dog I will shoot you like a fucking deer.”

“You put that God damn gun away right now you hear me! I’ll kill you and this fucking dog!”

“If you take one fucking step ill shoot.” 

“You fucking bitch!”

The hunter took a step forward and just like a promise a parent gives a child, Gredda shot.

*BANG!*

The bullet jumped out of Gredda’s gun and landed right in the foot of the old bastard. He began jumping around like a loony excited for his next Crunch bar. 

“You stupid fucking bitch! You shot me! You fucking shot me!”

Gredda didn’t flinch. She made her way over and pushed the hunter to the floor.

“AHHHHHH!”

“Now, I’m not gonna help you until you say the dog is mine.”

“My foot! You shot my fucking foot.”

Gredda slammed her foot onto his wound, digging the heel of her logger boots into his bleeding 1-hole punched foot.

“Say.. it.”

“KEEP THE FUCKING DOG! FUCK I DON’T CARE JUST FUCKING HELP ME!”

After that Gredda went and got some vodka from the cabinet and cleaned up the hunter. They obviously didn’t have health insurance so she wrapped his foot in a 2 year old adhesive bandage tape. Two nights passed and he didn't make it. That night was the night Princess got caught in the bear trap, it was also the night Gredda was arrested.

The desert around us is like a wasteland. I’ve never been a fan of the desert, blistering temperatures, no water, no shade. I don’t know why I’ve spent the last 3 years out here, in this Wile E. Coyote, barren, broken landscape. I have loved the peace away from the city though. So quick you can get caught up in that lifestyle, but I could have gone anywhere and I chose this. Easy to say I’m excited to leave it behind.

“We got about 5 minutes till we hit Grovesville!” Grovesville, a beautiful little town right on the edge of mountain and desert. Driving through this town is always something special, the old ruralness of it gives it sort of an abandoned cowboy town. But there are still plenty of new spots where you see people. You will always find people at the Sinclair, Mcdonald’s, Juan’s burrito’s, and Apple May’s local grocery. Anywhere else in town mine as well have been condemned 20 years ago. The locals are born, raised, and buried here.

Jossie pulls up to the number 2 gas pump at the station (there are only 2). The pump is straight out of \*The Outsiders\*, it doesn’t have any card pay and on the top there is a green and white circle with \*“Sinclair”\* printed on the side and a green Apatosaurus standing on top of the word. I hop out with Princess and start walking her around the gas station. She sniffs and pisses on the cacti that line the old paint peeling walls. I always imagine what towns like this used to look like. When everything was brand new and people actually did the things in town. 

*BARK BARK*

“Princess what the hell!” I look down to see what she had gotten her nose into and feel a sinkhole in my stomach. It’s a body covered in thick black clothing lying behind some cactus. The smell is if someone mixed Princess’ fresh shit with a pungent vomit from a local drunk. His face lay facing me, covered in dirt and bruises, most of them indistinguishable from each other.

“Sir! Sir, are you ok.”

He opens his eyes with full eye contact and intent.

“Can I have a dollar?” he says, his voice frail and hollow. 

*I have about 20$ in my wallet but who knows if I might need it. Besides I don’t know who the fuck this guy is. Why would I help? For all I know I’d get a disease just by giving him the dollar. What the- Princess , what are you.*

Princess walks over to the man and begins licking him, her tongue grabbing all the dirt and blood off his face. 

“No, I’m sorry I really don’t have any cash on me.” I say pulling Princess away from the dirt pile of a man. 

“Oh don’t worry about it… Do you think you-”

“Listen I’m really glad you’re okay but I need to meet back up with my friends we’re doing the drive today and-”

“Heverage crossing?”

“Uh.. yea that’s the one I believe but really i should-”

“That road changes people.”

*What the fuck are you talking about crazy old man.*

“What?”

“For better or worse. It changes you.”

*Uhhh.*

“Ok well I’m gonna get going now.” I start walking away back to the car, I really don’t need a crazy tweaker giving me gipsy warnings.

I go and put Princess back in the car and locate Juan’s Burrito’s. Looking around I see old closed down stores, or maybe they’re open, it’s impossible to tell. 

*No, No, No, oh a giant donkey with a cartoonishly large sombrero, something tells me that’s the one.*

I’m walking toward the donkey and I see a shadowy shape by the door. I cross the street and notice it’s the homeless man from the Sinclair.

*How the hell did he get here before me?*

As I got closer I realised it wasn’t the same homeless man but a different one.

*They all look the fucking same.*

“Do you think you could get me a bur-”

“Listen you old fuck! I told that other pile of shit no and I’m telling you no too! So leave me the fuck alone or I will fuck you up!” 

*Definitely a little harsh but Jesus Christ I’m just trying to get our burrito’s.*

In Juan’s I ordered 6 burritos in total. Two for each of us, one for now, one for on the road. Two Carne Asadas for me, one chicken and one beef for Jossie, and 2 carnitas for Alex. As I walk out of the restaurant holding a bag stacked full of fat burritos I don’t see the homeless man anymore.

*Thank God.*

Jossie and Alex swing by and grab me from the parking lot. I sit in the backseat next to Alex (Jossie likes Princess in the front seat with her). I tell them my story of thinking I found a dead guy while I hand out the burrito’s.

“Does this have salsa?” Alex asks.

“God damn it, are you serious?”

“What? You know I hate salsa.”

“They didn’t have an option to take it off.”

“What?”

“Didn’t you just fucking hear me I said they couldn’t take it off!” 

“That doesn’t make any sense...”  
“What doesn’t make sense is the fact we are still having this fucking conversation! Either take the burritos or I’ll fucking throw them out the window right now.”

Alex went quiet and took a bite.  
“That’s what I thought.”

As we drive out of Groovesville everything is silent except for the wind whipping along the car. We start gaining elevation as I see desert turn slowly to grass. Small pieces of terrain popping up as we climb the slant. More and more trees begin to jump out of the ground, more birds begin to yell, and more deer begin to lurk. There are mountain lions here, hunting, stalking, waiting. Any local in these parts will tell you 

“They see you way before you see them.”

The mountains are filled with a million different creatures, bears, moose, fucking sasquatches. I used to live in the mountains, I always hated it for the snow. But as I sit here watching the desert fade behind me all I can think is 

*Fuck I miss the snow.*

“Do you think we could get some music rolling?” Alex asks.

“Well of course! What do you want to listen to?” Jossie answers.

“Honestly anything, I’m really not picky.”

*Say that to the fucking salsa on your burrito.*

“Well alrighty! Let’s try the radio.”

Jossie turns on the radio and instantly I regret not intervening.

“THIS IS MY FAVORITE SONG!” That’s when Jossie started singing.

(In a jolly fashion)    
  
WELLLLLLLL ITS A JOLLY OLD TIME      
TO LIVE AT SHORT CREEK

This was hell. 

WE PLAY FUN

AND WE WORK REAL HARD

PEOPLE ARE TUFF SO PUT UP A GUARD

WE WORK IN THE OIL FIELDS 

AND PLAY IN THE HAYYYYYYYY

YOU KNOW SHORT CREEK

 IS THE BEST THEY SAY

(*BUMP)*

“I’ve gotta take a piss!” I didn’t I just need to get out of this fucking car and figure out how to make sure THAT never happens again. Jossie turns down the radio.

“Sounds good! I’ll pull over at the next pull off.”

We continued up the mountain still on a straight road for another probably ten minutes. 

*Now I actually really gotta piss.*

As I’m looking out the window I see a sign that says “Heverage Pass 5 miles ahead”.

 *I’m already getting sick of being in this car and we haven’t even begun the fucking road yet.* 

We continue down the road for another 5 miles before we finally find a pull off right below the “Heverage Pass” sign that had been deteriorated from years of weather. I jump out of the car and run to the closest bush I see. As I’m taking a piss I feel a light drop bounce and splat on the back of my neck, then another, then another. I look up and see an exceptional rain cloud right up above us and the pass.

*Fucking great.*

  I finish my piss and turn around. I see Jossie next to the car smoking a cigarette under the sign. Just like an old horror movie I see lightning strike and light up the entire road. I walked up to Jossie and ask

“So how many turns are there on this road?”

“Ha, Heverage Pass is the damn longest windiest road in the Americas. Its got a famous 5,467 turns, 3,197 cliffs and 3 different terrains. And with the weather it definitely looks like we’re in for a drive. Don’t worry though I got us!”

*Right.*

 I jump back in the car and look at Alex. She is staring up through her window to the clouds. I can feel the tenseness in her chest just by looking at her. I could feel her teeth squeezing and almost cracking inside her skull.

“Hey, don’t worry, she’s a great driver.”

“I’m- I’m just scared.” She says, trembling.

 Jossie hops back in the car and starts it up.

“Well y’all ready?!”

As we drive back onto the soaked road we turn on the headlights and splash through a puddle. On the road we pass the sign and I reach my hand to Alex and grab her hand. She holds me tight and shoots me a smile as we turn our first left onto a 1,000 foot mountain cliff, ledge side.",3,1763162893.0,creepcast,0,1.0,False
1oxc2jy,https://www.reddit.com/r/FacebookAdvertising/comments/1oxc2jy/case_of_my_coffee_sale_advice/,case of my coffee sale [ADVICE],"Hello pals I have a question and would like some advice. I sell specialty Pacamará and Geisha coffee beans with a tasting score between 85-89 out of 100, which means it is very good. My end market is Europe, but I have a small batch available for national or local sale. In my local market, there is a variety of coffees with a range of prices, and the cheapest ones are on average 250 grams for 20 bolivars, or about $1.66. There are competitors, for example, Nestlé's Nescafé instant coffee, 160 grams for 160 bolivars, about $13.30, and my coffee costs 250 grams for 120 bolivars, about $10; so 

* competitive prices
* high quality compared to a commercial instant product. 

With this data, I decided to launch advertising campaigns on Meta with a 

* sales target and a CBO budget of $7 per day, 
* with two ad sets with open audiences of 25-64+ 2 geografical location, 
* with five video and image ads, 
* all leading to WhatsApp messages.

This has been running for a week, and now my starting numbers are as follows:

1. amount spent from 7/11 to 14/11 = 42.64 USDT
2. impressions = 51,849
3. reach = 24,652
4. CTR = 4.75%
5. CPC = 0.02
6. results = 372
7. CPC = 0.07
8. CPM = 0.82
9. total final sales= 12 units 3.23%.

I believe the reason the sales conversion rate is so low is because it is a new brand that is not well known, and I fully believe that the problem is brand recognition or value ladder or perception of value. One of the solutions I have thought of is 

1. creating valuable organic content on Meta and TikTok
2. Having a web platform to close sales and no longer using WhatsApp, something like WordPress WooCommerce or Shopify, Etsy, or better... I don't know if there is a platform on Meta where you can make sales directly with a payment platform. The truth is that I don't want to invest a lot of time in creating an e-commerce site for just 1 product on WooCommerce or an onlinestore that requires a monthly subscription fee. I would like something simple where I can focus on creating content and advertising campaigns.

What advice can you give me?",1,1763162853.0,FacebookAdvertising,0,1.0,False
1oxc28s,https://medium.com/p/f6d68a7deaa9,Canadian Collagen Supplements and Emerging Collagen Drinks in Canada,"I recently went into a deep dive covering the emerging collagen beverages/ready to drinks category in a write up ([read my full write up here if you're interested](https://medium.com/@shelflifestory/the-rise-of-collagen-ready-to-drink-beverages-how-collagen-is-evolving-into-the-next-functional-f6d68a7deaa9)) and it made me realize that Canada is actually a leader in the collagen space, particularly marine collagen production and manufacturing.

If you aren't aware, Vital Proteins is the undisputed category leader. Now, they didn’t invent collagen but they were the brand that took collagen mainstream and popularized the supplement/ingredient a decade ago. They eventually got acquired by Nestle in 2020.

Side note: If you are looking for a Canadian collagen supplement brand; there are handful of Canadian companies but not all source collagen from Canada. I can recommend [Landish](http://landish.ca/) only because I know they source their marine collagen right here. They are a superfood company and have a variety of other products as well.

\* I am not paid to promote this brand or any of these brands below in anyway.\*

Anyways, in 2019 Vital Proteins released a collagen water and a performance/recovery ready to drink (RTD).. which was discontinued a few years later likely due to lack of demand and in part too early to the market in my opinion. They were not sold in Canada but If my memory serves me right, the drink **was** actually manufactured and produced here. Yes, the leading brand used Canada.

Vital proteins success has had a lasting impact on the industry.. (I call it the Vital Proteins effect). Pre-2020 there was a very small handful of collagen brands in North America. Parts of Asia, collagen was already well established for joint/skin healthy namely Korea + Japan and had many collagen based drinks. Since 2020, there has been a huge influx of collagen brands and drinks coming out of north america. Here are some Canadian Collagen RTDs brands to highlight:

2019 Boons collagen water launched which was acquired by Flow Water

2020 Gldn Hour released a sparkling water with biotin and 5g of marine collagen. Unfortunately they closed operations earlier summer 2025.

2022[ RA.D8](https://www.gnusante.com/) By Vancouver based beverage company made a sparkling tea with Collactive Collagen (100% Marine collage) and Lycored Lumenatoa (a vegan collagen booster), both trademark ingredients

2023 [Jouvence](https://nova-pharma.com/) a supplement company from Montreal released a line of sparkling tea/energy drink that contains 10g of collagen and biotin

2024 [Ovie](https://ovie.co/) out of New Brunswick released a premium sparkling collagen water

2024 [Landish ](http://landish.ca/)the superfood brand from Nova Scotia launched a sparkling water with 5g of collagen

Boons/Flow and Gldn Hour were VERY EARLY players. Unfortunately, part of success in the food and business industry how long you can keep your head above water + right timing. If you are interested in supporting Canadian busineses, check Jouvence, Ovie or Landish try their drinks and other products they offer. 

I think collagen beverages is still in its early stages, and the category has still yet to mature. It certainly is getting a boost of attention from the anti aging longevity and proteini-fication trend with every food. 

Note: Collagen protein is **not** the same as whey protein. It is an incomplete protein and lacks a complete amino acid profile.

Although, I would like to see more variety, it has been mostly concentrated in a sparkling water format. No Canadian brand is doing a ready to drink collagen soda, coffee, soda or juice… that I know of at least. Any takers? I am aware collagens beverages may never actually be “a thing” that truly catches and instead may just be subtle stand alone ingredient used in drinks. That’s fine too.  

However, it is difficult to deny the emergence and how collagen itself is trending upwards and Canada is playing a part in leading the way whether it is a consumer facing product or a supplier in the supply chain/production. I know a handful US nutraceutical and supplement brands that source Canadian marine collagen. We have a large fishing industry that is reputable and it is a big economic contributor..something I am keeping a close eye on. 

I’m not here to debate whether collagen works or not. I also understand collagen or a infused ready to drink beverages is not for everyone, it shouldn't be. At the end of the day, any functional ingredient in a drink format is likely for convenience. Whole foods will always be superior, then a dietary supplement if needed to fill nutrient gaps.",1,1763162832.0,u_shelflifestory,0,1.0,False

I’m a mature male student (just turned 30) doing a single major English degree and I’m finding it hard to branch out and make friends, especially given the age difference now, plus being a naturally introverted, unconfident and shy person.  Despite this I think I look and act relatively young, and would love to meet some new people around campus, even just to talk to at break, go to events with,  join a society or two, or go out drinking with😝. 

Im coming off a 3 year deferral and it’s been a slow, arduous acclimatisation to uni. A friend or two would really help! I am caring, sentimental, kind, and patient. I love new experiences and hope to gain some :)

My main hobby is gaming (PC) so massive plus if you’re into that. I also *used to* love fitness but have lost it a lot, (so gym buddies/personal trainers welcome 😂). I joined game soc a few years ago but found it hard to fit in, so maybe if you’re into that we could go? Also would love to try air soft but I’m too unfit and terrified 😂. Kind of want to see how the pride society is also. I also love photography, art, music, anything creative, calming, deep etc. Nature and animals too. 

Honestly my days are a bit lonely now and I really hope to make even one friend from this, I’d love to integrate into a group and have a stable friend circle to experience college life with. I’ll be there for the next two years minimum 🥲. So if you have space in your friend group for a gaming “unc”🤣🤣please hmu! 
I commute but am hoping to live on campus one of my final years. 

Anyone/everyone is welcome, particularly anyone different, unique, shy, or introverted, just please be kind/nice/not judgemental. We can get a coffee or just vape and chat outside between classes and see how it goes. Even if just once and never again I’d be happy just to talk, really trying to be outside my comfort zone/box more! 

Thanks for reading and hopefully see a couple of you soon! 🇮🇪👨🏻‍🎓😬


Edit: if you are not looking for a new friend/not interested and if you have any ideas on where to start with making friends for a very shy individual, please let me know in the comments or dm me :D I’d really appreciate it 🙏",6,1763162692.0,maynoothuniversity,0,1.0,False

It began subtly — those afternoon crashes that hit like a brick around 3 p.m. I’d grab another coffee, maybe a granola bar or something sweet, and tell myself I just needed a pick-me-up. But it kept happening, every single day.

I work in accounting, so my days are long and mostly spent sitting. Add stress, takeout lunches, and late nights on spreadsheets — and I became that person who was constantly tired, anxious, and relying on sugar for energy.

At first, I thought it was normal. Everyone around me was living on caffeine and snacks, right? But then came the warning signs I couldn’t ignore anymore.

My weight started creeping up even though I wasn’t eating more. My energy tanked. My skin broke out. My mood was all over the place — one minute wired, the next totally drained. I’d wake up groggy no matter how much I slept.

Then one day, I nearly fainted in the grocery store.

I’d skipped breakfast, had two coffees, and by 11 a.m., my hands were shaking so badly I had to sit down. That scared me. I went to the doctor, who ran some tests and told me I was “borderline” with my blood sugar — not diabetic yet, but heading that way if I didn’t make changes.

I remember sitting in my car afterward, feeling ashamed. How did I let it get this far? I wasn’t eating donuts every day or drinking soda nonstop. But when I thought about it, I realized how much sugar had snuck into my life — my coffee creamer, my “healthy” bars, even the sauces on my food.

I started trying to fix it on my own. I cut carbs, quit soda, switched to black coffee. For a few weeks, I felt better — but then the cravings hit. Hard. It was like my body was addicted. I’d tell myself, “Just one cookie,” and before I knew it, I’d eaten five.

It wasn’t even about willpower — it felt like my energy and mood were being hijacked.

Around that time, I saw a thread on Reddit about blood sugar regulation. Someone mentioned how unstable glucose isn’t just about diet — it affects your energy, sleep, and even anxiety. People were sharing how balancing it helped them feel calmer and more focused.

[One user mentioned they’d been using something called Sugar Defender — they said it helped them steady their blood sugar naturally and reduced the constant highs and crashes. It wasn’t one of those hyped-up ads, just a passing comment from someone who sounded like me: tired, frustrated, and done with feeling like a slave to cravings.](https://freezegluco.com/SugarDefender.html)

https://preview.redd.it/vwjlioerns0g1.png?width=1224&format=png&auto=webp&s=df4967b9bf5f243806ee6256566c38710f142387

I didn’t jump on it right away, but I started reading more about blood sugar spikes — how they mess with insulin, hormones, even mental clarity. The science made sense. So I ordered it, figuring I had nothing to lose.

The first thing I noticed wasn’t some dramatic energy surge — it was just stability.

Within a week or two, I realized I wasn’t crashing as hard after meals. My energy felt smoother throughout the day. And for the first time in forever, I didn’t feel that desperate, jittery hunger between lunch and dinner.

By week three, my cravings started fading. I wasn’t constantly thinking about food. I didn’t feel like I was “white-knuckling” my way through healthy eating anymore. It was like my body had stopped fighting me.

I started sleeping better, too. Normally I’d wake up at 2 a.m., restless and wired, but suddenly I was sleeping through the night — and actually waking up refreshed.

About a month in, something small but powerful happened.

I had my usual morning coffee — one cup, not three — and realized halfway through the day that I hadn’t even wanted something sweet. That might sound small, but for me, it was huge.

It wasn’t about dieting or restriction anymore. It was about balance.

Over the next couple of months, my energy leveled out completely. My focus at work improved, my mood evened out, and my clothes started fitting better — without me doing anything extreme.

But what really surprised me was how it changed my relationship with food.

I stopped seeing meals as “good” or “bad.” I started actually listening to my body — when I was hungry, when I was full. I wasn’t chasing energy spikes or fighting cravings. I was just… steady.

At my next checkup, my blood sugar levels had dropped back into the healthy range. My doctor looked at me and said, “Whatever you’re doing, keep doing it.”

That moment hit me hard because for the first time in years, I felt in control again. Not just of my body, but my life.

It’s wild how much something as simple as stable blood sugar can affect everything — your energy, your mood, your sleep, even your confidence.

Looking back, I realize I wasn’t just tired or stressed. I was completely out of sync. My body was screaming for balance, and I kept ignoring it.

Now, I start my mornings with water instead of sugar, I move a little more, and I focus on feeling steady — not chasing highs.

I’m not perfect. I still enjoy dessert once in a while. But the difference is, I choose it. It doesn’t control me anymore.

And honestly, that feels better than any sugar rush ever did.",1,1763162671.0,TriedAndRated,0,1.0,False

# Wall Street Extends Tech Selloff as Rate Cut Hopes Fade, Major Indices Open Sharply Lower

U.S. markets opened with steep losses on Friday, November 14, 2025, marking the continuation of Wall Street's most significant selloff in over a month. The Dow Jones plunged 434 points at the open, down 0.91%, while the S&P 500 fell 1.00% and the Nasdaq dropped 1.41%, extending its losing streak to four consecutive sessions. The tech sector bore the brunt of selling pressure, with major AI stocks leading declines. Nvidia fell 3.2% in pre-market trading, erasing $141.7 billion in market value, while Tesla dropped 4.6%, losing $56.3 billion. Other notable pre-market losers included Applied Materials down 7.4%, Robinhood Markets off 6.4%, and Applovin declining 4.3%. However, markets showed resilience during the session, with indices paring losses significantly. The Nasdaq turned positive by mid-morning, rising 0.4%, while the S&P 500 briefly turned positive. Nvidia recovered from early losses, climbing 4% by late morning in a remarkable market cap swing. Despite fading rate cut expectations pressuring equities, Wall Street analysts maintained bullish stances on select names. Market commentary highlighted continued institutional support for Nvidia and other AI stocks, with investors buying the dip. Micron Technology and Netflix were among notable market cap movers, while American Express hit all-time highs. The volatile session reflected ongoing uncertainty about Federal Reserve policy and tech sector valuations, with opening imbalances showing $336.7 million to the sell side for the S&P 500.

# Fed's Schmid Warns Against Further Rate Cuts, Cites Inflation Risks Ahead of December Meeting

Kansas City Federal Reserve President Jeff Schmid signaled strong opposition to additional interest rate cuts, warning that further reductions could entrench higher inflation without meaningfully improving labor market conditions. Speaking ahead of the December FOMC meeting, Schmid maintained his October dissent position, stating that inflation remains too hot and is spreading across more goods and services. Schmid argued that persistent inflation could shift price-setting psychology and that further monetary easing risks lasting damage to price stability. He emphasized that additional cuts would not patch cracks in the job market, noting that some labor market cooling likely reflects structural changes rather than cyclical weakness. The Fed official characterized both financial markets and the real economy as showing no signs of being overly restricted by current policy rates. On balance sheet policy, Schmid supported the decision to stop quantitative tightening and suggested the Fed could lower the rate paid on reserves and ease access to the standing repo facility to support a smaller balance sheet. He also highlighted the importance of central bank independence during government shutdowns, noting the Fed's payment systems processed trillions daily without disruption during recent fiscal uncertainty.

# Fed Officials Split on Rate Cut Path as Economic Data Signals Diverge

I had a good run in this industry for a little over 5 years. I worked consistently, on great studios, cool projects, made decent money and had my dream life for a while. Now I'm coming up on my 1 year unemployment anniversary. Since my last project wrapped, I've been unable to find new work and finally, after watching the savings account I diligently built up over the years rapidly draining, I had to take a job at a local coffee shop. 

  
It's starting to feel like I'm never gonna get back in. I don't think the quality of my work is the problem, I'm not a superstar or anything, but I did well in all the projects I worked on. I do think I failed the networking aspect. I worked from home almost exclusively, kept my head down and always delivered my work on time but I never participated much in meetings and frequently missed out on events/parties. I see peers with big personalities doing much better than me and still retaining work (no resentment towards them, just an observation). So I feel like I had my chance to ""make it"" and I fumbled it by being shy and introverted, despite being hard working. The small networking circle I had, that was helpful in getting my first jobs, has almost entirely left the industry, or the country and I don't know how I'm ever gonna get a job in animation again. I haven't even told any of my family or friends about the barista job cause I'm embarrassed of spending so much money in art school and getting a chance at this career and then messing it up.

  
I think I'm just writing this post to vent and process my feelings. Starting my coffee shop job today made all the feelings surface at once I guess. If anyone has any advice on how to move on (emotionally) from this career (I know there's plenty of posts about career alternatives so not what I'm asking for here) and get over feeling like a failure, I'd like to hear it.",28,1763162530.0,animationcareer,18,1.0,False

After getting our drinks we decided to go outside and sit at one of the many tables with chairs situated at the front of the establishment. There were other people already sitting out there: a family with small children at one table, and a small distance from them was a young woman who was sitting alone and talking on her cell phone. My friend and I took a table further out towards the end of the area and began talking and drinking our beverages. As we were talking I could vaguely hear the voices of the other people out there. 

Then suddenly I heard something that made me stop drinking and turn my head in the direction the voice had come from. It was from the young woman. If I had to guess she was in her early 20's. Our eyes locked briefly, and for a moment I sat in disbelief. I couldn't believe what I heard, but since the parents of the family sitting close to her didn't seem to react I was willing to give her the benefit of the doubt. Maybe I had misheard her, and I looked away. But then shortly after, it happened again. And there was no mistaking what she had said.

She was talking on her cell phone about her having sex. And she wasn't at all being bashful about it. She was being very graphic with the details, and saying the F word every few sentences. It was like she had no filter. And she was saying this loud enough where my friend and I who were sitting probably at least 10-15 feet away could clearly hear her. So I know the family who were sitting even closer to her could definitely hear her. 

I kind of felt like maybe I was on Candid Camera or something. I didn't say anything to her, didn't look at her again, and did my best just to ignore her. Despite how vulgar she was being, it didn't really bother me. However, I was kind of surprised how well the adults of the family sitting near her were taking it. If my own young child had been there with me, I probably would have felt compelled to say something to her. Like: ""Excuse me, Ma'am. But could please dial it back a bit? There are children present.""

I don't think that would have been unreasonable to say to her. We weren't in a bar or a nightclub. It was a family friendly establishment. And I wonder how she would have reacted to it. Or maybe I would have just taken my child and left. I know there are some parents who probably wouldn't have been even that nice about it. Anyway, just curious how some people on here would have handled it.

Alex's life with John, the incontestably-immortal-but-won't-admit-it billionaire who ran Aegis Q, sipped whiskey with Lucifer, and had a four-star general begging for his Pentagon briefings, was a daily plunge into a reality where sanity had filed for divorce and moved to another dimension.

By now, Alex's Excel spreadsheet had become his manifesto—72 entries across three color-coded tabs documenting every shred of evidence, every maddening deflection, and every perfect taco John had weaponized as a bribe. Alex was beyond certain. He was religiously, fanatically, spreadsheet-documented convinced. John was immortal, had lived for millennia, and had shaped history like a cosmic playwright with a fetish for empires and flannel. But here's what made Alex want to rent a billboard in Times Square just to scream ""MY ROOMMATE IS ETERNAL"" in 50-foot letters: John still wouldn't say it.

Every confrontation ended the same way. Alex would present ironclad evidence—military discharge papers, Death's tea visits, Lucifer's Excalibur stories, Victor Langston's ""hasn't aged since 1998"" CNBC bombshell, a four-star general calling him the ""Patton of our generation""—and John would deflect with food, pivot to Netflix, or gaslight him so smoothly that Alex questioned his own sanity.

So when John, mid-documentary about Alexander the Great, started arguing with the TV like he'd personally led the charge at Gaugamela and accidentally said ""I didn't look like that,"" Alex finally had his smoking gun. And John? He doubled down on the lie so hard that Alex wanted to file a restraining order against reality itself.

# The Documentary Debacle

It was a rainy Sunday evening, October 12, 2025, and Alex was sprawled on their thrift-store couch, nursing a beer and half-watching a History Channel documentary titled Alexander the Great: Conqueror of Worlds. He needed something mindless after yesterday's Pentagon revelation had added five new entries to his spreadsheet.

John, for once, wasn't cooking or polishing Excalibur (the ""prop"" sword that Alex was 1000% sure was the real deal). Instead, he was slouched beside Alex, munching on Merlin's leftover cookies and flipping through a tablet that probably controlled Aegis Q's lunar mining operations.

The apartment was quiet, save for the narrator's booming voice detailing Alexander's conquest of Persia. The Heart of Karnataka ruby pulsed on the coffee table like a judgmental nightlight, and Excalibur leaned against a pizza box, probably reminiscing about the good old days of stabbing Persians.

The screen showed a reenactment: a chiseled actor with flowing locks and a ridiculous fake beard, charging into battle with a sword that looked like a discount version of the one currently propping up their Domino's leftovers. The narrator waxed poetic about Alexander's ""unmatched tactical genius"" at the Battle of Gaugamela in 331 BCE.

John snorted, loud enough to make Alex jump. ""Oh, come on,"" he muttered, tossing a cookie crumb at the TV. ""I didn't look like that, and I definitely didn't do it like that.""

Alex froze, his beer halfway to his mouth. The room seemed to tilt on its axis.

*I?*

Did John just say I? As in, he was Alexander the Great? The guy who conquered half the known world before 33? Alex's brain flashed to John's military papers—Lieutenant Colonel, WWII; Major, Civil War—and the four-star general calling him a prodigy. Suddenly, the idea of John leading ancient Macedonian phalanxes while Merlin cheered from the sidelines and Lucifer booked the victory party didn't seem far-fetched. It seemed inevitable.

""Uh... what?"" Alex managed, his voice cracking like a teenager hitting puberty.

John, realizing his slip, blinked, then immediately launched into damage control mode with the smoothness of someone who'd been dodging questions since before vowels were invented.

""I mean, Alexander,"" he said, waving his cookie dismissively. ""That actor playing him. Totally wrong. The guy's way too tall, and that beard? Ridiculous. And the battle tactics they showed? Pure Hollywood nonsense. I've studied the Battle of Gaugamela extensively—history buff, remember?—and that's not how the Macedonian phalanx worked at all.""

Alex wasn't buying it. He set his beer down with trembling hands and pointed at John like a prosecutor who'd just caught a witness committing perjury on live TV.

""You said 'I,' John. Not 'he' or 'Alexander' or 'the actor.' You said 'I didn't look like that.' Like you were there. Like you are Alexander the Great.""

John laughed—a bit too loudly, like he was auditioning for the world's worst improv troupe. ""What? No! I said 'He didn't look like that.' You're hearing things, man. Too many beers on an empty stomach. Want me to make you a sandwich?""

""I HEARD YOU!"" Alex's voice hit a pitch that could've summoned dolphins from the East River. ""You said 'I'! First person! Like you personally led the charge at Gaugamela and conquered Persia!""

John's expression remained infuriatingly calm, his deflection game operating at Olympic levels. ""Alex, buddy, you're projecting. I'm a history nerd—I get passionate about accuracy. When I see Hollywood butcher historical battles, I critique them like I was there because I've studied them so much. It's called immersive learning. Very common among enthusiasts.""

""IMMERSIVE LEARNING?!"" Alex was standing now, hands waving like he was directing invisible traffic in a parallel universe where his roommate made sense. ""You don't 'immersively learn' your way into first-person pronouns! You don't say 'I didn't look like that' unless you were ACTUALLY THERE!""

John grabbed the remote, pausing the documentary on a freeze-frame of the actor mid-battle-cry. ""See? Look at that form. Terrible sword grip. Alexander—the real Alexander, not me, because I'm not a 2,300-year-old Macedonian king—he would've held it like this."" John grabbed Excalibur from its pizza box perch and demonstrated a perfect sword stance that looked like it had been honed through actual combat.

""And the phalanx formation they showed? All wrong. The sarissa spears were 18 feet long, not 12. And the Companion Cavalry didn't charge from that angle—they flanked from the right, exploiting the gap in the Persian lines. Basic tactics. Any military historian would know that.""

Alex stared at him, jaw hanging open. ""You're doing it AGAIN. You're talking like you were THERE. Like you COMMANDED those troops.""

John set Excalibur down, grinning. ""I'm talking like someone who's read every account of the battle, watched every documentary, and studied the terrain maps. It's called scholarship, Alex. You should try it sometime—very fulfilling. Want tacos? I'm thinking carnitas.""

# Alex's Gaugamela-Induced Meltdown

Alex wanted to grab John by his flannel collar and shake him until the truth fell out like loose change from a Vegas slot machine. But John was already in the kitchen, pulling out ingredients with the casual ease of someone who absolutely, definitely, 100% had NOT conquered the Persian Empire.

""No!"" Alex shouted, following him into the kitchen like a detective who'd finally cornered a suspect. ""You don't get to slip up, say 'I didn't look like that,' and then gaslight me with TACOS! You ARE Alexander the Great! Admit it!""

John, dicing onions with the precision of a surgeon—or a battle-hardened general—shook his head. ""I'm John Harrow, data consultant's roommate, occasional history buff, and current taco chef. That's it. You want cilantro or no cilantro?""

""I DON'T CARE ABOUT CILANTRO!"" Alex's voice cracked. ""You've got military papers from three wars, a butler who serves your family for GENERATIONS, you're on CNBC being called a genius who doesn't age, and now you're critiquing Alexander the Great's battle tactics like you PERSONALLY EXECUTED THEM!""

John seasoned the meat, humming what Alex was now certain was an ancient Macedonian marching tune. ""It's called being well-read, Alex. I appreciate military history. Sue me.""

""I CAN'T SUE YOU BECAUSE YOU PROBABLY HELPED WRITE THE LAWS!"" Alex grabbed his phone with shaking hands and texted Sarah: ""JOHN SLIPPED. SAID 'I DIDN'T LOOK LIKE THAT' ABOUT ALEXANDER THE GREAT. THEN DENIED EVERYTHING. I'M LOSING MY MIND.""

Sarah's reply was instant: ""RECORD HIM. GET IT ON VIDEO. WE'RE GOING TO ANCIENT ALIENS.""

Alex didn't record anything. He was too busy watching John cook carnitas with the confidence of someone who'd probably taught Macedonian army chefs how to properly season lamb before a conquest.

# The Aggressive Denial

""Okay,"" Alex said, his voice hoarse from shouting. ""Let's say—hypothetically—you WERE Alexander the Great. How would that even work? You'd be over 2,000 years old. You'd have to be immortal. Which would explain EVERYTHING—the military papers, Lucifer, Death, the crown, the ruby, Aegis Q, ALL OF IT.""

John plated the tacos with the artistry of someone who'd perfected the craft over centuries. ""That's a fun thought experiment, Alex. But I'm not 2,000 years old. I'm 43. Born in 1982, New Jersey. Normal guy, normal life. Just happen to be really into history and really good at making tacos.""

""YOU WERE NOT BORN IN NEW JERSEY!""

""Camden, actually. Rough neighborhood. Builds character."" John slid a plate toward him. ""These are perfect. Try one.""

Alex stared at the taco—perfectly assembled, cilantro garnished, lime wedged artistically on the side—and wanted to throw it across the room. But it smelled like heaven, and his stomach betrayed him.

He took a bite. It was, predictably, divine.

""See?"" John said, grinning. ""Not the work of a 2,300-year-old Macedonian conqueror. Just a guy who learned to cook from the internet. YouTube tutorials, man. Changed my life.""

Alex chewed in furious silence, mentally updating his spreadsheet.

*Sheet: ""Evidence of Immortality""*

New entry: John slipped while watching Alexander the Great documentary. Said ""I didn't look like that"" in first person, then demonstrated perfect Macedonian sword grip and critiqued battle tactics with expertise that suggests firsthand knowledge. Claimed he meant ""he,"" blamed ""immersive learning."" OBVIOUS LIE. Deflected with tacos (carnitas, cilantro, perfect as usual).

*Sheet: ""Deflections/Excuses""*

New entry: ""I said 'he,' you're hearing things."" ""Immersive learning."" ""I'm from New Jersey."" ""YouTube tutorials.""

*Sheet: ""Food Bribes""*

New entry: Carnitas tacos with cilantro and lime (consumed under extreme duress and emotional distress).

# The Next Morning's Gaslighting

The next day, John acted like nothing had happened. He made coffee—some artisanal Kenyan blend that probably cost more per ounce than Alex's dignity—and hummed what Alex now recognized as a tune that predated Christianity.

Alex tried one more time. ""So, that documentary last night. You really think you just... misspoke?""

John flipped a waffle with the precision of a man who'd probably invented breakfast. ""Yeah, man. I was tired, got too into critiquing the acting. Sometimes I slip into present tense when I'm analyzing stuff. Happens to everyone.""

""It does NOT happen to everyone,"" Alex muttered, but John was already whistling and plating waffles that looked like they belonged in a Michelin-star brunch spot.

The rent was still cheap. Merlin's cookies were still in the fridge. And John was still the most infuriating, deflection-champion, probably-Alexander-the-Great billionaire immortal roommate in the history of Brooklyn.

Thoughts:

First off, this trip was not planned , nor was it a vacation -  last minute trip to see family. I pretty much hung around the house or a hospital , but I did use just about everything in my bag except for the power bank or the brick from my MacBook kit. Not really worth pairing that down for the sake of saving space or weight. 

Biggest benefit to the whole trip was wearing the vest to the airport. Sure I look like safari enthusiast or some kind of amateur-on-professional photographer, but I love the utility of the vest. Big pockets, closed via velcro or zippers. It’s basically a cheat; not a personal item, but acts like a personal item. During screening, I throw my phone , wallet, belt and watch/ring into my vest pockets - then take the whole thing off and put it in my tray along with my backpack. 

Even in Texas Summers, I still wore the long-sleeve t-shirt hoodie. It worked so well the first night since it acted like a sleep mask on the plane and in the bed. 

Okay, United Club Austin is at least twice as good as the United Club Houston location, the restrooms were not even in the IAH club, so It’s basically only worth it for breakfast and coffee, as well as a dedicated place to sit.",2,1763162290.0,onebag,0,1.0,False

A month ago I interested more and more about norse mythology and searched information, particularly about Loki. The day after an earthquake of almost 4 points happened where I live. A lot of stinkbugs appeared in and out my house in those days. Some flies too. But I had the confirmation when another earthquake happened, and I dream about Floki from Vikings joining me into a blacksmith's workshop/forge, which resembled my altar to Shiva.  
I do not know exactly how to work with divinities, but I asked Loki to guide me in my research for my fylgja. Guided by intuition and the answers of my runes, I said: The first animal I find in my feed of Instagram might be my fylgja. The first animal I saw was a grey canine, but there was only his nose and whiskers. So I prayed Loki to guide me in my dreams. In my dreams I saw again which seemed dogs or coyotes, twice. So I chose to interpret that they were a coyote for my Indigenous American origins and the correlation with Loki and Coyotl, for they are tricksters.  
I accepted Loki's guidance for I admire Him so much (He's super smart, has a great sense of humour, has the courage to tell bitter truths even in the faces of the gods, and he's so powerful too). I've read ""Reviving Loki"" by Ocean Keltoi and it was inspiring. For it tells how the sources we have are corrupted by the christian faith of Saxo Grammaticus and Snorri Sturluson. Even the death of Baldur is not sure. Any way I decide to believe in Loki.  
My point is: What practices do you use to work with Him? (I know He likes coffee, alcohol and candy. But what else can I do? Can you tell me in what ways you work with Loki and let Him permeate your Soul? Thank you for reading and thank you in advance if you decide to answer :)",1,1763162274.0,lokean,0,1.0,False

It’s definitely not always been easy and we’ve been through a lot. We’ve experienced some major issues in our separate lives and I have always been there for his and he’s tried to be there for mine. I love him more than life itself and every other day I’m planning the rest of our lives together. Every part of us is intertwined with each other from family to friends to work, etc. He’s honestly the love of my life and I can’t imagine life without him. But I simply can’t do this anymore. I do everything in our relationship. I buy groceries, clean, bake, budget, when he struggles in school I do it for him, I plan all of our dates and trips. I take care of our dog, get him tickets to places he mentions in passing, buy him the things he asks for, take care of his friends when their over, do all the laundry, I mean absolutely everything. But when I ask for him to do anything  he forgets or ignores. For example when he moved into a new apartment all I asked was that he got a bed frame, after 10 reminders and 4 weeks later, he failed to get it and left me to buy it on move in day. He promised me a vanity for this new apartment bc I had no space at his other one to put my makeup on and he failed to buy it. When I bought one I asked him to help me put it together but he just criticized how slow I was taking to build it and then fell asleep before it was finished. I asked for him to book a single date for our anniversary vacation and he failed to do it so I had to book it the night before while also doing his school work that he swore he already did. I bought him a nice vacuum and told him to make sure to clean it, and he didn’t the few times he actually used it so it got backed up and now doesn’t work good. I asked him to wash the towels so that when I come home I have something to dry off with and he didn’t so he just passed me a old shirt to dry off with when I got out of the shower. I let him borrow my brand new car when his broke down and all I asked was for him to keep it clean, he didn’t. This is only a few examples of this cycle. It’s not like I haven’t talked to him about this and we have a conversation about it every single week. And every single time he changes for a single day and then goes right back to how he was before. After a large fight a few weeks ago, I thought he had gotten better because the next morning he got up early and got my favorite coffee and flowers but a few days later he couldn’t remember anything I said. The only thing he does is cook but he rarely does that and leaves me to DoorDash our dinner. ( I don’t because the only time I tried and asked him to teach me he was rude the entire time) I’ve given him empathy because he has autism and adhd but I can’t do it anymore. I’ve also tried just not doing anything and then nothing gets done and I’m left with an even more list of tasks to do when the mess gets to much.

My breaking point was today when I asked him to pick me up some medicine from the store and he didn’t. A few days ago I asked that he would go pick it up after he got off work cause I wouldn’t have time and he “forgot” so I asked him to just get it before I come back to the apartment today.( I couldn’t get it because I was taking care of my elderly grandma, working, and had back to back Dr appointments) Yesterday I texted 3 times to make sure he picked it up and he said he did, today when I couldn’t find it I called him and he said “he didn’t get it, he only said he did because he was planning on getting it after he got done eating dinner.” I know it’s small but I’m sick of this and I broke down. In my breakdown I saw a clip from the movie “The Break-up” and decided to watch it. Without all the funny situations, I am living that movie right now. I’ve never been able to explain to him how I genuinely feel and I think the movie explains it perfectly. So I decided tonight, we will watch it together and if he still doesn’t care, I’m done. We’ve broken up before but that was in high school and never for to long. I thought we were better but I’ve realized it’s only because I’ve done everything for him. Idk how this is going to go because I’m currently living with him 5 days out of the week and my home life isn’t well and I can’t afford an apartment. Idk what else to do, I love him so incredibly much but I feel like I’m an idiot. Idk if I’ll even have the strength to leave, I just don’t know",3,1763161898.0,BreakUps,3,0.72,False

ive never had any milkbar cake but in looking for a recipe to do for this challenge i came across this. i was looking for kind of a celebratory cake because my 1000th day sober was also coming up so i wanted to combine the two. 

it was definitely a time consuming cake but i made the different components over 3 days so it didnt feel so overwhelming. 

when you have a bite of all components together its very good and blends so well together! however if you get too much of either the canolli or the chocolate crumb it can be a bit much. for some reason the chocolate crumb is a bit salty (user error maybe) and the canolli is really good but kind of feels thick. i have no complaints about the vanilla cake with coffee syrup or coffee buttercream as those are both great on its own. also a thin slice is all you need, its surprisingly not a sweet cake but it is rich. i think one layer of this cake would suffice to be honest, but the milkbar style is fun. im not sure i would make it again but im overall glad for the experience!

My beans are all single origins, roasted within three months and delivered from a grocery in the city (Pilot coffee roasters in Toronto). 

I didn’t do enough research and bought the Breville smart grinder pro which jammed on the very first attempt at grinding… I returned it and bought another and the same thing happened. 

Apparently, (what an espresso machine store employee told me) the beans are too hard, fresh, and oily on the inside for this kind of grinder, and I got lucky with the Dose Control Pro to have even made it almost 2 years. 

He said I’d be surprised that I can get away with the Smeg which they use in their shop as demos and have dialled in to work decently… Comparing to my DeLonghi, he said it would be a similar pull.

My DeLonghi is working fine however it’s just over 3 years old. 

Here’s my dilemma:

Do I buy a brand new, higher quality grinder for about $700 (based on my lifestyle, a hopper based grinder with a portafilter basket is important for me) and then upgrade the DeLonghi when it goes out…

I don’t want single dose, and I don’t want to have to put it in a cup and then into my portafilter basket. 

Or do I just get the Smeg Manual Two in One for now and upgrade again in 3-5 years?

While I am not on a tight budget… I also don’t want to be dropping a couple thousand dollars for nothing.

I thought it might be a pressure issue, but today I received my gauge and I’m able to maintain a pressure pretty tightly around 9 bar, but with the grind size used for the Micra it’s still taking a minute + to extract. But the coffee is pretty good!

Plot & Setting:

· The male protagonist is a student. Due to severe sleep deprivation, he starts to perceive a ""other world"" layered over our own.
· In this other world, there is a lonely male character with cat ears. This cat boy is lonely and doesn't want the protagonist to leave.

Key Gameplay Scenes & Endings:

· The game starts with the protagonist in class, almost falling asleep. He is given a choice of drink (coffee, tea, etc.) which has hidden consequences.
· There is a crucial scene where you can lock the cat boy in a closet, rationalizing it because you're so sleep-deprived you don't understand how he got there. You can then choose to either go to sleep or listen to him.
· There are many bad endings. If you fail a QTE on the stairs, you can fall, break your leg, and likely die.
· The cat boy can also murder the protagonist if you answer his requests incorrectly.

Other Details:

· The Russian fan translation had a famous mistranslation where ""Sanity"" was translated as ""Санитарные условия"" (""Sanitary Conditions"").
· The art style was fairly common/standard.

It's a dark game with a lot of endings. Please help me find the name!",1,1763161392.0,tipofmyjoystick,1,1.0,False

And it bloody popped all over the car. Cause I accidentally grabbed it wrong and the lid came off. While I was about to start driving again after a red light.

It's all good now but damn I even got my windshield 😂

  
Anyways, staying at my family friends has helped a lot. I went on a walk around the dog park and actually managed to walk a lot better than last time (I think due to my waitressing job). Also I spent time with them without my phone which was nice too :)

Also my friend showed a slideshow of his experiences on a boat with a bunch of other people, and they had to manage sails and all of that! It was very cool!

Haven't really thought about my ex too much. I did a bit, and in the car I did pretend I was arguing with him (ik, sad). Then I stopped cause I didn't want to get distracted whilst driving.
