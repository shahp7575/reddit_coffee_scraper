In case it has any relevance at all, I also suffer from depression and anxiety, which in times can make me relate to him while also seeing him as this unnattainable standard. All this said, Ive never been one to glorify celebrities or go all crazy over them and honestly I find it disturbing the lengths some ppl will go to just bc they like an artist or something. That said, last night, I dreamt I met Chris in a coffee shop. It was very short, as he seemed to be about to leave, surrounded by bodyguards and adoring fans, but even then he looked at me and acknowledged me and even said maybe one or two words I cant remember rn. All I remember is feeling like I had so little time, and as he walked out I said something like ""youre my absolute hero as a singer!"" but he never turned around like I was hoping, and simply walked out, back facing me. Idk who else was supposed to be there with me, but I said to someone ""I wish I could save him"" but all they could do was assure me that it was unfortunately impossible. This is a really strange dream and Ive never rlly had one like it, I didnt remember it immediately as I woke up, but as soon as I did I couldnt stop sobbing.",1,1728130494.0,Soundgarden,0,1.0,False

With Navaratri keepin us up late, that extra caffeine boost is 100% needed.

I've finally decided to follow up on that, and I want to start with 10 customers! Reply with your interest, and I'll send you a seperate deck with the pricing and subscription option.

I'll be brewing a new roast every week, and roasts that get the most positive reviews will be brought back.

Last month I chose to go fully to 37.5mg since the kids went back to school and I knew my workout routine wouldn’t be as strict. Through the 5 months I did 50mg of Top - 25mg in morning and night. At first I didn’t work out at all but the middle two months I did strength training 3 times a week and was very mindful of my steps and extra walks. September brought back school and activities for the kids and no time for working out. I had no real adverse side effects. First week some elevated heart rate, definitely helped with focus daily. The top makes soda flat. Cut energy drinks but not coffee, constant post nasal drip feeling but I felt great on it until the last month. High stress time at work and my anxiety was at level 10 which I couldn’t decide if it was due to increasing to full dose or work so chose to cut the med for a bit.

She said I can stay on Top during the break but I’m already seeing a very slight gain - I’m hoping due to less water intake, hormones etc…Anyone have any luck with a month break?

1fwotkz,https://www.reddit.com/r/scarystories/comments/1fwotkz/it_was_her_favorite_chair/,It was her favorite chair ,"We found it on the roadside at the end of a cul-de-sac. Just sitting there in an open patch of grass. That meant free, according to my wife, Clare.  

Apart from that fact, I didn’t see what the appeal was. The upholstery was faded, the black sunflower print worn out into blobs of grey. The beige fabric was frayed at the edges of the stitching attached to its cheery wood frame.  She could never get that spot out of the seat cushion. I always wondered why. 

 Clare experimented with the placement of the chair for a long time. Some days I’d find it in the corner of the study, other days it would be sitting in the family room. We’d watch movies together, her eyes flickering shut, her head resting against the padding. Her hand in mine. It was ugly, but if she loved it, I didn’t mind. I was no interior decorator myself.

One evening when Clare was working, I left the cartoons running and exited the living room. It was only for a second to shut off the burner, the kettle whining atop the hot stove. I heard the thud and came running.

Our daughter, Harper, was unresponsive, lying in a pool of blood. She was just learning to walk. I figured she had tried to climb one of the armrests and fell, hitting her head on the edge of the coffee table. It would have been quite the fall, but it wasn’t a stretch. 

Clare rushed to the E.R., but there was nothing they could do. She had lost too much blood. 

“I’m going to get rid of it,” Clare promised, in tears. Bad juju, we both agreed. She could hardly be in the same room as it anymore because it reminded her of what happened.  

The last place I found it was in the basement. I had hardly noticed it at first because my eyes were fixed on her. 

Clare’s dusty footprints were on the seat where she had reached up and tied the noose. Her limp body twisted and turned, her lips bloated and purple. Her stare was gone.

The chair stood under her, angled towards me. I approached slowly, rubbing my fingers along the arms. Fresh slashes were carved into the wood. In the hollow trenches were tiny speckles of blood. 

The stain on the cushion had spread, dark as a pool of tar.

\*\*\*

The chair has found its way to our bedroom now. 

Some nights when the house is quiet, I swear I catch glimpses of them. I’ll blink and Clare’s head will be nestled against the headrest, Harper cradled in her arms. 

All of us, together. 

And in the darkness, I know. 

I can never get rid of it now.

Ugh, this itchy scalp is driving me crazy. Keeping me up at night. Can’t sleep. And when I do, I wake up scratching. This can’t go on.
 
I’ve always had an itchy scalp. There are special shampoos for that, and I’ve tried them all. Some work better than others, but they don’t make the problem go away. Not entirely. That said, I never dreamed I’d be in this scenario. 
 
I was playing piano, working on a difficult performance piece, when the critters first appeared. As usual, my scalp was super itchy. Only this time when I scratched, something flew out and landed on my lap. I must’ve jumped a mile high. The thing was hideous, with long, curvy antennas and tiny toes, tap, tap, tapping as it crawled across my lap.
 
I squashed it. 

The thing shrieked as it exploded. Total nasty. Then, trying not to panic, I lowered my head and went to town, shaking and scratching, seeing what else was living in there.
 
“Gross!” 

A fleet of crawling critters scooted out from my hair. Ugh. Head lice. At my age? Must’ve gotten it from one of my piano students. Totally annoyed, I fled to the drug store and picked up the appropriate treatment, then I set about ridding myself of these uninvited guests.
 
The following week was spent trying to kill those little buggers, but they persevered, and kept coming back. Sleep was impossible. All I could do was lay in bed and scratch, my fingernails brown and gross from all the scratching. 

At wit’s end, I asked Marley, my BFF, to have a look. She’s tough, and certainly not the squeamish type. If she can’t help, I’m screwed.
 
Marley went in for inspection. She gasped and groaned and gagged. Five minutes later she’s running out the door, eyes wild with accusation. To this day, she won’t answer my texts. That’s when I knew something was wrong. Terribly wrong.
 
My mind went on overdrive. This is absurd. How bad could it be? Then I heard the tap, tap, tapping of tiny toes, trailblazing across my bedroom floor. I used my phone’s flashlight to have a closer look, and shuddered. My mind went sideways. I’d never seen anything so repulsive in my life. Critters, but unlike any I’d ever seen. 

With much effort, I coaxed the cretaceous-looking critters into a shoebox. Tap, tap, tap, they went, marching around the box like tiny warriors. From a distance, they looked like head lice, but they moved too fast, and made too much noise.  

Totally freaked out, I peeled off my clothes and removed my bed sheets. Laundry time! Ugh. My pillow cases were crawling with them. I shook them off into the shoebox, carefully, and threw the laundry into the machine.
 
Afterwards, I retreated to my bedroom feeling sickened and sad. Can I not have one good day? Is that too much to ask? Then I glanced into the shoebox, and nearly fainted.
 
A Battle of Epic Proportions. That’s the only way to describe it. The critters were fighting each other, crawling and biting and doing God-knows-what else. But in teams. And they were vicious. I couldn’t watch.  
 
Itch, itch, scratch, scratch.
 
My condition was worsening. My scalp and neck were sore with scabs. Over the shoebox, I scratched and itched and tossed my hair about. It looked like a Christmas snow globe, where snow dances after shaking it. Except this wasn’t snow, this was some hideous form of head lice. 

Or so I thought.
 
I went online and did some research, and it became glaringly obvious I wasn’t dealing with head lice. Not even close. Their behavior didn’t match. Head lice don’t battle each other. Nor did they form groups. Plus, these buggers were too big. Ugh. Now what? 

I fetched my microscope, which I hadn’t used in years, and caught one. I put it under the microscope for a closer look, and nearly died. My mind was on the brink. This can’t be happening, I told myself, again and again. This isn’t real. 

But it was.
 
I went online, searching for matches. Nothing matched. These cruel-looking critters had fangs and claws and wings. The wings scared me most. If they could fly, then what? For now, at least, they crawled; tap, tap, tapping as they skittered across the shoebox.  
 
I crushed it. Then I scooted to the washroom and regurgitated my breakfast. My stomach was turning faster than the laundry machine. After showering, I set off to work, scared and confused. It was a miserable day, lemme tell ya. As a piano instructor, I sit close to the students. I did my very best at keeping a distance, but there’s only one piano, and it’s a modest sized room.  
 
Itch, itch, scratch, scratch.
 
All day I scratched, careful not to spray critters everywhere, but unable to help myself. I was constantly cleaning the gunk from my fingernails, which were brown and gross, and in plain view as I played piano. Finally, my shift ended and I scooted home as fast as possible, hoping to get to the bottom of this. Those little buggers must’ve come from somewhere, right?
 
When I got home, I gasped. The shoebox had completely transformed. Inside the box was a city. They must’ve scoured my bedroom for supplies. But how? A discarded sock, for instance, was torn to shreds and used as grass. Little specs of cotton now covered the entire base of the box. My favorite Pokémon card, which I’d kept since I was a kid, was chewed up and made into tiny houses. Not only that, they were using my empty earbud container as a swimming pool! Like, where did they get the water? 
 
I had to stand back and catch my breath. My heart was threatening to explode. I’m twenty-five, I told myself, way too young for a heart attack. Then I noticed something deeply disturbing: the shoebox was divided into halves. One side was sophisticated, with houses and a public pool etc. The other side was filthy and unkempt, with big black mounds – which may have been feces – piled high around the edges of the box. Droplets of blood were splattered across the socky grass, staining it crimson-red. 
 
I covered the box, then spent all night on the computer, looking for answers. I researched thousands of species of insects, but none fit the description. Not even close.
 
Coffee became my salvation. I was ridiculously tired, and should probably be kept under quarantine, but bills are bills. Having no other source of income, I had to work. I knew damn-well I shouldn’t be out in public, the last thing I wanted to do was infect anyone, but what choice did I have? Ugh. This was awful. The Battle of Epic Proportions was taking place on my scalp, and I was the referee.

Itch, itch, scratch, scratch.

Somehow, I made it through work, itching and scratching, clawing my scalp with tremendous force. When I got home, I went straight to my room. I live in a small one-bedroom apartment, so at least there weren’t roommates to contend with. That said, I wish I had someone to confide in. Then again, look at what happened last time. I still hadn't heard from Marley. Oh, the conundrum.
 
The shoebox was gone. I scratched my head, this time out of confusion. I swear I’d left it in the middle of the floor.
 
Panic. 

First, I checked the closet, searching frantically through wardrobes. Nothing. Then I got on my hands and knees and searched under the bed. Aha! Found it. Sneaky buggers.  When I flashed a light, the bugs disappeared, skittering inside their newly developed homes, or mounds of poop, depending on what side of the box they were living in. 

The box was buzzy. I couldn’t believe my eyes. The sophisticated critters, enjoying a more luxurious lifestyle, had constructed some kind of recreation area using pens and pencils and pieces of scrap paper. Plus, they had condos! I swear to God, they did! Ugh, they’d stolen more Pokémon cards. Hence forward, I started referring to them as Mavericks.

Inside the shoebox was a war zone. Hundreds of critters were dead, mostly from the gross side. Apparently, the Mavericks had conquered them. But not entirely. The Filthy’s (as I’ve come to call them), were fighting back, making horrible hissing sounds, then taking refuge in the mounds of poop. 
 
Itch, itch, scratch, scratch.
 
My head was worsening, my neck red with rash. Feverishly, I flung my head over the box and scratched. Ahh, sweet relief. When I stood up, I gasped. The entire box was filled with bugs. To them, a tornado must’ve touched down. Next thing I know, both sides went to work, separating one species from the other, fussing and fighting and squeaking and squalling.
 
Using tweezers, I scooped up a Filthy for inspection. Yikes! Unlike the Mavericks, these buggers were fat, with crap-like bellies, and hundreds of tiny legs. No wings. Their teeth were treacherous, like tiny razor blades, their eyes were glowing red bulbs.
 
I crushed it.
 
I considered seeing a doctor, but waiting for hours, only to be given lice shampoo, was not a top priority. So, I shaved my head. Goodbye golden locks. Hello sweet relief. For whatever reason, I put my defiled hair into the shoebox. The creatures went on a warpath, gathering the precious cargo, hissing and squawking and fighting. Then I took the box out back and set it on fire. The sound was horrendous, like a million tiny souls screaming out at once. The smell was way worse. Completely distraught, I retreated into my bedroom, longing for a good night’s rest. 
 
Itch, itch, scratch, scratch.

Only now, my belly itched. What the? I flashed a light. Those godawful critters were scampering across my abdomen. One poked out of my belly button. I crushed it, then I turned on the bedside light, and screamed. They were everywhere! My entire floor was shimmering, like a moving carpet. Ugh, another sleepless night. 
 
…

A week has passed, and I’m at a loss. Ultimately, I did see a doctor, and as predicted, after waiting nearly two hours, she gave me special cream and sent me on my way. 
 
Itch, itch, scratch, scratch.
 
I do miss my hair, but I don’t miss the creepy critters. My scalp is starting to heal, but I can’t get the buggers out of my apartment. Every time I kill one, they multiply. So, for now, they’re staying. Ugh. Like the shoebox, my bedroom is divided into halves. The Battle of Epic Proportions continues. 

I can only wonder how long the war will last, and who will be victorious. Every time the Filthy’s seem to be conquered, like true underdogs, they regroup and retaliate, killing thousands of Mavericks. 

But how? 

They’ve discovered fire. Maybe the tea light candles were a bad idea. I pray they don’t burn my house down.

Back then I didnt rlly know him so I only became a massive fan of his, after he had sadly died. In case it helps at all, I also suffer from depression and anxiety, which in times can make me relate to him while also seeing him as this unnattainable standard. All this said, Ive never been one to glorify celebrities or go all crazy over them and honestly I find it disturbing the lengths some ppl will go to just bc they like an artist or something. That said, last night, I dreamt I met Chris in a coffee shop. It was very short, as he seemed to be about to leave, surrounded by bodyguards and adoring fans, but even then he looked at me and acknowledged me and even said maybe one or two words I cant remember rn. All I remember is feeling like I had so little time, and as he walked out I said something like ""youre my absolute hero as a singer!"" but he never turned around like I was hoping, and simply walked out, back facing me. Idk who else was supposed to be there with me, but I said to someone ""I wish I could save him"" but all they could do was assure me that it was unfortunately impossible. This is a really strange dream and Ive never rlly had one like it, I didnt remember it immediately as I woke up, but as soon as I did I couldnt stop sobbing.",1,1728129531.0,Dreams,0,1.0,False

Hello, thank you for reading this post. 
I am a 20 years old international student and I was looking for a shareflat, and I have got in trouble with the landlord.

Two weeks ago I've found a good one. I went for an inspection and liked it, and I payed the deposit to live from the end of this month. The landlord is a male and he is maybe around his late thirties.
Though, the room didn't have a desk and a chair I needed, and the landlord told me he will purchase them for me so that let's keep in touch about it.
 A week ago, he told me if I want to grab a cup of coffee with him. I agreed and also for looking for the desk and the chair I need. After coffee, we went to the shareflat once again and he invited me to his room. 

I had no idea what was going on in his mind since I thought he was being nice and have chat with me, now I know I have should been more careful. We were watching TV for a while and then he suddenly started to compliment me, and said to me if he can give me a kiss. I didn't like it so I told him no, but he also touched my thighs. I was really overwhelmed but I kept telling him I'm not here for any these kind of things. He didn't try to get violent nor tried to push me down. He stopped and told me ""We don't have to be in any relationship. Also I thought all this hang out was for us to have fun in the end. But I won't do that unless you change your mind in the future."" He didn't do any further and drove me to the city after that. 
The bad side of me was I was still being polite and nice to him. He kept texting me about restaurants he wants to go with me and these kinds of small talk on texts but nothing inappropriate.

But two days ago, I've decided to change the shareflat because I think it is possible he could take an advantage of me. I told him about it, and that I want my deposit back last morning. 
Here is the overall conversation since I cannot attach the image here, I copied his messages from the app;

*Me: I was thinking about what happened two days ago and I've been feeling uncomfortable about it.
-Landlord: I'll back off completely.. I'm moving on with another girl already..so it's fine
*Me: No, it's not fine to me because I'm yet not feeling comfortable living around you. I would like my money back
-Landlord: Okie well here's the deal.. U accepted to come back to my place..with full knowledge that I liked u.. So..if u just want to back out of the deal, especially after waiting for so long, to move in? No..I'm not giving u back ur money
*Me: You will give me back my money or I will report you to the police for assault because that's exactly what you have done.
-Landlord: No I didn't
*Me: You have. I did not like what you did to me. I would like to my deposit back.

After I sent the last message, he hasn't replied me yet. At this point, I have no idea about what he said. I didn't know he had feelings for me. What should I do from this? First, I need my money back because it was a big amount for me. Also I don't think police will take it seriously and make it into an incident because I don't have any evidence. Now I think I should have recorded it but I was too overwhelmed to think about it at that moment. Also I couldn't say anything whilst he was driving me back to the city, he touched my thighs once or twice.

I am going to contact my school on Monday and agency if they can help me because they're closed on weekends. But at the same time, I don't want to because I don't want to put burden on anyone.

My English is not good so I am sorry if you struggled reading this. Please ask me if you have questions about the thing you didn't quite catch.

How do I navigate this?,"My girlfriend and I have been dating for 4 months. She has been the most supportive and mature partner I’ve ever had. Things have been so good. We have so many good, fun memories together and she’s very affectionate. 

We spend a lot of time together and it’s generally always fun and warm. This past weekend we had a wedding to go to, and we had such an amazing time and at the end of the night she got drunk and before she fell asleep she spilled a lot of stuff on me about how much she cares about me and wants me to be a part of her life and is deeply in love with me. Spent the day together Sunday and everything was fine. 

Monday night notice she seems off when I visit her after work. Opens up to me about how her bartending hours got cut, she’s not getting paid from her second job and she hates her third job and is really stressed. Tuesday she seems distant. Not telling me she loves me back at first, not responsive, etc. Randomly run into her at the end of the day and she opens up about how she’s just stressed and dealing with a lot. Make an effort to support her. Calls me on the way to her moms and tells me she loves me. Texts me on her way home saying she’s up if I want to talk for awhile before bed. 
Wednesday ignores my text all day after she texted me in the morning. Texts me at the end of the day saying I can call her when I’m off. Seems very quiet and distant. Calls me after her work meeting but I was asleep at that point. 

We go out together Thursday and everything seems fine. She had changed her phone background to a picture of us and made a joke about how she’s had the same one for 10 years and that I’m special and stuff. Have a really fun night together, she’s very affectionate. 

Tells me to call her Friday when I’m out of work. Talk on the phone for an hour before she goes into her bartending shift. She’s being sweet and flirty. Tells me she loves me. 

She’s texting me while she’s there and mentions a place we’re taking a trip to is potentially closing down and that we can talk about it in the morning. 

She then texts me and says “can we get coffee or go for a walk in the morning? Just wanna taaaalk” this is super weird and she’s never done this before. 

I say yes and ask if everything is good. She says “yes just wanna BS about some stuff. No stress lol you’re the only thing I’m sure of right now. Just bored and moody at work,” 

She texts me a little bit more and says she loves me. Texts me again when she gets home saying it ended up being a late shift and she’s not sure when she’ll see me but she’ll get ahold of me when she wakes up. 

I am kinda paranoid and freaking out. She’s never asked me to get together for coffee or a walk because she just wanted to “talk,”. I literally feel like she’s about to dump me but is just being soft about it to let me down easy. I am extremely anxious and don’t know what I did wrong or why this is happening. It’s the morning now and I’m practicing some band stuff waiting to hear from her. ",2,1728129481.0,relationship_advice,6,1.0,False

I'm a great employee, extremely hard working, get along well with the customers, and my boss has given me a lot of extra duties over time with no pay increase and I've done them without complaint.

And yet these past few months he's cut my hours drastically and when I asked why, he viciously tore me down and told me it's cuz I ""get distracted"" when my boyfriend is around (as in, my bf stands at the counter and talks to me while I do my sidework and I try to time my breaks to be while my bf is there if we're slow??)  He never gave me a heads up about this being an issue, just went straight nuclear and cut my hours over it and was extremely mean with how he put it, calling me ""unprofessional"" and telling me I need to ""earn my hours back"".

There's other reasons that I think he has some issue with my bf.  For example, there's a rule at the coffee shop that we can only play instrumental music.  So my bf, who loves music, made a lovely 20+ hour playlist of all instrumental music.  Customers love the playlist and have excitedly told me they recognize songs in it and are impressed that we're playing these ""deep cuts"".  Then one day my boss texts me and tells me I have to play a different playlist while I'm working.  He hasn't told any other baristas to change what they're playing.  Especially considering that the shop has been a total mess lately, things being out of stock and us being understaffed, it's so weird to me that what he's focusing on is a playlist??

He lies all the time so it's impossible to know what's really going on, but I feel like he has an issue with me just because I have a bf who's around a lot and I talk about a lot, and that's so illogical and creepy to me??

1fwoht2,https://www.reddit.com/r/u_homeandsoul/comments/1fwoht2/budgetfriendly_home_decor_stylish_ideas_to/,Budget-Friendly Home Decor: Stylish Ideas to Refresh Your Space,"Refreshing your home doesn’t have to mean spending a fortune. With a few strategic updates, you can transform your living space into a stylish, inviting environment without breaking the bank. From small accent pieces to rearranging existing furniture, there are countless budget-friendly home decor ideas to give your space a fresh new look. Here’s how you can achieve a home makeover on a budget using affordable and creative ideas.

**1. Rearrange and Declutter for a New Perspective**

One of the simplest and most cost-effective ways to refresh your [house decor](https://www.homeandsouldubai.com/) is by rearranging your furniture and decluttering your space. Shifting the layout of your room can create a whole new dynamic without spending a penny. Decluttering also helps in highlighting key decor pieces, like a stylish rug or a statement light fixture. A clean and organized space immediately feels more inviting and spacious, setting the stage for new decor additions.

**2. Add Texture with Affordable Rugs**

A well-chosen rug can instantly transform a room, adding warmth, texture, and a stylish touch. The great news is that you don’t need to invest in high-end rugs to make a difference. There are plenty of budget-friendly options available that still provide the luxe feel and design you’re looking for. If you're shopping in the UAE, [rugs Dubai](https://www.homeandsouldubai.com/textiles/rugs) offer a wide range of affordable options that cater to various styles, from modern and minimalist to bohemian and eclectic. Whether it’s a bold patterned rug for your living room or a cozy neutral one for your bedroom, this simple addition can make a huge impact.

**3. Illuminate Your Space with Stylish Table Lamps**

Lighting plays a critical role in home decor, and one of the easiest ways to update your space is by adding or swapping out light fixtures. [Table lamps for living room](https://www.homeandsouldubai.com/lighting/table-lamps) are a budget-friendly solution that not only illuminates your space but also adds a decorative element. Look for unique designs that complement your existing decor, such as modern metallic bases, ceramic textures, or lamps with colorful shades. These small but significant pieces can create cozy corners or draw attention to key areas in your living room, like a coffee table or a reading nook.

**4. Introduce Fresh Colors with Accent Pieces**

A fresh coat of paint might not always be in the budget, but you can still introduce new colors into your home with inexpensive accent pieces. Throw pillows, blankets, and curtains in vibrant or neutral tones can breathe new life into your house decor. Opt for colors that align with the mood you want to create—soft, warm hues for a cozy feel, or bright, bold colors for a more dynamic atmosphere. Layering these accents adds texture and dimension without the need for expensive renovations.

**5. DIY Wall Art and Decorations**

When it comes to personalizing your space on a budget, DIY decor is a fantastic way to save money while creating something meaningful. You can craft your own wall art, framed prints, or decorative pieces using materials you already have at home or can find at a low cost. Repurposing old picture frames, using fabric remnants to create wall hangings, or even framing your favorite postcards can all add a unique touch to your space. Plus, DIY decor allows you to customize your home according to your taste and personal style.

**6. Incorporate Plants for a Fresh, Natural Look**

Adding plants to your home is an affordable way to breathe life and color into any room. Houseplants come in a variety of sizes and price points, making it easy to find options that fit your budget and style. Small potted plants like succulents or hanging plants can make a big impact when grouped together. If you’re looking for a statement piece, consider a larger indoor plant to fill an empty corner. Not only do plants improve air quality, but they also give your space a refreshing, natural vibe.

**7. Create a Statement with a Feature Wall**

If you’re looking for a more dramatic change, consider creating a feature wall. You don’t need expensive wallpaper or designer paint to achieve this. Peel-and-stick wall decals are a budget-friendly alternative and come in a variety of patterns and textures. You can also create a gallery wall with a mix of framed photos, prints, and art pieces that you already own. A feature wall draws attention and adds personality to your home without the need for a full-scale renovation.

**8. Use Mirrors to Enhance Space and Light**

Mirrors are not only practical but also a stylish addition to any room. They help make small spaces feel larger and brighter by reflecting light and creating the illusion of depth. Look for affordable mirrors in different shapes and sizes to add a decorative element to your house decor. Placing a mirror above a fireplace, in a hallway, or on a feature wall can instantly elevate your room's aesthetic without a hefty price tag.

**Conclusion**

Refreshing your home decor on a budget is entirely possible with a bit of creativity and thoughtful planning. From rearranging your furniture and adding new rugs in Dubai to incorporating stylish table lamps for living rooms, these affordable updates can have a significant impact on your home’s overall look and feel. By combining functional pieces with a few trendy decor accents, you can create a stylish, refreshed space that reflects your personality—all without breaking the bank!",1,1728128628.0,u_homeandsoul,0,1.0,False

Six court appearances (one missed, and looking to be in court this coming Wednesday), four cells later, and a dead father in the morgue who I'm fighting tooth and nail to delay his funeral till I come out…and so half a thousand days passed. 

In this time, I've had experiences that stretched me beyond my elastic limit that I had to either increase my limit or break. I chose the former.

Also, I've known pain, known sickness, known hunger, and no stranger to want. At some point I was continually down with fever day in and day out. That was the season when I had no fan and sweated so much on my mattress it looked like the rain emptied on it. 

Food has been so scarce sometimes in this time that I'd had to go without for three consecutive days (and night) and it was by no means fasting. This is owing to the rations being so bad, uneatable and drugged so I and most would rather starve than eat.

Half a thousand days after and I haven't stopped writing about my experiences here since the first day I began…saving memories of each passing day religiously as if a deity bid me on. 

Maybe this deity smiled on me by also commanding his angels to shine the light of their kindnesses my way. For this, I'm eternally grateful.

Men and women in their seasons and numbers have rose to become a part of my story, hold my hand, and walk this walk with me. Some give time, others lend wisdom, while still others give money by supporting me through my [coffee page ](http://buymeacoffee.com/headboy9) and other more personal methods. 

I'm in your debts forever. Some years hence and hence I'll be telling your names to my grandchildren and reciting them as the last sounds off my lips as I draw my last breath. Know that these 501 days wouldn't be possible without you.

The first half of a thousand days have ended with their memories and the second half began.

In the morning I had a teaching session in the cell in on the subject of life and death. Great session as always. Not so great an audience and platform. 

The pressure of the allegation against me, plus just being in prison, and the effect of losing my dad have combined to get me stuck up in my head and unable to talk to people – both family and friends. I haven't called my lawyer but hope I'm able to bring myself to do so…

Generally. If we use the real espresso and milk to make latte , the milk foam should be wash out sometime( picture 1), my understanding is because the density of espresso is not enough and also the coffee crema make affect sometime to make the milk foam will separate to foam and milk .

But this phenomenon is not happening on my fake espresso and some other liquid like chocolate or food coloring water .

So I’m just wondering if it is possible to ask the reason why the milk will only separate on espresso and if I want to copy this phenomenon, how should I do.

Sorry for the long message.
I’m just want try to make sure that I could explain more clearly.

my boyfriend and i have been together for 2 years. during these 2 years my mom has been extremely weird and i’m not sure if i can begin to fathom and wrap my head around this entire situation. i can’t seem to believe that my mom is a narcissist even though i know she is. 

during these two years she’s gotten upset on how my boyfriend pays me attention, how he brings me chocolates and flowers and proceeds to say “i can’t believe you made him bring you this, poor kid.” (we’re in our early 20’s.) 

she constantly asks where he is, what he’s doing, when he’s coming over, it’s really annoying. she asks me at least 3 times a day. she constantly asks me if we’ve broken up and if he’s broken up with me. 

shes very vocal about the her being upset that he chose me and not her. she doesn’t understand how he chose me, “who doesn’t do stuff around the house,” and not her, “someone who knows how to cook and clean”
(i do, im the one that mainly cleans & cooks around here because she’s always sleeping and my sisters are always my responsibility.) 

i always had speculations that she was obsessed with him but didn’t really start to believe it a bit until recently. just recently, in the admist of looking for my eddies that she took away from me, i found 4 of my love letters that he had written to me in her things. the letters were hidden away and i wouldn’t have found them if i wasn’t looking for my gummies. 

my letters and everything small he has given me, i put in a box hidden away because she has a habit of going through my things. so how she got them is very concerning. they weren’t like on a hallmark or american greetings card. 
the letters were on journal paper and were made to look old. (he used coffee grounds and lit up the edges) 

oh! she’s also gotten mad that he got me a necklace with our initials on it for our 1 year. she also got mad because he got me a promise ring for our year and a half. she also proceeded to steal both of these from me. 

i don’t really know what to do. whenever i have to deal with this weird behavior of hers, i question reality a lot. i really don’t want to believe that this is really happening. i am in the constant doubt that it’s all in my head and maybe im just reading too much into the situation and possibly being “delusional” as she would say.",1,1728127996.0,NarcissisticMothers,0,1.0,False
1fwobyd,https://www.reddit.com/r/u_homeandsoul/comments/1fwobyd/maximizing_small_spaces_smart_furniture_solutions/,Maximizing Small Spaces: Smart Furniture Solutions for Compact Homes,"Living in a compact home doesn’t mean you have to sacrifice style or comfort. With smart furniture solutions, even the smallest spaces can feel spacious, functional, and cozy. Here’s how you can make the most of your square footage with creative furniture choices, especially if you’re looking to incorporate [natural furniture](https://www.homeandsouldubai.com/) that brings warmth and character into your home.

**1. Opt for a 2 Seater Sofa for a Cozy Living Area**

When working with limited space, a large sofa can easily overwhelm a room. Instead, consider a [2 seater sofa](https://www.homeandsouldubai.com/product/munich-sofa-white) that fits perfectly in small living rooms without dominating the entire area. A compact sofa not only provides enough seating for you and a guest but also leaves room for other essential furniture like coffee tables and side tables.

For an added touch of elegance and practicality, choose natural materials like wood or linen. Natural furniture, with its earthy tones and textures, can make your space feel grounded and inviting. This type of furniture blends seamlessly with minimalist decor and helps create an open, airy atmosphere.

**2. Multifunctional Furniture is Key**

One of the best ways to maximize space is by choosing multifunctional pieces. Think storage ottomans, extendable dining tables, or wall-mounted desks that can fold away when not in use. Natural furniture like wooden storage benches can provide a dual purpose by acting as both seating and storage for extra blankets, books, or shoes. These pieces can declutter your home while adding rustic charm to your interior.

**3. Go Vertical with Storage Solutions**

Maximizing vertical space is another smart way to make compact homes more functional. Install floating shelves or wall-mounted units to keep floor space clear while still providing ample storage. You can place decorative items like ceramic vases or indoor plants to bring personality into the room. Natural wood shelving also complements compact homes, adding warmth and a minimalist aesthetic.

**4. Choose Slimline Bar Chairs for Small Dining Areas**

If you live in an apartment or small house, creating a dining area can be tricky. Slimline bar stools or [bar chairs Dubai](https://www.homeandsouldubai.com/furniture/living-room-furniture/bar-stools) are ideal for small kitchens or dining nooks. If you're in Dubai, you’ll find a wide variety of chic bar chairs that can elevate your space. Opt for sleek, lightweight designs that don't take up too much room but still offer comfort. Pair them with a narrow bar table or kitchen island to create a functional dining area that doesn’t overcrowd your space.

**5. Foldable and Stackable Furniture**

For small homes, foldable or stackable furniture is a game-changer. Whether it’s folding chairs, stackable stools, or a dining table that can collapse when not in use, these pieces allow for flexibility in your layout. Stackable bar chairs can easily be stored away when not needed, while foldable furniture provides versatility when hosting guests.

**6. Incorporate Light Colors and Natural Textures**

Beyond just choosing the right furniture, the colors and materials you use can make a significant difference in how spacious your home feels. Light, neutral tones like whites, beiges, and light greys will reflect light and make your space feel bigger. Incorporating natural furniture made from wood, bamboo, or rattan not only enhances the aesthetic appeal but also adds texture and depth to your small space.",1,1728127995.0,u_homeandsoul,0,1.0,False

Understanding Room Classifications in Your Home,"Have you ever found yourself wondering if you could transform your living room into a cozy bedroom? Maybe you're living in a small apartment and need to maximize your space, or perhaps you're considering renting out a room in your house. 

Whatever the reason, the question ""Does a living room count as a bedroom?"" is more common than you might think. 

In this article, I'll dive deep into the world of room classifications, exploring the legal, practical, and creative aspects of this intriguing topic.

## **Defining Living Rooms and Bedrooms**

Before we can answer our main question, let's break down what exactly defines a living room and a bedroom. Understanding these distinctions is crucial in determining whether a living room can truly count as a bedroom.

### **What Makes a Living Room?**

A living room, also known as a sitting room or lounge, is typically the heart of a home. It's a space designed for relaxation, entertainment, and socializing. But what are its key features?

1. Open layout: Living rooms are usually more spacious and open than other rooms in the house.
2. Comfortable seating: You'll often find sofas, armchairs, and perhaps a coffee table.
3. Entertainment focus: Many living rooms have a TV or entertainment system.
4. Natural light: Large windows are common to create a bright, welcoming atmosphere.
5. Accessibility: Living rooms are often centrally located and easily accessible from other parts of the house.

### **Key Characteristics of a Bedroom**

Now, let's look at what defines a bedroom:

1. Privacy: Bedrooms are designed for personal use and typically have a door for privacy.
2. Sleeping accommodations: The primary purpose is for sleeping, so a bed or sleeping area is essential.
3. Storage: Most bedrooms include closets or wardrobes for clothing and personal items.
4. Windows: Bedrooms usually have at least one window for natural light and ventilation.
5. Electrical outlets: Building codes often require a minimum number of outlets in bedrooms.

As you can see, there are some fundamental differences between these two types of rooms. But does that mean a living room can never count as a bedroom? Let's dig deeper.

## **Legal and Building Code Considerations**

When it comes to room classifications, it's not just about how we use the space – there are legal and building code considerations to keep in mind.

### **Building Codes and Room Definitions**

Building codes vary by location, but they generally have specific requirements for what constitutes a bedroom. These may include:

- Minimum square footage (often around 70-80 square feet)
- Minimum ceiling height (usually 7 feet)
- At least one window meeting egress requirements for emergency exits
- A door that can be closed for privacy
- Heating and ventilation systems

Living rooms, on the other hand, don't typically have such strict requirements. They're considered common areas and are subject to different standards.

### **Local Zoning Laws and Regulations**

In addition to building codes, local zoning laws can affect how rooms are classified and used. Some areas have restrictions on the number of bedrooms allowed in a single-family home or require permits for converting spaces into bedrooms. It's crucial to check with your local zoning office before making any significant changes to your home's layout or use.

## **Factors That Distinguish Bedrooms from Living Rooms**

Now that we understand the basic definitions and legal considerations, let's explore the specific factors that set bedrooms apart from living rooms.

### **Privacy and Doors**

One of the most significant differences between a living room and a bedroom is privacy. Bedrooms are personal spaces, and as such, they typically have doors that can be closed. Living rooms, being common areas, are usually more open and may not have doors at all.

### **Windows and Egress Requirements**

While both living rooms and bedrooms often have windows, the requirements for bedrooms are more stringent. In most areas, bedrooms must have at least one window that can be used as an emergency exit (egress). This window needs to be a certain size and height from the floor to ensure safe escape in case of fire or other emergencies.

### **Closet Space**

Another key feature of most bedrooms is a closet or dedicated storage space. While not always a legal requirement, the presence of a closet is often considered standard for a room to be classified as a bedroom. Living rooms, on the other hand, don't typically include built-in closets.

### **Electrical Outlets and Lighting**

Building codes often specify a minimum number of electrical outlets for bedrooms, as well as lighting requirements. These standards ensure that the room can safely accommodate various electronics and provide adequate illumination. Living rooms may have different electrical requirements, often focused on supporting entertainment systems and ambient lighting.

## **Potential Scenarios for Living Room-Bedroom Conversions**

Despite the differences we've discussed, there are situations where a living room might serve as a bedroom. Let's explore some common scenarios.

### **Studio Apartments**

In studio apartments, the living area and sleeping area are often combined into one space. While technically not a separate bedroom, the entire studio essentially functions as both a living room and a bedroom.

### **Open Floor Plans**

Homes with open floor plans might have areas that serve multiple purposes. A section of a large, open living area could be designated as a sleeping space, blurring the lines between living room and bedroom.

### **Temporary Living Situations**

In some cases, such as when hosting guests or during home renovations, a living room might temporarily serve as a bedroom. While this doesn't change the room's official classification, it demonstrates the flexibility of our living spaces.

## **Implications of Room Classifications**

The way rooms are classified can have several important implications. Let's look at a few key areas where it matters whether a space is considered a living room or a bedroom.

### **Property Valuation**

The number of bedrooms in a home can significantly impact its value. Generally, homes with more bedrooms are valued higher than those with fewer bedrooms but larger living areas. This is why some homeowners might be tempted to classify a living room as a bedroom when selling their property.

### **Insurance Considerations**

Your home insurance policy may have different coverage levels for bedrooms versus common areas like living rooms. It's important to accurately report the number and type of rooms in your home to ensure proper coverage.

### **Rental and Lease Agreements**

When renting out a property, the number of bedrooms is a crucial factor. Advertising a living room as a bedroom could potentially lead to legal issues if it doesn't meet the legal requirements for a bedroom.

## **Pros and Cons of Using a Living Room as a Bedroom**

If you're considering using your living room as a bedroom, it's important to weigh the advantages and disadvantages.

### **Advantages**

1. Maximizes space in small homes
2. Provides flexibility for changing living situations
3. Can create a unique, open living environment
4. Potentially increases the functional bedroom count of your home

### **Disadvantages**

1. Lack of privacy compared to a traditional bedroom
2. May not meet legal requirements for a bedroom
3. Could decrease the value of your home if you lose a living room
4. Might make the space feel cramped or reduce entertaining areas

## **How to Legally Convert a Living Room into a Bedroom**

If you've decided that converting your living room into a bedroom is the right choice for you, here's how to do it legally and safely.

### **Obtaining Proper Permits**

Before making any significant changes, check with your local building department about necessary permits. You may need approval for structural changes, electrical work, or change of use.

### **Meeting Building Code Requirements**

Ensure your converted space meets all building code requirements for a bedroom. This might involve:
- Adding or enlarging windows for egress
- Installing a closet
- Ensuring proper electrical outlets and lighting
- Meeting minimum size requirements

### **Addressing Privacy Concerns**

Consider how to make the space more private. This could involve:
- Installing a door if there isn't one
- Using room dividers or curtains in open floor plans
- Adding soundproofing elements

## **Creative Solutions for Maximizing Living Spaces**

Whether or not you decide to fully convert your living room into a bedroom, there are many ways to maximize your living space.

### **Multifunctional Furniture**

Invest in furniture that serves multiple purposes, such as:
- Sofa beds or murphy beds
- Ottoman storage units
- Dining tables that convert to desks

### **Room Dividers and Partitions**

Use dividers to create separate areas within a large space:
- Folding screens
- Bookshelves as room dividers
- Curtain room dividers

### **Clever Storage Solutions**

Maximize storage to keep your space organized:

## **Conclusion**

So, does a living room count as a bedroom? The answer isn't always straightforward. While a living room can certainly function as a sleeping space, officially classifying it as a bedroom involves meeting specific legal and practical criteria. 

Ultimately, the decision to use a living room as a bedroom depends on your individual circumstances, local regulations, and personal preferences. Whether you're looking to maximize space in a small apartment, create a flexible living arrangement, or simply curious about home classifications, it's crucial to consider all aspects – legal, practical, and lifestyle-related.

Remember, your home should work for you. Whether that means maintaining traditional room classifications or getting creative with your space, the most important thing is that your living environment meets your needs and complies with local regulations.

## **Frequently Asked Questions**

1. **Can I legally rent out my living room as a bedroom?**
   While it's possible, you'll need to ensure the space meets all legal requirements for a bedroom in your area. This typically includes proper egress, privacy, and safety features. Always check local zoning laws and building codes before renting out any space.

2. **Will converting my living room to a bedroom affect my home's value?**
   It could potentially impact your home's value, either positively or negatively. While adding a bedroom can increase value, losing a living room might make the home less appealing to some buyers. Consult with a local real estate professional for specific advice.

3. **What's the minimum size for a room to be classified as a bedroom?**
   Minimum size requirements vary by location, but many areas require at least 70-80 square feet for a room to be classified as a bedroom. Some places also have minimum width requirements, often around 7 feet.

4. **Do I need a closet for a room to be considered a bedroom?**
   While many people consider a closet essential, it's not always a legal requirement. However, some areas do require a bedroom to have a closet or other dedicated storage space. Check your local building codes for specific requirements.

5. **Can I create a temporary bedroom in my living room without making permanent changes?**
   Yes, you can create a temporary sleeping area in a living room using solutions like room dividers, screens, or even strategically placed furniture. However, keep in mind that this doesn't change the room's official classification, and it may not be suitable for long-term use or rental purposes.",1,1728126792.0,HomeHacksHub,0,1.0,False

**Memory Transcription Subject: Tresta, Venlil, President of ‘Venlil for the Rehabilitation of Skalga’ Ecology Council** 

**Date \[Standardized human time\]: September 29th 2141**

“Conclusion of first interview.” I had stayed in the Jeep to organize my notes and record a few final thoughts on my pad. Boro had gone inside ahead of me by request, allowing me to put some personal observations down.

“Boro is both experienced and passionate about his work. His relationship with his hensa, Petal, is absolutely endearing. He took a moment to display some of her training when we arrived at the station, showing her recognition and understanding of non-verbal cues.” My ears flicked delightedly. It had been a treat to see Petal perform a few tricks, but far more interesting to me were several work related instructions given just from specific tail signals.

“I have seven days here in the colony. Two of them will be spent at the primary station, which also serves as a lab, in the capital of Azure, but I might want to spend an extra day here in Blue Hope. The chance to learn more about Hensa and their potential in the workforce could be a massive research boon in and of itself. The restoration project on Leirn is only now reaching its second generation, as far as I’m aware.” I pause, tapping my tail tip idly on the Jeep’s console in front of me. “I’ll need to get in contact with their government and see if I can get a paw in any of the research there.”

I paused for a longer moment this time as I considered the next section of notes. “Concerning the twins.” I took a breath to slow myself down and assist with transcribing the dictation later. “Boro’s opinion of the arxur pair is exceptionally high. He relayed quite a bit about his first impressions of the pair back on Earth, before going into his thoughts on the last year working with them here on Vishnu.” I laughed gently, tail swaying behind me. “He sounded less like a peer evaluating his subordinates, and more like a parent gushing about his kids. I think that, more than anything else, tells me a lot about this pair. I’m excited to finally meet them face to face.”

I pause the recording, saving the current audio log both to the backups on my holopad as well as the server back home. Once confirmed, I looked out of the windshield and saw Amanda waiting on the porch. Excellent. I can get a few words in with her before going inside!

**Memory Transcription Subject: Veltep, Venlil, A Volunteer For Wildlife Management \[Colony/Vishnu Ranger Service\]**

**Date \[Standardized human time\]: September 29th 2141**

I had to admit, Boro did an excellent job of dispelling the tense atmosphere that had formed. The twins spent a few minutes expressing their exasperation with the older yotul, much to his clear amusement. Even now that the twins had gotten up from the couch and scattered, his tail was still swinging with mirth as he admired the pictures he’d snapped.

I rolled my head to glance over towards the twins. At the moment they were in the far corner, by the little kitchenette, setting up the electric kettle and arranging several mugs of tea. Drej was still a little shaky, but had insisted she would be fine for Tresta’s visit. Nova was at her side, speaking softly while their tails gently brushed against each other. I flicked my ears to point at Boro, intent on giving them a bit more privacy. The older yotul returned the gesture, adding a questioning swivel to one ear.

“Somethin’ on your mind, kid?” He asked as he slipped the pad back onto his belt. I gave a slightly non-committal wave of my tail, ears splayed slightly as I searched for the right words. He grunted lightly, leaning against the arm of one of the chairs, tail still swaying with amusement. “Heh. You need some dating advice?” He asked, voice low to keep the twins from hearing.

My ears folded back against my head and my tail stiffened as I stifled a bleat. Heat rushed to my face as he covered his mouth with a paw, stifling his own laughter. With a nervous glance at the twins, making sure they were still occupied, I stepped in closer so we could talk even more softly.

He whispered, ear flicking in the twins’ direction. “Ya haven't exactly been subtle, and those two are practically my kids.” He let out breath, rubbing the back of his neck as he tilted his head so that one eye was on me, the other on the arxur. “Look. All three of you are adults.” His ear gave a twitch as the twins looked to be finishing the tea. He leaned in closer. “Not sayin it’ll be easy, but I *do* think it’ll be worth it.” He gave me a firm pat on the shoulder as his ears set into a neutral position, tail swaying once again as he stepped past. “Gonna check and see if Tresta is ready, or if she’s still interrogating Amanda out front. You best get yourself ready. She said she was particularly interested in talking to you.”

That sounded… much more ominous than it should have been. I had expected to be something of a focus for some of the questions. She was here to learn about the program after all. But the way Boro said that made it seem like there was more.

I decided to leave that field fallow for the moment and revisit it later. Nova and Drej had finished up with the tea, and were bringing all of the mugs over to the table. I hurried over to help, taking one from each of them. I gave an appreciative sign with my ears as I took an early sip to taste, tail swishing as I wondered what kind of questions Tresta had waiting just for me.

The door sounded as the trio undoubtedly were entering the lodge, gentle laughter drifting inside and bringing the twins’ attention as well as they focused towards where the entranceway was. Any minute now. Any second and I would come face to face with *Tresta*. And this time, she was here *for me*. The cup in my paws chittered as my claws shook against the glass.

“... Uh. You good?” Nova asked, his eyes focused on my shaking paws as he turned his focus to me. I took a breath, while both he and Drej returned to their seats on the couch.

“Yes. I’m just getting a bit nervous now.” I took a hasty sip of my tea to moisten my throat. “I mean, Tresta is kind of an important figure, politically speaking.” I paused to take another, longer, sip of the floral tea. “I wasn’t expecting to do a Q&A with someone like her only a \[week\] into the program.”

He gave an understanding nod, tail thumping lightly on the floor beside his foot. Both of the twins were cradling mugs of their own, breathing it in more than drinking it at the moment. I took notice of a distinctly venlil sized gap between them. They had been doing that a lot the last several paws. I don’t think they were even aware they’d started doing it.

Well. Nova seemed oblivious to it, but Drej was staring at me expectantly. My tail swayed with amusement before I stepped around and took the spot, just as the sounds from the front room rose up again.

The spring on the door creaked louder this time and I heard the new and distinct voice of our visitor. “-going to have to share that back home. It’s an angle no one really thought about having to approach, but it’s certainly an interesting thought to consider. I’d be eager to see how much traction it gets.” 

“I’m certain the reaction will be intense for certain, but hopefully it’ll be positive.” Amanda’s voice resonated, before the woman herself came around the open doorway and stepped aside.

Followed closely by Tresta. 

I couldn't help but whistle softly at the twins' reactions. Drej slowly blinked, entirely nonplussed at the sight of her, while Nova got caught mid sip and nearly spilled his tea all over himself. It was a pretty fair reaction if they had never actually seen her before.

The venlil woman was taller than me. I think she was a few tufts taller than Amanda even, seeing them side by side! The two of them kind of matched actually. I think they were around the same age and Tresta had that same slim, hard build. Lean muscle that you could see under her short white fur. The brown spots stood out, mostly on the thicker wool around her shoulders and head.

Boro came into the doorway, tail flicking behind him. “Jeep’s ready.” He said, breaking the spell that had fallen. 

Amanda nodded. “Alright. Tresta, we’ll talk more this evening. We’ve already made arrangements for you tonight and you should have both the information and access pass in the data packet from Azure. If you need anything else, it also has my number.”

The venlil gestured her understanding with her tail as well as tilted her head slightly. “Thank you. I’ll let you know once I’m settled. I hope we can continue our talk and maybe get a few official things down later if you’re free.” Amanda smiled as she agreed and, after both she and Boro waved goodbye, the pair left the station.

Turning her full attention back to us, Tresta waved her tail in greeting and both of the young arxur on either side of me came out of their momentary stupor. “Hello!” She walked in boldly, tail swaying as she moved in and took a seat across from us. “As I believe you all know, I’m Tresta, of ‘Venlil for the Rehabilitation for Skalga’, formerly with the ‘United States Forest Service’ on Terra.” She takes a moment to focus on each of us. “And you are Drejana, Novarra, and our volunteer in the middle would be Veltep, correct?” She said in turn as her tail gestured to each of us.

The twins nodded, not quite looking uncomfortable, but perhaps less prepared than they had hoped. Wanting to give them a moment more to recover, I scooted forward on the couch to keep Tresta’s attention. “That’s correct! It’s wonderful to meet you again.” Her ear flicked slightly in a querying motion. “Ahum, at the book signing from your first release.” I explained quickly.

She gestures her understanding with her tail as her ears perk up happily. “Ah! Well thank you, it’s heartening to know my work is inspiring people like you to take initiative and try things like this.”

My ears swivel slightly as I remembered the impassioned speech she gave during the book signing. I leaned forward as I beeped happily. “It really is, you know I had always been a bit curious about the subject but-” I paused as she swung her tail behind her, signaling for me to wait.

Tresta pulled a pad out of her bag. “Sorry, but that’s actually something I would like to get on the record, if you don’t mind?” I flicked my ears and nodded quickly. “Thank you. Something important for you to know.” She makes sure to focus on each of us again, before she continues. “This interview is more of a simple question and answer session. I’ll be recording our conversation unless anyone has an objection?” She asked, pausing long enough for all three of us to gesture our agreement. “Wonderful!” She beeped, sitting back in the chair.

“With that in mind…” She began recording, setting the pad on her lap. “Let’s start over. Veltep, you said you were at my book signing several cycles back, and were going to mention how it had an effect on your outlook? Could you elaborate on your initial opinions, and how they may have changed since then?”

I leaned back into the couch, chewing the thought I had been about to convey a moment ago. As I pressed further back, rather than settling into the cushions of the couch, I felt the all too familiar sensation of Nova and Drej behind me instead and ended up comfortably wedged between them. I felt my face warming through a moment of panic, looking across at Tresta. Thankfully, and very curiously, she wasn’t reacting, aside from just giving an amused sway of her tail.

“Um… uh, right.” I wriggled a little as I got more comfortable, ears flickering before I let my wool settle. “So, before reading your book, I had always been a bit curious about nature in general. I wouldn't say that I ever had any *serious* interest in ecology, as a whole, but I found most of what we knew to be… lacking.” That got an actual amused tilt of her ear from Tresta, but she otherwise stayed silent.

I gave a tiny whistle, emboldened to continue. “After the Humans made first contact, well, a lot of the flimsy science we had around anything related to the subject kind of came crashing down. I was looking for any kind of approachable information at the time and my exchange partner was all too eager to help. Then your book came out and it was…” I swiveled my ears, searching for the right words. “It really showed that there were more ways the Venlil could reclaim some of what we lost.”

Tresta typed a few notes, one ear swinging back and forth as she did. “Thank you. Again, it’s wonderful to hear that someone really took the purpose of my work to heart.” Her tail swayed in a satisfied manner. “But, perhaps that’s something we can discuss later. For now I’ll stay on task with the interviews.” She beeped pleasantly, making a last note.

“Let's start with some questions I had typed up in advance.” She bounced her pad playfully. “Tell me, Veltep, how did you first hear about this volunteer program?” She asked in excitement. I noticed Nova tilt his head at that. I supposed we never actually talked about how *I* got involved. We managed to keep getting… distracted.

“My husband, whom I want to mention is also my exchange partner,” that got another amused flick of her ears, “is more of an active environmentalist. He introduced me to a bunch of ideas and even took me to one of the national parks that was open for visitors when we went to Earth. He’s the one who found out about this program first and encouraged me to try it out.” 

The mention of the park got Tresta excited and she leaned forward happily as she let out a soft beep. “Oh! Which park, if I may ask?”  
  
“Cherokee, in Tennessee where he grew up.” My tail tried to sway at the pleasant memory, but mostly just thumped against the twins, making Nova smirk and Drej giggle quietly.

“Cherokee National *Forest*? Lovely. I'm fond of Cherokee, it has a lot of history. I spent some time out there in a lookout tower on top of Buffalo mountain."" Tresta seemed to reminisce as her paw tapped against her pad for a moment. ""Not many forests use fire towers anymore; the Forest Service has their own satellite network that can detect fires almost instantaneously, but they still have volunteer manned towers here and there. It's a great experience... until there's a thunderstorm, then it becomes a little less great and much more terrifying.” She whistled and flapped her ears. “I think that leads into the next question though. Since you had experience with Earth, what led to you deciding to come here, to a planet you were entirely unfamiliar with?”

I slowly turned the mug still held in my paws as I considered the question. “I think that was mostly my husband again. We talked it over quite a bit, not that I was reluctant or anything!” I added with a hasty beep. “More that it was going to be for such a long time and we had a lot to arrange before even considering the prospect.” I folded my ears against my head, picking at the words again. “This was a chance to look at things from the start. Humans have obviously been working on their planet's ecology their entire history. The good and the bad. But it’s *theirs*. The plants, the animals, the landscapes, all of it. Vishnu though…” My tail thumped again, making Drej giggle. “They’re only just beginning. Cataloging, studying, identifying. The plants haven’t been cultivated to suit anyone, the animals don’t have an instinctive aversion or attraction to any sapient. It’s a chance to see nature in its purest form.” 

I noticed Nova watching me from the corner of his eye, sipping from his mug. I did my best not to pay attention to the impressed look on his face, tilting my head so that my field of view took him *mostly* out of my vision. If only to keep myself from blooming brilliantly in front of Tresta. Especially since she was beaming at my answer, claws tapping away rapidly at her pad.

“Still, you were coming to a planet barely settled. Whether or not you ever had any experience with colonies before, this was going to be a completely different experience to what anyone growing up in the Federation would have considered normal.” I felt her attention shift from me to the twins for a moment, before returning. “How much information did you have, or get, about Vishnu prior to arriving?”

I felt both arxur flinch very slightly, though they maintained the calm and pleasant expressions they’ve been holding so far. My ears dipped slightly. I imagined that someone in Tresta’s position could have easily found out about how my first day went. That or Boro was more than happy to gossip about it. Speh. The question was legitimate though, so I approached it from an honest point of view.

“There was a little bit of information on the net. Nothing more than some general news coverage about the new colony being planned and a few articles once they broke ground.” I paused for a sip of my tea. “Once I put forth my application, I did get a bit of an information packet.” I let out a beep between amusement and exasperation. ”But if I’m honest, it reminded me more of a vacation pamphlet than anything.” She looked disgruntled by that, her ears dipping similarly to how mine had. “It discussed the unique plant life and the predominantly blue coloration they were attempting to study. It also mentioned the ‘wild’ environment. It felt like it was arguing with itself honestly, like some scared official on Skalga and an enthusiastic Terran were going back and forth, trying to both sell the reader on the point *and* warn applicants to be wary.” I laughed, remembering how Lucius and I ended up in a giggling fit about how silly it was.

Tresta sighed, a slight whistle of humor mixed with exasperation. “Well, that’s not exactly ideal. Probably why so many pulled out after applying.” She tapped her claw on her pad as she made a note. “That’s definitely something that will need to be addressed in an official capacity. Along with transparency.” Her tail flicked, the single motion between Drej and Nova made it clear what the concern was. The twins quickly picked up on the scrutiny, if the sudden awkward tension pouring off of them was an indication. I decided to add a little more.

“Once I got in touch with Amanda, she gave me a lot more useful information. Pictures of landscapes, particular plants that were being studied, and even some of the wildlife that they had cataloged so far. It was enthralling.” I laughed again. “Lucius was trying to convince me to smuggle one of those… Oh, what are they? When we saw the pictures he said they looked like a ‘possum and a fox got drunk one weekend?’”

Tresta looked politely curious even as Nova let out a snort, nearly choking on his tea. The other venlil didn't even twitch, aside from her ears swiveling to focus on the gasping ranger beside me. “Fu- Ahem! Sorry. Wasn’t expecting that particular description.” He got up, moving around the couch to the counter in the corner and snatching several paper napkins out of a holder before patting his snout dry. He managed not to actually get any on his shirt at least. His tail flicked at Drej.

She giggled and shifted on the couch, leaning rather openly into me. Well. More like on me, as she squirmed a little to wiggle her own pad out of her back pocket. I grumbled as she winked down at me, hidden from Tresta and confirming that she was doing this entirely on purpose. “Here, I think we know what you’re talking about.” She says aloud, flicking over her pad and pulling up a photo gallery, before quickly turning it out of my line of sight, a tinge of pink running along her snout.

Interesting.   
  
She scrolled for a moment, before smiling, her tail tip lightly tapping on the floor as she turned the screen to us. “Yep. That’s the one I was talking about.” My tail brushed over her back and I got to watch the girl's cheeks turn a much more vibrant pink before she turned her head, making a show of putting her pad away.

Tresta watched, smirking at me as the tip of her tail twirled in little circles. “Cute.” She was definitely *not* talking about the photo. “Have they been classified yet? Any name?” She asked more professionally, focusing her attention between Drej, as well as Nova as he came back over and sat on my other side once more.

Nova cleared his throat and tilted his head down, keeping his muzzle toward the floor. “They’ve been trying to not put anything official down on too many things just yet, but the name we’ve been working with is Vulphidae.” He answered, keeping his voice low and soft, much like when we first met. I flipped my tail over to stroke down his back, trying to encourage him.

Tresta made another note. “I think I’ll want to ask you about them, along with the current project you’ve been assigned to. But that can wait for later.” She taps her claw on the edge of her pad. “Returning to the subject.” She whistles and turns her eye back to me. “Coming to a new planet and a program like this, I imagine it’s been an adjustment in several ways. Have there been any drastic changes for you in daily life, Veltep? And, if so, how have you adapted?”

Oh. That was an interesting one. My ears flap a bit as I let that one grow for a moment. “Overall, I think adapting has gone very well. I’m not exactly unused to being on a different planet. The day night cycle is more of a novelty than a detriment, and I enjoy the way the world around us changes along with it. There are entirely different things to experience between the day and night.” 

We both flick an ear as Drej titters, bringing a hand up to her muzzle and trying to muffle it. I feel a slight bloom in my ears as Tresta smirks again. While I am entirely glad that she’s doing better after earlier, it would be nice if Drej could *control herself right now!*

“There were a few… interesting bumps when it came to settling in-” Now Nova grunted, hiding in his mug again. Speh! The pair of them! “Everyone here has been great. If the other volunteers have a team half as good at this one, then I imagine the actual work portion of this program is going to be seen as a rousing success. Honestly, even with the more physically demanding aspects,” I preemptively swatted Drej with my tail, making her giggle. “The support I’ve gotten from everyone has made the whole experience *almost* easier than it is back home, running my own business and managing my husband.” I whistle out a laugh, joined in turn from Tresta.

“Excellent! I'm glad it’s been going so well for you. Speaking of physically demanding, I wanted to broach that as well. What do you think has been the hardest circumstance you’ve had to overcome since you’ve been here?” She asks, swiping on her pad before beginning to type again.

This one came easier as I let out a low whistle. “Adjusting to the people I’m working with.” I answered immediately. I didn’t give the twins a chance to react before I continued. “Thomas especially. He’s nice and all, but the one time I worked with the man he managed to forget the sensors we were supposed to be installing. After a full claw of travel!” Nova groaned, and Drej let out a full laugh, tossing her head back, the gravely joy making her body bounce lightly beside me. Tresta seemed to find both the answer and reactions amusing too, her tail twisting behind in tight circles.

My own tail wiggled back and forth at the tip, doing my best not to swat either arxur accidentally. “But physically, I do find myself a little frustrated at times. I lack the foundational knowledge everyone else does, which I can’t help but assume helps out a lot with keeping up physically. Just knowing how to walk through a forest makes a lot of difference I've learned.” Tresta’s ear perked at that and she made a quick note. “Then the overall difference in physique is constantly apparent. I’m not exactly out of shape, but there's an entirely different demand on the body with this kind of work.” She made an understanding gesture, while typing. “I just continue to put my best paw forward and pitch in as much as I can.”

“Admirable. It’s all hard work and I’m pleased to hear that you’re embracing it.” I flushed a little at the compliment, hiding behind the mug as I sip at the tea. “Do you think that volunteering here, to work in an essentially untamed area, has changed your outlook? For better or otherwise?” Tresta posed her next question to me, and I took another sip from my tea while I rolled that one around for a bit. 

I let the mug rest in my lap as I cradled it, the warmth seeping into my paw pads. “I don’t think it’s changed my outlook necessarily. If anything I’d say it’s been more like a confirmation. Being a venlil who, for the longest time, had an interest in ‘more predatory things,’ getting to see and interact with the wildlife here has been extremely gratifying. It could just be that old curiosity talking, but even the real eye opening stuff has just felt more like things finally setting into place, than it has upended my whole view on things.” I flicked an ear at each twin. “For the most part anyway.”

That got a chuff of laughter from each of them, and Tresta too. She checked over her notes up till now, looking satisfied. “Alright. I have one more for you personally, Veltep. Then I have some more in depth professional questions for Novarra and Drejana.” They both nodded, and I flicked an acceptance in response.

“Great! This one’s more of an opinion piece.” She prefaced, ears focused on me entirely now and she tilted her head so her dominant eye was on me. “After everything you’ve done up to this point, do you feel that other Venlil back home would would benefit from participating in this kind of program, and gaining the same experiences that you have?”

I let out a soft whistle, quickly understanding the importance she had placed on this question. With her council work back on Skalga, a good opinion would be worth a lot if published.

“I think this kind of journey would help our people get a wider and more educated grasp on how nature and what we consider to be ‘the wild,’ actually works. We’ve spent our entire lives in heavily maintained ‘parks,’ taught to fear the treelines in our own backyards. Once you actually get out there, and experience it with people that really know what they are doing, it’s not that scary. It’s still an experience that demands respect, but I honestly believe it would benefit anyone willing to make the effort, if only to get out of their routine and learn something new.”

Tresta was beaming again, tail swaying happily behind her. “Thank you again, Veltep. That was excellent.” She made another note. “I’ve got a few more things I would like to discuss. Some professional questions like I mentioned, but afterwards I think I’d like to speak with you personally for a bit.” She said, indicating me with her ears as she tapped the recording off.

“Oh! Would that also be for the book?” I asked, exceptionally nervous about what kind of personal questions she might have

She signaled a negative and beeped softly as she signaled calmingly. “No, completely off the record. Just a bit of a personal curiosity.”

“Sure, I’d love to!” I beeped, still slightly nervous, but more excited for the chance to sit down and ask a few questions of my own.

Tresta swung her tail around, looking pleased at my agreement. “Perfect. Now, I don’t want to run too long, I was told that you two still have some work that needs to be done around that new project you have.” She jumped back in, her attention shifting to the twins.

Nova nodded, setting his now empty mug down on the table and settling a little deeper into the couch. He looked almost relaxed. “That’s correct. Just a few field reports that need to be signed and proofread, but we’d rather not fall behind.” 

Drej rumbled an agreement as she leaned forward. “I still need to finish that social media thing too, but we should be able to get things sorted quickly and stay on schedule. Wouldn't want to be late for our evening plans, would we?” She purred, a bright blue eye flicking down to me again before returning to Tresta.

There was a start of a chuckle before Tresta cleared her throat to cover it up. “Then with that in mind, let me start with something that I've been working on. This book is going to help me push something of a grassroots project I've been planting for a while now.

He rumbled, low in his throat while idly scratching his chin with a claw. “You want to organize something much more in depth and official than what this program is doing it sounds like. And you want us to give it a bit of a dry run?” He questioned, tail twitching on the floor.

Tresta laughed with a clear voice, her tail twirling excitedly. “Precisely.”

He is always hot headed. Earlier in our relationship he was always arguing with me over little things that could just be solve by a simple conversation. It didn’t help that he always shout when he argues and if it’s over text he will always talk to me in a hurtful way. I don’t know but he always talks in a way that is confusing but then gets mad if I didn’t get him.


I texted him prior if I could ride with him when he goes to the gym since I was in the coffee shop at that time and he lives near the area and I live near the gym he goes to. He did not respond I assumed he was still sleeping so I texted him that I will be going home instead since I also want to go number 2 badly at that time.

This is what he texted me word per word.

“Buds (our call sign), JWU”
“The coach called me”
“Shit, I just woke up”
“Sorry”

So idk about you guys but I assumed he was still at home base on his chat. So I asked him if he could drop the money he owe me by the house. Which he responded that he is now at the gym. So I sad “Oh okay”. I told him that I am planning to order food from this chicken place which was different from the plans we made earlier which was to order bbq. But I want to sleep and I wanna eat before I sleep. I don’t have enough extra money on me, so I told him to just send me the money “Later”. I will just use the money from my savings. Which I don’y want to touch because I’m saving it for other things. He got mad that I was pressuring him that I am always making him hurry that I’m stupid that I did not understand that he was in the gym when he text the words above. He’s angry that I wanted to eat chicken instead of bbq. That I change my mind so often. I don’t know where I went wrong. I did not intentionally try to rush him or anything. I told him send me the money later instead of giving me cash. He said I should’ve known that he will be going to my place later. In my defense our time doesn’t always meet. I usually work night shift so I try to sleep at around 4 or 5 pm. He is going to finish gym at 7pm.

For the past few years I have been brewing coffee at home using my beloved Aeropress with a Prismo attachment including a paper filter.

It has worked wonders for me and the coffee brewed has been delicious.

Recently the Baristina has peaked my interest. On paper it does what my Aeropress is doing, pulling a single delicious shot, although fully automatic. I like that you can use your own beans, has some manual work and that it is easy to clean.

However, I am unsure if the taste of the shot is on par with that of the Aeropress. As the product is supposed to be the next step for capsule users.

Has anyone done a similar switch or could talk about it the taste that their Baristina shots are tasting?

I am not interested in a full automatic machine with milk attachment as it's too far away from how I like to brew.

I know the dial is continuous but currently anywhere between 2 and 0.5 seems to have a decently dry puck at the end, '-0.5' is choking. Using the Normcore v4 with the hardest spring.

I've done the coin test for headroom and think that's ok. 
It's rare that there's water on top of the puck when i take it off, or that the puck sticks to the machine. 
It doesn’t matter how fresh the beans are.

I never want to live with a man again. ,"I just need to rant a bit….. for context, I’m 26F and him 35M. We’ve lived together for just over a year now… i know some of you will say that this is somewhat my fault, and I should have clear boundaries - which I agree with, if I had spoken up earlier and felt I had a voice sooner, it’s very possible that I wouldn’t be annoyed daily like this. However I think a lot of women will be in the same boat as me, I didn’t want to “rock the boat”. 

So in the time we’ve lived together, he has cleaned the apartment three times… he has this habit of never putting the toilet paper tube in the garbage when it’s done… it stays until I throw it away. There’s currently three in our bathroom as I type this. Continuing with the bathroom theme, we use wet wipes + toilet paper. Every single day, I walk into the bathroom and the wet wipes are opened. So I have to close them, because they’ll dry out if I leave them. He has also gotten into the habit of using my soaps and face wash instead of his own and will finish them, he has no shame lol. Leaving the bathroom, he uses my nice laundry detergents instead of his 2€ one that he buys… it came to a point where I decided I will keep it in my room because I’m so sick of it. He will serve himself to all my spices, and even my food. There’s been multiple times where he has started and finished my milk/eggs. In the morning I’ll open the fridge to get my milk for a coffee and it’s empty. I’m so sick of this. Again, I do fully acknowledge my role in all of this, as I could say something/do something to stop this behaviour. I am just very nervous to do so, as he is the ex of my friend and I feel as though I can’t speak freely in fear of “upsetting” someone. Which I know… is stupid. I just needed to rant because it’s such an annoying feeling to constantly feel taken advantage of. I plan on moving back to my home country before the start of the new year so I am hanging in there for the last few months. However, never again will I ever live with another man… it’s honestly either weaponised incompetence or just plain stupidity. I’m not sure which, but men sure do know how to annoy me.

I don’t have much coffee to play around with, so any pointers to bring out the best of it would be appreciated.

What I tried so far is 20g ZP6 at 4.0, ratio 1:15 with a 1 bloom+ 3 pour v60 recipe water 94*C. It stalled and reached nearly 4 minutes, but the overall brew had so many off notes and aftertaste that I thought less clarity and less extraction overall would help.

Tried it again with k-max at 7.0, 1:15, 1 bloom + 2 pours, water 90*C. It worked out at 3 minutes total.

Still, I get mainly an overpowering bitter chemical-like taste and after taste.

I am thinking of treating it like a dark roast where I go as low as 85*C and aim for 2-2:30 brew time, but if anyone tried it already and has any pointers on what to do I appreciate it. ",3,1728123874.0,pourover,4,0.67,False

**Memory transcription subject: Lerai, Venlil Trainee**

*Date \[standardized human time\]: December 1st, 2136.*

++++++++++

  

“That’s it! Small and compact!”

*\*Bam! Pow! Wham!\**

The sounds of the mitts rang out across the gym as I followed Vince around the ring, each and every strike pushing me forward. Each and every time I did mitt or grapple training, I never wanted it to end. I’d want to strike and fight until my body couldn’t move another inch, and then push myself further still, fueled only by the flame in my core.

*Damn it, why does Predator Disease have to feel so GOOD…?*

A couple paws ago, he and the Chief had taken to helping me mix punches and kicks together. They would hold the mitts sideways, and I’d have to slam my leg into them. Right on cue, Vince held a target about shoulder-level. “Alright, roundhouse, up high!”

Swinging my tail for extra momentum, my foot sailed towards its target.

*\*WHAM!\**

“Alright, time! Take a break.”

“Th-thanks…” I panted. Once my attacks had stopped and heat started to die down, exhaustion would crash into me like a freighterr. I stumbled to the ropes and slumped forward against them, hanging by my shoulders.

“You were in good form today,” Vince said from next to me, leaning against one of the posts.

“Well, I… I am in a good mood, I guess…” I panted. “I made a herdmate this paw, I’m going out with his own herd for drinks after this.”

“Ah, shit, really? Oh, I see how it is. So you don’t need your old pal Vince anymore, do ya?” he said in a higher tone than usual.

My ears pinned back in fear. “Uhhhhhh…”

He sauntered over and, in a swift motion that belied his size, wrapped my head in one arm and began roughly twisting his other fist on my head. “Well look at little miss popular over here!” he exclaimed brightly while I struggled in his grip. “What was that shit about not having any friends?”

“Baahk! Ghk! Stop!” I complained, though I couldn’t help my tail wagging. The predators were rough, but I knew it was their way of expressing friendliness. At least, I thought so. Maybe mine were just weird.

He eventually let me pull myself away, and I rubbed the spot on my head that he’d so ruthlessly assaulted. “Alright, well, I’m prolly not walkin’ with you then, so you better work hard today in case you get stopped by a pyro,” Vince said.

“...I mean, I’d invite you to come along, but…” 

“Yeah, yeah, I know. Can’t bring the *vicious predator* anywhere without advance warning,” Vince waved me off, though he looked off to the side as he said it. “Fuck. I was just messing with you, but now I wanna hit something.”

“Could it not be *me* this paw, please? I want to look presentable for these people.” *Plus, your punches are INSANE. I’m lucky if I block one or two out of ten, and it just makes my paws hurt.*

“Alright, alright.” He sighed in frustration. “Man, I gotta get out there more. I’ve seen the town when I go on runs and stuff, but I’ve never like… stopped at any shops or anything.”

I flipped around, leaning on my back against the ropes. I was starting to feel a little better already, my face a bit less orange. “Well, there are some shops open for Humans now. I only know one off the tip of my tail, but…”

“Yeah, the coffee stand? Rika told me about it. And it’s *nice,* and all, but like…” Vince scratched the side of his head. “I dunno which shops actually don’t give a shit about my eyes, and which ones are just doing it for the creds and’ll call the pyros on me if I sneeze, y’know?”

“Hmm…” *Being a Human is rough.* “I guess I don’t really have to think about things like that, but… that’s unfair. I hope it blows over soon. I think more places are starting to open up for real.” I whistled a bit. “Who knows? Maybe we’ll get some other species here at the gym some paw?”

Vince exhaled sharply through his nose. “Yeah, that’d be cool. I know it’s just a waiting game, really. But still, it’s frustrating.”

“...I’m sorry.”

“Thanks.”

We hung in silence for a moment. The flame was burning at a simmer, idle but ready for action. I was trying to work out exactly what made it tick, but I wasn’t having much luck. It just… liked violence. But it seemed like it didn’t crave pain or blood, it was just sort of encouraging. Which was *good…* I was no expert on Predator Disease, but it meant that mine was probably pretty minor. Still, I didn’t want to take chances.

“Hey Vince…” I began. “Can I ask a weird question?”

“How’s that different from usual?” He replied with a smirk.

“Oh, hush,” I squeaked a giggle. “But seriously. Is it… is it weird for me to enjoy this?”

Vince looked at me confusedly. “Enjoy what?”

“This whole…” I circled a paw in the air. “Learning to fight thing.”

“Uh, I mean… I don’t think so, but why are you asking *now?*”

“Well…” I paused. Would Vince understand? He was a predator… what if he felt like this *all the time?*

*Well, then again… I’ve seen their evidence of empathy over and over. Even if they don’t have the concept of Predator Disease… maybe they have something similar? I suppose there’s no harm in asking, at least…* “Okay, I don’t know if what I’m gonna say will make *any* sense, so just… bear with me. And don’t judge, please?”

“Ah, shit, it’s a *real* question, huh? Alright, well I ain’t no therapist, but I’ll hear you out. What’s up?”

*What’s a therapist?* I shook my head. Questions for later, and I needed information *now.*

“So… whenever I spar, or train, or just… when I push myself during workouts now…” I began, my ears and tail flicking as I tried to find the words to describe the sensation. “I feel this… *yearning.* I don’t know how else to describe it, but… whenever I practice, it just feels so *right.* Like it’s some base need, on the same level as eating or sleeping.”

“Huh…” Vince muttered. “I kinda know what you’re talkin’ about.”

My ears raised. “You do?”

“Yeah. I felt like that every time I stepped into the pro ring,” Vince said with a big smile. “Feels good, don’t it?”

“I… yes, but that’s just *more* worrying,” I replied. “Vince, I’m not *supposed* to feel like this. Violence just… isn’t part of Venlil. Of *any* prey, for that matter.”

“Says who? Last I checked it was a whole bunch of violent prey that glassed my city.”

“S-Says…” I guess I couldn’t really argue against that. But those were Krakotl, who were already known to be among the most naturally aggressive prey species. Venlil were, well… *not that.* “I don’t know, says society, I guess?”

“So what?”

“S-So what…?” It *really* didn’t feel that simple to me. “Vince, these are the kinds of thoughts that would justifiably get me arrested, and now I’m hearing that an actual predator felt the same way when he was about to fight someone for his *job.*”

“What, you worried you got some kinda mental illness?”

I paused. “Mental illness?” *I had this same conversation at work… so Humans think the same as the Yotul? That there’s more than one kind of Predator Disease?* “I guess…?”

“Well, I mean… I ain’t no expert, and you’re like, an alien with different thoughts and stuff, but do you feel like you wanna punch some random dude on the street?”

My ears pinned back. “N-no, not at all!”

“Do you feel angry when you practice? Like you’re working out frustration? Cuz *lord* knows I know that feeling.”

“W-well… I don’t think so. It’s more… encouraging?”

“Yep, definitely know what you’re talking about. Felt it all the time as a pro. You’re fine,” Vince said simply. Though before I could interject, he continued unprompted. “Look, I’ve always been a certified fuckup. I was a dumbass in school, and I wasn’t much better as an adult. Got into fights for the dumbest reasons, and caused my Ma a whole hell of a lotta worry. No one thought I’d ever amount to *shit,* myself included.”

He smiled wistfully, staring at something I couldn’t see. “But then I started boxing. Learned *discipline.* And every time I got in that ring, and I saw the lights, and the people cheerin’ for me… I’d get that same feeling you’re talkin’ about. It pushed me forward, it made my fists heavier, and it got my ass up when I fell. So I could prove that even a fuckup like me was worth somethin’.”

I stared at him with one eye. *Such a different kind of life…*

He shook his head. “But, well, it don’t matter now. Gonna be a while before I can go back to Earth. But, hey. Just keep up the hard work, learn that discipline, and you’ll be fine. Who knows? Maybe you could go pro someday?”

“I’mmm… not sure I’d want that, honestly,” I nervously laughed. “Don’t get me wrong, I like being here. I’m just… confused, I guess.”

“Well, y’know what always helps me when I’m confused?” Vince said with a grin, pushing himself off the post.

I stared at him unimpressed, ears flat. “Are you going to say ‘punching?’”

“Hell yeah I am!”

I sighed. “...You know what, that sounds good,” I said, as I followed him to the center of the ring.

  

++++++++++

  

I wandered down the busy street, eyes scanning the various businesses. As I walked, I’d frequently bump into other Venlil or fellow prey, or my tail would brush against someone. “Where is this place…?” I muttered to myself.

I was in a small restaurant district not too far from the park. I was already running a bit late, and didn’t want to show up panting and exhausted, so I’d just taken the subway this paw and rested during the ride.

I couldn’t help but feel a little nervous, though. Since I was alone this time, I didn’t have the protection of numbers or refugee law by proxy if I were stopped. I hadn’t run into any trouble, but…

Suddenly, in the corner of my eye, I spotted my target. A business softly lit by electric lamps and the natural dusk, the sounds of chatter and festivities emanating from inside. A wooden sign displayed prominently above the entrance read “Eorna’s & Seagal’s” in Venlang, with a smaller addition underneath that said “Now accepting Humans!” Though, oddly enough, the addition was only written in our tougue as well, not any blocky Human script.

*This is it…* I swallowed. Now that I was here, I suddenly found myself rooted in place. *W-What if they don’t like me? What if Vyrlo’s herdmates hear about the Predator Disease and they aren’t as accepting? What if we’re too different because they’re so new to the galactic scene? What if–*

I shook my head. *No, I can do this. Don’t think, just do.* Slowly and nervously, I walked up to the door and gently pushed it open, a bell hanging just above the door jingling to announce my arrival.

It was much busier inside than out, with patrons relaxing at nearly every table. But the atmosphere inside was surprisingly cozy, with wood flooring and more soft electric lamp lighting. Despite the sign outside, I didn’t see any Humans… just regular prey species. A tall Fissan manned the bar itself, fixing drinks while a Nevok brought them around to tables. *Aren’t they normally rivals? What’s* that *story?*

“Lerai! Over here!”

My ears swiveled to the source of the noise, and I saw a waving Vyrlo and two other Yotul at a booth near the back. The nervousness was suppressed by a blooming excitement, and I made my way over.

“Sorry I’m late!” I said as I slid into the booth and slotted my tail into the open space between the backrest and seat, sitting next to one of the two unknown Yotul. Their fur was a dark umber. “Were you waiting long?”

“No, you’re fine, we haven’t even ordered yet,” said the other red-furred stranger, diagonally across from me. He flicked an ear in greeting. “Lerai, right? Good to meet you. I’m Karpo, and that’s Parla.”

“Hey,” the Yotul next to me – Parla – greeted simply with a flick of her own ear.

“I’m happy you could make it,” Vyrlo said. “What’ll you have?”

“Umm…” *I don’t want to get* too *drunk… but my usual should be fine.* “Let me get a sweet stinger.”

Vyrlo flicked an ear in acknowledgement, and raised a paw towards the Nevok. “Seagal! Pardon me. Two nillecs on ice, one sweet stinger, and, er… I’ll have a licha cider.”

“You got it!”

It wasn’t long before the drinks were brought out, and soon we were all chatting and laughing and sharing stories. I bloomed in embarrassment as Vyrlo recounted my misfortune with the sprinkler pipe at work earlier this paw, but I found myself whistling anyway. It *had* been pretty funny in hindsight, and I’d cleaned myself up afterwards at the main building well enough.

I also learned a bit about Karpo and Parla – Karpo was a starship engineer that worked as maintenance on a passenger liner, and was frequently out of town for extended periods. The Yotul typically tried to plan their outings around his availability. Parla, meanwhile, was a legal aide for a local attorney, and she was studying to become a full-fledged lawyer.

“So I have to ask…” Vyrlo began, the tips of his ears starting to turn a touch green. “What *is* this garment you’ve been wearing for nearly a full solar pass now? I recall you said it’s a Human design?”

“Uhh…” After my experience revealing my hoodie’s origins when Naartis had asked about it, I was admittedly hesitant to talk about it openly. “It was just a gift…”

Though his words actually gave me a moment of pause. *Wow, has it really almost been a whole pass…?* A solar pass was the five arm, twenty-five paw long path the sun took in the sky. Once the sun made a complete rotation in its path caused by Venlil Prime’s wobble, and *passed* a certain point that varied from region to region, it’d mark the passing of, well… a pass.

Karpo took a sip of his nillec – a Venlil Prime spirit made from climbgrass grains. “A Human design?” he wondered, head tilting. “Are you involved with them?”

“W-Well, I, um…” I think Vyrlo was fine, but I didn’t know Karpo or Parla’s opinions on Humans, but I wanted them to like me. What should I say?

*Stars, who am I kidding, I’m terrible at lying on short notice…* “Y-Yes. I’ve, uh, made herdmates with a few of them.”

The three Yotul just looked at me silently for a moment, and I felt my stomach twist in a knot. *Oh, brahk, this is the part where I get tossed out of the herd for being too different–*

“Huh,” Parla muttered, taking a sip of her nillec. “Good stuff.”

My ears raised. “Huh? O-Oh, you mean your drink–”

“Nope. I mean you. Most Venlil run, and you didn’t. That’s brave. I’m… still pretty nervous around Humans.”

“W-Wait… you think so?

“I think most Yotul are at least indifferent to Humans, though I think younger ones are starting to fall for the Federation’s nonsense,” Karpo answered, with a teasing ear-flick towards Parla, who simply snorted. “I haven’t met many Humans myself, just due to the nature of my work, but honestly? Any species that doesn’t default to calling us *primitives* is cool in my book.”

I let out a sigh of relief I didn’t know I’d been holding, leaning back in the seat. “Oh, thank the Stars… most people hear the *cursed words* and turn tail. I feel like I’m walking on slipmoss all the time…”

“Well, Human sympathies are definitely on the rise with recent events, though there are still a lot of holdouts,” Vyrlo said. “I suspect that soon you may not need to hide your involvement so much. Honestly, I find your willingness to associate with them to be admirable.”

I couldn’t help but feel my face bloom a little. “Th-thanks…” I muttered, curling into myself.

“Just out of curiosity, what’s the story?” Karpo asked. “You an exchange program veteran? They opened up one of those on Leirn, I heard.”

“Well…” I paused, trying to push aside the embarrassment. *If they’re alright with Humans… it’s probably okay to tell them.* So I shared the same story I’d told Dad and Sis – how I’d been saved from exterminator harassment by a good-natured passing stranger, and subsequently started attending a Human-led gym. Of course, I left out the *predatory* aspects.

“Wait, so you started a whole *predator workout regiment?*” Vyrlo asked, his features full of astonishment. “That’s incredible! I’d noticed you were having less trouble with the labor at the park, but that’s… No offense, but how are you alive?”

My ears lowered. “Vyrlo, they’re not gonna eat me–”

“No, no, I’m sorry, I misspoke. I know that. I meant that I’d imagine any exercise routine designed for such a physically hardy species to be utterly grueling.”

“Ah,” I squeaked a giggle. “You don’t know the *half* of it. Honestly, I don’t think I’ve worked so hard on anything in my entire life… But they’ve been patient with me.”

“I respect the dedication,” Parla said. “Been trying to start working out myself. Never stick with it, though. Usually make it like, a week.”

“Well, I mean… it’s been hard, yeah,” I admitted. I took another sip of my drink and found that I had emptied the glass, but I still felt fine. “I was kinda desperate at first, since I get bothered by exterminators a lot. But now I keep it up because it’s fun.”

“You get bothered by exterminators? Why?” Karpo asked, his features full of concern. Not *at* me, but *for* me.

I still hesitated. “It’s… kinda personal, sorry.”

“Nah, no worries. I can relate, though. Y’know, the whole ‘primitive’ thing,” Karpo sighed. He took a long pull of his drink, and soon his own glass was empty as well. “I was scheduled for a round-trip to Colia, and some dungweed demanded to talk to my boss because they felt *unsafe* that a *primitive* was fixing the ship. You know what I was working on? The damn thermostat.”

My ears pinned back. “That’s terrible.”

“It’s the norm for us,” Parla interjected. “I get comments all the time. From exterminators and random civilians. Worst are the ones who act all amazed. ‘Oh, wow, you’re studying law? It’s great someone like you is trying to learn such a complicated subject.’” Her voice took on a different tone as she practically spat the words, staring into her drink. She took a long pull, and the glass met the table a bit too hard, spilling some liquor over onto the table.

“I’ve got a degree in agricultural engineering…” Vyrlo muttered. “Yet no lab would take me. Every place I applied always said they’d found *someone with better qualifications.* But I know they just don’t think a Yotul is cut out for the job.” He leaned an elbow on the table, his head in a paw. “Is it awful that I almost wanted them to say something like ‘working in the soil would be a perfect fit for you?’ I’ll hear it from Naartis sometimes, but if I were hearing it in a lab I’d at least be getting paid what I’m truly worth.”

“I…” I didn’t really know what to say in response. It seemed that the Yotul and Humans had a lot in common. “I’m… sorry that happens to you all...”

We all sat silently and awkwardly, staring at the table. The chatter continued around us.

“...These guys behind us are *loud,*” Parla said quietly, her ears flat. There was a large wooden board hanging from the ceiling acting as a physical privacy barrier between each booth, though it wasn’t enough to completely block the sound of the rowdy individuals one booth over. One of them sounded completely sloshed, and was loudly arguing about something, his herdmates often agreeing. I thought I heard something about predators…?

“Aww, *damn it,*” Karpo barked. “This isn’t supposed to be some pity party! We’re here to have a good time, yeah? Come on, let’s forget all that for now.”

He waved a paw, shouting to the Nevok. “Yo, Seagal! Another round!”

“Coming right up!”

One glass later, and the Yotul were definitely looking a bit tipsy. I myself was feeling a light buzz… sweet stingers were my favorite, a basic cocktail consisting of a spirit called rymek made from snowsprout grains, along with some stingfruit juice and sugar, but rymek was strong stuff. And even Venlil livers have their limits.

“...right, so then I have to explain to this man, who I have to remind you is the *captain of the ship…* that both he and the entire crew had somehow forgotten to spool up the jump drive.” Karpo yipped in laughter. We all laughed along with him, the alcohol loosening our inhibitions. “I swear, the dude looked like he wanted to die of embarrassment right there.”

“How the brahk do they forget *that?!”* I bleated.

“I don’t know! He sure as Din wasn’t gonna explain himself to me, and I don’t exactly blame him!”

Our laughter continued. I felt… warm, and happy. And not just because of the buzz. I hadn’t gotten to do something like this in so long. Just be with herdmates, go somewhere and have a good time. I still wanted to take my Human friends somewhere…

But as my chuckles began to wilter… I noticed something also felt *off.* While I felt warm, the room itself suddenly felt colder. It had gone quiet. Next to me, Parla was looking around confusedly, and Vyrlo and Karpo were staring at something behind me. The privacy barrier was blocking my view of the entrance, so I couldn’t see whatever they were staring at.

“What’s going on?” I asked, as I leaned out to peek. And it became immediately obvious what the problem was.

“What is it?” asked Parla.

“Human.”

“...Oh,” she muttered nervously.

*Everyone* was watching the Human, who despite being physically taller, seemed a fair bit smaller than the Farsul who had come in with them.

In the dead quiet, I could hear them speak quietly from behind their mask. “Look, see, I told you this would happen.”

“Please, it’s fine,” soothed the Farsul, before turning to the Fissan at the bar. “Excuse me! You accept Human business, right?”

The Fissan – presumably Eorna, if the sign outside was to be believed – shook their mane, stomping at the ground in agitation. “...I-I admit… I-I didn’t think any of your kind w-would actually take the offer. We’re… a bit h-hidden away, it was more of a marketing tactic. C-Can your people even drink alcohol…?”

“W-Well…” the Human muttered, sounding just as anxious as the Fissan. “I-I’m apparently a bit of a lightweight by alien standards, but… yes.”

Eorna carefully examined the pair, seeming to mull an answer over in his head. Eventually, though, he flicked an ear. “W-Well… I’m not one to falsely advertise, and credits are credits. S-Seagal, is that alright?”

The Nevok seemed a bit startled at hearing his name, having been watching the predator very closely. But eventually, after some thought, he flicked an ear as well. “A-As long as they don’t cause trouble, I guess…”

Eorna let out an audible breath through his nose. “V-Very well. What will you have?”

“Oh, TO *HELL* WITH THAT!”

Everyone, myself included, jumped at the sudden outburst. It had come from the booth directly behind me, and it made my ears ring.

From the booth behind me, a fairly tall Letian stumbled out of the seat, taking their glass with them. Their face and gliding membrane were flushed yellow. “Eorna, what are you shay– su… talkin’ about!” he yelled. “Tell the damn predator to leave before it killsh somebody!”

“P-Predator or not, it’s a paying customer,” Eorna replied. “We advertised that their kind is welcome, so they’re welcome. Th-they’re protected refugees with as much right to be here as anyone else.”

“Protected*…* they’re *predatorsh!* The only *right* they should have ish the right to death by fire!”

“Oh, lord…” muttered the Human. “Oley, come on, let’s just go. We can drink at my place–”

“Wh– No!” yipped the Farsul, offended, before stomping over to the Letian. “By the ancestors, what is your problem! No Human has eaten *anybody!* I just want to go out with my friend!”

“What’sh *my* problem?” the Letian asked incredulously as though it were obvious. He stumbled a bit. “My *problem* ish that I can’t go *anywhere* in thish town anymore without havin’ t’ watch my tail sho that one of these monshters doesn’t bite it off! Saintsh protect me, there’sh predators everywhere, and the neither the gov– govern… Tarva or Andel want to do their damn *jobsh* and get ‘em off our shtreets! Who knowsh how many they’ve killed when no one was watchin’!”

“I *just said* they haven’t eaten anybody, you useless airhead! What, are those big eyes taking up too much room for your brain?!”

The room felt a bit… colder, for some reason, as the Letian and the Farsul – Oley – kept screaming at one another, barbs and insults being thrown back and forth, while the Human kept trying to convince his furious friend to leave it be. Next to me, Parla curled up on herself, her ears pinned back.

Seagal seemed to recover his bearings and stepped forward, trying to de-escalate. “Alright, *both* of you knock it off. Sir, I think you’ve had enough to drink.”

“Get losht!” the Letian continued yelling at the pair, ignoring him. “You and yer tainted *friend* aren’t welcome here, right guys?!”

**“YEAH!”**

My ears raised. *What the…?* A good third to half of the bar had actually shouted back in agreement. The people at his own booth had obviously agreed, but so had a number of strangers, their inebriation turning their fear into anger. Many others simply looked away, afraid to get involved… or perhaps not willing to speak their true feelings.

“Get out of here!”

“Can’t I just not worry about predators for one claw?!”

“Go back to your own damn planet!”

“What the brahk is the governor’s office thinking! Are we being left to fend for ourselves?!”

“I know! What happened to the protection of the herd!”

The Farsul’s raised hackles lowered, and his tail started to tuck between his legs. Even Eorna and Seagal seemed surprised. If I listened carefully, under the shouts of pent-up frustration… I could hear the Human softly crying.

My new herdmates and I looked at one another. I didn’t like where this was going… there were a lot more anti-Human holdouts than I thought…

“Damn it…” Karpo muttered. He nudged Vyrlo on the shoulder. “Hey, move. Let me out.”

Vyrlo glanced at him briefly. “Karpo, please don’t involve yourself–”

“Screw that.” Without waiting for a response, he clambered over his surprised herdmate, speed-walking towards the pair.

“Karpo, hold on–” I called after him, but he ignored me. *Brahk, should I go after him…?*

The Yotul placed himself firmly between the Letian and the Human and Farsul pair. “Look, man, let’s just take a deep breath, alright? They just got through a major attack, and–”

“Oh, shhhhhut up! I don’t need to hear thish from shome damn *primitive!*” the Letian interrupted, causing Karpo’s features to sour instantly. “Figuresh you’d be on the predatorsh side! Y’ probably don’t even get how dangeroush they are!”

“Alright, how about they sit on the far side of the bar over there, as far away from any of you as possible, yeah? They won’t even be blocking the entrance or anything–” He was speaking through clenched teeth.

“I don’t need to *compromizh,* you low-ground idiot! I want it out of here! And while we’re at it, *you* get losht, too! I don’t want you gettin’ dirt in my drink!” He waved his mostly empty glass in the air, nearly spilling the last of it.

*“What was that?”*

“Oh, no…” Vyrlo’s ears fell as Karpo began to lose his temper, and soon they were shouting at each other, the argument slowly getting louder and more direct. By now the bar was in an uproar, everyone throwing insults, with neither of the bar’s owners able to regain control. And the Human was stuck in the middle of it, them and their Farsul friend rooted in place, stunned into silence at the scene that their mere *presence* had caused.

I was getting a bad feeling… “W-We should probably get out of here…” I said over the clamor.

“Yes, that might be for the best,” Vyrlo agreed, standing quickly. “Parla? Are you alright? We should go.”

“O-Okay…” Parla scooted out of the seat after me. She seemed too anxious to do much else. Unfortunately, the exit was on the other side of the main argument, and we still had to collect Karpo.

Steeling ourselves, we walked right into the tangleweeds. “Oh, and here comes the primitive’s *tribe!*” shouted the Letian.

We ignored him. “Listen, I’m sorry, I wish it wasn’t like this, but you two need to go,” I said to the Farsul and Human.

“I-I just wanted…” the Farsul was practically in tears.

“I know. It’s not right. But come on, we all need to leave. *Now.*”

“Karpo, my friend, it’s not worth it,” Vyrlo said, placing a paw on his herdmate’s shoulder. “Our drinks are souring. Let’s go.”

“No, fuck off!” he shouted, shrugging him away. He was too inebriated himself to listen to reason. “I’m tired of primitive this, primitive that! I worked my damn tail off trying to prove to these idiots that I deserve to be here, learning all their fancy tech to prove them all wrong, and so far it’s all felt like it was for fucking *nothing!* I’ve been trying to earn the approval of a bunch of racist assholes that don’t give a fuck about me or any of us!”

“Karpo, you’re drunk,” I begged, trying to step between them to keep them physically separated. “I’ll drag you out by your tail if I have to. Come on, please.”

“And who the hell is thish?!” the Letian shouted, gesturing towards me.

“Lerai, this doesn’t involve you!” Karpo shouted as well. “You don’t get what it’s like! I’m sick of pieces of scrit-shit like this guy who think they’re so fucking high-and-mighty because they had the privilege of not being born on Leirn!”

He pushed past me, continuing to shout at the Letian right in his face. “You know, we have a word for people like you. *Wakrri.* Someone who thinks they’re full of class, but has none. Far as I’m concerned, you and all you fucking losers who destroy or put down anything and everything you disagree with have less class than rotting *garbage!*”

The Letian paused for a moment, silently seething. The arguments continued around us.

Suddenly, he threw his glass to the floor, the smash startling everyone into silence. “Oh, that’sh *it!*” he barked.

I saw it happen in slow motion. Letians have surprisingly tough claws, granted by evolution to climb the trees and mountains of their homeland. And now this one was using them to attack my friend.

With a wide, uncoordinated swipe, he slashed at Karpo, catching him in the shoulder and raking down across his cream-colored chest. The Yotul, and the rest of us, were completely caught off guard. I heard gasps of fright and shock from all across the bar, and one of pain as Karpo’s wounds began to seep with dark green blood.

And I felt a heat on my breath.

The Letian raised his other paw for a second attack, and before I could think, my body moved. I caught the swipe and smashed into him, throwing one arm over his shoulder and the other threading around his gliding membrane. The stretchy skin easily gave way to my arm’s grip with little resistance.

“W-what th–” the Letian exclaimed. The air tasted like booze as he spoke. He struggled weakly for the briefest moment, but he was too intoxicated, and not strong enough to break free.

Without even thinking, I shifted their arm, one paw on his elbow and the other on his back. And then I stepped, pivoted, and *pulled.*

“Hraah!” I bleated, as my tail added extra velocity to the hip throw. I caught the briefest look of surprise in his big eyes and ears as I smashed him into the wooden floor with a loud crash.

I stood, panting, carefully watching my opponent. I’d done damage, but I had to make sure he would stay *down.* I had to protect the herd!

Suddenly, the Letian made a noise. The threat was still active! I had to do something–

Something caught my shoulder, and I was shocked back into the present. With each breath, the flames quickly began to lower to a simmer. And as I regained my wherewithal… I remembered exactly where I was.

I looked around. It wasn’t just the Letian… EVERYONE was staring at me with mixtures of shock and fright, including my new herdmates. The only one who wasn’t was Parla, who was trying to check Karpo’s wound, but the injured Yotul was wearing a look of astonishment. Vyrlo himself had been the one to grab my shoulder, and was looking at me with an expression I couldn’t read. I swore I even felt the Human’s surprise from under their mask. Not a single person moved.

My breathing began to quicken again. But this time, it was out of anxiety. *Wh-why did I do that? I-I just… I moved without thinking!* Vyrlo released me, yet I still didn’t move. The Letian’s groans of pain were the only sounds in the entire bar.

“Lerai… what…?” Vyrlo breathed. It was the first thing anyone had said in what felt like forever.

“I-I…” I began, but I couldn’t force out any more words. The panic was too strong, and half the bar looked ready to stampede. I felt like I wanted to throw up.

Without another word, I pushed past the crowd and burst out of the bar, running as far and as fast as my feet would take me.

**KARMA:  CAUSE AND EFFECT**

""*Every action generates a force of energy that returns to us in like kind....what we sow is what we reap.*

*""And when we choose actions that bring happiness and success to others, the fruit of karma is happiness and success.""*  Deepak Chopra

(QUOTING from *""The Seven Spiritual Laws of Success,* by Deepak Chopra: based on *Creating Affluence,* New World Library, 58 Paul Drive, San Rafael, CA 94903:)

**THE LAW OF KARMA**

**(p. 39)**

*Karma is the eternal* assertion *human freedom....Our thoughts, our words, and deeds are the threads of the net which we throw around ourselves.*       (Swami Vivekananda)

The third spiritual law of success is the *Law of Karma.*  ""Karma"" is  both action and the consequence of that action; it is cause and effect simultaneously, because every action generates a force of energy that returns to us in like kind.  There is nothing unfamiliar about the *Law of Karma.*  Everyone has heard the expression, ""What we sow is what we reap.""  Obviously, if we want to create happiness in our lives, we must learn to sow the seeds of happiness.  Therefore, karma implies the actions conscious choice-making. 

You and I are essentially infinite choice-makers.  In every moment of our existence, we are in that field of all possibilities where we have access to an infinity of choices.  Some of these choices maximize the use of karmic law is to become consciously aware of the choices we make in every moment. 

Whether you like it or not, everything that is happening at this moment is a result of the choices you've made in the past.  Unfortunately, a lot of us make choices unconsciously, and therefore we don't think they are choices--and yet, they are.

If I were to insult you, you would most likely make the choice of being offended.  If I were to pay you a compliment, you would most likely make the choice of being pleased or flarttrered.  But think about it: it's still a choice.

I could offend you and I could insult you, and you could make the choice of not being offended.  I could pay you a compliment and you could make the choice of not letting that flatter Youn either.

In other words, most of us--even though we are infinite choice-makers--have become bundles of conditioned reflexes that are constantly being triggered by people and circumstances into predictable outcomes of behavior. These conditioned reflexes are like Pavlovian conditioning.  Pavlov is famous for demonstrating that if you give a dog something to eat every time you ring a bell, soon the dog starts to salivate when you just ring the bell, because it has associated one stimulus with the other.

Most of us, as a result of conditioning, have repetitious and predictable responses to the stimuli in our environment.  Our reactions seem to be automatically triggered by people and circumstances, and we forget that these are still choices that we are making in every moment of our existence.  We are simply making these choices unconsciously.

If you step back for a moment and witness the choices you are making as you make those choices, then in just this act of witnessing, you take the whole process from the unconscious realm into the conscious realm.  This procedure of conscious choice-making and witnessing is very empowering.

When you make any choice--any choice at all--you can ask yourself two things: First of all, ""What are the consequences of this choice that I'm making?""  In your heart you will immediately know what these are.  Secondly, ""Will this choice that I'm making now bring happiness to me and those around me?""  If the answer is yes, then go ahead with that choice.  If the answer is no, if that choice brin

There is only one choice, out of the infinity of choices available in every second, that will create happiness  for you as well as for those around you.  And when you make that one choice, it will result In a form of behavior that is called spontaneous right action.  Spontaneous right action is the right action at the right moment.  It's the right response to every situation as it happens.  It's the action that nourishes you and everyone else who is influenced by that action.

There is a very interesting mechanism that the universe has to help you make spontaneously correct choices.  The mechanism has to do with sensations in your body.  Your body experiences two kinds of sensations: one is sensation of comfort, the other is sensation of discomfort.  At the moment you consciously make a choice, pay attention to your body and ask your body, ""if I make this choice, what happens?""  If your body sends a  message of comfort, that's the right choice.  If your body sends a message of discomfort, then it's not the appropriate choice.

For some people the message of comfort and discomfort is in the area of the solar plexus, but for most  people it's in the area of the heart.  Consciously put your attention in the heart and ask your heart what to do.  Then wait for the response--a physical response in the form of a sensation.  It may be the *faintest* level of feeling--but it's there, in.your body.

Only the heart knows the correct answer.  Most people think the heart is mushy and sentimental.  But it's not.  The heart is intuitive, it's contextual, it's relational.  It doesn't have a win-lose orientation.  It taps into the cosmic computer--the field of pure potentiality, pure knowledge, and infinite organizing power--and takes everything into account.  At times it may not even seem rational, but the heart has a computing ability that is far more accurate and far more precise than anything within the limits of rational thought.

You can use the *Law of Karma* to create money and affluence, and the flow of all good things to you, any time you want.  But first, you must be consciously aware that your future is generated by the choices you are making in every moment of your life.  If you do this on a regular basis, then you  are making full use of the *Law of Karma.* The more you bring your choices into the level of your conscious awareness, the more you will make those choices which are spontaneously correct--both for you and those around you.

What about past karma and how it is influencing you now?  There are three things you can do about past karma.  One is to pay your karmic debts.  Most people choose to do that--unconsciously, of course.  This may be a choice you make, also.  Sometimes there's a lot of suffering involved in the payment of those debts, but the *Law of Karma* says no debt in the universe ever goes unpaid.  There is a perfect accounting system in the universe, and everything is a constant ""to and fro"" exchange of energy.

The second thing that you can do is to transmute or transfer your karma to a more desirable experience.  This is a very interesting process in which you ask yourself, as your paying your karmic debt, ""What can I learn from this experience?  Why is this happening and what is the message the universe is giving me?  How can I make this experience useful to my fellow human beings?""

By doing this, you look for the seed of opportunity and then tie that seed of opportunity  with your **dharma,** with your purpose in life, which we'll talk about in the Seventh Spiritual Law of Success.  This allows you to transmute the karma to new expression.

For example, if you break your leg while playing sports, you might ask, ""What can I learn from this experience?  What is the message that the universe is giving me?""  Perhaps the message is that you need to slow down and be more careful or attentive to your body the next time.  And if your dharma is to teach others what you know, then by asking, ""How can I make this experience useful to my fellow human beings?"", you may decide to share what you you learned by writing a book about playing sports safely.  Or you may design a special show or leg support that prevents the kind of injury you experienced.

This way, while paying your karmic debt, you  wiill have also converted the adversity into a benefit that may bring you wealth and fulfillment.  This is the transmutation of your karma into a positive experience.  You haven't really gotten rid of your karma, but you are able to take a karmic episode and create a new and positive karma out of it.

The third way to deal with karma is  to transcend it.  To transcend karma is to keep experiencing the gap, the Self, the Spirit.  It's like washing a dirty piece of cloth in a stream of water.  Every time you wash it, you take away a few stains.  You keep washing it again and again, and each time it gets a little cleaner.  You wash or transcend the seeds of your karma by going into the gap and coming out again.  This, of course, is done through the practice of meditation.

All actions are karmic episodes.  Drinking a cup of coffee is a karmic episode.  That action generates memory, and memory has the ability or the potentiality to generate desire.  And desire generates action again.  The operational software of your soul is karma, memory and desire.  By becoming conscious of these seeds of manifestation, you become a conscious generator of reality.  By becoming a conscious choice-maker, you begin to generate actions that are evolutionary for you and for those that are around you.  And that's all you need to do.

As long as karma is evolutionary--for both the Self and everyone affected by the Self--then the fruit of karma will be happiness and success.

**APPLYING THE LAW OF KARMA OR CAUSE AND EFFECT**

I will put the *Law of Karma*  into effect by making a commitment to take the following steps:

(1).Today I will witness the choices I make in each moment.  And in the mere witnessing of these choices, I will bring them to my conscious awareness.  I will know that the best way to prepare for any moment in the future is to be fully conscious in the present.

(2).Whenever I make a choice, I will ask myself two questions:  ""What are the consequences of this choice I'm making?"" and ""Will this choice bring fulfillment and happiness  to me and also to those who are affected by this choice?""

(3). I will then ask my heart for guidance and be  guided by its message of comfort or discomfort.  If the choice feels comfortable, I will plunge ahead with abandon.  If the choice feels uncomfortable, I will pause and see the consequences of my action with my inner vision.  This guidance will enable me to make spontaneously correct choices for myself and for all those around me.

(END OF QUOTING)

Thank you, Professor Chopra.

Doris (dharma) asks how can those whom she has not damaged be so intent upon destruction  of her?  Well, student, it is obviously straightforward that the enemy (evil) is out to getcha.  It is OK, for look at the lessons in opportunity and the lessons given voice by the experience.  Evil is always in battle against goodness, lies against truth, and sensing against Spiritual goodness.  I believe you have learned something else this day: the value and use of Karmic expression.  You see, to sit stupidly and mutely aside while the enemy in evil discredits and takes you down, is WRONG.  Justice is NOT served through lack of countering the assaults.  GOD IS JUST.  What is sent forth is returned IN KIND.  Until you all learn the LAWS, you cannot possibly accomplish the magnificent task before us.  What another ""believes"" is none of our business, do you see?  When others wish to destroy their brothers to suit their own evil greed, it is WRONG, no more and no less.  I shall not stand aside without recourse, readers.  MY job is not to SAVE anyone nor actually, any thing.  My job is to get the TRUTH of LIFE before you through he conduits of knowing ***from***  those who have come to KNOW.  I must get a remnant through and the others of the place are none of my business.  I shall counter EVIL wherein I meet it or it is thrust into my space.

How can I navigate supporting her without feeling like I am trying to be her therapist or like I'm supporting the abuser?,"A few months ago, my friend drove to visit me from another state. She has had a lot of ups and downs in relationships, heartbreak, etc. and I've been there for her through all of it. The perspective I got from our conversations was that she was just having bad luck and choosing emotionally unavailable men. She also lost a friend to suicide lately and that has been hard for her.

Fast forward to our visit, and... well, I discovered that it's not them, it's her. On her last weekend here, I was able to arrange a little coffee date for her with one of my male friends. Unfortunately, he ended up having to cancel last minute for work. (I know his job, he manages a large team and there was NO WAY of him getting out of this, unless he wanted to get fired.) He was incredibly apologetic about the situation and clearly bummed.

When she got his message, you guys... she flew off the handle. Right off the fucking end. Lost her mind and started ranting about what a piece of shit he was, how rude it was, how he clearly was just a XXX looking to jerk women around... the rant went on at least 20 minutes and she called him a lot of nasty names - r/relationships won't let me post them because they're very mean and gendered. I finally was able to talk her down and make her see reason (he's a good dude, I've known him for 6 years), but I was shook.

Since then, she has continued to message me about this guy, MULTIPLE times. Like this was a cancelled coffee date in another state; she left the following day. It was very low stakes, but she's obsessing over this non-interaction? I feel bad it didn't work out, but... it just didn't work out, you know?

Now, after being her listening ear for years, I sort of feel like I've been supporting an emotional abuser. All the things she has told me about her past relationships have suddenly been reframed and come into focus. Sure, the guys she dated probably weren't perfect, but I'm guessing they ended up leaving her because of explosions like the one I witnessed.

Here's the thing: to me, she is a good, kind person. Her childhood was absolutely fucked and she's just carrying around a ton of baggage and trauma. She is a very good friend to me, and I see her as just a bit shattered and broken. This shit is not black and white, unfortunately.

At the same time, her relationship issues are clearly going to continue to happen. The drama will never end. How do I listen to/support her in her future breakups, without feeling like I am trying to be her therapist or like I'm supporting the abuser?

tl;dr I love and care about my friend. But she is clearly emotionally abusive in relationships. How can I navigate supporting her without feeling like I am trying to be her therapist or like I'm supporting the abuser?",2,1728123530.0,relationships,1,1.0,False
