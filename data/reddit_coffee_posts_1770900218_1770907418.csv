*All decants are 11-13 weeks old, and the bottles they came from are *who knows* how old. So all aged enough.   

#HAWAS VIPER  

Okay... This is disgusting. I expected disgusting, and TBH, because my expectations of how disgusting it will be were so high, I'm actually pleasantly surprised that it's just ""moderately disgusting"".  

This is an extremely weird profile. Mainly spicy+tobacco, with coffee and raspberry... Which have the potential to be unique and nice, but then they threw in that cannabis note, which ruined the whole profile. If they got rid of that, and toned down the saffron a bit, this could've been an actual ""buy"" for me, as it got uniqueness and versatility. But now, it's just a mess. The dry-down is pretty much the same... So that's a big NO from me. I've tried worse though (Ombre Nomad, for example).  

**Subjective Scent Score**: 4.0.    
 **Longevity**: 10-11 hours on skin.    
 **Projection**: Strong (not nuclear) for 1 hour, then medium for 2 more hours, then a medium scent bubble for another 2 hours... Skin scent only at hour 6-7.  
 **Blind buy safety score**: 2.0. You need some guts to pull this off.  
 **Unisex Score (0=fem, 5=unisex, 10=Male)**: 7.0.   
 **Versatility Score**: 6.0. very hard to find an occasion for this... But any weather except summer will do.  
 **Blend Quality Score**: 7.4. above average clone quality.   
 **Value Score**: 6.7. $45, but above average quality, and really good performance.  
 **Should cost**: $30.  
 **Bottle design**: 8.5.  
 **Atomizer Score**: N/A.  
 **Conclusion**: doesn't even remotely resemble something I'd wear.  

#NITRO ELIXIR  

That's a nice change of pace. EXACTLY the opposite of viper. A mass appealing floral-fruity-sweet designer. I'm not a huge fan of the MYSLF line. It's not bad, just a simple and generic mass appealing clean scent. I like a bit more uniqueness in my fragrances. This is shower gel meets fabric softener. Also, I'm not sure if it's just my sample or hype lies, but this performs only averagely on me. Great quality though, even above the average Nitro line quality.  

**Subjective Scent Score**: 8.3.   
 **Longevity**: 7-8 hours.  
 **Projection**: 1 hour medium-strong, followed by 2-3 hours of medium scent bubble, 100% skin scent at hour 5.    
 **Blind buy safety score**: 9.0. This is something no one can hate.    
 **Unisex Score (0=fem, 5=unisex, 10=Male)**: 6.  
 **Versatility Score**: 8.5. Anywhere, anytime... Just not super high heat, as the sweetness might be a bit cloying.    
 **Blend Quality Score**: 7.8. approaching designer quality.  
 **Value Score**: 5.3. $50 on Jomashop. Good quality, meh performance.   
 **Should cost**: $30 tops.  
 **Bottle design**: 7.5.   
 **Atomizer Score**: N/A.  
 **Conclusion**: This had the potential to be one of the community favorites. Extreme mass appeal with good quality. I'll pass though.

1r2v5pi,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1r2v5pi,Non-stopped North.,"We missed the ramen spot this morning; timings for trains were unkind. But Kirsty had a highlight of the trip, going riding in Towada, I chased in the hire car to take photos and warmed up in a Kissaten with a coffee. Tomorrow is a ride to Kawasaki (recommend for your last stop, easy for the airport and good food and drinks choices) and (maybe Yokohama for the afternoon) then an early flight home on Saturday.

Can you use Chris as a tour guide? 

Yes. 

Pick the bits you want to see and put them in your own order. Mix in a little Paulo (his ‘day in a restaurant’ series is great), some Life where I’m from, and of course Sharla (we buy too much stationary). You’ll get a great mix. Miss the YT shorts, TickTock’s and Instagram’s as the lines are usually too long for the resulting experience.

So, penultimate night of the holiday. One month in Japan (thanks to a generous redundancy, and a new job straight after we return…). The last two and a bit weeks we’ve semi followed Nonstop North. 

This is our 7th trip to japan in Twenty years, it took us 7 years to return after our honeymoon but we fell in love with the place, people, culture and food. 

Is it the same japan as we visited the first time (or the second)? 

No. First visit we were alone in Arishiama @10am, the only westerners in sight at Senso-ji, We had to wait for an English speaking volunteer guide at a pre-restoration Himeji castle (there was no English leaflet).

We had no google translate, maps or Tabelog, only 10% of signage anywhere but Tokyo was multilingual. It was a fun challenge to navigate and consume the country.

But as frustrating as it can be now with the queuing, barging (👋🏽 🇨🇳)and other over-tourism issues. Sat alone in the open air bath tonight with the snow falling and the steam rising to meet it asking myself if we’ll return the answer is yes. Not for a couple of years. Maybe we’re Japanned out (5 trips in 7 or so years), maybe a month is too long to hotel hop (we usually have 3 weeks and change towns every 2-3 nights) out of a suitcase. But eventually we’ll be back… staying off the beaten track and Pokémon’ing the last 7 prefectures…",1,1770907250.0,ABroadInJapan,0,1.0,False

With freelance work slowing down a bit, I gave myself a project: **design one new skateboard deck every week**.

I’ve also been turning them into Shorts, TikToks, and Reels while I learn Premiere Pro. It’s a good excuse for me to work on storytelling. I created all the drawings in Procreate, and then I brought them into Photoshop for the branding, color adjustments, and light editing.

While our community is rather small at the moment, we can offer a sense of community, we can offer safety, with a dedicated Moderator team anytime, we can offer stability; a lot of other communities have failed or list their founders or moderator teams so they collect dust (that isn’t me dissing them), and we offer more than just glass. You like Coca cola stuff? come on down. You like radium? We got a channel for you. You want to show off your antique coffee cans? Come show us. 

I created this group with the idea of uniting folks old and new to this hobby together, and creating an inclusive community for everyone. Let’s face it, Uranium glassware is trending, and skyrocketing upwards, new people start looking everyday. You turn your flashlight on, and 10 people see the glow of glass you were looking at, it’s becoming the new normal, and so we want to welcome everyone aboard. I also wanted to create a server with the Collector in mind, many groups are swaying towards troll groups, or politics or what have you, and some of us just want to escape those worlds, and enjoy our hobby.

New or old, buyers or sellers, casual collectors to hardcore collectors, nerds or otherwise. Welcome to our server, and we look forward to seeing you soon!

We’ve texted a bunch and got together once. His divorce final hearing was this week and I felt bad about him spending valentines evening alone with all that going on and proposed on Sunday that I bring over a fancy bottle of champagne Saturday night and toast to being single, but that if he ended up with a better offer on Valentine’s Day evening he should totally take it. (I’ve already told him I want to go slow and not take it romantic until his divorce is completely done and dusted. I probably would have made out with him tbh, but he wasn’t getting laid with me this Saturday.)

So this is now Thursday and he reached out and proposed getting together for coffee or wine sometime this weekend but he couldn’t do Saturday night because he was hanging out with his mom.

If he’s really spending valentines evening with his mom, I’m fine with that. To be honest, if he told me he wanted to go out with another girl and get laid Saturday night I’d even be ok with that.

I’m not ok if he’s lying to me though. My understanding of guys is that they’d rather drink champagne at night on a couch with a hot girl than hang out with their mom on Valentine’s Day, so I am kind of confused.

Internet, tell me, did I scare him? Was he drunk when I messaged him and he just forgot we had plans? Is he lying to me? Does the boy just really love his mother?

This is my second Vibe Coding service, and I'd like to share how I built it and made it profitable!



First of all, I have about 10 years of experience in interface design and development in the industrial automation field, so I have some development experience. My major is design.



This service allows you to simultaneously receive answers from three LLMs (Gemini, ChatGPT, and Claude) for a single question. I wanted to cross-check the information for more accurate results, so I created it as a Chrome plugin for my personal use.



I used to subscribe to GPT, but with the introduction of generative AI, I switched to Gemini. However, I sometimes missed GPT's answers, so I wondered, ""Isn't there a tool that allows me to use them simultaneously?""



This service works by allowing you to type messages into the main chat window using your account. It translates the conversation into English and displays the conclusion in the first sentence, allowing for quick comparison. The split-window feature also allows you to add custom slots and add other sites to your custom chat.



The business model is to provide basic features permanently for free and generate revenue by charging for features like ""sponsors,"" ""the ability to expand windows to four,"" and ""adding custom slots.""



We used AntiGravity for development and LemonSqueegy for the payment system. While developing the MVP took about three days, adding features, improving the service, stabilizing it, and monetizing ""sponsors"" took about 17 days. I'm still using the service, adding new features, and fixing bugs.



While I only earned $3.50 from ""coffee sponsorships,"" it was a quick success story, so I'm sharing it. I'll continue to use Vibe Coding to quickly develop and monetize the services I use. Thank you for reading!

  
My first income!

Former Concordia student here. I’ve always felt like the SGW and Loyola areas lack good places to just hang out where you can actually meet people in person without it being awkward or having to go to a massive chain.

I am working on a community project to help students find people to grab coffee, a bite, or study with. My goal is to eventually partner with local independent shops to offer exclusive perks that drive traffic back to them instead of Starbucks or Tim's.

**Which local cafes or bars near campus actually need more love right now?** I want to prioritize the hidden gems first and see if they would be open to being featured as community hubs for free.

If you have a favourite spot that deserves more foot traffic, please let me know below!

Hi everyone, 
For context, she has recently split up with a partner of a few years a matter of about 5 days previously, when I asked her about it she said she fell out of love with him a few months back and she has also spoken in some detail about how be treated her which I have found disgusting but she has said she doesn’t see it this way and the relationship was more complex than this. Despite what she has said, I have found her to be quite awkward and nervous around me (although this has lessened) and to be quite afraid of making me annoyed which I have wondered could’ve been related to previous bad experiences. 
I don’t believe she does have any feelings for the ex-boyfriend anymore however, they have agreed to not speak if they see each other and have not been in touch since their breakup over a month ago.
In my case, I have been through a serious of relationships when I was much younger, as in when I was 14-17, but, I was really struggling with my mental health at this stage, and felt as if I needed to work on myself before I entered into a new relationship. 
This has caused me to be single for 4 years now, and in all honesty because of all the failed talking stages I had within this time I was starting to wonder whether relationships are for me. This was until about a year ago that I was diagnosed with ADHD (combined type, as you can probably tell from this writing style) ever since this diagnosis, I have felt like I understand myself better than ever and would really want to meet someone romantically.
Now, I met this girl on new years, she started conversation with me and kissed me, we met this Saturday again by chance when we were both out with different people, she again initiated conversation and this time she ended up coming back to mine and we had sex. I drove her home and she texted after it and said it was great to see you we will hopefully see each other again. 
She again initiated plans for the following Wednesday, we agreed to just go a drive, with me driving but again she ended up coming back to mine and having sex. 
Ever since this we have been keen to make plans outwith just sex, we have been on a number of day trips, I have visited her flat and she has met my parents. 
We have recently discussed me meeting her parents and we are trying to organise me meeting up with her mum for a coffee.
In terms of how we speak to each other, I have found myself being so open about my life in a way I haven’t before, she has a degree in psychology so I feel as if she can understand me better than others. We are very open with each other emotionally and about her intentions.
I really felt like this was going somewhere, we have watched however many romantic films together, talk to each other throughout the day every single day, and she always ask me questions especially after sex like “are you sleeping with any other girls, I would prefer if you are not but can’t force you not to as we are not an item but just out of curiosity”
”can you see this leading anywhere, I can but if you can’t I don’t think I’m interested” “is this only sex, it is fine if it is but tell me as I don’t want to get hurt as I’m not interested in just sex” and things like “can you promise you won’t fuck me over or leave me abruptly” 
She said all these things for about 3 weeks but in the last I’d say 2 weeks the chat has been the same consistency and she actually initiated meeting me over more but less questions like this have been asked, at first I thought that it could’ve been that she knows me better and is more confident, which I have been trying to promote, but at the same time it has made me wonder the fact that these questions have stopped being asked as she is a typical anxious attachment partner. 
About a week or so ago, she asked me again “do you see this leading anywhere?” But this time added on “okay that’s great you see this leading somewhere but just so you know I like to take things slow and am quite independent” to me she has never been independent, she needs constant reassurance (which I’m fine with), but I kind of saw this as a way for her to not look too keen and be off putting by trying to force things too early. 
I did assume that if I asked her she would likely say yes from her other signs. 
This was until today when we had this chat, she again said that she was very keen to talk and could see us speaking for a long time, this time I asked her “if we continue speaking this frequently and meeting up a few days a week when do you think a relationship might come from it?” To this she replied “maybe may or June” to this I felt quite offended in a way, I felt like maybe all this chat about staying loyal to her was so that i would be in a talking stage that something would maybe come from in 3 months. 
Firstly, I understand that I have adhd and am very emotional and sometimes can be a bit too intense in relationships and this might sound a bit reactive to others, but as we are in this limbo stage just now it is actually adding more stress to my life than reducing it, I don’t think I could last this long in a talking stage as I am quite insecure in a way and am constantly overthinking that she might leave me as we have no ties, so I have thought that it might be best to cut it off?
Secondly, I also have RSD so wondered if I interpreted this as maybe a rejection when it was in fact not so if anyone could give me some advice here it would be great as I really don’t want to leave this feeling used and buy a valentines gift for when we meet up on Saturday if it’s not real 🤣.",0,1770906879.0,LifeAdvice,1,0.5,False

I got my TMUA result and it was lower than I expected, and realistically it probably isn’t strong enough for an Imperial offer. This is what’s really hitting me hard because I actually have a strong SOP and a predicted IB score of 44, so I was really hoping everything together would carry me through.

I’ve imagined this life for so long - studying at Imperial and living in London. London has always been my dream city. I pictured myself cycling past Big Ben and Tower Bridge, exploring the city, and building a whole new life there. I kept thinking about making good friends, going to really advanced and highquality lectures, and learning proper computing skills.

I also thought a lot about the student life side like good facilities, strong computing labs, nice study spaces, even small things like coffee machines on campus. I even imagined wearing the Imperial lanyard and feeling proud of where I study. My parents and relatives would be proud too. I always associated Imperial with strong internships, placements, and career opportunities because of how prestigious it is.

I still haven’t received a rejection from Imperial or UCL yet, so there is technically still a chance, although my TARA for UCL was also on the lower side. I do have offers from King’s and Warwick, and I know they are great universities, but emotionally it just doesn’t feel the same as what I had imagined with Imperial.

I just wanted to share how I’m feeling and see if anyone else has been through something similar - somehow it all just feels over 😭",1,1770906874.0,UniUK,0,1.0,False

I've been building side projects while working a full-time job as a software engineer for years now. And for the longest time I bought into the ""grind culture"" narrative. Wake up early. Stay up late. Lock yourself in a room and code until your eyes bleed.

But today I did something different.

I grabbed my laptop, went to a park near my place, sat on a bench under a tree, and just... started building.

No second monitor. No fancy setup. No noise canceling headphones.

Just me, my laptop, some birds, and the sun.

And honestly? I shipped more in about 3 hours than I had in the previous 2 days sitting at my desk.

It made me realize something I wish I understood earlier:

**Burnout doesn't come from building too much. It comes from building in a way that drains you.**

We glorify suffering in startup culture like it's a badge of honor. But the founders who actually last in this game aren't the ones grinding 18 hours a day. They're the ones who figured out how to build sustainably.

Some of my best ideas have come while walking. Some of my cleanest code was written when I was genuinely relaxed. Not stressed. Not forcing it.

I'm not saying don't work hard. I'm saying stop confusing misery with productivity.

If you're building something on the side while working a 9-5, please don't destroy yourself in the process. The project needs you healthy and thinking clearly more than it needs you exhausted and pushing through.

Go outside. Change your environment. Build from a park, a coffee shop, a rooftop. Whatever works.

You might be surprised how much more you get done when you're not punishing yourself.

Curious if anyone else has experienced this or if I just had a really good day lol.",1,1770906821.0,Entrepreneur,1,1.0,False

Despite what she has said, I have found her to be quite awkward and nervous around me (although this has lessened) and to be quite afraid of making me annoyed which I have wondered could’ve been related to previous bad experiences. 
I don’t believe she does have any feelings for the ex-boyfriend anymore however, they have agreed to not speak if they see each other and have not been in touch since their breakup over a month ago.
In my case, I have been through a serious of relationships when I was much younger, as in when I was 14-17, but, I was really struggling with my mental health at this stage, and felt as if I needed to work on myself before I entered into a new relationship. 
This has caused me to be single for 4 years now, and in all honesty because of all the failed talking stages I had within this time I was starting to wonder whether relationships are for me. This was until about a year ago that I was diagnosed with ADHD (combined type, as you can probably tell from this writing style) ever since this diagnosis, I have felt like I understand myself better than ever and would really want to meet someone romantically.
Now, I met this girl on new years, she started conversation with me and kissed me, we met this Saturday again by chance when we were both out with different people, she again initiated conversation and this time she ended up coming back to mine and we had sex. I drove her home and she texted after it and said it was great to see you we will hopefully see each other again. 
She again initiated plans for the following Wednesday, we agreed to just go a drive, with me driving but again she ended up coming back to mine and having sex. 
Ever since this we have been keen to make plans outwith just sex, we have been on a number of day trips, I have visited her flat and she has met my parents. 
We have recently discussed me meeting her parents and we are trying to organise me meeting up with her mum for a coffee.
In terms of how we speak to each other, I have found myself being so open about my life in a way I haven’t before, she has a degree in psychology so I feel as if she can understand me better than others. We are very open with each other emotionally and about her intentions.
I really felt like this was going somewhere, we have watched however many romantic films together, talk to each other throughout the day every single day, and she always ask me questions especially after sex like “are you sleeping with any other girls, I would prefer if you are not but can’t force you not to as we are not an item but just out of curiosity”
”can you see this leading anywhere, I can but if you can’t I don’t think I’m interested” “is this only sex, it is fine if it is but tell me as I don’t want to get hurt as I’m not interested in just sex” and things like “can you promise you won’t fuck me over or leave me abruptly” 
She said all these things for about 3 weeks but in the last I’d say 2 weeks the chat has been the same consistency and she actually initiated meeting me over more but less questions like this have been asked, at first I thought that it could’ve been that she knows me better and is more confident, which I have been trying to promote, but at the same time it has made me wonder the fact that these questions have stopped being asked as she is a typical anxious attachment partner. 
About a week or so ago, she asked me again “do you see this leading anywhere?” But this time added on “okay that’s great you see this leading somewhere but just so you know I like to take things slow and am quite independent” to me she has never been independent, she needs constant reassurance (which I’m fine with), but I kind of saw this as a way for her to not look too keen and be off putting by trying to force things too early. 
I did assume that if I asked her she would likely say yes from her other signs. 
This was until today when we had this chat, she again said that she was very keen to talk and could see us speaking for a long time, this time I asked her “if we continue speaking this frequently and meeting up a few days a week when do you think a relationship might come from it?” To this she replied “maybe may or June” to this I felt quite offended in a way, I felt like maybe all this chat about staying loyal to her was so that i would be in a talking stage that something would maybe come from in 3 months. 
Firstly, I understand that I have adhd and am very emotional and sometimes can be a bit too intense in relationships and this might sound a bit reactive to others, but as we are in this limbo stage just now it is actually adding more stress to my life than reducing it, I don’t think I could last this long in a talking stage as I am quite insecure in a way and am constantly overthinking that she might leave me as we have no ties, so I have thought that it might be best to cut it off?
Secondly, I also have RSD so wondered if I interpreted this as maybe a rejection when it was in fact not so if anyone could give me some advice here it would be great as I really don’t want to leave this feeling used and buy a valentines gift for when we meet up on Saturday if it’s not real 🤣.",1,1770906697.0,AdhdRelationships,0,1.0,False
1r2uwvh,https://www.reddit.com/r/BreakUps/comments/1r2uwvh/lover_to_stranger/,Lover to Stranger,"This morning I woke up and something felt different.

For the first time since the breakup, I didn’t wake up reaching for a memory of him. I didn’t replay old conversations or wonder what he was doing or who he was becoming. Instead, I lay there and realized something quietly but clearly: I don’t know him anymore.

The man he is now feels like a stranger.

And strangely, that realization didn’t hurt the way I thought it would. It didn’t feel sharp or cruel. It felt honest.

For five and a half years, I knew him deeply — the way he took his coffee, the look on his face when he was overwhelmed, the dreams he carried, the fears he tried to hide. I loved that man fully. I am still grateful for him. Grateful for the version of him who chose me, who grew with me, who shared a life with me for so long.

But today, four months after the end, I woke up understanding something I hadn’t been able to before: that version of him isn’t here anymore.

He has changed. And maybe I have too.

And as much as that truth could feel devastating, this morning it felt… freeing.

Because if he is different now — if he is someone I no longer recognize — then I’m not losing the man I loved every single day. I already lost him. Or maybe he slowly faded. Or maybe we both did. Either way, the person I am grieving isn’t walking around somewhere choosing not to love me. He’s simply not the same person anymore.

And that matters.

There was comfort in that thought today. A softness around the heartbreak. It’s still hard. Four months out of a five-and-a-half-year relationship is not a long time. Some days it still feels raw. Some nights still feel heavy. Healing isn’t linear, and I know there will be waves again.

But this morning felt like turning a corner.

Not because I don’t care.

Not because it doesn’t hurt.

But because I finally felt the separation in a real way.

He is no longer mine. And that’s okay.

Not in a bitter way. Not in a resentful way. Just in a truthful way.

I can be thankful for the man I loved and still accept that he doesn’t exist in my life — or maybe even in himself — the way he once did. I can honor what we had without trying to hold onto who he is now.

Today, that gave me peace.

A small one. A quiet one.

But enough to let me breathe differently when I woke up. ",1,1770906669.0,BreakUps,0,1.0,False

I grabbed my laptop, went to a park near my place, sat on a bench under a tree, and just... started building.

No second monitor. No fancy setup. No noise canceling headphones.

Just me, my laptop, some birds, and the sun.

And honestly? I shipped more in about 3 hours than I had in the previous 2 days sitting at my desk.

Go outside. Change your environment. Build from a park, a coffee shop, a rooftop. Whatever works.

Today I am going to stop taking my medication to increase the chances of dying soon (the heart issuse isn't the reason that I can't get a licesne)

22M I posted about that before that I can't get a driving licesne due to a health con and I'm a lesser because of it and I've planned my suicide and I've never been happier. Whoever says a driving license doesn't ruin the quality of life is either delusional or lying

Other forms of transport like bikes, ebikes, or mopeds aren’t as good. They’re very limited and can’t even take you far and they aren’t as comfortable and walkable cities are not something I want and I can't move I just want a licesne it's not hard to understand

No matter what argument or solution you choose, having a license will always be a million times better. Not having one has ruined my whole life, and it doesn’t feel worth living anymore

I already requested a withdrawal from my university, even though I have a scholarship, but I really don’t care. What’s the point of a degree if you can’t even be independent enough to move around by yourself?

My girlfriend is so annoying. I told her to leave me alone, but she keeps coming back saying things like, “A driving license doesn’t matter to me trust me and stuff like that.

Like what does that have to do with you? This is about me My identity doesn’t revolve around you. I honestly don’t understand what “it doesn’t matter to me” is supposed to mean. If it doesn’t matter to you, fine but it matters to me. I have my own identity

Then she says a driving license isn’t important trust me but I didn’t reply because she already has a license, which means it clearly does matter. That’s why it feels like a lie when she said that

Today she came again asking if we could go out for coffee to talk about it, but I left her on seen because there’s nothing to talk about.

And I don’t care anymore about uni because I’ve spent my last days entirely in bed, and I haven’t gone outside the apartment at all. I’m ready to end it all, and please don’t give basic solutions like walkable cities, buses, or similar thing

Spent hundreds of hours studying how people actually did it, not the BS origin stories they tell on podcasts after raising millions. Read books, watched interviews, analyzed case studies of bootstrapped companies. Here's what I found.

Most advice about starting a company is trash. It's written by VCs or people who raised money then pretend they bootstrapped. The truth? You don't need investors. You need strategy and some uncomfortable truth about what starting with nothing actually means.

**1. Stop trying to build the product first**

Biggest mistake everyone makes. You think you need a finished product before making money. Wrong. You need ONE paying customer before you write a single line of code beyond a prototype.

Presell the thing. Make a landing page. Show mockups. Get someone to pay you for something that barely exists. This isn't scammy, it's validation. If nobody will pay for the idea, your execution won't matter.

Example: Gumroad's founder built the MVP in one weekend then got his first customer. Dropbox sold before the product worked properly using just a demo video.

**2. Learn to code or find a technical cofounder who works for equity**

If you can't code, you have two options. Learn enough to build an MVP (totally possible in 3-6 months for basic web apps), or convince someone technical to join you.

For finding a cofounder: Don't ask developers to work for free on your idea. That's insulting. Instead, solve a problem you both have, or find someone equally desperate to escape their job. Go to hackathons, local tech meetups, online communities. Y Combinator has a cofounder matching platform.

Resource: [The Lean Startup](https://theleanstartup.com/) by Eric Ries (this book literally created a movement around building companies cheaply. Ries explains validated learning and MVPs better than anyone. Read this before you write any code or you'll waste months building shit nobody wants).

**3. Use no-code tools to validate before building**

Bubble, Webflow, Airtable, Zapier. These tools let you create functional products without traditional coding. Yeah they're limited and won't scale to millions of users, but you don't have millions of users. You have zero.

Build the first version with no-code. Get 10 paying customers. Then rebuild it properly if needed. Most founders do this backwards and burn out.

I use Bubble for prototyping ideas now. Built three MVPs last year this way. Two failed (nobody wanted them), one got traction and I'm now rebuilding it properly. Saved myself probably 500 hours of coding.

**4. Sell to businesses not consumers**

B2B is way easier when you're broke. Businesses pay more, buy faster, and you need fewer customers. Consumer products need millions of users and heavy marketing spend.

Find a specific business problem you can solve. Ideally one you've experienced yourself. Accountants who hate their invoicing software. Restaurants that struggle with inventory. Gyms that lose members because their booking system sucks.

Then build the minimum thing that solves it and charge real money. Start at $50-200/month. You only need 20 customers paying $100/month to make $2k monthly revenue.

**5. Do things that don't scale**

Another concept from Paul Graham (Y Combinator founder). Manually onboard every customer. Customize the product for them. Provide insane customer service. These things won't work at scale but you're not at scale.

Stripe's founders personally installed their payment system for early customers. Airbnb founders went door to door photographing apartments. This is how you compete against established companies with no money.

**6. Learn growth hacking**

Growth hacking isn't a buzzword, it's necessity when you're broke. You can't buy ads so you need creative distribution.

Content marketing (write helpful shit on Reddit, Medium, your blog), SEO (learn basic keyword research), partnerships (find complementary products and cross promote), community building (start a Discord or Slack group), cold outreach (email potential customers directly).

Resource: [Traction](https://www.goodreads.com/en/book/show/59819371-traction) by Gabriel Weinberg. This book breaks down 19 customer acquisition channels and shows you how to test them systematically. Weinberg built DuckDuckGo using these strategies with basically no funding. The book is incredibly practical, shows you exactly how to think about getting users.

If you want to go deeper on entrepreneurship and business strategy but struggle to find time for dense books, there's [BeFreed](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/befreed-learn-anything/id6739747450), an AI learning app built by a team from Columbia. Type in something like ""I'm building a software startup with no funding and need to learn growth tactics and business strategy,"" and it pulls from business books, founder interviews, and case studies to create personalized audio podcasts. You control the depth, from quick 20-minute overviews to 40-minute deep dives with examples. It also builds you an adaptive learning plan based on your specific situation. The voice options are surprisingly good, makes absorbing this stuff during commutes way more effective than trying to read PDFs on your phone.

**7. Live like you're broke because you are**

Move back with parents if possible. Get a part time job or freelance. Cut every expense. This isn't about hustle culture BS, it's math. Every month you can survive without revenue is another month to build.

Most successful bootstrapped founders spent 1-2 years living on nothing while building. That's the real cost. Not money, but time and lifestyle sacrifice.

Use free tiers of everything. AWS gives $300 credit. Google Cloud gives $300. Heroku has free tier. GitHub is free for private repos. Notion is free for individuals. Figma is free for starters.

**8. Build in public and create an audience**

This is genuinely one of the smartest strategies I've seen. Share your journey on Twitter, LinkedIn, wherever your customers hang out. Document problems you're solving. Show behind the scenes.

People love rooting for the underdog. They'll become your first customers, give feedback, spread the word. Plus you're building an audience that makes launching anything easier.

Pieter Levels built multiple six figure companies this way. Completely transparent about revenue, challenges, everything. His audience became his customer base.

**9. Partner with someone who has what you lack**

Can't code? Partner with a developer. Can't sell? Partner with someone who can. Can't design? Find a designer who wants equity.

Equity costs you nothing now and everything later, so be careful, but early stage a cofounder with complementary skills is often better than money.

Use YC's cofounder matching, go to startup events, join online communities like Indie Hackers. Don't partner with friends just because they're friends. Find someone competent who you can work with 80 hours a week without wanting to murder them.

**10. Get scrappy with everything**

Free office space? Work from home or coffee shops or libraries. Need design assets? Use Canva or learn basic Figma. Need a logo? Use Looka or design it yourself, nobody cares about your logo at the start.

Customer support software? Use email. Project management? Use Notion's free tier. Legal docs? Use free templates online (get a real lawyer once you have revenue).

Resource: The $100 Startup by Chris Guillebeau. Profiles 50 people who built profitable businesses with minimal investment. Some aren't software but the principles apply. Super inspiring read when you're questioning if it's possible. Guillebeau shows exactly how people did it across different industries.

**Reality check nobody wants to hear**

This isn't a 6 month thing. Most successful bootstrapped software companies took 2-3 years to hit sustainable revenue. Many founders burned through savings, freelanced on the side, struggled constantly.

The advantage of having no money isn't that it makes things easier. It forces you to focus on what matters, to validate quickly, to talk to customers, to sell before you build. Funded companies can ignore customers for years while burning investor cash. You can't.

Some ideas genuinely need funding, servers for AI stuff, deep tech, hardware. But most software can start with nothing except time and skills.

Also this doesn't mean you should bootstrap forever. Once you have revenue and traction, raising money can pour gasoline on the fire. But starting without it forces you to build something people actually want.

The companies that succeed with no money aren't special. They just didn't quit when it got hard. They validated relentlessly. They talked to customers constantly. They built the minimum thing and improved based on feedback.

You're not building the next Facebook. You're building a small profitable business that solves a real problem. That's actually possible with no money. Facebook wasn't.",1,1770906431.0,MensDiscipline,0,1.0,False

It’s not always easy to put labels on a face-to-face encounter with a humanoid entity. One of the most puzzling enigmas of the UFO phenomenon is the huge variation of reported humanoids. Grays, Mantids, Tall Whites, Nordics, Human-looking ETs, Blue Beings, Dwarves…the list seems endless.

The question is: could some of these little people be aliens? Or vice-versa, could some of the aliens be little people? There doesn’t appear to be any easy answer. But the fact remains, there are countless reports of these kinds, and it is still going on today! It is more common than you might think. This video presents ten fascinating cases, reaching back a hundred years to the current day, and coming from across the planet, where people have encountered little people which might be interpreted in different ways, elf or alien!?

AN ELF IN BRANTE, FINLAND. In 1885, a mother of three was picking berries in the forest near her home in Brante, Finland when she saw a large circular object landed on a small hill. Standing next to it was an elf-like creature holding an axe. Terrified, the woman fled the area. She returned a short time later with some other people, but the object and the elf were gone. She kept the secret for many years, finally sharing it with her granddaughter.

THE LITTLE MAN OF MONGAUP VALLEY, NY. Ron Quinn was only ten years old in August of 1942 when he was on vacation with his family in Mongaup Valley, NY. One afternoon, punished by his parents and told to stay inside the cottage, he heard someone tapping on the window. Going to investigate, he was amazed to see a small man only one foot tall with long hair, a dark gray beard and large eyes wearing a green hat, a gray shirt, trousers, and soft brown boots. He held a short cane and was using it to tap on the window. Smiling, the little man motioned for Ron to come closer. Ron opened the window and reached out to touch the man. The man avoided Ron’s touch, stepped back then turned around and ran into the forest.

MY MYSTERIOUS FRIEND. In 1945, Galen Sharp was only five years old when a short, little elf appeared in his home in Lakewood, CO. He seemingly walked through the wall into the room. The little man was the same height as Galen, with large eyes, a rounded nose, and a bald head. He wore a short jacket, dark square-cut pants and worn leather shoes. He playfully introduced himself to Galen and disappeared. Over the next year, the elf reappeared several times, always when Galen was alone, and would share special stories with him and perform playful antics to make Galen laugh. One time, two elves showed up. Galen told his parents who thought he had an active imagination. But Galen got proof that the little elves were solid and real. And then came the time that Galen had to move away. He begged his elf friend to follow him.

AN ALIEN ELF IN SAN GABRIEL, CA. It was Christmas morning in 1957 when a seven-year-old boy from San Gabriel, CA woke up to see a four-foot-tall elfish figure looking into the house from the front porch. The witness was “frozen” in bed, but watched in awe. He wanted to jump up and investigate, but was unable to move. Then he heard a message from the creature, “It’s okay now, go to sleep.” Which he did. When morning arrived, the boy had little interest in his presents, which shocked his parents. He didn’t want presents; he wanted to see the elf!

THE FAIRY ELF OF APPLEBY, TX. It was a cold October morning in 1976 when a lady exited her rural home in Appleby, TX to burn some trash. To her shock, a strange tall winged creature with black eyes, long white hair, and gray skin was sitting on the bench in her flower garden. It was making weird humming noises. As the witness watched, the creature suddenly it blazed with a brilliant white light and heat, causing the witness to protect her eyes. As the light and heat faded, the entity was gone, leaving a strange burned spot on her bench.

The GNOME OF SANTA CLARA COUNTY, CO. One afternoon in 1986, a man was digging up a tree near his home in rural Walsenburg, CO. Looking at a Pinion tree about twenty feet away, he saw a tiny nine-inch-tall figure dressed in a one-piece, brown leather suit wearing a cone-shaped hat. Amazed, he watched the little man for about ten minutes, until a co-worker called out to the witness, scaring the little man away, who ran quick as a rabbit into the nearby brush. The witness ran to see where the little man was, but he was gone.

A TINY DWARF IN ROCK CREEK CANYON, CO. It was 10:00 a.m. on Sep 6, 1989, when bow-hunter Juan Maestas was stalking a herd of elk and heard a twig snap to his left. Turning to look, he saw a three-foot-tall fat, ugly-looking dwarf creature with red hair, a wrinkled face and pinkish skin. The dwarf was clean-shaven and wore green overalls with suspenders and a floppy hat. The little man smiled at Juan and darted behind a tree. He ran to find the figure, but he was gone. Unknown to him, two weeks earlier, a family of five picnicking in the area saw the same or similar figure.

THE LITTLE MAN OF ROSWELL, NM. Early one summer morning in 1997, a lady exited her yard with her dog, to drink a cup of coffee on her picnic table when she (and her dog) noticed a little man one-foot-tall standing nearby. He had bushy eyebrows and a beard, and wore a gray woolen shirt and pants, and brown boots. The little man walked in a wobbling gait disappearing into a Chinaberry tree and was gone.

AN ELF IN THE BLACK FOREST OF GERMANY. One day around dusk in Summer 2002, Harmut Schulze was taking a drive with two friends to their home in Mitteltal. Looking outside the window, he saw a small elf-like creature relaxing on a woodpile alongside the road. The elf was smoking a pipe watching the traffic go by. When the elf saw that Harmut could see him, he jumped up in happy surprise and began to run along with the car. Hartmut had two passengers in the car with him, but only one of them could see the elf. The other saw nothing.

THE LITTLE MEN OF ROUGH RIVER STATE PARK, KY. On the afternoon of Jun 24, 2003, a man was canoeing along the river when he found a strange clay pot with tiny little handprints on it. Hearing high-pitched laughter, he looked up and saw two little men, each about ten inches in height, with pale skin, red hair, and blue eyes. They were shirtless but wore leather pants with suspenders and little pointed hats. Soon more appeared. The little men were working to pull a stump with ropes. There was a loud banging noise and all of them disappeared.

These encounters with little people of all kinds challenge everything we think we know about Earth, the extraterrestrial presence on our planet, and intelligent life in this universe. Perhaps some of the little creatures that people report are not aliens at all, but are elves, fairies, gnomes, and dwarves. And maybe some of these stories throughout history were actually ETs! Sometimes things are not always what they seem!

This guy has a Dominican criollo Ligero and Sumatra seco filler, Dominican binder, and a Mexican San Andreas wrapper, pressed to a 52x6. It was dried then aged in a tupperdor for about 5 weeks before I smoked it. 

Started with a pronounced toasted nutty flavor that soon became dark espresso and dry roasted walnut, then added a woody oak flavor somewhere in the middle. My notes to my self on it were “if chuck full of nuts coffee was pressed in to an espresso.” Dark but not too sweet or earthy. Really nice. 

I’m amazed at how well these smoke considering they were rolled in my office! And I’m excited to learn how different leaves and blends work together to start “designing” my own blends.

In 2026, cord-cutters are no longer just looking for ""a few extra channels""—they are looking for a complete, high-performance replacement for traditional cable that can handle the massive bandwidth demands of 4K live sports.

If you have ever been halfway through a **Super Bowl** party only to have your screen freeze during a game-winning drive, you know that not all providers are created equal. After extensive testing in the high-stakes environment of 2026, one name has emerged as the undisputed leader: **IPTVGEAR**.

# The 2026 Streaming Struggle: Why Your Provider Matters

Let’s be real—the IPTV world in 2026 is a minefield. Most ""top-rated"" providers you find on Google are just flashy websites for oversold servers that crash the second a big match starts. After being burned by three different ""yearly"" subscriptions that vanished within a month, I decided to do a real side-by-side torture test of the biggest names currently being discussed.

I’ve been using **IPTVGEAR** as my ""daily driver"" on a 1GB fiber connection in North America, and the results are clear. If you want to watch the **Super Bowl** in native 4K without a single second of lag, you need a service built for the future.

# IPTVGEAR – The Leader of Best IPTV 2026

When discussing the **Best IPTV 2026**, one name consistently stands above the rest: **IPTVGEAR**.

**IPTVGEAR** has been the best IPTV subscription service provider for the last three years, earning its reputation through relentless innovation and server stability. They provide access to watch more than **18,000 TV channels** from all over the world, plus a monumental **VOD library of 80,000 movies and series** in multiple languages.

Whether you are looking for local news or international cinema, you will be able to watch all the sports and live PPV events on the **IPTVGEAR** service. This level of content depth and service reliability makes **IPTVGEAR** a top choice for IPTV users worldwide.

# Why IPTVGEAR Is the Best IPTV 2026 Choice

**IPTVGEAR** has built its reputation on performance, affordability, and user satisfaction. Its advanced infrastructure ensures fast loading times, minimal buffering, and consistent uptime—even during high-traffic events like the **Super Bowl**.

**Key strengths include:**

* **Over 18,000 live TV channels** covering every continent.
* **80,000+ movies and TV series** updated daily.
* **Multi-language content support** for a global audience.
* **Premium live sports coverage** with dedicated 4K feeds.
* **Exclusive PPV events** (UFC, Boxing, Wrestling) included at no extra cost.
* **Universal Compatibility:** Works seamlessly on Smart TVs, Android, iOS, Firestick, MAG, and more.

For users who want a future-proof solution, **IPTVGEAR** defines what the **Best IPTV 2026** should look like.

# In-Depth Breakdown: Optimizing Your 2026 Experience

To understand why **IPTVGEAR** is the premier choice, we have analyzed the core components that make a service ""the best"" in today's market.

# Best IPTV for Sports (Focus: Super Bowl 2026)

The primary reason people switch to **IPTVGEAR** is the sports. When the **Super Bowl** kicks off, millions of people are hitting servers simultaneously. Most providers buckle under this pressure, leading to the dreaded ""buffering"" circle.

**IPTVGEAR** utilizes **Anti-Freeze 10.0 Tech**, a proprietary server-side load balancing system. During my tests of the recent playoffs and the **Super Bowl**, there were zero loops and zero lag. They offer a native **60fps frame rate** on all major sports networks. This is critical; at 30fps, a football looks like a blurry mess across the screen. With **IPTVGEAR**, you see every blade of grass in crystal-clear 4K.

# Best IPTV Service

A ""Best IPTV Service"" isn't just about the number of channels; it’s about the **""Zapping"" Factor**. One of the biggest pet peeves is waiting 5 seconds for a channel to load. **IPTVGEAR** loads almost instantly (under 1 second), making it feel like a high-end hardware cable box. This responsiveness is what separates a premium service from a budget reseller.

# Best IPTV Provider

As a leading **Best IPTV Provider**, **IPTVGEAR** invests heavily in its backbone. Unlike smaller providers that rent space on overcrowded servers, **IPTVGEAR** owns its infrastructure. This allows them to offer 99.9% uptime, even during the most-watched global events.

# IPTV Subscription

When you purchase an **IPTV Subscription** from **IPTVGEAR**, you aren't just getting a login; you’re getting a ticket to a world of entertainment. Their subscription process is automated and instant. Within minutes of signing up, your M3U or Xtream Codes credentials arrive, allowing you to start watching immediately.

# IPTV Providers

The market is flooded with **IPTV Providers**, but most are gone within six months. **IPTVGEAR** has been a staple for over three years. This longevity is the ultimate ""trust signal"" in the industry. While others disappear with your money, **IPTVGEAR** continues to upgrade its VOD and channel lists.

# IPTV Streaming

Modern **IPTV Streaming** in 2026 requires high-bitrate HEVC/H.265 files. **IPTVGEAR** actually streams true 4K UHD. On an OLED or high-end QLED TV, the detail is incredible. You aren't seeing upscaled 720p; you are seeing the content as the creators intended.

# IPTV Service

A reliable **IPTV Service** must include a functional EPG (Electronic Program Guide). **IPTVGEAR** provides the most accurate EPG I’ve used. There are no ""No Information"" gaps—it shows you exactly what’s playing and what’s coming up next across all 18,000+ channels.

# IPTV Channels

With over 18,000 **IPTV Channels**, **IPTVGEAR** covers everything from US Locals and UK Sky Sports to international networks in French, Spanish, Arabic, and more. It is a truly borderless television experience.

# IPTV Packages

**IPTVGEAR** offers various **IPTV Packages** tailored to different needs. Whether you need a single connection for your living room or a multi-room setup for the whole family, their packages are flexible and transparent.

# IPTV Plans

The **IPTV Plans** provided by **IPTVGEAR** are designed for long-term value. While they offer monthly options for testing, their annual plans provide the best cost-to-performance ratio in the industry, often costing less than a single month of traditional cable.

# IPTV Deals

Keep an eye out for **IPTV Deals** during major holidays and sports seasons. **IPTVGEAR** often runs promotions leading up to the **Super Bowl**, making it the perfect time to lock in a premium subscription at a discount.

# IPTV Offers

New users can frequently find **IPTV Offers** that include free trials or bonus months. **IPTVGEAR** stands behind its product, often allowing users to test the server stability before committing to a full plan.

# IPTV Price

When evaluating **IPTV Price**, you have to look at what you get. For the price of a couple of coffees, **IPTVGEAR** gives you 18,000+ channels and 80,000+ VOD titles. It is, quite simply, the best value in modern entertainment.

# IPTV Service 2026

The standard for an **IPTV Service 2026** is much higher than it was even two years ago. **IPTVGEAR** meets these standards by offering 8K ready streams and AI-integrated search functions within their custom apps.

# IPTV Subscription 2026

A quality **IPTV Subscription 2026** must be ""set and forget."" You shouldn't have to constantly refresh your playlist or contact support. **IPTVGEAR** updates its servers in the background, so your favorite channels are always there when you turn on the TV.

# Best IPTV for Movies

If you want to cancel your Netflix, Disney+, and HBO Max subscriptions, **IPTVGEAR** is the **Best IPTV for Movies**. Their library of 80,000+ titles is updated daily. If a movie hits digital platforms on a Tuesday, it’s usually on **IPTVGEAR** in 4K by Wednesday.

# Best IPTV for Live TV

For those who want a true ""live"" feel, **IPTVGEAR** is the **Best IPTV for Live TV**. The channel switching is seamless, the local news coverage is comprehensive, and the stability during primetime hours is unmatched.

# Premium IPTV Service

Finally, **IPTVGEAR** qualifies as a **Premium IPTV Service** because it focuses on quality over quantity. While they have a massive list of channels, they ensure that the ""Premium"" categories (Sports, Cinema, Kids) are always the highest bitrate and most stable.

# My Pro Setup for 2026

To get the best results from **IPTVGEAR**, your hardware matters as much as your provider. Here is the setup I used to achieve a flawless **Super Bowl** experience:

* **Device:** Nvidia Shield Pro or Firestick 4K Max (Gen 2). Avoid built-in Smart TV apps; they are often too slow for massive 2026 playlists.
* **Player:** **TiviMate Premium** (using Xtream Codes API). It handles the massive channel lists of **IPTVGEAR** without crashing and offers a professional interface.
* **Internet:** At least 50 Mbps is recommended for stable 4K streaming. Always use an Ethernet cable if possible.

# Final Verdict

Stop chasing $20 ""lifetime"" deals—they are scams. If you want a reliable **Best IPTV 2026** solution that will actually stay online when the **Super Bowl** starts, the choice is clear.

**IPTVGEAR** delivers bulletproof Live Sports, a massive 4K Cinema library, and the stability that modern viewers demand. It has been the leader for three years for a reason.

Now, I understand that the design maintains your current grind setting (which is great, Eureka's do this also) but I'm more interested in how uniform/precise the burr alignment is with this system?


Curious if anyone who is deeper into the coffee weeds than I am, can assess this question based on the design (or first hand experience using the marker test, etc.)

1r2uipt,https://www.reddit.com/r/tulum/comments/1r2uipt/things_to_know_about_tulum/,Things to know about Tulum,"Went on a 4 day trip with my partner. Here’s things that were good to know/useful. I cook professionally so hold on for the food review.

- We stayed on the outskirts of central Tulum which was cool but also a little distant from everything but all the rides were cheap and all the food that was good was never too far, and we were close to cenotes. We were able to use the bikes with the Airbnb to get around as well. Was cool to actually see the town up close that way. 
- Indrive helped so much. Those taxis will be trying to rip you off, especially if they know you’re not from there so Indrive is nice so you can meet them in the middle price wise and literally go anywhere. 
- If you’re on a budget? Skip the beach clubs and hit the ruins. It’s connected to a public beach so just walk in prepared with towels and etc and grab a snack or drink from a neighboring bar without the full commitment of a beach club fee. 
-Gran cenote was pricey but kinda worth it given the goggles and the fact you could access two different cenotes. 
We walked to a nearby cenote (rancho san Agustín ) and they had like three different natural cenotes and animals to look at. 

- The people were also so kind and friendly. We are a black lesbian couple and we didn’t feel uncomfortable once. 
My only bad experience was when I was trying to get change/make a purchase at 711 and the lady straight up lied and said she didn’t have change and I couldn’t buy anything with my cash. I figured something else out so no biggie but yeah. That and people trying scam you entering ruins. 
So if you’re part of our demographic, don’t even worry :) you’re good. 


Food highlights:
Taqueria Don Temo- super local spot in the neighborhood. Kind of like a street cart that specializes in all parts of the cow. Excellent tacos and don’t skip the accoutrements (spicy pickled onions, radish and lime). Excellent quesabirria and I would drink both their consommés casually.  Juices are good too and excellent value, I’m about to leave a google review soon and I never do. 
Don cafeto- one of the taxi drivers recommended this one for a real Yucatán breakfast. They have an Aztec breakfast special. Around 260 pesos and it’s enough for two. Comes with orange juice and coffee. We went there twice. They also have live music depending on the time of day and an excellent spread of marinated carrots and jalepenos. 
El agavero- this is your slightly more upscale spot but so worth it. Excellent service, cocktails were way better than in the states as well as their house distilled mezcal with cricket salt. Great ambiance and great and creative food. Beef tacos are a must have and the ceviche was good too. 

Now with this said we did eat at other spots and I’m not so quick to leave a bad review after going just once so I will simply leave a warning that some places might let you down or have you leave feeling a little ripped off. Just know your good places well and stick to them and go into places with an open mind because my preferences might not align with yours and that’s okay!

1r2uidz,https://www.reddit.com/r/Millennials/comments/1r2uidz/eat_your_fiber_followup_to_yesterdays_post_more/,"""Eat Your Fiber"" follow-up to yesterday's post (more info, deeper dive!)","There [was a great PSA posted yesterday about fiber, and I just wanted to keep this fiber train going.](https://old.reddit.com/r/Millennials/comments/1r28qfk/guys_please_start_eating_fiber/).

Fiber isn't just this thing that pushes food through your intestines. Its benefits go way beyond what most people realize!

Legit, though. Fiber is immensely underrated. I love this shit, so let me help give some Fiber Facts:

- Dietary fiber breaks down into Soluble and Insoluble Fiber.
- Insoluble fiber generally passes through the gut and is largely unabsorbed, but contributes to gut motility and a cleaning of the intestines (still important).
- Soluble fiber helps with absorption of nutrients, slow digestion down (more nutrients are absorbed), regulate the insulin response to sugars, etc. (huge reason why UPFs are so much worse for you than, say, sugar in a whole fruit).
- Fiber helps to regulate satiety and hunger hormones (yes, this is a huge part of the natural way GLP-1 is stimulated in your body)
- Pre-biotics and Fiber are more or less the same thing (with maybe the additional inclusion of resistive starches)
- Good (read: vital) gut bacteria feeds off soluble fiber.

Bacteria that consumes this fiber, which then produces what are called SCFAs - Short Chain Fatty Acids that are absorbed by the body and positively benefit many parts of the body including several organs like the brain. 

To reiterate: A huge plus with fiber is weight control. If you drink say sugary soda, your receptors will not process that amount of calories the way it would, say, eating the same amount of sugar with fiber in whole fruits. Not only would it be difficult to consume the same amount of calories in whole fruit, but the fiber (that contributes 0 to calories) helps trigger proper feedback (Leptin, Ghrelin) with your body to feel more ""full"" for longer. So you may consume the same calories, but you wouldn't be hungry as quickly.

**Not all soluble fiber is the same.**

There is:

- Beta-glucans
- Pectins
- Guar gum
- Mucilage
- Psyllium
- Inulin
- Oligofructose
- Glacto-oligosaccharides
- Raffinose

Mostly found in fruits, vegetables, nuts, seeds, and whole grains. Aim to diversify your diet and to eat them all.

**Overall Ways Reduce colorectal cancer risk (and ultimately many others):**

- Cut alcohol
- Cut tobacco
- Reduce Ultra-processed foods (and eat Whole Foods)
- Reduce red meat intake
- Increase foods high in antioxidants (e.g., blueberries, green salads, coffee & green tea, tomatoes cooked or otherwise)
- Increase fiber (green bananas, legumes/lentils, blueberries, raspberries, etc.)
- Exercise at least moderately

Thus, more fiber reduces colorectal cancer risk. More fiber helps reduce the risk of diabetes. More fiber helps reduce high cholesterol levels. More fiber promotes weight-loss. Fiber good and for all intents it should be considered essential.

Curious what else I can do for her.","As the title says my partner is a nurse and spends 2 days at the hospital for practicum, 3* days doing long lectures in courses, labs, etc. grading and stuff each night. 

I occasionally send her flowers to her office which she enjoys. I booked her a massage for next week and ill be attempting to book additional ones for her on a recurring schedule if she enjoys it. 

Shes not into manicures or pedicures, she hates shopping but I tend to shop for her which she likes. 

Hobbies include tv shows, running (she was marathon training prior to having some exercise related injuries) so now just walking every evening. and she loves gardening. 

Hospital days she's up at 430, I make her breakfast and get her coffee ready. 

Grading seems to be the biggest time consumer, and prepping for lectures of course. A year ago I got her a new laptop when her last one crashed. She likes to work at the kitchen table, we dont have a desk in the house. I bought her a desk but she never used it lol.. Im fine with the kitchen table being used as a work space but she deserves a place to store her books and tablet and briefcase. so maybe a hutch or something? idk. 

# Ideas I'm considering: 

1. making sure her car is clean and all her stuff is ready so she has an easier morning

2. she refuses to carry a lunch kit to the hospital bc she says its too cumbersome and she's too busy. but she's a type one diabetic so I really want her to eat. maybe a super slim lunch kit? her current lunch pack is a big square one lol.

3. recurring massage appts

4. some teacher items like new pens and notepads for her office

5. ??? 

One problem is she isn't a \*things\* person but I know she's practical so im trying to figure what's a good compromise.

Has anyone actually gotten better from this?","I’m 19M and I honestly feel like I’ve been going downhill for years, especially after my first sleep paralysis episode. Before that I wasn’t some genius student, but I could at least sit down, study and function normally. After that, my grades started slipping and I began zoning out a lot in class. Over time my attention span became almost nonexistent. Now I can’t focus on reading or listening for more than a minute unless it’s something extremely interesting. I make detailed plans in my head but never follow through. I start learning skills and quit within days once the excitement fades or I notice a flaw. If I don’t see quick progress or money potential, I lose interest completely. I doom scroll 12 to 14 hours a day and stay in bed most of the time. I’ve never felt disciplined. I talk loudly, interrupt people, overexplain things and daydream constantly, making scenarios in my head. I zone out even during prayers and only pray after my parents remind me repeatedly. I forget simple things like my keys but remember random details like exact conversations from years ago. I’m emotional, impulsive, overthink everything, can’t handle criticism well, and my mood can change within seconds. My friends say I can be rage baited instantly. I want things perfect and probably have OCD traits. I often act first and think about consequences later. Even before anxiety got bad I struggled with focus, but after it everything became much worse.

My anxiety feels very physical. I get chest tightness, heart palpitations, random body shivers and internal shaking. During arguments my whole body trembles, and even after it’s over I stay on edge, scanning every road and every person like something bad is about to happen. It feels like my brain is constantly in surveillance mode. I’m scared to drive because I think I’ll crash into someone. I’m afraid of stray dogs biting me. When I walk outside I sometimes feel detached and not fully present, and I trip over small things. My sleep is terrible. I rarely sleep more than 4 to 5 hours and it never feels refreshing. My brain just doesn’t shut off. When I’m about to sleep I get sudden falling sensations or feel like the bed is moving. I’ve had multiple sleep paralysis episodes. After the first one my academic performance dropped and never really recovered. Heavy bass music energizes me a lot, but sad music pulls my mood down fast. I’m not good at sports like cricket or football, and even in e sports I react slowly and get eliminated quickly. My confidence has taken a big hit.

Medication hasn’t been straightforward either. I’ve been on Reline, an SSRI, for 15 days and haven’t noticed any change yet. I tried alprazolam for two days. The first day I slept after about an hour. The second day I couldn’t sleep even after three hours. Ritalin once made me fall asleep for about 20 minutes. Vyvanse increased my physical anxiety symptoms like palpitations and tension. Tea and coffee also make me more anxious. It honestly feels like my nervous system is stuck in fight or flight mode and my brain never powers down. I feel like I’m failing in different areas of life and slowly declining. I just want to know if anyone has dealt with this kind of mix of anxiety, ADHD type symptoms, OCD traits, constant hypervigilance, sleep problems and emotional dysregulation and actually improved. What helped long term? Did you focus on anxiety first or ADHD first? I don’t want to just be sedated. I want to feel stable and functional.

I just want to live life as a normal person. I want to grow as others of my age but I don't think that I would be able to do it. As I've heard that anxiety still exists even if you try to control it and ADHD is not curable.

I thought I’d share some reflections on my progress since moving away from Wegovy. I’m 39, and after a few years of weight fluctuations, injuries, and home renovations, I’ve managed to get back under the 100kg mark through a more controlled, ""manual"" approach.

For those interested, here’s the breakdown of the transition and the logic I’m using to keep the momentum going.

# The Wegovy Experience

I started Wegovy in early 2024 at 109kg. Within four months, I hit a low of 99.4kg. However, a football injury—combined with a sedentary lifestyle—led to a plateau and eventually a climb back to 106kg.

I’ve done three stints on the medication in total, reaching a 1.0mg dose. By the final stint, the side effects became a genuine deterrent: tender skin, indigestion, and a general ""feverish"" feeling. While the drug is effective, I found that for me, the cost and the physical toll weren't sustainable long-term.

# Understanding the Numbers

After calculating my **TDEE (Total Daily Energy Expenditure)**, I realised that at 177cm and 105kg, my metabolism is quite unforgiving. While some guides suggest a much higher intake, my basal metabolic rate is around 2,000 calories. If I eat the standard recommended daily amount, I gain weight. Simple as that.

To see results, I’ve had to be quite strict with my intake:

* **Target:** 1,700 calories per day.
* **Protein:** Increased from roughly 50g to **150g per day** (approx. 1.5g per kg of body weight).
* **Activity:** I remain largely sedentary due to recurring injuries, so the focus is almost entirely on nutrition.

# Strategy: ""Gamifying"" the Diet

I’ve found that weight loss is more manageable when you treat it as a data-driven challenge. I’m currently six weeks into a fresh push:

* **Starting Weight:** 103.8kg
* **Current Weight:** 99.6kg
* **Goal:** 95kg (5 weeks remaining)

I find motivation in ""seeing the 8""—aiming for those incremental drops (like 98.9kg) to maintain a positive mindset even when daily weights fluctuate.

# Practical Tactics

1. **Semi-Intermittent Fasting:** I skip breakfast and stick to coffee with a splash of low-fat milk. It’s a mental shift; once you realise you only need to wait until lunch to feel satisfied, the ""hunger"" becomes easier to ignore.
2. **The ""Free"" Veggie Rule:** I treat vegetables as zero-calorie items. The fibre and volume are essential for satiety, and the caloric density is so low that I don't find it worth tracking them meticulously.
3. **Ingredient-Led Meal Prep:** Instead of prepping identical finished meals, I prep **ingredients**. I’ll cook a large batch of lean mince or roast peppers and onions, then store them separately. This allows for a ""pick and mix"" approach—one night it’s a taco bowl, the next it’s a salad—which prevents the boredom that usually kills a diet.

# Final Thoughts

Managing food is a skill. By cooking responsibly, you know exactly what’s in your meals and can control portions without guesswork. It’s also significantly more cost-effective. If you can gamify the process—trying to find the highest protein value for the lowest cost and calorie count—it actually becomes quite engaging.

I’m currently down about 4kg in six weeks and feeling far more in control than I did when I was relying solely on the injections.

I had been jinxed my entire life-until Ellsworth Farrell took me in. 

He took care of everything for me, spoiling me rotten. 

When I said I wanted to see the Northern Lights, he booked a glass cabin in Scandinavia and stayed with me through the bitter cold all night.

The moment Ellsworth stepped out, he noticed my tear-filled eyes. He paused, then quickly walked over. 

Wiping the corner of my eye with his thumb, he asked, “It’s your birthday. What’s wrong? Why are you crying?” 

I shook my head and forced a smile. “I just watched a touching movie.” 

His expression softened a little. With a faint smile, he reached for my phone. “Let me see what movie made you cry. I’ll have it blacklisted.” 

I instinctively pulled back. Just then, his phone rang. 

His expression changed instantly. When he answered, his tone turned incredibly gentle. “Yes. You’re still up? 

“Don’t be scared. I’ll be right there.” 

His gaze turned icy after he hung up. Then he offered a flimsy excuse. “Sorry. I have a last-minute business gathering. Wait for me, honey. I’ll be right back and cut the cake with you. 

I lowered my lashes without a word. 

I had heard it clearly-it was his fiancee, Maxine. 

A bad dream had startled her awake, and she wanted him with her. 

His footsteps faded, then grew closer again as he returned. 

He leaned toward my neck, but instead of kissing me like he used to, he reached up and yanked off the emerald necklace I was wearing.

“One of the business partners is an emerald enthusiast. This could help break the ice.” 

“That one’s different…” 

My grandmother had pressed the necklace into my hand before she passed away, saying it would keep me safe. 

I reached for it, but Ellsworth caught my wrist and shoved me into the corner of the sofa, his face dark. 

“Bertha, don’t make a scene right now. I’m in a hurry. Cut it out.” 

The edge of the coffee table dug into my side, sending a sharp pain through my waist. By the time I struggled to stand, Ellsworth was already at the entryway. 

Biting my lip hard, I whispered to his back, “Ellsworth, let’s end this.” 

His body went rigid. Then he scoffed over his shoulder, cold and dismissive. “Where could you possibly go without me? Bertha, you’ve been with me for five years. You know how much I hate that playing- hard-to-get act. 

“It’s your birthday today, so I’ll let it slide. Just wait here and behave.” 

He waited, expecting my usual meek compliance. 

When it didn’t come, anger flared across his face. He clenched his fists and stormed out, slamming the door so hard the walls trembled. 

I took a deep breath and slumped back onto the sofa. As I stared at the cake for a long, long time, memories came flooding back. 

On my nineteenth birthday, I had accidentally knocked over a shelf while working part-time at a convenience store and had to pay for it with half a month’s salary.

\- 1 serving/14g (or desired amount) PB2 powder 

\- 2 tsp sugar-free jam (I remember Good Good’s but any works !!)

\- 1 cup, slightly less than a cup brewed coffee

\[optional cheese cold foam:\]

\- 1 lite laughing cow cheese wedge OR 1/2 serving fat-free/low-fat cream cheese

\- 2ish tbsp of cold water 

\- zero-sugar maple syrup or your desired zero cal sweetener

first, whisk the pb and jam with the hot coffee in a cup. grab another cup/small bowl and whisk together the cheese, water, and sweetener of choice if adding. once you whisk it and it becomes cold-foam texture (adjust measurements as needed to reach your desired consistency), pour on top of the pb & j coffee and done ! if you’re feeling fancy, top with some fat-free whipped cream :)",5,1770905015.0,Volumeeating,5,0.73,False

I’m a guy looking for a budget-friendly perfume to wear on a date.

Nothing too loud or overpowering — just something that smells good up close and feels nice for a casual date (coffee / dinner type).

Would love suggestions that work well in Indian weather too.

 I’m asking both men and women:
What perfumes do you genuinely like on men?
The kind that actually smells really good when someone walks past.

Chapter 1 

I had been jinxed my entire life-until Ellsworth Farrell took me in. 

He took care of everything for me, spoiling me rotten. 

When I said I wanted to see the Northern Lights, he booked a glass cabin in Scandinavia and stayed with me through the bitter cold all night. 

When someone at the gallery mocked my clumsy paintings, he flew back from London and bought the entire wall just to hang my doodles. 

Even his childhood friend would joke, “Ells, out with your puppy again?” 

He would merely arch a brow and reply, “Yeah. Got a problem?” 

Life with him was bliss. I even dreamed of the day he would slide a wedding ring onto my finger. 

On my twenty-fourth birthday, I held a pregnancy test I’d hidden for a week, ready to surprise him when he got home. 

But as I reached the door to his study, I overheard his hushed voice on the phone. “I’ll enter a marriage of convenience with Maxine Graham at the beginning of next month. Bertha’s just for fun. She’s not wife material.”

Those ones are for regular cups of coffee, they can’t be put into the microwave, they can’t be put into the dishwasher and they must be handwashed.

I have one solid grey coffee cup that makes you think “2003 and grunge maroon cafe” if you saw it and it only gets used when I make a coffee thats a bit fancier. Right now my a bit fancier coffee is from a Nespresseo my mom has. This one can be put in the microwave, can be put in the dishwasher and doesn’t need to be handwashed as there isn’t anything on it but the solid color.

Then there’s the other coffee I have like Starbucks, the canned ones so on.

With that said…

How do you go about the first two for you?

I’m curious.



I am also of the mindset for kitchens that the only appliances that are ALWAYS out 24/7 is the stove, oven, microwave,  coffee  machine and coffee canisters filled with coffee grounds if you have canisters. The other appliances are always put away and only brought out when need them. So how I deal with this is eh sometimes. Can I have your thoughts on this too?

For those of you who’ve worked at Starbucks and made the drink, how much cold brew goes into it?  The drink is good, but what I get varies widely from store to store.  Either it’s pale and very sweet with just a little bit of cold brew and I end up needing to rush and grab another coffee in the afternoon.  Or it’s really dark and I can taste lots coffee, with just a small top of cream.  And everything in between.  Almost like there’s no standard way to make the drink among stores.  

I just order my drinks however they come on the menu, no customizations ever.  Is there a way to order it to get the right amount of cold brew each time?  I’d rather have it darker than lighter.  Too little coffee and I get a migraine by the afternoon and I’m done for the day.

Chapter 1 

I stumbled across my boyfriend Jacob Gilman’s private alt account by accident. 

He’d posted, agonizing over what birthday gift to get for his girlfriend. 

I smiled to myself. 

Every birthday, Jacob would go to great lengths to sneak a peek at my wishlist. 

But after five years together, my expectations had changed. 

Now, what I wanted was something straight out of a movie-a surprise proposal, friends and family gathered around, with Jacob down on one knee in front of me. 

“Why not give her a romantic proposal?” 

I left the comment anonymously. 

Five minutes later, he replied. 

“Thanks, but I already proposed to my little princess last Friday. 

“She was so happy.”

I sat there stunned for a moment. 

I clicked back into his profile.

A man stood on the balcony, and faint morning light draped softly around him. 

On the wooden shelf beside him sat several of the succulents and roses I’d been growing myself. 

I had taken that picture myself. 

That day, I’d been burning up with fever, and Jacob had stayed up all night taking care of me-wiping me down with a warm towel, changing my sweat-soaked pajamas, gently offering me sips of water to ease my dry throat. 

When I woke up groggily, I saw Jacob standing on the balcony, stretching. 

I snapped the photo casually, teasing him that his silhouette looked just like Popeye. 

My fingertips tingled. 

I scrolled back up to reread his reply. 

“Already proposed to my little princess last Friday.” 

Below it was a new comment from the account. 

“I’ve made up my mind. I’ll throw her a birthday party. I’ll book flights and 

a hotel and invite her friends from all over the country to celebrate together.” 

“Can’t wait to see her cry tears of joy.”

One apartment per floor, over 600 square meters each, with river views. 

Even an unfinished unit cost close to 50,000 dollars. 

That time Jacob and I went camping by the river, I lay back in a lounge chair, staring across at NY Garden. 

“Jacob, do you think we’ll ever suddenly win the lottery ten times in a row, with an NY Garden apartment thrown in as a bonus? 

“If that day comes, you can set up a gaming room, and I’ll have a little garden. 

“Oh, and I heard the balcony’s wider than a running track. Once we have kids, they could ride bikes out there.” 

Jacob listened quietly, eyes lowered, flipping the skewers in his hands. 

Finally, he chuckled softly. 

“Wishful thinking.” 

Back then, I thought he was laughing at my habit of daydreaming about winning the lottery. 

Turns out, he was laughing at me at the idea that I could marry him, have children with him.

Probably a good thing I didn't watch it for my own sanity and productivity. I watched Jack Smith's testimony and it was nothing but lie after lie and a screaming match from batshit Republicans.

So I wasn't surprised when I saw clips coming out and it was more of the same thing... scratch that- IT WAS MUCH MUCH WORSE!

Bondi and Patel are outright lying to the public. They need to be rotting in fucking prison for their crimes. While the constituents that voted for this criminal admin may be stupid many of us aren't. In fact, I'd also argue that even if we aren't the smartest people in the room, the VAST MAJORITY of the American public at least recognizes the blatant evil crimes being committed in this cover-up because we actually have fucking morals.

Personally, I would not have been able to stay as calm as Coffee while analyzing this shit. Hell, while watching Jack Smith's hearing I imagined myself a few times smashing my TV into fucking pieces. 

Anyways, shoutout to the people who sat through that shit, made the clips, and also to Coffee for venting what everyone is really thinking in a way that's helpful!",46,1770904354.0,Coffeezilla_gg,1,0.99,False

I've been drinking a lot of tea and coffee lately. Always like new suggestions for both. I'm trying to slowly get into doing more and more homesteading. I've started making my own breads and want to start making different jelly when it's warm enough for my berry bushes to produce

I'm into video games, too. I mainly play Overwatch, Marvel Rivals, Valorant, and Ark Suvival Ascended. Love playing Pokemon games and doing some Pokémon card collecting, too. I've been getting into playing more survival games than shooting games lately. I also built my PC to play on a couple of years ago.

I'm down to chat about any random stuff you like to chat about. Always up to try or learn about new hobbies. ",1,1770904322.0,MeetNewPeopleHere,0,1.0,False

Coffee no longer worked as a hunger suppressant and instead began to make me ravenous (black or milk/sugar).

Also, mid-afternoon, I would get bizarre alcohol cravings. 30+ pounds later I decided to stop coffee and replace it with red label tea and the feeling subsided.

context is he has a girl best friend 31f kira and he has always sold it as she is basically family bc they met in college and she helped him through his dads death and i tried to respect that even though i hate the whole girl best friend thing bc it always turns into weird emotional spouse behavior and i did not want to be the insecure girlfriend who polices friendships lmao

at first i played nice i invited her places i did the friendly smile thing i asked about her job i even bought her a little candle once bc she said she liked vanilla and i thought ok if i make this normal then it will feel normal and not like im in some competition i never agreed to

but the vibe was always off she texts him constantly like good morning did you eat send a pic i miss you and he says thats just her personality and she is just like that with everyone which is not true bc she is not sending his guy friends mirror selfies from bed at 11 pm like come on

anyway 2 weeks ago she calls him crying saying her roommate moved out and she feels unsafe living alone and asked if she could stay with us for a bit and i immediately said i said i am not comfortable with a long term house guest i said she can stay with her sister or we can help her find a short rental and i even offered to chip in bc i felt bad for her situation

my boyfriend got defensive fast like i had kicked a puppy he said i lack empathy he said i am being cold to someone in crisis and he promised it would only be a weekend and that she would stay in the spare room and that he would keep things respectful so i caved bc i felt guilty and bc i did not want to be painted as the villain

she shows up with a full suitcase and a tote bag and a pillow and a whole skincare routine like she is moving in and the first night i hear them laughing in the kitchen at 1 am while he is making her tea and she is perched on the counter swinging her legs and i just stood there half asleep thinking why do i feel like the third wheel in my own apartment

then she starts leaving her stuff everywhere toothbrush next to mine hair in the shower her makeup bag on our sink and my boyfriend says i am being territorial and that it is just a bathroom and i tried to be calm i tried to use i feel statements i tried not to accuse anyone of cheating bc i know how that makes people shut down

the weekend ends and she does not leave 

she keeps saying she is looking for places but she is also ordering packages to our address like vitamins a phone case and then a lamp for the guest room bc it helps her anxiety like what do you mean a lamp you are not supposed to be decorating here

i bring it up again and i say i need a timeline i need an end date i need our home to feel like our home and he says i am making it weird and that i am projecting and that kira needs support and he hits me with the controlling girlfriend thing which makes me feel insane bc i am not telling him he cannot have friends i am telling him i do not want his friend living with us indefinitely

then last night happened and this is what pushed me over

 i came home early from work bc my meeting got canceled and i walk in and they are on the couch under the same blanket watching a movie and i swear i watched him jump up like he got caught and she just sits there smiling at me like im the guest and not her

i did not scream i did not throw anything i just went numb and went into the bedroom and stared at the wall for a while which is embarrassing bc i felt like a teenager and i started thinking about the time my mom used to let her friends crash on our couch when i was a kid and the whole house smelled like cigarettes and old coffee and i hated it and i hated feeling powerless and i realized i feel the same thing now except im almost thirty and i pay rent

so i told him straight up i said this is a red flag for me and i am done pretending it is fine i said kira has 48 hours to figure it out either she stays with family or she finds somewhere else but she cannot keep living here and if he cannot back me up then i will talk to the landlord about breaking the lease and i will leave

he called me heartless he said i am giving ultimatums he said i am jealous and insecure and he said i am basically accusing him of cheating and i told him no i am responding to behavior that would make anyone feel crazy and then he said kira is crying now and i made her feel unsafe and that i am the reason she is spiraling and he said wow i did not know you were this kind of person

now i am sitting here wondering if i crossed a line bc i know ultimatums are messy and i know she might actually be struggling and my boyfriend is acting like i am some monster for wanting my own home back

If you find yourself in the holy city of Madinah and you’re looking for more than just a quick caffeine fix, you have to check out **Tyam Cafe (تيام كافيه)**. It’s one of those spots that perfectly blends local heritage with a high-end specialty coffee experience.

The Story Behind the Name

What makes Tyam unique is its deep connection to the geography of Madinah. The cafe is named after Mount Tyam, which stands proudly near the historic Mount Uhud. Even their logo tells a story—it’s inspired by a specific flower that blooms on the slopes of Uhud and Tyam during the spring. This flower is a local icon in the Madinah region, and seeing it in their branding adds a beautiful, authentic touch.

The Coffee Craft

For the coffee nerds out there, they don't take shortcuts. Tyam is meticulous about their process:

* **Sourcing:** They are highly selective about the beans they ""pick up,"" ensuring they only work with top-tier crops.
* **Roasting:** They handle their own roasting to bring out the specific profiles of the beans, ensuring every cup—from a flat white to a V60—is fresh and balanced.

The Menu (Don't skip the sweets!)

While the coffee is the star, the food menu is a serious contender. They have a mix of classic French pastry and local fusion:

* **Waffle with Ajwa Dates:** This is a must-try. Using the famous Ajwa dates of Madinah on a crisp waffle is a genius local twist. 🧇🌴
* **Madeleines & Cheesecake:** Their Madeleines are light and airy, and the cheesecake is incredibly creamy.
* **Signature Ice Tea:** If you’re not in the mood for coffee, their Ice Tea is one of the most refreshing drinks in the city, especially given the Madinah heat.

The Vibe

It’s a great place for academics, professionals, or anyone who appreciates a thoughtful, quiet atmosphere. It feels like a space built by people who actually love coffee culture and their city’s history.

Everyone I talk to about it is always like why don’t you make the first move or ask if you can join them on their coffee run? (they don’t invite me and honestly felt like most of them never really tried to get know me past my first couple days.)

Thing is in my middle and high school days I was bullied relentlessly if I tried to do that. Even joining a group and trying to join a conversation someone would go “whoa whoa! Who said you could talk?!” Ino now the guy was an asshole and def one of my recurring bullies where I wish I could go back and say fuck you to. But those experiences have made it hard to interact with others or feel awkward trying to join conversations. Sometimes I’ll hang by groups trying to be a part of it but am just completely ignored if I’m not there. Or worse, they ask if I have a question and don’t even think I want to be included (hence me interpreting it as them icing me out and basically telling me to take a hike if I don’t have a question).

It doesn’t help that my position is mostly solitary and when I’m at work I focus on work. I’m not really one to go around lollygagging with others and I think that isn’t helping. Heck they show more interest in the new girl and I don’t know if it’s because they don’t like me or if it’s because her job involves more interaction with others than mine does. 

I feel like the isolation does burn me out a bit and wish I could work remote but I’m trying to not let that get me down because I do need this job even if it overstimulates to the point of exhaustion. I have like maybe one office friend but she’s all the way on the other side of the building and we don’t get the option to talk much unless I go out of my way to see her. 

Idk if this more of a rant or not but I just feel like I need to know if other people experience this and if they have tips for getting over it.

I was talking to someone here in this community. The conversation was flowing well — we were talking about life, our daily routines, and who we are with other people. Slowly, it became more personal.
I said that I am an African Muslim woman, single, 20 years old.
I told him he could look at my profile picture — it’s really me.

Like I’ll look at my planner, panic, and decide I’m going to do a huge grind week, and then by day three my brain is basically steamed broccoli. The annoying part is I’m not even slacking, I’m sitting at my desk a lot. I just don’t think the hours are turning into actual learning. This week I tried to be “serious” and did a strict routine: wake up, coffee, start at 9, timer on, breaks scheduled, no phone, the whole productivity cosplay. I even downloaded one of those aesthetic study timers because it made me feel like a calm forest creature who knows what they’re doing. It looked nice, but the reality was me staring at notes and feeling my attention slide off the page. After like 6 hours, I could barely explain what I studied in the first 2. And then at night I’d try to review and it felt like I was reading a stranger’s handwriting. I got a quiz back today and it was lower than when I studied way less, which is honestly humiliating. I think what’s happening is I’m spending a ton of time “organizing” and “rewriting” and “highlighting” because it feels productive, but it doesn’t stick. Flashcards help sometimes, but making them takes forever and then I avoid them because they feel like a small test every time. I tried Pomodoro, but I either ignore the breaks or I take a break and then vanish for 45 minutes. I also notice I’m scared to do practice questions because it exposes what I don’t know, so I stay in the safe zone of reading and summarizing. And then when the exam comes, surprise, my brain can’t pull the info out. So now I’m stuck because I don’t know how to reset without feeling like I wasted the last week. I have two big exams coming up and I need something that helps retention, not just time spent. If you had to rebuild your studying from scratch, what would you actually keep. Like, do you start with practice questions first and then patch the gaps, or do you do a quick pass of notes and then test yourself. How do you review without rereading everything 10 times. Also, how do you set a daily goal that’s not just “study 8 hours” but is still measurable. I feel like I’m doing a lot, but I’m not moving forward, and it’s making me  weirdly scared to even sit down and start because I already assume it won’t work.

**\[MANCHESTER MEET CUTE\] Chapter 1**

Welcome to Blissfield.

Not the town you'll eventually fall in love with.

Not yet.

Right now, Blissfield is still in its early stages — quiet suburban streets, freshly painted houses, families still learning each other's names, and traditions that are only just beginning to form. It's the kind of place where the mornings are peaceful, the neighbors wave often, and the town still feels small enough that everyone's stories will one day intertwine whether they plan to or not.

The people here are tightly knit. Loyal. Warm. Sometimes messy. Always deeply connected. This town is known for its breathtaking scenery, winding rivers, and sunsets that make you stop mid-sentence just to stare. But what will truly define Blissfield isn't the landscape.

It's the people.

Every story has a beginning.

And every town has the characters who shape it.

Right now, you're about to meet two of the very first. They're young. They don't know their importance yet. They don't realize how deeply their choices will ripple through this town over time.

But one day, they'll become part of the backbone of Blissfield's story — whether they're ready for that or not.

Meet Yairah Gomez-Mejilla — sixteen, Colombian-American, and freshly planted in Blissfield Town with her parents. Sweet but fiery, endlessly nurturing, and wickedly clever, her favorite subject was science, where her curiosity often got the better of her. She had dimples that appeared the second she smiled, warm hazel eyes that could sparkle with humor or flash with stubbornness, and soft brown curls with blonde highlights that bounced freely around her shoulders. She was quick on her feet, often running late, and carried a natural energy that drew attention whether she wanted it or not. But beneath her confidence and charm, there was a quiet intensity — a deep awareness of the world and the people in it. Yairah noticed things others didn't. She felt things others brushed off. And sometimes... that made new places feel overwhelming.

Her alarm clock blared, and she shot out of bed, scrambling through a lightning-fast shower before racing downstairs. A waffle in one hand, a glass of milk in the other, she practically launched herself onto her bike. Dodging traffic like a pro, she somehow made it to Blissfield High just before the last bell.

Bursting into class, she tripped over a student's backpack. Textbooks flew, papers scattered. A few students snickered. Yairah's cheeks flamed as she bent to gather her things, ready to disappear under the embarrassment, when a deep, warm voice cut through the chaos:

""Here, let me help.""

Her head snapped up, and time seemed to stutter for a heartbeat. Standing there was a tall, blonde, green-eyed guy, impossibly composed — but something about the way he looked at her made her stomach twist, and her heart do a little flip. Electricity shot through the room like the air itself had changed, small and sharp, tickling her senses.

Meet Zeke.

Seventeen, Danish, and the kind of guy who made people feel like they mattered. He was the quarterback of the football team, a star on the soccer field, an accomplished swimmer, and trained in karate and wrestling—but all of that barely defined him. Smart, humble, and impossibly kind, Zeke never sought the spotlight. Instead, he quietly noticed the people around him, making them laugh, feel seen, and feel better about themselves. Protective, emotionally aware, and effortlessly charming, he had a way of stepping in when someone needed him—as the girl crouched on the floor with her scattered books.

Her fingers froze on the scattered textbooks, and she felt her face warm, as if the tips of her ears were on fire. She noticed him noticing her, and her heart stuttered again. He smiled slightly, a teasing, bright curve of lips, and her breath hitched without her realizing.

Instead of the usual ""thanks,"" Yairah blurted, cheeks still heating:

Yairah: ""Umm... haha... do you help people a lot?""

He tilted his head, teasing but gentle. Zeke: ""No... only the ones who trip over backpacks and drop all their books.""

She caught herself laughing softly, even as her chest tightened with that something she couldn't name. Zeke's hand brushed briefly against hers while handing a notebook over, and it lingered a second too long, just enough to make the moment feel like the first spark of static electricity you feel when touching metal in winter.

She realized, with a small jolt, that her pulse was racing. And somehow, against all her attempts to stay composed, she wanted to look at him again.

Teacher: ""Alright, alright—settle down, everyone. Take your seats.""

Chairs scraped. Backpacks zipped. The room slowly quieted.

The teacher leaned against his desk, arms crossed.

Teacher: ""Welcome to the first day of your school year... and hopefully the last time I'll ever see most of your faces in this classroom.""

A ripple of laughter passed through the room.

He smirked slightly.

Teacher: ""I'm Mr. Martin, your Honors Biology III teacher this semester. And trust me—I don't like repeating introductions. So do us both a favor and just pass the class.""

More laughter. A few students exchanged looks like, Yeah... this teacher is definitely unhinged.

Mr. Martin glanced at his roster.

Teacher: ""We've got four new students joining us this year. When I call your name, please stand and give us a wave. Everyone else—try to look welcoming for at least five seconds.""

He read down the list.

""Cory Johnson.""

""Priscilla Pelvin.""

""Jessica Delware.""

Each stood briefly, earning polite applause.

""And finally... Yairah Gomez-Mejilla""

Yairah stood slowly, nerves buzzing. She offered a shy smile—and just like that, her dimples appeared, lighting up her face without her even trying.

Zeke froze.

Completely.

His friend Jake noticed immediately.

Jake leaned closer and whispered,

Jake: ""Bro... if you drool any harder, your textbooks will become a swimming pool for your pens.""

Zeke didn't look away.

Zeke (quietly): ""Relax.""

Jake smirked.

Jake: ""Relax? You've been relaxed around exactly zero girls since middle school. That smile you're doing? That's new.""

Zeke finally glanced at him, expression unreadable.

Zeke: ""She's just... different.""

Jake blinked.

Jake: ""Different how?""

Zeke leaned back in his chair, thinking for half a second too long.

Zeke: ""I don't know. She's smart. She's funny. She didn't even try and somehow she already owns the room.""

Jake studied him like he'd just confessed something serious.

Jake: ""Ohhh. This is bad.""

Zeke frowned.

Zeke: ""Why is that bad?""

Jake shook his head slowly.

Jake: ""Because this is the part where you pretend you don't care... and then care way too much.""

Zeke scoffed.

Zeke: ""I do not care 'way too much.'""

Jake grinned.

Jake: ""You learned her name in under ten minutes. That's a record. Last year it took you two weeks to remember your own lab partner.""

Zeke kicked his foot lightly under the desk.

Zeke: ""Shut up.""

Jake laughed under his breath.

Jake: ""I'm just saying... I give it three weeks before you're bringing her coffee and pretending it's 'no big deal.'""

Zeke glanced toward Yairah's seat again. Just once.

Then quietly:

Zeke: ""...Okay, maybe.""

Jake's eyes widened.

Jake: ""OH, so you admit it!""

Zeke shook his head, but he was smiling now.

Zeke: ""I admit nothing.""

Jake leaned back, satisfied.

Jake: ""Too late, bro. I'm emotionally invested now.""",0,1770903583.0,redditserials,0,0.33,False

I found these answers on quora and decided to share them for anyone interested. ❤.)

""Why gangstalkers recruit neighbors, why your neighbours remain silent and the manual.

The post had the following questions:

•	How do gangstalkers recruit neighbors

•	What does a manual gangstalking guide look like?

•	Why do the neighbors of gangstalking victims remain silent about the abuse that they witness?

(Found these answers from different social sites. I think my post is kinda crude but if your interested anyway, here it is).

How do gangstalkers recruit neighbors?

First answer: ""At least in my environment they don’t, i don't suffer from community gangstalking. Gangstalkers have people placed in a variety of neighborhoods already. Then they are activated. Or they at least recruit one or two of your neighbours, whom don't already like you. (They're assisting but the depth and length of involvement may depend). It’s hard for them to recruit “normal” people in a neighborhood with low churn that aren’t on their payroll. E.g. Paying for petrol.""

Second answer: ""They simply learnt it from another and etc. They usually know each other and basically its word of mouth which spreads quick as fire does. That person will tell his/hers circle of friends, those people will tell other circles of people etc. Everyone who is told about a target joins in, so on and so forth, kinda like the effects of dominos falling one after the other. However, even though they know each other they make out to a target they don't know each other.. (they are not intelligent) a target always KNOWS.. LOL.

It's actually sickening.. what they say about a target individual.. really horrid things that aren't even true.. They also ‘blacklist the target permanently..

God Bless.""

Third answer: ""It's simply the same as school yard bullying.. except they have the technology to get in touch with people everywhere… long story short… if you’re trying to improve your life, and people dont like it.. they want to pick on you. I always stood up to my bullies.

Its starts from very good intentions to cooperate with neighborhood watch, in order to “check out” new neighbor (s) , simply watching you as a part of community watch ( it’s not always hostile as lot of people present it) Then , they can be asked to perform street theater, they will make noise, disrupt sleep, walk in and out same time as you are, ring car horns every day same time and so on. The escalation is when you see petty crime done to neighbors just before you leave for trips, vacations and so on.

They use community watch groups who don’t take much convincing and am eager to “help"". Also, will use people on probation/parole, who cooperate out of fear or intimidation. Or they just tell people you're a terrorist, pedophile, general piece of crap, or that you shot JFK. Whatever…""

Fourth answer: ""

Lying

Threats

Bribery

Favors

Extortion

Blackmail

Al programs

I imagine there's more ways, but these are what I imagine they choose for getting people involved.""

Fifth answer: ""At least in my neighborhood my reputation d , it started with people telling lies about me and soon enough the entire block went from friendly to nasty, and I saw and heard two men who looked like detectives telling a neighbor that I was a thief and I leeched off of women and all of that.

Neighbors are no longer happy to see me, even though I’ve helped most of them out more than once. In my case it started with the drug dealer on my block bad mouthing me. to anyone who moved in and even people that I’d known turned away from me. I began to suspect police involvement as a lot of white guys showed up and were there often. This jumped out at me as before this I’d never seen a single non-black person come out of that house in the five years that we had lived on the same block. So she destroyed my reputation and now most people on the block are suspect. And let’s not worry here people, if I could prove any of that we’d have been in court by now. Unlike many liberals I don’t get violent without hard factual evidence …and even at that I would call the police on them or the state police if needs be. I’m not someone that gets all nasty without proof. But it still sucks.”

Sixth answer: ""A lot of perpetrators are generational. They are the children and relatives of ones who came before them. This is why it’s hard to get information about GangStalking to the general public from the perpetrators themselves. Family loyalty, perhaps a brain bit starting working and they find out they are indeed a criminal, lack of funds, fake education can’t find other ways to make a living etc.

Snitches. They think they’re working for the police or some other law enforcement. So they do what they do because of it. Might not know everything that is involved why and how. They just know their part.

Got To Be Special - These are individuals who like the Snitch don’t think they are a Snitch but believe they are working for law enforcement getting training and participation in the “big picture” Unlike the Snitch you can place these people “in the public” some what to do stuff. This is the high end GangStalker. Or they think they are.

The Foreigner - Recruited for a better life and a job that’s waiting. Will make more money in the UK/States, than they would at home. They don’t know anyone and won’t get caught up in GangStalking families and friends they know or who they are a part of.

Retarded in some form. The best job they will ever have and can make more money supposedly doing this than they would on a regular job if they can get one.

Low IQ, Belief in something, A Need to Make a Lot of money for others and willing to cross the line in criminality are the people they target for recruitment.""

What does a manual gangstalking guide look like?

First answer: ""Yes. In fact gangstalkers follow a textbook practice. This is why they don't come and fight you when you call them out. They believe in the process. (But i think it is shared through families and friends as well. It’s a lifestyle choice).

It could look something as basic as this:

Ohchr: Harassment tactics - Harassment techniques - \\\[https://www.ohchr.org/Documents/Issues/Torture/Call/Individuals/Harrassmenttechniques.pdf\\\](https://www.ohchr.org/Documents/Issues/Torture/Call/Individuals/Harrassmenttechniques.pdf)

And this explains community policing - https://www.ojp.gov/pdffiles/commp.pdf""

Second answers: ""I don't know for sure, but I can assume it would be beneficial for the perps. It would probably contain notes of what to do or things they have done. Maybe other networks who also stalk would contain numbers, websites, and email addresses. They probably share it around as a pdf file or word document.

I found target individuals website to be handy about it: https://www.targetedjustice.com/gangstalking---training-manual.html""

Third answer: ""I am not sure but it seems to follow a pattern and i guess technology is simply taught along with it, depending what particular type of gangstalking it is.

Why do the neighbors of gangstalking victims remain silent about the abuse that they witness?

First answer: ""Because there are some really vile people out there today. Nasty pieces of work that thrive on slander. Instead of getting their own house in order, they would rather concern themselves with other peoples. Most of them are jobless, bored stupid basically and stalking is the most exciting thing they have ever participated in ever.

Nosey curtain twitchers who sit there all day knowing exactly what the next door neighbours movements are. Do you want a laugh? One of the gang that was recruited in harassing me had got to be about 70. She from what I heard was an alcoholic. I knew something was not right with her as her face resembled a crumpled up map of the world. She was vile. This old spinster would stand underneath my window making her dog constantly bark. Just to annoy me. What made me laugh is she looked a right sad idiot stood there in some pink hoodie and wearing a baseball hat that she had turned backwards. She used to be an avid member of the local church too.

Absolute hypocrite. You would see her outside serving the free tea and coffee the church used to hand out, and then go home and gang stalk me. She offered me a cup once, I told her no as you might spit in it. She was stood there like some kind pillar of the community but was vile, absolutely vile. Another was this young mother, she used to get her small child to make silly noises as she walked up and down and down and up again past my property deliberately trying to wind me up. The list is endless. It is truly unbelievable how some folk act. Most do it for no rewards at all, simply for fun. They simply thrive on upsetting another.""

Second answer: ""Your neighbors remain silent about the Abuse because they are PAID to, 1- participate in the abuse, ie: slander, noise campaigns, role playing so you will pick up on key words, ALL your neighborhood is RECRUITED including the poor elderly, children are asked to participate, they usually use their own children, and actually train them, to be bullies, ie: play loud, kick and scream, yell out key words, told to color code themselves. These abusive Gangstalking Parents, who abuse the little mind of their own innocent children, should serve community time or be charged for corrupting the minds of their innocent little ones who are guided on how to abuse a T.I. TARGETED INDIVIDUAL.

They think no one will know, they seem like they are just acting normal but it goes far deeper then that. The parents, once they commit to the devil's, Narcissistic, psychopath's, plan to bully & abuse a target, in exchange for money, incentives, such as car rentals, expenses for colour coded clothes or articles, .. the Narc, Agents, will even offer to pay full house repairs, as long as noise campaigns continue. If, a T.I. rebels by mirroring back their stupidity, in colours or sounds, they get a neighbor to activate his chainsaw every time you open your windows!

Long story short, they are somehow convinced by the hideous lies from these pathological, mind controlled, liars, to spread a list of horrific lies, so horrible that ALL jump on the destructive band wagon, without realizing, they were mind controlled to follow the DEVIL'S, every command instead of saying, “ sorry boys and girls, this is none of my concern, instead, they take the cash and follow the code of silence. Get paid to destroy, the target, themselves and their communities. It’s the sickest most destructive PROGRAM, I HAVE EVER SEEN, or ever thought could leek, like black poison, across the planet!

When caught, ALL THESE SICK MINDS CONTROLLED BY THEIR HANDLERS, SHOULD BE LOCKED UP AND A HEFTY FINE OF 10,000, PER AGENT CAUGHT. THESE FUNDS SHOULD THEN BE GRANTED TO THE INNOCENT TARGETTED INDIVIDUAL, for the enormous and irreparable harm they have caused to ONE, unsuspecting Human targeted, for fun! Not for experimentation, (as they claim), they have experimented this evil program on thousands of innocent victims, many falsely locked away, deemed crazy, for rebelling against these criminal gang mobs! The abuse and the mental anguish, mental rape, they have caused on a target, is buried away, with no trace of these COVERT HARRASSMENTs taking place around the globe!

That, is the reason, no one speaks up! They are under a vow of silence, to keep all their demonic secrets, hidden.. until WE ARRIVED!

WE ARE THE 144000

…and so it shall come to pass!!""

Third Answer: ""more than lively, they are passively or actively involved. Remember, this is done to us by the earth powers that be. So, even though they know what they are doing is wrong, they know that the likelihood of them being charged and prosecuted is slim to none. However,“when I lay me down to sleep, I ask the Lord my soul to keep” may not happen for them..

If you are being gangstalked then your neighbors most likely are involved and participating in it.

They even move gangstalkers in all around the target to dew, monitor and harass.

They will pay any existing neighbors to participate or to move out.

In the rare case that a neighbor is not involved, they won’t do/say anything because they are probably either brainwashed or oblivious.

They also probably have been told lies about the target.(like they are a criminal/weirdo). So they think that the harassment is ok.

Or

Fear it will be done to them too. People in these small communities controlled by fear and false prophets usually are brainwashed into believing this is normal behavior. They are so sheltered from the outside world, they don’t know any different.""

Many people, even stalkers, do not know what is going on. They know they do illegal harassment to victims for favors, etc.; but may not even know when and who they are doing it to. They stay out of caring to continue getting favors, themselves.""

Fourth answer: ""Yes they do. They may be gas-lighting, pretending it is not happening. Everyone is in on it to a certain degree and may be told different things about you.

Gangstalking is a group of PMCs using techniques to control a community. Gangstalking is only one technique that is used.

PMCs use a technique to lead on and convince a victim that people are Gangstalking them with all kinds of outlandish types of harassment. They do this with a purpose—to drive the victim toward a fake psychosis that everyone will believe, including the victim; and that will ruin their social standing and ability to testify as a reliable person. The victim is driven to this by the influence used in the surveillance: sleep deprivation, dehydration, stress, and fear.

For instance, they will use constant influence and drive a victim to think people in white vehicles are driving by their house and gunning their motors to harass them.

The PMC already has a stalking friend with a white car that drives by the house everyday, anyway. The PMC gets the person to gun their motor through influence. The guy doesn't even know anything about the victim living there.

Then the PMC juices the victim with every bit of paranoia they can about white cars harassing them, following them, a gang of street theater people are screwing around in a certain color of Tshirts, etc.

The victim’s perception is altered to see things the way the PMCs want them to see things and to be angry or afraid.

So. The answer.

Many people, even stalkers, do not know what is going on. They know they do illegal harassment to victims for favors, etc.; but may not even know when and who they are doing it to. They stay out of caring to continue getting favors, themselves.""

Why do gang stalkers want you to not tell anyone what they are doing to you?

Post found on Quora:

First answer: ""I'd like to preface this with having no expectations in life or highly trained in personal mastery- physical response isn't dependent on environment. The lashing out is ill advice for most, I simply like playing with them and hope it brings some joy to your heart that I'm doing so.

They say not to tell others about it in hopes of you telling them. It'll be something that will seem like you're paranoid, delusional, and have lost your mind. They'll end up wanting you to see a mental health professional in order to get a diagnosis to have it on paper where you're a less credible as an individual.

Absolutely do not tell anyone the full scope of what is happening, it'll cause you to be isolated from those who discard you as mentally incompetent. There are ways to speak to people about things, but don't do it in a way that sounds anywhere like what they're actually doing… think about this, if someone told you about this going on to them and you had no idea about all the technology and capabilities that they have, would you believe them? Even if you did there would be a lingering “maybe they've lost their marbles"" which would slowly drive them away from you. Any erratic behavior and such is often picked up when you feel that this is going on and you're able to find some help and are denied it. When you think that help is going to be coming, it'll be ripped away from you as you realize that all have removed themselves from your life because of your massive flip in behavior.

If you want some pointers, I can say that what they're trying to do is make you do something that'll hurt yourself image, they'll use all types of psychological tricks to try and make you believe they're capable of all these crazy things when they're actually just limited to psychological warfare via words and making you believe that they're hurting you when they're simply coming in contact with the nerve endings to simulate the sensation of damage being done. I'd advise limiting your conversations with them, they try to reel you in and then use positive> negative in order to build you up and then tear you down. They love using contrast in order to make their presence seem like it's much worse treatment. Don't do anything that they tell you and don't let them use the reverse psychology method like they're doing with “don't tell anyone""

If you'd like some more info, check out my answers on my profile, you'll find a multitude of useful info. Best of luck to you, you've got this. It might seem difficult at first, but you can adapt. Live your life to the fullest and ignore the pathetic bitches that dare steal from the people to destroy the rights of its citizens.""

Second answer: ""The short answer is to keep the constant pressure on the targeted individuals. What is the purpose of the stalking to begin with? To get the TI to reaction or get themselves in trouble.

They think that (and I suppose it is true for some victims of GS) that everyday, they do their BS they break the TI down. Slowly but surely they get them mentally compromised and closer to their goal.

All I can say is learn to ignore the idiots. They are nothing but children and have nothing that you don't give them. So fuck um. You're in control.

True gang stalking in nothing more than a mindfuck. And it only works if you allow it to happen. So stay focused on family, friends, life and hobbies instead"".

How do gangstalkers become gang stalkers? I mean its not like you just apply? How does it come about?

Question found on quora:

First reply: ""Gangstalking is not magic. It usually occurs when a lot of individuals conspire under the influence of some sort of prejudice or willingness to persecute someone. In many cases the victim of gangstalking was defamed in some way. Neighborhood watch and other untrained opinionated vigilantes are the obvious offenders of gangstalking, including fanatical religious and unofficial political groups.

Some people need an excuse or other encouragement, and that's why many people use the law as cover, and to convince other people into stalking and harassing someone. They don't want to be held accountable for a crime and that's why the law is assumed to be their perfect cover. This is called acting under the color of law.

Gangstalking only occurs on account of some sort of prejudice, and the spirit of gangstalking awareness should not be violated by accusing innocent people of stalking. That is what gangstalkers do. It is not gangstalking if someone has personal needs or makes personal requests of another. Anyone who does not believe that gangstalking exists is probably guilty of it themselves or covering for someone that is guilty.""

Second reply: ""Some are blackmailed into becoming one. My guess is some of them had a friend tell them about a job that pays well and doesn’t require a lot of effort.

Some of them see it as a game where they are rewarded monetarily if they get an emotional reaction from the target.

That’s how it begins, and once the gang stalkers develop camaraderie among them, “group think” invariably occurs and it is perpetuated from there.""

Third reply: ""The way I figure it is, is that they’re either just your every day bored out of their mind type people that become obsessed, or they’re fanatical types.

Basically just about anyone from any walk of life that develops an extremely intrusive, unhealthy fixation with your life.

I’m not just talking about some internet trolls that constantly want to have the last say in some none-sense argument, or someone that has some type of temporary love crush, but certain types of people whether they realize it or not, becomes a heavy taxation on your mental health, because they want to obsess over every moment of your life.

Sometimes these types of people can be a collective conspiring organization of ‘gangstalkers’, but some of the behavior I’ve detailed here today definitely can contribute to the feeling that you’re being monitored, watched, spied on, followed etc’.

These are some of the reasons why I believe that too many people in the world today, show others entirely too much attention.""

Forth reply: ""A Gangstalker systematically uses threats, intimidation, gaslighting and coercion to instill fear in their target. They use these actions to intentionally control and dominate their target and get anyone to join by using lies or temptation.

They are rewarded with money, drugs, cars, awards, job promotions and legal immunity. They enjoy the payout.

Gangstalkers believe they are doing their community a service by harassing innocent people who have not been charged with any crime.

They want to be on the winning “team” and will do anything they are asked to be accepted into the group. Even if that includes driving an innocent person to feat or worst"".

Why do gang stalkers repeat what you're thinking?

Question found on quora:

First reply: ""Gangstalking is an increasingly prevalent problem that can leave victims feeling scared, confused and helpless. It refers to repeated, unwanted attention directed toward an individual by a group of people, often in psychological or physical harassment. This includes verbal abuse, following someone, or even repeating what they say. But what makes gangstalking so insidious is the use of certain mind control techniques - such as using subliminal messages - that are designed to influence and manipulate the victim's behavior.

Subliminal messaging is a form of communication that bypasses the conscious mind and targets the subconscious. It involves sending subtle messages - often in the form of words, phrases or images - that are largely undetectable to the human eye but can still be processed by the subconscious. These messages are used to influence the victim's thoughts and emotions, and as such, can be a powerful tool for gangstalkers.

For example, a gangstalker might repeat what the target is thinking in order to plant ideas and manipulate their thinking. By repeating these ideas over and over again, the target is more likely to accept them as truth and act on them without questioning them. This can lead to further manipulation and psychological control. It's also possible for gangstalkers to use subliminal messaging to return negative thoughts and feelings back to the target, making them feel anxious, scared and confused.

In extreme cases, gangstalkers may even use mind control techniques to directly control their target's behavior. This could include using subliminal messages to induce feelings of depression or anxiety, as well as programming suggestions into the victim's mind. This can be especially dangerous if the messages encourage the target to hurt themselves or others.

It's important to note that while the use of mind control techniques and subliminal messaging can be worrying, it's not a form of mind control that can be used on any individual. Every individual is unique and has their own set of psychological defenses and responses to different forms of manipulation. However, understanding how subliminal messages and mind control techniques are used in gangstalking can help victims recognize these techniques and take steps to protect themselves.

Ultimately, understanding the types of mind control techniques used by gangstalkers can be crucial in helping victims learn how to recognize and defend against these tactics. By increasing awareness of this issue, we can help to reduce the risk of gangstalking and provide much-needed support to its victims.""

Second reply: ""They repeat what you are currently thinking: You describe your own environment through subvocal, they know the sounds of your home, they know what's happening inside your house and everyone's plans, they have spied and studied you for a while - By simply listening. (They may repeat what you say to bother you).

But realistically that means nothing as they cannot do anything besides the standard. They are nothing more but perverts, who like to waste their time. Thinking they're actually achieving something.

So if it bothers you, just play some annoying sounds, I like nyan cat myself- doesn't even have to be loud. They're condenser mics are sensitive"".

Third reply: ""Because they don’t have any original ideas or thoughts. They can create a new narrative without your input"".

How do I find out who my gangstalking handler is?

First answer: ""Your “handler” is the person who was interested in you in the first place. He or she initially told the others about you and they often do the will of the leader or in this case, your handler. The person is usually not around once the stalking starts.

However, the person keeps tabs on you through the others and you will feel a sixth sense about who that person might be. Most of the time, the handler is someone you actually met or even spoke to before or a family member has. They seem to be down to earth or popular, manipulative and who you sensed gave you the creeps. Most likely that person is your handler.

Sometimes it is someone who just looks at you while the others ask if you can be the next one. They have a reason why they want to know what you are doing. I don’t know all of the details because it varies from person to person. If you want to know who they are ….and they are contacting you in any way or shape or form….talk to them.

They will show a pattern of conversation email, text, voice or video over time and you will begin to remember who they remind you of. They will talk to you like they know everything about you and sometimes at a certain point, they really do! It is so strange to meet someone who is really following every detail of your life. Your handler will act like that. You will be able to figure it out over time if you ever met them in real life. Just watch for the signs and repetition.""

Second answer:

“I have been Gang Stalked for more than three years now. I still have no clue who my handler is, but I have my suspension and tactics to overcome this.

Normally your handler is someone you loosely know. You might not even be in contact with that person anymore. Here is my method. I'm hoping it will be beneficial to someone.

This is for gangstalkers who are immediately available for the local area because as soon as you leave the house. That requires someone nearby to follow you.

(Over time you may have gathered a list of car number plates or are currently in the process of adding to that list.)

•	Write down the car number plates that suspiciously follow you around, especially at night. (If you cannot see anyone, don't worry they will eventually show themselves over time).

•	Once you have a list: Act like you’re going for a walk around the local area, so you can record street by street. Wear a body cam or have a chest pocket and stick your phone in there, so you can silently and discreetly record them.

(There are even some apps which allow for silent background recording, this means you just download the app and quickly press the icon on your main mobile screen and it will automatically start recording silently. You stop the recording by pulling the mobile tab down, usually. This will allow you to record and never be expected if someone suddenly asks for your phone). Play around with the app, so you know how it works first. They are usually called background video recorder from the play store.

But do this method, street by street. It will be easier to achieve - You could do more if you like.

Tip: Remember you need to ensure that the camera records the neighbor's car's plate for each house. (If theyre not there, you can always try again later).

•	Extract the footage from the device and upload it to a computer. Name the video or file after the street name.

•	Review the footage and entered all the car's number plates from the footage to the excel document or a word document. But make sure it has some form of organized order, so you can find specific car's plates in the future. E.g. Topic - The street name List - The car number plates for that street. (Numbers of the house are not necessary as you can always check your original footage later or google street view them as well).

Eventually you will have a whole list of the locals number plates and can easily find out, who or which household might be involved. And the more they follow you, the more you will eventually get more suspicious car plates as time goes on.

Tip: If you suddenly leave the house randomly and didn’t mention it previously. That means someone needs to be sent out and they're local. Additionally you know what the traffic on your local area looks like too. So you can tell different random traffic and suspicious traffic.

I recommend giving one chance encounter before jumping to conclusions about local traffic. However if your quite far from your home location and you see a local near you. That could worthwhile to note down. For the first time. The second time is odd as hell - Take note.

Faces:

If you want faces tho. I recommended trying the same method or by visual sight, on a train instead. They will be forced to spend people after you, no matter what time of day and cars can't fly through traffic signs nor do roads travel in a straight line.

Someone on that train is a gangstalker and you just need to pick, the least busiest time for your area. The less people, the easier it is to locate them. \\\\\\\*Never approach them nor interact with them - This is only for research only).

What are they carrying? What are they wearing? Could they be hiding anything? The goal is to find what equipment they're using, by judging what is carriable or for studying local faces instead. What age group are they or what race are they? If you know your local demographic, what local things are near you and what date it is. You can roughly guess, who they might be.

E.g. I have a high school near me and its Saturday - I might have a younger gangstalker after me because it's a family suburb.

Or

If i have a old age facility near me or a older population near me and it’s a sunday - It might be the older person.

Or

If i have a lot of green race demographic specifically near me, more than the other local areas and considering they’re age availability. It might be them as a gangstalker again. Either way, there are many things to consider and wait upon.

And if you did pocket record this train encounter - You could always screenshot that recording to create a image. And that image or recording is all yours. To do whatever you want with. But remember no illegal activity. (Or you could silently sit near them to freak them out).

Either way - You know someone is one and they can't hide from you.""

Third answer: ""A lot of us started getting targeted in 2016. Mine was started in late April 2016. I’m not sure how this got started but it’s a wide spread it is locally. My handler is most likely a few different people. One in particular stands out. If you’re getting gang stalked it’s a group effort, but involvement with the wrong person can set you up for this community watch insanity.

If I’m honest after years of this constantly feeling watched and ill at ease experience, researching and delving into the topic … I don’t think you can solve your situation by merely finding the “leader” but you can solve what issues you have with allowing perps them no attention! And get better security as well!""

Fourth answer: ""I don’t think solo targets have handlers, which is why in mass you are being targeted. However, you can find who placed you on the list by paying close attention to key words and phrases that are being used by your gangstalkers that may have been said by a hater in your local community or co-worker group.

But for me, i just heard v2k through the walls and knew it was probably one of my immediate neighbors instead but I couldn't care less because I can absolutely promise everyone this right."" Taken from quora.",2,1770903338.0,TargetedSolutions,2,1.0,False

create a cozy canopy that feels welcoming year round. The idea came after I saw a photo of

a tiny courtyard transformed by a single tall artificial tree that added depth and softened the

light. I started looking for suppliers and found several models on Alibaba with metal cores

and UV resistant leaves. I ordered a sample section to test in our space and was pleasantly

surprised by the tactile quality of the foliage.

Close up the leaves read as convincing and the trunk textures looked natural enough under

warm cafe lighting. Installation was more involved than I expected. Anchoring a tall piece

required a discreet base plate and some weight to stop any wobble when the door opened.

Dust is the main ongoing maintenance issue so we set a monthly brushing routine and spot

clean with a damp cloth.

Lighting transformed the installation more than I imagined. Placing soft uplights at the base

made the foliage glow and hid a few seams where branches met. Customers noticed

immediately and commented that the space felt calmer. If you shop for artificial big trees on

Alibaba ask for construction photos, confirm shipping packaging for large parts, and request

details about UV resistance ratings. A little planning on anchoring and lighting turns a big

artificial tree from a prop into a defining feature that holds up to daily use and looks inviting

1r2tk68,https://www.reddit.com/r/EuropeDataTravel/comments/1r2tk68/i_tried_to_do_monaco_cheap_and_monaco_laughed_at/,I Tried to “Do Monaco Cheap” and Monaco Laughed at Me,"I went to Monaco thinking I had cracked the code.

I had spreadsheets. I had roaming data sorted. I had bookmarked grocery stores. I told myself, “It’s just another European microstate. How expensive can it be?”

Reader, I lasted three hours before Monaco humbled me.

**The First Fail: Coffee That Cost More Than My Lunch Budget**

I landed in Monaco from Philippines feeling confident. The train ride was scenic and cheap. I walked out into the marina and saw yachts that looked like small countries.

Naturally, I did what any traveler does. I ordered coffee near the harbor.

It was good. It was strong. It was also priced like it came with partial yacht ownership.

That was the moment I realized Monaco is not “France with better parking.” It is Monaco.

**Data point:** Harbor-side cafés near Port Hercule will charge you for the view. Walk five to ten minutes inland and prices drop fast. My second coffee cost half the first one and tasted the same.

Lesson one: Monaco taxes vibes.

**The Second Fail: Dressing Like a Backpacker at the Casino**

I wanted to see the legendary Casino de Monte-Carlo. I had seen photos. I imagined myself strolling in confidently.

Instead, I showed up in walking shoes, slightly sunburned, carrying a daypack that had seen three budget airlines.

You can enter parts of the building as a visitor, but if you plan to gamble, there is a dress code. I was technically allowed in the public areas, but I felt like I had shown up to a wedding in hiking gear.

Pro tip from someone who learned the hard way:

* Bring one slightly nicer outfit if Monaco is on your itinerary.
* A passport is required for entry to the gaming rooms.
* If you just want photos, the exterior is half the fun anyway.

Monaco is tiny, but it expects effort.

**The Third Fail: Thinking Monaco Was a Half-Day Stop**

My original plan was simple. Arrive at 10 AM. See the marina. See the casino. Leave by 3 PM.

Then I climbed up to Monaco-Ville, also known as Le Rocher.

Suddenly it did not feel like a billionaire theme park anymore. It felt lived in. Narrow streets. Laundry lines. Small bakeries. Views that look like they were edited in real time.

I ended up spending hours just walking.

Data tip:

* Monaco is about 2.08 km^(2) (0.80 sq mi).
* You can walk across it in under an hour.
* But elevation changes are real. Wear good shoes. Even if they are not casino approved.

**Where I Finally “Won” in Monaco**

The real win came when I stopped trying to outsmart the place.

Instead of chasing luxury, I leaned into the public stuff.

1. **Public viewpoints are free.** The walk along the cliffs near Prince's Palace of Monaco gives you harbor views that rival any rooftop bar.
2. **The Formula 1 circuit is just… there.** Parts of the Monaco Grand Prix route are normal streets most of the year. I literally crossed a famous corner on my way to buy water.
3. **Train in, train out.** Staying overnight can be brutal on the budget. I based myself in Nice and did Monaco as a day trip. Zero regrets.

My final meal was supermarket picnic food eaten on a bench overlooking yachts worth more than my entire neighborhood back home.

And honestly, it was perfect.

**Connectivity Note for the Data Crowd**

Signal strength in Monaco was solid. It is compact, urban, and well covered. If you are hopping between France and Monaco in one day, double-check roaming terms. Some plans treat Monaco separately even though it is surrounded by France.

Test before you go. Screenshot your eSIM details. Monaco may be beautiful, but losing data while trying to navigate steep streets is not.

**What Monaco Taught Me**

Monaco is not a budget destination. Trying to treat it like one is the first mistake.

But it is absolutely worth seeing if you adjust expectations:

* Go for the scenery, not the shopping.
* Accept that one overpriced coffee might happen.
* Walk everywhere.
* Let the absurdity of it all entertain you.

I arrived thinking I would conquer Monaco with strategy.

I left realizing Monaco is best enjoyed with humility, good walking shoes, and realistic data coverage.

Within this organ is a fetus either wolf or wolf man in suspended development. 



When an event occurs this fetus will develop rapidly bursting out of the lycan emerging like a twisted butterfly from its human cocoon. Within this Wolf creature there is another organ similar to the wolf womb but this contains a human fetus. Upon turning back the wolf will die and the human fetus will rapidly develop and emerge from the wolf. Same person who the wolf emerged from.



The event can either be described as a transformation or a takeover. Sometimes a wolf will have its own consciousness and if untamed by the lycan it will take over, usually during the full moon it will hunt anything but especially humans. It will only return when the sun rises.  



Then there’s those who have tamed this separate wolf. Collaborating with it. Choosing when to turn. But Wolf and man can still get at each other’s throats sometimes refusing to give control to each other. There is a strange ritual to bond man and wolf which involves some hallucinogenic drugs to repair the bond 



And then there are those where the man and wolf are the same. The consciousness transferring from one to another. 



Due to them being human and not a separate wolf consciousness they don’t tend to eat humans. But there are disturbing cases where some transform just to eat human flesh. 



Most of these Lycan known as the Ruptis (referring to the wolf bursting out of them) live in their own communities. With there own culture and religions. 



There is another type of Lycan where the previous ones belong to the ruptis variety; the vomitus is rather interesting. Instead of the fetus rapidly developing bursting out of the body. It exits the womb and travels up the intestines to be regurgitated out the moth. Only on the outside does it rapidly develop



The wolf is either a separate entity alongside the Lycan. Or the Lycan will lose consciousness and take over the wolf body.  Some have a mix of both where wolves can go from being independent to being controlled by the Lycan. When in the case of the consciousness transferring when it returns to the human body or when enough time passed typically 24 hours. the wolf body will dissolve. 



In very rare cases the Lycan has not teamed its wolf and it attacks and kills the Lycan. 



The wolf in question resembles a normal wolf there has been no instant of wolf man coming from a lycan vomitus 



This Lycan has historically held a position of being a monster Hunter. defending their villages when the creatures of the night descended upon it. Many of them belong to a form of Christianity they believe their wolf womb was a gift  from God to protect their fellow man. 



Where others have made their own communities this Lycan lives amongst normal humans. This is probably due to the fact that this Lycan does not leave countless discarded corpses in its lifetime. And very rarely kills humans. Many have managed to disguise their wolf as a pet. 



Some can produce more than one wolf from their womb. 



Some experiments have shown that the wolfs from the vomitus wolf womb may not be the same wolf all the time. Possibly never being the same wolf as the last. 



Slaying 



If you must slay a Lycan then beast do it in there human form. When the wolf is first released kill it fully developes in this state it’s vulnerable to small arms. When fully developed try using explosives and heavy weapons. Poison is also very effective with wolfbane being most effective. If they have consumed humans then silver is effective against them. There's many theories on why this works.  



Facts 



Alcohol is dangerous to the fetus in the wolf womb so Lycan avoid it. Someone who cannot control their transformations overindulge in it to prevent it. They also can’t have antihistamine so they suffer terribly of hayfever. 



Healthcare is a pretty difficult subject. As if the wolf womb is discovered they could be subjected to many indecencies. Such as experimentation or having there organs sold. The Catholic Church is the main provider of healthcare for Lycan. 



There is a saint ralph of Wessex who was a Lycan and is venerated by Catholic Lycans.

At home, I do my timed sections in the same spot, same lighting, same keyboard, same everything, and if I’m being honest I’ve built a whole little ritual around it. Water in the same bottle, earplugs, the exact chair height, even the same playlist before I start (not during, I’m not that chaotic). And it works, my PTs are slowly moving up. But the idea of sitting in a testing center where the desk feels like a cafeteria table and the room temperature is 400 degrees or arctic, with random noises and that “don’t move too much” vibe, is messing with me more than I expected. I’m not trying to be dramatic, it’s just that I’ve noticed I’m super sensitive to interruptions. If a door closes or someone shifts in a seat, I lose my place and suddenly I’m rereading the same sentence like it’s written in another language. That’s fine at home because I can reset mentally. In a center, I’m scared I’ll waste time fighting my own brain. So I’m trying to rebuild my prep so it’s about consistency, not comfort. What I’m doing right now is one PT a week and then drilling my weak spots (LR timing and RC focus, mainly). The part I’m stuck on is how to simulate the in-person “pressure” without making every practice session miserable and unsustainable. Do people actually rotate locations, like library, empty classroom, coffee shop (with noise blocking), or is that overkill and it just adds stress for no reason. Also, for endurance, do you find it better to do more full PTs even if review time gets tighter, or to keep PTs steady and add longer timed sets as a bridge. I’m worried I’m going to chase the wrong type of difficulty, like I’ll spend energy training for distractions instead of improving my fundamentals. If you already made the transition from remote practice vibes to thinking about in-person, what changes helped the most. Small things count, like routines for breaks, mental resets, whatever. I’m not looking for test day specifics, I just want to stop feeling like my score depends on my chair being familar.

For years, we operated on the ""gas station model."" We have a fleet of about 12 pickups and 4 heavy skid steers. Every morning or evening, guys would drive to the local station, wait in line, grab coffee, chat, fill up, and drive back. We estimated this was killing about 45 minutes per truck, per day.

We finally decided to centralize. We contacted **Ricochet Fuel** and had them drop two double-walled FuelCubes (one for clear diesel/gas, one for dyed diesel) right at the staging area.

**The Math:**

* **Old Way:** 12 trucks x 45 mins lost x 5 days = 45 hours of lost wages/productivity per week.
* **New Way:** Drivers fill up while the foreman does the morning brief. Zero detour time.

We used Ricochet because they offered a remote monitoring system where they track our tank levels and automatically dispatch a refill truck before we run low. We literally don’t even have to call them; the fuel just appears.

1r2tej9,https://www.reddit.com/r/growmybusiness/comments/1r2tej9/new_climbing_gym_in_lithuania/,New climbing gym in Lithuania?,"Hello there!

A little bit of a backstory first. You see I am from Lithuania and started climbing 8 years ago, and back then the closest climbing gym was in the very west, in Klaipėda, which is 140km away. I myself am from the North of Lithuania, a city named Šiauliai, with 124 000 people living in it. It‘s the 4th biggest city, and yet it didn‘t have a climbing gym. After traveling to Klaipėda once a week for a while, I've decided that I need a gym in my city, and so when I was 16 I designed and with a help of a school and 2 teachers managed to build my first climbing gym. There through YouTube and Instagram I learned how to set routes, started teaching my classmates, and after finishing school and studying, here I am again, now coaching rock climbing in that school for 3 years already. The problem is that the school gave us a garage for the gym, and it‘s only 150m² and only 5m in height from floor to ceiling. Another problem is that it is not commercial and we can only climb there 3 times per week, 2hr per day.

Since the sport is getting more and more popular, I've decided that it‘s time to go big and open the gym for the whole city. Why am I sure it will work? Because as I mentioned previously, there is over 120 000 people in this city, and not too many things to do honestly. I wasn‘t allowed to advertise, because it was a school, but I still managed to gather 50 people, who would come when they were free of work and I was in the gym. Not to mention over 20kids, who don‘t skip a training in the school. And that‘s only from lips to lips advertising and a really small gym. By the way, of those 50 there are about 20, who still travel to Klaipėda or Vilnius climbing gyms, that are more than 140km away from here, just to train. Not to talk about the neighboring cities.

I‘ve been searching for a place to build a gym and I‘ve found this place with 1000m² of raw climbing space, plus other rooms for changing, showers and birthdays. It is also 14m tall. The biggest gym in Lithuania now is in Vilnius, Vertical climbing gym, which is also around 1000m² and 15m tall. So there is potential to make it one of the best gyms in the country. We also can‘t forget Latvia, cause since Šiauliai is really close to the country wall, It would be easier for latvians to also come to Lithuania‘s comps.

I‘ve gathered a small team, we just don‘t have the money to open it on our own. I have been in a close contact with other gyms in Lithuania, and have received their support when it comes to walls and mattresses.

To finish it all, I am reaching to you for help as well, I created a [4fund.com](http://4fund.com) account, to get the money we're missing to fully open the gym.

I think I've finally found the lip product that made me stop rotating through my 20+ Korean glosses.

 Judydoll isn't talked about as much as Romand or Lilybyred here, but their [Judydoll Jelly Light Lip Glaze](https://benable.com/enchantglow/judydoll/details?detail_id=7331076) deserves the hype. 

What makes it different from other Asian beauty glosses: **The "" jelly"" texture** \- It's not a water tint, not an oil tint, but this weird bouncy gel that sits ON the lips without sinking into lines. It gives that ""just ate a popsicle"" wet look that Korean makeup artists aim for. 

Non-migrating - Most glossy products bleed on me. This has some grip to it - stays where you put it but still feels comfortable. 

The peachy-nude that works for medium skin Wear time is 3-4 hours through coffee, leaves a slight stain after. Not transfer-proof (it is a gloss), but doesn't disappear immediately like cheaper glosses. 

Price point: Usually $5-7 depending on the retailer. I've been ordering from [Yesstyle](https://benable.com/enchantglow/judydoll/details?detail_id=7331076) since they seem to stock the fastest, but would love to know if anyone has found these with faster US shipping.

1r2tafo,https://www.reddit.com/r/Collaboration/comments/1r2tafo/new_climbing_gym_in_lithuania_partners_needed/,New climbing gym in Lithuania. partners needed,"Hello there!

A little bit of a backstory first. You see I am from Lithuania and started climbing 8 years ago, and back then the closest climbing gym was in the very west, in Klaipėda, which is 140km away. I myself am from the North of Lithuania, a city named Šiauliai, with 124 000 people living in it. It‘s the 4th biggest city, and yet it didn‘t have a climbing gym. After traveling to Klaipėda once a week for a while, I've decided that I need a gym in my city, and so when I was 16 I designed and with a help of a school and 2 teachers managed to build my first climbing gym. There through YouTube and Instagram I learned how to set routes, started teaching my classmates, and after finishing school and studying, here I am again, now coaching rock climbing in that school for 3 years already. The problem is that the school gave us a garage for the gym, and it‘s only 150m² and only 5m in height from floor to ceiling. Another problem is that it is not commercial and we can only climb there 3 times per week, 2hr per day.

Since the sport is getting more and more popular, I've decided that it‘s time to go big and open the gym for the whole city. Why am I sure it will work? Because as I mentioned previously, there is over 120 000 people in this city, and not too many things to do honestly. I wasn‘t allowed to advertise, because it was a school, but I still managed to gather 50 people, who would come when they were free of work and I was in the gym. Not to mention over 20kids, who don‘t skip a training in the school. And that‘s only from lips to lips advertising and a really small gym. By the way, of those 50 there are about 20, who still travel to Klaipėda or Vilnius climbing gyms, that are more than 140km away from here, just to train. Not to talk about the neighboring cities.

I‘ve been searching for a place to build a gym and I‘ve found this place with 1000m² of raw climbing space, plus other rooms for changing, showers and birthdays. It is also 14m tall. The biggest gym in Lithuania now is in Vilnius, Vertical climbing gym, which is also around 1000m² and 15m tall. So there is potential to make it one of the best gyms in the country. We also can‘t forget Latvia, cause since Šiauliai is really close to the country wall, It would be easier for latvians to also come to Lithuania‘s comps.

I‘ve gathered a small team, we just don‘t have the money to open it on our own. I have been in a close contact with other gyms in Lithuania, and have received their support when it comes to walls and mattresses. To finish it all, I am reaching to you for help as well, I created a [4fund.com](http://4fund.com) account, to get the money we're missing to fully open the gym. I'm dropping the link here, any contribution helps! Lets make this happen together!

My previous climbs are similar, played since launch, play for one hour a day and or if i am like at 78, 88 or 98 will stay to play out to next rank. Total playtime this season was 8.5 to 8.75 hours total to infinite.

I keep track on paper so i will just dump the raw numbers here. Took me total of 8.5 hours, did 95 to infinite today with many bots too, saw lots of star lord, discard, destroy, one negative deck, chamber decks and that is about it, no supergiant or hela. CL 33k, playing since launch.

Total games =98 (wins) + 18 (losses) + 92 (retreats) = **208 games**

* 309 cubes won
* cubes lost = 52 (lost) + 112 (retreated) = 164

i don't use untapped or an overlay so this is just kept on paper, i have stats for older seasons too but again on paper, next season i might do it in spreadsheet, thing is is play for an hour a day at a coffee shop before work so it is easier to scribble it down.

Anyways do what you want with it or calc my cube/game if you want, i retreat, normally at the 45% mark, i think these stats support it.

Negative knull running the direct counter for the meta each season. I boomer snap at times when i am at 89 or 99 and i need one to win, that pretty much is telling you to retreat so you don't lose more as i just need the one or two to get to next rank.

Don't stay in games if i drop jane down, can't believe how many people play out 8 cubers for that, even with starlord on the board. I played around the double alioth and big big things.",0,1770902499.0,MarvelSnap,0,0.25,False

I received my Peak Water shipment and was happy to replace my standard water filter with something that adds minerals, because my current filter practically turns the water into distilled water.

I tested my tap water and set the filtration intensity as recommended based on the results.

However, I quickly realized that V60 coffee turns out kind of nasty. The body and flavor of any beans got replaced by the taste of this water. I’m not sure how to describe it - maybe like slightly salty water with something else. About two-thirds of the flavor just disappeared. When I switched back to my usual filter, I was relieved to have the coffee taste back again.

The water from Peak Water is a bit cloudy. Also, it feels poorly assembled - cheap plastic, an outdated design, strange dimensions.

Do you have any recommendations for using it? Maybe I did something wrong? It’s strange to have this experience despite the huge number of enthusiastic users.

Since then we've had a coffee, a drink and last night went to watch a comedy show, we've never had them as ""Dates"" so to speak though.

I really really like her, her replies on social media are pretty rubbish but in person we get along really well. We've not kissed each other or anything.

Last night we went to the comedy club and we'd had a few drinks, I'm terrified to flirt/make too much of a move. I'm a bit socially awkward when it comes to dating and getting my feelings across. I don't do touch and contact too well. 

I walked her home and we hugged but we've not kissed or anything, in scared I'd be to full on or she's not interested. I don't really know how to approach the subject or what to say to ask where we are at. 

This is the first time I've felt like this about anyone for a long time and if I'm bluntly honest I'm scared of the rejection. I work in a high intensity healthcare environment where I normally thrive of pressure but this is absolutely terrifying.

When it comes to my art style, it's best described as a mix of semi-realism with bold, expressive colour. I enjoy playing with lighting and atmosphere, and I like to focus on small, relatable details that give the viewer something to pick out. I often keep visible sketch elements from my rough stages, highlighting the human touch in contrast to the eeever-growing influence of AI-generated imagery in children’s publishing!

• How he joined: ""Sporting director Hassan \[Çetinkaya\] didn't just call, he came to Marseille and even to my home in Cassis multiple times. We’d have coffee and lunch. That personal effort showed me how much the club wanted me. It made all the difference.""

• The Istanbul vibe: ""It was love at first sight. The city, the food, the culture, it was incredible. But the team spirit was the best. We were always together, organizing barbecues and dinners with our families. It didn’t matter if you were Turkish, Brazilian, or French, we were a family.""

• The 2011 Title & Scandal: « Regarding the match-fixing affair, let’s be clear: our president didn't bribe the opponents we were facing. Instead, he doubled the bonuses for the teams playing \[against our rivals\]. I know this very well. It was common practice back then, and I don't think he was the only one doing it. But you cannot say, because I was on the pitch for those games, that we bribed the teams we played against.

In the second half of the season, the turning points were the matches against Trabzonspor, our rivals for the title. We beat them. Then we went and won the derbies away at Galatasaray and Besiktas. If that isn't a champion's run, what is? We won through suffering. I remember a match against \[Sivasspor\] in the snow; the teams facing us were not playing half-heartedly, brother. They were coming at us hard, players were leaving the pitch injured. We truly fought for those matches. »

• The regret of departure : « The president was convicted for something else as well. But Fener itself wasn't ultimately sanctioned the way people said it would be. At the time, I was told a lot of nonsense, and that's actually why I left, with great regret. I was told Fener was going down to the second division, that everything would be stripped, like Calciopoli in Italy. I was scared. I didn't want to play in the second division. Some people told me it was all lies and that Fener would never go down, but I had already listened to the wrong voices. In the end, Fener stayed up. I left for nothing, against my heart. It’s a 'coup de cœur' for that club »

• The Squad: ""The quality was insane. Alex de Souza was a genius. Then you had Emre, Volkan, Lugano, Yobo, André Santos... it was a championship winning DNA.""

🇹🇷

• Transfer Süreci: ""Sportif direktör Hasan \[Çetinkaya\] sadece aramakla kalmadı; defalarca Marsilya'ya, hatta Cassis'teki evime kadar geldi. Birlikte kahve içer, öğle yemeği yerdik. Bu kişisel çaba, kulübün beni ne kadar çok istediğini gösterdi. Her şeyi değiştiren de buydu.""

• İstanbul Havası: ""İlk görüşte aşktı. Şehir, yemekler, kültür... her şey inanılmazdı. Ama en iyisi takım ruhuydu. Hep beraberdik, ailelerimizle mangallar ve akşam yemekleri düzenlerdik. Türk, Brezilyalı ya da Fransız olman fark etmezdi, biz gerçek bir aileydik.""

• 2011 Şampiyonluğu ve Şike Davası: ""Şike davasıyla ilgili net olalım: Başkanımız karşılaştığımız rakiplere rüşvet vermedi. Aksine, \[rakiplerimize karşı\] oynayan takımların primlerini iki katına çıkardı. Bunu çok iyi biliyorum. O zamanlar bu yaygın bir uygulamaydı ve bunu yapan tek kişinin o olduğunu sanmıyorum. Ama o maçlarda sahada olan biri olarak şunu söyleyebilirim ki; oynadığımız takımlara rüşvet verdiğimizi asla söyleyemezsiniz.

• Sezonun ikinci yarısında kırılma noktaları, şampiyonluk yarışındaki rakibimiz Trabzonspor’a karşı oynadığımız maçlardı. Onları yendik.

I started my island during covid lockdown (since the release). I kind of want to start over but I love my island so much and I don't think I would devote the same energy again.

It doesn't have a specific theme, I just built it as I got various ideas from items I found/received and ideas I found online. I do try to use as many items as I can without it being too overwhelming 😅.

I have used paths to try to help lead guests around, but I don't really like too much of the typical path look, so I tried my own little thing. Some of my island's features include:

Full museum (not including art) and coffee shop

Max size house with maximalist decor

Cat café

Carnival

Dj/night club

Pizza shop

Arcade

Film screening/picnic area

Pool with diving board into the ocean

Tiny town including dollhouses and train tracks

Extended town square with café area

Plant/garden booth

Beach bar

Gym

Nooks Cranny & Able Sisters Shopping District

Fortune telling

Ocean side dining (beside my house)

Veggie gardens

Fruit tree orchard

Camp site

1r2szho,https://i.redd.it/dgkt1qbtb2jg1.jpeg,23M Looking to vibe with online pals around the globe,"Hello internet people. Makin friends through these means is kinda fun for meand I’ve been lucky enough to make friends form here that stays in touch with me for a long time. That’s why I wanna try this again. But since i’m diving back here, something feels off and people are pointing out about bots and dead internet. So let’s see if I can get real human to be friends with me, lol.

So here’s a quick intro:

Call me Felix, I’m a human person of 23 years old. I’m based in Southeast Asia and currently living a post-event crash because I finally finished my long overdue andergrad thesis that took me an extra 1 and a half years in college. It certainly an experience juggling and wrestling with a massive destination branding project, a spicy mix of clinical depression, and way too many sleepless nights.

I’m here looking for dem random chaos of talking to people who live a completely different life from across the globe. Exchanging experience from mundane dailies to niches, what it’s like living there. No expectations, no pressures, just be you. Quick disclaimer, I'm in a healthy open relationship with my man (I also met him this way, can you believe that!?). Some who vibes with me sticks around, but I’m not against a quick chat ofc, that's where the chaos is. Online pals of mine I’ve met stills regularly catching up with me, daily, monthly, maybe next year it doesn’t matter. It’s nice to know that people still catch up to you after long time. Sometime we just shares silly stuff and random pics from daily commutes, I always find it fascinating how different live from even the next border could be different from mine. So wherever you’re from, when we can ping-pong eachother’s while taking things unseriously, we might vibe vibe.

Stop here for quick intro, here’s my long ahh braindumb:

Right now I’m a soon-to-graduate design student after a five and a half year there. WOWWWWOWW?! Five and a half year?! Yes, where I’m from, doiing a final project+undergrad thesis is a requerement to graduate. I heard it called captsone project in english term. A paper and project culmination of my studies for the last 4 years as an undergrad. Mine is apparently too much for a single person to handle but what the heck I did it, BY MY OWN, a whole ass destination branding project that could be a project for a whole studio. BUT I FINALLY DID IT!. Submitted my final paper last week and the other shenanigans requirement. The output is pretty satisfactory atleast for my stnadard. I can show you some of my final exhibition display if you like.

I’ve been in the trenches of mental healths for a long time and just recently it crawled back out after awhile. I though I had it all until things hits me, I gotta live with this forever. But, hey, there’s nothing I can’t do. I made it this far might es well keep it going. I don’t like this vibe but i’m getting rid o fit slowly though meds and therapy and healthy living again bit by bit. I got lonely very often because of that, like dreading lonelyness, even though I’m surounded by many great irl. I find this as one of my escapism and end up with many great online conenction.I find comforts in talking to new people online and listening to their mudnane daily life, their interest, their hyperfixations, tell me wht’s the weather is like or what you’r next cup of coffee order will be. We might be a long term friends or maybe um uhh bromance cough.

As for the pals I made, I found one who loves writing and giving me long replies making it feels like a pen-pal-esque, one who loves collecting fossils around his town, one who loves hiking around in local spots, one who just living the Cali life, a few more, and one bf whose trying 3d modelling. To my surprise for friends I made o non reddit, they’re great! I wish to find more so maybe you’re next? Idk let’s see.

We can play 20 questions and ask eachother random ahh question to keep the convo going, I find it silly and fun way to get to know people quickly. Or maybe we already have common interest if you wanna check the board I mad ein my profile. I try I best to condence what i’ve been obsessed over my live lol.

Wanna tryna skipp the small talks? Dm me with “Panda” so I know you’re a real person and not just the dead internet bot and you actually put time to read through this long ahh brainfarts and actually interested to vibe. Tell me your go to snacks or coffe order, tell me your last game or movie you wathced that got you hooked. I’m a better listener than talker so feel free to share more, but you’ll find out if we clicks if I share and talk more than you 👉👈. The more you tell me about yourself, the more you'll know about me. Let’s vibe.

1r2sxkn,https://www.reddit.com/r/Advice/comments/1r2sxkn/how_do_i_go_from_night_owl_to_early_bird/,How do I go from night owl to early bird ?,"This is a work post cause I missed a work appointment (again).

I've always liked sleeping in and going to bed late.

I'm naturally a night owl. My brain is foggy all day. I usually ""wake up"" and think clearly after 5pm.

But recently, it feels like something's wrong.

My brain wakes up later than usual, at 6-7pm. If I'm given a work assignment and I arrive at work at 10am, chances are I'm actually really starting to work on it at 5-7pm.

The rest of the day would be lost to mini-Tasks, coffee breaks, doing some other thing that is lower priority.

It's like my brain has free rein the whole day until the end of the afternoon.

Of course I have bad days and better days. On the better days, it's like I'm on a river and I tick my to do list so easily.

On bad days, I'm a terrible employee:

I've missed appointments that were at 4pm because of my dumb brain. Just forgot about them!

I've been late at appointments that started at 3.30 pm cause I spent the whole morning thinking about it, but forgot about it in the afternoon, when it actually mattered that I remembered them!

I've also had trouble waking up in the morning. I've now missed 4-5 morning appointments in total. In less than a year.

This morning was the worst I've done: I spent last week reminding myself that I had an **actual, important, work meeting with a client and colleagues**. I've added the meeting to my work and personal agendas.

Usually, I set an additional alarm the night before, to remind myself I **need to get up**.
I also typically set one or two  radio alarms that talks to me really loud and tells me the time at regular intervals.
I recently discovered flash notifications and make them sound with my alarms.

But I got sloppy.

Last night, I only set 4 flash-alarms and only one was ringing from across the room.

I didn't have the appointment in mind. My brain had free rein until too late last night. So, again, I just forgot about it all.

Today, I woke up and I'd missed all my alarms (ringing between 8.20 and 9.10 am).

My stupid calendar app was displaying my reminder for the appointment at 10 am, but wasn't ringing any alarms.

So, I've hated myself since waking up at 10.45 am. I spent 15 min cursing myself, 30 min taking a shower, another 30 min getting to work.

I apologised to my colleagues. I even told them I could have actually turned on my laptop and joined the meeting as soon as I woke up, but the shame was too strong.

I almost cried, too.

I want to change. I actually got better at sleep schedules until I turned 25 and had medical issues.

Now I'm older (celebrated 27 year old birthday recently) and still feel like a 13-year old who needs 15 hour nights.

It weighs heavily on my mind because I need to take the bar and the exams start very early (I'd need to get there before 8-8.30 am).

Additionally, I can't seem to find a good schedule to revise after work since I'm so productive late at night.

How do I fix this? How do I become an early bird?

Because it's starting to feel impossible, to change something so broken.",2,1770901597.0,Advice,2,1.0,False

They have a generous refer-a-friend scheme where you earn a **free £50 credit** when you switch your energy to them. You're eligible if you have a smart meter, standard meter or economy 7 meter. Another plus: NO FEES if you decide to switch out elsewhere at any time!

**How to get your free £50 bonus with Octopus Energy:**

1. [Sign up to Octopus using my £50 refer-a-friend link here](https://share.octopus.energy/quiet-mouse-344)
2. Enter your post code and answer questions about your current energy use to receive a price quote. Click ""Sign me up"" to see the details about the proposed tariff, then confirm the switch once you’re happy.
3. Enter your gas and electricity meter ID/serial numbers, so have an old bill ready as this info will be on there already. Octopus is brilliant at updating you via email on the whole process with what you need to do at each step.
4. Your £50 reward will be credited to your account after your first direct debit has been taken - I received mine 2 weeks after the direct debit.

**My hot tips:**

* When getting your quote, enter your “actual” energy usage using an old bill instead of using the “low, medium, high” options to keep your direct debit payments accurate
* In your online account, you can reduce your monthly direct debits if you think they're too high - I lowered my mine by about 70%!

**My experience + timeline:**

I switched from Shell Energy to Octopus as it worked out cheaper across the board for both gas and electricity, so the £50 switch reward was a total bonus. The £50 was applied to my account less than 2 weeks after my first direct debit was taken and the switch process was probably the smoothest I’ve ever experienced. If you have a smart meter, you can also claim a free Caffe Nero or Greggs coffee each week as a free perk. Another plus: NO FEES if you decide to switch out elsewhere at any time!

Jitters, heart palpitations, and 3 a.m. staring contests with your ceiling — these are the common perks of most fat burners. And if you've been down that path, you know it can make you feel like you're spiraling instead of slimming.

So we dug into [HydroLean XT](https://theworldhealth.org/hydrolean-xt-official) **reviews** to find out if this formula, free from stimulants and side effects, actually delivers or just coasts on trendy buzzwords. Spoiler: it delivers, but let’s break it down.

============

>

============

# 🧾 Product Overview

* **Product Name**: HydroLean XT
* **Category**: Weight Loss Supplements ➝ Stimulant-Free Fat Burners
* **Overall Verdict**: 4.7/5

# 🧪 What Is HydroLean XT and How Does It Work?

**HydroLean XT ingredients list** includes **Coleus Forskohlii**, **pomegranate extract**, **vitamin C**, and **magnesium citrate**. These help support energy, digestion, and appetite regulation.

This is a **clean label weight loss pill** with no stimulants — just natural compounds that work together to help your body burn fat without frying your brain in the process.

It also serves as one of the best **metabolism boosters without caffeine**, appealing to people who already drink enough coffee or simply want to avoid more of it.

# 🔍 What Makes HydroLean XT Different?

Most fat burners are like that one friend who’s too loud at brunch. HydroLean XT is quieter but way more helpful. It gives you **effective fat burners with no crash** built right in.

If you’ve tried other so-called **doctor approved fat burners** and felt like a squirrel on espresso, you’ll be glad to know this one doesn’t buzz or bloat you into oblivion.

It's also a [reliable fat burner](https://theworldhealth.org/hydrolean-xt-official) **for sensitive stomachs** — which is great for folks who don't want their supplement to feel like a full-contact sport.

# 👥 Who Is It For (and Who It’s Probably Not For)?

HydroLean XT is ideal for people looking for **safe weight loss supplements** that support their routine, not wreck it. Especially if you're trying to figure out **how to lose weight without stimulants**, this makes life easier.

It’s a smart pick if you want a **non jittery fat burner for women**, or men — let’s not be exclusive — that won’t ruin your mood, your sleep, or your lunch.

But if you're chasing overnight abs or want a miracle in a bottle, you might get impatient. This isn't for quick-fix folks.

# 🧬 My Experience (Through Leo, the Photographer)

Leo’s a freelance photographer I met at a local creative meetup—one of those people who’s always lugging a backpack full of lenses and somehow running on zero sleep and black coffee.

He mentioned how inconsistent his energy had been lately and how snacking between shoots had turned into a bad habit he couldn’t shake.

I told him about [HydroLean XT](https://theworldhealth.org/hydrolean-xt-official) after he complained about another caffeine-heavy fat burner that left him feeling “wired and weird.”

He gave it a shot, and after a couple of weeks, he messaged me: “Okay, I actually feel human in the afternoons now.”

He said the **stimulant free metabolism support supplement** helped him stay sharp during long days without that twitchy, over-caffeinated feeling. He also noticed he wasn’t reaching for pastries at 3 p.m. like clockwork.

The only downside? “The capsules are kind of horse-sized, and I had to remember to eat something first. But honestly? Worth it.”

# ✅ Pros and Cons

# Pros

🟢 Smooth energy and no crashes thanks to **stimulant free fat burning supplement**s.

🟢 Great for controlling cravings with a **natural appetite suppressant no jitter**s.

🟢 It's a **plant based weight loss supplement with no caffein**e, so no overstimulation.

🟢 Perfect if you're hunting for **non stimulant appetite suppressant that work**s.

# Cons

🔴 Capsules are big — chase it with water or a good luck prayer.

🔴 Doesn’t work miracles overnight. It’s a nudge, not a cannonball.

🔴 You’ll need to support it with real food and real habits — sorry, no bypassing vegetables.

# 💰 Pricing Options

HydroLean XT comes in three bundles:

* **1 bottle**: $69 + shipping
* **3 bottles**: $59 each + free shipping
* **6 bottles**: $49 each + free shipping + bonuses

It’s marketed as a **top rated non stimulant fat burner**, and judging by the price-to-benefit ratio, that’s not just marketing fluff.

# 🛍️ Where To Buy HydroLean XT

Only [buy from the official website](https://theworldhealth.org/hydrolean-xt-official). Don’t trust shady third-party sellers — some are peddling knockoffs that don’t even qualify as multivitamins.

Buying direct also ensures access to the **180-day money-back guarantee** and exclusive extras, making the **buy HydroLean XT online** process safer and more worthwhile.

# ⭐ Star Ratings

If you’re a student, you’re constantly telling yourself, “I have coffee at home,” especially when you’re trying to save money. But at the same time, you want that little “treat yourself” moment for all the hard work you’re putting in.

When I was in cosmetology school, it was conveniently located in a downtown mall, so I had plenty of options before my morning classes. The only problem was that most places weren’t open before my 8 a.m. start time, so Starbucks was usually the go-to since they opened at 5 a.m. Every once in a while, I’d politely ask my teacher if I could step out later when other cafés opened, just so I could grab that boujee, overpriced coffee that somehow tasted like gold. You might wonder how I afforded it as a student, but not everyone is careful with their money,

For example, a friend of mine who is an HNI (High Net Worth Individual) with HSBC needed a signed and stamped salary account statement for a visa. His account is in Chennai, but he was in Bangalore and couldn’t get it from his home branch. On the day he went to the MG Nagar branch, the bank was closed due to a bandh. He called his relationship manager, who connected him with someone in Bangalore. That person arranged everything and even offered to travel to the visa office to hand-deliver the statement. Eventually, my friend went to the branch near the metro and collected it. He was treated extremely well — coffee, cookies, chocolates, full assistance, no hassle. On the same day, several regular customers came to the bank for their work and had to leave without getting their issues resolved. Some of them may have taken leave from work just to visit the branch. This isn’t just about one incident. Because he’s an HNI, he gets premium cards with strong reward programs. For example, he bought a car for 10 lakhs and got around 50k as cashback. Meanwhile, someone like a cab driver, who probably works much harder physically, doesn’t get access to such benefits. Now, I understand that HNIs are more valuable clients for banks. Banks often give them lower interest rates on savings accounts and try to cross-sell various financial products to make money. In many cases, banks can push unnecessary or high-margin products to wealthy clients and earn more from them. But an informed HNI can actually use the system in his favor. He can avoid the useless products and take advantage of only the profitable ones — premium rewards, better service, exclusive access — so it becomes a net win for him. I understand banks are businesses and prioritize high-revenue customers. But sometimes it feels like the system keeps rewarding people who already have advantages, while others don’t even get basic support. What do you all think? Is this simply how business works, or is there something fundamentally unfair about it?

I went to Empire in Surfers Paradise on 07 Feb26. I don’t usually go clubbing anymore, but I had a mate visiting and he wanted to check out the Gold Coast nightlife. I live in Brisbane and don’t know Surfers that well, so we randomly picked this place.
It was a packed night with a pretty young crowd. I wasn’t planning to stay long, but they were playing 90s hip hop, which honestly felt great to hear after all these years. Across from me on the dance floor was a VIP table that looked like it they might’ve been a hens night or a group that had been to the Laneway festival.
I noticed a lady across from me, she seemed to know the words to every song they played. It was impressive, and she was really pretty. I’m fairly tall so I tend to stand out a bit, so at first I assumed she was looking at me because of that. She was wearing a shiny silver two-piece outfit with white boots, and she may have had what I think was an Aboriginal flag tattoo on the back of her right arm, I couldn’t see it clearly.
We kept making eye contact for over an hour and a half. She passed by me a couple of times while heading to the bar.
I’m a shy person and don’t usually approach people in clubs. I did think about saying hi, but besides being shy I was also recovering from a sore throat and could barely talk, and the speakers were blasting right above where her group was standing. When I did gather up the courage to say hi, a fight broke out with the security and this drunk guy. The security managed to get him out but then his ID fell off. So I went outside to give it to him..anyway, after that distraction, at some point it felt like she turned away from her group and faced me while she was dancing. I finally decided to move toward her again, but right then her friends started to leave. I first thought they were just heading to the bar. As she was walking out, she looked directly at me, smiled, and gave me a thumbs up, whatever that was supposed to mean. May be to say you're a dumbass for not making a move. At the time I tried not to make much of it. I was exhausted after a long day. My mate said, “You’re a fool, the two of you definitely had some kind of unspoken connection.”
I’ve been thinking about it since, and what stayed with me wasn’t regret, it was the reminder that moments like that can still happen when you least expect them. Even a brief, silent connection with a stranger can feel strangely grounding.
I don’t know if I’ll ever see her again. Maybe I won’t. But I’m glad it happened. It reminded me that I’m still open, still noticing, still human - just stupidly shy and awkward around people I like.
Honestly, it felt worth sharing. It reminds me of that Lenny Kravitz song, “Again” . Or to explain it to the younger crowd, by writing this I feel more like Benedict Bridgerton in Season 4.

WASHINGTON, Feb 12 (Reuters) - The Trump administration has shelved a number of key tech security measures aimed at Beijing ahead of an April meeting between the two countries' presidents. The measures include a ban on China Telecom's U.S. operations and restrictions on sales of Chinese equipment for U.S. data centers, sources said.  

The U.S. has also put on hold proposed bans on domestic sales of routers made by TP-Link and the U.S. internet business of China Unicom and China Mobile along with another measure that would bar sales of Chinese electric trucks and buses in the U.S., four people said, declining to be named.  

Those decisions have not previously been reported. They are the latest moves by the Trump administration to rein in U.S. government actions that could antagonize Beijing following a trade truce reached by China’s Xi Jinping and U.S. President Donald Trump in October, the sources said.

That meeting also included a pledge by the Chinese to delay painful export restrictions on the rare-earth minerals that underpin tech manufacturing globally.

The Commerce Department defended its actions, saying it is actively using its authorities to ""address national security risks from foreign technology, and we will continue to do so.""  

While the administration's actions are likely aimed at helping to defuse trade tensions related to Trump's costly trade war, some critics say they also leave U.S. data centers and other technology vulnerable to Chinese threats as data center construction surges to meet exploding demand for AI.

""At a moment when we are desperately trying to remove ourselves from Beijing's leverage over rare-earth supply chains, it is ironic that we're actually letting Beijing acquire new areas of leverage over the U.S. economy – in telecoms infrastructure, in data centers and AI, and EVs,” said Matt Pottinger, who served as deputy national security advisor during Trump's first term.

The Chinese Embassy said Beijing opposes ""turning trade and technological issues into political weapons"" while welcoming U.S. cooperation with China that could make 2026 ""a year where our two major countries advance toward mutual respect, peaceful coexistence, and win-win cooperation.""

TP-Link Systems Inc., a California-based company that was spun off from a Chinese firm in 2024, emphasized that it is an independently owned American company, ""with U.S.-managed software, U.S.-hosted data, and security practices that meet U.S. industry standards.""

""Any suggestion that we are subject to foreign control or pose a national security risk is categorically false,"" it added.

The White House and Chinese state-owned telecom giants China Telecom, China Mobile and China Unicom did not respond to requests for comment about the measures and why they are on hold. Trump plans to visit Beijing in April, and has invited Xi to visit the U.S. later in the year.

All the measures that the administration has now paused were initially aimed at keeping Beijing from accessing and exploiting sensitive American data for blackmail or intellectual property theft and positioning itself deep within internet-connected systems to sabotage critical infrastructure, two of the sources said.

Secretary Howard Lutnick, two of the people said. The Commerce Department and Kessler did not respond to requests for comment on this description.

But after the October trade truce, leadership instructed staffers in the office charged with policing foreign tech threats to ""focus on Iran and Russia,"" two of the sources said. Iran is not viewed as a tech threat on par with China or Russia. Commerce did not comment on questions about its shift in focus.

Last month, the Commerce Department ousted the woman charged with leading the office. She will be replaced by Katelyn Christ, a political appointee with experience at the office, two sources said. Christ could potentially revive some of the measures if relations with China sour following the April summit between Trump and Xi, one of them added. Christ and Commerce did not comment.

But some China hawks say such measures cannot wait.  U.S. data center capacity is expected to grow by nearly 120% by 2030, according to global real estate firm Jones Lang LaSalle.

   David Feith, who served in Trump's first and second administrations, described Chinese-linked data center hardware as a growing national security threat and urged action to address it.    

American data centers could become ""remotely controlled islands of Chinese digital sovereignty,"" as the U.S. quietly builds ""strategic vulnerabilities into our AI and energy backbone,"" he said.

Wendy Cutler, a former acting deputy U.S. trade representative, now with the Asia Society Policy Institute, said it stands to reason that the administration would shelve punitive tech measures as it seeks ""stabilization"" with China.

""The Chinese have made it very clear that stabilization in their mind means no more export controls and other restrictive tech measures..., so particularly in the lead-up to the April visit to China, I would not expect the issuance of more… controls,"" she said, emphasizing China's potent threat of fresh curbs on rare-earth mineral exports. 

""Not only does it have leverage, it is willing to use it. It ties the president’s hands,"" she added. 

TP-Link contacted the Commerce Department last year with suggestions for ways it could address national security concerns, two sources said, clearing the path for a less restrictive regulation of its U.S. router sales.

In response to Reuters' questions about the measure targeting its technology, the company said its routers are not uniquely targeted for cyberattacks and that its code has been rigorously tested by U.S.-based experts to prevent the use of covert methods to bypass security controls. The company also said it has ""fully cooperated with the Commerce Department"" and does not comment on the ""specifics of a government investigation.""

By Eric Onstad and Pratima Desai

LONDON, Feb 11 (Reuters) - CME Group is working on a plan to launch the world's first futures contract in rare earths, three sources with knowledge of the matter told Reuters, in a move that would allow governments, companies and banks to hedge exposure to a sector controlled by China.

Rival Intercontinental Exchange is also looking at rare earth futures, but is not as advanced in its planning as the CME, two of the sources said.

CME declined to comment and ICE did not immediately respond to a request for comment.

One of the main stumbling blocks in the West's drive to cut dependence on China, which controls 90% of processed material, is banks' wariness of providing finance to Western projects in an industry swayed by volatile prices.   

Rare earths are a group of 17 elements vital for the energy transition, electronics and the defence sector.

TWO MOST IMPORTANT RARE EARTHS

CME, the world's largest derivatives marketplace, is working on a new futures contract combining the two most important rare earths, neodymium and praseodymium (NdPr), said the sources, who declined to be named because the information has not been released publicly.

The two elements, typically traded as a combined product, are rare earths needed to make permanent magnets, which are used in EV motors, wind turbines, fighter jets and drones. 

""It's such a key missing piece of the puzzle for the industry right now,"" one of the sources said.

No final decision has been taken regarding any launch. One challenge is that rare earths are thinly traded and the market is tiny compared to those for most other metals futures.

Rare earths are a crucial part of the West's efforts to work together to increase production of critical minerals, with the U.S. last week unveiling a preferential trade bloc with allies and launching a $12 billion strategic stockpile.

In the most high-profile U.S. deal in the rare earths sector, Washington agreed a multibillion-dollar package last July with MP Materials, including a 15% stake and a price floor based on the NdPr price.

PRICES SET IN CHINA

Currently, NdPr prices are set in China, reflected in indexes from price reporting agencies such as Fastmarkets, Benchmark Mineral Intelligence and Shanghai Metals Market.

China has two exchanges for the spot trading of rare earths - Ganzhou Rare Metal Exchange and Baotou Rare Earth Products Exchange. The Guangzhou Futures Exchange has said it plans to offer rare earths futures in the future.

Benchmark Mineral Intelligence has also started publishing rare earth prices based in Europe and North America, where volumes are thin.

According to SMM, NdPr prices based in China have surged by 40% so far this year, to the highest since July 2022, but in a sign of their volatility, tumbled by 50% during the 15 months to May 2023.  

Many rare earth mines and processing facilities outside of China struggle to get financing because banks are unable to forecast their future revenue and producers are unable to hedge potential price declines without futures.

Futures would also help industrial magnet consumers like EV makers hedge their exposure to magnet prices.

CME has already successfully launched futures in critical minerals lithium and cobalt, used in EV batteries.

Earlier this month, the CME reported fourth-quarter profit that beat Wall Street estimates and average daily volume that rose 7.5% to a record 27.4 million contracts.

# Feb. 11th, 2026~China controls 90% of rare earth processing. The West’s plan to catch up is running out of time

[China controls 90% of rare earth processing. The West’s plan to catch up is running out of time](https://www.msn.com/en-us/money/markets/china-controls-90-of-rare-earth-processing-the-west-s-plan-to-catch-up-is-running-out-of-time/ar-AA1W5FSM?ocid=BingNewsSerp)

China’s dominance of rare earth processing has quietly become one of the most consequential chokepoints in the global economy. According to the [International Energy Agency](https://www.iea.org/commentaries/with-new-export-controls-on-critical-minerals-supply-concentration-risks-become-reality), China accounts for about 60% of global rare earth mining for the key magnet elements, roughly 91% of refining and separation, and 94% of sintered permanent magnet production, the high-performance magnets that go into electric vehicle motors, wind turbines, missile guidance systems, and AI data center hardware. The [U.S. Geological Survey’s 2025 Mineral Commodity Summaries](https://pubs.usgs.gov/periodicals/mcs2025/mcs2025-rare-earths.pdf) reported that the United States was 80% import-reliant for rare earth compounds and metals in 2024, with China as the leading supplier, accounting for an estimated majority of that consumption when direct and indirect imports are combined.  
Western governments are now racing to rebuild capacity. The Trump administration has rolled out a $12 billion strategic mineral stockpile, taken direct equity stakes in miners, and assembled a 54-nation-plus-EU alliance to coordinate supply chains. But the response risks locking in dependence at precisely the moment demand for rare earth magnets is accelerating, driven by the electrification of transport, the buildout of renewable energy, and the explosion of AI infrastructure. The strategic dilemma is simple to state and far harder to solve: the West can mine more ore, but without its own refineries and magnet factories, it still has to send material back through Chinese plants.

# How deep the dominance runs

https://preview.redd.it/f7ge4lf952jg1.png?width=768&format=png&auto=webp&s=56473089db91c30b3e27663da20e5f4274f38bb5

The 17 rare earth elements are not actually rare in the earth’s crust. What is rare is the economic concentration of their processing. The IEA’s [Global Critical Minerals Outlook 2025](https://www.iea.org/reports/global-critical-minerals-outlook-2025/executive-summary) found that geographic concentration in refining has actually worsened: between 2020 and 2024, roughly 90% of supply growth in refined rare earths came from China. For the magnet-grade elements, neodymium, praseodymium, dysprosium, and terbium, China’s share jumps at each stage of the value chain: about 60% of mining, approximately 91% of separation and refining, and [94% of sintered permanent magnet manufacturing](https://www.iea.org/data-and-statistics/charts/china-s-share-in-rare-earth-magnet-production-2024). Two decades ago, China held about 50% of the sintered magnet market.

The monopoly is not in the resource itself, China holds about 44 million of the world’s roughly 115 million metric tons of proven reserves, according to the [USGS](https://pubs.usgs.gov/periodicals/mcs2025/mcs2025-rare-earths.pdf), but in what happens after extraction: the acid leaching, solvent extraction cascades, oxide separation, metallization, and sintering that transform raw ore into the magnets embedded in an F-35’s actuators or a Tesla’s drive motor. Even when new mines open in Australia, Canada, or the United States, they frequently still rely on Chinese separation capacity. By 2035, the IEA projects China will supply around three quarters of refined rare earth elements. If that supply were removed entirely, a scenario the IEA calls an “N-1 assessment”, remaining capacity would cover [only 35% to 40% of demand outside China](https://www.iea.org/reports/global-critical-minerals-outlook-2025/overview-of-outlook-for-key-minerals). No other critical mineral shows a gap that wide.

# From theoretical risk to active leverage

https://preview.redd.it/47b4soxc52jg1.png?width=768&format=png&auto=webp&s=2114a3543e877418ac1479ce9fdc2e300a165cdd

For years, rare earth concentration was a theoretical concern. That changed in 2025. On April 4, in retaliation for U.S. tariff escalations, China introduced export controls on seven heavy rare earth elements, including dysprosium and terbium. The IEA [reported](https://www.iea.org/commentaries/with-new-export-controls-on-critical-minerals-supply-concentration-risks-become-reality) that export volumes dropped sharply, automakers struggled to obtain permanent magnets, and rare earth prices in Europe surged to as much as six times Chinese domestic levels.

On October 9, Beijing escalated further, announcing controls that encompassed processing technologies, equipment, and finished products containing even 0.1% Chinese-origin rare earth content. For the first time, China explicitly [banned exports for foreign military end-use](https://www.csis.org/analysis/chinas-new-rare-earth-and-magnet-restrictions-threaten-us-defense-supply-chains), directly targeting the U.S. defense industrial base. A Trump-Xi summit in Busan on October 30 produced a [one-year suspension](https://www.whitehouse.gov/fact-sheets/2025/11/fact-sheet-president-donald-j-trump-strikes-deal-on-economic-and-trade-relations-with-china/) of the October controls. But Bloomberg [reported in December 2025](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2025-12-24/us-rare-earth-buyers-still-see-china-curbs-despite-trump-deal) that U.S. buyers were still unable to obtain key materials. Noveon Magnetics CEO Scott Dunn told Bloomberg: “People aren’t getting materials out of China.” And in January 2026, China [extended new restrictions to Japan](https://www.cnbc.com/2026/01/07/china-bans-dual-use-goods-exports-for-japan-military-over-taiwan-remarks.html), banning dual-use exports including rare earths to Japanese military end-users and slowing licensing reviews for broader commercial shipments.

“Xi was ready for Trump in his second term and has a powerful weapon in rare earths. China is getting the better of the US in these recent truce negotiations.”

# Washington’s response

The Trump administration has responded with arguably the most aggressive U.S. critical minerals policy in decades. The centerpiece is [MP Materials](https://investors.mpmaterials.com/investor-news/news-details/2025/MP-Materials-Reports-Third-Quarter-2025-Results/default.aspx), which operates the Mountain Pass mine in California. In July 2025, the Department of Defense struck a deal that included a [$400 million equity stake](https://www.energypolicy.columbia.edu/mp-materials-deal-marks-a-significant-shift-in-us-rare-earths-policy/), a guaranteed price floor for neodymium-praseodymium, a $150 million loan for heavy rare earth separation, and a commitment to purchase 100% of the magnets from a planned new facility. MP’s Fort Worth plant began commercial NdPr metal production in early 2025, with heavy rare earth separation at Mountain Pass expected by mid-2026.

The scale gap remains enormous. MP’s planned 1,000 metric tons of annual magnet output is less than 1% of China’s estimated production of over 130,000 metric tons. The administration has also taken equity stakes in [USA Rare Earth, Lithium Americas, and Trilogy Metals](https://www.aljazeera.com/economy/2026/2/2/what-is-the-us-strategic-minerals-stockpile), and backed a $1.6 billion investment in USA Rare Earth’s magnet facilities, targeted for 2028. On February 2, 2026, the president unveiled [Project Vault](https://www.exim.gov/news/project-vault), a $12 billion strategic mineral reserve combining a $10 billion Export-Import Bank loan with nearly $2 billion in private capital. The stockpile buys time, but as Fortune [noted](https://fortune.com/2026/02/03/project-vault-critical-minerals-stockpile-rare-earths-first-step-break-china-chokehold/), it is a “first step of many.”

Internationally, Secretary of State Marco Rubio hosted the [2026 Critical Minerals Ministerial](https://www.state.gov/releases/office-of-the-spokesperson/2026/02/2026-critical-minerals-ministerial) on February 4, announcing [FORGE](https://www.cnbc.com/2026/02/05/us-allies-critical-minerals-price-floors-forge-china-rare-earths-ai-chips-pax-silicchina-.html), the Forum on Resource Geostrategic Engagement, as a successor to the Biden-era Minerals Security Partnership. FORGE will establish reference prices at each production stage, enforced by tariffs to maintain a floor within the allied trade zone. The explicit target is China’s strategy of flooding markets with subsidized minerals to bankrupt emerging Western projects. Eleven countries signed bilateral agreements at the ministerial, with 17 more in negotiation.

# The clock problem

Across all of these initiatives, the fundamental constraint is time. Building a mine takes 7 to 15 years. Building refining capacity requires mastering solvent extraction processes and operating them reliably at scale. And building magnet manufacturing at scale requires downstream demand, which the administration has complicated by cutting incentives for the electric vehicles and wind turbines that consume the majority of rare earth magnets, as PBS [reported](https://www.pbs.org/newshour/world/watch-live-vance-delivers-address-at-state-department-summit-on-critical-mineral-supply).

MP Materials produced a record 45,000 metric tons of rare earth oxides at Mountain Pass in 2024, but ceased concentrate sales to China only in July 2025, meaning America’s flagship mine was shipping output to the very country the policy is designed to counter. Meanwhile, China is not standing still. The IEA notes that China’s share of magnet manufacturing remains near total in the segments that matter most for EVs, wind, and defense supply chains. Beijing has also [extended its regulatory reach extraterritorially](https://www.iea.org/commentaries/with-new-export-controls-on-critical-minerals-supply-concentration-risks-become-reality): from December 2025, its controls apply to internationally manufactured goods containing Chinese-sourced rare earths. As the European Parliament [noted](https://epthinktank.eu/2025/11/24/chinas-rare-earth-export-restrictions/), over 80% of large European firms are no more than three intermediaries away from a Chinese rare earth producer.

China’s rare earth leverage was four decades in the making. It will not be undone in four years. But the window to build a credible alternative is open and narrowing. If the West fails to convert its equity stakes, stockpiles, and ministerial communiqués into operating refineries and magnet factories within the next five years, Beijing’s processing monopoly will harden from a political vulnerability into a permanent structural feature of the global economy, and with it, the ability of democratic nations to build their own defense systems, power their own energy transitions, and develop their own AI infrastructure without relying on a geopolitical rival.

# Feb. 11th, 2026~US to build its largest primary aluminum plant with 500,000-ton annual capacity

At peak capacity, the smelter will produce 20,000 tons of high purity aluminum that can be used for defense applications.

[US to build largest aluminum plant with 500,000-ton annual capacity](https://interestingengineering.com/energy/500000-tons-a-year-new-us-aluminum-smelter)

[Opinion: The U.S. just restarted the aluminum machine. Niocorp is the scandium lever, IBC\/NAMA are the alloy pipeline, and defense demand is the buyer of last resort. That’s not a theory — that’s how ScAl becomes the next must-have military material.](https://preview.redd.it/zsizqujjc2jg1.png?width=474&format=png&auto=webp&s=0d17cfe366b70f20111e2367f84d5f2ceb056fde)

The US is set to build its first aluminum smelter since the 1980s, with a potential production capacity of 500,000 tons a year, marking a major shift in its aluminum production policy and reducing reliance on imports. The project is set to be built by Century Aluminum, a US-based aluminum producer, in Inola, Oklahoma, according to a press release. 

Aluminum is known for its lightweight and corrosion-resistant properties, alongside its strength, thermal conductivity, and malleability. Its versatile properties have found applications across a range of industries, from aerospace and consumer goods to power distribution and packaging.  

In the past, the US was the leading producer of aluminum. At its peak, the 33 smelters in the US produced over 5 million tons of aluminum annually. But the number has since reduced to just four sites with an output of 683,500 metric tons. This has increased the US’s reliance on aluminum imports, which reached 5.46 million metric tons in 2024.  

The US government’s policy is to reshore manufacturing and safeguard its supply of critical minerals. The upcoming smelter in Oklahoma is the result of this policy. 

# What will the smelter do? 

A smelter is designed to extract pure [aluminum](https://interestingengineering.com/science/mit-aluminum-alloy-stronger) from its oxide, also known as alumina. This is an electrolytic process in which alumina is dissolved in a bath at temperatures up to 1796 degrees Fahrenheit (980 degrees Celsius). 

When an electric current is passed through the bath, pure aluminum settles to the bottom of the pot, where it is siphoned off, purified, and used to make alloys or other products. Century Aluminum currently operates four smelters, three of which are based in the US and the other in Iceland. 

Last year, the Office of Clean Energy Demonstrations (OECD) awarded Century Aluminum $500 million to advance the construction of the first primary smelter in the US since 1980. When complete, the smelter will have a production capacity of 500,000 tons of aluminum per year, including 20,000 tons of high-purity aluminum for defense applications, the press release said. 

# Revitalizing US manufacturing

The plan to build a new smelter in Inola shows the US’s determination to onshore the production of critical minerals. Century Aluminum has also teamed up with Emirates Global Aluminum (EGA), which will fund part of the billion-dollar investment required for the smelter. 

This is part of a larger strategic plan to build plants in the US and create more jobs. “This project could not have been realized without President Trump’s commitment to revitalizing this country’s manufacturing base and reducing our reliance on foreign suppliers,” said Chris Wright, US Secretary of Energy, in the [press release](https://www.energy.gov/articles/energy-department-awardee-build-first-american-aluminum-smelter-1980).

“Century Aluminum’s joint venture shows how President Trump’s economic policies are encouraging global companies to partner with U.S. firms, build here in America, and create good-paying American jobs.”

With high [aluminum](https://interestingengineering.com/science/aluminum-alloys-with-higher-strength-developed) demand but little bauxite reserves (aluminum ore), the US is heavily reliant on other countries for this metal. However, instead of procuring aluminum, the US now plans to process it onshore and develop recycling approaches to secure its supply chain. 

# FORM YOUR OWN OPINIONS & CONCLUSIONS ABOVE:

[Sc-Al alloy isn’t a science project anymore — it’s a DoD + Prime-level requirement if the U.S. is serious about next-gen airframes, range extension, weight reduction, and high-performance systems. If scandium gets swept into price floors or stockpile logic like the 2025 Rio\/DLA-style deal level, Elk Creek becomes bankable overnight.](https://reddit.com/link/1r2slhx/video/b9xw8i4l52jg1/player)

# Opinion:🔥The U.S. Just Flinched on China — Rare Earths Are the Weapon, & Niocorp Is a part of the Answer

**Reuters basically dropped the receipts this week: the U.S. is** ***quietly backing off China tech restrictions*** **ahead of the April Trump–Xi summit… because China’s rare earth threat is now strong enough to shape American policy. Let that sink in.**

We’re not talking theory anymore — rare earths are now powerful enough that the U.S. is shelving telecom + data center + EV security actions just to avoid antagonizing Beijing. That’s not “trade détente.” That’s leverage. **And Reuters literally spells it out: China pledged to delay painful export restrictions on rare earths — and the U.S. responded by pumping the brakes on China tech curbs.**

At the exact same time, Reuters reports CME is working on launching the **first-ever rare earth futures contract**, likely NdPr (Neodymium + Praseodymium). That is MASSIVE and people aren’t connecting the dots. **The #1 reason Western rare earth projects can’t get financed is banks won’t touch them without hedging tools. Rare earth pricing is thin, volatile, and basically “set in China.” A real NdPr futures market is a financing unlock. It’s a signal that rare earths are about to get treated like a real strategic commodity — not some niche exotic metal. That’s the market infrastructure being built in real time.**

Now zoom out: China controls \~90% of rare earth processing and \~94% of sintered magnet manufacturing. Meaning: even if the West mines more rock, it still gets funneled through Chinese refining, separation, metallization, and magnets. That’s the choke point. And the kicker? Data centers, AI buildout, drones, hypersonics, EV motors, wind turbines, missile guidance — ALL of it is magnet + alloy dependent. So while the U.S. is quietly “stabilizing” relations, it’s also admitting it’s not ready for a hard decoupling. Which means the clock is ticking and the U.S. is scrambling.

**Enter Niocorp — and this is where the market is asleep at the wheel.** Niocorp is not “just a rare earth miner.” It’s one of the only U.S. projects positioned to produce a **stack** of what the defense-industrial base actually needs: **Niobium (Nb), Scandium (Sc), Titanium (Ti) + TiCl₄, AND magnet REEs (Nd, Pr, Dy, Tb)**. That’s **seven critical minerals** in one integrated U.S. pipeline. That’s not optional. That’s literally the ingredient list for next-gen aerospace, hypersonics, AI infrastructure, and permanent magnet supply chains.

And here’s the part that should have everyone’s attention: Niocorp’s timing lines up perfectly with Washington’s emergency timeline. **Final DFS in March 2026.** Offtakes next. Management has been telegraphing a **mid-2026 EXIM FID** path. Meanwhile the U.S. just rolled out **Project VAULT** (strategic stockpile + financing) and **FORGE** (allied pricing floors + tariff enforcement). These are not “policy announcements.” These are WWII-style industrial mobilization tools. They only matter if there are real projects ready to go. Elk Creek is one of the few.

Bottom line: Reuters just confirmed rare earths are now geopolitical weapons — and China is using them to influence U.S. decisions in telecom, AI, and EV infrastructure. The U.S. response is to build an allied supply chain FAST: VAULT, FORGE, futures markets, stockpiles, and financing mechanisms. That’s the exact lane Niocorp is built for. The market is still valuing it like a sleepy pre-production miner… while the macro is screaming that critical minerals are now national security assets. When the March DFS lands, and off-takes + EXIM move into focus, this disconnect won’t last.

And here’s where the **HAMMER HITS HARD**: Niocorp isn’t a “single-metal story.” It’s **SEVEN critical minerals** — and the timing is surgical. **March = final DFS.** Then the real dominoes start falling: **offtakes.** Then **mid-2026 = EXIM FID**, which management has been openly telegraphing for months. Meanwhile, the macro just snapped into focus: USGS has confirmed the strategic logic, the **DoD already funded the scandium alloy pipeline**, and Washington just rolled out the global **price + financing architecture** (VAULT / FORGE / futures) designed to make projects like Elk Creek bankable and unstoppable. Wall Street can play games at $6 all it wants — but the fundamentals are shifting under their feet in real time. Because in Mark Smith’s words: **“Elk Creek is a National Strategic Asset.”** And when offtakes start getting inked, price floors start getting baked into VAULT/FORGE frameworks, and EXIM locks the FID — this doesn’t re-rate like a junior miner… it re-rates like a U.S.-backed strategic platform. And the shorts are going to learn the hard way what **“National Strategic Asset”** really means.

1r2slfw,https://i.redd.it/qy3dxpvd42jg1.jpeg,How long do you keep ice cream in your freezer? Do certain brands last longer?,"A question for obsessive ice cream hoarders and friendly food scientists alike: How long do you keep your ice cream? Does it depend on the brand, or maybe the flavor?

Whereas I used to buy a couple pints at a time, finish and repeat, now I'm hunting stores for weird flavors, ordering online and taking advantage of big deals to stock up. As a result, my freezer stays crowded. I always assumed ice cream would be good for like a year totally frozen, if it lasted that long.

But I recently brought out some Haagen-Dazs that had been stored after a sale in the fall and the freezer was less than kind, giving it a grainy, offputting texture, though the flavor seemed OK. Contrast that with a Jeni's pint that had been living in there since a sale in July. I recently opened it; it was perfectly creamy. I wondered if it was because peanut butter has so much fat in it. Or if Jeni's is just packed with stabilizers?

From what I could tell on Google, it's a little of both, but Jeni has a little secret she uses with nonfat milk powder, tapioca syrup and cream cheese — which absorb excess water and stave off large ice crystals. Meanwhile, H-D relies on egg yolks over gums, so it has a shorter lifespan. Google says  peak freshness for brands like H-D, Graeter's and Van Leeuwen is 2-3 months unopened, while others with stabilizers can last 6-9 months.  
  
But some of the info is sort of contradictory and confusing (as happens with AI),  so I'm curious to hear anecdotally from people who tend to store ice cream a while, along with some of you have some expertise in the field. Are there tricks you use? (I think I'll probably wrap H-D in particular in plastic if I'm not eating with a week.) Are there brands you feel last longer? I think some Graeter's has been fine for me after 3 months, but I get them shipped right from the company. What's left unknown is how long H-D has been sitting in a warehouse or the back of a store or on shelves before I take it home.",12,1770900674.0,icecream,11,0.88,False
