ALAN RUSSELL

They found the bodies on Sunday.

I heard about it before I even saw the papers, before the whispers started rolling through town like a slow-moving sickness, twisting their way through the streets, through the diners, through the school hallways. News like that doesn’t spread. It seeps, like blood through fabric. By the time the sun had fully risen, everyone knew.

By noon, the story was already set in stone.

Kevin and Don, drunk or high or both, had wandered out to the train tracks in the dead of night, draped themselves in a tarp, and fallen into such a deep, careless sleep that they hadn’t woken up when a thousand-ton train came bearing down on them at sixty miles an hour.

By evening, their names were cautionary tales, spoken in hushed, disapproving tones.

By Monday morning, they were just another small-town tragedy, another set of parents left burying their sons, another gruesome accident that no one wanted to think too hard about.


The conductor had seen them first, lying just past the junction outside of town, a few miles down the old freight line where the rust crept up the rails and weeds poked through the gravel. The tarp covering them was blue, weathered by the elements, barely distinguishable from the ground in the dark.

At first, he thought it was debris, a bundle of junk left behind by drifters or careless hunters. But as he got closer, the shape became clearer, more deliberate—two forms beneath the fabric, motionless, long limbs sprawled awkwardly over the steel rails.

He hit the horn. They didn’t move.

He threw the brakes. The train didn’t stop.

It took nearly a mile for it to slow, for the screeching metal to finally drag to a halt, but by then, it was too late.

By then, the bodies had already been torn apart, scattered across the tracks in dark, wet ribbons, pieces flung into the grass, into the gravel, into the deep ditches lining the junction like open graves.

The crew searched the scene with grim, reluctant hands, collecting what was left of Kevin’s arms, Don’s ribs, fragments of skull and torn fabric, piecing them together like a grotesque puzzle. That’s when they noticed that the blood wasn’t red. It was thick and purple, clotted like syrup, far too viscous, soaking into the ground in sluggish, gelatinous pools.

Any doctor, any forensic pathologist, any damn coroner with half a brain could tell you what that meant.

By the time the steel wheels tore through the bodies, splitting flesh from bone, scattering viscera across the tracks, they had already been dead.

I wasn’t a doctor. Neither was Mac or Heather. None of us had the medical knowledge to stand in that morgue and tell them they were full of shit, to point at the viscous, purple blood pooling in the plastic bags and tell them that people don’t die like that.

The medical examiner—Dr. Yasin Halak, a man who had been working in Ashwood longer than I had been alive, longer than my mother had lived here—gave the official cause of death at noon.

The boys had gone hunting, as they often did, but this time, they had gotten reckless. They had gotten stoned off their asses on “the dreaded marijuana,” lost track of time, lost track of their minds, stumbled onto the train tracks, and, for some unfathomable reason, pulled a tarp over themselves and passed out cold, dead to the world.

So dead, apparently, that a roaring freight train had not been enough to stir them from their sleep.

So dead that they hadn’t moved when the engine bore down on them, hadn’t twitched when the horn blared, hadn’t so much as shifted when the wheels finally met flesh.

Halak stood at that podium, in front of the whole town, and said this with a straight face.

Like Don, who had spent half his life handling firearms, tracking animals, surviving in the woods, would’ve decided to just fall asleep on the goddamn train tracks after smoking a little weed.

Like Kevin, who had been the lightest lightweight I had ever known, who never got high when we went night spotting because he was too paranoid about making a mistake, would have just let it happen.

He said it like it was reasonable, like it made sense, like we were all supposed to just accept it and move on.

And the worst part?

Most people did.


Don’s mother stood stone-faced at the service, her grief too deep to bend into words, her bodies too hollowed out to hold onto anything but the weight of loss. Don’s brothers, Nathan, Oliver, and little Sam sat behind her, shaky-legged and confused. Oliver and Sam were young, too young to understand that Don wasn’t coming home, tugging Nathan’s sleeve, asking if they could go to the catering table—and Nathan was too young to look as old as he did, the lines of loss etching themselves deep into the twelve-year old’s youthful face. He looked more like Don every day.

Kevin’s father was hit the hardest. He stood for the entire service, eyes firmly locked on the coffin of the last member of his family, silent tears streaming down the practiced iron face of a United States Marine. It occurred to me that this was the first time I had ever seen him without a bottle in his hand, something he explained when he gave his eulogy.

“I-I could have been a better father. Coming back, I wasn’t ready, I turned to the bottle to… try to deal with it. Kevin-Kevin looked up to me like you wouldn’t believe, thought I was a hero, and I let him down. Everyday. Watching his little face fall was worse than anything I ever had to do over there. But I… didn’t change and I guess he tried to deal with it the only way he knew—the way I did. If… if that shit did that to my boy, I’m never touching a drop of it again, memories be damned.”

After he walked off the stage with the brisk steps of a broken soldier, they brought up a bunch of Kevin and Don’s old teachers and classmates. We sat in the church pews, listening to people who had never really known them talk about them like they had, feeling our teeth press into our tongues as we tried to hold back the things we really wanted to say.

That it wasn’t their fault.

That they hadn’t died like that.

The town had already cried for them, for the boys they thought they knew. For the cautionary tale they had turned them into.

Kevin and Don, the reckless, foolish kids who had thrown their lives away in a haze of smoke and bad decisions, who had been claimed by the same stupid vices that had claimed a hundred others before them.

They didn’t get to be the boys we knew. They didn’t get to be smart, or funny, or stupid in the way that made life fun instead of tragic.

They didn’t get to be people anymore.

They were just a story now, another cautionary tale, another lesson to scare the younger kids straight, a tragedy they could shake their heads at over coffee, muttering about how they had thrown their lives away over drugs and bad decisions.


We should have said something.

We should have stood up, right there in that church, and screamed the truth at the top of our lungs, that their bodies had been dumped there, left like garbage on the tracks to be found.

But we didn’t.

Mac’s hands hadn’t stopped shaking since the moment we’d walked in. Heather hadn’t looked up from her lap. I sat there, gripping Kevin’s old lighter so tightly it left an indent in my palm, staring at the polished caskets at the front of the room, knowing—no one was in them. Not really, not the way they had been. The pieces of them had been collected. Put back together as best they could be.

But the real Don, the real Kevin—they had been gone long before that train hit them. 

I sure as hell didn’t trust the police, not after what we had seen. I knew better than to walk into that station and ask questions, but I needed to know, now more than ever.

I had other leads, people who might have been willing to talk if they thought I was the only one listening.

Greg O’Neal had told me to wait for his call. I had been waiting ever since.

Now, with Kevin and Don buried beneath the dirt, I wasn’t waiting anymore.

That night, after the funeral, after the murmured condolences, after Mac had punched a hole in the wall of my garage and Heather had sobbed into my shoulder for hours, I grabbed my father’s gun and I went looking for answers.




HEATHER ROBINSON


Alan held me like he knew I might break.

Like if he let go, I would crumble to pieces, scatter at his feet like shattered glass, slip between the cracks in the floor and disappear completely. I pressed my face into his shoulder, breathing in the scent of wood smoke and old leather, my fingers clutching at the fabric of his jacket, digging in like I could hold myself together by holding onto him.

The grief didn’t come all at once.

It bled in slow, crawling waves, filling the spaces between my ribs, creeping up my throat, pooling behind my eyes. I didn’t cry at first—just stood there, trembling, silent, too hollowed out to process the depth of what I had lost.

And then it hit me, all at once, like a tidal wave crashing over a broken levy.

Kevin was gone.

Don was gone.

The weight of those words pressed down on me, crushed me, swallowed me whole.

I broke and Alan let me.

There were no more stupid inside jokes, no more late-night drives, no more drunken confessions whispered between cigarette drags, no more Don rolling his eyes and Kevin making some sarcastic quip to lighten the mood.

There was just this hole, this sickening, gaping wound that had opened inside my chest, something I could never fill again.

And it hurt.

God, it hurt.

I don’t know how long I cried, but Alan didn’t let go. He just stood there, holding me up, like he knew I couldn’t stand on my own anymore.



I left shortly after, still dizzy with grief, still raw, like my insides had been scraped out and left in the dirt beside their caskets.

The wind was cold as I walked, cutting through the thin fabric of my dress, stinging my skin. I kept my arms wrapped tightly around myself, head down, feet moving automatically over the familiar road that led toward home. The pavement stretched ahead of me in long, jagged cracks, veins splitting through the asphalt like the town itself was coming apart.

Then, a sound—the low, slow roll of tires creeping up beside me.

The glow of headlights crawled along the street, reaching for my shadow, stretching it long and thin against the ground.

I knew who it was before he spoke.

“Hey.”

Trevor’s voice was too casual, too normal, like he was greeting me in the school parking lot instead of pulling up beside me on the way home from my dead friends’ funeral.

I kept walking.

The truck slowed, keeping pace with me.

“What’s wrong?” he asked, genuinely confused, like he didn’t already know, like he hadn’t been somewhere else, anywhere else, instead of sitting next to me in that church pew.

My hands curled into fists.

A sharp, bitter laugh pushed its way up my throat, but I swallowed it down, clenched my jaw, forced myself to breathe. I turned my head just enough to see his face, to take in the way he tilted his head in mild confusion, unbothered, unaffected, like he had never known them, never known me.

Something inside me cracked.

And I realized, with startling, suffocating clarity—

I hated him.

I hated his detachment, his self-importance, the way he could so effortlessly pretend that nothing had changed. I hated the fact that he hadn’t been there, hadn’t thought to call, hadn’t thought to ask if I was okay until I was walking alone in the dark with grief bleeding out of me in short, sharp, arterial bursts.

I turned back.

Kept walking.

“Hey—Heather.” His voice tightened, just a little, that edge of frustration creeping in. “Come on, don’t be like that.”

His car sped up for a second, pulling ahead, then slowed again, the tires grinding against the pavement.

I didn’t look at him. Didn’t stop. Didn’t care how pissed he was. I just walked, straight to my house, straight inside and slammed the door shut behind me.

I didn’t turn on the lights.

Just peeled off my dress, kicked off my shoes, crawled under the covers, and stared at the ceiling. But something felt… off.

It was subtle at first, just a tickle at the back of my skull, something I couldn’t place.

The air in the room was too thick, too heavy, pressing down on my skin like a damp cloth. The silence was too deep, stretched tight like a wire, like it was just waiting to snap.

I turned onto my side.

Told myself I was imagining things. I was just tired, grieving, paranoid.

But I couldn’t shake the feeling that I wasn’t alone.




I woke up to the sound of breathing.

Not my own.

Not… human.

Something slow. Something measured. Something wet.

The air in my room was thick with it, damp and unnatural, each inhale slow, rattling, wet, like something sucking air through hollowed-out bone. The sound slithered over my skin, pressing into my ears, crawling down my throat like smoke, pooling in my lungs like a second presence, something inside me, something breathing with me.

I tried to move.

I couldn’t.

A weight pinned me down, crushing my chest into the mattress, pressing my arms into my sides, my muscles locked into place like I had been buried alive.

I could feel it.

Something was sitting on me, pinning me to the mattress, pressing my body down into the sheets with deliberate cruelty, allowing me just enough breath to stay awake, to keep struggling, to remain trapped in the moment where waking turned to nightmare and nightmare turned to something worse.

My skin crawled, the back of my neck prickling like when I was a child, when I used to lie awake at night, convinced something was waiting in the closet, beneath my bed, just out of sight.

I wasn’t wrong back then.

I wasn’t wrong now.

And if I looked, if I let my gaze slip toward the darkness pooling in the corners of my bedroom, toward the places where my childhood nightmares had always waited for me, if I dared to look too closely—

I would see the others, too.





The closet door was open.

I didn’t remember leaving it open.

It hadn’t been open when I went to bed.

But now, in the suffocating dark, it had cracked just enough to reveal the narrow stretch of empty floor, the space between my hanging clothes, the place where I used to imagine glowing eyes blinking back at me from the void.

Something moved inside.

It was not solid, not a figure, not a shape, but rather the absence of a shape, an unraveling of reality, thick and black as ink, shifting in the dim light, pulsing, the suggestion of a form flickering in and out of existence.

Then—

The tips of black, razor-sharp claws curled around the edge of the doorframe, sinking into the wood.

It was steadying itself.

It had been waiting for me to notice.

A horrible, slow shudder rippled through the dark, and then it leaned forward, just slightly, just enough to be sure I knew—

It was looking at me.

The air grew colder, pressing into my ears, my ribs, my throat. I could feel the sheets beneath me, feel the mattress at my back—

And then, I felt something shift below me, a gentle, almost playful movement.

A pressure pressing up into my spine. Something was beneath the bed.

I had been afraid of this, once—when I was four, five, six years old, lying awake at night, legs curled up so they wouldn’t dangle over the side, so nothing could grab me, yank me down, pull me under.

I wasn’t four years old anymore, but I had never been more convinced that if I set one foot on the floor, I would be dragged into something I wouldn’t return from.

The breathing was closer now, curling over the mattress from all directions, seeping from the floorboards, from the corners of the room, from the spaces where darkness stretched too deep, where it pooled in places it had no right to be.

The creaking started, slow and deliberate, my headboard shaking ever so slightly. 

I couldn’t see past the edge of my mattress, but I felt it moving, shifting its weight from one foot to the other, measured, careful, like it didn’t want to wake me up.

It was closer than the first one, too close.

The stench of smoke and rotting meat filled my nostrils, thick and cloying, sinking into my skin, curling against my tongue.

It moved again. It was not solid, not completely.

I could see it out of the corner of my eye, a shape unraveling, folding into itself, shifting like liquid shadow, like a cloud of black ink spilled across water, its outline flickering in and out of reality, its presence undeniable even when it disappeared completely.

It was watching me.

It was hovering over me.

I could feel it leaning in, face hovering inches from mine, breath curling hot and damp against my cheek.

The smell of blood was thick in the air.

Something in the closet shifted again, fingers tightening around the wood, the unseen weight on my chest growing heavier, heavier, heavier, the edges of my vision dimming.

And suddenly I was back in middle school.

Mr. Corbin had fallen in a twisted heap of broken limbs and fabric, like something that had been dropped rather than collapsed, his fingers still curled into the fabric of his slacks, his back arched unnaturally, as if the bullet had locked him into place.

I had stared at him, unable to reconcile the shape of his body with the shape of the man he had been, watching as the blood crawled between the tiles, as thick and slow and endless as the River Lethe.

I had squeezed my eyes shut then, trying to pretend it wasn’t real, trying to pretend I wasn’t seeing it, that if I stopped looking, it would stop existing.

It hadn’t worked then, it wouldn’t work now.

Because I could still see him, could still see the way his mouth had fallen open, lips twisted in a way that no longer belonged to him, his face empty, hollow, frozen in the moment when he realized he was about to die.

And something in the darkness—something woven from inky black smoke and elongated limbs—laughed.

The weight on my chest never lessened, but I could feel a new presence, a new shape pressing into the mattress at my back, something curling itself around my spine, winding through my ribs like ivy, seeping into the spaces where I had long since stopped believing anything holy remained.

Its fingers trailed lightly over the skin of my neck, feather-light, tender, almost affectionate.

And then—a sound above me, a slow, wet clicking.

I had always been afraid of this, the idea that something could perch on the headboard of my bed, looking down at me while I slept, curling its claws into the wood, waiting for me to wake up so I could see it.

I wouldn’t look.

I wouldn’t look.

I wouldn’t—

It was not solid, not fully formed, an unraveling thing, shifting between states, visible and not, present and not, real and not, a creature made of ink and shadow, pouring through my bed frame, coiling beneath my sheets, wrapping its tendrils around my wrists like bracelets made of bone.

Something sharp pressed into my wrists. A long, curved raven’s talon, curling against my pulse, tracing the delicate, vulnerable stretch of skin, where my veins rose close to the surface.

And then, with a slow, deliberate pressure, it sank into my wrists.

Pain erupted in twin streaks of fire, sharp and hot, sending a bolt of electricity up my arms, every nerve ending screaming at once. My vision blurred, my breath ripped from my lungs in a silent, shuddering gasp.

Something wet dripped down my arms. The thing above me pressed closer, whispering something I couldn’t understand, something too old and too heavy and too broken for human ears.

And then—I woke up.

Jerking violently, gasping for air, hands flying to my wrists, breath shattering in my throat as I ran my fingers over the skin that should have been smooth, should have been whole.

It wasn’t.

Two long, deep scratches ran the length of my wrists, carved into my flesh like a signature welling with blood.

The closet door was still open. The room was as still as a mausoleum.

And in the shadows where my nightmares had always lived—

Something breathed, waiting for me to sleep again.



ALAN RUSSELL

I found Greg O’Neal’s address the old-fashioned way—sifting through old phone books, talking to the right people, using my fake id to pay for a couple of drinks at Callahan’s, and finally, after piecing together information like a puzzle made of half-rotted scraps, I had an address.

It sat in a part of town that felt like it had been forgotten on purpose, a place where the paint peeled faster than people could afford to cover it up, where the sidewalks were cracked and buckling, where the streetlights burned too dim or not at all.

By the time I pulled up, the sun was just beginning to break the horizon, a pale slit of dull pink light barely strong enough to push through the lingering night.

I should have been the first one there, but I wasn’t.

Two Dodge Polaras sat parked in front of the house, their red and blue lights casting eerie pulses across the overgrown lawn, illuminating the strips of yellow crime scene tape that flapped lazily in the early morning breeze.

And the front door—the front door was wide open.

I killed the engine and slid out of my truck, pulling my jacket tighter around myself as I made my way up the cracked sidewalk, shoulders tense, jaw clenched, the Tokarev TT-33 resting like a quiet promise beneath the layers of fabric, the metal icy cold against my skin.

I really needed to buy a holster.

The air reeked of something sour, something rotten, a stench so thick it made the back of my throat tighten. I had smelled blood before, smelled bodies left too long in places they weren’t supposed to be, but this was something different. Something worse.

The stink curled into my nostrils, settled into my lungs, and as I stepped closer, I saw it. Just past the officers standing at the door, past the flickering glow of cheap overhead bulbs, just barely visible through the open doorway—a corpse, sitting upright.

Headless.

One of the officers swiveled around, turning towards me before I could get any closer.

“Crime scene’s closed.”

I pulled my hands from my jacket pockets, raising them in an easy, slow-moving gesture. “Didn’t know there was a crime scene, officer.”

His eyes narrowed. “Then why are you here?”

I let my expression stay neutral, ignoring the tight coil of unease winding its way up my spine.

“Friend of a friend told me Greg O’Neal lived here. Haven’t heard from him in a few days.”

The other officer—younger, thinner, the kind of guy who still looked nervous when he put on the badge in the morning—shifted uncomfortably before speaking.

“Yeah, well. You won’t be hearing from him now.”

I didn’t ask what’d happened, I didn’t have to. I had already seen enough.

But the first officer—the older one, built like a brick wall, with eyes that looked like they had seen a thousand things no man should ever see—decided I should hear it anyway.

“Neighbor called it in,” he said, voice gruff, tired, the tone of a man who had been awake too long and had seen too much. “Said the smell was leaking out onto the street. We get here, we knock, we get no answer. We step inside, and there he is. Melting into the goddamn couch.”

His lip curled slightly, and for a moment, I saw the raw, unfiltered disgust in his eyes, the thing he was trying to swallow down, bury, forget.

“The top half of him, anyway.”

I didn’t ask where the head was.

They didn’t know, or maybe they did, and they didn’t want to say it out loud. I had seen enough strange things to know that some wounds didn’t bleed the way they were supposed to, that some deaths weren’t meant to be neatly written down in a coroner’s report.

Something felt wrong about this, though. Not just the body, not just the missing head. The house itself was too quiet, not the kind of quiet that came from an empty building, but the kind of quiet that came from something waiting, something watching, something pressing against the walls just beneath the surface, curling its fingers into the floorboards, stretching through the drywall.

Something had happened here and whatever it was—it hadn’t left.

I was about to turn back when the dog came out.

The first thing I noticed was the blood.

It was matted into its fur, dried and crusted in dark, jagged streaks, caking the white of its paws, staining the gray of its snout. It snarled and thrashed, teeth bared, foam bubbling at the edges of its mouth, the leash wrapped tight around the wrist of one of the officers as he struggled to drag the animal toward the car.

“Son of a bitch hasn’t let anyone near him since we got here,” the younger officer muttered, keeping his distance.

“Wouldn’t either, if I’d been locked in here for days with a corpse.”

I watched as they forced the dog into the backseat of one of the Dodge Polaras, the metal door slamming shut behind it.

It kept snarling, snapping, eyes wild, like it wasn’t sure if it wanted to attack or run or rip the whole goddamn world apart.

Something about it didn’t sit right.

Dogs mourned, dogs starved, dogs howled and whimpered and shrank beneath the weight of grief and loneliness.

But this?

This dog was angry.

And for some reason, that scared me more than the body.

I had come looking for answers.

Instead, I had found a corpse with no head, a house that smelled like death, and a dog that had seen something no living being could understand.

I had nothing.

No leads. No direction. No next move.

I shoved my hands into my jacket pockets, turning back toward my truck, keeping my eyes on the cracked pavement as I walked, forcing myself not to look back at the house, not to let my mind pick apart the way the door still stood open, how the shadows inside seemed darker than they should have been, deeper than they should have been.

I climbed into the driver’s seat and turned the key. The engine rumbled to life beneath my hands. I sat there for a moment, gripping the wheel, staring at my own reflection in the windshield, watching the red and blue lights flicker over my skin.

I needed a holster, I needed a plan, and most of all—

I needed to know what the hell had happened to Greg O’Neal.


The night was thick with humidity, the air clinging to my skin like a second layer. Greg O’Neal’s house stood ahead, dark and hollow, abandoned in the wake of his murder. The yellow police tape still fluttered against the porch railing, curling at the edges, but no one was watching this place anymore.

I stepped over the tape, my boots hitting the wooden steps with a soft creak. The door was still open—just enough for me to slip inside. The stench hit me immediately, thick and rotten, the kind of smell that burrows into your sinuses and lingers. Death. Even after they’d taken the body, scrubbed the floors, it still sat heavy in the air.

I pulled the collar of my jacket up, breathing through my mouth as I moved through the small living room. The furniture was cheap and well-worn, a sagging couch pushed against the wall, a stained recliner in the corner. A coffee table sat between them, littered with old magazines, cigarette butts, and a ring of dried blood where something—someone—had sat.

I crouched down, examining the dried stain. Greg had been dead for days before they found him, his dog half-starved by the door. There were things here that didn’t add up, and I wasn’t leaving without answers.

I moved toward the back of the house, careful not to disturb anything. The bedroom door was slightly ajar, the hinges groaning as I pushed it open. The bed was unmade, sheets still tangled, like someone had been in a hurry. A dresser stood against the far wall, drawers hanging open, empty. Someone had been here before me.

I stepped closer, my eyes catching on something wedged between the dresser and the wall. A scrap of paper, folded and creased. I crouched, pulling it free, unfolding it with careful fingers. The ink was smudged, but I could still make out the words.

PETERSON COMP STA #12—01:30

A date was scrawled beneath it, a week before Greg was found dead. I stared at it for a long moment, my pulse thrumming in my ears. He had known something. He’d gone out there for a reason, and whatever he’d found had cost him his life.

My pulse jumped as I heard a noise, soft, barely there, but enough to send a prickle down my spine. I turned sharply, scanning the darkened doorway. The house settled around me, the wind whispering through the open front door. There was nothing, only my nerves. I exhaled slowly, tucking the paper into my pocket before moving back toward the living room. I needed to check the kitchen, see if Greg had left anything behind—notes, receipts, anything.

I barely made it two steps before something slammed into the side of my jaw.

Pain exploded through my skull, bright and searing. My vision blurred, my knees buckling as I staggered, catching myself against the wall. Another hit—this one harder. My head snapped to the side, stars bursting behind my eyes, my body giving out beneath me.

The floor rushed up to meet me.

Then there was nothing.


I woke up in a jail cell that smelled like sweat, old paper, and the sharp, metallic tang of dried blood—the kind you don’t notice at first, but lingers beneath the surface, clinging to the air, waiting to be acknowledged. I sat up on the edge of my cot, elbows resting on my knees, watching the bars in front of me with the kind of measured patience that only came when you knew no one was coming to help you.

The silence pressed against me, thick and unmoving, broken only by the steady ticking of the clock on the wall, its hands moving with the slow, mechanical certainty of something that had seen more men wait out long nights than I could ever count. I rubbed my jaw, feeling the faint bruise forming there, and exhaled through my nose.

Then came the footsteps, boots against linoleum, the shift of a belt, the soft jingle of keys tapping against metal. I just listened as they came closer, as they stopped just beyond the bars, as a familiar weight settled into the air like a hand pressing firm against the back of my neck.

I finally lifted my gaze. Wilkes was standing there, one hand on his belt, the other holding a paper cup, steam curling from its rim. The old man took a slow sip of coffee, then let out a long sigh, shaking his head. ""Hell of a mess you got yourself in.""
For a second, just a second, it felt like being twelve again.

Like I was sitting cross-legged on the floor of his office, listening to him spin stories about Samson and his jawbone, about David and his sling, about all the times when God didn’t spare the sinners, when the ground cracked open and swallowed them whole, when fire rained from the sky and turned entire cities to dust.

The stories they never told in church, but that he was always eager to share, delighting in the details.

“You’re real lucky, though,” Wilkes said, taking a slow sip of coffee. “If it were anybody else, they might’ve decided to charge you with something a little more serious than a night in jail.”

I snorted, rolling my shoulders. “On what, trespassing?”

Wilkes hummed, shifting his head slightly. “Could’ve been breaking and entering. Maybe even attempted burglary, if they were feelin’ mean about it.”

I tilted my head slightly, glancing at the bars between us. ""You know I had to try and find out what happened.""

Something flickered in Wilkes’ face, but it was gone before I could name it. The sheriff sighed, a deep, weary sound, and leaned back in his chair, rubbing a hand over his face like a man who had spent too many nights awake, watching over something he couldn’t protect.

“You’re reckless, son,” Wilkes said finally, his voice lower now, not scolding, but something else. Something softer. “You run around this town kicking up dust, looking under rocks that oughta stay put, and one day, you’re gonna find something you wish you hadn’t.”

I raised one weary eyebrow. “You worried about me, Sheriff?”

Wilkes exhaled sharply, shaking his head. “Course I am.” He looked down at the desk, tapping one finger against the wood. “Watched you grow up. Watched all of you grow up. And now I’m sittin’ here, wonderin’ if I’m about to watch you throw yourself headfirst into something you can’t come back from.”

I looked down at the cracks in the concrete floor of the cell, thinking it over.

“You ever read Ezekiel 31, Sheriff?”

Wilkes' eyes flicked up, just for a second.

I took that as my answer.

""Talks about shepherds,"" I continued, my voice steady. ""The ones who do right, and the ones who don’t. How the Lord gets mighty pissed at the ones who fatten themselves on the flock, who trample the pasture, who leave the lambs scattered, hungry, lost.""

Wilkes exhaled through his nose, shaking his head slightly. ""You always did have a memory for scripture.""

I smiled faintly. ""Got it from you, Sheriff.""

Wilkes sat there, watching me, unmoving, unreadable.

""My father was a carpenter,"" I said. ""Built everything we ever had with his own two hands. Didn’t have much growing up, but I had him. And he wasn’t perfect. But he worked, and he prayed, and he tried—tried his damnedest—to be a good man. A better man than his father was.""

I took a deep breath, pausing for a minute.

""I keep thinking about that, lately. About what it means to be good. About what it means to stand in the light of the Lord and walk in the path of the righteous man.""

Wilkes’ fingers stilled against the cup, his jaw tightening slightly.

""See, I used to think it was simple. I used to think there were good men and there were bad men, and all you had to do was be good."" I let out a breath, shaking my head slightly. ""But it ain’t that simple, is it? Nah, the world don’t work that way.""

Wilkes didn’t say a word. I looked at him then, really looked at him—the lines in his face deeper than he remembered, his shoulders not quite as squared as they used to be. I thought of all the years Wilkes had spent keeping this town in order, all the weight he carried.

""It’s hard to be good,"" I said. ""Hard to stand in a place like this and tell yourself you’re still walking the righteous path. Cain thought he could walk it. Abel did too. But the first story of man is the story of one man killing another. The first time blood ever touched the earth.""

Wilkes’ expression didn’t change, but something in his posture shifted, just slightly.
I leaned forward, resting my forearms on my knees.

""Every man’s got a choice,"" I murmured. ""To be the shepherd, or to be the sinner. To raise his hand, or to keep it by his side.""

I swallowed hard.

“And I’m trying real hard to be the shepherd.”

Wilkes’s fingers tapped against his desk, slow, rhythmic, thoughtful. Then, finally, he spoke.

""I know you are,"" he said, voice steady. ""And that’s what worries me.""

Silence stretched between us, thick and heavy. Then Wilkes let out a long breath, stood, and walked over to the cell. He pulled out the key, turned it in the lock with a soft, metallic click.

He stood, slowly and deliberately, walked on over, and unlocked the cell door.
“Mac paid your bail.”

He didn’t look at me as I stepped past him, moving toward the open door, toward the first breath of morning air spilling into the station.

But as I reached the threshold, the light cutting across my face, I heard Wilkes sigh quietly, almost resignedly. 

“Just go home, Alan.”

ALAN RUSSELL

They found the bodies on Sunday.

I heard about it before I even saw the papers, before the whispers started rolling through town like a slow-moving sickness, twisting their way through the streets, through the diners, through the school hallways. News like that doesn’t spread. It seeps, like blood through fabric. By the time the sun had fully risen, everyone knew.

By noon, the story was already set in stone.

Kevin and Don, drunk or high or both, had wandered out to the train tracks in the dead of night, draped themselves in a tarp, and fallen into such a deep, careless sleep that they hadn’t woken up when a thousand-ton train came bearing down on them at sixty miles an hour.

By evening, their names were cautionary tales, spoken in hushed, disapproving tones.

By Monday morning, they were just another small-town tragedy, another set of parents left burying their sons, another gruesome accident that no one wanted to think too hard about.


The conductor had seen them first, lying just past the junction outside of town, a few miles down the old freight line where the rust crept up the rails and weeds poked through the gravel. The tarp covering them was blue, weathered by the elements, barely distinguishable from the ground in the dark.

At first, he thought it was debris, a bundle of junk left behind by drifters or careless hunters. But as he got closer, the shape became clearer, more deliberate—two forms beneath the fabric, motionless, long limbs sprawled awkwardly over the steel rails.

He hit the horn. They didn’t move.

He threw the brakes. The train didn’t stop.

It took nearly a mile for it to slow, for the screeching metal to finally drag to a halt, but by then, it was too late.

By then, the bodies had already been torn apart, scattered across the tracks in dark, wet ribbons, pieces flung into the grass, into the gravel, into the deep ditches lining the junction like open graves.

The crew searched the scene with grim, reluctant hands, collecting what was left of Kevin’s arms, Don’s ribs, fragments of skull and torn fabric, piecing them together like a grotesque puzzle. That’s when they noticed that the blood wasn’t red. It was thick and purple, clotted like syrup, far too viscous, soaking into the ground in sluggish, gelatinous pools.

Any doctor, any forensic pathologist, any damn coroner with half a brain could tell you what that meant.

By the time the steel wheels tore through the bodies, splitting flesh from bone, scattering viscera across the tracks, they had already been dead.

I wasn’t a doctor. Neither was Mac or Heather. None of us had the medical knowledge to stand in that morgue and tell them they were full of shit, to point at the viscous, purple blood pooling in the plastic bags and tell them that people don’t die like that.

The medical examiner—Dr. Yasin Halak, a man who had been working in Ashwood longer than I had been alive, longer than my mother had lived here—gave the official cause of death at noon.

The boys had gone hunting, as they often did, but this time, they had gotten reckless. They had gotten stoned off their asses on “the dreaded marijuana,” lost track of time, lost track of their minds, stumbled onto the train tracks, and, for some unfathomable reason, pulled a tarp over themselves and passed out cold, dead to the world.

So dead, apparently, that a roaring freight train had not been enough to stir them from their sleep.

So dead that they hadn’t moved when the engine bore down on them, hadn’t twitched when the horn blared, hadn’t so much as shifted when the wheels finally met flesh.

Halak stood at that podium, in front of the whole town, and said this with a straight face.

Like Don, who had spent half his life handling firearms, tracking animals, surviving in the woods, would’ve decided to just fall asleep on the goddamn train tracks after smoking a little weed.

Like Kevin, who had been the lightest lightweight I had ever known, who never got high when we went night spotting because he was too paranoid about making a mistake, would have just let it happen.

He said it like it was reasonable, like it made sense, like we were all supposed to just accept it and move on.

And the worst part?

Most people did.


Don’s mother stood stone-faced at the service, her grief too deep to bend into words, her bodies too hollowed out to hold onto anything but the weight of loss. Don’s brothers, Nathan, Oliver, and little Sam sat behind her, shaky-legged and confused. Oliver and Sam were young, too young to understand that Don wasn’t coming home, tugging Nathan’s sleeve, asking if they could go to the catering table—and Nathan was too young to look as old as he did, the lines of loss etching themselves deep into the twelve-year old’s youthful face. He looked more like Don every day.

Kevin’s father was hit the hardest. He stood for the entire service, eyes firmly locked on the coffin of the last member of his family, silent tears streaming down the practiced iron face of a United States Marine. It occurred to me that this was the first time I had ever seen him without a bottle in his hand, something he explained when he gave his eulogy.

“I-I could have been a better father. Coming back, I wasn’t ready, I turned to the bottle to… try to deal with it. Kevin-Kevin looked up to me like you wouldn’t believe, thought I was a hero, and I let him down. Everyday. Watching his little face fall was worse than anything I ever had to do over there. But I… didn’t change and I guess he tried to deal with it the only way he knew—the way I did. If… if that shit did that to my boy, I’m never touching a drop of it again, memories be damned.”

After he walked off the stage with the brisk steps of a broken soldier, they brought up a bunch of Kevin and Don’s old teachers and classmates. We sat in the church pews, listening to people who had never really known them talk about them like they had, feeling our teeth press into our tongues as we tried to hold back the things we really wanted to say.

That it wasn’t their fault.

That they hadn’t died like that.

The town had already cried for them, for the boys they thought they knew. For the cautionary tale they had turned them into.

Kevin and Don, the reckless, foolish kids who had thrown their lives away in a haze of smoke and bad decisions, who had been claimed by the same stupid vices that had claimed a hundred others before them.

They didn’t get to be the boys we knew. They didn’t get to be smart, or funny, or stupid in the way that made life fun instead of tragic.

They didn’t get to be people anymore.

They were just a story now, another cautionary tale, another lesson to scare the younger kids straight, a tragedy they could shake their heads at over coffee, muttering about how they had thrown their lives away over drugs and bad decisions.


We should have said something.

We should have stood up, right there in that church, and screamed the truth at the top of our lungs, that their bodies had been dumped there, left like garbage on the tracks to be found.

But we didn’t.

Mac’s hands hadn’t stopped shaking since the moment we’d walked in. Heather hadn’t looked up from her lap. I sat there, gripping Kevin’s old lighter so tightly it left an indent in my palm, staring at the polished caskets at the front of the room, knowing—no one was in them. Not really, not the way they had been. The pieces of them had been collected. Put back together as best they could be.

But the real Don, the real Kevin—they had been gone long before that train hit them. 

I sure as hell didn’t trust the police, not after what we had seen. I knew better than to walk into that station and ask questions, but I needed to know, now more than ever.

I had other leads, people who might have been willing to talk if they thought I was the only one listening.

Greg O’Neal had told me to wait for his call. I had been waiting ever since.

Now, with Kevin and Don buried beneath the dirt, I wasn’t waiting anymore.

That night, after the funeral, after the murmured condolences, after Mac had punched a hole in the wall of my garage and Heather had sobbed into my shoulder for hours, I grabbed my father’s gun and I went looking for answers.




HEATHER ROBINSON


Alan held me like he knew I might break.

Like if he let go, I would crumble to pieces, scatter at his feet like shattered glass, slip between the cracks in the floor and disappear completely. I pressed my face into his shoulder, breathing in the scent of wood smoke and old leather, my fingers clutching at the fabric of his jacket, digging in like I could hold myself together by holding onto him.

The grief didn’t come all at once.

It bled in slow, crawling waves, filling the spaces between my ribs, creeping up my throat, pooling behind my eyes. I didn’t cry at first—just stood there, trembling, silent, too hollowed out to process the depth of what I had lost.

And then it hit me, all at once, like a tidal wave crashing over a broken levy.

Kevin was gone.

Don was gone.

The weight of those words pressed down on me, crushed me, swallowed me whole.

I broke and Alan let me.

There were no more stupid inside jokes, no more late-night drives, no more drunken confessions whispered between cigarette drags, no more Don rolling his eyes and Kevin making some sarcastic quip to lighten the mood.

There was just this hole, this sickening, gaping wound that had opened inside my chest, something I could never fill again.

And it hurt.

God, it hurt.

I don’t know how long I cried, but Alan didn’t let go. He just stood there, holding me up, like he knew I couldn’t stand on my own anymore.



I left shortly after, still dizzy with grief, still raw, like my insides had been scraped out and left in the dirt beside their caskets.

The wind was cold as I walked, cutting through the thin fabric of my dress, stinging my skin. I kept my arms wrapped tightly around myself, head down, feet moving automatically over the familiar road that led toward home. The pavement stretched ahead of me in long, jagged cracks, veins splitting through the asphalt like the town itself was coming apart.

Then, a sound—the low, slow roll of tires creeping up beside me.

The glow of headlights crawled along the street, reaching for my shadow, stretching it long and thin against the ground.

I knew who it was before he spoke.

“Hey.”

Trevor’s voice was too casual, too normal, like he was greeting me in the school parking lot instead of pulling up beside me on the way home from my dead friends’ funeral.

I kept walking.

The truck slowed, keeping pace with me.

“What’s wrong?” he asked, genuinely confused, like he didn’t already know, like he hadn’t been somewhere else, anywhere else, instead of sitting next to me in that church pew.

My hands curled into fists.

A sharp, bitter laugh pushed its way up my throat, but I swallowed it down, clenched my jaw, forced myself to breathe. I turned my head just enough to see his face, to take in the way he tilted his head in mild confusion, unbothered, unaffected, like he had never known them, never known me.

Something inside me cracked.

And I realized, with startling, suffocating clarity—

I hated him.

I hated his detachment, his self-importance, the way he could so effortlessly pretend that nothing had changed. I hated the fact that he hadn’t been there, hadn’t thought to call, hadn’t thought to ask if I was okay until I was walking alone in the dark with grief bleeding out of me in short, sharp, arterial bursts.

I turned back.

Kept walking.

“Hey—Heather.” His voice tightened, just a little, that edge of frustration creeping in. “Come on, don’t be like that.”

His car sped up for a second, pulling ahead, then slowed again, the tires grinding against the pavement.

I didn’t look at him. Didn’t stop. Didn’t care how pissed he was. I just walked, straight to my house, straight inside and slammed the door shut behind me.

I didn’t turn on the lights.

Just peeled off my dress, kicked off my shoes, crawled under the covers, and stared at the ceiling. But something felt… off.

It was subtle at first, just a tickle at the back of my skull, something I couldn’t place.

The air in the room was too thick, too heavy, pressing down on my skin like a damp cloth. The silence was too deep, stretched tight like a wire, like it was just waiting to snap.

I turned onto my side.

Told myself I was imagining things. I was just tired, grieving, paranoid.

But I couldn’t shake the feeling that I wasn’t alone.




I woke up to the sound of breathing.

Not my own.

Not… human.

Something slow. Something measured. Something wet.

The air in my room was thick with it, damp and unnatural, each inhale slow, rattling, wet, like something sucking air through hollowed-out bone. The sound slithered over my skin, pressing into my ears, crawling down my throat like smoke, pooling in my lungs like a second presence, something inside me, something breathing with me.

I tried to move.

I couldn’t.

A weight pinned me down, crushing my chest into the mattress, pressing my arms into my sides, my muscles locked into place like I had been buried alive.

I could feel it.

Something was sitting on me, pinning me to the mattress, pressing my body down into the sheets with deliberate cruelty, allowing me just enough breath to stay awake, to keep struggling, to remain trapped in the moment where waking turned to nightmare and nightmare turned to something worse.

My skin crawled, the back of my neck prickling like when I was a child, when I used to lie awake at night, convinced something was waiting in the closet, beneath my bed, just out of sight.

I wasn’t wrong back then.

I wasn’t wrong now.

And if I looked, if I let my gaze slip toward the darkness pooling in the corners of my bedroom, toward the places where my childhood nightmares had always waited for me, if I dared to look too closely—

I would see the others, too.





The closet door was open.

I didn’t remember leaving it open.

It hadn’t been open when I went to bed.

But now, in the suffocating dark, it had cracked just enough to reveal the narrow stretch of empty floor, the space between my hanging clothes, the place where I used to imagine glowing eyes blinking back at me from the void.

Something moved inside.

It was not solid, not a figure, not a shape, but rather the absence of a shape, an unraveling of reality, thick and black as ink, shifting in the dim light, pulsing, the suggestion of a form flickering in and out of existence.

Then—

The tips of black, razor-sharp claws curled around the edge of the doorframe, sinking into the wood.

It was steadying itself.

It had been waiting for me to notice.

A horrible, slow shudder rippled through the dark, and then it leaned forward, just slightly, just enough to be sure I knew—

It was looking at me.

The air grew colder, pressing into my ears, my ribs, my throat. I could feel the sheets beneath me, feel the mattress at my back—

And then, I felt something shift below me, a gentle, almost playful movement.

A pressure pressing up into my spine. Something was beneath the bed.

I had been afraid of this, once—when I was four, five, six years old, lying awake at night, legs curled up so they wouldn’t dangle over the side, so nothing could grab me, yank me down, pull me under.

I wasn’t four years old anymore, but I had never been more convinced that if I set one foot on the floor, I would be dragged into something I wouldn’t return from.

The breathing was closer now, curling over the mattress from all directions, seeping from the floorboards, from the corners of the room, from the spaces where darkness stretched too deep, where it pooled in places it had no right to be.

The creaking started, slow and deliberate, my headboard shaking ever so slightly. 

I couldn’t see past the edge of my mattress, but I felt it moving, shifting its weight from one foot to the other, measured, careful, like it didn’t want to wake me up.

It was closer than the first one, too close.

The stench of smoke and rotting meat filled my nostrils, thick and cloying, sinking into my skin, curling against my tongue.

It moved again. It was not solid, not completely.

I could see it out of the corner of my eye, a shape unraveling, folding into itself, shifting like liquid shadow, like a cloud of black ink spilled across water, its outline flickering in and out of reality, its presence undeniable even when it disappeared completely.

It was watching me.

It was hovering over me.

I could feel it leaning in, face hovering inches from mine, breath curling hot and damp against my cheek.

The smell of blood was thick in the air.

Something in the closet shifted again, fingers tightening around the wood, the unseen weight on my chest growing heavier, heavier, heavier, the edges of my vision dimming.

And suddenly I was back in middle school.

Mr. Corbin had fallen in a twisted heap of broken limbs and fabric, like something that had been dropped rather than collapsed, his fingers still curled into the fabric of his slacks, his back arched unnaturally, as if the bullet had locked him into place.

I had stared at him, unable to reconcile the shape of his body with the shape of the man he had been, watching as the blood crawled between the tiles, as thick and slow and endless as the River Lethe.

I had squeezed my eyes shut then, trying to pretend it wasn’t real, trying to pretend I wasn’t seeing it, that if I stopped looking, it would stop existing.

It hadn’t worked then, it wouldn’t work now.

Because I could still see him, could still see the way his mouth had fallen open, lips twisted in a way that no longer belonged to him, his face empty, hollow, frozen in the moment when he realized he was about to die.

And something in the darkness—something woven from inky black smoke and elongated limbs—laughed.

The weight on my chest never lessened, but I could feel a new presence, a new shape pressing into the mattress at my back, something curling itself around my spine, winding through my ribs like ivy, seeping into the spaces where I had long since stopped believing anything holy remained.

Its fingers trailed lightly over the skin of my neck, feather-light, tender, almost affectionate.

And then—a sound above me, a slow, wet clicking.

I had always been afraid of this, the idea that something could perch on the headboard of my bed, looking down at me while I slept, curling its claws into the wood, waiting for me to wake up so I could see it.

I wouldn’t look.

I wouldn’t look.

I wouldn’t—

It was not solid, not fully formed, an unraveling thing, shifting between states, visible and not, present and not, real and not, a creature made of ink and shadow, pouring through my bed frame, coiling beneath my sheets, wrapping its tendrils around my wrists like bracelets made of bone.

Something sharp pressed into my wrists. A long, curved raven’s talon, curling against my pulse, tracing the delicate, vulnerable stretch of skin, where my veins rose close to the surface.

And then, with a slow, deliberate pressure, it sank into my wrists.

Pain erupted in twin streaks of fire, sharp and hot, sending a bolt of electricity up my arms, every nerve ending screaming at once. My vision blurred, my breath ripped from my lungs in a silent, shuddering gasp.

Something wet dripped down my arms. The thing above me pressed closer, whispering something I couldn’t understand, something too old and too heavy and too broken for human ears.

And then—I woke up.

Jerking violently, gasping for air, hands flying to my wrists, breath shattering in my throat as I ran my fingers over the skin that should have been smooth, should have been whole.

It wasn’t.

Two long, deep scratches ran the length of my wrists, carved into my flesh like a signature welling with blood.

The closet door was still open. The room was as still as a mausoleum.

And in the shadows where my nightmares had always lived—

Something breathed, waiting for me to sleep again.



ALAN RUSSELL

I found Greg O’Neal’s address the old-fashioned way—sifting through old phone books, talking to the right people, using my fake id to pay for a couple of drinks at Callahan’s, and finally, after piecing together information like a puzzle made of half-rotted scraps, I had an address.

It sat in a part of town that felt like it had been forgotten on purpose, a place where the paint peeled faster than people could afford to cover it up, where the sidewalks were cracked and buckling, where the streetlights burned too dim or not at all.

By the time I pulled up, the sun was just beginning to break the horizon, a pale slit of dull pink light barely strong enough to push through the lingering night.

I should have been the first one there, but I wasn’t.

Two Dodge Polaras sat parked in front of the house, their red and blue lights casting eerie pulses across the overgrown lawn, illuminating the strips of yellow crime scene tape that flapped lazily in the early morning breeze.

And the front door—the front door was wide open.

I killed the engine and slid out of my truck, pulling my jacket tighter around myself as I made my way up the cracked sidewalk, shoulders tense, jaw clenched, the Tokarev TT-33 resting like a quiet promise beneath the layers of fabric, the metal icy cold against my skin.

I really needed to buy a holster.

The air reeked of something sour, something rotten, a stench so thick it made the back of my throat tighten. I had smelled blood before, smelled bodies left too long in places they weren’t supposed to be, but this was something different. Something worse.

The stink curled into my nostrils, settled into my lungs, and as I stepped closer, I saw it. Just past the officers standing at the door, past the flickering glow of cheap overhead bulbs, just barely visible through the open doorway—a corpse, sitting upright.

Headless.

One of the officers swiveled around, turning towards me before I could get any closer.

“Crime scene’s closed.”

I pulled my hands from my jacket pockets, raising them in an easy, slow-moving gesture. “Didn’t know there was a crime scene, officer.”

His eyes narrowed. “Then why are you here?”

I let my expression stay neutral, ignoring the tight coil of unease winding its way up my spine.

“Friend of a friend told me Greg O’Neal lived here. Haven’t heard from him in a few days.”

The other officer—younger, thinner, the kind of guy who still looked nervous when he put on the badge in the morning—shifted uncomfortably before speaking.

“Yeah, well. You won’t be hearing from him now.”

I didn’t ask what’d happened, I didn’t have to. I had already seen enough.

But the first officer—the older one, built like a brick wall, with eyes that looked like they had seen a thousand things no man should ever see—decided I should hear it anyway.

“Neighbor called it in,” he said, voice gruff, tired, the tone of a man who had been awake too long and had seen too much. “Said the smell was leaking out onto the street. We get here, we knock, we get no answer. We step inside, and there he is. Melting into the goddamn couch.”

His lip curled slightly, and for a moment, I saw the raw, unfiltered disgust in his eyes, the thing he was trying to swallow down, bury, forget.

“The top half of him, anyway.”

I didn’t ask where the head was.

They didn’t know, or maybe they did, and they didn’t want to say it out loud. I had seen enough strange things to know that some wounds didn’t bleed the way they were supposed to, that some deaths weren’t meant to be neatly written down in a coroner’s report.

Something felt wrong about this, though. Not just the body, not just the missing head. The house itself was too quiet, not the kind of quiet that came from an empty building, but the kind of quiet that came from something waiting, something watching, something pressing against the walls just beneath the surface, curling its fingers into the floorboards, stretching through the drywall.

Something had happened here and whatever it was—it hadn’t left.

I was about to turn back when the dog came out.

The first thing I noticed was the blood.

It was matted into its fur, dried and crusted in dark, jagged streaks, caking the white of its paws, staining the gray of its snout. It snarled and thrashed, teeth bared, foam bubbling at the edges of its mouth, the leash wrapped tight around the wrist of one of the officers as he struggled to drag the animal toward the car.

“Son of a bitch hasn’t let anyone near him since we got here,” the younger officer muttered, keeping his distance.

“Wouldn’t either, if I’d been locked in here for days with a corpse.”

I watched as they forced the dog into the backseat of one of the Dodge Polaras, the metal door slamming shut behind it.

It kept snarling, snapping, eyes wild, like it wasn’t sure if it wanted to attack or run or rip the whole goddamn world apart.

Something about it didn’t sit right.

Dogs mourned, dogs starved, dogs howled and whimpered and shrank beneath the weight of grief and loneliness.

But this?

This dog was angry.

And for some reason, that scared me more than the body.

I had come looking for answers.

Instead, I had found a corpse with no head, a house that smelled like death, and a dog that had seen something no living being could understand.

I had nothing.

No leads. No direction. No next move.

I shoved my hands into my jacket pockets, turning back toward my truck, keeping my eyes on the cracked pavement as I walked, forcing myself not to look back at the house, not to let my mind pick apart the way the door still stood open, how the shadows inside seemed darker than they should have been, deeper than they should have been.

I climbed into the driver’s seat and turned the key. The engine rumbled to life beneath my hands. I sat there for a moment, gripping the wheel, staring at my own reflection in the windshield, watching the red and blue lights flicker over my skin.

I needed a holster, I needed a plan, and most of all—

I needed to know what the hell had happened to Greg O’Neal.


The night was thick with humidity, the air clinging to my skin like a second layer. Greg O’Neal’s house stood ahead, dark and hollow, abandoned in the wake of his murder. The yellow police tape still fluttered against the porch railing, curling at the edges, but no one was watching this place anymore.

I stepped over the tape, my boots hitting the wooden steps with a soft creak. The door was still open—just enough for me to slip inside. The stench hit me immediately, thick and rotten, the kind of smell that burrows into your sinuses and lingers. Death. Even after they’d taken the body, scrubbed the floors, it still sat heavy in the air.

I pulled the collar of my jacket up, breathing through my mouth as I moved through the small living room. The furniture was cheap and well-worn, a sagging couch pushed against the wall, a stained recliner in the corner. A coffee table sat between them, littered with old magazines, cigarette butts, and a ring of dried blood where something—someone—had sat.

I crouched down, examining the dried stain. Greg had been dead for days before they found him, his dog half-starved by the door. There were things here that didn’t add up, and I wasn’t leaving without answers.

I moved toward the back of the house, careful not to disturb anything. The bedroom door was slightly ajar, the hinges groaning as I pushed it open. The bed was unmade, sheets still tangled, like someone had been in a hurry. A dresser stood against the far wall, drawers hanging open, empty. Someone had been here before me.

I stepped closer, my eyes catching on something wedged between the dresser and the wall. A scrap of paper, folded and creased. I crouched, pulling it free, unfolding it with careful fingers. The ink was smudged, but I could still make out the words.

PETERSON COMP STA #12—01:30

A date was scrawled beneath it, a week before Greg was found dead. I stared at it for a long moment, my pulse thrumming in my ears. He had known something. He’d gone out there for a reason, and whatever he’d found had cost him his life.

My pulse jumped as I heard a noise, soft, barely there, but enough to send a prickle down my spine. I turned sharply, scanning the darkened doorway. The house settled around me, the wind whispering through the open front door. There was nothing, only my nerves. I exhaled slowly, tucking the paper into my pocket before moving back toward the living room. I needed to check the kitchen, see if Greg had left anything behind—notes, receipts, anything.

I barely made it two steps before something slammed into the side of my jaw.

Pain exploded through my skull, bright and searing. My vision blurred, my knees buckling as I staggered, catching myself against the wall. Another hit—this one harder. My head snapped to the side, stars bursting behind my eyes, my body giving out beneath me.

The floor rushed up to meet me.

Then there was nothing.


I woke up in a jail cell that smelled like sweat, old paper, and the sharp, metallic tang of dried blood—the kind you don’t notice at first, but lingers beneath the surface, clinging to the air, waiting to be acknowledged. I sat up on the edge of my cot, elbows resting on my knees, watching the bars in front of me with the kind of measured patience that only came when you knew no one was coming to help you.

The silence pressed against me, thick and unmoving, broken only by the steady ticking of the clock on the wall, its hands moving with the slow, mechanical certainty of something that had seen more men wait out long nights than I could ever count. I rubbed my jaw, feeling the faint bruise forming there, and exhaled through my nose.

Then came the footsteps, boots against linoleum, the shift of a belt, the soft jingle of keys tapping against metal. I just listened as they came closer, as they stopped just beyond the bars, as a familiar weight settled into the air like a hand pressing firm against the back of my neck.

I finally lifted my gaze. Wilkes was standing there, one hand on his belt, the other holding a paper cup, steam curling from its rim. The old man took a slow sip of coffee, then let out a long sigh, shaking his head. ""Hell of a mess you got yourself in.""
For a second, just a second, it felt like being twelve again.

Like I was sitting cross-legged on the floor of his office, listening to him spin stories about Samson and his jawbone, about David and his sling, about all the times when God didn’t spare the sinners, when the ground cracked open and swallowed them whole, when fire rained from the sky and turned entire cities to dust.

The stories they never told in church, but that he was always eager to share, delighting in the details.

“You’re real lucky, though,” Wilkes said, taking a slow sip of coffee. “If it were anybody else, they might’ve decided to charge you with something a little more serious than a night in jail.”

I snorted, rolling my shoulders. “On what, trespassing?”

Wilkes hummed, shifting his head slightly. “Could’ve been breaking and entering. Maybe even attempted burglary, if they were feelin’ mean about it.”

I tilted my head slightly, glancing at the bars between us. ""You know I had to try and find out what happened.""

Something flickered in Wilkes’ face, but it was gone before I could name it. The sheriff sighed, a deep, weary sound, and leaned back in his chair, rubbing a hand over his face like a man who had spent too many nights awake, watching over something he couldn’t protect.

“You’re reckless, son,” Wilkes said finally, his voice lower now, not scolding, but something else. Something softer. “You run around this town kicking up dust, looking under rocks that oughta stay put, and one day, you’re gonna find something you wish you hadn’t.”

I raised one weary eyebrow. “You worried about me, Sheriff?”

Wilkes exhaled sharply, shaking his head. “Course I am.” He looked down at the desk, tapping one finger against the wood. “Watched you grow up. Watched all of you grow up. And now I’m sittin’ here, wonderin’ if I’m about to watch you throw yourself headfirst into something you can’t come back from.”

I looked down at the cracks in the concrete floor of the cell, thinking it over.

“You ever read Ezekiel 31, Sheriff?”

Wilkes' eyes flicked up, just for a second.

I took that as my answer.

""Talks about shepherds,"" I continued, my voice steady. ""The ones who do right, and the ones who don’t. How the Lord gets mighty pissed at the ones who fatten themselves on the flock, who trample the pasture, who leave the lambs scattered, hungry, lost.""

Wilkes exhaled through his nose, shaking his head slightly. ""You always did have a memory for scripture.""

I smiled faintly. ""Got it from you, Sheriff.""

Wilkes sat there, watching me, unmoving, unreadable.

""My father was a carpenter,"" I said. ""Built everything we ever had with his own two hands. Didn’t have much growing up, but I had him. And he wasn’t perfect. But he worked, and he prayed, and he tried—tried his damnedest—to be a good man. A better man than his father was.""

I took a deep breath, pausing for a minute.

""I keep thinking about that, lately. About what it means to be good. About what it means to stand in the light of the Lord and walk in the path of the righteous man.""

Wilkes’ fingers stilled against the cup, his jaw tightening slightly.

""See, I used to think it was simple. I used to think there were good men and there were bad men, and all you had to do was be good."" I let out a breath, shaking my head slightly. ""But it ain’t that simple, is it? Nah, the world don’t work that way.""

Wilkes didn’t say a word. I looked at him then, really looked at him—the lines in his face deeper than he remembered, his shoulders not quite as squared as they used to be. I thought of all the years Wilkes had spent keeping this town in order, all the weight he carried.

""It’s hard to be good,"" I said. ""Hard to stand in a place like this and tell yourself you’re still walking the righteous path. Cain thought he could walk it. Abel did too. But the first story of man is the story of one man killing another. The first time blood ever touched the earth.""

Wilkes’ expression didn’t change, but something in his posture shifted, just slightly.
I leaned forward, resting my forearms on my knees.

""Every man’s got a choice,"" I murmured. ""To be the shepherd, or to be the sinner. To raise his hand, or to keep it by his side.""

I swallowed hard.

“And I’m trying real hard to be the shepherd.”

Wilkes’s fingers tapped against his desk, slow, rhythmic, thoughtful. Then, finally, he spoke.

""I know you are,"" he said, voice steady. ""And that’s what worries me.""

Silence stretched between us, thick and heavy. Then Wilkes let out a long breath, stood, and walked over to the cell. He pulled out the key, turned it in the lock with a soft, metallic click.

He stood, slowly and deliberately, walked on over, and unlocked the cell door.
“Mac paid your bail.”

He didn’t look at me as I stepped past him, moving toward the open door, toward the first breath of morning air spilling into the station.

But as I reached the threshold, the light cutting across my face, I heard Wilkes sigh quietly, almost resignedly. 

“Just go home, Alan.”

What’s one of the worst ways you found out you got fired?



I’ve had a few, and none of them were fun. The first time, I started my day like normal, coffee in hand, ready to log in and suddenly, I couldn’t. Thought it was a tech issue at first, maybe a password reset or something. Nope. Locked out completely. No email, no warning, just that sinking feeling in my stomach as reality set in. PTSD unlocked.

Another time, I just straight up got ghosted. No emails, no calls, nothing. 

But the worst? The time I found out I was about to be fired before they even told me**.** Just scrolling online when I saw a job posting that looked way too familiar. Read through it and, yep...my exact role, same responsibilities, same company. They hadn’t even let me go yet, and they were already hiring my replacement. 



That one stung for a long time

I could really use an outside opinion on a situation I find myself in. Maybe its easily solved, which would be great.

I am taking on the task of finding a single POS solution that fits all of our needs, if such a thing exists.  Now, we have three remote locations that each run their own individual systems, one is still running Quickbooks POS, which has been EOL for months now, another runs an NCR solution, but the support has been poor and our users are frustrated with it, and a third implementation Im not even yet familiar with, I just know it exists.  Each of these locations operate as a separate business, but for consistency sake we want to get them onto a common platform.  Site A is a cafeteria with a POS station and a coffee shop that has a POS station,  site B is a cafeteria and an integrated restaurant with POS stations in each, and site C is a cafeteria as well with a single POS station.

Any advice is appreciated.  If you cannot tell, I am really the last person that should be figuring this out, I'm just an IT guy that it got dumped on you know the routine.  The people at each site are both frustrated with their current solutions, but are almost emotional about changing over to something new because of the perceived amount of work involved.  I would love to save the day on this one.

If it needs to be said, these stations process both meal card, and credit card transactions.

Have you ever noticed how the most significant changes in our lives rarely come with a warning? They disguise themselves as ordinary days, unremarkable decisions, or chance encounters that we nearly miss.
Three years ago, I was rushing through a crowded train station, frustrated about being late for a meeting. I bumped into someone, spilling their coffee. In my hurry to apologize and leave, I almost missed the genuine conversation that followed. That stranger became my business partner six months later, and together we've built something I never imagined possible.
It makes me wonder how many life-changing moments I've walked past without noticing. How many decisions I've made on autopilot that altered my trajectory in ways I'll never fully understand.
We spend so much time planning our lives—education, career paths, relationships, retirement—as if following the right sequence will guarantee fulfillment. But when I reflect on what truly shaped me, it's rarely what I meticulously planned. It's the book someone randomly recommended, the job I took as a temporary solution, the conversation with a stranger that shifted my perspective.
Maybe the art of living well isn't about controlling every variable but developing the awareness to recognize significance in seemingly ordinary moments. To pause long enough to consider that this interaction, this decision, this random Tuesday afternoon might contain something essential.
I'm curious—what unexpected moments have shaped your life? What seemingly small decisions led to your biggest changes? And how do you stay open to recognizing these moments as they happen?",1,1740703259.0,Life,1,1.0,False

5 months ago i made a post talking abt how i felt my parosmia healing bcs i was able to smell neutral smells again. 

fast forward almost march 2025 and here is my honest update:

the worst part of parosmia is over. i can smell perfumes better. delicate smells like let’s say, nutella, don’t really have a smell yet but i’m being patient. i still can’t really smell the scent of a room (like a restaurant) but it’s not that crazy. 

and for the things that used to smell like straight rot (meats, coffee, mint, cigarettes, fried foods, eggs, poop, and some other things) don’t smell horrible anymore. they all used to smell like rot, and all smelled the same. now coffee mostly tastes like coffee, eggs mostly taste like eggs. meats, cigarettes, and poop all smell insanely similar, but they don’t smell horrible; so that’s a plus. mint tastes alr? idk, it doesn’t rly taste bad but it doesn’t rly taste like mint either

to anyone going thru parosmia, it really DOES get better. only thing you can do is be strong and wait this bs out. 


(lil bonus of my parosmia experience)
i remember in my worst times in parosmia, i used to have this disgusting feeling all of the time. all good either tasted bland or like shit. i couldn’t smell anything unless it was cigarettes, fried foods, eggs, coffee, or meat (which were the most rancid smelling things on the planet). 
i had this weird disgusting feeling where everytime i breathed in, i smelled nothing at all. but when i breathed out, i could sort of smell my own breathe. and it smelled like rot. not because of anything i ate, but because i would be breathing out all of the foods i had eaten all day, and no matter what i ate, everytime i breathed out it smelled rancid and that i was rotting on the inside. “just brush your teeth”. but even mint tasted like rot. my own body literally felt like a prison where i couldn’t even breathe without having the urge to gag. now, i don’t have that. this only lasted 3 months but i remember it being hell. if you’re experiencing this right now, thoughts and prayers fr 🙏

Hello,  I don't know if everyone remembers the craft fair Bridezilla.  She lost a friend due to the friend being signed up to be a vender in a craft fair the same day as her wedding and might have been late.  When she had signed up months prior she didn't realized it was the same day. These craft fairs don't let you leave early, they can bar you from attending again. The bride and the friend have been to these craft fairs together and have worked on making things together.  Rather than have her friend be potentially late she told her ""late is not a option"" and not to bother to come, and then tried to guilt her with ""I glad to see a craft fair is more important being there for me.""

Well, I had the experience of being in this wedding.  A mess from the beginning.  Let me just say, being in a wedding party is not my cup of tea, I will help set up, tear down, run errands, but the whole bridesmaid thing is not my idea of fun.  Not that I don't like to dress up, but the picking out dress, shoes, makeup and other things with a group of people that have to agree on everything is not my idea of a good time, plus you are at the bride's mercy and being bossed around by the bridal hierarchy.   Yeah, screw that.

Context:  the bride and I went to nursing school together years ago, so trauma bonded for sure, I am 20 years older than her, but we have maintained a friendship ever since.  We travel abroad and she briefly mentioned getting married and I asked her please don't ask me to be a bridesmaid, that's not my thing.  Months later after the engagement took place she sent me a box with a gift and ""please be my bridesmaid"" card inside.  I agonized over this decision for days, talked to my husband about it, and ultimately agreed, know I was going to regret it.   AND BOY THAT WAS AN UNDERSTATEMENT!

The first step was lunch meeting everyone and after lunch picking out dresses.  MOH was her cousin, her soon to be sister in law, myself and a co-worker from her job were the 3 bridesmaids, her cousins daughter was flower girl and her cousin's older daughter was grooms woman. That event, unbelievably was fairly painless, other than I needed to get up early for me.  I work evening/nightshift.  About a month later her soon to be sister in law fell and broke her ankle.  We are 10 months out, October wedding,  plenty of time to heal, feel bad for her, but overall not a huge deal.  Not long after the soon to be sister in law died from a pulmonary embolus (blood clot in lung), which unfortunately can be a complication of the fractured ankle and not moving around a lot.  The funeral was just before Christmas.  Very sad, left behind a small child.

I went home to visit my friends from childhood out of state for a few days over the holiday and found out that my best friend's daughter has set a wedding date.  So exciting!  Now this is my best friend forever!  I'm talking been friends since high school, so going on 35+ years.  So I ask when is the wedding?  You guessed it! The very same day as the bridezilla's wedding.  Not to sound callus, ( I'm an ER nurse, we deal with emergencies and death all the time, don't come for me) but now I can't even back out, because I'll just be an asshole since the soon to be sister in law is dead.  I'm stuck (head hung in defeat, I knew I would regret it).

I was trying to get to the seamstress, but her hours were always early in the morning, smh (nightshift), the bride was really getting on me to get over to her, went there to get fitted and she wouldn't finish because I didn't have my shoes with me.  I hadn't even bought them yet. lol

Try on dress at alterations I don't remember picking out such a low cut dress, hmmm.  Seamstress ""um you have the dress on backwards"". LOL. oh well told you this wasn't my thing.  

Dry Wedding!  UGGGGGGG!  who the hell does that?

The groom bought a literal ball and chain as a wedding present for the bride with their wedding date engraved on it.

There was a photo of the sister in law on the wedding party table, very nice tribute, but then the parents of the groom got up and want the minister to read a letter to the groom that she had written him in high school telling him how proud of him she was.  Why was this necessary?  Yes, let's make everyone cry. 

Did I mention it was a DRY WEDDING!

Missed my best friend's daughters wedding, this still makes me so angry.

And she got mad at me for not taking her special needs cat, because it didn't like her husband.

I love listening to Charlotte Dobre on youtube and even got my daughter in law hooked.  She got a ""move in the shadows"" sweatshirt for Christmas.   I ended up listening to the episode with the craft fair bridezilla and immediately recognized the text thread, because the bride sent it me before the wedding, wanting my opinion.  I told her she was being harsh and shouldn't worry about her being late, because she doesn't even know if she is going to be late, and now she is loosing a friend.  I told her no one cares about her wedding like she does and she needs to keep that in mind.  I had to text her the link to the episode and asked her when she had posted this on the internet.  LMAO!  That's what you get.  Man they put her on blast!  Apparently she had posted to a bridal site and they were NOT SUPPORTIVE.  

Now onto ""at it again.""  So every few months we try to get together, catch up, you know stay connected.  We had agreed to meet for lunch.  She had a baby, about a year old by that time, and had mentioned she need to go shopping.  I woke up late and immediately text her that I had overslept.  I was coming off four 12 hour shifts.  As I was getting myself together I quickly found out that my oldest son, daughter in law and 2 grandchildren had just arrived and 2 of my other sons and friends were also pulling up.  I have 5 sons, 2 of them are married, and 2 grandchildren.  I quickly texted her back and asked if we could reschedule because I suddenly had a house full of people and my son, his wife and grandchildren live 4 hours away.

She texted back ""pretty shitty I got my kid up and dressed and myself and drove here but cool"" with the thumbs up emoji.  First of all you have one kid!  ONE KID!  How hard is it to dress one kid and yourself, you said you needed to go shopping anyway.  Secondly my house if full of people and I would much rather spend my time with my family than you!  My family is hilarious and amazing. Thirdly don't bother rescheduling then!

She texted back ""Interesting you just think I'm supposed to magically be ok with the fact that I woke up got ready and drove down here for you to tell me 10 mins before you're supposed to meet me that you're not coming, Thats true friendship""

That's it, I had had enough!  Snapped, even my family knows don't mess with me until I have had coffee. I don't need her sarcastic bullshit.  I told her that I never wanted to be in her wedding, but agreed to because it meant a lot to her and stayed in the wedding even when I found out that my best friend's daughter's wedding was same day. That's friendship.  I didn't care if she wants to play the victim (one of her favorite pass times). Then she blocked me.  LOL!  She blocked me on social media, but purposely didn't block my husband and wrote this whole nasty manifest on Facebook about what an awful friend I was.   

Oh well bridezilla!  BYE Felicia.

***Tuesday***

“So, what do you do for a dolla’, Angus?” Dustin asked, the moment he lowered himself into the seat at the head of a table so large it should have been in the meal hall at the Prydelands. Every spot around the massive piece of furniture at the back of the house held a regular chair that matched the one beside it, but they numbered over fifty, and there was a second table, half as long, beside it. The number of booster seats and cushions around the second table told Angus it was for the children. They had gathered at one end of the adult table closest to the kitchen.

Ten minutes earlier, Dustin had taken his boots off at the door and then broken away from everyone, climbing up the polished timber stairs with a gait of a man half his age. He’d only just returned to the kitchen, freshly showered and in clean clothes.

Angus drew his attention away from the furniture and looked across at him with a wry smirk. “I thought you were going back out to work after a bite,” he countered, leaning forward in his seat directly beside Mason’s grandfather.

The human huffed out a humoured breath and shook his head. “Nah. My days a’ puttin’ in eighteen-hour stretches in the saddle are long b’hind me. Truth is, I prob’ly should go back t’ retirin’, but doin’ nothin’ ain’t my style. I think the last time I tried it, I aged fifty years.”

“Then why did you give your son so much grief outside?” Skylar asked, and the old man’s grin grew to include teeth.

“If that boy still has a probl’m standin’ up t’ me at my age, he ain’t ready to run the farm on his own.”

“Enough of that,” a thin woman with short white hair who also looked to be in her late eighties said, carrying a small tray of dessert slices with chocolate topping. June came in behind her, carrying a tray with the cake, plates and cutlery on it.

“Here, let us take that,” Angus said, as he and Skylar immediately stood up. Skylar took the plate of slices while Angus went for the larger tray. Both women thanked them, and while the older woman followed them to the table and sat beside her husband, June headed back into the kitchen.

“Be right back,” Angus said, motioning for Skylar to stay at the table. He retraced his steps to the kitchen, shifting his senses to stay on top of what was happening at the table in his absence. As such, he heard Dustin say, “Good manne’s  that one.”

Angus took the large platter with several small pots of tea. He positioned it on one hand, deliberately giving his fingertips a fluid gelatinous texture that acted as a self-centring gyroscope for the tray. He pulled another filled with teacups to the edge of the bench and repeated the balancing process.

“My goodness, were you a waiter in your youth?”

“I’ve been many things over the years,” he said evasively, knowing his action left her with a glass tumbler full of teaspoons that hadn’t fitted on the other tray. “After you, ma’am.”

“June, please.”

“Of course.”

“I’m Skylar,” his mate said as they approached the doorway, reaching across the table to offer her hand to the elderly woman sitting opposite her.

“Bernice,” the older woman replied, taking her hand. Then she tutted and stood up, waving her hands for Skylar to come to her. “Oh, for goodness sake. Come here, dear.” For an elderly woman, there was nothing frail about the hug she bestowed on Skylar. Not if the surprised grunt from his mate was anything to go by.

“There must be something in the air up here,” Skylar chuckled when Bernice finally released her.

“Can’t deny that,” Dustin grinned, as June deposited the teaspoons alongside the teacups and mugs. Angus followed her, perfectly willing to manipulate his hand mass to push the trays onto the table but willing to accept June’s help when she pulled them from his hands one at a time without asking. “’n don’t think I didn’t notice y’ slick dodge earlier, young man,” the property patriarch grumped, picking up his conversation as if there’d been no break. “Y’ don’t come across as a slack’r, so what is it y’ do?”

“I’m a military man,” Angus answered obliquely, sliding into his seat beside Skylar.

Dustin’s expression shifted, his eyes taking in the measure of Angus before bobbing his head ever so slightly. “Brass ’r grunt?”

“Commander.” Since there were only five commanders under the Eechen and the rest of the pryde were all grunts, Angus didn’t want to go into the whole ‘brass-pips-equating-to-rank’ thing.

“Eh,” Dustin jeered as if it wasn’t necessarily the worst thing he’d ever heard, though the slight hitch of his lips belied the sneer. “How long b’fore y’ go back, son?”

“Pa!” June reprimanded, her brow slashing downwards in a frown.

“What? It’s a hard life f’r a woman t’ be alone f’r months at a time while her man’s away. You wouldn’t know nothin’ about that, since us menfolk come home most nights t’ warm y’ beds.”

“You don’t need to worry about me, Dustin,” Skylar cut in, before an argument could break out between them. “My whole family’s military, and my brothers and sisters all serve under Angus. I know what I’m getting myself into.”

“Is that how the two a’ you met?”

“Dustin, for the love of all that’s holy, will you stop?” Bernice asked in exasperation.

*Interesting word choice,* Angus chuckled to himself, glancing at Skylar who was also pinching her lips together. He wondered what their reaction would be if they learned they were in fact, dining with divine beings.

“The truth is, I was on the front lines for a long time,” Angus began, choosing his words carefully. “And I was burning out fast. I didn’t see it, but I was ordered back to the US and forced to take an extended R&R. Like you, I don’t sit still easily, so I took a temporary job as head of security for one of Mason’s roommates. Despite her siblings serving under me, it was through Mason that Skylar and I met.” Smirking to himself, he added, “I’m not sure if they even know we’re together yet.”

“And that’s why y’ ask questions,” Dustin crowed, waving a hand at Angus.

“Questions are fine, dear, so long as it’s not an interrogation.”

“Bah.”

“Wait…” June said, her brow furrowing in concern. “If you two only met after Mason went to work at the clinic a couple of weeks ago…”

“When y’ live in a state of war ’n what y’ see right in front ’a ya feels right, y’ snap it up quick-smart,” Dustin answered for him. He then looked across at Bernice with a warm smile. “Bernie n’ me were married two months afta’ I got m’self back from the war.”

Bernice placed her hand over his and squeezed, revealing her well-worn wedding band. “If I were t’ have jus’ one piece of advice f’r y’all, it’s neva’ go t’ bed angry. Argue if y’ must. Carry on like th’ devil’s geese if y’ have to. Whatever it takes t’ sort things out, but always end the day on the same page y’ were on when y’ woke up that morning.”

Dustin nodded in silent agreement.

“I can work with that,” Angus grinned, glancing sideways at Skylar, who was also fighting a smile.

For the next hour, the group fell into happy chatting, with the women *happy* to take the lead and both men *happy* to sit back and let them. Occasionally, Angus caught Dustin briefly crossing his eyes at him, and Angus arched an eyebrow in silent agreement. Another time, Dustin rolled his eyes to the ceiling, and Angus replied with a quick eyebrow waggle.

Both then shifted in their seats to hide their growing smirks. It didn’t matter the species. Women could talk the hind legs off a herd of *Nucklavi* once they got going.

“At least we have our conversations in front of you,” Skylar scolded, though her chuckle told him their antics hadn’t truly annoyed her. “Would you two like cheat sheets for proper sign language, or are you good with your Neanderthalic gestures?”

“Why don’t y’ take Angus out on the front porch for a drink, pa? Y’r both ready to slide clear und’r the table in boredom.”

June wasn’t technically wrong. Still, Angus waited for Dustin to push his chair back and climb to his feet before joining him. “We c’n tell when we ain’t wan’ed,” he smirked, giving Angus a chin-lift towards the front of the house. He then reached down and kissed Bernice’s cheek on his way through, another humanised act that Angus quicky replicated. “C’mon. I’ll grab ’s a coupla beers ‘’n we c’n share war stories,” the older man said.

“A lot of what I do is highly classified,” Angus warned, following him out.

“Cull’a me shocked.” He stopped in the foyer and ducked through a doorway on the left, returning a few seconds later with two beers in each hand. “You drink?”

Angus held out his hand as if that was the dumbest question he’d ever been asked and was given the two beers in Dustin’s left hand for his trouble. Dustin then led them outside to an area with a dozen matching chairs around a large outdoor coffee table. From the grooves carved into the deck, the chairs were the latest in a long line of seating for the space.

Dustin proved him correct, dropping his weight into one chair and automatically leaning it back until the front legs left the porch and his shoulders thumped lightly against the wall behind him. “P’ll uppa pew,” he said, gesturing to any of the chairs around him. 

Although the words themselves confused Angus, he took a seat adjacent to the Williams’ patriarch, mirroring the man’s swing except he put his feet up on the balcony railing. The silence dragged on between them, each taking small sips of their beers and staring out at the setting sun before Dustin broke first. “Got y’self a good woman there, son.”

*Son?* “I could say the same about you,” Angus returned.

He grunted and jerked his chin to the SUV parked a short distance away.

“What’s with that fancy POS y’all roll’d up in? Gave’s all the wrong impress’n a’ you.”

Angus looked over the car he’d borrowed for this ‘trip’. “Fancy POS,” Angus repeated, bobbing his head slowly in amusement. “That’s definitely one way to describe the people that loaned it to me.”

“Ahhh,” Dustin purred. “Ain’t yours. That makes more sense.”

“I’m rarely home long enough to have a car of my own. Family friends give me free access to theirs whenever I need one.” It was close enough to the truth since the Mystallians owned most of the vehicles in the garages.

“Y’r friends ’ve got a lotta money.”

“Mason would have told you about Sam’s father.”

“Yeah, I heard. Big bucks billionaire. Swept in ’n took care ’a everythin’. Let me tell y’ somethin’.” He angled the mouth of his beer at Angus. “Money don’t mean shit if y’ don’t put y’ family first.”

Angus thought about Llyr living on the streets for years just to be close to his son. “Sam’s father can never be accused of putting money ahead of his family.”

“Th’n why was that boy so hard up?”

“Not my story to tell.”

Dustin smirked. “I like you,” he said, almost as if that was a surprise to him.

“You’re not so bad yourself,” Angus replied, sipping his beer. *For a human.*

So I was getting ready to leave for work this morning with my boyfriend. We were talking in the living room while I was finishing packing/putting on shoes etc. At some point, my boyfriend points out that there’s liquid coming out of my bag. I drop it to the ground and to find that my coffee opened in my bag and that both my work laptop & ipad (and all other belongings) were soaked. I panicked, started emptying the bag trying to dry everything and my boyfriend just stayed there, splayed out on the couch not lifting a finger or saying anything.

I started to get mad, asking him why hadn’t he moved or asked if he could do anything, and his response was “Who puts their coffee mug in their bag”. I then get really mad, it escalated into a fight and we go our separate ways.

Tonight we wanted to address the situation as we had both cooled down. I asked him if he thought not helping or lifting a finger just staying stoic while I was going through something was OK and he said yes. That for him I should’ve asked for help, that it happened too fast for him (although he was the one who realized first that the bag was dripping) and that he always helps me. That the choice of not helping a partner or confirming if they need help is OK. Of course this turned into another fight.I did end up still apologizing for my outburst in the morning, because two wrongs do not make a right. However I made it clear that staying stoic and showing no compassion/help when a partner is going through something is not something acceptable. He ended up going to a hotel as he felt being separated for a night would be good. 

I think that saying that not helping/reacting in those instances is not OK, but maybe I’m wrong?

Also:
- he knew that the electronics were in the bag he saw me packing them 5 min prior to the events
- we were both ready and slowly making our way out (so no, not half sleepy without any food in the body)

1izv3v7,https://www.reddit.com/r/laptops/comments/1izv3v7/hp_elitebook_ultra_g1i_full_review/,HP Elitebook Ultra G1i Full Review,"Hey r/laptops,

First full review here. I'm a recent convert (or attempted convert) from the world of macOS. For context, I've been daily driving a 2018 15"" Intel MacBook Pro for the past six years and reasons I won’t bore you with, I decided it was time to jump back into the Windows world.

My initial plan was to wait for reviews of a few more Intel Lunar Lake laptops before making a move. But, as fate would have it, my trusty MacBook met an untimely demise (coffee, laptops, and kids don't mix), so I was forced to upgrade immediately. 

**My needs**:

Coming from a MacBook, battery life was super important. I wasn't expecting miracles, but I needed something that could realistically get me through a transatlantic flight or a full day of cafe work on a single charge. My workload is heavily productivity-focused: emails, Google Docs, PDFs, Office suite (Word, PowerPoint), Slack, Teams, web browsing, and the usual social media (primarily Facebook/Messenger). I also do light Python coding in VS Code occasionally.

My first attempt was the Asus Zenbook S14. On paper, it looked promising, but two things killed it for me. First, the non-haptic trackpad was a bigger hurdle than I anticipated. After years with one, it felt like a significant downgrade in daily usability to go to a precision trackpad. Second, and more critically, it flat-out refused to work with my external USB-C display (Dell U3219Q). This was a dealbreaker for me, so it went back to BestBuy. 

After the Zenbook, I was now specifically looking for a 14"" laptop with a haptic trackpad, Intel Lunar Lake (mainly for optimized battery life and compatibility), and premium build quality. Price wasn’t really an object. I just wanted the right machine.

Dell  XPS was out due to the function row layout (no physical keys. The one thing I hated about my Macbook Pro). I briefly considered Surface Laptops, even without Lunar Lake, but the lack of USB-C charging ports on both sides felt like a bizarre step back after years of convenience. It's a small thing, but these little annoyances add up.

I ended up zeroing in on the new HP EliteBook lineup. Specifically, the EliteBook Ultra G1i and the EliteBook X G1i. Initially, the X G1i was more appealing due to the built-in HDMI port (less dongle life) and the lack of an expandable USB-A port like the Ultra (less potential for mechanical failure down the line). However, the X G1i had three dealbreakers: no haptic trackpad (again!), no OLED display (the LCD isn't bezel-less), and the baffling placement of the Page Up/Page Down keys above the side arrow keys – a recipe for accidental key presses.

So, I bit the bullet and went for the HP EliteBook Ultra G1i. I opted for the configuration with 32GB of RAM and a 512GB SSD, with a plan to upgrade the storage later (it uses a standard 2280 NVMe drive).

**HP EliteBook Ultra G1i – The Review:**

**Build Quality:**

Generally excellent. Very close to my Macbook. The chassis feels solid and premium. My only real gripe here is display wobble!! The hinge itself is tight and holds the screen at any angle, but the display panel itself is surprisingly wobbly. Even when stationary, it seems overly sensitive to vibrations and movement. It’s not the end of the world, but it’s definitely noticeable and less refined than I expected. See video below where I have it next to my work laptop which is a 14"" Macbook pro. I tap the table a bit with my leg and the wobble is pretty noticeable.

https://reddit.com/link/1izv3v7/video/peee1onmxrle1/player

I also noticed a minor annoyance with the up arrow key. It feels mushy compared to the rest of the keyboard, which is a bit jarring in an otherwise premium experience.

**Keyboard:**

Apart from the one mushy key, the keyboard overall is a strong point. Coming from a MacBook, the keys require a bit more actuation force, but they are satisfyingly clicky and tactile. I was able to get up to my usual touch-typing speed quickly. Key travel is good, and overall, no complaints about the typing experience itself. My only minor quibble is the font choice on the keycaps. It’s fine, but I think a slightly different font or a smaller text size on the keys would look nicer. Purely subjective, though.

  
**Haptic Trackpad:**

This was a major selling point for me, and thankfully, the haptic trackpad is good. It replicates the feel of a physical click pretty well. However, I did notice a couple of quirks. There seems to be a subtle difference in pressure sensitivity – it feels like it requires slightly more pressure to click towards the top of the trackpad compared to the bottom.

More noticeably, I found that palm rejection isn't perfect. If the palm of my other hand rests slightly on the trackpad, clicks can sometimes fail to register. Also, and this might be a Windows thing (coming from macOS), you can't two-finger scroll and click simultaneously. On macOS, I'm used to being able to two-finger scroll and then click without lifting my fingers. On the EliteBook, you have to lift your fingers from the trackpad before clicking for the click to register. It took me a while to realize this was happening and why some clicks were being missed.

**Display:**

The OLED display is gorgeous. Colors are vibrant (if not a bit too vibrant at times), blacks are inky deep, and everything just pops. However, and it's a significant ""however,"" it is **incredibly reflective.** It’s like working in front of a mirror in bright environments. While the display is sharp and detailed, it's not bright enough to effectively combat the glare in well-lit spaces. In my typical dimly lit workspace, it’s fine, but in brighter conditions, the glare becomes a real problem, more so than I experienced with my MacBook Pro’s display.

**Camera:**

Wecam is fine, although my skin tone is really off and colors are over-saturated. This isn't just an OLED display issue. When I'm on a meeting, other people look fine, while I look either jaundiced or red as a tomato. The Poly Camera Pro software that comes installed weirdly doesn't allow me to adjust the white balance. This issue aside, the resolution and quality itself is great. It's just the colors are a bit weird.  

**Performance:**

Performance-wise, the EliteBook Ultra G1i is snappy and responsive for my productivity workload. As I mentioned, I'm mostly doing a bunch of productivity work, some light coding, and general web browsing. It handles everything I throw at it without breaking a sweat, and stays very quiet. Apart from initial setup, I basically never heard the fans. For my use case, performance is more than adequate.

**Battery Life: The Unforgivable Sin**

And now we come to the absolute dealbreaker: battery life. It is, in a word, abysmal. I’m consistently getting only 4-5 hours of real-world use, maybe 6!! And this is regardless of what I'm doing. Whether I'm just browsing the web in Edge, working in Google Docs, or doing anything else, the battery life hovers around the 5 hour mark. I have yet to break the 8-hour barrier, let alone reach the double-digit figures I was hoping for.

I consider myself fairly tech-savvy, and I’ve gone through all the usual stuff: checking startup apps, monitoring process usage, disabling unnecessary browser extensions, tweaking power settings – all to no avail. I can only conclude that HP hasn't properly optimized battery management on this laptop yet, or the hardware is simply power-hungry.

For a modern ultraportable in this price range, and especially one marketed towards business professionals, this battery life is simply unacceptable. It completely defeats the purpose of portability and long work sessions away from a power outlet. My old 2018 MacBook Pro, even with its old battery, often lasted longer.

**Conclusion:**

This is a tough one. The HP EliteBook Ultra G1i has a lot going for it. The build quality is generally excellent, the keyboard and trackpad are good (albeit with some quirks), and the OLED display is stunning (if overly reflective). Performance is more than sufficient for productivity tasks. However, the catastrophic battery life completely overshadows all its positives. For a laptop that is supposed to be a premium, ultraportable business machine, lasting only 4-5 hours on a charge is simply not good enough. It fails in its fundamental purpose as a portable device in 2025.

After much deliberation, I've decided to return the HP EliteBook Ultra G1i. It’s a shame, as I wanted to love this laptop. But battery life is a non-negotiable for me, especially at this price point (I dropped $2,300 USD on this). I’ll be going back to using my work laptop while I do more research and wait for more Lunar Lake (and maybe AMD Strix Point?) options to become available and reviewed.

Happy to answer any questions you have about my experience with the EliteBook Ultra G1i. Hopefully, this review will help others in their laptop search!",1,1740702934.0,laptops,2,1.0,False
1izv3sq,https://www.reddit.com/r/CoffeeBrewerReviews/comments/1izv3sq/does_the_breville_nespresso_essenza_mini_espresso/,Does the Breville Nespresso Essenza Mini Espresso Machine live up to the hype? A comprehensive review.,"Testing out the Breville Nespresso Essenza Mini Espresso Machine (model BEC220BLK1AUC1) made me approach mornings with a new sense of anticipation. As someone who relies on that first cup of espresso to kickstart the day, I was eager to see if this compact espresso machine could deliver the same coffeehouse-quality brew I’ve come to expect, all while fitting neatly onto my cluttered kitchen counter. Spoiler alert: it’s not perfect, but it’s pretty darn close!

**Design & Build Quality**

The first thing that struck me about the Essenza Mini was its sleek and minimalist design. It’s incredibly compact, measuring only 4.3 x 8 x 12.8 inches, and it doesn’t hog precious counter space. The black metallic finish is modern and unobtrusive, blending seamlessly with my kitchen’s aesthetic. While it’s lightweight at just under six pounds, it doesn’t feel flimsy. The sturdy build reassured me that it could handle daily use without falling apart. However, the small size comes with trade-offs—the water tank and used capsule container are quite petite and require frequent refilling and emptying.

[Check Breville Nespresso Essenza Mini Espresso Machine price on Amazon.](https://idealcoffeeshop.com/price/b073zgwn12/)

**Features**

This machine offers two programmable cup sizes: espresso (1.35 oz) and lungo (5 oz), making it incredibly versatile for different preferences. The 19-bar high-pressure pump is a standout feature, delivering a rich crema that rivals professional machines. I also appreciated the fast heat-up time, which had the machine ready to go in just 25 seconds. The eco-mode kicks in after three minutes of inactivity, and the auto shut-off after nine minutes is a nice touch for energy efficiency. While it’s packed with features, I did wish it included a built-in frother for an all-in-one experience.

**Brewing Performance**

Using the Essenza Mini, I was impressed by how consistently it brewed espresso. The 19-bar pump ensures optimal extraction, resulting in a full-bodied flavor with a velvety crema on top. I tested it with Nespresso capsules and some third-party brands, and the results were equally satisfying. However, it’s worth noting that the machine occasionally struggled with off-brand capsules, which required slight adjustments to fit properly.

**Coffee Quality**

The coffee quality is where this machine truly shines. The espresso is rich, aromatic, and smooth, with no bitterness—a noticeable step up from my previous machine. As someone who loves experimenting, I tried the complimentary set of 16 Nespresso capsules included with the purchase. The variety of flavors and intensities was a delightful bonus, though I quickly developed favorites and stocked up on those.

**Milk Frothing & Steaming Capability**

This is where the Essenza Mini falls short. It doesn’t come with a built-in frother, which means you’ll need to invest in a separate frothing device if lattes or cappuccinos are your go-to drinks. I paired it with the Aeroccino frother, which worked well but added to the overall cost. For the price and size of the machine, I understand why this feature is excluded, but it’s something to consider if frothy drinks are a priority.

**Water Tank & Capacity**

The water tank holds just 20.3 ounces, which translates to about four lungo-sized coffees before requiring a refill. This isn’t a dealbreaker for me, but it could be inconvenient for households with multiple coffee drinkers. The tank is removable, making it easy to clean and refill, though its narrow design makes it slightly awkward to handle.

**Maintenance & Cleaning**

One of the Essenza Mini’s strongest points is how easy it is to maintain. The used capsule container holds about six pods, and emptying it is straightforward. Cleaning is equally simple, with most components being removable and washable. I only wish the drip tray had a larger capacity—it fills up quickly, especially if you’re brewing back-to-back cups.

**Energy Efficiency & Noise Levels**

Despite its small size, this machine packs quite a punch, and it’s surprisingly quiet while brewing. Compared to my old machine, the Essenza Mini is practically whisper-quiet, which my early-rising spouse greatly appreciates. The energy-saving features, including auto shut-off, make it eco-friendly and cost-efficient in the long run.

**Warranty & Support**

Breville provides a one-year warranty for the Essenza Mini, which is fairly standard. I haven’t needed to contact customer support yet, but reviews suggest their team is responsive and helpful. Knowing there’s a safety net in case of issues adds peace of mind.

**Pluses**

* Compact and space-saving design.
* Consistently brews rich, high-quality espresso.
* Fast heat-up time of 25 seconds.
* Energy-saving features like auto shut-off.
* Easy to clean and maintain.

**Minus Points**

* Small water tank requires frequent refilling.
* No built-in frother for milk-based drinks.
* Limited capacity for used capsules.
* Struggles occasionally with off-brand pods.

**Competing Products**

When comparing the Breville Essenza Mini to its competitors, like the DeLonghi Inissia or the VertuoLine series, several key differences emerge. The Inissia is slightly noisier and less compact but offers a similar brewing experience. The VertuoLine, on the other hand, excels in versatility with its ability to brew larger cups of coffee. However, the Vertuo pods are pricier and lack third-party options, making the Essenza Mini a more economical choice in the long term.

**Financial Value**

Considering its compact size, impressive brewing capabilities, and overall performance, the Essenza Mini offers great value for its price. While the lack of a built-in frother and small water tank are compromises, they don’t outweigh the machine’s strengths. If you’re looking for an affordable yet high-quality espresso machine, this one checks most of the boxes.

I can go on an on, so ask me when we get to know each other. I DONT smoke or into stimulants besides coffee, not into clubbing, or drinking unless it's between us instead of a social setting. 
I am very direct and honest, I'm pretty reserved with strangers, never to my partner of course. I'm extremely affectionate, skinship is very important to me. Etc etc ask for the rest.

What I look for in partner is consistentsy, honesty and communication. Someone who wants kids, is  conservative when it comes to dating/roles(you can work if you want...not because you have to). I'm old fashion, I like to open doors, show affection with my lover perhaps..show a bit of possessivenes. I preffer someone who is Needy and always wants praise and attention. I only have energy for one person and or my kids. I want us to always be close or nearby. Having dinner everyday, share a bed everyday and night. Someone who Is more or less oxygen to me. 
Now physical preferences? I preffer somone who is either Asian or Hispanic, but I am open to most backgrounds. Overall I value compatibility and someone who compliments my life.

I was still glued with work then she asked me again:

Bebu: you renewed your passport, na di ba? 

Me: yes po, last year pa.  

Bebu: Dala mo ba? May titingnan lang ako

Me: babe, nasa pocket sa loob ng backpack ko

I couldnt care more kung anong kelangan nya sa passport ko since importante matapos ko ung mga work assignment ko.

Bebu: long weekend ung June 12, can you file a leave on the 13th and 16th? 

Me: may lakad tayo?

Bebu: Yeah, let's go to Sapa. So un na ung Christmas and Bday gift ko sayo ha. 

Then she showed me the tickets and all I need to do is book the sleeper bus and hotel. I kissed her sobrang saya ko, minsan talaga maraming humps and bumps sa road to forever, mahaba ang byahe so patience is virtue. And kapag nasa tamang tao ka, you will enjoy the ride kahit na imperfect.

“

Well, I'd like to say I have something positive to say, however, I digress.

[REDACTED RESTAURANT NAME], a new establishment in an otherwise dying location (the strip mall)
Noted them putting it together for a couple of months.
The other place there failed 6 seconds after it opened...(this place I think wants to challenge the longevity of an established place by having a horrible review day 1)

Moving forward:

I have no idea the food quality.  I came by early to get coffee at a fast food joint in same parking lot, noted a lunch/dinner place open at 8 AM.  ok...
Drove by, picked up menu.  (Guy gave me 2)
I like Gyro's so, hey!  Close to home, GREAT!!.
I drive up to drive up window and was going to order.  I was immediately chastised by a little Indian friend (not native American) and was 1) scoffed at??!! 2)had head shaken at me like I'm being absurd by driving up to a lunch/dinner place at 8 AM because SOMEBODY is confused, not me.)  and was told they ""usually do on-line orders""....the fxk??
Ok.

LOOSE the drive up window or put directions out ""for internet orders only"".
You're a brand new location...how the hades do you ""usually"" do anything????!!!  You've literally been opened less than 3 days and you ""usually"" do anything???!!!  Shut up already.
Lost this ""local support""...
Dumb as dumb gets.
First of all, post some hours on the storefront.
Second:  when one of the very first patrons you get gets insulted by your arrogance, expect a short-lived business.
The rudeness level is over-the-top unacceptable.  Seriously.  You're in America; recognize American customs and try, really try to not forget you NEED patrons for your business to survive.
Open at breakfast hours serving pictured menu and then having the audacity to chastise new patronage...
Can't fix stupid ...  🤷‍♂️🤦‍♂️🤦🏽‍♂️

The cabin was alive with laughter as the group of friends settled in for their annual winter retreat. Outside, the snow blanketed the landscape in a thick, glistening layer, transforming the world into a winter wonderland. Inside, the warmth of the fire crackled in the hearth, casting flickering shadows on the wooden walls. The scent of pine mingled with the rich aroma of hot cocoa and whiskey, creating a cozy atmosphere. They shared stories of past trips, reminiscing about the exhilarating slopes, the laughter that echoed through the nights, and the strange, unexplainable sights they had encountered along the way—moments that had become cherished memories and inside jokes among them.

As the night wore on, Jake, emboldened by the warmth of the whiskey coursing through him, leaned back in his chair, a playful grin on his face. “Hey, remember that ski resort we went to two years ago? That place was—” 

“Shh!” Emma’s voice sliced through the cozy atmosphere like a shard of ice. Her eyes flicked anxiously to the windows, where the wind howled and the snow swirled violently outside, as if the snow itself were listening. The laughter in the room faded, replaced by a heavy silence. The others exchanged anxious glances, their earlier smiles now replaced with unease, sensing the weight of unspoken memories hovering in the air like a ghost.

“What?” Jake protested, confusion knitting his brow. “What’s the big deal?”

“Don’t talk about it, never bring that trip back up!” Mia whispered urgently, her voice trembling slightly as if the very mention of it could summon something dark. She leaned closer, her wide eyes reflecting the flickering firelight, filled with a mix of fear and desperation. “Don’t you remember? We agreed never to mention it again.” Mia’s tone was serious, almost pleading, as she glanced nervously at the door, as if expecting it to burst open at any moment, unleashing the specters of their past. The atmosphere grew thick with unspoken dread, wrapping around them like the chilling wind outside.

Jake rolled his eyes, trying to dismiss the tension that hung in the air like a thick fog. Yet, the unease in the room was palpable, each of his friends stiffening at the mention of their shared past. “Come on, it was just a freak accident. The avalanche was a fluke—”

“It wasn’t an accident,” Mark interrupted, his voice low and gravelly, cutting through Jake’s bravado like a knife. He leaned forward, the firelight casting harsh shadows across his face, revealing the lines of worry etched deep into his brow. “You know what happened after that.” His words hung heavily in the air, a chilling reminder of the chaos and fear they had faced, and the haunting memories that still lingered in the corners of their minds.

The fire crackled softly, sending up occasional sparks that flickered like fireflies, while the shadows danced on the walls, twisting into ominous shapes. Jake scoffed, trying to mask his unease, but the weight of their words hung heavily in the air, thickening the atmosphere around them. “You guys are being ridiculous. It’s extremely sad we lost Tony to the avalanche,” he said, his voice tinged with frustration, “but blaming his disappearance on something that wasn’t even there is just delusional.” He leaned back, crossing his arms defensively, though a flicker of doubt crossed his face. “Besides, I believe Tony is still out there. I don’t think he died in that avalanche.” His conviction felt fragile, as if the very act of saying it could shatter the hope he clung to, and the room fell silent, each person grappling with their own memories of that fateful day.

Emma leaned forward, her expression grave, the firelight casting deep shadows across her features. “We barely made it out alive!” she said, her voice quivering with the weight of the past. 

“Yeah,” Mia chimed in, a shiver running down her spine as if the memories were a chill that seeped into her bones. “I still have nightmares about it. Those whispers we heard… I still hear them from time to time.” Her eyes widened as she recalled the eerie sounds that had pierced the howling wind, a haunting echo that refused to fade. The room felt colder, the flickering flames suddenly inadequate against the creeping dread that enveloped them, as they collectively confronted the shadows of their shared trauma.

Jake opened his mouth to argue, but the words caught in his throat as he noticed the eerie silence that had settled over the room, amplifying the tension. Outside, the wind howled like a wounded animal, and a sudden chill swept through the cabin, causing the flames in the fireplace to dance erratically. The lights flickered ominously, casting elongated shadows that seemed to pulse with a life of their own. In that moment, a wave of memory surged back, crashing over him: the frantic escape through the snow, adrenaline coursing through his veins, the shadows lurking just beyond the tree line, watching and waiting, and the visceral sense of being hunted, as if something unseen was trailing them through the darkness. The recollection gripped him, and for the first time, doubt crept into his mind, challenging his earlier bravado.

“Alright, fine,” Jake said, swallowing hard, the words tasting bitter on his tongue. “Let’s change the subject.” 

But the very act of trying to dismiss the haunting memories seemed to stir something in the atmosphere, a restless energy that crackled around them. The lights flickered again, this time more violently, buzzing with an unsettling urgency before plunging the room into darkness. The sudden absence of light felt suffocating, wrapping them in an oppressive silence that was almost tangible. Panic surged through Jake as he glanced around, the familiar shapes of the room now distorted and menacing in the pitch black. This time, there was no reassuring glow to guide them back to safety, only the weight of their fears pressing in from all sides.

“What happened?” Mia whispered, her face pale, the dim light casting an ashen hue over her features. 

“Just the wind,” Mark replied, though uncertainty laced his voice, making it clear he wasn’t entirely convinced. He glanced toward the windows, where shadows danced ominously against the glass, and the howling wind outside seemed to echo his unease. “There’s supposed to be a snowstorm coming; I just checked the weather before we lost power. We should probably leave by tomorrow morning so we’re not caught in the storm… you know, like the last time.” His words hung in the air, heavy with meaning, conjuring memories of that fateful day when they had been trapped, helpless and terrified, as nature unleashed its fury upon them. The thought sent a shiver down Mia's spine, and she instinctively wrapped her arms around herself, as if to ward off the chill of the past.

“Yeah, Mark is right,” Emma said, her voice tinged with fatigue. “Maybe we should call it a night. I mean, the lights are out anyway.” 

Mia nodded in agreement, her eyes darting nervously to the dark corners of the room, as if expecting something to emerge from the shadows. But Jake brushed aside their suggestions with a wave of his hand. “If you guys want to go to bed, feel free, but I’m staying up and having another drink. Care to join me, Mark?” he asked, a hint of defiance in his tone. 

“I’ll have one more,” Mark replied, glancing between Jake and the door leading to the bedrooms, “but then I’m with the ladies. If we leave tomorrow morning, you don’t want to be too hungover.” His voice was light, yet the underlying tension in the air made it clear that even a casual drink felt like a gamble in the face of uncertainty. The flickering embers in the fireplace cast a warm glow, contrasting sharply with the chilling darkness outside, as if the cabin itself was urging them to retreat from the night’s creeping dread.

“Yeah, yeah,” Jake said, the burn of the alcohol already warming his cheeks and dulling the edges of his worries. As Emma and Mia headed upstairs to prepare for bed, their footsteps fading into the creaking floorboards, Jake sank deeper into the worn sofa beside Mark. The flickering fire cast a soft glow, illuminating the room in a warm, intimate haze, while Mark lit a cigarette, the smoke curling lazily into the air. 

They chatted about sports—lively debates about teams and games—that filled the space with a sense of camaraderie. The conversation shifted to skiing, with both men reminiscing about past trips, the thrill of racing down slopes and the camaraderie of the lodge. Then, with a hesitant breath, Mark opened up a little about his crush on Emma, his voice lowering as if sharing a secret. He described her laughter, the way her eyes sparkled when she spoke, and the way she seemed to light up the room. Jake listened, a knowing smile creeping onto his face, the warmth of the alcohol mingling with the warmth of friendship, yet the underlying tension of the night lingered just below the surface, reminding them of the shadows outside.

“Dude, you should just tell her. We’ve all been friends for a while,” Jake said, leaning back into the cushions, the alcohol giving him a sense of boldness.

“Yeah, that’s the thing,” Mark replied, a frown creasing his brow. “We’re just friends; I don’t want to make things weird.” His gaze drifted to the flickering fire, as if seeking answers in the dancing flames.

“You’ll never get your answer unless you go for it,” Jake said with a dismissive shrug, tossing back the last of his drink and feeling the warmth spread through him. He set his glass down with a thud on the coffee table, the sound echoing in the quiet room, and then turned to Mark, curiosity piqued. “Say, what’s up with you and the ladies about that ski resort? I get it was tragic, but I mean, it’s been two years, man.”

Mark's expression shifted, a shadow crossing his features as he recalled the memories tied to that fateful trip. The weight of the past hung heavy in the air, mingling with the smoke from his cigarette, and Jake could sense the unease beneath Mark's bravado. The flickering fire illuminated their faces, revealing the unspoken fears that lingered just below the surface.

Mark shifted uncomfortably in his seat, the cushions creaking beneath him as he ran a hand through his hair, a nervous habit that betrayed his agitation. “Jake, you know as well as I do they never found Tony’s body,” he said, his voice low and tense, laden with the weight of unspoken grief. “You heard the whispers like we all did—the stories that spread through the lodge like wildfire, chilling our bones. And those shadow figures… you saw them too.” His eyes locked onto Jake’s, searching for understanding, for validation. “So why are you acting like nothing happened?” The flickering firelight danced across his face, highlighting the tension etched in his features, as memories of that fateful trip clawed at the edges of his mind, refusing to let go.

“Because we were scared! Our brains imagined all the extra stuff to boost our adrenaline and get us out of there,” Jake argued, his voice rising slightly as passion ignited in him. “Tony is still alive and out there somewhere. I just know he is.” He leaned forward, his eyes alight with conviction. “He’s a tough man, an adventurer, used to the outdoors, especially in the snow. I don’t believe he’s buried deep beneath a blanket of white; I believe he made it out.” A flicker of desperation crossed his face as he continued, “He’s somewhere, Mark. I know he is.”

“Coming from the guy who called us delusional, you sound very much the same,” Mark shot back, crossing his arms defensively. The fire crackled in the background, casting shadows that danced along the walls, and the tension in the room thickened as their opposing beliefs clashed. Mark's brow furrowed, and he struggled to reconcile Jake's unwavering hope with the grim reality they had faced. The memories of that harrowing night loomed large, and the unresolved pain swirled in the air between them, heavy and palpable.

Just then, a sudden knock echoed through the cabin, sharp and jarring against the quiet. The two men exchanged bewildered glances, confusion etched on their faces. There shouldn’t be anyone at their cabin, especially not at this hour, when the night draped everything in an unsettling stillness.

Jake sensed Mark’s unease, the way his hands fidgeted in his lap, a clear sign that the mention of the ski trip had rattled him further. Taking a deep breath to steady himself, Jake stood up, his heart racing as he approached the door. The warm glow of the fire flickered behind him, casting elongated shadows that danced along the walls. He leaned in close to the peephole, peering through its small lens, but the view revealed nothing but darkness—a void that seemed to swallow the night whole. A chill ran down his spine as he wondered who, or what, could be lingering just beyond the threshold.

“It must have been the wind,” Jake said, trying to sound casual, though a knot of unease twisted in his stomach. Just as he finished speaking, a loud bang reverberated from the other side of the door, startling both men and causing them to jump in unison, their hearts pounding in their chests. 

The sudden noise shattered the fragile calm of the cabin, and the air felt charged with tension. From upstairs, Emma and Mia rushed down the creaking stairs, their eyes wide with concern. “What was that? Are you guys alright?” Mia asked, her voice laced with worry as she glanced between Jake and Mark. The flickering firelight illuminated their anxious expressions, and Jake could see fear reflected in their eyes, the atmosphere thickening with uncertainty as they all grappled with the unsettling mystery of what lay beyond the door.

“Yeah, we’re fine. Just must be some really strong winds out there,” Jake replied, forcing a casual tone despite the unease gnawing at him. “Let’s call it a night and head out in the morning.” He finally agreed, eager to put the unsettling encounter behind them. However, just as the group began to turn away, another loud bang echoed through the cabin, reverberating with a jarring intensity that froze them in their tracks.

The sudden noise hung in the air, and Jake slowly turned to face the door, his heart racing. “Go see what that is!” Mia urged, her voice rising with urgency. “Why? Let’s just go to bed and ignore it,” Jake countered, a hint of defiance creeping into his tone. But before he could dismiss the noise again, the banging intensified, becoming a relentless rhythm that pounded against the door, each thud echoing ominously in the stillness of the night. The tension in the room thickened, and the flickering shadows around them seemed to grow darker, as if the cabin itself was holding its breath, waiting for an answer to the growing mystery.

“It’s back…” Emma whispered softly, her voice barely above a breath, as if acknowledging an unwelcome presence that had returned. There was an eerie acceptance in her tone, a resignation that made Jake's skin crawl.

“No, it’s nothing,” he insisted, trying to shake off the chill creeping up his spine. “Jeez, I’ll prove it since you guys want to be scared so bad. There’s literally nothing behind this door,” he declared, stepping forward with determination.

He began walking towards the door, each step amplifying the rapid thumping of his heart, a drumbeat of dread echoing in his chest. The reluctance to confront whatever lay beyond the threshold weighed heavily on him, a palpable tension that made his palms sweat and his breath quicken.

With trembling hands, Jake grasped the doorknob, his fingers icy against the metal as he turned it. As the door creaked open, a rush of frigid air swept into the cabin, wrapping around him like a cold embrace. The sharp scent of pine filled his nostrils, but mingling with it was something far more sinister—an odor that was distinctly rotten, clinging to the air like a dark omen. Outside, the snow swirled in a chaotic frenzy, thick flakes obscuring his vision and transforming the world beyond into a swirling white abyss, as if it were hiding secrets he wasn't ready to uncover.

“See, guys, there’s nothing there. Just snow,” Jake said, trying to maintain his composure. But before he could finish his thought, he paused, a chilling realization creeping over him. Somewhere in the distance, he could hear it—the unmistakable sound of a voice he thought he had left behind.

As he squinted into the swirling white, a figure began to emerge from among the trees, its outline blurred and indistinct against the backdrop of the storm. The voice rang out again, cutting through the howling wind, echoing through the woods with a haunting familiarity that sent chills racing down his spine. Each syllable felt like a ghostly whisper, intertwining with the frigid air, and Jake’s breath hitched as the dread in his gut intensified, solidifying the sense that they were no longer alone in the wilderness.

“Jake, come back inside now!” Emma screamed, her voice laced with panic, but he felt as if he were rooted to the spot, caught in an irresistible pull that drew him toward the mysterious figure.

Suddenly, the figure moved closer, and Jake’s heart raced wildly as he recognized the familiar face—a friend they had lost during that fateful trip, the memory of which haunted them all. The figure’s eyes, wide with desperation, locked onto his, and he felt an overwhelming urge to reach out. “Help me,” the friend mouthed, the words barely a whisper against the howling wind, floating toward him like a ghostly plea. The cold air seemed to thicken around Jake, wrapping him in a chilling embrace as the reality of the moment sunk in, blurring the lines between memory and the present.

Without thinking, Jake took a step forward, compelled by a force he couldn't comprehend. But before he could move any closer, the others lunged at him, gripping his arms tightly and dragging him back into the cabin. The door slammed shut behind them with a resounding thud, echoing like a final verdict, and the atmosphere shifted dramatically. 

What had once been a tense silence was now pierced by laughter—a chilling, echoing sound that rose like a crescendo, growing louder and more mocking. It slithered through the walls, wrapping around them like a sinister shroud, as if the very essence of their fear had taken form and was reveling in their terror. The laughter twisted in the air, a taunting reminder of the danger lurking just outside, igniting a primal instinct to flee, yet leaving them paralyzed in dread.

“Why did you say anything?” Mia cried, her voice breaking as tears streamed down her cheeks, glistening in the dim light of the cabin. “We were safe! We could have just stayed inside!”

“Where do we go now? We’re trapped!!” Emma shouted, her panic rising like a tide, her eyes darting around the room as if searching for an escape that wasn’t there. 

“Whatever you do, don’t look outside,” Mark warned, his voice steady yet strained, a fragile facade masking the terror swirling in his eyes. He shifted his weight, glancing at the door as if it were a living thing, ready to burst open at any moment. The air was thick with tension, each breath heavy with unspoken fears, as they all braced themselves for whatever darkness awaited them just beyond the walls.

The banging on the door was so powerful and intense that they could see the sturdy wood quaking with each violent blow, splintering the fragile calm that had enveloped them. The relentless pounding reverberated through the cabin, growing more thunderous with every strike, until it felt as though the entire structure was shaking with fear itself, rattling the very bones of the walls.

“Do NOT look outside!” Mark shouted again, his voice cutting through the chaos like a knife. He turned to Jake, whose face wore an unreadable expression, a mixture of dread and determination flickering in his eyes. “It’s him… it’s Tony. I told you he was out there still! We have to help him!” Jake exclaimed, urgency lacing his words as he stepped closer to the door, the gravity of his plea hanging heavy in the air. The fear in the room intensified, a palpable tension that threatened to suffocate them as they grappled with the choice between safety and loyalty.

“No!” Emma shouted, her voice cracking with desperation. “It’s not him, Jake! It’s not!” Mark stepped forward, grabbing Jake by the shoulders and shaking him with urgency, as if trying to jolt him into reality. But honestly, what was reality at this point? The lines had blurred, and the cabin felt like a trap, its walls closing in around them.

“It is him! You saw him!” Jake insisted, his voice rising with a fervor that echoed his desperation. “I’m going to help him!” He pushed Mark away, determination burning in his eyes as he took a step toward the door, the cold air outside beckoning him like a siren’s call. “Jake!” Mark yelled, lunging forward to grab his shirt, yanking him back with all his strength. “Don’t be stupid!” But Jake, fueled by a mix of fear and resolve, responded with a swift blow to Mark’s face, breaking free from his grip. He sprinted toward the door, heart pounding in his chest, each step echoing the reckless urgency of his decision.

Mark rubbed his nose, still in disbelief, his mind racing as he stood frozen in place, paralyzed by the unfolding chaos. “Jake! Please, no!!” Emma screamed, her voice filled with a mixture of fear and desperation that echoed through the cabin.

But it was too late. With a sudden burst of resolve, Jake swung the door open and shouted, “Tony! I’m here, Tony, where are you?” As he stepped outside, his foot sank almost a foot into the thick, powdery snow, the coldness biting at his ankles. The wind howled around him, picking up intensity, and the storm began to roll in slowly, dark clouds swirling ominously above. “Tony!” Jake called out again, his voice strained against the roaring wind, desperation lacing each syllable as he scanned the white landscape, hoping for a glimpse of his friend amidst the encroaching darkness.

He heard something moving behind him, a rustling in the eerie stillness that sent a shiver down his spine. But before he could turn around to investigate, a cold, hard object came crashing into his skull with a sickening thud, sending stars exploding behind his eyes. Pain radiated through his head as Jake crumbled to the ground, the shock of the blow stealing his breath away. The pristine white snow, once untouched and glistening, was now stained crimson, a stark contrast that painted the scene with an ominous finality. As darkness began to creep in at the edges of his vision, the world around him felt distant and surreal, a chilling reminder of the peril he had stepped into.

The others huddled together in the dim light of the cabin, their faces etched with worry and fear. “Jake hasn’t come back yet,” Emma said quietly, her voice barely above a whisper, as if saying it aloud would make it more real. “What do we do?” Mia asked, her eyes darting nervously around the room, searching for answers in the shadows.

“Stay here! He was dumb enough to go out there,” Mark snapped, his frustration boiling over as he paced the cramped space, the tension in the air thickening with each passing moment.

“But are we safe here?” Mia questioned, her voice trembling slightly, a flicker of doubt creeping in. Mark didn’t respond, his silence heavy with uncertainty. Just then, they heard footsteps crunching in the snow outside, a sound that sent chills down their spines. “Jake!” Mia exclaimed, her heart racing as she rushed toward the door, hope igniting within her. But as she swung it open, she was immediately pulled back by what she saw next—a dark figure emerging from the swirling snow, its silhouette ominous and unfamiliar, twisting her anticipation into dread.

Mia fainted, her body collapsing like a ragdoll onto the cold wooden floor, the thud echoing in the tense silence. Emma and Mark rushed toward her, their hearts pounding with urgency, but they too halted in terror at the sight before them. Standing in the doorway was the same figure that had haunted their nightmares for the last two years, a dark silhouette cloaked in shadows and dread. Its presence felt suffocating, as though the very air around them had thickened with fear. This was the same entity that had taken their friend, snatching away their sense of safety and plunging them into a world of despair. Now, it seemed to loom larger than ever, a chilling reminder that it had come for another, and the reality of their situation settled in like ice in their veins.

The figure loomed before them, an imposing presence that stood nearly ten feet tall, casting a long shadow across the cabin. Its body was grotesquely thin, as if it had never known sustenance, with bones protruding at odd angles, creating a nightmarish silhouette. Its fingers were unnaturally elongated, tapering to sharp, blade-like tips that glinted menacingly in the dim light. The creature’s teeth jutted out like tusks, sharp and glistening, giving it a feral appearance that sent a wave of revulsion through Emma and Mark.

With a primal cry that reverberated in their chests, it leapt over Mia’s unconscious body, a pool of crimson liquid rapidly spreading across the wooden floorboards, stark against the pale surroundings. Mark’s instincts kicked in, and he started to scream, desperate to divert the creature's attention. His voice echoed in the cabin, but it only served to draw the creature closer. In an instant, it pounced on him, howling as it pinned him down, its weight crushing. Emma stood frozen in terror, paralyzed by the horror unfolding before her; all she could do was watch in silent despair as the creature towered over them.

As it straightened up, hunched and menacing within the cramped space, it turned its dark, sunken eyes toward Emma. A chill ran down her spine as it spoke two words, its voice hauntingly familiar, echoing Jake’s tone: “I’m back.”",2,1740702416.0,scarystories,0,1.0,False

For those planning extended stays abroad (like I did when I burned out from my marketing job last year), I wanted to share the 5 most budget-friendly countries I experienced:

# Vietnam

Honestly, the value here blew my mind. I stayed in central Hanoi for $300/month in a decent apartment, ate incredible street food for $1-2 per meal, and the coffee culture is unmatched. The night trains between cities saved me both accommodation and flight costs.

# Indonesia (beyond Bali)

Everyone flocks to Bali, but venture to places like Yogyakarta or Flores and your money stretches twice as far. I paid $8/night for beachfront bungalows that would cost $100+ back home.

# Cambodia

Siem Reap and Phnom Penh are still incredibly affordable. I volunteered at an English center for a month and my expenses barely hit $600 including weekend trips to nearby towns.

# Philippines

Island life doesn't have to break the bank! While getting between islands costs money, once you're settled somewhere like Cebu or Palawan, daily expenses are minimal and the beaches are paradise.

# Laos

The most underrated budget destination! Laid-back vibes, $5 guesthouses, and $0.50 noodle soups everywhere. Plus, the locals taught me to slow down and appreciate life at a different pace.

If you're planning a longer trip and want to dive deeper into cost breakdowns and how to find those hidden spots tourists miss, I wrote a detailed guide on my blog about ""[Discover the Hidden Gems of East Asia: Your Ultimate Travel Guide](https://asiajourney.org/cheapest-countries-in-southeast-asia/)"" which includes sample budgets, neighborhood recommendations, and even language tips.

Made a planer sled for the top, which worked surprisingly well for leveling. I'll use this approach in the future. The bottom is a rotten barn beam that I attempted to bookmark but ended up filling the voids with epoxy which I dyed ""rust red."" The legs are cherry that my bro and I milled from a downed tree in WV. In fact, all of the wood is sourced from my granddad's farm. I'm not 100% sure of the species other than the cherry legs, but it's 100% Appalachian hard wood.

I used Rubio monocoat for the finish. Because of the epoxy, the bottom beam was sanded up to 1000, 0000 steel wool with epoxy polisher, and finally monocoat. I'm not sure that was necessary, but that's the internet said to do. The bottom beam finish makes ot feel like a piece of plastic and not like wood at all. I'm happy with the result as it acts as a subtle accent rather than a loud contrasting splash of color.

1izuubu,https://www.reddit.com/r/MaximizeMe/comments/1izuubu/10_lessons_from_minimalism_to_simplify_and_enrich/,10 Lessons from Minimalism to Simplify and Enrich Your Life,"Hey MaximizeMe community!

Ever feel like your life is a cluttered mess that's more tangled than last year’s holiday lights? 😅 I’ve been there too. I was drowning in stuff—both in my closet and in my head—before I stumbled upon minimalism. It changed everything. Here’s a little journey of 10 lessons minimalism taught me that might help you simplify and enrich your life without becoming a total hermit. Yes, it’s possible!

1. **Less Stuff = More Freedom**  
   I always thought I needed the latest gadgets and fanciest clothes to be happy. Spoiler alert: I didn’t! Cutting back on possessions felt like cutting away chains I didn’t even know existed.

2. **Quality Over Quantity**  
   Seriously, how many spatulas does one person need? Focus on things that last and matter, not the endless parade of Dollar Store temptations. (Alright, maybe just one spatula backup…)

3. **Intentional Living**  
   ***Does this add value?*** is my new mantra. It’s amazing how saying ""no"" to things gives you time for stuff that truly matters.

4. **Financial Freedom**  
   Minimalism doesn’t mean being cheap; it’s being smart with your resources. My savings account has never looked happier, and guess what? My coffee tastes just as good from my old French press.

5. **Declutter to De-stress**  
   Clearing my space cleared my mind. It turns out, fewer things to dust means more time to chill. Neat freaks, rejoice! 😂

6. **Say No to Negative Nancies**  
   Surround yourself with people who bring joy, not drama. Trust me, your *group chat* will be better for it.

7. **Mindfulness Matters**  
   Living with less has made me more aware of my choices. It’s a daily practice—not just tidying up my house, but tidying up my mind too.

8. **Redefine Success**  
   Turns out, success isn’t measured in square footage or sports cars. Who knew? Happiness and fulfillment are my new benchmarks, and I’m *loving* the peace.

9. **Find Joy in Experience, Not Things**  
   If you can’t remember every birthday gift you’ve ever gotten, but that one epic hiking trip is forever etched in your memory, you get where I’m going with this.

10. **Embrace Imperfection**  
   Minimalism doesn’t mean perfect homes with white couches (hats off to those brave souls with kids!), it’s about making room for what’s important in your imperfectly perfect world.

Feeling like you’re ready to dip your toes into this minimalistic wonderland? Or maybe you’ve already started? Whatever your journey, remember that it’s personal and there’s no ‘right’ way to do it.

Imagine a life where “having it all” means less stress, more freedom, and room to breathe. Doesn’t that sound amazing?

My girl is flying into Kochi in a couple of weeks, and I want to make her arrival as special and unforgettable as possible. She means the world to me, and I want her first impression of Kochi to be filled with love, excitement, and surprises!

Here’s what I’ve planned so far:
	•	I’ll be picking her up from the airport with floating balloons and a bouquet of fresh flowers.
	•	I want to add some extra touches, maybe a romantic welcome sign, her favorite coffee, or a small surprise gift.
	•	Thinking of playing her favorite song when she arrives and decorating my car with a few romantic elements.

But I don’t want to stop there—I want this to be next-level special! So I need your help:
	1.	Where can I get high-quality helium balloons and fresh flowers in Kochi? (Any specific shops or online services you’d recommend?)
	2.	What else can I do at the airport or during the ride home to make it more romantic and fun?
	3.	Any unique date ideas or must-visit spots in Kochi where I can take her over the weekend? (Bonus points if they’re romantic, cozy, or offer a great experience!)

I’d love to hear your creative, romantic, or even quirky ideas! Looking forward to your suggestions—let’s make this moment unforgettable!

1izutuu,https://www.reddit.com/r/Tonsillectomy/comments/1izutuu/long_post_positive_tonsillectomy_experience/,LONG Post: Positive Tonsillectomy Experience,"**TL;DR:** My (29F) experience with the tonsillectomy was totally manageable. At worst, I would say my pain hit an 8 or 9 for 15-20 minutes at a time. I experienced far more discomfort than pain throughout the recovery process and had no complications or bleeding post-op. I have experienced a lot of fatigue since the surgery (at three weeks post-op I’d say I’ve still got a ways to go to feel totally myself) but am glad I got the procedure done. **The absolute best thing you can do for yourself before and throughout the process is to hydrate beyond all reason.**

Now for specifics:

Like many other posts in this subreddit, this is my (29F, California USA) pay-it-forward post—this sub helped me prepare for my tonsillectomy and likely made my experience much more manageable. Today marks three weeks post-op. I hope you find something here that's helpful for you!

**Backstory**

* I have had large tonsils all my life. Frequent tonsil stones, soreness, and itching, but no major issues or infections prior to late 2023. (The first time I saw my ENT, he felt my jaw and said I had “perfect bone structure for somebody with big tonsils.” I got a kick out of that. The point being, while they were large, they weren’t an obstruction to my breathing or day-to-day life.)
* In November of 2023 I had my first round of full-blown tonsillitis. It took one course of steroids and then two rounds of antibiotics to get it gone, and it recurred within a few months. I believe that from Nov 2023-Jan 2025 I was on antibiotics six or seven times for recurrent inflammation, so finally I decided to proceed with the surgery.

**Surgery Prep**

* I did my absolute best to hydrate well in the weeks before surgery. Ideally I would have been regular with vitamins, and eaten well or even a little extra in anticipation of potential malnutrition. However, I’m grieving the loss of a loved one and a breakup, so the full extent of that prep was a little out of reach for me.
* I also made the decision to recover at my parents’ house (San Diego area) instead of mine (San Bernardino area). I’m super lucky that I was able to be there, both to have supervision and care in case of complications, and because although they live only about an hour away, they have very different weather conditions—crucially, their air is much more humid (closer to the ocean) and much less polluted than where I live (in a desert). If you have the option to recover somewhere with better air conditions, do. My ENT said the rate of post op bleeding and complications here in the Inland Empire is actually quite a bit higher than most other areas due to the dry and polluted conditions. I didn’t return home until almost the two week mark, and I felt a major difference right away.
* I stocked a few different foods and drinks pre-surgery so I’d have options on hand. I’ve learned from this subreddit and from my own experience that no two people will recover the same way, so if shopping in advance I encourage you to purchase small amounts of variety so you can experiment with what is doable for you.

**Surgery**

* I had my surgery at 7 a.m. on Feb 6. I was nervous, and also concerned about my insurance coverage being weird. Gotta love the U.S. healthcare system. More on that later.
* Pre-op was pretty much the worse part of the actual surgery experience. The nerves, the waiting, the uncertainty.
* The actual surgery was like the best nap I’d had in AGES lol. Felt like a deep, deep sleep. I dreamed and had no awareness whatsoever of falling asleep or anything going on during.
* I wasn’t sure what to expect after anesthesia, but I felt pretty much cognitively normal right after waking up. I was groggy, but I was aware of myself and my surroundings. Not loopy, or at risk of saying anything weird to my parents who were there to drive me home.
* On waking up I had some pain, maybe a 6 or 7, that was quickly remedied through my IV. I also woke up DETERMINED to start hydrating vigorously and drank multiple cups of ice water while still in my recovery bed. 
* My mom sat with me in recovery while my dad picked up my prescriptions. I was discharged before 10 a.m. and we headed home.

**Medications/Pain Management**

* My ENT typically has patients manage pain with OTC methods only (ibuprofen, tylenol). However, I did push for a narcotic in case I needed it and had an oxycodone prescription that could be taken alongside the OTC meds as needed.
* Ultimately I would have done fine without the narcotic. I was on a rotation of liquid ibuprofen and tylenol every three hours (around the clock—wake up for this!) and this managed the pain sufficiently most of the time. I stayed on this schedule for about nine or ten days and sometimes lessened my dosages if I felt alright doing so.
* The oxy did provide a lot of mental relief. The hardest part of recovery, for me, was the stress of anticipating unbearable pain. Knowing that I had a stronger resource for pain if I needed one gave me reassurance. 
* I ended up taking oxy three or four times on days 5/6 or 6/7. I don’t think it was necessary, but it did help me eat, relax, and get a good nap a couple of times. Unfortunately, turned out I seem to have a mild allergy, and it also gave me a rash on my cheeks and neck (like having beard stubble!) which was uncomfortable and further disincentivized it.

**Pain Experience**

* As mentioned above, I had some pain immediately post-op. 
* The worst pain I experienced throughout was a couple of my nighttime wakeups (1 a.m.) in the last half hour or so before my next dose of meds. This was mostly in my ears, and although it got to an 8 or 9, it was temporary. I was able to stay calm. On the nights I took an oxy before bed, I’d say the pain still got up to a 6 or 7, but that’s still pretty helpful. Most of the time when I was resting/not using my throat, I was not in pain.
* Eating and talking were both cumulatively painful experiences, as in, they’d get more painful the more I did them. Small amounts at a time is best.
* I experienced little-to-no burning or stinging sensations when swallowing (none of the “battery acid” feelings described in some posts). My throat pain was more like the deeper aching feeling of a severe bruise. I did have some tongue pain towards the back, maybe from whatever clamps they use to keep it out of the way?
* I was definitely very uncomfortable. My throat felt still and fused. No way around it, you’re going to be uncomfortable at best with all the swelling and stiffness of such a vulnerable area of the body.
* I didn’t experience any nausea or vomiting. I was consistent about food during the day, as I’ll write about below, which probably helped.

**Hydration/Liquids**

* There’s a reason every single post you see emphasizes hydration. Drink the absolute most that you can. I was drinking at least a gallon of water a day. No matter how much it hurts to swallow, it’s going to hurt a LOT more to be dehydrated.
* I had several packs of electrolyte mix on hand in case drinking felt extremely painful. I didn’t end up needing them, but thinking in terms of hydration boosters is a good idea.
* My general rule was to \*always\* drink deeply when taking meds every three hours, and as much as I could in between. 
* Any time I felt any sensation in my throat, I drank water. There were multiple points I felt an intense itch in my throat and drank quite frantically to avoid coughing (sneezing too!). This worked well.
* I also had different juices and other drinks on hand in case I could only get calories that way, but I did alright eating (more on that next).
* I liked ice water the first few days, then cool water felt better (around the time my scabs started disintegrating, probably?). Warm temps were tolerable the whole time. I didn’t really enjoy cold, like popsicles and ice creams, but they weren’t necessarily painful, just less comfortable.
* A popular post in this sub recommends fortified non-dairy milk—personally, that was still way too creamy for me in the first days and caused thick mucus production just like dairy would’ve.

**Nutrition/Foods**

* Eating was more uncomfortable/painful for me than drinking water. However, I think it was essential to my recovery. Push nutrition as much as you can according to your pain levels. I tried to time eating something small about 30m to an hour after each dose of meds during the day. You’ll be hungry a lot. Do as much as you can.
* Day of surgery, I drank a lot of liquids for calories during the day. Water, juice, the ill-fated plant milk mentioned above. Before bed, I had a little bit of very well-pureed lentil + veggie soup. I tried some soft bread and found the texture too alarming on my throat.
* For the first 2-3 days after surgery, I had soft scrambled eggs (a la Gordon Ramsey, done in lots of butter, but without milk), mashed avocado, and that same lentil vegetable soup puree which I thinned to my preferred consistency with broth and pumpkin puree. Also some jello. Dairy/creamy foods were a no-go.
* After a few days (three or four days post op), I tried introducing some dairy items and did okay. So I was able to add pudding and ice cream, as well as cheese on my eggs. Crucially, I also was able to eat soft pasta. I highly recommend pastina! Teensy shapes were much easier to swallow and less chewing meant I didn’t wear out as fast. I started making mac and cheese-esque pasta, but I simmered the pasta in broth for extra nutrients, and added some pumpkin puree for extra fiber as well.
* I did NOT like mashed potatoes, which was a bummer. They were way too sticky/textured on my scabs. I did mix a little at a time into my soups which was more doable.
* Around days six or seven I had an absolute breakthrough with oxy and Ritz Crackers. The oxy gave me more stamina to eat for a longer period of time. The Ritz Crackers gave me the satisfaction of something crunchy, but melted completely in my mouth to be easy to swallow. I ate until I felt \*full\* which was… ecstasy. So good. Around that same time I also started eating canned fish with mayo (on crackers or rice), and frozen pot pies. It took a while, but it felt nice to chew something and eat more balanced foods. Protein felt really good in the body.
* I avoided acidic foods (tomatoes, coffee, citrus, vinegars) for the first ten-eleven days. However, when I did start eating them, I didn’t have any adverse effects or increased pain. I’m still not pushing it on spicy foods just to reduce inflammation.
* I ate a giant chile relleno plate at a Mexican restaurant on day 12. This was also my first outing after surgery. It took me a while and was tiring for my jaw and throat muscles, but it was very yummy.
* I’m still not eating chips, nuts, crackers, etc. by choice. I don’t experience pain when I swallow, but it’s tiring. I have enough variety again that I don’t feel I need these crunchy/sharp foods again yet. Doctor also mentioned that they think in terms of 6-8 weeks to feel completely back to normal when yawning, swallowing, etc. so in that context, I’m still quite early in recovery even though I feel like I’m past most of it.

**Supplies**

* I used microwave bean bags for a warmth source on my ears and neck. I don’t know if this actively reduced pain, but it was comforting. I liked it and preferred it. I didn’t try ice packs, personally. I get sad when I’m cold in general, and eating really cold foods like popsicles was more uncomfortable than relieving.
* HUMIDIFIER! I have an old Vick’s cool mist humidifier that I bought years ago on Facebook marketplace for my houseplants. I just use tap water to fill it, and actually sleep with it on at home normally since it’s dry where I live. During the first week+ of recovery I kept it running on high next to me at all times.
* I found I mostly breathed through my nose naturally at night, but I did tape my mouth with masking tape a couple of times just for backup. It was a little annoying to take it on and off so often for meds and water, though. Keeping your throat moist overnight is a huge help. Do whatever you can to make that happen.

**Sleeping**

* I slept in a seated position in bed the first week. Week two, I was in more of a slump position (removed some cushion). Week three, I’ve been fine on one or two pillows. The elevation isn’t super comfortable for getting rest, but it’s great for breathing and swelling. I’m glad I did it.
* Sleep isn’t great for the first several days but the disruptions for water and medicine are 100% worth it. Stay on top of your hydration and your pain.
* My pain peaked at night, as I’ve mentioned. I don’t know why. May be from not being quite as hydrated as I was during the day, or because the immune system is often more active in sleep so there might’ve been increased blood flow and sensation in the area.
* It was also a little bit lonely sometimes to be awake so much in the middle of the night.
* I didn’t drink any caffeinated beverages for the first two weeks. Just a personal preference since I wanted to get better rest, and also felt like coffee might acidic.
* I took short afternoon naps on some of the early days.

**Hygiene**

* I didn’t realize showering was controversial! I showered every other day for the first week and lived in the same set of soft PJs/warm socks in between showers. It felt good to be clean but was tiring to stand and scrub at first.
* I was able to open my mouth enough to use my regular electric toothbrush to brush my teeth and tongue twice a day (morning and before bed), and swish gently with water. I could open wide enough to floss again after the first week. I still haven’t started using mouthwash again though. I’m sure it’s fine, but the idea of gargling makes me nervous so I’m giving it a bit more time.
* I didn’t have any constipation, so I didn’t need a stool softener. Maybe I would’ve if I’d taken the oxy more regularly, though. To share very freely, I actually had very… pliable? stool for the first several days. Like squeezing a tube of toothpaste. :) All that food went in soft, and it came out soft too!

**Passing Time/Going Back to Work**

* I read a couple of books early on. Watched some TV on my computer in bed.
* I was bored a lot.
* I had one week off work. I absolutely would have taken more time off if I could have to get more rest, but I did okay going back when I did (I work remote and have minimal speaking responsibilities).

**Energy Exercise**

* I definitely turned a corner around day 8 or 9—woke up feeling much closer to myself, but still far from normal. I started going for verrryyyy short, slow walks (5 min) then worked up to 10-15-20 or so minutes. That’s still about where I’m at.
* People aren’t kidding around: even if your pain is minimal, this is a long-haul recovery. I’m normally very active. Although I’ve been feeling antsy from so much rest, my body makes me pay when I push it. I took my cousin’s dog out for a one mile walk/jog earlier this week (day 18? 19?) and the day after I was WIPED. 
* I had my post-op checkup on day 13 and the PA thought at least another week before vigorous exercise. I’m at that point, but I think it’s still going to be at least another week before I actually have the energy, as much as I’ve been looking forward to resuming my normal exercise routines. 
* I have been going to yin yoga since the end of week 2 which feels great. So good to get those deep stretches when spending so much sedentary time and I strongly recommend paying some extra attention to your body if you can.
* I don’t know if I’ve lost or gained weight. I don’t weigh myself.

**Sensory Experience/Misc**

* I had a lot of really thick saliva for the first several days. I did my best to swallow it so I wouldn’t lose those fluids my body worked hard to make, but swallowing was much easier when I did so with water.
* My saliva was also very sour! It wasn’t gross tasting, just weirdly tart no matter what I ate or drank. 
* I had a little bit of unpleasant taste/breath on waking up in the morning but it wasn’t awful.
* I could talk a little bit on the day of surgery. For the next five or six days after that it was really uncomfortable or painful to articulate words so I didn’t talk. Talking was still pretty tiring during week two, but not painful. Week three has been pretty good.
* I didn’t experience my scabs “falling off.” There wasn’t any major corner turned in terms of sensation, I didn’t spit anything up, etc. I assume they dissolved off as other people’s did.
* I chose not to look at my throat during recovery. I think seeing it would’ve made me feel worse or frightened. Even now, I’ve only looked at it a few times. I know I still had some scabbing present at my post-op appointment on day 13.
* If you need to burp, burp out your mouth. Just make it a big exhale. Divert pressure from all those soft, healing tissues. If you have to sneeze or cough, DON’T lol. Drink a shit ton of water until the urge passes. (I am sneezing again now but I try to sneeze out my mouth in a big exhale as well. It feels very weird and bad to sneeze as I normally would. Coughing and throat clearing has been fine this week.)

**Cost**

* I have an Aetna insurance plan. While billing isn’t finalized yet, it looks like my final out of pocket costs for the surgery will be around $1,600. 

**Final Thoughts**

* Use this subreddit to prepare yourself, not to scare yourself. Having a surgery is inherently stressful, especially one with such a notoriously painful and unpredictable recovery. You can’t know what your experience will be, so some surrendering is required. I think I was so mentally prepared for the worst (out of control, unbearable pain) that it made my actual experience very bearable (major discomfort, dull and occasionally intense pain). But if you’re here doomscrolling, it’s really okay take a step back. Information is only helpful if it’s helpful, not if it’s frightening, and ultimately your experience will be your own.
* I found mindfulness extremely helpful. I remember being half-asleep in the car on the drive home, thinking “my only responsibility right now and for the foreseeable future is to the pain I’m feeling. To be in my body, rest, and heal as best as I can.” I had similar thoughts when the pain did get bad. Acceptance and release. 
* It was also helpful, in those especially painful moments, to separate myself a little bit—to think of myself as sitting in a different room from the pain, somewhere quiet and dark, while the pain did its work outside/elsewhere. (If any of you have read Ian McEwan’s Atonement, he describes a woman managing an intense migraine that way and I’ve found it to be a really compelling visualization!)
* Rest, hydrate, and do your best to feed yourself. You’ll be okay.",1,1740702113.0,Tonsillectomy,0,0.67,False

# Ingredients

* 19g Sodium Carbonate
* 6g Vitamin C
* 14g Instant Coffee
* 350ml water

# Process

1. Mix the 19g of Sodium Carbonate with enough water to dissolve.
2. To that mixture, add the 6g Vitamin C, and dissolve. 
3. To that mixture, add the 14g Instant Coffee, and dissolve.
4. Top off with water to get 350ml total solution.
5. Make sure all ingredients are dissolved, and give it around 5 minutes for most bubbles to dissipate.
6. Use within 30 minutes of mixing. Use once for best results. 
7. Experiment with times, but I've had great results developing for 10 minutes at 20°C.

# Notes

I use an AGO rotary film processor and I love its time/temperature monitoring. It has given me excellent results with this Caffenol recipe. I've used this recipe with Fomapan 100 (at ISO100), Svema MZ3 ISO3 (at ISO6), and AristaEDU 100 (at ISO100) and enjoy the results.

The photo of the power lines above was developed in early 2025 with this Caffenol recipe. It was shot on Fomapan 100 and a Yellow filter.

The gas station above was shot on Svema MZ3, which is an ISO3 (yes, three!) film I metered at ISO6. I developed it with my Caffenol recipe. I love the glowly look of the stock, which I also achieved by shooting at f/2.

1izuocl,https://www.reddit.com/r/mentalhealth/comments/1izuocl/im_not_enough_because_im_too_much/,I'm not enough because I'm too much,"Hi everyone, I came here to ask for help because I'm at my wit's end. For context - I have been diagnosed with generalised anxiety disorder and depression, as well as severe combined ADHD and giftedness. Also English isn't my mother tongue, so I apologise in advance for any typos or mistakes.

For half a year now I've been trying my hardest to make friends at uni, since I lost my support system all of a sudden in Feb 2024 and the loneliness was unbearable. Since Sept 2024 I've been attending in-person classes from Monday to Friday, and I have done my best to foresee and try to avoid common socially awkward mistakes I know I'm prone to - I always ask people if they are comfortable with (& have the time to) listen to my venting, I try to always say ""thank you"" after people do anything for me, I try to highlight stuff I admire or love about the people around me. Since I'm also a bit of a magpie, I quite enjoy gifting people little trinkets, either handmade (eg epoxy resin stuff I made) or small tokens (from pinecones and cool looking rocks to a bookmark). And I try to make sure to support people if they're struggling, ie by asking them how it's going or by trying to do an act of service such as bringing them a warm cup of coffee. These are all things that take some degree of effort due to the severe executive dysfunction, and since I know I sometimes talk too much or blurt stuff out, as soon as I realise I might have done it said something that might come across as rude I reach out to apologise.

What makes me grow more  anxious with every passing day is the fact that I cannot seem to ever do things right, and I can't ever be enough because I'm too much and always mess up. For example, it doesn't matter that I try to ask people if it's alright for me to tell them about X topic, because although they'll say yes and offer their feedback, as it turns out they would like less of me chatting about what I need help with, but they will only tell me once I've specifically and explicitly asked them about it. And it doesn't matter that I do bring people tokens and try to do acts of service, or to cheer them up when they're struggling and help them in any way I can, because then when I ask it turns out that none of that counts because I'm just not doing good enough. I should share more positive achievements (which I don't say because I almost never achieve anything), and it's like what I do get right is never mentioned or even valued. Or, if I feel like an interaction felt off and reach out to apologise,, I find out that people are mad it took me half a day to bring it up and that they don't believe I'm genuinely trying to make things right.

When I say something and someone replies in a way that makes me think I didn't explain myself well enough, because they are replying to something I'm not talking about, I get snapped at and then when I ask I'm told I was condescending when I said that maybe I didn't explain it well enough. And I only get told that people have been annoyed at some stuff I do or say after I ask specifically. People don't point out whether something is bugging them, but then they blow up with criticism when I ask in an attempt to understand how to accommodate their needs.

It feels like I will never have any true friends that will stick around, and I just wanna know how to do better or learn how to get better at not being a pain? It's causing me severe anxiety and sadness, and I'm also just so tired of failing ",1,1740701668.0,mentalhealth,0,1.0,False

1izumhi,https://www.reddit.com/r/ParallelUniverse/comments/1izumhi/i_feel_like_im_in_a_different_timeline/,I feel like I’m in a different timeline,"I’m assuming this is the right place to post this. 

None of what I’m feeling is intentional. I say that meaning that in the past I have said things with intention about “waking up in my highest timeline” etc but it’s not really a rabbit hole I’ve jumped down that far. For me it’s more about being mindful and intentional about my energy & thoughts to bring my frequency to its highest place. 

Today I woke up and felt like I was almost hung over. I haven’t had a drink in over a week… I just brushed it off as maybe I needed a day of rest. 

Everything that’s happened today has felt excruciatingly difficult. Like there’s resistance in every thought, text message, conversation and just general actions. Now this isn’t incredibly uncommon for me to feel, but it is without reason…

I knew I needed to get out of the house and try to jolt myself out of whatever this feeling was. I remember thinking how quiet it felt today before I left the house. Not in a less noisy kind of way. The world just felt muted.

I eventually got out of the house to go make a bank deposit and walk my dog, I immediately noticed the outside world felt eerily…off. The blocks I always walked looked and felt different. It felt as if I went back 30-40 years in time. I started noticing that there were no vehicles parked or driving that were from this decade. I couldn’t believe it, as I live in a very big city (one of the biggest)

I decided I needed a pick-me-up to pull my head out of the fog. I typically only drink coffee and haven’t had a Yerba Mate in quite sometime, so decided that’s what I would do. Walk an extra block with my dog and grab a beverage at a market. Each market I went into had no Yerba Mate options- it didn’t phase me. Sometimes places don’t carry them. I went into a brand new state of the art market- sans Yerba. I kept on until I was about 1.5 miles from my house. I went into 6 markets without finding it. Each market had typical things, I really wasn’t thinking of taking notice but as I think back they had the basics. Monsters, Red Bull, Gatorade. Nothing current. 

The entire walk I kept looking at cars, and still had yet to find one that looked newer than maybe a 2010/2012. The houses looked different. The shops looked different. The sky felt different. The energy and frequency felt MUCH lower- almost gray or cloudy. Just darker. 

I had interactions with other dog owners and dogs and it seemed normal enough 

Can somebody please give me some sort of explanation for wtf is happening.

I’d also like to add that the other day at work I had a strange interaction. I met a woman I KNOW that I have met before. I assumed she was just a previous customer & she merely looked familiar because of that. I have this feeling a lot at my new job- I recently moved to a really big city a year ago and know nobody here. I don’t go out enough to meet people that I would forget about. But this interaction was different- she asked my name & I asked hers in return and she kind of cocked her head and smiled. So I told her she looked so familiar to me, and she said it’s insane bc she was telling the person she’s with the same about me. She’s new to the city from a very far off place- we’re in completely different fields and have no way of ever having crossed paths. But I knew what her smile looked like before she even smiled. I know that I knew her. I have this same feeling (not quite as strongly) with others in my new city. It’s not a feeling I’ve had. It’s like I’ve known them in another life.

I was never an extroverted person , but I had no difficulty being around lots of people or doing anything in public. At the beginning of 2024 I started developing some kind of fear/anxiety. For some reason whenever I got to a restaurant with my friends to eat , I couldn't eat . I thought it was just a one time issue but it persisted . I can eat outside alone, I can eat in a non crowded restaurant whenever I am just with myself or anywhere else but when I am with people , I just can't get the food down my throat. Even if its just a little piece of fries or anything, I can't eat with my friends around.

Another issue also appeared , sometimes when I am grocery shopping I feel shortness of breath and I feel mild heart pain , like im in some kinda fight or flight mode even tho there is no danger anywhere. For a while I thought this second issue was caused by consuming lots of caffeine , when I stopped drinking coffee completely, this issue subsided but its not 100% gone and some days it still appears.

I have no idea what caused this but it makes me feel bad that I can not have a good time with my friends and eating together because they think I don't wanna eat with them but I honestly just can't and I have no idea what triggered this for me.

I’ve been thinking about my experience and I thought I’d share my thoughts with you, in case it helps anyone deciding on going Concierge.  

Best Features - 

1. Embarkation and Disembarkation - Leaving the ship was a breeze! In 1923, we had breakfast at 6:45 am and were promptly whisked off the ship, skipping the line. After chatting with the concierge team, we discovered that we could leave our bags in the cabin and grab a bite and our bags as long as we were out by 8:00 am. So, we had a quick, yet relaxed breakfast and then strolled off the boat. If looks could kill, the folks lined up waiting since 5:30 am to get off the boat were a sight to behold! I had no idea leaving the ship was such a marathon for non-concierge passengers, so I was quite surprised. But hey, we’re glad we got off quickly! 

2. The concierge team went above and beyond our expectations. They were much better than the VIP tours at Disney World or Disneyland. They remembered our family members’ names and offered new recommendations. They even worked wonders! I had originally scheduled Palo for a birthday dinner on the night of our Arundel dinner, but they quickly rectified the mistake. My main server advised me to skip pirate night and instead watch Frozen, which was the best decision ever. After dinner, I spoke to the concierge team, and they made a call to fix the reservation instantly. They also arranged haircuts and nail appointments the day before, which was a fantastic touch. 

3. The lounge was a great place to relax and unwind after a long day of exploring. It was spacious and well-lit, with plenty of seating options for everyone. The food was delicious and varied, and there was always something to satisfy any craving. And let me tell you, they put something special in their waffles and drinks! They even offered allergy-friendly options if you ordered the night before. 

4. The staterooms were beautiful and spacious, with high-quality linens and top-notch stateroom staff. The stocked mini fridge was a nice touch! 

5. Early access to the shows was a fantastic benefit. Upon arrival, the concierge team greets you by name on deck two and offers complimentary popcorn and drinks. This allows you to select the best seats in the theater. Additionally, popcorn is available in the lounge, and you can take it to the Neverland and Wonderland theaters during your movie. 

Overall, We had an amazing time on the cruise! It was our first time, so I’m definitely up for exploring more. But if you can afford it, I highly recommend using the concierge service. It’s a game-changer! Sure, it might mean the next cruise is a few years away to save up, but it’s totally worth it. The concierge lounge is such a great place to relax and unwind. You can go anywhere on the ship, but if you just want to listen to music, read a book, or grab a cup of tea or coffee, the concierge lounge is the perfect spot. Highly recommend for a big life events like weddings, mile-stone birthdays or anniversaries. 


Complaints - truly non. If I was knit picking I would say the cost (obviously - omg these prices are truly eye watering). The only other complaint was the lack of knowledge with the boats wifi system. It is truly awful. They did their best but geez that WiFi sign up experience is truly bad. Yes, I know we don’t need WiFi on a trip, but I needed music to relax so yeah. Lesson learned on that one! Download in the future.

*Thud.*

An empty bottle of Prosecco slid from her grip and landed on the faded linoleum. It wobbled back and forth on its bloodied rim, painting a wet kiss on the floor before settling into stillness. A voice cried out and fell silent.

The sounds that followed were purely mechanical. There was the soft buzz of an old CRT TV, nestled in the far corner of the living room where air hung thick with scent of sweat, booze, and warm electronics. A familiar 8-bit melody emanated from the speakers, its notes reverberating faintly through the thin plaster walls like distant church bells. On the screen, an early ‘90s side-scroller was having a seizure—tiny sprites danced and weaved like insects caught in a fever dream. Sonic, Mario… didn’t matter. To Ms. Katsuragi, all those games looked the same—especially with a glass or two clouding her view—and on this particular day, she’d had more than a few.

Only two figures were standing in the room at the time, facing each other like a pair of brawlers frozen mid-fight. The taller one belonged to Misato Katsuragi. A woman on the cusp of thirty: defiant, childfree. Thick purple locks spilled shamelessly over her shoulders in greasy wet clumps caked with smoke and ample loads of hairspray. Her slender figure, in turn, threw a proud middle finger to the gallons of booze she had guzzled during endless back alley bar crawls.

This was the woman who could become a major one day. By the end of the year if she played her cards right. *Major Katsuragi.* The words rolled off her tongue like honey. But playing your cards right was a tall order for someone with three DUIs and kidneys so battered they looked like a pair of old boxing gloves stuffed in the back of a musty locker. Bastards hurt, too. Especially on days she had too much salt on her fries.

Tonight, however, Misato’s own health was the least of her concerns. It was *the boy* that worried her. The same skinny twig of a kid standing right before her, just an arm’s length away. So close she could reach out and poke him. Perhaps she already had. Perhaps she had done just that…

Shinji. Shinji Ikari. Fourteen. Somehow this boy turned out to be humanity’s last hope against the Angels (don't ask), with *Misato Katsuragi*, the alcoholic, assigned as his sole guardian for the duration of his training.

Shinji wore a white button-down, tucked neatly into a pair of loose black slacks, looking like a young Mormon missionary ready for pilgrimage. Except there would be no Sunday school for Shinji. Not for a while—not for a really long time. Not after tonight…

The boy’s hand was glued to the side of his head, his nervous fingers gently massaging the hair behind his temples—the exact place where the bottle had struck. No. Where *she* had struck him just seconds ago.

*Wham!*

When it hit, green sparks filled his eyes like Christmas lights. His hand flew to his ear to check if it was still there. Yet all Shinji felt was his jet-black hair, slick to the touch, like someone had doused it in motor oil. Didn’t even sting at first.

*Maybe it’s the champagne?*

Once the initial spike of cortisol had waned, searing pain began to radiate across his face. Spreading slowly, like poison spreads. Shinji’s mind flashed back to the day after soccer practice when his friend Toji’s fist had smacked him square in the mouth. That fist had felt like kiss on the lips compared to this, which was more akin to having a firecracker go off inside your ear canal. Were he to gaze into a mirror, he’d expect to see a pink swollen mug staring right back at him—a huge, ripe tomato ready to burst.

*Shouldn’t have skipped all that dodgeball practice*, Shinji thought as his fingers traced gingerly along the outer rim of his earlobe, which by now had swollen to the respectable size of a fleshy puffball and felt numb to the touch.

*Shouldn’t have mentioned Kaji*. An invisible beast gnawed at his temple, raking its grubby claws against the walls of his skull, trying to dig its way out.

Shinji and Misato had their share of spats before, predominantly garden-variety bullshit. Like Shinji leaving droplets of piss on the toilet seat: a cold, wet surprise for her bare ass in the morning. Or that hot summer day Misato found her beer cans cooking on the windowsill—the kid had to free the fridge for Rice Krispies. She wasn’t too mad, though she had him down a daily plate of sloppy oat gruel for an entire month following the incident. *No Yebisu for me, no sugar lumps for you. We’re even, Steven.*

Even then, punishments never went beyond a gentle dose of lighthearted discipline. The closest Misato ever came to raising a hand was playfully tugging his ear once she caught him peeping muted pay-per-view channels at three in the morning. Wouldn’t stop teasing him about it for weeks.

That was then.

Shinji parted his lips to speak when sudden, glassy pain lit up his jaw like a jukebox. He winced, snapped his mouth shut, and let it subside. The pain was shocking. The realization even more so. Never in his life had he encountered such unbridled savagery before. A loving mother would sooner douse herself in gasoline and strike a match than hurt her own child. But to Misato—mother of none—no such rules applied. She had whipped that bottle through the air with primal ferocity, and Shinji, being Shinji, just stood there and took it.

He pressed his palm harder against the wound, as if trying to stem a burst pipe. A thin line, sharp and solid as a red cord, managed to escape, snaking its way down his wrist and tracing along his arm. Misato’s eyes shot open like startled owl’s, pupils dilating to bring in more light as she watched Shinji’s lifeblood collect in a dark, glistening bead on his elbow. It swelled larger and larger still until…

*Plok.*  
A single red teardrop landed on the grime-encrusted linoleum.

Plok.  
Then another.

*Plok, plok!*  
A third, and a fourth.

The light taps echoed through the room, Misato’s heart skipping a beat after every single one. The sound sent her back to her aunt’s vintage bathroom, the steady *drip-drip-drip* from the faucet amplified by the moldy tiles with their dank, musty smell—that pungent mix of dead water, rotting wood, and the sickly-sweet odor of mildew that clung to every surface. The kind of smell that made you want to hold your breath. The kind that seemed to coat your tongue and linger in your nostrils long after you’d left the room. She could taste it now, her breath caught in her throat as it dawned on her that tonight was no mere leak. Tonight it poured—not from the sky, but from Shinji. And within a few minutes the entire floor around his feet was covered in rubies.

Shinji’s brown eyes darted to the speckled floor below, then to his own shirt. There were stains. Dark ones. Like blots of ink on white paper.

*Wait.* *Champagne isn’t red.*

The boy’s lungs seized up. Short, ragged gasps. His face, already pale, drained of what little color remained. His body swayed slightly, one hand clutching his head, the other pressed against his hip as if trying to hold himself together. Across the room, Misato stood frozen, mouthing soundlessly like a goldfish out of water.

Their eyes met. There was that instant of heat, like a power surge when all the needles swing into overload. If Shinji’s eyes could speak, they’d scream: “I trusted you.” But when he finally managed to crack his jaws open, all she heard was a measly: “Why?”

Misato jerked forward, hand snapping to her mouth as bile rose up in her throat. On her shoulder, the yellow NERV badge cast occasional glints of light against the walls. One such light caught the boy’s eye, another one hit the window and reflected back at her. A bead of sweat trailed down the small of her back. It was at that moment when the fog of booze was washed away and chilling clarity took place. *What have I done?*

No longer was she stumbling through the neon-lit alleys of Shinjuku, where streets reeked of rats, rice, and venereal disease. No longer was she rebuffing the lecherous advances of drunken salarymen outside seedy Pachinko parlors. No, this was home. This was real. And it wasn’t some washed-up barfly gawking at her with bloodshot eyes and teeth stained with whiskey. It was Shinji Ikari—the pilot, the ward, the boy whose skull she had cracked like an empty bottle of convenience store vodka dropped on the sidewalk.

*Oh no. Oh dear God no.* Misato clenched her eyes as tightly as she could, then forced them open again, expecting to wake up in some parallel universe—a universe where she finds herself knocked out next to the washing machine, covered in puke, passing kidney stones in the early hours of the morning. She’d give anything to be bathing in her own filth right now. *Anything over this.*

But as she opened her eyes, nothing had changed—except for the floor that had grown ever more spotty, and Shinji, who had grown ever more pale. Misato thought he looked like a boy turned stone, frozen in place as he gazed into the eyes of an ancient monster. The same monster who, for the last nine months, had been burning his toast, washing his tees, and sniffing his briefs after cleaning.

The boy spoke again. “I… don’t understand.”

That feeble voice—an icepick through her gut. *Fuck.* Was this kid genetically engineered to be this heart-wrenchingly pitiful? Was this what torture felt like? *I’m sorry, “enhanced interrogation”*. Was this what the huntsman felt when he emptied a buckshot into the rustling leaves nearby, only to realize seconds after that it wasn’t the deer hiding in the bushes, but his very own son?

Amidst the chaos of her thoughts, among the flurry of what ifs and what nows, a colder, more calculating part of her brain kicked in, starting to ask questions of more practical nature:

*Will he talk? Will he tell?*  
*Will I get fired? Will I go to jail?*  
*Will he… will he… will he liv—*

He moved. Took the first step towards her. Heavy. Sluggish. A step of a phlegmatic zombie in a low-budget horror. With his face spectral white and bloodied hand seemingly sewn to his temple, he sure could’ve auditioned for one. His eyes, however, were alive and there was a hint of danger in them.

After what felt like wading through quicksand, Shinji finally came to a standstill—face-to-face with the woman who was not his mother. They were so close she could taste the Juicy Fruit bubblegum on his breath as he exhaled a soft sigh of disappointment. His gaze, no longer vacant, now drilled through her, signaling telepathically it was her turn to speak.

*Explain yourself… Now.*

Misato was about to spew an apology, but her throat constricted, words cut off as if amputated by a scalpel. Apology wasn’t enough. How about a deal? A brand new video game every day of the week for three months straight—no, forever. As long as this remains between them that is. *Goddam, bribing a kid, seriously? Misato, you rotten piece of garbage.*

“Shinji, I—”

Misato’s hands reached out for him. Part of her expected the boy to recoil from her touch as if she were a venomous snake. Instead, he reached back, his blood-slicked fingers intertwining with her trembling ones. Now they both looked like a pair of kids who’d done finger paints.

“It’s okay,” he said in a voice that was hardly there. “It’s gonna be alright.”

Will it though?

That’s when Shinji’s world began to whirl and rotate like a centrifuge in outer space, the edges of his vision blurring in and out of focus in slow, woozy cycles. An odd sense of lightness filled his limbs. For a moment, he thought he’d ascend from the ground and simply float away, pass right through the ceiling, drift through the drywall and transcend the room above. Rising higher and higher up into the sky like a mylar balloon aiming for moon, passing through the cables and the powerlines, soaring beyond the rooftops and the satellites, above the neon signs and the window lights, further and further away from that wicked place where crime took place, until the entire city of Tokyo-3 had shrunk to the size of a tiny white bead below his feet, while above him lay an endless veil of black velvet studded with a billion stars. “Come and surrender,” it said. Surrender to the vast windless sky as it shifts its cosmic hue from faded blue denim to the purple-black of a festering womb.

Shinji took a deep breath. The smell of ozone filled his lungs. Was this the smell of heaven? The buzzing in his ears—was it the angels calling?

But he couldn’t join them. Not quite yet. Not before the new Mortal Kombat comes out—the one with real blood and guts, where you can rip out spines and stuff. Not before… not before he gets his first kiss, too. Besides, he already had a fallen angel at home: a celestial alcoholic named Misato Katsuragi, courtesy of NERV. She had her bad days, but she’ll fix it. Like she always does. Shinji was sure of it.

*Stop!*

Shinji’s grip tightened around Misato’s fingers with unnatural force, crushing them until he almost broke her pinky. Her body jerked back in a painful spasm, yet his grip held on and clamped down even harder. *Hold on, hold on tight, boy, for she is your last remaining lifeline in this dark world that follows.*

Misato looked down and froze. Shinji’s hands were gone, replaced with a pair of sharp iron hooks sinking slowly into the soft meat of her palms like hot pincers. A shrill scream shredded her throat as she fought against his grip. “Get off me.”

Misato tore herself free from Shinji, regretting it immediately. His hands were fine. The hooks were gone. But his shirt was soaked red and his shoulders—they swayed. Back and forth. Penduluming. Then his eyes rolled back and his entire body began to collapse in slow motion. Misato lunged forward, scooping him up by the armpits. They sank to the ground glued together. Her knees hit the floor first. Hard. A crack echoed through the room. Not loud, but sharp and crisp like a dry branch snapping, followed by a stifled cry through clenched teeth. The bright, brilliant pain was instantly numbed by shot of adrenaline flooding her veins like jet fuel. To hell with the pain. Can’t let him bleed—won’t let him bleed.

Her hand latched onto his wound, long splayed fingers wrapping around his skull like a spider. Now she felt it, too—the oozy, slick surface of his scalp. His pulse throbbed against her palm. Each beat sending a fresh gush of blood that oozed between her fingers, warm like mother’s milk. A few droplets hit her thigh with light, hot licks.

*Shit. Probably nicked an artery.*

Misato’s mind flashed back to her NERV emergency training; the clinical, dry voice of that blonde bitch Ritsuko droning on about trauma management.

*Humans can typically lose around 15 percent of blood before the body starts experiencing signs of hypovolemia.* For a scrawny teenager like Shinji that was probably about two cans of soda, but Misato couldn’t be sure. About 20 percent of those classes she attended bored out of her mind.

*At 30 percent blood loss, the body’s compensatory mechanisms begin to fail. Organ damage sets in, and without a transfusion, death is imminent.*

She scanned the floor trying to gauge how much Shinji had already lost. *Too much.*

Her eyes fixed on the nearby sofa. A crumpled grey dishrag hung over the armrest. Shinji’s mess, no doubt.

*This will do.* Misato knew if she stopped the bleeding right-fucking-now, there was still a chance, slim as it may be, the kid might live to see a brand new Playstation under the Christmas tree.

Everything that happened next, happened fast, but to Shinji Ikari it all seemed slow; it all seemed to happen in a series of shutter-clicks, like a set of action panels in a Japanese manga.

In the first panel, Misato had her arm extended towards the sofa, snatching the dishrag by the corner. Her other hand cupped his head, pushing the boy’s face against her chest. Scent of Chanel No. 5 filled his nose.

In the second panel, she was wrapping the towel around his head like a turban with surgical agility. The fabric grew pregnant with blood, a soggy wet sponge between her fingers. *Don’t you bleed out on me, you little asshole. Please, God, let him stay with me…*

In the third panel, Misato had both ends of the dishrag in her hands, pulling them with psychotic strength, tightening the knot around Shinji’s skull ’til her knuckles went white.

Shinji made a sound.

That gave her hope. *Good. There’s still some fight left in him.*

Her other hand, now free from restraints, slid inside her jacket. Trembling, slick fingers were feeling around for the familiar shape of her sturdy old Nokia. The phone fumbled in her pocket, slipping from her grasp each time she was about to seize it. Taunting her.

“Goddamnit,” she hissed through gritted teeth. “Where the hell is it?”

A moment of struggle, and she had the phone planted firmly in her hand. Always kept it close to heart—could stop bullets, they said. Then they said it gives you cancer. *You take the rough with the smooth, I guess.*

Misato yanked it out, smearing Shinji’s blood across the keypad. But when the tiny screen came to life, her guts cramped up. *Battery Low*, it said, casting its yellow glow across her big, brown, desperate eyes. *Stupid piece of plastic.*

Misato held her breath. One heartbeat. Two. Three. The phone went beep—*I’m about to fall asleep.*

*Fuck. Better be quick.*

Her fingers moved on autopilot, muscle memory kicking in as she punched 119. But as she was about to make the call, her thumb froze and hovered over the button, as if held back by some invisible force.

*And what will you say?*

Liquor on her lips, benzodiazepine floating in her system, Shinji’s DNA on her feet. Sweet. Imagine explaining it to Gendo Ikari: *I got drunk as a skunk and fucked up your son. Patch him up or should Ritsuko clone you a new one?*

Misato pictured how an orange jumpsuit would match her purple hair, complementary colors and all. It’s not like she was unwilling to tell the truth. It’s that… truth was a fickle thing, twisting wildly with context and perspective. Perhaps crafting a narrative wasn’t so different from spinning a little white lie from time to time.

*They'll smell the booze, you know.*

Of course they will. And have her piss in a cup too. *But is it a crime to get blasted on Friday? Who at NERV doesn't?*

Her hand twitched, thumb almost hitting the call button. The boy coughed against her chest.

*And what, I can’t leave my damn house now? Am I a slave to be tied down 24/7? Can’t I pop a Xannie here and there to keep the angels out of my head? Got the prescription and all…*

She gnawed at her lips till they bled.

*His goddamn fault. I mean, Kaji? Why bring up Kaji? Christ, talk about twisting the knife.*

She had followed the rules, dammit. Shinji had his marching orders: lights out by midnight, no ruckus, no parties (as if), and hands off her medicine cabinet. She wasn’t his goddamn babysitter. Misato had her own life—a life she desperately wanted to share with that scruffy bastard Kaji. But instead of feeling Kaji’s stubble grazing on her lips, all she heard was Shinji’s stupid voice rattling in her skull like a bunch of loose iron bearings in a tin casket.

*Kaji stood you up.*  
*Kaji stood you up.*  
*Kaji stood you up. Again.*

Each repetition felt like getting punched in the face with a brick. “You had to rub it in, didn’t you?” Her arm tightened around the boy, not in love, but in anger. “And fuck you, too, Kaji.” At this point Misato’s eyes had the gleam of a genuine devil in them. She was about to hurl the phone across the room when a sharp voice cut through the fog of her mind like an arrow.

*Honey, you’re rationalizing.*

…

*That’s right. I am.*

Misato punched the call without hesitation.

The phone rang once, twice.

A click, then a calm female voice: “119, what’s your emergency?”

Misato’s mind wandered aimlessly—*God, she sounds fat*—before snapping back to focus. “Teenage boy. Fourteen. Suffered head trauma.”

*Suffered head trauma.* What an eloquent way to put it. So clinical, so sterile. As if it just… *happened*. As if some supernatural phenomenon had taken place, localized entirely within the confines of her living room.

“There’s blood everywhere. I’ve got it bandaged. Bleeding’s mostly stopped, but—” her voice cracked “—it’s bad.”

“What’s your location, ma’am?”

Misato rambled the address, stumbling over syllables. The operator pretended not to notice.

“Stay calm and don’t move him. Check his pulse for me, please. Do you know how to do that?”

Of course she knew how to do that. Misato wedged the phone between her ear and shoulder and pressed her index finger against Shinji’s throat where the jugular was. There was a slow, weak pulse.

“It’s faint,” Misato said, “but it’s there.”

“Okay. Now tell me what happened.”

Her guts went tight.

“Are you with me?”

A long exhale. “Yes.”

Misato could sense the operator’s suspicion through the phone. Rightly so. There were signs after all: slurred speech, awkward pauses, fumbling of the words. The lady’s voice sharpened. “Ma’am, have you been drinking?”

“Socially,” Misato said, then cringed immediately. *Shit. Wrong answer, idiot.* She could hear the operator’s sigh through the static.

“Let’s try again. What happened exactly?”

Misato wanted nothing more than to somersault out of the window and dive headfirst into the pavement.

“I came home and… found him.”

“Found him?”

“I found him p—”

The line went dead, and for one guilty moment Misato felt like a bomb had just been defused.

“Hello? Hello? Can you hear me?” she repeated like a mantra, knowing she was supposed to try.

The momentary relief gave way to disgust. Disgust at herself. For she had hoped, no, *prayed*, the phone would go dead… possibly sooner.

Misato’s eyes darted to her bag, where her charger lay coiled inside. She could get it, plug it in, call back… she should. But instead, she just sat there, hugging Shinji and stewing in shame and naive hope. Hope that somehow, miraculously, it would all work out in the end. *But how?* The more she searched for a happy ending, the more evasive it seemed.

The boy would talk. Of that, she was certain. If not willingly at first, then after a few injections of scopolamine at Ritsuko’s laboratory. Or perhaps a stern stare from Gendo would do it. He’d spill it all. Unless…

Misato looked at Shinji. He was in peace, lying unconscious in her arms, his chest rising and falling in a slow, steady rhythm. Her hand moved on its own, brushing his cheek with tenderness that surprised even her.

*Poor thing is in so much pain. Even if he lives, what kind of a life would it be? Crippled, traumatized. You deserve better than that, Shinji.*

Misato spread her long fingers before her, and for one wild second imagined how they’d look wrapped tightly around Shinji’s delicate little throat.

The boy’s eyes flashed open.  
“Mom!”

Misato recoiled, her intrusive thoughts gone.  
“Me?”

Even though his strength had waned and blood had drained from his face, she still saw trust in those eyes. But then there was a shift. His eyes drifted past her, locking onto an elusive spot in the distance—a good ten, maybe twelve feet behind her. His vacant stare stirred an urge in her to shake him, but instead she pinched his cheeks. Gently.

“Hey, look at me. Focus. Help is on the way.”

Shinji’s gaze remained fixed. His hand slipped from her shoulder, one gangly arm extending past her ear, pointing towards the empty kitchen doorway. Then his lips began to move as if uttering some ancient incantation. Misato brought her ear closer, feeling his breath run down the side of her neck as he spoke. Except Shinji wasn’t merely speaking—he was asking a question:

“Who’s the white lady?”

Misato felt like someone had just poured a paper cup full of ice cubes down the back of her jacket. She whipped her head around, eyes obsessively scanning the vacant space behind her. Nothing. No one.

“Shinji?” She tried to remain calm, but the quivering voice betrayed her. “There’s no one there.”

The linoleum beneath her felt cold and sticky, the spilled booze and blood forming a sick, coagulating cocktail that soaked her legs. Like gelatin.

The boy’s gaze didn’t waver, a faint smile tugging on his pale lips. “Beautiful,” he said. “Bright.”

“No, no, no, Shinji. You’re hallucinating, there’s nobody there.”

Her voice, when it came out, was trembling so badly she hardly recognized it as her own. Y*ou say that, but is that what you truly believe?* For it wasn’t the wind in the attic that sent that shiver down her spine, the one she felt bite all the way down to her bone marrow.

Misato began to be afraid. She sensed there was something terrible in that room, something worse than plague, fire, or earthquake. Something dark. Not bright. Something dark was in the room.

But all Shinji felt was peace for the first time as he sank deeper into that tight, motherly embrace. His body melted into hers, returning to that warm placental place where all life stems from. And as Misato’s locks fell upon his face, even the sour scent of beer on her breath was deeply comforting.

“Yes…” said Shinji, a wide smile spreading across his face, his long, inviting arm stretching into the distance. “Come closer.”

“No,” Misato’s voice cracked like a whip through the air; spittle flew in his eyes. “Shinji, look at me. Don’t look at her. Stay with me.”

Shinji’s head tilted upwards, tracking the footsteps of the invisible guest that slowly approached them. Terror gripped Misato, and she seized the boy like a drowning woman clutching a life preserver, squeezing him so tight she could hear his bones crack.

But she was no longer holding Shinji. In fact, she was no longer holding a human being at all. Shinji was gone, replaced by a child-sized doll that felt dry in her arms, as if all its bones had ossified. A boy made of straw with black buttons for eyes that kept staring into that blank nothingness with a stupid red grin on its face. A grin painted in lipstick.

That cold breeze again. From the back of her neck all the way down to the balls of her feet. Her heart wasn’t just pounding in her chest, it was vibrating. A drop of sweat trickled in her eye. It stung, but she didn’t blink.

Misato couldn't bring herself to look. She fought against it at first, but her head began to turn on its own.

*Oh, but you have to look, sweetheart. It’s your doing.*

Then, out of the corner of her eye, she saw—  
A howl tore from her throat. It was a rare sound: deep, primal, and completely inhuman. The kind of sound you hear only once or twice in a lifetime, coming from someone truly convinced they’ve just witnessed genuine, otherworldly horror.

After that, not much else happened in that room.

Misato had entered an odd state of hibernation. The pain in her knees had vanished, her legs and body numb. She felt she had merged with the floor and the walls. She wasn’t there at all. Untethered. A ghost in the ceiling, taking in the scene below, bathing in the muffled sounds of the city.

Sirens warbled in the distance. Neighbors scuttled above, footsteps creaking against the polished parquet. A toilet flushed. A washing machine hummed three stories below—right, the tariffs were cheaper at night.

*Who's the one hearing these sounds?*

…

*Who’s the one askin’?*

Sirens had stopped. A dog’s bark outside. Car engine idling. Heavy boots on concrete. Up the stairwell. A sharp ring at the door. Then a knock, urgent voices in the corridor. Three more rings in quick succession. Shouting. Pounding—once, twice. Then the splintering crack of wood giving way.

That’s when she blinked, becoming aware of her own body again. She gazed into the TV that had long gone black. In it, her own big, wide, bloodshot eyes reflected back at her. The boy cradled in her arms, her silver cross pendant pressed against his brow, glinting like a shard of ice. In a twisted way, it looked beautiful. An Impressionist painting you could hang in an art gallery, maybe even the Louvre.

That was the last image she saw before they took Shinji from her.

\*	\*	\*

One year had passed since the incident. Full moon drifted over the Baltic sea, and somewhere in Eastern Europe, a lonely woman couldn’t sleep. Instead, she was typing away tirelessly on her keyboard, the lone window of her office casting a single pinprick of light on the massive walls of a looming Stalinist tower.

Ms. Katsuragi hadn’t made Major that year, nor the next. But she hadn’t gotten fired either. Instead, she found herself thousands of miles away from Tokyo-3, relegated to a nondescript government office in a barely-functioning post-Soviet republic. Her new life revolved around filing Excel sheets, rubber-stamping requisition forms, and meeting the occasional attaché. She no longer needed the gun—at least according to NERV. The pilots were no longer her responsibility. Within weeks of the incident, they were quietly reassigned to Ritsuko Akagi under the pretext of a broader organizational shift. Misato had accepted these changes without protest, the same way she’d accepted Kaji’s increased absence from their staff meetings. His calls had ceased entirely.

The clock struck nine, and Misato had just deleted her last email for the day. She pushed the keyboard aside, propped her chin in her hands, and stared at the flickering screen before her. Her mind drifted back to that night.

She recalled how the paramedics rushed in, how they pried the boy from her arms, how they tried to revive him—and how they failed.

She recalled the questioning. Oh, there were questions. A whole ton of them. First from the emergency services, then the police, the investigators, all the way up to the heads of NERV and Gendo himself. To which she always replied with the truth. *Her truth.*

She’d tell them how she got home around midnight. Shinji should’ve been in bed—lights out by 11, that was the rule. But as she opened the door, she could hear his Nintendo still humming. She called his name with no answer, took off her shoes, then heard this strange sound coming from the living room. A groan.

She rushed to check, and there was Shinji. Lying crumpled on the floor with blood pooling around his head. *Dear God.* She grabbed a dishrag, stopped the bleeding, and called for help immediately. The boy had tripped—hit the coffee table. That’s what happened.

She held him close, waiting for help, and soon her own body began to reject this stark new reality—her vision swimming, stomach rolling, pressurized static filling her ears with rapid onset of early hypertension. She never heard the paramedics arrive until they were already inside.

At this point in her story, she’d always reach for a napkin. “I’m sorry,” she’d say, blowing her nose. “It’s just… too much.”

Investigators had their doubts. Her slurred answers, the dropped call, the silence that followed—none of it added up. Besides, she was under the influence and medicated to boot. And in the end, the boy was found in her arms. Didn’t exactly paint a “reliable witness.”

But her story checked out, on paper at least:

Security footage confirmed Misato’s arrival at 00:13—slumped against the wall of her apartment complex at Shibakoen 3-6-24, cigarette and bottle alternating like a metronome. Emergency records logged her call at 00:46, around the same time neighbors reported being awaken by a scream. The 33 minutes in between? What happened then was anyone’s guess.

Forensic investigators *did* find blood—among myriad other places—on the corner of the coffee table, which by then had dried to the color of dull maroon. That was enough to align with her story. The bottle, however, was never found. Nor mentioned.

And while hushed controversy swirled at her workplace, higher-ups at NERV, largely aided by Ritsuko, moved swiftly to quash any concerns. The official story from that day onward dismissed it as a freak accident. Operational security always came first, after all—they’d buried far worse.

*Let bygones be bygones.*

Misato got up from her seat, grabbed a pack of Winstons, and headed to the coffee machine by the window. Disjointed steps echoed through the empty corridor as her heels clacked unevenly against the chipped marble tiles. The knee had never fully healed, even after the surgery.

The coffee machine came alive. Beyond the glass, November sky shrouded the city like a quilt of smoke. In the distance, golden spires gleamed—Catholic, Orthodox.

*Opium for the people*, she laughed to herself, lighting a cigarette.

Suddenly, the window shuddered, and blasted wide open. Cold autumn air bit into her cheeks like battery acid. It made her feel alive, and in a really roundabout, convoluted sort of way, it made her feel less guilty.

Misato leaned out, craning her neck ’til it hurt. She stared down the massive walls adorned with hammers, sickles, and folk symbols she didn’t recognize. There were another ten stories below her. That’s what, a hundred feet give or take?

Wind whistled in her ears as if trying to speak.

*That’s a long way down.*

She dragged one final puff down to the filter, crushed the cig against the windowsill, and left it with others. For pigeons to feed on.

A janitor shuffled around the corner, mop sloshing. He greeted her in thick Russian accent. “Late night, tovarishch?”

Misato forced a smile. “Finishing up.”

The man’s breath reeked of cheap vodka. It made her stomach turn, and suddenly, like a switch being flipped, she was back there. That memory that haunted her nights. The one that surfaced even at the faintest whiff of alcohol, like clockwork. Just one single scene. Looping.

>!In it, her arms were tightening, not around a pillow, but a body. A small face pressed against her chest. Lullaby on her lips. Weak hands pushing against her—feebly at first, then frantic. Thrashing about. Coughing. A leg kicking her shin in violent electric convulsions. Then a spasm. A jerk. *Stillness.*!<

*Hiss.*

The coffee machine glared, steam curling.  
Misato stared down at her trembling hands.

1iztwfn,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1iztwfn,A follow up! Faded CRV plastics.,"I posted a couple weeks back about my faded CRV plastics and got a TON of responses. 

After tons of research, price checking, application etc etc. I went with the cheapest and easiest option, mostly as a baseline. 

I found myself at AutoZone getting a filler cap (for the crv) and decided to just try Mothers Back to Black. It was on sale for $8.99 so I figured why not. Took it to a DIY cleaner then brought it home to use. 

Initial impressions: on plastic as badly faded as mine, you have to use A LOT in areas that get direct sunlight. Flares and bumpers took 5-8 coats because they looked uniform ~90% perfect, which is all I'm really after currently. Other areas only needed a couple of coats. 

I must say, it looks damn good when it's all done. Doesn't look ""wet"" or greasy, just looks newer. I was a little worried about it being ""back to black"" when my plastics were never black, but grey, from the factory. But I'm very happy with the results. 

I'm keen to try other products that were recommended when this inevitably does fail, but hey, got me looking good for this cars and coffee for $9 and a couple hours of work. 

TLDR 8/10 (can change) first three pics are before. 

Pro: cheap, can get same day, impossible to mess up, smells good, looks great after application

Cons: have to use a lot on badly faded plastics, probably is not long lasting. ",5,1740699448.0,Detailing,3,1.0,False

Creating a vibrant living space often begins with the right home decor room decor choices that reflect your personality and style. When decorating a home, the goal is to strike a balance between aesthetics and functionality, allowing each room to tell a story while serving its intended purpose.

One popular approach to home decor room decor is the use of color palettes. Neutral tones can create a calming atmosphere, while bold colors add energy and excitement. Consider the emotional impact of colors—soft blues and greens are perfect for bedrooms, whereas bright oranges and yellows can invigorate kitchens and living areas. Incorporate accent pieces like cushions, throws, or artwork to tie your color scheme together seamlessly.

Textures also play a crucial role in transforming a space. Mixing materials such as wood, metal, and fabric adds depth and interest. A plush velvet sofa paired with a rustic wooden coffee table can create a striking contrast, enriching your home decor room decor. Don’t shy away from layering textures through rugs, curtains, and decorative items for a more inviting feel.

Lighting is another essential element in home decor room decor. Natural light can dramatically change the perception of space, so maximize it with strategically placed mirrors or sheer curtains. Supplement you decor with stylish lamps and fixtures to enhance the ambiance and create cozy nooks for relaxation or reading.

Incorporating personal elements, such as family photos or travel mementos, can truly elevate your home decor room decor. These small touches not only personalize your space but also spark conversations and create a warm atmosphere. Remember, each piece in your decor should resonate with who you are, making your home a true reflection of your unique identity.

1iztsl5,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1iztsl5,Patio Prayer,"Hi All You Gracious People:
We are first-time garden renters (my partner thinks I should clarify our rental home has a garden lol) and absolutely stumped about which design qualities will cause self-loathing (due to previous lack of consideration) after approx. 1-6 weeks of cohabitation. So before making any impulsive clicks, thought we’d check to see if you guys have any wisdom/input on current/proposed lineup. Will add some pics of the balcony (there is a hot tub you’ll see but the lease does not provision us to use it… we might ask landlord (seems like a nice guy) if he’ll let us once we prove to be trustworthy tenants) (we cover electric). Will also add pics/measurements of patio furniture thus acquired. Praying we haven’t failed already. (PS pics are not all great sorry but hopefully make sense) (PPS we are in coastal Northern California, so rain is very infrequently in the forecast from this time of year til about December-ish?) 

So, a key to the charts: 

1-3 are the *zones of desire*:
1 = chairs—just two for now 
2 = one patio recliner (partner loves outdoor reading)
3 = so, we haven’t been able to do much sculpture recently due to proper ventilation/space—we were hoping to fit in some extra storage space/surface somewhere on the patio. (See notes)

A-F are pieces already acquired (their location is marked in the pics of the backyard) (bad sry—hot tub looks like it is massive because of wide angle, but there’s probably at least 4’ of clearance to patio edge and 5-6’ to the neighbors gates 

A = steel dining table (almost exact measurements, (about .25 inches shorter and wider) but from FB  so a few dings) 

B = super cheap-o tripod table (had from camping) but looks pretty okay here for now—was going to get a solar lantern 

C = slide-top storage box working nicely as one side table for the weathered wooden bench (which came with the place—I don’t mind the patina as it matches the fence well, but the exact weathering is hard to match well online, which is why we’ve been leaning into black metal) 

D = another storage box for some bits and bobs stuff we don’t have room to store inside and isn’t weather-sensitive 

E = this hasn’t arrived yet, but my partner bought this metal rolling printer stand that won’t fit where we expected inside and will be low enough to not block the window sill, so maybe? 

F = another camping table we already had—same size as the other, just no hook. Was hoping to put this next to the  

PPS we have two cats who are Losing their MINDS being able to explore the outdoors free-range (contained and supervised).


Main chair considerations: 
- how much do you guys feel swivel feature matter? (I prefer the look of solid legs to earth but willing to resign on this vanity if cushions/metal chairs end up being heavy and there’s no pad/sliding solution)
-then just preference! 


Main chaise considerations:
-so, kind of torn between two ideas:
1. This poly one is super affordable and not bad looking (will be facing towards door so back isn’t exposed from LR), but the cushion I like (will attach too) is 24” wide :/
2. There’s also this metal one (which is a bit of a price hop but not insane and does look a lot nicer). However, when we held up a cream t-shirt and a sandy/beige one in the yard, the sandy color ends up looking pretty blah, and idk if the cushion would work on this metal frame because of the edges? This is probably main question—if the cushion could work on this chaise.  
3. Or look for different models altogether 


Main creative zone considerations:
-Landlord says it’s okay to use nails/screws, so we were maybe thinking about doing a narrow fence-mounted tabletop surface along the fence closer to the door. Not super visible in pics but this spot gets some interior obstruction from the wall and gives at least 5’? Or maybe something super simple and long along the wall behind the hot tub. We would be planning to do messier work out there and then move anything sensitive into the usable outdoor closet (the other is consumed by something large and electric lol) or inside. Or should we think about looking into some sort of top for the hot tub if we can’t/or it isn’t worth it to use it? Sculpture activities include very minor woodcraft (a bit of sanding, a bit of sawing), some clay (we were thinking about maybe looking for a kids’ recessed sensory play table for a coffee table by the bench lol), spray paint (we have a pop up tent being stored in one of the bins), some acrylic casting, etc. Y’all got any ideas? 
- Praying your creativity can help fill in here 

Sorry for the WALL of text We are just SO beyond excited and overwhelmed! Thanks for any thoughts, y’all!

I started working out and still barely get hungry. Just a slight headache but I really don't try to force myself to eat a lot. When I eat I eat. I currently weigh 250 (started at 256 a few days ago yes I know it's water weight.) and I mainly gained the weight due to BC and honestly my lifestyle because I don't have to move much to do my work.

I go on the treadmill now for at least an hr use the leg sculpt plus on it so it goes from 5.5 to 8.5 (I move the incline up) and gradually move from 1.5 to 2.6 (like 5 minutes near the end I get to 2.6 then I slowly come back down to a walk) . I drink a LOT of water now and I try to drink zero sugar Gatorade to help with my electrolytes. I'm going to go back on my vitamins to help.

I guess I was wondering what's the best way and what to eat?  

Right now I'm only eating Popeyes blackened tenders and the apple cranberry salad from Wendy's. I have frozen chicken and a bag of mixed veggies. I also have a food scale but I'm trying to get actual recipes to help me with this. My husband and I are on different eating because he's trying to gain and obviously I'm trying to cut.


Some exercises I can do besides treadmill to help lose weight and tone some areas. (My arms mainly ) Because I've been getting conflicting advice. Some say weightlifting is the fastest to lose weight and burn calories others say walking. I use to weightlift.


ALSO as far as sweet stuff I started using monk fruit in my coffee(decaf) and sugar free syrup no creamers. ",0,1740698297.0,MealPrepSunday,12,0.4,False

Teeth whitening is an exciting cosmetic procedure that can dramatically transform your smile, but many people aren't sure what they can eat immediately after the treatment. The hours and days following teeth whitening are crucial for maintaining your results and preventing sensitivity. If you've recently undergone teeth whitening or are planning to, understanding the right foods to eat can make a significant difference in your recovery and the longevity of your bright, white smile.

Understanding Teeth Whitening Aftercare

Immediately after teeth whitening, your teeth become temporarily more porous and sensitive. This means that the foods and drinks you consume can easily stain or cause discomfort. The first 48 hours are especially critical in maintaining your newly whitened teeth and preventing potential complications.

What Happens During Teeth Whitening

During the teeth whitening process, the enamel becomes temporarily more vulnerable. The whitening agents open up the pores of your teeth, making them more susceptible to staining and sensitivity. This is why your diet becomes extremely important in the days following the treatment.

The White Diet: Safe Foods to Eat After Teeth Whitening

1. Soft, White Foods
• Plain yogurt
• White rice
• Cauliflower
• Egg whites
• Chicken (white meat)
• Tofu
• Mashed potatoes

Why These Foods Work
These foods are not only gentle on your newly whitened teeth but also help prevent staining. The light color of these foods means they're less likely to leave any pigmentation on your freshly treated teeth.

Hydration is Key

Water should be your primary beverage after teeth whitening. **Avoid colored or sugary drinks** that can potentially stain or harm your teeth. Stick to clear, room-temperature water to keep yourself hydrated and protect your newly whitened smile.

Foods to Absolutely Avoid

Steering clear of certain foods is just as important as choosing the right ones. Avoid:
• Dark-colored beverages (coffee, tea, red wine)
• Colored sauces (tomato sauce, soy sauce)
• Berries and dark fruits
• Chocolate
• Colored candies
• Dark sodas
• Colored condiments

The 48-Hour Critical Period

The first two days after teeth whitening are the most crucial. During this time, your teeth are most vulnerable to staining. Think of your teeth like a white shirt - anything that could stain a white shirt should be avoided.

Long-Term Care After Teeth Whitening

While the first 48 hours are critical, maintaining your white smile requires ongoing care. Continue to:

Professional Recommendations

Always consult with your dentist for personalized advice. Every individual's teeth and whitening experience can be slightly different, so professional guidance is invaluable.

As a millennial - raised in a religious home, there was a whole lot of church shoved down my throat from the time I was born until the time I walked away. 

I was and remain a curious human often asking “why” - what’s the “why” behind what we do, how we do it, where we are doing it why we are doing it etc - it helps put a lot of things into perspective and ensures we’re doing things the best way possible. As a child it was more like why - I don’t understand & because I don’t understand I’m not interested. 

That personality trait got my ass beat, a lot. Literally just my ass - I wasn’t hit across the face, or anything like that. 

I had a custom 2x4 with holes in it that spelled “kids” but it may as well have had my name on it since I was the one getting it every other day. 

My siblings used to tell me to be quiet and just do whatever I was told - I didn’t & they did. 

My siblings were very much like my parents & I was unlike the rest in every conceivable way. 

By the time I was in my 20s I had already wanted little to do with any of them really - but I did my part and showed up for family functions and did my part to try and build some semblance of a relationship with all of them. 

I lived 30 minutes away and would drive over almost every other weekend - and in my few years living close to them, they visited me once. 

I moved a few hours away and visits became monthly. And after a while & a whole lot of therapy I realized this was a one sided relationship- nobody else was trying to keep me in the family the way I was trying to stay engaged and build. 

In the course of almost a decade they visited me once while I was going over virtually monthly. 

I reached out to my siblings and had a heart to heart with each of them & asked them why don’t you give me the time I give you - what did I do wrong to not even try? 

I was mostly met with “we’re just busy…”

One sibling went on to attack me for not altering my wedding plans to make it easier for them like they did when they got married and made changes to accommodate their friends - they went on to attack my life, my choices etc. and then went on to tell my other sibling is a liar and that they didn’t like me either and were upset but wouldn’t tell me the truth.

To make a super long and detailed story as short as possible - I ended up writing a ten page later & mailed a copy to each family member - and let them know real facts, that were undeniable - nobody ever countered them or tried to dismiss them - and I just said I’ll match your input - if you visit me I’ll visit you, if you call or text me I’ll call or text you - I’ll meet you where you are at and foster the type of relationship you want. 

I haven’t seen or heard from any of my siblings in 5 years…and after the first year I decided no matter what, there’s no way I’d bring them into the fold ever again.

I cut my parents off for a few years while I continued to work on myself and process the childhood abandonment that I went through - the fact I only saw emotion and got a hug after I got my ass beat with that 2x4 was a buried trauma for me to deal with & never being included was another one as well -  after a series of long and hard dialogues with my parents to walk them through the trauma I went through from them, they showed remorse and were visibly distraught at what had occurred by them - I slowly met them a couple times a year for coffee - and eventually an end of life scenario allowed me to open the door for more than a coffee & we slowly rebuilt to a surface level relationship…

And honestly, I lost a whole lot of drama without having siblings and my life couldn’t be more care free without their baggage that they brought.

I learned a lot about codependency, being a child of emotionally immature parents, having siblings and parents that are enmeshed in one another - and while I can’t say you all should run, I am saying you should find a really good therapist to process life with - and if the shoe fits, cut them off and move on. 

I carried my siblings with me for years - I didn’t deserve their shit & they didn’t deserve my time. 

All that to say - break the cycle of familiar trauma -  my parents had their own trauma and so did their parents etc and none of them managed it appropriately, they just hid it and then passed it down to their kids (not that they knew that). Cut the bad apples out of your life - trim the trees, let healthy relationships grow and let ones that no longer make sense, fade away. Make your own way if you need to - don’t let anyone tell you,”they’re family “ - well, families don’t do that stuff to each other and if someone that shares your genes is doing it, they might be your biological family but they didn’t make it into your logical family, the people you chose and who choose you back. 

Do yourself a favor, get help, cut the generational trauma especially if you have or want to have kids - even without that factor, it’s still helpful to see how past traumas impact present and future decisions and behaviors.

A mountain of debt looms over me. Jobless, with a family to support and no prospects in sight. Every time I get close to something good or come into some money, something switches in my brain. I make the worst decisions — whether it's small things like switching from making coffee at home to buying coffee every single day with the justification of ""I deserve this small win."" But the truth is... I don't. I don't deserve it because I keep repeating these patterns until the money is gone. When I had a job, I could overlook these little expenses because there was always more money coming in. But it's been three months now — no callbacks, bills piling up, and I've taken out loans just to afford our home.

Anything worth learning takes months of dedication, but I can never seem to fully commit. I tell myself I'll learn coding — two hours a day — and suddenly three weeks have passed without even opening the website. This pattern applies to everything I care about. Six months of consistent workouts, then I get sick or miss a week... and before I know it, a month has passed and all my progress is gone. Jobs are no different — I'll finally get one, everything feels like it's falling into place, and then — mass layoffs. Three companies in a row. Three different jobs, and each one ended the same way: entire teams let go, back to square one. I work for 3-4 months and then spend the same amount of time, if not longer, looking for work again.

I have a million excuses — but when do they stop being excuses and just become shitty luck?

In my head, there's this checklist to get everything right again: get a job, pay off the loans, get in better shape before enlisting, finally achieve my dream to join the Navy even at 31 (age of navy enlistment raised in 2022). Things go smoothly for a week, maybe even months — then I get sick, lose my job, and suddenly buying milk feels like a luxury.

My father died suddenly, leaving my mother with a house but a pile of financial issues she can't pay for. My wife's mother had a debilitating stroke and now spends her whole pension for care, with my wife and I filling in for extra tough days. My degree feels worthless in today's job market (biology) — most jobs won't even cover the interest on my student loans or require me to move far away. I promised my wife she could be a stay-at-home mom... but now she has to look for a job too, just to help us survive. I've deleted all my video games, trying to remove distractions — but then I spend hours watching YouTube or Netflix just to decompress, but the guilt after eats me alive, i looked fore jobs applying non stop for 8 hours but now ive spent 3 hours watching TV and i feel like maybe I could've gotten something in that time. Even when I clean the whole house, I feel useless — like I'm just filling the time, not actually moving forward, cleaning wont get me a job, but its one of the few things i cant do that give me a sense of control.

I feel like a failure — to myself, to my wife, to my newborn daughter. I'm trying so hard, but I can't seem to find a foothold. What do I need to sell or sacrifice to get us out of this hole? I don't know but I hope it comes soon.",1,1740698146.0,Vent,0,1.0,False
1iztfc1,https://www.reddit.com/r/40kLore/comments/1iztfc1/we_need_to_talk_about_space_marines_again/,We Need to Talk About Space Marines. Again.,"This is less meant to discuss Space Marines on the tabletop and more about Space Marines as a lore vehicle. It can be about the tabletop if you want, but I’d never not play with someone because they are running Space Marines. That seems needlessly petty and small. That said, I am a Space Marine… let’s not say hater; let’s say finger wagger.

Most of what I say here has been said before. GW undeniably has some problems with its storytelling: endless MacGuffins, “perpetuals,” consistently poor math, extremely low stakes since no one person or faction ever dies or stays dead even if they aren’t a perpetual, even lower stakes because the Imperium-first POV just hands its poster faction a lot of unearned wins. (Imagine the battle for Macragge going to the Tyranids! Wow! Handing a giant L to the game’s poster boys, now that’s storytelling! The loss of their home and road to recovery would be a great narrative.) 

As you can tell by what I’ve blah blah blah’d so far, I think the gravitational center for all of 40K’s storytelling problems, and all the ones I didn’t mention but will, are the poster boys for the franchise, the dudes who never lose, the dudes who have the personality of a recently expired jar of mayonnaise, the dudes who are just slabs of muscle and armor and even when they are centerpiece characters like Titus, possess all the magnetism of a big bag of toenail clippings. 

Too often, and I mean way too often, 40K feels like the last four seasons of Game of Thrones when all the tools are there to make it feel like the first four. It’s (sort of) good guys versus (mostly) bad guys in the 41st Millennium, evil versus good (or as close as the Imperium can come to being good) when it could be so much more. The Imperium is demonic, which is a good argument for other POVs. (Shout out to all the Black Library authors who are doing their best to make this happen despite GW doing their best to stop them.) 

I recognize that GW has a product line and needs to sell models, but some actual drama and shakeups could, maybe, do that better. Like, ah, here’s the latest Space Marines Lieutenant Chaplain Terminator First Order Squadron Commander Librarian Intercessor Captain. Cool. He sounds important. Here’s his back story. Here’s what he’s like, and he’s cool. And now, in this novel that just followed his release, he’s dead. Not “dead,” just dead. From then on, play the model as if it were just another Noun Noun Noun Noun Noun Noun with the same stats. If ever a franchise needed less certainty, it’s 40K. This is needed because can you think of a Space Marines character from the 40K era who you find interesting for something other than their fighting prowess? Dante… wants to die? That’s cool. 30K had some cool marines. For some reason, 30K marines had personalities, but that was a hindrance or something, so… back to big bags of toenails. The last Space Marine characters with depth died TEN THOUSAND YEARS AGO. I salute your sacrifice, Sanguinius, Dorn, and whoever else I’m forgetting. 

And don’t get me started on the Second Founding chapters. (You don’t need to, I’m going to get myself started). Did we not have enough Space Marines already? Are 18 chapters not enough? Do we need Mega Raptors, Emperor’s Pallbearers, Flesh Eviscerators, Magma Breathers, and other believable but fake names I could keep making up? If you thought Space Marines were generic, hoo boy. Second Founding lore and characters make the Ultramarines look like Deadwood or Sopranos characters. For me, and I hope for someone else reading this, the best part of the Astartes II trailer was watching those Orks beat that generic 877th Gut Exploder chapter Space Marine with their choppas. 

Then there are Primaris Marines. Taller, smarter, stronger, and more loyal (I think this is a thing; I don’t care if it isn’t). And they only took Belisarius Cawl TEN THOUSAND YEARS to create. It’s bad storytelling to have the best mind in the Imperium take TEN THOUSAND YEARS to create Space Marines on HGH. Doesn’t that undermine his intelligence just a little? Pardon my cynicism (here comes an entirely new argument!), but GW knew that their most popular faction by far was the Space Marines, so someone (kind of brilliantly) thought: Wouldn’t it be cool if we found a way to make all tens of thousands of Space Marine players buy all their armies again? What if, instead of bigger, badder Space Marines, we gave the Drukhari a real glow-up? Or Eldar (that last one with the spider guy doesn’t count)? Or how about those dwarves with an 11-unit army we’ve been pushing? The Agents of the Imperium are a cool idea! You could pack a lot in there. World Eaters are still cool. Hey, credit where it’s due; the Death Watch is kind of cool, too, and they’re Space Marines! So, let’s never update them! This is well-explored territory I’m yapping about, and I’m sure GW’s shareholders will agree that a giant universe needs a proportionate amount of diversity and not more dudes in iconic, highly marketable suits of armor that are only as impenetrable as the story needs them to be. Right? Right? Perhaps Belisarius Cawl could have used some of his time during those 10,000 years to, I dunno, make some more factions or something instead of gluing bigger biceps onto what is already the swollest faction.

(COMEDIC INTERMISSION: As an aside, we just saw the Sisters of Battle, my faction, get nerfed into being the game’s weakest faction despite being the only all-female faction, which you must admit is a little funny. “They’re all women. What should we do with them?” “Make them weak because they’re women.” They did this! They actually got reverse-Primarised!)

Speaking of Primaris, let’s talk about the Primarchs. They stink. Or rather, their resurrections stink. They are, almost wholly, very boring characters with incredible plot armor. I’m not much of a comic books guy, but I’m familiar enough with the tropes to know that when you start bringing people back from the dead, stasis, or adventures in the Warp, you’re running out of ideas. Guilliman, The Lion, Fulgrim, whoever else they trot out, all duds. Pure model bait. In a universe where it is possible to bring 50,000,000 guns to a battle, why does it matter if Fulgrim or The Lion is a good dualist… with swords? The Inquisition can annihilate planets between sips of coffee. Fulgrim is a snake with swords. Woo-ee. Great.

Alright, it's time to try being positive. It’s been said by plenty of people, and they’re all 100% correct, that the most interesting characters in the 40K universe are not the main characters. Guard stories tend to be great. Sisters' stories tend to be great and have much-untapped potential. In the Night Lord’s books, there’s an anecdote about a slave who is freer under their authority than he ever was as an assembly line worker in the Imperium. That’s… great. I want to know about the internal politics of Eldar Craftworlds and see some models that correspond to those individual continent-sized spaceships. Who knows, that might make more people play them, and sell models that aren’t Space Marines. The 40K detective books and horror books (they have a specific name, but I can’t remember it off the top of my head) are also terrific and use the universe in a far richer fashion than anything to do with Primarchs or Space Marines. Maybe there’s a future for GW where they highlight the granular aspects of this beautiful (and terrible) universe they have created instead of the big man in big armor shooting the big gun. Maybe that’s what the show will be about, but I doubt it. Someone should make a Polymarket bet on whether the Amazon show will focus on Ultramarines.

I know where I am putting my entire 401K. Thanks, Space Marines 2, you very middling, forgettable, circa-2010s shooter without a single character. No, not even the Chaos Space Marine sorcerer guy who commands you to “Witness true power!” before shooting lightning at you from his hands. Yuck. Just bleh. ",0,1740698106.0,40kLore,21,0.14,False

1iztdun,https://www.reddit.com/r/Kerala/comments/1iztdun/kerala_is_absolutely_amazing/,Kerala is absolutely amazing!,"Dear Keralites, 

I spent the last 8 days traveling in Kerala. I was there to attend a couple of weddings and decided that I wanted to spend some time in Munnar with my family. The areas I covered were: Kochi, Kumarakom, Kottayam, and Munnar. 

I am from Bangalore and I have lived in Hyderabad and visited multiple Indian cities and states and I can confidently state that of the places I have been to, Kerala is YEARS ahead. 

Here are a few things that won my heart:

1. I saw a political procession that occupied EXACTLY half the road, allowing for traffic to move smoothly. There were even people who were coordinating with said movement. Seeing communist signage and symbolism was a bit strange but I was pleasantly surprised by their civic sense. 

2. The roads are almost always narrow and whenever there are road works, it gets reduced to a one lane. Not a problem for Mallus apparently because they will all wait in a single file line for their turn to move.

3. THERE ARE NO POTHOLES BUT THERE ARE ALSO NO TOLLS! I was in awe of the quality of your roads but also in awe of the fact that I didn't pay a single rupee to go anywhere - except the airport toll in Kochi. 

4. People are friendly. Very friendly. I don't know Malayalam so I stuck to English. Most could understand me. Some couldn't. Those who couldn't still tried their best. To my surprise, some even asked me (I understand a bit ot Malayalam) what my tongue was and when I said Kannada, some of them even started speaking in (broken) Kannada. 

5. All the service staff are extremely well behaved. All the hotels I went to, I received excellent service. They were very polite and friendly. 

6. Your food is AMAZING! No honestly, your fish fries are a Godsend. 

7. Kerala is CHEAP AF! 30 rupees for a big cup of coffee? Ridiculous! Family of four eating lunch and paying just 500 rupees? Even more ridiculous! 

8. Your state is beautiful. Every where you go, there's a pretty beach, a serene lake, a majestic mountain, something. Truly is God's own country!

9. Your tourist spots have almost no crowd. It was amazing. Any place I went to, there were less than 20 people at a time! The same sort of place in Telangana or Karnataka? There would be 100s. Maybe I didn't know the most popular places but I went to some pretty spectacular places and it was nice not be part of an active stampede. 

I am in awe of how well the state is doing. I was fortunate enough to be in Switzerland about 5 months ago. Easily the best country I've been to. India is so far from it in every which way - but Kerala comes closest in terms of civic sense, discipline, and its way of life. I can't wait to come back. 

p.s: You guys LOVE your bakeries though. There are bakeries everywhere. What's that about?

1iztdk6,https://www.reddit.com/r/Millennials/comments/1iztdk6/for_those_millennials_doing_therapy/,For those millennials doing therapy…,"Break generational trauma

As a millennial - raised in a religious home, there was a whole lot of church shoved down my throat from the time I was born until the time I walked away. 

I was and remain a curious human often asking “why” - what’s the “why” behind what we do, how we do it, where we are doing it why we are doing it etc - it helps put a lot of things into perspective and ensures we’re doing things the best way possible. As a child it was more like why - I don’t understand & because I don’t understand I’m not interested. 

That personality trait got my ass beat, a lot. Literally just my ass - I wasn’t hit across the face, or anything like that. 

I had a custom 2x4 with holes in it that spelled “kids” but it may as well have had my name on it since I was the one getting it every other day. 

My siblings used to tell me to be quiet and just do whatever I was told - I didn’t & they did. 

My siblings were very much like my parents & I was unlike the rest in every conceivable way. 

By the time I was in my 20s I had already wanted little to do with any of them really - but I did my part and showed up for family functions and did my part to try and build some semblance of a relationship with all of them. 

I lived 30 minutes away and would drive over almost every other weekend - and in my few years living close to them, they visited me once. 

I moved a few hours away and visits became monthly. And after a while & a whole lot of therapy I realized this was a one sided relationship- nobody else was trying to keep me in the family the way I was trying to stay engaged and build. 

In the course of almost a decade they visited me once while I was going over virtually monthly. 

I reached out to my siblings and had a heart to heart with each of them & asked them why don’t you give me the time I give you - what did I do wrong to not even try? 

I was mostly met with “we’re just busy…”

One sibling went on to attack me for not altering my wedding plans to make it easier for them like they did when they got married and made changes to accommodate their friends - they went on to attack my life, my choices etc. and then went on to tell my other sibling is a liar and that they didn’t like me either and were upset but wouldn’t tell me the truth.

To make a super long and detailed story as short as possible - I ended up writing a ten page later & mailed a copy to each family member - and let them know real facts, that were undeniable - nobody ever countered them or tried to dismiss them - and I just said I’ll match your input - if you visit me I’ll visit you, if you call or text me I’ll call or text you - I’ll meet you where you are at and foster the type of relationship you want. 

I haven’t seen or heard from any of my siblings in 5 years…and after the first year I decided no matter what, there’s no way I’d bring them into the fold ever again.

I cut my parents off for a few years while I continued to work on myself and process the childhood abandonment that I went through - the fact I only saw emotion and got a hug after I got my ass beat with that 2x4 was a buried trauma for me to deal with & never being included was another one as well -  after a series of long and hard dialogues with my parents to walk them through the trauma I went through from them, they showed remorse and were visibly distraught at what had occurred by them - I slowly met them a couple times a year for coffee - and eventually an end of life scenario allowed me to open the door for more than a coffee & we slowly rebuilt to a surface level relationship…

And honestly, I lost a whole lot of drama without having siblings and my life couldn’t be more care free without their baggage that they brought.

I learned a lot about codependency, being a child of emotionally immature parents, having siblings and parents that are enmeshed in one another - and while I can’t say you all should run, I am saying you should find a really good therapist to process life with - and if the shoe fits, cut them off and move on. 

I carried my siblings with me for years - I didn’t deserve their shit & they didn’t deserve my time. 

All that to say - break the cycle of familiar trauma -  my parents had their own trauma and so did their parents etc and none of them managed it appropriately, they just hid it and then passed it down to their kids (not that they knew that). Cut the bad apples out of your life - trim the trees, let healthy relationships grow and let ones that no longer make sense, fade away. Make your own way if you need to - don’t let anyone tell you,”they’re family “ - well, families don’t do that stuff to each other and if someone that shares your genes is doing it, they might be your biological family but they didn’t make it into your logical family, the people you chose and who choose you back. 

Do yourself a favor, get help, cut the generational trauma especially if you have or want to have kids - even without that factor, it’s still helpful to see how past traumas impact present and future decisions and behaviors.

The end.

1iztdbr,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1iztdbr,Adventure is apparently raspberry flavoring,"Only things of note in today's vlog:

1. Still can't keep her tongue in her mouth.

2. Spent half the video raving about the ""new coffee,"" which was the same order she usually gets except with 1 vanilla/1 raspberry instead of 2 pumps vanilla. This is the excitement in her life.

3. Sloppy Joe apparently thinks nothing of leaving her room at her parents' house constantly in shambles. Asks if the skirt she tries on is ugly (yes).

4. Suggests to her dad to buy this or that at the store, to which he reminds her that he has some at home or isn't going to waste money on that, etc. I've seen her do this to her dad before. Pretty sure she didn't learn her fiscally irresponsible behavior from her parents. It's like she has no concept of money management whatsoever.

Side note: Lots of discussion/debate over her weight loss lately. My take is I think it's evident she's lost some weight, but the skirt pics indicate just how much she must have gained since dating Porky for her to have lost weight and still not be back to the size she was before.

We're going on a long weekend trip to a cabin to celebrate, but I'd like to get him something small but meaningful as well.

He's in his early 30s, and very much has a BIFL mindset. He's techy, runs a lot, plays guitar, enjoys history and old movies, is really into good sound systems, and has started doing some woodworking lately. He's kind of an ""old soul"" type, and likes being warm and cozy.

He's a little tricky to gift for -- he makes a lot more than I do, so he's able to get himself good-quality items when he wants them, so he's fairly well-stocked already! He already has a set of Le Creuset pots/pans, a Leatherman multitool that he carries every day, good quality luggage, and is currently working on fixing his Garmin running watch.

The only ideas I've had so far are 1) a good leather wallet to replace his aging one, but he recently mentioned he might want to switch to a more minimalist mag-safe one, so I'm not sure about that, or 2) a pair of good leather slippers, to replace his current ones that are wearing out.

He doesn't really drink alcohol or coffee, and doesn't have any particular favorite sports teams, so those kind of ""easy target"" gifts are out.

Price range is probably in the under-$200 region. Any suggestions? Thanks all!",1,1740697740.0,bifl,1,1.0,False
1izta0s,https://www.reddit.com/r/Patagonia/comments/1izta0s/bariloche_reflections/,Bariloche reflections,"Having benefitted so much from this community in planning my trip to South America, I wanted to offer some thoughts having spent a few days in Bariloche.

Transport: There are Ubers everywhere and the prices seem reasonable (we're from the UK and live in London, and they are cheaper than there). You need a SUBE card to travel on the buses and it seems like the only place they're available in Bariloche is at an office in the Centro Civico, which closes at 3pm.  Argentina has a zero blood alcohol content law, which means no drinks at all if you're driving - that means a bit of planning if you want to go to the many cevecerias.

Money: Most places take card, but it's been rare to be able to add tip on to the card - that's had to be in cash (this is unlike the UK so hopefully a useful piece of info!). The food stalls in the Coloina Suiza only took cash (through a system that seemed to be ordering and getting a ticket then taking that to a central pay station).

Wasps: There are quite a lot! They don't seem too aggressive but they love meat and swarmed around when we stopped on walks or at beaches. My partner is allergic and it did mean we had to adapt plans when there were too many for us to feel comfortable, so this might be useful info for others.

**Things to do**
Colonia Suiza: We went to Colonia Suiza on a Wednesday, which is a busy day because of the curanto - where they bury food to cook it and then dig it up again. (I think Saturday is the same.) It was super busy and we didn't see a huge amount of info about the history of the village - it's mostly beer and food gardens/markets, some shops and some market stalls. If you're interested in the curanto then I'd recommend going around 12 to see them bury the food and adding your name to the list to eat, and then making sure you're around to watch them dig it up at about 1pm or 1.50pm (depending on which place you go to). We didn't have curanto, but had an asado platter from a curanto place opposite a restaurant called Aire Sur. It was good food.

Hiking: There's so many trails and the trail heads seem well signed. We did Cerro Llao Llao to Villa Tacul then Sendero de Los Arrayanes as a loop - it was a mostly easy 7.5 miles, with the last half mile to the Cerro viewpoint being the hardest bit but still just a big hill, no scrambling. The little cafe at the car park at the start of Sendero de Los Arrayanes had really excellent coffee and delicious cakes.

Cerro Campanario: We went up on the chairlift and walked back down. I'd highly recommend the cafe at the top for breakfast/lunch, they had a good selection of savoury and sweet and the view was amazing. The walk back down was very dusty, but fine.

Walking tour: We went on one called the German footprint and Nazi prescence, which was super interesting and the guide, Diego, was very knowledgeable. https://www.historiasdebariloche.com.ar/english

Beer: We did a good walking brewery tour from Bosque Cevecero (excellent beer, great food and lovely staff), to Gilbert (loved this place - all wood and beer mats) and then the Patagonia brewery (which is almost like a beer theme park! You have to pay 5000 pesos to get in, but this is taken off your beers. It's got fantastic views.) Our favourite beer was the session IPA at Bosque.

One of the most renowned cities on the Eastern side of Terra. A city where its people live in relative peace and order—something that has become rare these days. My life once revolved around this place, walking these very streets a long, long time ago. Sometimes alone, sometimes with my sister—or rather, my half-sister. But that distinction never really mattered to me. I loved her all the same, as any elder sibling would.

The view of Lungmen, though dominated by towering structures and neon-lit streets, carries a kind of familiarity that soothes the soul. It is not like the countryside villages of Victoria or the rugged landscapes of Kazdel, where nature intertwines freely with daily life. But even so, there is a certain charm in its industrial skyline, in the way the city breathes through the countless lives it shelters.

If one is skilled enough, they might find a higher vantage point to take in the vast expanse of the city. I have found several such spots over the years, places where I could watch half of Lungmen sprawled beneath me, glowing with artificial lights that pulse like the city’s heartbeat. Some businesses have even capitalized on these scenic views, setting up cafés and teahouses in elevated locations, offering their customers a moment of respite amid the urban sprawl. After all, as that one developer used to say, ""Location, location, location."" The thought makes me smirk as I mutter the words under my breath. That man had a way of slipping little phrases like that into conversations, lodging them in my mind like unshakable pieces of trivia. Thinking about it now, he really was like a walking encyclopedia of random knowledge.

The gentle sound of rain tapping against the rooftop pulls me from my thoughts. It is not a heavy downpour—just a million delicate droplets pattering against the metal surface, creating a soft, rhythmic melody. The kind of rain that carries nostalgia, making the world outside feel distant yet strangely intimate.

I take a slow sip from the cup in my hands, feeling the warmth spread through my fingers. The aroma of hot coffee mingles with the scent of damp earth and rain-kissed pavement. A simple, quiet moment in a city that never truly sleeps. Lungmen has changed over the years, and so have I. But some things remain the same. The rain, the skyline, and the memories that refuse to fade.

Now I wonder—where is that man who once walked beside me? It has been years since our paths last crossed, the final time being in Ursus after we had wrapped up unfinished business in Victoria. Even then, I knew he would eventually slip away, drawn by something beyond my understanding. Before he left, he mentioned heading somewhere “East” to take care of something. Vague as ever, as if he expected me to piece it together on my own.

If I had to guess, there are a few possibilities:

A—He started a new life somewhere, trying to leave everything behind. Perhaps he has found a quiet place where no one knows his name, where he is not burdened by the weight of his past. It would be a stretch, but not entirely impossible. Even a man like him might crave peace, though whether he would allow himself to have it is another matter.

B—He has sparked yet another conflict. Wherever he goes, trouble follows. Maybe he clashed with the local government, or perhaps he involved himself in something much larger, something that stretches beyond the borders of any one nation. If he is still the same as I remember, he would not stand idly by if he saw injustice—though his way of dealing with it has never been gentle.

C—He settled down with someone. Now that would be a sight to see. The idea of him living a quiet, domestic life, worrying about mundane things like groceries or house repairs, is almost laughable. But if, by some miracle, he did find someone who could tolerate him, I suppose I would not be entirely surprised. He has a way of drawing people in, even when he does not intend to.

D—He disappeared into the underground, spinning webs of deceit and chaos for his own amusement. He always did enjoy pulling strings from the shadows, watching as people danced to a tune only he could hear. Maybe he started a business just to set people against each other, stirring conflict purely because he could. If anyone is capable of such a thing, it is him.

The truth is, I have no idea which path he has chosen. He has always been unreadable, an enigma even to those who knew him best. One moment, he speaks like a sage, offering insights so profound you would think he had lived a thousand lifetimes. Next, he is as dense as a slab of Durin stone, missing the most obvious details right in front of him. And in between those two extremes, he drifts unpredictably, impossible to pin down.

Maybe, one day, I will cross paths with him again. Maybe not. If he is still out there, I doubt he has changed. And if I ever do find him, I suspect I will be greeted with the same half-smirk and that infuriatingly casual attitude, as if no time had passed at all.

“Talulah? Never took you for the coffee type.”

A familiar voice called out from behind me, smooth yet carrying that ever-present edge of amusement. I turned my head, already recognizing the speaker before I even saw her standing in the doorway.

“Hui-chieh?” I blinked, caught somewhere between surprise and a strange sense of inevitability. “Didn’t expect to see your face around these parts anymore.”

She stepped inside, unbothered by the rain that still drizzled lightly outside. Without missing a beat, she walked straight to the counter, placing her order with a casual confidence that made it seem as if she had been here a hundred times before. A moment later, coffee in hand, she strolled toward my table and sat across from me like it was the most natural thing in the world.

“Well,” she said, leaning back slightly, “I never thought I’d see your face again either. Especially here.” Her sharp eyes studied me, as if measuring how much time had changed me. “You should’ve left me a message or something. I could’ve arranged a place for you to crash for a while.”

Her tone was light, but I could hear the unspoken concern buried beneath it.

For quite a while, neither of us spoke a word. The only sound between us was the quiet hum of the coffee shop and the occasional clatter of cups meeting saucers. The air was thick with unspoken words, but neither of us seemed willing to be the first to shatter the silence. Instead, we held each other’s gaze—sharp, searching, filled with things we could not quite put into words.

Once, we had been inseparable. No distance too great, no trial too overwhelming. But time had its toll to be paid, and we had paid it in full. Now? I struggled to remember the last time we had spent more than a handful of hours together. The longest had been years ago, standing on opposite ends of a battlefield, blades clashing atop the control tower of Chernobog. After that, another brief reunion in Londinium, in the aftermath of a crisis neither of us had the luxury of avoiding.

That was the nature of our relationship now—brief meetings between long stretches of absence, the bond of sisters weathered by war and duty.

After a few moments, I realized if neither of us spoke, we would likely sit like this for the rest of the day. I let out a long sigh, finally deciding to break the silence. “How’s work? Must be busy being Chief of the LGD,” I said, taking a slow sip of my coffee.

Hui-chieh’s eyes flickered for a moment before she answered. “You didn’t know?” she asked, tilting her head slightly. “I resigned.”

I raised an eyebrow. “Really?”

She nodded, exhaling as if the weight of it still lingered on her shoulders. “Yeah. But work follows me no matter where I go, no matter what title I hold.” A wry smile tugged at the corners of her lips, but it did little to mask the exhaustion I could already see on her face. “I think you know exactly how tiring that can get after a while.”

“Sure, I get that little Hui-chieh is still a workaholic,” I teased, a smirk tugging at my lips. It had been a long time since I last indulged in such banter, and for once, I wanted to see how she would react.

She narrowed her eyes slightly, exhaling through her nose. “Hmph. Feels like a lifetime ago since you last called me that,” she muttered, setting her cup down with a soft clink. “Besides, I go by Ch’en now, Talulah. It is my codename in Rhodes Island.”

There was something off about the way she said it—less firm than I had expected, almost reluctant. Did she truly embrace it, or was it simply another duty she had taken upon herself, just as she had done with the LGD?

“I see that Rhodes Island has taken you under their wing,” I mused, swirling the coffee in my cup before taking another sip. “Not that it is a big surprise, honestly. When I led Reunion, a lot of the Infected spoke about them. Some feared them, others saw them as salvation.” I let out a dry chuckle. “And after spending time in their cell, well, I know them better than most outsiders.”

Ch’en studied me carefully. “Bad or good things?” she finally asked.

I met her gaze and smiled faintly. “Both. There is no such thing as pure good or pure evil, after all.”

She gave a small nod, as if acknowledging the truth in my words, then took a slow sip of her coffee. “So, how long are you planning to stay?”

I paused, thinking it over. Truthfully, I had no plans to linger, but there was no need to ruin the moment with such details. It was rare for us to see each other like this—without swords drawn, without the weight of battle pressing down on our shoulders. “I cannot say for sure,” I answered after a moment. “But I will let you know when I am leaving.”

“Fair enough,” she said, leaning back in her chair. “Not that I expected you to return and settle down here. After everything we have been through… this place must bring back a lot of bad memories.”

I sighed, glancing out the window. She was not wrong. This city was where our paths had violently split, torn apart by politics, by war, by choices neither of us had the luxury of avoiding. As much as I hated politics, as much as I resented being a pawn in greater schemes, I had long since accepted that I, too, had become entangled in such matters—only with different players, different motives.

But in the end, the great game remained the same. Some must be sacrificed for the game to move forward.

……

After a while, a question formed in my mind—one that gnawed at me the more I thought about it. Why was she here? She had resigned from the LGD, had she not? Nothing should have tied her to this city anymore… right?

I studied her for a moment, then finally voiced my thoughts.

“Ch’en, why did you come back here?” I asked, my tone even but laced with curiosity. “If you do not mind me asking, of course.”

For a split second, I caught the flicker of surprise on her face, as if she had just remembered something she had forgotten to mention.

“Oh, right. About that…” She set her coffee down and let out a small sigh. “Swire called me. Something about a high-priority criminal from Columbia landing in Lungmen.”

I arched my brow. “A criminal?”

She nodded. “Not just any criminal. This guy is one of the top assassins in the underworld syndicate back in Columbia.”

That caught my attention. “And why exactly did the LGD call you back for this? Surely, they can handle one man, no?”

Ch’en gave me a knowing look. “You would think so. But considering that this man has evaded most of LGD’s traps without leaving a single trace—and has avoided causing any casualties despite being caught in skirmishes—I would say he is a real professional.” She leaned forward slightly, voice lowering. “Most assassins would take the easy way out, cutting down anyone who stood in their way, no matter who. But this one?” She shook her head. “It is like he has his own code. He does not kill unless necessary.”

I hummed in thought, letting her words settle. A ghost of a smile played on my lips. “A moral assassin… that is a rare breed.”

Ch’en crossed her arms. “Rare, but dangerous. He is up to something, and Swire wants to make sure he does not slip through our fingers.”

I tapped my fingers lightly against my cup, glancing toward the rain-slick streets outside. A professional assassin from Columbia with a personal code, now lurking in Lungmen? It was almost too familiar.

And I had the strangest feeling this was not just some ordinary job.

Then, a thought struck me—one that I could not ignore. It could be him. After all these years… could it really be him?

I kept the thought to myself, but to no avail. Ch’en had been watching me closely, her sharp gaze narrowing ever so slightly as she picked up on the shift in my expression.

“Talulah?” she asked, tilting her head slightly. “What’s on your mind now?”

I exhaled, debating whether to voice my thoughts. There was no harm in mentioning it, though I doubted it was really him.

“It is just that…” I started, choosing my words carefully. “The way you described him—it reminds me of someone I used to know. Just thinking about how I have not seen him in quite some time now.”

Ch’en leaned back slightly, crossing her arms as she processed my words. Then, she let out an amused huff.

“Ah, I see. Do not worry,” she said, a teasing edge creeping into her voice. “From what I heard, the guy we are after is not some giant of a man like your man.”

I blinked. My man? What was that supposed to mean?

I opened my mouth to argue but stopped myself when I realized something—why did everyone keep assuming that he and I were… something? We had never done anything strange together. No lingering glances, no whispered words under the moonlight, nothing.

…Right?

Well beside accidentally falling asleep together that one time…forget about it.

I quickly shook the thought from my head before I could embarrass myself further. Forget it. Focus on Ch’en’s story first, Talulah.

“So, this guy,” Ch’en continued, mercifully moving on, “is reportedly a Liberi with black hair and a beard. Eyes as red as blood. Probably a little over six feet, if the intel is not wrong.”

I let out a small breath of relief. Not him.

At least, not the man I had been thinking of just now.

I let out a quiet breath, leaning back slightly in my chair. Not him.

Though I was relieved, a small part of me could not shake the feeling of uncertainty. The world was vast, yet it had a strange way of bringing familiar faces back when you least expected them.

Ch’en took another sip of her coffee, watching me carefully, perhaps noticing my moment of hesitation.

“You seem oddly relieved,” she remarked.

I gave a small shrug. “Just means I do not have to deal with any… surprises.”

She scoffed lightly. “You sound like you were expecting someone.”

I shook my head. “Not really. Just reminiscing about the past.”

Ch’en hummed at that, her eyes narrowing slightly as if debating whether to press further.

“But if he was here,” she continued, “what would you do?”

The question caught me off guard. I looked at her, unsure how to answer.

Would I greet him like an old friend? Confront him for disappearing without a word? Or would I simply walk past him, pretending we had never met? “I suppose that depends on the circumstances,” I finally replied. “And on what kind of man he has become.”

Ch’en studied me for a moment before nodding, as if accepting my answer for now.

“Well, either way,” she said, setting down her cup, “this guy we’re looking for is dangerous. We are talking about someone who has been dodging LGD’s traps like it is second nature. Even Swire sounded a little uneasy about him.”

“That is unusual,” I admitted. “She does not get shaken easily.”

“Exactly,” Ch’en said. “So, whatever this guy’s deal is, it is something big. Swire would not have called me back if it were just a regular contract killer.”

I tapped my fingers against my cup, lost in thought. “And what do you think?”

Ch’en exhaled through her nose. “I think there is more to this than what we have been told. The way he moves… It is not just skill. It is an experience. Purpose.”

“Meaning?”

She looked at me, her expression unreadable. “Meaning, he is not just here to kill someone. He is here for something—or someone.”

A chill ran down my spine, but I ignored it, taking another slow sip of my coffee.

“Well,” I said, glancing out the window at the city streets beyond, “I suppose we will find out soon enough.”

……

The quiet atmosphere of the coffee shop was disturbed by the soft chime of the entrance bell as the door eased open. A man stepped inside, moving with an air of quiet confidence. He was well into his fifties, but his posture was firm, his gait steady. His black hair was obsidian black without any streak of silver, and a neatly trimmed beard framed his sharp features.

But what stood out the most were his eyes—deep red, like burning embers dulled only by years of experience.

His attire was unassuming yet practical: a worn gray jacket layered over a dark shirt, paired with simple jeans and heavy-duty work boots that bore the scuffs of long use. He exuded a certain presence—one that did not demand attention, yet subtly commanded it. The way he carried himself was telling. He was not just any passerby stopping for an evening coffee; he was someone used to observing, planning, waiting.

As he strolled toward the counter, I instinctively shifted in my seat, my muscles tensing slightly. The timing of his arrival was uncanny.

I turned my gaze toward Ch’en, my expression betraying genuine surprise. She had just finished describing the man LGD was hunting, and here he was, standing mere feet away, casually ordering a drink as if he were just another patron.

Ch’en, still holding her coffee cup mid-air, raised an eyebrow at me before following my gaze. Her lips parted slightly, then pressed into a thin line.

“Am I dreaming,” she muttered under her breath, clicking her tongue in mild frustration, “or is that him?”

She subtly gestured toward the man with a tilt of her head, her body language tense but controlled.

Before I could respond, a cheerful voice interrupted the moment.

“Hey, Uncle Johann! Long time no see. Coming home from work?”

The cashier, a young feline girl with a bright smile, greeted him like an old acquaintance.

For a brief moment, the man—Johann—remained silent, his gaze lingering on the counter as if he were lost in thought. Then, as if snapping back to the present, he offered a polite smile.

“Yeah,” he replied smoothly, his voice carrying a deep, unhurried timbre. “It’s been a while since I was here.”

His eyes flickered toward the girl, gauging her reaction before adding, “How’s business?”

“Great! We’re expecting a big crowd soon since the holidays are coming up.” The cashier beamed, setting his order neatly on the counter. “Here you go, sir.”

Johann nodded appreciatively, taking the tray with practiced ease before making his way toward the farthest corner of the room. He chose a seat with a clear view of the street outside, positioning himself in a way that allowed him to observe both the entrance and the other patrons without drawing attention to himself.

Smart.

I leaned slightly toward Ch’en, lowering my voice.

“The guy just walked into our lap,” I murmured, my fingers tightening slightly around my cup.

Ch’en exhaled through her nose, her grip on her coffee firm but controlled.

“This complicates things,” she muttered back. “Because if he’s as good as they say, he already knows we’re watching him.”

We sat in silence, neither of us making any sudden moves. Across the room, Johann took a slow sip of his coffee, his red eyes momentarily meeting mine before shifting away, as if this was all just another normal evening.

But I knew better.

And so did he.

Ch’en and I exchanged a glance, and for the first time in years, I felt a rare moment of understanding between us. No words needed to be spoken—our expressions said it all.

Was it pure coincidence, or had fate decided to play a cruel joke on us?

Uncle Johann, huh?

I kept my posture relaxed, taking a slow sip of my coffee, but my mind was racing. If this man was truly the assassin Ch’en and the LGD were after, then he was either fearless or incredibly confident in his ability to blend into the crowd. Nothing about his demeanor suggested a man on the run. He carried himself with a quiet ease, as if he had done this a thousand times before.

“He does not seem like a man who just dodged LGD’s traps,” I muttered under my breath.

Ch’en kept her gaze locked on him, her fingers lightly tapping against her cup. “Exactly,” she whispered back. “Either the reports were wrong, or we are dealing with someone really good.”

I glanced back at the man. He was staring out the window, sipping his drink, completely at ease. The way he positioned himself in the room was no accident—he had a full view of both the entrance and the street outside. A strategic mind at work. “Do you want to approach him?” I asked, keeping my tone casual.

Ch’en exhaled through her nose, tilting her head slightly. “Not yet. Let us observe him for a bit.”

I smirked. “You? Taking the patient approach? I must be dreaming.”

She shot me a glare but said nothing.

For now, we waited.

……

Thirty minutes had passed, yet nothing out of the ordinary had happened. The coffee shop remained as it was—quiet, almost peaceful. The occasional murmur of casual conversations filled the space, accompanied by the faint hum of the espresso machine and the rhythmic ticking of the clock mounted on the wall.

Johann sat in his corner, unbothered, leisurely eating his snack and sipping his coffee while scrolling through his phone. He looked every bit like an ordinary man enjoying a quiet evening, lost in whatever news or entertainment he had on his screen.

But I knew better.

And so did Ch’en.

Seated across from me, she had long since abandoned her coffee, her fingers restlessly tapping against the table, then shifting to mindless motions—fiddling with her thumbs, drumming her nails against the cup, tracing nonexistent patterns on the wooden surface. She was trying to look casual, but to someone paying close enough attention, the tension in her shoulders betrayed her.

I exhaled slowly and leaned slightly toward her.

“Be patient,” I whispered, keeping my voice low and steady. “He’s probably playing the waiting game with us right now.”

Ch’en let out a small, frustrated huff, her golden eyes flicking toward me.

“I know,” she muttered back, barely moving her lips. “Why do you think I’m trying so damn hard to play it cool?”

Her voice was sharp but hushed, as if she were acutely aware that he might be listening.

And she was right.

I could see it in the subtle way Johann occasionally shifted his eyes—never directly looking at us, but subtly adjusting his posture just enough to keep the entire room within his periphery. The way his ears twitched slightly at certain sounds, the way he seemed to take his time finishing his drink—stalling.

This wasn’t just an old man enjoying his evening.

This was a professional waiting for something.

Or someone.

And then, the soft chime of the store’s doorbell rang again.

Ch’en stiffened slightly.

I slowly turned my head toward the entrance, feeling the weight of anticipation settle in my chest.

Was this part of his plan? Or had fate decided to throw yet another complication into the mix?

One thing was certain—this quiet evening was about to change.

……

The soft chime of the doorbell barely registered at first. My mind was too preoccupied—still reeling from the whole situation with Johann, Ch’en’s tension, and my own lingering thoughts.

But the moment he entered, my entire body locked up.

It was him.

The very same man I had been thinking about for the past few hours.

The same man whose presence I had tried—tried—to push from my mind, only for fate to throw him right back into my life at this precise moment. It was as if time had forgotten to touch him. He looked exactly the same as he did the last time I saw him, as if not a single day had passed since our paths split all those years ago. The same sharp eyes, the same ridiculous neat hair, the same unmistakable presence that somehow made everything feel both larger and smaller at the same time. Just in his white jacket and boot instead of his usual gear.

I took a sip of my coffee, trying to keep my composure.

And nearly spat it all out when I realized the full absurdity of the situation.

For crying out loud, the man was twice the height of the doorway. He had to lean down just to fit inside!

He entered the café with the same casual ease he always had, completely unfazed by how much he stood out. Meanwhile, my brain was screaming at me in two completely opposite directions—half furious, half ecstatic.

And yet, what happened next was somehow even more ridiculous.

The cashier—who had just been speaking casually with Johann mere moments ago—let out an audible gasp before immediately straightening up.

Her reaction alone would have been odd enough, but the entire café staff suddenly followed suit.

“Ah! Grandmaster Guān Lóng Chén!” the cashier girl practically beamed, her voice carrying an unmistakable reverence. “It is a tremendous honor that you have graced this humble cafe with your presence! We are honored to hold you as our guest!”

What.

The.

Hell?

My already spiraling thoughts completely derailed as I watched not only her but several of the café’s workers bowing slightly while performing the fist-and-palm salute toward him.

And he—he—simply returned the gesture, as if this was nothing out of the ordinary.

My eyes twitched.

What in the world had he been doing since we last saw each other? Why the hell was he being addressed as a Grandmaster?

Why was his name now suddenly Guān Lóng Chén??

WHAT THE HELL HAPPENED TO HIM WHILE I WASN’T AROUND?!?

I felt my grip tightening around my cup as I desperately tried to process the situation, but he—standing there like some esteemed sage—only smiled humbly before speaking in that same infuriatingly calm voice of his.

“Please,” he said, “I no longer go by that title or name. It was merely an honorific bestowed upon me by the Grand Tutor, nothing more.” He let out a small chuckle. “Besides, I only held it for a year and a half.”

Only a year and a half?!

Was that supposed to be nothing?!

The cashier, however, was undeterred. “But your deeds have spread far and wide! All of Yan will remember your name forever! Please, allow us the honor of serving you—your meal is on the house!”

I could already feel the incoming headache.

What deeds? What had he done to be remembered in all of Yan? Why were ordinary café workers treating him like some folks' hero?!

Meanwhile, he merely inclined his head politely before shaking it.

“Please,” he said, his tone soft yet firm, “just accept my money. I am not a beggar seeking a free meal, and I will not take no for an answer.”

The manager looked utterly torn between obeying him and insisting otherwise.

I, on the other hand, just sat there, staring at him like he had personally offended the laws of reality.

This could not be real.

And yet, here he was.

Twice the height of the door.

A so-called Grandmaster. And still, somehow, the same ridiculous man I knew.

The situation had already taken a sharp left turn into the bizarre, but somehow, it just kept escalating.

After his little back-and-forth with the staff, the Grandmaster—or whatever he was calling himself these days—finally placed his order. A simple meal and a cup of oolong tea, nothing extravagant. The kind of choice that screamed 'I am totally normal, please do not mind me', despite everything about him saying otherwise.

Then, after a brief, casual nod toward Johann—Johann, of all people?!—he made his way over and sat down.

Right across from him.

At the same table. Just with a bigger chair obviously.

Like they were just two old acquaintances catching up over drinks.

I swear I felt my brain physically short-circuit.

Across from me, Ch’en had gone completely stiff, her fingers frozen mid-fidget. Slowly, she turned to look at me, her expression shifting through several layers of ‘what the hell?’ before finally settling into something unreadable.

I could feel my own face mirroring hers.

Neither of us said a word.

Neither of us needed to.

Because there they were—two targets, the men we had been thinking and speculating about—just sitting together in the same damn café, casually sipping their drinks like nothing was out of the ordinary.

The sheer coincidence of it all was absurd.

The tension between Ch’en and me was almost palpable, a silent exchange of what do we do now? hanging in the air.

Meanwhile, across the room, Johann took a slow sip of his coffee, scrolling through his phone like this was just another quiet evening.

And he–Grandmaster or whatever–the–hell–he–was–up–to–these–days—sighed in contentment as he took his first sip of oolong tea, as if he had not just completely shattered my entire understanding of reality by walking through that door.

Great.

Just great.

Now what?

……

Ch’en and I remained frozen in place, barely even daring to breathe as we listened to the two men—our two targets—casually chatting like old friends catching up over drinks.

Like this was some kind of nostalgic high school reunion instead of what it really was—a potentially explosive situation that could go sideways in an instant.

He—the so-called Grandmaster—leaned back slightly in his chair, one hand resting on the table while the other cradled his tea. His expression was calm, casual, even a little amused.

""It's good to see you again, Wickston. It’s been like what? Ten years? Crazy…""

Johann—Wickston?—snorted in response, shaking his head before taking another sip of coffee.

""I know, right? Crazy how time went by so fast I didn’t even goddamn notice… yet here you are, looking like you haven’t aged a damn day.""

They both let out a small chuckle. The sound was lighthearted, familiar, two veterans reminiscing about old times. But to me, it was downright surreal.

Just how deep did their history go?

And more importantly—what the hell were we supposed to do now?

I stole a glance at Ch’en. She was still fidgeting, but her gaze had sharpened, her mind likely racing through a dozen different plans, none of which seemed applicable to the sheer absurdity unfolding before us.

Meanwhile, the two men kept talking, their words laced with an unsettling kind of ease. ""Wait, so you’re staying here in Lungmen from now on? Is the Columbian sky too bright for you?""

Johann chuckled, shaking his head again.

""Call me crazy, but having so many familiar faces knowing you back home wasn’t really fun when you’re retired from the game. Kinda got tired of it, y’know?""

As he spoke, he gestured loosely with one hand—mimicking a knife across the throat, the universal sign for murder.

Ch’en tensed beside me. I felt my own fingers twitch.

It was casual.

Too casual.

They spoke about their pasts with the same ease as two office workers discussing an old job—except their ""job"" had involved taking lives at some point.

This was not a normal thing to talk about in public.

And yet, here they were, just two men having a drink, as if the past didn’t weigh on them at all.

I swallowed hard.

Just what kind of shenanigan we’re dealing with?

Ch’en gave me a quick side-eye, her fingers tapping restlessly against the table’s surface. She was feeling it too—the sheer absurdity of the situation, the fact that our two supposed marks were just casually chilling and reminiscing like a pair of old men in a retirement home.

“So… uh, ██████?” Johannn’s voice snapped me back to the conversation. “Or should I go with that other name?”

He had just used his real name. The name that I actually knew him for months. The one I had always spoken to in front of others.

The man across from Johann let out a low chuckle, shaking his head slightly. “Just use ██████. That other name is too foreign for me, brother.”

Brother? I exchanged a quick glance with Ch’en, who looked just as lost as I was.

These two… knew each other. Not just in passing, not just as acquaintances, but enough that they were on a first-name basis.

Just how deep did this rabbit hole go?

Johann smirked and leaned back slightly, swirling what remained of his coffee in the cup. “Heard you uncovered some plot in Great Yan. Care to spill the tea?”

A dad joke—really? Now?

██████ sighed, taking a slow sip of his oolong tea before replying. “Eh, I just went there to teach some old martial arts. Then I beat up some organized bandits calling themselves ‘Shiangdong’ or something like that.”

Johann let out a quiet chuckle, nodding as if that was the most normal thing to say.

“Long story short,” ██████ continued, “the government already knew a thing or two about their movements. My ‘involvement’ just made them monitor the group more closely.”

I felt a headache forming.

So, let me get this straight:

This man—who I had last seen, who I knew as someone with a past but never got the full details on—went to Great Yan… fought an small criminal organization… and got recognized by the government for it?!

""Wait…did he mean the Shiangdong bandit? The ones that have been smuggling artifacts across the borders for decades?"" Ch’en finally spoke, her voice low but incredulous.

And he just dropped that information like he was talking about fixing a damn roof?!

I gritted my teeth and resisted the urge to slam my head against the table.

Ch’en looked just about ready to do the same.

......

The two men sat in a comfortable silence for a moment, the ambient noise of the coffee shop filling the space between them. The quiet hum of conversation, the occasional clinking of glassware, and the faint melody of some soundtrack playing through the speakers created an oddly serene atmosphere, a stark contrast to the tension that had been in the air earlier.

Johann then glanced at his watch and let out a small sigh. “Well, look at the time… Man, it sure flies when you’re having fun, for real,” he mused.

Ch’en and I instinctively glanced at the clock hanging on the cafe wall. It was already 6 p.m. The sky outside had begun its gradual shift to deep blues and purples, the neon signs outside flickering to life as the streets of Lungmen began their nightly transformation.

“Yeah, you heading out now?” ██████ asked, finishing the last sip of his tea.

“Yeah, gotta go home soon, buddy,” Johann replied, pushing himself up from his seat. “I’ll catch up with you later.”

As he stood, he casually adjusted the collar of his jacket before stepping beside ██████. Without missing a beat, the two men exchanged a perfectly synchronized dap—a smooth, effortless motion that spoke of years of familiarity.

Ch’en and I watched the silent exchange, still unsure of what to make of their dynamic.

Then, just as Johann reached the door, he suddenly turned his head toward Ch’en, locking eyes with her for a brief second.

And then—he winked.

Ch’en’s posture stiffened slightly, her expression flashing with a mix of surprise and irritation.

She quickly recovered, but I didn’t miss the slight, almost imperceptible pink tinge that dusted her cheeks.

Without waiting for a response, she followed after Johann, stepping briskly out of the cafe and disappearing into the streets.

……

Well, today was eventful, to say the least.

I had started my day as usual—waking up early, taking a quiet stroll through the city as the morning mist still clung to the streets, grabbing some breakfast from a small food stall tucked away in a hidden alley. Then I returned to my rented house to rest for a bit before heading out again in the evening.

What I did not expect, however, was to somehow bump into practically everyone I had ties with in the span of just a few hours.

It was downright absurd. Like fate had decided to throw all the people from my past and present into the same café at the same time just to mess with me.

As I turned the corner to my street, I heard a familiar voice calling out from across the road.

“Tal? I didn’t know you were staying here.”

I blinked, looking up to see ██████ standing in front of a warehouse, casually unlocking the door with several grocery bags at his feet. The dim street lights cast long shadows around him, making the moment feel strangely surreal.

“Huuuuh?? How come?” I blurted out, momentarily caught off guard.

He raised an eyebrow at my reaction but simply shrugged. “I’m making dinner tonight. Wanna join?” His tone was casual, as if this was the most natural thing in the world.

I hesitated for a second, still processing the sheer coincidence of all this, before sighing in resignation. “Uhh, sure. Let me get a shower first, then I’ll swing by.”

“Sounds good. Don’t take too long, though. Food’s not gonna wait for you.”

With that, he disappeared into the warehouse, leaving me standing there for a moment longer before shaking my head and heading inside my own place.

Yep. Today was definitely one for the books.

After closing the door behind me, I let out a long sigh, pressing my back against the wooden surface. What were the odds? Out of all the places in Lungmen, out of all the streets I could have walked down, I just happened to live near him.

I shook my head in disbelief as I peeled off my coat and tossed it onto a chair. Today had already been full of surprises, and now this?

Still, I was not about to turn down a free meal.

......

I knocked once before pushing it open. “Hope you’re not making anything weird,” I called out as I stepped in.

██████ glanced up from the kitchen counter, already setting ingredients on the table. “What, you don’t trust my cooking?”

I raised an eyebrow. “After what happened in Victoria? Absolutely not.”

He sighed dramatically, shaking his head. “That was one time.”

“And I still have nightmares,” I shot back, smirking.

He chuckled, motioning for me to take a seat. “Relax. Tonight, I’m making something actually edible.”

I scoffed but took my place at the table anyway. “I’ll believe it when I see it.”

He rolled his eyes but didn’t argue, instead focusing on preparing the ingredients. I watched as he moved around the small kitchen space with practiced ease, the rhythmic chopping of vegetables filling the warehouse with a strangely comforting sound.

""So,"" I said, leaning back in my chair, ""what exactly are you making?""

██████ didn’t look up as he replied, ""Something simple. Stir-fried vegetables, some braised fowl breast, and steak. Nothing fancy, but it'll do the job.""

The warehouse itself was surprisingly neat—well, neater than I expected for someone like him. The shelves were stacked with various supplies, a few crates pushed against the walls, and a small couch in the corner that looked well-worn but comfortable. It had a lived-in feel, the kind of place that belonged to someone who had been in too many places but never settled in any of them. Not to mention, that suspiciously lot of firearms on the table nearby.

After a few minutes of comfortable silence, he spoke again, his voice quieter this time.

“Glad to see you’re doing alright, by the way.”

I blinked, caught off guard by the sincerity in his tone.

I hesitated for a moment before replying, “Yeah… you too.”

He glanced over at me, giving a small nod before turning back to the stove.

For the first time in a long while, I felt something settle in my chest—a quiet, steady warmth that I hadn’t realized I had been missing.

Maybe tonight would not be so bad after all, maybe I should do something extra after this…

Using Etsy affiliate links on Pinterest can open a world of opportunities for promoting unique products while earning a commission. If you want to leverage Pinterest effectively for your Etsy affiliate marketing, you need to adopt some strategic practices. Here’s how you can make the most of your efforts.

### Understanding Your Audience

The first step to effectively promote Etsy affiliate links on Pinterest is to understand your audience. Knowing who they are and what products they love will help you tailor your content. Use Pinterest Analytics to see which pins attract the most engagement. This information can guide you toward creating similar content that resonates with your target demographic.

### Creating Eye-catching Pins

Visual appeal on Pinterest is everything. Ensure your pins are high-quality and colorful, increasing the chances of clicks and shares. Here are some tips for creating eye-catching pins:

Claim Here: https://digitalgooglyus.com/how-to-use-etsy-affiliate-link-on-pinterest  
  
- **High-resolution images:** Use clear, bright images that highlight the products effectively.
- **Text overlays:** Include engaging text overlays on your images to explain the value or uniqueness of the item.
- **Brand consistency:** Maintain a consistent style that aligns with your brand. This helps in building recognition.

### Utilizing Pinterest SEO

Optimizing your pins for Pinterest’s search engine is crucial. Use relevant keywords in your pin descriptions, titles, and image file names. For Etsy products, think about what potential customers might be searching for. Incorporate phrases like ""handmade jewelry,"" ""custom mugs,"" or ""vintage home decor."" This will help your pins get discovered more easily.

### Strategic Pinning Techniques

Consistency is key when it comes to pinning. You should regularly share new content as well as repin older posts that are still relevant. Here are additional techniques to enhance your pinning strategy:

- **Engage with other pinners:** Like, comment, and repin others’ content. This can help widen your reach and attract followers who may be interested in your affiliate products.

### Crafting Compelling Descriptions

Each pin should have a detailed description that includes your Etsy affiliate link. Tell your audience why they need the product and how it can benefit them. Use active voice and keep it conversational. For example, instead of saying, “This mug can be used for coffee,” you might say, “Enjoy your morning coffee with this stylish mug that brightens your day.”

### Encouraging Click-Throughs

The ultimate goal is to get viewers to click your affiliate links. Use a clear call-to-action (CTA) in your pin descriptions. Phrases like “Shop now,” “Discover more,” or “Don’t miss out” can motivate users to take action. Make sure your CTA is appealing and creates a sense of urgency.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Creating engaging pins is essential for driving traffic to your Etsy affiliate links. The right pin can capture attention, inspire clicks, and ultimately lead to sales. Here are some best practices to help you create eye-catching and effective pins for your Etsy affiliate links.

### Understand Your Audience

Before you start designing, it's vital to know who your audience is. Are they looking for unique gifts, home decor, or handmade jewelry? Tailoring your pins to the interests and needs of your target audience can boost engagement significantly. Consider creating buyer personas to guide your content creation.

### Visual Appeal is Key

The visual aspect of your pins can't be overstated. Aim for vibrant colors and high-quality images. Here are some tips:

- Use vertical images as they take up more space on Pinterest, capturing the viewer's eye.
- Incorporate bold text overlays that clearly convey the message or product being promoted.
- Ensure your images are well-lit and showcase the products effectively.

### Optimize Descriptions

Your pin descriptions are just as important as the images. Here are some strategies:

- Include relevant keywords that your target audience might search for. For instance, if you’re promoting handmade soap, keywords might include ""natural soap,"" ""artisanal bath products,"" or ""eco-friendly gifts.""
- Keep your descriptions informative but concise. Use bullet points to highlight key features or benefits of the products.
- Don’t forget your Etsy affiliate link. Make sure it's included in the description so users can easily access it.

### Consistency in Branding

Maintaining a consistent brand aesthetic across all your pins helps reinforce your brand's identity. Use similar colors, fonts, and styles in your pin designs. This not only makes your pins more recognizable but also builds trust with your audience. Consistency can improve click-through rates by creating a sense of familiarity.

### Engage with Your Audience

Interaction is crucial on social platforms. Respond to comments, engage with followers, and even collaborate with other pinners. Creating a sense of community can lead to more interactions and share your pins further. Consider asking a question in your pin descriptions to encourage comments.

### Utilize Rich Pins

Rich Pins provide more context about an idea because they include extra information directly on the pin. For Etsy sellers, using Product Pins can drive significant traffic. These pins automatically sync with your Etsy shop, providing real-time information about pricing, availability, and product descriptions. By making it easier for users to find what they’re looking for, you can increase conversions.

### Analyze Performance

Pay attention to your Pinterest Analytics to see which pins drive the most traffic to your Etsy affiliate links. Look at the following metrics:

- Engagement rates: See which pins get the most saves and clicks.
- Click-through rates: Determine how effectively your pins lead users to your Etsy links.
- Audience demographics: Understand who is engaging with your content and tailor your approach accordingly.

### Create Seasonal Pins

Taking advantage of seasonal trends can boost your visibility. Create pins that align with holidays or events relevant to your products. For example, if you're promoting handmade ornaments, create festive pins leading up to Christmas. This can help you tap into increased search volume during peak times.

### Experiment with Video Pins

Video pins are an increasingly popular format that can stand out in users' feeds. You might show product demonstrations, behind-the-scenes looks at the creation process, or even customer testimonials. Video content tends to engage users more effectively, leading to higher click-through rates to your Etsy links.

With creativity and consistency, you can turn your Pinterest presence into a valuable asset for your affiliate marketing efforts.

Engagement is key, so don't shy away from crafting informative descriptions that showcase the value of the products.

1izt2uj,https://www.reddit.com/r/findapath/comments/1izt2uj/what_do_i_do_about_extremely_low_motivation/,What do I do about extremely low motivation?,"Hi all! This might be a bit long. 

TLDR: I am struggling hardcore with low motivation at work. I’ve tried a bunch of things to feel better, but now im thinking maybe I need to go back to school or take time off - both of those choices have downsides though. 

Some context: early 30s, single, no kids, 2 pets, renter, mid-range COLA

I have been struggling with low motivation for a long time. Like probably 5 years (I graduated into the pandemic and have worked in my field ever since). I have been in therapy, I’ve taken psych and other medical meds for underlying conditions. I’ve switched jobs. I’ve switched locations. I got the highest paid job I’ve ever had. And still, I just feel bored and unmotivated at work. I spend a lot of my free time sort of zoned out and exhausted. 

I’m embarrassed that I got an MS for my field (and LOVED my grad program), that I have a good job, and that I don’t want it because I truly realize how fortunate I am. It took me a  *long* time to get here. I think some people at work might think that I’m “slow” because I don’t get very much done. It’s like I’ve lost the will to work. 

There are some practical reasons I don’t like my job: long commute 3 days/week  (too expensive to live closer), overbearing supervisor and coworker, no windows, bureaucratic nonsense, tasks aren’t my favorite. 

I look for new jobs every day, but I don’t want any of them. I have also been considering going back to school to either expand my abilities in my current field or move in a different direction, but I am worried about taking on more student loans.

I fantasize about living off my savings for a few months and working at a coffee shop, but I don’t have a ton saved, so that would be pretty risky for me. 

I want some kind of guarantee that my next step will lead to better life satisfaction :
- maybe going back to school will help me get a job that’s more aligned with my interests
- maybe taking a break will give me a clear head

I am tired of living with the shame of being unmotivated. I know I am a capable person.

If anyone has any sage advice that could help me figure out my next steps, I would appreciate it.

The very first to officially register with the TTB as “American Single Malt Whiskey”

Distilled in New Iberia, Louisiana 

Mashbill: 100% 6-row distiller’s malt 
Maltster: TexMalt

Length of fermentation: 4-5 days 

Type of still: 300 liter reflux 

Still manufacturer: Affordable Distillery Equipment 

Proof off the still: 140
Barrel entry proof: 124
Bottling proof: 128.8

Barrel No. 33

Barrel manufacturer: Barrel Mill (Minnesota)

Barrel size: 10 gallon

Barrel type: Ex-bourbon that previously held Distillerie Acadian Cajun’s Cut bourbon 

Age: 3+ years in the Gulf of Mexico heat 

MSRP: $65

Nose 👃: Butterscotch. Coffee beans. Currants. Almond butter.

Palate 👅: Nilla Wafer. Nutmeg. Nutella. Coconut. Barrel char.

Finish 🏁: Vanilla. Three Musketeers bar. Cinnamon. Extremely long in length.

Distillerie Acadian was the first to officially claim a COLA with the TTB as American Single Malt Whiskey, yet they also made the choice to stop distilling more.  Once the existing barrels are gone… so is this historic offering.

I’m legitimately happy with this ASMW aged in a used 10 gallon barrel. I’m not sure that I would feel the same about aging for three years in a new barrel in the heat on the Gulf of Mexico. The lesser intensity of the used barrel works nicely.  No complaints at all.

1izszt2,https://www.reddit.com/r/SeveranceAppleTVPlus/comments/1izszt2/neotrinity_vs_markhelly/,Neo/Trinity vs. Mark/Helly,"This idea has been on my mind for a few days now.  

Is Lumon taking advantage of Mark and Gemma’s emotional connection in a way similar to how the real-world machines in The Matrix Resurrections exploit Neo and Trinity’s bond?  

For those unfamiliar with the latest Matrix movie, one of its premises is that keeping Neo and Trinity lyings unconscious in pods, close enough but without touching, generates a huge amount of energy due to their  amazing emotional connection, which the machines harness.  

I think Lumon is doing something similar with Mark and Gemma. It uses the drama/romance that Mark experiences internally to make his work exceptionally good, which is why he is the right person to complete Cold Harbor, somehow linked to emotions, just like the ""scary numbers"" are. Keeping a version of Gemma so close, along with their wellness sessions, allows Mark to channel that energy into his work at a subconscious level, without even knowing why that os that way. 

In fact, in The Matrix Resurrections, in this new restarted version of the Matrix, Neo and Trinity meet in a coffee shop and seem to like each other, but they don’t know who they really are because they have new identities. Yet, their emotional connection appears to have survived the reset.  
I remember that in Ms. Casey’s last wellness session with Mark, she hints that she feels good being near him. In fact, right after that, Cobel sends her to the testing floor.  

The presence of codes and numbers, understood only by a select few, in both shows makes this crazy parallel beings idea even clearer to me.

Apparently, Mark is the only one who see ""the matrix"" uncoded in Cold Harbor mission :)",0,1740696934.0,SeveranceAppleTVPlus,2,0.45,False

1izsz5g,https://www.reddit.com/r/italianlearning/comments/1izsz5g/my_experience_as_a_first_time_n00b_in_italy_3rd/,My experience as a first time n00b in Italy. 3rd night in Rome so far,"First, the important bit: I could not be having any more fun if I tried.

I've been very casually learning Italian for a little less than two years. Casual meaning one, maybe two Duolingo lessons a day, with the occasional Mango lesson. I find Mango much more useful for learning, but Duolingo annoys me into remembering to practice at least once a day.

I tried iTalki and didn't find a teacher I vibed with. I paid for a year of Anki and couldn't get into it (which is probably on me not taking the time to learn it, but it's daunting for a beginner to figure out what the heck I'm supposed to do with it). I tried the WellesleyX edX course, which looked promising but I didn't love it for a variety of reasons.

The thing that was most useful to me I only found recently: Natulang. I know everyone learns differently, but the all-speaking format really works for me. I've been doing at least one lesson a day and learned a lot.

But anyway, on to my experience:

1. I understand a LOT more Italian than I gave myself credit for. I'm at a point where I can infer sentences when I read, even if I don't know all the words. I did not expect that.
2. I found I was able to ask for anything I needed, but often unable to parse the response. From today: ""Vorrei un tavolo per due, per favore."" \*miss the first part of the response as my brain tries to switch to listening\* ""...adesso..."" \*spend the rest of his response trying to remember what adesso means, because it was just in my last lesson\*
3. Whenever this happened, the Italian person would seamlessly switch to English, which would usually shock my brain into staying in English for the rest of the conversation.
4. If someone switched to English with me, I didn't try to force the issue into Italian, unless it was something I was very confident in. Mostly I'm speaking to people who are trying to do a job, and they're not my personal tutors. Out of respect for them, I'll just try again next time.
5. Everyone has been immensely kind and patient with my dumbassery. Which relates to #2 and #3, as the incredibly kind host put my name on a waiting list, and when I offered my last name he laughed and said he'd remember me. When we came back in an hour, he immediately smiled at me and said ""Ecco Joe! Vero?""
6. It takes a little while to pick up on how locals do things, but usually hanging back and watching for a bit will answer any questions. For example, getting coffee at a bar in Trastevere required telling the cashier what I wanted and paying, then bringing the ticket to the bar and telling the barista what I just paid for.
7. Being from NYC made it a lot easier to ignore all of the street salespeople and tour hawkers.
8. The churches are more spectacular than I could have imagined, and I'm a lifelong atheist.
9. THERE'S A CAT SANCTUARY
10. Ruins are literally everywhere you look, often hidden in plain sight.

There's my top 10 takeaways. I know you all know this, but I figure someone else in my position might be interested to read it.
