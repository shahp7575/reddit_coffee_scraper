1h8r7ya,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating_advice/comments/1h8r7ya/did_i_misread_the_signals/,Did I misread the signals?..,"Hello,

I (28M) and her (F34) met in work and work together in the same department for over 3 years and of those years, 2 of them after the first was when we got to know eachother on a deeper level

We have eachother on all socials and text/snapchat everyday holding a streak and send memes.

At first we were colleagues.. now we are close friends... (I hope)

We went on road trips, at the start it was a group 3.. as time went on we started hanging out together just the 2 of us... going shopping... getting food.. coffee.. cinema.... just the 2 of us... and we would do it without telling anyone and would do it in private. However we never labelled it as anything it was like a mutual agreement to go together.. 

This went on for some time... and eventually I found myself being loyal to her... she would be the first person I think of before falling asleep... the first person I think of when I wake up... the person who would pop into my mind when I see something in the shop.. the feelings started to grow stronger and stronger ....Heck I still remember when I was in a bar and some other girl took my hand during a conversation and I remember feeling so wrong because she immediately popped into my mind when it happened..

I would get her favourite snack/food when she comes with me in my car just to see her smile and be happy... again still no label.. no intentions... no moves were being made.. When we hang out... she would say.. 'my mom said hi to you' and I would tell her to give a 'Hi' back for me and I would ask her how her mom is..

When we talk to eachother we would gaze into eachothers eyes closely.. I can see her eyes dilate sometimes... in a group setting when someone makes a joke...we would look at eachother first to see eachothers reaction... she would unintentionally mimic my posture at the table... we look out for eachother in work and outside of work...

Even on her holidays.. she would still message me to tell me about her day and or keep the streak.. so to me I felt special...(at least I hope she didn't feel like she had to do it)

So eventually the 'What ifs' crept into my mind and started to take over... over 1 year of living in the 'What ifs' the imaginary land of scenarios that anyone would wish for to come true...

I couldn't hold it in anymore so I had to ask her knowing well enough that i would get rejected.. but if I never ask I will never know... and if I never know... I will just live in regret...

So I asked..""Have you ever thought about us being together?'

Her immediate response 'I think we are better as friends'

There was no stutter, the words were sharp and the sentence was clear.

I was immediately teleported back to reality..everything shattered...but I still hold my head up high acting as if nothing happened... in one way I'm happy I spoke up and gave clear intentions... on the other hand reality is harsh..

So after that, I think she's mad or angry at me... feeling a little awkward... and uncomfortable... but in work... I acted like nothing happened.. putting on a mask for her sake... talking and treating her the same... for her.

Yes, it hurts me deeply on the inside... how could I let myself get so attached yet it was so easy for her to toss me (or at least that's what it feels like) ... but.... I still want her to be as happy as she can be.. even if it's not with me because she deserves the world... and I was prepared to give her that... she is the person I want to build a future with.. but we all know its a 2 way street and it requires 2 people.. 

So as of now... there's delay messages... the seen 7 hours ago... probably going to be more and might get ghosted etc etc... 

Am I just too committed? 

Or is there genuinely something wrong with me? 

I have my thoughts about some of the answers as I do reflect a lot but I just want that assurance...

I am willing to accept the pain to hear the answer in person rather than playing games all the time..

I would like to hear your opinion of me..

TL;DR;
2 years of friendship, frequent hangouts, just 2 of us, no label, no intentions, asked her 'Have you ever thought about us being together?' Immediate response 'I think we are better as friends'. Her mom knows about me and we say Hi to eachother through her

All I want is for her to be happy, even if it's not with me..I have that much respect for her

Did I (28M) commit too much? 

Is she (34F) afraid? (I know her last relationship was when she was 20 and from then she focused on her studies and career)

Or is there genuinely something wrong with me?

At first, I struggled with the recipes I found online until I tried the 4:6 method. It immediately produced the best cup I had brewed on the V60, and I’ve been able to get consistent, good results with it.

After sticking with the 4:6 method for about a month, I decided to try some other recipes, like the Hoffmann 1-cup method, a few of Lance Hendrick’s recipes, and some recommendations from other brewers. However, I ran into the same issues I had before, sometimes the coffee was over-extracted, sometimes under-extracted, and overall it felt very inconsistent.

I’m trying to figure out what makes the 4:6 method work so well for me. I’m grinding a bit coarser than usual, and I know the water ratio is slightly different, but neither of these variables seems to make a difference outside of the 4:6 method.

It’s not a huge issue since I’m getting great results with 4:6, but I’m curious to know

Losing **20 pounds in one month** is a highly ambitious goal, and it requires extreme dedication. While it’s possible to achieve rapid weight loss, it's essential to understand that this pace may not be sustainable or healthy in the long run. Losing weight too quickly can lead to muscle loss, nutrient deficiencies, dehydration, and other health issues. However, if you’re determined to try, here’s a guide on [how to lose 20 pounds in one month](https://www.buywhatever.net/search/label/Weight-Loss-Formula) through diet and exercise. **Remember to consult a healthcare provider** before making significant changes to your diet or exercise routine, especially if you're aiming for such an aggressive goal.

# How to Lose 20 Pounds in One Month: The Basics

To lose 20 pounds in 30 days, you need to create a **caloric deficit** — burning more calories than you consume. A general rule is that losing 1 pound of fat requires a **3,500-calorie deficit**. To lose 20 pounds, you'd need a total deficit of **70,000 calories** over the course of the month, or approximately **2,333 calories per day**. This is an extremely high deficit and not typically recommended, so aiming for a safe but aggressive deficit is key.

Here’s how to break it down:

# 1. Caloric Deficit and Diet

To achieve rapid weight loss, you need to drastically reduce your calorie intake while still fueling your body with enough nutrients to function. Here are some strategies:

# Extreme Caloric Restriction

* **Target Calories**: Aim for a **very low-calorie diet (VLCD)** of about **1,200–1,500 calories per day** for women and **1,500–1,800 calories per day** for men. This is significantly below the typical daily caloric intake for most people, but it can help you [**lose weight quickly**](https://igli.me/weightlformula)**.** However, this should be done with caution.
* **Nutrient-Dense Foods**: Even with a calorie deficit, you need to ensure you're getting the right nutrients. Focus on foods that are low in calories but high in essential nutrients:
   * **Lean Proteins**: Chicken, turkey, fish, tofu, and eggs are great sources that help preserve muscle mass.
   * **Non-Starchy Vegetables**: Broccoli, spinach, kale, cauliflower, and zucchini. They are low in calories but high in fiber, which helps you stay full.
   * **Healthy Fats**: Avocado, olive oil, and nuts can help you feel satiated without excessive calories.
   * **Complex Carbs**: If you do include carbs, opt for whole grains like quinoa, brown rice, and sweet potatoes, but keep portions small to stay within your calorie limit.

# Eliminate Processed Foods & Sugar

* Cut out all **refined carbs**, processed snacks, sugary drinks, and alcohol. These foods are calorie-dense and provide little nutritional value.
* Avoid **sugary beverages** (sodas, fruit juices) and opt for water, herbal tea, or black coffee.

# Consider Intermittent Fasting (IF)

* **Intermittent fasting** can help you restrict your eating window, which might make it easier to eat fewer calories. A popular method is **16:8**, where you fast for 16 hours and eat within an 8-hour window. This helps reduce overall calorie intake.

# Hydration

* Drink **lots of water** — aim for at least 8–10 cups per day. Staying hydrated is important for overall health and can help reduce feelings of hunger.
* **Green tea** or other herbal teas may also help with fat burning.

# 2. Exercise Plan

Exercise is crucial to losing weight quickly while preserving muscle mass. Combining both **cardio** and **strength training** is essential.

# Cardio (High-Intensity)

To burn fat quickly, focus on high-intensity cardio. This increases your heart rate and helps you burn more calories in less time.

* **HIIT (High-Intensity Interval Training)**: This involves alternating between short bursts of intense activity and brief periods of rest. HIIT can burn a lot of calories in a short time (20–30 minutes), and it keeps your metabolism elevated even after your workout.
* **Examples of HIIT**: Jump squats, sprints, burpees, mountain climbers, and jump rope.
* Aim for **5–6 days of cardio** per week, with at least **30–60 minutes per session**.

# Strength Training (Weightlifting)

Strength training is crucial for **preserving lean muscle mass** during rapid weight loss. The more muscle you have, the more calories you burn at rest.

* **Full-body workouts** using free weights, resistance bands, or bodyweight exercises like squats, lunges, push-ups, and planks are effective.
* Focus on **compound movements** (like deadlifts, squats, and bench presses) that work multiple muscle groups at once.
* Aim for **3–4 strength training sessions per week**.

# Increase Daily Activity

In addition to structured exercise, increase your general daily activity. Some ways to do this:

* **Take the stairs** instead of the elevator.
* **Walk more**: Aim for 10,000–12,000 steps a day.
* **Stretch and move** regularly to avoid a sedentary lifestyle, which can slow down weight loss.

# 3. Sleep and Stress Management

* **Sleep**: Lack of sleep can negatively impact weight loss by increasing hunger hormones like ghrelin. Aim for **7–9 hours of quality sleep** per night.
* **Stress**: Chronic stress can lead to emotional eating and weight gain, particularly around the abdomen. Practice stress-reduction techniques like meditation, deep breathing, yoga, or taking short walks.

# 4. Supplements (Optional)

While not necessary, some people turn to supplements to support their weight loss efforts. [Fat burners](https://igli.me/weightlformula) and **appetite suppressants** can be used cautiously to curb hunger and slightly boost metabolism, but they should not replace a healthy diet and exercise routine.

* **Caffeine** (through coffee or supplements) may help boost metabolism.
* **Green tea extract** may promote fat loss through increased thermogenesis.
* **Protein powders** can be helpful to meet your daily protein needs, especially if you're exercising heavily.

# Important Considerations:

* **Health Risks**: Rapid weight loss often comes with risks such as muscle loss, nutrient deficiencies, and metabolic slowdown. Always consult a doctor or dietitian before attempting extreme weight loss methods, especially one as aggressive as losing 20 pounds in a month.
* **Sustainability**: This level of rapid weight loss is not sustainable in the long run. Once you return to a normal eating pattern, the weight may come back quickly. Focus on creating healthy habits that you can maintain after the month is over.
* **Mental and Emotional Health**: Quick weight loss can be mentally and emotionally taxing. Make sure you are mentally prepared and avoid negative self-talk. Having a support system or working with a coach or trainer can help.

# Final Thoughts

Losing 20 pounds in one month is not recommended for most people, as it requires extreme measures that can jeopardize your health. While rapid weight loss may help you fit into a dress temporarily, it's important to focus on sustainable, healthy changes for long-term success. If you're looking for faster weight loss, combining a strict, low-calorie diet with intense exercise may help, but remember that it should be done with caution and ideally under professional supervision.",2,1733573120.0,WeightLossFormula,0,1.0,False

Also, to open its full flavour, it needs resting for at least 2 weeks. Once past 2 weeks, it’s a remarkably beautiful coffee w/ delicate floral & sweet notes.

I’ve brewed this rose coffee as espresso, Aeropress, & pourover. Honestly, it shines the most in Aeropress when brewed at 88-92°C w/ a coarse grind. The flavors really open up, offering a smooth, balanced cup. As espresso, it’s surprisingly sweet - almost unbelievably so for an espresso - w/ a bit more acidity compared to the pourover & Aeropress brews.

Also, Interestingly as this coffee cools down, the sweetness & acidity seem to increase slightly, adding a whole new layer to the flavor profile.",4,1733573096.0,IndiaCoffee,0,1.0,False

The shot pulled a little more quickly than I'd have liked and there was a bit of channelling spray at the end... But when I tasted the result, I got the waft of sweetness and the texture and flavour were exactly what I've been chasing for a while. The only bad thing about this is that I'll be extremely disappointed when it goes wrong again. It's a horrible, stormy Saturday and I have to go out for a gig later, but I feel ready for it now.

As her sister and daughter of our parents, ang heavy sa dibdib na ang bastos ng kapatid ko sa mom ko. Mother ko ang nags-shoulder ng tuition ng anak nya at never siya nag initiate na tumulong kahit household chores man lang. My sister’s always grumpy. Nakasigaw sa anak. Nakasigaw sa parents ko kapag nauutusan siya like magluto, o maghugas man lang ng pinggan. She’s a madman kapag may time na siya ang maggguide sa study ng anak nya. Laging mom namin ang nagtututor sa pamangkin ko. From assignments, follow ups, review to projects, mom ko yon. Aside from that, nakatira kami sa bahay ng parents namin, wala siyang share pati foods nilang mag-ina at bills..Wala namang problema don. Shinoshoulder ko ang lahat ng bills then mom ko sa food. Kapag may extra pa ako, nagsshare ako sa food..again, agos lang sakin at sa mom ko yon..pero sana as an ate maisip man lang nya na tulungan ang mom ko pagdating sa household chores..yun lang. Wala ng iba. 

Simula bata pa kami, palasagot na kapatid ko, at ngayong lumaki na ko, ngayon ko narealize at ngayon ko nakita ang effect sakin ng ganong ugali nya. Because of her attitude and character, lagi silang nagkakasagutan ng mom ko. Lagi ko yon naririnig. Nakakarindi. Nakakapagod. Nakakasawa. 

Akala ko kapag matanda na kami parehas ng ate ko, maiispoil na namin ang parents namin. Pero hindi pala..hanggang pastries, coffee, decent meals from fastfoods, affordable restaurants pa lang ang kaya ko at least 2x a year..Kaya lately, naiisip kong nag-abroad. Baka that way, maspoil ko ang parents ko. Deserve na deserve ng mom ko ang mabigyan sya ng all paid trip kung san man nya gusto pumunta dahil sa pagtaguyod nya samin. My dad is toxic too.. Kaya nasstress rin ako dahil I can’t provide yung mga gusto kong maprovide sa mom ko. 

Nakakapagod pala umintindi nang umintindi sa ugali ng iba. Nakakapagod din umunawa. Nakakapagod ang sigawan. Nakakatakot na konting kibot lang, loud voices ang nag roar sa bahay.. 

Mahirap pala magkaroon ng happy family. ",2,1733572938.0,OffMyChestPH,1,1.0,False

1h8r02e,https://www.reddit.com/r/u_erepresent/comments/1h8r02e/maximize_sales_with_a_highquality_commercial/,Maximize Sales with a High-Quality Commercial Slush Puppie Machine,"In today’s competitive foodservice industry, finding innovative ways to attract customers and increase revenue is essential. Offering unique, fun, and refreshing products is one way to stand out from the competition, and few things are as universally loved as slush drinks. These colorful, sweet, and chilled beverages are perfect for customers looking to cool down or enjoy a tasty treat. If you’re in the food and beverage business and want to offer something that will keep customers coming back for more, investing in a **commercial slush puppie machine** is an excellent choice.

A **commercial slush puppie machine** can transform your business by providing a high-margin product that appeals to all ages. Whether you run a convenience store, fast food joint, coffee shop, or amusement park, a slushie machine can help maximize sales, enhance customer satisfaction, and drive repeat business. In this comprehensive guide, we’ll explore the ways a high-quality slush machine can help you grow your business, increase your profits, and keep customers coming back for more.

**The Popularity of Slush Drinks**

Slush drinks have maintained their popularity for decades due to their refreshing nature, versatility in flavor, and nostalgic appeal. Whether it's a hot summer day, a fun event, or simply an afternoon craving, people love to enjoy a cold, sweet treat like a slushie. Their vibrant colors and fruity flavors make them visually appealing, while the cool texture offers a satisfying, thirst-quenching experience.

**Widespread Appeal**

What makes slush drinks so special is their broad appeal. People of all ages enjoy them, from kids looking for a sweet treat to adults seeking a refreshing beverage. Additionally, slush drinks can be customized to suit different tastes, from classic fruity flavors like cherry and grape to tropical or exotic combinations like mango, coconut, or pineapple. This flexibility ensures that no matter who walks through your door, there will be a flavor they’ll love.

Slush drinks are also highly marketable. Their visual appeal, swirling colors, and the fun experience of using a straw or spoon to enjoy the drink make them stand out. They’re a treat that customers don’t just want—they also want to share the experience with friends and family, which can help spread the word about your business.

**Profitability of Slush Drinks**

In addition to their popularity, slush drinks are incredibly profitable. Because they require minimal ingredients—usually just flavored syrups and ice—slushies offer high-profit margins. The cost of ingredients is relatively low, and the potential to charge premium prices makes them an excellent product for boosting your business's bottom line.

Moreover, slush drinks can be sold in various sizes, giving you the flexibility to upsell. You can offer small, medium, and large sizes or even provide additional options like extra toppings or customizable flavors, each of which can boost the price. This means that you can cater to different customer preferences while maximizing the value of each sale.

**How a Commercial Slush Puppie Machine Can Transform Your Business**

Investing in a **commercial slush puppie machine** can take your business to the next level. Here’s a breakdown of how a slushie machine can positively impact your operations and revenue:

**1. Increases Customer Traffic**

One of the most immediate effects of adding a slush machine to your business is that it draws customers in. People are naturally attracted to brightly colored, refreshing drinks, and having a slushie machine in your establishment creates a visual point of interest. Whether your customers are just walking by or are already inside your store, the presence of a **commercial slush puppie machine** can spark curiosity and encourage them to make a purchase.

Slushies are a fun product, and the visual appeal of a swirling slush drink is often enough to tempt passersby. The addition of a slush machine can be a strong marketing tool that helps generate foot traffic and keep customers inside your store longer, increasing the likelihood of additional purchases.

**2. Quick Service and High Volume Output**

A **commercial slush puppie machine** allows you to produce slush drinks quickly, which is essential for high-volume sales. Slush machines are designed to freeze and dispense large quantities of slush at once, which means you won’t be limited by slow preparation times or long waiting periods during busy hours. This capability allows you to serve more customers faster, reducing wait times and improving the overall customer experience.

As a result, slushies become a highly efficient product that doesn’t slow down your operations. Customers can get their refreshing drinks with minimal delay, and your business can keep up with high demand without overloading staff or sacrificing quality.

**3. Low Labor Costs**

Another benefit of a **commercial slush puppie machine** is that it minimizes the amount of labor required to prepare the slushies. While traditional beverage-making processes may require a lot of hands-on work, a slushie machine automates most of the process. Once the machine is filled with the appropriate ingredients, it can churn and freeze the mixture automatically, with little to no input from your staff.

This means you won’t need to hire extra employees or have your current team spend valuable time preparing drinks. Additionally, because the machine is easy to operate, staff training is minimal, allowing you to quickly integrate the machine into your daily operations.

**4. Customizable Product Offering**

Slush machines are highly customizable, allowing you to create a wide variety of flavors to suit your customers’ preferences. With a **commercial slush puppie machine**, you can offer classic flavors like cherry, grape, and orange, as well as more exotic combinations like mango, watermelon, and even candy-inspired flavors. Customization can be a key factor in making slush drinks a popular choice for your customers.

Moreover, some slush machines allow for mixing flavors, so customers can choose their preferred combination or create their own signature drink. This level of customization makes slush drinks more fun and personal, which increases customer engagement and satisfaction.

**5. Seasonal and Promotional Opportunities**

A commercial slush machine provides an excellent opportunity for seasonal promotions and limited-time offerings. You can create themed flavors for holidays, such as a red-and-green slush for Christmas or a spooky black-and-orange mix for Halloween. These limited-time slush flavors can generate excitement among customers and drive them to your store for a chance to try something new.

By capitalizing on seasonal trends, you can create buzz around your business and keep customers coming back throughout the year. Offering promotions like “Buy One, Get One Free” or discounted slushies during happy hours can also help attract more customers and increase sales.

**Features to Look for in a High-Quality Commercial Slush Puppie Machine**

When choosing the best **commercial slush puppie machine** for your business, it’s important to consider several key features to ensure you get the most out of your investment. A high-quality machine will be efficient, durable, and capable of producing consistent results. Here are the key features to keep in mind:

**1. Capacity and Output**

Consider the volume of slush you expect to sell and the size of your business when selecting a machine. Some machines have single tanks, while others offer multiple tanks, allowing you to serve different flavors simultaneously. The larger your customer base, the higher the output you’ll need. A high-capacity **commercial slush puppie machine** is essential for ensuring you can meet demand during busy periods, such as weekends or special events.

**2. Durability**

Investing in a durable slush machine is crucial, as you want the equipment to last for years. Look for machines made from high-quality materials like stainless steel, which are resistant to rust, corrosion, and wear. Durability is important not just for the longevity of the machine but also for its ability to withstand the high demands of a commercial environment.

**3. Ease of Maintenance**

The easier the machine is to clean and maintain, the less time and money you’ll need to spend on upkeep. Choose a **commercial slush puppie machine** with easy-to-remove components and self-cleaning features, if possible. A machine that’s easy to disassemble and clean will help ensure hygiene standards and prolong the life of the equipment.

**4. Energy Efficiency**

Energy efficiency is a key consideration, especially when you’re running a commercial operation. Look for machines that offer energy-saving features, such as automatic shut-off or temperature regulation, to reduce electricity consumption. A high-energy-efficient machine can help lower your operational costs while maintaining optimal performance.

**5. User-Friendly Controls**

A machine with intuitive controls and an easy-to-read display will make it easier for your staff to operate. Look for machines that allow you to easily adjust settings like mixing time, freezing time, and slush consistency, so you can achieve the perfect slush every time. Simple and user-friendly controls will help minimize errors and improve workflow efficiency.

**How to Maximize the Potential of Your Commercial Slush Puppie Machine**

Once you’ve invested in a **commercial slush puppie machine**, it’s time to make the most of it. Here are several ways you can maximize the potential of your machine and increase sales:

**1. Upsell and Cross-Sell**

Maximize each customer transaction by upselling slush drinks. Offer slushies as an add-on with meals or snacks, or suggest a larger size for just a little more. You can also cross-sell by offering complimentary products, such as chips, snacks, or even dessert items that pair well with slushies.

**2. Offer a Loyalty Program**

Encourage repeat business by offering a loyalty program that rewards customers for their purchases. For example, you could offer a free slush drink after a certain number of purchases or provide discounts for customers who buy multiple drinks in one visit. This strategy helps build customer loyalty and keeps people coming back.

**3. Leverage Social Media**

Promote your slush offerings on social media platforms like Instagram and Facebook. Slush drinks are highly photogenic, and customers will likely share their colorful beverages online. Create engaging posts showcasing your slush varieties and seasonal flavors to attract more customers. You can also run contests or giveaways to further increase your reach.

**4. Track Sales and Adjust Offerings**

Monitor your sales data to identify trends in slush purchases. Are certain flavors more popular at specific times of the year? Are there certain sizes or combinations that sell better than others? Use this information to adjust your offerings and promotions accordingly, optimizing your sales strategy and maximizing profits.

**Conclusion**

Investing in a **commercial slush puppie machine** is one of the smartest decisions you can make to boost sales, enhance customer satisfaction, and grow your business. These machines offer an efficient, high-margin product that has universal appeal, providing a fun and refreshing option for customers. By offering customizable flavors, seasonal promotions, and high-quality service, you can increase foot traffic, drive repeat sales, and create a memorable customer experience that keeps people coming back for more.

Tom Campbell is a physicist who has been acting as head experimentor at the Monroe Institute. He wrote the book \`My Big Toe\`. Toe standing for Theory of Everything. It is HIS Theory of Everything which implies that everybody else can have or develop a deviating Theory of Everything. That would be fine with him. According to Tom Campbell, reality is virtual, not \`real´ in the sense we understand it. To us this does not matter. If we have a cup of coffee, the taste does not change if we understand that the coffee, i.e. the liquid is composed of smaller parts, like little \`balls´, the molecules and the atoms. In the same way the taste of the coffee would not change if we are now introduced to the Virtual Reality Theory. According to him reality is reproduced at the rate of Planck time (10 to the power of 43 times per second). Thus, what we perceive as so-called outer reality is constantly reproduced. It vanishes before it is then reproduced again. And again and again and again. Similar to a picture on a computer screen. And this is basically what Bashar is describing as well. Everything collapses to a zero point. Constantly. And it is reproduced one unit of Planck time later. Just to collapse again and to be again reproduced. And you are constantly in a new universe/multiverse. And all the others as well. There is an excellent video on youtube (Tom Campbell and Jim Elvidge). The book \`My Big ToE´ is downloadable as well. I recommend starting with the video. Each universe is static, but when you move across some of them in a specific order (e.g. nos 5, 10, 15, 20, 25, etc.) you get the impression of movement and experience. Similar to a movie screen. If you change (the vibration of) your belief systems, you have access to frames nos 6, 11, 16, 21, 26 etc. You would then be another person in another universe, having different experiences. And there would be still \`a version of you´ having experiences in a reality that is composed of frames nos. 5, 10, 15, 20, 25 etc. But you are not the other you, and the other you is not you. You are in a different reality and by changing your belief systems consciously you can navigate across realities less randomly and in a more targeted way. That is basically everything the Bashar teachings are about. Plus open contact.",1,1733572773.0,theories,0,1.0,False

So I thought I would maybe start this post as a healthy discussion on our unpopular Beer Opinions we all have them lol because I got one after last night sadly. 

So I brought a 24 case of London Black Nitro Porter because I love Guinness with all my heart and Stout and thought I would try this one since everyone rates it higher than Guinness and haven't tried Porter before which got my attention I am open to support a English Nitro Stout/Porter or a British Stout over Guinness, I tried Blackheart and didn't prefer it didn't hate it just wouldn't buy over Guinness, haven't tried Camden after reading online the reviews, anyway I got home from work and tried my first can in a glass and tbh I didn't actually prefer it to Guinness, tbh I thought it had more flavour was more sweet and definitely strong coffee taste but I still didn't prefer it, I found it less smooth or thick as Guinness and I suppose it comes to prefrence but now I can confirm to myself I way prefer Dry Stout over Porter I was disappointed because I really wanted to love it but if given choice I will choose Guinness just wasn't a fan of the taste I think too plus this morning after 3 cans I got a hangover whilst Guinness never gives me a hangover, only one for me that rivals it is Murphy's which saddly is hard to find or literally impossible, luckily I know Wye Brewery is in early stages to can it's Nightjar Stout which I can't wait for that looks tasty.

1h8qxic,https://www.reddit.com/r/Advice/comments/1h8qxic/my_ex_keeps_reaching_out_about_things_i_have_no/,My ex keeps reaching out about things I have no control over ,"I (M20) broke up with my ex girlfriend (F19) 4 months ago. There were quite a few reasons but one of the biggest was her lack of maturity and inability to communicate effectively. Admittedly when I did end the relationship I was still very attached to her and would reach out to see how she was or what she was thinking about twice a week but after a few weeks of this and her saying she’d never want to be in a relationship with me ever again I just sort of walked away. Of course I still cared about her and missed her but she made it very clear that she really wanted nothing to do with me and was sort of done with the relationship before it even ended. 

Cut to about a month or two later and she asked me why one of my friends liked one of her spam posts on instagram (da fuq)? I told her I have no clue as I am not my friend and he in fact lives an hour and a half from me when I’m at school. Her response to that was just “strange” then “hope you’re doing well” after wards. I waited a few days to respond and just said you too when I did. A few days after that I sent basically a farewell paragraph saying that I really didn’t like receiving texts from her at the time, informed her I was doing well, then told her I’d be blocking her for the foreseeable a future. 

Cut to a few days ago. I went to a coffee shop and bought myself a nice lil drink while I was doing homework. Now at this specific coffee shop her phone number is linked to my card for rewards so she automatically gets them but I didn’t think much of it because I really don’t care. However, a few hours later I got a message from one of her friends asking me to stop using her number to give her the rewards at the coffee shop shop then calling me a creep, weird, and overall crazy (da fuq)? I have no control over the fact that my ex even gets the rewards but she tends to think that I am putting in her number each time to intentionally give her the rewards. 

I then contacted my ex telling her that I’m not in fact doing that then she called me a liar. When I further told her how crazy it would be for me to even do something like that she left me on read. Long story short I legit went down to the coffee shop to get another drink and took a video to show that I wasn’t doing all that (it’s more than she deserved but I was sick of her thinking that I was doing this shit). I sent her the video then told her what the employee told me on how to disconnect the two and asking her to please stop bothering me over this. 

Her sister then called me and threatened me to stop contacting my ex or else she would press charges (da fuq)? I ended up just thumbs upping the message then my ex said she didn’t know her sister would do that and was sorry but said that she really wanted me to stop contacting her and grow up. I informed her that she in fact contacted me first about something I did not do and she just said to please stop contacting her again. Am I missing something here?? Literally what the hell am I supposed to be doing about any of this? I blocked her sister and her friend and her but I really don’t want another random text.

1h8qt4m,https://www.reddit.com/r/offmychest/comments/1h8qt4m/im_not_eating_again/,I'm not eating again,"
I (29F) have struggled with my body for as long as I can remember. I’ve always felt like I wasn’t pretty enough, not fit enough, too fat, or too boring. I had a few bouts with eating disorders as a teen, but they always passed one way or another. Then my life got better, and I even explained to my mother how her toxic comments affected my self-esteem while I was growing up, and I reduced contact with her to a minimum.

But during college, because of long hours spent behind a desk, I gained significant weight. My BMI is 38, and I need to lose 30kg to fall into the higher end of the normal range again. Honestly, it didn’t even bother me that much because I have an amazing fiancé who loves me dearly and is still attracted to me. We’ve had conversations about losing weight and exercising, mainly for health reasons, but I haven’t fallen back into my bad habits. I told him about my issues with food, and he’s very understanding—he even checks to make sure I eat during stressful times.

But the thing is... we’re getting married in a year or two, and I want to look amazing on that day. I know I should diet and exercise, but I work 10-15 hour shifts, 5-6 days a week, and when I’m home, I usually spend time with my fiancé—watching movies, talking, or just hanging out. He’s supposed to take care of the house since he’s currently not working, and I asked him to cook as well. Cooking isn’t rocket science. I love simple meals like stir-fried veggies from frozen mixes with a fried egg on top. Meals with vegetables feel more manageable for me, and there are so many delicious options—soups, curries, salads, and more.

But he doesn’t really cook. To clarify, I give him money for food (as much as I pay for rent), I also do groceries from time to time, yet he only cooks once or twice a week. More often than not, it’s something pre-made from the store, like fries or fried cheese, or takeout. Simple and tasty, sure, but not healthy. I don’t eat bread, so I can’t just make a quick sandwich. Our usual go-to meals are cup noodles with a fried egg on top. That’s also not healthy, and I can’t take it with me to work. Thankfully, I can buy meals at work, but they’re expensive.

I cook occasionally, even though he promised to handle it, and it’s frustrating. I know he has his struggles, but spending two hours a day to buy groceries and make a quick meal, and another two hours twice a week to clean up, shouldn’t be that hard, when he is home all day. We don't have kids or animals that need constant attention (A hamster and two mice that prefer to be left alone), so he really do have time.

But, I was fine, untill last week. Usually, when I talk to my mom, I let my fiancé listen in so we can both roll our eyes at her insanity and laugh at the hypocrisy she spouts every few sentences. This time, I was alone. And something... clicked. I felt like a teenager again, being mocked about my weight. After that, I finished off all the treats I had left and simply stopped eating at work and skipping breakfast. Now, I only drink unsweetened milk tea or coffee to keep my blood pressure up and stop my stomach from growling. At home, I eat whatever he makes, just like normal.

Today, I ""forgot"" to pack a piece of yesterday’s pasta casserole for work, and I’m excited to not eat until 11 p.m. He’ll probably think I bought something like usual. He has no way to find out, unless I confess.

I know it’s not right. It’s childish, and I should know better. But it feels good. I feel like I have control over my body again. It feels great to starve it. I don’t know how long I’ll keep this up or how long I can hide it, but I hope it’s long enough to lose at least 10kg. I want to fit into my favorite clothes again and be able to shop at a store I recently discovered.

I know I promised I’d tell him if this started again, but I feel justified since he promised to make healthy meals for me, and he hasn’t. Am I ""punishing"" him in my mind? Probably. I know I should “be the bigger person” and communicate, but it feels good to stomp my foot and be childish. I’m happier than I’ve been in a long time. It’s great to feel in control like this. I’m just so done with his talks about weight loss while being unwilling to support me, and with my mother’s snarky comments and constant bragging about her diet.

A few weeks ago I was in Chtown running errands. It took longer than I expected so I needed something to eat. Thought I’d go dirty with a McDs breakfast. 

Three hash browns, egg/cheese McMuffin, no coffee = 13.68. I thought it was an input error. Insane. How can a family of four justify a quick McDs breakfast on the road when it’s north of $50? There is just no value at that point. 

Short while later was in Montague and wife called, asking if I wanted to grab pizza for dinner. We never do that; so thought it would be a treat. She called Greco in Montague and, I’m short on the details, but basically a medium three-topping veg pizza was in the mid-20s. 

I know Dominos etc will have deals.  But when I think of a three-topping medium (8 slice) veg pizza to go, I’m thinking around 12 bucks plus tax, so shy of 15. Going into the mid-20s for that just kills the incentive to purchase. The value literally isn’t there. We chopped up veg on a 4.99 No Name cheese pizza and called it a good night. 

I don’t see how these places survive. Who the shit is gonna spend fiddy bone on a pizza for a family of four? Who the shit is gonna drop north of fifteen bone on a shitty McDs breakfast?

1h8qncf,https://www.reddit.com/r/equestriaatwar/comments/1h8qncf/specialized_activities/,Specialized Activities,"Somewhere, a ceiling fan lazily stirred above a dimly lit, homey, wood-finished office room. Metal file cabinets lined every wall, and a single potted plant sat next to a water dispenser by a corner. Two ponies in white dress shirts and black ties moved about, trudging through small towers of folders and paper. A wall clock in the little room read 12:30. The room's singular window had its blinders closed, the shadows of figures passing by peeking through.

""Here's another one,"" a mellow old voice called out, its owner dropping a stack of dusty folders and binders onto the floor. The nameplate on his dress shirt spelled out ""Dr. Bright Shine.""

The young stallion he was talking to looked over from where he was and pushed aside a stack he had already scanned through. That one was just filled with miscellaneous assessments and memos on... something. He wasn't really paying attention, but he knew they weren't what the two ponies were looking for.

Come to think of it, what *were* they looking for?

The young stallion, moving towards the new stack and plopping down the floor to file through them, tentatively asked, ""What are we looking for again, exactly?""

Bright replied. ""It was a yellow binder. Had all my important notes from a month ago attached. My careless hooves misplaced them *somewhere* in here, and I'll be damned if I show up to the project manager later today empty-hoofed.""

""Right."" The young pony nodded and silently returned to his duty, Dr. Bright going back to his own efforts as well.

The younger of the two kept working. His eyes flicked from left to right at every flip of paper stamped ""CLASSIFIED"", the OSSA logo catching his gaze every time. It had the words ""Office of Specialized Strategic Activities"" and an iteration of the S.M.I.L.E seal proudly displayed about its circular form. The rustling of paper could be heard as he went about his business.

Soon, however, the small silence that hung over the room was interrupted. The young stallion stopped what he was doing, putting down another half-redacted memorandum onto the floor.

""Since we're probably going to be here for a while, got any stories to share?""

Bright, hearing this, turned his head. ""Note, son, we've got a lot of work to do. It's gonna some take more to convince me.""

""I'll pay for your lunch tomorrow.""

The old stallion lit up a little. ""Well, since you've said the magic words...""

Bright sat down on his desk chair, plopping down two stacks of files right next to his personal computer, and pulled open a drawer from his desk. After rummaging for a bit, he fished out a cigar and a lighter.

Note had an unamused look on his face. ""Really?""

Bright lit the cigar he put in his mouth, and puffed. ""Hey, it sets the mood. And it helps me think while I'm spinning yarn.""

""Right. But won't this whole place stink of smoke afterwards?"" Note asked.

""Nah. It's not that bad. I've done this plenty of times before in my downtime, don't worry,"" Bright reassured Note. ""Anyway...""

\------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Magic shimmered from Bright's horn, and after a bunch of trial and error, the two stacks of files were moving on their own, albeit slowly. Satisfied with his spell, Bright relaxed on his chair, eyes set on the floating papers.

""I'm probably not allowed to tell you this, but since I've been given personal discretion to divulge some certain pieces of my background not revealed in my dossier to anyone with a high enough clearance level, I say why not. You're my partner, anyway, so you deserve to know more about me. But, take a seat first, dust yourself off.""

Note obliged and grabbed a wooden chair nearby. Once he was settled, Bright began.

""So, this little story was back during the Great War. I was assigned to a special thaumaturgic research team deep within the Everfree forest, away from Changeling eyes above. You know the Elements?""

Note's ears perked up. ""Yeah, everyone knows them. Six powerful stones as ancient as the princesses. I've seen papers by my colleagues indicating they were originally planted by the Pillars of Harmony centuries ago. Don't tell me...""

""Yeah. Celestia- *Daybreaker* ordered our team to work on those stones. We'd live in the research site, if we had to - and we did - and we were tasked to figure out how they ticked. High command said it was a 'great matter of national security'.""

Bright puffed his cigar. ""I believed them, though. After all, those stones saved Equestria countless times before. If we knew how they worked beyond 'two or more ponies using literal friendship as a power source', maybe we could get them to save us from more than just the odd magical problem of the week.""

Suddenly, a soft chime sounded. Bright stopped to fiddle with his spell, switching it over to another stack. He then continued.

""However, the war ended before we could find anything big, and the project got shelved amidst all the budget cuts and austerity measures that followed. Luckily for me, fate gave this cloud a silver lining because during my time in the Everfree, I met my wife Giselle."" Bright paused for a bit, then continued.

""She was a fellow researcher, as Prench as they come, and she was rather passionate about Equestria's magical history, just like me. We were so close to potentially unlocking the mysteries of Harmony. But between our research and her, I'd choose her every time.""

Bright smiled. ""And before you know it, we had a son. He's a professor in Canterlot now, teaching sociology and political science. How time flies...""

Note quietly stared at his partner, observing the old pony gazing off for a moment.

\------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Soon enough, the two were back to work wading through a small mountain of papers. Note had borrowed a table to plop down his work on, hunched over the darned stacks and eager to finally get things done. They've found the binder already, but it turned out to only have half of the notes they needed, and Bright had also misplaced the binder that contained the other half. The wall clock above read 1:22.

""Say, we should get some coffee."" Note said, taking a break from scanning through a bundle of research drafts he probably shouldn't be shuffling though.

""Nah."" Bright replied. ""Cafeteria coffee's expensive. I just bring my own packs right-"" He tapped his dress shirt's front pocket a couple times, coffee and sugar packets jostling within - ""here, in my pocket. Buying coffee from this place is for those who can't heat up their own without bringing a kettle and a stove. Luckily, *I* can.""

Bright tossed a couple instant coffee packets to Note and nodded towards the water cooler in the room.

Note trotted over to the dispenser and scoffed, filling up a paper cup. ""Haven't dual-use dispensers reached this place yet?""

""Apparently not.""

A short while later, two steaming cups of hot water sat on Bright's desk as Note tore open and poured two freshly-shaken packets of coffee into their respective cups.

As the pair grabbed their black gold to stir with their magic, Bright spoke up, ""While we're taking a break, have any questions about this place? Does working thousands of feet inside a mountain unnerve you in any way?""

Note replied. ""Not really. I've lived in a cave in the southeast before when I was studying Ursas.""

""Well, I thought a cave would be way different than an entire underground government complex, you know?"" Bright stirred his cup and took a sip, ""But care to hear somethin'?""

Note raised an eyebrow. ""What?""

Before answering, Bright moved his eyes around, as if paranoid someone else would hear, and then leaned close over the desk towards Note.

""You know those fellas over at the Ontokinetics Division?""

""Uh huh...""

""Stars, do they freak me out."" Bright slowly leaned back in his chair. ""They're playing god down there, and Princess Twilight just lets them. I mean-"" Bright took a sip. ""I have a friend working there. We got drunk once talking about... things. I swear on my mother, she said something about 'defying Discord' and making him suck her left..."" He trailed off then grimaced. ""You get it.""

Note gave Bright a perplexed look.

""Yeah, I have no idea either,"" Bright replied.

\------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

An hour later, the second binder was found. Bright and Note were only casually lounging in the office at this point, the latter going through a few files of interest. The wall clock read 3:01. There was still some time before the meeting.

Suddenly, something caught Note's eye.

""MP80? What the hell is *that* psychoactive doing being mentioned here? That 'truth serum' should have *stayed* a truth serum, back in Chiropterra and whatever the hell Princess Luna was up to over there. Also, aren't we Occult Studies?""

""Huh?"" Bright awoke from his nap. He coughed before answering. ""Oh, that? Well, we might not be Special Magics, but sedatives and so-called 'truth serums' could sometimes be useful in our field operations. Don't you remember what they told you back in training?""

""Yeah, I remember, but I didn't think we'd go *that* far."" Note replied.

Bright stretched his hooves with a grunt. ""Well, you're in luck because that's not actually MP80. Pretty sure it's a variant.""

Note took a closer look. ""Says here it's 'MP80-D2'. It's a 'mental stasis' substitute based on the original substance. Guess I did miss something. Has it ever been approved for use before?""

Bright laughed. ""Hell no. Something like that would've *never* gotten past Ethics - and it never did, for obvious reasons. Of course, S.M.I.L.E and their friends over at the OCI are keeping 'em 'just in case'."" He stroked his chin.

""Though, you know, this reminds me of a mission I had before my Everfree assignment. I was sent on a mission to Tzinacatlia attached to a special missions unit led by a certain rainbow-maned mare. And you wouldn't believe who we bumped into while romping through the jungle fighting VOPS and Chiropterran agents, of all people...""

But before he could continue, a voice rang out throughout the complex.

""*Paging Dr. Bright Shine at level three to Dr. Silver Loom's office at level five. Please bring Dr. Golden Note with you. Thank you.*""

Bright sighed. ""Welp. Unfortunately, we're outta time. This one's for another day. But lemme tell you: a certain group from Maretania were *not* particularly happy about the things we eventually found in that place.""

Note smirked, standing up and grabbing the binders on Bright's desk. ""Oh, I know those guys. Some say we simply stole their thunder...""

""Eh,"" Bright sounded. ""Either way, the Bells of Tambelon ring. And it ain't lunchtime."" Note nodded in reply.

The two quickly exited the room, Note closing the door behind him.",1,1733571302.0,equestriaatwar,1,1.0,False

1h8qlkj,https://www.reddit.com/r/EthicalNonMonogamy/comments/1h8qlkj/how_do_i_29f_separate_sex_from_love/,How do i (29F) separate sex from love? ,"I (29F) have been with my partner (40M) for 2 years. We’ve discussed ENM in the past, officially decided we might try to dip our toes after a year of dating. He’s much more proactive than i am. 
Essentially what it looks like for us is:

me exploring my bicuriousity by going on dates with women. No emotional bonds.

Him meeting other women (solo dating) for potential FWB for certain kinks he does not share with me/ frustrations etc. No emotional bonds.

We have had ongoing discussions and arguments. If there’s a spectrum, i would prefer monogamish, i do not want an open relationship. 
I have been the one who has been primarily more monogamous and been the one upset when he’s gone on dates.
He has been doing a lot to reassure me and we talk through things a lot. I really appreciate that. All i knew for fact (based on what he told me) was that he met people for dates, nothing physical (that he has told me) so far. 
I had feeling in my head that he would have been physical with someone, but i was worried i was overthinking and did not want to act based on presumptions.

For me, my exploration has been limited to kissing a girl after a second date and being ghosted after.

Its been difficult with the topic of “does he tell me that he is going/has gone/will be going on a date”. I acknowledge the few times i have been aware, i had been upset and fights ensue so it was sort of decided that- i trust him, i won’t know too much, but he can let me know if he felt it was something he wanted to share and i wasn’t in a bad headspace at the time.

I am aware he’s been walking on eggshells for this.

we had a fight and i have now been told that he has already slept with two people last year, one before we technically discussed ENM arrangement and specifics and one just as we started (but when we were supposedly “dipping my toes”)

What surprises me is that he sometimes, in that period of time where we were dipping our toes in ENM, he had asked me/ almost asking permission about dates or going on coffee dates (not always but sometimes) but just took the opportunity to sleep with someone anyways?

We had a big fight as i felt hurt.
He didnt do anything wrong per say if we already had an established agreement.
I think it was more im shocked we were in different headspaces, i thought we were dipping our toes, but he had run the full mile already. 

We both love each other, we both know breaking up is an option but we both do not want to do so. We do think we need help- going to see if we can get a therapist.

In my head im trying to figure out whats wrong with me. Why i am so…shocked…to think my partner slept with someone else while with me? We love each other so much, we tell each other we love each other daily, we make sure to be there for each other, we communicate a lot our fears, desires and wants for our lives, we’re supportive of each other’s lives and careers, we both want family and children and to be in a safe environment. He says he cannot see a life without me.

Right now my head is thinking: i’m afraid of how i would feel to know in 1 year’s time that he’s slept again with someone.

1 year ago, we were not in the best place in our relationship and fought frequently and we both fell into a depression.
We’re much stronger now and much more in love.

I don’t know what to expect. I know why he wants an FWB, i respect it, i want to allow him to have rhat freedom and he does try, within limits to accommodate me (ie no dates if i had had a stressful week at work and he wants to be there support me)

As an ENM partner, right now he is amazing and trying everything he can to make sure i feel loved and supported.

Why can’t i separate his sexual desires he has with his FWB with his immense love for me? Just because he slept with someone doesn’t mean he doesn’t love me.

And i have grown up as a daughter of a constantly cheating father and a mother who never left and being the support and shoulder to cry on for my mom so i understand all that has a part to play in why my emotional reaction is so strong, eventhough rationally, i know he loves me and i know he’s trying, despite difficulty with me.

I have read some poly books and again, my brain understands, its my heart that keeps screaming in my face.

If anyone has any advice or have been in a similar position, i would appreciate it.

I don’t want to hurt the man i love. I am aware that leaving him might be the key to set him free but he doesn’t want that key and it crushes me to even hold that key in front of him. He won’t take it unless i give it directly and verbally, but i can’t say the words.

I cannot expect him to call me every time he goes on a date and it might get sexual. I cannot expect him to not go on a date and it be perfectly strictly no-sex, no- physical. 
I think, in my naivety, i did..

First, the golden rule of SHEIN shopping - never checkout without at least two discounts stacked. Yeah, you read that right - you can usually combine different types of codes! That random 15% off code you found? Cool, but you can probably add points, student discount, or new user perks on top of that.

Here's my favorite hack: those little paper slips in your SHEIN packages? Keep them! They often have exclusive codes that work better than the ones floating around online. Plus, they usually stack with other discounts. I've got a whole collection of these bad boys in my desk drawer now (yes, I might have a shopping problem 😅).

Timing is everything, folks. I've noticed SHEIN tends to drop their best codes on Sunday nights and Monday mornings. Combine these with their flash sales, and you're looking at some serious savings. Pro tip: add stuff to your cart ahead of time and wait for these double-discount windows.

The student discount thing? It's actually worth the verification hassle. Once you're verified, that sweet 15% off sticks around and stacks with most other codes. Same goes for email signup bonuses - make a separate folder for SHEIN emails and thank me later.

Last but super important: screenshot everything! Prices, codes you've used, final totals - all of it. SHEIN's prices fluctuate more than my coffee order, and having proof of price changes or code issues has saved my wallet more than once.

Edit: Thanks for all the DMs! Yes, I'll keep updating this post when I discover new stacking tricks",1,1733570910.0,SheinCodeDeals,0,1.0,False
1h8qjpe,https://www.reddit.com/r/Gastritis/comments/1h8qjpe/healed_it_does_happen/,Healed! It DOES Happen!,"My journey with gastritis was long and complex. It started 18 months ago during a period of high stress after the sudden loss of a parent. I had two back to back Noro Viruses and then the real fun began. I lost 25 pounds, had reflux, I couldn't eat anything. I had trouble sleeping from the burning in my gut and had lower GI issues. My symptoms were reflux, weight loss, stomach pain, anxiety, insomnia.

I was dx with gastritis via endoscopy. I refused PPI as IMO they cause other problems and mask the issue. I focused on stress management, diet, and natural supplementation. The recovery process was slow and sometimes it seemed as if I wasn't healing, but I was! The gut can take a long time to heal and it's not always linear. I had a follow up endo today and I have no signs of reflux or gastritis, and I took ZERO PPI or traditional meds to heal. I am not a doctor or advocating one way or another this is my story.

What worked - DGL, L-Glutamine, drinking bone broth, herbal teas, avoiding excessive fried and fatty foods, stress management, and NO alcohol. My diet was not overly restrictive - the mental side of gastritis can exacerbate and make things worse. You CAN heal, it takes time! I now drink low acid coffee, have pizza, and eat what I want with no issues. Ny gastritis was caused by stress, noro virus, and it was healed without PPI. AMA",4,1733570862.0,Gastritis,3,1.0,False

We also have a regular once-weekly hangout. As in, at this point, it's implied we spend one evening together every week.

I tried for a long time to be just-friends with him. We're both not good at maintaining boundaries in that sense: he flirts nonstop and I get carried away with it. I end up flirting back. He has no intentions beyond friendship, I'm pretty sure of that by now.

I don't want to get too emotionally involved, I feel it's heading this way already. At times, I've been telling myself I'm okay with this situation being as-is, ""just friends"", and that I'm in control over it all. At other times, I'm aware that my heart is pulling in the opposite direction. It has become far worse lately - it happened, in a way, ""gradually, then suddenly"", as Hemingway once put it.

\*\*\*

My friends group know my LO and observed our interactions. They know how I feel. Some of them still think that the vagueness might mean there's still hope, but there's an old say: ""if it's not a hell-yes, it's a no"". My LO himself quoted it once.

One of my neighbours asked me about him today. She recalled one time she saw us drinking coffee together, and said ""I thought he was your boyfriend"".

I spilled the whole story: we bonded over a shared interest, we've been spending time together for months now, he's been telling me how beautiful and attractive I am - and I've been leaning on that because of my insecurities, but he doesn't seem to want anything more than a friendship.

She was harsh, but I needed to hear what she told me: this person is using me to boost his ego, even without realising he's hurting me. He won't return my texts in a timely fashion, or make plans and then bail out on them. She told me off for sitting by the phone for a maybe-get-together he suggested earlier today. She said that if I can't do the brainwork to view him as a friend and nothing-but, I need to go no-contact. That I should have higher self-esteem. That I'm a successful woman, who achieved great things by herself. That I don't need to subject myself to this. That I deserve more than breadcrumbs of affection. That he's stringing me along. That he probably DOES know how I feel.

She also said that if I break my no-contact, she won't hold it against me. She's been there too.

\*\*\*

No contact would require some significant changes to my lifestyle.

It needs to be done.

I've postponed it for too long.

I told myself that if he's not sleeping with me and then not-calling, he's not hurting me. That he hasn't wronged or abused me in any way, and doesn't deserve to be ignored. That I have no right to expect anything from him, he's not my boyfriend or anything. But I haven't been entirely honest with myself: it \*does\* hurt, whether he meant it or not. I've been hurting myself, repeatedly, by letting this thing continue and derail my mental health.

I've been, pretty much all over the world. From the bright lights of south east Asia to the rolling meadows of western Europe. But there was one spot that had up until recently, eluded me. Australia. Well, I finally bit the bullet and booked my dream trip down under. I'd love to sit here and tell you all about how incredible it was. How I saw some of the most unique sights I had ever seen in my life. To a point I suppose that's true. But I won't be going back there…

You see, I’ve always been fascinated by the idea of the Australian Outback, with its vast empty nothingness stretching as far as the eye can see. Something about getting yourself lost in its beauty, it's equal parts terrifying and exciting. So that’s exactly what I planned to do. It's also why Australia had remained unattainable to me up until quite recently. I was set on doing things... differently. I didn't want to do what every dime a dozen tourist did. I had no interest in seeing the sights of the cities, I mean I’m sure they’re beautiful in their own right, but for me, I wanted to get out into the wilds as quickly as possible.

I did some research beforehand, jumped onto some local Aussie backpacking travel groups on Facebook and I ended up getting quite friendly with a local. His name was Chris and he was part Indigenous Australian. Aboriginal Dad, and his Mother of Irish heritage. We got to talking and upon hearing all about my wishes to see the more secluded sights of Australia, he agreed to be my tour guide for the trip.

Alright! All was set. I flew into Sydney on a cold July morning. Yeah that’s their winter months down there. I was so excited as the Sydney Harbour bridge and the Opera House slowly came into view upon our descent beneath the clouds. I was right, the cities were beautiful in their own regard but still, that’s not what I was here to see.

I met my tour guide Chris at the airport and we hastily made our way to his vehicle, a stereotypical rusty Holden ute, and began the trek out west. The drive was bloody beautiful and I highly recommend you try it at least once in your lifetime. We eventually cleared the western suburbs of Sydney passing through Parramatta, Blacktown and Penrith before the urban scenery slowly began to give way to beautiful wide open spaces. Yeah, this is what I’ve been waiting for.

The drive continued on for hours as we passed through quaint little outback communities, some of which genuinely looked like ghost towns. It was awe inspiring to see the colours of this barren landscape change as we drove deeper toward the centre. Brown, dry bushland interspersed with pockets of green slowly transitioning into hot red earth. I was mesmerised. It was a long drive out there but I was so captivated by the sights I was seeing I honestly didn't notice. Eventually, just as night began to fall, we reached Broken Hill. This sprawling inland mining city deep in the heart of outback New South Wales was to be our base for exploring the remote wilderness of Mutawintji National Park.

We would stay the night here in Broken Hill. It was too late to start the hike into the park, Chris explained to me. It was already creeping into the afternoon hours, and if we got caught in the dark too far from a good spot to make camp, that could spell real danger out there. I wasn't going to argue. He knew this place better than I did. I was excited to get out there and really start exploring, but I'd also had little sleep on the long haul down here, and I wasn't going to say no to a good night's rest.

We checked into a quaint little hotel. Now, when I say hotel, I mean the Australian depiction of that term. If you're picturing the Hilton, think again. When Aussies say ""hotel"", they mean the bare necessities you need in a room, situated on the second floor on top of a pub (a bar). Falling asleep to the sounds of drunken Australian men shouting at eachother about two different types of football, neither of which I understand, was certainly something. But I was so tired at this point it didn't pose much of a barrier in my journey to slumber. A few pages into a good book and I was out like a light.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

I awoke the next morning to the smells of breakfast and the sounds of my fellow guests shuffling their way down the stairs to dig into it. I was close behind them, ravenous after not eating very well at all the past couple of days. Aussies sure know how to start the day with a good breakfast. Well, a big one anyway, I don't imagine it would score too high a health rating. Mountains of bacon, sausage and eggs were loaded up onto a plate and I was given a huge mug of coffee to wash it down with. I'm... not really too big a fan of starting the day off with a heavy meal, but I got the feeling I wasn't in the best company to raise any complaints.

After breakfast, I met up with Chris and we loaded our gear into his ute. Before long, we were out on the open road again, surrounded by the endless red horizon. He wasn’t wrong. This place was remote. It was a few hours drive to the nearest entry point and from there we were on foot. We had everything we needed in our packs but still, there was something quite unnerving about trekking into such a vast open wasteland with not even a vehicle to retreat into should things go sideways. But, this is what I came for. And I was going to see it through.

That first step was something truly magical. The barely audible crunch of the soft top layer of dirt before my boot sunk into the red earth, it was surreal. I had waited so long to see this land, I couldn't quite believe I was actually here. Finally. The first day was full of little moments like that. The first time seeing a mob of kangaroos hop by in the distance. The first time smelling eucalyptus. The first time fearing for my life, as Chris threw an abrupt hand signal up in front of my face just in time to stop me traipsing ignorantly into a large eastern brown snake’s path. That sure got the blood up. And the first time seeing a billabong cresting the horizon after a full day of hiking, that was a sight to behold. 

It was around 4 or 5 in the afternoon by that point, so we decided to make camp for the night. It had been a long day, and I was starving. Thankfully Chris had picked up a few recipes from his old man during his childhood years growing up in a remote outback settlement. “Bush tucker” they call it down there. Chris cooked up a hot stew, and we had that with what they call damper, the “bread of the bush”. It’s actually really cool to see someone make bread using nothing but ingredients pulled straight from the land. It’s made using wattleseed and saltbush. It’s not much for the taste buds, but let me tell you, when you’re out there with nothing but the clothes on your back and whatever the land grants you, being able to fill your belly with bread is a beautiful thing. 

It was a great way to end what had been an amazing start to my first venture into the Australian outback. We set up our camp beneath some gum trees, nearby that beautiful billabong. It was of course far too cold for any swimming but the ambiance was nice. There was a trickle in a nearby stream and the crackle of the campfire had me off to sleep very quickly.

It must have been close to, or maybe just past midnight, when I awoke from a sound sleep, to a hand pressing against my mouth. This is obviously not a great way to wake up deep in the Aussie wilderness and believe me in that moment there were many thoughts of Australia’s outback serial killers racing through my mind. But as it would happen, it was Chris. His eyes were wide and he had a finger pressed against his lips, telling me in no uncertain terms to keep my mouth shut.

I began to glance around trying to find the source of Chris’s sudden panicked state. Looking around, at first I didn’t notice anything, just the vast expanse of the open outback in every direction. Nothing but darkness, and the infinite void of this ancient land. What made this experience even more terrifying is that we didn’t even have the cover of a tent, we were just camping out rough in our swags. I had no idea what to expect, I had visions of dangerous wild animals hunting us, circling in around us. That’s when Chris lifted a single hand and pointed down toward the water hole and whispered one word… “Nadubi”.

It took me a while in my sleepy state to process what I was looking at. In a flash I was reminded of every sleep deprived night spent as a kid after staying up late and watching my Dad’s scary werewolf films, for that is almost exactly what I was looking at here. It looked in every possible way, bar some subtle differences, like a werewolf. It stood bolt upright on two jagged hind legs, its arms slumped down by its sides and its head hung downward, its scrunched up face moulding into a slender snout which looked more beak-like than that of a dog.

It began to slowly creep around the waterhole, my eyes remaining fixed on it the whole time. With each step the dry earth crunched beneath it, and each one of those sounds will forever remain burned into my memory as with every one of them I thought for sure this thing was making its slow approach towards us. As it came closer to our side of the small pond I began to notice more alarming features about this thing. It may have resembled a werewolf in form and posture but that is where the similarities ended. Its entire body, was covered in what looked to be sharp tendrils, like a porcupine.

I watched as it sniffed at the still night air, I suppose searching for something it could call a meal. I don’t know. I’m unsure what its purpose was, what its motives were. But by the look of it neither could have been good. Chris, ever so slowly and carefully, pulled the small swag blanket over the both of us, and we huddled there in place, hoping and praying that we would go unnoticed.

For a series of very, very long hours, we lay there in the silence of the desolate Australian outback, as we listened to this thing take measured paces around our camp. It just, walked around, occasionally sniffing at our packs and some of the food we had left around camp. Intermittently, we would hear the unmistakable sounds of slurping. I guessed at that point it must have found itself some leftovers. Every so often it would retreat back over to the other side of the waterhole, from what we could hear anyway, but would then return. It seemed like it was waiting for something. Perhaps it thought somebody might be coming back, for whatever reason unaware that we were right there beneath the thin swag blanket.

It was, undoubtedly, the single most horrifying night of my life. The thoughts that were running through my mind after seeing this thing. Thinking about what it could do to us with that nightmarish form it carried with it. It was beyond terrifying.

We did not dare move that whole night. And it’s a good thing! As it would, in the end, be the light of day which would arrive as our saviours. I guess it didn’t much like the light, or perhaps the early morning heat it brought with it as it made its ascent, as we heard this thing very quickly run away as soon as the morning rays began making their way across our camp.

It still took us another good hour before we could summon the bravery to emerge from our makeshift hiding spot. I almost wish we had not. As we rose from our tiny sanctuary, and got a look at what had once been our tranquil little campsite, we were even more horrified than we had been the night before. We were greeted by the sight of many, many corpses. Lizards, possums, fish, snakes, even some kangaroos. Their bodies, lifeless. Seemingly, they were untouched. You wouldn’t even know they had been attacked in any way, were it not for the small holes in their bellies, and those disgusting slurping noises we had heard the night before.

We made haste getting out of there, needless to say. We stayed a night back in Broken Hill, and set off for the drive back east the next morning. The drive back to Sydney was a lot more solemn than the one we had taken on the way out there. Chris barely spoke. I almost didn’t want to break the silence but there were questions on my mind. That thing was obviously not of this world and yet he seemed to know exactly what it was at a glance. While not entirely certain of course, Chris shared with me that what we had seen, was most likely a Nadubi. It is an Indigenous tale of a grotesque, echidna like dog man which hunts by night. I didn’t get much more out of him, he looked as shaken as I was, understandably so. Despite growing up hearing many of these stories, I could tell by his demeanour this was the first time he had encountered one first hand.

I did end up staying a few more nights in Sydney. Honestly, I was still in a state of shock. I probably would have been on the next flight out had I been in any state of mind to book one. But I just, couldn’t. So I stuck around, until I could think straight. It wasn’t all bad I suppose, I ended up seeing a few sights around the city. I have a whole new appreciation for cities. Whilst I do still appreciate the blissful peace of the wilderness, I choose to admire it from afar. I have seen what lurks within the unexplored pockets of the Australian outback. I have seen why so many who venture too deep within fail to return.

For those of you wishing to experience it for yourself, I will not tell you what to do. I will leave you with only one piece of advice. That you educate yourself. Not only by the standards of modern humanity’s limited knowledge of this land, but listen to the stories of those who have lived here since ancient times. Do not underestimate their wisdom.

1h8q6j0,https://www.reddit.com/r/Descendants/comments/1h8q6j0/descendants_fanfic_the_realms_of_auradon_edition/,Descendants Fanfic; The Realms of Auradon Edition! ,"I'm done with the characters, but I did at one point tease I wanted to do a similar post explaining the realms in Auradon in my story, especially because I had different names for them and because of the pacing of my story, some of the cooler aspects of these realms are passed over. This is the longest one yet so brace yourself

Every realm is 'stuck in the past' in some capacity, but there's still some consistencies here and there. The overall vibe is making it a lot more based in history, so my fanfic is a historical fantasy. Despite the fictional names, I did try to base each location off actual times and places in our history 

Schönheit and Aznvakan-The combined kingdoms of Queen Snow White and King Hmayich 'Charming' White, based on 1500's Holy Roman Empire(Germany) and Armenia. When viewed from above, the landmass forms a heart and it's the smallest kingdom in all of Auradon. Schönheit is very foresty, with rolling hills filled with diamonds and other sparkly jewels. Only the Seven Dwarves know the locations of these jewels, and pass the knowledge onto their own kids. Schönheit has a very lucrative fruit trade, with plums, pears, cherries, exotic pomegranates from Anznvakan, and of course, apples. They also have some of the best healing in Auradon. 
The people are very distrustful and suspicious of magic, seeing it as something only evil-doers use, and fear it. Being ruled by the Evil Queen for years did little to assuage their fears. 

Anznvakan is very mountainous, in contrast. It's also as religious as Schönheit, though their versions of Christianity are different. Instead of dwarves mining in the hills, it's home to giants who specialize in making liquor, often getting into scuffles with humans who find the giant barrels laying around and decide to drink it. The citizens don't really have experience with magic, so they're neutral, and many people who are gifted with magic in Schönheit often go there to study in peace. Snowdrops are common, and Hmayich named his daughter in honor of the flower. Despite participating in the fruit trade, Aznvakan isn't very important in the grand scheme of things and is often forgotten, unless you're a council member or a geography or Kingdom Management student trying to get a high score on your worksheets.

Queen Snow White was the first of the 14 Great Queens to be honored. The 14 Great Queens, sometimes also called 14 Great Leaders, are fourteen women who rule their kingdoms with wisdom, grace, and elegance, bringing prosperity to them. Snow White was honored for her kindness and fixing her kingdom after the Evil Queen was defeated. 
King Hmayich has a story of his own, one people aren't aware of....before he became Snow White's prince, he was himself under a sleeping curse...and nearly married the pomegranate bride...but that's a story for another day....

Kasteel-Wedged comfortably in the middle between Schönheit and Aurora's kingdom, Kasteel is regularly seen as one of the most beautiful kingdoms in all of Auradon, based on the mid-1800's Benelux area and the 1997 movie, with hints of the animated one. The kingdom was not unified; Ella was just born in Charming's kingdom. Extremely rich and prosperous, the kingdom is famed for lavish balls put on by the nobility and royalty alike, but in recent years Ella has started opening up the palace gates to allow townspeople to partake in the parties provided they have something like Sunday best. The kingdom also produces much of the glass that's used and traded throughout Auradon. They make glassware, jewelry, and big statues for formal events. (They can make glass slippers if requested)
The people love and adore magic. Magic helped their queen take her place on the throne, magic and happy thoughts often result in the births of godparents, many citizens dream of their own Cinderella story coming true some day. Magic is loved and respected here, and a haven for magic-users to flourish. 

Ella and Christopher's castle is ironically seen as THE symbol of Auradon. It's used on official documents, and in realms that have movie theaters or radio programs, every one opens with an animated version of the castle while the anthem of Kasteel plays. 
According to genealogy records, The Charmings of Kasteel and Anznvakan are very distantly related, but due to the vast differences in culture, people aren't sure where the split happened, or when. 

Ella was the second of the 14 Great Queens to be honored, for her strength, kindness, and courage in the face of her villains. She believes you can imagine anything, so long as you have a little corner and chair all to yourself. She helped foster a better understanding in the kingdom for orphanages and charities, helping townspeople whenever she could. She was born of a townsperson, and often hung out with them while shopping, so she knew a lot of their struggles and what they wanted improved. 

Dämmerung-Fleur-The combined kingdoms of Queen Aurora and King Phillip, the largest of the original three kingdoms. It's one of the oldest kingdoms in Auradon history; Aurora's kingdom is modeled after the 1500's Holy Roman Empire(Austria) and Phillip's is based on Lorraine in that same time period. They were the original united kingdoms, unified years before Auradon was even conceived, and to honor that, they combined their names. The kingdom has many forests and valleys that dot the landscape, and many visitors describe the landscape as looking like a Medieval tapestry. The people are very proud of their landscapes and take good care of them. Unlike other kingdoms, they import more than they export, being more old-fashioned, but they are a good place for tourism. 
Citizens are fearful towards magic. The memories of Maleficent are just too strong, too fresh, too painful. They know there's good magic, but where there's good magic, there's bad magic. Aurora and Phillip understand and redirect magic-users elsewhere, though they themselves are neutral towards magic. 

Dämmerung is an old and proud kingdom. Having absorbed several smaller regions ages ago, the royalty often intermarried with each other to increase their power and influence. The royal family stretches back 300 years. The second they were married, Aurora and Phillip decided to finally unify their kingdoms, duly ruling together, keeping things as they were. 

Aurora was the third to be honored, for her beauty and kindness. Often left out of many stories is her sharp intellect when it comes to ruling and making decisions. She was one of the first to conceive the idea of Auradon, and was instrumental in unifying several of the other kingdoms. Unbeknownst to many, this is the retirement kingdom of an old woman known as Widow Tweed, who wanted a quiet kingdom to live out the rest of her days in. 

Uoshan-One of the few island nations, also directly above Atlantica. It's ruled by King Eric and Queen Ariel. They are based on 1820’s Jamaica and their live-action counterparts. A tiny island kingdom, with a lot of drama with rulers, as King Eric is seen as unfit to rule by the governing nobles, citing the fact he is adopted with no true royal blood, and his own wife came from nowhere. This has led to the succession crisis as people debate if their daughter, Melody, has any claim to the throne. 
The land is fertile and tropical, and perfect for growing sugar, cotton, coffee, and indigo dye, and huge farms dot the landscape. Due to their tropical location, like the Southernlands and Maldonia, malaria is a big problem in the country, one that Eric works tirelessly to fix. There's always a lot to do in the marketplace, such as dancing or trading. Ariel still loves to visit the market and get swept up in an impromptu dance session.

The citizens are neutral towards magic, being one of the only realms in Auradon with very little experience with it in general. Most of the people still fear merfolk and while Ariel being a mermaid is an open secret in the royal family, most civilians still don’t know who she is, and Ariel and Eric are reluctant to share out of fear. After all, Eric's birthday ship had sailors on it that tried to harpoon what they thought was a mermaid. He fears his people aren't ready to know the truth yet, even though his mother overcame her prejudice. 

Queen Ariel was the fourth to be honored, for her courageous nature and spunkiness, paving the way for others like her. She enjoys the honor but feels it's too pompous for many to properly live up to, especially because nobody is asked, they're just crowned for no real reason or without warning.  

Livre-Nestled to the west of Auradon City, the kingdom of current High Queen and King Belle and Lionel. Inspired by their live-action counterparts and mid-1700's France, there's not a soul in the whole land who hasn't heard of the two and their famous love story. The two have only aged gracefully and continue to lead their people with wisdom and care. Their realm is famed for sweeping, grand masquerade balls, where everyone is dressed and disguised to the nines. Livre is also known for hunting and technology, with several inventors living there and making a lot of the advanced steampunk things Auradon City and surrounding modern cities rely on. They lag behind with a low literacy rate, despite Belle's work in that area, and is surrounded by a small village Belle makes regular visits to to see how her people are doing or to get away from royal life. 
In Livre, the people only knew magic through the Enchantress, who cursed their ruler and erased all of their memories, leaving them with a tepid view on magic. Many families were lost to the curse, and while Belle and Lio are both open-minded about magic, they also have to respect the wishes of their people 

Belle was the fifth to be honored,for her wisdom and bravery. Her knowledge led her kingdom into a more advanced state of being, with many improvements made to everyday life, such as the washing machine, patented by Belle herself. 
Paris, and by extension Notre Dame, is also here in Livre. 

Auradon City-The capital of the entire realm. Modeled after a mix of 1910's-1920's and is steampunk, with things such as airships, telegram machines and telephones, and some more modern fashion choices, such as shorter skirts. Originally just unclaimed land, the three Classic Princesses and Belle built it up after they unified, seeing how their kingdoms were more primitive, and wanting a more modern hub of technology and education and commerce to help future generations get what they would be lacking in their realms. There's suburbs, where a lot of regular citizens live, as well as their schools, such as Auradon's Imagineering Academy(a popular choice, especially for STEM hopefuls) offices and boutiques, restaurants modeled after the various realms, and of course the famous Auradon Preparatory, an inclusive boarding school designed to teach the next generations. Some people think it bares a striking resemblance to Anaheim. 
Several smaller cities line the kingdoms, mainly on Schönheit's left side. This is where many nondescript modern cities are, but it's also where New York City and Todayland(steampunk) are. 

A bit further to the west is San Fransokyo(steampunk) The city is notable not just for its blend of San Francisco and Tokyo but also because a popular boardgame called Wreck-It-Ralph is produced here. Most of the technology the cities use is also made here.
Directly across to the east is London, modeled after the 1920's. This is where Roger and Anita live, as do the Darlings. 

If you stray too far, you'll end up in Sherwood Forest, one of the largest and most wild regions in Auradon, modeled after 1100's England. With very little laws and order, Sherwood Forest often does their own thing, not even having an official seat on the council, their own king responsible for everything in the realm. Robin Hood and his Merry Men are seen as the 'official' rulers, keeping an eye on everything, they're the ones who have always stepped up to help their fellow man. Taxes are still very high, and the vast amounts of forests has left many people unwilling to visit the area. They have their own school system, their own high school(really more like an organized education group in the woods) Sherwood Heights, regularly competes against Auradon Prep and other schools on the continent. 
(In my fanfic, all of the characters from Robin Hood are humans, they just have animal-like traits, such as Robin having a fox-like face. I don't acknowledge the animal-centered movies, aside from a reference here and there, for various reasons) 

If you run free from the forest, you'll end up in Camelot, with Prydain to the south of it, also considered part of the landmass. Camelot is the most primitive kingdom in all of Auradon, modeled after 1100's England. King Arthur didn't see the need to modernize, and so he just didn't, instead using the union to trade and import whatever his kingdom needed. It's led to Camelot being seen as very backward and uninteresting for tourism, the only visitors being history or reenactment buffs. Medieval restaurants and stores in other realms are more mockeries than sincere. King Arthur is not a popular king, with his people being frustrated by his old-fashioned mindset and insistence on being traditional. 
In Camelot, and by extension most of Prydain, magic is as natural as breathing. Citizens see magic as flowing and in their lives the same way others view water or air. Almost everyone in this region has some kind of magical ability, even if it's simple, like boiling water or keeping food warm or always having a light by your side.

Off the east coast are various tropical islands, such as Motuini. Moana regularly sails the seas with her people. Moana was honored as the twelfth of the 14 Great Queens for her determination and attitude towards helping not just her specific tribe, but all tribes, be reunited. 

Agrabah-Directly north of London are two of the biggest landmasses in Auradon, just as big as Sherwood Forest. Agrabah is one of these, modeled after 1500's Mughal India and their live-action counterparts. Ruled over by Sultans Jasmine and Aladdin, finally pleased to be able to do stuff after being crowned, tackling the crushing poverty. While Jasmine was unable to remove the religious tax, she did put higher taxes on nobility and established support systems for the impoverished. Another concern of hers was making sure artisans in the country were properly compensated for their work, as during her father's and grandfather's rules, it was way too easy to cheat them out of their money. 
Agrabah is the largest supplier of silk and cotton to the rest of the continent, as the country is seen as extremely fashionable, with Jasmine being considered one of the most fashionable of the Great Queens. Women here are famed for their love of fashion and jewelry, wearing layers of precious jewels and extremely thin muslin dresses sewn with gold. Agrabah also produces jewels and spices. A lot of famed mathematicians and scientists such as astronomers come from here too 

Citizens of Agrabah see magic as neutral, a tool to be used. It can be good or bad depending on who wields it. Jafar was a terrifying foe, but he was a power-hungry sorcerer. That doesn't mean magic itself is to blame. The Genie, Fawzi now, has opened a magic store in Auradon City, specializing in supplies for magic-users and temporary spells for regular citizens in the hopes they'll learn to respect magic. 
Agrabah is also unique in that it is the one of the only parts of Auradon without a Christianity-majority populace. Instead, the citizens are Muslim, or Hindu. An easy way to tell is Muslim women usually wear 'harem' pants under their dresses, and Hindu women wear long skirts underneath their dresses. The current ruling family are Muslims. 

Jasmine was the sixth to be honored as one of the 14 Great Queens, for her shrewdness and bravery. She improved the rights of women in her country, allowing them more opportunities for education, protection from abuse and forced marriages, and more chances to own property and wealth on their own terms. 

Chūnlán-The other massive landmass, to the left of Agrabah, separated by one of the few man-made structures in the entire world, modeled after the Northern and Southern Dynasties era(400's-500's China) ruled over by Empress Ting-Ting and her Emperor Consort Ling. After the previous Emperor passed away due to age, she took over the position and rules with grace. Her two sisters, while still in-line, live away from royalty. Mulan went back to her own family and married Shang after several more adventures. They are a very militaristic nation, with many tribes that train their children in war, and as a result even girls are taught from an early age to ride horses and perform archery(Mulan was trained in these things too, her family was just worried over her safety) but they are also very artistically gifted. Some of the best astronomers come from here, and their art consists of flowery, elegant poetry, silk, and paintings. 

Due to being neighbors with Agrabah, they trade quite often, such as Chūnlán getting silver and spices from Agrabah and Agrabah getting their tea and calvary, as tame horses are rare there. 
People in Chūnlán don't feel very strongly about magic. They have their own beliefs, obliviously, but they don't see it as magic. They have very little experience with the actual concept, so they're unsure of how they would feel about it. 

Mulan was the eighth to be honored, for bravery in saving her realm, and she hated it. Yes, she was happy for an honor, but she hated being one of the Great Queens. She's not a queen or a ruler, she's a simple farmer's daughter who returned to that life after the war. She wanted to raise her family on her own terms. Instead, she was seen as a princess while the true ones were ignored, forced to attend publicity shoots and photo and painting ops with the others, being treated as the 'Chinese princess' in long dresses and with her hair up in an impossible bun. And don't even get her started on that one op where they gave her blue eyes. In secret, she resents the title. 

Thebes-A little to the right of Agrabah, and obviously above it is Mt. Olympus. Literally above them. Modeled after the Classical era of Greece. 

Far off the coast is an unincorporated island named Kioto Jima. Modeled after Heian(900's-1100's) Japan, and ruled by an empress, very rare in their culture. Not very much is known about them, though they're home to trickster spirits and mischievous forms of magic, such as raccoon-dogs(tanuki) that dance in moonlight, foxes(kitsune) that transform into humans, and crows(tengu) that fly down from the mountains to hold tea parties. 

Bendito Sol-To the east of Chūnlán, this empire is usually just called the Kuzconian Empire by other Auradonians, modeled after 1500's Incans. Ruled by Emperor Kuzco and his wife, Empress Malina. They have a unique culture as they don't use any form of currency, trading labor for required goods or services. Their education system is one of the best on the entire continent, and many students who can't go to school somewhere like Auradon Prep attend here. They also don't have a formal writing system, which can also cause tensions during international relations.  Their main export are potatoes. They love potatoes, having cultivated hundreds upon hundreds of different types, and are eager to share them all with the rest of the continent. They also export a lot of yarn, because clothing is very important. So important,in fact, that Emperor Kuzco never wears the same outfit twice, and neither does the rest of his household. 

Magic is a tough subject for the citizens of Bendito Sol. Yzma, despite her infamy, she was a chemist, a scientist, not a sorceress. She didn't have powers. If you asked a random citizen what they thought about magic, they'd point at Kuzco, thought to completely embody the sun, or they'd point to the sun itself. They like to think they'd appreciate magic, but haven't had an opportunity to experience it yet. 

Nestled away in the mountains is the Encanto, they don't have very much contact with Bendito Sol but they do occasionally trade plants with each other. 

Rosas-An unincorporated island off the east coast of Bendito Sol, but they are currently going through the unification process after beginning a trade agreement. Ruled by Queen Amaya and modeled after 1500's Mediterranean area 

Corona-To the south of Rosas, another island nation. Based on 1790's Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth. A kingdom of eternal sunshine and dancing, Rapunzel was happy with how she didn't have to make major sweeping changes in comparison to her peers, because her parents managed to rule the kingdom peacefully. The mainland is filled with forests, and those have mushrooms and berries galore, which are perfect for citizens to run through and pick their latest meal from. Forests, and.... swamps. Lots of swamps. They are also known for fashionable salons with scientists, humanitarians, artists, and writers all coming together to discuss the current state of the world. Rapunzel frequents these, wanting to learn more about the world. The big wigs of Livre are unfashionable here, despite the fashion otherwise being similar, the people much preferring embroidered folk outfits, related to Slavic and Baltic imagery, such as women wearing flowers in their natural hair. It's another great kingdom for healing in general, and many come from the capital for the relaxing health spas and timely treatments for minor illness and injury found here. 

Magic takes the form of enchanted plants and talking animals. Every summer, everyone traverses the woods for a legendary flower, said to grant whoever finds it amazing powers, such as the ability to talk to animals. Nature as a whole is sacred; water and forests are holy spots. Corona is folksy and focuses almost wholly on nature, seeing magic in nature and the heavens. The people love magic and the people who possess it. Rapunzel was the tenth to be honored as one of the 14 Great Queens, for her compassion and imagination. Every prior princess attended her coronation, which was one of the first times that was ever done. 

Just below them are the Southern Isles, another set of islands, based off 1840's Denmark, also very loosely mixed with Central Asia. Currently ruled by one of Hans' brothers. This is also the current location of Ambassador Anya who had to flee her home, now lost due to war and revolution. She adopted Rasputin's three kids and has her own son, and together with Dmitri she travels around the continent, helping others who lose their homes and become displaced due to violence 

Arendelle-Back on the mainland, Arendelle and Maldonia are neighbors, with Weselton being just below Arendelle. Arendelle is based on 1840’s Norway and ruled by Queen Anna and King Kristoff. 
Arendelle is identified by the strong sense of nationalistic pride the citizens have. Embroidered clothing is all the rage, with patterns and motifs important to the population. People from Arendelle often dress much simpler in comparison to other kingdoms but they aren't bothered at all. Queen Anna is beloved and treated with grace, helping her people rebuild after the spirits drove them out of their homes and the dam was destroyed, creating a more modern and beautiful Arendelle. She's one of the oldest mothers in Auradon, having her young children when she was almost forty, and concerning her people, but her birth went smoothly. (Except for Kristoff fainting, but you didn't hear about that)

Arendellians love but respect magic. Many people outside of the kingdom believe them to be fearful because of Elsa, but nothing could be further from the truth. Her magic was a gift. Mixing with the Northuldra helped more skeptical citizens welcome the idea of magic into their lives, and everyone fiercely respects magic. Magic is the spirits of nature, the way of the land, the way things are. One just respects them and lives in harmony with them and thanks them for all their gifts. 

Arendelle, as expected, exports ice. Half of the year. The other half, they export fish, seeds, livestock, and wool. They're an extremely popular tourist destination, just as much as Atlantica, though with more respect given. A lot of money comes from tourism, especially during winter seasons.

Queen Anna, in a surprise twist, is one of the 14 Great Queens. Named last and sudden, for redefining what true love means and her unwavering loyalty to her family. Anna likes the title but feels it doesn't really suit her. She misses a lot of important meetings because of ruling her own kingdom, and nobody else really seems to notice, or care, really. 

Maldonia-Neighbors with Arendelle, it's another large kingdom in Auradon. Ruled over by Naveen and Tiana after his parents stepped down due to age. Modeled after 1920's islands in the Carribean(such as Hispaniola) Tiana was the ninth princess honored, for her spirit of hard work and never losing sight of what truly matters in life. 

Southernlands-A loose scattering of various areas just below Maldonia referred to collectively as the Southernlands. They're hot and humid and swampy areas. This is where Florida(where Dumbo takes place) and New Orleans are, and they're based on their 1920's selves. Another location of note is a farm called Little Patch of Heaven, currently run by Pearl's adopted daughter Peony. This is also where the Powhatan tribe is.

Pocahontas is the leader of her tribe. As a woman, she only rules over her tribe and not the neighboring ones, as that's how it is in her culture, but she still guides them carefully.  She was the seventh of the 14 Great Queens to be honored for her strength and willingness to treat others with respect, even if they were different. Modeled after 1600's Southeast Coast  area(Virginia)

Hawaii is off the coast of the Southernlands, based off the 1880's kingdom. Lilo and Nani live here 

Wonderland, Neverland, Andalasia, similar worlds-These all exist in Auradon, but defy actually existing on maps. Cartographers never really know how to portray them, so they're usually just placed at random with a disclaimer that says 'exists in a place beyond imagination' 

Atlantica-Out in the ocean, near Uoshan, with their own culture and rules in place. Ruled by Queen Tamika, who took over the position at the request of an aged King Triton who wanted some years of rest for himself. Atlantica is a massive tourist attraction, with many humans gawking and bothering the merfolk during their visits, unable or unwilling to understand the specific etiquette they're asked to abide by. While the merfolk are happy to have visitors and many who are interested in their ways of life, many people are just there to watch shows and have an exotic vacation away from home, leaving Atlantica often trashed and disrespected. The tourists don't even learn basic things about the language or etiquette, just expecting the merfolk to do it for them, or seeing merfolk as exotic and beautiful. Triton is saddened by what's become of his court and with his daughters attempt to clean everything up, but he also knows to outright ban tourism would raise too many questions. So, they are forced to grin and bear it. 

Merfolk have their own language, indistinguishable to many, because to the untrained ear it sounds like bubbles popping. They also have magic, a special brand known simply as ‘mermaid magic’ as it takes on many different forms depending on the person. Using their magic, merfolk can become human and vice versa for easier trade, travel, and comfort. Triton's daughters, being princesses, are actually sirens, and have stronger powers than their peers, such as Ariel's Siren Song. 

Citizens of Atlantica, while fearing Ursula and others like her, ultimately see magic as a neutral force, dependant on who is using it. Ariel and all of her sisters are blessed specifically with Siren Song, an extremely beautiful melody that captures the attention of anyone who hears it, as well as their own special power, also activated through their voice. All of their children have that as well alongside the usual magic, manipulating water and waves. Another aspect unique to merfolk are the fact almost all of them have multiple children. Ariel and her sisters were not a fluke, most merpeople have at least seven to ten children, sometimes all of the same sex. Even if they only have one child, the sheer number will result in many cousins and etc Despite popular belief, most royal families in Auradon do not have multiple children, just wanting one, and occasionally another if they so desire, so this custom is strange to them. 

Merpeople also fall heavily in love when they first meet someone, and it's noticeable to all others. They carry themselves differently and have a different aura. This leads to them thinking of nothing but their love and becoming very clingy, which humans find annoying and strange. Despite Ariel and Eric being in love deeply, most merpeople-human relations fail for that very reason. Merfolk also cry pearls instead of tears, which also causes tension between humans, who take that as a sign mermaids are never hurt and cry beautifully. It leads to their pain never being taken seriously. 
 Their currency is different from Auradon, many assume it's still jewels, which leads to some friction. Merpeople use urchins as their currency, as they are immune to their stinging pricks. Caspia's realm, being very isolated, still uses the old lunar calendar as well, instead of the modern one everyone else uses. 

Atlantica is the main hub of the merprople, but there's seven main seas that each of Triton's daughters rule over, each corresponding to different realms in Auradon. For example, Indira rules over the ocean surrounding Agrabah, and Karina rules Arendelle's sea. That means most Auradonians have seen a mermaid before, even if they didn't recognize it as such. Each merfolk realm has their own specific and different culture as well, such as different ways to greet each other. They have a famous school that regularly competes with Auradon Prep, Shimmering Waters High School. 

Atlantis-Deep in the ocean and not having an exact location outside of a nebulous guess. Based off 1910's Southeast Asia(specifically Cambodia and India) King Milo and Queen Kida spent years reteaching their people their own language and technology, never giving up no matter how frustrating it got. Atlantis is otherwise a utopia, with little work to do and plenty of fun to be had. Eventually, the people learned how to use their technology again. Due to the isolated nature of Atlantis and the more primitive people, Milo and Kida don't really consider themselves part of Auradon proper and don't attend many meetings. Atlantean scientists are studying the crystals to see if they have any use to outsiders, and many people in Atlantis wish to be of use to Auradon as a whole in some way, such as through trade. 

Montressor-Somewhere in the universe. The entire realm of the movie Treasure Planet is actually not part of Auradon, formally, as they have their own queen, system of government, and trade system in place. While Montressor has many students who travel down to Auradon to attend school, that's as much control as either have, simply because it's hard to unify planets and introduce them to a new specific form of government, because there's way more out there than just Montressor 

Common-spoken languages in Auradon are German, French, and English. Almost everyone knows how to speak at least German and French. There's also Urdu, Chinese, Spanish, Polish, Armenian, Norwegian, and then ones spoken by even less people, such as Atlantica's language, Japanese, Dutch, and various indigenous languages, like Hawaiian. 
Tiana and Ariel are the only princesses in my fanfic who have English as a first language, fun fact

I'd love to explain why I chose them. Also some areas didn't have as much explanation about them and that's solely because they have no role in my fanfic and are only there for worldbuilding or because Disney said so(like I am literally never going to do anything with Weselton but it's there because it's in Frozen canon)

Also I didn't talk about Raya or Merida being crowned queens because I've yet to see their movies. However Merida lives in the Republic of Zena anyway, which is another nation across the sea from Auradon where the Pixar movies live

===========================================

Navigating social interactions can be tricky, especially when it comes to delicate subjects like personal hygiene. If you find yourself asking, “How do I tell someone they have bad breath?” you’re not alone. This is a common conundrum that many people face. Bad breath, or halitosis as it's formally known, can be an embarrassing issue for both parties involved. On one hand, you may want to help your friend or colleague improve their oral health and social interactions. On the other, you don't want to hurt their feelings or embarrass them in front of others. In this article, we’ll guide you through this tricky territory and provide you with the tools and strategies you need to approach the situation with grace and sensitivity.

Understanding Bad Breath: The Underlying Causes
-----------------------------------------------

Before diving into the how-to of broaching the subject, it's crucial to understand what causes bad breath in the first place. Knowledge of the underlying factors can help you frame your conversation in a more compassionate and informed manner.

### What Causes Bad Breath?

Bad breath can stem from a variety of sources, including:

1. **Poor Oral Hygiene**: This is often the primary culprit. Without regular brushing and flossing, food particles remain in the mouth, leading to bacterial growth.
2. **Diet**: Certain foods like garlic, onions, and some spices can contribute to temporary bad breath. Even healthy snacks like nuts can leave residues that may linger.
3. **Dehydration**: A dry mouth can reduce saliva production, which is essential for washing away bacteria and food particles.
4. **Medical Conditions**: Sometimes, persistent bad breath can signal health issues such as gum disease, respiratory infections, or digestive problems.
5. **Smoking and Tobacco Products**: These not only cause bad breath but also contribute to long-term oral health issues.

By understanding these factors, you can express your concern more tactfully while offering potential solutions. Now, let's get into the nitty-gritty of how to have this awkward but necessary conversation.

How Do I Tell Someone They Have Bad Breath? Choose Your Moment Wisely
---------------------------------------------------------------------

Timing is everything, right? It’s crucial to pick the right moment to discuss someone’s bad breath. A crowded room or a busy day at work isn’t precisely the best setting for this kind of chat. It might cause embarrassment for your friend and put you in an awkward position too.

### Ideal Scenarios for the Conversation

Here are a few settings where you can bring it up without making it feel like a public spectacle:

- **One-on-One Conversations**: A private, relaxed environment is always best. Think along the lines of going out for coffee or hanging out during a casual walk.
- **After a Meal**: If you’ve just shared a meal, the topic of oral hygiene might naturally come up, and you can gently steer the conversation that way.
- **When They Comment on Your Breath**: If they mention something about freshening up, that’s your cue to bring it up.

Let’s break down how you can actually approach this conversation when the moment feels just right.

Approaching the Conversation with Care
--------------------------------------

Once you’ve determined that the moment is right, it’s time to tread lightly! You don’t want to come off as judgmental or rude; thus, it’s essential to craft your words carefully.

### Use “I” Statements

Instead of directly accusing them of having bad breath, try focusing on your own experience. This helps soften the blow. For example, you could say:

- “I noticed that sometimes there’s a bit of an odor after we eat lunch.”
- “I’ve been really conscious about my oral hygiene lately, and it made me think of how we can sometimes overlook things.”

Using “I” statements keeps the focus on your feelings rather than placing blame.

### Offer Solutions Subtly

Once you've gently brought it up, you can suggest some helpful tips or products. Here’s how you can do it seamlessly:

- **Share Personal Experiences**: “You know, I’ve started carrying mints because I drink so much coffee and it sometimes leaves an aftertaste.”
- **Mention Goodies**: “Have you tried those new mouthwash strips? I’ve heard great things about them!”

This not only provides help without being overly direct, but it also shows that you’re coming from a place of care and concern.

Being Direct but Kind
---------------------

Sometimes, subtle hints just won’t cut it. If the situation calls for it and you feel comfortable enough, you might need to be a little more straightforward. But how do you achieve that without stepping on toes?

### Timing and Tone

Be direct, but pick your tone wisely. A calm, caring demeanor will go a long way towards softening the impact. You'll want to use gentle language and maintain a supportive attitude.

### Example Approaches

If you're in a position where you feel directness is needed, try one of these phrases:

- “Hey, I value our friendship, so I wanted to mention something that might be a bit uncomfortable… I’ve noticed your breath sometimes has a strong odor, and I thought you’d want to know.”
- “Can we have a quick chat? I’ve got something a bit awkward to share, but I promise it’s out of genuine concern.”

While it may seem daunting, approaching the matter with kindness, honesty, and respect can foster understanding rather than defensiveness.

Using Humor to Lighten the Mood
-------------------------------

If you know the person well enough and believe they'd appreciate some light-hearted banter, humor can be a powerful icebreaker.

### Crafting a Playful Approach

When used appropriately, humor can ease the tension. Here are a couple of options:

- “You know what’s the downside of garlic bread? It tastes amazing, but I was left wondering if we need to schedule a breath intervention later!”
- “You must be trying out for a role in a dragon movie; I’ve never met someone who can breathe such fire!”

Make sure the recipient understands your playful intent, so they don’t take offense. Humor should always be used cautiously, as it can easily backfire if the person is sensitive.

Creating a Safe Space for Discussion
------------------------------------

After addressing the issue, it’s essential to create an environment where your friend feels safe discussing their concerns. This way, they can open up about their health or personal situations that may contribute to bad breath.

### Opening Up the Dialogue

Encourage open communication by saying something like:

- “I’m here for you if you ever want to chat about this or anything else. We all have challenges we face, and it’s nothing to be ashamed of.”
- “It’s totally normal to deal with oral health issues; let’s figure it out together.”

Make it clear that your friendship means a lot and that you two can help each other in many aspects of life, including personal hygiene.

Addressing Potential Defensiveness
----------------------------------

It’s human nature to become defensive when confronted with anything that involves personal critique. You must tread carefully and prepare for various reactions.

### Recognizing Their Feelings

Your friend might feel embarrassed, defensive, or even upset at first. That’s perfectly human. Recognizing their feelings is critical:

- “I understand this might be tough to hear. I truly care about you and want our friendship to thrive!”

Reassurance is key. Let them know this won't change how you feel about them. Be patient as they process what you’ve just shared.

When Should You Snoop for Support?
----------------------------------

Sometimes, the person might not take the news well, or they might refuse to acknowledge there's an issue. If that's the case, consider reaching out to their close friends or family members. After all, having a support network can lead to constructive conversations when it comes to personal matters.

### Taking a Team Approach

If the person continues to ignore signs of their bad breath and it affects social gatherings, a team approach might work:

1. **Involve Friends**: Have a spontaneous gathering with a small circle of friends where everyone shares tips about oral hygiene.
2. **Health Professional**: Suggest a general check-up to rule out any medical issues, presenting it as a group idea that can benefit everyone.

By approaching it collectively, you reduce the sting of isolation. It makes the discussion less about singling someone out and more about group improvement.

Ensuring Follow-Up
------------------

Once the conversation is over, it’s important to follow up. Make sure that your friend knows you’re still at their side as they navigate the change.

### Checking In

A month later or so, you might bring it up again casually, showing your support, such as:

- **Casual Reminder**: “Hey, did you end up trying that toothpaste I recommended? I've found it really works wonders for me!”
- **Offer Help**: “If you ever want to hit the dentist together, I'm game! It can be a good excuse to catch up.”

### Encouraging Progress

Celebrate their efforts whether they start using new products, going to the dentist, or simply becoming more aware of their hygiene. Positive reinforcement can do wonders in making someone feel supported and less self-conscious about their progress.

Conclusion: The Takeaway
------------------------

When you're grappling with the question, ""How do I tell someone they have bad breath?"" remember that kindness is your best tool. Bad breath isn't just about bad habits; it can be linked to underlying health issues—all the more reason to approach the subject gracefully. Choose the right moment, speak from a place of care, and offer solutions that show your support.

At the end of the day, friendships thrive on honesty and empathy, and tackling sensitive topics can strengthen those bonds. So next time you find yourself in this peculiar situation, just take a deep breath (pun intended!), remember that true friends help each other, and that a bit of kindness goes a long way.

It's a challenge, but one that you can handle with the right attitude. Keep the lines of communication open, support them through their journey, and you'll",1,1733569248.0,FreshBreathChampion,0,1.0,False

I was taking coffee on an empty stomach, and I'd just come off a terrible low. I was ready to do some damage to myself, because mania is actually the embodiment of irrational aggression. Infront of me sat this couple. I was facing the lady, and so I called her out. Sweat was dripping like hell. I think she thought I was saying hi or something silly to her. After that, all I remember was knocking my head on the table. I woke up in that clinic at Kimbo, called MTN. They didn't have any emergency psychiatric meds, and all I got were placebos. It was fine, because they dropped me off at my place. I think the lady was a nurse or something, because she was the one explaining Bipolar to the guy. They even bought me next month's medication, and they've been calling me since morning, to check up on me. I wish pharmacies and clinics stocked these medications, because the episode could've driven me mad (am insane already😌). Anyways, am grateful that such a generous couple saw it good to go all the way. May the good Lord bless you all, in whatever you're doing today. Wherever you are, may blessings abundant flow to you.

1h8q3bl,https://www.reddit.com/r/sleeptrain/comments/1h8q3bl/sleep_training_made_our_lives_so_much_better/,Sleep training made our lives so much better.,"Baby just turned 6. I have been reading all the books, all the posts on this sub, since month 4. I was against sleep training- I thought it was cruel and torturous. 

As the months went by, the whole sleeping situation became a nightmare. I was completely isolated (I’m a single mom, so it was really just me and bub here). I had no energy to do anything other than take care of LO. And even that was too much at times. 

After one terrible night of so many wake ups, I cannot even count them, I reread precious little sleep, and I decided on sleep training. 

Honestly, it was much more harmonious than I thought. I even felt my baby had more space to himself and I was just making him very uncomfortable. I was getting in his way. 

Of course, there were tears, there are always tears, every day for one reason or another, but I was right there with him, and I knew he needed to learn the skill for his own development. In addition to being rested during the day. I want to add that before sleep training, he was so cranky during the day and wanted to nap constantly. It was clearly unhealthy for him.

On day one (last monday), he fell asleep within six minutes. I feel I got lucky. The following night, he fell asleep within 13 minutes and one check-in. He was still waking up at night, but I didn’t cave in to soothing- just loving check ins re affirming what we were doing. On the third night, he fell asleep with no crying.!!!!!!!! I couldn’t even believe it. He does wake up for his two bottles, which I don’t wanna cut off at the moment. I have just been keeping this up since Monday and our lives are so much better. I can’t believe I’m writing this as I sit my cup of coffee feeling super rested, while he’s in his play mat. 

For the first time I feel like going back out into the world. I was so terribly sleep deprived I thought my life was gone. Now I want us to go out for lunch, to fares, to the pool. It is fantastic to feel this way.

I’m not sure why I took so long to start sleep training, but if you have any doubt on starting this, please know is not as cruel as it sounds, and it’s actually very loving towards your baby and your whole family. 

I just wanted to share my story. I am beyond thrilled that our household is peaceful and rested. Sleep is so so so important. I don’t know what would’ve happened if I had just waited it out. And I want to emphasize that sleep training can be done very lovingly and it actually is an act of love (in my opinion). Dude can fall asleep on his own! How awesome is that?

I’ve had my ragdolls for about 6 months now. Got them them from a cattery. My boyfriend and I moved in together about 3 months ago, which is when we blended our cat families (my 8M old ragdolls and his 1YR old british shorthairs). All went well introduction-wise and they all got along great after about 5 days. We had been living in harmony ever since. 

This all changed about a few weeks ago, when my female ragdoll became obsessed with food. She jumps on counters and tables, tries to steal from your plate, tries to steal while cooking or doing dishes, tries to even steal coffee/hot chocolate milk. She also tries to grab the snacks from the other cats when we all feed them snacks together.

We keep trying to gently remove her from any situation but she just keeps going back to whatever she was doing. For example; will jump on the counter 40 times in a row, does not care at all, no matter what you try.

I was diagnosed with Crohns after months of diarrhea back in August as confirmed by 2 colonoscopies. I was then hospitalized n September for a week after a horrible flare up with fevers and put on a 6 week prednisone tapper. The prednisone worked, it calmed things down. The doctor at my IBD center decided not to put me on biologics but gave me Imuran and sent me for bloodwork every 4 weeks. Afrer the first bloodwork in late November he called me and told me to stop the Imuran since my liver results are bad. He then consulted what to do and called me this week with 3 options:
1. if no active inflamation is found on MRI (planned for January) and a subsequent colonoscopy then he will let me be without medical intervention ""until or unless I start feeling worse"",
2. if inflamation is found they might reclassify me to UC (since he is not sure its Crohns) and he said ""there are medicines for that""
3. if there is active Crohns I will be put on biologics

It seems all of this is just taking so long. I have been feeling OK since coming out of hospital, have started eating normal food and kept off coffee and alcohol.

But I am afraid the flair up will come roaring back and I have nothing to stop it but some Prednisone I have left. Is this normal?

I go to an IBD center in what is one of the most renowned hospitals in my country. The doctor is a young guy, hes very cooperative and active but it just seems like its dragging on. 

He did an endoscopy a month ago and that was all clear.

1h8ppu9,https://www.reddit.com/r/PakistanRishta/comments/1h8ppu9/24_m_seeking_the_love_of_my_life/,24 m seeking the love of my life ,"Gender: Male


Age: 24


Height & Build: 5'5"", relatively fit


Relationship Status: Single


Education & Profession:
I have a Bachelor’s in Software Engineering and currently work as a software engineer in Sydney, Australia.


A Little About Me:
I was born and raised in the UAE and I have spent much time in Pakistan tbh, originally from Punjab. These days, I’m living the Sydney life, balancing my tech career with my love for the outdoors(I know it's quite cliche 🤣). I’m a practicing Muslim who doesn’t smoke, drink, or do drugs. I’d call myself a coffee addict and an adventurous soul who enjoys camping, hiking, fishing, and long walks. I also love gaming when I’m not exploring the great outdoors. Romantic at heart, I value honesty, love, and strong family connections.


Family:
I come from a Punjabi family with two older brothers, one younger brother, and my amazing mom and dad. We’re big on supporting each other and value good vibes all around.


Where I Live:
I currently reside in Sydney and stay in an apartment.


Religion:
I am a practicing Muslim as I pray all the prayers and have done umrah multiple times in my life. I keep all my fasting in order aswell and hopefully you are aligned on the same level as me.


What I’m Looking For:
I’m looking for someone who is kind, beautiful in her own way, and amazing to be around. A partner who values family, has a positive outlook on life, and enjoys the little adventures. Bonus points if you love coffee and are up for camping or fishing trips!


Deal Breakers:
I don’t get along with overly emotional or cold personalities, and I’d prefer someone with no major family issues. Excessive male friendships or negativity in relationships are also not my vibe. I don't mind if you had past relationships as long as you have overcome it.


My Timeline:
I’m hoping to take the plunge in about 2 years. In the meantime, I’d love to get to know the right person and grow together. The reason for this is that I wish to build my financial situation a bit more and then get married.


Why You Should Say Yes:
If you’re someone who wants a romantic, caring, and supportive partner who can cook almost everything, I’m your guy. I’ll always prioritize our happiness, keep the spark alive, and make sure life feels like an adventure we’re on together.


Let’s connect if this sounds like the kind of journey you’re ready for!

# Rethink Journaling Beyond the 'Perfect Day' Myth

For many, the idea of daily journaling might seem cliché, especially with numerous influencers portraying it as a staple in their 'perfect day' routines.

This depiction often features pristine journals laid out on immaculate desks and a steaming cup of artisan coffee nearby. Such portrayals can create the impression that journaling—and, by extension, life itself—should be a flawless aesthetic experience, leading to unrealistic expectations. It's important to recognize that the lives influencers present are curated snapshots, not complete narratives of everyday reality.

Daily journaling is valuable not because it is part of a picture-perfect routine but because it offers a genuine space for personal reflection and emotional processing. By journaling, you confront real thoughts and emotions, which is far more beneficial than emulating an idealized lifestyle that might look appealing on camera but is rarely sustainable.

Embrace journaling for its ability to provide a private, unfiltered medium for [**self-discovery**](https://www.agegracefullyamerica.com/your-journey-of-self-discovery/) and emotional resilience, not because it's trendy or looks good in photos.

It started off lightly with a heated argument on who does the dishes and other chores in my household. 

I, as a 17 year old have an important examination coming soon. It'll practically determine my job, social life, ETC. 

So what happened was i argued with my parents that my little sister (13F) should be doing the chores in the replacement of me because of the lack of time that i have. (abit of side info, i go to class by 6 in the morning and classes end by 4 PM.) so i practically had no time to myself since i also work as an english tutor for a school, (4:30 PM to 6 PM). 
For the remaining time that i have left. Which is 4 hours. Id rather study, relax, cook myself dinner, play games, hop on call with my mates or anything else except for chores. 

It escalated to me being hit on the leg with a wooden rod and it left a semi nasty mark on my leg, which is swelling.(i had it checked out 2 hours ago and the doctor said I'll be fine as long as i get enough rest. But yet, as soon as i get home. Im greeted with chores and more chores. I don't get to rest or anything. 

I get 5 to 6 hours of sleep everyday which is definitely not enough for 9 hours worth of classes. Which is why i abuse coffee. Strong coffee.

Anyways, we continued to argue after i got back from the clinic and it ended up with my parents insulting me for not taking my sisters time into consideration. Like hello? I have an exam coming up and im tired as it is. As soon as i wake up its classes, after that its work. Just that takes 12 hours of my time. Not including hanging out with friends or slacking off. 

It ended up with me insulting my parents in a very disturbing way. Which lead to my mother crying. 

Yes, what i did was wrong and i acknowledge that. I wasn't in my right mind and i exploded without thinking of the consequences. But it still hurt me that my parents didn't give me any space in that matter.
