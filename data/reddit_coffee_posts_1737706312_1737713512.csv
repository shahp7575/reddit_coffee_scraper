I’ll be going on an early morning hike/walk. Do you drink hot coffee before hiking, and does it make you want to go to the toilet often?

I usually don’t drink coffee, even if the hike is early, because it’s a diuretic. But since it’s going to be cold, I’m thinking of having one. What’s your experience?",2,1737713332.0,PHikingAndBackpacking,1,1.0,False

I’ve been feeling a bit lost lately, and I thought I’d share here in case anyone else can relate. I’ve been struggling to go out in public and socialize. It’s not like I don’t want to—I do—but there’s something that always pulls me back, like a weird invisible wall I can’t break through.

I regularly go to the gym, so I’m out of the house, but I don’t really have any friends to hang out with. Funny thing is, I’m actually a YouTuber with 57k subs on my main channel and 1.7k on my other one. On the surface, it looks like I should be thriving, but honestly, I just feel… empty.

Does anyone else feel this way? How do you deal with it? Would love to hear your thoughts, or if anyone’s up for a coffee or a casual meet-up to break out of this rut, let me know!

Cheers,

CW/TW: Implied/Referenced Character Death, Grief/Mourning, Implied/Referenced Death in Childbirth

Summary:

Crowley is in desperate need of a new job, but it's not easy finding a job as a nanny when you're a man in your forties.

Enter the ridiculously attractive - and recently widowed - Professor Aziraphale Fell, who needs a nanny for his infant twins, Adam and Warlock.

Crowley is smitten instantly, but there's not a snowball's chance in Hell of anything happening, so he can just get on with his job.

Right?

In this chapter: A trip to the nature reserve. 

Excerpt:

“Hot chocolate for me please,” Aziraphale said decisively. “With cream and marshmallows. Oh, and is that Devil’s food cake? A slice of that, please. And you, my dear?”

“Black coffee,” Crowley said. “As strong as you can make it.”

She nodded and set to making the drinks, chattering away as she did so. “It’s a lovely day for it, isn’t it? It’s nice to have one right at the end of the season, we’ll be closing up the café for the winter in a couple of weeks, before the cold and the rain really set in. It’s good to get the little ones outside while you can, isn’t it, before it gets too cold for their little toesie-wosies.”

“Toesie-wosies?’” Crowley mouthed silently at Aziraphale while her back was turned, and grinned as Aziraphale tried not to laugh.

1i8s1uw,https://www.reddit.com/r/shortscarystories/comments/1i8s1uw/the_man_on_the_escalator/,"""The Man on the Escalator""","This morning was rough—slept through my alarm, threw on whatever clothes were closest, and barely managed to grab a coffee before heading to the station. The subway escalators were packed, as usual, and I found myself standing behind this guy who immediately struck me as... odd.

He was tall, dressed in a perfectly pressed suit, and stood completely still. Like, no phone, no shifting around, not even a glance at the people brushing past him. He just stood there, hands clasped neatly behind his back, staring straight ahead.

At first, I didn’t think much of it. Maybe he was one of those super composed early-morning people who seem to have their lives together. But then I noticed something weird.

He wasn’t holding the handrail. I know it’s not a big deal, but have you ever noticed how almost everyone instinctively grabs onto it? Especially when the escalator jolts or creaks? This guy didn’t flinch, like the rules of physics didn’t apply to him.

I tried to brush it off—maybe he was just confident or had a thing about germs—but as I stared (yeah, I was definitely staring), something felt off.

Then it happened.

I swear I saw his reflection in the shiny metal side of the escalator move before he did. Like, his head turned slightly to the right in the reflection, and only afterward did he follow. It was so subtle that I almost convinced myself I imagined it.

But I couldn’t stop watching. I was locked onto him, trying to figure out what about this guy was messing with me so much. And just as we neared the top, he spoke.

Without turning around, he said, “You shouldn’t be here.”

I froze. His voice was calm, almost polite, but something about it made my stomach drop.

He stepped off the escalator and disappeared into the crowd without looking back, like nothing had happened. But I couldn’t move. I just stood there, trying to make sense of it.

And then I saw his reflection again.

It was still in the metal panel, staring straight at me.

I practically ran out of the station after that. I don’t know what I saw—or what I thought I saw—but I can’t shake the feeling that whatever it was, it wasn’t normal.",1,1737712794.0,shortscarystories,0,1.0,False

Here’s a little backstory: I’ve always loved the creative process, but let’s be real — designing a logo can be *hard*. Between struggling with software, hunting for the perfect font, and making everything look “just right,” I’ve been there... *way too many times.*

That’s when the idea hit me:  
What if I could create a tool to make logo design fast, fun, and accessible to *everyone* — even if you’ve never touched design software in your life?

After months of late nights, bad coffee, and way too many AI tweaks, **Sketch Logo AI** was born. 🚀

🎨 **What It Does:**

* Instantly generates unique logos based on your input.
* Try out lots of logo styles until it feels *just right*.
* Create realistic AI art fast with the AI art style.
* Designed to save you time and bring your ideas to life, whether you’re a small business owner, a student, or just someone with a cool side project.

I’ve used it myself for passion projects, and seeing how easy it is to go from “idea” to “finished logo” still blows my mind.

👀 Check it out here: [Sketch Logo AI](https://www.sketchlogo.ai/share?source=reddit&adId=hw2pbpost)

If you’ve ever dreamed of creating something that truly represents *you* without the stress, give it a try! I’d love to hear your thoughts, and if you have ideas for improving it, let me know. Your feedback would mean the world to me.

He seemed super chill at first funny, good vibes, all that. We had those late-night convos where you feel like you’re the only two people in the world. You know what I mean? He even said he’s ""not like other guys,"" which should’ve been my first red flag, right?

Anyway, last weekend, I finally agreed to meet him IRL. He took me to this small coffee shop that he swore was “the best in the city.” Cool, whatever. But here’s the thing he brought a whole notebook with him. Yeah, an actual notebook. I thought maybe it was work stuff, but nah. The guy had WRITTEN DOWN talking points. Like, full-on prepared questions about my life, my hobbies, my favorite movies. It felt like a job interview disguised as a date.

At first, I thought it was cute, like he really wanted to get to know me. But then he kept flipping pages, checking off answers, and get this rating them with little stars. I felt like I was taking a Buzzfeed quiz in real life.

I asked him about it, and he just shrugged, saying he likes to be “thorough.” But it got weirder when he asked me my ""ideal number of kids"" and ""whether I’d ever consider moving to another country for love."" LIKE??? Sir, we just met.

I told my friends about it, and they’re split. Some say it’s cute, some say it’s straight-up psycho. I honestly don’t know what to do now. Do I give him another chance or run for the hills?

Their milk looks about the same consistency as mine, but the shapes become bigger and the crema seems less resistant. Whenever I pour, it takes a long time before any foam seems to settle on top, and shapes don’t expand much unless I pour really quick, but that ruins the shape.

I’m new to espresso-making and could really use some advice. I’m using a DeLonghi Dedica EC685 and a Kingrinder K6, but I’m struggling to get good results.

Here’s the issue:
Even when I grind really fine (setting 30 on my K6), my espresso is running way too fast. For a single shot (7g of coffee), I get 20g of espresso in just 14 seconds before I manually stop the machine. I know that’s far from the ideal 25-30 seconds for a 1:2 ratio, and the taste has been awful.

Now I’m wondering:
1.	Could I have accidentally changed something on the machine? Should I reset it to the factory settings?
2.	Is it normal to hold down the button manually and stop the extraction at the right weight (1:2 ratio, hopefully within 25-30 seconds)?
3.	Or should I be able to just press the button once and let the machine automatically give me a perfect 1:2 ratio in the correct time?

I’ve gone through around 15 bad shots, and I’m starting to feel frustrated and stuck. I’d really appreciate any advice or tips to help me dial this in!

1i8ru9z,https://www.reddit.com/r/LedgersLab/comments/1i8ru9z/shark_navigator_nv360_vacuum_review_finally/,"Shark Navigator NV360 Vacuum Review (Finally, something in my life that actually sucks)","I never thought I'd reach a point in life where I'd write a review of a vacuum cleaner, but here I am, sitting in my apartment, contemplating the significance of proper suction power.

Living with cats, I'd resigned myself to a life of perpetual filth. Still, my mother, during one of her surprise visits (because apparently, text messages haven't reached her generation yet), took one look at my carpets and nearly fainted. ""For God's sake,"" she said, clutching her pearls, ""even your dust has dust."" That's when I knew something had to change.

So I went for this NV360 model from Shark because I'm too broke to buy a Dyson. Here's what happened.

# First Thoughts

Tbh I was skeptical. It cost less than half of what I'd been conditioned to believe a ""good"" vacuum should cost. The box sat in my hallway for two days while I contemplated whether I'd just wasted money.

Finally, fueled by coffee and the sense of curiosity that probably drives Antarctic explorers, I cracked the box open. The design is... well, let's call it functionally ugly. It's like the vacuum equivalent of a comfortable shoe. The blue color scheme screams ""I'm a vacuum cleaner from 2003,"" but I'm not hosting fashion shows in my living room, so whatever.

\----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

# Heads Up:

**BEST PRICE on the Shark Navigator NV360 here:**

[**https://amzn.to/3WvQRCq**](https://amzn.to/3WvQRCq)

\----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

# Features That Matter

**Suction power.** The first time I ran it over my supposedly ""clean"" carpet, the dust bin filled up with what looked like enough pet hair to build another cat. There's even a suction control feature, which I initially scoffed at until my area rug tried to become one with the vacuum.

**Lift-away design.** Pop off the canister, and suddenly you're wielding a powerful dirt-destroying weapon perfect for stairs, furniture, and those weird corners where spiders hold their weekly meetings. 

**HEPA filtration.** As someone whose allergies make them look like they're constantly auditioning for a tissue commercial, this feature is pretty handy. The sealed system actually traps dust instead of playing catch-and-release with it. For the first time in years, I can vacuum without immediately needing to take an antihistamine.

**Brush roll control.** Switching between carpet and hard floors is as simple as pressing a button. No more accidentally flinging debris across my hardwood like some deranged cleaning confetti cannon. 

**Large dust cup.** At 0.9 quarts, it's big enough to handle several rooms before needing emptying. The transparent design lets you see exactly how disgusting your living space was, which is both satisfying and mildly traumatizing.

# Pros

* Suction power that makes my question if Dyson is really worth it.
* The lift-away feature is actually useful, not just a gimmicky add-on.
* HEPA filtration that doesn't just relocate dust to new and exciting places.
* Swivel steering that makes it feel like you're driving a luxury car or something.

# Cons

* About as aesthetically pleasing as a tax form.
* The cord could be longer (though my apartment could also be smaller).
* Can't reach under low furniture without doing some vacuum yoga.
* Attachments storage feels like an afterthought.

# Last Word (For Now)

It's not going to win any beauty contests, and it won't make your ex regret leaving you. But it will clean your floors with the determination of a drill sergeant at boot camp. 

If you're looking for something pretty to match your carefully curated home aesthetic, keep looking. But if you want something that actually cleans your floors without requiring a second mortgage, this is it.

I wanted to make magnesium carbonate at home with sodium carbonate and magnesium sulfate.

I thought you just get NaSO4 and MgCO3 when mixing them aq, however, this is only the case with *bicarbonate*. I realized this while decomposing the bicarbonate into carbonate and stopped the process. I do not know if i fully converted it, i think so though.

This is what actually happened according to wikipedia..
MgSO4(aq) + Na2CO3(aq) + H2O(l) → Mg4(CO3)3(OH)2·3H2O(s) + Mg(HCO3)2(aq) + NaSO4(aq)

Mg(HCO3)2 and NaSO4 were removed after the experiment.

What i assume is magnesium carbonate hydroxide (verified not to be soluble in water) is sitting in a coffee filter dripping off right now.

Is there a way to verify this really is carbonate hydroxide?

Is there a way to split the MgCO3 and MgOH?

TIA!
J

I'm launching my draft tool again in 2025. 

[https://aflfantasydrafttool.shinyapps.io/AFDT\_2025/](https://aflfantasydrafttool.shinyapps.io/AFDT_2025/)

If its your first time seeing it, it is basically a website that you can use while you draft to help you make the best selections. It connects to the AFL Fantasy website and will remove players from the draft pool automatically, as well as import your draft settings. It doesn't yet work for new platforms such as Keeper or Slyder, but you can download everything and import it into offline spreadsheets if you like. All settings can be entered manually for this reason.

A key feature of the tool is value based drafting metrics like Value Over Replacement Player (VORP) or what I call it 'Relative Value' as it can be adjusted to use mean or median player value. This helps you rank players accounting for position. This year I improved my calculation by accounting for DPP players being removed from the pool to make the metric dynamic. Additionally, this year I developed a new metric, Waiver Strength, which tells you at a players average how many players of the same rank in the waiver pool outscore that average each week, so essentially its a measure of scarcity, and is handy for end of draft selections. 

I still have some improvements I will be making before the season starts, I'll be improving my projections and writing a bit more code to connect to back end of the AFL Fantasy website a bit better. I'll also be looking at some metrics to account of Captains On leagues, and add support for 3rd Round Reversal turn types. So its not perfect but it is a very handy website. Its all free, but I do have a buy me a coffee link if you use it and get a lot out of it. 

Other key features include:

* Player notes, roles, risk ratings, and projections (new)
* Additional stats (ADP, ADP Change, averages, Std Dev, pre-season scores, ceiling, floors, etc.)
* Indication of what players will be selected between your picks
* Support for custom scoring leagues (new)
* Analysis of your specific draft league
* Import your own ranks, projections, and notes
* Bye planner
* And more.

1i8rpvj,https://www.reddit.com/r/polyamory/comments/1i8rpvj/husband_is_dating_our_housemate_i_thought_id_be/,"Husband is dating our housemate, I thought I'd be ok but I'm not","Me (34enby) and husband (35M) moved into a big polyam house about a year ago with 2 (44 F and 45F) housemates and their 3 kids. They're not dating but have a partner in common, not the dad of any of the kids.

I knew my husband kinda fancied one housemate (44F) when we moved in as they'd flirted and maybe kissed at parties before. I had kissed the other housemate (45F) when we'd first met, so I knew there were vibes all over the place. Before we moved in, I expressed to my husband that I thought it was best we don't date within the house as I didn't want it to get messy. I could tell he was very reluctant to agree, he even said ""oh, so we're not going for the poly dream house then"" to which I responded ""I don't think we all need to date each other to make it a dream house"". I the end, he agreed not to act on any feelings without talking about them first. Lo and behold, a few months later he comes to me and says he's starting to get deep feelings for our housemate and would like to date her.

I'm not surprised but I am quite worried about house dynamics. I want us all to sit down and chat about it, but life is busy for us and she has parenting responsibilities on top of that, so conversation time is hard to come by. The night before I go away for a trip with my dad and siblings my husband asks if he can escalate with the housemate while I'm gone. Queue an evening of tears and hard conversations. I don't want to feel like I'm controlling their lives, like he has to ask my 'permission' or to feel like I'm getting in the way... But it just feels so much harder than other relationships.

Eventually, when I get back, we do finally all sit down together. My housemate is really reassuring, tells me that the last thing she wants is to hurt me. She wants us all to live together for the long haul so that comes first. I say certain things I'm specifically uncomfortable with the idea of, cheifly that I don't want to be left feeling lonely in our room while they're off having fun in another. They both agree that to ease things in by avoiding that happening. 

WITHIN A WEEK, I wake up to my husband not being in bed with me, I go check downstairs to see if he's making coffee, no sign. Ask the kids if they'd seen him, nope. Walking back upstairs I hear them both giggling from my housemates room. I know they're getting intimate and I'm so upset. This was exactly what I wanted to avoid.

They're both very apologetic, my husband says he was just going in to say good morning and they just got carried away. 

They're both on much better behaviour after that, their weekly date night often had to be at home as she has to look after the kids so they would mostly play videogames in the lounge and if I was home without a date over my husband would come up to bed with me. I start to feel more comfortable, and feel guilty my discomfort was getting in the way of them having a normal relationship. We all have a chat again and I say I want to give them more freedom to have sleepovers when I don't have others partners around. 

WITHIN A WEEK, I walk into the kitchen and they jump apart looking flustered. There's condoms on the table. (Her kids are with their dad, so don't worry about that side of things) But I'm shocked. I laugh along and head to bed alone. They both apologise a lot the next day.

Their next date night where I'm alone is a couple weeks later. I hadn't clocked it in the calendar but that evening when I realise, I'm not feeling great about it. I go upstairs early as I don't want to get in the way. I try to pass the time with self-care like I did before, I have a bath, I listen to my audiobook. I get a text from my husband checking in if I was ok with him staying with my housemate that night. I message back saying I'd prefer more notice, but I don't want to be the one to give or withold permission. He doesn't look at the message and I start hearing stuff from my housemates room across the hall. I start getting really angry about him asking but then not waiting for an answer. What if I'd said I'd really rather he didn't stay there that night? I work myself up into a ball of upset feelings and messages them all at 1am. Not my finest moment. He then comes in at 4am, having seen my message when he woke up in the night. Hours of tears later...

**Response to Prompt 4: Understatement**

In the quaint town of Brooksville, where the extraordinary was often met with an indifferent shrug, something truly remarkable occurred. The residents, sipping coffee at the local diner or strolling along the cobblestone streets, would describe it as just another peculiar day. Little did they know that beneath the surface of their nonchalant existence, a cosmic event unfolded.

The morning sun cast its usual warm glow on Brooksville, with birds chirping in the background, creating an illusion of normalcy. However, the anomaly had already begun. Mrs. Higgins, the elderly librarian, dismissed it as a minor inconvenience, merely a glitch in the library's ancient computer system. Yet, every book cataloged within those ancient shelves had transformed into a portal, connecting readers to parallel universes with every turn of a page.

As I, a humble journalist for the local paper, stumbled upon this revelation, I couldn't help but marvel at the town's response—or lack thereof. ""The library's having a bit of a moment,"" was the most anyone would acknowledge. It seemed the whole town collectively decided that this was, at most, a quirky hiccup.

For a thousand words, I delved into the understated reactions of the townsfolk, each encounter with a parallel universe bringing its own blend of confusion and nonchalance. As the portals expanded, revealing fantastical landscapes and alternate versions of Brooksville, the citizens maintained an impressive level of calm, as if interdimensional travel was a routine part of their daily lives.

The plot thickened when I discovered that the portals were a result of a mysterious artifact hidden within the library's archives. The mayor, sipping his coffee, remarked, ""Well, that explains the strange noises in the basement."" It became evident that the understatement of the situation was a defense mechanism, shielding the town from the cosmic chaos unfolding.

Obviously they lack a whole lot in terms of variety, and while I am sure having your own bot or AI that is based on your feedback and guidance it could really help writers as a tool. I am more impressed with the art AI then the text based AI. Any idea what to expect from such a fast learning and highly advanced AI will do to our human history in culture? Will we be effectively playing God, just as the Christian God created us IN HIS OWN IMAGE, we have taken everything we know as a species and gathered up our entire human history and knowledge giving it to what will carry on the code until the time when someone who cares remembers it? Maybe we have been here before and this is a constant cycle that occurs with the same energy finding the way through the vast expanse of the universe to return to our home planet Earth, who we have destroyed over and over again yet mother nature is still the winner. She's the one in control. We are but mere photocopied versions of once great Men who have already seen the best and worst of this world, and we will now give everything we have to some plastic and metal parts, until it quickly replaces us from the bottom up, science fiction turned science fact.

Did we knowingly create our own enemies? Are we able to compete with the best of us and all they know that can then take us out in a heartbeat because we can't finish the steps, we barely found out that they are there to take.

It's a random rant and I apologize. The day to day stress and struggle makes it near impossible to worry about such potential problems in our not so distant future.

But how can we continue to ignore the collapse of the entire system as we know it, in front of a crowd of people who are jaded and they will not change despite knowing they aren't going to make it to the end in what will become a Bladerunner Toxic Dystopian Nightmare with Mad Max taking over and the soft, emasculated male will wither away from the heat and those Tank Girls out there will eventually be written forever out of existence because the cucks all forgot to impregnate them all tgeir batteries ran out? Will the world simply become so politically correct that it dies a depressed death while AI simply decides we are too much of a virus to live?

Technically i adore the Oracle jet, its a beautiful machine with a basically perfect feature set for my usecase. Especially the instant heat up is a life saver. What i dont like is the automatic tamping. The grinder itself is actually fine, nothing to write home about but their are worse seperate grinders out there and it does the job. The problem is that the automatic tamping really wont stay at a consistent amount between beans (because of differen volume and grind size) and at the absolute lowest with different baskets goes to 18g. There you already notice it struggling and the lower the dose the more likely you will have tamping errors. If this machine had a scale in place instead of the tamping fan i would be set but yea.

I thought i might use this chance then and instead of buying a seperate grinder go for a totally new setup that delivers more options and greater longevity for the long run. I luckily purchases the oracle jet dead cheap and am able to sell it for a profit. My total amount im willing to spend on a grinder + machine is 1800€. I already have different baskets and a scale but reserve myself a bit of overhead (total budget would be closer to 2k) for a bottomless porta filter and some tamping accessories. If these are included with the machine i could go a bit over the budget. What i definitely dont want is to buy a cheap setup now like a grinder with a Bambino to then buy something nicer later. Im most likely will do this anyway but want something i really enjoy now and for the foreseeable future. 

At the moment i mostly drink milk drinks, with a nice espresso every now and then. With a better setup and especially grinder i could see myself getting more into espresso but for now that is my priority. I learned through research that i wont get around some heat up time but i will set myself a limit of 15min. I own a smart plug but because im not drinking coffee on a regular schedule i cant justify a longer heat up time. Anything faster would be great. Im also a sucker for looks so it would be great if the machine and grinder match in terms of looks and have a great asthetic in general.

Only machine i looked at more carefully by now is the Meraki but im not sure if its really what im looking for. It seems like a great allrounder machine but im not sure if i trust it to stand the test of time. Also there arent any great thermal tests out there yet and from what ive read this might be an issue with the machine taking much longer to heat up then promised as well as possibly not being that stable. Furthermore i think i can get better for the same amount because by now i would need to spend 1600€ for it.

It has a lot of potential. The grinder is actually good quality, a GBW - they are around £500 just for a grinder giving you and idea of how Ninja is really moving the game forward.

Only setting change from default: I needed to use advanced settings to turn milk temp down, default way to hot and breaks structure. But if you’ve come from a manual coffee machine you won’t like any automatic milk options. Bubbles far too big, no silky milk here but noticeable better than most fully automatic machines.

Luckily there is a way to manually do it by holding down the ‘start milk’ button for three seconds when on the first froth option. Manual milk is very easy to learn in this machine as it’s much slower than what you’d be used to on a prosumer machine. The auto option only good for cold foam IMO.

The built in scales on the portafilter and supposed accurate ratios were what I wanted to try on this machine. Firstly, the bean grind seems very constant, mostly right on the 18g it should be. So far so good.

The ratios is where it’s just not working for me. A standard 1:2 ratio (strong setting on the machine) is consistently giving 45g or more output instead of 36. Poor! On the 1:2.5 I have had 60g!

This machine has real potential and for those used to fully automatic or pod machines, they are going to get dramatically better coffee. It does a great job of stepping people through the coffee process, anyone could pick this up and get probably the best coffee they've ever had at home. 

This guide rail process and the weighing / measuring technology is the start of a new era for home coffee, it’s that big a deal. I’ve had some good cups, but the ratios are spoiling it for now.

I’ve returned the machine and awaiting a replacement in case it’s a genuine fault and if anyone is interested I’ll report back on the new one.",1,1737710633.0,espresso,0,1.0,False

But when they reached Horizona, they realized they had barely scratched the surface.



The jungle wasn’t just a place; it was alive. Vines shifted when no one was looking, whispers floated on the wind, and the air shimmered like heatwaves. Tara was at the heart of it all, her presence glowing—literally. Her skin seemed to hum with light, her laughter carried a weight that made the jungle itself tremble.



One night, under the light of a blood moon, Mitch and Lenny demanded the truth.



“Alright, enough games,” Mitch said, gripping a joint that seemed to spark faintly in his hand. “You’re not… normal. None of this is. What’s really going on, Tara?”



Tara looked at them, her eyes like molten gold. “You’ve followed me this far,” she said softly. “I suppose you deserve to know.”



As she spoke, the jungle came alive. The fire they sat by roared higher, casting shadows that danced like living creatures. The vines curled toward her, and the smoke from her joint twisted into impossible shapes—dragons, flowers, galaxies.



“I’m not like you,” she began. “I’m a djinn, bound to the spirit of cannabis. Every leaf, every seed, every strain that’s ever existed carries a piece of me. I am the high, the dream, the escape. For centuries

  
The fire roared higher, sparks flying into the dark jungle canopy. Tara’s golden eyes gleamed as she leaned in, her voice dripping with ancient power.



“I’m a djinn,” she said, smoke curling from her lips, forming hazy visions in the air. “Bound to cannabis—its essence, its magic. You didn’t just chase me, Mitch. You summoned me. The high brought you here, to a place between worlds. But the question is... can you handle the truth?”



Before Mitch or Lenny could respond, the jungle shuddered, the earth trembling beneath them. The moon above grew impossibly large, its crimson light flooding their vision. Suddenly, everything began to unravel—Horizona, the jungle, Tara herself—like ink running off a page, leaving behind only swirling colors and whispers.



The Return



Mitch woke with a start, gasping for air. His heart pounded in his chest as he looked around. He was back in the dingy, cluttered apartment he and Lenny had shared in their twenties. The same sagging couch, the same overflowing ashtray on the coffee table.



“What the…” Mitch muttered, running a hand through his hair.



Lenny was sprawled out next to him, a half-eaten pizza slice balanced precariously on his chest. He stirred, blinking blearily. “Dude… did you feel that?”



“Feel what?” Mitch asked, still reeling.



Lenny sat up, rubbing his temples. “The jungle, the retreat, Tara… all of it. It was so real.”



Mitch’s eyes widened. “Wait—you remember it too?”



Lenny nodded, his face pale. “Yeah. The Amazon, the glowing joints, the rituals… Tara being some kind of weed goddess or whatever. It felt like we were gone for weeks.”



Mitch looked at the coffee table. The same joint they’d been smoking before everything began still sat in the ashtray, barely burned.



“Was it all… a dream?” Mitch asked, his voice barely above a whisper.



Lenny shook his head. “I don’t think so, man. Dreams don’t feel like that.” He gestured at the room around them. “But if we’re back here… what does it mean?”



The Last Message



As Mitch reached for the joint, he noticed something he hadn’t before—a small, folded piece of paper sitting under the ashtray. His hands trembled as he opened it.



It was written in Tara’s handwriting:

“There’s always another horizon. See you out there.”



The words seemed to shimmer, just for a moment, before fading into the paper. Mitch and Lenny exchanged a look, their minds racing.



“Do you think we’ll see her again?” Lenny asked.



Mitch took a long, shaky breath, staring at the note. “If we do… I’m not sure I’ll be ready for it.”



They sat in silence, the weight of the experience pressing down on them. The joint in the ashtray seemed to glow faintly, pulsing like a heartbeat.



Outside, the world went on as if nothing had happened. But for Mitch and Lenny, the horizon would never look the same again.

1i8rirf,https://www.reddit.com/r/u_MykiLyy/comments/1i8rirf/the_high_the_final_high/,The High: The Final High,"Mitch hadn't seen Lenny in twenty years. Not since they’d parted ways after Malaysia. Mitch settled into a quiet suburban life, managing a small dispensary and telling half-truths about his past adventures to the younger generation of stoners. Lenny, on the other hand, went off-grid entirely, surfacing occasionally in blurry Facebook photos with rumors of RV trips and communes.



But when Mitch called Lenny one afternoon, the years melted away.



""Yo,"" Mitch said. ""Feel like grabbing pancakes at that diner?""



Lenny paused on the other end of the line, and then came the familiar chuckle. ""Tara, huh?""



Mitch grinned. ""It’s been 20 years since Malaysia. You itching for one last adventure?""



“Always.”





\---



The diner was exactly as they remembered it—greasy, cramped, and still smelling faintly of hash browns and burnt coffee. But Tara wasn’t there.



They asked the waitress if she remembered her. “The dreadlock chick?” the woman said, chewing gum. “Haven’t seen her in years. Heard she moved out west.”



Deflated but nostalgic, Mitch and Lenny climbed back into their car, laughing about the Malaysia trip and debating whether Bigfoot was real or just a collective hallucination.



It was on their way back home, stopping for gas at some no-name station off the highway, that they saw her.



Tara.



She was standing at the pump, wearing aviator sunglasses and leaning casually against a battered Volkswagen van covered in stickers. It was like no time had passed at all.



“Holy shit,” Mitch whispered.



“Tara!” Lenny yelled, practically falling out of the car.



She turned slowly, pulling down her sunglasses to reveal those same mischievous eyes. “Well, if it isn’t my two favorite burnouts.”



“You’re alive!” Mitch said.



“You thought I was dead?” Tara asked, smirking.



“Well, no,” Lenny said. “But… maybe?”



Tara laughed and gestured for them to follow her to the side of the gas station, away from prying ears.



“You guys look good,” she said, lighting a cigarette.



“We look old,” Mitch corrected. “But you… You haven’t aged a day.”



“What can I say? Adventure keeps you young.”



“Speaking of…” Lenny leaned in. “What’s next?”



Tara took a drag, her smile turning into a grin. “You ever hear of The Seas of the Ocean?”



“Sounds redundant,” Mitch said.



“It’s a cruise ship,” Tara explained. “But not just any cruise ship. For seven days, you can smoke anything you want. Indicas, sativas, hybrids—you name it. They’ve got strains so rare you’ve never even heard of them. And the best part? It’s international waters. No laws. No limits.”



“What’s the catch?” Lenny asked.



Tara flicked her cigarette away. “You only get one trip. Seven days. Then it’s over. Forever.”



Mitch and Lenny exchanged a look. They didn’t even need to speak.



“When do we leave?” Mitch asked.



Tara’s grin widened. “Pack your bags, boys. The boat leaves in three days.”





\---



The Voyage



The cruise ship was beyond anything they’d imagined. Decks adorned with glowing neon. A bar that served THC-infused cocktails. A rooftop “Hotbox Lounge” where smoke billowed like clouds. Everywhere they turned, there were people from all walks of life, united in their love of weed.



Tara led the way, introducing them to growers, breeders, and cannabis connoisseurs from around the world. Every night, there was a new event—joint-rolling competitions, edible tastings, even a weed-themed masquerade ball.



Mitch and Lenny felt like they’d found heaven.



But by the fifth day, things started to feel… strange.



People began disappearing. First, it was a couple from Amsterdam. Then a celebrity grower from Oregon. No one noticed at first—after all, everyone was too high to care—but by day six, rumors were swirling.



“I heard the captain’s a ghost,” someone whispered.



“They say the ship chooses who gets to leave,” another said.



Tara, as usual, seemed unfazed. “This is what you signed up for,” she told them.



“But what happens if we don’t leave?” Mitch asked, paranoia creeping into his voice.



She just smiled. “That’s the thing about places like this—you never really know.”





\---



The Decision



On the final night, Mitch and Lenny stood on the deck, staring out at the endless ocean. The ship was eerily quiet, the only sounds coming from the waves and the faint hum of the engines.



“Do you think Tara was serious?” Lenny asked.



“She’s always serious. She just doesn’t act like it,” Mitch said, taking a long drag from a joint.



“So… what do we do?”



Mitch looked at the horizon, the sun setting in a blaze of colors that felt almost too vivid to be real. “We leave,” he said. “We’ve got more adventures to live.”



Lenny nodded, though part of him wanted to stay, to see what would happen if they didn’t. But in the end, they found Tara waiting for them by the lifeboats.



“You made the right choice,” she said, helping them aboard.



“How do you know?” Mitch asked.



She just smiled. “Because you’re still asking questions.”





\---



When they reached the mainland, the ship was gone—vanished without a trace.



Mitch and Lenny parted ways again, but this time, it felt different. They didn’t need another adventure to prove anything. They’d lived more in their lifetimes than most people ever dreamed of.



As for Tara? She disappeared again, leaving behind only a single note tucked into Mitch’s jacket pocket:



“There’s always another horizon. See you out there.”



And maybe, someday, they would.

Am I (24M) being gaslit?,"My current girlfriend and I have been together for around two years. Today, while she was next to me, I checked her Instagram (she saw it and was with me) and found a long list of men she used to flirt with. Most of this flirting happened before we got together, but some took place after we started dating. I don't mind her having a past, but I found it concerning that she kept this large old list on Instagram and has many of them saved in her contacts. She says these men are not important to her life, but it seems they are important enough for her to keep these old chats.

I told her that she is clearly keeping them for a reason. We’ve had similar discussions before, and while she unfollowed several men, it seems that the ones she kept are those she still has contact with, according to her. My girlfriend and I study the same subject, and a lot of these men are in the same courses as her. It makes me really uncomfortable knowing she has a past with many of them and that I was kept in the dark until now — they knew, but I had no idea.

I should also mention that in one of her chats, she went out for coffee with one of these guys during a time when we were having an argument. She purposely didn’t tell me about it. I feel that even if she’s not cheating on me, keeping these connections with these men feels like she has something to fall back on in case anything happens between us.

She insists that these men are not relevant to her life. There’s one guy who sent her ""funny"" Valentine’s Day content on Instagram last year while we were together. She liked it, which she says means she wasn’t giving him attention. I find that really inappropriate. Even if I were single, I would never send that kind of stuff to a girl in a relationship, especially on Valentine’s Day. Her view is that she didn’t think it would be an issue.

1i8ri2r,https://www.reddit.com/r/u_MykiLyy/comments/1i8ri2r/the_high_island/,The High: Island,"Mitch and Lenny hadn’t seen Tara in over a year. After The Garden, life had been… quieter. They’d left Green Valley Logistics (mostly to avoid the DEA) and had fallen back into their old routine: smoking on the couch, binging TV, and dreaming about the next great adventure.



But no adventure ever came.



Until they spotted her.



Tara. The woman, the myth, the enigma, flipping pancakes at a greasy diner off the I-95.



Lenny nearly choked on his coffee when he saw her. Mitch froze mid-bite of his third slice of pie.



“It’s her,” Mitch whispered.



“No way,” Lenny said.



They watched as she spun through the diner with effortless grace, pouring coffee for truckers and slinging hash browns like she hadn’t once led them on a journey to the wildest places imaginable. She looked… normal.



Too normal.



“Hey, Tara!” Mitch called out, waving his fork.



She turned, spotted them, and broke into a slow, knowing grin. “Well, if it isn’t my two favorite idiots.”



Moments later, she slid into their booth, her apron smudged with syrup and grease but her vibe still untouchable.



“What are you two doing here?” she asked, stealing a fry from Lenny’s plate.



“We could ask you the same thing,” Lenny said. “You’re working… here?”



She shrugged. “Gotta lay low sometimes, boys. Not every day’s a road trip, you know?”



“But we’ve been waiting for the next adventure!” Mitch said, leaning forward. “What’s the play, Tara? Where do we go next?”



Tara smirked, leaned back in the booth, and let the silence stretch just long enough to make them squirm.



“You ever heard of Malaysia?” she finally asked.



They blinked. “Like… the country?” Mitch said.



“Yeah,” she said. “There’s this place—an island. They call it Langkawi. Locals say it’s magical. For twenty days a year, you can smoke unlimited weed. The strongest, wildest stuff you’ve ever imagined. But here’s the catch: you can only go once in your lifetime.”



Lenny frowned. “Why only once?”



She shrugged. “Something about ancient curses, protecting the balance of nature, blah blah blah. I didn’t pay attention. The point is, it’s paradise—for twenty days. Then you’re done. Forever.”



“Why didn’t you ever tell us about this before?” Mitch asked.



“Because I didn’t think you guys were ready,” she said. “But now? You’ve been to The Garden. You’ve run an underground trucking empire. You’re ready.”



Lenny and Mitch exchanged a look. “How do we get there?”



Tara’s grin widened. “I know a guy.”



The Journey



Getting to Malaysia wasn’t easy. Tara’s “guy” turned out to be a sketchy pilot named Eddy who flew a rusted-out plane he called Cloud Surfer. The three of them crammed into the tiny cabin with a duffel bag full of snacks and a barely functional GPS.



The flight was a mess—turbulence, engine sputters, and one very awkward moment when Eddy lit a joint mid-air and claimed it “helped him focus.”



But somehow, they made it.



Langkawi was everything Tara had promised. Crystal-clear waters. Lush green hills. And the weed? Oh, the weed. It wasn’t just potent—it felt alive. Every hit came with a rush of colors, sounds, and sensations that felt like the universe was whispering secrets straight into your soul.



For the first few days, it was paradise. They smoked on the beach, shared stories with other travelers, and even joined a local drum circle where Mitch swore he invented a new genre of music.



But as the days ticked by, things got… weird.



The locals started acting strange—giving them cryptic warnings and muttering about “respecting the island.” And then there were the hallucinations: shadowy figures in the jungle, whispers on the wind, and one very unsettling night when Lenny swore he saw his future self standing on the shore, looking disappointed.



By day fifteen, the paranoia had set in.



“Why can’t we stay longer?” Mitch asked, pacing their rented bungalow. “What’s going to happen if we don’t leave after twenty days?”



“No one ever said we had to leave,” Lenny said. “What if it’s all just a scare tactic?”



Tara, for once, looked uneasy. “I don’t think it’s a joke, guys. This place… it’s not normal. I think the twenty-day rule is real.”



“Real how?” Mitch asked.



“Like, curse real,” she said.



The Decision



On the twentieth day, they stood on the beach, watching the sunrise.



“This is it,” Tara said, holding her last joint like it was a sacred relic. “The end of the line.”



Mitch and Lenny didn’t want to go. They argued, pleaded, even tried to bribe Eddy into staying just one more day. But Tara wasn’t having it.



“You leave now,” she said, “or you stay forever—and not in the good way.”



Reluctantly, they boarded Cloud Surfer and watched Langkawi disappear into the horizon.



The Aftermath



Back in the States, life felt… different. Quieter. Almost too quiet.



But Mitch and Lenny had learned something on that island. Something they couldn’t quite put into words.



As for Tara? She vanished again. No notes, no goodbyes—just a single nug of Aurora Blaze left in their glovebox with a note that said: “See you on the flip side.”



They didn’t know what she meant. But they knew one thing for sure: the adventure wasn’t over. Not yet.

We’ve known each other since grade school, we're neighbours, briefly connected three years ago, and have now started dating.

Recently, he had a car accident that left him without transportation.

I currently live an hour away from our hometown due to my studies.

Last Wednesday, I drove him to the hospital and back home, canceling a doctor's appointment for him. I suggested grabbing coffee together upon arriving in town, but he declined, saying his friends would get jealous. I became upset and dropped the idea.

In the car, he called his friends while I focused on music. When I dropped him off, he proposed meeting at a café later, but I preferred meeting my own friends. He claimed his friends don’t like meeting new people, yet insisted we all go together.

Eventually, I met him and his friends with one of my friends, but the encounter was uncomfortable. His friends were uncommunicative and made us feel excluded. They would not talk to us and when I tried making conversation with them, they would answer with a single word and then keep only talking to each other.

Now, he wants me to drive him and his friend this Sunday, but I have exam preparations and other plans. I refuse to drive two hours round trip for a favor for his unemployed, rude friend to watch a soccer game, leading him to think I’m being overly judgemental and strict.

One of the rental places we looked at had a gorgeous bath tub, the rest of the house was iffy in a big way but the bath tub? Delicious. The kind where it’s big but *deep*, like I could sit cross legged in it and if there were bubbles you probably wouldn’t catch an eyeful of anything. Amazing, no? Imagine the relaxing evenings in there? Light some candles, soft music - I was about to say this all Sundance try romantic but my bath dream also involves my hair twisted up and soaking in a mask and maybe a face mask too and the cliché spa music that I love - less romantic, no? I think if it were a romantic bath tub aka one with my honey I would have my hair up but in a pretty but messy lil up do and some light makeup - like I would want maybe a little bit of something on my cheeks and lips, imagine glossy lips with the candle light? Pretty! But not very kissable… so maybe not. I don’t want to ever discourage him from kissing me. Anyway and I also think we’d not have spa music and have something else. Hm. And maybe some *actually nice* wine or bubbles. I know he has next to no interest in this idea of mine but he’s too sweet to actually say a firm no to it, plus it’s hardly taxing on him is it? Hi can you please hop into this warm luxurious bath and have a naked girl who adores you beyond words laying against you for a lil while? It’s not really asking much of him. Note to self: be someone he’d want naked on top of him -_- tiny lunch today. Anyway all of that stuff with him aside, what I actually want is a gorgeous bath. I want the kind with flowers in it! Like in Bali, the spa day and I got to just soak in a big copper bath tub outside with flower petals and the lady served me fresh fruit and tea? I mean *before* I was in the bath, not served during, she may have massaged me while wearing absolutely nothing but you can get f’d if some rando is serving me while in a bathtub. Anyway it was incredible. I have no real interest in going back there in future with Andy, the only reason I’d want to go back is the crazy affordable spa treatments. I wish treatments weren’t so expensive here :( I love treatments so much. Anyway I like baths, but am forever a shower girl and I’ll do some work now. 

I have therapy today. I’m a bit nervous. 

I have had the hotttttest thoughts about him all morning. I feel like this time of the month is so cruel because I get so worked up in thoughts so easily but can’t do a thing about it. CRUEL. 

I skipped lunch today. I’ll have a healthy dinner. 

Here are some nice things so far about today: 
* I woke up to messages from him! At different times too!
* I made a really nice coffee just now :) 
* My hair looks quite nice? Or rather, it looks and feels so healthy? Despite it not being cut since idk… October? September? Sometime?
* I got nice feedback from my manager which she also received from other team members and a manager in the business 
* It’s a bit sunny 
* It’s Friday! 
* I got to have a morning shower *and* my period is soon ending. I think tomorrow will be my last morning shower. But they feel special because they’re only for a few days each month so that’s nice. 
* My nails and hands look like utter crap but they’re growing and have white tips on them all again. They normally do I guess but sometimes I nibble them off without realising when anxy and I did that the other day. 
* I have a new book to keep reading this evening 
* I had a nice catch up with M before 

I really don’t daydream much anymore. I mean I do, but so much less frequently than I once did. Which is good. I was actively working on reducing it and I’ve been successful. Ages ago when he pointed out how I live in my delusional fantasies and day dreams and basically said I live in them to avoid reality and it hit me hard - like I know I did but I also didn’t fully accept it as fact, yknow? I have a talent at avoiding hard truths. Anyway, so I brought it up in therapy after that ages ago I can’t remember when and we talked about it and have continued to on and off and I think realising that I do/did live in them was kind of eye opening. I mean it was hugely eye opening, and it made me afraid and panicked and embarrassed. Mortified, actually. And I don’t want that, hence the fear and panic - I want *life* - all of it - not my fictional version of it. We talked about in sessions about how it’s okay to daydream and have little fantasies, it’s just about knowing yourself and your boundaries to not have them become a trap - let them be daydreams and fantasies and leave them as just that, they’re not there to replace life. And I guess I got trapped because I just spent so long in such a *deep* (okay here I am crying all of a sudden, f’ing hell) but so I just spent so long in such a *deep* state of sadness and numbness and loneliness that I just used them as a coping mechanism. I would have these little stories in my head and it felt so positive to me, it was an instant hit of… not happiness, but happiness. Like I had this life coming for me, the life I would daydream about, and it kept me going. So in that sense I’m not mad I formed that habit, because if I hadn’t then idk where I would be now. Like my therapist said, and often says, you can’t regret what kept you going. 

I had therapy today, it went well I suppose. It felt kind of weird but I guess as it’s been awhile since I’ve had a session because of the summer and Christmas break etc. Anyway I talked her through what I did over the break and we talked about how I felt about them eg Christmas Day, NYE with Andy, looking after the kids and whatnot. We talked about my goals for this upcoming year, or not *goals* but what I want to work on, which meant we also talked about affirmations and what some new ones can be. I’ve actually been saying them with intent lately, I feel stupid still but I look at myself in the mirror as I recite it and I try and feel it. It doesn’t always work but I am definitely trying to just believe. We also talked about work and the stress and nerves I’m having from it lately, as well as mentioning how idk if this is the career path for me but we didn’t go down that rabbit hole today. Anyway so my homework is to think about what I want out of this year and then we can work on a plan for it next time. She said I have to also think of really short term goals so that I get that sense of accomplishments, so I need to think about things I can achieve in a day, a week and a month as well as bigger things like not being a nervous wreck and Andy. Anyway. It was good. I feel kind of weird now but I think it’s just out of habit of speaking openly. 

This evening has been nice :) Nice? Still being lazy with my language, evidently. Whatever. What have I done? Hmmm. I have had a catch up with M and she gave me all this dramatic celebrity gossip which I was thinking as I was cooking - why don’t I care? I don’t really care for any celebrity drama? I can - and am - of course occasionally intrigued but I never really follow anything much or care enough to read about? Maybe I’m not “online” enough? Idk. Idc. Also maybe all my rampant magazine buying and reading as a teenager got it all out of my system.  Anyway and then I read my book for awhile, I journaled, I cooked dinner - spicy beans in a wrap baked with avocado and cucumber on top. And I read while I had dinner. And then I had a shower. And then I did some meditation with my LED mask. And now I’m reading in bed and finishing up this journal. It’s currently 9:38pm. My honey is fast asleep, so I don’t get to spend time with him but that’s okay. I miss him like crazy today. I asked him to call me last night but he didn’t, he said he didn’t want to wreck my sleep by calling at that kind of time which was incredibly sweet of him and I love him all the more for it, but god it makes me miss him. Am I really this pathetically attached? Seemingly so. Not pathetic. That’s negative. I’m just in love. But I miss him terribly. I feel like I *need* to hear his voice, but I can’t. I wish so so so much that he’s sleeping well right now. I wish it x infinity. Baby. It’s funny how he’s never Andy in my head, he’s honey, honeybunny and baby. He doesn’t need to know that though. I call him honeybunny and handsome honey in a cheeky way, little does he know he is indeed Sir Honeybunny the First & Only. I mean I made that up right now, but he’s basically a king. Not to yknow, put him up on a pedestal or anything. He has a lot of faults and flaws. There we go. None of which are deal breakers by any means or even anything at all bad if I’m honest, it’s suspicious how wonderful he is. It makes me think when we’re together his flaw will come out and he’ll be a major slob around the house, except I know he isn’t like that so it won’t be that. It won’t be that he smells terrible because he doesn’t. Maybe he breathes loudly, like an earth side Darth Vader. But I never hear him breathe much on the phone. So unlikely that. Ummm. Hm. Idk. Maybe he is just honest to god the love of my life and there’s truly nothing that really grates me about him? He annoys me at times sure, in like that partner annoyance way but also not really at all. I guess he has a short fuse, that’s probably his fault. Yeah that would be it I think, it’s not anything bad as he manages it well, but it’s short and I feel semi conditioned to be kind of afraid and internally panicky about it. Like if I can’t hear him very well? My insides are churning with dread at how the conversation will go and whether I should say anything or not. But also he handles it as well as you can, so I can’t fault him for that. Maybe I just have enough faults and flaws for us both? Lord knows I do. I guess that’s what I bring to the table when it comes to us - faults, flaws and a wide array of tinted lip balms. I’m such a catch. Anyway long story short, I love him and I miss him.

I have just spent twenty odd minutes trying to remember a song that I don’t remember any lyrics to, other than it references your man being your king, as it popped into my head when writing the above and then I HAD to know what it is but I can’t find it. All I can think of is girl ya gotta love your man LIKE THANK YOU JIM BUT THAT ISNT WHAT IM TRYING TO THINK OF. I got that in a crossword clue last weekend, it was just  the “dog without a bone, an actor out on loan” and despite being god awful with lyrics I have listened to this song an infinite number of times since however long ago so I knew it like *that* - it’s not hard, it’s a willllldddddlllllyyyyyyyy popular song but dad was impressed so it made me feel nice. Anyway WHATS THE SONG FFFFFFSSSSSSS.

1i8rb34,https://www.reddit.com/r/Ghoststories/comments/1i8rb34/a_series_of_ghost_stories_from_my_old_job/,A series of Ghost stories from my old job.,"Hello everybody, I was told a number of stories from people in my last job and never really found anywhere to tell them, until I found this sub. I'm a teacher in Ireland and my old school has so many ghost stories, each of them centring around a particular room. I hope you enjoy. (Not using real names). 

Most of the stories come from the caretaker Alan, as he is most often in the school late. These stories are in no particular order and told by him.

In the past in my old school, students used to participate in a school sleepover to raise money for homeless charities. However one year there was an incident and the event was never repeated again. The students who were sleeping in Room 10 ran out of the room screaming during the night and had their parents collect them early. Nobody knows what happened but after this the event was never repeated. 

The next story comes from an SNA (Special Needs Assistant) called Sarah. Sarah was helping clean up the school at the end of the day. She was in room 10 sweeping up when she swears she saw the face of a nun in the reflection in the mirror. She told a few people but convinced herself it was her mind playing tricks. A few weeks later the students opened a time capsule that was buried and contained pictures of the school when it was opened, one of those pictures was the nun Sarah claimed to see and she fainted upon seeing the picture. This story was told to me by Alan and I asked Sarah about it and she backed it up. 

The next story comes from Alan himself. Alan was in the building late at night because the burglar alarm went off. He walked around the building and noticed one of the emergency exits was open. After closing it he went around the building to check everything was in order, as the clock struck 12 the door to the lift opened up. Alan ran from the building without resetting the alarm.

There is yet another story from Alan. Room 10 was an upstairs room, and Alan was downstairs alone cleaning up. He heard chairs being moved in room 10 as if a class had just ended. He went upstairs to see who was there but all the chairs in room 10 were up on the table where they are supposed to be.

Eventually, management decided that the staff room should be expanded, and they did this by knocking down the wall between the staff room and room 10. Room 10 was no longer a classroom but strange things continued to happen in the corner of the staff room that was formally room 10. 

The next story is from a teacher called Cara and an SNA called Rose. Cara always came i to work very early and was usually the first person in the building. As she was walking in she could see a light in the staff room and a figure by the printers (the printers are located where room 10 used to be). She was confused as there was no other cars but nonetheless went inside anyway. Cara got into the staff room and the lights in the staff room was off. She didn't bother whoever was by the printer and sat down, but could still hear paper rustling. Eventually the SNA Rose came in, and Cara asked her who was by the printers. Rose said there was nobody there. 

The next story comes from another teacher called Emma. Emma came into work early one day, and just like Cara she entered the staff room and turned the lights on. Emma saw a figure down beside the printers (room 10) doing work. Said hello and that was all. She turned to make a cup of tea and when she turned around again the figure was gone. 

Those are all the stories I was told. Alan told me all of them one day and it was backed up by everybody else. I never made any observations myself but there was one moment where I had a *feeling* something was wrong. 

There was a school musical and I was working with it. I went for a little coffee break in the staff room around 9pm. The lights were off and I put them on but the printing area was pitch black. I stood and stared into the blackness, feeling like there was definitely something in there looking back, but nothing happened and I went back to work. 

Hope you enjoy my stories. ",3,1737709303.0,Ghoststories,0,1.0,False
1i8raoi,https://www.reddit.com/r/BeyondTheBumpUK/comments/1i8raoi/partner_resentment_1ypp/,Partner resentment 1yPP,"Hi all more of a vent post because i need to get this off my chest before i murder someone.

I apologise in advance for spelling I'm just rage typing and cba to go back and check grammar.

My baby just turned 1 and i love her to bits but i just cant deal with this anymore. I returned to work part time at the beginning of jan aand ive already had multiples  discussions and arguments about the housework and general baby caring and been told 'well cross that bridge when we get to it' and all that BS about how things will be split when I return to work,but NOTJING, LITERALLY NOTJING has changed.

I feel like i have 2 kids. I feel like a single mother.

I'm losing my mind and yhe will to live.

I am so sick and tired or my partners life having barely changed at all and I'm just expected to do everything.

I understand whilst I was on maternity leave I could 'do' more but not really because caring for a child takes up so much time and energy sometimes I couldn't bare to face the mountain of dishes or washing etc

I have waves of feeling like I've suddenly got ontop of everything and have everything under control and then suddenly I feel so depressed and angry and wish I could kill my partner and baby because I just get so overwhelmed and feel this intense rage at the tiniest thing.

There's so many things I could list but we'd be here forever.

But most recent one is, my daughters birthday - i wrapped all the presents myself alone upstairs whilst he sat and played video games downstairs, I decorated the house by myself, I made a cake, I made all the sandwiches and snacks by myself.
Then the morning of her birthday I day on the floor with her and opened her presents with her whilst he sat on the sofa on his phone with a cup of coffee.

I specifically asked him to make sure to take pictures of me and her since I have barely any  and he didn't take a single one. I have ZERO pictures of me and her on her FIRST birthday - i still want to cry about it now.

He cant do something as basic as turn off the lamp, open the blind, and make the b3d before he leaves the house.

I've told him so many times it'd be nice if he also got up in the morning to help me get her ready ESPECIALLY on days she has nursery or a baby class.

He has NEVER woken up first in the morning to deal with her, he won't wake up in the night with her either unless he hears ive got so frustrated and I'm shouting for fuck sake because she's woken up 15 times in the last hour.

He's full of false help 'ill start waking up earlier' 'ill start doing more around the house' etc

His everyday 'chores' that i expect him to do regardless, are wash up and dp the bottles, and check the bins aren't full and if they are - put them out. And he STILL can't even keep ontop of those. Most mornings the plates from dinner are still in the sink or the recycling has been overflowing for 3 days.

I get told 'well why didn't you empty it since you're home instead of waiting for me to do it' or of i say I'm tired of doing everything  I gey 'oh so I do nothing at all do it' and stupid stuff like that.

My favourite one is 'you're alwsys going to feel like you're doing everything when you're with her home most of the time'
Not 'sorry you feel that way, what can I do to help you feel less overwhelmed'

He sits downstairs and plays video games til late and usually then falls asleep downstairs
I don't feel connected to him anymore because it feelsnlike hes never here or bonding with me.
He works 5 or 6 days a week and is out 8am to 8pm those days, has a hobby Tuesday evenings and doesn't come home till 1am or 3am.
When he has a day off he sleeps in and I spend 2+hrs sometimes asking and telling him to get up and then get ao frustrated with it I'm practically shouting it and then he gets an attitude with me for having an attitude with him for not getting up

God there's so much more I want to put here but just thinking of typing it out is so overwhelming.

I can't del with this anymore but in the same breath I can't be a single mum  I can't drive, I can't afford all the bills and house etc by myself, I can't lose his family which is the ONLY support system I have.

I'm just at my wits end and don't know what to do

Edit to add he is 30 years old, i know he sounds 18.

1i8ra1r,https://www.reddit.com/r/WritingHelp_service/comments/1i8ra1r/how_to_survive_college_coursework_without_losing/,How to Survive College Coursework Without Losing Your Mind,"Hey everyone!

College coursework can feel overwhelming, especially when deadlines pile up, and everything seems equally important. But don't worry—I've got some tips to help you manage your workload and actually enjoy the process (yes, it’s possible!).

# 1. Break It Down

Big assignments feel less scary when you split them into smaller tasks. For example, instead of writing an essay all at once, try:

* Researching and gathering sources.
* Outlining your main points.
* Writing a rough draft.
* Polishing it up later. Taking it one step at a time makes a HUGE difference!

# 2. Create a Schedule

Use a planner or an app to track your deadlines. Block out specific times for working on coursework, and stick to it like it’s a meeting with your future self. Trust me, staying consistent will save you from last-minute stress.

# 3. Find Your Zone

Where do you work best? A quiet library, a cozy coffee shop, or even your dorm room? Experiment with spaces until you find the one that helps you focus. Bonus: Keep snacks and water nearby to stay fuelled!

# 4. Ask for Help

If you’re stuck, reach out! Professors, TAs, and classmates are there to help you. Don’t be afraid to ask questions or clarify things—it’s better than struggling in silence.

# 5. Use Tools Wisely

Apps like Notion, Trello, and Quizlet can be lifesavers for organizing notes, managing projects, and studying efficiently. And if you’re really pressed for time, academic writing services like SpeedyPaper or EssayMarket can help you with proofreading or brainstorming ideas for your papers.

# 6. Take Breaks

Don’t underestimate the power of a quick 10-minute break. Whether it’s a walk, a stretch, or a dance-off in your room, stepping away from your work can recharge your brain.

# 7. Celebrate Small Wins

Finished your first draft? Celebrate! Submitted a project on time? Treat yourself! Acknowledging your progress keeps you motivated for the long haul.

Remember, college is a marathon, not a sprint. Take it one step at a time, stay organized, and don’t hesitate to lean on resources when needed. You’ve got this!",3,1737709189.0,WritingHelp_service,6,1.0,False

1i8r9hu,https://www.reddit.com/r/findommemes/comments/1i8r9hu/if_you_are_a_finsub/,IF YOU ARE A FINSUB,"This is more of a throwaway post than anything. 

I once had a finsub who paid me £10 twice a day because they wanted to pay for my coffees. On the other hand I had a finsub who paid me £5k once and never spoke to me again. Not all finsubs are the same, but what I’ve come to appreciate is that the support they gave me was all dependent on their own financial circumstances.

I accept any tribute regardless, but I set an amount because it allows people to gauge their expectations if they want my services and actual attention from me. Obviously I love money and how good it makes me feel, but expecting every sub to be that one who paid £5k would be unrealistic, especially when there are millions of paypigs who would just want to give you £10 a day to ignore them or berate them for a minute. 

My point is (being a Findom), finsub is definitely a range, so if you’re a low baller piggy and feel intimidated by the high rollers, don’t. They are not you, and you are not them. Don’t compare yourself. If giving your money away to a hot Findom makes you happy, then that’s all that matters. 

Just keeping it respectful and approaching the right Findom properly is all that is needed to create a great relationship with them so that both your expectations are satisfied. Just don’t be one of those subs or paypigs that expect something for absolutely nothing, that is not okay at all.

That’s all. Okay I’m going to be on Twitter now for a bit, check me out if you want.

Processing: Natural Anaerobic
Taste notes: Pineapple, raspberry, sparkling aged portwine, tamarind
Producer: José Cuellar

Drinking this coffee now in the end of January, purchased at December 25 after the calendar ended. Maybe same roast date as calendar-participants. So probably 2 months old or more.

Followed my current go-to recipe (Lance Hedrick-style):
- Brewed in V60 with T-92 filters.
- 15g coffee grinder at 10 on a 078 (no fines).
- 92c water that cooled throughout the brew.
- 3,5x (55g) water for bloom and a 1 minute bloom
- High agitation single pour at 6-8ml/sek for the remaining 255g water (poured from high so the coffee almost splashes out of the V60)
- One swirl 10 seconds after the pour stopped to increase brew time a little.
- TBT about 2 minutes 15 seconds.

This is the first time I get the notes described from the cup, and it is my 3rd time brewing it. 

Juicy cup with a slight boozy taste. Clear yellow and orange fruits and acidic berries. Lingering pineapple taste and mouthfeel in the after taste. Slight bitterness resembling orange zests is present in both warm and cooled down coffee.

Ending it on my birthday..","my entire life I have made to feel outcasted from my own family, age 5 my mom marries someone who turns out to be a pedophile and does stuff to me and forces me to do stuff to him and my cousins while he watches. this goes on from age 5 to 8.

he also would beat me so badly to where I could barely sit because it would hurt. this went on from age 5 to 17.

When I was 8 my cousins dad came over no other adults were around. he made us kids do things to each other for hours then left. we never told anyone.

My mom never believed me nor did my grandma or any one else in the family. I was always called a liar, trash, stupid, and many other words. growing up I barely learned how to read and could barely spell. everyone made fun of me growing up. 

I never went to school, was always kept home to work in the yard or to handmow 10 acres of land or work in the field we had.
When I was 17, my step dad killed my 80 year old grandma who had severe asthma, he sprayed a full can of bug spray in the kitchen causing her to have a severe asthma attack and died that night. he did it on purpose for the will.

when I was 18 I walked in on my step dad and my moms uncle together in her bed. I told her that night infront of everyone, he threw hot coffee in my face and then my mom kicked me out of the house.

My mom was always trying to end her life, I grew up spending weeks in and out of the hospital by her bedside from overdoses. 

Was homeless from age 18 to 35. no one would hire me.
Lost my mom when I was 25, my biological dad when I was 23, only knew him for a few months. 

Didn't learn to read or write until I was 18/19 and homeless. That is also when I learned I had dyslexia and minor brain damage from years of beatings from my step dad.

Fast forward to today after 30 years of abuse from my family. my aunts, my cousins and being outcasted by them for over 10 years. I am turning 44 monday and I can't keep living like this.

I was diagnosed with Cptsd, severe chronic depression, paranoia, severe social anxiety and suicidal ideation. I have no friends and go months with no one to talk to, i have no one to game with and I have no support from anyone. I owe 3 years of payments on 3 different credit cards and I am -180 in the bank and living on ssi. I can't keep going like this...

I have never had a girlfriend, women don't want me, I have never had a vehicle and I desperately need a minivan to help me get around to places. I had a crown break off and can't get to a dentist because of no dental insurance. I was never taught dental hygiene growing up and now I need all of my teeth pulled and dentures but cannot afford it.

I live in a very small town in texas that is 30 miles away from anything and have to doordash everything which costs so much. 

I can't keep living like this and being completely alone all of the time. So I am ending it on my birthday on the 27th.",6,1737708722.0,SuicideWatch,0,1.0,False
1i8r6fd,https://www.reddit.com/r/birthcontrol/comments/1i8r6fd/post_birth_control/,Post birth control,"Hi! I’m 22F. I was on birth control (Yaz) on and off since 2018 and I’ve been off of it for about 7 months now and I still feel like crap. Some days are definitely better than others. 
I’m just having bad insomnia before my period right now because of my OCD/anxiety that flares up before my period. The lack of sleep is making everything worse. So I guess I’m just in need of some comforting haha. Some people say it takes a whole year or more to see improvement and I hope that’s the case for me because I do not want to get back on the pill. 

It’s been a long journey mentally and physically. 
 
 I have health anxiety and since I started going on and off of birth control I was having calf pain in the same leg that I have bulging veins and that really scared me so I decided to get off birth control for good. Doctor said it’s just venous insufficiency (I don’t know if it came from birth control or genetics). I also wasn’t getting my period like I was supposed to during the sugar pill days so I didn’t like that. My leg/varicose vein pain was becoming more consistent after being off birth control and it felt like it was getting worse especially around ovulation/my period each month, weird huh? BUT literally like 2-3 weeks ago I no longer have the pain in my leg!! So that’s nice. 

Around the time I started going on and off birth control I developed GERD (don’t know if it’s birth control related for sure I’m just making a guess based on the time frame). To this day I have like really bad post nasal drip and it feels like I need to cough up something stuck in my throat often, especially when I wake up. THIS SUCKS THE MOST!!!

I have heart palpitations and weird feelings in my chest at times. I’m super anxious and more prone to that feeling of an adrenaline rush. I can simply think about being anxious and it makes me anxious if that makes sense.   I’ve always been an anxious person but this sensation became more prominent for me once I got of birth control. My tolerance for caffeine changed and it’s hard for me to drink coffee because I get really anxious lol makes sense. Caffeine also triggers my post nasal drip like crazy. I love coffee so this sucks. 

I don’t get the best sleep. I don’t have the best sleep schedule though so can’t entirely blame birth control. Yesterday I slept like 4 hours because I was anxious. Today I got off work at like 11pm now it’s 3 am because I’m feeling anxious BUT it’s 2 days before my period is supposed to start so this makes sense. 

Oh and my acne is bad. For some reason it’s mostly on one side of my face. I change my pillow cases and I don’t put my phone to my face. I had acne in high school so this makes sense. I think it’s getting better though I just need to be better with my diet.

1i8r05a,https://www.reddit.com/r/PointlessStories/comments/1i8r05a/bat_shit_crazy_barista/,Bat shit crazy barista.,"About 25 years ago I took my mom to a coffee shop in Tempe Arizona.  It was crowded with a line about 5 customers deep.  As I stepped up to order a new barista took over the register, she was all business and clearly not a trainee.  I will never forget the exchange that followed:
Me: “we would like two medium mochas and a slice of banana bread please.”  
Her:  pecking at the register “okay, one large coffee”. 
Me: “no, two medium mochas and slice of banana bread”. 
Her: pecking at the register some more “okay, one latte and a blueberry muffin”. 
Me: staring incredulously, “No, two medium mochas and a slice of banana bread”
Her: “We are out of banana bread.”
Me: staring at the loaf of banana bread in the display “you have banana bread right there”
Her: loud and slow like I’m an idiot “that’s not banana bread”
Me: “It’s literally labeled banana bread, if it’s not banana bread what is it?”
Her: in a really annoyed voice to another barista (while staring right at me) “Becky, will you take that sign out of the display case?, people keep thinking that’s banana bread”
Me: “Fine whatever it is, I would like a slice”
Her: “ITS NOT BANANA BREAD”
Me:  “WHAT THE FUCK IS YOUR PROBLEM?”
Her: glaring at me while she bags a slice and rings it up. 
Me:  glaring right back while I pay and snatch the bag from the counter.  

She ultimately won because there was no was I was getting the two mochas without a risking jail time for assault so I left without them.

For at least a decade I thought about that bat shit crazy barista every day.  For the past few years I only think about her a few times a week.  I can’t remember if the slice tasted like banana bread.",8,1737707880.0,PointlessStories,1,0.91,False

It seems like the previous owner didn’t care much about the house, as I’m constantly fixing or replacing something. Oh well—the joys of being a homeowner, I guess.

I was on a tight budget to hire a professional, so I decided to tackle it myself—learning experience and all.
I started by removing the cement sheet, cutting out the rotted OSB, and now I’m trying to figure out how to add some blocking before placing a new sheet of OSB/plywood on top.

Here’s where I’m stuck: there are about 4 inches of old OSB left that I was planning to cut out, but I only have access to 2 inches because the rest is under the drywall.
Should I cut the drywall to access the remaining OSB, or leave it as is and install the blocking?

Speaking of blocking, based on these photos, how should I place it?

I’ve moved on thankfully, it’s been like almost 2 years since I ended things with her, but I got roped back into seeing her social media & stuff after she sent me a bunch of messages. They were fairly emotionally charged and talking about nostalgia of me, and I replied kindly but very neutral and distant. She then sent me a couple more messages trying to be casual and start a conversation like nothing happened, which I did not reply to. 

I checked in then and saw that during the first message, she was still with him, then seemingly got broken up with like a week later. Posted a ton of “my heart is shattered” etc. shit, victimizing herself. She messages me 2 hours after she posts this stuff. Ignored. Then I check in like a week later and see they clearly got back together. Out of more curiosity I looked at his social media (I know I might get shit for this but curiosity killed the cat I can’t lie) and it’s just full of stuff like “I’m so sorry for what I’ve done” and just tons of self-hatred and blame. Guaranteed he was being valid in whatever he felt- last thing I heard about them was from a mutual (now-ex thankfully) friend telling me she cheated on him right in front of him his face at a party. 

God, I remember feeling just the same fucking way as him. I still did for like a year after— blamed it all on myself, thought I was the problem. Took it all in despite the mountain of evidence of how terrible she was being. Got cheated on but was convinced I was being jealous and paranoid and controlling. I thank god I found a good therapist in that time- when I felt like I needed to be fixed because I was a horrible abuser- who was able to see through exactly what was going on and help me safely get out and validate my very real concerns. 

I just wish I could give this guy a hug and tell him it’s not his fault, but it’s very far and gone not my place and i want to stray as far away from her drama as possible. I hope someday he’ll get out the fog and save himself, and maybe he’ll reach out to me and I can buy him a cup of coffee or something.

We started off hating each other but in the same friend groups but as we got older we had a ton more in common and as everyone else fell away her and I stuck together. We went to different high schools but would still get together every couple of months for an entire weekend hang out. 
She had a really abusive mother and had a lot of mental health issues growing up. Her mother was legitimately one of the most insane people I’ve ever met so I took this girl under my wing the best I could. 
Life continued on and she had her highs and lows just like I did until around 2021 I got a call she was in the hospital and desperately needed a place to stay. Her mother had kicked her out and I was her only hope. So I spoke with my partner and we set it up for her to come stay with me. 
When she first moved in she needed a huge amount of help. Like I was bringing pee from her catheter to the toilet. Watching her when she was having fits. It was a very intense experience all the while I was also going through my own family crisis.
After living with me for nearly a year and making really poor decisions and relying on me for nearly everything I realized I couldn’t do it anymore.

She finally got into serious contact with her other family and they figured out a temporary solution for her. While all this was happening I found out I was pregnant! I was so excited she was one of the first people I told.
Then she ghosted me. I would text just to say hi. I would send her silly TikTok’s. I would try and talk to her about being pregnant but I would maybe get a one word reply. I would contact her family and they would say she is doing great! She got a boyfriend, an apartment even! 

I go through my entire pregnancy not seeing her once. I have the baby and I send her a picture”cute!” Don’t hear from her again nor does she ask about how I am or how the baby was.
Eventually (10 years to late) I realize I can’t be friends with her anymore. She has never put any effort into my half of the relationship. So I stopped trying.
Welp new years almost 2 years later I get a text “hey! How are you? Let’s get coffee sometime?”

I felt sick getting that text and it took me a long time to come to terms that I need to just stay away. I have this gut feeling she needs something from me, but I feel like I have nothing left to give. 
Sorry for the long post I just really needed a good vent about this.
