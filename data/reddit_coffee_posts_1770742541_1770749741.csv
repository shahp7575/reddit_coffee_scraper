Most of us know have now gotten the gomining card and the free 1TH card that came with it but is it really that good to use? I personally though tit was going to be a credit card and I can use that to purchase on credit then use my balance to pay it off, didnt think it would act basically like a debit card.

At my current VIP Level of Sliver 3 I only get 1% Cashback on purchases which doesn't sound too good when you compare it to other cards like the Gemini/Coinbase cards offering more. Now we all want more TH and this card does give u more TH on every cashback but Ive heard problems with the converison rate.

I saw someone spend $3.40 in USD for coffee but then he lost $3.43 in GMT so it seems like the more we use it the more we lose in slippage or converison fees. 

Personally It doesnt sound crazy good to me but what do you guys think? ",2,1770749442.0,gomining,1,1.0,False

1r19c9o,https://www.reddit.com/r/Marathon_Training/comments/1r19c9o/help_with_under_fueling_and_cost_effective_carbs/,Help With Under Fueling and Cost Effective Carbs,"I'm in week 8/18 of my fifth marathon training block, using Hansons to go from 3:20 to \~3:05. I'm M30, 6'6"", 160lb (pretty thin), and do minimal strength training (mostly achilles, hip, and knee PT type exercises). I'm plant-based and eat a ton of tempeh, beans, and tofu, but I've always been fairly thin with a fast metabolism.

Lately, I've been finishing my hardest runs (speed and strength runs, not long runs) somewhat shaky and cold, often with some mental fog, and I'm feeling pretty worried about overdoing it effort-wise and underfueling. I think my primary issue is fuel and blood sugar. 

Part of my issue is that I'm on a budget and playing around with Gu/store-bought gel alternatives. First I played around with [this Maurten copycat](https://www.reddit.com/r/AdvancedRunning/comments/1gfug7o/so_you_wanna_make_a_gel_an_update/) you might remember, which worked great but my passion for it has faded (too technical, I love maurten but not that much I guess). Now I'm trying [this simple 1:1 Maltodextrin & Fructose gel](https://www.tracerfitness.com/blog/make-your-own-energy-gels), but am not convinced it's for me. Today, I didn't have anything prepared so I just did maple syrup because I had some in the fridge.

The biggest challenge with these is dosing—I use a reusable flask, and though I've often held a full serving in my mouth to memorize how 1.2 oz (or whatever the given serving size is) feels in my mouth, I'm not sure I'm getting it quite right.

I run in the morning, I only fuel with a gel beforehand (no solid food), sometimes have a coffee or tea before as well, and unless my run is over 10 miles I don't bring any fluids with me. For weekend long runs I might have some solid food like toast/peanut butter and a banana beforehand. After my runs I have an LMNT in 32 oz of water over the course of an hour, plus some sugars (whatever is on hand, today I had a rice krispie treat left over from the superbowl). Within an hour I have a meal.  I also supplement with 5g of creatine a day, beet juice, and chelated magnesium. 

So—to prevent this from just being a thinking-out-loud moment, here are my main issues:

* How do you dose bulk homemade gel accurately when using a reusable flask? 
* What are your favorite simple homemade gels? 
* Do you see any glaring issues in what I'm describing?

I’ve been in Vine since December ’22. Hit Gold after my first eval and stayed there ever since. In all that time I’ve maybe landed three items over $100. The biggest was a ride-on car for my kid that said $300 ETV but felt more like $150 in spirit.

Meanwhile I open this sub and it’s just screenshot after screenshot of Dyson vacuums, TVs, mystery $800 gadgets, and other “blink and it’s gone” items. It feels like some of you are playing a completely different version of Vine than I am.

So seriously… how?

Are you running scripts? Refreshing like day traders watching crypto? Working jobs that allow Vine monitoring as a primary responsibility? I always read that you have to be lightning fast to grab the big stuff, and I can’t even catch a decent coffee mug half the time.

For context, I mostly check Vine at night when I have downtime. I order maybe 2 to 3 items a week now. My yearly taxable total has never broken 3k. I still hit my 160 items to keep Gold, but I’m starting to wonder if Gold is just a shiny badge that says “congratulations, here are more phone cases and auto parts for cars you don't own.”

I’m not mad people get big items. Honestly, I think it’s awesome. I just feel like I’ve been in this long enough that I should at least understand the game mechanics, and clearly I’m missing a tutorial level somewhere.

Me 31F and husband 31M have been friends for 17 years total dated for 2 years married for 6 years. Which let's call him Phil. Alittle back story. Phil and I have always had a very open communication we would joke about whether our waitress was cute or not. We weren't people of judgements and a we always tried to help anyone that needed it if we could. We have let people stay with us whether it was for a night or needed a room to rent we never locked our doors just incase someone needed the door (which I know that can be dangerous). I have only lied to my husband once in our lives and I will get to that in a min. Fast forward our son was born and we have just moved into our house which had technically 4 bedrooms. We were also taking care of his parents in our home. So we always had an extra room in our house and it was used as a guestroom. When we brought our son home it was amazing and terrifying I had very bad postpartum depression. I was already battle major depression disorder and cptsd. So it wasn't easy in the house to say the least but my husband was a super hero and stepped up in all the right ways.

 A year had passed When I brought up opening our marriage again we closed our marriage because we wanted to try to have a child. He was alittle hesitant due to my depression but I reassured him I could handle it. He agreed and we sat down an made clear rules/standards. At this time we are both 28. 1. We wouldn't do anymore one night stands. 2. All party would consist to spending time together double dates once in a while. 3. If either partner had kids we would either be just a friend or aunt/uncle and nothing would be in front of them. A few months went by and we just show each other people we're just talking to that was about it. Until I started going back to work I met a guy M29. will call him Bob. Bob and I worked at the same place but different departments we would take breaks together and a friendship grew into him having game night at our house with other friends Phil liked him trusted him we introduced him to our son and he became uncle Bob. Bob and I would go on dates about twice a month besides that it was just having him over playing games,drinking, and sometimes smoking. Phil met a girl F27 about 2 months later. They met volunteering at the same events. She was shy and seemed very sweet. Let's call her Nikki. 

She actually just moved to our neighborhood which I thought was great. They went to a few more events together before meeting me which was fine. Now I have rbf extremely bad and our first encounter was one day I had to go to one of the events to grab some stuff out of Phil car. I didn't talk long due to running late to work. I barely even kissed Phil goodbye but I did make eye contact with Nikki and half smiled and left. Later the night Phil asked he could invite Nikki for game night which I agreed I asked if he wanted her as his gf teasing him. He said no he just her friend and Gave me small back story about her moving her to get away from he abuser and it was her, her mom, and her autistic son that was a year older than ours. I was going to school to work with special needs children. Phil said I might be able to help with her son he was nonverbal i said only if she wants the help I wouldn't want to over step or make her feel like she isn't good enough. 

She came over for game and so did bob. We had a great time Nikki looked so happy like she finally found her people and village. I made a comment on how she was looking at Phil and that they would make a cute couple. Nikki looked at me scared to death like had threated her or something I looked confused and all she could say was I wouldn't take a married man. I flushed and looked at Phil and asked if he told her. He explain he didnt think it mattered due to them being just friends. I glanced back at her and smiled and said I'm so sorry to have frightened you but we are open in our marriage and Phil is my husband and bob was my bf and that phil was looking for a gf and that I thought she knew all this. She did not and asked if she could go home. 

So we ended game night and once everyone was gone Phil started getting upset with me about scaring his friend away (which he rarely gets upset with me) and I was dumbfounded. I told him I don't like lying to people it gets you no where. But I apologized and told him I'll message her in the morning to try to clear the air alittle. Than I teased him again and said you know she likes you right. She was smiling at you the whole time. He flushed and said nah she wouldn't like me like that. Mind you this man is oblivious to the max. When were dated he didn't know i liked him until I kissed him even than he couldn't believe it. Which is one of many reason I fell for him he is truly a simple man. But I teased him and said if I didnt scare her away he should take his shot. 

The next day i asked if Nikki would meet for coffee after she takes her son to school and she agreed. We talk weather for a while and I finally asked her if I upset her. She just said I thought you hated me. I laughed and told her its really hard for me to hate people I hate 2 people in my life and that was my own abuser and my mother she is the reason I have cptsd. Nikki was relief that I was fine with her. I explained to her that we are a village who love deeply and want to see the best in everyone. I told her even if she just wanted to be friends we would not treat her any different. She agreed to try game night again. That game night was amazing. Phil and Nikki started to hangout more and more than one day Phil said he would like to take Nikki on a real date. I was excited for him she was a great person I told him I don't mind watching the boys while they go out. After that Nikki agreed to being phil gf. 

Now months go by and everything fine. Me bob and a few coworkers plan on a party weekend and go club hopping phil wasn't much of a partier and neither was Nikki. But phil was fine with me going we booked hotel rooms and set out for a fun weekend. Bob asked me if I wanted to do ecstasy while out partying. At that time i had been 5 years sober beside drinking and a joint here and there. But I stopped everything hard before dating phil. I told bob I will talk to phil about it and would report back. That night I talked to phil about bobs offer and phil exploded screaming at me and saying he didnt like bob all of a sudden and just freaking out telling me I was just finding a way to relapse. I was hurt and angry with his words to believe I had no self control that a one time event would destroy everything I had built up (which could have been truthful) I was truly hurt by the fact a man i had been with for over 6 or so months that I let him babysit my son while I had appointments and trusted enough to calmly talk to phil about this one time thing just to relax and have a mental break. I would have been fine if he was calm and we discussed things like adults but he blow up. I just told him nevermind I wouldn't do it and I was sorry for asking. 

When the weekend came we had a blast the last day I was telling bob about phil explosions and he convinced me to doing ecstasy.  I was safe and had a good time besides a major headache I was fine. Went home and continue with our regular schedule program. About two weeks went by and I couldn't keep it hidden from phil any longer and I told him the truth and told him the only reason I lied was to prove a point that I could have fun once n awhile. He apologized for blowing up that day but said he was disappointed in my actions that I could have gotten hurt. We moved on and things continued. Nikki was going to school for nursing now and I had finished my schooling. We had our double days and we're planning a Christmas trip with everyone including the kids. 

I helped phil find Nikki's Christmas present i found someone who made custom made hello kitty things in a mystery box and found someone who could make a necklace with her name designed as a stethoscope. I found bob a complete new mechanic tool set he was going to school to become one. I got phil a new ps4 for Christmas. We all spent about $200 on the kids.

 Before Thanksgiving weekend bob and I planned a hotel date. I told phil and Nikki they should try to do something too which they agreed. As bob and I were getting ready to leave our hotel to go to dinner, phil called to ask it they could pop in to say hi which we agreed they came to our room we handed them a drink and they sat down I was finishing my makeup. I walked out of the bathroom and I was frustrated at how phil was looking at Nikki i dont know why I felt this way but something struck me as weird. I kept it to myself and enjoyed our night out. 

As the next week came around phil was more and more distant. He stopped giving goodnight kisses and sex stopped completely. After Thanksgiving I tried to bring up phil being distant he said it was due to the stress of work. We still our date night our Christmas trip was the 28th of dec. We had Christmas day everyone opened there gifts everyone one was so happy. When it was my turn I opened my gifts bob got me a new set of magnet blocks which is something I used while working with my clients, Nikki got me a new laptop bag, phil got me a box of my favorite candy. I was happy with all my gifts I just was alittle heart broken that phil didnt put any thought into my gift. 

The next day I told phil after our trip I think we should take a break with our openness that we need to work on our marriage. He tried to agrue with me over it but ultimately agreed. The trip came and it was ok phil barely talked to me. When we all got home I talked to bob and he understood and agreed to stay friends and if we opened our marriage again and he was single he would love to continue.

 It took phil a few days to do it. When he finally talked to nikki she started crying and explained she was just about to tell him she had a miscarriage with his child and that this just made everything worse. She agreed to stay friend for the kids. About 3 months went by and phil and I were still trying to figure out us. Nikki was struggling financially and her mom apparently told her she needed to figure things out. I had offered her our guest room cuz she still was my friend and that is just the type of person I am. 

So everything seemed fine I had weird feelings here and there when I was around phil and Nikki. Phil had been become distant again I confronted Nikki about it and she reassured me nothing was going on she had more respect for me than that. Few weeks went by phils parents decided it was there time to live on there own again. My mil started talking to Nikki more and less of me i brought this to phils attention he said I was overreacting. 

We helped my in-laws to their new home. We had a mutual friend rent out our other room so rent wouldnt be insane. Nikki agreed to pay more rent. She started seeing another guy and they seemed to hit it off he was going thru a divorce. Few months later Nikki confronted me and phil saying she couldn't afford to live with us anymore that a 3rd of the rent was too much for her and her bf wasn't comfortable living with us with phil still crushing on Nikki. Phil got upset and stormed off saying he isnt crushing on her. I was also angry with her we renewed our least so she had a home and she also knew we couldn't afford the spike in rent. But she didnt care she acted like we were scum compared to her. She also did this infront of the kids which pissed me off. 

The next day she had came to get her things she brought he bf and people that volunteered at the same events as phil and that was low to bring outside people involved into our lives. Months later We found out she told those people that phil had abused her and she was scared to live with us and when she came to me about it I kicked her out. About 3 months goes by and we got evicted from our home due to not able to pay on time. We moved into our new home and was trying to start over. 

Enter my best friend we have been friends since 2008. Let's call her Betty F31. Betty was in a very bad situation with her now ex-husband. She called me one day begging me to save her from her home which I did with a coworker we drove a truck 8 hours I packed house and her vehicle and the truck with as much as we could and I drove straight home. I didnt sleep for 25hours. 

Weeks  later She was having a hard time with the transition and came to me asking if she could lay in the same bed with me or phil just to have the feeling of another body next to her. I suggested phil cuz he was the better cuddler. I trusted both of them. I even told betty if she wanted to sleep with phil I wouldnt judge or care. Betty said she wasn't sure if she was comfortable with that she just missed sleeping next to another person.

The next day betty sat me down and was crying explaining that phil has kissed her and she was ok with it but he asked if she wanted to do the deed. she said she wasn't comfortable due to me and her friendship. Phil told her that I WOULDN'T HAVE TO KNOW. she said no again and they went to sleep. She was trying not to have a panic attack explaining she didnt want to move back home and do this to me. I never blamed her i thanked her for the truth and I knew that it was hard to come to me about it.

 I confronted phil about it when he came home from work. He broke down stating that he indeed had said those things. And to please forgive him. I couldn't believe the man I married and thought the world of would try to sleep with my best friend. I thought about it for a few days and went to phil and asked if he was sleeping with Nikki while we closed our married. He flushed and started to break down onto the floor stating that he was so sorry he did that to me and I asked why did he cheat on me like that I was taking care of everything to the bills working cleaning and maintaining our home helping nikki's son with his talking skills taking care of our own son and never once asked for anything inreturn and I was faithful and honest our whole marriage. 

He got mad and yelled that I indeed lied to him about taking a drug one time. I just was stunned he brought up that I asked is that the reason he kept sleeping with Nikki the fact I lied once in our relationship and still came clean about it. He said that was the reason the first time....FUCKING FIRST TIME?! I asked him how many times did it happen he said a handful of times while I was at work or hanging out with coworkers. I felt my whole world collapsing I just looked at him and asked what do I do with this information. He begged me not to leave that he regrets ever do it in the first place. I laughed and asked which time did you regret. 

My best friend was so amazing the next few months by helping with the house and kids while I dropped into a depression she kept talking to phil about getting help for himself that there can be saving our marriage if he really puts the work in and does better everyday. She got him to admit while Nikki was living with us she was trying to convince him to leave me for her. Phil told Nikki he wouldn't break my heart like that. Betty asked what was he thinking that we were the power Couple everyone wanted to be. 

Phil just kept saying idk and would just break down crying saying she was evil and that she made him believe i wasn't greatful of him. Few more weeks went by and my depression got worse one day I just snapped climbed out my son's windows and took a vehicle contemplating on ending everything. Betty called the police and they found me asleep in my vehicle (that was the only thing I could think to do) they told me to go home so I did. 

Betty sat me down and helped me snap make into reality and making me see my son needs me after that I went to thearpy and started tms therapy. That was about 6 months ago and I  have completed my tms therapy and I still continue my normal thearpy phil has gone to thearpy and we are still everyday trying to move past this. But in the 6 months that have past I have discovered that Nikki was telling my mil that I was a terrible mother to our son and mean to phil that phil wanted to leave me for her. My mil told me later she didnt say anything to me because she knew that was a lie that I was a wonderful mother and a strong wife but she also didnt want to get involved in my marriage which i respected. 

I have also found out with receipts that Nikki faked the miscarriage because she didnt want to lose phil. She also was trying to trap him with her getting pregnant by telling him they dont need to use condoms and he always told her no that my health and safety comes first. She has ALSO told some of the people that volunteered with phil and that he had ""forced"" her to sleep with him. Lucky one of the other volunteers wife overheard her statement and told her if what she is tell people is the truth she needed to go to the police and seek help which inturn she stumbled over her words and changed her story very quickly.

 Nikki and her bf have moved states and her bf is still married to his wife. She just wanted to take someone's husband because they are good men and she was a true snake. I believe now some of the thing phil has told me in regards to her playing mind games with him. Phil and I are still not ok I have noticed that I was the reason she fell for him I planned most of their dates I found the gifts I did almost everything she was basically dating me thru him. When I realized this and noticed he never really planned out our dates or did thoughtful gifts. I told myself it was the way I looked after our son was born that was the reason he wasn't into me. But I actually started working out looking in my opinion better than when we started dating my confidence. has improved and I love myself again but none of that seem to change his behavior towards me.

 Fast forward to last month I bought a new dress and my husband actually gave me compliment and I laughed and sarcastically said ""oh now you notice me."" He was offended saying he was trying to show me he loved me more everyday and in turn I asked how please show me what have you tried to do. And he just stumbled saying he would try to hold my hand more and be in the same room more often. I laughed again and asked if he thought that was enough. I stated that he hasnt even tried to watch a tv show with me or talk to me about my day he just sits in the same room on his phone barely willing to talk.

 I have a high sex drive also and anytime I have tried to do anything he either doesnt seem interested or just says he is tired. I still do everything i can to make his life easy laundry making his lunches and dinners maintaining the house i have became a stay at home mom since my mental snap so i do alot more than he does without complaining. Now he is still a great father and still a hardworking man. He has been transparent with me everyday since being called out showing me his phone if I ask he even downloaded life360 to show he isnt going to make the same mistakes again. I also want to note I still love this man with every ounce of my body he has given me our son, home, and safety that I thought I never could have. But his lack of attention or time towards me has made me realize that ive ignored the neglect he has given me over the years. I would like to note im not asking for over the top gifts or expensive trips I honestly am a person who only wants people time and attention. Movie nights long walks ect. So should I try to stick it out and forgive or should I throw in the towel?


**TL;DR; : my husband and I were in an open marriage with a friend decided to close the marriage. Stayed friends with his ex. She needed help financially we let her live with us. While under our roof my husband hadbeen sleeping with her again. I didn't find out until almost a year later when my best friend moved in and he tired to sleep with her and telling her it could be there secret. Bestt friend immediately told me what was said. I still very much love him he is a wonderful hard working man and been in my life for 17 years and has never hurt me once until now.

It’s my first ever job and I don’t have any prior experience. (Not sure if this counts as coffee shop industry related, but it’s similar. Let me know if I’m in the wrong sub.)

After getting off shift I just started crying because I felt so incompetent. Even though logically I know this is my first ever job and obviously mistakes are bound to be made.

For my first shift, I was taught 3 recipes of the toppings. Not the recipes for drinks, just the toppings. I was following the steps okay but then I started to get confused mid-way through the first recipe. I’m someone who learns very slowly and I require more time to process new information. But before I could understand how to make the first topping recipe we’re already moving on to the next one.

Second thing I was taught was how to wash a commercial tea container. I was shown how to do this only once in the first hour of my shift. I was tasked by the SM and show them how to wash it in the last hour (after my brain has been stuffed to the brim with a lot of information) I stared messing it up.

The SM who’s teaching me is not mean or rude, just strict and have certain expectations of me. Which is expected. And working at a boba tea shop is a fast-paced environment which I also expected.

Everything was just so overwhelming and I wasn’t able to keep up. Before I could even process how one thing works we’re already moving on to the next one. And I was expected to understand everything with just showing me once. When I was tasked to repeat some of the recipes I was just taught, I was already mixing the steps up. It doesn’t help that I also have slow movements.

I was told to memorise the recipes and was expected to be able to do all of them on my own in my next shift, which is in 3 days. (Which is probably the bare minimum and I feel incompetent that I’m struggling with this.)

I have this feeling, even before I started my first shift here, that I’m not suited to work in any kinds of kitchen. But I just don’t know if I’m judging too early or I’m just really not suited to work in one.

I’m also thinking of already quitting. But I’d feel bad to do so because it was my roommate who recommended me for this job and if I quit I feel like I’ve wasted it. But also if I feel that I’m not suited to work here I should tell the SM, no? So I wouldn’t make them waste even more time on training me just for me to mess everything up.

On top of that, there are also underlying mental health problems that are affecting how I work, though I’m not diagnosed with anything or know what it is, just some speculations. I just know something is wrong with me.

I’m just not sure what to do, I feel like a wimp for wanting to quit this early when I barely even started. If I’m already struggling with basics tasks, how am I supposed to keep up with more complicated ones?",1,1770749095.0,barista,2,0.67,False

I wash my mouth a lot. Everytime I eat, finish a drink or through out a zonic( low mg nicotine pouches) which I did ask my piercer about. I also wash it when I wake up, go to bed and a couple times throughout the day just to be safe. I brush my teeth like normal but I can never get all of the drink or toothpaste or mouthwash completely off of my tongue. I try my best to brush it and through out the day I’ve been using paper town to get the left over drink or saliva build up off my tongue. I haven’t drank any alcohol or ate any solid food.

Don't know if he likes me or hates me like me (f26) how do I handle this or let him know I like him?,"TL;DR: A guy from my college class shows a lot of interest in person (initiates hangouts, pays for tea, hugs, remembers details, opens up emotionally) but barely texts and sometimes goes days without responding. I’m confused whether he likes me but is avoidant/unsure, or if he just enjoys the connection without wanting a relationship.

I met a guy in his late 20s in one of my college classes. He asked for my number early on, and over a few weeks we started spending time together. Most of our hangouts were framed as studying, but often turned into long conversations.

Early on, he initiated multiple meetups, paid for tea or coffee, walked me to my car, hugged me a few times, invited me to play pickleball, and opened up about his mental health, medications, family, and career goals. He remembered details about me and my family and asked indirect but specific questions about relationships, like honesty, fidelity, and who leads in a relationship. He also invited me into everyday things like running errands together.

One night we spent almost two hours talking over tea. It felt very comfortable and date-like even though it was never labeled as a date. He later invited me to his house to continue studying because the WiFi was better. His parents were home and nothing inappropriate happened.

After that night, his behavior shifted. His texting became very sparse, and he stopped responding to a message where I thanked him for tea and asked a simple follow-up question. He went three days without responding, even though we still saw each other in class.

In class, he still acts warm. He sits near me, initiates conversation, remembers details from past conversations, jokes, and lightly teases. But outside of class, he does not follow up, call, or text the way he did before.

Some context: he is very structured, cautious, and conflict-avoidant. He is not verbally expressive and rarely gives compliments. He seems much more comfortable in person than over text. I showed interest early on but stopped chasing once the silence started.

What confuses me is that his in-person behavior shows interest and comfort, while his lack of follow-through outside of class feels like emotional withdrawal.

I did not get selected so there may be some gaps in my knowledge/this information reflects my experience in February 2026.

*  The jury managers were incredibly nice and did a great job communicating on what we needed to do when, what to expect, timelines (at least as far as they were aware), etc. after we arrived/each day we were there
* Parking was only reimbursable at one garage (Fulton Street Parking Garage). They would hand out parking validation once a day for that garage
   * Parking was busiest Monday and Tuesday so it paid to get there a bit early from what    we were told
   * Even if the lot said “full” there are spots reserved for jurors - these spots were only reserved until about 9AM (start time on Monday was 8 AM and 9 AM on Tuesday)
*  The jury room itself was this huge room with comfortable chairs, electric outlets distributed randomly on the floor, a kitchenette, nearby bathrooms, TVs and free coffee – I highly recommend bringing a book, laptop or some other distraction as there was *a lot* of waiting
* Lunch was roughly an hour and a half
* Dress code was somewhat relaxed. A good number of folks were in jeans/button ups and sneakers. More on the “casual” side of business casual
* Bailiffs (around 7 of them) communicated to the jury managers on the need for jurors and the jury managers would announce who was selected to be interviewed. This did not happen all at once due to last minute negotiations between the lawyers, etc. for the total of 4 cases scheduled for the week. The names selected were chosen at random according to the jury managers.
* We got let go early on the 1^(st) day (around 4-ish) and were released before lunch on the second day. This does not always happen according to the jury managers
* We received a letter at the end of our service to document the days we served.

  Elder emo that enjoys all types of music and will still mosh when the occasion calls for it. I’m used to having to drive hours one way for shows so I’m VERY excited for concerts around PGH, already have several lined up. (Taking Back Sunday tour announcement dropped as I was typing this, who's going?)  

  Big sports fan. Already got season tickets to the Riverhounds and going to a Pens game \[that I may have a spare ticket for\] after the Olympic break. Football/F1/NASCAR Sunday is my favorite day of the week.  

  Child free by choice but I don’t mind kiddos and mom friends! Personally I’m the ‘fur baby’ type.  

  I like the standard dinner-and-drinks but would prefer active hang outs like hiking/walking, bowling, book club, taking classes together, hosting game nights (once we’re settled in), things like that.

Just another normal day in the lab.

Some days you genuinely wonder why certain machines refuse to stay dead. Then it shows up again — the beast itself: the original Xbox. We all thought we’d seen the last of it. Turns out, not even close.

The lab crew are deep in its DNA now, poking around the heart of it — the config.xbe and config files. Progress so far? Two steps forward, five steps back. As one wise soul once said: when you first write code, you won’t believe how many mistakes you’ve made until it finally stops working. Change one thing, something else breaks. Fix that, another issue appears. Rinse, repeat.
The goal is simple in theory: make the dashboard more open, more flexible, and very much not stock. In reality, it’s slow, methodical work. Every failed attempt costs another cup of coffee… and usually another sandwich sacrificed to the toaster gods.

They’re getting there though. One broken line of code at a time. Some mistakes are obvious, some take hours to track down. There’s debate in the lab — which dashboard is “best” is always a matter of opinion — but what they’re doing with UnleashX is shaping up nicely.

When it’s dialled in properly, it’s going to be solid.
Funny thing is how much power sits in a simple config file. Change a few lines, rearrange a menu, point to a different path — and suddenly the whole system behaves differently.

I work in community mental health, in a big city, so have a lot of clients that are low income/fixed-income and with medicaid/ medicare. I definitely definitely understand how the low and fixed incomes limit the clients in their day to day life choices, and severely limit the options they have for doing enjoyable things. I totally understand that.  What's been happening lately is that a couple of my clients who come by telephone....will answer and sound irritable, like tired and grumpy (which is fine), and when I ask what they'd like to talk about, or how they are doing in general. They kind of like grumble...like ""egh, it's fine"" (which of course i know doesn't really mean fine), but also I try to meet them where they are, honor their pace and preferences, etc.  But there are some times where it seems like they feel like I'm calling them to 'poke' them, or bother them about something. Like I might ask about their week (without expectation, like, they literally know they could say-- my couisn came over for coffee, and i'm would validate that, 'oh very nice, ok) but lately when I ask, they'll say ""I didn't do anything.""---kind of like with a tone of ""if you're asking what i'm up to it's nothing.""  And I'm fine with that.  And I will validate that, i ask if they are feeling comfortable and calm, and they'll say yes. And I validate that....and then there is long silence on the phone. I wait without expectation, and then they will say ""Hello?"", and I calmly say ""yes yes I'm hear"", and they'll say ""oh oh ok ok."" and then more silence.....for like 3-4 minutes, and then i start to feel awkward because it feels like they are waiting for me to 'make a conversation happen' or something like that.  Or they will vent about their symptoms...and then I give empathy and hold space, and then...if it's gone on so long that we reach the end of session time, then they seem, like irritable that I am bringing the session to a close...even though I don't do it in a mean or critical way....    Is there anything I'm missing? ANything I'm not asking that I should?  I definitely ask about their symptoms, and give them time to reflect on whether they want to talk about anything.  But sometimes they are just at home puttering around the house ( I can hear in the background)...and we're just sitting on the phone.....  is that fine? Is it just me putting too much pressure on myself?

Since I have a few years of ""incubation time,"" I want to use them to actually learn the grit of the business so I don't get crushed by compliance or bad vendors later.

**I have a few questions for the veterans here:**

1. **Is it still worth it?** With global shipping costs fluctuating and shifting regulations, is the ""small-scale trader"" model still viable, or is it getting swallowed by big players?
2. **How do I ""prep my brain""?** What are the non-obvious things I should be observing? Logistics? Customs? Foreign exchange? If you were 25 again with 3 years to spare, what would you study?
3. **Financial Reality:** How much ""real"" investment should I aim to save up for a decent first shipment? I’ve heard numbers from ₹50k to ₹15L. What’s the sweet spot for a beginner?
4. **Mumbai Resources:** Since I'm in Mumbai, are there specific places (ports, markets, institutes) I should visit or short-term weekend courses that are actually legit and not just ""get rich quick"" scams?

Why are you building something that already exists?

Okay, let's talk numbers:

We serve SaaS founders and as you know, there are many of them BUT, let's take a rough number. 

Globally, there are probably 200,000 potential SaaS founders and roughly around 47M developers across the globe and so that means potential new SaaS founders. Take out 37M just for the sake of it. That's 17M developers across the world.

And I want to see ANY tool that has just 1 million of our target audience. Like, a tool like us that has even 100K users.

So the idea of saturating the market is completely absurd. 

You can't really saturate a market unless everyone in the market had seen all the claims around what you sell and made a decision of buy or no buy.

Even if it's saturated and for the sake of the conversation. You can't have one business that will stay the leader forever.

Microsoft dominated the market before google was google, 90% market shares UNTIL google came to disrupt the entire market and flipped the whole script.

There will NEVER be ONE pole for the market that stays forever.

1r18rag,https://www.reddit.com/r/shortstories/comments/1r18rag/mf_i_tried_to_buy_a_bike_rack_online_and_the/,[MF] I tried to buy a bike rack online and the person told me it wasn't available anymore so I sent them this,"Hear me out, you rescind the previously mentioned former offer and instead take a whopping $200.01 from me instead. Now I don't usually go that high but for multiple reasons that will become increasingly more clear as we go, I couldn't let such a sweet deal pass through my 11 fingers. See, I grew up on a small farm in rural South Dakota. We didn't have much money, but that was okay because of our two donkeys, Ralph and Tiberius. Those rascals gave me more meaning in this scary thing we call life than I could ever have hoped for. My father, the unofficial protagonist of this story, was a man with a moral compass as true as it was unwavering. I loved him with all my heart and my soul aches to say that he is no longer here. His ultimate and final downfall, of which will be revealed in chapter 6, has led me to where I am now. It has led me to you and I would be remiss to not give it the old college try as they say.



The town we lived in was small and the community was tight knit. Everyone knew everyone by first, last, and even middle name. It was the kind of place where the sharing of baking flour and favors for no return were a mainstay, nay, a necessity of the way of life. A smile could always be found on Walt down at the five and dime. Even on the day when his ex wife, Joann, left him and took the house, Walt greeted me with tonic in hand and lips turned upward. Old Ed, the owner of the Broken Spoke Bike Shop, had wisdom that was nearly as deep as his baritone voice. He was as quick with a joke as he was with a piece of sage wisdom that always seemed to come at just the right time. Like when he told Walt that Joann didn't deserve him and that when one person leaves a big hole in your heart, it just means that there's more space to love everyone else.



Most people who were born in Elkland, South Dakota tend to grow up and die there, my father and Ed included. It wasn't that everyone was overly prideful; there were no bad feelings if someone left. It was more that the people who lived there were happy and didn't see any reason to leave. I think you'd be hard pressed to find a town that runs like clockwork more than our residents'. At exactly 8:55 am each morning, you could hear Mr. Tellman's penny loafers on cold concrete and the turn of the key in the bank's front doors. Sunday masses never started late and everyone leaves at an appropriate time from the weekly ""GOODBYE, JOANN '' party held at Walt's. I could go on forever talking about the nuances of my people's routine but I would be selfish to not further the story. I'll skip ahead a few years to when what we share in common comes into play.



Within the minute, my father and Ed would walk into the Early Pine Diner at 7:15 every morning. They sat at the corner table with the ripped seats and, from left to right on the wall behind, each in a framed photo, Teddy Roosevelt, George Washington, and Paul Bunyan. Though most conversations were filled with recalling memories of old loves and youthful mischief, they shared one interest of the future. Hours were spent with the two constantly debating whether companies like Saris, Kuat, and even Thule would come out with new hitch mounted bike racks each year. Ed was more conservative in his ideas and believed that one new rack a year was reasonable. My father, on the other hand, being the dreamer that he always was, would always say that he wouldn't be happy with any less than 3 new racks a year! With this, they both always chuckled and finished their respective cups of joe. Hearing this laughter, Becky, the sassy but loving waitress, would make her way over to the table because she knew the boys needed either a refill or the check. The former waitress at the Early Pine, Joann, was awful at her job and would often wait until she knew the table was leaving for work to see if a refill was needed.



On a particularly normal seeming Saturday morning, my father made his way, as he usually did, into the Broken Spoke with a medium dark coffee in hand to greet Old Ed. As he passed through the entrance, my father saw something that he had both never seen before nor thought that he would ever see. Ed was on his hands and knees with tears rolling down his unshaven face. ""Jesus, Ed, what happened? Do you need an ambulance?"" ""Oh! Hey ya there Tom, I didn't see you come in,"" Ed choked out through labored breath. ""No, no. I'm fine.”""Well jeez, Ed, can you tell me what happened? Did Joann come back in?"" For the next minute there was silence accompanied only by the crackling radio behind the counter and Ed's weak breathing. Having gained enough strength back to speak again, Ed raised his fourth finger on his left hand toward the desktop computer at the counter. ""Take a look,"" was all he could get out before having to return his palm to the concrete floor. My father, looking back and forth between Ed and the dull glow from the opposite side of the computer, rubbed his beard before slowly making his way behind the counter. What he saw next is ultimately why I am here now telling you all this. On the screen was a used Thule Helium Platform Bike Carrier posted online for only $200.



It was nearing 3 in the afternoon the next time that someone came into the store. What they saw when they got there still haunts them to this day. My father and Ed were both completely naked and soaking wet. They were pushing each other away from the screen so that they could get closer while mumbling something that one person described as sounding like ""a pair of feral cats that learned to speak English only by watching late night ads on QVC."" Believe me when I say that we tried everything we could to break them from their debilitating obsession. The firemen, the police, and the national guard were all called. No amount of physical force or mental reinforcement could move them. Weeks and weeks went by and as the pile of waste below them grew, their bodies shrank and decomposed. A full 2 months after the ""initial viewing"" as the news stations have called it, my father would take his last breath. What he said to me before he did now resides as deeply in my memory as it does my unconscious.



I was sitting on the ripped chair in the corner of the shop on September 26th because it was my day to watch them and be there if they finally came back to us. It was clear that, unless something changed, they did not have much more time. It was nearly 8:30 pm when my father fell into a horrible coughing fit and dropped to the ground. From behind the counter, I heard a deranged version of my father's voice whisper, ""Come here, boy."" I rushed from my seat to the other side of the room to get closer to my father. ""Dad! DAD!!"" I screamed. I reached to grab his shoulders but all I could feel was wrinkled skin and brittle bone. ""Please, Dad, say something!"" I pleaded. My cheeks were soaked with tears and my body was shaking. ""Listen close, boy,"" came a faint sound. ""Yes, Dad, what is it?"" ""Promise me, son, that you'll find a used Thule Helium Platform Bike Carrier online for only $200, give or take a cent."" ""Of course, Dad. Of course,"" 



These would be the last words ever shared between me and my late father. As soon as he spoke the phrase, ""Promise me, son, that you'll find a used Thule Helium Platform Bike Carrier online for only $200, give or take a cent,"" to me, my life's purpose has changed totally. I hold a job, I have friendships, and, hell, I even still like to make new recipes. But there is a weight to my life now that bears down on me greatly. The best I can describe it is to ask you to imagine having to always wear three or four large coats so that each hug is felt but dulled. I truly believe that I cannot recover from this until I buy a used Thule Helium Platform Bike Carrier online for only $200, give or take a cent. So now I ask you again, having laid myself bare and made my intentions clear, will you please do a take back on the other person and accept my offer of $200.01?

  


Thank you kindly and why WHINE when you can WINE?

Cleaned it out, tossed the pellets in, and it’s been kind of perfect ever since.

I’m using the stainless one with the clamp lid and the little date wheel, and it keeps everything fresh without taking up much space. The little window on the front is surprisingly handy too — I can tell exactly what’s in there at a glance.

A few things I’ve liked about it:

* The seal is solid, so moisture from the tank doesn’t sneak in
* The date wheel makes it easy to remember when I opened the food
* The scoop makes portioning stupid easy

If you’ve got multiple small batches of food, tossing each one into its own Ziploc bag and then dropping them all into the canister works great. Keeps everything organized and still airtight.

I just dump my main pellet mix in there and keep freeze‑dried stuff in their original bags. If you feed a bunch of different foods, you could totally run multiple canisters.

Hello everyone, i am in need of some advice.

Currently I'm in my last years of bachelors. Since last year I work from time to time at the OR, assisting surgery by retracting incision, cleaning wound, suction of blood, repositing patiënt, etc. Basically what a master student does during the study.

Now for the problem. It's a long workday (no weekends available): working from 7:30AM till 5PM. It has one official lunchbreak of half an hour and one unofficial coffee break of 15 minutes. 

Since I also study fulltime, I obviously don't have much time to do this job. At max once in the 2 weeks. Sometimes 3 or 4 weeks in between. This cause results in that I still do not have a good routine at work. Therefore, I have to think about a lot of steps I do (which should be automatically by now).

However, the staff (OR assistants and surgeons) have noted that I am a little slow sometimes with doing certain tasks (on which they think should be in my system already). This resulted in me getting a conversation about my performance. I still had my contract extended for another year, but every time I go to work here, I feel a lot of performance stress. Due to the early start (I sleep 6,5 hours most of the times), the stress of doing something wrong and the long working hours,  I get very tired around 3PM. Resulting in more little mistakes (e.g. not getting a sheet immediately when I do that every OR, not picking up signals).

I've tried talking to OR assistants and surgeons and most seemed understanding. However after a few times they seem to still have the expectation of swiftness that I can't yet deliver.

I really like the type work and am very eager to making steps towards surgery, but this environment leaves me drained at the end of the day and gives me stress before I start my day. 

For extra info: I'm a tall guy who sports a lot. So I have to eat a lot, which I mostly do (I am hungry at the end, but not limiting me). I also am used to standing in my feet all day, so this is not the problem.

I really want to know that you guys think and what your experiences are. Thanks!",1,1770747816.0,medicalschool,0,1.0,False

And honestly? Most relationship advice is straight up garbage.



The stuff that actually works isn't what you see on Instagram. It's not about date nights or love languages (though those help). The real habits are way more subtle, way more powerful, and backed by actual research from people like the Gottmans who studied thousands of couples for decades.



Here's what I found.



\*\*Stop trying to ""win"" arguments.\*\* The healthiest couples I studied? They argue differently. They're not trying to prove they're right. They're trying to understand. Research from Dr. John Gottman shows that 69% of relationship conflicts are perpetual, meaning they never fully resolve. The couples who make it aren't the ones who solve every problem. They're the ones who can disagree without contempt. When you feel that urge to prove your point, pause. Ask yourself if being right is worth being disconnected. 



\*\*""[The Seven Principles for Making Marriage Work](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Seven_Principles_for_Making_Marriage_Work)""\*\* by Dr. John Gottman is genuinely life changing for this. Gottman studied over 3,000 couples and can predict divorce with 94% accuracy. This book breaks down exactly what separates couples who thrive from those who don't. The research is insane. Best relationship book I've ever read, hands down.



\*\*Repair attempts matter more than perfect communication.\*\* You know those couples who seem flawless? They're not. They just know how to repair. A repair attempt is any gesture, word, or action that prevents negativity from spiraling. It can be humor, touching your partner's arm, or just saying ""I'm sorry, can we start over?"" The Gottman Institute found that successful couples make and accept repair attempts during conflict. Failed couples ignore them. It's that simple. Practice this: next time you're arguing and it's escalating, try literally anything to break the tension. A small joke. An acknowledgment. ""Hey, we're both getting heated."" It works.



\*\*Assume positive intent, even when it's hard.\*\* This one saved my last relationship. Our brains are wired for negativity bias. We interpret neutral actions as negative when we're stressed. Your partner forgets to text back? Your anxious brain screams ""they don't care."" Reality? They were probably just busy. Healthy couples give each other the benefit of the doubt. They don't jump to the worst conclusion. 



The app Paired is actually solid for this. It's a relationship app with daily questions and research backed exercises. Not sponsored, just genuinely helped me understand my patterns better. They have modules on communication, intimacy, conflict. Way better than scrolling Reddit at 2am wondering if your relationship is doomed.



\*\*Share your inner world, not just your schedule.\*\* There's a massive difference between ""how was your day?"" and actually sharing what's happening inside your head. Dr. Sue Johnson, who created Emotionally Focused Therapy, talks about this constantly. Healthy couples don't just coordinate logistics. They share fears, dreams, insecurities. The mundane and the deep. Start small. Share one thing today that made you feel vulnerable. See what happens. 



\*\*""[Hold Me Tight](https://www.google.com/url?sa=t&source=web&rct=j&opi=89978449&url=https://www.amazon.in/Hold-Me-Tight-Sue-Johnson/dp/031611300X&ved=2ahUKEwijrt_uxM-SAxV-X2wGHbITLBYQFnoECCUQAQ&usg=AOvVaw0J2keP5kXP-v3u5DUSQ6Pf)""\*\* by Dr. Sue Johnson breaks down attachment science in relationships. Johnson has a 90% success rate with couples therapy using her methods. The book explains why we get stuck in negative cycles and how to create secure attachment. It'll make you rethink everything about how you connect. Insanely good read.



\*\*Celebrate the small wins together.\*\* Research from Dr. Shelly Gable at UCLA found that how couples respond to good news matters MORE than how they handle bad news. When your partner shares something positive, your response matters. Passive responses kill connection. Active, enthusiastic responses build it. Your partner got a compliment at work? Don't just say ""cool."" Actually engage. ""That's amazing, tell me what happened."" This builds what Gottman calls your ""emotional bank account.""



\*\*Know your own triggers and communicate them.\*\* Most relationship fights aren't actually about the dishes or being late. They're about deeper wounds getting activated. Maybe being ignored as a kid. Maybe past betrayals. Healthy couples know their triggers and can name them. ""When you cancel plans last minute, it brings up my abandonment stuff"" is way different than ""you never prioritize me."" This requires serious self awareness. 



Therapy helps here, obviously. But also the podcast ""Where Should We Begin?"" with Esther Perel gives you a window into how couples actually work through this stuff. Perel is a therapist who records real sessions (with permission). You hear actual couples navigating triggers, betrayal, disconnection. It's raw and honestly therapeutic just to listen.



For those wanting to go deeper on relationship patterns but finding it hard to carve out time for all these books and research, there's an app called [BeFreed](https://www.google.com/url?sa=t&source=web&rct=j&opi=89978449&url=https://apps.apple.com/us/app/learn-anything-befreed/id6739747450&ved=2ahUKEwiD-av-xM-SAxU5RmwGHb06DT8QFnoECBwQAQ&usg=AOvVaw1KtHkWuBtO3jhNTsWhztFF) that's been pretty useful. It's a personalized learning app built by Columbia grads that pulls from relationship psychology books, therapy research, and expert insights to create custom audio content based on your specific situation. 



You can tell it something like ""struggling with anxious attachment and need practical ways to communicate needs without pushing my partner away"" and it generates a tailored learning plan with episodes you can customize from quick 10-minute overviews to 40-minute deep dives. The knowledge comes from the same sources mentioned here, Gottman's research, attachment theory, couples therapy frameworks, and it connects the dots in a way that fits your actual relationship struggles. Makes absorbing all this research way more manageable when you're commuting or doing laundry.



\*\*Maintain your own identity.\*\* The couples who last? They don't merge into one person. They maintain friendships, hobbies, goals outside the relationship. Research shows that too much closeness can actually harm relationships. You need differentiation. You need to be a whole person who CHOOSES to be with another whole person. Not two halves desperately clinging together. Keep your Tuesday pottery class. Keep your solo morning walks. Keep your separate friend groups. It makes the time together better.



\*\*Regularly check in on the relationship itself.\*\* Healthy couples don't wait for things to break before they talk about them. They have meta conversations about the relationship. ""How are we doing?"" ""What do you need more of from me?"" ""What's working?"" Most people avoid these talks because they're scared of what they'll hear. But avoidance doesn't prevent problems, it just delays them. Try a monthly relationship check in. Casual. Over coffee. Just ten minutes. It prevents resentment from building into a mountain.



Look, relationships are messy. Biology, attachment wounds, society telling us love should be effortless. It all makes this harder than it needs to be. But these habits? They're based on decades of research from people who've studied what actually works. Not Instagram highlight reels. Real couples. Real data.



The couples who make it aren't lucky. They're intentional. They practice these habits even when it's uncomfortable. Especially when it's uncomfortable.



You're not broken if your relationship takes work. That's just being human.

1r18kgd,https://www.reddit.com/r/WeSuckAtDating/comments/1r18kgd/super_chill_first_date_ideas_for_20_somethings/,Super chill first date ideas for 20 somethings.,"Dating in your 20s is a weird mix of wanting something fun but not trying way too hard. First dates work best when they’re low-pressure, easy to bail from if the feeing isn't right, and still give you something to talk about. Here are five casual first date ideas that actually make sense for 20-somethings.

Coffee, but with a twist. Instead of a generic coffee shop meetup, try a café you’ve never been to or one with something unique like specialty drinks, board games, or outdoor seating. It keeps the commitment short but still leaves room to extend the date if things are going well.

A walk with a purpose. Meeting for a walk in a park, along a river, or through a cool neighborhood takes away the awkwardness of sitting face-to-face the whole time. Having scenery to comment on helps conversation flow naturally and makes silences feel less intense.

Street food or a casual food market. Food dates don’t have to be a full sit-down dinner. Grabbing tacos from a truck or wandering a food market together feels relaxed and gives you built-in conversation starters. Plus, sharing opinions on food is an easy way to bond.

Something slightly interactive. Mini golf, bowling, or an arcade bar adds a playful element without turning it into a full-on activity date. Doing something with your hands helps calm nerves and shows personality without forcing deep conversation too fast.

A low-key drink early in the evening. Meeting for one drink instead of “going out” sets clear expectations. It’s social, grown-up, and flexible. If you’re having fun, grab another. If not, you both have an easy exit.",3,1770747644.0,WeSuckAtDating,1,1.0,False

This morning I fell really hard on ice while bringing a friend a coffee. I landed mostly on my left side and elbow, and I think I felt or heard a crack, but I’m not sure if it was my body or the ice. At first, I was more embarrassed than anything, so the pain didn’t hit me.

A few hours later, my back started hurting, especially when moving—turning, picking up my baby, or bending. I have random shooting pains in my spine that come and go from mid-back to lower back, my right side hurts more than my left, my left arm feels weak, my neck is sore now, and my elbow is bruised and throbbing. I even got lightheaded when standing up earlier. I’ve also had slight cramping, but very mild.

I’m a couple months post-C-section, so my core is still healing, which might be making my back worse. I don’t really want to get checked out unless I have to, but I was just wondering if anyone else fell hard on ice and thought it looked minor at first, but ended up with random pain, weakness, or neck/back issues afterward?",1,1770747518.0,AskDocs,1,1.0,False

1r18gu2,https://i.redd.it/sjqre239lpig1.jpeg,Meticulous: 1 week in,"I’ve had the Meticulous for about a week now. It’s an extremely satisfying machine to use, and once I got it dialed in, the coffee I’ve been getting out of it has been fantastic.

The Good

	•	Build quality is ridiculous. This thing feels incredibly solid. All touch points feel exceptionally premium.

	•	Borderline silent. Coming from a Breville Barista Express, the lack of noise is very welcome.

	•	Insane adjustability. Dialing in is on another level. You have access to so many parameters—it’s far beyond just increasing or decreasing yield. Shot sour but you like the texture? Increase temp or decrease flow rate. You can easily get lost in adjustments, but I’ve been trying to keep it simple.

	•	The app is overall excellent. This is probably the only app-controlled device where I’ve genuinely preferred using the app over the physical hardware.

⸻

The Bad

	•	Occasional non-responsiveness. Like any piece of tech, there have been a few times where I’ve needed to reset it. Interestingly, the machine has frozen on the screen, but I was still able to control it via the app.

	•	Feels a bit “beta.” Overall, the experience still feels slightly unfinished. Meticulous has been very vocal about continuously improving the UX via over-the-air updates, but some things still feel clunky.

	•	Flow profiles are awkward to get. You have to leave the app to download flow profiles, which feels unnecessary. At the very least, they could integrate a direct link to the Discord for easier access.

⸻

Final Thoughts

Long story longer, I’m very happy with this machine. I paid full price, ordered in November, and received it about a week ago. I was strongly considering a La Marzocco Linea Mini (a different price bracket and not a direct comparison, I know), but I’m glad I went with the Meticulous instead.

1r18g0a,https://www.reddit.com/r/NarcissisticSpouses/comments/1r18g0a/the_nice_guy_narcissist/,"The ""nice guy"" narcissist","This is my story, and in some ways a warning for those that have a ""nice"" covert narcissist. 

In the beginning of our relationship, I really thought he was so very nice. There were definitely a few red flags, but we were able to communicate. I thought we could get past the early issues. One very weird early red flag was how upset he got over my coffee cups. I had a daily routine of having my cup of coffee in the morning while getting ready for work and sometimes it didn't make it back into the kitchen. I always put it by the sink or washed it in the evening. Mind you, I lived by myself and to me this was not a big deal at all. It became such a thing, it was eventually brought up in therapy. Looking back I realized that it was a sign of what was to come. Early on in the relationship, about 4 months in, we moved in together. This was not really because I wanted to, but because his roommates moved out and it was cheaper to live together. And then I got pregnant. And then the first round of madness started. 

He has an ex, with whom he has a child, they lived in different countries. Yes, the crazy ex wife, a story many of us have been told. She had just found out about me, the literal moment I found out I was pregnant and tried to get him back? Or maybe I don't know the whole story. In hind sight I didn't know the whole story. It really seemed like he was telling the truth, and he said he wanted to go back to her. It was a confusing time and at some point, knowing how much he missed his child, I told him to just go and I worked out a plan of what I would do. But it is never that simple. She ended up starting a relationship with another man (to whom she is now married), he found out, madness ensued. It was easy to believe she was the problem and so we stayed together.

Things were mostly ok for a long time after that, except for my issues with being messy, which I tried to work on, in the sense that he would complain, I would do better, but every time I slipped or something bothered him, it was like I had never done better or even tried. At one point I had 1 day off work a week and if I didn't use that time to clean, he would say something. I hate feeling controlled so this started huge fights. It was my free time, I can decide what to do with it etc. 

So that never got better, we had arguments about that all the time, and the thing is, he doesn't clean, not the way I do. He is messier than I am but could not see that. He would criticize me for things he was doing himself. He wasn't constantly cleaning up after me, I was constantly cleaning up after him. During one of these arguments, I got so frustrated I literally yelled ""but I probably have adhd! my teachers thought I did as a kid!"" So he paid for testing. I am both adhd and autistic. It was right around the time my daughter got diagnosed with autism as well. 

After that I assumed things would get better because there was a reason for my executive dysfunction, but no, now I was using it as an ""excuse"". I went on medication for while and he started calling me a drug addict. The time I was on medication though was the time I started realizing what was really happening. He has massive mood swings. He will get annoyed, seemingly from something going on inside his mind, and take it out on me. He would be perfectly fine one minute and the next angry, when nothing triggered it. It wasn't about me, but boy did he like to blame it on me. We started having the same argument over and over, I would repeat word for word the same responses because it was the same fight. For him, it was always like the first time. He didn't seem to like the fact that I was doing better on medication and found ways to bring me down. He started non sensical arguments when I was in a good mood or when I talked about something I was interested in. 

Then I got covid and then long covid. I got really really sick and I could barely function. All my energy went to trying to keep my job and taking care of my daughter. He told me I was ""faking it"" told me I ""wanted an excuse to be lazy"", but only during his ""mood swings"" in between, on the days I felt really bad or told him about my symptoms, he acted like he was supportive, then his mood would shift and it was like all that support never happened at all. There came a point where I had to emotionally severe ties with him so I could focus on getting better. I researched endlessly on strategies to heal myself, ignored every thing he said to me (grey rock I suppose). I made a priority list of which things I considered important and only did those things and didn't worry about anything else because I couldn't. Over the course of a year or so, I did get better and feel recovered now, but never became emotionally attached to him again. We still live together, we don't sleep together, but on the outside it still looks like we have a relationship.

I realize, now that I am healed from my illness, that the whole time he was projecting. He felt bad and needed me to feel bad in order for him to feel better. On the days of his ""mood swings"" something, not me, but something else, gave him a narcissistic injury. It could even have been his own thoughts. There is no rhyme or reason I can see. In the past, pre my adhd diagnoses, he would come to me to make him feel better, so I could tell him nothing was his fault, so I could be positive supply. But I think when I started doing better than him, especially when I could still take medication, it made him feel bad about himself. He started to become really cruel about very small things. He blames, he points fingers, he projects.

Importantly, he acts like a completely loving human in front of friends and relatives, even to the point where, as soon as they are not around, he will act completely cruel and mean as if it was building inside him waiting for the moment he can let loose. He has told my friend's fiancee that he still loves me and wants to be with me, while he told me that he doesn't care for me at all. In person, he has nothing good to say to me. Due to the way he acts in in front of friends and relatives, I know he is trying to set me up to look like the bad guy when we do in fact separate. People believe the same as me, he is a nice guy. And he is nice, to the people who are not close to him. What they do not see is that, if you live with him, there is a side that they cannot see, because they are not here to witness it. It makes me feel very lonely, like there is no one I can confide in. I feel like I am living in his fake reality.

I am surviving by the mere fact that I am no longer emotionally invested in the relationship. Financially I am unable to leave, but I am working on it. My daughter loves her father and that weighs heavy on my shoulders, but his mood swings affect her too. I am left doing damage control.

In conclusion, covert narcissism is definitely a Jekyll and Hyde situation. In some ways I am lucky and it could be a lot worse, but it's already been hell. ",2,1770747386.0,NarcissisticSpouses,2,1.0,False

SPEAKER: Don’t you even go there! Who the \*bleep\* do you think you are! You can’t just walk up to people and ask them what’s wrong with them, or worse, use that kind of language! If you don’t stop bothering us, I will call the police, and then you can explain this to them! \*\*

ABLEIST: Alright, I’m leavin, I'm leavin!

(under breath) I can’t believe the people these days…

SPEAKER: *\[trying to stay calm\]* Honey, you can let go of me now.

\[listener hugs\]

*\[fabric rustles SFX\]*

Oh.

It’s okay, I’ve got you. You’re going to be okay.

What? What do you mean, you’re kind of used to this? *(increasing anger)* That’s not okay! People shouldn’t just be coming up to you on the street and asking what’s wrong with you! Don’t ever get used to that! You don’t deserve that kind of crap!

Sorry, I didn’t mean to get so loud.

Still, that’s not okay. No one should be treating you like that. Or using such abominable words! I cannot believe that \*insult\*’s audacity…

(sigh) Are you okay? Do you need to sit down?

You want to go home? I understand. Did you drive here?

You took the train? That’s impressive…

I’m sorry, I meant, for someone like you, it’s hard to… Okay, I’m sorry, that sounded bad.

Thanks, love. What I meant was, that sounds difficult. Would you mind if I drove you home?

No, it’s no trouble at all. 

\[speaker+listener walk towards the car\]

Actually, do you want to come to my place? We could get some snacks, maybe watch a movie?

*\[light-hearted\]* Yes, you can pick the snacks and the movie. As long as its not black licorice. You know how I feel about it!

This is mine. May I get the door for you, my liege?

*\[car door opens SFX\]*

*\[joking\]* Always a pleasure, your highness.

*\[car door closes SFX\]*

*\[car engine rolls over SFX\]*

So, is my place good? 

You could even borrow some pyjamas if you wanted. I’m sure I can find something about your size.

Why not? It’s a Saturday, it’s not like there’s any laws against wearing pyjamas in the middle of the day.

It’s not like we’re going to Walmart, no one needs to know. *(teasing)* It can be our secret.

Do you want to close your eyes for a bit? 

**(fading out slowly)** I’ll let you know when we get there. It shouldn’t be long.

1r18fct,https://www.reddit.com/r/TheIronCouncil/comments/1r18fct/the_sexiest_summer_essentials_for_grown_men_no/,The sexiest summer essentials for grown men (no cargo shorts allowed),"Every summer it happens. Grown men, smart, successful, fully capable adults, step out looking like they just got lost on the way to a frat party. Think baggy board shorts, graphic tees with ""sarcastic"" slogans, and $5 sunglasses that warp your vision. It’s not always their fault. Most guys were never taught what actually looks good past age 25. And Instagram ""style influencers"" often confuse loud trends with real aesthetic confidence.

This post pulls from real style science, menswear classics, and expert advice from sources like Derek Guy (aka “the menswear guy” on Twitter), GQ’s style editors, and podcasts like “Blamo!” to build a grownman summer essentials list that doesn’t scream “midlife crisis in Vegas.” If you’ve ever felt stuck between looking boring or trying too hard, this is for you.

Here’s your grown man’s guide to being hot this summer, no linen rompers required.

Tailored shorts that hit 13 inches above the knee  

 According to GQ, inseams between 57 inches are the sweet spot. Opt for neutral tones (khaki, olive, navy). Avoid anything cargo. Fit is everything—no bagginess, no sausage casing.

Camp collar shirts (aka Cuban collar)  
 
These have exploded in popularity for a reason. They're breathable, slightly retro, and cool without being loud. Research from the Fashion Institute of Technology suggests that the open collar frame flatters most face shapes while signalling relaxed confidence.

Quality sunglasses with proper UV protection  
 
 Toss the gas station pairs. Go for classic frames like Wayfarers or Clubmasters. A 2021 report from the American Academy of Ophthalmology found that UV damage can age your eyes faster than you think. Style + health = win.

Minimalist white sneakers or leather sandals  

 Common Projects, Adidas Stan Smiths, or Birkenstocks if you're leaning breezier. Psychology of fashion studies (University of Hertfordshire, 2012) found that clean shoes are one of the first things people use to assess a stranger’s personality.

Breathable fabrics: linen, cotton, Tencel  

  Derek Guy often emphasises fabric > branding. Linen shirts wrinkle, yes, but they breathe better than polyester “performance” garbage. Stick to natural fabrics to avoid sweat patches and discomfort.

 A signature summer scent (not Axe bodyspray)  

Scents like Tom Ford’s Neroli Portofino or Maison Margiela’s Replica ‘Beach Walk’ offer light, citrusy vibes that don’t overwhelm. A Harvard study found that scent is the most emotionally potent sense, so wear something that makes people remember you.

 A well-fitted short-sleeve button-down  
 
Not a tee. Not a polo. Something in between. Brands like Uniqlo, Buck Mason, or Percival offer cuts that flatter and keep it simple. According to cognitive psychologist Dr Carolyn Mair, clothing that signals intention and care tends to boost self-esteem and external perception.

 A cool tote or canvas weekend bag  

 Skip the Jansport. Opt for something adult. A tote is functional, stylish, and sends “I read books and drink coffee in real cups” energy. Vogue Business reports totes as the “new briefcase” for casual summer worklife vibes.

This isn’t about overcomplicating your look. It’s about upgrading what you already wear so you look like you actually know who you are. When you dress intentionally, people treat you differently and better.

Stop dressing like you got dressed in the dark with boxy logo tees and mesh gym shorts. You don’t have to wear designer, just wear *better*.

Trump couldn’t handle our green bean casseroles, our game nights, our love for our neighbor. It’s been over 2 years since the white pages dropped the neighborist manifesto; a specter that’s haunting middle America.

It’s 2028 and things are different now! We voted out Trump, and soon our democratic regime will do things a little differently around here…

No longer will ICE ravage our city centers… they will return to the countryside to ravage lumpens as Christ intended.

No longer will fascist demagogues rule the executive branch. Our new leader Gavin Newsom rules with kindness. His first executive order? To spread joy by pardoning the previous administration.

Yep. The anti-fascist community won. Democracy is saved!

3 years ago, I was a anti-social communist…

(The crowd at my woke charismatic church gasps)

That’s right… I thought “class conflict” would bring about “change.” What a moron I was… locking myself in my room reading Marx, Engels, any Bolshevik or left communist who had something to say. All while the real “real movement” was learning how to make our sourdough!

How stupid I was, thinking Trump was a weird historical phenomenon of liberalism. Little did I know he was actually the presenting symptoms of an anti-social crisis. Long live the potluck!",21,1770747323.0,Ultraleft,8,1.0,False

My work is pretty flexible, which mostly just means I have more time to stay active, be in the gym, get out into nature, or spend time with my puppies. I’m a big believer in the effort of things, I’m a bit of a nerd about things like cooking and baking, mostly because I love the process of making something great for someone else.

I’m really looking for someone with some actual depth to them. I value curiosity and those long, rambling conversations where you really start to understand how someone’s mind works. I think there is something so underrated about just being good company for one another. I’ve always been the type to pay attention to the small details and be genuinely present, and I’m hoping to find that same kind of intentionality in return. I much prefer the quiet, sincere stuff over anything performative.

If you are grounded but still have that sense of adventure, and you don't mind a man who is probably going to try and feed you constantly or remember exactly how you like your coffee, I’d love to talk.

**THE MYSTERY OF PRAYER**

Never be afraid to pray boldly to God  
For no matter the crisis our Lord is aware.  
Sometimes it's hard to recognize God's answers  
But that's just part of the mystery of prayer.

**GOODNESS, BRAVERY, & ATTITUDE**

Stand proud and preach for the Grace of God  
If you wish to relay your gratitude.  
Set an example for those who follow  
By your goodness, bravery and attitude.

**SEEDS OF SPLENDOR**

Let God take the weight of our burdens  
We were never meant to endure alone.  
He will never bend us, break us or destroy us  
As the seeds of His splendor are sown.

**LOVE**

I love to be loved in the morning  
I love to be loved at night.  
I love to be loved anytime  
For love in the darkness is light.

**FAITH**

Our confidence and trust in a higher power  
Helps guide us through every moment and hour.  
Fidelity to one’s promise and observance of law  
Lets our Lord know we heed his call.

 

 

**LIBERTY**

May God continue to bless America  
Refusing evil, the upper hand.  
It’s up to us to stay resolute  
Defending the liberty of Man.

**INTEGRITY**

What Satan has planned for our harm  
Integrity will transform to good.  
Adhering to morals gives us peace  
Teaching us to respond, as we should.

**AMERICAN SOLDIER**

They risk their life and limb for liberty  
Standing firm against evil unwilling to break.  
To be part of something greater then themselves  
They are willing to sacrifice whatever it will take.

\*\*SEPTEMBER 11\*\*\*\*\*\***^(TH.)**

We shall seek them out wherever they may hide  
Street by street, house-by-house, cave by cave.  
They will be eradicated from the face of the earth  
By the righteous, the loyal and the brave.

**CONSCIENCE**

Our conscience makes us righteous  
It's a whisper of God in man.  
For without it we're mere puppets  
Who dance to the devil's hand.

 

**TROUBLES**

Mankind is born from a woman’s womb  
With a short life that's full of trouble.  
Faith is our refuge in times of woe  
For without it our troubles double.

**FREEDOM**

Should tomorrow start without me  
Be proud I choose to serve  
Our faith and our patriotism  
Earn the freedom we deserve.

**HAPPY HEARTS**

Happy hearts prosper on what is truthful and good  
Where dishonored ones fester and rot to the bone.  
Life charts our course but God guides our way  
As His wisdom and love become our own.

**THE KING OF CHRISTMAS**

Hallelujah Jesus the king of Christmas night  
With a star for his crown bathed in holy light  
Christ is our savior who leads by trust and love  
Delivering us from Satan to the grace of God Above.

**FOOTSTEPS**

All of Gods heroes depend on courage  
To overcome the dilemmas of strife.  
God wants us to follow in His footsteps  
As we practice His majesty of life.

**JEHOVAH**

Christians trust you can run but not hide  
From the eyes of Jehovah who is always aware  
Loving us regardless of weakness toward sin  
And when we cry out, “He’s there.”

**MY FAVORITE POET**

My favorite poet is our Father of love  
Who was first to know us before birth.  
His poetry prolongs everything we love  
As His deliverance gives life its worth.

**JESUS IS A FISHERMAN**

Jesus is a fisherman  
Who saves the souls of man.  
Dead or alive He leads the faithful  
To the streams of promise land.

**TRUST**

Goodness and evil illustrate life  
Like the two sides of every coin.  
Most can’t help but experience both  
As we learn who to trust, follow and join.

**JESUS**

The beam was up-ended by the muscles of men  
As it plunged down the hole it was carved to fit in.  
Then Jesus looked up at the lightning that flew  
And cried, ""God, My Father, they know not what they do.""

**NIGHT OF NIGHTS**

So let's rejoice, and sing with great cheer  
That night when Jesus slept without fear.  
For our Lord's birthday comes once a year  
On that night of nights we hold so dear.

**GRACE**

From dust we were made and shall return  
After life has brought us to our earthly end.  
Though all must walk in the shadow of death  
The righteous are promised they will rise again.

**WISDOM**

The words of the wise are heard in quiet  
More than the loud shouts of screaming fools.  
Wisdom and knowledge cause stability  
In the lives of those who use them as tools.

**THE ARMOR OF GOD**

Eagerly plotting to disrupt God's works  
Evil swallows up souls like the shifting sand.  
The armor of God is our divine protection  
Shielding every child, woman, and man.

**SOLDIERS**

Where are the soldiers so far, far away?  
How many will perish no one can say.  
Where are the soldiers we love night and day?  
Deployed world over to keep evil at bay.

**THEY SERVE TO PRESERVE**

They serve to preserve our forefathers dreams,  
Prayers, visions and determination.  
Risking all in pursuit of fulfillment of duty  
To God, freedom, faith, honor and nation.

**SOMETHING WICKED**

When something wicked stares us in the face  
To corrupt our morals, faith and resolve.  
God gives us courage to defend what’s right  
No matter the sacrifice or danger involved.

**EVIL**

Evil seeks to destroy the good in man  
And silence the memory of God’s law.  
It’s up to the faithful to stay unyielding  
Defending the liberty and justice of all.

**HARM’S WAY**

Our men and woman who serve in harm’s way  
Are the armor of what the free world depends on.  
Without their sacrifice of body and soul  
All that we stand for is gone.

**TERRORISM**

We’ll defeat terrorism as it should be fought  
Never letting Satan’s horde chase us to our door.  
Safeguarding our borders and system of life  
As our forefathers sacrificed before.

**AMERICA**

Never be afraid to be proud of America  
And march with the brave, faithful and just.  
Refusing to submit to the will of our enemies  
Standing firm to preserve what we trust.

**SUPPORT OUR TROOPS**

Support our troops who battle the horde  
While we live the good life back home.  
When you see a soldier show them your smile  
Say “hello we love you and you’re not alone.”

**WAR**

As war is fought it takes charge  
And events spin out of control.  
The madness of men can alter the soil  
Which nourishes the roots of their soul.

**HEAVEN’S MEASURE**

What we accomplish is heaven’s measure  
As patriots respond to the threats of man.  
Protect and defend what we love till death  
As the soldiers of Satan arise from the sand.

**WE WHO REMAIN**

America has survived all attempts to destroy  
Knowing the cruelty of war  
And, we who remain  
Must help keep her free  
For those who can march no more!

**VETERAN'S DAY**

The cost of freedom is sometimes high  
Extremely more when our loved one's die.  
Men and women pledged to fight and serve  
And it's our support that they deserve.

**FORMIDABLE FOE**

America is the birthday cake of earth  
As the ants march from every direction.  
Thank God for all who have sworn to defend her  
Serving with love, honor, pride, and affection.

**EVERY CHILD OF GOD**

 

Every child of God arrived to do good

Every child of God must serve what they should.

Every child of God shall always feel love

Every child of God and Heaven above!

 

**MOMS**

 

Moms are certainly God’s gift to Earth

So if you still have one, let it be known.

You can’t imagine your life without her

While the seeds of your future are sown.

 

**HEAVEN’S HEROES**

All Heaven's heroes except for Jesus and Daniel

Had to be forgiven for their willingness to stray.

They let God down and paid the price

And their stories still relate today.

 

**GREED**

 

Wealth, fame, power, and libido

Are the trophies of what greed consists of.

A hunger to experience every exotic wish  
Overpowering the glory of love.

 

**CHRISTMAS & LOVE**

 

Christmas helps us remember  
What the joys of life are for.  
It makes us want to love someone  
Till angels arrive and more.

 

**HATRED!**

 

If hatred consumes you refuse it control  
For only then can you begin to live.

We don't have to remain wicked and spiteful  
We just have to be willing to forgive.

 

**HARDSHIPS**

 

# The Lord knows and sees our hardships

Dilemmas we are unable to control.

He personally invites us to turn to Him

As the outcomes of life take their toll.

 

**ANGER**

An angry soul opens its mouth  
And shuts its mind to reason.  
All who stay slow to anger  
Are loved by more each season.

 

# OLD AGE??

Oh, bear with me for I am old  
And lucky to be alive.

My years have passed much too fast  
Though somehow, I survive.

 

If I repent, my parson said  
My sins shall be forgiven  
Not to wait until too late  
And miss my bus to Heaven.

 

**THANKSGIVING**

 

The theme of Thanksgiving has always been the same.

Though its date has changed many times.

A day for giving and remembering the less fortunate

Expressing thankfulness with our prayers, hearts and minds.

 

**REPENTANCE, GRACE & WISDOM**

 

Thank God for each and every individual

That prays for wisdom, repentance and grace.

Not perfect though remorseful, repentant when wrong

As their devotion radiates from their face.

 

**SATISFACTION**

 

No one finds satisfaction from serving themselves  
Contentment takes place, by unselfish concern.

The more we repent and regret our wrongs  
The more we are able to retain what we learn.

 

**COFFEE $$**

 

Thank God for caffeine found in coffee

Which helps multitudes make it through the day.

Like ancestors of the past, it helps energy to last

And for its stimulant we are eager to pay.

 

**HAPPY HEARTS**

 

Happy hearts prosper on what is truthful and good

Where dishonored one’s fester and rot to the bone.

Life charts our course but God guides our way

As His wisdom and love become our own.

 

**SUCCESS**

 

Let voices proclaim after we have gone

Our love for others still lives on.

Real success comes by who we actually are

Not by trinkets, a big house or car.

 

 

**THE POWER OF WORDS**

 

When we fail to control the rage of our thoughts

What is easy to say becomes hard to forgive.

Words are visions that portray our intent

The better we communicate, the better we live.

 

 

**ULTIMATE SACRIFICE**

 

Those rows of white crosses in manicured fields

Tell the story of ultimate sacrifice and love.

Always remember all we treasure and enjoy

Are because of our soldiers and God above.

 

**HONOR**

 

Honor, morality, faith and integrity

Are what life’s heroes are made of.

Defending what’s right; confronting what’s wrong

Propelled by achievement, courage, and love.

 

**LOVING OTHERS**

Loving others as we wish to be loved ourselves

Is what gives us our best blessings of life.

Think of all those who you need night and day

Praying for husband, parent, friend, coworker or wife.

 

 

**TIME**

 

Do not squander the passing time  
For that's what life is made of

Never put off till tomorrow  
Your time with those you love.

 

**POETRY & PASSION**

 

The magic of poetry is said to be its passion

So often used to teach people how to endure.

It helps us choose what to love and desire

As we experience all that is fearful and unsure.

 

**GOD’S TEST OF HEARTS**

 

The shameless hunger for power, wealth and revenge

Therefore a cruel messenger will be sent to their door.

People who justify immoral behavior

Shall be measured by their misdeeds before.

 

**CONFLICT**

 

The harder the conflict we sometimes face  
The far more glorious is the victory.  
Tyranny like hell is tough to defeat

When it raises its head throughout history.

 

**BEING LOVED BY YOU %**

 

There’s the past, present, future, and beyond

Which will test our measure by what we say and do.

Too many overlook the thrill of now

But not I, for I love being loved by you.

 

**THE POWER OF MONEY $$**

 

**Money is one of life's most powerful forces**

**To fulfill and sustain our Earthly need.**

**We work for it, spend it and waste it away**

**And sometimes we're the victim of greed.**

 

**FULFILL YOUR CALL**

 

God desires each of us to move forward

To provide example of our faith before all.

If you’re currently being called by Heaven above

Rise up, step forth and fulfill your call.

 

**WHAT KIND OF MAN?**

 

What kind of a man do you wish to be

As the footsteps of life race by?

Never hold back kind acts of love

And compassion before you die.

 

**TO BE WITH YOU**

 

Like a blind man riding a fast horse

My love for you is out of control.

I thank Heaven for each and every moment

Your love fascinates and captivates my soul.

 

**BESIDES LOVE MEN NEED FISHING**

 

Besides love men need fishing

And for both, most are wishing

Catching trophies chosen best

To be envied by the rest.

 

Most men feel they've everything

With their rod, hook, cork and string.

Be it river, pond or lake

We all pray our line won't break.

 

**FEAR**

 

The secret to overcoming fear

Is to focus on prayer not trouble.

When we go it alone, it’s always the same

All that we fear seems to multiply and double.

 

**WHEN WE DO WRONG**

 

Every time we do wrong is a reason to pray

For staying ungodly, self-centered and cruel.

As we trust God’s wisdom and heed His call

We avoid becoming lost, disloyal and a fool.

 

**WHERE GOD IS?**

 

Where Heaven is, God is

Where God is, Jesus is.

Where faith is, hope is

Where love is, trust is.

Where mercy is, joy is

Where truth is, honor is.

Where sin is, shame is

Where goodness is, God is!

 

 **THE MAGIC OF SLEEP**

 

The magic of sleep sustains the heartbeats of life

Our ability to reason, overcome and succeed.

Without its presence, we wither on the vine

Victims of exhaustion, worry and greed.

 

**WINE**

 

Wine was served at the last supper

And guzzled in King Arthur’s court.

Wine can make a sad man happy

And a mean woman turn good sport.

 

**THE POWER OF POT?**

 

My mom had arthritis could not walk around

I rolled her a joint she danced on the ground.

I thought I was losing my lovemaking knack

After I smoked some to me it came back.

 

 **TEARS OF JOY**

Not all tears are caused by suffering and pain

Some are caused by blessings from above.

Tears of joy let others witness firsthand

How we flourish from God’s purpose and love.

 

**HAPPINESS**

 

True happiness is a wonderful gift

A joy of life, from God to man.

Though most fear it can’t last

We pray to have it, as long as we can.

 

**SMILE**

 

The one thing that goes the furthest  
Towards making our lives more worthwhile  
Which costs the least but does the most

Is the sight of a friendly smile.

 

**ACCOUNTABILITY**

 

All are accountable to the judgment of God

And when we die without faith our sadness never ends.

By the deepest longing of our heart and soul

We serve our Lord, ourselves, family and friends.

 

**PASSION AND LOVE**

 

Thank Heaven for passion and love

Blessings from God to man.

Without them we’re mere creatures

Subsisting like ants in the sand.

 

 **VETERANS DAY**

 

It’s not a priest who gives us freedom of religion,

It’s not a reporter who give us freedom of voice.

It’s not any judge, lawyer, politician, preacher or teacher

But the blood of a soldier that has sacrificed by choice.

 

**COMMITMENT**

 

What we sacrifice for the needs of others means more

Then anything we might do for ourselves alone.

The more we give the more we shall receive

As the deeds of our commitment are sown.

 

**MARRIAGE**

 

Serving your partner more than yourself

Is not always simple or easy to do.

But when you love someone, you can’t replace

You reconsider your displeasure and renew.

 

**COURAGE**

 

Everyone experiences difficulty, pain, and sadness

During such trying times we rely on God’s will.

His amazing gifts are our blessings of trust and love

The foundations of life that provide, protect, and fulfill.

 

**POETRY & THE ARTS**

 

The eldest sister of all arts  
Which some have called the Devils wine.

Poetry is but pure passion  
To stimulate the heart and mind.

 

**MOMENTARY COURAGE**

 

Momentary courage helps preserve mankind

When our angel within is allowed to rise.

Men, women, children, kings and presidents

Are blessed by deeds not falsehoods and lies.

 

**HEAVEN’S BEST**

My wife to me is heaven’s best gift of all

Her goodness triumphs both inside and out.

She dedicates her life to our friendship and marriage

As our need for one another is what life is about!

 

**MUFFLED DRUMS**

 

Praise the brave that lay without sound  
Whose bodies sleep in timeless ground.

Forget them not, whose motives were true  
Those names on crosses heavy with dew.

 

**AMERICA’S BEST!**

 

How great the brave who rest in peace  
All blessings from heaven to Earth.

They gave our country but their best  
Those destined to be brave from birth.

 

**JUSTICE TEACHES US ??**

 

Justice teaches us to follow God's will

Justice teaches us to defend and fulfill.

Justice teaches us the path not to take

Justice teaches us the price of mistake.

 

**GOD’S BEST!!**

 By worthiness we must partake

For our days to be complete.

Our goodness of deeds magnifies life

No matter time’s tests of defeat.

 Some question why study history

Does our future depend on the past?  
When we forget history, we repeat its mistakes

As the outcomes of all are cast.

1r18dcn,https://www.reddit.com/r/AshwagandhaSyndrome/comments/1r18dcn/ashwaganda_withdraws_timeframe/,Ashwaganda withdraws timeframe ?,"I took ashwagandha from about August 2024 to around May 11, 2025. I felt amazing and nothing bothered me, but I was also kind of emotionless. I originally took it to reduce the jitters I got from coffee.

Before traveling to Europe, I stopped taking it. When I got to Europe on May 11, 2025, I felt fine. I was drinking coffee every day, feeling normal emotions, and everything was good.

It wasn’t until I started drinking alcohol that things changed. The day after I drank, I would feel sensitive, and I would sometimes have a short panic attack (around 30 seconds). This pattern continued for about three months, from around May 20, 2025 to July 26, 2025.

Then I started taking ashwagandha again in August 2025 because I wanted to feel less anxious. But when I started it again, I felt completely normal — not relaxed like before. That was weird, but I kept taking it anyway. I also continued going out about once a week and drinking over the next couple of months.

By November 20, 2025, I noticed my body felt more sensitive, so I stopped taking ashwagandha. Within about 48 hours, I had what felt like withdrawal: constant panic attacks for two days, no sleep the first night, and barely any sleep the second night. I booked a flight back to America because I didn’t understand what was happening.

The first month (late November and December 2025) was the worst. I didn’t leave my house for the first couple weeks. My sleep was on and off. I felt like I was in a constant low-level panic state, and I only came out of it when I was distracted or talking to people. Everything felt elevated in a panic sense.

I’m not depressed and I’m not anxious. It’s more like the panic trigger is turned up. I’m also not afraid of panic attacks — that was never the main issue. It’s more that my senses and emotions feel turned up, like I’m stuck in fight-or-flight.

Month by month it has gotten better. Now around February, I can go places, go to the gym and sauna, drive, and go out clubbing. But I still feel very different than before. From the time I wake up until I go to bed, I feel like the opposite of how I felt on ashwagandha. Things that shouldn’t trigger a panic feeling still sometimes do.

I never had anxiety or panic attacks before, except maybe once in a blue moon. Week by week, I’ve improved a lot since the start, but it’s been 81 days and I don’t know how long this is going to last.

For reference: I was taking Nature’s Truth Ashwagandha Capsules, marketed as 3000 mg (10:1 extract), which is about 300 mg of extract.

I’m 23 years old and I’ve never had any mental health issues or health issues.",1,1770747230.0,AshwagandhaSyndrome,0,1.0,False

• Casio G-Shock — White GA-110 style with full box. Looks legit on the wrist, weight feels right—not plasticky. Only gripe? It runs about a minute fast over two weeks. Not dealbreaking, but noticeable if you’re timing your coffee breaks.

• Prada sunglasses — Black frames with red temple tag—surprisingly subtle. Carbon-fiber texture inside the arms is a nice touch. Pairs well with black tees or suits, doesn’t scream “logo,” just quiet flex. Outer box arrived dented, but glasses were fine.

• EA7 tracksuit — Navy blue set with bold EA7 embroidery. Thick cotton, holds shape after washes. Not stealth, but not clownish either. Perfect for travel or looking put-together while doing absolutely nothing.

• FOG Essentials hoodie — Heather grey, relaxed fit, chest print clean. Cuffs stay snug, no pilling after three washes. The kind of piece you throw on when you want to look “intentionally lazy” without trying.

• FOG Essentials pants — Matching sweats, same fabric as the hoodie. Waistband doesn’t roll down, pockets sit right. Ideal for WFH or post-gym lounging. Not flashy, but reliable.

• Stone Island hoodie — Tonal compass patch, no chest logo. Feels premium, like pre-2020 SI stock. Wore it with black cargos and got asked if it’s “real.” Maybe not—but it passes in low light.

• Nike x Stussy pants — Relaxed fit, embroidered script on the leg. Fabric’s soft but not flimsy. Looks best with a plain tee and Dunks. Nods to the collab without screaming it.

• Adidas Gazelle — Navy blue with wine heel tab. Classic silhouette, clean stitching. Not a runner, but a solid daily shoe. Pairs with jeans, cargos, even shorts if you’re brave. Yellowing on sole already, though—heads up.

• Nike Dunk Low — Batch version, leather upper holds up well. Colorway’s versatile (not another panda). Laces stay tied, toe box doesn’t crease too fast. Good entry-level Dunk if you’re testing the waters.

And it's real shame because this mode has so much potential. Do keep this in mind though since I might make some ill-intentioned suggestions.

Imposter side:
- Should be able to destroy Reagent items lying in the environment: This counters projectile spam + Encourages Reagent to play even faster to get to items before Imposters do (but I have a solution for that)
- Their hiding spot ambushes (car trunks, lockers, chests, etc) should be instakill (5 hp bars), not interruptable by projectiles in inventory: Punishes the Reagents trying to speedrun the objectives or get to items too quickly + Encourages Xray rig which is always more fun than Stun rig, Stun rig and Stun rig.
   + This can encourage objective camping from Imposters so I'm adding a hiding timer for Imposters: If they stay in hiding spots for too long (say 1 minute), they will get zapped (1/3 hp bar per sec). If they don't exit, they die. If they do, they are put on a hiding spot ""cooldown"" (say 30s) where if they attempt to go into hiding again, they'll get zapped (1 hp bar) and knocked off of the hiding animation.

Reagent side:
- Add a Rig ""Overheat"" mechanic: After rig is used, it overheats for a period (say 10s), during which they can't use Rig rechargers. This should stop the Rig Recharger spam.
   + I thought of this to solve a situation in mind: Imposters get hit by Stun rig, go through the recovery animation, then eat another Stun rig, totalling 2 hp bars with no counterplay. With this mechanic, Reagents will be forced to put some distance between them and Imposters before using Rig Rechargers, giving Imposters the decision: keep pursuing and potentially lose another hp bar; or respawn. From a design perspective, I think this is good because it gives players decisions and trade-offs, rather than go brew yourself a coffee everytime you get Stun rigged as an imposter.

Note: The numbers I put in here are debatable, fine-tuning the stats are always a pain, but I just want to get my concepts across first. So, what do you guys think of these suggestions. What would you change about them. What suggestions of your own would you add ?",1,1770747077.0,OutlastTrials,0,0.57,False

I built Tapfree because I always felt mobile typing feels stuck in the past. When I'm moving fast, my ideas don’t arrive as perfect sentences. They come as fragments, quick reactions, and rough thoughts I need to shape into something coherent.



Most keyboards and dictation tools don’t help much. They transcribe words literally, miss context, butcher names, and leave me fixing formatting by hand. Writing an email, a chat reply, or a document all need very different handling.



What makes Tapfree different is how it understands context. Tapfree uses on-screen context (the text field and surrounding UI), not just the app you’re in, to produce cleaner, more relevant dictation.



It also handles the way people actually talk. You say ""Could you get some coffee... sorry, tea on the way back?"" and Tapfree writes: ""Could you get some tea on the way back?"". It catches your corrections mid-sentence so you don't have to go back and fix them.



If you give it a try, I’d love specific feedback:

Which app or scenario felt noticeably better (or worse) than usual dictation?

Any ""wow"" moments with the context understanding?

What would make it even more useful for you?



I have just released it on [ProductHunt](https://www.producthunt.com/posts/tapfree-for-android-2), and would love the feedback, as this is very much a side project and I’m still shaping it.

1r18947,https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/1r18947/the_foxglove_ridge_winery/,The Foxglove Ridge Winery,"*WELCOME TO NIGHT SHIFT!*   
*FOXGLOVE RIDGE WINERY*  
*Please read and follow these rules exactly. They protect you, the guests, and the cellar.*

When I applied, the listing said: Overnight Cellar Attendant (Seasonal).  
It mentioned inventory, sanitation, “light security,” and a pay bump for harvest week.

It did *not* mention the rules.

The tasting room manager, Maris Reeve, slid a laminated sheet across the bar like a check you couldn’t refuse.

“Read it,” she said. “Then initial every line. If you skip, it notices.”

“It?” I tried to laugh. It came out thin.

Maris didn’t smile. Behind her, the last daylight bled through the big windows, turning the bottles on the wall into stained glass.

“The vineyard has weather,” she said. “The winery has memory. The cellar has appetite.”

She tapped the sheet once with a fingernail.

“And tonight,” she added, “you’re the only one here to keep it polite.”

The stagnant light faded as it fell on the final page.

**1) No perfumes, no scented lotions, no gum.**  
If you smell like fruit, it will assume you’re part of the vintage.

**2) Lock the front doors at 9:00 PM. Leave the “OPEN” sign exactly as it is.**  
Do not turn it off. Do not turn it on. If it changes by itself, do not acknowledge it.

**3) If the bell above the tasting room door rings after 9:00 PM, do not look toward the entrance.**  
Count to *thirteen* slowly. If the bell rings again before you finish, start over.  
If you reach thirteen and the bell rings once more, go to the sink and rinse both hands in cold water.

**4) Don’t pour anything after midnight.**  
Not wine, not water, not detergent. Liquids moving downhill wake up the wrong parts of the building.

**5) The barrel room is not a shortcut.**  
If you enter for work, you must exit the same door you used.  
If you forget and exit a different way, you will smell smoke for the rest of the night. Don’t follow it.

**6) At 10:17 PM, you may hear a cork pop.**  
Do not investigate. Do not call out.  
If you hear *two* corks pop, put on the ear protection by the crush pad and keep it on for exactly ten minutes.

**7) If you see footprints on the concrete that look wet, do not step in them.**  
Walk around.  
If the footprints begin to appear *ahead* of you, stop moving and say: “Inventory is up to date.”

**8) The temperature in the cellar stays at 55°F.**  
If the display reads 54°F, it is sulking. Work quietly.  
If it reads 56°F, it is excited. Do not go below the stairs until it calms.  
If it reads *57°F*, clock out and wait in your car with the doors locked until the display returns to 55°F.

**9) If a guest knocks from inside the restroom after closing, do not unlock it.**  
Slide a clean towel under the door instead.  
If the towel slides back *folded*, do not touch it again.

**10) Do not read labels out loud in the cellar.**  
It repeats names. Sometimes it improves them.

**11) If you find a broken glass with no spill, leave it.**  
Put a cone around it. Come back at sunrise.  
If the shards have moved, add another cone and don’t mention it.

**12) At 2:00 AM, conduct a “headcount.”**  
There should be:

* You
* The building
* The wine If you count *four*, you have been joined by a *taste*. Don’t react. If you count *five*, you have been joined by a *thirst*. Do not run.

**13) If the phone rings after 3:00 AM, let it ring exactly three times. Then answer.**  
Say: “Foxglove Ridge, this is the night shift.”  
If the voice asks what year it is, tell it the current year.  
If the voice says, “No, the *other* year,” hang up gently and unplug the phone.

**14) If you smell fermenting peaches, go to the nearest mirror.**  
Check your teeth.  
If they are stained purple, you are fine.  
If they are stained red, rinse your mouth with water and spit it into the *floor drain*, not the sink.

**15) Never go into the vineyard after dark.**  
If you hear someone calling from the rows, do not answer.  
If they say your name twice, turn on the floodlights and keep your eyes on the gravel, not the vines.

**16) If you break a rule, apologize to the cellar door.**  
One apology is courtesy. Two is begging.  
Do not beg.

At the bottom, in the same clean font as the rest, it read:

**IF YOU CANNOT FOLLOW THESE RULES, QUIT BEFORE MIDNIGHT.**  
**AFTER MIDNIGHT, IT COUNTS YOU AS PRODUCT.**

There was a space for initials beside each rule. I initialed like my rent depended on it.

Because it did.

Maris watched until I finished.

“Any questions?” she asked.

“A couple,” I said carefully. “What’s with the headcount?”

Maris glanced toward the hallway that led to the cellar stairs. The air back there looked…cooler. Denser. Like the dark was refrigerated.

“It’s not a haunting,” she said. “It’s a process.”

“That’s…not reassuring.”

“It’s not supposed to be,” she replied, and then she reached under the bar and placed something in my hand.

A small brass tasting key on a chain.

“Keep this on you,” she said. “If you hear your name spoken from a barrel, you tap the key twice on the nearest bung. Not once. Not three. Twice.”

“And if I do everything right?”

Maris’s expression softened into something almost sympathetic.

“Then the winery ignores you,” she said. “Which is the best outcome we offer.”

The first hour was just work.

Mopped floors. Stacked empty cases. Checked the cooling unit. Logged barrel humidity.

At 10:17 PM, a cork popped somewhere deep inside the building.

It wasn’t loud. It was intimate. The sound of a secret coming unstuck.

Rule 6: do not investigate.

I didn’t move. I watched the wall clock above the tasting room door like it could protect me with its honest ticking.

A minute later: another cork pop.

Two.

I grabbed the big orange ear protectors from the hook by the crush pad and snapped them over my head. The world muffled instantly, like cotton stuffed in my skull.

And that’s when I noticed the other sound I hadn’t heard before the protectors:  
a faint, steady *swallowing* from below the cellar stairs.

I kept the protectors on for ten minutes exactly.

At the end of ten minutes, the swallowing stopped.

I took the protectors off and did not breathe too loudly.

At 11:40 PM, I found wet footprints on the concrete behind the bottling line.

No puddle. No drip trail. Just perfect footprints, as if someone had stepped out of a river and decided to walk in a straight line toward the cellar door.

Rule 7.

I walked around them.

Halfway around, a new footprint appeared—*ahead of me*—a glossy, wet imprint that formed like a bruise blooming.

My skin went cold.

I stopped moving.

“Inventory is up to date,” I said, out loud, to the empty room.

The air paused.

Then, as if disappointed, the footprints stopped appearing.

I backed away slowly, like you do around a skittish animal.

Behind me, the “OPEN” sign flickered.

Not off. Not on.

Just…confused.

I didn’t acknowledge it.

Midnight came like a lid closing.

I kept my hands dry. I did not pour water. I did not rinse a rag. I let sticky spots stay sticky. I let the discomfort build.

Better sticky than noticed.

At 12:22 AM, the cellar temperature display, which had been normally a smug, constant 55°F, ticked up.

56°F.

Rule 8: excited.

I stayed upstairs. I busied myself with paper logs. I made my handwriting neat enough to qualify as prayer.

Then it read:

57°F.

My heartbeat turned sharp.

Rule 8: clock out and wait in your car.

I didn’t argue. I didn’t second-guess. I grabbed my keys and walked out through the side door, not the front.

The air outside was autumn-clean, cool with leaf rot and distance.

I sat in my car. Locked the doors. Watched the winery’s dark windows stare back.

For three minutes, nothing happened.

Then the floodlights by the vineyard snapped on.

Row after row of vines lit up like ribs.

And in the middle of them—far too far from the building to be comforting—something stood between two rows.

Not a person. Not an animal.

A shape with the *idea* of shoulders, as if someone had tried to imitate a human using only shadow and trellis wire.

It didn’t move.

It didn’t have to.

My phone buzzed.

The winery phone number.

I didn’t answer.

It buzzed again.

And again.

Then it stopped.

In the silence, from somewhere in the vines, I heard my name.

Once.

“Michael.”

I stared at the gravel outside my car, exactly as Rule 15 demanded.

My name again.

Twice.

“Michael.”

My hands shook on the steering wheel. I didn’t look. I didn’t answer. I reached down and flicked the floodlight switch panel by the door. On, off, on, as if I could make brightness into a weapon.

The lights stayed on.

Something in the rows exhaled, slow and patient, like a wine thief tasting air.

Then the cellar temperature display in the tasting room window, visible faintly through the glass, clicked back down.

55°F.

The floodlights shut off.

The shape vanished with them, as if darkness had simply reclaimed its property.

I waited another ten minutes before I went back inside.

At 2:00 AM, I did the headcount.

Me.  
The building.  
The wine.

Three.

But as I stood there, holding the clipboard, I felt a fourth presence slide into the count the way a scent slides under a door.

Not a body.

A *taste*. Four.

Like the moment before swallowing, when you don’t know if you’re about to enjoy it or regret it.

Rule 12: don’t react.

I stared at the wall. I blinked slowly. I pretended not to notice the way my tongue tingled, as if someone had dripped a drop of something cold and expensive onto it.

A thought arrived in my head that wasn’t mine:

*Pour.*

Rule 4: don’t pour anything after midnight.

My throat tightened. My hand twitched toward the sink.

*Pour,* the thought insisted, sweeter now. *Just a little. For us.*

I found the brass tasting key in my pocket and wrapped my fingers around it so hard the metal bit.

I didn’t pour.

The taste in the air sharpened, becoming impatient.

Then, from below the cellar stairs, came a soft sound—like a bung being nudged.

Like a mouth testing its teeth.

My tongue tasted peaches.

Fermenting peaches.

Rule 14.

I walked to the nearest mirror behind the bar.

My face looked normal.

Then I opened my mouth.

My teeth were stained red.

Not purple.

Red, like fresh wine on white enamel.

My stomach rolled.

Rule 14: rinse, spit into the floor drain.

I used the water fountain—carefully, without “pouring” from a pitcher, because I didn’t know if it counted. I swished. The water tasted faintly like oak and pennies.

I spit into the floor drain by the mop sink.

The drain gurgled.

And the gurgle sounded like satisfaction.

At 3:07 AM, the phone rang.

Rule 13.

I let it ring three times.

Picked up on the fourth.

“Foxglove Ridge,” I said, voice steady by force. “This is the night shift.”

A pause.

Then a voice—calm, friendly, too close to the ear—asked:

“What year is it?”

I swallowed. “2026.”

Another pause.

A tiny smile crept into the voice.

“No,” it said. “The *other* year.”

My skin prickled. I hung up gently.

Unplugged the phone.

For a moment, the winery was quiet.

Then the intercom crackled.

Not breathing. Not pages.

Just a single soft sentence, read with the careful diction of a sommelier.

“Product,” it said.

And somewhere below the stairs, a cork popped.

Once.

I didn’t move.

Then another cork popped.

Twice.

I grabbed the tasting key and ran—not down into the cellar, not toward the sound, but to the cellar door at the top of the stairs, the heavy one with the iron latch and the faint smell of cold wood.

I pressed my forehead to it.

“I’m sorry,” I whispered, because Rule 16 said apologize to the cellar door if you break a rule, and maybe answering the phone counted as breaking something I didn’t understand.

The door was cold as bone.

I tapped the key on the latch.

Twice.

A long moment passed.

Then, from the other side of the door, I heard the softest sound in the world:

A cork being put *back in*.

The building exhaled.

The “OPEN” sign steadied.

The temperature display stayed 55°F.

And my mouth stopped tasting peaches.

At 6:58 AM, the sky turned gray. Honest gray. Morning gray. The kind of color that doesn’t pretend.

Maris arrived at 7:02 AM with a coffee in one hand and her keys in the other.

Real.

She looked me over—my pale face, my damp hands, the way I held the tasting key like a rosary—and nodded once.

“You made it,” she said.

“I followed the rules,” I croaked.

Maris’s gaze flicked to the cellar door, then to the clipboard on the counter.

“Good,” she said. “Then it didn’t have to make you into anything.”

I stared at her. “How do you...how do you keep working here?”

Maris took a slow sip of coffee. Her eyes didn’t leave the cellar.

“You don’t,” she said softly.

“You *ferment*.”

Then she reached past me, flipped the tasting room lights on, and smiled brightly as the first day-tour bus rolled into the lot.

“Morning,” she said, like everything was normal. “Let’s open.”

Behind her, the “OPEN” sign lit itself. Perfectly. Obediently. As if it had always been waiting for someone new to wear a name tag. 

The memory of fermented peaches still danced along each bump on my tongue, seducing each nerve to convince my mind to work more. 

I lied. To both you and Reeve. I poured and tasted the delightful peach wine. It was the most raw experience. Sexual, almost. 

I need to taste the delightful, fermented peaches once more, to drown myself. To ferment alongside them.

Stay away from my wine. It's mine, always was mine. My peach wine. Mine.",1,1770746979.0,nosleep,0,0.57,False

I have recently picked up a Bambino plus and very much enjoying the whole coffee process.

However I have come to realise that my grinder is rubbish, it was some cheap thing. And it doesn't grid fine enough.

I have been looking for a replacement and after looking on here I think I have settled for the DF54, but I was just wondering if there are any alternatives that I may have missed?

TLDR

I've been with my gf for over 4 years and this is her first job. After 2 months her boss made moves on her twice. Both times it was late during the day when he said he will drive her home as she leaves. in the car he mentioned going first time for a coffee, second time for a wine date. my gf said she told him that she will only do that in the presence of his wife and children, so practically shook it off. yes, he's married with 2 kids. He knows about me, but has never met me. 

Now the second time it triggered me. yesterday she was late to get home I called her twice, and she did not pick up, but left me a message that she will call me later, and it happened the second time. when I was calling her she was with her boss.

I don't want to escalate this as she may lose her job, however I'm not okay with it at all, and would want to personally discuss it with her boss. keep in mind that this is a family business, so no HR department.

I like my life but it feels empty sometimes. I'm past the age of having kids. It's very okay if you do. The older the better, my dog gets nervous around toddlers and she piddles.  I think it's their high voices. She's been that way since she was a puppy. 

I love animals, dogs especially! I love amusement parks, swimming, dancing (years of training when I was a tyke), roller skating, drawing, playing RPGs and watching movies. I love a good potato and anything covered in cheese.

I'm in Peoria and I'd love to make a friend (maybe more) to have random lunches or dinners with. Maybe see a movie or comedy show together. Hopefully you're within an hour or two and we can meet up.

Hey r/scaleinpublic!

I built Tapfree because I always felt mobile typing feels stuck in the past. When I'm moving fast, my ideas don’t arrive as perfect sentences. They come as fragments, quick reactions, and rough thoughts I need to shape into something coherent.

Most keyboards and dictation tools don’t help much. They transcribe words literally, miss context, butcher names, and leave me fixing formatting by hand. Writing an email, a chat reply, or a document all need very different handling.

What makes Tapfree different is how it understands context. Tapfree uses on-screen context (the text field and surrounding UI), not just the app you’re in, to produce cleaner, more relevant dictation.

It also handles the way people actually talk. You say ""Could you get some coffee... sorry, tea on the way back?"" and Tapfree writes: ""Could you get some tea on the way back?"". It catches your corrections mid-sentence so you don't have to go back and fix them.

If you give it a try, I’d love specific feedback:

* Which app or scenario felt noticeably better (or worse) than usual dictation?
* Any ""wow"" moments with the context understanding?
* What would make it even more useful for you?

I have just released it on [ProductHunt](https://www.producthunt.com/posts/tapfree-for-android-2), and would love the feedback, as this is very much a side project and I’m still shaping it.

But my neighbor (younger than me) loves this and shares it at her perfume parties all the time. (See comments for a link to the scent events she throws). I never recall what it smells like, so I asked her for a sample. I wanted to buy a jumbo bottle (100 mL for $24.99 is better than 50mL for $16.99 imo). Day 1 of me not giving into impulse buy temptation. Please clap.  

It has a very pleasant citrus opening (mandarin, apple, apricot), and I get the water lily up top without it smelling aquatic. I don’t get the chocolate, guava, or tiare flower that appear in the mid, but I am impressed it has those notes. There is tuberose, but the floral I get (with all the notes combined) smells more like freesia or lilac. The base is vanilla, amber, and woods. I’m not getting a pronounced version of those. Mostly this reads as a light floral to me once the fruits fade. There is a little depth, but I couldn’t tell you why without having seen the note breakdown. 

(Not pictured, but still late 90s / 2000s nostalgia: Jessica Simpson Fancy Love, Calvin Klein CK One, CK Be Juicy Couture Dirty English, Paris Hilton Can Can, Salvatore Ferragamo Signorina).

There are two Bitter Peach (2020) impressions, by Alt and Dossier. I had Maison Al Hambra Coral Blush and destashed so I don’t think I am a bitter peach fan. Haven’t smelled the OG. 

Tahari Spiced Cashmere is a note match to Moschino Toy Boy in case you want to sniff it. Only $9.99– I almost got it out of curiosity. 

Lattafa Decadent Delights Passionfruit Macaron - mixed reviews online so I didn’t go for it. But Passionfruit is a rare and special note, so I think it would be nice to have a Passionfruit option in my stash. 

Lumen Morning at the Cafe - I have reviewed a few other Lumen scents. Accurate gourmands, weak sillage and projection, long-lasting as skin scents. Designed in the U.S. / made in China - logo and trademarks belong to “Fragrance Innovations” but no record of that company online. Espresso, oat milk, and praline. I can’t identify oat milk as a note, so unless it makes the fragrance more lactonic it is a nonsense fantasy note to me. Praline and coffee…I assume it is like your run-of-the-mill coffee gourmand. I love d’Annam Vietnamese Coffee, YSL Black Opium, Kilian Intoxicated, and dislike Demeter Coffee and Khadlaj Caffe Latte, so I can’t experiment with coffee scents. They have to come highly recommended and be complex. 

Last two scent recommendations are these bars of soap. The Porto Antigo Goat’s Milk & Fig is very green and herbaceous. Made in Portugal. SasaCasa

I wanted to design a cocktail that incorporated Apricot three different ways, hence the name ‘Three Stones’, the stones being the Apricot Pits.  I tried out a few different liqueurs and infusions, using freeze-dried and sun-dried Apricots, and almost made something out of the pits themselves, stopping short for fear of poisoning myself with cyanide.  (I still used the pits, I just left that to the professionals).

There were many tasty cocktails made and drank, and less than tasty cocktails sipped and tossed, and the few contenders that almost made the cut are in my latest mixology video here:

[Three Stones Cocktail Video](https://youtu.be/IvBhJ6IQuX8)



Three Stones

2 oz Espadin Mezcal - non-smoky

1 oz Freeze-Dried Apricot Infused Prosecco Reduction

1/2 oz Maraschino Liqueur

1/2 oz Apricot Liqueur

3/4 oz Lemon Juice

Shake the ingredients with ice and strain into a chilled coupe or Nick & Nora glass.

Top with Amaretto Foam.

Grate Lemon and Lime Peel and Frozen Sun-Dried Apricot on top.



Freeze-Dried Apricot Infused Prosecco Reduction:

Simmer a bottle of Prosecco in a saucepan over low heat until it has reduced to one cup.  Once cool, add about three or four Freeze-Dried Apricot chunks and let it sit for about 2 days before straining through coffee filter.



Amaretto Foam:

Combine five ounces of Amaretto and five ounces of a non-alcoholic syrup (I chose Coconut Syrup because the store I went to didn’t carry Amaretto Syrup) with a half gram of Xanthan Gum and quickly blend.  Add to Isi Whipper along with two Egg Whites and double charge.  Shake vigorously and chill in the fridge for a bit.



The Grated Zest hits quick with a burst of citrus as you move in for a sip, the Espadin and Maraschino form this nice base, dark and almost savory, while the Apricot comes in both sour and sweet.  There’s no line between the tartness of the Freeze-Dried Apricot and the Prosecco Reduction.

The Amaretto Foam adds another layer of complexity, increasing the aromatics, with a thick, creamy texture that rides in at the end, softening everything with velvet Amaretto and Coconut.",15,1770746344.0,cocktails,0,1.0,False

We’d been talking for a bit and everything seemed normal. They were funny, polite, and consistent in messages.

We met for coffee. At first, it was fine. Small talk, getting to know each other, nothing uncomfortable. Then the conversation shifted.

They started making comments about how people are too sensitive these days and how they enjoy pushing buttons to see how people react. They laughed while saying it, like it was charming. I felt uneasy, but I tried to give them the benefit of the doubt.

A few minutes later, they made a comment that crossed a line for me. It wasn’t aggressive, just dismissive and unnecessary. I told them it made me uncomfortable.

They shrugged and said it’s just their sense of humor and that people need thicker skin. That was the moment I knew I didn’t want to be there anymore. I finished my drink, paid for it, and told them I was going to head out. They looked shocked and asked if I was serious. I said yes.

I don’t think leaving a situation that feels wrong is immature. I think staying would’ve meant ignoring my instincts.

What is this?  
Why am I laying in grass?

Oh wow, my head is pounding, and it feels like my eyes have never seen light before.  
What the shit?

“I’m NAKED!”

My legs are covered in dried blood.  
Am I cut?  
What is happening?

“Okay, calm down.”  
Assess.  
We can do this.  
Any danger?  
Quick scan surroundings then self.

I see no movement, and I’m in an almost artificial-looking semi-tropical forest.  
There’s some water nearby, and I’m kind of at a high point. 

Okay.

My body—let’s see.  
No wounds.

I’m menstruating.

Great.

Naked, menstruating, in the woods.

What was I just doing?

Ah, it’s all so blurry.  
I can’t even think of my name right now.

Alright, let’s get to the basics:  
where am I,  
where am I going,  
and how am I going to get there?

I’d love to not be naked.  
I don’t see any supplies around though.

Let’s start with getting water, hydrating, and cleaning myself up.

Nice, a stream and a reservoir down over there.  
The light coming a bit from my right since shadows are to my left must be the sun so the water is either north or south. 

Everything is a bit dry, no morning dew, so it’s probably afternoon.  
We’ll say south for now.

Alright, let’s go, Shelby.

It takes a bit of careful walking downhill.

Only ten minutes.  
That was faster than I thought it would be.

I feel kind of weak, but also lighter than normal.  
It’s hard to explain.

Still no signs of life though, and it’s kind of freaking me out.  
Not even a twig snap here or a cricket there—like nothing.

I should have heard some kind of critter by now.  
I think I did see a bird, but I can’t be sure.

One problem at a time though.  
Let’s get rinsed off, Shelby.

After a few minutes near the water, I notice a small waterfall tucked away that I didn’t see at first.

Looks like there might be a cave back there too.

Huh…  
why did I—  
I—

Yes, I remember.

I used to go hiking with my scout troop, and we found a cool cave behind a waterfall once.

And I have been saying my name—it’s Shelby.

Oh, I am such a goof.

Still though, how did I get here?

Focus.

Rinse off, get clean, better inspect for wounds, and let’s see if there is at least life in the water.

Alright…

So a few little fish at least.

So I’m not going insane.  
That’s nice.

No wounds.  
Another win.

Let’s go.

It takes a while to dig a small hole near the water.

While I wait for it to fill with drinkable water, I look around for leaves and vines and things to make cordage.  
I just cannot be naked anymore.

By the time I finally drink, my mouth was so dry it almost hurts.

That was great.

This dirt is odd though.  
It reminds me of the artificial coffee-husk dirt used in greenhouses.

And there were no bugs or worms.

Still, there was dirt, and I got my filtered water, so I can’t complain.

Alright, let’s find some vines to make some simple cordage and at least hang a few leaves on my bits and bobs.

I don’t mind nudity, especially if it’s in art form, but I still want to be modest.  
I also just feel exposed and eechh.

Making clothes takes longer than I want it to.

My fingers fumble with vines and knots.  
I redo things more than once. Its a very different in practice I feel for some reason. I must have learned this with my scouting buddies. 

Eventually, I manage something passable.

Okay, I think these will do.

Much easier to custom-make leaves than to find perfect clothes from the mega factories, haha.  
Having decent hips and DD breasts just makes it so annoying.

It’s like they just want us to be this cookie-cutter mold and to keep consuming.

 Wait what the hell am I talking about right now?

I have such a strong opinion, but I can’t even think of a clothing brand or style or anything.  
Why is my memory so foggy?

It must have been the emotion tied to clothes bringing that out.

Gosh, what happened to me to lose my memory?

Okay, we got this.  
I am sure we have been through worse.

After I’ve caught my breath, I kneel near the water.

Maybe I should use its reflection to really look at myself.  
Try and jog something loose.

Alright, let’s see.

I have a simple button nose, slightly rounded cheeks, long light brown, almost reddish hair, and very pale skin covered in freckles. 

Nice.

I remembered my mom.

We looked very similar, and everyone talked about it.

I think I saw her recently too.  
I was going on a hike by myself.

I was calling it my “grand adventure”, and she was wishing me well, but I could tell she seemed super worried.

Oh dear, Mom.

I am so sorry.

I will make it back home.  
I promise.

I am not dead yet—just a little lost.

It will definitely be one hell of a story though.

Okay.

Still not sure how we got here, but man, what a big step.

Oh, I feel much better.

After one last look around the water, I make my way back uphill.

Back to where I woke up.

It takes a bit longer than going down but still I feel light and the walk back up is a breeze.

Let’s climb this tree and do some scouting.

It takes effort.

Almost to the top and—

Boom.

Wow.

It really is a pretty little valley.

Wait…

Hold on…

Wait, no.

I saw the sun earlier—  
where—  
no.

There is just light from over there, but no sun.

And it does look like a sky.

I see the trees stop  
and the sky come down  
to the ground.

No.

I must be hallucinating.

Some kind of optical illusion.

I can not be… In a dome? A cage? 

It almost looks like there is a passage along the ridgeline though, where the dome does not touch the ground, to the west of the waterfall area.

Okay.

Let’s head to the edge area, then follow the ridge that way.

This must just be some optical illusion of being on a mountain island, right?

My legs are shaking even as I climb down the tree what is happening haha. Come on shelby girl we got this.

Every step makes my chest feel tight and my knees weak.

I dont want to know. I dont want to see or learn what is ahead of me.

But I see it getting closer and closer as I approach the edge. 

It’s a wall.

It feels smooth, but it looks like the sky.

It’s hard to even call it a wall.

I cannot even describe the texture.

And the detail of the moving sky on it.

It’s not a screen.  
The pixel count would have to be infinite.

It’s almost like I am in a snow globe, and there is one of those magic-trick extra layers of glass on the outside, filled with something that is mimicking a sky.

Like someone is going to pour my dome over and empty out the sky magic trick and I will wake up right?

But even with that, I don’t understand how it looks like the sky.

Wait—

Are those eyes behind the sky?

“AAHHH!!!”

“NOPE!”

I don’t stop to think about it.

I turn and follow the ridge-line.

We are going to look at the “Great Passage,” as it shall be known.

This is all normal.

Being in a giant dome with a crazy sky thing with eyes behind it is normal.

This is all normal.

I’m okay.

We are in normal normal normal…

Run.

Let’s run.

Time blurs.

Focus on the step.  
My feet hitting the dirt.

The soft dirt beneath me, starting to feel more and more like a trail.

Yep.

Totally normal.

I see smoke!

There is smoke on the other side of the “Great Passage.”

There must be other people.

“Yes.”

okay , focus on some dopamine till we get there lets just get some runners high. 

I’m saved.

Thank goodness.

The passage, as I’m going through, does seem to be an arch connecting two domes together.

All normal, Shelby.

Focus on the smoke and your running.

We are alive.

There must be another human.

Focus.

Okay.

I am within one hundred yards of the fire.

Should I start yelling,  
or approach slowly  
and scope it out first  
to make sure it’s safe?

At this point… we ball.

When you order coffee at your favorite café, you don’t walk up, grunt “Coffee,” and then reveal the rest of your order one plot twist at a time. You say the whole thing. Up front. Like a functioning human.



So why does that skill evaporate at 35,000 feet?

You say “Coffee, black,” I hand you black coffee, and suddenly it’s *“Oh, I wanted cream.”* Fine. Here’s cream. Then it’s *“Sugar too.”* At this point I’m basically building your drink like an IKEA end table.

And the best part? The person next to you watches this entire exchange in real time… and then does the exact same thing. FFS, don’t be that person.

Just order the drink — the whole drink — the first time.  

Examples for the visually impaired:

\- “Coffee, black.”  

\- “Coffee with cream and two sugars.”  

\- “Can of Coke, no ice, no cup.”  

\- “OJ, no ice.”  

It’s not advanced aviation theory.

And one last thing: on UK flights, when someone asks if you want your tea or coffee “white or black,” please don’t look like they just asked you to solve a riddle. “White” means with milk. If you already planned on adding milk… congratulations, you want it white.",20,1770745987.0,flightattendants,14,0.92,False

Pain is worse after eating (sometimes starts 1–2 hours after meals)
Better when stomach is empty
Vomited 3 times + diarrhea
Now the pain feels sharper, and even light foods like porridge can trigger it

In your experience, should we go to a hospital ER (public/university) or is a primary care clinic enough for this? Any recommendations near Lat Phrao that are reliable and not overly expensive? Also, any red flags we should watch for?

I built Tapfree because I always felt mobile typing feels stuck in the past. When I'm moving fast, my ideas don’t arrive as perfect sentences. They come as fragments, quick reactions, and rough thoughts I need to shape into something coherent.



Most keyboards and dictation tools don’t help much. They transcribe words literally, miss context, butcher names, and leave me fixing formatting by hand. Writing an email, a chat reply, or a document all need very different handling.



What makes Tapfree different is how it understands context. Tapfree uses on-screen context (the text field and surrounding UI), not just the app you’re in, to produce cleaner, more relevant dictation.



It also handles the way people actually talk. You say ""Could you get some coffee... sorry, tea on the way back?"" and Tapfree writes: ""Could you get some tea on the way back?"". It catches your corrections mid-sentence so you don't have to go back and fix them.



If you give it a try, I’d love specific feedback:

* Which app or scenario felt noticeably better (or worse) than usual dictation?
* Any ""wow"" moments with the context understanding?
* What would make it even more useful for you?



I have just released it on [ProductHunt](https://www.producthunt.com/posts/tapfree-for-android-2), and would love the feedback, as this is very much a side project and I’m still shaping it.

St Mary's Woolnorth, London.","My fortnightly trip to London for medical treatment meant another visit to one of the numerous Wren churches situated within hobbling distance of the clinic.

St Mary's Woolnorth is an archetypal Wren church (aren't they all) but with a slightly more obviously baroque influence to the ceiling mouldings, capitals and so forth. It is currently in the hands of a low-church bunch called Imprint (they are CoE, I checked) and they have done a grand job of adapting it to their use without spoiling the historical character, most notably by installing a tiny but lively coffee bar in the narthex and providing seating just out front. This traditionalist approves!

Almost all these churches have some particular feature of interest, and here it is the memorial to John Newton, one time rector of this parish and composer (technically lyricist) of the hymn ""Amazing Grace"". It isn't actually one that gets sung anywhere I have worshipped (although I love Aretha Franklin's version) and although I knew it had connections to slavery I had always assumed it was a spiritual of African-American origins. How wrong I was...

Newton's epitaph (see photo), which he penned himself, gives you an indication of his story - a slaver who was himself enslaved and eventually turned abolitionist.

A look through his [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Newton) entry is worth the time spent on it. It isn't exactly comfortable reading, but we need to face up to these unpalatable aspects of our past and stories like Newton's are part of that.

Note: I don't expect a lot of responses to this. It is a difficult subject and I am sure many of you already knew all about Newton. I did not. I thought it was worth sharing something that has given me much food for thought today, and may perhaps do likewise for others. 

Certainly, I will never hear ""Amazing Grace"" in quite the same way again.

\~\~Hazel\~\~

“What we had was never serious.”

My boyfriend says the words so casually as he sits in a chair across from me. “I won’t have you pretend it was. I’m getting married to someone else, and that’s final.”

I can’t move. I can’t breathe. I stare, waiting for an indication that he’s joking, that this is a prank. None comes. Noel keeps stirring his coffee, eyes on his cup as if I’m invinsible.

“What we had was never serious?” I repeat under my breath. The words ring in my head over and over. The tiny cafe bubbles around us, yet the only thing I hear is the pounding in my ears. “What is that supposed to mean?” I croak. It’s the first time I’m speaking since he dropped a bombshell about his engagement minutes ago.

“You don’t need me to spell it out, Hazel.”

“I.. I do,” I stutter. “I need to understand why you’re throwing what we have away without a care in the world.”

He leans back in his chair, his face contorted with something that looks like mild disgust. I sink my teeth into my lower lip as his next words hit me. “You knew we were just having fun. Don’t make this harder than it’s supposed to be.”

“Fun? We’ve been in a relationship for three years, and you think we were having fun?”

He scoffs, brows arched in amusement. “I’m finding it hard to understand why you think a man of my caliber should stoop so low to be your endgame when I can have any woman I desire. You work in PR, you understand image.”

Translation: Being with you will put a stain on my name.

Aah! It’s clear to me now. There it is, everything that has caused me to worry since I started dating someone way out of my league. I knew being with a man so high up the ladder like him was trouble, yet I went ahead with it. Everyone who knew about our relationship always found it hard to understand why Noel was dating a plain nine to five worker with no money and connections. I always thought it didn’t matter. He loved me and that was the only important thing. Who could have thought that he had also been looking down on me too, planning a wedding with a woman of his ‘caliber’?

“Look.” He leans forward, pushing his untouched drink to the side. “You saw this coming, Hazel. You can’t measure up to Violeta. She’s the perfect woman for me. She was born into my world, understands my challenges.” He pauses, running his hand over the sleeves of his designer shirt that cost the same as a quarter of my annual salary. “And most importantly, she’s from a family that matters.”

My fingers curl into my palms. I meet his eyes, feeling tears rapidly rush to mine. “I sacrificed a lot for you, Noel,” I say quietly. “I did things I can never forgive myself for, just because you asked me to. You can’t do this to me now.”

Noel rolls his eyes with an air of boredom. “Is this about the abortion?”

My chest tightens. I stopped life from coming into this world because he wasn’t ready for a family. He has no right to downplay what I went through like this. The guilt still eats at me everyday, but he’s not affected in any way.

“It’s not just the abortion.”

“Pray, tell, Hazel. What else did you do for me?”

My hands ball into fists. My teeth grit together. A bitter rumble starts in my guts. How is he so effortlessly cruel? “You stopped me from leaving when I got that position in Switzerland. You said you didn’t want to be in a long distance relationship. I chose you over my career.” I shake my head in pain. “You can’t abandon me now.”

“That was your decision.” His words cut through me. He flashes me an irritated glare, tapping the table absently, as if he can’t wait to leave. “Come on, Hazel. Don’t make it sound like I forced you to do those things.”

I bite down on my lower lip, blinking hard in an attempt to hide the tears forming behind my lids. It’s hard to believe that the man I’ve grown to love and trust over the years is the same person saying these words to me.

Suddenly, it hits me. The truth I have ignored all this while.

“Did you ask me to kill our child because I’m not a woman of your ‘caliber’?” I make air quotes around the last word.

“Our child?” Noel snickers. “You never even let that thing reach a month in your womb?”

Thing? My jaw hangs open. Noel continues with a nonchalant shrug. “And yes, you’re right. How on earth was I supposed to take you to my parents and tell them you were going to give them their first grandchild? Have you looked at yourself, Hazel?” He gave me a rude onceover. “It will be an insult to make you the mother of my kids. You should have known that things would come to an end when I asked to abort that pregnancy.”

Blood roars in my ears. I place my shaky hands on my laps, feeling my stomach twist violently. I can’t even think of anything else to say to him. He has done all the damage he needs to do to make me hate him forever.

“You’re strong,” he mutters, taking a sip of his drink. “You’ll get over this.”

Noel rises to his feet. A few dollar bills land on the table, followed by his condescending tone. “Take this for the coffee. I’m getting married in two weeks. I’ll appreciate it if you can forget all about me, because I’ll do the same.”

With that, he’s making his way to the door, the heels of his shoes clicking against the tiles.

For a second too long, I sit there, gazing at the empty chair he left behind as his statement replays in my head. Fun. That was all he saw me as. Nothing but a mistake he could fix by marrying someone richer. I should run after him and curse him out. Throw hot coffee in his face. But I stay glued to my seat instead.

When Noel texted earlier to request a date, I’d been elated, dashing out of my office at the start of my lunch break to meet him. It was the first time we were seeing each other after a week of being ‘swamped with work’ according to him. If I had known I’d be slammed with a breakup, I’d have saved myself the excitement.

Now, sitting here torn apart by his words, I can’t help but wonder why I didn’t see this coming.

An alarm blares through my phone, jolting me back to the present. Taking a deep breath, I wipe the tears from my eyes and grab my bag, making my way out of the cafe. I can already see myself getting wasted tonight, but my main purpose for now is to get through the rest of my work day. Starline Entertainment is only a stone throw from the cafe. By the time I reach the office, I’ve fixed a plastic smile in place, ready to go through the day like I didn’t just get dumped by my boyfriend.

“Hazel.” My boss’s sharp voice rings through the air as soon as I walk into the large office I share with the rest of my colleagues. Zoey’s shooting me an impatient glare through the transparent walls separating her office from ours. “Where’s the pitch deck I requested earlier?”

“I’m on it,” I rush to my table, pushing all thoughts of Noel to the back of my mind as I turn on my computer.

“Five minutes,” she mouths sternly. “And you have to look a little less miserable at work. There’s a job for you.”

I sink into the chair in my cubicle just as a chair scrapes against the floor to join mine. In it is Kimberly, the office gossip and the closest thing I have to a work friend. Judging by the excited gleam in her eyes, I can tell she has new tea she’s eager to spill. “Did you hear?” she asks, leaning over the partition.

“No, Kim. And if you’re not bearing news about a raise, I’m not interested.”

“We have a new CEO,” she says anyway. “Don’t tell me you didn’t hear about him. The whole agency is going crazy because of him.”

I have more pressing issues to worry about, like getting this deck to Zoey before she flares up in anger, and crying myself to sleep while going through photos of Noel and I. I couldn’t care less about a CEO who would only be seen by foot soldiers like us once in a year. “No, I didn’t.”

She throws a mint candy into her mouth with an eyeroll. “Apparently, he’s a looker.”

“Don’t you have a boyfriend? You shouldn’t be praising another man’s looks when you’re in a relationship.” I don’t know if it’s because I just discovered that my boyfriend of three years has been cheating on me, but my voice is laced with mild irritation. Kimberly scoffs, going back to her desk.

“He’s broke. A girl can dream of ending up with a good looking man who has good looks to pass down to her kids.”

I turn away from her, grabbing freshly printed pages from a whirring printer and running them through a binder. I can see Kimberly’s concerned gaze on me as I pad over to Zoey’s office without a word. My boss is seated behind a large mahogany desk, her eyes on her monitor as she swivels in her chair. I straighten my blazer and place the file on her desk. Wiping a smudge of lipstick off the corner of her lips, she regards me with a tight expression.

“You handled the PureGlitz perfume launch last month?”

“Yes,” I say warily, because even though I put my all into making the launch as successful as possible, Zoey is hard to please, there’s a possibility that I didn’t meet her expectations.

“It was great. The client was thrilled.”

“Oh!” I exhale, then on second thoughts, I add. “Thank you.” I didn’t expect that.

“That’s why I have chosen you for a high profile assignment. There’s a big wedding coming up, and we’ve been hired to cover it. The clients are conglomerates. We’re talking destination wedding, a week-long trip with friends and family to the Caribbean which you have to cover.”

“Me?”

With a nod, she narrows her eyes at me, as if she’s trying to figure out if I’m really the right person for the job. “I sent you the client’s file. Go over it today. You’ll have a protographer assigned to you. This is a last minute assignment, so pack your bags, you are to leave in two days.”

I have handled events for minor clients, but nothing on this scale. If these people are willing to go on a trip just to celebrate a wedding, it means this is one of the biggest gigs the agency has gotten this year. I shift my weight from foot to foot, waiting for her to say anything else, but she has turned her focus back to her laptop, scrolling away as if I’m not in the office.

“Do not embarrass us,” Zoey says just as I turn to leave. “A review of your performance will be sent to the new CEO when he arrives next week. If you want to get considered for a promotion, impress him.”

That’s all the motivation I need. I give her a brief bow and scurry out of the office. In an instant, I’m back at my desk in full work mode, going through the file she sent to me. I have such little time to prepare for something so important. I can’t afford to make mistakes.

Then, I catch it. The names of the bride and groom. A knot forms in my stomach as I skim through the words.

My local setup (single 3070) is fine for 8B models, but it chokes hard on anything substantial unless I quantize it down to brain-damaged levels.  
  
I decided to experiment with a ""Remote Backend"" setup - keeping my SillyTavern/Ollama frontend local but offloading the heavy lifting to a cloud instance. The goal was to find a cheap gpu vps that offers full passthrough, not that vGPU slicing where you share VRAM bandwidth with noisy neighbors.  
  
I ended up testing a dedicated T4 slice on Lumadock this week to see if 16GB VRAM + system RAM offloading (or just smarter splitting) is actually usable for chat.  
  
To be honest, I expected it to be painfully slow. But running 4.0bpw EXL2 quants, I’m getting surprisingly consistent tokens/sec. It’s definitely not instant like a 4090, but for the price of a few coffees a month, it feels like a decent stopgap until consumer hardware catches up.

\~\~Hazel\~\~

“What we had was never serious.”

My boyfriend says the words so casually as he sits in a chair across from me. “I won’t have you pretend it was. I’m getting married to someone else, and that’s final.”

I can’t move. I can’t breathe. I stare, waiting for an indication that he’s joking, that this is a prank. None comes. Noel keeps stirring his coffee, eyes on his cup as if I’m invinsible.

“What we had was never serious?” I repeat under my breath. The words ring in my head over and over. The tiny cafe bubbles around us, yet the only thing I hear is the pounding in my ears. “What is that supposed to mean?” I croak. It’s the first time I’m speaking since he dropped a bombshell about his engagement minutes ago.

“You don’t need me to spell it out, Hazel.”

“I.. I do,” I stutter. “I need to understand why you’re throwing what we have away without a care in the world.”

He leans back in his chair, his face contorted with something that looks like mild disgust. I sink my teeth into my lower lip as his next words hit me. “You knew we were just having fun. Don’t make this harder than it’s supposed to be.”

“Fun? We’ve been in a relationship for three years, and you think we were having fun?”

He scoffs, brows arched in amusement. “I’m finding it hard to understand why you think a man of my caliber should stoop so low to be your endgame when I can have any woman I desire. You work in PR, you understand image.”

Translation: Being with you will put a stain on my name.

Aah! It’s clear to me now. There it is, everything that has caused me to worry since I started dating someone way out of my league. I knew being with a man so high up the ladder like him was trouble, yet I went ahead with it. Everyone who knew about our relationship always found it hard to understand why Noel was dating a plain nine to five worker with no money and connections. I always thought it didn’t matter. He loved me and that was the only important thing. Who could have thought that he had also been looking down on me too, planning a wedding with a woman of his ‘caliber’?

“Look.” He leans forward, pushing his untouched drink to the side. “You saw this coming, Hazel. You can’t measure up to Violeta. She’s the perfect woman for me. She was born into my world, understands my challenges.” He pauses, running his hand over the sleeves of his designer shirt that cost the same as a quarter of my annual salary. “And most importantly, she’s from a family that matters.”

My fingers curl into my palms. I meet his eyes, feeling tears rapidly rush to mine. “I sacrificed a lot for you, Noel,” I say quietly. “I did things I can never forgive myself for, just because you asked me to. You can’t do this to me now.”

Noel rolls his eyes with an air of boredom. “Is this about the abortion?”

My chest tightens. I stopped life from coming into this world because he wasn’t ready for a family. He has no right to downplay what I went through like this. The guilt still eats at me everyday, but he’s not affected in any way.

“It’s not just the abortion.”

“Pray, tell, Hazel. What else did you do for me?”

My hands ball into fists. My teeth grit together. A bitter rumble starts in my guts. How is he so effortlessly cruel? “You stopped me from leaving when I got that position in Switzerland. You said you didn’t want to be in a long distance relationship. I chose you over my career.” I shake my head in pain. “You can’t abandon me now.”

“That was your decision.” His words cut through me. He flashes me an irritated glare, tapping the table absently, as if he can’t wait to leave. “Come on, Hazel. Don’t make it sound like I forced you to do those things.”

I bite down on my lower lip, blinking hard in an attempt to hide the tears forming behind my lids. It’s hard to believe that the man I’ve grown to love and trust over the years is the same person saying these words to me.

Suddenly, it hits me. The truth I have ignored all this while.

“Did you ask me to kill our child because I’m not a woman of your ‘caliber’?” I make air quotes around the last word.

“Our child?” Noel snickers. “You never even let that thing reach a month in your womb?”

Thing? My jaw hangs open. Noel continues with a nonchalant shrug. “And yes, you’re right. How on earth was I supposed to take you to my parents and tell them you were going to give them their first grandchild? Have you looked at yourself, Hazel?” He gave me a rude onceover. “It will be an insult to make you the mother of my kids. You should have known that things would come to an end when I asked to abort that pregnancy.”

Blood roars in my ears. I place my shaky hands on my laps, feeling my stomach twist violently. I can’t even think of anything else to say to him. He has done all the damage he needs to do to make me hate him forever.

“You’re strong,” he mutters, taking a sip of his drink. “You’ll get over this.”

Noel rises to his feet. A few dollar bills land on the table, followed by his condescending tone. “Take this for the coffee. I’m getting married in two weeks. I’ll appreciate it if you can forget all about me, because I’ll do the same.”

With that, he’s making his way to the door, the heels of his shoes clicking against the tiles.

For a second too long, I sit there, gazing at the empty chair he left behind as his statement replays in my head. Fun. That was all he saw me as. Nothing but a mistake he could fix by marrying someone richer. I should run after him and curse him out. Throw hot coffee in his face. But I stay glued to my seat instead.

When Noel texted earlier to request a date, I’d been elated, dashing out of my office at the start of my lunch break to meet him. It was the first time we were seeing each other after a week of being ‘swamped with work’ according to him. If I had known I’d be slammed with a breakup, I’d have saved myself the excitement.

Now, sitting here torn apart by his words, I can’t help but wonder why I didn’t see this coming.

An alarm blares through my phone, jolting me back to the present. Taking a deep breath, I wipe the tears from my eyes and grab my bag, making my way out of the cafe. I can already see myself getting wasted tonight, but my main purpose for now is to get through the rest of my work day. Starline Entertainment is only a stone throw from the cafe. By the time I reach the office, I’ve fixed a plastic smile in place, ready to go through the day like I didn’t just get dumped by my boyfriend.

“Hazel.” My boss’s sharp voice rings through the air as soon as I walk into the large office I share with the rest of my colleagues. Zoey’s shooting me an impatient glare through the transparent walls separating her office from ours. “Where’s the pitch deck I requested earlier?”

“I’m on it,” I rush to my table, pushing all thoughts of Noel to the back of my mind as I turn on my computer.

“Five minutes,” she mouths sternly. “And you have to look a little less miserable at work. There’s a job for you.”

I sink into the chair in my cubicle just as a chair scrapes against the floor to join mine. In it is Kimberly, the office gossip and the closest thing I have to a work friend. Judging by the excited gleam in her eyes, I can tell she has new tea she’s eager to spill. “Did you hear?” she asks, leaning over the partition.

“No, Kim. And if you’re not bearing news about a raise, I’m not interested.”

“We have a new CEO,” she says anyway. “Don’t tell me you didn’t hear about him. The whole agency is going crazy because of him.”

I have more pressing issues to worry about, like getting this deck to Zoey before she flares up in anger, and crying myself to sleep while going through photos of Noel and I. I couldn’t care less about a CEO who would only be seen by foot soldiers like us once in a year. “No, I didn’t.”

She throws a mint candy into her mouth with an eyeroll. “Apparently, he’s a looker.”

“Don’t you have a boyfriend? You shouldn’t be praising another man’s looks when you’re in a relationship.” I don’t know if it’s because I just discovered that my boyfriend of three years has been cheating on me, but my voice is laced with mild irritation. Kimberly scoffs, going back to her desk.

“He’s broke. A girl can dream of ending up with a good looking man who has good looks to pass down to her kids.”

I turn away from her, grabbing freshly printed pages from a whirring printer and running them through a binder. I can see Kimberly’s concerned gaze on me as I pad over to Zoey’s office without a word. My boss is seated behind a large mahogany desk, her eyes on her monitor as she swivels in her chair. I straighten my blazer and place the file on her desk. Wiping a smudge of lipstick off the corner of her lips, she regards me with a tight expression.

“You handled the PureGlitz perfume launch last month?”

“Yes,” I say warily, because even though I put my all into making the launch as successful as possible, Zoey is hard to please, there’s a possibility that I didn’t meet her expectations.

“It was great. The client was thrilled.”

“Oh!” I exhale, then on second thoughts, I add. “Thank you.” I didn’t expect that.

“That’s why I have chosen you for a high profile assignment. There’s a big wedding coming up, and we’ve been hired to cover it. The clients are conglomerates. We’re talking destination wedding, a week-long trip with friends and family to the Caribbean which you have to cover.”

“Me?”

With a nod, she narrows her eyes at me, as if she’s trying to figure out if I’m really the right person for the job. “I sent you the client’s file. Go over it today. You’ll have a protographer assigned to you. This is a last minute assignment, so pack your bags, you are to leave in two days.”

For a second too long, I sit there, gazing at the empty chair he left behind as his statement replays in my head. Fun. That was all he saw me as. Nothing but a mistake he could fix by marrying someone richer. I should run after him and curse him out. Throw hot coffee in his face. But I stay glued to my seat instead.

When Noel texted earlier to request a date, I’d been elated, dashing out of my office at the start of my lunch break to meet him. It was the first time we were seeing each other after a week of being ‘swamped with work’ according to him. If I had known I’d be slammed with a breakup, I’d have saved myself the excitement.

Now, sitting here torn apart by his words, I can’t help but wonder why I didn’t see this coming.

An alarm blares through my phone, jolting me back to the present. Taking a deep breath, I wipe the tears from my eyes and grab my bag, making my way out of the cafe. I can already see myself getting wasted tonight, but my main purpose for now is to get through the rest of my work day. Starline Entertainment is only a stone throw from the cafe. By the time I reach the office, I’ve fixed a plastic smile in place, ready to go through the day like I didn’t just get dumped by my boyfriend.

“Hazel.” My boss’s sharp voice rings through the air as soon as I walk into the large office I share with the rest of my colleagues. Zoey’s shooting me an impatient glare through the transparent walls separating her office from ours. “Where’s the pitch deck I requested earlier?”

“I’m on it,” I rush to my table, pushing all thoughts of Noel to the back of my mind as I turn on my computer.

“Five minutes,” she mouths sternly. “And you have to look a little less miserable at work. There’s a job for you.”

I sink into the chair in my cubicle just as a chair scrapes against the floor to join mine. In it is Kimberly, the office gossip and the closest thing I have to a work friend. Judging by the excited gleam in her eyes, I can tell she has new tea she’s eager to spill. “Did you hear?” she asks, leaning over the partition.

“No, Kim. And if you’re not bearing news about a raise, I’m not interested.”

“We have a new CEO,” she says anyway. “Don’t tell me you didn’t hear about him. The whole agency is going crazy because of him.”

I have more pressing issues to worry about, like getting this deck to Zoey before she flares up in anger, and crying myself to sleep while going through photos of Noel and I. I couldn’t care less about a CEO who would only be seen by foot soldiers like us once in a year. “No, I didn’t.”

She throws a mint candy into her mouth with an eyeroll. “Apparently, he’s a looker.”

“Don’t you have a boyfriend? You shouldn’t be praising another man’s looks when you’re in a relationship.” I don’t know if it’s because I just discovered that my boyfriend of three years has been cheating on me, but my voice is laced with mild irritation. Kimberly scoffs, going back to her desk.

“He’s broke. A girl can dream of ending up with a good looking man who has good looks to pass down to her kids.”

I turn away from her, grabbing freshly printed pages from a whirring printer and running them through a binder. I can see Kimberly’s concerned gaze on me as I pad over to Zoey’s office without a word. My boss is seated behind a large mahogany desk, her eyes on her monitor as she swivels in her chair. I straighten my blazer and place the file on her desk. Wiping a smudge of lipstick off the corner of her lips, she regards me with a tight expression.

“You handled the PureGlitz perfume launch last month?”

“Yes,” I say warily, because even though I put my all into making the launch as successful as possible, Zoey is hard to please, there’s a possibility that I didn’t meet her expectations.

“It was great. The client was thrilled.”

“Oh!” I exhale, then on second thoughts, I add. “Thank you.” I didn’t expect that.

“That’s why I have chosen you for a high profile assignment. There’s a big wedding coming up, and we’ve been hired to cover it. The clients are conglomerates. We’re talking destination wedding, a week-long trip with friends and family to the Caribbean which you have to cover.”

“Me?”

With a nod, she narrows her eyes at me, as if she’s trying to figure out if I’m really the right person for the job. “I sent you the client’s file. Go over it today. You’ll have a protographer assigned to you. This is a last minute assignment, so pack your bags, you are to leave in two days.”

I have handled events for minor clients, but nothing on this scale. If these people are willing to go on a trip just to celebrate a wedding, it means this is one of the biggest gigs the agency has gotten this year. I shift my weight from foot to foot, waiting for her to say anything else, but she has turned her focus back to her laptop, scrolling away as if I’m not in the office.

“Do not embarrass us,” Zoey says just as I turn to leave. “A review of your performance will be sent to the new CEO when he arrives next week. If you want to get considered for a promotion, impress him.”

That’s all the motivation I need. I give her a brief bow and scurry out of the office. In an instant, I’m back at my desk in full work mode, going through the file she sent to me. I have such little time to prepare for something so important. I can’t afford to make mistakes.

Then, I catch it. The names of the bride and groom. A knot forms in my stomach as I skim through the words.

If you’re in Pune and don’t have any plans for Valentine’s Day, maybe we can make one. Nothing awkward or intense just good conversation, coffee, maybe a walk or a stand-up show if that’s your vibe.

I’m 37, live in London, hoping to meet someone I actually enjoy talking to.

A few things about me:

* I’m into photography, mostly wandering around with a camera and noticing things (you can peek at my Flickr if you’re curious: [https://www.flickr.com/photos/piersmathias/](https://www.flickr.com/photos/piersmathias/))
* I read a lot: history (currently very Europe-focused), John le Carré when I want something atmospheric, and at the moment *The Sum of Us* by Heather McGhee,
* Also I have travelled quite a bit recently, Spain, Denmark, NYC/Boston, Germany

I like conversations that wander a bit — books that stay with you, cities you’ve loved or disliked

Looking to meet someone kind, curious, and capable of a decent chat — whether that turns into a swim buddy, museum wandering, coffee dates, or something more is open-ended and human.

If any of that sounds like your wavelength, say hello.",1,1770745365.0,MeetNewPeopleHere,0,1.0,False

1r17hj8,https://www.reddit.com/r/medicalschool/comments/1r17hj8/some_tips_from_an_attending_on_how_to_succeed_on/,Some tips from an attending on how to succeed on clinical rotations,"I'm a Maternal-Fetal Medicine attending, I've worked with hundreds of medical students. These are the things I wish med students knew going into their clinical rotations:

* Presentations are stories: you are trying to make an argument. Your entire presentation should be a journey toward convincing someone about your final assessment. Every part of the subjective and the objective should complement and lead up to the Assessment and Plan. Think [Chekhov's gun](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chekhov%27s_gun): if you mention a ""gun' in your first act it should be relevant at the end. Obviously as the medical student you are going to list everything (particularly at first), but high-performing medical students understand that the most important part of the presentation is the assessment/plan, so you are scattering breadcrumbs and leaving signposts as you go. So if in the subjective you tell me the patient had some pain overnight, the team is going to be listening to hear if there is enough reason to go back to the operating room for a takeback. But let's say your assessment is that this patient is just having normal postoperative pain, therefore you're going to place extra stress on the normal vitals (""heart rate in the 100s when she was in pain, but improved with the oxy""), the appropriate ins and outs (""put out a total of 1.2L, so greater than 30cc/hr""), and reassuring labs (""hgb was 12.1 this morning, down from 12.8 following her 450cc blood loss during the case""). By the time we reach the assessment and plan, you have mollified me into trusting you when you say, ""Mr Johnson was having pain overnight, but it seems like routine postoperative pain based on his vitals, physical exam and lab findings"". So report everything, but show that you aren't just regurgitating information, you understand why each of these findings is relevant. This gets easier and easier. 
* Perform your ""one-liner"" (your intro for the patient) from memory, and then use your notes as a script: ""Okay this is Mr. Johnson, he's a 54 year old male with a history of acute cholecystitis now postoperative day 1 from an uncomplicated laparoscopic cholecystectomy"". Make eye contact with your attending/resident/chief when you do this. Not only will this force you to know the patient better, it proves to everyone you are fully engaged with this patient, that you took the time to memorize who they are. It also kind of shocks everyone into listening to you. 
* Learn who everyone is in the patient's room (write down reminders to yourself, lady with the red shirt=Peggy, etc). If it feels right, you can introduce everyone in the room (""This is Peggy, Mr Johnson's wife, this is Rachel his daughter who lives in California""). This is kind of a sub-I move.
* Prep a little bit of clinical knowledge on your first day. You don't need to know everything, but know the basics (eg, on L&D, know how to read a fetal heart tracing). 
* On surgical rotations, the night before read the attending/resident's operative report templates before the surgery in question (in Epic, you can look them up and search for it). Read a few different temaples if you have time and look up any anatomy you come across in the templates. 
* Practice your presentations on rounds at least once before. Your first time doing it should not be on rounds. If the residents aren't too busy, ask them if you can do it with them first. Otherwise ask your classmate. Otherwise do it on your own. 
* Try to convey early on to the team you're working with where you are in your rotation. ""Hi, Dr. Harrisburg, I'm Medstud, I'm with you in clinic today. We just came off our surgery block and it's actually only my second day of OB."" etc. This avoids confusion and lets me know kind what I should expect from you before you make a first impression.
* Be humble. Admit mistakes. Don't ever lie.  
* If it's the mid-afternoon and you've done a little studying, go round again on your patients. Make sure I know where you've gone, say something like, ""Dr. Harrisburg, is it okay if I just go check up on Mr. Johnson? I want to make sure his pain's a little better."" Take ownership of your patients.
* Don't try to be cunning, don't try to play the game, don't be a gunner. You are not being clever, we were all med students once, we know how it works. 
* It's always tough to know when to ask questions--you want to appear engaged but you don't want to be annoying. The best ways to do this are: ask questions as you walk between rooms on rounds, in the elevator, on the stairwell between floors. Don't ask questions during a difficult part of the surgery, or in front of the patient. I love it if you come with several questions at once and you rope in your fellow co-students: ""Dr. Harrisburg, do you have time to explain labor induction? We just can't understand when we should use misoprostol versus Pitocin...""
* Don't ever, ever talk shit about patients. If you hear residents talking shit about a patient, about other clinicians, etc, don't join in. They shouldn't be doing it, and you know that, but they are even more tired and overworked than you are. Ignore it and move on. 
* Don't lie when asked ""what are you going into?"". If you have made your mind up, be open about that. If you're worried that you won't be called in to see interesting things if your future is discordant with your current rotation, you can add, ""I'm hoping to match into orthopedic surgery. But obviously I really want to learn as much about pediatrics/family medicine/psych while I'm here, as this might be my last chance to take care of these patients"" etc. 
* Just be on time, or even better, be early. I know, I know, this is a dumb one, but being late is literally the #1 thing grumpy residents/attendings will remember about you. You will have trouble with parking, you will be unable to find the clinic work room, you won't be able to log in...*so just arrive 30 minutes early*. Worst case scenario, you sit and do UWorld for 15 minutes before everyone shows up. If you stroll in 20 minutes late halfway through signout with a coffee, you're going to have an uphill battle before the day has even started. If you are late, address it with the resident/attending: ""Dr. Harrisburg, I am so so sorry I came in late. Honestly, I just completely slept through my alarm, no excuse, but I promise it will not happen again."" 
* Please please please ask the students on the rotation before you what tips they have. Ask them for dot phrases, ask them what the clinical context is, ask them how to find the OR schedule. Ask them if they know who the resident is. Ask them where to find the board room. After x weeks on service, they will be the experts, debrief with them.
* If you want an eval, please ask/tell me you are going to send me one. ""Dr. Harrisburg, I know we only worked together for one clinic, but could I send you an eval this afternoon?"" I will make a mental note of who you are. Also, if you have the luxury of multiple potential evaluators, be selective about who you pick.
* Sub-Is: ask for feedback at the end of each week. Come prepared with a list of things you think you are doing well and not so well. Find a 10 minute window to talk to your resident/attending about these things.
* It's nice when you get along well with your classmates. If you are gunning against them it is obvious. If you are supportive of them (waiting to go to lunch together, teaching them things you just learned, etc) we notice. 
* If you are an introverted or quiet person, acknowledge this and make an effort once a day to engage with an attending/resident with a question, with an observation. If you are an extroverted or loud person, acknowledge this and how this might disrupt a well-oiled clinical machine or how you might overwhelm the quieter students on service--elevate your peers, be professional, hold your questions until an appropriate moment.
* If an attending assigns you a little presentation, please please do it. And please please remind us the next day, ""Dr. Harrisburg, yesterday we talked about postoperative fevers and you asked me to prepare something, I have like a 3 minute presentation if we get a sec today.""

Being a resident is obviously tough, but being a medical student is tough in its own way. You feel like you are under surveillance all the time. You don't know much, but even worse, you don't know what you don't know! As much as you can, be kind to yourself. Every doctor went through the same thing as you, and they (hopefully) should have empathy for you. Be humble, trust the process. ",62,1770745337.0,medicalschool,10,0.94,False

1r17fq4,https://www.reddit.com/r/lesbianr4r/comments/1r17fq4/34f_europeanywhere_futile_devices/,34F Europe/Anywhere - Futile Devices,"Hello. I live in germany and connecting with people is maybe my favorite thing. I'm afraid I'm not your typical german. There are (a lot of) times I feel like I don't belong here. I don't know if it's because of the way I am or.. something else.

I find it hard to connect. I can talk to anyone, make friends and do things but truly connecting with someone is different. I want to understand how they function, what makes them smile, sad or angry. I want to understand how they view the world.

There are times I feel like I don't belong in this world because of the way I am. I have always had to adapt but deep down I'm a silly weird puppy. I yap a lot and when I get excited, I really get excited. I also like to be kind and want to help whenever I can. Standing up for people is very important to me because I didn't have that as a child, so of course I will want to do that.

Emotional intelligence is very important to me. It's something I'm constantly working on because I do not want to harm people with my pain.

I long to belong. It's hard for me to describe. I mean the things I say and I'm very loyal. I want to sit in silence and be okay with that. I want silence full of beauty and vulnerability. Vulnerability is so incredibly important to me, so is growth. I find growing to be painful but it is necessary and I need it.

I really need to grow. I'm not the type to stay comfortable all my life.

There are times in life in which I feel aimless, lost and then there are times I feel peaceful and know that tomorrow is a new day. I want to talk, share my experiences, share my pain and the things I want in life. I simply want to live to the fullest, with all the pain I have in me, all the laughter and the random thoughts. I want to share all of it. If more happens, I won't say no.

Seeing my partner shine and do better makes me happy. I want to be vulnerable and experience everything so deeply and fully. I want it all. Some people want a lot of money or career. For me, it's connecting. It has always been that way and I don't mind it. Maybe because it's so hard to connect. I want to get under someone's skin and I offer the same - with all the love and fear I have in me.

I'm very accepting and do not like to judge. Some get surprised how accepting I am. It takes courage to open up and I want to welcome it.

The boring things: I'm WEIRD. I like coffee quite a lot. I do a pour over every morning. I started crochet and painting abstract, cycling, knife painting, reading classics in coffee shops. I like doing different things. I'm kinky and like to experiment. I also have a high libido. Sexually, I'm quite flexible when it comes to roles. I have never been with someone who is masc, so I would love to experience that too. Go through my hair, lightly scratch my neck and I'm all yours.

I also like to move my body and enjoy nature, traveling and so much more. I'm open to a lot of things. Trying new things can be quite humbling and I like that. I can be introverted and switch to extroversion real quick - it depends. Watching movies/tv series is also nice.

Psychology is very important to me and analyzing people is something I do automatically at this point.

I don't know what you want in life but if you feel like you want the same thing, let me know. I don't care if we have a lot in common when it comes to hobbies or not. More to talk about, more to get together just to simply share.
I just don't like it when people assume things. I ask a lot of questions but if I'm the only one asking questions, that's not so fun. 
I guess talking to strangers these days feels a little difficult. I miss the honesty, vulnerability and the curiosity to understand a different view rather than assume the worst.

'Jugni' is the firefly which shines the light of 'ilm ع in the darkness. Her light guides the way for travellers who tread this path. This one is dedicated to the everlasting love of the Jugni.  
  
Gourmand Animalic!!! Somehow there is a very fine olfactory line between animal derived ingredients and ingredients you'd wanna eat. It sounds weird but if you've smelt a chocolatey Musk, or a vannilar Castoreum you'd know the feeling. This is my attempt at walking the line between sweetness and harshness, without falling off the edge.  
  
The opening is Pink Lotus and Rose, met with some sweetness  
The Gourmand aspect shines in the middle as the Vanilla, Coffee and Betel Leaf interact. It has a desi touch to an otherwise chestnut pairing, those with good noses may also find Tobacco, Resins and Spices.  
The drydown is intense as fuckkk!!! The Hyraceum and Musk duo do all the heavy lifting. The musk is fiery and earthy but also keeps some chocolatey nuances alive. The Hyraceum is very smoky and charred,  
The Bhutani Oud is spicy and leathery, and the Hindi surprisingly has to calm it down a bit, just goes to show the intensity that this blend has. Bhutani is an Oud I've wanted to experiment with for a while, and this was the perfect blend for it. It's a very chaotic and 'in your face' blend, but those with mature noses and a taste for whimsy (moj masti) might find something here.

ProConstitution will be meeting at **Nothings Left Brewing** this **Wednesday** from **7-9**.

The news wants us to feel down and powerless. When we get together we realize how strong we actually are.

Since last January there has been a rapid growth of organizations forming in Tulsa working on community building, legislative action, mutual aid, and positive change. We saw the poison that was being spread and worked to hold ground. A year later and many of these groups are pushing forwards and making large change.  Every day there is something new we have to defend and instead of being overwhelmed people like you are joining in and we are working on every problem instead of crumbling.

Come join us Wednesday and talk about some of the things that are weighing on you. You'd be surprised how many doom-and-gloom situations actually are being dismantled by people just like us. Say it with me everyone ""Executive orders aren't laws""

**Our ""meetings"":**

* We go around the table and talk about one piece of bad news we've heard or are worried about (this part isn't very long- on purpose)
* We go around the table and share a piece of good news. Since everyone comes from diverse backgrounds it's really nice to know that we are winning battles we didn't even know we are fighting

ProConstitution will be meeting at **Nothings Left Brewing** this **Wednesday** from **7-9**.

The news wants us to feel down and powerless. When we get together we realize how strong we actually are.

Since last January there has been a rapid growth of organizations forming in Tulsa working on community building, legislative action, mutual aid, and positive change. We saw the poison that was being spread and worked to hold ground. A year later and many of these groups are pushing forwards and making large change.  Every day there is something new we have to defend and instead of being overwhelmed people like you are joining in and we are working on every problem instead of crumbling.

Come join us Wednesday and talk about some of the things that are weighing on you. You'd be surprised how many doom-and-gloom situations actually are being dismantled by people just like us. Say it with me everyone ""Executive orders aren't laws""

**Our ""meetings"":**

* We go around the table and talk about one piece of bad news we've heard or are worried about (this part isn't very long- on purpose)
* We go around the table and share a piece of good news. Since everyone comes from diverse backgrounds it's really nice to know that we are winning battles we didn't even know we are fighting
* We will talk about upcoming events or businesses our group (ProConstitution) will support this week and month
* We will talk about what other organizations in Tulsa are doing and decide which events we want to attend as a group.

1r178mr,https://www.reddit.com/r/BigLawRecruiting/comments/1r178mr/the_summer_associate_survival_guide_that_you_dont/,The Summer Associate Survival Guide (That You Don't Actually Need But May Help If You Want One),"**Hiya recruits!**

Now that folks have started to get their offers and accept, we're starting to see a new question pop up. 

# Is there a huge post on summer associate guide as well as 1L associates? Like some things to get familiar on, items to purchase before starting etc.?

Very valid question!

First, let me start with the most important thing: **you don't actually need a guide like this.** Your firm is going to hold your hand through literally everything. They have entire Hr/recruiting departments whose job is making sure you are set up to hit the ground running day 1. They'll very likely tell you everything you need to know, like how to set up your tech, walk you through their systems, assign you work, even dress codes, and anything else that would be relevant to you working. 

**I promise, you could show up on day one having done zero preparation and you'd be completely fine.**

But I also know that waiting for your summer to start can be anxiety-inducing, and sometimes it just feels better to have a plan. So if making a checklist helps you feel more prepared (I know it does for me), here's what might be useful to think about.

# Before You Start

**Wardrobe:** Don't buy much until you see what people actually wear—business casual varies wildly. Get one or two full suits for your first week-ish/if you ever get the chance to do something cool like go to court or sit in on a client meeting (pro tip: you can get a couple suits with colors that are easy to mix and match so your outfits are versatile. This [guide](https://xsuit.com/blogs/news/mastering-the-art-of-mixing-suit-colors-elevate-your-business-suit-attire) is helpful (in case you're like me and fashion is not your forte). 

After that, a few pairs of dress pants/skirts/dresses, some button-downs, and comfortable professional shoes. Nice sneakers are genuinely fine at many firms now, but have backup dress shoes just in case. 

Second pro tip: Some schools have partnerships with clothing companies and provide free/cheap business wear. Ask your school if that's something they offer. 

**The basics:** (These are generally things the firm will have ready for you and/or give you as swag/just have in the office) 

A writing pad and pen. (Firm will have)

A bag/backpack that fits a laptop. (Firm may give you one as swag, but have one on your own if they don't)

Headphones for calls. (Firm will also have, but personally I never liked the ones firms give by default, so if you prefer your own, bring those)

That's really it. The firm will provide almost everything else.

# What to Expect

**Week one is orientation.** Presentations on practice groups, firm culture, administrative systems. It can feel like drinking from a firehose, but just take notes on names and who does what. You'll figure out the rest as you go and through repetition.

**The work:** This will be HIGHLY dependent on your group, but generally you can anticipate something along the lines of diligence work, research memos and case law research, (maybe very very light document review), and maybe some drafting (a lot of this will often be for pro bono work, not just traditional billable work, so that's normal).   
  
It varies by group but you obviously won't be running deals or trials. Remember summers are mostly a chance to just taste test work and mostly get to know people in different groups. Talking and being social are generally just as important as trying your best at the actual substantive work. 

**Assignments:** Some firms have coordinators who distribute work. Others expect you to network for it. Figure out which system your firm uses (the firm will usually just tell you in orientation, but its helpful to know before you start). 

When you get an assignment, a basic tip/good practice generally is to confirm the deadline and scope/any questions you have. 

If you're stuck after genuinely trying (30-60 minutes) and spinning your wheels, ask for help. 

If you'll miss a deadline, communicate early (this is SUPER key, both as a summer and just as a practitioner generally).

**The social part:** Go to events. Have lunch with people. Accept coffee invitations. Ask on your own for coffee. This is how you build relationships that lead to mentorship and return offers (though at most big law firms they're basically guaranteed anyways). You don't need to be the life of the party, just present, enthusiastic, and friendly.

# The Important Stuff

**Your actual job is to get a return offer.** Again, this is basically guaranteed 99% of the time unless something terrible happens. But overall, this means being competent (not in terms of substance, but just basic ""ask questions and try to learn"" kind of way), be responsive (SUPER key), and pleasant to work with. It does not mean working 80-hour weeks or producing perfect work (a lot of summer work is tossed and redone anyways or an extremely small part of the matter that isn't an issue everything hinges on, so it really is just a chance for you to get a couple swings at bat). 

The bar is ""would we want to work with this person"" not ""is this person already a great lawyer.""

**Things that matter:** Reply to emails promptly. Ask clarifying questions upfront. Double-check your work for typos. Bill your time daily (if you worked on it, bill it—the firm expects summer inefficiency and for you to be slow. Don't discount your own time). Show up to social events. Be kind to everyone, especially staff and assistants.

Seriously that's about it. 

**Things that will hurt you:** Missing deadlines without communication (I have seen people no offered for this). Disappearing mid-day and being totally unresponsive without telling anyone. Skipping all social events. Being rude to staff. Complaining about work to other summers (or attorneys) who might repeat it.

# Bottom Line

Again, the vast majority of people get return offers. The summer flies by. Your goal is to be someone people want to work with while figuring out what kind of law you actually enjoy. Be responsive, be kind, do solid work, and show up. That's genuinely most of it.

The firm will teach you everything else.

# That's all for now!

As always, if you're new here, make sure to check out the welcome megathread [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/BigLawRecruiting/comments/1j1tesh/new_to_rblr_and_recruiting_read_this_megathread/) for some more helpful guides!

# Good luck!

P.S. I have a callback interview guide that includes essentially every question a firm could possibly ask you, has recommended answers, and is in Word doc format so you can edit it and make it your own. Just DM me if you want it.

Full disclosure, we created this one and we help keep the lights on with subscriptions. But its also free for a full week so anyone is welcome to poke around and steal whatever is helpful. Either way, I hope the database and this guide are helpful to everyone out there.

I also play hockey regularly in Canada and would love to continue once I move, so if anyone has recommendations for adult leagues, rinks, or general hockey culture in Nashville, that would be awesome.

1) Should I caramelize the whole amount of honey I intend to use, or only a partial portion? I want the caramelized flavor to come through, so I worry that less than the whole amount is going to be overpowered by the coffee flavor, but I also worry that caramelizing all of it is going to affect it's ability to ferment because of a lack of basic sugars. Any experience with this, or advice, or even speculation?

2) I'm making my cold brew coffee with alkaline water. I'm using 71B, so I feel like my yeast is pretty stable and robust enough to survive lower pH, but I know I need to reduce the acidity since caramelizing increases acidity and coffee (even cold brew) is acidic as well. Alkaline water isn't magic, but it has made me some stellar coffee in the past, and I'm assuming it won't HURT to cut it back the pH a little. Thoughts on this?

3) In making my homemade cold brew, I was just going to make the whole gallon of concentrate and use that, but I think that would be overpowering of the warm caramel notes from the honey, so I'm going to make the whole gallon of concentrate with the alkaline water, but cut it 1:1 with regular distilled water instead of more alkaline water. Does this seem appropriate? Or is there a lot of coffee flavor lost in the fermenting process?

Hoping some of you have insight into this. Maybe it's a bad idea because neither the caramelized favor nor the coffee flavor will really be accentuated, but I figure it's worth a shot!",1,1770744545.0,mead,3,0.67,False

About a week ago, I suggested we keep things casual because I was scared of getting hurt and was trying to hold on without fully letting go. I told him he could see other people, even though I wasn’t planning to.

About a week later, he matched with my ex best friend on Hinge and went on a coffee date with her. Halfway through the date, he realized who she was and still continued. He knew about my past with her and that she had hurt me before. When he told me, I felt confused, scared, and like I was losing him, so I ended things the next day because I was emotionally overwhelmed.

She later texted me that night asking how I knew him, which confirmed they were still talking after I ended things and made it hurt even more. They had exchanged info. 

I know I technically agreed to him seeing other people, but this specific situation crossed a line I didn’t realize I had. If it had been a random person, I don’t think I would’ve spiraled or ended things. I ended it to protect myself , but now I’m questioning if I overreacted.

The apartment is spacious, well-maintained, and ideal for students, interns, or professionals spending the summer in Nashville.

Hello reddit, this is my first post ever but I wanna know if I'm insane or not and sorry in advance for the long post and for any grammar mistakes. 

So I work at a place with multiple locations and I usually cover multiple stores. I am pretty popular and well-known and liked at the company and usually managers request me for my good work. The story begins with me working at one location and meeting a coworker \\\[43 F\\\] I used to know from another location and she is a super nice lady and joyful to deal with. one day I saw someone new \\\[21 F\\\] and I immediately felt something. turns out she is the daughter of the other coworker and we had a quick chat and everything was good. the mom knew I was interested and she was excited about it. I sought the help of another coworker \\\[22 F\\\] (which is friends with the mom) to get the contact of the girl I liked. at first she discouraged me from the girl saying bad stuff about her that wasn't entirely true but she gave me her account reluctantly. I sent the girl a message saying that I think she's interesting and I want to know her better so what if we go out for a meal and a good walk so we get to know each other better. she answered after 7 hours saying she is interested and when should we meet. I gave her the date in mind and the place and told her that day would have a Christmas market that we can go look at. she left me on read for 3 days and didn't say anything. one day before the intended day I wrote a quirky poem to see if she's still interested or not and she replied saying (I am officially swooned) and it's the first time someone wrote her a poem and we planned the time and place to pick her up. we went on the date and it was amazing. when I asked her why she didn't reply she told me that she had really bad experiences in the past and she usually doesn't trust people easily and it has been more than 2 years since she went out with someone so she was nervous and scared so I asked her if I didn't send that poem she's wouldn't have replied to me then and she said no she would have replied because she was really excited about it but she needed the time to muster the courage and the poem sealed the deal. and saying the date was amazing isn't giving it justice. it felt like I met my soul mate and it felt mutual. whenever I go deep in conversation she would be deeper, whenever I become weird she would match my energy,  when I flirt she would flirt more. she initiated physical contact and was hugging me. at some point when we were sitting closer she leaned and rested her head on my chest and smelled me intensely multiple times and said I smell really good. she also shared a part of her traumatic past and that girl has been through a lot.

After the date ended and I dropped her off back home we had a moment and we kissed. 

We kept texting through the night and it felt like we're already in a relationship not just going on a date.

Being the stupid person that I am, I went out for coffee the very next day with the other 22 F coworker. My intention was she can help me be closer to the mom and the girl because I really loved her. I kept texting my girl and sent her a morning poem to wake up to which she loved and kept flirting with me. When she asked about my plans for the day and I told her I'm out with this person (which she knows and knows has a boyfriend) and would do other stuff and after that she stopped responding to my texts immediately. 10 minutes later the mom sent the coworker a text saying (where the fuck are you!) Which the girl told me is out of character for her. Fast forward a couple of days later we had a work event and I met them there, the mom gave me a nasty death glare and didn't even acknowledge me which wasn't usual since she liked me a lot before all this happened. I asked my girl to speak outside. She looked really nice and she gave me a big hug and kept laughing nervously I asked her why are you laughing she said because she's shy. Her mom called her and told her to come back immediately and a while later the girl did so as well. I spoke with her quickly and told her I really like her and I asked her why she's not responding and she told me it's because she's scared and feels things are fast and she needs time and I asked her do you think this can go somewhere between us and she said enthusiastically yes in the future I think it will and I asked her will we see each other again and she said yes definitely. 

Not gonna lie I felt she was letting me down easily but I spoke with a friend and he told me she was hurt because you went out with that girl and most probably that girl threw you under the bus when the mom got mad. Whenever I sent her a text after that she didn't reply but whenever I posted a story on Instagram she would immediately view it. She never told me stop texting me or anything however I admit I was a bit too much. One friend recommended I go to her house and speak with her so after about 5 weeks of silence I went to her house with flowers. The mom opened the door and she was cordial, she went and brought the girl and we spoke for about 30 minutes. I told her how I felt about her and how it was something I don't often experience and I am scared but I want it to happen and so on and told her that I know it feels mutual and that you are interested as well and she agreed that she is interested but she said that she is young and scared and doesn't know what to do with her life and feels lost and that scares her and she wants to figure it out first. I told her if you don't want this I would understand and leave you alone and never bother you again. She said no I really want this but I need to figure out the other stuff first. 

Due to her past trauma she went into bad habits that lead her to lose everything including her dream school and she hit rock bottom but she is better now and getting her footing and I think because of that she thinks she doesn't have anything to offer and I would see that eventually and leave and that's why she is scared and frozen. 

I told her so since we both want this and the timing is just wrong how about we stay friends and revisit this in the future when you feel the time is right? We'd meet for coffee and keep texting to know each other better and take it easy and when you feel comfortable we'll pick it up again and she agreed. I went for a hand shake and she said oh you don't want to hug? And then hugged me the longest tightest hug I ever had in my life and she kept muttering I'm sorry I'm sorry so I told her there's nothing to be sorry about I love you and I only want the best for you even if I'm not a part of that best. We talked more and hugged more and she even planned when we will meet next. After I left she texted me she was happy and drive safe.

the very next day I had one of hr contact me about workplace harassment claim made against me and I am suspended until they investigate, however, no official email was sent and after two days (a Saturday) I had an email saying go back to work but no contact outside of work with this person. I later found out that the mom was the one who made the claim encouraged by the other girl and my girl disputed it by saying it wasn't harassment and she liked me there.

I initially unfollowed her on Instagram and she did the same after 3 days. I stayed silent and didn't do anything for about 6 weeks. during this whole time I wasn't requested to work at that store at all which is unusual since the manager liked me so much and liked my work and they were short staffed. but one day I was visiting a friend at another location and that manager saw me there and she avoided me like the plague at first but when I spoke with her and joked around a bit she immediately became friendly again as if she was waiting to see my reaction. two weeks later they asked me to work at that store (with the mom) for about 3 weeks and I agreed. the first day there was good, the mom was treating me warmly as if nothing ever happened and she introduced me to the new people unprompted. one time I was helping someone and they said how amazing I am and they were so happy they dealt with me and when I looked at the mom she was smiling at me proudly. it got better than that with more time passing. she would mention her daughter in conversations but I didn't interact with that for a while and one time I asked her how is she and she said she is doing good and gave me an update on her life. after a shift I asked the mom to speak and I told her I'm sorry if my actions didn't reflect my intentions I never meant to cause trouble or anything I really care for her daughter and so on and would it be okay to wish her a happy birthday. she said she appreciates my apology and everything is water under the bridge it was a big misunderstanding and yes a birthday text is appropriate. 

my relationship with the mom is good now but only when we see each other. she would give me updates on her family, she would give me suggestions on movies and music, she would joke and even tease me about stuff. so it doesn't feel like professional politeness at all. however, I sent her an Instagram request last night but she removed it. 

about the birthday message, I sent it one day before the girl's birthday and she read it but didn't reply. at work the mom kept repeating a story about her that I didn't pay attention to but then the mom kept repeating until I asked what's going on and she told me that the girl was trapped at the airport for 2 days because of the weather and she had to fly to another city to get another flight and then that flight got canceled and she had to be back to the other city and then wait 11 hours for a flight home and she didn't sleep or eat and so stressed and crying. then a couple of days after that I asked her how she's doing she said she's doing better she came back around 4 am and had to be at work at 8 am so it was hard but she's catching up on her sleep.

one of the traumatic events she had was she had a good charming boyfriend that turned out to be in a gang and when she tried to break up with him he kept threatening her and stalking her.

I believe that because of what she want through she felt that I wouldn't think she's good enough because of ""where"" she is right now and I have better opinions and when I see that I would leave and that made her scared and overwhelmed which manifested in her being frozen and the mom saw that + the badmouthing from the other girl and assumed her daughter is scared of me and I am aggressive and she went into protective mode which ended up with the claim. after the claim, the girl spoke with the mom about how wrong she was and told her the truth about how she feels, and me being silent and not doing anything at all proved to the mom that I am a good person and coupled with her daughter's feelings and talking constantly about me she opened up to me again but now the situation is messy to manager normally so there is still some reserve. 

it's been a total of 3 months and a half start to date. Last message I sent was 3 weeks ago.

I really am in love with this girl and I want to give it a proper try and I know the girl feels the same but I don't know what to do. 

am I delusional? how can I make this happened?

Its strange to me how I have minimal decay and don't tend to have bad breath either. Don't get me wrong, I have fillings, and need more but it's never been an issue issue. I have friends who brush daily and have worse teeth than me. My teeth aren't even yellow tbh. They're Def not white either. 

Here's where it gets a little crazy. I have been taking prescription opioids , smoking cannabis, and drinking black coffee every day for the last 15 years. How have I not lost all my teeth...?

My question is, why? Why are my teeth so resilient? 

2nd question is: Is Hydroxiappetite toothpaste worth it? I've heard great things and it's been far more studied as of recent. I want to get on track with my oral hygiene, and most def want to make sure I repair my teeth.

Working on something and genuinely can't tell if it's a viable business or just me solving my own weird problem.



Background: I'm in tech sales, fly 50+ times a year (mostly Europe/US). The jet lag kills me – I lose 2-3 days every trip feeling completely wrecked. It's gotten to the point where I'm basically writing off the first few days of being back home or arriving somewhere new.

I tried Timeshifter (the main jet lag app). It's actually good, but I'd get the notification to check my plan and then... just never open it. I'd think ""yeah I'll look at that later"" and completely forget. Every single time.



So I started building something simpler: just push notifications that tell me what to do at the exact moment. ""Stop coffee now."" ""Go to bed 30 min early tonight."" No app to check, no plan to remember. Removes the whole ""remembering to follow the plan"" step.



Here's where I'm stuck:



Market sizing question:

\- People who fly enough to care about jet lag: maybe a few million?

\- People who'd actually pay for a solution: ???

\- People who tried Timeshifter and it didn't stick: no idea



I'm thinking $7.99/month or $49/year. Timeshifter is $9.99 so I'm pricing lower, but honestly not sure if that matters.



The concern:

Ultra-frequent flyers (100+ flights/year) already have their own routines – they don't need an app. Occasional travelers (5-10 flights/year) probably won't pay monthly. So I'm targeting the middle – people who fly 15-40 times a year with irregular routes.



Is that big enough to build a business around? Or am I just building an expensive solution to my personal organisational failure?



Built a landing page (Passenger – can I share links here??). Got about 20 email signups so far but hard to tell if that's validation or just friends being nice.



Anyone here built in the travel/productivity space? How'd you figure out if your niche was too small?

I write code for a US company so I needed decent timezone overlap with EST. Tracked all my spending because I'm like that. This question shows up here every week so here's what I actually spent.

Finding an apartment in Barcelona sucked. Took 2 weeks on Idealista. Ended up in Eixample near Passeig de Gràcia, 1BR, €1,270/mo. Monthly total came to about €2,700 with everything (food, metro, coworking at MOB Bailén for €250, gym at DIR for €57, eating out, etc). Valencia was way easier. Found a place in Ruzafa through a Facebook group for €1,020. Monthly total more like €2,400. Thats €900 saved over 3 months. A flight to anywhere basically.

Beer in Barcelona €4.50-5. Valencia €3.50. Coffee about the same. Groceries the same because Mercadona is Mercadona.

Internet both 270mbps fiber. Spain just has this figured out.

Got pickpocketed 5 weeks into Barcelona. Green line (L3), rush hour at Passeig de Gràcia. Someone bumped me, didn't notice my phone was gone until Diagonal. Actually got it back because Find My showed it still in the station, they must have dropped it when they saw it was locked. After that I was checking my pockets every 5 minutes. Always watching my bag in Raval at night. In Valencia I walked home at 1:30am through the center and didn't think about it once. My girlfriend visited for 2 weeks and said the same thing, she felt totally fine walking alone.

Used Wayco in Valencia for coworking, €150/mo. Better than MOB honestly. Newer, less packed in the mornings when I actually work.

I ate at Mercat Central in Valencia like 3x a week. Probably skews my numbers but the food there for the price is stupid good. Barcelona has more international restaurants and fancier options. I mostly cook at home and eat out for lunch though so Valencia worked better for me. There was this spot near my apartment, Bar Ricardo, menú del día €12 with wine. Same thing in Barcelona runs €15-16 and its usually worse.

Went out way more in Barcelona the first 6 weeks. More people, more events, more stuff on Meetup and Lemon. Valencia is smaller. More local. More Spanish which was harder for me since my Spanish is mid. Got invited to some things through the Wayco community but its a different energy.

The thing nobody warns you about is how the tourists in Barcelona grind you down over time. Even Gràcia which is supposed to be the local neighborhood has segway tours going through it now. In Valencia I went days without feeling like a foreigner in a tourist trap. Sounds like nothing but 3 months in it matters a lot.

I'm back in Valencia now writing this. Do with that information what you want. Barcelona is a great city I'm not trashing it. But for sitting down and getting work done every day without burning cash or getting stressed out, this worked better for me.

Got my expense spreadsheet if anyone wants details on anything specific.

The breakup waasn't dramatic but it also wasn't friendly. We were arguing a lot and i felt more like a roommate than a partner so I decided to leave.

Before we ever dated I already owned a pretty expensive espresso machine. When we first started hanging out he came over, saw it, and we ended up making coffee all night and talking until morning. After that coffee kind of became our whole thing. Weekend coffee dates at home, trying new beans, pretending we were baristas. We even joked that the machine was the reason we got together.

When I started packing my stuff I took the things I bought before we moved in. Clothes, my desk, my guitar, and obviously the espresso machine since I paid for it years before meeting him. When he saw me packing it he got really upset and said I was being cold because the machine was “the heart of our home.” He said taking it felt like I was erasing our relationship.

I told him I understood the memories but it was still mine and also really expensive. He said since I was the one ending things I could at least leave it as a peace offering, I said no and kept packing.

On moving day I unplugged it, cleaned it, boxed it up, and took it with me. I didn’t take anything we bought together, only stuff that was clearly mine. I even left the cheaper coffee maker we bought during a sale so he'd still have something.

Since then his friends have been messaging me saying I’m petty and heartless for taking something that meant a lot to both of us. One of them said I knew how sentimental he was about it and I could have just let him keep it. He also posted vague stuff online about people taking “the soul of a home” when they leave.

I don’t feel like I did anything wrong because it was mine long before him and I need it in my new place anyway. But now Im second guessing because maybe it looked harsher than i intended. AITAH?",18,1770743613.0,AITAH,43,0.83,False

I ordered coffee online and received it in resealable packaging without valves. Can I leave the coffee in these bags and reseal them with the zip? Or is it better to put them in airtight jars?

Also, it says that after opening, it is best to consume the coffee within four weeks to preserve the aroma. If I leave the bags closed for now and consume them 1 by 1 instead of opening them all in 2 weeks to taste them, will I still have the aroma if I open them in one or two months?

  
I should point out that I calculated the humidity in a bag stored in a cupboard where the humidity is around 75%, and it was 40% in the closed bag.

My Monstera (which I've had for a while) and my new Schefflera are both dying and I can't figure out why.

The Symptoms: The Monstera leaves are turning yellow and dropping, and the Schefflera leaves are getting these dark, crispy edges. I thought it was just the cold or transplant shock, but it’s getting worse every day.

Supporting Info:

Watering: I’ve been watering once every 10 days, but recently stopped because the soil feels 'soggy' even after a week.

Light: They sit right next to a bright window (indirect light).

The Weird Stuff: I’ve started seeing tiny black flies (fungus gnats?) around the pots and even in my coffee. I also noticed some 'slime trails' on the soil—I thought it was snails, but I don't see any.

The Crisis: My expensive hardwood floors under the pots are starting to warp from what looks like a 'silent' leak. I’m terrified I’m losing hundreds of dollars in plants and damaging my home at the same time.

I’m currently trying a 'potato test' on the soil to see what's happening underground, but I feel like I'm just guessing. Does this look like root rot or a massive infestation I brought home? Any 'tactical' advice to save them before I lose the whole collection? ",2,1770743585.0,plantclinic,4,1.0,False

The virtual Visa debit card is now live and ready to roll for US users. Top it up with BTC, USDT, or $GOMINING from your mining rewards, and start spending those earnings on everyday purchases – gas, groceries, tech gear, or online shopping – all while earning TH cashback on every transaction, scaled to your VIP level.

What really elevates this is the killer invite program integrated directly into the cards. Invite your crypto buddies, fellow miners, or friends new to Bitcoin yield, and you both unlock prizes like bonus hashpower NFTs, extra GOMINING tokens, or boosted cashback rates. Share a single link on Discord, Twitter, or Telegram, and watch your farm grow as their activity feeds back into shared rewards. It’s a smart way to scale your mining operation passively, especially for US users dodging the headaches of physical hardware setups.

Load the card into Apple Pay or Google Wallet for seamless contactless payments anywhere – from quick coffee runs to big online hauls. Plus, the signup bonus delivers a free 1 TH/s miner NFT right to your dashboard, instantly boosting your hash rate. Turning daily spending into more Bitcoin production creates the perfect closed loop in the GoMining ecosystem.

US miners – who’s already issued a card and tested it in the real world? How do transactions hold up at major retailers or less crypto-friendly spots? Any surprises with limits, fees, or acceptance? Impressive cashback stories converting to real hash power gains? EEA users, share your 1-2 month experiences – reliable daily driver, or better for occasional use? 

I’m a little worried there would be hidden fees so I’m keeping an eye out for that.

Hi there,

I’ve been dealing with bowel issues for a number of years including intermittent light frank blood with bowel movements and sludgy diarrhea-like stool with occasional coffee ground appearance. My baseline is that I basically never poop naturally - I have to take a combo of osmotic and stimulant laxatives to poop about 3 times a week. I never feel constipated, just don’t get the urge to go.

I’m always very bloated after eating, and feel delayed gastric emptying.

I have been diagnosed with endometriosis with nodules on the rectum and peri-rectal space that were removed surgically. These symptoms aren’t cyclical. I’ve also lost about 15 lbs in the last 1.5 years. Though I am a relatively active person with a small appetite. Vegetarian, very high fibre intake but I’ve trialled lower fibre to improve symptoms to no avail.

Today I had a colonoscopy - GI mentioned my colon looked great with the exception of “nodular lymphatic hyperplasia”. He fobbed this off as being “of little significance in a young person”.

I know I’m “young” compared to most patients getting colonoscopies, as a 30 year old, but most of what I’ve read about this condition says it’s normal variant in childhood.

Can this condition be of any significance? Is there any further work up? He essentially suggested I just continue on my laxative journey and come back for colonoscopy if symptoms persist.

Thank you for your help! ",1,1770743551.0,AskDocs,1,1.0,False
1r16n60,https://www.reddit.com/r/horrorstories/comments/1r16n60/ive_lived_the_same_five_years_over_and_over_it/,I’ve lived the same five years over and over. It always ends the same way.,"The first time it happened, I thought it was a nervous breakdown with a flair for theatrics.

I was thirty-two, sitting in a Honda dealership off Route 17, signing paperwork I didn’t need to sign. A pen on a counter. Fluorescent lights that made everyone’s skin look slightly gray. A salesman with a forced laugh and a tie that kept drifting crooked like it hated being there too. I had spent the last ten minutes arguing—calmly, politely, like I was ordering a sandwich—that I didn’t want a “protection package” and that no, I wasn’t paying extra for floor mats that came with the car anyway.

I’d done this before.

Not in the normal way—like “I bought a car once” before. I mean every word, every pause, every little motion of his hand when he tapped the brochure had already been in my body. Like my muscles remembered.

My stomach turned over, slow and heavy, because I realized I could predict what he’d say next.

“Listen,” he was saying, “I’m just trying to take care of you. People don’t think about… you know. What if—”

“What if a deer runs into the side of it,” I finished, at the exact same time he did, and he blinked at me like I’d reached into his mouth and pulled the sentence out.

He laughed. “Man, you must sell cars.”

I didn’t. I worked in inventory for a warehouse that shipped medical supplies. Or… I had. I couldn’t even tell, in that moment, if that was still true.

I dropped the pen. It clacked against the counter and rolled. The sound felt too loud in the little office.

In the window, between the glossy poster of a smiling couple and the row of cars outside, I saw my reflection.

I looked normal. Tired. Stubble I should’ve shaved. A scar at the edge of my eyebrow from a bike accident when I was nine. Same guy.

So why did my heart feel like it was running from something?

I pushed the paperwork away.

“I can’t,” I said.

The salesman’s smile faltered. “Can’t what?”

“I can’t do this.” My throat tightened, because I realized what I meant wasn’t “I can’t buy the car.” It was everything. The whole day. The whole week. The whole stretch of time my brain was insisting had already happened.

I stood up too fast. The chair scraped.

The salesman started talking again—something about deposits and financing—but his voice blurred, because I heard something else. Not in the dealership. Not through the wall. Something that wasn’t a sound so much as a pressure behind my ears.

A countdown.

Not numbers spoken out loud. Just a sense of time snapping into place like a trap being set.

Five years.

That phrase hit me out of nowhere, sharp as a slap.

Five years and then it comes.

I left without explaining. I walked out into the lot and the air felt like winter even though it was April. The sky was that flat, overcast gray that makes everything look like it’s waiting.

I got into my car—my old car, the one with the cracked dash—and my hands were shaking so badly I had to sit there and breathe.

That was Cycle One, I guess. The one where I still believed in normal explanations.

I went to a doctor. I did scans. I took pills. I did therapy. I avoided caffeine. I did everything you do when your brain starts betraying you.

And then, five years later, it found me.

I’m not telling you “five years later” like it was a neat little skip. I lived those five years. I aged through them. I watched my hairline change in the mirror and I felt the dull ache in my knees when it rained. I made friends. I lost touch with people. I paid bills. I watched shows. I had a relationship that ended because we wanted different things and she cried in my kitchen and I stood there holding a dish towel like it could save me.

The world didn’t feel fake. That’s the part that screws with you. It wasn’t a dream you wake up from. It was life. Regular, boring, stupid life.

Until the last day.

It was a Tuesday. I know because I’d been annoyed I had to work late and I’d promised myself I’d start meal prepping on Wednesdays. I stopped at a Sunoco after work—the kind with the little convenience store that sells hot dogs that have been turning on metal rollers for hours. I bought a coffee even though it tasted like burned plastic, and the receipt printed with that thin heat-paper font that fades if you leave it in your car.

I remember the stupid detail because later I tried to keep one. I tried to prove it to myself.

When I walked out, my car wouldn’t start. The engine turned over and then quit, like it was choking.

I tried again. Same thing.

I sat there with the key in my hand, staring at my dashboard lights.

And I knew. Not guessed. Knew.

Because that same pressure behind my ears was back, stronger now, like the air itself was leaning in.

It’s here.

I got out of the car. The parking lot was mostly empty. A guy in a hoodie was walking into the store. Two semis idled by the pumps, their engines rumbling low.

Nothing looked wrong. No storm. No sirens. No dramatic build.

Then I saw it across the street, on the edge of the woods that bordered the highway.

At first my brain refused to label it. It was too tall, too thin, too wrong to be a person.

It stepped out from between the trees like it had been waiting politely for me to notice.

Ten feet, at least. Maybe more. Emaciated in a way that didn’t look like starvation so much as something had pulled it apart and forgot to put it back together. Its arms were too long, hanging almost to its knees. Its chest was a narrow cage. Its skin was pale and stretched tight over bone like shrink wrap over leftovers.

No clothes. No hair. No eyes.

Just smooth skin where eye sockets should’ve been, like someone had pressed them flat.

And a mouth.

A long, grinning mouth that cut across its face. Not a smile like a person. A grin like a rip. The lips were thin, cracked, and pulled back far enough that I saw teeth that looked too many and too small, like a row of broken piano keys.

It didn’t move fast. It didn’t need to.

It tilted its head slightly, as if listening, and then it started walking toward the gas station.

Straight line. No hesitation.

A man with a normal brain would’ve screamed. I didn’t. I stood there with coffee in my hand, frozen, because a chunk of me kept insisting it was impossible.

Then it crossed the road without looking for cars, stepping between moving vehicles like it knew they wouldn’t hit it. A pickup swerved and honked. The driver leaned out the window to yell something and then slammed on the brakes, not because he wanted to, but because his body decided for him.

He stared.

The creature didn’t look at him. Didn’t even turn its head.

It just kept coming for me.

I dropped my coffee. The cup hit the ground and splashed dark liquid across the concrete.

And I ran.

I ran behind the convenience store, past a dumpster that smelled like sour milk and fryer grease, and I kept going, because there was nowhere else to go. I heard footsteps behind me—not heavy, not pounding, just a steady, soft slap like bare feet on wet pavement.

The thing didn’t breathe. I didn’t hear panting. I didn’t hear effort.

I cut around the side of the building, sprinted into the lot, and almost collided with the guy in the hoodie. His eyes went wide at my face and he stepped back like I had blood on me.

“I need help,” I said. My voice came out too high, almost childish. “Call—call someone. Call the police.”

He started reaching for his phone, but then his gaze flicked over my shoulder.

His hand froze.

Whatever he saw behind me drained the color from his face like someone had pulled a plug.

He didn’t run. He didn’t scream. He just stood there, phone halfway out of his pocket, staring.

The creature reached us, and it didn’t lunge or swipe like an animal.

It simply stepped closer, and the air around it felt thinner. Like oxygen got distracted.

My knees softened. I stumbled backward. The world narrowed to the shape of its mouth and the empty, eyeless skin above it.

It leaned down. Not to smell me. Not to whisper.

Just leaned down like you lean in to read a label.

And then—

There’s a gap in my memory there. Not because I blacked out. Because the next thing that happened wasn’t “the next thing.” It was the beginning.

I woke up on a different morning, in a different bed, with a different phone buzzing on the nightstand.

I sat up so fast I got dizzy.

Outside the window, sunlight. Birds. A normal day.

My phone’s lock screen showed a date.

Five years earlier.

I laughed out loud, one short bark, because my brain couldn’t decide if that was relief or hysteria.

I checked my reflection in the bathroom mirror and saw I was five years younger again. The tiny lines near my eyes were gone. My shoulders didn’t ache when I moved.

I stood there gripping the sink so hard my knuckles went white, and I understood something that felt too big to fit into words.

It reset.

Five years, and then it resets.

And it comes for me at the end.

I don’t know if it’s infinite. I don’t know if there’s a number where it stops. I just know I keep waking up at the start, and I keep hoping one of these mornings will be the last time.

That was when I started keeping notes.

Not a journal in the poetic sense. A system. Lists. Hard dates. Things only I would know so I couldn’t talk myself out of it later.

In one cycle, I set up a Gmail draft to myself with a subject line I’d never write by accident: “READ THIS FIRST: FIVE-YEAR RESET / EYELSS \\\[sic\\\] GIANT.” I left the typo on purpose. I attached a photo of my own face and circled my scar with a red markup tool like a lunatic. I wrote down the dealership moment, the coffee taste, the hoodie guy’s frozen hand.

When the reset happened, that draft didn’t exist. The account wasn’t logged in. The phone was a different model. The typo never got to exist.

That’s when I learned the rule that keeps ruining every “proof” plan:

The loop doesn’t preserve my tools.

It preserves me.

The world rearranges around my decisions. Like a slot machine that spins the same reels but stops on different symbols.

One cycle, I stayed in my warehouse job. Another cycle, I quit on impulse and went back to school. I became a teacher for three years, teaching ninth grade English in a school that smelled like pencil shavings and cafeteria pizza. I had a classroom. A desk. Students who made jokes and complained about essays. I thought, in that cycle, maybe being around kids—being grounded—would stop the spiral in my head.

It didn’t.

At the end of that cycle, it found me in the school parking lot.

It was winter. Snow piled against the curbs in dirty gray slabs. I’d stayed late grading papers, the building mostly empty except for the custodian pushing a mop bucket down the hall, humming under his breath. I walked out with my bag slung over my shoulder, thinking about whether I was going to stop at ShopRite.

I saw it standing by my car like it belonged there.

No eyes. That grin.

The snow around its feet was melted in a perfect oval, like heat radiated off it, but its skin looked cold.

I dropped my bag and tried to run back into the building.

The door wouldn’t open.

Not locked. Not stuck. It was like the handle wasn’t connected to anything. Like the building had decided I didn’t get to go inside.

The custodian’s humming stopped.

I turned my head and saw him at the end of the hallway through the glass, staring at me. Staring past me. His mouth was slightly open.

He didn’t move to help.

The creature stepped closer.

Reset.

Another cycle, I did the thing I never thought I’d do: I turned my life into content.

I became an influencer. I hate even typing that word, because it makes me sound like a joke, and honestly, that cycle was my worst five years in terms of dignity.

I started with fitness videos because it was easy to sell. People want transformation. People want simple routines. People want someone to tell them the secret is discipline and a powder you can buy from my link.

I sold protein powder. I sold “wellness stacks.” I posed with tubs of supplements like they were trophies. I took pictures in gyms with good lighting and pretended my confidence was natural.

I made money. That’s the gross part. It worked.

By year three, I had a small following. People recognized me at grocery stores and asked if I was “that guy.” My DMs were full of strangers calling me “king” and asking what brand of blender I used.

I thought maybe if I became a different enough person, the thing wouldn’t recognize me.

At the end of that cycle, it found me anyway.

It came during a livestream.

I was in my apartment, ring light on, camera angled just right, talking about “mindset” like I was qualified to talk about anything.

I noticed the comments slow down.

Not stop. Slow, like people were distracted by something off-screen.

Someone typed: bro wtf is behind you

I glanced at the chat, smiled like it was a joke, and turned my head.

In the reflection of the dark TV screen behind me, I saw it standing in my hallway.

Tall enough its head nearly brushed the ceiling.

No eyes.

That grin.

I lunged for my phone, knocked it off the tripod, and the live feed spun, showing carpet, showing my bare feet, showing my hand scrabbling for the device like it was going to save me.

I heard no footsteps. Just that steady, soft slap.

Then the phone camera caught a glimpse of it as it stepped over the fallen tripod.

Chat exploded. People screaming in text. Emojis. “IS THIS REAL” and “CALL 911” and “THIS IS SICK.”

I screamed for the first time in any cycle, raw and ugly, because there was no pretending now.

The last thing I remember before the reset was its mouth opening wider than it should’ve been able to, like the grin was a door.

Then the world snapped back to the beginning.

After enough cycles, you stop trying “normal” fixes.

I tried the big solutions.

In one cycle, I got rich on purpose. Not influencer rich. Real rich. I made a series of investments that, after enough loops, I learned how to time. I bought before spikes. I sold before crashes. I played the system like I had a cheat code because I did.

By year four, I had enough money to hire people who normally don’t answer emails from someone like me.

Scientists. Researchers. Private labs. A neurologist who smelled like expensive cologne and didn’t believe me until I predicted a freak hailstorm down to the hour.

I flew them out to a rented house in the mountains. Two physicists, a neuroscientist, a guy who worked in some government-adjacent lab and kept asking me where my funding came from.

They recorded everything.

They monitored my sleep. They asked about toxins. They took blood samples. They talked about time dilation and quantum branching and the idea that reality could be a series of decision trees.

One of them—the neuroscientist, Dr. Khan—sat across from me at a long dining table one night and said, “Even if we confirm you’re in a loop, that doesn’t mean we can alter it. We might only be passengers.”

“I don’t need you to alter it,” I said. “I need you to tell me what it is. And what that thing is.”

His face tightened. “You keep calling it a ‘thing.’”

“Because if I call it a man, I’ll throw up.”

They tried to set traps. They tried to find patterns. They tried to locate it early in the cycle.

We never saw it until the end.

It was like it didn’t exist until it did.

The last month of that cycle, they moved me into a reinforced facility rented from a company that specializes in “secure storage.” Concrete walls. Steel doors. Cameras. Motion sensors. Armed guards who thought they were protecting a rich guy from kidnapping.

I sat in a chair in the center of the main room with electrodes on my scalp and watched the camera feeds, waiting for the countdown pressure to start.

It did.

The guards kept joking about it, like nervous men do.

Then every camera went to static at once.

Not one. All of them.

The lights didn’t flicker. They stayed on. The power was fine. The cameras simply stopped showing reality.

The steel door at the far end of the corridor—the one that was rated to withstand a truck slamming into it—made a sound.

Not a bang. Not a crash.

A soft, deliberate scrape, like fingernails on metal.

Then the door opened.

Not blown open. Not pried open. It swung inward like someone had turned the handle.

It stepped into the corridor, ducking its head slightly to clear the frame.

No eyes. That grin.

One guard fired. The gunshots were deafening in the confined space. The smell of gunpowder filled the air so fast it made my eyes water.

The bullets hit it. I saw them strike skin. I saw the way its flesh dented and then smoothed.

It didn’t bleed.

It didn’t flinch.

It didn’t even turn its head toward the shooter.

It just kept walking toward me.

The guards’ screams were the worst part, because they weren’t brave-soldier screams. They were human animal noise. Panic. Disbelief.

I tried to run. I got maybe three steps before my legs went weak like someone had turned off the signal to my muscles.

It stopped in front of me.

Dr. Khan shouted something behind me, but his voice sounded far away, like he was underwater.

The creature leaned down again, close enough I smelled it.

Not rot. Not death.

Something dry. Like dust in an old attic. Like paper left in the sun.

Its mouth opened.

Reset.

After that, I tried spiritual.

One was a woman outside Santa Fe.

I remember her because she didn’t act impressed. She didn’t act greedy. She didn’t act like I’d handed her a story she could monetize.

She acted tired.

Her place was a one-story adobe-looking house with a chain-link fence and a yard full of scrubby plants that looked like they survived out of spite. Inside, the air smelled like dry sage and hot dust. No incense fog. No dramatic candles everywhere. Just one table in the center of a room with a packed dirt floor and a ceiling fan that squeaked on every rotation.

She introduced herself as Marisol. She was maybe late fifties, hair braided back, hands stained with something dark that could’ve been dye or soil. She watched me sit down like she was already measuring how fast I’d run.

I told her the truth. All of it. The five years. The reset. The thing.

She didn’t interrupt. She didn’t smile. She didn’t lean in.

When I finished, she said, “Describe its face.”

“No eyes,” I said. “Just skin. Smooth. And a mouth. A grin.”

“How tall.”

“Ten feet. Taller. Like it shouldn’t fit through doors, but it does.”

Marisol nodded once, like that checked a box she didn’t like.

She got up, walked to a shelf, and pulled down a shallow bowl. In the bowl was a gray powder that looked like ash, and a small glass vial with a cork.

She came back and set them on the table.

“Blood,” she said.

I stared at her.

“I’m not asking you because it’s dramatic,” she said. “I’m asking because if you don’t give it willingly, something else will take it.”

She slid a thin craft razor across the table.

I cut my palm shallow. Blood welled, dark and glossy.

Marisol held the bowl steady. “Let it fall.”

I let three drops fall into the ash.

The ash absorbed it like thirsty dirt.

Marisol poured the contents of the vial—clear liquid—into the bowl. The ash turned into a paste, thick and gray, with tiny red streaks.

She dipped two fingers into it and drew a circle on the table, right between us. Not a fancy symbol. Just a plain ring.

Then she looked up at me and said, “This isn’t a curse.”

“What is it,” I whispered.

“It’s a boundary,” she said. “You’re hitting the same boundary over and over.”

“A boundary with what?”

“With something that owns the end of you.”

My skin went cold. “That thing—”

“It’s not chasing you because it hates you,” she said. “It’s chasing you because it’s what comes next.”

“Can you stop it.”

Marisol stared at the circle she’d drawn like she didn’t want to touch it again.

“No,” she said. “But I can ask a question.”

“What question.”

She pressed her fingers to the ring of paste and whispered under her breath. Spanish, maybe, mixed with words I didn’t recognize. Flat, controlled, like she was reading a receipt.

The ceiling fan squeaked overhead.

My ears popped.

Not in the normal pressure way. Sharper. Like someone shoved a finger into both ear canals at the same time.

Marisol stopped mid-whisper. Her face blanched. She lifted her hand from the circle and stared at her fingers.

The paste on them was drying too fast, cracking like old mud.

She met my eyes and said, “It heard.”

My heart slammed. “Who heard?”

Marisol stood so fast her chair scraped. “Get out.”

“What—Marisol, what did you—”

“Get out,” she snapped, voice rising for the first time. “Leave my house.”

I stood, dizzy. “Is it coming now?”

“No,” she said, and the way she said it made it worse. “But you just made it aware that you’re trying.”

“But you said it isn’t aware.”

Marisol’s eyes flicked to the hallway behind me, then back to my face. “It doesn’t remember cycles,” she said. “That’s not the same thing.”

“What did I do.”

“You knocked,” she said. “And something on the other side moved.”

I left. I remember my shoes crunching grit on her porch. I remember the sun feeling too bright. I remember getting into my rental car and sitting there with my hands on the wheel until my knuckles hurt.

I never went back.

At the end of that cycle, it still came.

Now, you might be asking what the “beginning” is. What moment starts the five years.

It’s always normal.

Not a lab. Not lightning. Not a monster sighting.

I wake up on a morning that feels like any other. Different bed sometimes. Different apartment sometimes. Different city once.

But the same me.

And the same sense, like there’s a script I’m supposed to follow that I keep messing up.

The only consistent thing is the pressure behind my ears when the end gets close. It starts faint about a week out—like a headache that comes and goes. Then it gets stronger, and stronger, until it feels like the air itself is squeezing.

This cycle, it started earlier.

That’s why I’m posting now.

In the first month of each cycle, I will see—somewhere, somehow—a man in a red windbreaker holding a white plastic bag.

Sometimes he’s on a sidewalk. Sometimes he’s in a grocery store line. Sometimes he’s crossing a parking lot.

He always looks like he’s in a hurry. He always glances at me like he recognizes me, then looks away like he decided he doesn’t.

In the current cycle, I saw him at a Target in Paramus, three months in. Notebook aisle. Clearance stickers. He looked right at me and his expression did something small and ugly—pity, maybe—and then he disappeared into the crowd.

That’s how normal it stays.

Until it doesn’t.

This week, I started preparing like I always do, even though it has never worked.

Energy drinks. Protein bars. A first-aid kit. Running shoes.

And a body camera.

Last night I tested it by recording myself in my kitchen saying the date out loud and holding up today’s mail. When I played it back, everything looked fine except for a thin line of static across the top of the frame that only showed up near the end of the clip.

This morning, I woke up with dried blood under my nose.

I checked the date. I counted days.

Five.

This afternoon, I was walking past the laundromat with the broken “OPEN” sign. The air smelled like dryer exhaust and stale detergent. A TV inside played a daytime talk show too loud. I stopped at the crosswalk because the light was red.

A woman stood next to me with two grocery bags. She looked tired. She kept adjusting her grip like the handles were digging into her fingers.

Behind us, a car idled, bass thumping so low it vibrated the air.

Everything was normal.

Then the woman beside me went rigid.

She didn’t scream. She didn’t turn around dramatically. She just went still, like her muscles locked.

I glanced at her face. Her eyes were wide. She was staring across the street.

Her lips moved.

“What…” she whispered.

I turned my head.

Across the street, between a parked delivery van and the brick wall of a closed bank, there was a narrow gap of shadow that shouldn’t have been that dark in daylight.

In that shadow, something tall shifted.

It wasn’t fully there. Not the way it is at the end. It was like the outline of it was trying to form, and the air was resisting.

But I saw long arms.

Pale skin.

And the mouth.

That long, grinning cut of teeth, hovering in the dark like a smear of white.

The woman stumbled backward. Grocery bags slipped from her hands. A jar of pasta sauce shattered on the concrete. Red splashed like an accident.

The car behind us honked, impatient.

The thing in the shadow moved forward an inch.

My ears popped—hard—like someone shoved pressure into my skull and twisted. Pain flashed down my jaw. My vision narrowed. The street tilted.

I clapped a hand to my right ear and felt warm wetness.

Blood.

My hearing in that ear dropped to a muffled roar, like I’d gone underwater.

That’s new. That’s the cost.

And for the first time, it didn’t feel like the loop was waiting for the last day.

It felt like I’d just touched something I wasn’t supposed to touch.

I ran.

I sprinted down the street, past the vape shop and the nail salon and the pizza place with the greasy smell. I heard someone shout after me.

I made it back to my apartment building and slammed through the front door, nearly shoulder-checking an old man coming out. He cursed at me. I didn’t stop.

I took the stairs two at a time, my right ear ringing so loud it drowned out everything, and got inside my apartment, locking the deadbolt, then the chain like it was going to matter.

I stood in my living room, chest heaving, and waited.

The pressure in my head didn’t ease.

I walked to my window and looked down at the street.

Across the street, by the bank, a small crowd had gathered.

They were pointing at the gap between the van and the wall. Some had their phones out.

And in the middle of them, standing completely still, was a man in a red windbreaker holding a white plastic bag.

He wasn’t looking at the shadow.

He was looking up.

At my window.

His face wasn’t confused or curious.

It was flat. Like he’d been waiting for this.

He raised his free hand and made a small motion.

Come down.

Or maybe: you shouldn’t have run.

Then he turned and walked away into the crowd, disappearing like he’d never been there.

I looked back at the gap of shadow.

Nothing.

No mouth. No outline. Just daylight and brick and the side of a van.

But the woman’s jar of sauce was still broken on the sidewalk.

The people were still pointing like they couldn’t stop themselves.

My right ear was still bleeding, slow and warm.

I clipped the body camera to my chest and pressed the button until the tiny red light came on.

The muffled roar in my right ear hasn’t stopped.

And I can hear bare feet in my hallway now.

Soft. Steady.

I consumed a lot of junk food. My blood tests are completely fine, and I never had nausea severe enough to bother me. My arms were very thick and maybe they didn’t slim down enough, but I honestly don’t care.

I have a Breville/Sage Dual Boiler. When I try to pull a double shot, after the 7s pre-infusion, the pressure rises even up to 10–10.5 bars, then it drops slightly after a few seconds and stays at 9 bars. If I set the grinder to grind coarser, I manage to get 9 bars, but the extraction time becomes quite short and the coffee turns out rather watery. Is it normal for the pressure to go above 9 bars depending on how fine the grind is, or should it be limited to 9 bars regardless of the coffee dose/prep?



I tried to look for a way to adjust the pressure on the Breville/Sage Dual Boiler, but I couldn’t find anything that seemed trustworthy.



If you have any advice, I’m looking forward to it.

I was at a networking event a while ago, and I left EARLY. Then I ordered coffee, and I STAMMERED. My cousin also wanted to go out for drinks, so I stayed home instead. And I just blocked my first ever best friend in this world 'cause I interpreted something he's been doing as a hint for me to get out of his life. 

Maybe I'm just spending too much time back in my home country after studying abroad that my old habits returned. I'm also pretty overwhelmed from getting stared at and being treated like a foreigner whenever I go outside. 

Buuuut I've come too far to only go this far. Sooo I'm trying to feel like myself again by connecting with people. Hop on a call with me, and let's just talk about anythinggg. I can listen to you yap, too!

Random things about me:

* I have a range of interests, including music, anime, food, and travel
* Learning Spanish so I can move to Spain without telling anyone (except my parents) haha we can practice that if you speak it ('cause I can't)
* Current hyperfixation: Bad Bunny's dance moves!!! Enough said.
* I'm into psychology, self-help, and aesthetically-pleasing things

( i need every seconds detail ?? that what- what you have thought and done on every single second )



can you tell me every single detail of your \`1 cheapest Minute Or your whole hour, day, week, month, year or your whole life ??



if you are not able to tell me about this life then what proof do you have that you didn't forget your past ? and that you will not forget this present life in the future ?



that is Fact that Supreme Lord Krishna exists but we posses no such intelligence to understand him.

there is also next life. and i already proved you that no scientist, no politician, no so-called intelligent man in this world is able to understand this Truth. cuz they are imagining. and you cannot imagine what is god, who is god, what is after life etc.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

for example :Your father existed before your birth. you cannot say that before your birth your father don,t exists.



So you have to ask from mother, ""Who is my father?"" And if she says, ""This gentleman is your father,"" then it is all right. It is easy.

Otherwise, if you makes research, ""Who is my father?"" go on searching for life; you'll never find your father.



( now maybe...maybe you will say that i will search my father from D.N.A, or i will prove it by photo's, or many other thing's which i will get from my mother and prove it that who is my Real father.{ So you have to believe the authority. who is that authority ? she is your mother. you cannot claim of any photo's, D.N.A or many other things without authority ( or ur mother ).



if you will show D.N.A, photo's, and many other proofs from other women then your mother. then what is use of those proofs ??} )



same you have to follow real authority. ""Whatever You have spoken, I accept it,"" Then there is no difficulty. And You are accepted by Devala, Narada, Vyasa, and You are speaking Yourself, and later on, all the acaryas have accepted. Then I'll follow.

I'll have to follow great personalities. The same reason mother says, this gentleman is my father. That's all. Finish business. Where is the necessity of making research? All authorities accept Krsna, the Supreme Personality of Godhead. You accept it; then your searching after God is finished.



Why should you waste your time?

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

all that is you need is to hear from authority ( same like mother ). and i heard this truth from authority "" Srila Prabhupada "" he is my spiritual master.

im not talking these all things from my own.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_



in this world no \`1 can be Peace full. this is all along Fact.



cuz we all are suffering in this world 4 Problems which are Disease, Old age, Death, and Birth after Birth.



tell me are you really happy ?? you can,t be happy if you will ignore these 4 main problem. then still you will be Forced by Nature.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_



if you really want to be happy then follow these 6 Things which are No illicit s.ex, No g.ambling, No d.rugs ( No tea & coffee ), No meat-eating ( No onion & garlic's )



5th thing is whatever you eat \`1st offer it to Supreme Lord Krishna. ( if you know it what is Guru parama-para then offer them food not direct Supreme Lord Krishna )



and 6th "" Main Thing "" is you have to Chant "" hare krishna hare krishna krishna krishna hare hare hare rama hare rama rama rama hare hare "".

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

If your not able to follow these 4 things no illicit s.ex, no g.ambling, no d.rugs, no meat-eating then don,t worry but chanting of this holy name ( Hare Krishna Maha-Mantra ) is very-very and very important.



Chant "" hare krishna hare krishna krishna krishna hare hare hare rama hare rama rama rama hare hare "" and be happy.



if you still don,t believe on me then chant any other name for 5 Min's and chant this holy name for 5 Min's and you will see effect. i promise you it works And chanting at least 16 rounds ( each round of 108 beads ) of the Hare Krishna maha-mantra daily.

Here is no Question of Holy Books quotes, Personal Experiences, Faith or Belief. i accept that Sometimes Faith is also Blind. Here is already Practical explanation which already proved that every\`1 else in this world is nothing more then Busy Foolish and totally idiot.

I just hung up on a trapped employee because I couldn’t handle what he was telling me.,"It is three in the morning now, and the silence in the lobby is so heavy it feels like it has mass. It presses against the glass revolving doors, against the marble of the reception desk, against my chest. I am sitting here, staring at the phone unit on the console, my hand hovering over the receiver, shaking. I know I should pick it up. I know the light blinking on line four represents a human life, or at least the echo of one. But I can’t do it. I can’t listen to him scream anymore. I can’t listen to him describe the things that are looking in through the windows of the fortieth floor.

I need to write this down. I need to structure it, to force some kind of logic onto the last four hours, because if I don’t, I think my mind is going to fracture. I need someone to tell me that I did the right thing. Or, if I didn't, I need someone to tell me that there was nothing else I could have done.

I’ve been working the graveyard shift at this building for five years. It’s a corporate monolith, one of those faceless steel and glass needles that pierces the skyline of the city. It houses insurance firms, hedge funds, legal consultants—the kind of businesses that deal in abstract wealth and churn through young analysts like coal in a furnace. My job is simple: I sit at the front desk, I monitor the bank of CCTV screens, I do a patrol every two hours, and I make sure that anyone who enters after 8:00 PM signs the logbook.

Usually, the building is dead by midnight. The cleaners finish up around 11:00 PM, and the last of the workaholic executives drift out shortly after, looking grey and exhausted, barely nodding to me as they push through the turnstiles. I like the solitude. I like the way the city looks from the lobby windows—a grid of amber streetlights and rain-slicked asphalt, quiet and predictable.

Tonight started exactly like every other night. The rain began around 9:00 PM, a steady, rhythmic drumming against the glass that usually helps me focus. I made my coffee. I settled in with a paperback. I checked the logbook.

That was the first anomaly, though I didn't think much of it at the time.

The logbook is a physical record, a redundancy in case the electronic badge system fails. Everyone signs in; everyone signs out. When I ran my finger down the list of today's entries, I saw a jagged scrawl near the bottom.

08:00 AM – Junior Analyst – Floor 40.

There was no sign-out time.

It happens. People forget. They rush out to catch a train, or they leave through the parking garage and bypass the lobby desk entirely. I figured the guy was long gone, home in bed, sleeping off an eighty-hour work week. I made a mental note to check the fortieth floor during my patrol, just to ensure the lights were off and the coffee machines were unplugged.

I went back to my book. The lobby hummed with the low, subterranean vibration of the HVAC system. On the monitors, the elevators sat idle, their doors closed. The stairwells were empty concrete tubes. The loading dock was dark.

The phone rang at 11:42 PM.

It startled me. The desk phone rarely rings at night unless it’s the monitoring company doing a line check or my supervisor checking if I’m asleep. I picked it up, expecting a robotic voice or the gruff tone of my boss.

""Security,"" I said.

""You have to open the doors.""

The voice was tight, high-pitched, and trembling. It was a man’s voice, but stripped of any masculine cadence by pure panic.

I sat up straighter, my instincts shifting from 'bored' to 'alert'. ""Who is this? Where are you calling from?""

""I’m on forty,"" the voice snapped, cracking on the last syllable. ""I’m in the analyst pen. I tried the elevators but they won’t come. I tried the stairwell but the door won’t open. The fob isn't working. You have to unlock the lockdown. Please, just unlock the damn building.""

I looked at the console. The call was indeed coming from an internal extension on the fortieth floor. I checked my monitors. Monitor 4, which cycled through the upper floors, showed the fortieth-floor lobby. It was dark, illuminated only by the green glow of the exit signs. Nothing was moving.

""Sir, take a breath,"" I said, keeping my voice calm. ""There is no lockdown. The building is in standard night mode. The stairwell doors are fire-safe; they open from the inside automatically. You just have to push the bar.""

""I pushed the bar!"" he screamed. The sound distorted in the receiver, hurting my ear. ""I slammed my shoulder into it! It’s jammed. It’s fused shut. And the elevators... the buttons are dead. I’m trapped in here. You don't understand, I can’t be in here. Not with what’s happening outside.""

""What’s happening outside?"" I asked, swiveling my chair to look out the massive floor-to-ceiling windows of the lobby.

Outside, the street was empty. A taxi cruised by slowly, its wipers slapping back and forth. The rain fell in sheets, illuminated by the streetlamps. It was a peaceful, wet Tuesday night.

""They’re destroying the city,"" the man said, his voice dropping to a terrified whisper. ""I looked out the north window. The bridge is gone. They just... they stepped on it. It collapsed like it was made of toothpicks. I saw cars falling into the river. I saw the fires.""

I frowned, pressing the phone closer to my ear. ""Sir, I’m looking out the window right now. The street is fine. It’s just raining.""

""You’re not looking,"" he hissed. ""You’re not looking high enough. They are walking between the buildings. Oh god, the sound. Can’t you hear the sound? It’s like... like wet leather slapping against concrete, but loud enough to shake the floor.""

""Who is 'they'?"" I asked, my patience beginning to fray. I had dealt with drunks before, and I had dealt with employees having mental breakdowns from stress. This sounded like a psychotic break. A bad one actually.

""The things,"" he wept. ""The massive... I don't know what they are. They have four legs. Long, spindly legs like a spider, but they move like an octopus. They’re tall. They’re taller than the hotel across the street. I saw one of them reach down and pick up a bus. It just picked it up and crushed it. Please. You have to get me out. I’m hiding under my desk but I think they can sense the heat. I think they’re hunting.""

I rubbed my temples. ""Okay. Listen to me. Give me your name.""

He gave it to me. It matched the name in the logbook. The Junior Analyst.

""Okay,"" I said. ""I’m going to come up there. I’m going to bring the elevator up, and we’re going to walk out of here together. Just stay on the line, or stay at your desk. I’ll be there in five minutes.""

""Hurry,"" he sobbed. ""Please hurry. The ground is shaking. I can feel the vibrations in my teeth.""

I put the phone on hold. I stood up and walked to the glass doors of the lobby. I pushed them open and stepped out into the cool night air.

I looked up. I scanned the skyline.

There was nothing. The skyscrapers stood tall and rigid, their aircraft warning lights blinking rhythmically against the clouds. The bridge in the distance was intact, headlights moving across it in a steady stream. There were no fires. There were no four-legged giants. There was no sound of ""wet leather"" or crumbling concrete. Just the hiss of tires on wet pavement and the distant wail of a siren, miles away.

He was hallucinating. Drugs, maybe? Or a gas leak on the fortieth floor? Carbon monoxide could cause hallucinations.

That thought sobered me up. If there was a gas leak, he was in actual danger, just not from giant monsters.

I went back inside, grabbed my master key card, my flashlight, and the portable radio. I locked the front desk console and headed for the elevators.

I stepped into Car 3, the service elevator, because it was the fastest. I punched the button for 40. The doors slid shut, sealing me in the mirrored box. As the elevator began to ascend, my ears popped.

I watched the floor numbers tick up. 10... 20... 30...

The elevator in this building is a glass capsule on the exterior wall for the first twenty floors, then it enters the internal shaft. For those first few seconds, I watched the city recede below me. It was perfectly normal. The world was intact. The man on the phone was having a severe episode. I rehearsed what I would say to him. I’d be calm, authoritative. I’d get him downstairs, call the paramedics, and let the professionals handle it.

The elevator dinged at the 40th floor.

The doors slid open.

The floor was dark, as I expected. The air was stale and recycled, smelling faintly of carpet cleaner and ozone. It was dead silent.

""Hello?"" I called out. My voice echoed down the long corridor of cubicles. ""Security. I’m here.""

I stepped out of the elevator, my flashlight beam cutting a cone through the gloom. The shadows of office chairs and monitors stretched out across the grey carpet, looking like jagged teeth.

""Sir?"" I yelled louder.

No answer.

I keyed my radio. ""Central, this is Mobile One. I’m on forty. No sign of disturbance. Proceeding to the north quadrant."" I was talking to myself, really—recording it for the tapes.

I walked down the main aisle. The cubicles were messy, cluttered with the detritus of high-stress finance. Stacks of paper, half-empty coffee cups, stress balls.

""I’m looking for the analyst,"" I said, trying to project confidence. ""Come on out. The building is safe. I checked outside. There’s nothing there.""

I reached the north side of the floor, the area with the windows overlooking the river—the view he had described.

I shone my flashlight around. ""Sir?""

""I’m here!""

The voice didn't come from the room. It came from my radio.

I jumped, nearly dropping the flashlight. I grabbed the radio on my belt. ""I hear you. Where are you? I’m on the north side, near the windows.""

""I’m right in front of you!"" the voice screamed through the static of the walkie-talkie. ""I’m standing right in front of you! Why aren't you looking at me?""

I swept the flashlight beam back and forth. The light washed over empty desks, ergonomic chairs, and a whiteboard covered in equations.

""I don't see you,"" I said, a cold prickle of unease starting at the base of my spine. ""Come out from behind the desk.""

""I am standing right here!"" he shrieked. ""You’re looking right through me! Are you blind? Stop playing games! Open the goddamn stairwell!""

I spun in a circle. ""Sir, there is no one here. I am the only person on this floor.""

""You’re lying!""

And then, the chair moved.

It was a heavy, expensive executive chair, sitting behind a mahogany desk about ten feet away from me. As I watched, it spun violently, as if someone had kicked it. It rolled across the floor with a harsh rumble of wheels on hard plastic, slamming into a filing cabinet with a deafening clang.

I froze. My heart hammered against my ribs. ""Who’s there?""

""I told you I’m here!"" the voice on the radio sobbed.

Suddenly, a stapler lifted off a nearby desk. It didn't float; it launched. It flew through the air with the velocity of a fastball and smashed into the pillar right next to my head. A ceramic mug followed, shattering against the wall and showering me with shards of pottery.

""Stop it!"" I yelled, backing away, raising my hands to protect my face. ""Come out!""

""Why won't you help me?"" the radio voice screamed.

A stack of files erupted into the air, papers fluttering down like snow. A heavy hole-puncher slid across a table and fell to the floor with a thud. The entire room seemed to be convulsing, objects reacting to an invisible rage.

""I can't see you!"" I shouted, retreating toward the elevator. ""I don't know where you are!""

""I'm grabbing your arm!"" the voice cried. ""I'm holding your arm right now!""

I looked down at my left arm. There was nothing there. But as I watched, the fabric of my uniform sleeve depressed. It indented, five distinct points of pressure, fingers digging into my bicep. I felt the pressure—cold, firm, desperate.

I screamed. I couldn't help it. I yanked my arm away, stumbling backward. The sensation of the grip broke, but the visual imprint on my sleeve remained for a second before smoothing out.

""Get away from me!"" I yelled.

""Why are you doing this?"" he wept. ""They’re coming! The vibrations are getting stronger!""

I didn't wait. I turned and ran. I ran back down the main aisle, dodging the invisible force that was throwing wastebaskets and pens in my path. I reached the elevator bank and slammed my hand against the call button.

""Don't leave me!"" the radio crackled.

""You’re not real,"" I whispered, hyperventilating. ""This is a prank. You’re... you’re a ghost. I don’t know what this is.""

The elevator doors opened. I threw myself inside and hammered the 'Lobby' button.

As the doors began to slide shut, I looked back into the dark corridor.

A fire extinguisher was lifted off its wall hook. It hovered in the air for a split second, suspended by nothing, and then hurled itself toward the elevator. It struck the closing doors with a massive metallic gong sound, denting the metal from the outside just as the seal closed.

The elevator descended. I collapsed against the mirrored wall, sliding down to the floor, gasping for air. My mind was reeling. I had seen the objects move. I had felt the hand. But there was no one there.

I needed the police. I needed a priest. I needed to get out of this building.

When the elevator opened in the lobby, I scrambled out, practically crawling over the reception desk to get behind the safety of the glass partition. I grabbed the landline to dial 911.

The phone rang before I could dial.

Line four.

I stared at it.

It rang again.

I picked it up slowly. ""Hello?""

""You left me.""

The voice was unrecognizable now. It was a deep, guttural despair mixed with a fury that chilled my blood.

""I... I couldn't see you,"" I stammered. ""I don't know what kind of trick this is, but you were invisible. You were throwing things at me.""

""I was throwing things to get your attention!"" he screamed. ""I was screaming in your face! I grabbed your arm and you looked at me like I was air! You looked right through me with those dead, stupid eyes and you ran away!""

""I'm calling the police,"" I said. ""They can handle this.""

""The police?"" He laughed, a wet, hysterical sound. ""What are the police going to do? Shoot the Behemoth? It doesn't matter. It’s too late for the stairs now. It’s here.""

""What is here?"" I whispered.

""The big one,"" he said. His voice went quiet, trembling. ""It was watching me. When you came up... I think the light from your flashlight... I think it saw the light. It turned. It stopped crushing the parking garage and it turned toward the tower.""

I looked at the monitors. The exterior cameras showed rain. Empty streets. Peace.

""There is nothing outside,"" I said, clinging to my reality like a lifeline. ""I am looking at the cameras. It is a quiet night.""

"" I don't know anymore. But I can see it. It’s climbing the building. It’s wrapping its legs around the structure. The glass is starting to crack on the thirty-eighth floor. I can hear it popping.""

""Sir, stop it.""

""It’s huge,"" he whispered. ""Its skin is like oil. It has... oh god, it has thousands of eyes. Little milky eyes all along the tentacles. And it’s coming up. It’s looking for the food inside the metal box.""

""There are no monsters,"" I said, squeezing my eyes shut. ""I went up there. The floor was empty. You are having a delusion.""

""If I'm having a delusion,"" he asked, his voice trembling with a terrifying clarity, ""then how did I hold your arm?""

I looked down at my bicep. I rolled up my sleeve.

Five distinct, purple bruises were forming on my skin. The shape of a hand.

""I..."" I couldn't speak.

""It’s at the window,"" he said abruptly. The line filled with a sound—a low, resonant thrumming, like a cello bow being dragged across a suspension cable. ""It’s looking in. It’s pressing its face against the glass. The glass is bowing inward. It’s going to break.""

""Hide,"" I whispered. ""Just hide.""

""There’s nowhere to hide,"" he said. "" It’s looking right at me. It’s raising a leg. It’s going to—""

CRACK.

The sound came through the phone, sharp and violent, like a gunshot. It was followed by the sound of shattering glass—tons of it, cascading down like a waterfall.

""NO!"" he screamed. ""NO! GET BACK! GET BACK!""

I heard the wind roaring through the receiver. I heard the sound of furniture being sucked out, or crushed. And then I heard a noise that defied description. It was a wet, sucking sound, followed by a crunch that sounded like wet celery being snapped, but amplified a thousand times.

The screaming stopped instantly.

Then, there was just the sound of the wind, and a heavy, slithering movement. A wet, dragging sound against the carpet.

""Hello?"" I whispered. ""Sir?""

Silence. Then, a chittering noise. Clicking. Like the mandibles of an insect the size of a van.

I slammed the phone down.

I sat there for a minute, staring at the receiver. My heart was beating so fast I thought I was going to pass out.

I looked at the monitors.

Monitor 4. The fortieth-floor lobby camera.

It flickered. The image distorted, static rolling across the screen.

And then, for just a fraction of a second, I saw it.

It was... superimposed. Like a double exposure.

I saw the lobby I knew—clean, empty, dark.

But through it, like a ghost image, I saw something else. I saw the walls buckled inward. I saw the ceiling torn open to a sky that wasn't black, but a burning, sickly violet. And filling the corridor was a mass of dark, glistening flesh, a tentacle as thick as a redwood tree dragging itself over the ruined carpet, pulping the reception desk into splinters.

Then the monitor flashed black.

I haven't moved since.

The phone rang again five minutes ago. I didn't answer it.

It rang again two minutes ago. I stared at it until it stopped.

I looked at the logbook again. Junior Analyst. 8:00 AM.

I sat up straighter, my instincts shifting from 'bored' to 'alert'. ""Who is this? Where are you calling from?""

""I’m on forty,"" the voice snapped, cracking on the last syllable. ""I’m in the analyst pen. I tried the elevators but they won’t come. I tried the stairwell but the door won’t open. The fob isn't working. You have to unlock the lockdown. Please, just unlock the damn building.""

I looked at the console. The call was indeed coming from an internal extension on the fortieth floor. I checked my monitors. Monitor 4, which cycled through the upper floors, showed the fortieth-floor lobby. It was dark, illuminated only by the green glow of the exit signs. Nothing was moving.

""Sir, take a breath,"" I said, keeping my voice calm. ""There is no lockdown. The building is in standard night mode. The stairwell doors are fire-safe; they open from the inside automatically. You just have to push the bar.""

""I pushed the bar!"" he screamed. The sound distorted in the receiver, hurting my ear. ""I slammed my shoulder into it! It’s jammed. It’s fused shut. And the elevators... the buttons are dead. I’m trapped in here. You don't understand, I can’t be in here. Not with what’s happening outside.""

""What’s happening outside?"" I asked, swiveling my chair to look out the massive floor-to-ceiling windows of the lobby.

Outside, the street was empty. A taxi cruised by slowly, its wipers slapping back and forth. The rain fell in sheets, illuminated by the streetlamps. It was a peaceful, wet Tuesday night.

""They’re destroying the city,"" the man said, his voice dropping to a terrified whisper. ""I looked out the north window. The bridge is gone. They just... they stepped on it. It collapsed like it was made of toothpicks. I saw cars falling into the river. I saw the fires.""

I frowned, pressing the phone closer to my ear. ""Sir, I’m looking out the window right now. The street is fine. It’s just raining.""

""You’re not looking,"" he hissed. ""You’re not looking high enough. They are walking between the buildings. Oh god, the sound. Can’t you hear the sound? It’s like... like wet leather slapping against concrete, but loud enough to shake the floor.""

""Who is 'they'?"" I asked, my patience beginning to fray. I had dealt with drunks before, and I had dealt with employees having mental breakdowns from stress. This sounded like a psychotic break. A bad one actually.

""The things,"" he wept. ""The massive... I don't know what they are. They have four legs. Long, spindly legs like a spider, but they move like an octopus. They’re tall. They’re taller than the hotel across the street. I saw one of them reach down and pick up a bus. It just picked it up and crushed it. Please. You have to get me out. I’m hiding under my desk but I think they can sense the heat. I think they’re hunting.""

I rubbed my temples. ""Okay. Listen to me. Give me your name.""

He gave it to me. It matched the name in the logbook. The Junior Analyst.

""Okay,"" I said. ""I’m going to come up there. I’m going to bring the elevator up, and we’re going to walk out of here together. Just stay on the line, or stay at your desk. I’ll be there in five minutes.""

""Hurry,"" he sobbed. ""Please hurry. The ground is shaking. I can feel the vibrations in my teeth.""

I put the phone on hold. I stood up and walked to the glass doors of the lobby. I pushed them open and stepped out into the cool night air.

I looked up. I scanned the skyline.

There was nothing. The skyscrapers stood tall and rigid, their aircraft warning lights blinking rhythmically against the clouds. The bridge in the distance was intact, headlights moving across it in a steady stream. There were no fires. There were no four-legged giants. There was no sound of ""wet leather"" or crumbling concrete. Just the hiss of tires on wet pavement and the distant wail of a siren, miles away.

He was hallucinating. Drugs, maybe? Or a gas leak on the fortieth floor? Carbon monoxide could cause hallucinations.

That thought sobered me up. If there was a gas leak, he was in actual danger, just not from giant monsters.

I went back inside, grabbed my master key card, my flashlight, and the portable radio. I locked the front desk console and headed for the elevators.

I stepped into Car 3, the service elevator, because it was the fastest. I punched the button for 40. The doors slid shut, sealing me in the mirrored box. As the elevator began to ascend, my ears popped.

I watched the floor numbers tick up. 10... 20... 30...

The elevator in this building is a glass capsule on the exterior wall for the first twenty floors, then it enters the internal shaft. For those first few seconds, I watched the city recede below me. It was perfectly normal. The world was intact. The man on the phone was having a severe episode. I rehearsed what I would say to him. I’d be calm, authoritative. I’d get him downstairs, call the paramedics, and let the professionals handle it.

The elevator dinged at the 40th floor.

The doors slid open.

The floor was dark, as I expected. The air was stale and recycled, smelling faintly of carpet cleaner and ozone. It was dead silent.

""Hello?"" I called out. My voice echoed down the long corridor of cubicles. ""Security. I’m here.""

I stepped out of the elevator, my flashlight beam cutting a cone through the gloom. The shadows of office chairs and monitors stretched out across the grey carpet, looking like jagged teeth.

""Sir?"" I yelled louder.

No answer.

I keyed my radio. ""Central, this is Mobile One. I’m on forty. No sign of disturbance. Proceeding to the north quadrant."" I was talking to myself, really—recording it for the tapes.

I walked down the main aisle. The cubicles were messy, cluttered with the detritus of high-stress finance. Stacks of paper, half-empty coffee cups, stress balls.

""I’m looking for the analyst,"" I said, trying to project confidence. ""Come on out. The building is safe. I checked outside. There’s nothing there.""

I reached the north side of the floor, the area with the windows overlooking the river—the view he had described.

I shone my flashlight around. ""Sir?""

""I’m here!""

The voice didn't come from the room. It came from my radio.

I jumped, nearly dropping the flashlight. I grabbed the radio on my belt. ""I hear you. Where are you? I’m on the north side, near the windows.""

""I’m right in front of you!"" the voice screamed through the static of the walkie-talkie. ""I’m standing right in front of you! Why aren't you looking at me?""

I swept the flashlight beam back and forth. The light washed over empty desks, ergonomic chairs, and a whiteboard covered in equations.

""I don't see you,"" I said, a cold prickle of unease starting at the base of my spine. ""Come out from behind the desk.""

""I am standing right here!"" he shrieked. ""You’re looking right through me! Are you blind? Stop playing games! Open the goddamn stairwell!""

I spun in a circle. ""Sir, there is no one here. I am the only person on this floor.""

""You’re lying!""

And then, the chair moved.

It was a heavy, expensive executive chair, sitting behind a mahogany desk about ten feet away from me. As I watched, it spun violently, as if someone had kicked it. It rolled across the floor with a harsh rumble of wheels on hard plastic, slamming into a filing cabinet with a deafening clang.

I froze. My heart hammered against my ribs. ""Who’s there?""

""I told you I’m here!"" the voice on the radio sobbed.

Suddenly, a stapler lifted off a nearby desk. It didn't float; it launched. It flew through the air with the velocity of a fastball and smashed into the pillar right next to my head. A ceramic mug followed, shattering against the wall and showering me with shards of pottery.

""Stop it!"" I yelled, backing away, raising my hands to protect my face. ""Come out!""

""Why won't you help me?"" the radio voice screamed.

A stack of files erupted into the air, papers fluttering down like snow. A heavy hole-puncher slid across a table and fell to the floor with a thud. The entire room seemed to be convulsing, objects reacting to an invisible rage.

""I can't see you!"" I shouted, retreating toward the elevator. ""I don't know where you are!""

""I'm grabbing your arm!"" the voice cried. ""I'm holding your arm right now!""

I looked down at my left arm. There was nothing there. But as I watched, the fabric of my uniform sleeve depressed. It indented, five distinct points of pressure, fingers digging into my bicep. I felt the pressure—cold, firm, desperate.

I screamed. I couldn't help it. I yanked my arm away, stumbling backward. The sensation of the grip broke, but the visual imprint on my sleeve remained for a second before smoothing out.

""Get away from me!"" I yelled.

""Why are you doing this?"" he wept. ""They’re coming! The vibrations are getting stronger!""

I didn't wait. I turned and ran. I ran back down the main aisle, dodging the invisible force that was throwing wastebaskets and pens in my path. I reached the elevator bank and slammed my hand against the call button.

""Don't leave me!"" the radio crackled.

""You’re not real,"" I whispered, hyperventilating. ""This is a prank. You’re... you’re a ghost. I don’t know what this is.""

The elevator doors opened. I threw myself inside and hammered the 'Lobby' button.

As the doors began to slide shut, I looked back into the dark corridor.

A fire extinguisher was lifted off its wall hook. It hovered in the air for a split second, suspended by nothing, and then hurled itself toward the elevator. It struck the closing doors with a massive metallic gong sound, denting the metal from the outside just as the seal closed.

The elevator descended. I collapsed against the mirrored wall, sliding down to the floor, gasping for air. My mind was reeling. I had seen the objects move. I had felt the hand. But there was no one there.

I needed the police. I needed a priest. I needed to get out of this building.

When the elevator opened in the lobby, I scrambled out, practically crawling over the reception desk to get behind the safety of the glass partition. I grabbed the landline to dial 911.

The phone rang before I could dial.

Line four.

I stared at it.

It rang again.

I picked it up slowly. ""Hello?""

""You left me.""

The voice was unrecognizable now. It was a deep, guttural despair mixed with a fury that chilled my blood.

""I... I couldn't see you,"" I stammered. ""I don't know what kind of trick this is, but you were invisible. You were throwing things at me.""

""I was throwing things to get your attention!"" he screamed. ""I was screaming in your face! I grabbed your arm and you looked at me like I was air! You looked right through me with those dead, stupid eyes and you ran away!""

""I'm calling the police,"" I said. ""They can handle this.""

""The police?"" He laughed, a wet, hysterical sound. ""What are the police going to do? Shoot the Behemoth? It doesn't matter. It’s too late for the stairs now. It’s here.""

""What is here?"" I whispered.

""The big one,"" he said. His voice went quiet, trembling. ""It was watching me. When you came up... I think the light from your flashlight... I think it saw the light. It turned. It stopped crushing the parking garage and it turned toward the tower.""

I looked at the monitors. The exterior cameras showed rain. Empty streets. Peace.

""There is nothing outside,"" I said, clinging to my reality like a lifeline. ""I am looking at the cameras. It is a quiet night.""

"" I don't know anymore. But I can see it. It’s climbing the building. It’s wrapping its legs around the structure. The glass is starting to crack on the thirty-eighth floor. I can hear it popping.""

""Sir, stop it.""

""It’s huge,"" he whispered. ""Its skin is like oil. It has... oh god, it has thousands of eyes. Little milky eyes all along the tentacles. And it’s coming up. It’s looking for the food inside the metal box.""

""There are no monsters,"" I said, squeezing my eyes shut. ""I went up there. The floor was empty. You are having a delusion.""

""If I'm having a delusion,"" he asked, his voice trembling with a terrifying clarity, ""then how did I hold your arm?""

I looked down at my bicep. I rolled up my sleeve.

Five distinct, purple bruises were forming on my skin. The shape of a hand.

""I..."" I couldn't speak.

""It’s at the window,"" he said abruptly. The line filled with a sound—a low, resonant thrumming, like a cello bow being dragged across a suspension cable. ""It’s looking in. It’s pressing its face against the glass. The glass is bowing inward. It’s going to break.""

""Hide,"" I whispered. ""Just hide.""

""There’s nowhere to hide,"" he said. "" It’s looking right at me. It’s raising a leg. It’s going to—""

CRACK.

The sound came through the phone, sharp and violent, like a gunshot. It was followed by the sound of shattering glass—tons of it, cascading down like a waterfall.

""NO!"" he screamed. ""NO! GET BACK! GET BACK!""

I heard the wind roaring through the receiver. I heard the sound of furniture being sucked out, or crushed. And then I heard a noise that defied description. It was a wet, sucking sound, followed by a crunch that sounded like wet celery being snapped, but amplified a thousand times.

The screaming stopped instantly.

Then, there was just the sound of the wind, and a heavy, slithering movement. A wet, dragging sound against the carpet.

""Hello?"" I whispered. ""Sir?""

Silence. Then, a chittering noise. Clicking. Like the mandibles of an insect the size of a van.

I slammed the phone down.

I sat there for a minute, staring at the receiver. My heart was beating so fast I thought I was going to pass out.

I looked at the monitors.

Monitor 4. The fortieth-floor lobby camera.

It flickered. The image distorted, static rolling across the screen.

And then, for just a fraction of a second, I saw it.

It was... superimposed. Like a double exposure.

I saw the lobby I knew—clean, empty, dark.

But through it, like a ghost image, I saw something else. I saw the walls buckled inward. I saw the ceiling torn open to a sky that wasn't black, but a burning, sickly violet. And filling the corridor was a mass of dark, glistening flesh, a tentacle as thick as a redwood tree dragging itself over the ruined carpet, pulping the reception desk into splinters.

Then the monitor flashed black.

I haven't moved since.

The phone rang again five minutes ago. I didn't answer it.

It rang again two minutes ago. I stared at it until it stopped.

I looked at the logbook again. Junior Analyst. 8:00 AM.

I just hung up on a trapped employee because I couldn’t handle what he was telling me.,"It is three in the morning now, and the silence in the lobby is so heavy it feels like it has mass. It presses against the glass revolving doors, against the marble of the reception desk, against my chest. I am sitting here, staring at the phone unit on the console, my hand hovering over the receiver, shaking. I know I should pick it up. I know the light blinking on line four represents a human life, or at least the echo of one. But I can’t do it. I can’t listen to him scream anymore. I can’t listen to him describe the things that are looking in through the windows of the fortieth floor.

I need to write this down. I need to structure it, to force some kind of logic onto the last four hours, because if I don’t, I think my mind is going to fracture. I need someone to tell me that I did the right thing. Or, if I didn't, I need someone to tell me that there was nothing else I could have done.

I’ve been working the graveyard shift at this building for five years. It’s a corporate monolith, one of those faceless steel and glass needles that pierces the skyline of the city. It houses insurance firms, hedge funds, legal consultants—the kind of businesses that deal in abstract wealth and churn through young analysts like coal in a furnace. My job is simple: I sit at the front desk, I monitor the bank of CCTV screens, I do a patrol every two hours, and I make sure that anyone who enters after 8:00 PM signs the logbook.

Usually, the building is dead by midnight. The cleaners finish up around 11:00 PM, and the last of the workaholic executives drift out shortly after, looking grey and exhausted, barely nodding to me as they push through the turnstiles. I like the solitude. I like the way the city looks from the lobby windows—a grid of amber streetlights and rain-slicked asphalt, quiet and predictable.

Tonight started exactly like every other night. The rain began around 9:00 PM, a steady, rhythmic drumming against the glass that usually helps me focus. I made my coffee. I settled in with a paperback. I checked the logbook.

That was the first anomaly, though I didn't think much of it at the time.

The logbook is a physical record, a redundancy in case the electronic badge system fails. Everyone signs in; everyone signs out. When I ran my finger down the list of today's entries, I saw a jagged scrawl near the bottom.

08:00 AM – Junior Analyst – Floor 40.

There was no sign-out time.

It happens. People forget. They rush out to catch a train, or they leave through the parking garage and bypass the lobby desk entirely. I figured the guy was long gone, home in bed, sleeping off an eighty-hour work week. I made a mental note to check the fortieth floor during my patrol, just to ensure the lights were off and the coffee machines were unplugged.

I went back to my book. The lobby hummed with the low, subterranean vibration of the HVAC system. On the monitors, the elevators sat idle, their doors closed. The stairwells were empty concrete tubes. The loading dock was dark.

The phone rang at 11:42 PM.

It startled me. The desk phone rarely rings at night unless it’s the monitoring company doing a line check or my supervisor checking if I’m asleep. I picked it up, expecting a robotic voice or the gruff tone of my boss.

""Security,"" I said.

""You have to open the doors.""

The voice was tight, high-pitched, and trembling. It was a man’s voice, but stripped of any masculine cadence by pure panic.

I sat up straighter, my instincts shifting from 'bored' to 'alert'. ""Who is this? Where are you calling from?""

""I’m on forty,"" the voice snapped, cracking on the last syllable. ""I’m in the analyst pen. I tried the elevators but they won’t come. I tried the stairwell but the door won’t open. The fob isn't working. You have to unlock the lockdown. Please, just unlock the damn building.""

I looked at the console. The call was indeed coming from an internal extension on the fortieth floor. I checked my monitors. Monitor 4, which cycled through the upper floors, showed the fortieth-floor lobby. It was dark, illuminated only by the green glow of the exit signs. Nothing was moving.

""What’s happening outside?"" I asked, swiveling my chair to look out the massive floor-to-ceiling windows of the lobby.

Outside, the street was empty. A taxi cruised by slowly, its wipers slapping back and forth. The rain fell in sheets, illuminated by the streetlamps. It was a peaceful, wet Tuesday night.

""They’re destroying the city,"" the man said, his voice dropping to a terrified whisper. ""I looked out the north window. The bridge is gone. They just... they stepped on it. It collapsed like it was made of toothpicks. I saw cars falling into the river. I saw the fires.""

""Hurry,"" he sobbed. ""Please hurry. The ground is shaking. I can feel the vibrations in my teeth.""

I put the phone on hold. I stood up and walked to the glass doors of the lobby. I pushed them open and stepped out into the cool night air.

I looked up. I scanned the skyline.

There was nothing. The skyscrapers stood tall and rigid, their aircraft warning lights blinking rhythmically against the clouds.

The elevator doors opened. I threw myself inside and hammered the 'Lobby' button.

As the doors began to slide shut, I looked back into the dark corridor.

A fire extinguisher was lifted off its wall hook. It hovered in the air for a split second, suspended by nothing, and then hurled itself toward the elevator. It struck the closing doors with a massive metallic gong sound, denting the metal from the outside just as the seal closed.

""There are no monsters,"" I said, squeezing my eyes shut. ""I went up there. The floor was empty. You are having a delusion.""

""If I'm having a delusion,"" he asked, his voice trembling with a terrifying clarity, ""then how did I hold your arm?""

I looked down at my bicep. I rolled up my sleeve.

Five distinct, purple bruises were forming on my skin. The shape of a hand.

""I..."" I couldn't speak.

""It’s at the window,"" he said abruptly. The line filled with a sound—a low, resonant thrumming, like a cello bow being dragged across a suspension cable. ""It’s looking in. It’s pressing its face against the glass. The glass is bowing inward. It’s going to break.""

""Hide,"" I whispered. ""Just hide.""

""There’s nowhere to hide,"" he said. "" It’s looking right at me. It’s raising a leg. It’s going to—""

CRACK.

The sound came through the phone, sharp and violent, like a gunshot. It was followed by the sound of shattering glass—tons of it, cascading down like a waterfall.

""NO!"" he screamed. ""NO! GET BACK! GET BACK!""

I heard the wind roaring through the receiver. I heard the sound of furniture being sucked out, or crushed. And then I heard a noise that defied description. It was a wet, sucking sound, followed by a crunch that sounded like wet celery being snapped, but amplified a thousand times.

The screaming stopped instantly.

Then, there was just the sound of the wind, and a heavy, slithering movement. A wet, dragging sound against the carpet.

""Hello?"" I whispered. ""Sir?""

Silence. Then, a chittering noise. Clicking. Like the mandibles of an insect the size of a van.

I slammed the phone down.

I sat there for a minute, staring at the receiver. My heart was beating so fast I thought I was going to pass out.

I looked at the monitors.

Monitor 4. The fortieth-floor lobby camera.

It flickered. The image distorted, static rolling across the screen.

And then, for just a fraction of a second, I saw it.

It was... superimposed. Like a double exposure.

I saw the lobby I knew—clean, empty, dark.

But through it, like a ghost image, I saw something else. I saw the walls buckled inward. I saw the ceiling torn open to a sky that wasn't black, but a burning, sickly violet. And filling the corridor was a mass of dark, glistening flesh, a tentacle as thick as a redwood tree dragging itself over the ruined carpet, pulping the reception desk into splinters.

Then the monitor flashed black.

I haven't moved since.

The phone rang again five minutes ago. I didn't answer it.

It rang again two minutes ago. I stared at it until it stopped.

I looked at the logbook again. Junior Analyst. 8:00 AM.

Does anyone miss when they were just acoustic?,"I get that some people like live music on the streets (and actually stop and watch and donate), but realistically the vast majority of people walking on the streets just seem indifferent to them. 

That was grand when most buskers were playing acoustic instruments in their section. 

But it seems they are getting louder and louder? More amps. More drums. It all seems unnecessarily loud? 

Like there’s one guy playing live drums, singing in a microphone with an amp, while karaoke backing instruments play on a speaker. You can not only hear him at the next buskers spot where a guy is playing an electric guitar and singing in a microphone, but you can hear hear them both at the 3rd buskers pitch where a guy is on an acoustic guitar. So it’s a cacophony of different songs that can all be heard simultaneously. 

We were sitting at a cafe having a coffee and the guy with the drums set up and a bunch of people left due to the volume. Earlier in the day we were in a sports shop and the staff were being drive demented by another guy banging on a drum shouting at “pretty girls” as they walked past.

I just hung up on a trapped employee because I couldn’t handle what he was telling me.,"It is three in the morning now, and the silence in the lobby is so heavy it feels like it has mass. It presses against the glass revolving doors, against the marble of the reception desk, against my chest. I am sitting here, staring at the phone unit on the console, my hand hovering over the receiver, shaking. I know I should pick it up. I know the light blinking on line four represents a human life, or at least the echo of one. But I can’t do it. I can’t listen to him scream anymore. I can’t listen to him describe the things that are looking in through the windows of the fortieth floor.

I need to write this down. I need to structure it, to force some kind of logic onto the last four hours, because if I don’t, I think my mind is going to fracture. I need someone to tell me that I did the right thing. Or, if I didn't, I need someone to tell me that there was nothing else I could have done.

I’ve been working the graveyard shift at this building for five years. It’s a corporate monolith, one of those faceless steel and glass needles that pierces the skyline of the city. It houses insurance firms, hedge funds, legal consultants—the kind of businesses that deal in abstract wealth and churn through young analysts like coal in a furnace. My job is simple: I sit at the front desk, I monitor the bank of CCTV screens, I do a patrol every two hours, and I make sure that anyone who enters after 8:00 PM signs the logbook.

Usually, the building is dead by midnight. The cleaners finish up around 11:00 PM, and the last of the workaholic executives drift out shortly after, looking grey and exhausted, barely nodding to me as they push through the turnstiles. I like the solitude. I like the way the city looks from the lobby windows—a grid of amber streetlights and rain-slicked asphalt, quiet and predictable.

Tonight started exactly like every other night. The rain began around 9:00 PM, a steady, rhythmic drumming against the glass that usually helps me focus. I made my coffee. I settled in with a paperback. I checked the logbook.

That was the first anomaly, though I didn't think much of it at the time.

The logbook is a physical record, a redundancy in case the electronic badge system fails. Everyone signs in; everyone signs out. When I ran my finger down the list of today's entries, I saw a jagged scrawl near the bottom.

08:00 AM – Junior Analyst – Floor 40.

There was no sign-out time.

It happens. People forget. They rush out to catch a train, or they leave through the parking garage and bypass the lobby desk entirely. I figured the guy was long gone, home in bed, sleeping off an eighty-hour work week. I made a mental note to check the fortieth floor during my patrol, just to ensure the lights were off and the coffee machines were unplugged.

I went back to my book. The lobby hummed with the low, subterranean vibration of the HVAC system. On the monitors, the elevators sat idle, their doors closed. The stairwells were empty concrete tubes. The loading dock was dark.

The phone rang at 11:42 PM.

It startled me. The desk phone rarely rings at night unless it’s the monitoring company doing a line check or my supervisor checking if I’m asleep. I picked it up, expecting a robotic voice or the gruff tone of my boss.

""Security,"" I said.

""You have to open the doors.""

The voice was tight, high-pitched, and trembling. It was a man’s voice, but stripped of any masculine cadence by pure panic.

I sat up straighter, my instincts shifting from 'bored' to 'alert'. ""Who is this? Where are you calling from?""

""I’m on forty,"" the voice snapped, cracking on the last syllable. ""I’m in the analyst pen. I tried the elevators but they won’t come. I tried the stairwell but the door won’t open. The fob isn't working. You have to unlock the lockdown. Please, just unlock the damn building.""

I looked at the console. The call was indeed coming from an internal extension on the fortieth floor. I checked my monitors. Monitor 4, which cycled through the upper floors, showed the fortieth-floor lobby. It was dark, illuminated only by the green glow of the exit signs. Nothing was moving.

""Sir, take a breath,"" I said, keeping my voice calm. ""There is no lockdown. The building is in standard night mode. The stairwell doors are fire-safe; they open from the inside automatically. You just have to push the bar.""

""I pushed the bar!"" he screamed. The sound distorted in the receiver, hurting my ear. ""I slammed my shoulder into it! It’s jammed. It’s fused shut. And the elevators... the buttons are dead. I’m trapped in here. You don't understand, I can’t be in here. Not with what’s happening outside.""

""What’s happening outside?"" I asked, swiveling my chair to look out the massive floor-to-ceiling windows of the lobby.

Outside, the street was empty. A taxi cruised by slowly, its wipers slapping back and forth. The rain fell in sheets, illuminated by the streetlamps. It was a peaceful, wet Tuesday night.

""They’re destroying the city,"" the man said, his voice dropping to a terrified whisper. ""I looked out the north window. The bridge is gone. They just... they stepped on it. It collapsed like it was made of toothpicks. I saw cars falling into the river. I saw the fires.""

I frowned, pressing the phone closer to my ear. ""Sir, I’m looking out the window right now. The street is fine. It’s just raining.""

""You’re not looking,"" he hissed. ""You’re not looking high enough. They are walking between the buildings. Oh god, the sound. Can’t you hear the sound? It’s like... like wet leather slapping against concrete, but loud enough to shake the floor.""

""Who is 'they'?"" I asked, my patience beginning to fray. I had dealt with drunks before, and I had dealt with employees having mental breakdowns from stress. This sounded like a psychotic break. A bad one actually.

""The things,"" he wept. ""The massive... I don't know what they are. They have four legs. Long, spindly legs like a spider, but they move like an octopus. They’re tall. They’re taller than the hotel across the street. I saw one of them reach down and pick up a bus. It just picked it up and crushed it. Please. You have to get me out. I’m hiding under my desk but I think they can sense the heat. I think they’re hunting.""

I rubbed my temples. ""Okay. Listen to me. Give me your name.""

He gave it to me. It matched the name in the logbook. The Junior Analyst.

""Okay,"" I said. ""I’m going to come up there. I’m going to bring the elevator up, and we’re going to walk out of here together. Just stay on the line, or stay at your desk. I’ll be there in five minutes.""

""Hurry,"" he sobbed. ""Please hurry. The ground is shaking. I can feel the vibrations in my teeth.""

I put the phone on hold. I stood up and walked to the glass doors of the lobby. I pushed them open and stepped out into the cool night air.

I looked up. I scanned the skyline.

There was nothing. The skyscrapers stood tall and rigid, their aircraft warning lights blinking rhythmically against the clouds. The bridge in the distance was intact, headlights moving across it in a steady stream. There were no fires. There were no four-legged giants. There was no sound of ""wet leather"" or crumbling concrete. Just the hiss of tires on wet pavement and the distant wail of a siren, miles away.

He was hallucinating. Drugs, maybe? Or a gas leak on the fortieth floor? Carbon monoxide could cause hallucinations.

That thought sobered me up. If there was a gas leak, he was in actual danger, just not from giant monsters.

I went back inside, grabbed my master key card, my flashlight, and the portable radio. I locked the front desk console and headed for the elevators.

I stepped into Car 3, the service elevator, because it was the fastest. I punched the button for 40. The doors slid shut, sealing me in the mirrored box. As the elevator began to ascend, my ears popped.

I watched the floor numbers tick up. 10... 20... 30...

The elevator in this building is a glass capsule on the exterior wall for the first twenty floors, then it enters the internal shaft. For those first few seconds, I watched the city recede below me. It was perfectly normal. The world was intact. The man on the phone was having a severe episode. I rehearsed what I would say to him. I’d be calm, authoritative. I’d get him downstairs, call the paramedics, and let the professionals handle it.

The elevator dinged at the 40th floor.

The doors slid open.

The floor was dark, as I expected. The air was stale and recycled, smelling faintly of carpet cleaner and ozone. It was dead silent.

""Hello?"" I called out. My voice echoed down the long corridor of cubicles. ""Security. I’m here.""

I stepped out of the elevator, my flashlight beam cutting a cone through the gloom. The shadows of office chairs and monitors stretched out across the grey carpet, looking like jagged teeth.

""Sir?"" I yelled louder.

No answer.

I keyed my radio. ""Central, this is Mobile One. I’m on forty. No sign of disturbance. Proceeding to the north quadrant."" I was talking to myself, really—recording it for the tapes.

I walked down the main aisle. The cubicles were messy, cluttered with the detritus of high-stress finance. Stacks of paper, half-empty coffee cups, stress balls.

""I’m looking for the analyst,"" I said, trying to project confidence. ""Come on out. The building is safe. I checked outside. There’s nothing there.""

I reached the north side of the floor, the area with the windows overlooking the river—the view he had described.

I shone my flashlight around. ""Sir?""

""I’m here!""

The voice didn't come from the room. It came from my radio.

I jumped, nearly dropping the flashlight. I grabbed the radio on my belt. ""I hear you. Where are you? I’m on the north side, near the windows.""

""I’m right in front of you!"" the voice screamed through the static of the walkie-talkie. ""I’m standing right in front of you! Why aren't you looking at me?""

I swept the flashlight beam back and forth. The light washed over empty desks, ergonomic chairs, and a whiteboard covered in equations.

""I don't see you,"" I said, a cold prickle of unease starting at the base of my spine. ""Come out from behind the desk.""

""I am standing right here!"" he shrieked. ""You’re looking right through me! Are you blind? Stop playing games! Open the goddamn stairwell!""

I spun in a circle. ""Sir, there is no one here. I am the only person on this floor.""

""You’re lying!""

And then, the chair moved.

It was a heavy, expensive executive chair, sitting behind a mahogany desk about ten feet away from me. As I watched, it spun violently, as if someone had kicked it. It rolled across the floor with a harsh rumble of wheels on hard plastic, slamming into a filing cabinet with a deafening clang.

I froze. My heart hammered against my ribs. ""Who’s there?""

""I told you I’m here!"" the voice on the radio sobbed.

Suddenly, a stapler lifted off a nearby desk. It didn't float; it launched. It flew through the air with the velocity of a fastball and smashed into the pillar right next to my head. A ceramic mug followed, shattering against the wall and showering me with shards of pottery.

""Stop it!"" I yelled, backing away, raising my hands to protect my face. ""Come out!""

""Why won't you help me?"" the radio voice screamed.

A stack of files erupted into the air, papers fluttering down like snow. A heavy hole-puncher slid across a table and fell to the floor with a thud. The entire room seemed to be convulsing, objects reacting to an invisible rage.

""I can't see you!"" I shouted, retreating toward the elevator. ""I don't know where you are!""

""I'm grabbing your arm!"" the voice cried. ""I'm holding your arm right now!""

I looked down at my left arm. There was nothing there. But as I watched, the fabric of my uniform sleeve depressed. It indented, five distinct points of pressure, fingers digging into my bicep. I felt the pressure—cold, firm, desperate.

I screamed. I couldn't help it. I yanked my arm away, stumbling backward. The sensation of the grip broke, but the visual imprint on my sleeve remained for a second before smoothing out.

""Get away from me!"" I yelled.

""Why are you doing this?"" he wept. ""They’re coming! The vibrations are getting stronger!""

I didn't wait. I turned and ran. I ran back down the main aisle, dodging the invisible force that was throwing wastebaskets and pens in my path. I reached the elevator bank and slammed my hand against the call button.

""Don't leave me!"" the radio crackled.

""You’re not real,"" I whispered, hyperventilating. ""This is a prank. You’re... you’re a ghost. I don’t know what this is.""

The elevator doors opened. I threw myself inside and hammered the 'Lobby' button.

As the doors began to slide shut, I looked back into the dark corridor.

A fire extinguisher was lifted off its wall hook. It hovered in the air for a split second, suspended by nothing, and then hurled itself toward the elevator. It struck the closing doors with a massive metallic gong sound, denting the metal from the outside just as the seal closed.

The elevator descended. I collapsed against the mirrored wall, sliding down to the floor, gasping for air. My mind was reeling. I had seen the objects move. I had felt the hand. But there was no one there.

I needed the police. I needed a priest. I needed to get out of this building.

When the elevator opened in the lobby, I scrambled out, practically crawling over the reception desk to get behind the safety of the glass partition. I grabbed the landline to dial 911.

The phone rang before I could dial.

Line four.

I stared at it.

It rang again.

I picked it up slowly. ""Hello?""

""You left me.""

The voice was unrecognizable now. It was a deep, guttural despair mixed with a fury that chilled my blood.

""I... I couldn't see you,"" I stammered. ""I don't know what kind of trick this is, but you were invisible. You were throwing things at me.""

""I was throwing things to get your attention!"" he screamed. ""I was screaming in your face! I grabbed your arm and you looked at me like I was air! You looked right through me with those dead, stupid eyes and you ran away!""

""I'm calling the police,"" I said. ""They can handle this.""

""The police?"" He laughed, a wet, hysterical sound. ""What are the police going to do? Shoot the Behemoth? It doesn't matter. It’s too late for the stairs now. It’s here.""

""What is here?"" I whispered.

""The big one,"" he said. His voice went quiet, trembling. ""It was watching me. When you came up... I think the light from your flashlight... I think it saw the light. It turned. It stopped crushing the parking garage and it turned toward the tower.""

I looked at the monitors. The exterior cameras showed rain. Empty streets. Peace.

""There is nothing outside,"" I said, clinging to my reality like a lifeline. ""I am looking at the cameras. It is a quiet night.""

"" I don't know anymore. But I can see it. It’s climbing the building. It’s wrapping its legs around the structure. The glass is starting to crack on the thirty-eighth floor. I can hear it popping.""

""Sir, stop it.""

""It’s huge,"" he whispered. ""Its skin is like oil. It has... oh god, it has thousands of eyes. Little milky eyes all along the tentacles. And it’s coming up. It’s looking for the food inside the metal box.""

""There are no monsters,"" I said, squeezing my eyes shut. ""I went up there. The floor was empty. You are having a delusion.""

""If I'm having a delusion,"" he asked, his voice trembling with a terrifying clarity, ""then how did I hold your arm?""

I looked down at my bicep. I rolled up my sleeve.

Five distinct, purple bruises were forming on my skin. The shape of a hand.

""I..."" I couldn't speak.

""It’s at the window,"" he said abruptly. The line filled with a sound—a low, resonant thrumming, like a cello bow being dragged across a suspension cable. ""It’s looking in. It’s pressing its face against the glass. The glass is bowing inward. It’s going to break.""

""Hide,"" I whispered. ""Just hide.""

""There’s nowhere to hide,"" he said. "" It’s looking right at me. It’s raising a leg. It’s going to—""

CRACK.

The sound came through the phone, sharp and violent, like a gunshot. It was followed by the sound of shattering glass—tons of it, cascading down like a waterfall.

""NO!"" he screamed. ""NO! GET BACK! GET BACK!""
