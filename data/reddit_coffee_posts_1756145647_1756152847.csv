1n01706,https://www.reddit.com/r/bih/comments/1n01706/short_guide_tips_for_visiting_sarajevo/,Short guide & tips for visiting Sarajevo,"Hello future visitors of Sarajevo & BiH (short for Bosnia & Hercegovina)  
  
This is my quick short unbiased guide & tips for anyone visiting Sarajevo for a few days. If you want a full experience, stay longer and rent a car, as Bosnia is cheap compared to other European countries you can definitely afford it. The nature is worth staying longer, but for now I'll focus only on what to see in the city itself.

I'm not a tourist worker nor affiliated with any place. Anyone having questions hit me up here or at zmayichhh on inst.

My goal is not to promote anyone, but when it comes to food I had to name at least one place that’s pretty known among locals, for those bored to lurk around.

# Intro:

Price comparison  
1 euro = 2 marks (KM)

Some places accept the euro but you can pay 90% with a card anyway, so just get some bosnian cash and you’re good to go. Exchange shops are regulated so don’t worry about the rate that much.

**Internet:**  
The biggest and known internet provider is “BH Telecom” and would stick with them because they are present everywhere with good options.

You can buy an eSIM here  
[https://mojwebshop.bhtelecom.ba/INTERSHOP/web/BOS/BHTelecomWebShop-BHTelecom-Site/bs\_BA/-/BAM/AktivacijaDigitalnogServisa-Start?SKU=908992eng&LOC=eng](https://mojwebshop.bhtelecom.ba/INTERSHOP/web/BOS/BHTelecomWebShop-BHTelecom-Site/bs_BA/-/BAM/AktivacijaDigitalnogServisa-Start?SKU=908992eng&LOC=eng)

costs 16KM and you automatically get 2GB for 7 days

Or buy a physical card in any shop for 5KM. Download the namesake application from google play and buy internet options that you want. Other known providers (haloo, novotel, mtel…)

**Travel visa:**  
No (most countries)

**When to come?**  
**1)** If you want a perfect time period, it’s definitely August and to be more specific look for the date of the **Sarajevo Film Festival**. It lasts for 7 days and during that time the city is packed with music, open air local and international movies and other events, it’s more crowded but only during the night, also all clubs and everything work longer so it’s the best period for tourists, also the climate during August is the best, not to warm but also dry.

**2)** For people not interested in parties, music and loud noises, a good time is also during Ramadan (different date each year), as the atmosphere is a bit different especially in the old town, there also cannons around the city that shoot fireworks when it’s time for iftar (second meal of the day for muslims) so people like to gather at viewpoints in the city to eat together, you can also join. 

**Cautions:**  
I have nothing much to write here, pickpockets exist to a smaller degree so just keep an eye on crowded areas. Don’t give money to beggars, especially not gypsy kids because most of them are forced to do that. I’m empathetic enough, but their place should not be the walking tourist sidewalk. The city is generally divided when it comes to the LGBT population, but those who are not “for them” are generally ignoring them on the street. You shouldn’t have problems. Generally wearing anything when it comes to colors, country flags etc. is not a problem. 

# You are coming to Sarajevo by:

***Airplane:***

Luckily the airport is at the entrance of the city. Use the bus or taxi.Centrotrans Airport Shuttle (Bus 200E / Aerodrom–Baščaršija). Direct bus service from the airport terminal to the city center/old town. A one-way ticket costs 5KM in cash and it goes approximately every 15-20minutes.Taxis in Sarajevo are among the cheapest in Europe and a few taxi companies in the city operate 24 hours a day.There are branded taxi companies in Sarajevo with different colors like ""Yellow taxi"", ""Red taxi"".

Maybe avoid ""Sarajevo taxi"", prices are standardized but they are known for ripping tourists (especially Arabs) because anyone with a personal car and license can work for them, a lot of weird guys. They have the privilege to park at the airport so if you pick them please ask for the price to the city center (it should not be higher than 18KM, if they say something like 15-20euros, leave the car)

The Yellow taxi number is “033 663 555”, or order the cab via whatsapp/viber on “061 663 555”. You can also ask some staff at the airport to call them for you, they will probably do it.Uber and similar services still don’t exist.

***Train/Bus:***

Most likely you have/had a trip to Mostar. You can buy tickets online (they close the tickets 5 hours before the trip for some reason, don't worry). You can also buy them directly at the counter or even in the bus/train, but only in cash. 

Both bus/train arrive at the same station. Suggestion, if you plan to use the tram in Sarajevo during arrival with the bus, exit one bus stop prior to the last one because it's next to the tram, otherwise you'll walk 10 minutes from the station.

**Tram/Trolley:**

You want to use this in the city because it goes back and forth, and in my opinion no need to use any application except for google maps to see where you are. But you can try  
[https://www.javniprevozks.ba/account/index](https://www.javniprevozks.ba/account/index)  
I am not using it personally even though I travel across the city. After midnight, there is one tram that drives until the early mornings.

I would not recommend using the Trolley because there’s no reason for that, it also drives along the city but more inside the neighborhoods, not along the river. The only reason is if you want to travel like that to the airport but you will still walk 15min so better use a taxi

https://preview.redd.it/t5iu35jp28lf1.png?width=1046&format=png&auto=webp&s=90fa9a149008ff4b3abb3c457ffa63f19bfa9f4d

**Accommodation:**  
I noticed this while talking with tourists, they don’t really check photos of Sarajevo and most of them stay in the old town, but there’s a catch. Sarajevo is surrounded by steep hills, so if something says “10 minutes away from something” it probably means downhill. Here is a map showing the tourist area + where to stay if you’re fat or don’t like to walk. Yellow area is also full of apartments, but it's a bit on the hillside.

https://preview.redd.it/yma4odvt28lf1.jpg?width=1206&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=a125960e9ddbdfdca7ed399afd3bffb0bcd677e2

Note: If you really want a great view and are into the vibe going through narrow streets while going downhill, then yes go for it, that's especially nice during sunset when the sun hits the old houses and streets, for me a nice experience, but going back I would take 5min ride with a taxi.

# Food:

Bosnia has clean water so feel free to use the tap. There’s a public fountain in the old city, it says whoever drinks from it will return to Sarajevo  
[https://maps.app.goo.gl/fcp7mUa8L7q5DYtz7](https://maps.app.goo.gl/fcp7mUa8L7q5DYtz7)  
On the other hand, buy Bosnian water, outside or when eating, it’s cheap and promotes the country (Sara, Oaza, Leda, Ella, Lejla, Olimpija....).  
Sparkling water is also a popular Bosnian product, we have many natural springs for them. The most known brand is “Kiseljak”, it’s a city near Sarajevo where you can literally drink sprinkling water from the town's fountain, and its name literally means that. 

**Alcohol:**  
The balkan region is known for its “rakija” which is a heavy 40% alcoholic fruit spirit. Sarajevo/Bosnia is not an exception, actually we drink more than everyone around us, even though it’s the only country with muslim majority but anyway…You can order rakija in most places where you also have other similar drinks like beer or cocktails. When it comes to the flavor, their name literally means their flavor (sljiva - plumb, jabuka - apple, visnja - cherry, kruska - pear) so order them like that. You can easily get drunk so don’t drink 2many2fast. The second most popular drink is beer, and the town is known for its own brand “Sarajevo beer” which is the oldest beer brand in Bosnia since 1864 with its own factory actually in the city itself, and its own underground spring water.

If you already googled, you can’t escape the meme but the most known food from Sarajevo are “cevapi” even thou it’s not that complex or interesting like something else in my opinion but definitely try it, and every second restaurant in the old city offers them and those places are called “cevabdzinica” on google maps, as they are usually packed sit on the first available place because most locals will tell you their “favorite” but still tell you to sit anywhere otherwise you might wait for 20 minutes.Second known thing from Bosnia are pie variations. Best are with meat (Burek) and white cheese (Sirnica), while there are other variants but these are the most popular. The best places offer them baked in a special box, so google “buregdzinica” for pie places and look for “ispod sača” which means “under sač” which is like a metal container with charcoal under it.

That’s it for the meme food which our neighbors know us for.

“Ascinica” is a name for every restaurant that offers mostly traditional/local food, so please type this on google maps. Some offer only daily menus with few items, but that’s more interesting to me. Local people like to eat there because its tasty and prices are better, unfortunately it’s not that “common” when you leave the tourist areas because younger people are more attracted to standard chicken fries, doner, pizza and other commercial shit things.

Traditional food to try:  
Gulash (beef with mash potatoes, rice or pasta)  
Soups (Begova corba, Teleca corba..)  
Grah (beans with meat)  
Sarma (meat rolled with cabbage)  
Punjene Parike (peppers filled with meat)  
Klepe (raviolis)  
Bosanski lonac (chunked meat and vegetables)  
Somun (type of bread, comes automatically with chevapi)

Sweets:  
Baklava (pure baklava, avoid any variations)  
Tufahija (boiled apples with cream)  
Apple pie  
Sutlija (rice desert)  
Try the “Bosnian coffee”, you have to find it on the menu otherwise you’ll get normal espresso. It should be served on a traditional copper plate with a “džezva” cup made also from copper, few sugar blocks and maybe even “rahat lokum” which is a jelly sugar sweet.

**WHERE TO GO:**

**Main street for a walk**

https://preview.redd.it/bwqn3ano38lf1.png?width=949&format=png&auto=webp&s=e88054c5b73421f306b3b8e8d7b5786a0c1bcb84

The old town is called “Bascarsija” where you can lurk around, you can’t get lost as two main streets are surrounding it. As you walk, you might notice some red paint splashes on the sidewalk, they’re called “Sarajevo roses”, impact holes from mortars during the war.  
[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sarajevo\_Rose](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sarajevo_Rose)

**1)** Bosnia is known for its milk/dairy products. Visit the town local market [https://maps.app.goo.gl/tTaX42nFDhnpiTeG9](https://maps.app.goo.gl/tTaX42nFDhnpiTeG9)  
where you can find milk and cheese products. We are known for white cheese, cream, and there are many variations but something special is called “kajmak”, you can also order it together with “chevapi” mentioned in the food section. There are also variations for kajmak itself, some like it more thicker sweet, others more salty creamy, so go nuts and try everything.

Very pro tip for me:  
If you want to chill somewhere outside and still eat something cool, buy kajmak from this place or any supermarket, buy local somun, mix them up and enjoy a view. Please be aware, real somun is made only at few places in the city, one of them is this popular bakery  
[https://maps.app.goo.gl/q76oG7B7aJAhpAXN8](https://maps.app.goo.gl/q76oG7B7aJAhpAXN8) (the bakery provides somun to all restaurants in the old town)Please don’t buy any “traditional” food like pie (burek, sirnica), somun etc. from random bakeries because there are many but it's cheap and fake. While buying normal bread there is perfectly fine.

2) Sarajevo cable car.  
[https://www.zicara.ba/en/home](https://www.zicara.ba/en/home)  
It goes to one of my favourite places, Trebević mountain. Costs 20KM. To be honest you can spend half your day there, there are nice walking tracks that go in a circle through the forest or along the mountain side.  
Here is a nice circle route: Go along the road to the Abandoned bobsled. It's very popular and you can walk on it. Go to the Pino hotel for a coffee break and then hit through forest using the marked track back to the starting point.

[Trebevic](https://preview.redd.it/ghyi4nl138lf1.jpg?width=1335&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=c0a1fe1bc43d2588e0b3c80751979f1c863c443a)

Bonus bonus tip:  
For those who are interested in easy hiking, you can walk to the top of the mountain in like 1-2 hours and there’s a wooden cabin where foreign volunteers work, you can have lunch (beans, soup..) and drinks. Not just because of the view, but ask yourself from which European capital can you hike on top of a mountain in just 2 hours?https://maps.app.goo.gl/cqikSe7SnnSNRDdE6

4) National museum, they have a nice garden in the middle and different rooms that also include general things from nature and history if you’re not interested just for Bosnia.  
[https://maps.app.goo.gl/KskK7PJAKvoq8sAX7](https://maps.app.goo.gl/KskK7PJAKvoq8sAX7)

5) Right next to the museum is a cool cafe called “Tito” with military vehicles from WW2 around it. It’s not known for “good” coffee or drinks, but it has a garden unlike most places in the city  
[https://maps.app.goo.gl/tamhSw8duhA6eBwdA](https://maps.app.goo.gl/tamhSw8duhA6eBwdA)

6) Yellow fortress, a popular spot for a sunset view of Sarajevo and has a nice 5-10min walk from the old town.  
[https://maps.app.goo.gl/9VEyh7dw6q696peo7](https://maps.app.goo.gl/9VEyh7dw6q696peo7)

7) Heco hotel, the only “skyscraper” in the old town, it has a cafe at the top with a 360 view of the whole town  
[https://maps.app.goo.gl/7JjxVfjqemPZ2EpP6](https://maps.app.goo.gl/7JjxVfjqemPZ2EpP6)

8) Sarajevo City Hall  
[https://maps.app.goo.gl/Nd5yZVeF7aVswUHc7](https://maps.app.goo.gl/Nd5yZVeF7aVswUHc7)

9) Museum of genocide & war  
[https://maps.app.goo.gl/HR7RWdavVneZx4469](https://maps.app.goo.gl/HR7RWdavVneZx4469)

10) Tunnel of hope  
[https://maps.app.goo.gl/oDTKxk59djWNgS2y9](https://maps.app.goo.gl/oDTKxk59djWNgS2y9)

11) Veliki park, just a place to relax, there are also some small monuments there  
[https://maps.app.goo.gl/JCXyvsuR6RgpRuao7](https://maps.app.goo.gl/JCXyvsuR6RgpRuao7)

12) Gazi Husrev-beg mosque, Sarajevo catholic cathedral, orthodox church  
[https://maps.app.goo.gl/2vHwptnwBXr5k5rv5https://maps.app.goo.gl/gtxjhZZgHe6TrYTQ8https://maps.app.goo.gl/VqxJuXza2gEgMLye8](https://maps.app.goo.gl/2vHwptnwBXr5k5rv5https://maps.app.goo.gl/gtxjhZZgHe6TrYTQ8https://maps.app.goo.gl/VqxJuXza2gEgMLye8)

13) Eternal flame. A rather small monument but a symbol for the city and its WW2 history.  
[https://maps.app.goo.gl/2zh1TUxGPuRm1e226](https://maps.app.goo.gl/2zh1TUxGPuRm1e226)

14) Place from where events unfolded for the start of WW1https://maps.app.goo.gl/x9MWcqUfB8L6G7VN6

15) During Winter:  
Bosnia held the 1984 Winter Olympics, therefore we have good skiing resorts. It’s definitely worth planning a few days' trips because different skiing mountains are not far away from each other, and from Sarajevo.

Bjelasnicahttps://maps.app.goo.gl/da2iVfvmA3h9YZvBA  
Jahorinahttps://maps.app.goo.gl/9AwVxizcxZqM9n6Z9

Personally, I usually go to Bjelasnica because the surrounding area looks nicer and has a more relaxed open environment, it’s also cheaper. On the other hand, Jahorina has the longest, best and most tracks for skiing, you won’t get bored even after a whole day. 

**Going out/Activity:**

Blind tiger (night out cocktails, tourist place)Jazzbina, Old School Cafe, Balkan Express (3 small places next to each other, different vibes, first is a pop rock underground bar, then a cozy cafe and then a pub where locals go for a beer)Fabrika (quality coffee)Zlatna Ribica (retro vibe)Mrvica Old Town (pancakes)Margherita (allegedly the best pizza in town)Čajdžinica Džirlo (tea, the owner is a local figure)Ministry of Ćejf (coffee in old town)Next Magic Shop (buy and play board games)Celtic, Vucko, Viking, City, Red door (all pubs)Museum of illusionsSilver Smoke (techno club)

**Shopping malls:**  
Sarajevo city center  
[https://maps.app.goo.gl/SW91wFUZ6MHTuK8UA](https://maps.app.goo.gl/SW91wFUZ6MHTuK8UA)  
Aria  
[https://maps.app.goo.gl/GuZ7d6huqQSbDVKh7](https://maps.app.goo.gl/GuZ7d6huqQSbDVKh7)

--: |:--| :-- | :--: | :--: | :--
**1**|[Milwaukee Brewers](#f/mil)|**Brewers**|**0**| [Sometimes, there is crying in baseball](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2S_c2bPJD0I) |**81-50**
**2**|[Detroit Tigers](#f/det)|**Tigers**|**+3**| Solid 5-1 homestand from the Tigers. It appears that Chris Paddack shouldn't throw against the Twins- thankfully, no more potential Paddack vs. Twins matchups on the schedule. Riley Greene and Spencer Torkelson have been on hot streaks as of late, now sitting at 31 and 28 HR, respectively. Another hot month and change could find both in the mid 30s by season's end. This week: 3 at SAC, 3 at KCR. |**78-54**
**3**|[Philadelphia Phillies](#f/phi)|**Phillies**|**+1**| The Phillies had a nice bounceback week, crushing the Mariners in a 3 game sweep before taking two of three from the Nats. Jhoan Duran blew his first save but he got back on track the next night. Aaron Nola's start this week was also good to see, going 6 innings nad giving up two earned runs. The shape of the team changes drastically with Zack Wheeler out for the year, but Cristopher Sanchez has been elite, going 6+ innings in every start since the start of June and only allowing 3+ runs twice. If the rotation can be 3 deep come playoffs, they'll be in good shape. As of now though, Sanchez is the only truly reliable one with a mix of Suarez, Luzardo, Nola, and Walker hoping to put it all together come October. This week, the Phillies have a huge 3 game set against the Mets that could put the division away or make it close, followed by 4 against the Braves. |**76-54**
**4**|[Toronto Blue Jays](#f/tor)|**Blue Jays**|**-2**| Baby, baby, baby, oh Like baby, baby, baby, no Like baby, baby, baby, oh I thought you'd always be mine, mine Baby, baby, baby, oh Like baby, baby, baby, no Like baby, baby, baby, oh I thought you'd always be mine, mine |**76-55**
**5**|[Chicago Cubs](#f/chc)|**Cubs**|**+1**| The Cubs took care of business against the Brewers, taking 3 of 5 before sweeping the Angels in Anaheim. It was a week that saw Kyle Tucker's slump hit its nadir, as he was benched for 2 days to reset his swing. It was finally confirmed that he was playing through injury, a hand fracture in early June being the culprit. However, all that was needed for him was to face the Angels, as he continued his dominance over them by hitting his first HR since the start of July. Cade Horton vaulted himself to the front of the NL ROTY race with a spectacular start on Saturday, throwing his first 21 putches for strikes en route to 6 shutout innings.The Cubs will wrap up their West Coast trip with 6 games against the Rockies and Giants this week. |**76-55**
**6**|[Los Angeles Dodgers](#f/lad)|**Dodgers**|**-3**| Idk man, this team both looks really good and really bad at the same time. The pileup of injuries is really showing, and hopefully someday soon, when they return we won't have to see Michael Conforto strike out with the bases loaded agai |**74-57**
**7**|[San Diego Padres](#f/sdp)|**Padres**|**+1**| Maaaan, I feel like bad luck. Couldn’t tune in today till the 7th, just in time to see it all blow up. Don’t like seeing Estrada versus the Dodgers, if that happens in October it’s close to incompetence. Still though, monday/sunday losses this week bookend a 5-game winning streak between them, enough to win both series and take the division lead back from LA. Bring on our true rivals, the Mariners. |**74-57**
**8**|[Boston Red Sox](#f/bos)|**Red Sox**|**+1**|  |**71-60**
**9**|[Houston Astros](#f/hou)|**Astros**|**-2**| Our hitting really picked up our pitching this week. Really don't know what to think about our starters outside of Framber/HB. Hard to trust anyone. Hoping we get a good confidence boost this week against the Rockies and don't lose any ground to the Mariners. |**72-59**
**10**|[New York Yankees](#f/nyy)|**Yankees**|**+1**|  |**70-60**
**11**|[Seattle Mariners](#f/sea)|**Mariners**|**-1**| This is a Cal Raleigh appreciation blurb. All my homies want to be him, I want to be him, you want to be him. Can you believe he fell to the third round? Chills. Will he win MVP? Probably not given the voters. Should he win? In my completely 100% unbiased opinion, yes why would you even ask? Vote with your hearts, voters. *Up next: 3 vs. Vedder Cup, part 2, 3 @ GUARDS!!*  |**70-61**
**12**|[New York Mets](#f/nym)|**Mets**|**0**| The Mets really do not look like a team that's going to go deep this October. Lately, they've been having trouble building any sort of momentum. After an excellent series opener against the lowly Nationals (where they finally had a starter pitch into the 7th, and where the bats came alive) they dropped the next two. After two strong victories in Atlanta, they dropped the series closer. Their path to a division title has all but closed, as they now fight the Reds for the 3rd Wild Card. |**69-61**
**13**|[Cincinnati Reds](#f/cin)|**Reds**|**0**| To be fair, you have to have a very high IQ to understand The Cincinnati Reds. Their game strategies are extremely subtle, and without a solid grasp of theoretical baseball most of the plays will go over a typical viewer’s head. Losing a series to the Diamondbacks in the middle of a playoff race? That’s just part of the plan baby. It’ll all work out in the end. There’s also Bob Castellini’s ownership style, which is deftly woven into his characterisation, his personal philosophy draws heavily from Sun Tzu’s *The Art of War*, for instance. The fans understand this stuff; they have the intellectual capacity to truly appreciate the depths of strategy this team employs, to realise that they’re not just skillful, they say something deep about BASEBALL. As a consequence people who dislike the Reds truly ARE idiots, of course they wouldn’t appreciate, for instance, the genius of giving Jeimer Candelario $43 million dollars, which itself is a cryptic reference to Shakespeare’s play “Julius Caesar”. I’m smirking right now just imagining one of those addlepated simpletons scratching their heads in confusion as the Reds genius wit unfolds itself on their television screens. What fools.. how I pity them. 😂 And yes, by the way, i DO have a Joey Votto tattoo. And no, you cannot see it. It’s for the player’s eyes only- and even then they have to demonstrate their baseball knowledge beforehand. Nothing personnel guys, you just aren’t as important as I am. |**68-63**
**14**|[Texas Rangers](#f/tex)|**Rangers**|**+2**| There is a much larger hill to climb after the last month plus but if there is a team who will fuck around and end up in a playoff spot it is some how the Rangers. It'll never be easy, and god only knows they won't make it any easier for themselves but they have the group to make a run, it's just up to them if they want to actually do that or not. Also, Gavin Dawson you are a hack and a loser. |**66-66**
**15**|[Kansas City Royals](#f/kcr)|**Royals**|**0**| A series loss to The Cats threw some cold water on a red-hot Royals team, but no ground was lost over the weekend in the wild card race. The losses haven't even been too bad, so the Royals can maintain course by beating up the White Sox again and keeping up with Detroit better at home this week, meaning they can stay hot with another soft patch of schedule awaiting them. There's still life within these eyes! Also, hello. |**67-64**
**16**|[Tampa Bay Rays](#f/tbr)|**Rays**|**+1**| My my, hey hey. It's a little rough to be a Ray. Is it better to burn out, or fade away? As the season whittles down, the Rays have made no progress in either direction. Top prospect Carson Williams was called up for an extended cup of coffee (and homered in his first game!), but barring magic and mayhem, it's more about building hype for next year. Caminero also has an excellent shot at being the first Ray since Carlos Pena(!!) to hit 40HR in a season, and only the 2nd to ever do it. |**63-67**
**17**|[Arizona Diamondbacks](#f/ari)|**D-Backs**|**+3**| The Diamondbacks showed life this week, going 4-2 vs. Ohio. A playoff berth is still basically an impossibility, but at least the players haven't checked out.  |**64-67**
**18**|[Cleveland Guardians](#f/cle)|**Guardians**|**-4**| This wasn't the Guardians' best week. I'm not ruling out a wildcard spot, but they won't get one if they play like they did this week. |**64-65**
**19**|[St. Louis Cardinals](#f/stl)|**Cardinals**|**-1**|  |**64-67**
**20**|[San Francisco Giants](#f/sfg)|**Giants**|**-1**| Ok this team is definitely going to do the thing where they heat up just enough to not quite sneak into the playoffs, but finish just at or right around .500 like they have the last several seasons, I can feel it in my bad wrist. 1 out of 4 against the Padres was nothing to write home about, but they actually looked great against the best team in baseball. Getting Matt Chapman back at third base is a huge boost on defense, allowing Casey Schmitt, who has been heating up as of late, to hopefully find his permanent place over at second. Willy Adames and Luis Matos both had great weeks, a pair of homers each and 4 steals between the two of them. While the Giants gave up the first game to the Brewers on a walk-off, they clinched the series late in yesterday’s game on a Luis Matos go-ahead single, which broke an 0-12 steak for him. This week they get the Cubs and Orioles at home, we’ll see if they lifted whatever curse was cast upon Oracle Park following the All Star Break.  |**63-68**
**21**|[Miami Marlins](#f/mia)|**Marlins**|**+1**| I once read about a blind man who rides bicycles using echolocation- clicking his tongue like a bat to navigate for those of y'all who never opened a National Geographic. He even started a program to teach other blind people to do things most would never expect, from biking to everyday independence. Caretakers often push back, saying it’s too dangerous, but his point is that the real barrier isn’t blindness, it’s expectation. He grew up with a support system that encouraged him to try what others assumed he couldn’t, while many blind people are held back by low expectations placed on them.  That framing applies to all of us. For me, it echoes with the Marlins. I believe this team has more potential than just cycles of mediocrity- even when the season feels lost. If we raise our expectations, not just of the team but of ourselves as fans, we might ride out weeks like these with a little more perspective, and maybe even a little more hope. |**61-69**
**22**|[Atlanta Braves](#f/atl)|**Braves**|**+1**| Cal Quantrill became the 17th starting pitcher used by the Braves this year. The most ever in franchise history. He fits right in with his high ERA and inefficient pitch count. While this was happening, I was watching the Bananas comeback in thirlling fashion over the Firefighters. Ryan Cox lived up to his Glove Magician nickname with a new single game trick play record with EIGHT! This is way more fun than Braves baseball right now. |**59-71**
**23**|[Los Angeles Angels](#f/laa) |**Angels**|**-2**| The Halos got schlonged last week against the NL Central.  |**61-69**
**24**|[Baltimore Orioles](#f/bal)|**Orioles**|**+1**| An 8-year extension for a player that played 3 games in the majors, and I am ok with it. If Basallo ends up being good to great the contract is a steal. Fans are clamoring for more extensions for Gunnar, Holliday and so on...but those are Boras clients, and we know that won't happen. Also, if you said last year that Trevor Rogers day would be win day, you would have been arrested for being intoxicated above the legal limit. Is he eligible for comeback player of the year? What a turn around. |**60-70**
**25**|[Oakland Athletics](#f/oak)|**Athletics**|**+1**| Jacob Wilson returned to the line up this week and began contributing right away. Unfortunately the Athletics couldn't work that into a series win against the Mariners. Jacob Lopez who has been putting up great numbers in his last starts, especially in K's, had a rough outing giving up two home runs to Cal Raleigh in a blow out loss on Sunday. The A's return to Sacramento to face the hot Detroit Tigers, but could certainly spoil a game or two. Luckily for the Tigers, the Athletics are better on the road. Tyler Soderstrom has found a groove and had a 17 game hit streak and currently is still riding a 25 game on base streak (both career longs).  |**60-72**
**26**|[Minnesota Twins](#f/min)|**Twins**|**-2**| Taj Bradley with the Twins so far: -0.3 bWAR. Griffin Jax with the Rays so far: -0.4 bWAR. Another brilliant trade! The team is improving one-tenth of a replacement player at a time, and at this rate we can expect them to start winning again shortly before the return of Halley's Comet. |**59-71**
**27**|[Pittsburgh Pirates](#f/pit)|**Pirates**|**0**| A good week in Pirates Land, as the Bucs went 5-1 against the best team in the American League and the worst team in the National League for a pretty successful homestand. Friday saw the debut of top prosepct Bubba Chandler, who pitched well out of the 'pen. But what really helped the Bucs this week was some great starts from less heralded pitchers like Braxton Ashcraft and Johan Oviedo. The Pirates have a formidable stable of starting pitching; if only they knew how to develop even one hitter.  |**57-74**
**28**|[Washington Nationals](#f/wsh)|**Nationals**|**0**| Even though the Nats dropped the final 2 games in the most recent Philadelphia series, they have been playing .500 ball for 2 and a half weeks now and that's about all you can ask for out of the youngest roster in MLB. The bullpen, which is absolutely littered with rookies, has strangely looked competent as of recent and even put up some zeros against a tough Phillies lineup. It's a funny thing to cheer for mediocre results, but when you're having a season of turmoil like these baby Nats are, you take what you can get. |**53-77**
**29**|[Chicago White Sox](#f/cws)|**White Sox**|**0**| The White Sox offense got shut out once this week, but still averaged 7.5 runs a game with at +12 run/diff in a 3-3 week. For a team that needs to go 500 the rest of the season to avoid a third straight 100 loss campaign, that is perfectly acceptable. The offense has continued to be top 5 post-break and Colson Montgomery is doing his best to forget a rough stretch in the minors. He has some worrisome signs with only a 4% BB rate and 30% K rate, but he has a long history of taking walks and he is absolutely crushing the ball. |**47-83**
**30**|[Colorado Rockies](#f/col)|**Rockies**|**0**| A split with the Dodgers followed by being swept by the Pirates while scoring one run total in three games. I have no idea. |**37-94**",7,1756152327.0,baseball,2,1.0,False

Miles said the island would fix me.

That’s what he called it — a fix. Like I was a leaky faucet or a busted wristwatch. I didn’t argue, because staying in his apartment meant listening to him chew cereal and pretend not to watch me. And I didn’t want anyone watching me. Not now.

The ferry smelled like hot engine grease and spilled sunscreen. I sat by the rail with my backpack between my feet, knees braced, and drank a Sprite I bought from a cooler kid. It was warm and tasted faintly of soap. My phone had no signal before we even left the harbor. I stared at the “No Service” text until it blurred.

The water started out green, then blue, then something I’d never seen. Clearer than clear — like air if air could hold its shape. You could see all the way down, white sand rippling in soft patterns, miles out. Looking at it felt like looking through a window that never ended.

---

#### The race

They said everyone builds their own boat. “It’s tradition,” Miles told me. My boat was two planks nailed into something vaguely floatable. It listed to one side if I sat wrong.

The air tasted like pennies that morning. Sharp. A crowd had gathered along the beach, laughing too much, clapping for boats that didn’t deserve it. Everyone acted like it mattered, though I couldn’t tell if they were serious.

When I pushed off, the hull shuddered like a cough. I paddled anyway. The water was glass, flat and dead calm, so clear I could see my boat’s shadow sliding across the bottom like a stingray. My oar made long black stripes every time I lifted it.

Then I noticed something else.

Another shadow. Moving under mine. Too sharp to be fish. No tail flick. No soft edges. A clean, exact line, cutting the sand in half as it glided. I leaned forward, trying to see. Sunlight burned the back of my neck. The more I squinted, the more I saw — an angle. A perfect corner, like the edge of a box, sliding right where the boat’s shadow was darkest.

The wind came fast. Like someone opened a door I didn’t know existed. My paddle flew out of my hands, the boat lurched hard, sky turning black before I even saw the clouds.

I remember the taste of metal in my mouth. Then water. Then nothing.

---

#### The room

I woke up in a bungalow that smelled of lemon polish and something sweet, like candy melted in a car. A man in a tan vest — no name tag, just a big smile — told me to rest. The ferries weren’t running “for now.” He said it like he’d said it a hundred times before, words worn smooth as pebbles.

The room was spotless. Bedspread flat enough to play pool on. Curtains thin as napkins. I turned the TV on — static, then a cooking show in some language I didn’t know. They were boiling white cubes in a pot. They looked too shiny to be food.

I stayed in bed the rest of that day, listening to my head throb like a loose drum. The walls had a carved trim running along the ceiling, little curls and hooks etched deep into the wood. Too exact to be random. Perfect little spirals folding into each other like someone had a ruler and nothing better to do.

That night I stepped out on the balcony. The air smelled metallic again. The sea was still as poured glass. Out at the horizon, I saw a spot where the stars stopped. Just gone. If I leaned left, the stars came back. Lean right — gone again. Like holding your hand up to the sky, except my hands were in my pockets.

I told myself I was tired. Just tired.

---

#### The panel

The next morning, the coffee tasted like wet rope. The sugar was hard as gravel. The front desk guy smiled too wide and said “maybe tomorrow” about the ferries, like he’d been waiting for me to ask.

Back in my room, I noticed a seam above the TV. A little square in the wall, neat as a pencil drawing. I pushed it. It clicked open.

Inside were three tall shapes. Smooth. Hollow. I thought of mannequins, but faceless, with no arms or legs, just long, narrow cavities where something should go. Two weren’t empty.

The pale material inside them wasn’t plastic. Not exactly. Too soft-looking. Almost wax, but not melting. The third one was bare.

I shut the panel fast. Sat on the bed. Thought about a burger I had in Utah once. Grease dripping down my wrist. Toasted bun. Salt on my lips. I thought about that burger for ten minutes, maybe twenty. Long enough to forget what I’d seen. Almost.

---

#### Nights

The gap in the stars looked closer the next night. Not much. Just enough I knew it wasn’t my imagination. I stared at it until my eyes hurt, then looked back at the wall.

The panel was open. I know I closed it. The empty shape inside looked darker. Like damp clay.

I moved a chair in front of it. Didn’t feel like enough.

---

#### Days

Time stretched. I couldn’t tell if it’d been three days or ten. The TV kept playing the same show with the cubes. The front desk guy kept saying “maybe tomorrow.” My skin smelled faintly like salt no matter how many showers I took.

I walked to the dock one morning. No boats. Just sand piling on the planks and a woman sweeping it off without looking up. I said hello. She didn’t answer. Didn’t even glance at me.

Back in my room, the air felt thick. Like breathing through cloth. I drank two Sprites from the mini fridge just to taste something sweet. Both were flat, almost bitter. I stared at the label until I realized the letters weren’t in English anymore.

That night the stars blinked out in a clean black wedge. Like someone had cut the sky with scissors.

---

#### Closer

I dreamed I couldn’t move my arms. Woke up standing barefoot on the carpet with my shirt twisted backward. The chair I’d left in front of the panel was pushed aside.

I didn’t open it. I didn’t need to. The smell of salt was stronger.

The gap on the horizon was closer still. Too close to be part of the sky now. I stepped onto the balcony and leaned out, heart racing — nothing but water. Except it wasn’t nothing. The black shape was there, blotting stars, silent, massive, waiting.

I went inside. Tried to think of that burger. Tried to remember the taste of cold orange juice in a sweating glass. Couldn’t.

---

#### Last night

The panel door hung wide open. The empty cavity wasn’t empty anymore. Something faint pressed against its inner walls, like frost or breath on glass.

I didn’t check the balcony again. Just sat on the bed, hands in my lap, and waited.

The stars outside blinked out one by one.

I didn’t see the shape move, but suddenly it wasn’t at the horizon anymore. It was outside the balcony rail. I looked at it too long, then too close. The edges weren’t straight after all. They bent if you stared.

Something hummed low in my teeth. My vision swam. The panel behind me made a soft, wet sound, like something sliding into place.

I kept thinking about that burger. How it dripped down my wrist. How good it was.

Then nothing.

- grind quality seems to be its own rabbit hole with with even £200+ machines not always being up to scratch. I’m not going to be able to beat the quality of the grinder the roasters uses.
- I’m not making espresso so I don’t need to dial in the grind consistency perfectly 
- I only buy around 2 weeks of coffee at a time and keep it in an air tight container. I’m not convinced I can really tell the difference when opening a fresh bag that is freshly ground. 

Considering these 3 points, I’m fairly convinced buying my own grinder isn’t worth it. But what do you think?

(I wish I knew this months ago) 😳,"I used to think I’d lost EVERYTHING when my ex left me. I’d lie awake at night going over everything I did wrong and how they had probably found someone better. It ate me up inside. Then one day I realised something huge. I didn’t lose HIM. He lost ME.

And then it hit me … you need to rethink the way you’re looking at this break up. Right now you’re putting them on a pedestal and seeing yourself as the one who wasn’t enough. The truth is they will never find another person like you. You are unique. No one else will love them exactly the way you did, put up with what you put up with, or give them what you gave. That is what they walked away from.

There is actually a bit of psychology behind this. When we are rejected, our brain lights up in the same area as physical pain. It tricks us into thinking the person who hurt us is more valuable than they are. We literally start idealising them because our brain is trying to “win them back” as a way to survive. Once I learned that, I started seeing things differently.

I’ll never forget the moment it really clicked for me. I was sitting in a coffee shop, scrolling through old photos of us, feeling sorry for myself. Then I remembered the times he made me cry, the way I always felt like I had to prove I was worth loving, and I thought, “Why am I mourning someone who treated me like that?” It hit me that I had been seeing myself as the loser when the real loser was him for losing me.

The biggest turning point for me was a book I found on Amazon it is called the trauma bunds cured. I’m not sure if I’m allowed to link it here but I will because it literally saved my life and made me rethink everything. It changed my mindset completely and gave me the strength to leave him in the past where he belongs.

So if you’re reading this, know this. YOU are not the one who lost. They are. You still have yourself, your future, and a chance to build a life that is ten times better than anything you had with them. That is powerful. One day you’ll look back and thank yourself for walking away from what wasn’t right for you. Keep going. You’re going to amaze yourself. ♥️♥️",1,1756152264.0,BreakUps,0,1.0,False

My family (5 of us; 38, 37, 17, 16, 11) is traveling to Europe for Christmas/New Years this year and we are doing 5 days in Paris. I've read that reservations are pretty much necessary for 5 people for dinners, so I was hoping to get some input on that as well as any restaurant recommendations. Its very overwhelming looking at everything so hoping some locals (or others that have traveled there) could weigh in! The first leg of our trip is London where we plan to eat a little more international, and we head to Venice & Rome after Paris, so we are hoping for some good traditional Parisian/French food. 

We'll be arriving in Paris on 12/24 (around lunchtime via Eurostar) and leaving fairly early on 12/29. I figured dinners for 12/24 and 12/25 are required no matter what, but what about the other days? We are staying in Le Marais, and are hoping dinners can be booked around the area that we'll be each day or our neighborhood, although I know Parisians tend to eat later so we can take transit around the city if the restaurant is great! An idea on our itinerary is below, and if you have any input on that we'll gladly take that as well! Obviously looking to avoid touristy spots and eat more like the locals - we're all pretty adventurous, so if there are any dishes you highly recommend please let us know!

12/24: Arrive, drop bags at hotel, visit Palais Garnier and Galleries Lafayette

12/25: Sacre-Coeur in the morning and then the Eiffel Tower, which looks to be open on Christmas?

12/26: Louvre in the morning, Musee d'Orsay in the afternoon

12/27: Notre Dame, Sainte-Chappelle. Pantheon, and Saint-Etienne-du-Mont

12/28: Versailles and maybe Musee de L'armee if time?

We are hoping to go to a Christmas Market the night of 12/24 as well, and view the Arc de Triomphe, but I don't think we're going to go to the top of that.

Will bakeries/cafes be open on Christmas to grab coffees/pastries? Are there any days we absolutely need to make lunch reservations (like Christmas)? Any advice is greatly appreciated as its our first family trip to Europe.",1,1756152259.0,ParisTravelGuide,1,1.0,False

These single-serve coffee pods are designed to fit Keurig 2.0 machines seamlessly. The pods make a quick cup in almost no time; just pop one in, press the button, and voilà—an aromatic brew is ready. I love the convenience it brings, especially when mornings are busy. The packaging is well thought out—designed to preserve freshness, so the last pod tastes just as good as the first.

**Flavor Profile**  

As someone picky about flavors, I was hooked with the first sip. The rich-yet-smooth combination of a medium roast with honey and hazelnut flavors is undeniably appealing. This blend delivers on flavor intensity without overwhelming the palate—a win in my book. It’s versatile, too; I’ve tried it hot, iced, and with a splash of cream, and it tastes fantastic every way I’ve tried.

**Positives**  

The product has a host of favorable attributes that make it a standout:  

- Keurig 2.0 compatibility for easy brewing.  
- Rich, smooth flavor with pleasant honey and hazelnut notes.  
- Convenient packaging, keeping pods fresh until use.  

**Negatives**  

Of course, nothing is without a few caveats:  

- Not the best option for people preferring a bolder roast.  
- Waste. The single-use pods generate a bit of guilt for the eco-conscious.  

**Quality Assurance**  

Community Coffee genuinely seems to care about quality. The fact that every coffee bean undergoes a rigorous scoring system for body, balance, flavor, and aroma resonates with me as a coffee enthusiast. Knowing this extra effort goes in behind the scenes makes every sip a little more enjoyable. For those who truly care about the origin and quality of what they’re drinking, this is a solid choice.

**Peer Products**  

While Community Coffee excels in delivering a balanced medium roast, options like Starbucks’ Pike Place Roast offer an alternative with slightly more caramel-like sweetness. On the other hand, Green Mountain’s Breakfast Blend is comparable in roast but feels lighter and less nuanced in flavor. Community Coffee stands out for me because its honey and hazelnut notes are more pronounced while maintaining depth.

**Price Performance**  

This coffee shines as a value proposition. Given the Keurig compatibility, high-quality Arabica beans, and fabulous flavor, the product feels worth every penny. Compared to pricier options, it competes exceptionally well in terms of taste and convenience.

1n00x6h,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1n00x6h,"How to charge power stations/batteries at slow 240V AC EV stations while on the road, utilizing both 240v and 120v with a current splitter.","Disclaimer: It does have a sign says EV only, but no EV here using them. Instead of idling, I could utilize it to charge my power stations. Especially I’m paying money like the EV owners, my money is as good as anyone else’s. It’s kind of breaking rules, but for over a year, I haven’t see any charger owners came to tell me I can’t use it because I’m not an EV. I usually park over night at an EV station while I need to charge to full. Electricity is cheaper in the night, less traffic, and cold temperatures in night, and I need a place for the night anyway.

Alright let’s get into the topic.

1, I’m at North America, so my example mainly work in NA. EU, Asia, South America use different voltage, pretty sure the power stations sold at those regions are different from NA version.

I haven’t tried, but you should be able to use a AC to DC charger to charge raw 12v/24v/48v DC batteries. Question, is there any 240V AC to DC charger?

2, this is a Rivian level 2, 240Vac/48A/11.5kW, EV charger. It could work at other brands like charge point, blink.

3, I’m using an Ecoflow Delta Pro to take 240Vac as input, and a Bluetti Apex 300 to take 120Vac as input(I know Apex 300 can take 240Vac with a dedicated cable, I will talk about that later)

4, The cables used, in the order.

A J1772 to Nema 14-50 adapter(rated 50amps, \*neutral line absent\*).

A NEMA 14-50P to 2x C19 splitter, each split rated 20amp

A C20 to C15 cable, which goes into Delta Pro’s AC port(C14 port), it’s 240Vac without step down.

A Stepdown says can do 5000w, but can only do 2500w stably, I keep the load under 2000w to avoid overheating/killing the unit. This stepdown is kind of fragile under heavy load.

I‘m not posting any links I don’t want to look like I’m earning cash back out of this or doing advertisement. I’m sure you can find them with google. After stepdown to 120v, I can basically plug any appliances that take 120Vac. I used a bug zapper as an example, but you can plug in your coffee machine or 120V air conditioner to it, as long as it doesn’t overload the step down.

5, One import thing I do want to point out, look at the Picture 7, both Apex 300 and Delta Pro use C14 port to take AC input.

The BIG DIFFERENCE here is Delta Pro can take 240Vac, while Apex 300 can only take 120Vac.

Apex 300 can take 240Vac as input, if I buy a $129 Nema 14-50 to P050A cable. Obviously Apex 300 internal structure can handle 240Vac, all they had to do is adding a switch, route the current if 240Vac is plugged in the C14 port. But they didn’t do it, for a product designed in 2025 Bluetti hasn’t thought of that. Delta Pro came out at 2021, yet Ecoflow did it correctly 4 years ago.

If I plug in the 240Vac into Apex 300, it will report a E113 voltage high error.

And for the $129 Nema 14-50 to P050A cable, it can do 50amp at 240v so 12kW maximum. I’m not sure I would buy it, since most of the time I just charge at a speed <1000w. I’d rather pay less money as for a slimmer cable rated with less amps for cheaper.

I might do a Apex 300 Vs Delta Pro comparison later, not a fair comparison since Delta Pro is from 2021, while Apex 300 is from 2025.

Miles said the island would fix me.

That’s what he called it — a fix. Like I was a leaky faucet or a busted wristwatch. I didn’t argue, because staying in his apartment meant listening to him chew cereal and pretend not to watch me. And I didn’t want anyone watching me. Not now.

The ferry smelled like hot engine grease and spilled sunscreen. I sat by the rail with my backpack between my feet, knees braced, and drank a Sprite I bought from a cooler kid. It was warm and tasted faintly of soap. My phone had no signal before we even left the harbor. I stared at the “No Service” text until it blurred.

The water started out green, then blue, then something I’d never seen. Clearer than clear — like air if air could hold its shape. You could see all the way down, white sand rippling in soft patterns, miles out. Looking at it felt like looking through a window that never ended.

---

#### The race

They said everyone builds their own boat. “It’s tradition,” Miles told me. My boat was two planks nailed into something vaguely floatable. It listed to one side if I sat wrong.

The air tasted like pennies that morning. Sharp. A crowd had gathered along the beach, laughing too much, clapping for boats that didn’t deserve it. Everyone acted like it mattered, though I couldn’t tell if they were serious.

When I pushed off, the hull shuddered like a cough. I paddled anyway. The water was glass, flat and dead calm, so clear I could see my boat’s shadow sliding across the bottom like a stingray. My oar made long black stripes every time I lifted it.

Then I noticed something else.

Another shadow. Moving under mine. Too sharp to be fish. No tail flick. No soft edges. A clean, exact line, cutting the sand in half as it glided. I leaned forward, trying to see. Sunlight burned the back of my neck. The more I squinted, the more I saw — an angle. A perfect corner, like the edge of a box, sliding right where the boat’s shadow was darkest.

The wind came fast. Like someone opened a door I didn’t know existed. My paddle flew out of my hands, the boat lurched hard, sky turning black before I even saw the clouds.

I remember the taste of metal in my mouth. Then water. Then nothing.

---

#### The room

I woke up in a bungalow that smelled of lemon polish and something sweet, like candy melted in a car. A man in a tan vest — no name tag, just a big smile — told me to rest. The ferries weren’t running “for now.” He said it like he’d said it a hundred times before, words worn smooth as pebbles.

The room was spotless. Bedspread flat enough to play pool on. Curtains thin as napkins. I turned the TV on — static, then a cooking show in some language I didn’t know. They were boiling white cubes in a pot. They looked too shiny to be food.

I stayed in bed the rest of that day, listening to my head throb like a loose drum. The walls had a carved trim running along the ceiling, little curls and hooks etched deep into the wood. Too exact to be random. Perfect little spirals folding into each other like someone had a ruler and nothing better to do.

That night I stepped out on the balcony. The air smelled metallic again. The sea was still as poured glass. Out at the horizon, I saw a spot where the stars stopped. Just gone. If I leaned left, the stars came back. Lean right — gone again. Like holding your hand up to the sky, except my hands were in my pockets.

I told myself I was tired. Just tired.

---

#### The panel

The next morning, the coffee tasted like wet rope. The sugar was hard as gravel. The front desk guy smiled too wide and said “maybe tomorrow” about the ferries, like he’d been waiting for me to ask.

Back in my room, I noticed a seam above the TV. A little square in the wall, neat as a pencil drawing. I pushed it. It clicked open.

Inside were three tall shapes. Smooth. Hollow. I thought of mannequins, but faceless, with no arms or legs, just long, narrow cavities where something should go. Two weren’t empty.

The pale material inside them wasn’t plastic. Not exactly. Too soft-looking. Almost wax, but not melting. The third one was bare.

I shut the panel fast. Sat on the bed. Thought about a burger I had in Utah once. Grease dripping down my wrist. Toasted bun. Salt on my lips. I thought about that burger for ten minutes, maybe twenty. Long enough to forget what I’d seen. Almost.

---

#### Nights

The gap in the stars looked closer the next night. Not much. Just enough I knew it wasn’t my imagination. I stared at it until my eyes hurt, then looked back at the wall.

The panel was open. I know I closed it. The empty shape inside looked darker. Like damp clay.

I moved a chair in front of it. Didn’t feel like enough.

---

#### Days

Time stretched. I couldn’t tell if it’d been three days or ten. The TV kept playing the same show with the cubes. The front desk guy kept saying “maybe tomorrow.” My skin smelled faintly like salt no matter how many showers I took.

I walked to the dock one morning. No boats. Just sand piling on the planks and a woman sweeping it off without looking up. I said hello. She didn’t answer. Didn’t even glance at me.

Back in my room, the air felt thick. Like breathing through cloth. I drank two Sprites from the mini fridge just to taste something sweet. Both were flat, almost bitter. I stared at the label until I realized the letters weren’t in English anymore.

That night the stars blinked out in a clean black wedge. Like someone had cut the sky with scissors.

---

#### Closer

I dreamed I couldn’t move my arms. Woke up standing barefoot on the carpet with my shirt twisted backward. The chair I’d left in front of the panel was pushed aside.

I didn’t open it. I didn’t need to. The smell of salt was stronger.

The gap on the horizon was closer still. Too close to be part of the sky now. I stepped onto the balcony and leaned out, heart racing — nothing but water. Except it wasn’t nothing. The black shape was there, blotting stars, silent, massive, waiting.

I went inside. Tried to think of that burger. Tried to remember the taste of cold orange juice in a sweating glass. Couldn’t.

---

#### Last night

The panel door hung wide open. The empty cavity wasn’t empty anymore. Something faint pressed against its inner walls, like frost or breath on glass.

I didn’t check the balcony again. Just sat on the bed, hands in my lap, and waited.

The stars outside blinked out one by one.

I didn’t see the shape move, but suddenly it wasn’t at the horizon anymore. It was outside the balcony rail. I looked at it too long, then too close. The edges weren’t straight after all. They bent if you stared.

Something hummed low in my teeth. My vision swam. The panel behind me made a soft, wet sound, like something sliding into place.

I kept thinking about that burger. How it dripped down my wrist. How good it was.

Then nothing.

1n00w61,https://www.reddit.com/r/SoundChecked/comments/1n00w61/should_the_best_single_serve_coffee_maker_be_the/,Should the best single serve coffee maker be the Keurig K-Mini,"The Keurig K-Mini coffee maker, specifically the K-Mini model, has quickly become my go-to machine for satisfying caffeine cravings, especially during hectic mornings. I’ve been a coffee enthusiast for years, and while I’ve cycled through several espresso machines and drip coffee brewers, I can confidently say that this device has carved a niche in my daily coffee ritual. Keurig has established its reputation for simplicity, and the K-Mini epitomizes that philosophy perfectly. Its small, sleek design and compact features immediately caught my attention, but there's more to this product than meets the eye.

**Design and Space Efficiency**

The tiny footprint of the Keurig K-Mini is one of its greatest strengths. At less than 5 inches wide, it effortlessly fits into tight spaces. Living in a city apartment where countertop real estate is almost as valuable as gold, this coffee maker feels tailor-made for my life. Its matte black finish adds a subtle elegance, making it more than just a functional appliance—it's a stylish addition to my kitchen. Cord storage at the back keeps everything tidy, which has been a blessing in an already cable-ridden household! I’ve even taken this machine to our family cabin, where its portability proved how travel-friendly it is.

**Ease of Use**

The simplicity of its operation is unbeatable. With a single cup reservoir, you just pour in freshwater for each brew, pop in a K-Cup pod, press a button, and voilà—freshly brewed coffee in minutes! There’s no fussy programming or multi-step processes to memorize, which means you can still operate it half-asleep (trust me, I have). The ability to brew anywhere from 6 to 12 ounces ensures versatility to suit different needs, whether it’s a quick shot of caffeine or a full travel mug before heading out.

[View Keurig K-Mini Coffee Maker deals on Amazon.](https://ultimodule.com/p/b07gv2s1gs/)

**Energy Efficiency and Practical Features**

The automatic shut-off feature is a thoughtful touch. The machine powers down just 90 seconds after brewing, which not only saves energy but also provides peace of mind for those mornings when I forget to turn it off before rushing out the door. The removable drip tray is another genius feature; it accommodates travel mugs up to 7 inches tall and even holds any accidental spills. Cleaning up coffee mishaps has never been easier. And while it doesn’t have advanced features like temperature control, I honestly didn’t miss them. Sometimes simplicity is all you need.

**Upsides**

- Space-saving design ideal for small kitchens, dorms, or offices  
- Straightforward operation with minimal setup requirements  
- Adjustable brew sizes between 6 to 12 ounces  
- Energy-saving auto-shutoff feature after 90 seconds  
- Lightweight and portable with cord storage  

**Areas for Improvement**

But not everything is perfect with the K-Mini. Although it delivers exceptional simplicity and efficiency, a few things might bother more tech-oriented coffee lovers:  
- Lacks temperature control adjustments, leaving no room for personal brewing preferences.  
- Requires adding water for each brew, which some users may find tedious compared to larger reservoir machines.  
- No frothing capability, eliminating milk-based coffee drinks from its repertoire.  
- Limited compatibility—it’s designed for K-Cups unless paired with the separately sold My K-Cup Universal Reusable Coffee Filter.  

**Performance**

I’ve tested its brewing speed, and it truly delivers coffee in under two minutes. That’s quicker than waiting in line at the café or setting up more complicated machines. Despite its speed, the coffee is fresh and well-extracted, providing a consistent taste every time. Keurig’s K-Cup variety ensures you’ll find something for every palate, from classic roasts to exotic blends and even tea or hot chocolate. However, for those who prefer using ground coffee, purchasing the reusable filter is essential.

**Product Competitors**

Compared to other single-serve brewers, Keurig’s K-Mini holds up remarkably well. Machines like the Nespresso Essenza Mini and the Hamilton Beach Scoop serve as direct rivals, with each offering its unique benefits. Nespresso focuses heavily on espresso and milk-based coffee lovers, offering better frothing capabilities but at a significantly higher overall cost, especially when factoring in pod exclusivity. Hamilton Beach's Scoop, on the other hand, skips the pods altogether, catering to purists who prefer ground coffee. However, it lacks the compact charm and visual appeal of the Keurig machine. What sets the K-Mini apart is the blend of its small form factor, fuss-free design, and compatibility with an extensive library of K-Cup pods.

**Smart Spending**

In terms of financial value, this device offers just the right balance between affordability and convenience. While it may not cater to high-end coffee snobs seeking barista-level customization, it’s perfect for anyone looking for a quick, reliable cup without breaking the bank. Versatility is its defining strength—it’s as much about practicality as it is about providing a morning (or afternoon) caffeine fix. For budget-conscious coffee fanatics, this is a solid investment. A minimal footprint, paired with optimal functionality, ensures you’re not just paying for a gimmick. It’s the kind of coffee maker that you’ll use daily without worrying whether you got your money’s worth.

Is therapy needed?,"I was a Temporary Park employee for 12 months at a Government park, and working with my boss at the time felt like I have known her for a lifetime, she was like a second mother to me, she was family to me , always checking on me, making sure I have everything that I need, always kind and thoughtful. I would tell her stories about my life and she would tell me stories about her life. it was like a bond like no other. She told me straight to my face that she sees me as her son.

When she found out I got a better job, she was supportive, we both cried and hugged each other, and I promised to see her more often at her job because my schedule is 9/80 where I work 8 days of 9 hours and one day of 8 hour and I get every other Friday off, I visit my old boss in those Fridays off.

Then I saw her picture of her daughter and I found her very pretty, she has so many pictures of her daughter in her office, she is beautiful . My old boss is in her 60s, I am 28 years old and she is 31 years old the daughter...but the daughter is married. 2 days after I met my old boss she was already married. Her daughter Is a nurse while her husband is a doctor.

I have never met her daughter nor spoke with her at all and I already have a huge crush on her even though she is married. I can't stop thinking about her for the past 10 months, every day for 10 months there is a cartoon in me where a cloud would show up above my head and it was showing film footage of me meeting her daughter at a bowling alley, introduced myself and she introduced herself and then we started talking at a bar counter where we was getting to know each other, I asked her out for a date and she said yes, next time we met up was at a coffee shop, then we would go to the malls together, watch movies together in cinema go to touristic spots together, and other fun things like you know other normal looking couple would do. Overall, I had a wild imagination about her.

I did something reckless earlier this year in February, I sent her daughter a follow request to her private instagram account, and she rejected. I did this because with the intent of becoming friends with her. My old boss would tell me stories about her and she would tell her a lot of stories about me, so her daughter knows a lot about me pretty much. Im worried that when I see my old boss the next time, haven't seen her since Late July, the times I've visited her at her job, she never brought this up....I'm worried that if ever I meet her daughter somewhere that her daughter may bring up the fact that I sent her a follow request on Instagram. I don't know what to respond if she does bring it up. I know for a fact that sending her a friend request is inappropriate, I know the appropriate way is to meet her naturally and then shake hands and then converse and then later down the line maybe send be friends with each other instagram that's the appropriate way I know. If I meet her I meet her, if I don't meet her at all then that's fine, it is what it is

My overall question is what steps can I take to forget about her, do I need therapy? Should I tell my old boss what Im going through or leave it be? Your tips are much appreciated",2,1756151886.0,AskMen,1,0.75,False

Happiness is you standing there, at the door, waiting for me to be close enough to tell me some exciting news you just got. Happiness is when you ask me a question about this strange feeling I am describing, which I don’t know where it comes from, but you are there trying to understand. Happiness is coming home, having a meal with my favorite people, crying over the funniest story of all time. I’ve heard it a million times, but you are just mesmerizing to watch.

Happiness is seeing your text every morning, worrying if I already did the same thing I always do, but you know that if I miss it, my mood will change. Happiness is not having this stomach pain when I see your interest in what someone else is doing on my favorite holiday, the one you forgot. When that was the most important thing for me.



Happiness is the sleepover at your house, and listening to you talk about how inconsiderate people are, and telling you that they don’t matter as long as you don’t lose yourself by being at their level. Happiness is going on that trip with you, when the wind was in our hair, you driving the jet ski. You know I was so scared, but I trusted you, you cared for me. Happiness is watching you go out of your way to make people happy. I wish I was a little bit more like you. Happiness is watching you go out after that crappy ex-boyfriend broke into your house. He thought you cheated, you never did. Happiness is us, by each other’s side since teenage years. One more year and we’d say we’re officially going to be friends forever, because we reached that milestone. So exciting. Happiness is not this empty feeling after you wrote me that you don’t want to see me ever again because you heard something in the hallways. You thought I spread the rumor. I never did, but you didn’t believe me.



Happiness is waking up in the morning, excited for the smell of coffee, ready to step outside. Happiness is commuting while listening to a great song, excited to arrive and share some news you just read, or to tell them about this show you just watched, insisting they need to watch it with you. Happiness is going to practice and seeing her, the girl who always makes you laugh. They always tell you how funny you are, but you tell her that. Happiness is getting home, eating mom’s food, and hearing her from the hallway having a little stupid fight with dad. Happiness is seeing his tail crashing on every wall, he can’t stop zooming around when he sees you. He is the most adorable dog you’ve ever seen. You’d love to believe he loves you. Happiness is not feeling that the only living thing that can love you is your dog, the one you voluntarily got for that same reason. Happiness is not going to bed wishing you won’t have to see and feel all these things again. Happiness is not writing down all the things that make you want to vomit inside yourself.

While my weight has fluctuated over the last almost 7 months, I learned a month ago it was likely due to my sodium intake, which I’ve reduced by going on the DASH Diet as recommended by my doctor. 

Last Monday I weighed 205.4lbs. Today I weighed myself and I weigh 205.6lbs. Last Wednesday I went 400 calories over, but other than that I’ve been sticking to my goal of 1,700 calories/day. I’m usually below that (closer to 1,600). My calorie deficit goal is also based on a sedentary lifestyle. 

I’ve gone for walks for 5 of the last 7 days in which my daily average step-count is almost 14,000.

I’m beginning to feel a little discouraged because I’m literally doing everything I have done over the last almost 7 months and would advise others to do. I’m not constipated. I have tried flushing my system out by drinking a small pot of black coffee, I’ve increased my water intake by an extra cup or two daily. 

While I know it’s not uncommon for our weight to fluctuate, I would not expect it to be remain stagnant over a 7-day period while being in a calorie deficit, going for lengthy walks, drinking water, etc.

I’m going to mention this to my doctor when I see her tomorrow. In the meantime, have any of you had a stretch where your weight was stagnant despite doing almost everything correctly? If so, did you do anything healthy to give your body a boost so you’re back to losing weight?",1,1756151824.0,loseit,2,0.67,False

1n00t9n,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1n00t9n,"How to charge power stations/batteries at slow 240V AC EV stations while on the road, utilizing both 240v and 120v with a current splitter.","Disclaimer: It does have a sign says EV only, but no EV here using them. Instead of idling, I could utilize it to charge my power stations. Especially I’m paying money like the EV owners, my money is as good as anyone else’s. It’s kind of breaking rules, but for over a year, I haven’t see any charger owners came to tell me I can’t use it because I’m not an EV. I usually park over night at an EV station while I need to charge to full. Electricity is cheaper in the night, less traffic, and cold temperatures in night, and I need a place for the night anyway.

Alright let’s get into the topic. 

1, I’m at North America, so my example mainly work in NA.  EU, Asia, South America use different voltage, pretty sure the power stations sold at those regions are different from NA version.

I haven’t tried, but you should be able to use a AC to DC charger to charge raw 12v/24v/48v DC batteries.  Question, is there any 240V AC to DC charger?

2, this is a Rivian level 2, 240Vac/48A/11.5kW, EV charger. It could work at other brands like charge point, blink.

3, I’m using an Ecoflow Delta Pro to take 240Vac as input, and a Bluetti Apex 300 to take 120Vac as input(I know Apex 300 can take 240Vac with a dedicated cable, I will talk about that later)

4, The cables used, in the order. 

A J1772 to Nema 14-50 adapter(rated 50amps, \*neutral line absent\*). 

A NEMA 14-50P to 2x C19 splitter, each split rated 20amp

A C20 to C15 cable, which goes into Delta Pro’s AC port(C14 port), it’s 240Vac without step down. 

A Stepdown says can do 5000w, but can only do 2500w stably, I keep the load under 2000w to avoid overheating/killing the unit. This stepdown is kind of fragile under heavy load.

I‘m not posting any links I don’t want to look like I’m earning cash back out of this or doing advertisement. I’m sure you can find them with google. After stepdown to 120v, I can basically plug any appliances that take 120Vac. I used a bug zapper as an example, but you can plug in your coffee machine or 120V air conditioner to it, as long as it doesn’t overload the step down.

5,  One import thing I do want to point out, look at the Picture 7, both Apex 300 and Delta Pro use C14 port to take AC input. 

The BIG DIFFERENCE here is Delta Pro can take 240Vac, while Apex 300 can only take 120Vac. 

Apex 300 can take 240Vac as input, if I buy a $129 Nema 14-50 to P050A cable. Obviously Apex 300 internal structure can handle 240Vac, all they had to do is adding a switch, route the current if 240Vac is plugged in the C14 port. But they didn’t do it, for a product designed in 2025 Bluetti hasn’t thought of that.  Delta Pro came out at 2021, yet Ecoflow did it correctly 4 years ago.

If I plug in the 240Vac into Apex 300, it will report a E113 voltage high error.

And for the $129 Nema 14-50 to P050A cable, it can do 50amp at 240v so 12kW maximum. I’m not sure I would buy it, since most of the time I just charge at a speed <1000w. I’d rather pay less money as for a slimmer cable rated with less amps for cheaper.

I might do a Apex 300 Vs Delta Pro comparison later, not a fair comparison since Delta Pro is from 2021, while Apex 300 is from 2025.

Thanks for reading.

For a while, I used ""substances"" as life enhancers, and today reminded me of those old days, a boost for my mind, maybe, but overall, they're shit.

Most mornings, I wake up tired, yet going to bed late. My sleep pattern is a freestyle, so I forget the value of starting small. Even tiny steps count. Like today, three push-ups, some coffee and a cigarette, and three hours spent on my phone without moving from bed. But honestly, compared to nothing, those push-ups feel like progress.

I keep telling myself to take it slow. Don’t overthink it. It’s OK to chill out and give yourself the space to relax. It’s often in those slower moments that you notice the little rewards life gives you, the good stuff that seems to show up when you really care about what you’re doing.

And then there’s that inner voice. It’s quiet, but it’s got power. It’s super easy to ignore it, to look away, to hope the pressure just fades. But if you actually listen, you get a glimpse of real peace, a sense you can’t really put into words. If you stop denying its existence a window opens to his powerful insights and ideas about your purpose.

It’s like someone reaching out a hand and all you have to fucking do is to grab it...

But then, bam, fear shows up. Suddenly, you’re anxious and stuck, can’t make a decision. That fear just kind of wraps around you, and it doesn’t have to fight; you’re already feeling weak and exposed. When that happens, it’s like your mind gets overloaded. The body keeps going and can fight back fast, but if your spirit is stuck, nothing moves.

So all you can do is try to listen in, take it easy, and let yourself move at your own pace. Progress isn’t always loud or dramatic. Sometimes the best thing is just to answer that quiet voice and keep going, one step at a time.",1,1756151709.0,PoetryWritingClub,1,1.0,False

* She complimentes me and playfully pinches or teases me 
* Buys me coffee or drinks (though i do the same sometime but its something we do mostly for both of us)

TLDR: 
Outdoorsy heart, geeky brain, animal lover. 🎮🖼️
Thoughtful, caring, and ready for someone loving, funny, and full of life.
Make me laugh, beat me at Halo (if you can), and let’s see where it goes.

The Long Version:
I’m someone who believes the best relationships are built on laughter, kindness, and genuine connection. Friends would describe me as thoughtful, caring, and the kind of person who remembers the little things. I love the outdoors, whether it’s a peaceful hike, a day at the park, or just watching the sunset.

When I’m not outside, you might find me exploring my love for computers and video games, visiting a museum, or appreciating art in all its forms. Animals hold a special place in my heart, and I’m happiest when I’m sharing life with a fellow good-spirited soul.

What I’m Looking For
I’m hoping to meet someone loving, funny, and full of life, someone who’s up for adventures big and small, from deep conversations over coffee to spontaneous weekend getaways. A good heart and a great sense of humor are always welcome here.

If you’re looking for a partner who will listen, laugh, and grow with you, I’d love to hear from you.

* **How would you prioritize form factor (ultrabook, 2-in-1, etc.), build quality, performance, and battery life?** Battery life is one of her big pain points currently.

I went to the dentist and got them cleaned professionally, but the stains started coming back just two weeks later.

I brush my teeth three times a day, usually for at least 4 minutes each time. I use both a regular toothbrush and an electric one. I don’t drink soda, tea, or coffee, and I try to follow a healthy diet.

My family suspects it might be something in the water here (like high iron or minerals), but the dentist couldn’t really give me a clear reason why this is happening. I’m starting to feel frustrated and like it’s not even worth it to try anymore.

1n00l9o,https://www.reddit.com/r/CharlotteDobreYouTube/comments/1n00l9o/my_friends_disowned_me_because_i_left_the_mormon/,My friends disowned me because I left the Mormon church,"I grew up in the Mormon church and followed all the strict Mormon rules. I didn’t grow up in Utah and didn’t have a traditional Mormon upbringing. My mom was mentally ill and believed that the “Holy Ghost” had instructed her to ab@#e her kids. I was physically ab@#ed throughout my childhood with several near death experiences. It was very twisted and severe violence. My mom would often play church music after hurting me and that music is still triggering to me today. I reported my ab@#e to multiple Mormon bishops throughout my childhood and was only told that if I were a better kid, I’d be hurt less. I was a good kid. But tried harder to be perfect. I chalked up the Mormon lack of empathy to this occurring in the 1990s, and maybe that was the norm at the time. 

Fast forward to 2023. I came across a podcast which discussed the systemic issue of ab@#e within the Mormon church. I learned that the church’s ab@#e hotline actually took callers to the church’s law office where they would typically advise bishops to not go to authorities. I was hurt and mad. It took me down a rabbit hole with more research. I quickly learned that everything I ever thought I knew about the Mormon church was a lie. I felt hurt that I spent almost 40 years giving time and money to such a harmful and dishonest organization. 

Here’s where the mean friends come in. I tell my friends that I’m leaving the Mormon church because the church ignores child crimes and victim blames. I also learned the founder had 34 wives, married to multiple children and the founder was an abusive fellow as well. My friends said I just need to “get over” my child ab@#e. Pretty immediately, most all my friends disowned me. I learned later that this is a typical cult response. These friends were people that I was friends with for over 10 years. I paid their mortgage, babysat kids for free, took them on free trips, was always supportive and very inclusive. I still continued to be nice to these people by giving them free football tickets and by watching their kids. But my niceties didn’t help. I’d see a group of 20 Mormons at the park, wave hi and only 1 would wave back.

I did have one friend, let’s call her Karen, that didn’t disown me right away. We’d go to lunch 2-3 times a month, I’d drop her off treats, and her kids played at my house almost every weekend. I would tell Karen how happy I am that she was still nice to me. Karen has a holiday party every year and it sometimes overlaps my daughter’s birthday party. I texted Karen inviting her daughter to my daughter’s party and asked when her party was, because I didn’t want to have it on the same date. Karen told me that I wasn’t invited to her party because I wasn’t Mormon anymore. I told her that I don’t care what religion my friends are and I’m fine with going as an exmormon. Karen had seen online that I was making new friends and I think she was jealous. Karen texted me some hurtful things about how me and my children need to be damned to hell. She said because I have broken Mormon covenants, I shouldn’t be rewarded by attending her party. (I didn’t do anything morally bad, just drank coffee, occasional alcohol and stopped wearing Mormon underwear). 

The next day, I texted her and asked if we could meet in person. I told her that some of her words might not have landed right and it would be better to have a face to face conversation. She picked me up in her car and screamed at me for over an hour. It turns out she really wasn’t my friend, but was just gathering dirt on me to spread to all the other Mormon women. She screamed at me for drinking coffee. She was angry! Doubled down on how my family needs to be damned. She said that she had screenshotted a comment I made online on a post that said, “Are Mormon men jerks?” And I commented “Some are, but some aren’t.” 

Apparently, she sent that to every single Mormon she knew. She even sent it to parents of my kids’ friends and told them to stop letting their kids play with my kids. As someone who was physically ab@#ed for 7 additional years after multiple reports to a Mormon bishop, I felt like I had a right to say some Mormon men are jerks. But some really are nice people.

My kids were good friends with Karen’s kids, I didn’t want to ruin that. I was as nice as possible to Karen, because I didn’t want my kids and her kids losing friendships. I still had Karen’s daughter attend my daughter’s party and I didn’t go to Karen’s party, as I wasn’t allowed. I really tried to be the bigger person. A month later, Karen even met up with my husband and told him lies about me to try to break up our marriage. This was the last straw. My therapist said I needed to block Karen. I texted Karen, telling her what she did was unhealthy and I’m going to follow my therapist’s advice and block her. I live close to Karen and see her often in the neighborhood. I wave to her and say hi when I see her, she just trudges and will never say hi back. It’s been a year and I’m happy I blocked her. 

With time, I’ve realized it was a controlling friendship and one sided. I’ve made lots of new friends that I can drink coffee with and they are supportive and emotionally mature. I can be myself around my new friends and feel love that I never felt before from friends. I guess the moral of the story is, find friends that are unconditional.

This next part is where things turn bad. She was doing what she was more than likely trained to do, which is offer me another seat on another flight - I told her no thanks, I can't miss this flight. She finished typing something on the computer and handed me my ID back. I then called my friend who dropped me off and told him to turn around so I could give him my bag, and I'll just figure out how to get my bag later. He could ship me the luggage; it was just my golf clubs, and there are tons of services out there for this exact reason. As I walk to TSA and get to the TSA Agent, I notice I can no longer pull up my boarding pass. I was unchecked in from my flight. I was super confused and ran back to the ticket counter (this airport is tiny, and its a 2 min walk) with no AA employee there again. The kiosk next to AA was a woman working for Delta - she said, ""Is there something maybe I can help you with?"" I told her my situation, and she responded to me, telling me she heard the whole exchange and was very surprised. She said I will try to find her for you and grabbed a radio + made a phone call. She couldn't find or get a response from the two AA employees who were there. I figured maybe if I could get past TSA, I would be fine, and this is just a mistake, so I ran back to TSA. I was able to speak to two TSA agents, plus the lead TSA supervisor who asked me for my ID and he told me he would walk to the gate because we were about to start boarding in 10 min - from there he could ask her to print my boarding pass or send someone to the ticket counter. When he came back, he told me she refused to help and said it felt like she just did not care. 

At this point, I'm pretty upset. I called AA customer support and spoke to a very nice lady. Right when we got connected, they started to board first class - she told me, unfortunately, there was nothing she could do for me, and it's only someone at the airport who would be able to help. I get back in line at the ticket counter, and I stand there and wait. Finally, she walks back - yet she is holding a bag of Dunkin' Donuts and a coffee, sees me and goes straight to the back. I'm sure ALL of this is on camera.

 I was able to rebook with someone else, unfortunately, they couldn't rebook me 1^(st) class, and I still had to wait in that line for over an hour to check my original bag in. I submitted this to Customer Relations and got a generic response back.

So recently I matched with a guy on a dating app. We texted a bit and he suggested we meet up right away. I figured, why waste weeks messaging if it might not click in person? We went for a walk around my neighborhood, talked for hours and honestly there was a spark.

Second date he invited me over for dinner, which felt too soon, so I told him that. He was totally fine with it and suggested another walk instead. We ended up in his area, stayed out until late just talking again. No intimacy yet, except some looks, but good vibes overall.

Last week he had family visiting, so we didn’t meet up, but he texted me every day with updates and pictures, which I liked. Now his family’s gone and I asked if we want to see ea h other again this week, to which he agreed. He suggested we meet in a couple of days after work (he’s a lawyer working in Court and has a big deadline). around 8pm. He was sorry that he couldn’t make it earlier due to his deadline. I just said that’s fine with me bc I don’t expect anything big and he told me about his deadline early on it’s nothing new and I know since his family stayed for the week, he couldn’t work on it. I just want to see him again and spend some time with him.

Here’s my thing: I don’t just want to be someone he casually fits in between work and life. I’d like us to actually do something and get to know each other more intentionally, not just walk around all the time.

He’s been consistent with sharing about his life, but he doesn’t ask much about me I usually share something aswell if he does and that keeps the convo going. Not sure if that says anything, or if I’m overthinking.

1n00ij1,https://www.reddit.com/r/BreakUps/comments/1n00ij1/ex_22f_broke_up_from_exhaustion_were_meeting/,"Ex (22F) broke up from exhaustion, we’re meeting tomorrow I’ve realized my part, but also that I don’t want to be the only one making efforts again","I (23M) dated my ex (22F) for 8 months. It was my first real relationship. She ended things a month ago saying she still loved me, but felt exhausted, overwhelmed, and maybe we just weren’t right together.

When I look back, I see both sides.  
On mine: I overanalyzed everything, pushed too many talks, wanted us to be “perfect.” That created pressure. I was anxious and always looking for reassurance.  
On hers: she had a full schedule (soccer, jobs, family, friends). She wasn’t good at taking initiative with me. If I didn’t start conversations, nothing happened. Even when she texted, she often told me it was an “effort” to do so even if she liked our talks. That made it hard for me to feel happy receiving her texts, because they felt like chores.

The paradox is: the moments we actually spent together were incredible. We laughed, felt close, and it all felt natural. But between those moments, the communication and balance weren’t there. I wanted to feel like a priority, not like I was forcing myself into her agenda.

**Timeline since the breakup:**

* Breakup: she said she didn’t believe in us anymore. I said “goodbye.” She replied “I’ll never forget you, I still love you.”
* 1 week later: I asked for a call. I stayed calm; she cried. I admitted my mistakes, told her I was leaving to visit my family and friends (hadn’t seen them in 3 years), and said maybe we could grab a drink when I got back.
* During my trip: she asked me not to text too often but she wanted some, and also admitted that if *she* had to text me first, she’d overthink and feel bad. So once again, I had to take responsibility. I respected her limit (sent 1–2 light texts, nothing more).
* After the trip: I reached out again like she wanted, asked if she wanted to grab a coffee. She said yes right away and suggested days. We’re meeting tomorrow.

At first, I accepted it. I told myself that everyone struggles with some things in relationships, and that was just her way. But with time, I realized I wasn’t asking for the world. What I wanted was normal: to feel included, to share time, to see her take initiative too.

Instead, every time she gave me space in her schedule, it felt like she was making a huge sacrifice. Like I had to see it as an “enormous effort.” I was waiting for it to be natural for her  to want to make time for me, to take some steps forward on her own. But in reality, I was always the one adapting, managing, and accepting her plans, often without even knowing them in advance.

That really hit me during my trip. I compared it with how my friends handle their relationships, and I realized how unbalanced mine was. Even during the call one week after the breakup, I can see now that I acted like a clown I agreed again to carry the responsibility she didn’t want to take.

Now, I’m conflicted. On one side, I still have feelings and I want to see her. On the other, I don’t want to fall back into the same dynamic where I’m the only one carrying things. Even this coffee is happening because I asked  she’s never been the one to take that step. But yeah I still love her....",1,1756151040.0,BreakUps,1,1.0,False

Maybe it’s because I’m somewhat young, but many of the people I see shitting on coffee dates are in my age range (20-22) or a little older. 

First off it’s a good way to ease into spending more formal or longer amounts of time with someone you don’t know that well. Going out to a fancy dinner or having a 3 hour date is cool if you know you guys click, but it’s better to keep it short and go on more dates after. The second thing is that it is inexpensive. Everyone has different preferences about who pays, some people believe the guy should, some people say split, some people say whoever asked should pay. I always come prepared to split but I do think it’s romantic if the guy pays and that definitely increases the chance I’ll want to continue seeing the guy. 

Regardless I don’t think getting to know someone at first should cost much money! Either we each pay 6-7$ for a coffee, someone pays less than 15$ whatever. If we click then we continue to date, if we don’t we can move on without money wasted. 
It’s also much more comfortable as a woman to be able to easily wrap up a date if it goes south and the guy is creepy. I don’t get what’s what with the whole “we need to go to a fancy restaurant and movie” for a first date.

Okay, so... About a year and a half ago my mother's husband (technically my stepfather but he's never exactly earned that title, whole other story) was laid off from his IT job for a private school. Our rental was falling apart and our landlord did minimal to fix the problems. The solution my mom and I came up with was I (38f), my two kids (12f and 10m), and my partner (36m) would move in and help make ends meet while he looked for a job and then we could save for a new place for our soon to be growing family (I was pregnant at the time).

Here we are, nearly year and a half later. He hasn't found a full time job in his field. He won't get a part time job at a box store (Walmart, home depot, etc) because its too hard on his body to stand that long he says. He also won't do something like door dash or lyft or anything else despite my practically begging for help because in addition to my own bills (car payment, cell phones for me and the kids, car insurance, storage unit for all our belongings when we moved in) I now pay for all the groceries for seven people, counting formula and diapers and whatnot for the baby.

1n00ak0,https://www.reddit.com/r/BuiltToTest/comments/1n00ak0/should_you_buy_the_best_electric_kettle_peach/,Should You Buy the Best Electric Kettle Peach Street PE-1302,"Using the Peach Street PE-1302 electric kettle for over a month has provided a mix of satisfaction and insight into its performance. I put it to work every day for my morning coffee, evening tea, and the occasional hot chocolate binge. This product stands out as a practical appliance for frequent, fast boiling needs, but it’s not without its quirks.  

**Design and Aesthetic Appeal**  
The borosilicate glass body of the kettle is undeniably elegant, adding a modern and sleek vibe to my kitchen counter. This is complemented by brushed 304 stainless steel accents that elevate its overall premium feel. Watching the blue LED light illuminate as water starts boiling creates a sense of high-tech sophistication. The kettle is thoughtfully designed with measurement markers on the glass, making it easy to fill to my desired level. The cool-touch handle is another highlight, ensuring safety when carrying hot water, but the brushed finish tends to show smudges more easily, requiring frequent cleaning to maintain its pristine look.

**Performance and Speed Boil Feature**  
This electric kettle does not leave you waiting long. Backed by 1500 watts of power and an OTTER controller, water reaches a rolling boil impressively fast. Making a cup of coffee becomes a breeze, even on those rushed mornings. I’ve boiled just enough water for a single mug or filled it up to the 1.7-liter capacity, and the process is equally efficient. However, the speed can sometimes lead to noticeable steam buildup, so using it in a well-ventilated area is wise.  

**Check the price for Peach Street PE-1302 on [Amazon](https://vendm.com/p/b0b2q7n54s/).**

**Safety Measures at Work**  
A standout feature of this kettle is its auto shut-off mechanism, which activates as soon as the water begins to boil. This has been invaluable for preventing potential dry boiling incidents, especially on busy days when distractions are a given. The concealed heating element is another strong point from a health perspective, ensuring no toxins leach into the water. Although handling is generally safe, the warning not to pour with the lid open feels a bit restrictive, as forgetting this could lead to messy spills.

**Key Benefits**  
- Rapid boiling time supported by 1500 watts of power.  
- Stylish borosilicate glass and stainless steel build.  
- Auto shut-off ensures safety by preventing over-boiling.  
- Cool-touch handle for easy, secure pouring.  
- Marked measurements on the glass for precise water levels.  

**Critiques to Keep in Mind**  
- Brushed stainless steel requires frequent cleaning to stay smudge-free.  
- Steam buildup can feel excessive in enclosed spaces.  
- Slightly cumbersome warning to avoid pouring with the lid open.  

**Functionality and Ergonomics**  
Using the 360° rotating base has been a game-changer for accessibility. You can grab and place the kettle back on the base from any angle, making it ideal for a shared kitchen where everyone has their preferred way of accessing appliances. The built-in mesh filter is handy for steeping tea bags directly, and the top button opening mechanism adds to its convenient design. Cleaning and refilling are simple, thanks to the wide mouth opening. However, I’ve noticed that the mesh filter, while functional, needs regular rinsing to avoid sediment buildup.

**Competing Products**  
Comparing this kettle to other leading brands like the Mueller Ultra Kettle or the Hamilton Beach Glass Kettle, it holds its ground in terms of both aesthetics and performance. While some competitors offer temperature settings for more precise boiling (something this kettle lacks), the Peach Street PE-1302 excels in simplicity and ease of use. It’s also slightly more lightweight than others, making it easy to handle. Hamilton Beach’s models, by contrast, often include features like programmable settings but seem bulkier on the counter.  

**Price to Quality Ratio**  
For the price range this electric kettle sits in, it delivers solid value. It meets key needs—rapid boiling, safety measures, sleek design—without breaking the bank. While it lacks certain premium features like customizable temperature controls, it compensates with reliability and straightforward functionality. Of course, budget-conscious buyers may appreciate its affordability compared to more sophisticated alternatives.

I want an espresso machine, but I also want a “crowd pleaser” that can make everything from drip to espresso to milk frothing. My large extended family is always over and they have standard Starbucks taste, so I think I would get the most use out of a ninja. I’ve also never had even a basic coffee machine. After researching all of them intensely, I think my wisest decision would be to start simple with ninja luxe and go from there. I already have a Barata grinder for what it is worth.

My question is — when I want to add a piece of machinery that can do “better espresso” (my favorite drinks are nice cappuccinos and cortados) —will I be on the hook to buy one of these super expensive brevilles to get the good espresso, when I no longer need its other functions? Or is there an espresso making only option that I could add to my ninja to make “better quality” espresso without having to fork over $1k for another machine?

They kind of go hand in hand. However recently i heard something from some yt video, i never actually thought about in depth but now it makes so much sense for me and kind of transformed the way i approach my entire home. 

and that is the fact that there are two types of items in your house. 

display items & storage items. 

and funny enough most of the items people display should actually be stored instead, while the stuff that should be stored should be pretty much decorative items only. This also explains to me why for example too much open shelving kills any sort of interior design there is for me from the start without realizing. Like... no your 50 different coffee mugs are not decorative items that should be on display... they should be stored just as much as your toothbrush, shoes, bagpack or whatever else should be stored. (especially if you want your home to look like you re an adult and not a teenagers dorm room) 

art should be on display or plants. 

  
its kind of mindblowing to me that its so simple but i never actively put any thoughts into it. it kind of transformed my home and how i view things. anything that is not a display item on purpose needs to have a specific storage space thats out of sight, otherwise it has to go because it means i am out of storage.

today, i went and cleaned my cats' litter box (we have a litter robot). i dumped out the old litter and the waste, wiped out the inside and the drawer, replaced the bag, refilled the litter hopper and vacuumed up the area around it. i even pulled out our mini freezer and vacuumed the bits behind that, and vacuumed the kitchen (i know that sounds weird, but we have a shark that does bare floor, and i like using that much more than i like sweeping). then i plugged my mini vacuum in for recharge since it was dead, grabbed the kitty litter and took it to the dumpster, and took two bags of clothes from the closet to my car that i'm planning on donating. when i got back i put the dirty dishes in the dishwasher for a cycle including my husband's coffee cup that he left on his desk. i put some ice in the garbage disposal to clean it out and refilled my four ice cube trays as well as my water bottle. i filled and started our water distiller (for cpap usage) and then took our cocker spaniel out for a bathroom break. i took a big jug of water and a jar of cat food out to our community cats (that i'm currently trying to get TNR'd). there was an extra cat there i haven't seen before, a skinny gray tabby with a white chin that ran when they saw me. i'm not sure if they were young or just hungry, but they were pretty small. i didn't see the longhaired black cat that's usually out there, and he didn't run out, which worries me a little. i hope he's okay.

after all that i made myself some breakfast. i really didn't feel like cooking or eating so i made a simple pb&j. i've been making a lot of pb&j for the past month because it's hot, cooking is something i have lots of trouble getting myself to do, and it gets my blood sugar up without making me feel sick. oh, and a juicy clementine. it's pretty late in the day and i should have ate earlier, but at least i'm eating something. now i am listening to lofi and working on a presentation that i have to do tomorrow. i have a bit of anxiety about that because i don't like public speaking but i am glad to be getting it out of the way. after that i need to work on a paper that's due (i'm in graduate school) and tonight i want to watch a movie with my husband that's assigned for class.

i did quite a bit even though it felt like moving mountains to get started. tomorrow i'm hoping to vacuum the carpets and at least start on cleaning the bathroom, which i'm behind on.",3,1756150363.0,brag,2,1.0,False

**Symptoms before medication:** either no motivation for anything, or I’d hyperfixate on something unimportant the whole day. Starting tasks felt impossible. Getting out of bed was horrible. Things that were supposed to be fun weren’t fulfilling. For example, I’d look forward to a new game, play it for a week, and then suddenly lose all motivation to keep playing. I was always chasing a quick dopamine fix (like doomscrolling).

On 18mg, I didn’t feel any difference. I’ve been on 36mg for almost a month now, still drinking my usual amount of caffeine, and the only real change I’ve noticed is that when someone texts me, I don’t overthink as much. I just write what I want to say. But this isn’t consistent. Some days it works, other days it doesn’t. Same with socializing. Some days, conversations flow more naturally. Other days it's the same as before. 

Another thing I’ve noticed is that before medication if I hyperfocused on something, I had to force myself to eat. Now with Concerta it’s not just hard to start eating. It feels like my body tells me much sooner than before that I’ve had enough and should stop. 

Concentration at work hasn’t improved much. I still get distracted by everything. Sleep hasn’t really changed. Overall, I just feel a little more awake.

**My current routine at work:** not enough sleep, then 36mg Concerta in the morning, followed by coffee or an energy drink. At work (warehouse job), I blast music and use body doubling, and that keeps me somewhat functional. But if someone talks to me or a random thought pops up, my motivation disappears/shifts. If I’m not listening to music, my motivation is gone. I feel like I’m constantly understimulated.

I’m getting blood work done next Monday, and if everything looks fine, the plan is to increase the dose to 54mg. Everyone in my family has a fast metabolism. So could it be that my dose is just too low, or that Concerta isn’t the right medication since it’s slow-releasing? How do I know when I’ve reached the right dose or if I should try a different medication?

Another thing is that if someone is talking to me, I get the urge to be doing something right away, because otherwise I find it impossible to keep listening. If I’m talking, I stop what I was doing and focus completely on me talking. Shouldn't this get better with medication?",2,1756150356.0,Concerta,1,1.0,False

I am thinking of staying at the Kex, as we have done so before and enjoyed our stay! 

My question is, do you think it is relatively safe to park both cars on the streets near the Kex? We did that with one car last time and it seemed fine, especially for free street parking. We parked near Roseline Coffee and had no issues. I know to keep nothing in the car and we’ve had nothing but good experiences (no car break-ins the past ~15 times we’ve visited Portland). I’m sure I’m overthinking it, but would really love to not pay for a broken window. My other thought was to park both cars in a more residential neighborhood, such as Ladd’s Addition or somewhere off Hawthorne, considering we generally don’t like to drive anyway once we get to Portland. Are there any permits required for neighborhood parking or any issues we’d run into if we went with that plan? Sorry for the silly question and thanks in advance for the responses!

Today, denim is a symbol of casual cool — from runways to coffee shops to backyard barbecues. But rewind to the 1870s American West, and jeans were the working man's armor. Picture prospectors clambering into gold dusted hills, tools jangling, pants ripping. That's where Levi Strauss comes in.

Strauss was a Bavarian immigrant who sold dry goods in San Francisco. One of his customers, a Latvian tailor named Jacob Davis, had an unusual problem: his customers kept tearing the pockets off their pants. To solve it, Davis reinforced them with metal rivets. It worked so well that he wanted to patent the idea — but he didn’t have the money. Enter Levi Strauss. The two partnered up, filed the patent in 1873, and made rugged, riveted pants in a sturdy fabric called “denim” — named after the French ""serge de Nîmes.""

Early jeans were strictly utilitarian — brown canvas at first, switching to blue jeans because indigo dye clung to the outer threads and faded attractively. Cowboys, railroad workers, and farmers wore them. But over time, jeans evolved... dramatically.

In the 1950s, thanks to Hollywood rebels like James Dean and Marlon Brando, jeans broke free from manual labor and marched into youth culture. By the '70s, they were flared and bedazzled. By the '90s, grungy and torn. Today? Pick your fit — skinny, baggy, high-rise, acid-washed — they’re everywhere.

Funny that something born out of necessity, in a gold rush town, is now sold for hundreds on fashion runways. Maybe we all just want to wear something tough enough to survive mining — and stylish enough to tell a story.",1,1756150090.0,ForbiddenFacts101,0,1.0,False

Use a structured JSON format to tell the AI *exactly* what you want, how you want it, and in what format. It gives you more control, consistency, and far better results. Copy the template in the post to get started.

Ever feel like you're playing a guessing game with AI? You ask for something and get back a response that’s… okay, but not quite right. Maybe it’s too short, misses key details, or the formatting is all wrong.

The problem isn't the AI; it's the ambiguity of our instructions. An unstructured prompt like *""Summarize this article for a social media post""* forces the AI to guess:

* How long should the summary be?
* What's the target platform? (Twitter? LinkedIn? Instagram?)
* Should it include hashtags?
* What tone should it use?
* When should it stop?

I’m here to show you a better way that will instantly level up your results, whether you're a marketer, a business owner, a student, or just an AI enthusiast. And the best part? **You don't need to be a coder to do it.**

It's called **JSON Prompting**.

# What is JSON and Why Should You Care?

JSON (JavaScript Object Notation) is just a clean, organized way to structure information using `key: ""value""` pairs. Think of it like filling out a detailed form instead of just shouting a request across the room.

**Why it's a game-changer for prompting:**

* **Crystal Clear Instructions:** You leave no room for misinterpretation. You tell the AI *exactly* what you need, from the core task to the tiniest detail.
* **Insane Consistency:** Once you have a template for a task (e.g., creating a blog post outline), you can reuse it to get consistently structured outputs every single time.
* **Complex Tasks Made Easy:** It allows you to ""layer"" your instructions. You can define the main goal, provide context, specify constraints, and describe the output format, all in one neat package.
* **You Are in Control:** Stop being a passive user and start being the director of your AI.

# The Magic Template: Your New Best Friend

Forget messy, multi-paragraph prompts. Here is a universal template you can adapt for almost any task. It’s designed to be intuitive, even if you’ve never seen a line of code.

**Copy-Paste This Template:**

    {
      ""objective"": ""Clearly state the primary goal of your request here. (e.g., 'Summarize text for a LinkedIn post', 'Generate project ideas', 'Translate a phrase')"",

# Pro-Tips for Flawless JSON Prompting

Based on the great visual guides I've seen, here are the simple rules to follow:

1. **Wrap Everything in** `{}`\*\*:\*\* Your entire prompt should be contained within one opening `{` and one closing `}`.
2. **Use Double-Quoted,** `snake_case` **Keys:** All your labels (the ""keys"") should be in `""double_quotes""` and use `snake_case` (all lowercase with underscores) for readability. e.g., `""output_format""`.
3. **Separate the Task from the Data:** Use a key like `""objective""` to state the goal and another like `""context""` or `""source_material""` to provide the content. This separation makes your request much clearer.
4. **Use** `[]` **for Lists:** When you need to provide multiple items, like in the `""required_elements""` section, enclose them in square brackets `[]`, with each item in quotes and separated by a comma.
5. **Nest** `options` **for Clarity:** Grouping related details under a heading like `""parameters""` keeps your main prompt clean and easy to read.
6. **Be Explicit About the Output:** The `""output_format""` section is your superpower. Describe *exactly* how you want the reply to look. The more detail, the better.

This isn't about learning to code. It's about learning to communicate with precision. Give it a try with the template above and I guarantee you'll be blown away by the difference.

[**Tuesday (DC Universe Infinite)** - *Jon Kent: This Internship is my Kryptonite* #9](https://i.imgur.com/t6F7dM2.jpeg)
> In Jon Kent: This Internship Is My Kryptonite by writer Sam Camp (Little Hollow Café) and artists Daimon Hampton and Seraji, Jon Kent is a super-powered hero in his own right, but how do those powers help him move beyond the mundane coffee orders, endless research, and “educational experience” the Daily Planet reporting staff deems necessary for those essential college credits? Especially when your mom is the editor-in-chief—hello, nepotism concerns!

>What’s more, his best friend thinks the internship is a waste of his time and talents, his boyfriend tries to be supportive but is wary of Jon’s new boss’s Superman obsession, and naturally his parents think this is a great opportunity, but life as a superhero daylighting as a reporter is a little different today than it was back then…

1n0000v,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1n0000v,Get an Unfair Advantage with AI: Start Directing with JSON Prompts (Guide and 10 JSON Prompt Templates to use),"  
**TL;DR:** Stop writing vague prompts. Use a structured JSON format to tell the AI *exactly* what you want, how you want it, and in what format. It gives you more control, consistency, and far better results. Copy the template in the post to get started.  
  
Ever feel like you're playing a guessing game with AI? You ask for something and get back a response that’s… okay, but not quite right. Maybe it’s too short, misses key details, or the formatting is all wrong.

The problem isn't the AI; it's the ambiguity of our instructions. An unstructured prompt like *""Summarize this article for a social media post""* forces the AI to guess:

* How long should the summary be?
* What's the target platform? (Twitter? LinkedIn? Instagram?)
* Should it include hashtags?
* What tone should it use?
* When should it stop?

I’m here to show you a better way that will instantly level up your results, whether you're a marketer, a business owner, a student, or just an AI enthusiast. And the best part? **You don't need to be a coder to do it.**

It's called **JSON Prompting**.

# What is JSON and Why Should You Care?

JSON (JavaScript Object Notation) is just a clean, organized way to structure information using `key: ""value""` pairs. Think of it like filling out a detailed form instead of just shouting a request across the room.

**Why it's a game-changer for prompting:**

* **Crystal Clear Instructions:** You leave no room for misinterpretation. You tell the AI *exactly* what you need, from the core task to the tiniest detail.
* **Insane Consistency:** Once you have a template for a task (e.g., creating a blog post outline), you can reuse it to get consistently structured outputs every single time.
* **Complex Tasks Made Easy:** It allows you to ""layer"" your instructions. You can define the main goal, provide context, specify constraints, and describe the output format, all in one neat package.
* **You Are in Control:** Stop being a passive user and start being the director of your AI.

# Pro-Tips for Flawless JSON Prompting

Based on the great visual guides I've seen, here are the simple rules to follow:

1. **Wrap Everything in** `{}`**:** Your entire prompt should be contained within one opening `{` and one closing `}`.
2. **Use Double-Quoted,** `snake_case` **Keys:** All your labels (the ""keys"") should be in `""double_quotes""` and use `snake_case` (all lowercase with underscores) for readability. e.g., `""output_format""`.
3. **Separate the Task from the Data:** Use a key like `""objective""` to state the goal and another like `""context""` or `""source_material""` to provide the content. This separation makes your request much clearer.
4. **Use** `[]` **for Lists:** When you need to provide multiple items, like in the `""required_elements""` section, enclose them in square brackets `[]`, with each item in quotes and separated by a comma.
5. **Nest** `options` **for Clarity:** Grouping related details under a heading like `""parameters""` keeps your main prompt clean and easy to read.
6. **Be Explicit About the Output:** The `""output_format""` section is your superpower. Describe *exactly* how you want the reply to look. The more detail, the better.

This isn't about learning to code. It's about learning to communicate with precision. Give it a try with the template above and I guarantee you'll be blown away by the difference.

A lot of people seem to already have their established circles from growing up here, which sometimes makes it feel a bit closed-off for newcomers.

I’m hoping to branch out and find groups or activities that are more social and community-oriented. I love anything outdoorsy, fitness-related, or artistic/creative. 

If you know of any clubs, community events, volunteer opportunities, or even just casual hangouts that are welcoming to new people, I’d really appreciate your recommendations. I’m open to trying new things and want to connect with others who are kind, down-to-earth, and interested in building new friendships.

If anything - please reach out if you feel similar, maybe we could grab a beer or a coffee!

At the time, I wasn’t looking for anything since I was working remotely. But I liked her. She is not a supermodel but she is honest and very cute. She invited me for a coffee, but we ended up going to the cinema. Afterward, she said she had a great time and suggested we go out more often.

From 2022 to 2025, we kept in light contact on Instagram, mostly exchanging memes and small talk. After relocating recently, I decided to reach out again. I invited her to the cinema, and she came, but I was too nervous to make a move. Later, I asked if she would accompany me to a wedding, but she declined, saying she was busy.

A week later, I apologized if I had rushed things and suggested meeting for coffee. She said there was no need to apologize and asked if I was in town. When I said yes, she replied that she wasn’t but would be back the following week. I tried to arrange a date, but she kept postponing—saying Monday wasn’t good and leaving Wednesday uncertain. Three weeks ago, she told me: “I will write you on Wednesday. I don’t guarantee anything.” Since then, there’s been no follow-up.

Should I let her go and focus in myself?

These usually cost higher but I have a huge stock of these piled up taking up a lot of storage space that I want to free asap that's why selling at lowest possible price.

The massage therapist comes and gets me on time. He is a man, which is fine. But naturally I feel a bit more self conscious with my body. He made me feel comfortable. And he gave a great massage. However when he was finished the massage. As I lay there naked under a sheet, He says he has some suggestions for me..

He suggest I exercise..
Walk 3-6 Miles per day..
Coffee black, no sugar or cream..
Breakfast..SKIP Lunch..LIGHT Dinner..
Walk home after work, don't drive..

I’ve developed anxiety (GAD), panic attacks, and some OCD, which are rooted from my workplace and other major changes in my life. I take 2 SSRI’s and most recently was prescribed Lorazepam. 

I have been taking Lorazepam for a while now. It works within 30 minutes. Often, I have trouble sleeping and feel wired with a racing heart and mind at 3 a.m. Half a Lorazepam (0.5 mg) is perfect for me to relax and fall asleep quickly. 

If I take the Lorazepam in the morning (I’m most anxious in the mornings) it works, but it makes me TIRED by mid-afternoon. Like, about to fall asleep in my car on my lunch break tired. I’m always very careful about how much I take and if I’ll be driving. Usually some coffee charges me back up, but still it’s not the best feeling to be so drowsy and longing for my bed during the day. 

I don’t particularly want to go down to an even lower dose (0.25 mg) because what I’m taking really works. Is this just an unavoidable side effect with most benzodiazepines?",2,1756149154.0,Anxiety,1,1.0,False

Naturally, it has been leaked here for your enjoyment.


---

08:45 AM – Delegates arrive for the International Stability Summit. Everyone whispers nervously about whether John will show up. Coffee levels: dangerously low.

09:02 AM – A door creaks open. John Chaos Unpredictable enters, wearing a crown made entirely of Flapcoins. Steve #001 follows, carrying a clipboard. Panic level rises to “existential dread.”

09:10 AM – John declares the summit “too boring” and orders a Mandatory Penguin Parade™. Within minutes, the conference hall fills with Steves in bow ties. Delegates forced to clap in rhythm.

09:25 AM – The French Ambassador attempts to restore order. John replaces his microphone with a kazoo. Debate continues, now in kazoo-language.

09:47 AM – Crisis averted: John solves a months-long diplomatic stalemate by gifting both parties a giant inflatable flamingo and announcing joint custody. Applause erupts.

10:30 AM – All PowerPoint slides across the summit spontaneously convert into haikus. Confusion is universal, but oddly poetic.

11:15 AM – Steve #001 reads out Penguinopolis’ new decree: “Every citizen must carry one emergency fish.” Delegates nod in terrified approval.

12:00 PM – John leaves the building by walking directly through a wall. Nobody dares to question it.


---

Final Notes (Filed by Senior Analyst):

International relations improved by 63%.

Coffee supply never recovered.

All attendees still humming penguin parade songs.

John left a single message on the podium:

> “Chaos is not disruption. Chaos is the rhythm the world forgot it had.”

I’ve changed most of my diet to a healthy one. I do intermittent fasting, stopped rice and instead eat ragi puttu. I’ve added protein to every meal and drink 2 liters of water every day. I’ve lost weight visibly and my skin looks better so I know I’m doing something right. I walk every day for half an hour and do some other workouts as well (no gym). I’ve gone from 71 kg to 64 kg doing this. I would like to be 60 kg by November. Its hella difficult to do this in a household that loves kappa, chakka and banana chips (I’ve stopped eating all of this). I do have tea or coffee once a day but with sugar free sweetener.

Any more tips on how to lose these last few kilos?

I am not going to get into detail much on the past as you can see my old posts on what I have/am going through. Most of you relate; I am sure of it. 

  
I am just here to say that 14 months on I am NOT fully recovered; but I found some hope. Some light. Something telling me to keep holding on. You should too. I wish I was back to who I was, but the truth is I am not yet. 

  
For the first full year I have had so many symptoms. Some that are worrisome and some that I'm like ""eh..probably just that dumb ass med. It'll pass"". The fact that I am able to say that to myself is a miracle. My CNS issues are still there. Anxiety, heart will race, depression, but not nearly like before. I can function with it and tell myself I will come down from it in 30 minutes and usually do. My ears were SO messed up from this. Clogging, popping, couldn't hear well and making me dizzy to the point I just needed to sit. That is not 100% better but has improved to the point I can pop them on command. Sometimes it a takes a few good jaw movements... lol. I am still very nervous to fly with these ears but at some point I know I have to get over it and the only way to test is to do it. The feeling was so unbearable though. I find my brain fog is still there and sometimes gets in the way of my cognitive ability (which is hard because I am a high functioning engineer pre-flox). I still get moments where I feel vulnerable and confused/lonely even though I am not. I sometimes will talk to myself in harsh terms but never to the point of deleting myself from planet earth anymore. My neck is still tight and I can still pop/crack my back/neck all day long. It is still a bit uncomfortable and sometimes I really wonder if it will get better. 

  
The point is...I believe it will in time. I have learned that one thing we have on our side is time. Time doesn't stop nor does it discriminate. I do take Mag. Glycinate once daily (sometimes twice) and does this help? Maybe. Maybe it's a placebo, but I am not willing to take that risk at the current moment. I also take collagen powder most days of the week (I forget sometimes) and take a probiotic about the same as the collagen. Have I found progress in healing? Absolutely. If you're reading this and you're in the less than 12 months category...I was you. Everything you feel; I felt. It does get better in time. It does fade a tiny bit in time. One day I woke up and I could pop my left ear open when I couldn't for months. I can breathe out of both nostrils again when every day I would have to blow my nose constantly. Yes, it is cold where I live but I never had a problem til directly after this med and I also worked for a month on/off on oil rigs in the Gulf of Mexico my whole career without issue changing climate. 

  
TO THE POINT! Healing does happen and it is different for all of us. Healing is not fast. Healing does not mean you have to change everything about you. I will drink alcohol and drink coffee now (1 cup max a day), just not nearly like I did before floxing as I feel it spike my anxiety/CNS issues. I just got the call that I will be going back to being a marine engineer in the next month. It has always been my passion and something I truly do enjoy in life. This med took that from me. Well, with the symptoms I still have and know in time will HOPEFULLY go away completely, I have decided to take back what this medication took from me. It will be hard and some days will be better than others, but healing is happening whether you believe it or not. I even gain a flox friend from all this and had a gateway during the darkest days and continue to stay in touch with. 14 months has felt like forever, but I have seen improvements and I do believe many, if not all, of us will see it too. 

If you're in a similar boat, I'd love to hear your story. If you are new to this, hang on and just know all of us are in this with you. Even when you feel alone. I'm not always on here, but still linger and check my inbox in the event you need someone to talk to. 

Hope for full recovery and healing!

I had an affair with my personal trainer while my husband was dying of cancer, and I made him walk me down the aisle at our vow renewal ceremony.

My husband was diagnosed with stage 4 pancreatic cancer eight months ago. The doctors said he had maybe six months left. I know how that sounds but hear me out.

I joined a gym to cope with the stress. My trainer was this amazing guy who actually listened to me. He held me when I cried about watching my husband waste away. We started meeting for coffee after sessions. Then dinner. Then other things.

My husband got worse. He was in the hospital more than home. The chemo made him so sick he could barely talk. I felt like I was already a widow.

Three weeks ago my husband had this moment of clarity. He grabbed my hand and said, ""I want to renew our vows before I die. I want to marry you again.""

I panicked. I couldn't tell him no. He was dying. So I said yes and started planning this small ceremony at the hospital chapel.

But then my trainer said something that changed everything. He said, ""You deserve to be happy. Your husband would want that for you.""

The night before the vow renewal, my trainer came over. We talked all night about my future. About us. About how my husband was already gone in every way that mattered.

The next morning I made a choice. I asked my trainer to walk me down the aisle. I told him my dad was dead and my husband couldn't do it, so I needed someone who truly cared about me to give me away.

The ceremony was beautiful. My husband was in a wheelchair but he was smiling. His whole family was there. They kept looking at my trainer funny but I introduced him as my fitness coach who'd become like family.

After we said our vows, there was a small reception in the hospital cafeteria. That's when my mother-in-law cornered me.

""Who is that man really?"" she asked.

I was feeling brave from the champagne. I told her the truth. I said, ""He's someone who makes me happy. And deep down, your son would want me to be happy.""

She started screaming. Called me every name in the book. Said I was a monster. My father-in-law tried to physically drag me out of the reception.

I called the cops. When they arrived I told them my in-laws were harassing me on what should be the happiest day of my life. The officers made them leave.

My husband was too weak to understand what happened. He died two days later holding my hand.

Now his family is saying I killed him with the stress. They're threatening to contest his will. My trainer says we should just move in together and forget about them.

But part of me wonders if I crossed a line by bringing him to the ceremony.",1,1756148505.0,FoundandExpose,0,1.0,False

I (18 f) met this guy (also 18) once and very briefly almost a year ago at some work experience day. We clicked pretty well and started talking over text for a bit. I could tell that he liked me and I initially liked him back too until he gradually started leaving me on delivered for quite a while and during the middle of convos which caused me to loose interest in him. We never had great convos- just like extended small talk i guess. For a couple months we didn’t talk a lot but he eventually started to become interested in me again and wanted to talk a lot more. I politely told him that I wasn’t interested anymore but would still be friends with him- he expressed that he was upset but accepted it and we agreed to be friends.

After I politely rejected him he started to want to talk to me more and more frequently and then he started to ask to meet up with me. The first time he asked (he just suggested meeting up for coffee) I loosely agreed but soon realised that I didn’t really want to as I actually really didn’t know him (it’s not that I felt creeped out, I just don’t really meet up with people I’m not good friends with) so I pushed it back. 

To shorten things up a bit, he gradually started to try and talk to me more and more and badger me about meeting up with him which started to annoy me as he just wasn’t taking the hint that I didn’t really want to meet up (I told him I was busy every time and I also told him that I would let him know when I was free and yet he would ask again just under a week later). This has now been going on for almost a year and this guy just won’t leave me alone. I’m not by any means insinuating that he’s a creep or a stalker because he’s not at all but I just have become slightly uncomfortable with the fact that he’s just won’t leave me alone and is constantly asking to meet up with me when we actually really don’t know each other that well.

After I politely rejected him and told him that we could still be friends I did mean it. I would have been fine with maybe catching up with him once in a while but I didn’t expect him to get worse and just hassle me a lot. It’s gotten to the point where I leave him on delivered for weeks and he still double/triple texts me asking if I’m free and trying to starts convos with me.

He’s also always been so so nice and polite with me so it makes it difficult as I don’t want to reply to his messages because I know it will encourage him to just keep on but I sometimes feel bad for ignoring him because of the polite nature of his texts. 

My friend also thinks that his behaviour is pretty unusual and would make anyone quite uncomfortable but I’m worried that I’m being over dramatic and that maybe I don’t have a justified reason to not want to talk to him. Am I making things too deep or would anyone feel a bit uncomfortable with his persistence?

1mzzddy,https://www.reddit.com/r/HealthyZapper/comments/1mzzddy/a_keto_diet_grocery_list_for_beginners_31/,A Keto Diet Grocery List For Beginners - 31 Must-Have Items,"&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/s5gkhpfofs061.jpg?width=2064&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=c175eb97f2ac90ce1058d2578c321ac507fab89f

Starting the keto diet can be a little overwhelming-the high-fat, low-carb diet, known for its dramatic weight loss results, requires an overhaul of most people's typical shopping lists. That means saying goodbye to some of the easy items you might keep on hand for lazy nights (we're talking to you, quick-cooking rice and frozen french fries), and hello to some slightly more perishable foods that are higher in fat and protein like meat and full-fat dairy. 

But before you go filling your grocery cart with bacon and cheese galore, know that you'll want to opt for good-for-you sources of unsaturated fat and protein-like fish and avocado, instead, says Lyssie Lakatos, RDN, of the Nutrition Twins. ""Since this diet is primarily coming from fat, choosing healthy sources of fat is important,"" she says. So, healthy fat = good; protein = good; but what about everything else? Don't freak-while, yes, tons of stuff is off-limits on the keto diet, there are plenty of yummy things you can eat. To help, a few dietitians weighed in on what they'd put on their keto diet grocery shopping list-so all you really have to do is save it and go to the store.  But first. . . some items to take off your list

There are a few aisles you can skip (the cookie aisle is probably one of them) if you're committing to keto. Here are the non-keto-friendly items you will no longer need to stock your fridge and pantry with. 

Pasta and other grains When you're cutting carbs on keto, pasta, rice, and noodles have to be the first to go (unfortunately). Your local grocery store might have a special health foods section where you can find low-carb or gluten-free pastas and noodles, though. 

Starchy veggiesPotatoes are off limits, and so are other starchy, high-carb vegetables like carrots, believe it or not. Colorful, leafy greens are going to be key staples to add to your basket or cart. 

High-sugar fruitsWhile fruit is something that is usually recommended for a healthy, balanced diet, the keto diet restricts some fruit, says Marisa Moore, MBA, RDN, LD.  Some fruits, like apples, bananas, and pears, are higher in carbs, which break down into sugars, so they're not typically part of a keto eating plan. 

LegumesIf you eat vegan or vegetarian, certain legumes, like beans, lentils, and chickpeas, might be a regular part of your diet for extra protein. On keto, though, they're too high in carbs and too low in fat to be compliant. 

Sugary foodsYou're going to want to bypass any aisle that includes candy, doughnuts, snack cakes, and cookies, as the sugars in any processed sweets should be avoided on the keto diet. Your keto-friendly grocery list

Ok, now that we've gotten the bad news out of the way, here are all the yummy items you can stock up on when you're following a keto diet. There's plenty to be excited about putting in your cart!

Low-carb veggies

Not all vegetables are created equal for keto followers. High-carb veggies are a no-go. Instead, opt for low-carb options like cauliflower, broccoli, spinach, bell pepper, celery, cucumber, eggplant, and asparagus, says Pegah Jalali, RD, a nutritionist with Middleberg Nutrition. 

Frozen veggies are cool, too. Sydney Greene, RD, also of Middleberg Nutrition, recommends frozen cauliflower in particular. ""It's very low carb yet high in fiber and vitamin C. Use cauliflower in place of bananas for a creamy smoothie without the extra carbohydrates,"" Greene says. 

Avocados

Tammy Lakatos Shames, RDN, of Nutrition Twins, describes avocados as one of the very best keto foods, jam-packed with both nutrients and healthy fats. ""I like to have them with some hemp or flax seeds sprinkled on top and some parmesan cheese,"" says Jalali.  

Berries 

Raspberries are a perfect sweet treat for people on the keto diet, since they're the fruit with the fewest carbs, says Jalali-though blueberries and blackberries are great, too. Blackberries and raspberries specifically are a solid option because they contain 8 grams of fiber per cup, too, Moore adds. Salad greens

Pre-washed greens, like spinach, kale and arugula, are a huge timesaver. ""Having greens on hand makes it super easy to throw together a quick salad or add some quick nutrients-folate, vitamin C, fiber, magnesium-to your proteins,"" says Greene. 

For a quick, keto-friendly breakfast, Greene suggests scrambling two whole eggs and a handful of spinach to get a good serving of healthy fat, protein, and fiber. 

Grass-fed beef and organic chicken

Keep grass-fed beef and lamb, along with organic chicken, on hand, recommends Jalali. ""Our clients particularly love Applegate's Great Organic Uncured Beef Hot Dog,"" says Shames-they're non-GMO and made with grass-fed beef, sans nitrates and preservatives. 

Bone broth

Another option? Sip your meat-based protein. Greene loves Bonafide Provisions Bone Broth, which uses bones from grass-fed cows. ""The amino acids found in the broth support a healthy gut,"" says Greene. Tuna, salmon, or sardines (fresh or canned)

If you opt for fresh fish, grill, bake, or pan-fry it in a healthy oil (olive or avocado) and serve with a low-carb veggie like broccoli or cauliflower rice. 

If you choose canned, mix it with mayo and serve over greens, suggests Jalali. For a simple keto lunch, Greene suggests combining a can of tuna with half an avocado in a collard green wrap. 

Cheese

Go for grass-fed, organic, and full-fat options in the dairy aisle, recommends Jalali. For cheese, one easy-to-find option-readily available at groceries and convenience stores alike-is Organic Valley's full fat cheese. ""It fits in the keto diet perfectly,"" says Lakatos. Always read the nutrition info before purchasing pre-shredded cheeses, cautions Jalali, who says they sometimes contain a stabilizer that adds carbs-so just make sure your shredded cheese has zero grams of carbs. 

Greek yogurt and sour cream

These can be used interchangeably on the keto diet, as they all have similar amounts of carbs-Greek yogurt has five grams per serving and sour cream has seven. Just make sure they're plain options-added flavors also add carbs. 

Quark

Quark is a German food that's somewhere in between yogurt and cheese in flavor and consistency-you can add it to smoothies, or use it as a spread or topping. ""It's rich, creamy, and a favorite among our clients who are keto followers,"" says Lakatos. 

Eggs

If you're on a keto diet, opt for Eggland's Best Eggs, says Lakatos. ""They have double the omega-3s and six times the vitamin D of other eggs, thanks to their all-vegetarian hen feed which provides high-quality, keto-friendly nutrients. ""

Moore suggests meal prepping hard boiled eggs and keeping them in the fridge throughout the week for easy on-the-go breakfasts. If properly refrigerated and not cracked, they'll last for 7 days in the fridge. 

Nut milks

Milk can actually have a good amount of carbs, so nut milk is a good alternative on the keto diet, says Lakatos. Unsweetened coconut, hemp, and almond milks in particular are good options, as they contain no carbs and more than four grams of fat-a perfect combo for keto dieters. Almond milk specifically is versatile for a variety of recipes, like a chia seed pudding or a breakfast smoothie, says Moore. ""Simply blend frozen berries with leafy greens and plenty of almond milk for a frosty drink in less than five minutes,"" Moore suggests. 

Avocado, olive, hazelnut, and coconut oil

The keto diet is all about fat, so clearly all healthy oils are welcome on this keto grocery list. Cooking food in the oils is one thing-but you can also amp up your fat intake by drizzling some oil on your cooked meal, as well. 

Grass-fed ghee

Ghee, like the oils above, is a pure fat, which means its free from carbs or protein, says Jalali. ""Ketogenic diets are more than 60 percent fat so having pure fats for all meals helps keep you on track,"" she says. If you can't find ghee, you can also use butter. 

Seaweed

This low-carb snack has just one gram of carbs, and is full of iodine, which supports a healthy thyroid, says Greene. Some even come in individual grab-and-go packets so you can store them in your desk at work or in your purse. 

Olives

You can add olives to salad or have them as an on-the-go snack. ""We find these to be a lifesaver for our keto clients,"" says Shames. Olives offer a healthy monounsaturated source of fat; some even come in different flavors (like taco or sriracha). Pistachios 

Shames recommends single-serving packages of pistachios, too. ""Ninety percent of the fats found in pistachios are the better-for-you mono- and polyunsaturated type,"" says Shames. ""Plus, pistachios provide a good source of plant protein and fiber for a trio that can help to keep you fuller longer. ""

Almonds

Another nut that's high in fiber, healthy fat, and protein is almonds. Moore always recommends them as snacks for clients who are constantly busy and need snacks to keep them satiated throughout the day. You can easily pack single-serve packages ahead of time. 

Nutritional yeast

Nutritional yeast provides B12, a nutrient that many of us-especially vegans and vegetarians-just don't get enough of. It's also a source of protein without many carbs at all, says Lakatos. 

""Keto followers can sprinkle it on their meals for a cheesy flavor and they often use it to make keto-friendly breads and tortillas,"" says Lakatos. 

Chia seeds and flax seeds

You can use these seeds to coat meats, include them in bake goods, or make keto-friendly oatmeal and pudding, says Jalali. These pantry items are high in fiber, but low in carbs. 

Healthy frozen foods

Added items like frozen cauliflower pizza and frozen frittatas can make eating keo simple on mornings and nights when you're strapped for time. Nora Minno, an RD in New York City, loves this pizza, which contains only 16 grams of carbs for the whole pie.  Tofu

""Tofu is a great way to add plant-based protein into a diet that is typically heavy in animal protein and fat,"" says Minno. ""A 3-oz serving contains 80 calories, 4 grams of fat, 9 grams of protein and only 3 grams of carbs. You'll also be getting important micronutrients like calcium, iron, and potassium. ""

Low-carb pasta alternatives

""Shiratake noodles are a great low-carb pasta alternative with only 2 grams of carbs and 0 calories per bag,"" says Minno. 

Nut butter

A high-quality nut butter is a great keto snack, topping for flax crackers, and ingredient for keto fat bombs and desserts, says Lara Clevenger, RD and founder of The Keto Queens. 

Grass-fed beef tallow

Beef tallow is rich in omega 3 and CLA and is a ""high quality saturated fat which has a high smoke point and is great for cooking,"" says Clevenger. 

Chocolate

Yes, you can totally add chocolate to your shopping cart on the keto diet! Clevenger recommends Choc Zero. ""It's sugar-free chocolate, non-gmo, and contains no sugar alcohols or soy lecithin. It's not super bitter like some chocolate bars and tastes great and has a very good texture,"" she says. 

Keto-approved condiments

One of the trickiest things to shop for while keto? Dressings and condiments. Clevenger recommends low-sugar ketchup and BBQ sauce from Alterna Sweets. ""These sauces taste amazing and they all contain only 1 gram net carb per tablespoon,"" she says. As for salad dressing? Clevenger reaches for Primal Kitchen brand. ""These are sugar-free and keto-certified. ""Alternative flours

""Almond flour is one of my favorite baking ingredients,"" Moore says. It's also one of the most common keto-friendly, gluten-free, alternative flours.  ""The almonds provide satiating fiber and protein plus healthy fats,"" Moore adds.  She recommends it for making pie crusts and baking cookies and muffins. 

Coconut flour is another low-carb flour alternative that Moore suggests adding to your pantry. However, keep in mind that you can't just substitute the same amount in a recipe that calls for regular four. ""Because it is highly absorbent, you'll likely need to add more liquid to baked goods that use coconut flour,"" Moore says. 

Keto-friendly sweeteners

For a natural sugar substitute that's keto-compliant, consider stocking up on monk fruit, says Moore. Whether you're baking or looking to sweeten up your coffee, monk fruit is an option that won't take you out of ketosis. Erythritol is another common keto-friendly sugar substitute. Again, you'll want to use in keto-specific recipes since you can't swap in the same amount for a recipe that calls for sugar. 

Keto protein bars

To keep you full during the day, try a keto protein or energy bar that's high in healthy fats (like nuts and oils like avocado oil) and protein, but low in carbs. Keto Bar is a great option-they make a delicious chocolate peanut butter flavor. 

Keto granolas

You won't be able to buy regular cereals, as they'll be too high in carbs, but low-carb or grain-free, low sugar granolas like Lakanto Healthy Quick Breakfast Granola or Lark Ellen Farm Granola are a better choice. You can add milk to them or eat them with yogurt and breakfast is solved.",1,1756148432.0,HealthyZapper,0,1.0,False

I've eaten street food all over and I've never been picky. I've only had food poisoning twice, one was from the airport and one was from something the owner of a hostel cooked me. 
But ive recently had a very bad case off food poisoning. It went on for almost  5 days, and I had to get medical help due to intense dehydration. It was pretty scary because I've been totally alone on a city with no tourists. Having to walk my self to the shops to buy water and supplies when I could barley even stand. At some points I thought I would be stuck in this state forever.

Anyway, I feel like I never want to eat out ever again. I suddenly feel like everything that ain't made by me is going to make me sick... Even coffee I keep thinking they'll use bad water. When I see food all I can see I can think of is the meat in the markets that's hanging in the sun all day. And in Peru vegetarian options don't really exist. But I don't even know if I could eat them either... How does one get over these feeling hahah.... ",6,1756148363.0,backpacking,4,0.88,False

Experimenting with brewing methods has always been my thing, so giving the POLIVIAR JX2020-FPN-US French Press Coffee Maker a try was an exciting prospect. This particular model caught my eye because of its unique blend of aesthetics, promised durability, and notable reviews. After using it for weeks, I have some strong opinions—both good and not-so-good—to share. Let’s dive into the specifics.

**Design and Aesthetic Appeal**  
The visual appeal of this French press is top-notch. Its sleek stainless steel body, paired with a green-colored modern rustic design, instantly fit into my kitchen decor. The wood handle, though minimalistic, added a nice touch of elegance while providing a firm grip. It's worth mentioning that the double-wall insulation doesn’t just look great—it also helps maintain the coffee’s temperature impressively well. When I left my brew for over an hour, it kept the heat much longer than my glass press could.  

[Ready to buy POLIVIAR JX2020-FPN-US? Click for Amazon pricing.](https://tastefulcoffee.com/p/b08fbtgjrf/)  

**The Brewing Process and Flavor Retention**  
This French press excels at delivering smooth and aromatic coffee. The dual-filter system does a stellar job of keeping sediment at bay while ensuring that the richness of the coffee oils isn’t compromised. On most mornings, I found myself enjoying a cup devoid of the grainy residue that ruined my experience in other presses. Even my curious neighbor, who popped over for coffee one day, commented on how well the brew retained its bold flavor profile.  

**Comfort in Daily Handling**  
The ergonomic wooden handle deserves a shoutout. It’s crafted beautifully and doesn’t heat up, unlike the metal ones I’ve battled with in the past. Clean-up was a breeze—providing you don’t mind manually washing the steel body. A small issue I noticed, though, was some residual coffee oil lingering near the filter, which required a deep wash once in a while.  

**Positives**  
- Insulated design keeps coffee hot far longer than glass models.  
- Dual-filter screens maintain a pure, smooth coffee experience.  
- Stainless steel build ensures durability and avoids rust.  
- Wood handle adds both style and practical comfort.  

**Adverse Aspects**  
- The lid alignment requires careful placement, or it doesn’t seal correctly.  
- Minor difficulty cleaning the filter if used frequently.  
- Slightly bulkier compared to glass alternatives, which might affect storage.  

**Durability and Longevity**  
This isn’t your average coffee press that wears out within a year. The food-grade stainless steel feels sturdy, and after several weeks of consistent use, it still looks as good as new without any scratches or discolorations. However, when compared to fully plastic-intensive models, this French press certainly has an edge, lasting longer while maintaining safety.  

**Competing Products**  
Other French presses like the Bodum Chambord or even the Kona model hold their ground firmly. While both of these rival products are visually appealing and reasonably effective, I favored the POLIVIAR's heat retention due to its insulating build. However, Bodum excels in lid precision and ease of cleaning, while Kona manages to be slightly lighter and more travel-friendly. If you prioritize an artisanal vibe and sturdiness, the POLIVIAR might edge out competitors in that realm.  

**Value Proposition**  
Is it worth the investment? I would argue yes. Though it sits in the mid-tier pricing range for French presses, its combination of durability, heat insulation, and clean aesthetics makes it stand out. It feels like a one-time purchase that pays off every time you savor that perfectly brewed coffee at home.

1mzz8dp,https://www.reddit.com/r/PluggedInPicks/comments/1mzz8dp/explore_best_coffee_machines_with_ninja_cm300_for/,Explore Best Coffee Machines with Ninja CM300 for Perfect Brews,"Ninja CM300 Coffee Maker Review – Daily Brewing Made Simple  

Using the Ninja CM300 for a while now, I’ve got to say this coffee maker is an impressive gadget for coffee enthusiasts, whether you're a regular joe or a connoisseur. The first thing that caught my eye as I took it out of the box was its sleek black design paired with stainless steel accents. It looks modern and fits seamlessly into any kitchen decor—whether minimalistic or more traditional. I placed it by my countertop coffee bar, and it feels like it belongs there. But beyond aesthetics, this machine had to prove itself in functionality. Did it? Almost, but it had its quirks.

**Performance in Brewing**

One of the things I appreciated right away was its versatility. This isn’t just your average drip coffee maker. The Ninja CM300 offers three distinct brew styles—Classic, Rich, and Over Ice. I’ve tested all three styles extensively. The Classic mode delivers smooth coffee that’s perfect for a wake-me-up morning, while Rich provides a more robust flavor that I opted for during my overly long work calls. Over Ice has to be my favorite. The promise of iced coffee that doesn’t taste watered down wasn’t just a gimmick; it really delivered.  

The consistency of each cup was quite impressive, thanks to its fully automatic operation mode. Whether I was brewing a single cup for myself or making a half carafe when friends came over, it handled the job like a pro. And the adjustable warming plate ensures the coffee stays hot for hours, which is helpful when you’re juggling a chaotic morning.  

**Ease of Use and Functionality**

The removable water reservoir might sound like a small feature, but boy, does it make life easier. I hate fiddling with fixed water tanks and having to refill them with a jug. With this machine, I can simply pull the reservoir out and fill it directly in the sink. It’s a mess-free process that saves time. This design choice shows that Ninja put a lot of thought into everyday functionality.  

Another point worth noting is that this coffee maker doesn’t rely on pods. That’s a huge win for me. Ground coffee gives you the freedom to customize and experiment with flavors, plus it’s a more eco-friendly choice. The reusable filter also eliminates the need for disposable paper filters.  

Check [Ninja CM300] price on Amazon.

**Good Aspects**

- Flexible brewing options: Classic, Rich, and Over Ice modes.  
- Removable water reservoir for effortless refilling.  
- Adjustable warming plate keeps coffee hot for up to 4 hours.  
- Brew sizes that range from one cup to a full 10-cup carafe.  
- Eco-friendly reusable filter, cutting down on waste.  

**Areas for Improvement**

- The size of the coffee maker could be an issue for compact kitchens, as it has a somewhat taller design.  
- I found the machine to be slightly noisier than some competitors when brewing, especially in Classic mode.   
- While the carafe is functional, the design makes it tricky to pour the last bit of coffee without spilling.  

**Product Competitors**

Comparing the Ninja CM300 to other coffee makers, like the Keurig K-Café and the Hamilton Beach FlexBrew, gave me some perspective on its strengths and weaknesses. Against the Keurig K-Café, the Ninja wins in flexibility. Keurig machines often lock users into K-Cups, while the Ninja gives freedom to use any ground coffee. However, the Keurig does have an edge in milk frothing for lattes and cappuccinos, an area the Ninja doesn’t cater to.  

The Hamilton Beach FlexBrew, another competitor, has a similar no-pod brewing system, and it includes a dual coffee maker setup for single-serve and larger brewing. But the Ninja machine was noticeably faster at brewing, and the iced coffee function on the Ninja outshines the FlexBrew in terms of flavor retention.  

**Cost-Effectiveness**

While slightly pricier than some basic drip coffee makers, you’re truly paying for added convenience and versatility with the Ninja CM300. The ability to brew various sizes (single cup to full carafe) and styles (Hot, Rich, Iced) makes it an excellent investment for households with diverse coffee-drinking preferences. And don’t forget about the long-term savings from ditching coffee pods. If you’re someone who brews daily and hates unnecessary waste, this coffee maker earns its place on your counter.

With that being said Ive been seeing different polls and questions about Nas classics figured I’d review some albums and drop my two cents in. 

Magic 3 in 3 parts.


1. Fever - 🎤🎤🎤🎤🎤  + 🎤🎤. 7/5
- This intro is AMAZING, it shakes you, the ending with that wolf of Wall Street humming is something I’ve never seen any artist do. 6/5 song. I wish I could post on the dope lyrics, I also love when says STEVIE Wonder HAPPYBIRTHDAY AND I’m a grioooot Deep as 
Deepok Choopra. That flow is insane 

“Early on the wake up
Cunning as the father of the twelve sons of Jacob
Shake up the world, cake crumbs
Cover my gold teeth, cufflinks, waiters
Lobster sauce on aprons
Pardon, that's the chef
Burgundy on the breath
Uncertainty when I step
Dancin' to every song like it's a contest
Singin' to Stevie Wonder ""Happy Birthday""
years of flows and crazy wordplay
Seasoned, I'm leavin' my forties, I'm a griot
Deep as Deepak Chopra
Dress socks and loafers
Family only, I'm holdin' hands with a cold piece”

2. TSK 🎤🎤🎤🎤. 4/5
Ever change your mind on a song because you humbly had to realized you weren’t paying attention. That’s me with TSK. I think I commented that it shouldn’t be between fever and supero status. IM 10000% wrong. THE BEAT, and the statements Nas makes. Yo this song is crazy dope. This was one of my least favourites on MAGIC 3 when it dropped, that’s changed completely.

“All I see is blurbs, all I see is words
Nerds talkin' 'bout what they did, see or heard
And all I see is clones, see you motherfuckers
With mixtape plans, because they seein' how we movin'”

“And all they say is this, but they ain't sayin' shit
They talk reckless when I do not work for them
They say, ""Come harder, come smarter, "" which one it is?
Which one you wanna hear? Since you such a music wiz”

“Don't be scared to execute the vision, lock in
Get back to the art, not the trends, tsk
I mainly invented raps by bangin' on table tops”

“Step on lawns, trip on Dior slides, grip on the handrails
Crib on some acres
Pull off the tails off shrimps, some beyond blond
Sip on some fine wine, we just some shakers
So when Planet Rock came out the Bronx, I was watchin' boomboxes
T La Rock never made it rich?”

3. Superhero status - 🎤🎤🎤🎤🎤+ 🎤🎤 7/5 
This song is INSAAAAAANE. Like who but these flows inside of Nas? Like this track you have to listen to it MULTIPLE times for MULTIPLE reasons. You’re gonna miss the flows and bars, the way he switches through the pockets is blowing my mind man. I’m not even saying for Nas being 50 this sounds good. This straight up HEEEEEEEEEEAT. Man even says “Man, catch me, don't let me slip in no demented stage” then unleashes one of the best favorite nas of all time. “Cognizant correspondence, I don't respond to nonsense
Adidas shells, I keep a reefer smell on me
Ringin' the Wall Street bell at 9:30 A.M. is my coffee “  who upset this man Nas. I’m very happy he unleashed this. 

Repetitive Beat Street watcher, a gatekeeper, conqueror
Late night creep sponsor, need a freak who fly and beyond thick
I'm a sheikh, she don't need to fly to Dubai for it 
Fleet of cars, she under my arm and she honored with it
Cognizant correspondence, I don't respond to nonsense
Adidas shells, I keep a reefer smell on me
Ringin' the Wall Street bell at 9:30 A.M. is my coffee 
My gang is New York Stock Exchange
Here's my costume change
Superhero status, no masks, no gadgets
Send them villains at us, we ain't scared of action
We ain't characters cappin'
Ability to leap buildings, if you blink, you won't catch it


4. I Love this Feeling 🎤🎤🎤🎤🎤 +🎤 
Hot like on a detective list ok I see the shift from superhero status. THIS TRACK IS CRAZY MAN. The beat switches on here . I know this on Nas but HITBOY IS LOCKED IN. Nas cleverly references when Ruth was listening to Illmatic in Ozarks and even boats that it’s even better than if he co starred. YO LET THAT SINK IN who talks about being fly live that Nas is so savvvvvy man. 

Fuck who the hottest, who really stand up?
Who really messin' with they dead man girl?
That says everything about that man world
Energy transferal, immortality
You against morality, don't come around mе
Homicidal vinyl section where thеy always found me
By the motion picture soundtrack with Richard Roundtree on the album sleeve
That's my era shit
Musical excellence, hot like on a detective list

Hey So I(m34) asked a woman(F24), could be a year off on age, anyway,  out the other day. We have known each other for a few years and have gone out/hung out a time or 2 before but none of those were dates, they had to do with not work, but call them extracurriculars that are very work like(think service/political organizations). I have wanted to ask her out on and off for awhile mostly because we go through periods where we dont see each other often. 

I admit I was not my most eloquent as I always knot up around her but I came right out and asked if she would like to go on a date. I think i caught her completely off guard and she looked at me kind of blankly and said we can go for coffee. Which works for me its casual and good for early stages/1sr dates. She said ahe needed a couple weeks beforehand and I know what the organizational calendar is like for the next couple weeks so I had no problem. I text her couple days later on a clarification of the timeline whether that was labor day or the weekend after for a convention, that she is and I may(its expensive and a decent distance away) be going to the weekend after. Thos all happened Thursday night ar a function at the end of the night. I sent the text yesterday and she has not responded. 

Should I write this off and if I ever get a response be happy or just move on?

TL:DR I asked a woman out and she said yes but needed sometime before we went, I later asked for clarification on what later exactly meant and she has not responded. Should I move on?

1mzz3t7,https://www.reddit.com/r/AlternativeHealth/comments/1mzz3t7/my_wife_has_been_struggling_with_histamine/,"My wife has been struggling with histamine intolerance for a year, looking for suggestions","Hey all! My wife recently stated having some major issues, and we’ve done everything we can think of, and would love to feedback from y’all to help. Below is her story, what we’ve done, and would love any advice you have. I just want to help her feel better (and yes, I confirmed all this with her and she’s [more than] okay with me posting this)

Info on her: 24 years old, 102lbs at start of diet, 109lbs now, no major health issues, 5 foot 4 inches, light exercises several times a week, 

TLDR; started getting symptoms in Oct 2024, unsure what it was, found out she had H pylori/Candida (assumed symptoms were from that), started getting rid of that in Nov 2024 with MEVY diet. Got rid of candida/H. pylori at the end of Jan 2025, with small improvements. Mar 2025 Did a HEAVY Liver/Kidney detox, didn’t help. May 2025 cut out coconut, nuts, almond milk, and this helped, but not back to normal. Today: has tried living with it, eat low histamine foods, is on a ton of recommended vitamins to help, but it isn’t really doing anything. Please help. 

Full journey:

My wife started experiencing symptoms such as itchy neck, which left bumps after scratching (so she tried to avoid itching at all costs, because when she does, it spreads and becomes really intense), bloated, dizzy, anxiety, nausea, heart pumping hard with easy tasks, bodyaches, shortness of breathe, ears ringing, irritable, constantly exhausted, yeast infections, anxiety rash on chest, seeing starts, smelly sweat, hot flashes, chest flush when hot, headaches, the works. Through lots of testing, we concluded she had H. pylori and Candida (did stool tests to confirm these)

So, we started the process to get rid of those in November (I did it with her because I’m just a great husband like that lol). We started the MEVY first. To explain candida diet: basically the MEVY diet, (Meat, eggs, vegetables, yogurt) no sugar, no carbs, no processed meats. She was also dairy free (had diary free yogurt)….. from there we slowly added things back. She was taking canxida remove and restore, as suggested by her doctor. On January 31st, 2025 we got the test results back confirming we had officially gotten rid of her H. pylori and Candida!! Yay!!

After the diet, things felt better. Energy was back, rarely nauseous, significantly less anxious… but other symptoms persisted… Itchiness, dizziness, bloating, the redness/bumps after itching (so she tried to avoid itching at all costs, because when she does, it spreads and becomes really intense), and started flushing, badly.

The flushing was when she was anxious, or hot, or pretty much any emotion beyond neutral. She had to start taking luke warm/cold showers just because her entire body would be red/puff when touched. She started taking daily antihistamines (DAO), but it really didn’t help. She did find that Zyrtec helped a lot, but you can’t stay on that forever. We did run some experiments with her, we had her take as hot of a shower as she could reasonably do, while drinking as much ice cold water as she could manage. Doing so, keeping her core temperature as cold as possible, drastically helped, with minimal flushing. Not sure if that’s helpful information but I found it interesting.

March 17th she started a HEAVY Liver/Kidney detox, (look up push catch Liver/Kidney detox. She did the heavy option).   Didn’t help with anything really, maybe could go slightly longer without getting flush, but we’re talking 3 minutes in the shower vs 60 seconds.

April 20th, started getting supposed fibroids cysts in ankles, and breasts (???) slightly painful to the touch, hard, doctors call them benign.

May 17th 2025, We assumed there was something in her diet, so we looked at what we started eating more of during/after the MEVY diet, and concluded she had started eating a whole lot more coconut, a whole lot more nuts, and a whole lot more alternate milks (almond milk) (she was dairy free during all of this, but had been for a little over a year). So we cut out nuts, coconut, and went back to cows milk, specifically A2 whole milk and cheeses (because she has to eat something. She was dairy free because of casein levels, and we learned this was a good substitute, and she reacted well to it, yay!). Doing so helped a lot. She didn’t really have any flushing for several weeks, and when she would try something like coconut, she would react (flush) again

From cutting coconut/nuts/etc we saw noticeable improvement. Everything improved slightly, dizziness was gone, itching wasn’t nearly as intense, but the flushing state about the same, if not got worse. Either way, it was nice to see other symptoms going away, it felt like we were finally making some progress

Up to today (August 25th 2025), she’s tried just living with it, she eats low histamine foods, we eat almost exclusively whole foods or minimally processed foods, avoid bad oils, food dyes, does eat more dairy (primarily because she needs the calories/protein), has reintroduced coffee (hadn’t drank coffee since beginning of 2024), and recently has recently gone on a crap ton of vitamins, all from referrals in this group. (*inhales* folate, vitamin D3, B7, B12, B9, B1, B2, B6, B3, B5, magnesium, copper, zinc) she does have the MTHFR gene, and we are doing the methylated versions of things. 

She’s been all on all of those vitamins for about 10 days now, and hasn’t really noticed improvements. When I asked her, she said it was about 5% better. All of the amounts are the recommended daily amounts excluding the B1 which she is on 50mg (we read that increasing this has helped people) we both know 10 days isn’t necessarily as long as we should probably wait, but we won’t be stopping those just yet

Anyway, that’s pretty much where we’re at, and we are out of ideas. Would love any advice anybody has people who have gone through this, what worked for you… really just whatever I can do for my wife that we aren’t already doing. Thank you ",1,1756147820.0,AlternativeHealth,0,1.0,False
1mzz2vf,https://www.reddit.com/r/HealthyLive/comments/1mzz2vf/does_angel_soft_ultra_toilet_paper_deliver_on/,Does Angel Soft Ultra Toilet Paper Deliver on Comfort and Strength Review?,"Testing out the Angel Soft 79342 Ultra Toilet Paper is like embarking on a journey to redefine comfort with every use. Admittedly, I’m quite picky when it comes to household essentials, and this product intrigued me with its promise of softness, strength, and eco-consciousness. Having tested it daily for weeks, both the good and not-so-good elements of this product deserve their moment in the spotlight. From its generously sized rolls to its advertised septic safety, it was an interesting experience.

**Design and Roll Size**  
A single pack offers six mega rolls, each puffed up with 320 sheets of 2-ply magic. I am not exaggerating when I say these rolls are seriously ""mega."" They outlast standard rolls significantly, which spells fewer mid-week emergency replacements. The 10 x 5 x 12-inch package isn’t bulky, and it fits neatly under the bathroom cupboard or on a shelf. Those 320 sheets per roll? Perfect for someone like me who prefers not to hear the dreaded phrase, “we’re out of toilet paper,” before my morning coffee.

[Grab Angel Soft 79342 at the best price on Amazon.](https://theveggieshop.com/p/b08xzvsk77/)

**Softness Meets Strength**  
Angel Soft wasn’t kidding when they labeled it “soft and strong.” I tested its strength by folding it multiple times—nothing ripped, and it maintained its integrity better than expected. Even during heavy-duty tests (yes, we all know what that means), there were no awkward situations. Despite boasting remarkable strength, it retained a soft-to-the-touch texture, making it gentle on the skin. It's noticeably more plush compared to its regular sibling. Seriously, this is the luxury spa experience of toilet paper without making you feel guilty about the splurge. Well, almost.

**Eco-Conscious Features**  
Sustainability isn’t the first thing I think of when picking toilet paper, but I’ve started to become more mindful now. These rolls are made from SFI sustainably sourced trees, which means the fibers are responsibly harvested. This gives it an eco-conscious edge over some competitors in the market. It's always a win when a product combines daily utility with some level of environmental responsibility. Plus, the septic-safe promise works for me since my old plumbing is slightly temperamental (my home feels like it's in a 1980s time warp).

**Upsides**  
- The mega rolls last noticeably longer than regular ones.  
- Soft yet sturdy sheets deliver top-tier comfort.  
- Eco-friendly production ensures a reduced carbon footprint.  
- Convenient package size allows for simple storage.

**Drawbacks**  
- The thickness can lead to occasional clogging if too much is flushed at once.  
- It’s still a 2-ply, so while it’s soft, don’t expect the luxe multilayer feel of pricier alternatives.  
- Price-wise, it leans slightly on the higher side, especially if discounted options aren’t available.

**Competing Brands in the Market**  
Putting Angel Soft Ultra next to other household names, such as Charmin Ultra Soft or Scott ComfortPlus, was an interesting exercise. While Charmin may win hands down in terms of sheer softness, it tends to clog septic systems more often—a problem I didn't experience here. Scott, on the other hand, boasts budget-friendly pricing but lacks the softness department, feeling somewhat like sandpaper compared to Angel Soft’s luxurious feel. The defining balance of strength and plushness makes this product stand out in usage for both adults and kids. However, if sheet-count-for-price is your top priority, generic brands may serve a slightly better bang for your buck. You've just got to decide what’s a dealbreaker and what isn’t.

**Price to Quality Ratio**  
Considering the higher sheet count, strength, and plushness offered, the product does well to justify its price tag. Some may hesitate at first due to slightly pricier options compared to budget-brand rolls, but the longevity and experience make up for it. Think about it this way: isn’t it better to pay a bit more for rolls that last longer, making you feel pampered without unexpected “rip” moments mid-use? It’s premium household quality without completely breaking the bank.

Remembered things:
- any creative thing (painting/sculpting/yarn related hobbies)
- using software
- drop me somewhere random in a city I'm semi familiar with and I will make it home
- cooking (not baking though!)

Forgotten things:
- how to properly do any exercise at the gym, even if I've just watched someone do it
- making an espresso
- was playing divinity original sin 2 yesterday and my partner was having to [yet again] remind me of basic mechanics of the game.  Despite us having 150 hours in the game together, every time we come back to it after some time I forget how to play the game (but remember all the niche story bits??)
- all my passwords just become muscle memory until I forget what that is and have to reset everything :/
- I forget how to clean things, every time I think I end up using different mixtures of tools/products for the bathroom
- love singing my own versions of songs but forget how I liked to sing it
- forget how to tie my shoes (this may be more me losing focus and walking off with loose laces but you'd think it would be muscle memory by now right?

I also wrote a whole tangent on making coffee  so if you manage to complete that task regularly I'd love to hear how you do it lol 

Writing this in light of me finally giving up on my coffee machine. I've had it for a couple years now and if I manage to get myself organised everyday consistently for a few weeks, I know what I'm doing. But if I miss one day you'd think I'd never used it before - wrong amount of beans, wrong pressure, wrong order of things, forgetting to tamp, sometimes I even forget to grab a mug before starting extraction! 

Utterly hopeless. I hate thinking about how many beans I've wasted. Since I'm perfectionistic I end up getting stuck making espresso after espresso going ""this time I'll do it right"" then wasting an hour, driving my partner crazy.

She was also dairy free (had diary free yogurt)….. from there we slowly added things back. She was taking canxida remove and restore, as suggested by her doctor. On January 31st, 2025 we got the test results back confirming we had officially gotten rid of her H. pylori and Candida!! Yay!!

After the diet, things felt better. Energy was back, rarely nauseous, significantly less anxious… but other symptoms persisted… Itchiness, dizziness, bloating, the redness/bumps after itching (so she tried to avoid itching at all costs, because when she does, it spreads and becomes really intense), and started flushing, badly.

The flushing was when she was anxious, or hot, or pretty much any emotion beyond neutral. She had to start taking luke warm/cold showers just because her entire body would be red/puff when touched. She started taking daily antihistamines (DAO), but it really didn’t help. She did find that Zyrtec helped a lot, but you can’t stay on that forever. We did run some experiments with her, we had her take as hot of a shower as she could reasonably do, while drinking as much ice cold water as she could manage. Doing so, keeping her core temperature as cold as possible, drastically helped, with minimal flushing. Not sure if that’s helpful information but I found it interesting.

March 17th she started a HEAVY Liver/Kidney detox, (look up push catch Liver/Kidney detox. She did the heavy option).   Didn’t help with anything really, maybe could go slightly longer without getting flush, but we’re talking 3 minutes in the shower vs 60 seconds.

April 20th, started getting supposed fibroids cysts in ankles, and breasts (???) slightly painful to the touch, hard, doctors call them benign.

May 17th 2025, We assumed there was something in her diet, so we looked at what we started eating more of during/after the MEVY diet, and concluded she had started eating a whole lot more coconut, a whole lot more nuts, and a whole lot more alternate milks (almond milk) (she was dairy free during all of this, but had been for a little over a year). So we cut out nuts, coconut, and went back to cows milk, specifically A2 whole milk and cheeses (because she has to eat something. She was dairy free because of casein levels, and we learned this was a good substitute, and she reacted well to it, yay!). Doing so helped a lot. She didn’t really have any flushing for several weeks, and when she would try something like coconut, she would react (flush) again

From cutting coconut/nuts/etc we saw noticeable improvement. Everything improved slightly, dizziness was gone, itching wasn’t nearly as intense, but the flushing state about the same, if not got worse. Either way, it was nice to see other symptoms going away, it felt like we were finally making some progress

Up to today (August 25th 2025), she’s tried just living with it, she eats low histamine foods, we eat almost exclusively whole foods or minimally processed foods, avoid bad oils, food dyes, does eat more dairy (primarily because she needs the calories/protein), has reintroduced coffee (hadn’t drank coffee since beginning of 2024), and recently has recently gone on a crap ton of vitamins, all from referrals in this group. (*inhales* folate, vitamin D3, B7, B12, B9, B1, B2, B6, B3, B5, magnesium, copper, zinc) she does have the MTHFR gene, and we are doing the methylated versions of things. 

She’s been all on all of those vitamins for about 10 days now, and hasn’t really noticed improvements. When I asked her, she said it was about 5% better. All of the amounts are the recommended daily amounts excluding the B1 which she is on 50mg (we read that increasing this has helped people) we both know 10 days isn’t necessarily as long as we should probably wait, but we won’t be stopping those just yet

Anyway, that’s pretty much where we’re at, and we are out of ideas. Would love any advice anybody has people who have gone through this, what worked for you… really just whatever I can do for my wife that we aren’t already doing. Thank you ",5,1756147642.0,HistamineIntolerance,19,0.86,False

I 43F have been in a middistance relationship with my boyfriend 45M for 2 years now. We see each other about 2 weekends per month so not that often. From the start of our relationship my boyfriend has had an issue of not looking at my naked body ie. in shower or other rare situations where I dont have clothes on out of bedroom. He has explained that it is because of his own insecurities and shyness. Obviously this has made feel sometimes unwanted and unattractive. 

This issue came up once again last weekend when I was spending a weekend at his place. In the morning I walked topless to kitchen to make coffee. He came too and instead of me getting his full attention or any looks/admiration he asked do I want a hoodie. I said no and something about giving him some eyecandy. He didnt reply really anything and didnt once raise his eyes up to look at me as we sat by the table to drink morning coffee. Just chatted this and that. I told him that it makes me feel so bad that he dont feel the need to look at my body. He said it is nothig to do with me he is just shy and uncomfortable to look. I cant tell u how unwanted this makes me feel as a woman and I spent half of the homejourney crying. 

Today I brought up the subject again over a phone call. I said I find it hard to believe that after 2 years he would feel shy about my body and that it would make feel happy if he would look at me. He said he already explained himself and dont feel like there is anything else to talk about and that he does look at me when Im not watching. Phone call went on me telling him that as my partner he should make an effort making me feel desired and he telling me he dont want to continue this phonecall and hanging up. 

Im feeling unseen and unwanted. Im thinking am I really asking too much. If the reason for his behaviour isnt lack of attraction but purely some issues he has within himself am I asking too much from him to give a look despite that shyness/issues. If he knows that giving me a glance that I notice and some nice words about my body would make me feel worthy and desired and smile for a long time instead of crying in the train is it really too much and selfish of me to ask it from him? I love making him feel wanted and dont forget to let him know how much I desire every inch of his body. I cant conprehend why he wouldnt want to do this simple small thing that is important to me.

1mzyt3s,https://www.reddit.com/r/Advice/comments/1mzyt3s/just_discovered_my_gf_of_1_years_family_has_had/,"Just discovered my GF of 1 year's family has had quite an extensive history of violent crime, not sure what to do now.","I've been dating my GF for about a year now, we didn't know each other before we dated - we made eye contact and I just asked for her number in a Walmart. So we literally knew nothing about each other including family history.



Things have been going very well, however, up until around 2 months ago I hadn't met any of her family, despite her meeting mine briefly. We always either picked each other up or met at our dates. I only went inside her house when everyone was out or at work. It was weird to me after that amount of time but I didn't put much thought into it. When I did meet her family we spoke about it beforehand and I went inside her house to have a coffee and introduce myself.



I can't put my finger on what it was, but her dad seemed odd. I got the sense he had seen some stuff in his life just from the way he acted. It was a stark contrast from the way my GF is. She is one of the happiest and buzziest people I have ever met. He seemed very cold and just looked unhappy, even though he seemed to like me, and told GF he did. Although I haven't seen him much since, every interaction with him since then has seemed the same way. Nothing specifically negative, but the guy is very intimidating. He hasn't done anything to make it seem like he would hurt me, he just is a bit scary. Her Mom seemed really friendly.



My GF is black and I am white. They have a very traditional black surname without being specific. My Mom is a bit racist and told me from the start that my GFs family name was linked to lots of crime as soon as I told her it. I called her out for this and moved on.

This morning my Mom called me to say she had googled my GF's family's name. At first I was angry she would start stalking and being racist again, until she sent me what she had found. It looks like her dad and his brothers were involved in some pretty heavy gang crime, selling drugs and robbing people around 15 years ago, some of it getting quite violent. It also looks like her Dad's immediate family has had a pretty famous murder case around 30 years ago. I have no reason to believe there has been anything since these news articles, but from what I have looked at I am 99% sure it is him and his family. The details and names are exactly the same. It would be too much of a coincidence not to be. It all agrees with what she has told me about where and when they lived in certain areas, but the reasons for them moving around are obviously different. 

  
My question now is, what do I do? I feel quite stressed and borderline unsafe knowing what he has done. Not that anything will happen to me, but now that I know that she comes from quite a violent family, I feel really unsettled. GF, her Mom and her brother/sister all seem like the kindest people who wouldn't hurt a fly.   


We are both 24 and in the US. 

Any advice on what to do next is appreciated. Thanks.

  
TLDR: My Mom discovered news articles showing my GF's Dad and his family involved in violent crime in the past, but she hasn't mentioned it up until now. GF shows no sign of this. GF's Dad has always creeped me out. I feel unsettled now that I know this.",2,1756147154.0,Advice,5,1.0,False

But now, for the past month or so, I noticed my bg  level in the morning after not eating for twelve hours was at 107...

I just want to talk about it because I am tired.,"I broke up with my ex boyfriend after he started getting really jealous of me spending time with my guy friends I have known for years. He literally asked me to change out of gym shorts when it was almost 95 degrees outside saying he didn't understand why I wanted to ""show off my body"" when hanging out with them. Gross. We are both in our mid-30s and I just didn't want to deal with this nonsense. He was really devastated because he had told me earlier that he wanted to marry me.

So after a few months, I decided it was time to move on. I made a dating profile and matched with a guy, James. We had a lot in common and he set up a date where we would get coffee. On the morning of the date, I let him know that I would be late but that I was wearing a white dress. My date never showed up. While I was waiting for my coffee, my ex messaged me telling me that he wanted to move on. I thought that was really weird timing but didn't think anything of it. I spent the day being really sad that I got stood up. It was the first date I had scheduled and it just wasn't a good omen.

Later, I bumped into my ex boyfriend when I was out with one of my friends. He said that one of his friends saw me in a white dress at a coffee shop earlier that morning and asked what I was doing. I told him I was just out getting coffee. We live in a relatively small-ish city, so it wasn't totally out of the ordinary that someone would see me so I just thought it was weird timing.

A few weeks later, I match with another guy, Travis. He starts asking me to hang out in really low effort ways. I say no. About an hour later, I get a text from my ex complaining that he wishes I would give him another chance. This time, I start feeling *really* weird about the timing and start suspecting that my ex has something to do with these matches. I talk to my friend about it and she convinces me that there is *no* *way* that this is related and that the dating apps just suck. She encourages me to talk to my counselor about this. My counselor talks through it with me and I decide that I am just being paranoid and that dating apps really do suck. I start wondering whether or not things were *that* bad with my ex - maybe dealing with his insecurities would be better than getting stood up or dealing with low effort guys!

Then, Travis messages me again and asks to hang out in another low effort way. I say no. Later that evening, my ex shows up with flowers and asks for another chance. I call my guy friend who convinces me to reverse image search both Travis and James' profiles. Sure enough, their photos link back to different people! I look at the profiles and all of the prompts relate to *me* in some way. Nothing specific, but like very small, niche things that my ex knew would lead to conversation. Things like: ""ask me about my love of hotdog eating contests!"" or ""I am prepping to hike the Grand Canyon!""

I confronted my ex about it and he denies. He tells me that yes, he did make a dating profile and that's why he decided to message me and let me know he is moving on. Then says, ""we both lied to each other though"". I asked him what he meant and he said that I told him that I was just getting coffee and that I didn't go on dates yet. This is where he messed up. How did he know about the date where I got stood up? So he admits to making two fake profiles and intentionally trying to match with me. He said that it was because he wanted to know if I was moving on and didn't want to have the conversation with me.  He told me that he was really upset that I wasn't forthcoming about what I had been up to, and that we ""both made mistakes here"". I asked him if he told anyone, and he said that he only told his counselor who was disappointed in him. He also said ""You matched with both of my profiles! Doesn't this show that we are actually a good match?"" 

I am so creeped out by this. I blocked him on everything and my sister did too. My friends and I decided that it isn't safe for me to stay on the apps because now that he knows I figured out his usual schitck, he might be less overt. I am afraid that if I match with another one of his fake profiles, he will try to confront me in person. By him doing this, I know that using the apps isn't safe for me to use. My dating pool is already extremely limited. I don't really know that many people and I really want to have kids and time is running out for that. He knows this. It's intentional. My extended family keeps getting on me about settling down and I feel like such a failure because I really do want to do that, too. While my ex boyfriend was actually pretty decent before he got insecure and jealous, I just didn't want to deal with that. But I'm older now and dating is harder and I already feel like I'm at a disadvantage. Not being able to use the apps makes things so much harder for me...

It's back to school season! And as some of you may know I like to collect school supplies for our local underfunded classrooms as a way to help teachers keep teaching without going broke.

This month I am giving away 2 hours of free time and labor. Two hours of help with chores and tasks that you may have been putting off for whatever reason.

Need a piece of furniture assembled? Gutters Cleaned? Garage organized? Windows washed? Ganden cleaned and weeded? Or any other general labor task that you need help with? I'm your guy!

My goal is to completely stock one or two classrooms for the year with all the supplies they need and I'm certain with your help and donations I can make it happen!

It's a win-win! Classrooms get the supplies they need and you get that pesky chore done! Easy right?

In exchange for your donation you will receive a Voucher for 2-hours of free labor (a $60 value) that you can redeem anytime. It does not expire and it is transferrable, in case you know someone that could use a helping hand. 

Simply send me a DM and we can schedule a day to either get your task done or deliver your Voucher that you can keep for a rainy day.

In the past when I have done this I have been advised to put up my Venmo for those who would like to donate but don't need help with anything (though I would still honor your donation with a voucher).

So, If you would like to donate funds that will be used to purchase more school supplies you can Venmo me at @Vic-Sharp. 

In the spirit of transperancy I will do a followup post showing the amount raised, purchased, and donated with proof of receipt. 

I accept all types of new or unused school supplies, however here is a short list of the most needed items.

- Notebooks/Journals 
- Pens/Pencils 
- Fill paper 
- Construction paper 
- Glue 
- Scissors
- Crayons/color pencisl
- Erasers
- Dry erase markers/mini white boards 
- Reading books (elementary grade) 
- Pencil cases 
- Coffee giftcards for the teachers!

Thank you for taking the time to read my long post. I am looking forward to connecting with you all and working hard to make sure our schools are set up for success this year.

Stay hydrated!

The distance between my apartments is about 50 minutes, give or take. This morning after getting coffee and walking back into my new apartment, I got a notification that an AirTag is following me. I have never even owned one and I don't know much about them at all. I notified the police but without the serial number, they said they can't do much. It shows me at my apartment that I am moving out of five times. At my new apartment, it showed 14 times this morning. 

Now It says 30+ because I have been digging through my apartment trying to find it and I keep connecting to it. It says it's in my small bedroom, which is stuffed with boxes and trash bags of blankets/ clothes. I opened all the bags and didn't find anything. I've moved some boxes out of the room, and everything else off the side of the room it says it's on to the other side. It says it's 14 ft in front of me, but I live in an apartment with a shared wall and it says it's in my neighbors apartment. When I go downstairs to the back of the building, it still says it's in my neighbors apartment. 

I have tried to make it ring or make noise, but it won't make any sound. I live with my boyfriend, but he's about to go on a trip for two weeks and I will be home alone. I fear this is real and someone is following me and they know where I live. 

Does anyone know anything about this? I looked at another reddit post where a lot of people have had this issue after moving. I don't think it's my neighbors because it has me at my previous home that's 50ish minutes away. I'm hoping this is a fluke because I am scared. Any advice or knowledge would be greatly appreciated.

1mzylc0,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1mzylc0,Italian Ration Review and Signal Appreciation!,"(Error with first post... pics didn't upload)  
  
This is my first ration review with many more in the pipe ready to go. Signal asked me to do a shout out, which I've received 5 orders from him over the past 2 years, and there hasn't been a single issue! Thank you my friend! I was lucky enough to snag a Module F with Cordial.

The semi-metallic ration pack contains 3 meal boxes, broken up in to Breakfast, Lunch, and Supper. I did not try the teas or coffee. All items were heated on stovetop. Cutlery was standard flimsy and got the job done.

**Breakfast** was too light and started off with a bang. Needed some protein.  
\- **Sweet Biscuits:** Nice and sweet, paired REALLY well with the jam.  
\- **Apricot Jam:** I either wanted more to go with the sweet biscuits or have more sweet biscuits. Nice flavor to it, but a little hard to spread with the spoon.  
\- **Cappuccino:** Decent flavor, nothing special. Sadly, I wasn't able to get it dissolved completely. I wish I didn't add the cordial to it.  
\- **Cordial:** 40% during breakfast? Damn. Sweet and strong on it's own, but had a slight plastic taste to it.

**Lunch** was very hearty and unique with the bran and multi-vitamin tablets. Well-rounded.  
\- **Minestrone:** Nice, seasoned well, and rich. Flavor of a tomato base with beans, carrot, peas, and potato.  
\- **Fruit Cocktail:** Same Dole Fruit Cocktail minus the cherries.. Unlucky I guess.  
\- **Beef in Jelly:** Jelly was cooked off and the beef had a nice meaty flavor and moisture to it. Paired really well with the crackers.  
\- **2 Pack Crackers:** Beat to hell, and went well with the beef and minestrone.

**Dinner** was lighter and a nice end to the day. Well-rounded.  
\- **Ravioli Ragu:** Honestly, a better consistency Chef Boyardee (don't hurt me). Lighter sauce, and the meat was pleasant.  
\- **Tuna with Beans:** Surprised by this one and it was delicious. Ate it cold and the beans were a unique but nice touch. Went well with the crackers. Oily with a tomato base.  
\- **2x Energy Bars:** What a nice chocolate and apricot flavor. Easy to eat and a nice treat.  
\- **1 Pack Crackers:** Same as above, except more beat up.

All in all, the Italian ration was a cleaner and lighter calorie ration with extra goodies that made it more complete. Bran tablets, multi-vitamins, toothbrush, easy to use stove, and water purification tabs. It would have been nice to have other drinks, something more electrolyte based. Packaging was larger for what it contained.

More to follow!

As somebody who has spent two-fifths of my young adulthood working in hospitality, I can confidently say that I’ve probably dealt with the best and the worst of humanity, each wearing a different face. From memorable celebrity encounters, guests stealing towels like they’re the last fabric on earth, sexual harassment, people clapping cheeks loudly without a care in the world, to villainous guests demanding royal treatment, manipulative colleagues, and the elusive nature of the paranormal. It’s been such a ride!

Hotels attract people from all walks of life and cultures. People you’d likely never cross paths with unless you worked in a hotel. It significantly broadens your scope of reference, because you regularly interact with people from diverse cultures, professions, and backgrounds, giving you a deeper understanding of the world beyond your own experience.

I worked in hotels throughout Indonesia for years, starting in the Front Desk Department and slowly transitioning to Marketing. And if there’s one thing I learned, aside from how to reset a key card while trying to suppress a scream, it’s that nothing reveals a person’s real self faster than a check-in desk at 2 a.m.

These are the stories of how I gave the best years of my life... to some of the worst people imaginable. And this is going to be a _looong_ post.

**The Devil Wears Name Tags**

Working in the marketing department of a four-star hotel sounds a lot more glamorous than it actually is. Sure, we dabble in social media strategy and brand visibility, but a large chunk of my day revolves around a tedious but crucial responsibility: managing reservations. Every booking, whether it comes through an online travel agency (OTA), direct phone call, walk-in guest, corporate client, or even an Excel spreadsheet emailed by a government body (usually formatted like it was typed during the Windows 95 era), passes through my hands before it ever reaches our Property Management System (PMS). I’m essentially the gatekeeper of room allotment. Some people protect the realm. Me? I protect the grid.

My colleague, let’s call her Vina, also from Marketing, was the type of person who would let you walk around all day with a lipstick stain on your face and a wedgie between your butt crack without saying a word. She always had this look on her face like something foul was permanently stuck right under her nose. She’s obese and very sensitive about it, oftentimes claiming that obesity runs in her family. I doubt anybody runs in her family.

She hid behind her ever-ecclesiastical persona, always thanking God for everything and mumbling a gospel song as she went. But I saw right through her. Some of us did. She was a nasty piece of shit of a manipulative human being. She needed an exorcism for sure despite her most favourite catchphrase: _‘Praise The Lord’_ or her weekly _'Happy Sunday. GBU!’_ on our Whatsapp group chat.

She always had to be in on everything. Sometimes I forgot what it was like to have an uninterrupted conversation whenever she was around. She constantly made fun of how skinny I was and tossed in some passive-aggressive comments about how I needed facials to get rid of my pimples. She’s one to talk. With those protruding teeth, she could eat corn on the cob through a tennis racket. Her boyfriend, a guy from Engineering, whom I was close and went to church with, of all people, was the friendliest person I’d ever met. I had no idea what he saw in her. I guess some of us just have to do community service.

Out of all the times she threw me under the bus, this one really stuck. It started when she approached me regarding a group reservation. She was in charge of handling bookings for all government-related accounts. That day, she said she needed me to block 80 rooms for 5 nights, from June 20th to June 25th (if I remember correctly), for a delegation from the Ministry of Justice.

“Fullboard for the first three nights, then halfboard for the last two,” she added in passing.

So, I proceeded to enter the reservation manually into our system. I created a group block in the PMS, assigned a unique group code, tagged the reservation under her name for internal tracking, and labeled the board type accordingly. I also ensured the reservation included rooming details, payment method (which, in government cases, is often billed via Letter of Authorization or Payment Guarantee, basically the hotel equivalent of a pinky swear), and that all guest communications; confirmation letters, proforma invoices, and the usual welcome email, were appropriately filed and synced with our CRM.

But before I signed off, I did what I always do: I double-checked.

I sent a message to our department WhatsApp group: _“Just a heads-up, I’ve created the reservation for the Ministry of Justice group: 80 rooms, June 20th to 25th. Full board for 3 nights, then half board for the last 2. Please confirm everything is correct.”_

She replied: _“Yes. Thank you!”_

I moved on. No red flags.

Fast-forward two months. A week before the arrival date.  Suddenly, she called me into a meeting, panicked.

“There’s a problem with the government booking,” she said. “They’re only coming from June 21st, not the 20th. And it’s only for 60 rooms, not 80.”

I blinked. “Wait—what?”

Apparently, she had miscommunicated the booking details to me, but now it was too late. We had blocked off 80 rooms, 20 more than needed. for an extra night that the guests were never planning to stay. As you might guess, it had already skewed our Occupancy Forecast, Revenue Per Available Room (RevPAR), and Group Business Report. The front office had even planned out room assignments based on the erroneous data.

And worse, the rooms we blocked could have been sold elsewhere. In the hospitality world, displacement cost is no joke. Seriously… more terrifying than the minibar prices.

The issue got escalated to HR. Our Revenue Manager and General Manager were copied in. During the meeting, this girl attempted to shift the blame onto me, claiming I had misunderstood the dates and numbers. She framed it as an input error on my part.

But I came prepared.

I pulled up the screenshot of our WhatsApp conversation, showed it to everyone, and walked them through it. Her confirmation _“Yes. Thank you!”_ was right there, timestamped and unambiguous. I had followed standard operating procedures: reconfirmed the details, received her approval, and input everything based on her instruction.

The room fell silent.

After a beat, HR nodded. “Alright. Based on this, it’s clear the error stemmed from the information given, not the execution.”

She couldn’t say anything. She just looked down and quietly accepted the decision. Not quite a mic-drop moment, but close enough for corporate life. In the end, she would spend the rest of her time working there resenting me. Like I was struggling to find any excuse to give a fuck.

That day, I learned two important things in life as a young adult:

_One, **always** keep receipts. Literal or digital, it doesn’t matter. Screenshots are the modern-day holy scriptures._

_And two, hotel work isn’t just about service and smiles. It’s also about covering your ass._

**The Possessed & The Undressed**

One of the underrated perks of working the night shift at a hotel, aside from unlimited coffee and mastering the art of pretending to look busy, is the occasional encounter with a sex worker. They're like raccoons, these ladies. Nocturnal, mysterious, and somehow always slipping past security with more confidence than the actual guests. Most come and go quietly, do their business, and vanish before sunrise like cleavage ninjas. But every now and then, one of them leaves a trail of chaos that even corporate HR can’t file under ‘miscellaneous incident.’

I had one bizarre experience while working the night shift as a front desk agent. A curvy woman in a dangerously tight nightdress showed up while I was typing away on the computer. I didn’t even see her walk in. I heard her, courtesy of those ridiculously massive earrings throwing a full-blown rave on her lobes. She claimed she was there to meet a guest named Mr. W supposedly staying in room three hundred-something up on the 3rd floor. I picked up the desk phone and dialed his room to confirm, and to my surprise, this is how the conversation went.

_Me: “Sir, I do apologize for disturbing you at this hour, but there’s a lady in the lobby who says she’s here to see you.”_

_Mr. W: “I see…”_

_Me: “Sir?”_

_Mr. W: “Is she pretty though?”_

_Me: “Sir?”_

_Mr. W: “That woman. Is she pretty?”_

_Me (now thoroughly confused): I… I don’t know, Sir. I suppose… She is?”_

_Mr. W: “Could you take a picture of her covertly with your phone and send it to my WhatsApp?”_

Why, though?

_Me: “I am afraid I am not allowed to do that.”_

_Mr. W (bedgrudgingly): “Well, send her up, then!”_

So up she went.

Not even an hour had passed before the woman stormed dramatically back into the lobby. I was in the back room, attempting to flirt with a nap, when I heard commotion outside. I stepped out to find one of our security guys trying to pacify the woman, now dressed in what could only be described as a hand towel and pure emotion. She was bawling hysterically, and the towel she’d snatched on her way out was barely hanging on, covering just enough to keep us from getting sued.

When I asked her what was wrong, she told me, through tears and a full-body shudder, that they were mid-act when Mr. W suddenly got possessed by an evil spirit. I exchanged confused glances with security and quickly sent them upstairs to check on him. They found the poor guy on the floor, shaking violently, eyes rolled back, limbs stiff. He was having an epileptic seizure. Apparently, he’d forgotten to take his meds. He seemed to be in his late 20s, fit and good-looking. Though I personally thought that barely-there moustache needed to go. He’s fine, though. Totally stable. Been living with it for years.

The most bizarre part of that night? As soon as he came to, she went back upstairs and they resumed right where they left off. She’s still holding on to that financial prospect tighter than he’s holding on to that moustache.

Girl wasn’t about to let a demon, or a seizure, get in the way of her getting la—I mean, paid.

**A Lavatorial Affair**

It was fifteen minutes to three, I remember vividly. I had just clocked in for the afternoon shift, mentally preparing myself for another day of doing nothing with great intensity, when my colleague suddenly materialized right in front of me and casually went “We’re doomed!”. He said it with the urgency of someone who’d just been told that tooth fairy wasn’t real. 

A big-shot political figure was checking in within an hour. His wingman just booked the presidential suite and with that, our regular coma of an afternoon turned into a full-blown disaster drill. I’m talking people sprinting down hallways, female colleagues redoing their makeup and hairdos, and housekeeping frantically re-mopping the already glasslike floor. It was bizarre. We (the boys) were told to go down to the locker room to de-hair our bodies. _(No visible facial hair! Not one strand!)._ If a cat had wandered into the hotel, it would have been skinned alive. 

It was unusually quiet when a pair of men in formal suits walked in, flanking a short, plump, stern-looking figure in sunglasses. We all recognized him instantly, a prominent political heavyweight, the kind that made headlines wherever he went. No luggage, no entourage, no pretense. Just a reservation under a generic name and a request: a room for a few hours.

He was gone before the sun dipped below the parking structure. No room service, no calls, not even a wrinkle on the bedsheets.

As soon as the coast was clear, my supervisor leaned over and muttered, “Bro just checked in to pee. That’s the level of rich I want to be. _‘Book a five-star suite just to take a piss in’_ rich.”

I ignored him, still salty that I’d dehaired myself for nothing!

**Breakfast and Breakdown**

One would think that working the Front Desk at a hotel would be glamorous. Sharp uniforms, professional convos, polite smile exchanges, maybe a few rich guests who tip in USD. Instead, at times it’s mostly angry guests demanding extra towels like it’s a hostage negotiation, or any other comical requests, and us explaining over and over, that yes, sir/ma’am, the minibar is not complimentary.

One time while I was checking out an elderly guest, he kindly reminded me that his room included breakfast for two, but since he had peacefully slept through it, he was wondering if I could refund him for the ghosts of two plates of fried rice he never met. I looked at him, torn between admiration and incredulity. This type of person feels almost mythical, until you actually meet one.

Another run-in with a cheeky, wily guest. I was checking out yet another guy who had managed to lose his room key-card. I told him he’d have to pay the replacement fee, just 50,000 IDR.

He looked at me like I’d just slapped his grandma and went, “You kidding me? What kind of hotel charges for a lost key?”

And I was this close to replying, “The kind whose keys get abducted by irresponsible man-babies like you, bitch!”


***


**Pre-Auth & Prejudice**

The man walked up to the Front Desk, his wife and all of his offspring in tow. He had booked three rooms for five nights. The reservation included breakfast for two per room. Easy stuff. But then he opened his mouth.

“We’ll also be having lunch and dinner here,” he said, handing over his ID proudly. “And the kids might grab snacks from the minibar.”

“Noted,” I replied. “Since meals and incidentals aren’t covered in your reservation, would you prefer to settle everything at check-out, Sir?”

He gave a casual nod. “Yeah, just put everything on the card.”

That’s when I tried to gently introduce him to the terrifying concept of basic hotel policy.

“In that case, sir, we’ll do a credit card pre-authorization. Totally standard. We just place a temporary hold to cover the room charges and estimated expenses, minibar, meals, laundry, etc.”

For the uninitiated, CC Pre-Authorization is basically a temporary hold on your credit card. It's not a charge. The amount we hold includes your total room rate and a little extra for any incidentals. It’s only a temporary block on your available balance, and when you check out, we’ll finalize the amount you actually spent. Whatever you didn’t use will be released automatically. We love this type of payment because it makes our job a lot easier, really.

He blinked. “Hold? What do you mean, hold?”

“It’s not a charge,” I explained, smiling like a hostage. “It just earmarks the total from your available credit. We don’t take the money yet.”

He stared like I’d just asked for a kidney. “So you’re taking my money now?”

“No, sir. We’re just reserving it.”

He wasn’t buying it. “Then why not just charge me at the end? Like normal hotels?”

Ah yes, the mythical ‘normal hotels’. Probably found next to Hogwarts.

“This is how we secure payment for longer stays or when guests plan to rack up expenses,” I tried to explain.

He frowned at me. “So the money’s gone?”

“Not gone,” I said through gritted teeth. _Just taking a nap. Goddamnit!_

Still unconvinced, he muttered something about scams. Eventually, and with the enthusiasm of someone giving blood against his will, he handed me his credit card. I ran the pre-auth and handed him the receipt.

“This isn’t a charge, Sir” I reassured him again. “The actual amount will be finalized when you check out.”

He took the papers like they were radioactive. “Still sounds shady.”

I gave him the corporate smile we all keep in our emergency drawer and pointed toward the elevators. “Your rooms are ready, sir. Enjoy your stay.” And then I ducked behind the counter and cried myself to death.

**Drop Me Off Like One of Your Vain Girls**

I’ve had my share of run-ins with famous people. Again, if you haven’t read my previous posts, go do that and come back for the tea. Anyway this local singer was booked to stay at the hotel for four nights. I won’t name names (because I enjoy having a job) but she was the diva to end all divas. Before she even graced us with her presence, her assistant had gone full negotiator mode, demanding a major discount on the executive suite, free airport pick-up, and insisting the room be blessed with a complimentary fruit basket and minibar. Sure. Why not? Anything else? A mariachi band, perhaps?

During her stay, when she was not out performing, she would lounge by the pool in a skimpy pastel two piece, soaking up the sun and flaunting more legs than a bucket of KFC. Whenever anybody approached her for a photo, she would simply wave them peasants off dismissively.

On her last day, during check out, her assistant again demanded a free airport drop-off. When I politely explained that wasn’t possible, they both went full _‘Do you know who we are?’_ mode, a textbook celebrity meltdown. They scolded me for not realizing how blessed we were to have someone of her ‘caliber’ gracing our tragically overlooked five-star hotel. They even threatened to cancel all of their imaginary future reservations.

Right? A _diva_!

But sorry, Miss Leggy. Still a no. After a few more rounds of passive-aggressive insults and not-so-passive shots fired directly at my competence as a front desk peasant, they finally gave up and ordered an online taxi, like the rest of us mere mortals.

**Rate Expectations**

The world is split into two kinds of people: _those who know how hotel pricing works, and those who don’t._

We had a German guest coming in a day early and demanding a room at the same rate as his reservation, which is utter nonsense. Hotel pricing depends on many factors related to its rating system, and your feelings are not one of them.

Our occupancy for that night was already going through the roof, we were one confused guest away from someone having to sleep in the mop closet. So I tried, with the fakest smile I had been practicing from day one on my face, to explain to this guy why his very specific and completely unreasonable request just wasn’t happening. But apparently, he'd either never booked a hotel before or thought he could bend reality with the sheer force of his aggressively Bavarian cadence. _(""I vould like da room, same rate, ja? I am zo tired und zo zad. I need ze sleep right now!"")._

I swear to God… The only reason I didn’t start pounding the counter screaming _“Nein! Nein! Nein!”_ was because I didn’t want to be fired. Luckily we finally agreed on a reasonable rate for him.

**MILF: Manager I’d Like To Fire**

During my second year working at So-and-So Hotel, I began to transition to the marketing department. And so began my descent into the chaotic and dramatic politics of the corporate world of hospitality. As soon as I started working in the back office, it didn’t take long for me to become involved in a minor hush-hush scandal, one I barely made it out of alive.

The previous marketing manager packed up and relocated to another city, possibly to escape the chaos he helped create. That’s a story for another day. In his place came a new manager: a middle-aged, exuberant foul-mouthed woman with a booming accent, a love for unfiltered jokes, and an unusual liking for fragrances that smell like tear gas. She laughed openly without inhibition. You could hear her from across the street. She objectified men with the confidence of a catcalling construction worker. And yes, I was her favorite chew toy.

At one point, employee turnover was so bad, especially after the previous manager bailed. Eventually, I was the last man standing, like literally the man in the department. My female coworkers, perhaps out of pity or sheer desperation, adopted me as one of their own. I'd sworn off interoffice romance like it was a blood oath, so they trusted me not to do anything remotely male. Soon enough, I was a regular at the sacred lunch table.

They fed me gossip like my life depended on it. I didn’t even ask; they just unzipped the drama bag and dumped it on my lap. I’d mostly sit there silently, chewing my food and absorbing updates about whose husband might be gay or cheating, or both (and with whom). Honestly, it was one of the few parts of the job I genuinely enjoyed. It was like live theatre, but with brutally honest commentary about mismatched outfits, overblended contour, and controversial eyeshadow choices.

The new manager, let’s call her Miss B, was never invited to the sacred lunchtime gossip coven. Or at least not when the real tea was being poured. Her mouth was as discreet as a mosque loudspeaker on the night before Eid. She knew damn well that her no-filter energy and sailor-grade vulgarity weren’t exactly the house specialty in this uptight, prudish work culture. So she did what any socially exiled chaos agent would do: she turned to the one person who might understand. Me. The lone dude. The designated emotional support hetero.

So she started asking me to have lunch alone with her under the pretense of wanting to talk about specific reservations and stuff. Like, seriously, we have a group chat for that. Then she switched gears and said she just needed a smoking buddy since the other girls didn’t smoke. From there on, the awkward oversharing, all of it on her end, started. She talked about how her husband had been unable to satisfy her sexually, and how, since the birth of her third child, she hadn’t been able to reach orgasm. _Guuurrrl!_

I didn’t sign up to be the unpaid therapist for a frustrated and sexually unfulfilled suburban wife twice my age, honestly. I could only nod my head nervously and leave work that night deeply traumatized. But the worst was yet to come. She started affectionately referring to me as ‘babe’. Of course the other girls noticed. Eyebrows went up. Jaws dropped. One day they all cornered me in the dining room asking if I had clapped cheeks with our manager, which I flat-out denied.

Instead of backing off and remembering she was, oh I don’t know, my boss, Miss B decided to go full-throttle on her quest to claim my manhood like it was a prize in a raffle she rigged. Suddenly, my phone gallery started looking more like a 50-something year old pervert’s stash of old pornographic magazines. She'd send me unsolicited cleavage shots late at night, acting like she was just innocently crowdsourcing fashion advice: _“Which camisole looks better on me, babe? 😊”_

Right. Thanks for contacting us. I’m the CEO of Victoria’s Secret. How may I help you?

Then came the porn links. No context. No warning. Just straight-up smut clogging up my DMs like a corrupted algorithm. When I finally worked up the nerve to ask her what on earth she was doing, she sent me this stupid emoji 🤪, and went, “You’re a guy. Don’t guys, like, exchange porn links or whatever?”

Ah. Yes. Of course. The sacred hetero male bonding ritual. How could I forget?

Anyway, since I had finally decided that this woman was a lawsuit waiting to happen, I started screenshotting everything like my life depended on it. Which, honestly, it probably did. I looped in my girls at work too, because if I was going down, at least I had a paper trail and Sisterhood of The Lunch Table to back me up. I hadn’t done a damn thing, and I wasn’t about to get fired because Miss B confused me for someone with a mommy issues.

Fortunately, she didn’t last long there. After a heated and regionally charged argument with our General Manager who was also of Batak origin one afternoon, she promptly quit the following day.

**Graveyard Shifts**

Of course, no hotel story would be complete without a ghost or two lurking around, right? I know some of you have been scrolling just for this, the haunted hallway gossip, the flickering lights, the whispers when no one’s there. So, here goes.

Working the night shift at the hotel was usually predictable. After the last few check-ins trickled in around 11 p.m., the lobby would settle into silence. Calls to the front desk became rare, mostly requests for extra towels or a wake-up call. By 1 a.m., the whole building seemed to exhale. The air grew still. Even the elevators moved like they were half-asleep.

Some nights, when things were especially slow, a few of us from different departments would gather just outside the main entrance. We'd light cigarettes and make small talk, housekeeping gossip, guest complaints, kitchen screw-ups. It was our version of winding down, even if our shift was far from over.

That was the night a guy from the kitchen leaned against the planter box and said, almost too casually, “Have any of you heard about the man in the back corridor?”

We glanced at each other. Housekeeping shrugged. I said, “What man?”

He gave a half-smile. “He’s not real, supposedly. But some of the early kitchen crew keep seeing him.”

He told us the stories. How the bakers, who started at four in the morning to prep the breakfast buffet, sometimes spotted a figure at the edge of their vision. Always just out of reach. Never facing them. Just a man in outdated clothing, long-sleeved shirt, walking into one of the dry storage rooms or disappearing behind a shelf. No one had ever seen his face. No one had ever spoken to him. He never made a sound. But there was something about him that unsettled people deeply. Something cold, and wrong.

“It’s never direct,” he said. “They’ll just be chopping onions or washing trays, and suddenly the hairs on their neck stand up. Then they’ll look up and see his back turning a corner.”

“What if it’s just stress?” someone offered.

He shrugged. “Maybe. Or maybe not. You ever hear what this place was before it became a hotel?”

I hadn’t. Most of us hadn’t. The building looked new enough, glass facade, polished marble lobby, sensor lights that hummed softly. But he said the land had a longer memory than the building did.

“That dry storage room? If you go back there late enough, sometimes you can smell smoke. And not like from the fryer oil either. Like burnt plastic, burnt hair.”

I didn’t believe all of it, not really. But later that night, when I had to pass through the service corridor to check on a guest request, I couldn’t help noticing how cold the air felt back there, despite the always-running machines.

1mzyk14,https://www.reddit.com/r/sandiego/comments/1mzyk14/hello_san_diego_its_back_to_school_time_and_i_am/,Hello San Diego! It's back to school time and I am collecting school supplies and raising funds for local classrooms again! Claim your 2-Hour Voucher!,"Hey Guys!

Hope y'all are doing well and beating the heat! It's been fairly forgiving this year but even high 80s feels brutal at times. Time for some shaved ice!

It's back to school season! And as some of you may know I like to collect school supplies for our local underfunded classrooms as a way to help teachers keep teaching without going broke.

This month I am giving away 2 hours of free time and labor. Two hours of help with chores and tasks that you may have been putting off for whatever reason.

Need a piece of furniture assembled? Gutters Cleaned? Garage organized? Windows washed? Ganden cleaned and weeded? Or any other general labor task that you need help with? I'm your guy!

My goal is to completely stock one or two classrooms for the year with all the supplies they need and I'm certain with your help and donations I can make it happen!

It's a win-win! Classrooms get the supplies they need and you get that pesky chore done! Easy right?

In exchange for your donation you will receive a Voucher for 2-hours of free labor (a $60 value!) that you can redeem anytime. It does not expire and it is transferrable, in case you know someone that could use a helping hand. 

Simply send me a DM and we can schedule a day to either get your task done or deliver your Voucher that you can keep for a rainy day.

In the past when I have done this I have been advised to put up my Venmo for those who would like to donate but don't need help with anything (though I would still honor your donation with a voucher).

So, If you would like to donate funds that will be used to purchase more school supplies you can Venmo me at @Vic-Sharp. 

In the spirit of transperancy I will do a followup post showing the amount raised, purchased, and donated with proof of receipt. 

I accept all types of new or unused school supplies, however here is a short list of the most needed items.

- Notebooks/Journals 
- Pens/Pencils 
- Fill paper 
- Construction paper 
- Glue 
- Scissors
- Crayons/color pencisl
- Erasers
- Dry erase markers/mini white boards 
- Reading books (elementary grade) 
- Pencil cases 
- Coffee giftcards for the teachers!

Thank you for taking the time to read my long post. I am looking forward to connecting with you all and working hard to make sure our schools are set up for success this year.

Stay hydrated!

The UX Research Director attended, and she was really kind to students and gave them good advice.

They were exchanging LinkedIns, and I told her, “It turned out I already have you,” and she said, “Message me there!” as she was on the way out. Because she is Latino, she connected with my colleagues there who are Latino and became friends, and they were already planning to meet for coffee. I didn’t talk much with her but still want to message her. It would be amazing if I could work at their company or just connect, but I don’t know what to say.",3,1756146440.0,UXResearch,3,1.0,False

1mzyfw4,https://i.redd.it/ylog45nzi7lf1.jpeg,Translation of Still In Love's main menu lines,"art by [@acta\_0907](https://x.com/acta_0907)

With the release of Still In Love on the Japanese server, many (including me) are impressed by this passionate winner of the Japanese Triple Tiara. However I'm also seeing a concerning amount of misleading speculation and assumption about our girl and her story that, as someone who has at least read through most of the her content, I feel obligated to help dispell some of them with this translation.

DISCLAIMER:   
This post is intended to serve as a place to discuss Still In Love's character and her story, and thus will naturally contain **SPOILER**.   
My understanding of the story comes from Chinese fan translations posted on bilibili, this means that anything I claim here will not be 100% accurate. If anyone who understands Japanese wants to add to this post or correct any information, please let me know in the comment.   
My translation of her lines are intended to give people a rough idea of Still In Love's in-game characterization, and I will take a fair amount of liberty in what is a essentially a translation of a translation.



""Usually when I'm having lunch, I would set a timer. Otherwise, the lunch break would be over before I knew it..."" (*TL note: she is shown in the story as a very slow eater.*)

""You, who accept both my passion and my ugliness, are like that of a sun... and that of a kind dusk.""

""...It is you who gave me this blessing. Without you by my side, I can never feel this happiness... this everlasting, ever so sweet blessing.""

""I made some desserts, you can have some if you want. I will be... very happy if it's to your taste.""

""A red that is bright enough to wake you... it's like a reflection of **her** heart."" (*Note: ""her/that child"" likely refers to Still In Love's ""beastly"" side, which splits from her normal side after the latter rejected the aggresive part of her personality.*)

""When I watched the stars with Neo Universe, I can feel myself melting into that dazzling, starry sky... it's comforting"" (*TL note: Neo Universe is Still In Love's roommate.*)  
  
""The event seems to be going strong. I'll do my best to control myself, and not let everyone see my unbecoming side...""

""... I'm worried. Everytime I see Ramonu, I feel something burning deep within my heart... Ah... That feeling... It's here again..."" (*Note: Mejiro Ramonu was the first mare ever to win the Japanese Triple Tiara, with Still In Love being the second winner 17 years after.*)

""Tomatl☆Amaryllis! ...fufu, Sweep taught me this spell, which can make tamato juice taste good."" (*Note: Sweep Tosho is a self-proclaimed witch/magical girl, and her IRL counterpart compete with Still In Love.*)

""I'll avoid staying in dark places for awhile... The season attracts adventurous people, and they often mistake me as a ghost..."" (*Note: In story, her normal side has a supernaturally low level of presence, to the point where she struggles to order food because the cashier couldn't notice her.)*

""Sweet desserts and strong coffee, these are my secret weapon for receiving guests, fufu."" (*Note: SIL likes dessert and coffee, which is a reference to the habit of her one and only jockey.*)

""I got my hand dirty again... the popsicle melted before I can finish it...""

""I wish to know more about you... the hidden abyss that lies deep within your heart... I desire to be devoured by it, one day...""

""No... Not in here... Not like this... I... Can't hold it back anymore...""

""I like to lose myself in the vast sea of literature. Historical novels in particular allow me to visit the events of the past.""

""I only rested a bit under the shade, but everyone thought I had gone missing... it seems that having a low presence can be detrimental too.""

""Although being at the center of the stage makes me tense... it is necessary to stand with your neck and back straight, so that everyone (who came to the concert) can have fun.""  
  
""I wonder if a dress as gorgeous as this can hide the thing deep within me... ""

""The night... Is kind... It can hide the thing one wishes to remain hidden under the veil of darkness...""

""As much as I want to gaze the everchanging moon with you every night... Full moon carries the risk of awakening **her**...""

""At night, my body melts into the darkness... let me use my singing to tell you my whereabouts.""

""The sun is getting stronger... I want to rest in a cool place, just a bit.""

""Good morning... seeing you this early in the morning, I can feel the darkness in my heart driven away.""

""I prefer to start cleaning in the morning. Starting the day like this, it also feels like my heart is getting cleansed...""

The Chinese fan translation I'm using for this post is from this video: [https://www.bilibili.com/video/BV1QreoznEWC/?share\_source=copy\_web&vd\_source=ae1826775b998118ebe5ecca8f678e46](https://www.bilibili.com/video/BV1QreoznEWC/?share_source=copy_web&vd_source=ae1826775b998118ebe5ecca8f678e46)

If you can't tell already, Still In Love is a nice girl who has her dorky and caring sides beyond her aggressive behaviors. ~~She might also be a vampire~~. If there are enough people interested in my shoddy work, I can consider translating a short event or two because they really bring out her character. Hopefully after more JP players have read her story, we will get more fanarts that don't focus on her ""passionate"" side.",19,1756146321.0,UmaMusume,5,0.95,False

I’m looking for something light and genuine — a simple coffee date, good conversation, and just seeing where things flow naturally.

I love exploring cozy cafés around the city, long walks with good company, and the little things that make moments memorable. Romance for me isn’t about grand gestures but about enjoying someone’s presence and creating an easy, warm connection.

If you’re someone who appreciates slow mornings, deep chats (with a sprinkle of playful banter), and believes that a casual date can still feel special, I’d love to meet you over coffee sometime.

1mzych6,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1mzych6,SOS- How do I tie my living room together?,"As the title says, i’m in desperate need of advice in regard to styling/decorating my living room space. This is an area that’s used daily, and because of that I’ve been trying to figure out how to make it functional (2 small kids) but also cozy at the same time. I think I took “cozy” too literal and went full sad beige. 

Is there a way to add color and make it more inviting while still staying cozy, without undoing everything done? Our couch, rug, and white bookshelf are all new. The wall color is unfortunately here to stay, it’s the only color that matches our hideous kitchen cabinets (open concept). 

I was thinking of adding a coffee table, side table, and sofa table behind the couch but i’m not sure what colors/wood tones to go with to tie everything together? As for the empty space above the dog bed….Im struggling to fill it. 

Any and all is very appreciated!",1,1756146104.0,interiordecorating,7,0.67,False

1mzybk7,https://www.reddit.com/r/SoundTried/comments/1mzybk7/explore_the_best_mini_food_processor_cuisinart/,Explore the Best Mini Food Processor Cuisinart DLC-2APK Review Worth It,"A strong contender in the realm of small kitchen appliances, the Cuisinart DLC-2APK Mini-Prep Plus Food Processor has quickly become a staple in my culinary routine. Compact yet powerful, it offers an efficient 250-watt motor, making it the perfect companion for tackling small preparation jobs. Whether you're chopping delicate herbs or grinding harder ingredients like cheese, it handles both tasks with ease. Its vibrant pink color adds a cheerful pop to my countertop, and its lightweight body makes it incredibly easy to store away when not in use.

**Design that Marries Functionality and Aesthetics**  
At just 9 inches high and with a lightweight design, it's clear that this food processor was made with user convenience in mind. The 24-ounce work bowl is just right for smaller tasks, eliminating the need for my larger, clunkier food processor. The bright pink color was a hit with my niece, who proclaimed it ""super cute,"" and I have to agree. It's not often that a kitchen gadget can combine efficiency with style, but this one manages to do just that. The auto-reversing blade is a revelation—chop on one side, grind on the other—giving it a versatility that punches above its weight.  

**Positives**  
- Compact design saves counter space.  
- Auto-reversing SmartPower blade handles soft and hard ingredients efficiently.  
- Dishwasher-safe bowl and lid make cleanup a breeze.  

[Check Cuisinart DLC-2APK price on Amazon.](https://gogeary.com/p/b000tvqvb2/)

**Performance that Impresses on All Fronts**  
This might be a mini food processor, but its performance is far from small. Using the chop button to prep vegetables for a quick stir fry or the grind function to create breadcrumbs has been seamless. While I initially questioned how much power a device of this size could pack, its 250-watt motor answered that question immediately. My coworker even borrowed mine after her larger food processor suddenly gave out, and she was equally impressed by how much this compact machine could manage.  

**Ease of Use: A Standout Feature**  
The push-button control panel is straightforward, with clearly marked ""chop"" and ""grind"" functions. As someone who values efficiency in the kitchen, I appreciate how intuitive it is—no struggling with unnecessary settings or confusing instructions. There’s even a spatula included, which is handy for scooping out mixtures without waste. Of course, the dishwasher-safe components are a game-changer. I love not having to hand-wash everything except for the stainless steel blade, which does require more care to maintain its edge.  

**Areas of Concern**  
While I’ve been thrilled with its overall performance, there are a few points to keep in mind:  
- Limited capacity is strictly for small-batch tasks.  
- Blade is sharp but requires hand-washing, which could be inconvenient for some.  
- Not suitable for grinding harder foods like coffee beans, as noted in the manual.  

**Other Options in the Market**  
When comparing this food processor to others like the KitchenAid Mini Food Processor or the Ninja Express Chop, the strengths become clear. The reversible blade feature feels unique to this model and offers more control over the consistency of your results. However, the Ninja offers a slightly larger capacity at a similar price point, making it more suitable for those who need to tackle slightly bigger tasks. KitchenAid, on the other hand, is known for its robust build, but it doesn't offer the same level of precision when switching between chopping and grinding.  

**Cost-Effectiveness: Is It Worth It?**  
Given its performance, design, and versatility, this little machine offers excellent value for what it promises to do. Admittedly, it's not the cheapest option out there, but it’s a long-term investment for kitchens that need small but reliable help. If you're someone like me who often prepares small-batch recipes or wants something easier to handle than a full-sized food processor, this is well worth considering.

I tested every AI agent tool on the market. ChatGPT, Claude, Genpark, Minimax, Abacus, NotebookLM.

None of them came close to what Skywork AI delivered.

Here's why Skywork AI is crushing the competition and why switching might be the smartest business decision you make this year...

# Why Skywork AI Destroys ChatGPT for Real Business Work

ChatGPT hallucinates. It makes stuff up. Creates fake statistics. Invents fake sources.

Skywork AI verifies everything. 30+ real sources. Academic databases. Verified research. No hallucinations.

I asked ChatGPT to research AI market trends. It gave me impressive-sounding statistics that were completely fake.

I asked Skywork AI the same question. It gave me verified data from Stanford, IBM, and Science Direct. Real sources I could verify.

When your business reputation depends on accurate information, Skywork AI wins every time.

# The Skywork AI vs Genpark Battle (It's Not Even Close)

Genpark looks impressive at first. Nice interface, decent results for basic tasks.

But Genpark hits limits fast. Complex research breaks it. Multi-step projects confuse it. Credit system is messy.

Skywork AI handles complexity like a professional researcher. Deep research mode with 30+ sources. Multiple simultaneous projects. Transparent credit pricing.

I tested both on the same research project. Genpark gave me 6 sources and basic analysis. Skywork AI delivered 30 sources with charts, graphs, and professional formatting.

For serious business use, there's no contest. Skywork AI demolishes Genpark.

# Why Skywork AI Makes Minimax Look Like Amateur Hour

Minimax has potential but terrible execution. The credit system is a nightmare. Everything costs credits but you never know how many until after you've started.

Skywork AI tells you exactly what each project will cost before you begin. No surprises. No budget blowouts.

Minimax also limits you to simple tasks. Try anything complex and it crashes or gives garbage results.

Skywork AI thrives on complex projects. Research reports, presentations, podcasts, web pages. All professional quality.

I cancelled my Minimax subscription after one week. Been using Skywork AI for months with zero complaints.

# The Abacus vs Skywork AI Disaster (Spoiler: Abacus Lost Badly)

Abacus breaks constantly. I'm not exaggerating. Every single project I tried crashed at least once.

Error messages, failed uploads, corrupted outputs. Using Abacus feels like beta testing broken software.

Skywork AI just works. Reliable outputs, stable performance, professional results every time.

Business owners need tools they can depend on. Abacus ain't it. Skywork AI is.

# How Skywork AI Crushes NotebookLM for Content Creation

NotebookLM creates decent podcasts but everyone uses the same voices. Your content sounds generic.

Skywork AI offers unique voices for podcasts. Plus presentations, research reports, web pages, videos. Everything NotebookLM can't do.

NotebookLM is a one-trick pony. Skywork AI is a complete content creation and research powerhouse.

When you need more than basic podcast generation, Skywork AI delivers what NotebookLM can't.

# The Skywork AI Open Source Advantage That Kills Proprietary Tools

Most AI tools lock you into their ecosystem. Proprietary code, closed systems, no control over your data.

Skywork AI is open source. You can run it locally, modify it, integrate it with your existing systems.

Business data stays on your servers. No privacy concerns. No vendor lock-in. Complete control.

For enterprises handling sensitive information, this advantage is massive. Skywork AI gives you AI power without security risks.

# Why Skywork AI Research Quality Beats Every Competitor

I tested the same research prompt across 8 different AI tools. The results shocked me.

ChatGPT: 0 verified sources (all hallucinated) Claude: 3 basic sources, shallow analysis  
Genpark: 6 sources, decent formatting NotebookLM: Can't do research reports Abacus: Crashed twice, never finished Minimax: 4 sources, expensive credits Skywork AI: 30 verified sources, professional analysis, charts and graphs

Skywork AI research quality isn't just better. It's in a different league entirely.

# The Skywork AI Speed Advantage That Embarrasses Slower Tools

Speed matters in business. While competitors crawl, Skywork AI sprints.

ChatGPT takes forever for complex tasks. Claude is decent but limited. Other tools crash under pressure.

Skywork AI handles multiple complex projects simultaneously. Research reports finish in 60 seconds. Presentations complete while you grab coffee.

I can finish more work in one hour with Skywork AI than my competitors finish in one day with inferior tools.

# How Skywork AI Pricing Destroys Overpriced Competitors

Most AI tools rape your wallet. $50-100+ per month for basic features. Hidden costs everywhere.

Skywork AI offers transparent credit-based pricing. Pay only for what you use. No monthly minimums. No hidden fees.

I spent $200/month on various AI subscriptions before Skywork AI. Now I spend $30/month and get better results.

The cost savings alone justify switching to Skywork AI. The superior results are just bonus value.

# Why Skywork AI Multi-Format Output Kills Single-Purpose Tools

Other AI tools do one thing. ChatGPT for text. NotebookLM for podcasts. Canva for design.

Skywork AI does everything. Research, presentations, podcasts, videos, web pages, spreadsheets. All from one platform.

Instead of juggling 6 different AI subscriptions, I use one Skywork AI account for everything.

Simplified workflow. Lower costs. Better integration between different content types.

# The Skywork AI Business Features That Competitors Don't Have

Knowledge base integration: Upload company documents and Skywork AI uses them for context. Competitors can't do this.

Multiple simultaneous projects: Run research, presentations, and content creation in parallel. Other tools handle one task at a time.

Professional export formats: PowerPoint, PDF, HTML, MP3. Ready for business use immediately. Competitors give you basic text files.

Credit estimation: Know costs before starting projects. Competitors surprise you with bills after the fact.

Open source flexibility: Run locally or in the cloud. Competitors lock you into their systems.

# How Skywork AI Quality Control Beats Competitor Guessing Games

Other AI tools give you output and hope it's accurate. No verification. No source checking. Pure gambling with your business reputation.

Skywork AI shows you exactly where every piece of information comes from. 30+ verified sources. Academic databases. Authoritative research.

You can fact-check everything. Your clients see the source quality. Your reputation stays protected.

Smart business owners don't gamble with accuracy. They use Skywork AI for verified results.

# The Skywork AI Learning Curve That Destroys Complex Competitors

Most AI tools require training. Complicated interfaces. Hidden features. Steep learning curves.

Skywork AI works immediately. Type what you want in plain English. Get professional results instantly.

No tutorials needed. No certification required. No technical expertise demanded.

I was productive with Skywork AI in 15 minutes. Still struggling with competitor tools weeks later.

# Why Skywork AI Enterprise Features Beat Consumer-Grade Competitors

Most AI tools are built for casual users. Limited capabilities. Basic outputs. Consumer-grade results.

Skywork AI delivers enterprise-level capabilities. Professional research reports. Business-ready presentations. Client-worthy deliverables.

When you're competing for million-dollar contracts, you need enterprise tools. Skywork AI provides them. Consumer tools don't.

# The Skywork AI Reliability That Makes Competitors Look Unstable

Reliability separates professional tools from toys.

Abacus crashes constantly. Minimax gives inconsistent results. ChatGPT hallucinates randomly.

Skywork AI delivers consistent, professional output every time. No crashes. No errors. No surprises.

Business owners need tools they can depend on. Skywork AI provides that reliability. Competitors don't.

# How Skywork AI Innovation Leaves Competitors Behind

While competitors focus on basic chat interfaces, Skywork AI innovates constantly.

Sky Reels for infinite video generation. Deep research mode with 30+ sources. Multi-project workflows. Professional export formats.

Skywork AI doesn't just compete with existing tools. It creates entirely new categories of AI capability.

Innovation matters. Skywork AI leads. Others follow.

# The Skywork AI Ecosystem That Integrates Everything Competitors Can't

Most AI tools exist in isolation. Can't connect to other systems. Limited integration options.

Skywork AI connects to everything. MCP tools, web browsing, local file systems, cloud storage, academic databases.

Complete AI ecosystem instead of isolated tools. That's the future of business AI.

# Why Skywork AI User Experience Destroys Clunky Competitors

Great AI tools should be invisible. They should work so smoothly you focus on results, not process.

Skywork AI achieves this. Clean interface, intuitive workflows, immediate results.

Competitors feel clunky. Complicated interfaces. Confusing options. Frustrating user experiences.

When you're trying to get work done, user experience matters. Skywork AI gets out of your way and lets you focus on business results.

# The Skywork AI Support System That Competitors Can't Match

Open source means global community support. Thousands of developers improving Skywork AI constantly.

Closed competitors rely on small internal teams. Limited innovation. Slow bug fixes. Minimal feature development.

Community-driven development moves faster and serves users better than corporate development teams.

# Skywork AI vs Competitors FAQs

**Q: How does Skywork AI compare to ChatGPT for business use?** A: Skywork AI verifies sources and provides 30+ references. ChatGPT often hallucinates fake information. For business reputation, verification matters.

# The Bottom Line on Skywork AI vs Competitors

The AI tool landscape just got simple. There's Skywork AI. Then there's everything else.

Other tools might work for basic tasks. Skywork AI dominates for serious business applications.

Verified research instead of hallucinations. Professional outputs instead of basic text. Multiple capabilities instead of single features.

Your competition is still using inferior AI tools. They're getting inferior results.

Switch to Skywork AI and leave them behind permanently.

The gap between Skywork AI and competitors isn't shrinking. It's growing wider every day.

Stop settling for inferior AI tools. Start dominating with Skywork AI capabilities that make competition irrelevant.

Ready to leave your competitors in the dust? Skywork AI is the weapon they don't know exists yet.

The businesses using Skywork AI are already winning. The ones stuck with inferior tools are already losing.

That’s what I’m hoping to find here — a genuine female friend or two who enjoys sharing life back and forth.

A few things about me: I’m curious by nature and a little nerdy. I love sci-fi (Star Wars, Stargate), fantasy, true crime, stargazing, world mysteries, and ancient cultures like Egypt and the Mayans. Writing is a huge part of my life — mostly fanfiction, but I’m also working on my own novel. I’m creative in other ways too: photography, graphic design, and music (anything from 80s to EDM to K-pop without shame).

When I’m not creating, I’m probably out hiking, biking, or swimming, or else in full cozy mode: three cats piled on top of me, too many candles burning, a blanket fortress, snow outside the window, tea or coffee in hand, and a good book nearby. I love autumn and winter, Halloween and Christmas, and traveling — Greece has been my favorite, and I dream of seeing Egypt and Asia (Japan, Thailand, South Korea, China).

I believe in kindness, karma, and friendships where both people share. If you like talking, asking questions, laughing, and swapping stories, I think we’ll get along well.

Oh — and since it matters: I’m married and not looking for romance. Just friendship.

  THE CHESAPEAKE BAY is America’s largest estuary. Nearly two hundred miles long, its watershed covers an area of sixty-five thousand utopian square miles with more than a hundred and fifty rivers and streams barreling into it. It’s also the home of myriad bird and aquatic life, and a haven for legions of recreational boaters. The bay is indeed a creation of remarkable beauty, except when you happen to be swimming in the middle of the damn thing during a thunderstorm in the veiled darkness of early morning.  
  
  Oliver Stone cracked the surface of the water and gulped in the thick salty air, a thirsty man in the center of a trillion-ton ocean. The long dive had caused him to go farther down than was particularly healthy. Yet when you throw yourself off a thirty-foot cliff into an angry ocean, you should be thankful just to have a heartbeat. As he treaded water he looked around to gauge his bearings. Nothing he saw was too appealing right now. With each streak of lightning sparking to earth, he eyed the three-story-high cliff he’d been standing on. He’d been in the bay less than a minute yet the chill was already drizzling into his bones despite the full-body wet suit he wore underneath his clothes. He stripped off his waterlogged pants, shirt and shoes and then kicked off swimming east. He didn’t have much time to get this done.  
  
  Twenty minutes later he cut toward shore, all four limbs cement. He used to be able to swim all day, but he wasn’t twenty anymore. Hell, he wasn’t even fifty anymore. Now he just wanted land; he was tired of impersonating a fish.  
  
  He pointed himself at a cleft in the rock and shot toward it. He slogged free of the breakers and jogged toward a large boulder where he snagged the cloth bag he’d previously hidden. Tugging off his wet suit, he toweled dry and changed into fresh clothes and a pair of tennis shoes. The sodden articles were pushed into the bag, tied to a rock and hurled into the storm-swept bay where they’d join his decades-old sniper rifle and long-range scope. He was officially retired from the killing profession. He hoped he would live to enjoy the experience. Right now it was barely even money on that score.  
  
  Stone carefully picked his way up the rocky path to a dirt trail. Ten minutes later he reached a fringe of woods where shallow-rooted pines leaned away from the punishing sea wind. A twenty-minute jog after that carried him to the batch of ramshackle buildings, most closer to falling down than not. The cloud-encrusted light was just beginning to topple the darkness as he slid through the window of the smallest hut. It was no more than a lean-to, really, though it did have such luxuries as a door and a floor. He checked his watch. He had ten minutes at most. Already dog-tired, he once more pulled off his clothes then slipped into the tiny shower with rusted piping that only delivered a thin stream of lukewarm water, like a fountain on its last dying spurt. Still, he scrubbed hard, wiping away the stink and briny clutch of the angry bay—wiping away evidence, actually. He was on auto now, his mind too numb to lead the way. That would change. The head games were about to start. He could already envision the boots coming for him.  
  
  Stone was listening for the knock on the door; it came as he was dressing.  
  
  “Hey man, you ready?” called the voice. It shot through the thin plywood door like a cat’s paw into a mouse hole.  
  
  In answer Stone smacked one hand hard against the ragged plank floor as he slipped on his shoes, shrugged into a frayed coat, tugged a John Deere cap low over his head and put on his thick glasses. He ran a hand over the bristly gray beard he’d grown over the past six months, then opened the door and nodded at the short, squat man facing him. The fellow had a beer keg frame and a lazy right eye along with teeth yellowed by too many Winstons and double-pop Maxwell House coffees. This was clearly not café latte land. The top of his head was covered by a Green Bay Packers knit cap. He wore faded farmer’s bibs, dirty work boots and a threadbare, grease-stained coat along with an easy smile.  
  
  “Cold one this morning,” the man said, rubbing his chunky nose and slipping a lit cigarette from between his lips.  
  
  Tell me about it, Stone thought.  
  
  “But it’s supposed to warm up.” He drank from an official NASCAR tankard of java, letting some dribble down his chin when he pulled it back.  
  
  Stone nodded as his bearded face drooped and his normally attentive eyes grew vacant behind the smudged lenses. As he walked behind the other man Stone’s left leg bent outward with a chicken-wing limp that stooped him into being several inches shorter.  
  
  They were loading an old banged-up, bald-tired Ford F-150 with firewood when the police car and black sedans slid into the driveway, propelling pebbly gravel in all directions like fired BBs. The trim, muscled men who climbed out of the rides wore blue slickers with “FBI” stenciled on the back in gold lettering and pistols with fourteen-round clips in their belt holsters. Three of them walked up to Stone and his buddy, while a chubby uniformed sheriff with polished black boots and a Stetson hustled to catch up.  
  
  “What’s the deal, Virgil?” Green Bay asked the uniform. “Some sonofabitch break outta prison again? I’m telling you, you boys oughta start shooting to kill again and screw the pissant liberals.”  
  
  Virgil shook his head, worry lines rising on his forehead. “No prison. Man’s dead, Leroy.”  
  
  “What man?”  
  
  One of the FBI slickers snapped, “Let me see some ID.”  
  
  Another said, “Where were you and your friend an hour ago?”  
  
  Leroy looked from one Fibbie to the next. Then he stared over at the uniform. “Virgil, what the hell’s going on?”  
  
  “Like I said, a man’s dead. Important man. His name’s—”  
  
  With a slash of his hand, a slicker cut him off. “ID. Now!”  
  
  Leroy quickly slid a thin wallet out of his bib’s pocket and handed over his license. While one of the agents punched the number into a handheld computer he’d slipped from his windbreaker, another agent held out his hand to Stone.  
  
  Stone didn’t move. He just stared back with a vacuous expression, his lips gumming and his bum leg doing an exaggerated deep knee bend. He looked confused, which was all part of the act.  
  
  “He ain’t got no license,” Leroy said. “He ain’t got nothing of nothing. Hell, can’t even talk, just grunts.”  
  
  The FBI agents closed around Stone. “He work for you?”  
  
  “Yessir. Four months now. Good worker, strong back. Don’t ask for much money—room and board is all, really. But he got a bad leg and not too much upstairs. He’s mostly what you call unemployable.”  
  
  The agents looked down at the protruding angle of Stone’s leg then back up at his bespectacled face and bushy beard.  
  
  One of them asked, “What’s your name?”  
  
  Stone grunted and made several jerky motions with his hand, like he was showing off a bastardized martial art for the federal men.  
  
  “Sign language, least I think it is, or some such,” Leroy volunteered wearily. “Don’t know sign language myself so’s I don’t know his real name. Just call him ‘Hey man.’ Then I show him what needs doing. That seems to work. It ain’t like we’re doing heart surgery up here, just throwing shit in a truck mostly.”  
  
  A slicker said, “Tell him to lift up his pants leg on his bum wheel.”  
  
  “What for?”  
  
  “Just tell him!”  
  
  Leroy motioned to Stone to do so by drawing up his own pants leg.  
  
  Stone bent down and, with improvised difficulty, mimicked Leroy’s action.  
  
  The men all stared down at the ugly scar marching across the kneecap.  
  
  “Damn!” said Leroy. “No wonder he can’t walk good.”  
  
  The same FBI slicker motioned with his hand for Stone to roll his pants leg back down. “Okay, fine.”  
  
  Stone never thought he’d be thankful for the old bayonet wound a North Vietnamese soldier  
had given him. It looked a lot worse than it actually was because the surgeon had had to fix Stone up on the floor of the jungle in the middle of an artillery barrage. Understandably the doctor’s hands had not been at their steadiest.  
  
  Sheriff Virgil said, “Leroy and me grew up here together. He was the center and I was the quarterback on the high school football team that won the county championship forty years ago. He’s not riding around killing anybody. And that feller there, easy to see he’s not the sharpshooting type.”  
  
  The FBI agent tossed back Leroy’s license and looked at his fellow feds. “Clean,” he muttered in a disappointed tone.  
  
  “Where you headed?” another slicker said as he glanced at the half-loaded truck.  
  
  “Same place I’m always headed this time of the morning this time of the year. We take us some wood down to folks who ain’t got time to chop their own, and sell it before the cold weather sets in. Then we get down to the marina and work on the boat. Maybe take it out if the seas clear up.”  
  
  “You got a boat?” one agent said sharply.  
  
  Leroy looked over at Virgil with a comical expression. “Yeah, got me a big-ass yacht.” He pointed behind him. “We like to take us a ride in that there Chesapeake Bay and maybe catch us a few crabs. I hear tell they like that shit round these parts.”  
  
  “Cut the crap, Leroy, before you get yourself in trouble,” Virgil said quickly. “This is serious.”  
  
  “I believe it is,” Leroy shot back. “But if a man’s dead, you best not waste any more time jawing with us. ’Cause we ain’t know nuthin’ ’bout nuthin’.”  
  
  “You see anybody pass this way this morning?”  
  
  “Not one car till you folks come tearing up. And we both been up before full light.”  
  
  Stone limped over to the truck and started throwing wood in the cargo bed.  
  
  The agents looked at each other. One of them mumbled, “Let’s roll.”  
  
  A few seconds later they were gone.  
  
  Leroy walked over to the truck and started tossing wood in. “Wonder what man be dead?” he said, really to himself. “Important man, they say. Lot of important men in this world. But they die just like the rest of us. God’s way of making life fair.”  
  
  Stone let out a long, loud grunt.  
  
  Leroy looked over at him and grinned. “Hey man, now that’s the smartest thing I heard all damn morning.”  
  
  When the day’s work was over, Stone pantomimed to Leroy that he was heading on. Leroy seemed to take it well. “Surprised you lasted long as you did. Good luck.” He peeled off a few faded twenties and handed them over. Stone took the money, patted the man’s back and limped off.  
  
  After packing his duffel, Stone set out on foot and hitchhiked to D.C. in the back of a truck, the driver unwilling to let the scruffy Stone ride with him in the warmth of the truck’s cab. Stone didn’t mind. It would give him time to think. And he had a lot to think about. He had just killed two of the most prominent men in the country on the same day, literally hours apart, using the rifle he’d earlier chucked into the ocean before taking the dive off the cliffs.  
  
  The truck dropped him off near the Foggy Bottom area of the capital and Stone set out for his old home at Mt. Zion Cemetery.  
  
  He had a letter to deliver.  
  
  And something to pick up.  
  
  And then it would be time to hit the road.  
  
  His alter ego John Carr was finally dead.  
  
  And the odds were awfully good that Oliver Stone might be right behind him.  
  
  CHAPTER 2  
  
  THE COTTAGE WAS DARK, the cemetery darker still. The only thing visible was the mist of Stone’s exhaled breath as it mingled with cool air. His gaze penetrated to every square inch of the cemetery because he could not afford any screwups now. It was stupid coming here, but loyalty was not a choice he felt, it was a duty. And it was who he was. At least they couldn’t take that away from him.  
  
  He’d waited nearby for about a half hour to see if anything looked strange. His place had been watched for a couple months after he’d abandoned it. He knew this because he’d been watching the watchers. However, after four months of him not being around, they’d given up their sentinel and moved on. That didn’t mean they wouldn’t come back. And after the events of this morning, they probably would. All cops would you tell you that every violently ended life was worth the same level of investigation. Yet the reality was, the more important the victim the more diligent the hunt. And based on that maxim they would be bringing an army on this one.  
  
  Finally satisfied, he crawled underneath the fence at the back of the cemetery and crept to a large headstone. He yanked it over, revealing underneath the small compartment scooped out of the dirt. He took the box hidden there and put it in his duffel bag, then set the stone back in place. He patted the grave marker affectionately. The name of the deceased who lay here had long since been worn away by time. But Stone had researched the people who’d been buried at Mt. Zion and knew that this was the final resting place of one Samuel Washington, a freed slave who’d given his life to help others like him to freedom. He felt a certain kinship with the fellow because in a way Stone knew just what it was like to not be free.  
  
  He eyed the cottage in a dusk rushing headfirst to nightfall. He knew Annabelle Conroy had been staying there. Her rental was parked at the front gate. And he’d been inside the cottage when she’d been absent from it a couple months ago. The place looked far better than when he’d lived there. Yet he knew he could never reside at Mt. Zion again unless it was in a supine position approximately six feet underground. With the two early morning pulls of the trigger he’d become the most wanted man in America.  
  
  He wondered where she was tonight. Hopefully, out enjoying life, although since the news of the two murders was everywhere, he knew that his friends would easily deduce what had happened. He hoped they didn’t think less of him. That actually was the real reason he was here tonight.  
  
  He didn’t want to leave his friends hanging out there for him. The feds weren’t incompetent. They would be coming this way eventually. Stone wished with all his heart he could do more for the Camel Club, after all they had done for him. He had thought of simply turning himself in. But there was such a core of survivor mentality built into his psyche that his essentially walking to his own execution was not an option. He could not let them win that way. They would have to work a little harder.  
  
  The letter he held was carefully worded. It was not a confession because that would put his friends in an even greater dilemma. Granted, Stone was caught in a classic catch-22, but he owed them something. He should have known that with the life he’d led there was only one possible conclusion.  
  
  This.  
  
  He slipped the letter from his pocket and rolled it around the hilt of a knife he pulled from another pocket, securing it with string. He took aim from the darkness of the side yard and let fly. The knife stuck into the porch column.  
  
  “Good-bye.”  
  
  He had one more place to visit.  
  
  A few moments later he was crawling back under the fence. He walked to the Foggy Bottom Metro station and climbed on the train. Later, a thirty-minute walk brought him to yet another cemetery.  
  
  Why was it he was more comfortable with the dead than the living? The answer was relatively simple. The dead conveniently never asked questions.  
  
  Even in the darkness he quickly found the grave he was looking for. He knelt down, brushed some leaves away and gazed at the tombstone.  
  
  Here lay Milton Farb, the other member of the Camel Club, and the only deceased one. Yet even dead, Milton would forever be part of that informal band of conspiracy theorists who’d insisted on only one thing: the truth.  
  
  Too bad their leader hadn’t honored that principle.  
  
  The only reason his beloved friend was dead was because of Stone.  
  
  My fault.  
  
  Because of him, the brilliant if quirky Milton was resting here for all time now, a large-caliber round having ended his life underneath the United States Capitol. It nearly equaled the grief  
Stone felt for the death of his poor wife decades ago.  
  
  Stone’s eyes moistened as he remembered that final, awful night at the Capitol Visitor Center. How Milton had looked at him after the bullet struck; those wide, pleading, innocent eyes. The memory of his friend’s last seconds of life would remain with Stone until his dying day. And there had been nothing Stone could do, except avenge his friend. And he had. He’d killed many heavily armed, expertly trained men in close confines that night, and he hardly remembered doing any of it, so overshadowed was it all by that one stunningly improbable death. Yet it hadn’t come close to making up for the loss. That was what the killings this morning had been about, at least partly. And neither of them had made up for losing Milton either. Or his wife. Or his daughter.  
  
  He very carefully cut out a chunk of grass and dirt on top of his friend’s grave, laid the box in it, and put the grass back on top, pushing it down firmly with a shove from his foot. He removed all evidence that the ground had been disturbed and then stood very erect and saluted his dead friend.  
  
  A few moments later Stone slowly walked back to the Metro and rode it to Union Station, where he bought a train ticket south with most of his remaining cash. There were a few police and plainclothes officers around and Stone duly noted the location of each one. No doubt the heavy artillery was at the three local airports doing their best to nab the killer of a well-known U.S. senator and the nation’s intelligence chief. The lowly American train system obviously didn’t warrant such a level of scrutiny, as though assassins wouldn’t deign to ride the decrepit rails.  
  
  Thirty minutes later he climbed on the Amtrak Crescent, destination New Orleans; it was a spur-of-the-moment decision as he had looked up at the marquee. The train was a few hours late leaving, otherwise he would’ve not been able to take it. Not a naturally superstitious man, he had considered that an omen. He jammed himself into a small bathroom, trimmed off the beard and removed his glasses before going to his seat. He’d heard construction jobs were still plentiful in New Orleans after Katrina. And people, desperate for workers, didn’t ask for tricky things like Social Security numbers and permanent addresses. At this point in his life Stone did not like questions or numbers that would lead anyone to know who he really was. His plan was to lose himself in a mass of humanity trying to rebuild from a nightmare not of its own making. He could relate to that very well, because he was basically trying to do the very same thing. Except for those two final shots. Those he’d intended with every pulsating nerve of anger and sense of justice denied he possessed.  
  
  As the train bumped along in the darkness Stone sat in his chair and stared out the window. In the reflection he studied the young woman who sat next to him holding a baby, her feet perched on a battered duffel bag and a pillowcase crammed with what looked to be bottles, diapers and changes of clothes for the infant. They were both asleep; the child’s chest nestled against its mother’s swollen bosom. Stone turned to look at the child with its triple chins and doughy fists. The baby suddenly opened its eyes and stared at him. Surprisingly it didn’t cry; it didn’t make one sound, in fact.  
  
  Across the aisle a rail-thin man was eating a cheeseburger he’d bought in the station, a bottle of Heineken cradled between bony knees covered by patched denim. Next to him was a young, tall, good-looking man with brown, tousled hair and a few days’ worth of stubble on his unmarked face. He had the lean, lanky build and confident moves of a former high school quarterback not yet run to fat. This was not exactly a guess on Stone’s part, because the kid was wearing his high school varsity jacket dripping with medals, letters and ribbons. The year stitched on the jacket told Stone that the kid had been out of high school for a few years. Long time to be holding on to the glory days, Stone thought, but maybe that was all the kid had.  
  
  To Stone’s eye the young man also had the look of someone who was certain that the world owed him everything and had never bothered paying its bill. As Stone watched, he rose, climbed over the cheeseburger man and headed to the rear of the car and through the door into the next train car.  
  
  Stone reached over and gently touched the baby’s fist, receiving a barely audible coo in return. While the infant’s life was all in front of him, Stone’s was drawing closer to the end.  
  
  Well, they would have to find him first. He owed that to an authority that was often callous to the people who served it with the greatest loyalty, with the most quietly suffered sacrifice.  
  
  He leaned back in his seat and watched Washington disappear as the train rattled on.  
  
  CHAPTER 3  
  
  JOE KNOX HAD BEEN READING in the small library of his town house in northern Virginia when the phone rang. The speaker was economical with his words and Knox, from long experience, did not interrupt. He hung up the phone, laid aside his novel, pulled on his raincoat and boots, grabbed the keys to his scuffed up ten-year-old Range Rover and headed out into the foul weather for an equally foul task.  
  
  An inch over six feet with the thick, muscular build of the undersized linebacker he had once been in college, Knox was in his fifties with thinning hair that he still had barber-shop cut and then slicked back. He also possessed a pair of pale green eyes that were the human equivalent of an MRI: they missed nothing. He gripped the wheel of the Rover with long fingers that had pulled just about every trigger there was while in service to his country. From his secluded, forested neighborhood he turned on to Chain Bridge Road in McLean, Virginia. The traffic would still be heavy on the Beltway this time of morning. Actually, there was really no longer a time when the asphalt noose around the capital city’s neck wasn’t strangled with cars. He pointed his SUV toward the District and backtracked his way to eastern Maryland from there. Eventually he smelled the sea, and with it he envisioned the murder scene. All in a day’s work.  
  
  Three hours later he was walking around the truck as fat raindrops pelted down. Carter Gray still sat in his seat-belt harness, his head destroyed and his life ended by what appeared to be a long-range rifle round, although the postmortem would confirm that. While police, FBI and forensic teams buzzed everywhere like bluebottle flies, looking for some place to land and do their business, Joe Knox squatted in front of the white grave marker and small American flag planted in front of it by the side of the road. It was on a curve. The motorcade would have slowed here. A curious Gray had obviously seen these two items and rolled down his window—a fatal mistake.  
  
  Grave marker and American flag. Just like at Arlington National. An interesting and perhaps telling choice.  
  
  The fact that the windows rolled down showed Knox that the vehicle wasn’t armored. Such vehicles’ windows were phone-book thick and did not move. Gray had made his second mistake there.  
  
  Should’ve asked for the armor, Carter. You were important enough.  
  
  This wasn’t baseball, Knox knew. In his business, it never took more than two strikes to finish you.  
  
  Knox looked off into the distance, tracing in his mind the trajectory of the lethal round. None of the protection detail had seen any sign of a shooter, so he had to cast the potential flight path out farther where the optic and muzzle signatures would be nearly invisible to the naked eye.  
  
  Thousand yards? Fifteen hundred? To a target inside a vehicle revealed only through a barely two-by-two-foot opening in the dark and drizzle. And planted the bullet right in the brain.  
  
  Remarkable shot any way you look at it. No luck there. A pro.  
  
  Revealing again.  
  
  He rose and nodded at one of the uniforms. Knox wore his ID badge on a lanyard around his neck. When everyone had seen what his official ties were they had been deferential and also given him a wide berth, like he had an incurable and contagious disease.  
  
  And maybe I do.  
  
  The cop opened the door of the Escalade and Knox peered inside. The shot had hit dead center of the right temple. There was no exit wound. The round was still in the brain. The postmortem would dig it out. Not that he needed the autopsy report to tell him what had killed the man. Blood and bits of flesh and skull had embedded in parts of the SUV’s interior. Knox doubted the government would be reusing this ride. It would probably go the way of JFK’s limo. It was bad luck, bad karma, call it what you would, but no other VIP would want to rest his butt in the dead man’s seat, sterilized or not.  
  
  Gray didn’t appear as though he were sleeping. He simply looked dead. No one had bothered to close the man’s eyes. His glasses had been blown off on impact from the kinetically energized round. The result had Gray perpetually staring at whoever looked back at him.  
  
  Knox lifted one of his gloved hands and shut the eyelids. It was out of respect. He’d known Gray well. He hadn’t always agreed with the man or his methods, but he’d respected him. If their positions were reversed, he hoped Gray would’ve done the same for him.  
  
  The briefing papers Gray had been reading had been collected already by the CIA. National security trumped even homicide. Knox highly doubted that whatever the CIA chief had been reading at the moment of his death would be connected to his murder, but one never knew.  
  
  Yet if they could have read the man’s mind in his last moments of life? When he stared out at that grave marker and that flag?  
  
  Knox’s gut was telling him that Gray knew exactly who had killed him. And maybe others at the Agency did too. If so, they were letting him go through the motions on his own. He wondered why for a second and then stopped. It was tricky business trying to figure out what the hell went on behind closed doors at Langley. The only thing you could count on as the real truth was as convoluted as anything you’d find in popular fiction.  
  
  He left the corpse and mentally processed the facts as he stared off toward the Atlantic.  
  
  Gray’s home had been blown up over six months ago, the man barely escaping with his life. Knox had been briefed via secure phone on the drive over. Any suspects involved in that matter were not to be considered to be involved in Gray’s murder, he’d been told. This directive had come from the high  
est levels and he had no choice but to defer to it. Yet, still, he filed that away in the back of his head. For him the truth should not come with qualifiers or conditions, if for no other reason than that he might need it as ammo to cover his own ass at some point.  
  
  He drove to Gray’s home, made a brief inspection of the interior, found nothing of interest there, and then walked toward the cliff at the rear of the property. He stared down at the thrashing water of the bay below before glancing out at the fully formed storm front that was not making the nearby murder investigation any easier. Knox eyed the fringe of woods that ran by the right side of the house. He walked through the trees and quickly calculated that a path through here would take one up to the gravel road that Gray’s motorcade had used.  
  
  He looked back at the cliffs.  
  
  And wondered if it was possible.  
  
  With the right man there was only one answer to that question.  
  
  Yes.  
  
  He climbed back in his Rover and headed to the second murder scene.  
  
  Roger Simpson.  
  
  The great state of Alabama was suddenly one senator short.  
  
  And without even seeing the circumstances of Simpson’s death, Knox instinctively knew he was looking for only one killer.  
  
  Just one.  
  
  CHAPTER 4  
  
  AS SOON AS ANNABELLE stepped on the front porch she saw it. Alex Ford did too. They’d just gotten back from dinner at Nathan’s in Georgetown. It had become a favorite haunt of theirs.  
  
  She pulled the knife free, unfolded the letter and then glanced around, as though she expected the person who’d delivered it to still be nearby.  
  
  She and Alex sat in front of the empty fireplace while she read it. She finished and passed it across to him, waiting in silence while he read it through.  
  
  “He says for you to pack up and move. That people would be coming to ask questions. You can stay at my place, if you want.”  
  
  “I guess we knew it was him, didn’t we?” she added.  
  
  Alex looked at the letter. “‘I’ve had many regrets in my life,’” he said, reading from it. “‘And I’ve lived with them all. But Milton’s death was my fault alone. I did what I had to do. To punish those who needed to be. But I will never be able to punish myself enough. At least John Carr is finally dead. And good riddance.’” He looked up. “Sounds like a man who did what he believed needed to be done.”  
  
  “He asked us to tell Reuben and Caleb.”  
  
  “I’ll do it.”  
  
  “They deserved it, you know. From all that Finn told us that happened that night.”  
  
  “Nothing gives someone the right to murder someone, Annabelle,” he said firmly. “That’s vigilantism. That’s wrong.”  
  
  “Under any circumstances?”  
  
  “One exception destroys that rule for good.”  
  
  “So you say.”  
  
  “Burn the letter, Annabelle,” Alex said suddenly.  
  
  “What?”  
  
  “Burn it now, before I change my mind.”  
  
  “Why?”  
  
  “It’s not a confession but it’s still evidence. And I can’t believe I’m saying this. Burn it. Now!”  
  
  She grabbed a match, lit the paper and tossed it into the fireplace. They watched the letter curl and blacken.  
  
  “Oliver saved my life, more than once,” he said. “He was the most decent, reliable person I’ve ever met.”  
  
  “I wish he’d stayed to talk to us.”  
  
  “I’m glad he didn’t.”  
  
  “Why?” Annabelle said brusquely.  
  
  “Because I might have had to arrest him.”  
  
  “You’re kidding. You just said he was the most decent person you’d ever met.”  
  
  “I’m a lawman, Annabelle. I swore an oath, friend or not.”  
  
  “But you knew he killed people before. And you didn’t seem to have a problem with it then.”  
  
  “Right, but he did that on orders from the U.S. government.”  
  
  “So that makes it okay in your eyes? Because some politician said it was?”  
  
  “Oliver was a soldier. He was trained to follow orders.”  
  
  “But even he felt guilt for that. Because some of the people he was ‘ordered’ to kill were innocent. You saw how that crushed him.”  
  
  “I respect his morals. But that wasn’t his call.”  
  
  Annabelle rose and looked down at him.  
  
  “So he kills two people who did deserve it, but because he didn’t have ‘government authorization’ you’re suddenly prepared to arrest him?”  
  
  “It’s not that simple, Annabelle.”  
  
  She flicked her long hair out of her face. “Sure it is,” she snapped.  
  
  “Look—”  
  
  She walked over to the door and opened it. “Let’s call it a night before we say something we’ll regret. Or at least I do. Besides, I have to pack.”  
  
  “Where are you going to go?”  
  
  “I’ll let you know,” she said in a tone that left much doubt whether she meant it.  
  
  Alex started to say something but instead rose and walked out, his features clouded and his lips set in an uncompromising line.  
  
  Annabelle slammed the door behind him. She sat down cross-legged in front of the fireplace and studied the blackened bits of Stone’s final message to them. Tears trickled down her cheeks as in her mind she went through the letter’s contents again.  
  
  She glanced toward the door. Alex and she had become very close over the last several months. When they had heard of Gray’s and Simpson’s murders they both had instantly suspected the truth. Yet they hadn’t said anything about their feelings, afraid perhaps that if they did acknowledge that they believed Stone had killed the two men it would make that suspicion an intractable truth. Now their two very different interpretations of the man’s perceived actions had just driven a wall right between them.  
  
  Annabelle packed her few belongings, locked up the cottage for what she was sure would be the last time, climbed in her car and drove to a nearby hotel. She got undressed and climbed into bed. She would be moving on now. There was nothing to keep her here any longer. With Oliver gone, her father dead and Alex revealed to be something other than what she thought, she was alone once more.  
  
  It seemed to be her natural state.  
  
  Good luck, Oliver Stone.  
  
  Annabelle was very sure of one thing. He would need all the luck he could get.  
  
  Maybe they all would.  
  
  CHAPTER 5  
  
  JOE KNOX WOULD HAVE preferred to have been back at his town house drinking a beer or maybe even a couple digits’ width of Glenlivet while sitting in front of a toasty fire and finishing reading his novel. Yet here he was. The chair was uncomfortable, the room cold and ill-lighted, the waiting unpleasant. He eyed the opposite wall but his thoughts were far from this place.  
  
  His tour through Roger Simpson’s murder scene hadn’t taken all that long. Like his former boss at CIA, Simpson had still been sitting in death, only with him instead of a car seat it was a ladder-back chair in the kitchen that was now all mottled with the dead man’s blood. The shot had come from the unfinished chunk of construction across the street. The hour of execution—for Knox was certain that’s what this was all about—had been an early one. And eyewitnesses had been in damn short supply.  
  
  The only item of interest, really, had been the newspaper. Simpson had been shot right through that morning’s edition of the venerable Washington Post, taking the round smack in the chest. As had been the case with Gray, most snipers aimed for the brain as the gold standard of all possible killing shots. Sure, you pack the right ordnance and a torso hit would also likely be fatal, but the head shot was like a faithful dog in a professional killer’s world because it just never let you down.  
  
  So Gray in the head; Simpson in the chest. Why?  
  
  And why through the newspaper?  
  
  That had really bothered Knox. Not that having to penetrate the few pages would’ve screwed the shot, but the shooter would’ve had to more or less guess where his round would impact. And what if Simpson had had a thick book on his chest, or a  
cigarette lighter in his breast pocket that the paper had concealed? That could’ve fouled the shot. Most snipers Knox had known didn’t like to guess about anything other than who they’d kill next.  
  
  Yet when he’d examined the paper he understood quite clearly why the chest shot had been used. A snapshot of someone had been taped to the inside of the newspaper. The shot had taken the person’s head in the photo right off. As Knox looked more closely, the remaining part of the picture showed the torso to be that of a woman. There were no marks or writing on what was left of the photo to help him figure out who it was. He’d talked to the paper carrier to see if he’d seen anything suspicious, but he hadn’t. And Simpson’s building didn’t have a doorman. Yet the killer had put that photo in the paper, Knox was certain of it.  
  
  And that meant only one thing. This hit had been personal. And the killer had wanted Simpson to know exactly why he was going to die and also who was doing the deed. Just like the flag and grave marker with Gray. His grudging admiration for the assassin increased even more.

1mzy8kv,https://www.reddit.com/r/gratitude/comments/1mzy8kv/grateful_for_a_ride_from_a_stanger_when_running/,"Grateful For a Ride From a Stanger When Running Late, urgent effort to get assistance (cell phone bus schedule info) after bus cancelled and Needed ~ Grateful for the Kindness, the Offer and the Ride, was lovely conversation and perhaps potential friend 🌟🌼","Last Friday I was needing to get somewhere by 12:15 P.M. with cut off close time of 12:30.

In my city, you cannot count on the buses. It is becoming rare for them to follow a schedule-often running late or not at all. 

One day I waited 1 hour for a bus and when it arrived and I told the driver, he mentioned that of the other bus that travels across town...out of 10 of them- 6 were pulled off the road due to not enough drivers that day. I asked if they know in the morning when they call in, why is it not posted on the web site, but he did not know why they could not manage that level of customer service or valuing those in the community they serve.

I have more of a problem than others as I have never owned a cell phone in my life and there are no longer any paper schedules available on the buses, just need a cell phone app to know where the bus travels, where there is a stop, if it is late, if it is cancelled.

Thats the back story.

So I am at the Tims coffee shop walking through and I see someone in the drive through with a cell - tell them how there is no bus and ask if they can check their cell.

To my surprise, the lady in the car behind her was able to hear me ! Was super shocked at her level of hearing, completely.

She carved her car wheels hard and pulled to her left to pull out of the drive through coffee line, as she called out - ""I'll drive you""!

I was so surprised. I got in, then she got a call and said she had to stop at home which put me at risk of being late, but it all worked out, I got there a few moments late and all was well.... but in the meantime, I had met a super nice person, had a lovely enjoyable conversation, got sat to wait in her back yard deck with a cold juice.

Was grateful to have met someone nice, caring, helpful that still extends themselves and treats people as I do.

Was grateful for the trust, the little visit, the exchange of phone numbers, and a potential friend perhaps ( she may be putting her energy and time though to a rocky hurtful partnership as her focus though at present, so not sure if it will happen ).

Was grateful I was able to get to where I needed and to connect with the people there, was enjoyable and always a boost to my well being.

Just really grateful to see kindness, empathy, care in a fellow human.

Grateful that when surrounded by coldness, callousness, lack of care, selfishness, people going out of their way to be cruel/mindless/make others day and life harder and losing faith in humanity............. that rare gems, people like this still exist. THANK GOD for that.

Now adays any time you encounter anyone kind, genuine, caring, offering a hand up....that is a reason to be COMPLETELY GRATEFUL.

GOT TO BE GRATEFUL FOR THAT FOR SURE ! ",6,1756145853.0,gratitude,1,1.0,False
1mzy7ph,https://www.reddit.com/r/TrueOffMyChest/comments/1mzy7ph/was_this_date_inappropriate/,Was this date inappropriate??,"My best friend Tanya (25F) recently went out with a guy named Anthony (25M), who is in a relationship with a girl named Suzy. Tanya and Anthony became close because of her ex-boyfriend, they all used to go on double dates together: Tanya and her ex, and Anthony and Suzy.

This summer, Tanya and her boyfriend broke up. Since then, Anthony has been checking in on her and being there for her emotionally. On Saturday, Anthony invited Tanya to a movie, telling her that his friend John couldn’t make it and asked if she wanted to come instead. Suzy was working that night.

At first, it didn’t seem like a big deal until Tanya gave me the details of their night:
* Anthony picked her up in one of his “nicer” cars.
* He brought a backup crisp button-down shirt in case she was dressed up.
* He took her to a dimly lit Italian restaurant where they talked for a while. He paid.
* Then they went to the movie (he had already bought the tickets in advance).
* After the 3-hour movie, they went to a cafe for coffee and talked for another hour.
* Then he drove her home.

While she was telling me all this, she was giggling and clearly excited about the night. I said, “That sounds like a romantic date,” and she got defensive. She said, “Nothing happened! I don’t even like him like that.”
I told her that whether she likes him or not, it still felt inappropriate and disrespectful to his girlfriend, Suzy. Especially because Anthony has been getting closer to Tanya emotionally since her breakup and strangely, he didn’t bring up her ex-boyfriend at all during the night, even though that’s usually what they talk about. That made it feel even more like a planned, romantic evening, rather than a friendly hangout.

I said that if I were Suzy, I’d feel completely disrespected by my boyfriend spending a long, intimate night like that with another woman especially one he's gotten close to during a vulnerable time. Tanya insists it wasn’t like that and that I’m overthinking everything.
I didn’t mean to upset her, but the whole thing just made me uncomfortable. I told her how I felt, and now she’s annoyed with me for “making it weird.”

Was I wrong for calling out the night as inappropriate and saying it crossed boundaries? What are your thoughts.",27,1756145797.0,TrueOffMyChest,9,0.87,False

1mzy78z,https://i.redd.it/j7h6th3m97lf1.png,A tierlist based on how much the characters like tea,"Well, it was quite a lot of work. I tried to check all sources, from plot dialogues and character tories to event dialogues, birthday letters and in-game books. However, I am 100% sure that there are many characters who were unfairly included in the bottom line. I am not a superhuman, and I did it all alone. And reading absolutely ALL the dialogues, including events, was too much for me :) But I read a lot, honestly! And I am not very attentive, even though I tried to be. When compiling the tier list, I assumed that the characters drink and talk about tea not against their will, but because they like this drink. In the top category, I put characters who have more than just a mention of drinking tea. Just below are all the characters who have ever drunk tea or had intentions to do so. Even lower are those who most likely drink tea, although the arguments are only indirect. (however, the distribution between the top two tiers is quite transparent.)

It was interesting, and quite long. I spent more than a week with this tier list. I say again that I am sure that I missed someone, do not hit with sticks and stones. Write if anything, I will review and reread. Thank you!

Below I have provided an overview of all the characters in the top three lines of the tier list. Here you can learn about specific interactions of the character with tea, and in what parts of the game this happened.

  
**Lumine/Aether**. In the new event with Yelan skin, we go to the teahouse ourselves for green tea. I'm sure there are many more examples with the main character, but I haven't explored further. Either way, I'm sure I can't put them higher.

**Jean**. Lisa invited her to have tea, but she refused. Given their close relationship, I think Jean definitely had opportunities to have tea with Lisa, but I wouldn't dare say for sure. \[Second Jean's Story\]

**Lisa**. She created a special advanced cauldron and brews tea in it (I want to go to Lisa's library😭). She also drank tea called ""Love Poem"" in the event - it's black tea with milk and caramel. \[Lisa's story about the cauldron. Event ""Of Drink A-Dreaming"" 2.5\]

**Noelle** and **Barbara**. Drinking tea together. \[Noelle's line about Barbara\]

**Rosaria**. Drinks tea and admits that she prefers stronger drinks. However, she really liked the tea and it reminded her of old times and Barbara's care. \[Event ""Of Drink A-Dreaming"" 2.5\]

**Ningguang**. I put her in a higher rank because her statement ""excellent tea"" indicates that she knows tea in my opinion. She also wants to invite Xianyun for tea. \[Ningguang's lines about Shenhe and Xianyun\]

**Zhongli**. A pedant even in tea. Tried tea from Fontaine, prefers stronger tea, places emphasis on the quality of water and tea accessories. \[""Zhongli: Time for Tea"" - story of the event 5.4 ""Travelers' Tales: Anthology Chapter"". Event ""Of Drink A-Dreaming"" 2.5\]

**Ganyu**. Usually drinks calming tea in the Yuehai Pavilion. \[Ganyu's birthday letter 2022\]

**Bennett**. Spilled tea on the letter. Presumably he drank it. \[Bennett's birthday letter 2025\]

**Keqing**. Often brews qingxin flower tea. \[Keqing's bithday letter 2021\]

**Hu Tao**. Invites us for tea. It seems like there is a line from some event that points to her love for tea, but I couldn't find it. \[Hu Tao's second line\]

**Beidou**. Drinking fruit tea in the event. \[Event ""Of Drink A-Dreaming"" 2.5\]

**Eula**, **Collei**, and **Kokomi**. Drinking tea together in an event. In the same event, Collei admits that she prefers coffee. \[Event ""Secret Summer Paradise"" 3.8\]

**Ayaka**. Loves chazuke, a dish that includes green tea. Participates in tea ceremonies. Fun fact: uses tea leaves to tell love <3. It is also said that the Kamisato clan brews exquisite teas, so I dare to assume that Ayaka understands tea and put her one line higher. Offers us matcha of her own making. \[Ayaka's stories 3 and 4. Ayaka's line about her favorite food. Ayaka's lines in the teapot of serenity\]

**Yoimiya**. Drinking tea with guests and grannies. Cool girl! \[Yoimiya's story 2\]

**Raiden**. This is a bit of a controversial point. We all know that Raiden loves dango. It may include tea, but it doesn't have to - it depends on the type of dango. Also, in the book written by Yae Miko ""Pretty Please, Kitsune Guuji?"", in which Raiden and Yae herself became the prototypes of the characters, Raiden drinks tea with milk. This may suggest that the original version also likes tea. \[Book ""Pretty Please, Kitsune Guuji?"". Raiden Ei's LQ\]

**Yun Jin**. Having tried all the most exquisite varieties of tea, she is afraid that there will be nothing new left for her. \[Yun Jin's line about drinks\]

**Ayato**. He loves tea with milk, often drinks it in animations. Also remember that the Kamisato clan brews exquisite teas. \[Ayato's line about his favorite food. Ayaka's story 3\]

**Yelan**. Invites us for tea twice. Says that she has a lot of tea. Also offers to talk over a cup of tea in the teapot of serenity. She really loves to drink tea with a traveler... She also brews tea leaves with jueyun сhili and violetgrass, she loves this drink more than coffee and alcohol. I myself didn't think that she loved tea so much, now I will love this woman even more <3 \[Yelan's birthday letters 2023 and 2024. Yelan's lines in the teapot of serenity. Yelan's line about her favorite food\]

**Candace**. Loves to drink hot tea at night while looking at the village. \[Official post for Candace's birthday 2024\]

**Dehya**. Praised the tea of ​​Qiaoying village. \[Dialogue with Candace in the event ""Springtime Charms"" 5.3\]

**Wanderer**. I was very surprised, but tea is his favorite food. He likes the MOST bitter tea possible. \[Wanderer's line about favorite food\]

**Lynette**. I was shocked, her ENTIRE third story was about TEA! Like, really, the whole thing, not a mention, not a phrase, but the ENTIRE story! Now I have to level her up to level 90... I always liked this cat :3 In the animations she also drinks tea, and her special dish is tea, she is a professional in brewing tea. \[Lynette's story 3. Lynette's line ""Something to Share""\] (I think (no, I'm SURE) there are more references to Lynette's love for tea, but I haven't looked for)

**Baizhu**. Likes green tea. \[Baizhu's story 3\]

**Freminet**. Lynette pours him tea. \[Freminet's official intoduction version 2\]

**Neuvillette**. There is a very interesting situation in the line ""Good afternoon"", since the meaning changes depending on the language, and I thought for a long time where to put Neuvillette between the lower and penultimate categories, spent about 20 minutes studying the features of English and Chinese. And then I found in the birthday letter that Neuvillette just drinks tea... And he gave most of his tea to Wriothesley. \[Neuvillette's line ""Good afternoon"". Neuvillette's birthday letter 2024\]

**Wriothesley**. Well..)) You know it yourself, but let me tell you. He likes to throw 2 sugar cubes into his tea, drinks it with sweets. He accepted a gift from Neuvillette and Clorinde in the event. He will also drink tea inside the teapot of serenity. He constantly gifts tea to Furina. In Fontaine's storyline, he also offered Clorinde tea to drink. \[Wrio's lines. Event ""Vibrant Harriers Aloft in Spring Breeze"" 4.4. Wrio's ""Character Details""\]

**Furina**. Wants to invite Clorinde to tea, calls Wrio's tea ""exquisite!"" And in general, she knows a lot about tea parties, she often says this one line, running around the world. Invites us to tea too. \[Furina's lines about Clorinde, Wrio, tea party. Letter for Furina's birthday 2024\]

**Navia**. Loves a calming tea with a little milk. \[Navia's line on the end of the ascension\]

**Xianyun**. Offers to brew tea for conversation. \[Line ""More About Xianyun: I""\]

**Kazuha**. Invites us to drink tea and read poems. \[Dialogue in the teapot of serenity with the favorite set of furniture\]

**Gaming**. Will drink tea in the teapot of serenity and offer it to us. In the event, he also invited us for tea. \[Dialogues of the teapot of serenity. Event ""Vibrant Harriers Aloft in Spring Breeze"" 4.4\]

**Clorinde**. Before, when Furina was playing the role of the Archon, she stood behind her while she drank tea. But now she drinks tea with her. \[Clorinde's line about Furina\] (In fact, I'm sure she drank tea with wrio somewhere, but I couldn't find any confirmation of this)

**Sigewinne**. She often makes various medicinal teas, and I dare say she drinks some of them herself.

**Lan Yan**. Drinks a cup of tea every morning, walks through the tea fields. Likes tea with flower petals. \[Lan Yan's story 5. Lan Yan's line about favorite food\]

**Varesa**. Likes fruit tea. \[Varesa's default costume description\] (damn, I didn't know costumes had descriptions, moreover default ones)

**Escoffier**. ""Joining her for a spot of afternoon tea is much like opening a surprise gift — there is always something new and unexpected in store."" Escoffier herself always invites Navia for tea. \[Escoffier's ""Character Details"". Escoffier's line about Navia\]

**Arlecchino**. Enjoying tea with family \[Arlecchino's birthday letter 2025\]

**Lyney**. Invites us for ""the most wonderful afternoon tea!"" at the Café Lutece. Besides, I doubt Lynette's brother can not like tea. \[Lyney's comment about Navia\]",73,1756145771.0,Genshin_Impact,26,0.96,False

  Pagan  
  
  I’d just turned around to watch the pretty balloons. I liked the pink one best. It reminded me of bubblegum. I’d been trying to think of something I could promise Mommy I’d do if she’d buy me one. Maybe clean out from under my bed or maybe straighten the shoes in her closet. But it had only been a second that I’d stopped and thought about it. Now, my mommy was gone. Tears clouded my vision and I let out a panicked sob. She’d warned me I could get lost in the crowd if I didn’t keep up. Normally I held her hand when we were in crowds but today she was carrying an armload of her books. It had been my responsibility not to lose her. But I had. Where would I sleep? I glanced nervously around at the people covering the busy streets. The Arts and Entertainment Festival had brought people from all over to our small town. Reaching up to wipe my eyes so I could find a police officer to help me, I sniffled and for a second forgot my crisis when the smell of funnel cake reached me.  
  
  “Don’t cry, I’ll help you.”  
  
  Frowning, I studied the boy in front of me. His blond hair was cut short and his big friendly eyes looked concerned. I had never seen him before. He didn’t go to my school. Maybe he was a tourist. Whoever he was, I knew he couldn’t help me. He was just a kid too.  
  
  “I lost my mommy,” I muttered, feeling embarrassed that he’d caught me crying.  
  
  He nodded then held out his hand. “I know. I’m going to take you back to her. It’s okay, I promise.”  
  
  Swallowing the lump in my throat, I thought about his offer. Could he help me? Two sets of eyes looking for a police officer were better than one, I guess.“Um, if you could just help me look for a police officer so he could find her that would be nice.”  
  
  He smiled at me like he thought I was funny. I hadn’t been joking and nothing about this was cause to smile.  
  
  “I really know where she is. Trust me,” his hand was still outstretched toward me. Frowning, I thought about all the reasons this was probably a bad idea. He couldn’t be much older than me. Maybe he was like seven at the most. But he seemed so sure of himself. Besides, he wasn’t an adult stranger. He wouldn’t kidnap me.  
  
  “Okay,” I finally replied, slipping my hand in his. His face appeared to relax. I sure hoped he didn’t get us both lost.  
  
  “Where are your parents?” I asked, suddenly realizing maybe they could help.  
  
  “Around here somewhere,” he replied and a small frown touched his forehead. “Come with me,” his voice was gentle but firm. He kind of reminded me of an adult.  
  
  I kept up with him as he wove a path through the bodies in our way. I tried to glance up at people as we hurried by to see if I recognized anyone but I wasn’t having any luck.  
  
  “There she is,” the boy said as he stopped our pursuit and pointed a finger toward the sidewalk up ahead.  
  
  Sure enough, there was my mommy and she was really upset. A scared look was on her face as she grabbed the arms of people passing by and spoke frantically to them. I realized she was looking for me. Needing to reassure her I pulled my hand from the boy’s and took off running in her direction.  
  
  Her big, round, terrified eyes found me and she let out a sob then began to call my name, “Pagan, Pagan, Pagan!”  
  
  My eyes opened and the ceiling fan greeted me, the sun streamed in through my window and my frustrated mother banged on my door.  
  
  “You’re going to be late for school. Now get up right this minute”  
  
  “I’m awake. Calm down,” I called out in a voice hoarse from sleep and forced myself to sit up.  
  
  “Finally, I swear girl, you’re getting harder and harder to wake up. Now hurry up. I’ve made pancakes for breakfast.”  
  
  “Okay, okay,” I muttered and rubbed my sleepy eyes. I’d had another one of those dreams. Why was I dreaming about snippets from my childhood and why was I just now realizing that the same boy helped me out in each of my traumatic experiences? I had forgotten about that day at the festival, getting lost. But it had happened. I remembered it now. And that boy... he’d been there. Why was he so familiar?  
  
  My bedroom door opened softly and my concerns vanished at the sight of Dank stepping inside my room. He’d started using my door instead of just appearing out of nowhere and scaring the bejesus out of me. It was a small request that he always tried to honor.  
  
  “She’s making pancakes... do you think she’d let me have a few when I show up to pick you up for school?”  
  
  His voice was deep and hypnotic. Even now, I wanted to sigh and bask in the warmth it sent through me. I stood up and closed the short distance between us. Stopping right in front of him I placed both hands on his chest and smiled up into his startling blue eyes.  
  
  “Until Leif shows up you’re not exactly her favorite person. You know that.”  
  
  He frowned and I hated that my mother was being so difficult. I didn’t like making him frown. But unfortunately with my exboyfriend suddenly missing my mother was blaming it on me breaking up with him for another guy. It isn’t like I can tell her the truth. She’d think I was insane for real this time and I’d never be let out of the mental house.  
  
  “Hey,” Dank said reaching out a hand to cup my face, “stop it. This isn’t your fault. Besides we both know I don’t need food. Her pancakes just smell incredible.”  
  
  It can come in handy when he read my emotions. Then other times it annoys me to no end.  
  
  “Well, maybe if you would explain to me what exactly you meant by ‘Leif isn’t human’ then I wo  
uldn’t feel so guilty.”  
  
  Dank sighed and sank down on my bed pulling me onto his lap. His blue eyes still held a trace of the glow that ignited in them when he took a soul at the body’s time of death. I wrapped my arms around his neck trying very hard to keep the serious expression on my face. When he was this close it was hard to think coherently.  
  
  “I told you that I’m not completely positive what Leif is exactly. All I know is he has no soul. That’s the only thing I know for certain.”  
  
  I tucked a lock of his dark hair behind his ear and decided to give pouting a try.  
  
  “Well, what do you think he is?”  
  
  Dank raised his eyebrows and a sexy dimple producing grin appeared on his face. “Pouting, Pagan? Really? I expected more from you than that. When did my girl go all underhanded on me...hmmm?”  
  
  I shoved his chest and stuck out my tongue, “That isn’t underhanded.”  
  
  His amused laugh sent shivers of pleasure down my spine. “Yes, Pagan it is. I don’t like for you to pout. You know that.”  
  
  “PAGAN, GET DOWN HERE AND EAT! YOU’RE GOING TO BE LATE,” my mother’s voice loudly carried up the stairs.  
  
  “Go eat. I’ll be outside in twenty minutes to pick you up,” he whispered in my ear before kissing my temple and standing me up. I put my hands on my hips to argue but he vanished before I could get a word out.  
  
  “Just because you’re Death doesn’t mean you can get away with being rude,” I hissed into the empty room just in case he was close enough to hear me.  
  
  With an annoyed humph, I headed to the bathroom to get ready.  
  
  “You’re not going to have time to sit down and eat breakfast if you intend on making it to first period before the bell,” my mother said frowning as I walked into the kitchen.  
  
  “I know, I’ll just take a pancake with me,” I reached for one of the pancakes she’d piled on the plate in the center of the table and felt instantly guilty for taking so long to get ready. She’d obviously went out of her way to make a nice hot meal for me to start my day and all I had time for was to grab a pancake and eat it on my way out to Dank’s Jeep.  
  
  “I’m sorry, Mom. I overslept. Thank you for this,” I said leaning in to kiss her cheek before picking up my book bag off the kitchen table.  
  
  “I need to get you an alarm clock,” she mumbled and pulled out a chair to sit down.  
  
  “I promise tomorrow I’ll get up thirty minutes earlier. Put the left overs in the fridge and we’ll heat them up in the microwave in the morning and enjoy them together.”  
  
  She didn’t smile but instead frowned into her coffee cup. Dangit, she knew how to make me feel bad.  
  
  Pulling out a chair, I sat down knowing I’d be jumping right back up in less than three minutes but I wanted to make her happy and I wanted to ask her about my dream.  
  
  “Do you remember when I was a kid and got lost at the Arts and Entertainment Fair?”  
  
  She set her cup down and her forehead wrinkled in thought. I hoped my forehead didn’t wrinkle like that when I got older. Other than the forehead thing though, I wouldn’t mind looking like my mother at her age. The short pageboy haircut made her dark hair look shiny and her legs were hot for an old woman.  
  
  “Um...I think so. OH! Yes, the time I had my hands full of books and you were supposed to be holding onto my skirt. God, that was terrifying. I remember the moment I realized your grip was gone and then I turned around and you weren’t there. My heart stopped. You probably shaved five years of my life off that day.”  
  
  So it had been real. Mom’s dark brown eyes peeped over the rim of her coffee cup as she took a sip. I wanted to ask more but the frown on her face stopped me. Her attention was fixed over my shoulder at the window. Dank was here. I hated her thinking my relationship with him had something to do with Leif disappearing. The fact was I’d never got a chance to break up with Leif. He’d vanished before I could. But telling her that would make things even worse. If I didn’t know that Leif wasn’t human then I’d be worried too but I knew the truth.  
  
  “I gotta go Mom. Love ya,” I called out heading for the door. I didn’t want to listen to her lecture me on being more concerned about the fact Leif had run away.  
  
  “It’s almost time”  
  
  I stopped and stood frozen on the front steps of the house. My hand reached out and gripped the cold iron railing. I knew that voice.  
  
  “Pagan.” Dank was in front of me instantly. Lifting my eyes to meet his I shook my head to clear it.  
  
  “Did you... did you see anyone or ...um, anything?” I stumbled through my words, still reeling from the voice spoken directly in my ear.  
  
  The blue color in Dank’s eyes went from their normal brilliant blue to flickering orbs.  
  
  “Pagan, your eyes,” he reached out and cupped my face with his hands as he studied me. Death wasn’t supposed to fear anything; yet I could see it in every crease of his frown. The fact that his eyes looked like blue flames meant something.  
  
  “What about my eyes?” I asked in a panicked whisper.  
  
  Dank pulled me up against him tightly, “Come on, we’re going.”  
  
  I let him all but carry me to the Jeep and even put me inside and buckle me up.  
  
  “Dank, tell me what’s wrong,” I pleaded as he kissed me softly on the lips.  
  
  “Nothing. Nothing that I can’t fix,” he assured me and pressed his forehead to mine. “Listen to me Pagan, you have no reason to worry. I’ve got this. Remember what I told you. What Death protects can’t be harmed and baby,” the pad of his thumb caressed my cheek, “you’re the only thing I protect.”  
  
  The shivers I never seemed to be able to control when his voice dropped an octave and went all smooth and sexy seemed to make him happy. He always gave me a sexy smirk when I shivered.  
  
  “Okay, but I heard a voice. In my ear. Like when you talk to me but you’re far away.”  
  
  Dank tensed and he took a deep breath. “You did?”  
  
  I nodded and watched as he closed his eyes tightly and an angry snarl vibrated against his chest.  
  
  “No one gets that close to you. No thing gets that close to you.” He kissed the tip of my nose and then closed the door before appearing in the driver’s seat beside me. I sure hoped he wasn’t so otherwise occupied that he wasn’t paying attention to what my mother was doing. If she was looking out the window just now then things could get complicated.  
  
  “She’s already closed off in her room writing,” Dank said as he cranked the Jeep and pulled out onto the road. I didn’t ask how he knew what I was thinking. I was used to this by now. I couldn’t worry about anything without him knowing. He was obsessed with fixing all my problems. Normally that would frustrate me but right now with the problems I had looming I needed him.  
  
  “What did the voice say?” His voice was tense and I could tell he was trying to control the angry hiss that amused me when it was brought on because of jealousy. Right now it wasn’t amusing. At all.  
  
  “It’s almost time,” I replied, studying his reaction. His left hand tightened on the steering wheel as he reached over and rested his hand on my thigh.  
  
  “I’ll have this handled immediately. I didn’t see anything but I felt it. The moment you froze, I felt it. It isn’t a soul. It isn’t a deity. It is nothing that I’m familiar with but that leaves only a few things it can be. And I promise you Pagan that not one of those things is a match for me. So stop worrying. I’m Death, baby. Remember that.”  
  
  I let out a sigh and covered his hand with mine.  
  
  “I know,” I replied and began tracing hearts on his hand with the tip of my finger.  
  
  “I missed you last night,” he whispered in a husky voice.  
  
  I smiled down at his hands as he flipped it over and clasped mine in his. I liked knowing he missed me.  
  
  “Good.”  
  
  An amused chuckle was his response.  
  
  Chapter Two  
  
  When Dank pulled into the parking lot of the school, I did my daily check for Leif’s truck. And just as the days before it was missing from his spot. Instead of  
someone taking the coveted parking slip of the most popular guy at school it remained empty. It was as if they were all waiting. Wondering.  
  
  The last time I’d seen Leif was the day I’d thought Dank was lost to me forever. Gee, a transporter who was trying to kill my body and force Death’s hand, yet oddly enough became my friend, had managed to get my soul out of my body without Death’s help. Problem was, it was too late. Death had already broken the rules and he had to pay for it. I was left with the decision to either become a lost wandering soul or get back in my body and live. Even though the only guy I’d ever love was burning in Hell like a fallen angel for not doing his job when it was time to take my life. Gee explained that Dank would be tormented even more in the pits of Hell if he knew I was a lost soul. He’d want to know that I lived. That his sacrifice was for something. I’d do anything to ease his pain. I got back in my body that morning and chose life. For him.  
  
  Then he’d been at school that morning and I hadn’t even taken a moment to speak to Leif and explain. I’d just run to Dank. After Dank explained everything and then laid the whopper on me that Leif wasn’t human we’d gone to find him. But Leif Montgomery was missing. That was a month ago.  
  
  “Don’t frown,” Dank’s voice broke into my thoughts as his hand cupped my face and studied me. He could hear my fears. There was no reason to explain my sudden mood change.  
  
  “Will he ever come back?”  
  
  Dank let out a sigh while glancing back over my shoulder, “I’m afraid so.”  
  
  “Why does that seem to bother you? I know you say Leif has no soul but I know Leif. I’ve spent time with him. He isn’t evil. He’s incredibly sweet.”  
  
  Those blue eyes I loved lit up and the glow I was growing accustomed to warned me I’d said the wrong thing. Dank wasn’t dealing well with the emotion of jealousy. It was completely new to him and it wasn’t something he had a handle on.  
Leif is what he must be. He was created Pagan. He did his job. He isn’t sweet. He has no soul.”  
  
  I leaned forward and kissed his jaw then whispered, “Easy, big guy. We both know who owns my soul.”  
  
  “That’s right,” Dank replied then nipped at my ear, “and don’t you forget it.”  
  
  I shivered from his warm breath against my skin.  
  
  Banging on my window startled me and I pulled back from my sexy boyfriend and turned to see Miranda, my best friend, staring at me through the window with an amused expression.  
  
  “Saved by the best friend,” Dank murmured pressing one last kiss to my neck before reaching for my backpack and opening his car door. He stepped out into the morning sunlight looking like a greek god. The jeans that hung perfectly from his hips cupped his butt deliciously. And Dank could rock a fitted t-shirt and did so on a daily basis. Today the t-shirt showing off his impressive chest was a dark blue. His black boots never changed but I liked them. They were all kinds of sexy. He looked like a bad ass even with my red backpack thrown over his left shoulder. I watched in helpless fascination as he sauntered around the front of his Jeep to open my door. I’d learned the hard way not to open my own car door. He didn’t like it. I could feel Miranda’s eyes on me but I didn’t care. She could watch me ogle my boyfriend. Besides, she completely understood. Miranda thought, like the rest of the world, that Dank Walker was the lead singer of the rock band Cold Soul. Ironic, I know. Dank did sing with the band but he wasn’t with them often. Miranda was a total fan girl.  
  
  Dank opened my door and I stepped out finally tearing my eyes off him to meet my friend’s gaze.  
  
  “Well, good morning to you too,” Miranda teased, slipping her arm in mine. “I wondered how long it was going to take you to stop staring at your rocker boyfriend like a worshipful puppy dog and notice little ‘ol me.”  
  
  I elbowed her, “shut up.”  
  
  She giggled, “girl please tell me you aren’t trying to be subtle with your lustful looks because you have failed. That boy knows you want his body.”  
  
  “Stop it,” I hissed  
  
  Dank came up behind me causing my insides to go all warm and tingly. “She can’t possibly want my body more than I want hers.”  
  
  Miranda began fanning herself with her hand, “Dear Lord, have mercy, I think I may swoon.”  
  
  Dank’s hand covered mine and he squeezed. “I’ll meet you inside. I’m going to take these to your locker.”  
  
  He was always so good about giving me time with Miranda. I nodded, not even caring that I had a goofy grin on my face.  
  
  Miranda slid her sunglasses up and rested them on top of her head. Her curls were styled perfectly which I knew from experience took her hours to do. The girl slept in rollers like it was 1980 or something. Her brown eyes twinkled as she watched my boyfriend’s butt as he made his way inside the school.  
  
  “That is one fine piece of--”  
  
  “Miranda!” I shoved her with a grin because of course she was right. But still she didn’t have to say it out loud.  
  
  “Jealous much?” she teased.  
  
  I only rolled my eyes.  
  
  Miranda’s gaze drifted over to Leif’s empty parking space. I couldn’t explain to Miranda about Leif. She didn’t even know I saw dead people, or as Dank liked to put it, ‘wandering souls’. Until Dank, I’d had to live with my secret.  
  
  “I wonder where he is?”  
  
  When Leif had gone missing Dank and I decided to lay low with our relationship. It wasn’t until just last week we’d started being out in the open with it. When the authorities and Leif’s parents had questioned me I had told both of them that Leif and I had just broken up. That it was his decision. Which wasn’t a total lie; he did vanish without a trace. That’s is a form of breaking things off. At first his parents called on a daily basis to ask me if I’d heard from him. They stopped after Leif called and assured them he was fine. Apparently, he’d said he needed time away to deal with some issues. Strangely after that call his parents had seemed to be completely at ease with his disappearance. They no longer came around. I’d even seen his mother in the grocery store last week and she’d smiled brightly at me as if she didn’t have a care in the world. Kids at school were slowly doing the same thing. No one brought him up much anymore. It was... weird.  
  
  “So, did you study for that trig test?” Miranda asked smiling, as if she hadn’t just been worrying about Leif. Again.. weird.  
  
  “Yep. Until late last night.”  
  
  Miranda groaned and flipped her hair over her shoulder. It was one of her dramatic mannerisms that made me laugh.  
  
  “If I fail my parents are going to lock me away in the attic for life. You’ll have to come slip me food under the door.”  
  
  “I doubt it will be all that bad. Besides you did study, right?”  
  
  She rolled her eyes over and glanced at me, “A little. Yeah.”  
  
  “You watched Pretty Little Liars last night didn’t you?”  
  
  With a deep sigh that caused her shoulders to move up and down she replied, “Yep. Last week’s show and this week’s. I can’t help it. I have a thing for Caleb.”  
  
  Grabbing her arm, I pull her inside. “Come on. To the library. We have thirty minutes and you’re not going to get locked up in an attic for life.”  
  
  Miranda beamed at me, “I love you.”  
  
  “Ditto.”  
  
  Hopefully, the library ghost would be somewhere else today. The soul who always wandered around in there was distracting.  
  
  Dank  
  
  I watched as Pagan led Miranda up to the library. She’d be busy for awhile and I had somewhere I needed to be. There was a soul I didn’t want to leave waiting for me. I needed to be there for this one’s actual death. Once Pagan entered the library and I knew she was safe for the time being, I left.  
  
  Before Pagan, I hadn’t understood love. Before Pagan, taking souls had been easy. Now, I knew emotion. I knew pain and the feeling of loss and it made my purpose harder. Especially with the young ones. Even though I knew they’d get another life soon enough I understood their family’s pain as they lost someone they held dear. Because although the soul of that child would return it wouldn’t be the same. They wouldn’t know the child they loved was once again with them when the soul returned in a new life.  
  
  “It’s time, isn’t it?” the little boy looked up at me as I entered his hospital room. I’d been to talk to him before. Several times actually. I wanted him to understand he would be dying soon but that if he followed my directions then he’d be given another life. His soul would live on. This life would just end. His bottom lip quivered as he stared up at me.  
  
  “Yeah, it’s time.”  
  
  “Will it hurt?”  
  
  I shook my head, “I promised you it wouldn’t, didn’t I?”  
  
  He nodded and pulled the dark green dinosaur closer against his chest tucking it under his chin. It had been a week since I’d last been here. His face was more drawn and the circles under his eyes were darker. The sickness was taking over.  
  
  “Mommy thinks I’m going to get better. I tried to tell her I wasn’t.”  
  
  The tightness in my chest appeared. This used to be so easy.  
  
  “Those who love you don’t want to accept that your body in this life has grown too sick to continue. But remember: you’ll come back. You’ll be born into a new body and you will return to this family. Maybe not tomorrow or the next day but one day you’ll return.”  
  
  He sniffed and rubbed his nose against the stuffed animal he obviously loved.  
  
  “Yeah, but you said I wouldn’t remember this life. I’d forget who I once was. I don’t want to forget Mommy and Daddy. I don’t want to forget Jessi, even if she can be mean sometimes, she’s my big sister.”  
  
  This was why Death wasn’t meant to feel emotion. I wanted to cuddle the kid up in my arms and make false promises. Anything to ease his fear but this was his fate. He’d be back soon. I’d already asked about his soul after meeting him the first time. His sister was sixteen. In six years she’d give birth to a  
baby boy who’d she name after her brother and this soul would return.  
  
  “I know but you have to trust me. This is the way life works. You may not remember this life but your soul will always be attached to the ones you love. Your soul will be happy and although you won’t remember, your soul will feel like it’s come home.”  
  
  The little boy nodded and set the dinosaur down. “Mommy just left to get me some ice. Can we wait until she comes back? I want to tell her bye,” he choked on that last word.  
  
  I nodded and stood back as the door to his room opened. In walked his mother. She was also thinner since my last visit and the sorrow and fear rolling off her was breathtaking. The dark circles under her eyes looked almost as if she were the one dying today.  
  
  “Sorry it took so long, baby. I had to go to the next floor to get the ice you like,” she hurried to his side. The wrinkled clothes hung on her frail frame. She was already grieving. She knew. She may have told her son he was going to get better but she knew.  
  
  “Mommy,” his weak voice said with more strength than I expected. I watched as the small child reached for his mother’s hand. He was about to comfort her. His body might be young but his soul wasn’t. He had an old soul. One that had seen many lives. At the moment of death the soul began to take over. Even though his mind was that of a five year old his soul knew that his mother needed him to be strong right now.  
  
  “I love you,” he said and a sob rattled her body. I wanted to hug her to help ease her pain but I couldn’t. Death wasn’t meant to comfort.  
  
  “I love you too sweet boy,” she whispered squeezing his small hand in hers.  
  
  “I’ll never really go away okay. Don’t be sad.”  
  
  He tried as so many others had to explain to the ones they were leaving behind that they would return. But like all humans she began weeping and shaking her head in denial. Facing the loss of her little boy was too much for her mind to comprehend.  
  
  “Don’t talk like that baby. We’re going to fight this,” she said with a fierceness only a desperate mother could muster at a time like this.  
  
  “No mommy. I need to go now but I promise, I’ll always be here.”  
  
  I stepped up beside him as his mother covered his small body with hers. His small hand reached out to mine and I grasped it. He nodded and I took his soul.  
  
  “You always summon me for the tough ones. Why is that? Hmmmm? Cause your girlfriend likes me so you’re getting back at me?” Gee grumbled as she strutted into the hospital room.  
  
  “This isn’t about you Gee. It’s about the kid. Take his soul now. He doesn’t need to see the rest. He needs to go on up.”  
  
  Gee glanced down at the mother weeping over the body that had once housed the soul. Her sobs were getting more intense and the nurses began rushing into the room shouting. Immediately Gee took the soul’s hand and left without another word. She might be a pain in my ass but she wasn’t heartless. That’s why I always sent for her when it was a death like this one. With one last glance back at the grieving mother I left the room. She’d love her grandson one day and hold him close to her as she told him all about his uncle. The soul might not remember that life but he’d know what a fighter his uncle had been and that the life he’d only experienced for a short time would never be forgotten. His next life he’d grow old with his own grandchildren to tell stories to.  
  
  Chapter Three  
  
  “Hey,” Pagan murmured in her soft, sexy, sweet tone that meant she missed me. Normally I didn’t leave during the day to take souls. Only the tough ones or ones I’d made a connection with. I didn’t have to be there for a body to die. I just had to be there to take the soul attached to it away from the body. So, although people died every second of every day I wasn’t always there at that moment. It’s why people often saw the “ghost” of their loved ones hours after their death. The soul stayed with the body until I came for it. Then there were the souls who refused to go. The ones who wouldn’t leave. The ones who became lost souls and wandered the earth for all eternity confused.  
  
  “You look...sad,” she pointed, out wrapping her arms around my waist.  
  
  “Just thinking,” I assured her, pulling her tightly against my chest.  
  
  “You just took a soul, didn’t you?” she replied, studying me.  
  
  I nodded.  
  
  “A kid?”  
  
  I nodded again, “a boy.”  
  
  She understood. We’d talked about this before. There were so many things she’d wanted to know and I was helpless where she was concerned. I couldn’t manage to tell the girl no.  
  
  “When will he come back?”  
  
  “In six years.”  
  
  “Who took him?”  
  
  “Gee.”  
  
  “Oh, good. He’ll like her.”  
  
  I grinned. Gee wasn’t the most likable being I’d ever met but for some strange reason Pagan liked her. Even when she’d thought Gee was a teenage girl who suffered from schizophrenia.  
  
  She laid her head against my chest and sighed. Death wasn’t something Pagan dealt with well but she was learning to understand it more.  
  
  Pagan  
  
  The tree wasn’t so big. Stupid Wyatt didn’t know nothing. Just because I was a girl didn’t mean I couldn’t climb it too. I’d show him. By the time he got here I’d be all the way at the top. See if he thinks girls can’t do things boys can do. HA! We can do them better. Cause we’re just cooler.  
  
  Glancing back to see if Mom was watching from the kitchen window and finding it all clear I grabbed a hold of the rough bark. It was warm and sticky. Once I had both arms and legs wrapped firmly around it I began inching myself up higher. I just wouldn’t look down. I’d keep making my way until I was at the tippy top. No reason to look down. That would just mess me up. A sliver of wood cut into my hand and I yelped pulling it back to see if I was bleeding. There was a small splinter poking out of my hand and I pressed my palm against my mouth and used my teeth to pull it out. Smiling with satisfaction once the small painful bark was firmly between my teeth I jerked it out and spit the offending object out.  
  
  See, I was as tough as any boy. Wyatt and his dumb mouth saying I was weak. Whatever! I continued my upward climb. Maybe once he saw how much cooler I was than him because I could climb higher he’d let me into his new treehouse. That “boys only” sign looked just plain stupid anyway. Mom said I needed to ignore them and let the boys have their special hideout but I couldn’t do that. It just wasn’t fair when I was the one who came up with the treehouse idea in the first place. Besides, all Miranda wanted to do was put on makeup and paint our nails. Who wanted to waste time doing that stuff? Not me! That’s who.  
  
  My foot slipped and I tightened my hold on the trunk trying not to panic. I could do this. My hands began to sweat and my firm grasp had weakened. This wasn’t good. I moved my arm so I could find something to hold onto other than the tree trunk when my other foot slipped and I went into a free fall backwards. I tried to scream but nothing came out. Closing my eyes tightly I waited for the ground to slam into my back. It was going to hurt.  
  
  “Umph, got you,” a familiar voice said and I opened my eyes to see a boy staring down at me. He was holding me. Odd. Shaking my head I stared up at the tree I’d just fallen from and tried to remember how I knew this boy. Had I hit my head and he picked me up?  
  
  “Uh,” I replied still confused. I’d been falling. Then... this boy was holding me and talking.  
  
  “What were you doing up there? That was too high.”  
  
  I turned my gaze back to his, “Um, I uh... did you catch me?” I asked incredulously.  
  
  He grinned and the baby blue color of his eyes appeared to darken. “Yeah. Why else do you think you’re not lying on the ground with a few broken bones?”  
  
  I shook my head and pushed to stand up. He put me down easily and once again I was startled by how familiar he looked. Did he go to school with us?  
  
  “Where’d you come from?”  
  
  He shrugged, “Just around. Saw you climbing too high and came over to see if you needed help.”  
  
  “Do I know y  
ou?” I asked watching his face take on a strange smile.  
  
  “I wish you did but you don’t. Not yet. It isn’t time.”  
  
  “What do you mean?”  
  
  He was weird and he talked like a grown up.  
  
  “Pagan Moore, get your butt over here if you’re going to get a sneak peek at my tree house before the boys get here,” Wyatt was standing at the street grinning at me like he’d just offered me a million dollars.  
  
  What was he talking about a “peek?” I wanted IN. Not a stupid peek. I glanced back at the boy who’d caught me to see if he wanted to come too but he was gone.  
  
  “Almost time, almost time, almost time, almost time.”  
  
  I sat up in bed gasping for breath as the chanting in my ear faded away. The same voice from yesterday. I knew that voice. Didn’t I? And what did it mean by “almost time.”  
  
  I dropped my head into my hands and sighed. What was happening to me? These dreams seemed so real. Like memories I’d forgotten. The same boy. The same voice.  
  
  I stared through my fingers at the light barely coming through my window. The sun wasn’t even completely up yet. There was no way I was going back to sleep. Mom would be thrilled I’d managed to get up in time to eat breakfast with her today. The dream was going to bother me. I needed to ask Wyatt about that tree. Had I told him about falling? I couldn’t remember. Maybe he would.  
  
  Getting out of bed I brushed my hair and stood at my window studying the old oak tree. It felt like there was another memory attached to that tree but I couldn’t quite remember it. I put the brush down and slipped on my flip flops and made my way outside. I wanted to go out there. It was almost as if the tree suddenly had some sort of invisible pull to it.  
  
  The cool morning air caused me to shiver as I walked down the porch steps and across the damp grass. A jacket would have been a wise decision but I’d been too anxious to come see this tree.
