1gxupcd,https://www.reddit.com/r/internetparents/comments/1gxupcd/i_need_help_learning_to_budget/,I need help learning to budget,"Opening my bank account terrifies me. That sounds weird to say, but my heart rate goes up, I feel sick to my stomach, and I get dizzy. Sitting down to look at my finances causes me to have a borderline panic attack, and as a result, I rather irresponsibly handed the whole ""money topic"" over to my partner when I got married. He's good at math and liked taking care of us, but over the years it has grown into an issue.

The financial trauma happened because of my abusive dad, who manipulated and controlled everyone in the family through finances. When I was 18, I was given some grant money for college, but burned through it trying to live on my own for the first time because I had zero financial literacy skills and didn't know how to budget. I ended up moving back in to my dysfunctional home situation and trying to kill myself because I was so ashamed. The nicest thing my dad ever said to me was ""it isn't worth losing your life over a few thousand dollars wasted."" 

I haven't been fortunate over the years. I've had major health issues with significant medical expenses, and just as we were starting to recover from that, one of our cars had major engine failure and we had to buy another one with no money to put down on it. I want to get better with money, but I don't know how. I don't have a college degree and I don't make very much since I work in retail. 

I don't want to fight with my spouse over finances, but as a woman...I just had different needs than he does. I keep my makeup expenses absolutely minimal, hardly ever buy new clothes, and I cut my own hair. But I do like to ""treat myself"" to coffee and food, and my pets have been unlucky with big vet bills, so that's what I tend to spend money on that should be going to savings instead. He virtually never buys anything except groceries and wears the same clothes he had in college, so he does criticize me if I mention I need something and that is hard for me sometimes.

Since my dad used money to manipulate/abuse us, even hearing the names of gurus like ""Dave Ramsey"" is triggering because my dad used to quote him constantly. Do I need to just get over this and go learn from Ramsey anyway? 

Recommendations for where to start learning/adulting when it comes to money, ideas on preventing small ""compulsion"" buys for emotional gratification, etc would be appreciated.",1,1732349043.0,internetparents,1,1.0,False

So every morning I make 2 cups of coffee. One for me and one for my partner. The first cup, I manage to get out 36-38g coffee from 18g in about 30 seconds. The way I do it is I keep the double shot button pressed for about 8 seconds and then let go, with the machine starting to make noises around the 5 second mark.. The first drops of coffee come out around 12 seconds and around 30 seconds, I stop it. 

For the second cup, I try to do exactly the same but I notice two differences:

1) The portafilter is easier to lock into the machine. Thermal effects?
2) Although I keep the double shot button pressed for 8 seconds like before, I notice that the machine starts to ""work"" and make noises around the 2-3 second mark instead of 5-6.

As a result, I get:
1) The first drops of coffee coming out around the 10-11 second mark.
2) Much higher flow so that I get 36g out in 23-24 seconds in total.

This difference is consistent every day and not coincidental and it is always the 2nd (and subsequent if I have to make more) cup I make.

1gxuo2c,https://i.redd.it/31u2tqkoyl2e1.jpeg,Spencer and Caleb!!!,"I'll die on this hill.

Hanna and Caleb were good together until he goes to Ravenswood. Once he returns and they get back together, their relationship is dead AF. They constantly bicker, he turns into a simp who just follows Hanna, all they do is indulge in each other's bad habits and their relationship stays that way until the end.

I think the Spencer/Caleb/Hanna angle was something the writers planned for a long time, not just a spur-of-the-moment thing, and I'll tell you why. Even when they were just friends in the earlier seasons, Spencer and Caleb spent a lot of time together compared to any of the other Liars and their partners (and not in a creepy sort of way). For example, Hanna and Toby only speak face-to-face in one episode when she pretends to go out with Toby, Aria and Toby have 0 scenes together and most of the Liars interactions with Ezra are from a teacher/tutor/boss perspective, not friends. So, Spencer and Caleb were ""good"" friends with no romantic feelings toward each other during high school, knowing what each other had been through. A lot of people think of such incidents as filler, but we see them sitting down, having a coffee, and understanding each other and this is why it bothers me when fans use the ""how would you feel if Hanna or Aria dated Toby"" nonsense, they're not friends and they don't spend time time unlike Spencer and Caleb. They have insane chemistry, so it's not such a crazy thing for them to reconnect and date, especially when Hanna moves on and is engaged.

Even if the relationship didn't last a life time, it should have ended on their terms and not because of unresolved feelings between Hanna and Caleb, them getting back together and ending up married was definitely one of my least favourite ships.",1,1732348896.0,PrettyLittleLiars,1,0.67,False

1gxulwq,https://www.reddit.com/r/enmeshmenttrauma/comments/1gxulwq/i_need_to_get_so_many_years_of_trauma_off_my_chest/,I need to get so many years of trauma off my chest,"I’ve been reading your posts and I feel seen. Although I’ve never discussed enmeshment with my therapists, I kind of feel like this is exactly my family’s M.O. Some posts mentioned how painful it is to realize that your parents are not who they pretended or appeared to be. That got to me. It is very hurtful to realize the love they showed was self-serving and not genuine. 

My mom worshipped my dad. Her purpose in life was to keep him happy and his happiness came from money, always being right, and us children fulfilling his dreams and feeding his ego. Several therapists have told me he shows narcissistic behavioral traits. 

My parents were both proud of my academic achievements but ashamed of my weight. They were both overweight too but that was okay. My mom started taking me to Weight Watchers when I was in 4th grade. She went too but pretended she was there as my adult and not for her weight issues. She would always talk about what I had done right or wrong during the meetings and never about her own experience. 

I can’t say my siblings and I were not allowed freedom. We could try new hobbies and hang out with friends, but our big life decisions had to be sanctioned by my dad. His opinion was the only right opinion. For example, when I was in high school I would express my desire to study psychology and my dad would say I was so much smarter than that. We were groomed to please him. He chose careers for all my siblings. He picked them based on business plans he had for each of us. My youngest sister wanted to go into fashion and he pushed her into psychology. I’ve always wondered how my dad could tell me it was beneath me and then force my sister down that career path. I ended up choosing law. This was approved, of course. However, when I leaned towards Human Rights, my dad said “That’s just a coffee house conversation topic”. I have always leaned towards helping people and he wishes I was a ruthless greedy attorney. He boasts about successful and innovative business practices he’s come up with. I’m embarrassed because they’re so evidently unethical that people get uncomfortable hearing about them. 

My dad never took on any parenting. He was never at our birthday parties but he would make an exception for graduations because that’s when people would congratulate him on having the smartest kid. I graduated summa cum laude from law school. He still feels the need to lie to people in front of me and tell them I went to Harvard. I did not. He only stopped doing that when I told him the next time he did that I’d call him out on being a liar. 

I remember telling a therapist once that I felt really guilty for not having a good relationship with my dad since he had always been there for me. She immediately pointed out that he was never actually there. It hit me like I had just gotten splashed with a bucket of cold water. 

In the late nineties, when school shootings became a thing, my dad sent us away to a smaller city because he was “concerned” for our safety. Since my mom never contradicted my dad, she did as she was told. Years later we found out it was because he moved his mistress into our family home and just needed us out of his way. I remember living with sadness and guilt all those years because my wonderfully perfect dad had stayed behind in the dangerous city and sacrificed himself to provide for us. 

I’m not quite sure if we were enmeshed before this but it was exacerbated after we got sent away. My mom got a house and we all had our own rooms. For some reason, though, we all slept in the same room. We set up additional beds and all slept together. My mom has always used me as her little helper and always confided in me. I used to think she would do that because I was so mature. I didn’t see anything wrong with that until I read a post about how it’s abusive and manipulative to tell your kids they’re your best friend. Throughout my teenage years, I remember people randomly asking me why my family was always so happy. Now, I realize they intuitively knew something was wrong. 

When my mom found out my dad had another family, she didn’t say anything because he was our sole provider. My mom will gladly look the other way if it’s to her benefit. Later, something changed and she told me. Months later she told my siblings. During that time, she made me keep secrets, lie, and steal things out of my dad’s wallet. She even gave me a listening device so I could listen to conversations he had in other rooms. Once she hinted at how I should flirt and seduce my dad’s business partner (a man my dad’s age) as part of a “revenge” plan she had. I always thought she loved me unconditionally because she called me her best friend and we heard “nobody will ever love you more than your mom” daily.  Now I see she’s incredibly manipulative and I  have had to call her out on it several times. 
When my dad found out we knew about his affair, he was financially violent and cut us off completely. I had just finished law school. I got a day job as a lawyer and then taught English online from 7 pm-12 am every night so I could support my mom and siblings. On the weekends, I worked from 11 pm-7 am because the graveyard shift paid more. My mom would wake up in the morning and say “Oh sweetie you’ve been working all night…let me make you breakfast.” She never mentioned looking for a job or finding a way to contribute financially. 

My mom took financial advantage of me for years until I told her I was done and that I deserved a chance to live the life of a 20-something-year-old and have fun on my weekends. She cried and said she was sorry but then she used my brother the same way. 

Neither of my parents can see any fault in themselves. They genuinely think they have been the best parents. My mom especially thinks she’s a role model parent because she never developed any interest besides her kids’ lives. 

My mom lives 30 minutes away and I don’t visit more than once a month because she inevitably starts talking about my dad and the many ways in which he’s wrong and ruined her life. And how she always stood up for us kids against him (an absolute lie). I’ve told her this is not a conversation topic I care for but she always goes there. When she visits me, she always has a comment about how my house could be cleaner. Or if I’m cooking something, she will pretend to be surprised to see me cooking. This has gone on for years now. As I’ve come out of the toxic dynamic, she’s resorted to punishing me with these critical comments. 

My husband has been a light. I’ve learned healthy dynamics and boundaries and he helps me stick with them. I know my mom is always kissing up to him because she would love for him to ask her to move in with us. She even asked me once if we would build a suite for her on our property. My dad, on the other hand, couldn’t care less for my husband. One year, he told me I needed to tell my husband that we were going to file our taxes late. This was because he wanted to take some of my rightful tax deductions for himself. I told my dad my husband liked doing things correctly and was not going to file late. His response was “Who cares if he gets mad? People divorce and remarry someone else all the time”. All because I put my foot down and did not let him tell me what to do and steal from me. 

I always feel so much guilt and shame. I’m mostly in minimal contact with my dad. And my mom texts me every single day but I can’t get myself to always respond. And when she calls
me, I know she’s about to dump a problem on me. I hate seeing her calls coming in.  I know it upsets her but I just feel so much more at peace when I don’t talk them. I’ve fantasized many times about moving far away from my family. And then I feel guilt and shame for being ungrateful for the things they gave me. I tell myself I’m overdramatic about my family’s flaws and that I should spend time with them before they die. But like I’ve told my therapists, we’re family but I would not be friends with them if we weren’t. 

Thank you for reading. Sorry this is so long, but I just had a lot to get off my chest.

I am on mobile (excuse formatting) in ICU with my father who has cancer of lymph nodes. 1st dose of chemo worked great. But condition has deteriated to point of using feeling tube.

My Nmother who had narcisstic personality disorder died in 2020. 

After years of abuse my father found a partner, Joan. She is wonderful. At 82 they went camping, mushroom picking canoeing, and kicked some serious ass at a lawn bowling club. 

I, and all my friends and family were so very pleased to see this wonderful man who had been verbally, emotionally and physically abused by my mother have some good years. 

She ranted and raved at Joan last night. Eventually Joan told her to stop being such a victim. I like Joan. 

You have no idea how vile she had been. She is completely abobsessed with getting money out of bank accounts. And the fact that we fixed up my dad's room has enraged her. We've had ""lampgate"" as she accused us of hoarding lamps. Last night ""Drunky Mcbearson's"" beahavious lead to bear gate were she barged in while my wife and I were sleeping ranting about a bear that was in the backyard. She didn't know how to open the sliding door to patio; I'm like what you gonna do - wrestle it? 

She put the garbage outside but it was not secured. We grew up on a coastal town in canada that has bears. 

Overall is my concern that she is going to give direction to drs without conferring woth Joan and I first. I missed the fucking family meeting yesterday.

I believe she arranged it and did not inform me. I had just left the hospital...

 She updated me but did not mention ""paperwork"" that Joan had seen her looking over. When I asked her she got very shitty in ICU....I went over to the nurse (who had observed the scene) and explained my concerns and situation. I point blank said I do not think she has his best interests at heart. I do not want her to make decisions without conferring with his partner and I, and I want this recorded in the notes and drs aware. The nurse totally understood when I apologized and said it's an atypical situation- she assured me it was not. Shannon would have heard every word. 

She is being competitive about being with my dad at hospital, ie I ledt early yesterday morning, she heard me leave. According to wife she raged around, screaming took a piss and jumped in the car without washing or brushing her teeth. I stopped and got gas on the way, picked up coffees for Joan and I and tried to get a newspaper. 

She has spoken of taking cash out of his accounts. Due to tax after death. I told her not my priority. Joan has all the bank cards and I removed all the cheque books lying around the home last month and gave them to him. 

Two wks ago just after 1st dose of chemo she was brow beatng him for cash for her kids. Ranting and raving. Asking Joan to transfer it to her and he could go to the bank. 

At this point he was having trouble getting to bathroom. 

He has a will. It is 50/50 between us. No named executor. He has asked we give Joan money and I will honor that agreement. 

I am grey rocking. The best I can. 

We are both staying in the family home. 

My wife has been a wonderful source of support as well as my friends (I have so many good ones here I really am blessed). However wife has to leave in 2 days to go home to job and cat. 

So my fellow redditors - looking for some help here in navigating dealing with this mutherf*cking POS. She is very manipulative to say the least. 

And has made one of the saddest events of my life so much more difficult. 

Thank you in advance.

I still think this way but I’m not sure if I was just being edgy, or if this has any real meaning to it. I’m curious to know if other people agree? (First time on Reddit) ","To not have an ego is to be selfless, and to be selfless is to lack all sense of identity. The way humans use the word “selfless” is motivated to separate us from our cruel nature. Us humans have defined what makes us good and bad by using moral judgment. This has shaped our thinking because instead of accepting our cruel nature, we started making concepts that place us in a box we aren’t meant to be in due to trying to make our image look good. If I were to walk up to the most selfless person I knew and call them “selfish” they would probably look at me like I’m crazy, or even get heavily offended, and although it would seem to be wrong…it wouldn’t be. The reason why is because all people act out of emotion and emotion is a self inflicted response to stimuli that shapes our desires and perspectives. Meaning we manage our emotions to adapt to our environment and needs. So when you’re doing things whether for yourself, or for another person it’s also going to be influenced out of self interest, which is rooted to emotional behavior that inevitably contradicts people acting outside of “themselves”. I think that the whole point of our existence is that we obliviously feed off of each other until we die. Even if a person were to have no one in their last moments, they would still be feeding off of the person who made the death bed they are laying on. Or if someone were to get coffee and sit down, they would be feeding off of the person who made the coffee, as well as the chair, cup, table, and straw. To basically put it I think we are all parasites. Non of us are “good” we are all horrible people, and the people who think otherwise are too blinded by their pride and ego to think above the surface. We are born to live for ourselves, and we use people to keep our sanity and dignity. That’s why it’s so hard for humans to think about our cruel parasitic behaviors, because we all trick ourselves into thinking the use of each other isn’t selfish, that it is “love” or “companionship”. It is nothing other than parasitic behavior.

I recently moved into a new place and spent weeks figuring out how to furnish my living room. After countless hours of research and some trial and error, I thought I'd share what I learned to help others in the same boat.

First things first - the sofa is literally the centerpiece of any living room. It's where you'll spend most of your time, whether you're binge-watching Netflix or hosting friends. After trying several options, I found this amazing comfortable sofa on Amazon (https://athometouch.com/sofa) that perfectly balanced style and comfort.

Beyond the couch, here's what I've learned works best:

Coffee Table:
Go for something that matches your sofa's height. I learned the hard way that a too-tall or too-short table is super annoying when you're trying to reach for your drink.

Side Tables:
These are game-changers! They're perfect for lamps, drinks, or your phone. I got matching ones to keep things looking organized.

Entertainment Center:
Whether you're a minimalist or need storage space, pick something that hides cables well. Trust me, visible wires can make even the nicest setup look messy.

Accent Chair:
This is where you can have some fun! While your main sofa (like the one I mentioned from https://athometouch.com/sofa) might be neutral, an accent chair can add personality with bold colors or patterns.

Lighting:
Don't underestimate good lighting! I got a mix of floor lamps and table lamps to create different moods. Overhead lighting alone can be harsh.

Area Rug:
This ties everything together. Make sure it's big enough - all furniture legs should either be on or off the rug, not halfway.

A few extra tips that made a huge difference for me:
- Leave enough walking space between furniture pieces
- Don't push everything against the walls
- Add some plants for life and color
- Use throw pillows and blankets to add texture
- Consider your lifestyle (pets? kids?) when choosing materials

Remember, you don't have to buy everything at once. I started with the essential pieces (mainly that comfy sofa) and built around them gradually. This helped me avoid making rushed decisions I might regret later.

What's your experience with furniture shopping? Any tips you'd add to this list?",1,1732348443.0,LivingEssentials,0,1.0,False

She was 65. I'm a 35 yo man. She was in the ICU for 2 and a half months. She showed no major signs of illness before that just grumpiness that se thought was depression.

I miss her so much.

She raised my by herself. I have no siblings. She was ill for most of my life due to bad family doctor and that's what ultimately led to her premature death.

She was always optimistic and everything is going to be alright person. She was also a strong woman, raised me in a war torn country. She never complained. We were never poor but not well off either. She always made sure that I'm not different than my peers, I had, all the toys and clothes that I wanted. Most importantly I had her love. She dedicated her life to me to make my life good. She never demanded anything in return. Ever. She only wanted to know if I was alright. When I started to go out I kept her out of my private life, she was never nosey and intruded, she gave me space, she would tell me - you don't have to tell me anything, just tell me are you alright.

I finished high school and university and got a good job. I was able to make us go from renters to owners. For the last few years she lived alone in apartment close to mine.

After she got ill the first time 10-15 years ago I started to be a carer for her. The roles switched. But the thing is, she was never a burden to even though she always feared that she was. I was her protector. The only thing I was worried for the last few years if she's happy. Does she have everything she needs. I think I managed that with materials stuff. 

I hope that I did that as well emotionally. I saw her daily after work, she called me at 7 every nigh, even it was just to say good night. Last year I met my girlfriend and I had to deal with some anxiety. I was sometime short with her, sometimes I wanted to be alone just watching tv. I feel so bad now because of it. She didn't deserve it. I got truly unconditional love from her. I made sure to hug her and tell her that I love her any chance I got. I tried to find her friend her age so she wouldn't be so reliant on me. She did have a neighbor that she had coffee with daily. But still I feel so guilty from keeping her from my private life. She was always worried I would end up alone. She was always there for me, I could tell her anything and receive no judgment from here, only support and I hope I was like that with her.

She met my girlfriend in hospital few weeks before she died which I hope gave her peace of mind.

I visited her every day just to tell her how much I love her and how amazing of a mom she was and how sorry I am for anything wrong I did to her. So much she was getting annoyed with me.

When I would leave she would always tell me take care of your self and that she loved me.

She was truly the best mom every. I never bragged with university degrees or job titles but I always was bragged and was proud how my mom was.

I'll miss her dearly.

I love you mom, I hope you're in a better place now.

I got this for my father. It's a 96 legacy wagon RHD. We planned to build it as a fun off road toy for him to show off at cars n coffee after we got done with my WRX. It's a mystery vehicle as we didn't have a chance to start wrenching on it much.

So to shorten it up, unfortunately my father passed away few days ago. I don't have the time n money to wrench on this and my WRX wagon that we was building. I'm short on time it's currently sitting in my parents driveway and before my siblings try to talk my mother into having someone haul it away n scrap it I need to find someone to buy it for a fun project. 

*I own the title, it's in hand ready to go. It is clean

* Car is complete minus fuel pump 

*Engine cranks doesn't run

* Interior is decent could probably use a detailer. 

* No key but in neutral. Pretty sure my oldest brother stole the key to be a asshole. 

*Body is in good shape. Didn't get a chance to fully inspect it for rust but what I've seen is just rockers.

1gxudoe,https://www.reddit.com/r/AITAH/comments/1gxudoe/aita_for_feeling_sus_about_this/,AITA for feeling sus about this..,"So this is long. Basically my partner and I started dating awhile ago, when we first starting dating we agreed to polyamory. It was what worked best for us at that time. Do to lack of honesty on my end about situations in polyamory we decided it was hurting us more to be polyamorous, then potential monogamy. 
So we started being monogamous. 
A couple months into monogamy. My partner confessed that they had done a “three way kiss” with three friends, one of whom they told me they use to “date” when we were monogamous. Then they came clean and told me it wasn’t a big group lean in kiss cheeks to cheek. They actually kissed each of them individually including the girl they used to date. I felt like that was an obvious breech of our monogamous commitment. But I forgave, knowing it the first time they had breeched this trust. 
From then on I was extremely uncomfortable with their friendship. Every time they would get coffee or they would post this girl on their story. In all group photos they always seemed to be next to each other. Nothing wrong with that, but still made my intuition spidy senses tingle. Like something was there that was being hidden from me. 
So moving months on. We move in together. This girl and some friends came to visit for a couple nights. At first it was fun and we all drank and got along, but then, my partner did something that upset these friends. They acted very disrespectful in my home, making an unnecessary scene.  
I felt disrespected. So when a month or two later when my partner decided they wanted to hang out with those friends, I opted out of joining. I saw pictures of their night out posted. My partner and the girl they used to date, always right next to each other. My intuition tingle said something was up. 
When my partner got home; they said they had fallen asleep at the hang, and the girls all drew on her body, silly pictures. But also the name of the girl she use to “date” in hearts. I was like hell no, wtf. So I asked if I could go through their texts. They said I’m always welcome to, so later that night I did. I found my partner telling this girl she’s the “prettiest girl ever” and the worst of all. I found pictures this girl sent to my partner from years ago, of them kissing. 
I was mad. I accused them of having an emotional affair with this girl, of having feelings for this girl. They said the girl sent them unsolicited. They also got so angry. 
We were living out of state at them time and were visiting the town her friends and my family lived in. On the way home they were so mad at me for accusing them of emotional affair, that they pulled off an exit and told me to get my luggage and get out and that they were driving back home without me. I felt so powerless. I just cried and cried, and got out. They came to her senses and apologized and stuff. I didn’t leave them for that. 
Okay so now. We have moved back to the state where that girl lives. And my partner is starting back up a friendship with this girl and I’m not comfortable with it at all. So I decided it’s time to set my mfuckin boundaries and be real. I text that girl and I send her a long ass text being vulnerable about my insecurity and why I feel uncomfortable with her. 
She texts me back saying they never “dated” while we were polyamorous, they flirted and maybe kissed but never went on a date. Apparently my partner lied about that bc they wanted to make me feel jealous bc they were feeling so jealous about the people I was dating during polyamory. The girl also apologized for being rude in my house. And then she said she didn’t mean to be disrespectful by drawing on my partner and was just drunk being cutesy friendly with the other girls who participated in drawing on my partner. Oh, and that she only sent those pictures of them kissing bc my partner asked her to. Yeah I’m pissed. I confronted my partner and they still hold true to the story of not having feelings for this friend. That they just wanted the pics bc they were young and they thought it was just a cute pic of them. So the whole time they were angry at me for finding those pics they lied and played the card that the girl sent them on her own and my partner should have set boundaries with this girl but didn’t, but actually my partner asked her to send those pics ….

Hi, (21M) here I'm currently training as an aircraft mechanic, my senior co-workers most likely hates me I've done some small f**k ups here and there but I can't understand why they would isolate me and not strike up conversations with me when at the start they were so friendly I'm even trying to strike up a conversation always with them but I always get ignored or flat out turned down when in the opposite my co-ojt doesn't seem to be facing this problems they can joke around, f**k around, be rude and even make some small fuck ups but my seniors always just laughs at it and never even scolding my co-ojt . 

I feel like I'm being treated like a child here, maybe because i used my brothers advice on always being respectful and showing hospitality i always use honorifics sir/ma'am fyi my brother is a coffee store manager and he has alot of experience so I always follow for his advice, but I'm now having second thoughts, i think my approach in my ojt work was wrong now. Another point I'd like to say is, wtf am I supposed to do when I make a small mistake they scold me telling me they want me to think on my own like use your common sense, and this happened again for another time I made a small f**k up but the difference this time is they want me to tell them first if I don't know what to do like wtf do you want me to do?! It's basically like ""If you don't know what to do then figure it out, and if you don't know what to do then tell me but if you do tell me you're a disappointment."" 

They haven't even taught me how to run-up an aircraft, my co-ojt who came after already knows how to run-up an aircraft, I feel sick to my stomach, is this the real world? Why are they so mean, I just want to learn valuable skills and experience the professional world but this experience is so nauseating and because of them whenever I wake up in the morning thinking I have to go to work in that place makes me sick to my stomach, ojt was supposed to be a place where students learn the skills and knowledge needed to work in the professional world but right now I haven't even started but I already feel like a failure.

1gxu2nc,https://www.reddit.com/r/veterinaryprofession/comments/1gxu2nc/just_need_to_vent_for_a_second/,Just need to vent for a second,"I run a mobile service by myself and I just got my first 2 star review.

I had a euthanasia appointment for a cat that was booked day of. I show up, this cat is BAR but obviously very sick. The owners were a little bit neurotic but whatever, it's a really shitty day for them so I get it.

When cats are more alert, I like to start with oral medications. I can't use oral detomidine in cats, so I mix telazol with a hub of euthasol then mixed with coffee creamer and dip the syringe in churu. There are no oral yummy formulated ""sleepy time"" meds for cats so I do what I can to make it go down easier.

I inform them that I'm doing this because I'd rather not restrain a cat for a needle injection first thing. I can give oral meds first which helps them relax and then they don't even notice my IM injection. 

So I give them my cocktail and the cat starts smacking its lips. The owners seem very distressed. I try to keep things calm and say, yea I try to make the meds yummier but it's less painful than a needle poke. Then the cat gets drowsy in their arms and it doesn't even notice the IM injection. The rest of the appointment goes normally.

So now I have a 2 star review. I was very ""kind and gentle"" with their cat but the oral meds tasted bad and she ""spent her last moments in fear as did we"" and ""surely there must be something better you can give.""

Like... Are you for real? Your cat was fine. I accomodate you day of to so you can euthanize your pet in your arms in the comfort of your home. So it doesn't have to be shoved in a carrier, taken to a strange, loud place, taken to ""the back"" where it's restrained so a catheter can be placed while it's awake, to then have you grieve in public and carry your dead cat home. It had a funny taste in its mouth for a few seconds. That's it. Otherwise it just fell asleep with mom and dad at home. 

I love medicine and I love animals, and I didn't think clients would be a big issue for me because I've worked years in customer service but I was wrong. I am so tired of constantly doing all I can to be there for these pets and it's never enough for these people. It's exhausting. I ruined my mental health to get where I am just for it to be straight up not worth it. Now I have this garbage review for everyone to see when they look up my services when I'm out here using every trick in the book to make this experience as painless as possible. Like why am I trying so hard?

I am just really frustrated with so many things about the very med industry but I do my best and to see my efforts so callously frowned upon really upsets me. I KNOW you can't please everyone. I KNOW I shouldn't sweat the small stuff. I try not to let it get to me, I really do. I guess that's why I need to vent because I don't want to bottle up my negativity.",5,1732346337.0,veterinaryprofession,1,1.0,False

The house was listed as furnished but was actually just full of her personal belongings. As in, I had to pack up her personal massage toys before I could use the dresser. The bookshelves were full, medicine was overflowing from every cabinet, the garage she said we could use as a home office was actually full of her stuff. We ignored all of it because we had nowhere else to go. Multiple tenants lived in the house and we moved in to our room without it being cleaned at all. The house was a mess. 

However, when we asked to end the lease early she agreed that as long as we were out by a certain date that it was fine and she would return to the house herself. We cleaned as much as we could but the house was neglected for years. In any case, it was much cleaner than how we found it. Now she’s texting me saying the house is disgusting, I am disgusting and that I have apparently stolen her duvet and her coffee machine and ruined her mattress. I have done none of these things and left everything as I found it. There was no move in inspection, no move out inspection. We never even met her in person. We moved in as another tenant moved out. Our lease we signed clearly states that we are not liable for the damage or loss to any of the furnishings in the house. Still, she has rather a lot of money I think and now says she will sue me and is going to the police about me “stealing her things”. Do I have anything to really worry about? Can she sue me or will the police actually be interested in an apparently missing duvet?? She also hasn’t returned my damage deposit so I’m not sure if she’s going to try and prove that I damaged her home. ",2,1732346111.0,legaladvicecanada,3,1.0,False

So, I am French and I make videos in English because I currently live full time in South Africa. I make science communication videos, and I am working on my first longer video in a while (about 3 months).

I notice I have to speed up both the video and the audio, at a minimum of x 1.2, as I feel I talk too slow at normal speed. I guess this is normal and I just want to be entertaining and keep people attention. I myself stop watching videos where there is too many pauses, and the person is speaking too slow, but I am not keen on the extra fast talking either.

Although I am pretty proficient in English - I've been living in SA for nearly 5 years now - it still is not my mother tongue. I script most of my videos, but even with that, I can't speak English at the same speed I would be speaking French.

The only thing is, as I have to speed up both the audio and the video, and I already move around a lot when I talk, I look like I have drunk too much coffee and I am jumping everywhere, ahah. 

Do some of you, the non-native English speakers doing videos in English, also speed up your videos ? And if yes, or if no, why ?

It sound and feels pretty powerful and I feel like I wanna get it on my computer, especially when the tempo and pitch is slowed down to 80%. The problem is I couldn't discover the actual track. I have been able to identify some other tracks and stock music used in his videos, particularly ones by Mark Petrie from [www.royaltyfreemusicclips.com](http://www.royaltyfreemusicclips.com), but not this one.

So, I tried the other option, separating the track from his voiceover from his one of his videos through a shitty service [vocalremover.org](http://vocalremover.org) (that has been intentionally made worse and paywalled the improved version by the way) and uploading to AHA Music to identify it. The thing is however, AHA Music has been very helpful to me at all in the past, is faulty and is inconsistent. And after trying it again after several months, my suspicion still rings true.

TL:DR I had a Reiki treatment and now I've read that it can be associated with past life regression. I had a crazy experience that I guess could be that, except that I don't believe in anything esoteric at ALL. Is regression supposed to happen when you're not working towards it?!

Long version:

I had a great few days away, and whilst there I booked in a Reiki session. I have had it a couple of times before, same place, and it's always been really helpful in terms of deep relaxation, and chronic pain. 

Different practitioner each time. 

This last time, there was a much more structured approach to the initial relaxing, box breathing etc. She didn't touch me once, and throughout I had no idea where she was, unless she answered a question, then I could tell she was moving around.She was in stealth mode!

It reminded me a bit of clinical hypnosis, felt as if I was somewhere between relaxed and asleep. 

Suddenly, in the middle of pretty much nothing (wondering which part of me she was covering, why certain pains were getting worse, then disappearing, but mostly nothing), I got this incredibly strong scene. 

I'm frustrated because I was very aware that I wanted to remember every second, but I've only got basics now. I was in an intense, but not negative, conversation with about 5 other people, 1 man, and 4 or 5 women. We were talking about something very important, which I think was about when and how to best harvest our vegetables. 

I've no idea why I know vegetables, not fruit, or just plants. 

We were on the edge of a relatively dusty field, last days of summer,  and it's such a cliche, we were wearing dark grey/black clothes,  with off-white collars. Not sure if they were cream or just grubby. We were a community/definitely went to the same church (I don't know how I know some of this, it wasn't  discussed,  I just knew). None of them were relatives of mine,  but 2 of the women were related I think. 

These are the queries I had whilst I was in the middle of it all,  the detail. 

It was a matter of seconds, except that it was a real as if it was the chat and coffee I had with a friend yesterday.

My initial thought was Amish.. no pilgrims.. no old England/Cromwell. The problem is, I have absolutely no previous interest, experience, or education to feed this dream. I mean, of course I know about all these groups, but I hate all things historical, I'm not living in either the US, or UK, and although I know my family lineage back to the 1400s, it's never included anything like this. No plain clothes,  no agriculture, no religious overtones. 

For context, I grew up in an Anglican/ protestant family, but culturally rather than devout. An extreme event in my teens pretty much put pay to any faith in anything, and especially in the past 20 years, I've been hard core atheist. 

I had a science-based career, and whilst I have no problem in trying different things such as the Reiki, I always work on the assumption that there is a scientific cause for any impact at all. I don't care how things are explained, or if it's just placebo, if it works, that's great.  

This has really spooked me, and I'm inclined to assume it's just a vivid dream, except the practitioner started talking and I could hear her and was frustrated because I wanted to be there longer,  try and commit it all to memory. I'm finding it really hard to ignore. I've never even had a night dream like this. My dreams are always based on reality, and often went I solve a family/ illness/ kid problem!

I'd welcome any thoughts or suggestions. I'm a little concerned about ever having Reiki again, even though it's always been really beneficial physically. I'm not scared exactly,  just... perturbed?

Quick background: me (single) and a married colleague developed a friendship last year, and it always felt like we were crossing an emotional boundary.

I had enough and told him that we needed to talk through our issues before I could be friends again. Surprisingly, he admitted the things he did wrong, and what he will do differently moving forward. 

Now we are friends and I'm just surprised at who he is. He is so much kinder, more attestation, responsive and...just so much more considerate.

------------------------------------------------------

Choosing the right furniture for your RV can make a world of difference in your living experience, and a recliner loveseat is an excellent option to consider. With its stylish comfort and compact size, it offers numerous advantages. Here’s why a recliner loveseat could be your ideal seating choice as you travel the open road.

### Space-Saving Style

One of the most significant advantages of a recliner loveseat is its ability to save space without sacrificing comfort. RVs come with limited square footage, and every inch counts. A loveseat, especially one that reclines, provides ample seating for two people while taking up less room than a standard sofa. This is particularly beneficial for couples or small families who want comfortable seating without overcrowding their living area.

### Comfort On The Go

When you're out exploring, comfort becomes essential. Recliner loveseats are designed for relaxation. They often feature padded cushions and adjustable reclining positions, allowing you to kick back after a long day of road tripping.

### Versatile Designs

Modern recliner loveseats come in a variety of styles and colors, making it easy to find one that fits your RV's aesthetic. Whether you prefer leather, cloth, or a blend of materials, there's something for everyone.

#### Styles and Features to Consider:

- **Material:** Choose between leather, fabric, or microfiber based on your preferences and lifestyle.

### Enhanced Functionality

In an RV, space needs to be utilized efficiently. Many recliner loveseats come with additional features that add to their functionality.

These features make your RV feel more like home, enhancing your overall experience as you travel.

### Creating a Cozy Atmosphere

Having a recliner loveseat in your RV is not just about comfort; it also contributes to a warm and inviting ambiance.

### Improved Social Interaction

By considering its space-saving features, comfort, easy maintenance, and the ability to create an inviting atmosphere, you can make your RV feel like a home away from home.

Top Features to Consider When Buying a Recliner Loveseat for Your RV
--------------------------------------------------------------------

Finding the perfect recliner loveseat for your RV can greatly enhance your travel experience. While you want something comfortable to relax on after a long day on the road, there are several essential features to consider to ensure that it fits your RV lifestyle seamlessly. Let’s explore the most important factors to keep in mind when making your selection.

Check Details Here: https://loveseatreclinerguide.com/recliner-loveseat-for-rv  
  
### Space Efficiency

When choosing a recliner loveseat for your RV, it's crucial to consider the available space. RVs typically have limited square footage, so look for compact designs that won't overwhelm your living area. Measure the dimensions of the space where you intend to place the loveseat. Ensure you leave enough room for movement and access to other furniture and appliances. A loveseat that folds flat or slides into a corner can maximize your available space without sacrificing comfort.

### Weight and Portability

Another factor to keep in mind is the weight of the recliner loveseat. Since RVs are often subject to weight limits, selecting a lighter model can make a significant difference. Look for loveseats made from lightweight materials that are still durable. Many manufacturers create recliner loveseats specifically designed for RVs with this in mind. A portable loveseat can be conveniently moved for cleaning or when reconfiguring your living space.

### Comfort and Ergonomics

Your comfort matters most when selecting a recliner loveseat. Ensure the seating is plush yet supportive. Look for features that enhance ergonomics, such as:

- **Adjustable Recline:** Opt for loveseats that offer multiple reclining positions. This allows various users to find their ideal relaxation angle.
- **Memory Foam:** Consider loveseats with memory foam cushions. They mold to your body, providing exceptional comfort during long trips.
- **Armrests:** Make sure the armrests are adequately padded, as this can enhance overall relaxation.

### Upholstery Material

The upholstery of the recliner loveseat should withstand the RV lifestyle. Choose materials that are both comfortable and durable. Popular options include:

- **Leather and Faux Leather:** Both materials are easy to clean and maintain, as spills can be wiped off quickly.
- **Fabric:** If you prefer fabric, look for options treated for stain resistance and durability, considering the movements and activities in an RV.
- **UV Resistance:** Choose materials with UV protection to avoid fading from sunlight, especially if you frequently park in sunny areas.

### Installation and Configuration

Take into account how easy it will be to install the recliner loveseat in your RV. Many models come with straightforward assembly instructions or are designed to fit snugly into RV layouts. Some loveseats might even incorporate built-in storage, offering a dual purpose. Additionally, check whether the loveseat requires any extra space when reclining. Understanding the mechanics of the recline feature is essential, as certain types may need more clearance than others.

### Style and Aesthetics

Your RV’s interior reflects your personal style, and the recliner loveseat should complement that. Consider the colors and patterns of the existing furnishings and select a loveseat that harmonizes with them. Popular trendy designs include contemporary looks or rustic styles that can enhance your RV's charm.

Check Details Here: https://loveseatreclinerguide.com/recliner-loveseat-for-rv  
  
### Budget Consideration

Always factor in your budget. Recliner loveseats come in various price ranges. While it's tempting to go for cheaper options, investing in a high-quality loveseat can save money in the long run due to durability. Look for sales or discounts from reputable brands or retailers that specialize in RV furniture.

By considering these essential features when purchasing a recliner loveseat for your RV, you can ensure that you find a product that offers comfort, style, and practicality. A well-chosen loveseat can become a cherished part of your camping adventures, making your time on the road even more enjoyable.

### Conclusion

Choosing a recliner loveseat for your RV can significantly enhance your camping experience, providing both comfort and style in a limited space. The benefits are plentiful; from maximizing utility with versatile seating to offering a cozy spot for relaxation after a day of adventure, a recliner loveseat can become your RV's centerpiece.

Yesterday he asked her if she would like to go out with him for coffee. Would this qualify as a date? 
Is se pehle he came and talked to her during a college event which was huge of him since hes an introvert. In our social circles, girls and guys dont hang out as friends unless the friendship is very deep/strong. One-on-ones with the opposite gender casually arent normalised with us yet (thankfully) 

So we suspect its a date, but like is it? only men can tell. So brothers help us girlies decode the intentions of this young man. 

To clarify, my friend said yes because 1) she has a crush on him 2) her intention is marriage lol. She had even told her mom about the guy before he asked her out and took her mothers permission to go with him. 

rn she's high in her delulu world and is probably imagining her wedding with him in her head haha. Don't think it's the right way to go about it kyunke larke ke intentions hi nai pata.

ON THE FIRST DAY I sprayed half a spray on the wrist OUTSIDE (because of previous advice) and it literally followed me into my room the entire house smelled like syrup. I got in the shower, scrubbed my hand, wasn’t gone so I did it again in the sink, seemed to work so I went to sleep, woke up and smelled STRAIGHT SYRUP. Got dressed for school and put ONE SPRAY on my wrist lasted the ENTIRE DAY with NUCLEAR projection like, walked in the class and everyone’s questioning why the room smelled like syrup all of a sudden. I love the coffee in this fragrance but the syrup is all people commented on. EVERY PERIOD OF THE DAY I walk in the class “why does it smell like syrup” ALL… DAY… my friends even said that it just lingers around me and it isn’t as strong on my wrist anymore. EASILY fills up every room you walk into, even teachers comment on it, one started asking people to wipe the tables because he thought someone spilled syrup. I love this fragrance and it smells great amazing. liking the smell of coffee and syrup is REQUIRED for this one.

Overall, smells great, nuclear silage is an UNDERSTATEMENT, will stay on your skin for a days if you let it, honestly it’s a worth it buy, just be careful as people WILL comment, not bad comments, but they often comment on the syrupy coffee-ish smell in the room, like a Starbucks.  

User note- one to two sprays max, doesn’t matter where you spray it. 
Do NOT get it on clothes or fabric, spray in an open area that’s ventilated.
