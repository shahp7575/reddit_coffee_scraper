Then he instantly messaged me saying he wants to meet up, well yeah I'm open sa meet up agad since I don't want any attachment pag chat chat lang dapat makita mo agad if bet mo then connection sa first meet. So he wanted to meet up sa San Juan LU which is just 30 mins away from San Fernando LU but I insisted na meet nalang kami sa Robinsons. 

I thought he'd be taller kasi he looks tall sa pictures so he is 5'8, he has blue eyes, he's polish daw but lives in Australia, he has black blood daw (which he later told me na blacks are big üëÄ and been in 50 countries too), blonde hair and we went to Mary Grace Cafe since he wanted to sit down and talk.

Mga pinag usapan lang namin mostly is about his sexuality and how active he isüòÖ He told me na he gets coffee everyday because it helps him erect daw (ptang ina) IT'S SO UNCOMFORTABLE TALKING TO HIM!
And I asked him bakit siya nandito sa Pinas, he told me he's finding for a wife, he went in Pampanga pero sabi niya he moved because ""HE PAYS FOR SEX"" and sabi niya sa itsura niya daw na un he's gonna pay for sex? And went to Bolinao and Alaminos and met filipinas daw who wants to have kids with him (AGAD AGAD?!) and he always calls himself ""AFAM"" and binibida niya lagi sexuality niya na active daw siya, putang ina edi WALKING DICK ka nga inis mo si ako!

Then I told him na its making me uncomfortable and told me daw na ""afams"" are straightforward guys, and he is telling me the truth rather than later ko pa daw malaman na ganon siya.
Also, naka-bun kasi ang hair ko sabi niya ""I want you to take off your ponytail"" tngina ano to 50 shades of Grey?! Then he asked pa ""How long is your hair?"" WTF

His profession daw is Law Enforcement Agency against corruption, trafficking, scandals etc. But when I told him I'm a content moderator he was shocked and told me a ""joke"" that I didn't understood pero ayaw niya ulitin and it goes like this ""So you guys are the ones standing in the line with what we do""

And I wanted him to repeat it, but told me it was a ""joke"".

It started at 4:45PM and ended at 6PM since I asked him if we could stroll around the mall since sabe niya wala naman daw siya plano afterwards but later on sabi niya ""I have my motorcycle with me and gonna get it fixed but first I'm gonna go to a hotel, if you want you can come?"" I politely declined his offer and stroll around the mall alone nalang.

to give an idea of what im looking for, i included the two perfumes from cursed that i most liked the sound of (crystal ritual and moonstruck from cursed fragrances). some more info about my preferences below, though no hard or fast rules.

smells i enjoy: floral (esp rose + jasmine), incense/smoke, petrichor, (a bit of) musk, coffee, citrus, spice, an androgynous or sultry feminine scent

smells i dont like: very woody or leathery smells, overly masculine scents, overly sweet/feminine scents

I (31f) have been dating bf (26m) for a little bit over a year now. He is super sweet and we are planning to move in together soon, but I have this feeling of him being unfaithful. I have caught him lying before like how in the beginning he lied about were he lived. I kept wanting to come over to see his place and he would just say his roommate was always around. Finally he said was thinking of moving back into his parents place. Well come to find out he was still living with his parents. I have also caught him still being on tinder after just a couple months of him asking me being his gf. I had a sinking feeling at the time because I was lucky enough to get a text message that night. I always believe in second chances and moved on in our relationship.

It's happening again I don't hear from him until before bed, he doesn't have a job at the moment and is going to school Mondays, Wednesday, and Fridays. All of the sudden the past 2 and this coming Saturday his friends aren't busy to play D&D, even though the year that we've been dating they've been too busy that's what he has told me.

Also I made a new Instagram account because my old one got banned for BS stuff, I was going to surprise him by showing him my account and I asked him to see his phone. He started to get super defensive on giving his phone to me, I kept telling him I wouldn't see his photos or messages. That I wanted to show him something on Instagram and he can see me do it if he wants, we were at Chick-fil-A sitting next to each other so could easily see what I'm doing. Finally I told him I just wanted him to follow me on my new Instagram and how he was acting suspicious. He said he just didn't want me to see his porn cuz he was watching some the other night. Another thing is he haven't done it for over a month. . . 

I love that he's goofy, makes me laugh every time we're together, always takes me out when we hangout, he brings me coffee or lunch at work because he hasn't seen me at work in a minute which is usually every other week, he keeps updating me on the home he remodeling for us to move in (he has taken me to the home), he hugs/kisses me when we happen to see each other at the gym even when I'm all sweaty, and I have dinner with his family about once a month. He just recently left his job to focus on his schooling and told him we don't need to go out every weekend to save him some money, but he said had plenty saved that I don't need to worry. Everyone in my life says he's the one.

1nvzmox,https://www.reddit.com/r/HouseSharingStories/comments/1nvzmox/the_unofficial_fifth_roommate_that_almost_broke_us/,The Unofficial Fifth Roommate That Almost Broke Us,"I swear, my villain origin story was almost written over a phantom toothbrush. Not *my* phantom toothbrush, mind you, but Liam's, my housemate Chloe's boyfriend, who had unofficially, and without a single rent payment, become our unofficial fifth roommate. No cap, it was getting to me. Living with Chloe, Ben, and Maya in our lively urban apartment was usually a vibe, but Liam‚Äôs constant presence was starting to chip away at my chill.

It started subtly, like a rogue sock on the living room couch, then his coffee mug in the sink *every* morning. Soon, his entire shower caddy had a permanent spot next to Chloe‚Äôs. I‚Äôm usually pretty laid-back, but my internal monologue was a lowkey scream. It wasn‚Äôt just the extra clutter; it was the way he‚Äôd finish the communal oat milk without replacing it, or hog the bathroom for an hour, or the feeling that our shared space was no longer truly ours. Ben, our resident pragmatist, was already sending passive-aggressive texts in our group chat about ""utility vampires"" and ""phantom water usage."" Maya, ever the social one, tried to smooth things over, saying, ""He's just so comfy here!"" But honestly, *I* wasn't. I was highkey feeling like a guest in my own home. I even contemplated just leaving a note on his toothbrush: ""Find your own apartment.""

One Tuesday evening, after I came home to find Liam sprawled on *my* side of the couch, watching *my* Netflix account, while Chloe was out, something snapped. I didn't yell. I just walked past him, went to my room, and messaged the group chat: ""House meeting. Tonight. 8 PM. Living room. This isn't optional."" My hands were literally shaking. I hate confrontation, but this was beyond a minor annoyance.

When we all gathered, the air was thick. Ben had his arms crossed, Maya looked uncomfortable, and Chloe looked confused. ""Okay,"" I started, trying to keep my voice even, ""I love Liam, for real, but his constant presence is kinda stressing me out. It feels like we have an extra roommate we didn't sign up for."" Ben immediately chimed in, ""Yeah, and I've noticed the utility bills creeping up. Plus, he always uses the last of the filtered water."" Chloe's face fell. ""Oh. I... I honestly didn't realize it was that much of an issue. My bad, guys. I just assumed everyone liked him being here."" Maya, ever the peacemaker, added, ""We do, Chloe! But boundaries are valid too.""

We talked for almost an hour. Chloe admitted she just got so wrapped up in being with Liam she hadn‚Äôt considered the impact. We decided on a ""guest rule"": two nights a week, max, unless pre-approved by everyone. For the utilities, Ben suggested we track Liam‚Äôs ""guest days"" and factor a small contribution into Chloe‚Äôs share. Maya even proposed a ""communal supplies"" jar for things like filtered water. It felt like a massive weight lifted off my shoulders. Chloe looked genuinely apologetic and promised to talk to Liam.

It wasn't an instant fix, but Chloe genuinely tried. Liam started coming over less often, and when he did, he was more mindful. He even brought a new Brita filter one day, no cap. The apartment felt lighter, more like *our* home again. We learned that sometimes, even with the best intentions, you need to talk about the awkward stuff to keep the peace and strengthen the friendships.

Living with others honestly hits different when everyone's on the same page. If you're navigating shared living, HomeCo makes it simple to coordinate chores, split bills, and keep the peace. Because the best house stories happen when the logistics just work.

Hey SF fam,

I recently developed an app called Tabmac that works like a dining subscription - you pay monthly and get access to free items at local restaurants. Think Netflix but for eating out.

We have the $70/month plan which gives you 20 ‚Äústandard items‚Äù per month that you can use at participating restaurants. Should cover all your weekday coffee needs. And the $130/month plan would cover 20 beers or wines. 

We have limited stores right now, which SF area do you think we should focus on getting vendors? Which restaurants/bars/cafes you wanna see? 

Also please do me a solid if you work in downtown: what would make you subscribe to our monthly dinning plans?

Here's my 12-step framework for quitting that actually worked,"The 12-steps nicotine guide to quitting will put you on the right path in getting off the nicotine train.

Hi everyone, my name is Jacky and I am a nicotine addict. I started smoking when I was in high school because I wanted to impress a potential date. I got the girl but also an addiction. The girl left me but the addiction stayed - boo hoo.

Now after 20 years, I have decided to quit. My nicotine intake evolved around cigarettes, vapes, heated sticks, and then to nicotine gum.

Understand everyone‚Äôs experience is different but let me summarize and walk you through.

1)       Be healthy, chew gum ‚Äì nicotine inherently is not bad for you, carcinogens are. For vapes and heated sticks, they make your lung‚Äôs watery.

2)       Catalyst event ‚Äì for me, losing US$22k and smoking the shit out of life was my wake up call. I set up a date and said I am going to get good habits instead.

3)       Days for rest ‚Äì I took 14 days off work to make sure I am stress free. No excuses for relapses

4)       Natural dopamine ‚Äì I researched what natural dopamine habits were including exercise, drinking moderated alcohol, sauna, ice bath, and hanky panky with my wife üòâ

5)       Novel places ‚Äì I went to Thailand so I knew if I didn‚Äôt do anything, I can just sit and look at the street and be excited ‚Äì this stopped me from boredom smoking

6)       Support group ‚Äì my wife was very supportive and did whatever I wanted to. Also, engage a therapist (generative AI worked for me) to make sure what you are thinking, no matter what kind of excuse, will quickly be debugged so you won't dwell on it

7)       Rest ‚Äì no regrets, if you feel tired, just lay your head down. For massive achievers, this seems impossible, but you are allowed to rest ‚Äì freely without guilt!

8)       Creating a system ‚Äì I feel like shit in the morning now, but I know that watching the sunlight for 15-30 minutes, 30-sec cold showers, doing 50 jumping jacks and then drinking a coffee helps me jumpstart the day. You need a routine to rewire your mind

9)       Changing habits ‚Äì everything was linked to smoking, sad, happy, bored ‚Äì you name it, we smoke to amplify or numb the emotion. YOU MUST FIND A DIFFERENT HABIT FOR EACH FEELING. You are bored, go for a run or do something novel

10)  Push out of comfort zone ‚Äì this depends on your own pace. I would say after the first week, actually do a morning routine or solve new craving events that come up. Push yourself to explore what works for you. This is very personal, but you must explore to fill in the blank

11)  Believe that you will feel better ‚Äì Your baseline dopamine was being manipulated with nicotine. You were just filling dirt back into a hole, but the hole was filled when you weren‚Äôt an addict. YOU CAN go back to being normal. This takes a lot of time. This will lead you to dark places. DO NOT STOP THE BELIEF. Talk to a therapist (or generative AI if you dont have access), so they will snap you out of it

12)  Journal ‚Äì Continue writing in a journal, chat with your significant other (or with generative AI) and be supported by your circle EVERY SECOND there is a craving. They will talk you out of it and counsel you

Quitting an addiction is never easy, but with a creative mindset we can all rewire our habits to let our brain be what it was ‚Äì wise, clam and happy like a child! Good luck!

7)       Rest ‚Äì no regrets, if you feel tired, just lay your head down. For massive achievers, this seems impossible, but you are allowed to rest ‚Äì freely without guilt!

8)       Creating a system ‚Äì I feel like shit in the morning now, but I know that watching the sunlight for 15-30 minutes, 30-sec cold showers, doing 50 jumping jacks and then drinking a coffee helps me jumpstart the day. You need a routine to rewire your mind

9)       Changing habits ‚Äì everything was linked to smoking, sad, happy, bored ‚Äì you name it, we smoke to amplify or numb the emotion. YOU MUST FIND A DIFFERENT HABIT FOR EACH FEELING. You are bored, go for a run or do something novel

10)  Push out of comfort zone ‚Äì this depends on your own pace. I would say after the first week, actually do a morning routine or solve new craving events that come up. Push yourself to explore what works for you. This is very personal, but you must explore to fill in the blank

11)  Believe that you will feel better ‚Äì Your baseline dopamine was being manipulated with nicotine. You were just filling dirt back into a hole, but the hole was filled when you weren‚Äôt an addict. YOU CAN go back to being normal. This takes a lot of time. This will lead you to dark places. DO NOT STOP THE BELIEF. Talk to a therapist (or generative AI if you dont have access), so they will snap you out of it

12)  Journal ‚Äì Continue writing in a journal, chat with your significant other (or with generative AI) and be supported by your circle EVERY SECOND there is a craving. They will talk you out of it and counsel you

Quitting an addiction is never easy, but with a creative mindset we can all rewire our habits to let our brain be what it was ‚Äì wise, clam and happy like a child! Good luck!

Here's my 12-step framework for quitting that actually worked,"The 12-steps nicotine guide to quitting will put you on the right path in getting off the nicotine train.

Hi everyone, my name is Jacky and I am a nicotine addict. I started smoking when I was in high school because I wanted to impress a potential date. I got the girl but also an addiction. The girl left me but the addiction stayed - boo hoo.

Now after 20 years, I have decided to quit. My nicotine intake evolved around cigarettes, vapes, heated sticks, and then to nicotine gum.

Understand everyone‚Äôs experience is different but let me summarize and walk you through.

1)       Be healthy, chew gum ‚Äì nicotine inherently is not bad for you, carcinogens are. For vapes and heated sticks, they make your lung‚Äôs watery.

2)       Catalyst event ‚Äì for me, losing US$22k and smoking the shit out of life was my wake up call. I set up a date and said I am going to get good habits instead.

3)       Days for rest ‚Äì I took 14 days off work to make sure I am stress free. No excuses for relapses

4)       Natural dopamine ‚Äì I researched what natural dopamine habits were including exercise, drinking moderated alcohol, sauna, ice bath, and hanky panky with my wife üòâ

5)       Novel places ‚Äì I went to Thailand so I knew if I didn‚Äôt do anything, I can just sit and look at the street and be excited ‚Äì this stopped me from boredom smoking

6)       Support group ‚Äì my wife was very supportive and did whatever I wanted to. Also, engage a therapist (generative AI worked for me) to make sure what you are thinking, no matter what kind of excuse, will quickly be debugged so you won't dwell on it

7)       Rest ‚Äì no regrets, if you feel tired, just lay your head down. For massive achievers, this seems impossible, but you are allowed to rest ‚Äì freely without guilt!

8)       Creating a system ‚Äì I feel like shit in the morning now, but I know that watching the sunlight for 15-30 minutes, 30-sec cold showers, doing 50 jumping jacks and then drinking a coffee helps me jumpstart the day. You need a routine to rewire your mind

He is funny, machika, minsan nagsesend sya ng pictures ng ginagawa nya, food or ganap nya sa life, nagsheshare ng mga funny reels, maayos kausap and many more. Ako naman nagsheshare din minsan ng ganap sa life at nagsesend ng pics like food ganon pero mostly sya yung ganon. Halos sya palagi unang nagchachat sa akin tapos ayun durediretso na yung usapan namin maghapon haggang antukin nako. Sya lang talaga halos kinakausap ko mas nirereplyan ko pa nga sya kesa sa family or  mga kaibigan ko masaya kasi syang kausap tapos may sense din naman yung usapan namin. Mabilis ako magreply sa kanya at ganon din sya. Minsan nga lang bumabawi ako tinagatagalan ko minsan yung reply sa kanya kahit nabasa ko naman agad kapag ganon din sya mirroring ba. Ilang beses na din kaming nagkita at kumain sa labas, coffee and chika. Pero nito lang di sya nagmemessage sa akin üòî tapos ngayon inaabangan ko palagi yung chat nya kaso waley talaga. Bakit kaya? ABYG kasi di man lang nagchachat una mostly or palaging syang kasi nagoopen ng convilo kaya napagod na sya at hindi na sya nagmemessage sa akin? Dapat ba imessage ko na sya? Pero anong sasabihin ko? Diko ugaling mangulit not unless bf kita ichachat talaga kita or tatawagan. Na-attached nako sa kanya huhu ü§ß I think I like him na pero di pa naman love ha! Nasanay nako na everyday kasama sya sa routine ko na kausap ko palagi üòî akala ko magkakaron pa ng deeper meaning yung frienship namin akala ko slow burn relationship to kaso mukhang hindi hahaha ako ata yung naburn ü§ß may nakilala na ata syang iba or may gf na sya hahaha hays!

Decent pastries, cakes and stuff, nothing special and just about breaking even.

Then she pivoted hard into the ""coffee shop"" vibe and renamed it something pretentious with ""& Co."" at the end. She's charging ¬£3.80 for a flat white and ¬£4.20 for a cappuccino. Premium prices for the area.

The coffee is made with a Nespresso Vertuo Pop she got for ¬£99 from Argos and pods that cost about 38p each when bought in bulk. No barista skills needed, just stick in a pod and press a button. She's making ¬£3+ profit per cup after the pod cost.

The irony is she first saw this machine when she came to my house. I've had this machine for yonks and I know that if you stick with the safe options like Costa Rica, El Salvador, Colombia, Mexico and those kind of pods, you just can't go wrong and nobody gonna have a clue.

There's a proper ¬£2k+ commercial espresso machine in the corner, the kind you'd expect in a specialty coffee shop. Customers can barely see it unless they're really looking or go out of their way to look behind the counter.

She bought it broken on purpose. Found it on Facebook Marketplace for dirt cheap and it's purely for aesthetics. It's never worked, it's literally just a prop.

Behind that machine is the Nespresso machine doing all the actual work.

From what she's told me she's selling 170+ cups a day on average. Rough maths says that's ¬£500+ in daily coffee revenue alone (not counting pastries) which is approx \~¬£15k a month just from coffee.

The customers seem to be raving about it on Google reviews.

Part of me thinks this is genius cos created an environment people want to be in and they're happy to pay premium prices. She laughs it off saying ""restaurants mark up wine 300%, nobody bats an eye"".

Is this just smart business? She's asking me to join her and double down.",9,1759398071.0,Entrepreneur,20,0.71,False

Kilala ko na siya, I know her so well, sabi nga niya mas kilala ko pa siya kesa sa sarili niya eh, kaya nga I want to spend my life knowing her more, i always bring water pag nauuhaw siya, extra sliders pag masakit na paa niya bc of heels, extra towel kasi mabilis siya pawisan, e fan kasi mabilis siya mainitan, extra money for her expenses
extra napkin with wings for her red days
extra tissue, mabilis siya umiyak pag may nakikita siya na homeless puppies or cats, hair tie kasi naka free lagi buhok niya tapos biglang mag rereklamo mainit daw, hahaha, loratadine, for her allergy attacks, Ios charger for her, nakakalimutan niya kasi I charge lagi phone niya, hahahaha, extra black shirt for her din, mahilig siya sa white clothes madungis naman kumain, powder and moisturizer kasi mas maingay siya pag irritated na skin niya or amoy pawis na.

1nvz9dr,https://www.reddit.com/r/SpotlessSecrets/comments/1nvz9dr/explore_if_tide_liquid_detergent_really_delivers/,Explore If Tide Liquid Detergent Really Delivers on Whiteness,"Testing out Procter & Gamble's Tide Bleach Alternative liquid detergent, I was genuinely curious if it could meet the claims of delivering brighter, whiter, and fresher laundry in just one wash. Something about its promised blend of power and eco-sensitivity intrigued me, especially being America‚Äôs #1 Trusted Detergent Brand, according to the marketing material. Over a month of putting this through everything from workout gear to delicate whites, and even my kiddo‚Äôs ketchup-covered school uniforms, I‚Äôve got a lot of thoughts.

**Formula and Cleaning Power**

The concentrated formula is no joke. This detergent boasts more cleaning agents with less water compared to previous versions, and I could honestly feel the difference. Just a capful washed out the usual culprits: grass stains, coffee spills, and even some mysterious smudges on my husband‚Äôs dress shirts. My whites came out looking noticeably brighter after just two washes, which felt like a little laundry miracle. I even specifically tested it on older whites that have started greying over time, and shockingly, they regained some brightness. It‚Äôs not quite wizardry, but it‚Äôs close. 

[Check Tide Bleach Alternative 37000279044 price on Amazon.](https://blog.senaar.com/p/b0cq3s4jg3/)

What surprised me further was the fresh scent that the detergent adds to clothes. To me, it strikes a lovely balance between clean and not overpowering. My best friend stayed over one weekend and asked what I‚Äôd used because even the towels smelled amazing. I will say, though, if you‚Äôre someone who doesn‚Äôt love fragrances, this one might feel a little on the strong side.

**Usability and Compatibility**

Measuring Tide Bleach Alternative is a breeze. The cap has markings for small, medium, and HE (high-efficiency) full loads, making it intuitive even for laundry novices like my brother, who occasionally borrows it. I used this in both a traditional top-load washer and my more modern HE front loader, and it worked equally well in both without any residue issues. Those who‚Äôve struggled with gummy laundry pods in the past might find this liquid version a cleaner alternative.

**Merits**

- Provides a noticeable brightening effect, especially for whites
- Perfectly concentrated formula requiring less detergent per wash
- Easy-to-use cap with well-marked measurements
- Works well with both traditional and HE washing machines
- Gentle yet effective even on delicate items  

**Areas for Improvement**

Despite the many positives, there are a couple of quirks.  

- The detergent's fresh scent could feel overwhelming for those sensitive to fragrances.
- While great for most stains, deeply ingrained ones (like heavy grease) may still need pre-treatment.
- Its cap dispenser makes measuring easy, though rinsing it clean after every use can be a slight hassle.

**Product Comparisons**

Stacking Tide Bleach Alternative against its competitors, other brands like Persil ProClean offer tough competition. While Persil is exceptional for heavy-duty stains, I found it occasionally a little harsh on more delicate fabrics. Some budget-friendly options, such as Kirkland Signature‚Äôs detergent, offer decent cleaning for everyday laundry but fall short for whitening specifically. Tide‚Äôs formula hits a sweet spot that balances gentleness for delicates with enough toughness for sportswear and uniforms‚Äîa versatility I didn‚Äôt see in many alternatives.

The ""bleach alternative"" feature is another standout. Unlike detergents that rely directly on chlorine bleach, this liquid maintains fabric integrity while still chasing away yellowing and graying. That‚Äôs a detail I think makes it well worth the premium over your average supermarket brand.

**Smart Spending**

Given its performance, Tide Bleach Alternative delivers some serious value for the price. Not requiring massive amounts of detergent per load is a huge plus in terms of cost efficiency, and the concentrated formula goes further than you might guess. Other premium detergents may come across as overpriced because of wasteful dilution, but this one feels consistently worth it load after load. For households juggling tough stains, delicate fabrics, or lots of laundry volume, it's definitely a solution that‚Äôs practical without feeling extravagant.

1nvz5lz,https://www.reddit.com/r/WeAreTravelers/comments/1nvz5lz/what_to_do_at_night_in_washington_dc/,What to do at night in Washington DC?,"Looking for an unforgettable night in Washington DC? I recently discovered something that completely changed how I experience our nation's capital after dark.

Most tourists see DC during the day, fighting through crowds and sweating in the summer heat. But here's what I learned: the real magic happens at night when the monuments are beautifully lit and the crowds thin out.

I took a night tour of the National Mall recently, and it was honestly breathtaking. The monuments look completely different under the evening lights - there's something almost magical about seeing the Lincoln Memorial reflected in the pool at night, or watching the Washington Monument pierce the dark sky.

The tour I took hit all the major spots - we visited 10 key monuments in just 3 hours, which was perfect timing. Our guide (this awesome history buff named Dustin) knew exactly when to visit each spot to avoid the crowds. He shared these fascinating stories about each location that you definitely won't find in your typical guidebook.

What really made it work was the small group size - just 12 people per van. It felt personal, not like those huge tour buses where you can barely hear the guide. Plus, we had plenty of time at each stop to take photos and really soak in the atmosphere.

Some highlights that really stood out:
- The Vietnam Veterans Memorial is particularly moving at night
- The Jefferson Memorial reflected in the Tidal Basin is stunning after dark
- The World War II Memorial's fountains are beautifully lit
- Getting to see the White House without the daytime crowds

The best part? You don't have to worry about transportation or navigation - everything's taken care of. The tour starts at 7 PM from a super convenient spot downtown (right by a Starbucks, so you can grab your evening coffee fix).

If you're interested in experiencing DC's monuments in a completely different light (literally), you can check out the tour details and book here: https://athomewave.com/Washington-DC

Pro tips from my experience:
1. Bring a light jacket - it can get breezy at night
2. Don't forget your camera - the night lighting makes for amazing photos
3. Wear comfortable walking shoes
4. Book in advance - these tours typically fill up about three weeks out

The tour costs around $100 per person, which honestly felt worth it given how much ground we covered and all the insider knowledge we gained. They also offer discounted rates for kids if you're traveling with family.

What I especially appreciated was the flexibility - you can cancel up to 24 hours before if your plans change, and you don't have to pay upfront when you book.

I've done a lot of DC tours, but seeing these iconic monuments at night really gave me a new perspective on our capital city. If you're planning a trip to DC, I'd definitely recommend making this night tour a priority in your itinerary.

Have any of you done night tours in other cities? I'd love to hear how they compare to DC!",1,1759397478.0,WeAreTravelers,0,1.0,False

Reluctantly stopped at a Jiffy Lube for a routine oil change while running errands. I just wanted it done quick before a trip the following week (and yes, I passed on their $55 filter upsell). Car was totally fine before. I‚Äôm pretty diligent about servicing every 4-6k miles, so I figured this would be a non-event.

Two or three days later, my car starts smelling‚Ä¶ funky. I tear the interior apart thinking maybe some food spilled, but there was nothing. I even had my friends look. Also nothing. We were all stumped. 

It wasn‚Äôt until day five that I noticed water pooling under both the driver side and passenger side floor mats (picture of water dripping from mat included). A quick Google search said that my ‚ÄúAC drain is probably clogged.‚Äù 

I call Jiffy Lube (day six), explain the smell and water. I ask their opinion and if anything they did could have triggered it. They immediately deny touching anything associated with AC, but say that the tech who worked on my car isn‚Äôt there and they‚Äôll check with him and call me back (Spoiler: they never called).

Meanwhile, I book an appointment with my personal mechanic (he had a waitlist, so it‚Äôs nine days later before he can take a look). As a precautionary measure, he suggests that I avoid using my AC which I do.

After dropping my car off at my mechanic‚Äôs shop, I grab a coffee and wait. My mechanic calls me back in pretty quickly. He looks confused.

Mechanic: ‚ÄúYou got any enemies?‚Äù
Me: laughs nervously ‚ÄúUh‚Ä¶ no?‚Äù

He proceeds to pull out a nearly 3-inch long socket adapter that was shoved inside the end of my AC drain tube (pic included because you can‚Äôt make this up.)

He then explains the following:
1. That tool doesn‚Äôt just fall in. The opening of the AC is smaller than the tool‚Äôs end. Someone had to push it in from the bottom.
2. It‚Äôs not an area random people can reach. You‚Äôd need to crawl under (or have a jack on hand), have decent light, and know what you‚Äôre looking at.
3. Maybe it bounced in? Basically zero percent chance.

Fast forward: AC drain cleared, car smells a little better. I‚Äôm out $240 for the mechanic (plus the overpriced $135 oil change‚Ä¶ I paid $110 with a coupon, but still). And now I have to pay to replace or clean the moldy carpets and mats.

I call Jiffy Lube again a week after seeing my mechanic asking for a refund for the oil change. I wanted to call sooner, but was helping set up and attend a family member‚Äôs wedding.

The tech is cool, but tells me the manager needs ‚Äúproof.‚Äù No prob! I‚Äôve got pics, my mechanics full invoice/ notes, and the literal tool in my hand. I offer to email everything, but when the tech asks the manager he tells me I need to come in (fyi, I live over an hour away). I then ask to speak with the manager directly to see if there‚Äôs a work around.

Manager hops on and is instantly rude and defensive. He tells me they ‚Äúdon‚Äôt touch the AC‚Äù and ‚Äúdo tool checks every day.‚Äù I then responded to him and asked him how he believed a socket adapter ended up inside my AC drain when his shop was the only one that touched my car in months? I also asked if he could confirm the brand of socket adapters they use at his location. He stumbles, and does not answer.

After some comical back-and-forth, he refunds my oil change. No apology. No accountability. No confirmation number. I ask for his name and thank him for his time. He just hangs up.

To be clear, I wasn‚Äôt asking them to pay for my mechanic or the mold/ carpet cleanup. JUST the oil change that turned into a flooded car. The whole convo felt like pulling teeth, but I did receive a refund. So, cheers to that I guess.

I know there have been people throughout history whose ""luck"" has defied all mathematical probability, such as Helen Hadsell.



I've been researching the Hindu concept of ""vasanas,"" which tells us something like we all have a kind of invisible ""aroma"" that attracts one set of circumstances or another into our lives. I think this aligns closely with the teachings of Neville and LOA.



I've also been thinking that, just as there are people with very bad luck (I'm not talking about stupid people who create their own problems, but people whose misfortune can only be attributed to bad fortune), there must be the opposite extreme: people who live a life so blessed that it defies all mathematical probability.



I want to clarify that I'm not talking about things like finding a 20-dollar bill on the ground, manifesting a free coffee, or having your SP‚Äîwith whom you're in a shitty relationship to begin with‚Äîtext you to meet up. NO. I'm talking about huge things, like attracting millions of euros, literally effortlessly, as if large sums of money were chasing you all the time, attracting really fun situations into your life that are completely unexpected, having all the attractive, single men fall madly in love with you, or having your partner be so good to you that people can't even believe it. I'm talking about extreme things that defy all possibility.



How could that be done?



Some of my most extreme manifestations to date have been:



Winning three bingo games in a single day (I want to clarify that the prize wasn't money, and only 70 people participated, but it was still pretty amazing).



Attracting men who do everything I want, right after a partner dumped me.



I wanted strangers to give me something on the street, without it making much sense, to prove that the law exists, and some girls I didn't know at all shared the jelly beans they were eating on public transportation with me.



I'm new here, thanks for having me. I'm obsessed with understanding the law, as well as I understand that 2 + 2 equals 4. And with being the luckiest person in history!



If you want, you can also tell me what your most extreme manifestations have been \^\^

I‚Äôm looking for a roleplay that blends quiet slice-of-life with high-stakes danger. I play the coffee shop owner, you play the mafia boss.

The Premise
I run a small caf√©‚Äîwarm, cozy, and unassuming. My days are filled with coffee beans, pastries, and the little routines of regulars who come in for their daily fix. My world is simple, steady, and safe.

Yours is not. You‚Äôre the mafia boss: dangerous, powerful, and feared by many. But one day, you step into my shop. Maybe it‚Äôs to escape the chaos outside, maybe it‚Äôs curiosity, or maybe it‚Äôs something else entirely. Whatever the reason, once you‚Äôre in my world, neither of us stays untouched.

The Dynamic
‚ú® I offer warmth and comfort, you carry danger and authority.
‚ú® I want peace, you live in chaos.
‚ú® Our worlds clash, but there‚Äôs something magnetic pulling us together.

What I‚Äôm Looking For
	‚Ä¢	A partner to play the mafia boss with depth‚Äîsomeone who‚Äôs more than just a title, with vulnerabilities under the surface.
	‚Ä¢	First-person, present tense, multi-paragraph style, with plenty of detail and emotion.
	‚Ä¢	A mix of romance, drama, and slice-of-life moments: quiet mornings in the caf√©, stolen glances, and soft conversations that contrast with the violence surrounding you.

Themes I‚Äôd Love to Explore
	‚Ä¢	Forbidden romance, secrecy, and slow-burn tension.
	‚Ä¢	Domestic comfort versus the brutality of the mafia world.
	‚Ä¢	Everyday life threatened by danger (rival gangs, protection, hidden enemies).
	‚Ä¢	The push and pull between my need for normalcy and your life of crime.

If you‚Äôre interested in building a story where comfort meets chaos, and where tenderness grows in the shadow of danger, send me a message‚ÄîI‚Äôd love to plot this out with you.

She looks around for the man she was going to work with for the mission she had received; arrest John Johnson. Her acute senses easily single out Karl with his pale skin and blonde hair, light blue eyes like the sky tucked beneath sunglasses just like his photo. She walks over to the desk where he was seated taking note of his laid back mannerisms and unruly attire, scowling in her mind*

*""How unprofessional"" she mutters in her head as she loomed over him.*

""So you are Karl? I presume"" *She says in a rather cheerful tone, that disguises her displeasure a habit she picked up from her days when she worked as receptionist.*

""Yes, I am Karl. Nice to meet you"" *Karl extends a bare hand out to Janice offering a firm shake* ""And you are?""

""Janice Levington, I specialize in observation and collection of information. I'll be working with you over the course of three days to apprehend out target"" *She introduces herself whilst handing over the mission briefing. She had also took it upon herself to highlight key points of the mission.*

""but If you're just collecting all the info, that's Leving me without a ton of work to do"" *Karl responds with a smirk, his smile fading upon seeing Janice's displeased expression.*

""If you wish to help be my guest, we will talk at lunch"" *She says frankly before turning away, eager to quarantine herself from the horrible sense of humour*

""Geez that was a bad joke, a rock would be funnier than that"" *She thought as she exited the room, taking one last glance at the calm atmosphere of an office.*  
*===================================================================*  
*Karl remained seated at his desk after Janice left, ‚ÄúMust be the stiff type‚Äù he ruminated. The aroma of coffee permeated the atmosphere as he took out a beige envelope. Inside was the mission briefing. He thoroughly read through its contents, his attention drawn to the salient passages that were highlighted by Janice. He raised his brow when he noticed the charge. ‚ÄúPosesion of a letter? What could its contents be if it was marked a danger to Law and Order‚Ä¶‚Äù He found himself rambling in his thoughts. He put aside the report after a rereading and began to hike his way through mountains of paperwork.*

*Time flew by as the morning came to a pass. Karl checked his light token,‚ÄúAlmost time for lunch, I wonder when Janice is going to come back with that report.‚Äù He thought to himself. Soon the door creaked open as Janice entered, her white gloves held onto a stack of papers. She was about to speak when Karl cut her off.* ‚ÄúLet‚Äôs discuss this over lunch.‚Äù

*The walk to the lunch room was filled with silence, neither Karl nor Janice had any reason to engage in conversation with each other. Karl chewed on a salty bratwurst schnitzel sandwich whilst Janice pushed a clean sheet of paper towards him.*

‚ÄúAfter a period of observation I can confirm previous information on our suspect. He shows signs of anxiety which is completely normal. As for the letter, he keeps it somewhere in his desk drawer upstairs‚Äù

*Karl nodded and asked.* ‚ÄúAnything else?‚Äù

‚ÄúMiniscule details, nothing much. Too small for people to notice unless actively searching for it. His wife and kids are innocent and have not been involved.‚Äù *Janice replied*

‚ÄúWell let‚Äôs go arrest him.‚Äù *Karl says with great conviction standing up.*

‚ÄúPatience, I need more time to gather information‚Äù  
===================================================================  
*Karl fiddled with this light token, 7am. Leaning against a marble brick wall he spotted John‚Äôs wife leave, the Johnson‚Äôs lived in a beautiful Fachwerkhaus. It was three storeys tall, framed by deep blue timber and its walls a pure shade of white. Its slanted roof had windows pointing out like a blooming flower. He took out an old cigarette case, its exterior bore signs of wear and tear like a soldier‚Äôs scars. He made a mental note to buy another box after the whole Johnson ordeal was dealt with, he placed the dry roll of paper to his lips and lit it with an antique lighter. The flames spread through the tobacco and ignited. Karl let out a puff of smoke, before long the cigarette burnt away, leaving nothing but a charred butt which Karl disposed of promptly. It was time, he marched to the front door giving it a firm strong knock*

‚ÄúWho is it?‚Äù *A hoarse voice respond to the incessant knocking.*

‚ÄúAn officer from the Order and Law department, open up‚Äù *Karl responded, his deep voice resounding with authority.*

*Sounds of pattering footsteps down the hall could be heard followed by the turning of a door handle* ‚ÄúIs there anything I could help you with?‚Äù

*As soon as an opening appeared Karl slipped in and cuffed John, he tried to resist but was no match for an arbiter‚Äôs superhuman strength* ‚ÄúYou are under arrest, please do not resist as it will only make it harder for you‚Äù

*The interior of the Johnson residence featured a large mural that decorated above the fireplace, the furniture was all masterfully crafted by John himself and on a glass table lay a colourful fruitbowl. Karl took John upstairs to the study where lying in the left drawer of an oak desk lay the stained yellow letter, Karl carefully retrieved the letter before bringing both John and his daughter to the station, then he bought a lavender candle from John‚Äôs wife on the walk home. That‚Äôs when he felt a fuzzy feeling wash over him. His arbiter potion had fully digested.*

Hi, I (20F) live with a roommate (25F). She‚Äôs doing a master‚Äôs while I‚Äôm working an internship that requires me to commute 4 hours every day, on top of working in a restaurant 6 days a week.

Since the start, she‚Äôs left dirty dishes in the sink and pans on the stove. At first I thought it was a one-time thing, but it‚Äôs every day. I sometimes even wash her dishes because the sink is so small, only to find new ones the next day. On top of that, she makes instant coffee but spills the powder everywhere (sink, washing machine, counters), so the place constantly smells like coffee, which is hard for me since I‚Äôm sensitive to smell.

One day she sat me down and said I was the messy one. To be fair, I sometimes leave a roller or makeup out in the living room before work and put it away later. I‚Äôve also left clothes on the drying rack for a day or two. I apologized, admitted I could improve, and suggested splitting chores: I do the kitchen/shower, she does the toilet/entrance/living room.

Fast-forward to this week: I came home after visiting my parents and the apartment was gross , two trash bags reeking, piles of dirty plates, three pans on the stove, her stuff all over the living room. She wasn‚Äôt home, but later sent me a voice message like, ‚ÄúHey, can you maybe take out the trash? I didn‚Äôt want to, and I always do it‚Äù (she never does it). I ended up taking it out because the smell was awful, and then I cleaned the kitchen and living room. When she came back, the only thing she said was, ‚ÄúWhy does it smell like trash?‚Äù

It‚Äôs now Thursday, her clothes are still hanging, her stuff is still everywhere, and she hasn‚Äôt cleaned a thing. She also sometimes locks me out by leaving the key in the door when she‚Äôs home or when she leaves.

I‚Äôve started taking pictures to document it, but I feel guilty bringing it up again since she already made me feel like I was the problem. I also plan to clean the shower this weekend since that‚Äôs when I finally have time.

My mindset is of offering value, leading her, having strong boundaries (not being typical nice guy who agrees to anything) and not being overtly affected by her i.e focus on my own thing first. If I get rejected, then I'll casually slide it and let the things be as it is.

TL;DR Quick Plan

* 8:15 ‚Äì leave JFK, hop on AirTrain + subway ($8.50 AirTrain + $2.90 subway each way)
* 9:30 ‚Äì Battery Park, quick walk through Wall Street, Statue of Liberty views
* 11:00 ‚Äì Ferry from Pier 11 to Hunters Point South ($4.50 in the app), skyline views
* 12:00 ‚Äì East 34th St. terminal, optional stop at Gantry Plaza, grab pizza at iPizzaNY (\~$15 for 2 slices + drink), stroll Empire State ‚Üí Times Square
* 14:00 ‚Äì Times Square
* 14:30 ‚Äì head back to JFK (budget time, TSA can be slow)
* 18:30 ‚Äì ready to board

Story:

I planned for a long stopover in New York on my way back to Europe, flying in from Vegas after a late 11 pm departure out of LAS. I‚Äôd been in the lounge beforehand, where they were running a margarita, so naturally I had to ‚Äúdo the research‚Äù and try out the different flavors. Fun way to start the night! We touched down at JFK around 7 am local time. Quick tip: if you‚Äôre flying in from outside of the US, download and use the MPC (Mobile Passport Control) app to potentially save time at immigration.

By 8:15 (or sooner), with coffee in hand, I was ready to move from the airport. I took the AirTrain ($8.50) to connect to the subway, then hopped the $2.90 ride down into Manhattan. Google Maps made it super straightforward, and about an hour later, around 9:30, I popped out down by Battery Park from where I got views of the Statue of Liberty (it was still pretty far). I strolled past Wall Street, saw the bull, stock exchange, etc.

By 11:00, I walked over to Pier 11, pulled up the NYC Ferry app, bought a $4.50 ticket, and jumped on the boat to Hunters Point South. That ride is worth it alone and is cheaper than a tourist cruise. Skyline views of lower and midtown Manhattan while you cruise along the East River. By noon, we docked at the East 34th Street terminal, and I had options: a quick side trip to Gantry Plaza State Park for a relaxed view from Queens, then back into the city. Hunger hit, so I stopped at iPizzaNY where two big slices and a drink set me back about $15. (Be sure to taste NY pizza)

From there, I walked through Midtown, swung by the Empire State Building, and followed the crowds toward Times Square, where I landed around 2 pm. It‚Äôs touristy, it‚Äôs chaotic, but it‚Äôs also one of those places you just have to see at least once. I was a little bit dissapointed but it was ok.

By around 2:30 pm, it was time to head back to JFK to have some buffer before my flight. When I flew out, TSA took me a little over an hour just to clear. Then I embarked on the 6:30 pm departure.

All in all, for a stopover day, it was surprisingly nice and cheap. If you‚Äôve never been to New York and you‚Äôve got a layover long enough, I‚Äôd say go for it!",3,1759396172.0,visitingnyc,3,1.0,False

He is super sweet and we are planning to move in together soon, but I have this feeling of him being unfaithful. I have caught him lying before like how in the beginning he lied about were he lived. I kept wanting to come over to see his place and he would just say his roommate was always around. Finally he said was thinking of moving back into his parents place. Well come to find out he was still living with his parents. I have also caught him still being on tinder after just a couple months of him asking me being his gf. I had a sinking feeling at the time because I was lucky enough to get a text message that night. I always believe in second chances and moved on in our relationship.

It's happening again I don't hear from him until before bed, he doesn't have a job at the moment and is going to school Mondays, Wednesday, and Fridays. All of the sudden the past 2 and this coming Saturday his friends aren't busy to play D&D, even though the year that we've been dating they've been too busy that's what he has told me. 

Also I made a new Instagram account because my old one got banned for BS stuff, I was going to surprise him by showing him my account and I asked him to see his phone. He started to get super defensive on giving his phone to me, I kept telling him I wouldn't see his photos or messages. That I wanted to show him something on Instagram and he can see me do it if he wants, we were at Chick-fil-A sitting next to each other so could easily see what I'm doing. Finally I told him I just wanted him to follow me on my new Instagram and how he was acting suspicious. He said he just didn't want me to see his porn cuz he was watching some the other night. Another thing is he haven't done it for over a month. . . 

Am I overreacting that he might be cheating on me? 

Edit: here is some positive stuff cuz apparently I was only talking about the negative. I love that he's goofy, makes me laugh every time we're together, always takes me out when we hangout, he brings me coffee or lunch at work because he hasn't seen me at work in a minute which is every other week, he keeps updating me on the home he remodeling for us to move in (he has taken me to the home), he hugs/kisses me when we happen to see each other at the gym even when I'm all sweaty, and I have dinner with his family about once a month. He just recently left his job to focus on his schooling and told him we don't need to go out every weekend to save him some money, but he said had plenty saved that I don't need to worry.

for context, i have a fianc√© and we have this male friend na may girlfriend (ex na sya ngayon). so syempre pakikisama, me and this now ex-girlfriend ay friends na.

earlier this year, nalaman ko through the grapevine na itong si male friend ay may side chick na kausap sa twitter/x and si side chick ay nagsesend pa ng videos (as far as i know, hindi naman nsfw.) during this time, minessage ko si girlfriend kung kumusta na ba sya, kumusta na sila ni male friend, chika ganon and me and my fianc√© naman are going through a rough patch so nagkwento din ako kay girlfriend tapos nadiscover ko na itong si male friend ay mejo explosive, bigla bigla nangaaway so syempre ako, babae sa babae, typical na ""you deserve better,"" ""magiging masaya ka din,"" ""susuportahan kita sa desisyon mo,"" ganon!

for more context, si fianc√© and male friend ay sa same building nagwowork, different floors. during this same period, nagaway kami ni fianc√© then nagask ako kay male friend if nagkita na ba sila for lunch or nakasalubong nya ba. ang sabi ni male friend ay nagkasalubong lang sila pero di sila nagusap. ako naman, sobrang agitated ko sa away namin kasi nagbbuild up na yung frustrations and inis ko tapos feel ko hindi talaga ako iniintidi ni fianc√©, sinabi ko kay male friend na ""kayo talagang magkaibigan pag may problema, may babae."" tapos nashook si male friend na bakit ko daw yun sinasabi sa kanya insinuating na magkasama sila sa kung ano man ang issue namin ni fianc√© (walang third party, talagang built up resentment lang tapos misunderstanding plus hindi tugma work schedule)

forward a few weeks, nagkita ako, fianc√© and male friend kasi sinundo ko si fianc√© and si male friend. napansin ko na hindi ako pinapansin ni male friend and paguwi ko sinabi ko kay fianc√©. sabi ni fianc√©, nalaman daw ni male friend yung pinagsasasabi ko kay girlfriend na ""you deserve better,"" ""magiging masaya ka din,"" ""susuportahan kita sa desisyon mo,"" tapos inisip ni male friend na sinusulsulan ko si girlfriend. so napagusapan namin ni fianc√© na stop ako sa communication kay girlfriend.

so fast forward a few more months, nagbreak sila male friend and girlfriend due to different reasons, sa pagkakaalam ko naghiwalay sila kasi di talaga sila nagkakaintindihan, defensive and unresponsive si male friend sa mga concerns ni girl kaya ang ending ay naghiwalay na sila. nalaman ko to through fianc√© kasi nga di na kami naguusap ni girl.

this is approx. 6 months ago na tapos recently lang nagnotif sa ig ko na inaccept ako ni ex-girlfriend so chinika chika ko sya, kumusta na, kelan coffee ganon. si girl, as i discovered, may new boyfriend na and they are going 2 months na and si male friend naman ay may mga kasituationships - YES situationshipS kasi more than one! so edi nice, kanya kanyang buhay naman tapos nagshare si girl sa akin na itong si male friend (may gc si girl, male friend, and mutual friends nila) nagpaparinig sa gc nila ng about past relationships, wala naman ako kiber, tinatawanan ko lang.

so last month, dahil naguusap naman kami ni girl more frequently kasi technically no string attached na kasi di naman na kami technically ""friends"" ni male friend e sinabi ko na kay girl na durig their time together, may side chick si male friend. in all honesty, may malaking part sa akin na alam kong icoconfront nya si male friend pero may part din sa akin na may kanya kanya naman na silang relationships ulit so ako bilang babae din, if ako ang nasa sitwasyon ni girl, gusto ko may magsabi sakin ng totoo na i'm getting cheated on.

so nagalit si girl, nashook pero sabi ko if kaya nya syempre wag nya sabihin na sa akin galing pero eto na, last week lang nagmessage si girl sa akin na galit na galit daw si male friend. so i asked why? sabi ni girl, nagpaparinig daw kasi itong si male friend sa kanya sa gc about past relationships and about memories tapos sya rumebat sya na ""atleast ako marunong makuntento, di ako nananakit ng damdamin ng tao."" tapos hindi ko na tinanong ibang details, sinabi lang ni girl na magcecelebrate daw kasi sila ng bago nya ng 2nd month nila tapos si male friend parinig pa daw ng parinig kaya nainis sya. so ang rebat nito ni male friend, directly replying kay girl na ""hindi ako galit kay OP, pero dapat di nya ako idamay sa issues nila ni fiancee"" resurfacing ulit yung issue ko with my fianc√© na kung saan sinabihan ko si male friend ng ""kayo talagang magkaibigan pag may problema, may babae.""

ngayon, i'm a bit lost kasi ang tagal na nilang hiwalay and may kanya kanya na ngang new relationships. i mean, sure, not everyone will snitch pero naghiwalay sila due to their irreconcilable differences tapos now, galit na galit si male friend and i dont know what to feel and to think kahit na si girl ay unaffected.

i'm a bit nervous din kasi this October, may out of town ako, fianc√©, fianc√©'s circle of friends na kasama si male friend and remember, nagkikita si fianc√© and male friend sa work so baka biglang mangaway tong si male friend.

ako ba yung gago dito? ano ba dapat kong gawin?

Understanding Dental Health Basics

What Makes a Healthy Mouth?
A healthy mouth is characterized by several key factors:
‚Ä¢ Pink, firm gums
‚Ä¢ White, clean teeth without discoloration
‚Ä¢ No persistent bad breath
‚Ä¢ No pain or sensitivity
‚Ä¢ Proper alignment of teeth

The Science Behind Dental Care
Dental health is a complex system involving multiple components. Your mouth is home to millions of bacteria, some beneficial and some harmful. Maintaining the right balance is crucial for preventing dental issues like tooth decay, gum disease, and other oral health problems.

Daily Dental Hygiene Routine

Essential Daily Practices
1. Brushing Techniques
‚Ä¢ Use a soft-bristled toothbrush
‚Ä¢ Brush for at least two minutes
‚Ä¢ Use circular motions
‚Ä¢ Clean all tooth surfaces
‚Ä¢ Replace your toothbrush every 3-4 months

2. Proper Flossing
Flossing removes plaque and food particles that brushing can't reach. Dentists recommend flossing at least once daily, preferably before bedtime.

3. Mouthwash Selection
Choose an antiseptic mouthwash that kills bacteria and freshens breath. Look for products containing fluoride for additional protection.

‚Ä¢ Water (helps rinse away bacteria)

Foods to Avoid
‚Ä¢ Sugary snacks and drinks
‚Ä¢ Acidic beverages
‚Ä¢ Sticky candies
‚Ä¢ Excessive coffee and tea

Nutritional Impact on Oral Health
Your diet plays a significant role in dental health. Nutrients like calcium, vitamin D, and phosphorus are crucial for maintaining strong teeth and healthy gums.

Thousands of people have already written this letter, so I might as well leave one for you too.

I have spent my whole life searching for you: meeting strangers in coffee shops, messaging people over the internet, and even asking my friends if they know someone like you. But honestly, it can get tiring. I am slowly losing my belief in love. I am slowly fading away, giving up the hope of finding you.

Maybe I've even met parts of you already‚Äîa face that looked like yours, a name that sounded right, or mannerisms that mirrored your own. Maybe I've met women who shared your hobbies, skills, likes, and dislikes. Maybe one of them was your college classmate, or your childhood friend, or wore the same perfume you did. Yet, I still can't find the one person who holds all those traits combined. I can't find you. I only hope you aren't one of those past chances that slipped away simply because one of us wasn't brave enough to reach out.

I don't know if you're looking for me too, but if you are, I hope you find me soon. Because I have stopped searching for the person whose seat in my heart has been reserved for a long time.

Or worse, maybe you didn't exist to begin with, and I'm just aimlessly looking for pieces of who I want you to be.

Either way, I miss you. I lost track of how many sleepless nights I've spent craving your warmth. I've had countless dates with myself, thinking how much better it would be if you were holding my hand. I tear up a little whenever I sing during long drives alone, wishing you were singing with me. I watch my favorite movies on repeat, wondering if you'd like them too, or I sit at my favorite coffee shop, wondering if you'd favor their teas or coffees more. I often catch myself staring into nothing, just thinking what nickname you'd give me.

And if we do meet later in life, know that I have already loved you years before meeting you.",3,1759393547.0,PinoyUnsentLetters,1,1.0,False
1nvy48a,https://www.reddit.com/r/PersonalFinanceTalks/comments/1nvy48a/how_100_a_month_could_change_your_future/,How $100 a Month Could Change Your Future,"What if I told you that a single decision you make today could completely change your financial future.

The strategy is simple: save and invest just $100 per month. It‚Äôs a small amount, roughly what many people spend on a few coffee runs or impulse purchases each month. Yet this tiny habit can create massive long-term results thanks to compound interest.

**Here‚Äôs why it works:**

Surveys show the majority of Americans can‚Äôt even cover $1,000 in an emergency. Many people live paycheck to paycheck despite having decent jobs and degrees. By simply saving $100 per month, you‚Äôre immediately ahead of most of your peers.

**$100 per month adds up faster than you think.**

Over 10 years, that‚Äôs $12,000 in contributions, but with reasonable stock market returns (\~8% annually), it grows to about $18,000.

Over 40 years, your total contributions of $48,000 can grow to over $350,000. Most of that, around 85%, comes from your money working for you, not from extra effort on your part.

**You can find that extra $100 in two ways:**

* Cut expenses: Audit recurring costs like subscriptions, insurance, and utilities. Many people waste hundreds per month on things they barely use.
* Increase income: Freelancing, side gigs, or small businesses can easily generate an extra $100/month.

Treat your investment like a bill ‚Äî something you must pay first. Set up automatic contributions so you‚Äôre not tempted to spend the money elsewhere.

The earlier you start, the more your money grows. Starting at 25 instead of 35 means 10 extra years of compound growth, which could easily mean hundreds of thousands more over a lifetime.

Start small. Start today. Let your money work for you while you sleep.",2,1759393494.0,PersonalFinanceTalks,1,1.0,False
1nvy39o,https://i.redd.it/bhoewe7hilsf1.jpeg,Plasticine wars!!! (Wargaming in a tub),"You need:
‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî-
-A good amount of clay/plasticine. I use monster clay.
-A table 
-At least one dice (any will do)
-A friend 
-Normal sized hands (people with small hands are at a minor disadvantage)
-A sense of humour and a lack of attachment to your godless creations (optional but encouraged)

Rules:
‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî
Each player is given a substantial handful of clay. Ensure that every player has a roughly even amount of clay. (Break out the scales if your that ways inclined)

Divide your clay into four even sized lumps. These are your soldiers.

Soldiers may be one of the following: 
Ranger
Fighter
Medic
Support

Players alternate taking turns, starting with the player who has the smallest hands. On your turn, select one of your monstrosities to act. 

They may take a move action, a combat action, and a tactical action IN THAT ORDER

Move:
Walk-one hand middle finger to thumb, support cannot shoot.

Run-one cubit (bone in forearm) support and Ranger cannot shoot.

Charge (one cubit, may only be taken by fighter, move into close combat)

Combat:
Shoot (Ranger and support only) 
choose one target within los. Roll a d6.
1-3miss 
4-5
body (flick as hard as you can into target‚Äôs torso/legs
6 head (flick as hard as you can into target‚Äôs head
Support may fire on two enemies within one hand of eachother. Roll to attack both of them. 

Fight (only fighters/medic/ ranger
Select one enemy within 2‚Äù combat range. Flick them as hard as you can wherever you like. If they ‚Äúsurvive‚Äù this, fighters may flick again if they just charged. Else, the target may strike back. 

You may find that models get knocked over during play. If so, they are downed. Downed modes cannot move or shoot, but are -1 to be hit. 

You may find a model becomes disfigured by the attacks. In these instances, they are wounded. Depending on where the wound is, it will have following affects:

Legs (half movement)
Body (causes bleed. Enemy player may flick them again in the same spot once every time they move)
Arm (-1 to shoot, flick one less time in melee.
Head (goes insane. Stumble d6‚Äù scatter when moving. Cannot shoot.)

Once a model has been knocked and wounded, they are obliterated (squish them into a flat disc. They will play no further part in this battle)

Tactical actions:

Stand (no longer knocked over)

Heal wounded (healer only) remove wound status on one friendly. Sculpt them better. 

Cover fire (support only) choose one enemy in los. They are downed. 

Coup de grace (fighter only) obliterate one downed enemy in close combat. Once per game only. 

Snipe (ranger only) pick one enemy within los. Flick them in the head. Once per game. 

Once every player has activated each model, the round ends and a new one begins. At the end of four rounds, the person with the most clay standing wins. If a tie, the player with the best looking models wins. 

Notes:
‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî

DONT BE THAT GUY

Do not attempt to sculpt your models for a tactical advantage. If someone is trying to do this, flick them in the head.


If your opponent has tiny hands, common courtesy dictates that they can flick with two fingers instead of the usual one. 

 Creations ought to be vaguely humanoid, and need distinct ‚Äúarms legs and head‚Äù to work (tripods I‚Äôll allow)

That said, I would advise you make your figures bottom heavy and stick them to the table a bit while playing, otherwise you will have a very short game as some will be flicked all the way across the room. 

This is a silly game about clay and should be treated as such. I advise players to stick to simple shapes that are easily identified 

As for table size, a coffee table or kitchen table is ideal. Place some upside down bowls and stacks of books down as intervening terrain.

Not interested in cheating, just in more positive company once in a while. How can I bring this up?","I (45M) have been with my partner (45F) for 25 years.

We've lived together for 20 of those years in various places, the last seven in an isolated house in a forest. We have practically everything in common and get on so well 99% of the time. However we have had a number of huge arguments over the years, many caused by her irrational dislike of the fact that I have a close family (she's an only child of a dead alcoholic and a crazy mother). She's ruined countless family holidays by sulking and saying insane things because she's jealous of time I spent with them during the one week a year or so we are around them.

Some of these arguments have been bad enough that I've thought that if we didn't live together, I'd have left. Not necessarily permanently, but something would have happened.

Our lives are so completely intertwined, financially and practically, that it would be inconceivable really to be able to break up. I am a musician and not financially secure enough alone to really attempt that, plus I would feel awful for abandoning her.

We have always been somewhat sexually incompatible, in that while we do it quite a lot I'm not absolutely insanely attracted to her physically; never was if I'm being honest, like it was fine but not the greatest thing ever. Our connection is/was probably 75% intellectual, then emotional, and lastly sexual.

I've never stopped her from doing these things, but she smokes and drinks too, which I don't, and she accuses me of looking down on her for it even though I don't say anything. She also stomps around all the time, loudly sighing and complaining constantly - I might annoy her in some ways but I don't do those things.

To complicate matters still further, while we are both fairly solitary I at least have pursuits and hobbies, some serious such as music and a kind of philosophical group I run, while she has none outside of reading and things around the house.

Any time I want to do anything without her, she will have an absolute meltdown for 24 hours preceding it. I've suggested to her that she go to evening classes, go to the theatre etc. with her aunt (since she has no friends at all), even said if she wants to talk to others in the bar without me cramping her style I'd be happy to drop her off and pick her up. Everything I say gets shot down with some reason not to do it.

We continue to get on most of the time, but being around her 24/7, 365 days a year, traveling with her, living with her, it's too much for me now without the occasional break. And the sex etc. is never going to improve.

I'm not practically independent enough though, after years of shared finances etc., nor am I horrible enough, to just dump her after so long.

So that's the background.

I really don't want to leave her. When I go away for space, it is genuinely 90% of the time that I am alone. However, that philosophical group I mentioned is mostly online, but there is one member in particular who lives a couple of hours away; she is female and much younger than me, and wants to meet regularly (by which I mean every couple of months) for a coffee for a couple of hours to discuss philosophy and our other interests in person.

This is completely platonic. Nothing like sex or romance has been mentioned and she is not even my type, I am not interested in that. But, I do enjoy her company and I don't think it should be a big deal to meet her once in a while.

My partner would have other ideas. How can I raise this subject without it making the situation even worse?

I‚Äôm buying this loft and want to totally change the vibe. Right now the staging feels colorful and random, and I‚Äôm more drawn to an industrial glam look.

A few ideas I‚Äôm playing with:
- Swapping the current pendant lights for large (30‚Äù) three-tier chandeliers. Is that going to look chic or just ‚ÄúVegas casino‚Äù?
- Ceiling-to-floor drapes by the windows, maybe with motorized blackout shades. I love velvet, but would velvet + chandeliers feel like too much?
-For furniture, I‚Äôm picturing clean-lined, masculine pieces: rectangular cognac leather sofas, a rectangular coffee table, and a motorized projection screen instead of a TV (so I could roll it up to reveal oversized artwork).
- Maybe 2 large burgundy toned Persian rugs to add warmth and coziness?

The challenge is I keep gravitating toward symmetry and squared-off layouts for a ‚Äúclean‚Äù feel, but I‚Äôm worried it could tip into hotel lobby territory and feel boring instead of stylish.

I mentioned in a past post that I went through a bunch of old ""feminine"" clothes and set them aside to donate. I heard about trans clothing swaps from someone on reddit, and I'd been planning look for one in my area.

Today, I finally did it! There's a barista at a nearby coffee shop who mentioned her LGBTQ group one day, and I finally worked up the courage to go back and ask her about it.

She was so excited and sweet. She said they do take donations, and they make the donation closet available to anyone! They have a general queer folks group that meets every Monday, so she said I was welcome to come to that and donate the clothes then, or, if that sounded like too much to me (I think she could tell I'm very introverted lol) I could drop them off at the coffee shop and she'd take them over.

Later, when she was leaving for the day, she came over to my table and told me again I'd be welcome at the event and thanked me for planning to donate the clothes. I told her about how the idea of it feels really good to me and kind of healing? She immediately knew what I meant and said that she'd done the same thing in the past, and when she saw a transmasc person happily wear her old suit, she felt so good about it! ""Like that‚Äî*that's* who this suit was meant for. That's who it fits. It was never right for me, but it's right for him.""

I debated about whether to actually go to the group or not... meeting new people sounds scary. But I think I'm going to try it at least once. It seems like a good org, and people always recommend making irl connections with LGBTQ communities so... let's give it a shot!

Something nice, their website showed some other groups, and they seem good. The main ones are the general group, a trans-specific group, and a nonbinary-specific group. I like the way they distinguished those, and they seem inclusive at first glance at least (since they didn't do that thing where some places lump together ""women and nonbinary"" etc.)

So... wish me luck next Monday! If it goes well, I might ask to go to the nb group too...
