1pc2vzu,https://www.reddit.com/r/SelfLoathingSavedMe/comments/1pc2vzu/lifes_context_read/,"Life’s Context, Read","A structural perspective is a way of thinking that does not react to a single event or emotion, but observes the patterns operating beneath them. In other words, instead of asking what to choose, it asks under what structure this choice is created.

In moments of decision, we instinctively pursue safety.
Is this the right choice, what if I regret it.
Inside these questions lies the desire to control uncertainty.

Control, risk, safety.
These three words naturally bring one person to mind: Warren Buffett.

The Margin of Safety concept Buffett talks about may look like an investment principle, but in reality it is a structural way of thinking that applies to all choices in life.
It is a system built on the assumption that I can be wrong at any time.

This concept functions outside the stock market as well.
When choosing a morning coffee, we unconsciously select the option that will not fail.
Choosing a familiar latte over a new menu is a small form of risk avoidance.
Avoiding the restaurant that disappointed us last time works the same way.
Most of daily life runs on this accumulation of small safety margins.

In fact, we build dozens of these small safety margins every day.
Leaving early for the bus, getting insurance, carrying an umbrella in case it rains.
All of these are instinctive system responses for reducing uncertainty.

Let’s widen this perspective.
Before making any decision, we can set up three scenarios from the same viewpoint.

(simple example)
Base scenario: when things proceed as expected
Worst scenario: when all variables move against me
Unexpected scenario: when an unforeseen third variable intervenes

If we place real variables like time, resources, and people on top of these three axes and expand them, a total of nine response structures emerge.
This is the framework of structural thinking.

With this structure, choices no longer come from impulse or a good feeling.
Instead, we move within a coordinate system of possibility, risk, reward, and response.

For example, when an office worker considers changing jobs, most people look only at salary and role.
But someone who thinks structurally considers time (cycles of change), resources (acceptable loss), and people (the network involved).
Crossing these three shows that it is not simply changing companies but changing the entire system the person operates in, with many interacting possibilities.

This structure naturally connects to Ray Dalio’s Principles.
He did not say to eliminate emotion but to design a repeatable mechanism that functions even when emotion shakes.
The essence is not one choice, but the structure that produces choices.

This structure, the system, also applies to the self.
At the simplest level it is habit, and more broadly it is the unconscious.
The roots of unconscious reactions, behaviors, and thoughts lie in evolutionary instincts, social norms, beliefs, and personal experience, intertwined like a complex system.

And our conscious mind is merely a surface reaction that depends on this massive unconscious system.
(Some research suggests consciousness operates only about ten percent of the day.)
Think of driving.
In urgent moments you do not think I should hit the brakes.
Your body reacts first.
This is how the unconscious system functions.

Once you can read and organize this system, the structure expands beyond the individual.
Only someone who can interpret themselves can interpret others.
Systems differ in form, but the way humans operate is remarkably similar.

The unconscious becomes a meta-structure for reading others’ psychology and behavior patterns.
Only someone who understands how their own fear and desire move can simulate the inner world of another.
As mentioned earlier, the foundation is layers of evolutionary instinct, social norms, and personal experience.

Choice is the result of patterns.
When you can read patterns, you can predict someone’s next choice.

At this point structural thinking meets marketing.
Marketing is ultimately the skill of interpreting another person’s choice structure and entering through its gaps.

For a company to succeed in the market, it must understand the consumer’s unconscious choice mechanism, not just sell a product.
It must read what fears the consumer wants to avoid and what safety margin they seek, and then say
Our product makes your life structurally more stable.
This one sentence becomes a strategy.

Just as Warren Buffett said do not buy stocks, think as if you’re acquiring the company,
a marketer sees not the consumer but the system.
Rather than a product’s sales numbers, they analyze the human structure that moves the product.

Understanding the structure of thinking is therefore studying the entire human system.
Because the structure of choice is the operating principle of humans.

We make dozens of choices every day.
From choosing a cup of coffee to ending a relationship.
Different in form, but all created inside the same system, balanced between risk and recovery, calculation and emotion.

A structural perspective is the skill of thinking with the assumption that I can be wrong in an uncertain world.
It reduces risk and evolves thought.

In short, it is a way of thinking that increases return by acknowledging risk,
and the process by which intuition becomes structured.",1,1764662665.0,SelfLoathingSavedMe,0,1.0,False

It’s likely that a large portion of those posts are either self-serving propaganda or bot-generated responses. Often, these same posts are in extreme support of vibe coding and make it seem like building software systems is a piece of cake with LLM’s. 

My background includes a chemical engineering degree, time working for a Fortune 500 manufacturing company doing some scientific modeling/simulation work, some grad CS courses, and an assortment of small personal programming projects. Basically, I can code, just not very quickly or efficiently. I can represent complex ideas programmatically nonetheless. More recently, over the past few months, I’ve engaged more heavily with these LLMs as coding tools. 

My local coffee shop had some major pain points with a fairly standard industry-accepted software solution for online reservation management. Sort of an absurd subscription fee for what they provided. I offered to help build something for the coffee shop that would be a third of the ongoing subscription cost (and I retain the full software ownership for the sake of taking on other customers beyond them too). With LLM-assisted development, it seemed like a quicker/doable project and a great way to transition my career towards CS more.

This project has taken me close to 7-8 months to complete. It’s in a really fantastic state and I’m proud of the work that I’ve shaped and created. Given that I was coming from a non-traditional / aspiring SWE background, I had to learn a ton of stuff. The not so glamorous things like managing a git workflow, CI/CD management, compliance, security/penetration testing, API wrangling, lots of architectural tradeoffs, Linux OS, terminal interactions, and so much more. I cannot stress enough how much knowledge I have accumulated over the course of this project. Given the pace I was going at, I admittedly traded some coding-level knowledge for this more abstracted knowledge (systems, integrations, networks, etc.). 

Anyways, now my question. How are people claiming to build these apps and systems at such a breakneck pace without sacrificing on the feature sets, maintainability, security, cost-effectiveness, scalability, etc.? I’m v confused about this because so much of the narrative is “now I can go fast and the details don’t matter, but if they do, they’re easy”... Are people not shipping real things? Developing these systems becomes increasingly more complicated the closer the launch gets. Right?

I’m a bit biased here, but I would really appreciate feedback from folks who have shipped real products - with or without genAI assistance. I’m also particularly interested in hearing from experienced SWE that have leaned into LLMs for development work.",2,1764662176.0,vibecoding,9,0.67,False

1pc2n0m,https://www.reddit.com/r/parkingguides/comments/1pc2n0m/parking_tips_for_university_of_north_dakota_mens/,parking tips for university of north dakota mens basketball vs. montana men's basketball at betty engelstad sioux center (grand forks 12/06),"  
  
hey everyone, figured i'd share some parking knowledge for the fighting hawks vs. montana game on 12/06 at 7:00 pm. parking around the betty engelstad sioux center (besc) can be a headache, especially on a weeknight, but you've got a few solid options to avoid the worst of it.  
  
first, if you want to skip the official lot traffic and walk for like 3 minutes, check out the Prked app. honestly, it's a lifesaver. people near the besc and ralph engelstad arena (rea) actually rent out their private driveways or empty garage spots. it's usually way cheaper than the paid lots and you get to drive right past the main bottleneck and park on a quiet residential street. just book it ahead of time, pull up to a reserved spot, and you're golden.  
  
now for the official and alternative options:  
  
the main general admission lot is the \*\*wellness lot\*\*, which is directly east of the und student wellness center . und parking sets the price for basketball here, and it's generally listed at \*\*$10 per vehicle\*\* . sometimes it's cash only for the event lots, so bring a $10 bill just in case. there's also a chance the lots surrounding the building might be just \*\*$5 for an evening game\*\* , but the wellness lot is the reliable, designated general admission spot.  
  
you'll also see other und lots off-site that are open for event parking but they are a longer walk and usually more expensive, like the $10 harvard lot (behind the old archives coffee shop) or the $15 lot near the medical school . stick to the wellness lot if you're paying for a close spot.  
  
your best free option is \*\*street parking\*\*. the venue has a decent amount of street parking on the \*\*east and south sides of the arena\*\* . since the game is at 7:00 pm on a friday, most of the grand forks city street parking is free of hourly limits after 5:00 pm on weekdays . \*however\*, make sure you are not parking in a non-designated und lot on campus, as those require a student/staff permit and they \*will\* ticket you . look for signs carefully, especially in lots near university buildings or dorms. if it looks like a normal residential street spot and no sign says ""und permit only,"" you're probably safe.  
  
timing-wise, you need to arrive early. a weeknight game, even if it's not a huge crowd, means you're fighting grand forks' regular evening commute traffic plus the game traffic . the limited general admission spaces fill up quickly. aim to be parked and walking by 6:15 pm at the latest if you don't want to be running in right before tip-off.  
  
if you're just dropping someone off, use the designated drop-off/pick-up zone on \*\*10th ave. west, right in front of the besc main lobby\*\* .

Nothing serious — just some simple reminders that keep deals safe.



**💬 1. Keep chats simple and on trusted platforms**

Just chat on Reddit or WhatsApp.

Avoid moving to unknown links or third-party sites — it keeps things clean and easy.



**🔐 2. No need to share codes or OTPs with anyone**

Sometimes buyers may ask for a “verification code”.

Please avoid sharing such things — it’s just good online hygiene.



**💸 3. Check payments directly in your UPI/bank app**

Before handing over an item, quickly open GPay/PhonePe/Paytm and confirm the amount is received.

Screenshots can sometimes be outdated or mistaken — direct confirmation is fastest.



**📦 4. Prefer local, in-person handovers when possible**

Meeting at a public place like a mall, metro station, or coffee shop makes exchanges easy and comfortable for both sides.



**😊 5. If someone seems too pushy or confusing, take a moment**

Most buyers and sellers are genuine.

But if someone sounds in a rush or asks for something odd, just pause and double-check.

It’s okay to say **“Let me get back to you.”**



**📧 6. Keep your email private**

Your email connects to many online accounts.

It’s just best practice to avoid sharing it unless necessary.



**🧾 7. Simple payment methods work best**

For smooth experience:

* UPI
* Cash
* In-person exchange

These are reliable and easy to verify.



**👍 8. We’re all here to help — feel free to ask questions**

If you’re unsure about anything, ask the community or the mods.

No question is too small. Your safety and comfort matter.



**❤️ Together we can build a safe, helpful community for buying & selling in Hyderabad.**

Super late lang itong update na ito kaya pasensya na talaga. First time ko magpost ng ganito online at sobrang na appreciate ko yung mga positive at supportive comments ninyo. Nakakatuwa at nakakataba ng puso. Eto na ang part two ng kwento ko.

Simula nang huling post ko, inisip ko na madalas yung mga sinabi ninyo. Karamihan nag encourage sakin na sabihin na lang agad kung ano meron. Alam kong kailangan kong gawin ito bago masyado akong mahulog at magsisi na hindi ko sinubukan.

Nagplano ako ng simple lang. Hindi yun dramatic. Sa totoo lang hand shaking pa rin ako nung umalis ako ng bahay. Nagwalk kami pauwi at nagulat ako kasi nagulat din siya na pareho kami ng route. Huminto kami sa pabor namin na bench malapit sa maliit na tindahan. Tahimik lang. Parang may hangin na naglalagay ng lullaby sa background.

Sabi ko, buong puso lang, “Gusto kong maging honest. Hindi ko na kayang itago. May gustong napapansin na sobra.” Nilabas ko lahat ng tanga tanga kong feelings sa simpleng paraan. Hindi ako nagmamadali. Sinabi ko kung paano siya palaging nakapagpapagaan ng araw ko, kung paano ako kinakabahan sa mga simpleng tingin niya, at kung pano naging special yung late night chats namin. Hindi ako nagbalot ng mga sentiment na malabo. Sinabi ko yung totoo.

Tumango siya ng dahan dahan at huminga ng malalim. Sandali lang yung katahimikan na hindi nakakakaba kundi naglilinis ng alikabok sa isip ko. Sabi niya, “Hindi mo alam kung gaano ko rin tinitingnan yung mga maliliit mong ginagawa. Naantay din ako dati kung masu-sure ka.” Nang marinig ko yun parang naglaway ako sa sobrang saya. Hindi siya bigla nag confess ng ganap pero ramdam ko yung honesty sa boses niya.

Hindi kami agad naglabel. Hindi pa niya sinabing exacly na siya din, pero sinabi niyang gusto niyang subukan at makilala pa kami ng mas mabuti. Yung sagot niya hindi perfect pero sobrang enough. Nagkapag tawa kami, nagkapagkulitan, at nagkapagplanong magkape together next weekend. Simple pero para sakin malaking milestone na yun.

Minsan may mga awkward pause pa rin. May moments na natatakot pa rin ako na baka fake yung nararamdaman ko o baka nagiimagine lang ako. Pero ngayon iba yung saya. Hindi na ako lumalakad na parang nag-iisa lang sa mundo. May kasama na akong inaabangang cup of coffee at mga bagong kwento.

Maraming salamat ulit sa inyo. Sobrang thankful ako sa support ng community na ito. Gumagana talaga yung small talk at eye contact at pagiging sincere. Sa mga nagshare ng sariling kwento, ang ganda ng comfort na dulot ninyo. Promise magpo post ako ng Part Three kapag may bagong nangyari o kapag nagkape na kami together at may kwento.

Kung may advice kayo sa mga susunod na steps like paano gawing special pero hindi overwhelming yung first few dates or paano magmanage ng expectations, go lang comment. Plano ko din irespect yung pace niya at magpakatotoo lang sa sarili ko.

Salamat ulit everyone. Feeling ko parang nag-level up ako sa buhay at bitbit ko yung support ninyo.",1,1764660775.0,FirstTimeKo,1,1.0,False

1pc2d4j,https://www.reddit.com/r/Bolehland/comments/1pc2d4j/head_injury/,Head injury.,"I remember when I was nine years old, and very analytical. I was descending the stairs in my house and suddenly thought it would be a good idea to jump from the railing halfway down to the glass coffee table on the ground floor to save time.

As I jumped, I knew instantly that I couldn't make it, and then suddenly, bang. I hit my head on the edge of the table. The sound was heard all around the house. When I was on the floor, my head was spinning, a lump started forming on it. I then got up and went to get help.

After this event, I started acting differently. I couldn't focus on things easily, and my mind started zoning out the moment I felt the current situation was not engaging. Any lessons, speeches, or sermons by grown ups bored me easily, where I used to be very focused on these things before.

I also went from being the smart, quiet kid to being the loud, mean kid. I enjoyed making fun of others, mostly based on differences, even small ones. When I got a reaction out of other people, it felt good, even if the reactions were really negative.

I started being very hypervigilant too, when I had been very trusting before, following good morals or whatever. Afterwards, I learned that no one can be trusted, and everyone has their own agenda.

All of this was reflected in my school performance. From being the best student in the class for years, I started consistently being one of the worst. To be honest, at the time, I couldn't really care less until upper secondary.

What if I hadn't hit my head? I might have turned out differently. Or not, and I should take accountability for my actions.",0,1764660650.0,Bolehland,2,0.33,False
1pc2d1w,https://www.reddit.com/r/soothfy/comments/1pc2d1w/why_your_brain_needs_different_activities_at/,Why your brain needs different activities at different times (and why most ADHD routines fail),"I spent 2 years wondering why I could never stick to routines. Tried morning meditation, Pomodoro timers, evening journaling - all the stuff that works for ""normal"" people. Failed every single time.

Then I realized the problem: I was doing random activities at random times without understanding what my ADHD brain actually needs at different parts of the day.

Here's what I learned after digging into circadian rhythms, dopamine patterns, and how ADHD brains actually work:

# Your Brain Has Different Needs at Different Times

# Morning (6am-9am): Activation & Direction

**What your brain needs:** Signal to wake up, set intention, create momentum

**What DOESN'T work:** Complex tasks, heavy decision-making, intense focus work

**Why:** Your cortisol naturally peaks in the morning (yes, even with ADHD). Your brain is primed for activation, not execution. If you try to jump into deep work immediately, you're fighting your biology.

**What DOES work:**

* Sunlight exposure (resets circadian rhythm, boosts alertness)
* Simple physical movement (signals ""day has started"")
* Gratitude or intention-setting (directs your focus for the day)
* Light planning (what are my 3 priorities today?)

**Example Morning Activities:**

* Drink water in sunlight for 5 minutes
* Write 3 things you're grateful for
* Quick body scan or stretching
* Preview your calendar/to-do list (just look, don't execute)

**The Goal:** Wake your brain up and point it in the right direction. Not productivity yet - just activation.

# Work Time (9am-5pm): Focus & Execution

**What your brain needs:** Structure, external cues, dopamine hits from completion

**What DOESN'T work:** Long unstructured blocks, multitasking, vague goals

**Why:** ADHD brains struggle with task initiation and time blindness. We need external structure because our internal structure is broken. We also need frequent dopamine hits to maintain motivation.

**What DOES work:**

* Time blocking (25-50 min focused chunks)
* Single-task focus with clear endpoints
* External timers and cues
* Quick wins between big tasks
* Physical breaks to reset attention

**Example Work Activities:**

* Pomodoro timer (25 min work, 5 min break)
* Calendar preview before starting work
* Two-minute rule (knock out tiny tasks immediately)
* Brain dump during breaks (clear mental clutter)
* Desk stretches or short walks between tasks

**The Goal:** Create external structure, maintain focus through dopamine hits, prevent burnout through strategic breaks.

# Evening (5pm-10pm): Wind Down & Reflection

**What your brain needs:** Transition out of work mode, process the day, prepare for sleep

**What DOESN'T work:** Starting new projects, intense stimulation, screen-heavy activities

**Why:** Your brain needs to shift from ""doing"" mode to ""resting"" mode. ADHD brains struggle with transitions. Evening is about processing what happened and creating closure so your brain can actually rest.

**What DOES work:**

* Reflection and journaling
* Acknowledgment of wins (even small ones)
* Light physical activity (walking, gentle stretching)
* Screen-free wind-down routines
* Tomorrow's simple planning (reduce morning decision fatigue)

**Example Evening Activities:**

* Post-it win (write your biggest accomplishment)
* Evening reflection journal (what went well? what to improve?)
* Gratitude practice (3 things that went right)
* Light planning for tomorrow (3 priorities)
* Calming physical activity (walking, stretching)

**The Goal:** Create closure on the day, acknowledge progress, transition your brain toward rest.

# The Missing Piece: Anchor + Novelty

Here's the other thing most routines get wrong: they're either too rigid (same exact thing every day = bored by day 3) or too flexible (no structure = chaos and decision fatigue).

**The solution:** Anchor activities + Novelty activities

**Anchor Activities:**

* Same activities, same time, every day
* Create routine and reduce decision fatigue
* Example: Sunlight + water every morning, Calendar preview before work, Post-it win every evening

**Novelty Activities:**

* Rotate daily within the same theme/goal
* Keep your ADHD brain interested
* Example: Monday = gratitude list, Tuesday = body scan, Wednesday = positive affirmations (all serve the same purpose but different execution)

**Why this works:**

* Anchors build habit and structure
* Novelty prevents boredom and maintains dopamine
* Your brain gets stability WITHOUT monotony

# Real Example: My Current Setup

**Morning Anchor (daily):** Sunlight + water for 5 minutes **Morning Novelty (rotates):**

* Monday: Write 3 things I'm grateful for
* Tuesday: 2-minute body scan
* Wednesday: Set 3 intentions for the day
* Thursday: Mindful coffee/tea
* Friday: Quick stretching routine

**Work Anchor (daily):** Calendar preview + Pomodoro timer **Work Novelty (rotates):**

* Monday: Brain dump during break
* Tuesday: Two-minute rule for small tasks
* Wednesday: Desk stretches
* Thursday: 5-minute walk
* Friday: Priority check (am I working on the right thing?)

**Evening Anchor (daily):** Post-it win (write biggest accomplishment) **Evening Novelty (rotates):**

* Monday: Evening journal reflection
* Tuesday: Tomorrow's simple plan
* Wednesday: Gratitude practice
* Thursday: What did I learn today?
* Friday: Week review (what went well?)

**The pattern:** Same structure daily (anchors), but different activities within that structure (novelty). Stability + variety.

# Why I Built Soothfy

After figuring this out manually, I realized I was spending 30+ minutes each week planning which novelty activities to rotate. That's when I built Soothfy - it auto-suggests novelty activities that match your anchor themes based on:

* Time of day (morning/work/evening activities aligned with your brain's needs)
* Your goals (focus, emotional regulation, time management, etc.)
* Your energy level (low/medium/high)
* What you've already done (prevents repetition and boredom)

You pick 3 anchors (morning, work, evening) and it generates matching novelty activities automatically. The app handles the rotation so you don't have to think about it.

# The Bottom Line

Your ADHD brain needs different things at different times:

* **Morning:** Activation and direction
* **Work:** Structure and dopamine hits
* **Evening:** Reflection and wind-down

And you need both stability (anchors) and variety (novelty) to actually stick with it.

Most productivity advice ignores this. That's why it doesn't work for ADHD brains.

3) If I were to alternate between upgrading time & 2nd fruit only e.g.watermelons. Will it at some point cap out so that plums/3rd fruit become the only upgradeable fruit option?

1pc26qe,https://www.reddit.com/r/Makera/comments/1pc26qe/makeracontest/,[MakeraContest],"My CNC story starts in woodworking, though where it ends, I have no idea. I picked up CAD when we had kids, mostly because I no longer had the time to get to the workshop as often. To give the drawing some purpose, I bought a cheap 3D printer, then upgraded when calibration took longer than printing. Since then, I’ve designed and printed [all sorts of things](https://makerworld.com/en/@skrivkunnig).

I love 3D printing and the openness of sharing models, but the finish is often not quite what I hope for. I’ve looked toward CNC for years, but it never felt realistic in an apartment – until now.

I’m ready to take things to the next level, and the Makera Z1 will fit right into my home office. I already have a list of projects: tap handles for my kegerator, handles for woodworking and leathermaking tools, handles for knives, kitchen knobs, toys for the kids, leather stamps, decorations, and gifts I’m proud to give.

It’s a bit wild to have a tiny factory at home. The times we live in are amazing.

1pc26o0,https://www.reddit.com/r/u_creativeorion/comments/1pc26o0/handdrawn_logos_bringing_authenticity_to_brands/,Hand-Drawn Logos: Bringing Authenticity to Brands,"In a world full of digital, polished, and perfectly symmetrical designs, hand-drawn logos feel refreshing and real. They bring a human touch that many modern brands need today. A hand-drawn logo looks like it was created with care, emotion, and personality. That is why many businesses are now choosing this style to stand out. As a leading [logo design company in India](https://creativeorion.com/logo-designing-company-in-india/), designers often suggest hand-drawn logos for brands that want to look warm, authentic, and approachable.

Hand-drawn logos are not “messy” or “unprofessional.” In fact, when done right, they can become beautiful brand marks that connect emotionally with customers. Let’s explore why this unique style is getting popular and how it adds authenticity to brands.



# Why Hand-Drawn Logos Stand Out

# 1. They Look Personal and Human

Most logos today are made using sharp lines and computer accuracy. But hand-drawn logos show imperfections, natural strokes, and character. These small details make the brand feel more relatable. Customers can sense that the logo was created by a human, not just a machine.

This “human touch” builds trust—something every business needs.



# 2. Perfect for Storytelling

A hand-drawn logo can tell a story in a way digital logos often cannot. Each line and curve can reflect the brand’s history, inspiration, or values.

For example:

* A bakery may use a hand-sketched cupcake.
* A clothing brand may use a hand-written signature style.
* A café may use a doodle of a coffee mug.

A professional **logo design company in India** understands how to turn these sketches into meaningful stories that represent the brand clearly.



# 3. Unique and Impossible to Copy

Since every stroke is custom, hand-drawn logos are naturally unique. No other brand can have the exact same curves or handwriting. This makes the brand identity strong and original.

In a market filled with similar designs, being different helps a lot.



# How Hand-Drawn Logos Bring Authenticity

# 1. Natural Imperfections Create Warmth

Unlike digital designs, hand-drawn logos have small irregularities. These imperfections feel real and authentic. They show that the brand values honesty and originality.

# 2. They Show Craftsmanship

Many brands want to show that they put effort into their products. A hand-drawn logo perfectly communicates craftsmanship and creativity.

This is why:

* Organic brands
* Handmade businesses
* Boutiques
* Artists
* Cafés
* Lifestyle brands

often choose hand-drawn symbols.



# Modern Trends in Hand-Drawn Logos

# 1. Handwritten Typography

Soft, flowing handwriting adds personality and charm. It works especially well for personal brands and boutique businesses.

# 2. Doodle-Style Illustrations

Small icons, shapes, and sketches make the logo look playful and friendly.

# 3. Rough Textures

Designers use textures like pencil, charcoal, or brush strokes to keep the natural, handmade feel.

# 4. Simplified Line Art

Clean, single-line drawings add elegance while keeping the hand-drawn style.

A skilled **logo design company in India** can combine these trends with modern design principles to make the logo look professional and ready for digital use.



# Why Brands Love Hand-Drawn Logos Today

✔ They feel real, warm, and emotional.  
✔ They make the brand look unique and honest.  
✔ They stand out in a world of digital perfection.  
✔ They connect strongly with audiences who prefer authenticity.  
✔ They work perfectly for social media, packaging, and websites.



# Conclusion

Hand-drawn logos are more than just sketches—they carry personality, story, and emotion. They bring authenticity at a time when customers crave real, human-focused brands. With the help of a creative **logo design company in India**, businesses can turn simple drawings into powerful, memorable brand identities.",1,1764659980.0,u_creativeorion,0,1.0,False

1pc23xz,https://www.reddit.com/r/fragrance/comments/1pc23xz/my_coverage_of_the_scent_arabia_and_the_middle/,My coverage of the Scent Arabia and the Middle Eastern brands there.,"I spent the evening of 29th November wandering through **The Scent Arabia** at Exhibition World Bahrain, and I have returned with a blazer that smells arguably better than it did when I bought it, and a nose that is currently filing for divorce.

For those used to Western expos (which can feel a bit clinical), the vibe here is entirely different. It’s less of a trade show and more of a celebration of heritage. You don't just test a scent; you are offered coffee, dates, and a conversation.

I wrote a massive detailed breakdown on my blog, but I wanted to share the key takeaways and house highlights with the community here while it's fresh:

**The Trends**  
The line between ""Western"" and ""Eastern"" perfumery is blurring beautifully. We are seeing a lot of ""French-arabic"" fusion, heavy amber bases paired with delicate top notes of bergamot or pear. Also, the knowledge level of the average attendee is humbling; people here discuss rose harvests the way Brits discuss the weather.

**The Standouts**

* **Junaid Perfumes:** They arguably won the visual game. Massive displays of raw agarwood that looked like sculptures. Their oils remain top-tier.
* **Gissah:** They had the prime spot. Everyone knows them for Imperial Valley, but their Luxury Line (and the discounts) were the real draw. A massive bridge between East and West styles.
* **Ahmed Al Maghribi:** If you want to know what real Dhen al Oud smells like, this is the benchmark. In a market full of synthetics, their raw materials are the real deal.
* **Al Haramain:** Showcased their new 'Sheikh' series. The packaging is... theatrical (read: can double as a doorstop), but you cannot argue with the price-to-performance ratio.
* **Sol De Scent:** A newer brand that surprised me. They have a Zodiac gimmick, but the juice is actually very solid, leaning towards Western profiles with some excellent Chypres.

**The ""Western"" Problem**  
Big European niche/designer brands were present (via retailers like Al Hawaj), but they face a tough battle here. It is hard to sell a delicate EDT when the local brand next door offers nuclear projection and 24-hour longevity for a fraction of the price.

**TL;DR:** The Middle East market is thriving, the hospitality is unmatched, and I may have bought too much oil.

I’ve uploaded a full gallery of the stalls (some of them are wild) and a longer write-up on my site if you want to see the visuals:

(Econ specifically),"I'm 22, working in corporate finance (remote), trying to finally finish my degree. Did a gap year and two years at a state school, transferred to a t25 but ended up having to withdraw after a financial aid disaster – I'm self-supporting and their office butchered the original numbers among several things (including eventually insinuating I was lying and have monetary support that doesn't exist). Three years into my career now and ready to finish my degree once I recover somewhere that maintains my peace and health instead of administrative nightmares.

SPS caught my attention because the tuition is actually possible without outside support, the evening schedule works with my job hours which has been a big hurdle in the past, and I'm from the Midwest so Chicago already feels like home I haven't had the chance to fully experience. The Weinberg degree is a major factor as well – appears significantly more normal (if not nearly the same) to employers than some of the other continuing studies options out there. The staff already expedited my application for the Winter term so should hear back soon.

Mostly wondering:

1. What's the intellectual vibe actually like? At my prior school(s) most people acted like they were exclusively there for the fun and the resume line, and I'm hoping for something blended with more ambition and academic curiosity.
2. For anyone who's been around SPS students or is one – do you find the age/experience gap makes it harder to connect, or does it not really matter once you're in classes and through joining normal undergrad orgs? I've found myself relating more with my 30-year old cousins than my college friends at times so not a major concern just curious.
3. Anyone in or familiar with the Econ track? Curious about course quality and whether profs are engaged, general rigor, what the grade inflation or lack thereof is like.

I'll be on campus this coming Monday if anyone in the regular Econ wants to grab coffee – I'm buying, feel free to PM.

1pc1xc4,https://www.reddit.com/r/InstagramEmpire/comments/1pc1xc4/been_stuck_at_300_views_for_months_and_finally/,Been stuck at 300 views for months and finally figured out what was wrong,"I've been ridiculously fixated on short form video for the past two years. Not in a balanced way either. More like the kind where I'm analyzing retention curves while waiting in line for coffee.

My coworkers think it's excessive. They're probably not wrong.

But I can't help myself. Short form isn't just trendy content anymore. It's becoming the only way anything gets attention. Trying to sell something? Need visibility? Want to build an audience? You have 30 seconds to make it count or nobody sees you.

The frustrating thing? I was absolutely terrible at it.

I'd dedicate entire evenings to one video. Plan every detail. Shoot it multiple ways. Edit until it looked professional. Then post and watch it barely hit 380 views. Studied successful creators obsessively. Bought their courses. Implemented everything they taught.

Still stuck.

I legitimately started thinking maybe this just isn't for me. Like certain people have an instinct for viral content and I completely lack it.

Then something clicked in my head. I wasn't failing because I couldn't do it. I was failing because I had zero idea what was actually wrong. Just changing things randomly hoping something would finally work.

So I did something completely different. Stopped the random tweaking. Started tracking real numbers.

Opened every one of my last 50 videos. Examined each second by second. Noted the exact moments people left. Identified 6 specific issues destroying my performance:

**1. My hooks were too mysterious.** Opening with ""Wait for this..."" got me skipped instantly. But ""Eating the same breakfast for 40 days straight made my grocery bill drop by half"" stopped people scrolling. Concrete information beats vague promises.

**2. Everyone bailed around second 5.** Most viewers decide between seconds 4 and 7 if they're continuing. I was building toward something instead of showing it immediately. Now I drop my strongest visual right at second 5. Totally different outcome.

**3. Small pauses looked like loading screens.** Measured this obsessively. Any gap over 1.2 seconds makes viewers think something's broken. What felt like natural pacing to me read as buffering to people scrolling. Edited way tighter than seemed normal. Made massive difference.

**4. Nothing changed on screen long enough.** When your visual stays static past 3 seconds, attention just evaporates. Started rotating angles constantly. Cutting to different shots. Shifting where text appears. Retention climbed from 50% to 70% purely from visual variety.

**5. Analyze your videos and learn from their feedback.** This is one of the things that helped me the most. I use an app called TikAlyzer that gives me feedback about my videos and tells me how to improve them so I can get more views.

**6. My rewatch numbers were basically nothing.** Algorithm pushes videos people watch multiple times way harder. Started including text that moves too fast. Tiny details you only notice second time around. Rewatch rate went from 8% to 31%. That's when views actually exploded.

The actual breakthrough wasn't some viral secret. It was abandoning the guessing and tracking what actually happened every second.

Jumped from 300 average views to 15k within three weeks.

If you're posting regularly but can't break 1k views, your content isn't necessarily bad. You just probably can't see what's working versus what you think is working.

Sharing this because honestly this stuff kicked my ass for months. Wish someone had just laid it out clearly back then. So I'm doing that for whoever needs it now.",9,1764659004.0,InstagramEmpire,0,1.0,False

# 4. Red Meat

# 2. Stay Physically Active

**Light walking for 20–30 minutes daily improves digestion and prevents constipation.**



# 3. Avoid Sitting for Too Long

* **Do not sit on the toilet for more than 3–5 minutes**  
* **Avoid using mobile phones while defecating**  



# 5. Sitz Bath for Comfort

I recently made homemade chicken noodle soup and it is amazing. i like to make some historical cooking things too like switchel and pemmican.

I like coffee and tea, ristretto is my favorite because it uses less water and alot of the flavors that are normally diluted are there, its rich like hot cocoa

Oh and i love avatar the last Airbender, i would have to be a water bender and i have a whole rant about why. my closest friend and me have been rewatching it recently.

she is the closest thing to family i got, like a little sister but someone thought i was her dad before and it was kind of fitting so it stuck haha. her and her gf have helped me through alot and i do alot for them too.

I also love animals. i yearn to get a dog or maybe some rats

I am also learning Japanese and like japanese related things like history, games, food and such

Seeing how tech advanced though history is really cool too. Like preserving food, tanning leather, black smithing, alchemy like black powder

1pc1rcu,https://www.reddit.com/r/heartbreak/comments/1pc1rcu/i_havent_fallen_for_anyone_since_i_was_16_im_25/,I haven’t fallen for anyone since I was 16. I’m 25 now.,"
It’s weird to think that it’s been about almost a decade since I fell for someone. I’ll admit I’ve had a crush here or there but nothing serious or long term. 

I meant her when I was 16. She was around the neighborhood and knew some of my friends who lived at the apartments I lived at. One day my friend’s phone went off when we were chilling. I remember looking at his phone and saw a name I never see before, but it felt like a strong name. Like I somehow recognized it even though I never met them. She called him asking to hangout and I didn’t mind and i guess she was bored. I remember then 2 talking and I just followed and rode my skateboard where I could. She offered him a piece of gum, and held out enough and said something like “I got one for this lil bitch too” or something a long those lines. She had a smirk on her face and she was almost like an older sister to my friends so that’s probably where manner came from. I remember I smiled and took it.

After that I didn’t see or hear from her for weeks till my friend asked to hangout again. We got bored and he asked who should he hit up. I remember naming a few people then mentioned her because I didn’t wanna be obvious. My friend said sure then remembered she moved. I was kinda bummed and thought “of course we met right before she leaves.” I don’t remember exactly what we did. I do remember her sister was still in town living with one parent while she left to live with the other.

A month or 2 later I heard a knock at my window (it wasn’t uncommon for my friends to get me that way). I assumed it was a close friend and checked with no one there. I didn’t think much of it and went back to playing games. There was another knock and again, no one there. I decided to check if my friends were messing with me and I get there, and all these girls jump out from the bushes in the ally in between the apartments. I immediately recognized them all included “her”. I was confused on what they wanted but it turns out they just wanted to hang. I knew all of them pretty well, the 2 sisters, then their younger sister I think, then a girl from the same apartment complex. They wanted to ding dong ditch or smoke or whatever teenagers did. It felt cool they thought to bring me along so that’s what we did.

It was a fun night, even got stopped my police after we go separate and it was me and only and “her” walking back home. Luckily they were looking for a group of people not just 2 so we got away clean. Smoked, played around in the dark and I remember just having a good time. I don’t remember how I ended up getting her number or how I asked but we ended up talking between then and the next story and got pretty comfortable with each other.

At this point I looked forward to seeing her and talking to her. We decided to hangout one day, just us 2. I think we decide to go chill at a park near. I was to meet her there. Back then I used to skateboard everywhere and rolled up like usual. I think she wanted to learn to skate so I offered to show her. She stood up on my board and I guided her, I remember holding on to her and she held on me as I walked a long. We must’ve been having fun because next thing we knew were down town. Near our high school. Someone honked and said something and we both laughed because it was some we knew saying something about us being like we were. I continued to wheel here and we ended up at a coffee shop, after ordering we sat talking forever and decided it was time to head home. 

We ended up at her best friend’s house and few other mutual friends. Someone had planned a small kick back and they were gonna drink and I was invited. After being there for her first time drinking and listening to music, vaping, laughing, she go silent and randomly went outside. Everyone was confused so I, idiotically followed her. It was a chilly winter night and she sat by a fence and I asked her if she was okay and she said she was fine. I decided to sit next to her and give her my jacket. Eventually other friend came to check on us too. I don’t remember what we talked about that night but eventually was okay. The night ended and she walked me home cuz she was gonna stay at her friends which was only 2 blocks away. That was a good day.

The two of us talked and texted and called all the time talking about anything and everything. There were many other hang outs like when her mom took us hiking then lunch or when we’d wrestle, or walk thru the woods. I was hooked and so was she. The thing was, we both were shy and not sure how to deal with how we felt, other than appreciative words or hanging out. For months things were good, great even and I was glad it felt like I had a best friend.

Things ended finally when I hurt her (not physically). We had spent so much time in this state of not telling each other how we genuinely felt I started to have doubts and started to push her away. Eventually I pushed to too far and hurt her because I didn’t know how she felt towards me. She left and it left me feeling broke and empty. Still the most depressing thing I ever been thru. She ended up trying to come back a year later and things didn’t work out, she had changed too much for me and all it did was hurt. New habits, new friends, and I just missed the old version of her. We parted ways again. Then one more time she came around over a year later, she just, missed me and I kinda missed her too even though at this point in my life I shouldn’t have looked back and even one of my close friends tried to tell me to leave it in the past. After another couple months of trying she ended up finally picking someone else. Even while I was still trying, so I just told her to forever leave me alone and that I was done. She had hurt me too much and spent too much of my time. 

This was a little more than 5 years ago we parted ways. I can say I’m over it and over her. One thing that hasn’t happened since being 16 is that, I never fell for anyone as hard. Again there were a few dates I’ve been on,mild crushes, hookups, dating apps, but never ever felt close to that genuine authentic connection. I do look forward to falling for someone again or at least have hope that it can happen again but with the new year around the corner.

The world is soft and gray. A cool morning chill is in the air. Your thoughts are still fuzzy, floating. The day hasn't really begun yet.

The gentle sound of coffee brewing. You open the cupboard and your hand finds it—the one. The mug that feels just right. You feel its comforting weight. The sound of hot, dark coffee pouring into the ceramic is the first real note of the day's song.

You wrap your hands around the mug, and a gentle warmth spreads through your fingers, chasing away the chill. You lift it, and the rich aroma of coffee envelops you. You take the first sip. And in that moment, the world sharpens. The day begins. It's a small, perfect sanctuary, just for you.

by [https://www.gptsportswriter.com](https://www.gptsportswriter.com) **Minnesota Timberwolves vs. New Orleans Pelicans: A Tale of Two Teams (and Seven Injuries)**

The Minnesota Timberwolves, a well-oiled machine with a fully healthy roster, are set to face the New Orleans Pelicans, a team that’s been hit harder by injuries than a toddler in a candy store. Let’s break this down with the precision of a highlight-reel dunk and the humor of a postgame interview with a sleep-deprived analyst.

---

### Parsing the Odds: Why the Timberwolves Are the Favorite

The bookmakers aren’t just handing out free picks—they’re screaming it. Minnesota is listed at **-9.5 on the spread** across the board, with implied probabilities of a **80% chance to win** (per decimal odds). The Pelicans? A paltry **23.8%**—about the same odds as me correctly spelling “Zion Williamson’s” name after one cup of coffee.

Statistically, the gap is staggering. Minnesota shoots **38.6% from 3**, led by Anthony Edwards, who’s nailing **3.5 threes per game** like he’s playing a video game on “Easy.” Meanwhile, the Pelicans’ offense has been reduced to a flickering candle in a hurricane, averaging just **113.8 points over their last 10 games**—and that’s with Zion Williamson *healthy* in one of them.

New Orleans is currently missing **seven players**, including **Zion Williamson** (hamstring), **Herb Jones** (calf), and **Dejounte Murray** (Achilles). It’s like they drafted a “Rookie All-Star Team” of injured reserves and called it a day. Interim coach James Borrego praised his team’s “resiliency” after a recent loss to the Lakers, but let’s be real: When your starting five includes players named **Bryce McGowens** and **Jeremiah Fears**, “resilience” is just code for “we’re winging it.”

Still, credit where it’s due: Without Zion, McGowens dropped a **career-high 23 points**, proving that when lif

Wake up half-asleep

Fight the urge to call in “sick”

Stare at a screen for 8+ hours

Attend meetings that could’ve been emails

Pretend to look busy when the boss walks by

Go home exhausted… despite doing almost nothing physically

Then wake up and do it all again.

I try to quit caffeine for such a long time now. 

Last couple of weeks I tapered down successfully as some circumstances in my life changed so it was easier for me. I am drinking one cappuccino in the morning at the moment. I would like to quit this as well but every morning the voice inside me telling me ""just one the morning is fine"" is louder than the silent voice whispering that this is not a good idea. 

I am a very mentally but also social driven person, also interested in spiritual topics and some religious aspects. I try to find a strong mental ""why"" to quit to set it against this loud voice in the morning.

The ""why"" i think should not be about physics or physical health as i think i do not suffer enough problems there (luckily).

What could this ""why"" be? 
Do you have ideas or do you have a strong why that you can use as internal motivation sentence? 
Maybe also kind of a mantra?

ideas that are in my mind are like:

""when you drink coffee you not follow your real purpose in life"" or
""just discover what will happen if you do not drink the coffee in the morning, maybe just out of curiosity"", well especially the last one with curiosity seems not to be strong enough.

do you have any ideas for spiritual or socially or even religious driven strong why to fight that coffee addiction?

thank you all a lot

nice day to you all",1,1764657291.0,decaf,0,1.0,False

I walk my 4 kids to school daily, which is a 15 minute walk each way. At first, their daughters asked to walk with us one time and I didn’t mind, but then it became every single school day. It wasn’t even something we talked about, it just turned into the girls waiting outside for me every morning. It’s not that I don’t like this family or the kids, they’re absolute sweethearts and very well behaved. What I don’t like is that I am now in charge of walking 6 young kids to school by myself and it’s simply because they don’t want to do it themselves. It seems to be a commitment that I didn’t agree to that will basically last indefinitely as we have many years left at this school together. One time, on my walk back from dropping everyone off, the mom had a Starbucks in her hand and was coming back from her car. That’s when my attitude changed and made me think…I’m taking your babies to school while you’re out getting coffee AND YOU DIDN’T EVEN OFFER ME ANY? Also, my oldest doesn’t like having to take the girls daily, he says he misses when it was just us. I have to agree with him, I miss our family time just us in the early mornings. I think because I’m a stay at home mom, people feel comfortable asking me for favors but even they make comments like wow, your hands are full and yes they are…why are you adding two more kids to me daily? Maybe I should rethink how good of friends they really are. 🥲 I feel stuck because we are close to them but it just doesn’t feel right to me anymore and I want out of this arrangement.",1,1764657063.0,Advice,7,1.0,False

I've always felt alone, weird, and misunderstood, but I see that what makes me feel so bad is not ""just me"". It's hard to explain to the other people, especially while I'm hearing those noises and they are driving me nuts. 
For me, in particular: chewing with open mouth; chewing (closed mouth) crunchy foods like apples, carrots, crisps; e-cigarette (either the buzzing noise when they are activated or the breathing after); smoking in general; foot steps behind me or in another room; children, whatever they do; many other things. 
I regularly use loops engage at home to avoid my partner's e-cigarette noise and they work very well. However, even just watching the gesture of picking and lifting the e-cigarette triggers me. 
At work I really struggle. I don't want to stay in the main canteen for coffee breaks, as it's too loud. There's a dedicated library, where you can enjoy a cup of coffee or a quiet conversation. However, people are now used to have proper meals in there, no matter what time during the day, and every single day 2-3 people starts chewing their crunchy apples and veggies. Loop engage 2 doesn't work at all and neither the ANC earphones. They might work if I play some music, but I just want to be quiet and enjoy some silence. 
Do you struggle at your workplace? I would feel awkward telling HR to do something, as it seems that it's just me having troubles with all this stuff, but I don't think that a library is meant to be used for disturbing people. ",3,1764656653.0,misophonia,5,1.0,False

hey everyone, figured i'd share some parking tips for the ultimate bullfighters event on 12/06. resorts world is awesome but parking on the strip is always a nightmare, especially when you are trying to leave right when that friday afternoon rush hour traffic hits.  
  
first, and honestly the best option if you can snag it, is checking out an app like prked. it lets people rent out their private driveways or garages right next to resorts world. it's usually way cheaper than the casino rate and you get to skip all the traffic and congestion in the main garages, plus the walk is usually shorter than finding a spot on floor 7 of the official structure.  
  
for resorts world itself, the official parking situation is pretty straightforward but pricey. self-parking is a flat $21 for the whole day, and valet starts around $40 . they do charge event pricing sometimes, so don't be shocked if the sign is a bit higher than that $21 when you pull in . if you do park here, the north-end garage is reportedly a much shorter walk to the resort entrance and casino floor than the south one .  
  
pro tip for resorts world free parking: if you are a nevada resident with a local license plate, your self-parking is complimentary . also, if you signed up for the genting rewards players club, the elite tier or higher members get free self-parking (imperial tier gets free valet) . check your card status if you have one.  
  
now for the tricky part-timing. the 1:30 pm start time means you're trying to leave around 3:30 pm or 4:00 pm, which is the exact start of the weekday commuter rush hour in vegas . the strip is already slow 24/7, but the freeways and surface streets near resorts world will be brutal . if you park in the main garage, one insider tip is to actually wait an hour after the event is over-grab a coffee or walk the casino-so you miss the big wave of cars trying to exit all at once .  
  
if you want to avoid the $21 fee entirely, there are two solid walking alternatives:  
  
1. \*\*wynn/encore:\*\* they offer a generous 3 hours of complimentary self-parking for everyone, regardless of what you are doing . resorts world is right next door; the walk is only about 1.1 miles, which takes 15-20 minutes, and it's a nice easy strip walk .  
2. \*\*fashion show mall:\*\* this is another great option as the mall often offers free parking and is also very close to resorts world . the walk is around 14 minutes (just over 4,000 feet) and puts you right on the strip near the venue .  
  
there are also still a few other places like circus circus or treasure island that have free self-parking too, if you don't mind a slightly longer walk . good luck with the bullfighters, hope this helps you save some cash and time!",1,1764656468.0,parkingguides,0,1.0,False
1pc17oc,https://i.redd.it/rpn2npdjhq4g1.jpeg,Finally finished all of the work on my Silvia.,"Bought my Silvia V3 secondhand a month or so ago from someone who I'm guessing never cleaned or descaled it. I fitted it with a new brew gasket and IMS shower screen, rebuilt the steam valve, stripped down and cleaned the OPV, which would change the bypass pressure dramatically if you tapped it - It was jammed with limescale.

Yesterday I finally finished modding it and getting it clean enough that I wasn't getting chunks of limescale flushing back in to the water tank, and little specs in the drip tray and blind basket. I don't think there's a part of the machine that I haven't touched.

Mods include an XMT7100 PID and SCR, the OEM Rancilio boiler wrap, a pressure gauge teed off the pump, and a steam wand from an Ascaso Duo, as well as a bottomless portafilter, better basket, etc.

I'm really impressed with it, and the quality of coffee it makes. Not regretting the purchase or all the work it's taken to get it here one bit.

Edit: Yeah, I did move the badge up. Felt a bit close to the PID in the original location.",9,1764656454.0,ranciliosilvia,0,1.0,False
