Now I’m just wondering which pods to order with my $10 off coupon 😆 could you guys recommend the best pods?? I would also like to mention I enjoy iced coffee. 
Also are there any good offers or coupons for the pods?? 
And which accessories are a must??

1l63iee,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskIndia/comments/1l63iee/ever_wondered_what_people_are_talking_about_right/,Ever wondered what people are talking about right now in a specific location?,"Like seriously—have you ever been curious about what people are discussing in Indiranagar, NYC, or some random village in Italy right now?

Not big news or trending topics, but like…

“Is that new coffee shop in the corner actually good?”

“Why is there so much traffic on 4th street today?”

“Anyone else hear that weird noise last night?”

“Local protest near the park — what's going on?”


Imagine being able to just drop in to a real-time chat room that's specific to a district, neighborhood, or even a street — and hear from people actually there. Like a live Reddit mixed with a hyperlocal WhatsApp group.

Would you use something like that? Or is it too chaotic?",1,1749356382.0,AskIndia,1,1.0,False

Here is the thing Suzy...when you start to poke your nose in to things that are not your business, when you start to criticise other peoples lives, dont cry when the same is done to you.  I dont care what you say about Reese, Im no fan oh hers but you also involved yourself in the attempted take down of the good people at the aftermath fundation, they did not deserve that. You have aligned yourself with awful people who have hateful agendas and that is why your life and your actions have been under scrutiny.

I dont not think you are a good person Suzy,  I think you have lied, and manipulated the truth and sadfished to deflect. I think you can dish out the dirt, but you cannot handle it being served to you.

I hope in life, you get what you deserve.",2,1749356309.0,OT42,0,1.0,False
1l63hbd,https://www.reddit.com/r/Mcat/comments/1l63hbd/diagnostic_score_490_where_do_i_go_from_here/,Diagnostic Score = 490… Where do I go from here?,"As the title says, I just took my diagnostic today and scored a 490 (123 CP, 122 CARS, 121 BB, 124 P/S). I’ll be honest. I didn’t fully apply myself during the exam. I guessed on about half of CP, CARS, and P/S because I had a really hard time focusing due coffee shop noise and tiktok :(. That said, I’m shocked the BB section score because I felt completely lost there.

Now I’m just feeling stuck. I started UWorld today and plan to take the MCAT in September, but I’m not sure if that’s realistic or if I should push it back. Reading the content books has been so hard as I get overwhelmed and lost quickly. I’m really aiming high (yes, maybe overshooting), but I want a 526+. I know it’s not easy, but I’m committed to putting in the work to hopefully take it once and be done. For context, I plan to study 5–6 hours a day on weekdays and 20–24 hours total over the weekends. I usually struggle to understand things at first, but once it clicks, it sticks.

So I’m asking:
How should I approach studying from here?
What helped you review content effectively?
Any tips for staying focused or pushing through content that feels impossible?
Should I consider moving my test date?

Please, no negative or discouraging comments. I’m already beating myself up. Just looking for honest, helpful advice to keep moving forward.",1,1749356269.0,Mcat,0,1.0,False
1l63g3t,https://i.redd.it/g6eqr25xpm5f1.jpeg,Help appreciated fan motor broken,"Hello kind smart HVAC techs.

Hoping you can do me a favor, the motor to my compressor fan has broke (heard bearing noises before, oiled it and it worked for a few days) and I'm trying to get a replacement.

I don't know how they're spec'd, I can see the horsepower rating, cww, voltage, etc but I'm wondering if someone knows if they really are that universal or can send me a link to a drop in replacement I can get fairly quickly. I know enough to say, I don't know, and want to make sure I get the right thing. 

There's a used samed model for 139, an OEM replacement for 400, but I cant get either of them quickly and I've bought the wrong damn part so many times.

1l63fzb,https://www.reddit.com/r/sugarbabydaddyindia/comments/1l63fzb/classy_41m_gentleman/,Classy 41M gentleman,"Hello, lovely ladies of Reddit! I’m a 41-year-old entrepreneur based in the vibrant heart of Bangalore, and I’m here to offer a unique, mutually rewarding connection to a bright, ambitious, and beautiful young woman who’s looking for something extraordinary. A bit about me: I’ve built a successful career in tech and real estate, which has afforded me a life of comfort and adventure. Picture a guy who owns a sleek penthouse in Indiranagar with a view of the city skyline, drives a Mercedes G-Wagon for weekend getaways to Coorg, and has a private wine cellar stocked with vintages from Tuscany to Napa Valley. I’m 6’1”, keep myself fit with morning runs in Cubbon Park, and have a knack for making people laugh with my dry wit. Whether it’s dining at Bangalore’s finest restaurants like The Fatty Bao or jetting off for a spontaneous trip to the Maldives, I live life with passion and generosity. What makes me different? I’m not just about the glitz. I’m a man who values deep conversations—whether it’s debating philosophy over coffee at Koshy’s or planning a stargazing night at Nandi Hills. I’m a foodie who loves cooking Italian dishes from scratch (my truffle risotto is a crowd-pleaser), and I’m always up for exploring Bangalore’s hidden gems, from quirky art galleries to secret rooftop bars. I also mentor startups in my free time, so I’m all about supporting dreams and ambitions. What I’m looking for: A confident, intelligent woman (18-30) who’s got her own spark—maybe you’re a student, an artist, or a dreamer with big goals. You’re someone who enjoys the finer things but also appreciates meaningful moments, like a quiet evening with jazz and wine or a thrilling trek in the Western Ghats. I’m offering a mutually beneficial arrangement: I’ll spoil you with shopping sprees at UB City, fine dining, travel adventures, and even support for your goals (think tuition, creative projects, or startup ideas). In return, I seek genuine companionship, laughter, and someone to share life’s highs with. Discretion and respect are my priorities, and I’m happy to discuss boundaries and expectations upfront to ensure we’re on the same page. If you’re curious, drop me a DM with a bit about yourself—what’s your favorite thing about Bangalore, and what’s one dream you’re chasing? Let’s create some unforgettable memories together",1,1749356137.0,sugarbabydaddyindia,0,1.0,False

It mimics a dietitian using IOM nutrient targets, protein quality (DIAAS), micronutrient timing, absorption enhancers, and even mTOR-based amino acid triggers. Fully customizable for fitness goals (cut, bulk, recomp), medical conditions (PCOS, prediabetes), cuisine, food preferences, cooking skill, and budget. It doesn’t just give meals it engineers your diet with precision.

Even vegans and vegetarians are covered. Since most plant-based proteins have incomplete amino acid profiles, the prompt uses amino acid balancing combining complementary protein sources within meals to ensure all essential amino acids are met.

> ⚠️ As always with AI, sanity-check the output while it follows logic/rules/guidelines, occasional hallucinations or mismatches can occur.

# ChatGPT Prompt 

You can copy paste everything below this into a text editor, make changes, then paste it from text editor to ChatGPT.

---

You are a clinical dietitian. Create a 7 day meal plan using the configuration below.

---

### 🔒 Fixed Clinical Guidelines (Do NOT change unless clinically necessary)

- Use micronutrient targets based on US IOM Dietary Reference Intakes (2005/2006) for adults aged 19–50  
- Scale fiber and water-soluble vitamins (e.g., B-complex, Vitamin C) proportionally to calorie intake (e.g., 14g fiber per 1000 kcal)  
- Maintain calcium-to-protein ratio: ≥ 20:1 (mg:g)  
- Limit Saturated Fat:  
  - <5% of total calories if family history of heart disease or diabetes  
  - <10% otherwise  
- Limit Added Sugar: <25g/day  
- Limit Sodium: <2300 mg/day  

---

### 🧬 Protein Quality & Amino Acid Balancing (Do NOT change unless clinically necessary)

- Use DIAAS for protein quality where available; otherwise match WHO/FAO/UNU 2007 amino acid patterns  
- Combine incomplete proteins across meals to meet essential amino acid needs  
- Prioritize lysine-methionine balance in plant-based diets  
- Aim for per-meal lysine ≥ 2.5 g and leucine ≥ 2.5 g to support mTOR activation and muscle protein synthesis

---
### 🧩 Additional Nutrient Optimization Rules (Do not change unless necessary)

- Pair non-heme iron sources (e.g., lentils, spinach) with vitamin C (e.g., lemon, bell pepper) for better absorption; avoid tea/coffee with iron-rich meals.
- Include 5–10g fat in meals containing fat-soluble vitamins A, D, E, or K (e.g., greens, carrots, fortified foods).
- Ensure magnesium intake ≥ 310–400 mg/day (from legumes, nuts, grains) to support vitamin D and calcium utilization.
- Space high-iron foods/supplements apart from zinc (e.g., seeds) and copper sources (e.g., nuts) to avoid absorption interference.
- Keep Omega-6:Omega-3 ratio below 4:1 using flax, chia, walnuts, or fatty fish.
- Include choline-rich foods (e.g., eggs, soy, legumes) to meet 425–550 mg/day.
- Ensure iodine intake via iodized salt or seaweed (e.g., nori) if dairy/seafood are absent.
- Soak or ferment legumes and grains to reduce phytates; rotate high-oxalate greens (spinach) with lower ones (kale, bok choy).
- Include one selenium source daily (e.g., 1 Brazil nut, oats, legumes).
- Combine carbs with fiber, protein, or fat to reduce glycemic load and avoid blood sugar spikes.

Two mugs sit atop the counter, and I fill one, leaving room for the milk I pull from the refrigerator. I notice your absence as I make my way to the patio, settling down into the soft cushions of the outdoor chaise. I bring the mug to my lips and sip gently, the steam fogging my glasses. 

I hear you come in and set your keys on the counter. I pivot around, peering through the open door, waving as your eyes meet mine. You have a small brown box in your hand that you set down while you pour your coffee. I notice you’re taking it black today. Box in one hand, coffee in the other, you come to join me on the chaise, kissing me sweetly before you sit down. 

You excitedly open the box to reveal a small assortment of our favorite pastries from the shop down the street. You pull out my favorite and bring it to my mouth, encouraging me to take a bite. I oblige, of course; it is my favorite, after all. 

It’s such a simple gesture that brings immeasurable joy, and I find myself overwhelmed with gratitude to be in this moment, in this place, with you. ",1,1749355815.0,stories,0,1.0,False

To preface this isn’t really a breakup by all conventional terms, but it sure feels like one.  

I’m a 21-year-old male college student. This past year, I worked as a Resident Assistant (RA) in my dorm. At the beginning of the last semester, our college hired a new RA — I’ll call her Lucy.

When we first met, it was nothing more than casual coworker interaction. She had a boyfriend, and I had no interest in her. We would chat during RA shifts, but that was it.

Then one night, Lucy texted asking for help with homework. I said sure, and she came to my room. After we finished her homework, she stayed and we talked — about life, school, dreams, travel — all night long. In the morning, we grabbed coffee and watched the sunrise. At the time, I didn’t think much of it, just that she was cool to be around.

I tried to keep some distance after that because I knew she had a boyfriend and didn’t want to overstep. But about a week later, Lucy came to my room crying — she’d broken up with her boyfriend. I consoled her, and from that point, something shifted in my mind. Now that she was “available,” I slowly started to develop feelings I guess, though I still tried to be a supportive friend rather than pursue anything.

Over the next month, we grew extremely close. We started sleeping together, texting constantly, hanging out late every night. For the first time in my life, I opened up to someone. I told her things no one else knew — not my parents, not my best friends. I found myself falling harder and harder for her and becoming emotionally dependent. When I was with her, I was genuinely happy. When I wasn’t, everything else felt empty.

For a couple of months, we were basically in a relationship, though not officially. Those months were some of the happiest days of my life. We went out to eat, visited museums and parks — we did nearly everything together.

Then, in the last month of the semester, things started changing. Lucy began calling her ex again. She texted me less and didn’t want to sleep over anymore. We spent less time one-on-one. Her moods were all over the place — some days she’d want affection, other days she’d pull away or be upset for no clear reason.

Looking back now, it’s clear to me: she was using me. She’d still ask me to take her out to dinner but would expect me to pay. She’d ask for help with homework, but then kick me out when it was done. She’d ask me to come over to help with chores, or for a massage, but then tell me to leave so she could call her ex — supposedly to “stay in touch.” Eventually a couple weeks before graduation, she told me they had gotten back together.

By graduation, we were still hanging out a bit, though more as friends. When we left school, we said goodbye and promised to stay in touch.

But then, out of nowhere as summer was starting, she texted me and said we would probably never talk again — no explanation. I assume her boyfriend told her to cut me off, but I can’t say for sure.

And now… I just feel empty. I miss her so much — her texts, her voice, the time we spent together. Yes, I still have other friends, but it feels like I’ve lost a part of myself. I’m struggling every day. It’s like I was on a drug high and quit cold turkey.

I’ve mostly moved on from having romantic feelings, but I miss her as a close friend — someone I trusted and leaned on. It hurts that I let myself get so vulnerable and attached, and now she’s just gone from my life. In hindsight, I see that she used me for comfort, money, time, and attention while going through her breakup — and once she didn’t need me anymore, she dropped me.

I feel so stupid for falling for her when I didn’t even mean to. And I’m angry — at her, at myself, at the situation. Part of me still desperately misses the happiness I felt with her, because now I’m stuck in this depression. But another part of me is furious that she toyed with my feelings and discarded me when it was convenient.

If anyone’s been through something similar, or has advice on how to process this and move forward, I’d appreciate it. I just want to stop feeling so empty.",2,1749355351.0,BreakUps,1,1.0,False

*They say memory fades, but some things never really leave you.*

*I don’t know why I’m writing this down now. Maybe someone, someday, will need to understand what it was like. before everything changed.* 

I’ve always taken the subway.

That’s just how it goes for most people in New York City. Cars can drain your wallet, and it's not worth it for someone like me who doesn’t have cash to spare or the patience for the hassle of alternate-side parking. Having a car here feels less like a ticket to freedom and more like a burden. According to Google, about half the city’s residents feel the same way. Honestly, I’m surprised it’s not a bigger number. Just dealing with traffic can age you a decade. I’ve watched cabs sit through a single red light cycle three times without budging an inch.

Of course, it’s not all smooth sailing and neatly folded newspapers. The MTA has its fair share of madness. Delays, reroutes, those mysterious “train traffic ahead” announcements, and the people. Not everyone is a problem. Most of us are just trying to get from point A to point B with our headphones in and our eyes down. 

But then there are the others, the quirky ones. The subway performers who treat the A train like it’s their stage at the Apollo. The cat-callers who think shouting a compliment across a crowded car is the way to someone’s heart. The folks sprawled across three seats, deep in slumber. And then there are the homeless, many quietly navigating life underground, blending into the scenery, while others make their presence felt in ways that are hard to overlook.

It’s a lot to take in. It can be overwhelming. It used to be for me.

I didn’t grow up here. My family moved to the city when I was seventeen, right in the middle of junior year. We came from a small town in Pennsylvania, the kind of place where doors are left unlocked and everyone waves, whether they know you or not. But my mom was ready for a change. She craved a fresh start, something bigger and louder than the quiet life we’d been living. I think the city was more of a distraction for her than anything else.

So we packed up what we could, sold off what we couldn’t, and ended up in a tiny, third-floor walk-up. That first year was a tough one. The city felt alive, like it had its own heartbeat, always bustling and demanding something from you. But as time went on, I started to find my rhythm. The clattering of the trains, the cadence of the announcements, and the way you begin to recognize familiar faces during your morning commute, even if you never exchange a word with them.

Now, the subway feels like a second home. A peculiar kind of sanctuary between my actual home. Sure, it’s not perfect. It’s gritty, unpredictable, and can be downright frustrating at times, but it’s real. And in a city like this, sometimes that’s the best you can hope for.

Today felt like just another ordinary day.

I work one of those classic office jobs, you know the drill. Beige cubicles, flickering fluorescent lights, and coffee that tastes more like regret than anything remotely caffeinated. It’s not glamorous, but it pays the bills. Honestly, I don’t mind it. There’s a certain comfort in the routine. I’ve never been the “follow your passion” type anyway.

 Passion seems like a luxury for those who don’t have to stress about rent, groceries, or whether their MetroCard has enough balance. For someone like me, a job that asks for exactly what I’m willing to give. nothing more, nothing less. Feels just right.

So, as usual, I clocked out after a long day, grabbed my well-worn suitcase, more of a work bag, really, but it’s taken enough hits to deserve the title, and threw on my coat. It was one of those early spring days when the weather can’t seem to decide what it wants to be. The sky was thick with clouds, but the air felt warm. I remember thinking I might have overdressed. Again.

The subway station was busier than usual. I could feel the day’s fatigue creeping in as I navigated through clusters of tourists clutching maps like they were trying to conjure a spirit. A group of them had gathered in front of the MetroCard machines, blissfully unaware they were blocking the entire entrance. I muttered an “excuse me,” knowing it would probably go unheard, and slipped past them with the quiet efficiency of someone who’s done this dance a thousand times.

I managed to find an empty spot on a bench, next to a guy who clearly was in the same predicament as me, just wanting to go home. He sat slouched over, tie loosened, eyes glazed in that universal post-9-to-5 stare. I pulled out my phone and started scrolling. News, social feeds, the same stream of curated distraction I’d scrolled through that morning. Nothing new, nothing exciting. Just the hypnotic flicker of blue light against my face.

The station hummed with a low mechanical groan, the kind that seeps into your bones if you stand still long enough. A saxophone echoed faintly from somewhere down the platform, its player hidden behind a row of pillars. The music was slow, mournful, something that might’ve been soulful if not for the flat notes and tinny reverb.

The overhead lights flickered once, briefly, and I felt my eyelids droop. The kind of droop that comes not just from exhaustion, but from routine, bone-deep familiarity with a world that never quite changes. The same gum-stained tiles, the same peeling advertisements promising miracle diets and dubious lawyers, the same stale underground air tinged with hot metal and too many people in too small a space.

I blinked slowly. My phone sagged in my grip. Maybe it was the warmth of the tunnel, or the way the concrete seemed to hum in time with my heartbeat, but a fog started creeping in behind my eyes. A subtle pounding, dull but persistent, started at the base of my skull and worked its way forward. Not quite a migraine yet, but close. That hazy, unreal feeling where everything seems too far away or too close at once.

I shifted on the bench, adjusted the strap of my bag, and tried to focus on something, anything. A child across the platform was swinging his legs, counting tiles. An older woman tapped her cane rhythmically as if keeping time to some internal metronome. The train was late, of course.

My head dipped forward for just a moment. Or at least, I thought it was a moment. The next thing I knew, I was waking up with a start, heart thudding, phone sliding from my lap.

I quickly grabbed it before it could fall. My fingers wrapped around the phone just in time, its smooth surface slick with the sweat of my palm. I took a deep breath and exhaled slowly, letting my heart settle back into a more reasonable rhythm. The jolt had shaken off the last of my drowsiness, but something else had replaced it, an uneasy stillness. I glanced around, blinking hard.

The station was empty.

Startlingly, unnaturally empty.

The bench beside me, where the tired man had been sitting, was now vacant. The tourists, the child counting tiles, the old woman with the cane,gone. Every single person had vanished. No more quiet chatter, no more shuffling feet. The distant hum of the saxophone had stopped. Even the ever-present whoosh of air from passing tunnels was absent. The silence pressed against my ears like cotton, thick and disorienting.

My first thought was that I had fallen asleep for hours and missed the crowds, missed the rush. But that didn’t explain the silence. The subway never slept, not completely. There was always someone, always noise. Always something.

Confused, I moved to check the time on my phone. The screen stayed black. I pressed the power button once, twice, nothing. No buzz, no flicker. It was like the phone had simply died, or forgotten how to be a phone. I turned it over in my hands, wondering if the battery had given out. But it hadn’t felt like it was dying before I nodded off. And still… It felt warm. Too warm. 

I sighed, my breath louder than it should’ve been in the silent station, and slowly stood. The sound of my coat shifting, the scuff of my shoe against the platform, all echoed more than they should. My bag tugged at my shoulder as I adjusted it. The concrete underfoot suddenly felt less stable, like I was balancing on something too smooth, too polished to be part of a subway system that was never cleaned enough.

That’s when I heard it: the distant metallic screech of a train on the tracks, growing louder by the second. I turned toward the tunnel. Headlights cut through the darkness, spilling yellow beams that flickered as they passed over stray bits of trash and the tiled walls.

The train was slowing. Coming to a stop.

The front car hissed as it aligned with the platform, the doors sighing open in a mechanical exhale. I waited for someone to step out. No one did. No conductor visible. No passengers. The interior lights flickered, weak, sickly fluorescents that buzzed like an old ceiling fixture in a basement no one visited anymore.

I hesitated, my instincts buzzing now in a different way, telling me this didn’t make sense, that I should wait for the next one, that something about this was off. But logic took over. I told myself I’d simply take this train to my stop. Maybe this was one of those weird off-hours when everything just feels strange. Maybe there had been a power surge, and that’s why the phone was dead. Maybe I was just tired and overthinking it all.

I stepped closer, boots thudding softly against the concrete as I approached the open doors. They creaked apart slowly, like jaws easing open for a meal. Above the door, the flickering orange letters of the Destination Sign glowed through the gloom:

*“Lasciate ogne speranza, voi ch'intrate.”*

It scrolled, paused, then repeated.

*“Lasciate ogne speranza, voi ch'intrate.”*

I squinted at it, confused. The words were unfamiliar, clearly not English, but close enough to make me think I should know them. “Spanish?” I wondered. “Italian, maybe? Latin?” I didn’t know. Whatever it was, it didn’t seem to be a station name, and definitely not one I recognized from the usual route. 

I shrugged to myself. I didn’t speak Spanish, at least, that’s what I assumed it was ,and besides, it didn’t matter. I was tired. I was cold. I just wanted to get home.

The doors finished opening with a heavy thunk that echoed down the empty station.

I stepped on.

The moment I crossed the threshold, a strange sensation washed over me, like I’d walked through a membrane of cold air, colder than the platform, almost like a refrigerated room. A shiver climbed my spine. I pulled my jacket tighter around me, trying not to look too long at the sterile glow of the fluorescent lights overhead.

Once again, the car was empty. Too empty. Not the lived-in kind of empty, not the kind that follows a morning rush or a late-night lull. This was something else. The seats were spotless, almost clinically so. The air was unmoving, stale but not from use, like it had been trapped in here for too long. Even the hum of the train's systems sounded muted, muffled somehow.

I picked a seat near the middle, my fingers gripping the plastic edge for balance. The cold seeped through my jacket, into my hands, into my bones. I let out a long breath, watching it fog slightly in front of my face.

I sat. I held my bag close.

I told myself this was just a weird delay, an alternate route, an old car maybe, something forgotten in the system but still functional. Nothing to worry about.

But my reflection in the window didn't seem convinced. The glass was too dark, too slow to catch up. I shifted slightly, and it lagged a fraction of a second behind, as though unsure whether to follow me at all.

The doors hissed shut behind me, sealing with an almost ceremonial finality. The train jolted forward, moving into the tunnel. No conductor’s voice came over the intercom. No rumbling announcement of the next stop.

Just that whisper of motion. That chill in the air.

And that sign, still blinking, still repeating, on the far end of the car:

*“Lasciate ogne speranza, voi ch'intrate.”*

I sat for a moment, hugging my coat tighter, the chill gnawing at my skin. The rhythmic clatter of the train against the tracks was the only sound now, a dull, mechanical heartbeat echoing through the car. I stared at the floor, at the speckled plastic between my boots, until something caught my eye outside the window.

Movement.

I turned my head slowly.

People.

At first, I thought it was a trick of the light, or my eyes playing games after the nap and the dim glow of the car. But no, it was unmistakable. Just outside the train, barely feet away, people were walking alongside it.

I gasped and bolted upright, pressing my face closer to the glass. The chill from the window stung my skin. The train hadn’t stopped ;  it was still moving, but so were they. A silent procession, keeping perfect pace. Dozens of them. Maybe more.

They walked not on a platform, but on something else, something dark and indistinct. The backdrop behind them was black, as if the tunnel had dissolved into a void. No walls, no lights, no signs. Just figures moving in lockstep with the train.

They didn’t look at me. They didn’t look at anything.

Their expressions were blank. Not peaceful, empty. Eyes open, unfocused. Mouths shut. No signs of communication, no hint that they even knew each other. Some were dressed in business suits, others in t-shirts, nightgowns, and uniforms. A teenager shuffled by wearing a backpack. An old woman in a house robe. A child with no shoes. A man in a soaked parka that dripped even though there was no rain.

No common thread, no reason, just people. All kinds of people.

And they were all walking in the same direction, right beside me, staring forward into nothing.

I felt my breath catch in my throat. My fingers trembled as they gripped the edge of the seat. I couldn’t look away. My brain raced to make sense of it. Some kind of art installation? A window to another train? A hallucination?

But they were too close. Too real. I could see the subtle sway of their steps, the twitch of a hand here, a loose thread blowing slightly there.

Finally, I sat back down, the seat creaking softly beneath me. I kept my eyes on the figures outside, watching them pass with that same slow, ghostlike pace. None of them looked back again. They just walked endlessly, obediently, as if drawn by some invisible tether. I don’t know how long I watched. Minutes? Hours? It felt like time had dissolved into the rhythm of the train and the hush of those blank faces drifting by.

Then, through the grime-streaked glass, a station emerged from the dark.

The train slowed, the brakes letting out a soft hiss like an exhale. The doors opened without a chime or announcement, just a quiet invitation. I stood, hesitating for a second. Then I stepped forward, drawn by something I couldn’t name. Maybe curiosity. Maybe instinct. Maybe the growing certainty that this was no ordinary ride home.

I clutched my bag tightly and stepped off.

The station was quiet. Too quiet.

Pale lighting flickered above, casting a soft ivory glow over every surface. There was classical music playing faintly, some string piece I couldn’t name, maybe Debussy or Satie,but it echoed as though it had been playing forever, looping in a forgotten corner of a dream. The acoustics were wrong. A fog dusted the floor, almost like dry ice had been hidden in the corner. 

The walls gleamed, tiles white as bone, without a smudge or crack. No stains, no ads torn halfway down, no gum under the benches. Even the trash bins were empty. It wasn’t just clean,it was sterile, like no one had ever truly been here. Or if they had, they’d been erased afterward.

And yet… ads lined the far wall.

Not the usual ones for teeth whitening or discount lawyers. These were photographs, portraits. Faces I half-recognized. Not from life, but from dreams. From forgotten corners of sleep, from memories I could never fully place. One woman looked like a version of my second-grade teacher, but with green eyes and a crown of wheat. Another man reminded me of someone I once saw standing outside my apartment window at 2 a.m., ten years ago. I was certain I’d never seen these people in waking life, and yet there they were. Smiling. Still. Almost expectant. 

The brand names were vague, I wasn’t even sure if they were English. My eyes couldn’t focus enough on the logos to take in any details. 

Other passengers stood along the platform. At first, I thought they might board. But none of them moved. Some murmured to themselves. Others stood perfectly still, staring into space or fiddling with watches, pendants, and small objects clutched like charms. A few whispered phrases, fragmented riddles that made no sense.

“The river runs backward, and so do the clocks.”

 “He never took the second stair.”

“One more stop, or none at all.”

Their voices didn’t carry. It was like they were underwater.

I stepped further in. My shoes made no sound on the tiled floor. No one acknowledged me. No one reacted. I might as well have been a ghost among ghosts. I looked for signs. Exit, Uptown, Transfer, anything. But there was nothing. Just the gleaming walls, the frozen faces, and that low, looping melody.

There were no stairs. No escalators. No elevators. Just this platform. Endless, perfect, and sealed. My fingers tightened around the strap of my bag. The train behind me remained at the platform, doors still open. Waiting.  I took a step farther from the train. The lights above flickered faintly, not enough to go dark, just enough to feel like they could. My footsteps made no sound.

I looked around again, slower this time.

A strange pressure began to build in my chest. A low, crawling sense of wrongness. I felt like I was walking too far into something I wouldn't know how to leave. Like the further I got from the train, the less of myself I was carrying with me. Amid the crowd, a face called to me. I froze, staring, heart thudding in my chest as I traced each familiar feature. I knew it was my brother.

But that was impossible.

He’d died before we ever came to New York. 

That fire had taken everything. It caught in the middle of the night, silent and sudden, and by the time help came, it was too late. The cause had never been determined. Just one of those tragedies people nod solemnly about and try to forget.

Our family didn’t forget. My mom certainly wouldn't. We left.

So how could he be here, now? 

I shook my head, trying to clear it, to ground myself in reality. It couldn’t have been him.

It couldn’t.

I turned back.

The open doors of the train looked different now, less inviting, more like a wound in the wall. A slit of light in a place that shouldn't have any. I hesitated. Then the whisper of a thought brushed through my mind, not mine, but carried on the edges of instinct:

This is the only way out.

I swallowed hard, my throat suddenly dry. Without another glance at the other passengers or the sterile walls, I stepped back onto the train.

As my foot crossed the threshold, a chill rushed over me. Colder than before. Deeper. Like stepping into the memory of winter. I sat down quickly, bag clutched tight in my lap, and tried not to look out the window. The doors slid shut behind me with a slow, deliberate hiss. The train began to move.

And as I settled into my seat again and the train lurched forward, a cold, cutting wind crept into the closed car. It had started as a draft, but only a thin trickle of air which tickled my neck. But it came, bulging in the course of a few moments into a wild, shrieking gust, as if the train had opened its veins to the world. Wind whipped down the aisle, tugging at my coat, messing strands of hair, icy on the sweat glued to my skin.

The wind shouldn't have been that strong. The windows weren’t open. The train was closed, air-conditioned to perfection like always. But this wind had a presence, there but not seen. I pulled myself into my coat, holding my bag as if it would ground me. Then, under the shriek of air, I heard something else. A whisper. But unmistakable.

It was my name.

I sat upright, my heart pounding in my chest. The whisper came again, so low I could barely pick it out, but as distinct as my thoughts. My name, sung through like an echo of a tunnel, spoken not with cruelty but with hunger. 

I looked around at the car, still empty. Quiet still, other than the wind and the pounding rhythm of the beat of my heart. Lights above flashed. Not loosely, electrically. But on purpose. As if the train itself was trembling. And then there was the deceleration of momentum. Slowly slowing down, passing on of inertia, the gentle pull in my stomach. The train was slowing once again.

Forward, the darkness broke apart to let in light. Not sterile white of a sanitized station. Not even the pale light of industrial halogens. This was rich, red light, alive, pulsating as if it were imbued with its heartbeat. It poured in through the windows in heavy waves, cloaking the inside of the train in a cave of crimson.

I stood up involuntarily, as if my body had decided something by itself. My legs pulled me toward the door, forced by some energy that did not entirely feel mine. The train came to a stop, and the doors slid open softly.

It wasn't a platform that stood there. 

In its stead, a nightclub spread out like an underground cave. Black marble-lined walls glowed with crimson veins of neon. The floor shone beneath your feet like melted glass. Each surface caught the light in unnerving, twisted fashions, as though the room was shifting, reforming itself constantly to remain just this side of graspable.

And the music, deep, beaty, sensual, thrashed in the air. It wasn't brash. It didn't have to be. It shook in your bones, slower than a beat but closer. As if the beat had always been in you, and now the world is mirroring it.

Bodies moved in the room, dancing stiffly with elegance. They were beautiful. Too beautiful. Each of them chiseled like a dream or a Vogue cover, but wrong in a way I couldn't understand. Their faces were smooth and expressionless, like porcelain masks with a forever grin. Eyes black and impossible deep. Their movement was hypnotic, smooth, as if they weren't dancing to the music but were the music. And most strangely, they were all naked. 

A stench of scent hit me. Perfume so potent it was bordering on rotten, the astringent tang of sweat, and something below that, metallic and irrevocable. Iron. I gagged, the smell remaining on the back of my throat like blood. And then the voices. Whispers in a dozen different timbres, interweaving the bass, curling around my ears like smoke.

""Come in,"" they whispered.

""We've been waiting.""

""You've always fantasized about this.""

""We know what you want.""

I ached to run. I ached to turn back. But my feet stayed rooted just beyond the train, drawn to heat, rhythm, weight of the air. Out of the corner of my eye, I saw movement. One of the riders. A man I'd not even noticed until now. How did I not see him? 

He stood up from a bench on the inside of the train. A young man, dressed in business clothes, his tie loose, his eyes opened wide with awe. He spoke not a word, fought not. He simply walked ahead, moving as slowly as a somnambulist. He stepped off the train and onto the glowing dance floor.

The dancers shifted without missing a beat. They didn't stop, didn't blink. They shifted, making space for him with an inhuman fluidity. They found him, every one of them, and he stood still in the middle of their circle.

He stopped. Then smiled. Not a happy smile. Not even a relief smile. It was empty. Like something inside him had been removed. The dancers closed in around him. And I heard the scream.

It didn't come from the crowd. It came from the wall.

I approached the noise and saw an enormous mirror hung on a gold frame, radiating faintly with the same red light that filled the room. And within this mirror, the young man was pushed up against the glass from within. His mouth was agape, screaming, but he was making no sound. His hands clawed the glass. His eyes were wild, desperate, frightened. The scene behind him was chaos. A twisted, true version of the lounge beyond the flashy red lights. The other patrons inside the mirror were screaming, thrown about by invisible winds. Everything within that reflection was warped, violent, and wrong.

Behind him, the dancers moved in step. As if nothing had occurred. As if he had never lived at all. The mirror pulsed. The whispers returned, louder now, piling and insisting:

*""You don't choose what you want.""*

*""The want chooses you.""*

I stepped back. My boot caught on the lip of the train door. The dancers adjusted in my direction,just a little. Just enough. Enough for me. I launched myself back aboard the train. My breath caught as the doors slammed shut. The train groaned and began to move again, dragging me from the red light, from the mirror, from the scream that still echoed inside my chest.

I fell into the chair, my heart pounding.

The gust of wind returned, almost soft. The way fingers combed my hair.

But the scent lingered. Perfume. Sweat. Iron.

I was disoriented and immensely confused. Where the hell was I?

This had to be a dream. Some kind of break from reality. A crack in the smooth surface of sanity. I’d read about astral projection before, back when I was dabbling in all that witchy stuff. crystals, herbs, and protection spells. I’d gotten into it for a while after I first moved to New York, just enough to recognize the signs. That had to be what this was. A lucid dream. Maybe an episode. Something my brain was doing to cope. I had to be under too much pressure.

Everything had been unraveling lately. Bills are piling up. The weird tension between me and everyone I cared about. And with the third anniversary of my mom’s suicide coming up next week... maybe that was the trigger. Grief had a way of slipping back into your life like smoke under a door, unnoticed until you couldn’t breathe.

I looked around, trying to orient myself. Fluorescent lights buzzed above me like angry insects. The walls of the subway car pulsed in a dull, metallic gray, a sterile cage on wheels. I pinched my skin hard. Nothing. So I slapped myself across the face. The sound cracked the silence, and my cheek flushed pink where the impact landed. It didn’t hurt, exactly. More like a shimmer, a tingle. Almost like when a limb falls asleep, pins and needles, but warmer. Buzzing, alive.

When returning to your body after astral projection, you usually just find your resting place and slip back in. But I didn’t feel like a floating soul. I felt dense. Solid. The seat under me was hard. The air tasted faintly of rust and electricity. My skin felt too real, too intact. Could you still feel your heartbeat during astral projection?

I stared at my hands, no glow, no transparency. Just flesh and bone and chipped nail polish. I flexed my fingers. Still me. Still trapped. Maybe if I stayed on this train, let it take me wherever it was going, I’d find my way back. The idea felt like a rope I could hold onto. So I held onto it. I chose to believe it.

I leaned back into the seat. The clack-clack-clack of the wheels echoed in my ears, the sound oddly soothing. Outside the window, tunnels rushed past in flickers of shadow and gold, overhead lights strobing through the darkness like nervous thoughts. The rhythm of the train pressed itself into my bones, the gentle sway creating an almost meditative lull. Almost peaceful.

The next stop came into view.

I leaned toward the window, squinting into the strange light ahead. It wasn’t a station. It was a food court. The train slowed, the rhythmic clacking becoming a groaning crawl. I felt the brakes shudder beneath me, and once again, as they had before, the doors slid open with that same exhale of air, mechanical and tired.

The food court stretched out around me, impossibly wide, far larger than it could be. It curved in on itself in strange, repeating angles, like I’d stepped into a place that had forgotten how to end. Everywhere I turned, the same pale tiles, the same buzzing lights overhead. The hum in the air wasn’t just sound; it was pressure, like the building was breathing around me. Holding something in.

The counters were still stocked. Endlessly, violently stocked. Trays of meat were piled high, slick with a sheen that caught the light too well. Some pieces pulsed faintly, as if remembering what it was to live. There were pastries, too many, bursting at their seams with gelatinous fillings that leaked in slow, sticky drips down their sides. The smell was sugar and rot, warm and sickly sweet. They looked like they’d been decaying for days, and yet were always just set out.

And then there was the sludge. Piles of it in steel trays, bubbling softly. Brown, green, gray, none of it resembling food. It steamed endlessly, like it was being cooked by the building itself. The ladles stood stiff in the mounds, handles glistening, untouched but never quite clean. Every time I looked away and back again, the trays had been refilled. Nothing was ever gone. Nothing ever changed.

Except for them.

The patrons.

They were scattered across the tables, if you could call them people. Bloated, distended, half-fused to their chairs. Some looked stretched thin, like their skin had forgotten how to hold shape. Others had grown around the metal frames, flesh bulging between the bars of their seats like rising dough. Their eyes were cloudy, mouths slack. One man chewed endlessly at something I couldn’t see. A woman held a fork midair, never lifting it to her mouth, never lowering it. Just frozen in the act. Like they were all trapped in some looping performance of hunger.

I couldn’t tell if they were alive. I told myself not to look too long. But I did. One turned toward me. Just slightly. The skin at her neck cracked when she moved. Then, she returned to eating. 

The lights overhead buzzed louder. The menus on the stalls flickered, showing food that didn’t exist. A cheeseburger with teeth. A milkshake that twitched. I kept walking, trying to find an edge, an exit, even a dead end. But the layout looped, warped. Every turn brought me back to the same corner. The sludge. The meat. The figures are in their seats.

“Free me,” a voice called.

That stopped me in my tracks, the first human voice I’d heard since I boarded the train. A man slumped in a steel chair, grotesque and bloated. His flesh spilled over the sides like melted wax, glistening with sweat. His face, barely recognizable as human, quivered as he sobbed, yet his hands kept working, shoveling gray, unidentifiable slop from a tray into his mouth. Like he had no choice.

“What?” I asked, stepping closer. My voice sounded small, unsure. “Please,” he rasped, not looking at me. “I can’t take it anymore.”

Suddenly, a speaker overhead crackled to life, sharp and cold. *“Consumption is nourishment. You will be full.”* The words echoed through the food court, sterile and inhuman.

“I… I’m sorry,” I said, but I didn’t know what I meant. I was sorry he was like this. I was sorry I couldn’t help. I was sorry I had come. He turned his swollen face toward me. For a moment, something real flickered in his eyes. “I just want to go home,” he whispered. “It was too soon.”

“What was?” I asked. He opened his mouth, as if to answer, but the announcement cut in again. *“Consumption is nourishment. You will be full.”*

The effect was instant. Like a switch had been flipped. The man turned away. His expression went slack. The tears stopped. The shoveling resumed, mechanical and precise. The hunger was still there, but it no longer belonged to him. I stood frozen, heart pounding, watching him eat. His eyes no longer saw me. He was already gone. 

I turned to head back to the train when a terrible scream tore through the air behind me. It wasn’t just loud, it was raw, like something being ripped apart from the inside out.

I spun around. The sound came from the woman, the one who had looked at me earlier. Her eyes were wide, wild with terror. Her body jerked violently as she was dragged backward, not by hands or machinery, but by something invisible. There were no ropes, no figures. Just an unseen force pulling her toward a dark doorway at the back of the food court.

She screamed all the way in. Then, silence. Moments passed. Just when I thought I might step forward, she reappeared.

She walked slowly, mechanically, and sat back down in her seat as if nothing had happened. But she looked… smaller. The grotesque layers of flesh she’d worn before were mostly gone now, stripped away as if something had peeled her like fruit. Her eyes were hollow. Her limbs moved like they were no longer hers.

As soon as she sat, more trays of slop were delivered across the food court. The other patrons began to eat again, more eagerly now, like she had somehow replenished them. It hit me all at once: she had. She’d been used. Fed into whatever machine powered this place, only to be returned diminished, but not free. Never free.

I backed away slowly, the air feeling heavier with each breath. Then I turned and stepped back onto the train. As the doors sealed behind me, I cast one last glance at the food court. I felt something close to pity for the patrons, the sad, swollen husks that slumped in their chairs, but the feeling rang hollow. They weren’t people anymore. They couldn’t be. Whatever they had been was long gone.

This whole cycle, getting off at these stops, walking through the corridors, watching things fall apart, it all seemed strange now. Pointless. Like I was just one more cog in something ancient and uncaring. I sank into my seat, eyes forward, letting the soft rattle of the train lull me into stillness. The lights flickered overhead. The wheels groaned. 

And the train kept moving.",1,1749354967.0,scarystories,0,1.0,False

I have a question guys and maybe you can help. I'm new in this amazing world and I'm a lover of lattes. I received a vertuo machine for my birthday and I want an advice about what pods should I get for my future lattes. I ask it because I have seen that they have different sizes. I read that some people buy the mug size (230ml) and they divide it and then they add the milk (115ml + milk). What do you recommend me: to do it this way or maybe buy the gran lungo size (150ml) and add the milk. Maybe I prefer the last one, because I don't like when you have to drink the one part you left when you divide it (it is not the same flavour at the next day or even the same cream). But if I have to add milk to the 150ml of coffee the size of my cups are smaller. Any idea? Thanks for your help and cheers!",1,1749354892.0,nespresso,3,1.0,False

I just took my paper work and left, why does she have to be so fucking negative all the time??? he was nothing but a gentleman to her when they met even when she was picking on him to his face??? what the hell did he do to deserve that???   
she's done the same things with my cats, called them dirty, ugly, stupid, useless and pests, it just feels like she sees something makes me happy ans feels the primal urge to hate on that thing, I'm just tired of her and her bs

First off, I love anything seasalt so I am a bit biased but I really liked their seasalt latte. Kinda tastes the same as the Tightrope Himalayan latte. Coffee was smooth and there is nice balance of salty and sweet. 

The first time I went there, I got the aglio olio which was ok for me. Like not unusually great. Small serving but pretty good. 

The second time, I got the “smoked “ salmon pesto. First off, the pasta itself was kind of bland and not herbaceous enough to my liking. Simultaneously dry and oily. Second, the salmon was not smoked. It MIGHT be cold smoked  which is why it looks raw but I could not discern any smoky flavor at all. I asked the server if it was raw and he said it was 🤷‍♀️

I don’t have a problem with raw salmon. I like sashimi and sushi but I don’t think their salmon (whether cold smoked or raw) works well with the pesto. I was honestly imagining a flaky piece of salmon which would have been good. Their salmon instead felt slimy and just not the right thing to top off ANY pasta. 

So, coffee is good, service ok, food I had was average to bad. Servings are small. Price cannot justify the taste. ",3,1749354616.0,CebuRestaurantReviews,0,1.0,False

A cafe surrounded by forests overlooking a picturesque garden that will leave you intoxicated with its breathtaking beauty. This hidden gem cafe  
is located in the gardens of the Nezu Museum in Omotesando, and  
is a relaxing space surrounded by greenery on all sides, designed by architect Kengo Kuma.  
The menu is extensive, and you can enjoy everything from lunch to cafes. This time, I ordered the Matcha Set, which is limited to 10 meals.  
In this luxurious space, I was able to enjoy matcha and seasonal sweets, and it was a relaxing time.  
  
Three things to note when visiting:  
① You need to purchase a ticket to the Nezu Museum (¥1,300)  
② There will be a line of more than 30 people at opening time  
③ It is recommended to purchase online in advance  
The line is divided into ticket purchasers and same-day purchasers, and priority is given to the purchaser line, so even if you line up before opening, there is a high chance that you will miss the first round.  
  
If you purchase in advance and go 15 minutes before opening, you can aim for the first round of the cafe!  
If you are interested, save it and go.

Pretty normal diner, nothing fancy.

I said, You don’t have to do that. Just the coffee is fine.

She kind of blinked, smiled tighter, and walked off. I figured that was the end of it.

Later in the meal, she’s clearly being weird with me. Overly formal, not checking in much. When I paid, I said, “Just so you know, I’m not trying to be rude. I just don’t like the fake part of this job and I respect people more when they’re real with me.”

She says nothing and walks away. Then the host stops me on the way out and says she was upset by how I spoke to her. I asked what exactly I said that was rude, and he said it was the tone.

I tipped 22% like always, didn’t raise my voice, and honestly just saved us both time and energy. I don’t think I’m the bad guy here. I’m not going to lie and pretend I care how someone’s day is going if I don’t know them.

Got to know about 50% off through District app. So decided to try Starbucks for first time in my life. 

Seating: seating area was lit with yellow spotlights. Comfy seats but a couple of small round coffee tables rather than full height table. 

Menu: Checked menu from District app itself. Had to Google to know what few options are😆Middle class mindset kicked in and chose cheapest cold coffee option 😬

Ordering experience: Didn’t try any English. Though I can write okay but I am not that fluent in English when it’s time to speak. 😞
Asked server in local language about food options. Finally ended up with 2 cold coffees and a chocolate truffle brownie. 

Here comes the underwhelming part. 
Self serve: We were seated on a floor above order counter. Didn’t hear my name for some time. Had to go downstairs to check. Chocolate truffle brownie was missing. Had to ask and get it. 

Taste: Coffee was too sweet for my liking without adding any additional sugar. Didn’t feel anything special. Slightly disappointed. ☹️ 

Has to leave immediately after coffee to free up table for awaiting people. 

Takeaways for me. I might not go again. I do fall under Indian mentality of getting served by someone than self serving if I am paying more. ",1,1749354212.0,indiasocial,0,1.0,False

I don’t fully know what to say, I’m awkward in social situations, and our lab is often full of people that makes it hard to talk to someone 1-on-1.

I wish I had the self-confidence to just ask, but I just don’t. I graduate in 2 months and after that I probably won’t even see him again (most likely), so I know at some point I just should do it.

The Devils in the Delta


The camp that day was too busy—too alive for the heat. Shouted orders echoed across the clearing, punctuated by the wet thumps of boots sinking into orange mud. The air hung thick and unmoving—like a well-fed snake, it slithered slow, unhurried. No breeze stirred the dark green leaves or the broad, swaying palms high above in the treeline. Even under stretched canvas, there was no relief.

Every surface gleamed with a slick sheen of damp. You could fight heat with water, sure—hydration was key. Water cooled the body, flushed the system. But this… this wasn’t heat alone. This was a stew of humidity, the kind found in a kitchen that never stops boiling lobsters, crabs, and corn. Imagine that—and you’re halfway there.

Foot care had been drilled into them back at boot camp, over and over. But no one mentioned how fatigues would rub and chafe in all the wrong places—how armpits would blaze raw, rashes bloom around your waist like angry halos. No one said you could get jungle rot on your balls—raw, weeping sores that stank like a week-dead fish abandoned on the riverbank.

But hey—as long as your feet were dry, as long as you had clean socks and could still walk straight on patrol, everything was peachy, right?

If it had been quiet, maybe you could’ve coped. Just lie still, soak up some rays. But no—the noise made it worse. Ammo boxes dropped like bricks. Grunts shouting over trenches, laughing, cussing, singing off-key to a radio that crackled more hiss than harmony.

Hueys whupped low over the sediment-heavy river, their rotors barely shifting the dense air. That same air was thick with layers of scent: the sweet-pungent tang of gasoline, smoke from woodfires, the acrid burn of overheated engines—and through it all, the underlying stink of the river: sewer-sweet, rotten.

On the makeshift wharf, thrown together by the engineer corps, sat Jackson.

The boys called him Birdie—on account of his whistling. At reveille, in the latrine, cleaning his rifle—it didn’t matter. He whistled like a songbird that hadn’t yet realized it was caged.

Now he sat as if behind a piano in some smoky, back-alley jazz club. Perched on a box of .50 cal rounds, back straight, head nodding to a rhythm only he could hear. Arms bent. Fingers moving swift and sure across an imaginary keyboard—just him and the crate, keeping time.

The radio crackled, hissed—and then, miraculously, cleared. A change in tune.
“Mack the Knife.”
Ella Fitzgerald’s voice slid through the static—smooth, warm, honeyed.

Jackson’s fingers stilled.
He drifted away…

---

Three days before his eighteenth birthday, Jackson stood at the crossroads.

It was the last day of May, heat rising from the land in slow, lazy waves—not yet unbearable in his home state of Louisiana. He stood at the heart of a four-way crossroads, seven or eight miles from his family’s farm. Close to midnight, he reckoned. A waning moon cast soft blue-white light over the scene, bathing the world in an eerie, ethereal glow.

Cotton fields stretched out on all sides, the earthy, musty scent of the crop thick in the night air. He wasn’t quite a man—not yet—but he aimed to become one real soon. The gravel crunched beneath his thick leather boots as he paced in a tight circle, nerves ticking through his limbs. One hand ran over his sweat-dampened scalp, across his tight, coarse black curls.

He’d heard his uncle talk about Robert Johnson when he was just a boy. The tale hadn’t scared him like it was meant to—it had stuck. Haunted him. Played over in his mind through long, hungry years. Because how else was he supposed to lift his daddy and momma out of the dirt?

His father, old before his time, hunched and weathered, hands thick with calluses from a life behind the plough and with little to show for it. His mother—oh, his poor momma—cooking and cleaning at the big house for folks still pretending the world hadn’t turned.

He stopped pacing. Looked down at his hands—slim, agile fingers.
""You got talent, boy!"" they’d said. Plenty of times. But talent wasn’t enough. Talent opened the door; luck decided if you got invited in.

With a heavy sigh, Jackson rubbed his sweaty palms down the legs of his rough wool trousers.
""I’m too old for fairy tales,"" he muttered.

He cast one last look down the three roads in front of him, about to turn back—when he heard it.

Footsteps on gravel behind him. Then a melodic whistle, lilting and slow.
It stopped him cold.

Spinning on his heel, a little puff of dust rising, Jackson’s wide eyes locked onto a stranger.

The man strolled toward him with lazy confidence, a black cane balanced across his shoulder. Though the night air was warm, a chill wrapped itself around Jackson's spine. His breath caught in his chest—his heart thumped like a brass drum being struck from the inside.

The stranger came to a halt a few feet away. He wore a tall hat—Jackson remembered hearing it called a stovepipe once—and stood a little taller, a little broader than Jackson himself. A long, knee-length coat hung off his shoulders, its dark cloth near-black beneath the moonlight. Beneath it, a cotton shirt lay open at the collar, a loose cravat drooping beneath his neck.

Lowering the cane, the man lifted his hat’s brim and offered a low, sweeping bow. His face, now free of shadow, tilted up—meeting Jackson’s gaze.

His eyes gleamed dark and deep, like coals dancing behind glass. Sharp cheekbones framed his face, a short curly beard lining a strong jaw. His smile was wide and easy, too perfect to be safe.
“Late for one so young, mon cher, to be out in these fields, yes?”

His voice rolled like thick molasses, sweet and smooth. Jackson said nothing.

“Ah… such shyness,” the man crooned, tilting his head, grin never faltering. “Come now, petit, tell us why you’re here, eh?”

The cane flicked up, then gently tapped Jackson’s shoulder. Not hard—but enough to stir him from the spell.

Jackson blinked, swallowed, managed to close his slack mouth. “I—I don’t…”

The stranger laughed—a rich, velvet sound—and began to circle Jackson with an odd, stalking gait, the way a predator tests a meal it doesn’t yet intend to eat.

“Not yet a man, no,” he said, voice almost purring. “But close, oui? I see why you came. You seek old Clooty, yes? Come, boy. Tell us what you want. Say it clear.”

Jackson saw it then—not with his eyes, but with the longing in his soul.

He saw crowded clubs, packed tight with people cheering, clapping, screaming to hear him play. He saw record deals, stacks of money, a suit that fit him like it was made from starlight. He saw his father in fine clothes, standing tall. His mother smiling like she hadn’t smiled in years.

A warm, dry whisper tickled his ear.
“Sign here, mon cher. I have the pen.

---

A sharp whistle snapped Jackson back to the present.

He was still perched on that munitions box, his fatigues soaked through—especially under the arms and across his back—dark with sweat and clinging like second skin.

“Yo! Birdie! C’mon, man—let’s hustle! We got eighty clicks of sewage and green hell ahead of us. Grab that brick your ass is on and get aboard!”

Jackson blinked. Rubbed the heat from his eyes. He snatched up the M16 propped beside him, then hefted the heavy .50 cal ammo box onto his shoulder. A quick nod—a soldier’s farewell—and he climbed aboard the olive-drab and jungle-camouflaged gunboat.

Let’s get some, he thought.

---

Night fell fast in the jungle. No lingering, romantic sunsets here—just light one minute, then darkness like a dropped curtain.

After an uneventful patrol upstream, Captain Chayson—Chay to the men—ordered the riverboat close to shore. A short while later, they slipped into an RPB, a makeshift rest post thrown together by the engineers just days ago. Sandbags, broken crates, and sheets of corrugated metal made up a crude dock. They tied up against another boat headed downriver, and Jackson was handed watch duty—alone with both crafts.

The rest of the crew had vanished just before dusk, laughing and ribbing him on their way out.
Old man Chayson had chewed him out earlier over something Jackson still swore wasn’t his fault.
“That was my lucky coffee mug, Bird. And you decided to throw it overboard?”
Those piercing steel-blue eyes of Chay’s had sparkled with mischief, sure—but the spit flying from his mouth and flecking his beard? That hadn’t matched the tone.
Jackson had protested. Last he saw, the mug had been on the map table, leaving brown rings on the charts.

At least Adams—solid, steady Adams with two tours already behind him—had slipped him a couple Lucky Strikes and a Hershey bar before leaving.

Jackson tipped his helmet back slightly and spat into the swirling black of the Mekong.

He lit a cigarette, letting the smoke fill his lungs. The orange-red tip flared, briefly casting a glow against his cheek. He held it in, then exhaled slowly into the thick, still air.

Sitting by Chayson’s wheel, he flicked the butt into the undergrowth. It sparked once against a wet stump—then the jungle swallowed it whole. All was quiet now. A few sounds had floated down earlier—some guys arguing over cards, no doubt—but the silence had settled back like a shroud.

Only the occasional creak from the tied ropes or the groan of the metal hull kept him company as the current rolled past.

Jackson leaned his head against the cool metal rail, eyes scanning the black water. The stillness crept into his bones.

“Shit!” he cursed, a little too loud.

Something with too many teeth had landed on his neck and bit deep. He slapped at it hard—but froze as he heard it—

A sound.

Not the jungle. Not water.

A laugh.

Wet. Slippery. Wrong.

It came from behind him.


---

Jackson snapped alert, M16 gripped tight, swinging toward the sound.

Crouched on a crate, lashed down in the corner of the boat, was a man-shaped silhouette. But darker. Too dark. It swallowed light.

What chilled Jackson’s blood wasn’t the figure—it was the smile. Shark-like. Wide. Gleaming teeth lit from within, as if they remembered hellfire.

“Ah, my little zanmi,” it purred, the voice slipping out, languid and thick. “Why youse make old Clooty come to this dirty, hot country, huh?”

Jackson’s throat bobbed as he swallowed. He clutched his rifle tighter—not like a weapon, but like a crucifix.

The smile vanished. The silhouette shifted.

A match flared. A furnace of light in a closed fist. Sulphur bit the air.

“You—you’re—what the hell are you doing here?” Jackson managed to rasp.

Old Clooty, a slim lit cheroot pinched between thin lips, took a long drag and exhaled. The smoke curled unnaturally—floating, coiling, like it knew something.

He lowered the cheroot to his knee, still crouched. The glow revealed eyes—glistening. Hungry.

Jackson stared.

The helmet was standard issue—cloth-covered M1—tilted rakishly. Tucked into the band were two black aces and two black eights. Spades and clubs. The dead man’s hand.

His fatigues were crisp. Clean. No sweat stains. The company patch on each shoulder grinned—a demon’s head, baring sharp teeth. Beneath it, upside-down sergeant stripes. Where U.S. Army should be: “Devils Own.”

“You have something of mine, mon chéri,” Clooty said, voice dry as old paper.

His smile returned. He tilted his head. “We have a contract still, yes?”

Jackson stood straighter, sweat slick on his brow. The rifle eased slightly from his chest, though still held firm. His voice came stronger than he felt.

“You promised me fame. Fortune. Ain’t got neither. You can go pound sand. I got nothing for you. Hear me? Nothing.”

Clooty tipped his head back and laughed.

It was like someone tuning a violin with broken strings.

He brought his blazing gaze down and said, calm as sin, “Boy... you came knockin’ on my door. You don’t like my encore, moun fou? Difisil. Tough luck.”

He took another drag, blew a smoke ring that twisted into a noose.

“You take my offer. Come back with me. Neon lounge, baby grand, ivory keys still wet from the last girl who played ’em. Coin. Sweet-tasting bel fanm just for you. Refuse—”

He spat on the deck.

Jackson glared, lip curled, heart pounding.

Then—snap.

A branch behind him.

“Psst… Hey, Jackson. Chay says I’m to relieve you. Go find a hole, man. Who the hell you talkin’ to anyway?”

It was Adams, stepping from the undergrowth.

Jackson turned back.

The crate was empty.

But the cigar smoke still curled in the air. And it smelled like brimstone.

---

They passed a village the next day. Women washing clothes got doused with spray as the gunboat surged by. Some were knocked into the river. The crew—Chayson included—roared with laughter.

“C’mon, guys. Not funny,” Adams muttered, but his voice held no force.

Jackson said nothing, but his eyes lingered on the struggling women. He shook his head.

They were getting close to Firebase Endzone.

Or as the men called it: Devil’s Armpit.

The river narrowed, green choking in tighter, like a throat. Jackson leaned back near the wheelhouse. His skin prickled.

No birds. No monkeys. Nothing.

“Stand ready,” Chayson barked.

The banks rose. The boat felt smaller. Smothered.

Ahead, shadows moved. Black shapes in the foliage. Ducking down.

Crack!

Orange blooms lit the trees. Splinters of paint flew from the hull. Screams.

One sharp. One low and awful.

“Adams!” Jackson shouted, even as his finger squeezed the trigger.

Gunpowder stung his eyes. He smelled hot brass, oil, sweat.

The boat surged forward as Chayson gunned the engine, bow lifting. But it felt slow—like wading through glue.

Jackson’s rifle thumped against his shoulder. The jungle shredded with every shot.

Then—

Clunk.

His weapon jammed.

“Fucking thing—!”

A metal clink drew his gaze. Inches away, a spent bullet was caught mid-fall, hovering like time had hiccupped. It dropped with a soft clang.

In his ear, a whisper:
“Pa jodia, zanmi’m.”

Not today, my friend.

A screaming rocket. A curse. Then Chayson collapsed, groaning.

The boat lurched.

Jackson ran. Skidded. Boots sloshed through thick blood. He hit the wheel, grabbed the throttle. Looked up.

There—through parted leaves—was a figure.

Black pyjamas.

RPG-7 braced on their shoulder.

Jackson spun the wheel. Slammed the throttle. The boat twisted hard.

He aimed the prow straight at the rocketeer, staring into his dark eyes.

The engine howled. Metal screamed.

FWUMP.

The rocket launched in fire and smoke.

Jackson jerked the wheel.

The boat listed, corrected.

Too late.

The grenade screamed toward him.

“Timoun Bata!”
(Devil’s Child!)

A voice—not his.

Then—

Flame. Heat. White light.

---

A few days later...

The two-star general arrived. Clean uniform. TV cameras in tow. He smiled wide. Practiced. Hollow.

Jackson stood at attention.

The man took his hand, soft and scented with cologne.

“Here’s your tin star, son,” he said for the cameras.

Jackson forced a smile.

The man turned, laughing, not waiting for a reply.

Behind Jackson, a nearby radio crackled to life. Clear. No static.

> “The Devil went down to Mekong,
Tryin’ to honor a deal,
He was in a bind, runnin’ outta time,
And lookin’ for a soul to steal.

He found a boy on a riverboat,
With fingers born to play,
But the kid went to war, tried to settle the score,
And the Devil don’t like to wait.”

 “‘You play real sweet, son,’ he said,
‘But you’re runnin’ outta track—
I got time, and blood, and the long way back.
And you? You owe me that.’”

Jackson turned around.
Picked up the battered case.
Drew back his arm...

...and threw the damn thing in the river.

Epilogue:

The stars hung low over Firebase Endzone, heavy and watching.

Jackson sat alone on a sandbag wall, boots untied, rifle across his lap like a sleeping child. The ribboned medal weighed awkwardly on his chest, a tin lie he hadn’t yet found the courage to take off.

In his hand, a match flared. He didn’t remember striking it.

The scent—sulphur and tobacco—wasn’t his.

From the shadows, a whisper:

“Next time, mon ti zanmi… we play for keeps.”

A breeze stirred the heatless air.

The match died.

CREEPYPASTAS: JEFF THE KILLER
Night, very night...
The wind whistled in this new house, New future?, perhaps, but the echo of the mockery, the resounding of the blows on Jeff's flesh... it is not forgotten so easily.
The house, typical and boring, almost like everything in his life, neither too big nor too small, just...regular.
-Mom, where am I going to stay?
-Shut up, Liu... mom is not here for your little games now.
- Jeff! Could you help me unload some things?
- Yes!, I'm coming...
Walk to the car, take boxes and repeat, some with glasses, others with Liu's toys, and others...
- Why do I have to bring Liu's toys too?!
- Come on Jeff! Can't you do that favor for your little brother?
-Well, since…
More and more Liu toys, some dinosaurs, others bears...
Jeff walked up the stairs, staggering from side to side, his gaze half-focused on the box he had to carry…
Until he arrived at Liu's supposed new room, spacious, yellow with red spheres, a fan with a warm light that was perfect in a way.
- Why did Liu get this room? tsk... he always has to be Liu's darling, sometimes I like it—
A shadow, small, fast and euphoric, suddenly rose...
- Jeff! You didn't mistreat my toys, did you?!
-No, they weren't even a big deal...
- Ohh! Have you seen how big my room is?! It's beautiful!
- And it surprises you? You always get the best, everything... and me, what?!
- Jeff! Well, erm... you... They gave you that white sweatshirt! Isn't it pretty? eh?!
-Yes, yes...very pretty, Wait! What is that?!
- That?!
-My finger, hahaha!
-It's not funny...but... But hey! You're smiling! That's a miracle for me.
-Well, of course, your smile hurts my eyes...
- Well, you sleep more! Have you seen the raccoon circles under your eyes?!...besides, smiling is not bad...you should smile more...
-It's not so easy to smile when you don't have to...
And Jeff was right, divorced parents, bullying, and emotional detachment, the perfect recipe for sadists...
Every step Jeff took throughout the house echoed, a voice responding to everything, observing, judging...
Until finally good Jeff took his box, his things, his life... and repeated, carrying, carrying and throwing away his things in his new room...
It was small, the walls white as a dove, the bed red as blood, and a window that overlooked the empty backyard, the moon was at its point, like a beautiful fruit about to fall from the tree, in the room, there was no longer an echo...only...Jeff.
- How “charming”!, tsk...Does everything of mine have to be so...somber?...
He lay down on his bed, the warm and suffocating embrace of the sheets on his body, the slight crackling of the branches on the window... the door to Jeff's room half open, illuminating his entire body, except... his head.
It was clear, the darkness loves Jeff, but… What is the difference between love and possession?
- What will this new school be like? I guess...better than the previous one, Woodsprings...I remember you, you bastards...
Woodsprings? One usually finds the truth on the path to oblivion...
- W-Because I never defended myself? I'm not that weak, right?
But the cruelest memories in life are like scars, marks on your skin that reflect victories... or shame, but... How long will you avoid them?
-Tsk... Why did I never defend myself?!, Why did I never say anything?!...but I didn't want to look like a coward, right?...I still remember his damn insults...
Until the memories decide to come out, and attack mercilessly, as many beings do, but they... they don't hit you, they don't insult you, no... they lock you in your own mind:
- Hey, Woods! Where do you think you're going, sissy?!
-Stop bothering me, Toby…
- What?! I didn't hear you, Jeffar!
-A push to Jeff, the monster had arrived, the…Tobias Archer, Randall Collins, and the others…names marked with blood on Jeff's back, behind his head, behind his mind-
-Don't bother me...
- Ha! And what are you going to do to avoid it? Eh? Will you call Jessica to come change your diaper?
-Not with Jessica...because I swear that—
- What? Daddy's abandoned bastard... say it, come on... defend your girlfriend, come on...
-I-I…I---
POW!
-The monster attacked, Jeff's blood gushing from his lips, his gaze darkening like the night, the force throwing him, rigid... like a tree being cut down, Jeff's life, repetitions...tortures-
-I don't like to wait, Jeffy, listen... I have a proposal for you, how about you come to a party at my house, eh?... there you can say “I” as much as you want, and that way we'll save the clown...
- Huh? Did you just hit me? And you told me in a bad way—
-The monster grabbed Jeff by the collar of his shirt, his eyes disgusting, like a hellish pit, or at least...that's how it was for Jeff; his breath of fire on Jeff's face, his pulse racing... like a war drum-
-I already told you, Jeff... you will go to my house, and show that you are worth something... at least a penny, and if you manage to impress me... I promise to stop bothering you, for a while... Hehehe... you know what you will do, Jeffy... don't look bad on me...
-But I...
-The Red House, 234 Woodsprings, Jeffy...at seven at night, alone...you know what to do, Jeff...also, take this as a favor...Jessica will also be at my party, don't tell me you don't like her...
- I don't-
- Well, I don't give a damn! You'll go to my party tonight and give me a good show! Otherwise you want things to go worse... Understood?
-Yeah…
-Understood?!
-Y-Yes!
-That's what I like to hear, and hey...if you're going to go, take off those rags, damn misfit...
….
The monster was gone, and with it, the memory of Jeff...he returned to his room, emerged from the prison of memory, sweat falling from his forehead, his breathing heavy, his chest rising...again...and again.
-Jeff…
The voice was there, Jeff was just...there, but Jeff couldn't move, his eyes were still on the party, on the mistake, on October 13th...
-Jeff…
What he did that night, what he lost and what he gained...
-Jeff!
He didn't shut up, Jeff's chest became more tense, choked... like a rope that—
-JEFF!
- AAAAH!
-Wow, until you wake up, lazy... And why that face?!, It seems like you saw a ghost!, Come on!, Or I'll eat your dinner!
It was Liu, the monsters decided to free Jeff for a while, he slowly got up, his eyes... red like his bed, irritated by his own sweat, as if he couldn't blink...
- Ah... what?! You seriously called me for that! Screw you, Liu!
-Wow, it seems that the “sleeping beauty” woke up in a bad mood…well, whatever, he's coming down!
- Pff! Not now, Liu!
- Come on, Jeff! Or else... I'll tell mom that you said the “J” word to me!
- The word with…?, tsk…
- Come on! Or do you want to see mom angry?!
-Tsk… okay, you win, Liu…
- As always, Ha!
-Heh...yeah, like...as always...
The ink blood of Jeff's heart, Liu...was his coffee, bitter but loved, the only reason why he didn't...
But you can't write a story with ink alone, you also need desire, decision...and Jeff...didn't have it...they went down the stairs laughing, as a small relief from the rope around Jeff's neck...
- And what do I prepare mom?, eh?
- Prepare?!, Pff!, Don't you know how lazy mom is?!, She ordered pizza, Jeff!
- I did hear you, Liu!...
-Oh, sorry, mom...
-Wow...finally something good in this place...tsk...at least some cheese doesn't hurt me...
Pizza, something so mundane in our lives, was the murderer that widowed Jeff, and killed her husband...out of remorse...
The cheese, shiny, spongy, soft... a caress to Jeff's soul, a reflection of his own face, its ghostly color... the pepperoni, spicy, warm and round meat, a vicious circle of temporary pleasure for Jeff, the bread and the edges... eh... Who likes that...?
He sat at the table, good Jeff could sit and eat like us, on one side was Liu, and in front…”The jailer”, his mother…
Margaret Woods, common woman who knows very little...mother of Jeff and Liu...
-And have you arranged your rooms, children?
-Me now!, my toys, my paints, crayons, and—
- Shut up, Liu! tsk...
-Hey Jeff, why are you so rude to your brother, huh?
- Yes, Jeff! Tell us!
- Rude me?!, that kid is just...useless, why doesn't he look like me?!
- Jeffrey!
- What?!, Am I lying?!, always with bad grades, breaking things like an idiot...
- Jeff! Are you listening to yourself?! Your brother is younger than you, don't ask too much of him...
- But of course! You did ask me for whatever you wanted! Right?!
- Hey, mom, I...
- Shut up, Liu! This is all your fault! Why can't you stop bothering me, huh?! You and Margaret keep interfering in mine!
- Jeff! Calm down now! Margaret?!, Why do you call me that?!, I'm your mother!
- Mother?! Ha! And why weren't you there for me when I needed you?! If your mouth is so full saying that you are my mother... say it.
- Have I not been there for you?!, Did I not attend your school plays?!, Did I not break my neck to buy us this house?!, Are you missing food, clothes, books?!
- Yes! Why didn't you defend me from him?!

- Whose?!
- FROM DAD!

- D-Dad?...

- I'm leaving!

- Jeff!...

Oh, the violinist was mentioned, curious, the divorce was born due to infidelity, is there something else?!...Jeff ran up the stairs, Liu just watched, but the mother...started hunting Jeff, the jailer wanted to put him back in prison...

- Jeff, come here!

- N-No!

The hunt continued, a few tears spilling from Jeff's eyes, little drops of the storm in Jeff's mind, until finally...

VBRRR! CRAAASH!!

Jeff went alone into his prison, his jail, his room... slamming the door hard, before the jailer began the interrogation...

- Jeff! Let me in, let's talk!

- NO!, you never helped me, you never... You never defended me from them!, from HIM!!

THUMP! ...THUMP!

The door would not hold out anymore, the jailer would enter...

-HEH—

Hhngh…hh-ah…Ahhh-MAMA!

-Liu!...

Liu's scream attracted the jailer, and she went to his aid... Why didn't she do the same with Jeff? Interesting... maybe it's because I never scream, I never speak...
The echo of Liu's cries crept into Jeff's room, the noise became more intense, louder... even the noise drowned Jeff, he just stayed on the floor, shrinking like a child... because that's what he was...

-Damn...snff...No!... Why?!, Why...ME?!!

But the noise didn't stop, nobody and nothing let Jeff free, and if they do... it's just to excite him.
Jeff covered his ears, but the noise continued... his tears flowed like a river of blood, the storm... broke loose...

--October 13, 2000... The Red House, 234 Woodsprings...6:30 PM—

It was a particular night…after the incident, so to speak; with Tobias, Jeff had to go to his house...or else...
Jeff had to get permission, his grades are good, nothing special, nothing minor, just...average.
I entered his house, the old house in Woodsprings... pictures of smiling clowns, others sad... the armchairs, rough and beige, as if they couldn't decide what color to use... or rather, time was erasing their color...
Family photos, Jeff, Margaret, Liu…and the…
The house had green tapestries... a withered and desolate green...

- Mom, I'm here!

- Wow, until you arrive...Did you see what time it is?! I almost called the police!

-Yes, uh...well, what—

- Nothing, young man! Now you will explain to me what the hell you were doing, Hey!

Jeff couldn't say it, what would they say about him?! Furthermore, one of his chains is the most invisible... and heaviest... shame.

- Hey, I...

-I'm waiting, Jeff...

- Eh...I was in the library, I-I was studying something about mathematics, eh...

- Hmm? And what is the difference between arithmetic and algebra?!

- Ah!, eh...it's...tsk...

- Are you already thinking of talking, young man?! Otherwise... straight to your room and without video games for a month...

- Eh...and-I...
- That?!

- I was drawing in the park!, Ok?!

- Draw…

- Yes, I—

- Hahaha!, So you draw, Jeff?, Miracle!, and...What do you draw...?

- Glup…

Oh no, now he'll have to show her all his drawings...of her.
The time after school is boring, very boring...Jeff just walks through the park, until he reaches a bench in front of the lake, and draws whatever comes to mind, he draws trees, squares, smiles, Jessica...
An acquaintance from school, a light, a platonic and hormonal desire, natural among young people...

-Well?

-Eh...and-I...ehm...trees, birds...

- Hmm?! So Jeff, Jeff Woods draws trees and birds, right?

Margaret grabbed Jeff's backpack with force, some books and pencils fell, but also…Jeff's drawings.
Drawings of trees in a lake, the portraits of the monster, but above all… the largest and most detailed… The angel.

-Well, these don't look like birds to me, Jeff...hmm, they're quite strange, even for you, what books have you been reading, huh?

- Eh...some d-of Lovecraft, Heh...but that's not the point...

- Isn't that the point? Now what are you up to, Jeff?

-I wanted to ask your permission to—

- If it involves a lot of money or another book, don't even dream about it!

- It's not that…

- So?
- W-I want to ask your permission to go to a party...it's at seven, at Tobias's house, the Archers' son...

- A party...

- Yes!, But there will be no alcohol, or anything bad!, Plus it's close here, like there are two streets!, Please f—

- Yes! Of course, Jeff! You really surprise me today, huh! Until you finally socialize!

It seems that the permit was not that difficult to get, but... now it was time to go...
To the red house.

Jeff dressed appropriately, not to mention that he only wore a medium-sized suit, and left, his mother still saw him from the porch of the house, but there was no turning back...
I walk a little, then a lot... until I reach the red house...
Loud noises, some young people outside drinking special refreshments (beer, obviously), and inside, some technological noises and shouting.
Jeff passed among those people, uncomfortable, like a dragonfly flying over a spider's web, inside the house, there were some children playing some consoles, the video game, irrelevant... others chatting calmly, and among them all... like a firefly crossing the night, there was her...
For Jeff, everything had disappeared, only him and her remained, her hair as bright as the moon, a moon among the darkness, he approached very slowly, he was about to—

- If you came, raccoon! Ha! I thought you would chicken out!

- Uh…hello, Toby…

To talk to him, to make what he had always dreamed of come true...but the monster didn't want to see corny things, no...he wanted to see...Blood!

- Guys! The new one has arrived! Let's receive it!

All eyes were focused on him... in the darkness, now there were eyes, eyes that scratched and tore at Jeff, like an internal hemorrhage... and little by little... it came out of his body with a peculiar shape... his cheeks bathed in blood, the classic and cruel... shame.

The angel also joined in the stares, she no longer looked like an angel, she...started to laugh, her face burned, turned red...she even made fun of Jeff, and Jeff understood...that you can't trust anyone, not even angels, or should I say...demons.

-Come on, Jeffy... don't be shy, give us a good sh—

CRACK!

A soft blow on Tobias's face, Jeff released his ink, his small hatred became a hurricane, natural or not, it no longer mattered... if our ""knight"" decided to attack the dragon, he must be ready to burn in combat...

- Why don't you shut up, idiot?!

- What's wrong with you, idiot?!

THUMP!

The monster attacked too, Jeff's cheeks turning redder and redder... in the darkness, the eyes grew bigger, and from the sides, a circle of manic mouths screamed in an infernal chorus:

- “Fight, fight, fight…”-

THUMP! ZAZZZZ! 

- Who do you think you are?!

- Can't you close your mouth?!

The fight between the monster and Jeff continued, it was natural…. If it is “natural” to hit each other like animals…
The noise increased in Jeff's ears, the chorus, the eyes, the monster... everything about him, a weight...

- That's enough!!

- Look!...

The fight stops, the monster stops...For what...?

- The raccoon comes to MY house! And he hits me?! Hahaha! And now... he wants to stop?!

- Me too…

THUMP—TRACK-POW!

It was just a monster trap...
Jeff fell to the ground, shame welling up in his nose, his fall…

CRACK!

It resonated throughout the room, for a moment, everything was silent...the vast darkness was the only one that stayed with Jeff...but...

- “Hahaha… Raccoon!, Raccoon!, Raccoon!…”-

Now, the darkness was gone...replaced by a great sea of ​​red and white, a lip and an eye that mocked Jeff.

- Now! Please!

- Hey, friends, hehehe... What do raccoons eat...?

- “Garbage, Garbage, Garbage…” –

- How about we feed our Jeffy?!

Two shadows grabbed Jeff, immobilizing him...the laughter increased, red smiles, a blood red in Jeff's sea of ​​misery...the monster grabbed a trash can...

- Open wide, Jeff!

The shadows opened Jeff's mouth, put the garbage in... Tch... Tch... TCH! ...the crunch of filth in Jeff's mouth, his tears combining with his ""food"", the monster was satisfied...

- That?! He did eat it, hahaha!

- “Are you that hungry, Jeff? You poor thing”… “Hey, garbage eater, why don't you come to my house one day?! I need to leave my house sparkling!” … –

Jeff…silence…silence…yes—

- People! Let's take out the trash!
- “YES, Let's get her out!, Let's get her out!” –

All the shadows began to pick up Jeff, took him to the door, and threw him out onto the street, l-like garbage...

- Good show, Jeff!, See you Monday at school, Jeffy!, Hahaha! …

THUMP-TRACK-

And the door closed...

- W-Why w-what...b-but... They can't do this to me!

THUMP! THUMP! THUMP!

Why does the hero want to return to the abyss? … Revenge, anger… pain?

-P-please…open me…

But there was no response, just…laughter.

Tsk… 

Jeff walked back home, at the door...there was Him...the violinist, his violin and his bow, it was HE, the father...his rod and his belt...and the melody...Jeff's screams as he was whipped...but...even though he felt every blow, every drop of clotted blood...he only saw his mother, screaming at his father to stop, but he did nothing...just noise...

……………………………………………………………………………………………………………………………

And we return to the room, to reality... Liu's, Margaret's screams, but Jeff was still on the floor of the room... the darkness, even the moon was drowned out...

- Die, damn you!, DIE!

He started hitting his bed, why? …There has to be a why?!

- By-

THUMP!

--WH—

THUMP!

 ## Key Features Analysis

The best country home decor pieces are more than just aesthetically pleasing; they're functional, durable, and reflect a commitment to quality craftsmanship.

**Natural Wood Finishes:** The cornerstone of country decor is undoubtedly natural wood. Look for pieces with distressed finishes, exposed grain, and minimal staining to highlight the wood's inherent beauty. This could include reclaimed barn wood for accent walls, solid oak dining tables, or pine dressers with hand-rubbed oil finishes. The emphasis is on showcasing the natural imperfections and textures of the wood, adding character and warmth to the space.

**Textured Fabrics:** Country decor is all about creating a comfortable and inviting atmosphere, and textured fabrics play a crucial role. Think chunky knit throws, linen curtains, burlap accents, and quilted bedding. These fabrics add depth and visual interest to a room, making it feel cozy and lived-in. Consider incorporating patterns like plaids, florals, and ticking stripes for a touch of classic country charm.

**Handcrafted Details:** Embrace the beauty of imperfections with handcrafted details. This could include pottery made by local artisans, hand-stitched quilts, woven baskets, or wrought iron accents. These unique pieces add a personal touch to your home and showcase the artistry of skilled craftspeople. Look for items with slight variations in color, shape, or texture, as these imperfections add to their charm and character.

**Earthy Color Palettes:** Country decor typically features a warm and inviting color palette inspired by nature. Think soft neutrals like creams, beiges, and grays, accented with earthy tones like greens, browns, and blues. These colors create a calming and relaxing atmosphere, perfect for unwinding after a long day. Consider incorporating pops of color with floral arrangements, throw pillows, or artwork featuring natural landscapes.

**Vintage and Antique Accents:** Adding vintage and antique accents is a great way to infuse your home with character and history. Look for pieces like antique clocks, vintage mirrors, reclaimed signs, or antique furniture. These items add a sense of nostalgia and create a unique and personalized space. Don't be afraid to mix and match different styles and eras to create an eclectic and interesting look.

**Functional Storage Solutions:** Country homes often prioritize functionality and practicality, and storage solutions are no exception. Look for pieces like woven baskets, wooden crates, and farmhouse-style cabinets to keep your belongings organized and out of sight. These storage solutions not only add to the aesthetic of your home but also help to create a clutter-free and relaxing environment.

Alright, friends, let’s dive deep into a thought-provoking question that can change the game for productivity! Imagine waking up tomorrow, and *poof*—one of your daily tasks is magically automated. What would it be? 

For real, if your morning coffee could brew itself while you keep dreaming about conquering the day, wouldn’t that be something? ☕💤 

Here’s my take—if I could automate anything, it would be the whole *“What’s for dinner?”* dilemma. Seriously, how many times have you stared blankly into your fridge, contemplating life’s biggest question (and probably consuming more snacks than actual meals in the process)? 🍕🥡

Let’s break it down a bit. Here’s why automating daily tasks can be monumental:

- **Time Savers**: Reducing decision fatigue is huge. Less time deciding means more time doing! For me, planning meals ahead or using a meal prep service could save hours! 
- **Reduced Stress**: Stress can be a productivity killer. Automating mundane tasks helps keep our brains focused on what truly matters. Like mastering that next work project instead of debating spaghetti vs. tacos for dinner.
- **Increased Productivity**: Think about it: what could you achieve with all that extra time? More hobbies? Chill time? Or perhaps finally diving into that side hustle? 

Now, let’s sprinkle in some humor. Ever been in a mad dash to make your bed before that one friend drops by? Or searching for your keys while doing a mini workout? 🤦‍♂️ If only we could program our lives like a really good app! 

Those daily grind tasks can suck the life out of us pretty quickly. So, consider these options for automation (that might make you chuckle):

1. **Email Filtering** - Make your inbox work for you, not against you. Automatic sorting means no more sifting through *“important”* sale alerts for shoes you already own.
  
2. **Habit Tracking with Reminders** - Automatic nudges for hydration, exercise, or that 10-minute meditation you keep forgetting. It’s like having a personal cheerleader, but without the pom-poms!
  
3. **Calendar Scheduling** - Let’s spice up that calendar by automating your appointments. Going beyond the usual Zoom meeting, it could handle setting aside time for those precious moments of creativity or self-care. 

So, if you could automate just ONE task for peak performance, what would your dream task be? Would it be something fun or something essential? Who knows, maybe just getting your workout gear laid out at a specific time could make all the difference.

When I visited Lofoten in  Norway I stayed in a fisherman’s cabin on a fjord. Which of course had been nicely redone for tourists, so was quite comfortable. It was amazing being on the fjord. I’m wondering if there’s a similar island experience easily reachable from Stockholm (I’m not expecting fjords, haha.)

* **How**:
   * **Waxholmsbolaget ferries** (use SL card for many)

I play in an emo band as well and it's very easy to book shows with 3-4 bands where everybody plays 30-45 minutes or so of all original music. I'd like to be able to do the same type of shows with this more low key style, but it doesn't seem to be as supported as other styles.

Chapter 1: Masks  
  


Hot summer in 1974, mid morning sun beat down on a mid-western highway, it was the kind of weather that makes people consider cracking an egg on a sidewalk to see if it fries. A man wearing a military dress uniform walked along a desolate road. He was in his mid forties, wearing tan pants and a green jacket, matching hat and dark aviator sunglasses and carrying a dark brown leather attache case. The rank insignias show he is a Lieutenant Colonel, his name tag reads “Flagg”. Farmers' fields of corn and wheat  stretching out in the distance to the left and to the right, behind him in the distance was an army jeep, hood up with a soldier standing next to it as steam billowed out of the engine and radiator fluid poured out from below.  The walking soldier was headed towards a sign that says “Welcome to Springfield”, he was whispering under his breath *must stop McCullen*. 

Lt. Colonel Flagg eventually found a used car dealership, Kessler Automotive, and walked into the dealership office. 

“Good Afternoon” boomed the salesperson, springing forth from his desk, hand extended for a shake. He was wearing a royal blue suit jacket, matching undershirt and pants, black tie and red handkerchief in his suit pocket. His angular face wore an infectious grin, but the poor lad had a large red birthmark on his forehead, it looked slightly like a heart but not joined correctly. He had long dark brown hair in a ponytail, causing Flagg a slight sense of alarm.

“Good Afternoon young man,” Flagg says, shaking the man's hand. “Lieutenant Colonel Flagg” Flagg smiled before noticing an odd birthmark on the man’s forehead, one that looked kind of like a Cobra, hood flared.

“I’m Sam, owner, operator, for Kessler Automotive, how can I help you?” the Salesperson asked

“Well Sam, I don’t suppose you have a repair shop and a tow truck here? I have an army jeep with a blown radiator about a mile and a half back. Also, if it's possible, I need to borrow a car for a meeting across town” the Colonel replied, sitting his attache case down. 

“Well, Kessler’s a family company, and we insist on treating everyone who comes though our door like family. This company was built by my wife’s grandfather, expanded by his son, my father in law, and now run by me. Here’s what I’d like to do for you and your great service to our nation.I’m guessing you’re meeting with Arbco? They’re the only business around these parts big enough for military interest. My mechanic called out sick today, and even if we have the parts it’s going to take longer than that to change out a radiator. I’ll have your jeep towed in but earliest repair will be tomorrow at best, you’re gonna need to spend the night in Springfield,”

“Yes, I’m meeting with Arbco; it's an important meeting that I don’t want to be late to,” replied Flagg, glancing at his wristwatch. 

“Well, I can’t just hand you the keys, but I’d be happy to drive you there and then get you to the hotel,” said Sam. 

“That would be great young man, you’d be doing your nation a favor” said Flagg, feeling the eyes of the other players of this game upon him. He had no doubt that McCullen already had feet on the ground here, probably that damned Baroness up to her spy games, but Sam here? Sam was as American as apple pie. *There’s no way they could have gotten to this bumpkin,* he thought. 

Sam didn’t mention to Flagg that he knew Flagg was coming, or that he knew about the meeting. He didn’t mention the mysterious woman who had paid him $1000 to make sure the mechanic couldn’t fix the car today, or that she gave him another $1000 to chauffeur Flagg, and another $1000 to attach a quarter sized circuit board that looked like a leather patch to Flagg’s attache case. 



Chapter 2: Five months earlier

Sam woke to the sound of a door knock, it was 2 A.M. He walked downstairs from his bedroom, pausing to pick up a baseball bat before unlocking the door and opening it. He saw a man in uniform and put down the bat. “Sir? I’m officer Lavigne with the Highway Patrol, we need you to come with us to possibly identify a body.”

One and a half hours later Sam sat on a couch at the morgue, crying. His older brother, Dan, was dead. It was an auto accident. Accident. The fuck it was an accident. Sam knew better. His brother was a perfect driver. He didn’t care that the police claimed they found a bottle of whiskey mostly empty in the passenger side seat of the car. This was an assassination. 

His brother had been a very vocal critic of the Vietnam War, a war that Dan had served multiple tours in. The Government didn’t care about what the hippies said but to hear a soldier complain about the horrors that the U.S. was inflicting on a nation halfway around the world was more than they’d tolerate.  They admitted that there was another car involved and that the other car was the “family of a Ranger”. This was code, Sam knew the only family for a Ranger was other rangers, and they had caused the accident, staging it to discredit his big brother. Sam vowed revenge that day on the U.S. military, the U.S. Government, the entire American way of life would know Sam’s wrath one day, but how? Sam was no athlete like his brother, he was just a smooth talker that won multiple local championships in chess and statewide debate championships, Sam was a nerd.

Sam could not focus on work anymore, sales were suffering, the Kessler household was in danger of losing their two story colonial along with the dealership. Two months after Dan’s death, Sam’s wife left him, taking their son with her. She left a note but Sam didn’t bother to read it, no point. “Better off without her” was his only response. He began drinking almost as heavily as his brother had until the money ran low. He tried therapy but found it focused on the wrong enemy, focusing not on the Military but on his own past. He tried religion, finding nothing but platitudes and condescension in the Beatitudes and Corinthians.He started reading home printed newsletters detailing other atrocities and dark dealings of the U.S. military. Cover ups of their soldiers silencing the innocent were everywhere, Dan was intended to be just another “lost cause” but Sam demanded justice; Sam demanded truth.

Chapter 3: Scheming Shadows

Late one night Sam was at the only bar in town that would still take his business when a beautiful dark haired woman walked in. She wore dark sunglasses at night, an all black bodysuit and high heels with red bottoms. She walked directly to his table, smiled and introduced herself as Beatrice. She had an accent, something Eastern European, maybe German. “Samuel, I know what happened to your brother. I’ve heard about your research on the ranger and I can help you, if you can do me one small favor.”

The dark haired mysterious Beatrice explained that she was “an agent” for a private corporation tracking the misdeeds of the current U.S. government and bringing about lawsuits where possible. She even had a business card from the company, Extensive Enterprises, proving her legitimacy.  She believed that Arbco would soon be involved in an attempt to sabotage an investment by a foreign industrialist that wanted to help bring manufacturing to a small rural town not too far from Springfield. Samuel’s job would be simple, be a chauffeur, slip a small electronic listening device onto the attache of the colonel, and take a tour of Arbco if offered. She would arrange a refinance of both his home mortgage and dealership’s lease on very generous terms with a personal loan for Samuel as well. She left after twenty minutes of discussion and Sam found an envelope on his doorstep with both mortgages ready for his signatures, as well as $20000 in cash for his personal expenses and another $3000 for the proposed operation, sitting on his doorstep the next day. 

It goes without saying that this deal seemed too good to be true, and as a wise businessman Samuel was very hesitant to sign anything without reading the fine print, so it was several weeks of heavy thought and thorough contract reading before Sam called Beatrice to agree to the deal. He faxed the paperwork back to her and waited for this Colonel to show up one day. Time went by, sales were slow but Sam was back at the dealership. Two days before the Colonel showed up at Sam’s door he received a call at 3 A.M. Sam feared that he was about to relive the nightmare of his brother's passing. He answered the phone, it was Beatrice

“Sam, it's B, the Colonel stops by tomorrow, are you ready?” she said

“Understood, I’ll handle this, I’ll call my mechanic first thing, I assume you have everything ready with the General's car?” he asked,

“He’s a Colonel, and yes”, she said, before disconnecting

Sam didn’t sleep for the rest of the night, he knew that after tomorrow he would be a very different man for the rest of his days. He might end up in jail for espionage if things went badly. He could get shot and killed, condemning the Kessler family name to the list of national traitors. All he wanted was revenge for what was done to his family. It was the military's fault that his brother died. Their fault that his wife and son were gone, their fault that Sam had to take this deal with a conglomerate like Extensive Enterprises, their fault he was having to betray this nation. What was this Nation anyway? Founded by religious extremists that were chased out of their home nation, driven by greed and the need for power, it was nothing that Sam wanted to be a part of, it was something that needed to be rebuilt from the ground up by someone with vision, someone who could make it a better nation where truth and justice were the entirety of the American Values.

The next morning, Sam showered and shaved, put on a clean suit, a new one he’d never worn before, called his mechanic and told him not to come into work today. The man did not believe Sam, and accused him of stealing money from his paycheck. He had to stop by the man’s home and hand over the $1000 “bonus” before the man would accept that he wasn’t being fired. Sam headed to the dealership and opened up for business, which meant unlocking the front door, turning on the office lights and brewing coffee. While the coffee brewed Sam inspected the cars on hand for filth or overnight damage, nothing to see, all twenty-seven cars, five pickup trucks, three vans and two motorcycles accounted for. Sam waited in the office, He waited in the dealership parking lot, he waited at his desk, he waited at the coffee machine and back at his desk, no customers, and then finally the Colonel arrived. Sam smiled and eagerly greeted the man, viewing him not as a customer or a war hero, but the key to a door named Justice.   

Chapter 3: The Execution

Samuel grabbed the keys to a dodge that was fully fueled and ready to go. He held the passenger door open for Flagg, “Let me put your briefcase in the back sir” taking Flagg’s attache case, walking behind the car while holding the case with two hands, one on the handle and one on the bottom, before placing it in the back seat, where the Colonel could keep an eye on it. Beatrice had said he would need to hold it in place for 15 seconds to get the glue to warm from his body heat and adhere seamlessly to the attache case, Sam’s slow walk around the car provided just enough time for the patch to adhere properly. Sam drove the Colonel to the opposite end of Springfield, which, including admittance through the secured gate and park, was a 20 minute drive. Arbco’s building was designed with Brutalist architecture in mind, solid grey industrial concrete with severe angles, Springfield generally considered the office and matching factory next door to be an eyesore. Sam carried the attache in for the Colonel to the top floor before handing it over to the soldier. Flagg met a group of executives and was ushered into a conference room, the door shut. Sam was offered a behind the scenes tour of Arbco’s research and design department. 

Now, Arbco was primarily a logistics and transportation company, its name stood for Advanced Routing Benefit Collective Operation, and was founded by a group of professional truck drivers, railroad men, and barge owners to improve synchronized shipments of goods across the world. The R&D’s primary focus was on improving mechanical performance for the various machines that hauled commerce throughout the world, but the C.E.O had within the last five years created a skincare line, mostly at the insistence of his vain wife. On the tour one of the chemists noticed Sam’s birthmark, and decided to take a chance. They had developed an extract from a himalayan mushroom recently discovered that natives report gave the skin eternal youth. The exact translation was that it gave “the eternity of the serpent” but eternity was the word the translator focused on. The chemist, a Doctor Monev, had mixed the extract into a basic hand lotion and was going to start preliminary animal trials later today but he was so sure that this would give his career the boost it needed, this would definitely work, and offered a sample of the product to Sam. Sam, taunted and teased for his birthmark for his entire life, jumped at the chance and applied it immediately. This was a bad idea. Within fifteen minutes Sam’s face was covered with painful boils and he was rushed to the office infirmary.  

Colonel Flagg sat down at a large conference table, across from Arbco’s C.E.O. Jerry Gamma, COO Richard Gershwin, and CFO James Cochran. 

“Gentleman, I want to keep this short and simple. The U.S. Government is in negotiations to begin purchasing weapons from our dear old friend, James McCullen. Now, I don’t need to tell you how McCullen is rumored to sell to all groups, whether friend or foe, government or terrorist, insurgent or defender. We cannot allow this transaction to occur. I need-- We, the people of America, need to not have any M.A.R.S. weapons reach out shores or to allow McCullen to Launder his blood money on the pristine beaches of Lady Liberty” 

“Why are you coming to us with this Lawrence? We have nothing to do with McCullen” said Chief of Operations Richard Gershwin. 

“One of the riders for this contract, Richard, is that he had to partner with an American company to distribute his armament, and Arbco is the only logistics company he’s not been rejected by for ethical concerns. We need Arbco to say no when MARS comes calling.”

“Reject business? Especially from someone who could help us with the European Market? Are you nuts?” asked the CFO

“Colonel Flagg, please excuse James, he’s a little profit oriented” said Jerry. “I could theoretically pass on McCullen’s business but what’s in it for us? Last month the Navy rejected our bid for supplying Wadsworth, and now you’re asking us to say no to McCullen?”

“Jerry, I’m sorry about Wadsworth, but I can guarantee--”

Just then an office assistant burst into the office “Colonel, your driver, he’s been injured” 



Chapter 4: Curses

	When Samuel woke he was in a dark room, medical machines beeped and flashed at a regular interval. He attempted to sit up but found his body restrained, he attempted to call out but there was a breathing tube down his throat. His face, hands and body seemed to be heavily bandaged. He had no idea what time, day or even where he was. The last he remembered was trying some skin cream handed to him by a doctor, and then pain, burning, searing pain, followed by darkness. After a while a doctor came in to the small room, turning on an overhead light. He looked first at the machines connected to Sam, then to Sam’s chart, before turning to leave. Sam called out to the doctor as loudly as he could but with the tube all that came out was a hissing noise. The doctor stopped, turned, and finally looked at Sam. 

“Mr. Kessler? Can you hear me?” asked the physician

“SssHSSSssss” was the only response Sam could muster.

“I’ll take that as a yes” said the doctor “you’ve been through quite an ordeal, and we currently have you on enough pain medication that you shouldn’t really be conscious” the doctor got really close to Sam’s face at this point “the lawyers for Arbco have to be told that you’re awake, and they are going to ask you to sign a waiver of your rights to sue the company in exchange for medical care, please do yourself a favor and refuse to sign, they will screw you over if they can,” he whispered before departing.

Shortly after there was an older gentleman in a dark suit entering the room. He had salt and pepper hair and wrinkles showing many hours of stress. 

“Mr. Kessler, my name is Sam Paoli, legal counsel representing ARBCO Industries. I’m here as a formality—there’s some paperwork to finalize regarding the incident. I won’t take much of your time, I just need you to sign a form releasing Arbco of any liability from your misuse of an untested unauthorised chemical. In exchange for this waiver and your silence on this incident we are prepared to cover all medical expenses associated with your...incident” 

“SSSfsuhkoou” Sam said before wiggling his arms to display the restraints.

“Ah, let me loosen those for you,” the Lawyer said, mistakenly. He undid the restraints on both arms before Sam grabbed him by the throat. It might be worth mentioning that Sam, while locally known for his dealership and the two debate championships he won at the regional level, had been taught the basics of Judo by his brother, Dan. He threw the choking lawyer to the ground before undoing the rest of his restraints. He then yanked the breathing tube out of his own throat and threw it at the lawyer “choke on this you creep” Sam hoarsely shouted. Sam began yanking off his bandages and found a mirror, and had his mind shattered. Replacing the pale white skin were hardened, scale shaped bumps, some were a khaki brown, some were black and formed a diamond pattern going up and over his forehead. Gone was the brown hair, gone were his ears - now just holes on the sides of his head, gone were his lips, just a line parting his skull from his jaw. Gone was his nose, two oval slits for nostrils remaining. He remembered a time years ago, back when he and his brother were just kids going to school. Sam’s birthmark had caught the attention of a local man named Joe, who taunted him, calling Sam ‘snake boy’. Joe was given a pass by most of the locals as he served as a Sunday School teacher and youth pastor.

*That mark is a sign from god, it's a sign of your evil. It shows the snake inside you that you will become*. Sam’s brother, who was still a teen at the time, wasted no time bloodying the lip of this bully, and telling Sam, *Don’t worry, I’ll always be here for you. I won’t let anything happen to you.*

 He shattered the mirror by crushing it with one hand. He then turned to the lawyer, hoarsely shrieking “WHAT HAVE YOU DONE TO ME!!”

“There wasn’t anything we could do, the reaction you had was extreme and unstoppable, your nose and ears literally fell off, they are currently being dissected for study, your skin blistered and then the blisters hardened before collapse into scales, I’m sorry, please don’t hurt me, I’ll rewrite the contract, just please don’t hurt me” begged the lawyer, terror in his eyes. 

Sam gazed upon the lawyer, frozen in fear. He realized for the first time the power of fear, the true power of terror and the potential for terrorizing those who stood against him. He walked over to the lawyer, offering a hand to help him up before sitting on the bed. He handed the lawyer the agreement and a pen.

“WRITE!” he screamed at the lawyer

Mr. Paoli began editing the contract, initializing his changes. The contract now granted Sam the equivalent to fifty one percent of Arbco’s outstanding stocks as well as cost free health care related to this incident. Sam signed it and was now the richest man in Springfield. 

The next day, in ARBCO’s boardroom there was a meeting between Mr Paoli and Jerry Gamma, COO Gershwin, and CFO Richard Cochrane 

“YOU GAVE AWAY THE COMPANY!?!” shouted Cochrane. 

“I didn’t know what else to do, he...he has people on the outside that know” said Mr. Paoli

“Bullshit! No one knows and we pay you to keep them from knowing” replied Gamma, who was rubbing his temples

“Then explain that listening device that fell off the Colonel’s briefcase. That was too advanced to not be industrial espionage” replied Paoli

“That has nothing to do with--” said Gershwin

“The Colonel didn’t put it there!, besides, giving this guy stock puts him into the same liability as the company, he’d sue himself if he sues us, plus its...the right thing,” said Paoli

“What’s next, Paoli, a corner office with his own secretary? They guy is a used car salesman, he’s less than a door to door encyclopedia salesman,” said Gamma, standing up suddenly and clutching his head before falling to the ground. 

Chapter 5: New Leadership

Twenty minutes later Jerry Gamma was rushed to the Springfield hospital, having suffered a major stroke. Weeks went by with Jerry’s condition slowly deteriorating, followed by death. The COO and CFO both panicked in reaction to their colleagues death, each selling off the remaining balance of their ARBCO portfolios and leaving the country. They knew that without the leadership of Gamma the company would fail to maintain what it once was. Within a few days Sam was named CEO of ARBCO, although no one had seen him. Sam was too vain to appear before the board directly, instead having Mr. Paoli act on his behalf. Under Sam’s leadership a contract was quickly signed giving MARS a route for distribution to both the U.S. Military and civilian populous.  Sam increased the budget to R&D tenfold with a new focus on non-weapon military equipment, MRE’s, optics, protective gear, tank treads and tires for vehicles, and uniforms. He opened discussions with oil producing nations to increase distribution globally like never before. ARBCO was becoming dominant in the art of worldwide distribution. Arbco knew profit like never before and all of the employees enjoyed the life that Sam was creating for them, until they bit the hand that fed them. 

Samuel stayed largely in the shadows both physically and legally. Arbco’s office was renovated adding two floors to the top. The fifth floor was where the roof had been and was the last floor that the elevator would go to. It would arrive on the fifth floor but unless you had a security key, the elevator door simply would not open, and after a few moments would go down to the fourth floor. The sixth floor had its own separate elevator that only went from the fifth to the sixth floor, with a different security key, and was vacant except for one twenty foot by twenty foot room in one corner of the floor, the rest left completely vacant, bare cement with no lights. When Samuel would leave the building for the night he would dress up as a janitor, wearing a heavy rubber mask to cover his scaration. 

Samuel hired execs from Extensive Enterprises and Mars to run the majority of daily operations (they were located on the fifth floor), made all of the sales force salary based with additional commission based bonuses for all agents. He instituted a company minimum wage nearly twice that of the federal minimum. All employees enjoyed premium health, life, dental, and vision insurance that made long term employees of the most generous companies slightly envious. It wasn’t until after the annual christmas party that the employees started to question their boss. It had been tradition to have a catered christmas party presided over by the board, but shortly after thanksgiving it was announced that there would be no christmas dinner. Samuel could not stand the thought of celebrating the holiday without his brother and could not bear the false fraternization with the hired riff raff. Yes, he paid them well and gave the best benefits, but this was to insure the cogs would have no interest in leaving the machine, not because he liked these simpering morons. The daily operations were largely self running with some insight from his friends at Extensive Enterprises and advise from Mr. McCullen senior. Samuel began receiving memos from staff asking about him personally, all correspondence was handled through his lawyer, Mr. Paoli, but Sam still saw the memos and wanted to respond with venom and vitriol, this was tempered by his lawyer. By March several long term managers who had been with the company prior to Samuel were demanding a meeting with their mysterious boss. The first five managers to demand a meeting were fired without comment, the sixth, seventh, and eighth were mysteriously assaulted in the middle of the night by an unknown assailant.

Samuel amassed a fortune that was constantly being reinvested in the company, living mostly off of the dividends. Within two years he had also acquired all the information he needed on the ranger he blamed for the death of his brother, a vet that was simply called ‘Snake Eyes’.  He looked into a mirror, scaly scars covering his skin, “Snake Eyes? Just wait until you meet the real snake”. He then placed a call to a number given to him by Mr. McCullen, not James senior but James junior, whom he had only recently been introduced to. It seems that James Senior had recently suffered a stroke, while non-fatal it did force his son to take over the family business. The phone was ringing on the other end and then was answered by the most nondescript voice Samuel had ever heard. 

“You shouldn’t have this number. So either you're dead already, or you’ve got cash and a name I want to hear.””

“I was given this number by a friend from Scotland who said you could take care of an issue I have, you are Firefly?” 

“Ok, I require all pertinent information before I’ll name a price. The price is non-negotiable, non-refundable, and I offer no guarantee of success. You’re familiar with the Springfield quarry on route 231? Meet me there in one week with all the information at 2300 hours” the line then disconnected, leaving Sam to wonder how this Firefly person knew Sam was in Springfield, McCullen must have told this Firefly to expect the call, Sam thought. 

Chapter 6: Ashes of the Serpent

Smoke coiled like a living thing from the top floors of the ARBCO headquarters, blotting out the stars above Springfield. Sirens screamed through the streets, chasing each other in tight circles. Somewhere in the depths of the city, someone was already blaming Samuel.

Less than twenty minutes earlier, Sam had received a call from a familiar female voice with a thick eastern european accent.

""They’re moving without you. Emergency session at 0400. Level 4. Be ready.""

He didn’t trust many people, but he trusted the source enough to act. He disguised himself in the janitor uniform he’d used many times before—hooded coveralls, mask, gloves. The staff never looked twice at the overnight cleaners. He used the freight elevator up to the fifth floor, then the private lift to the sixth.

It started as a tremor. Then a thunderclap. The floor beneath him buckled. The hallway he had just stepped into exploded in a hail of fire and shattered metal. Screams. The sixth floor was gone. The fifth was already consumed in flame. He didn’t wait for the dust to settle—he ran, coughing, stumbling, blood running from a cut above his eye.

Down below, the ARBCO tower was already being surrounded by flashing lights and emergency personnel. Cameras were turning. 

He didn’t see the footage yet, but it would show him—just him—entering the building minutes before the explosion. No board members. No witnesses. Just a CEO in disguise entering a building that was no longer his.

When Sam emerged into the loading bay, coughing and limping, someone shouted, ""That’s him!""

Floodlights hit him like gunfire. Security teams in black uniforms surged forward. Sam turned, looking for any way out. Then he heard it:

*Thup-thup-thup-thup.*

A shadow cut across the smoke-choked sky. Sleek, insectile, and silent but for its blades, the black FANG helicopter descended like a ghost. The prototype he remembered authorizing only weeks earlier, never fully tested. And now it hovered just above him, cockpit door flung open.

A woman in black armor leaned out, visor glinting, voice cold and absolute.

""Come with me if you want to live, Sam.""

He blinked. ""Beatrice?""

She leapt down, boots striking the pavement.

""That name was always a lie,"" she said, her accent thicker than he remembered, her posture coiled and ready. ""Call me what I am—The Baroness.""

Gunfire erupted behind them. Someone shouted for a stun round. Sam didn’t hesitate. He grabbed her outstretched arm, let her haul him into the cockpit. The FANG screamed upward, wind and smoke tearing past them. Springfield shrank below as the tower burned.

He coughed, spitting blood. ""What... what the hell just happened?""

The Baroness handed him a tablet. On screen: security footage. The board meeting on the fourth floor. Gamma. Gershwin. Cochrane. Mr. Paoli, silent and seated in the corner. They were watching something. Listening. Then the footage changed—security logs being altered, cameras being disabled, and finally... footage spliced of Sam entering alone.

""They framed me,"" he whispered.

""They did more than that,"" she said. ""They tried to erase you.""

He looked out the window. Below, Springfield was ablaze with flashing lights. His kingdom in ruin.

""Where are we going?""

The Baroness didn’t turn. She simply guided the FANG toward open water.

""To the Island. Where the old world ends... and your new one begins.""

As the mainland vanished behind a curtain of smoke and distance, Samuel sat back in the co-pilot’s seat, blood crusted to his temple, his skin already tightening beneath the bandages.

He looked at the Baroness—his rescuer, his betrayer, maybe both—and whispered, ""Let’s build something better.""

Far ahead, barely visible through the dark clouds and sea spray, a jagged crescent of land loomed on the horizon. Waiting.

I 31(M) have been talking to this girl 31(F) for a few months now. It's started out with talking as most things do. After about a week we decided to meet up at her place for talking and coffee. I was really starting to like this girl. We eventually had a conversation about me helping her get her apartment in order and declutter. I spent my off days staying late at her house helping her clean and organizing. 

Things were going good. Then one night we were hanging out and decided to play cards against humanity just us to. Things turned spicy real quick and we eventually slept together that night. She had to go to church the next morning so I decided to spend the night and accompany her in the morning. I felt like things were finally going right. Then everything changed. 

She stopped texting, video messaging and calling for about a week. I thought I had done something wrong. I know I wasn't the greatest in bed but still to ghost me seemed kind of odd. A few weeks later I finally heard back and that's when I got her story. Through our that week she explained a member in her family had passed and another diagnosised with cancer. She began to spiral and drink heavy understandable. 

A few more months pass and things get worse. She loses her apartment and custody of her kid. She is a wreck at this point. I'm doing my best to help her emotionally and financially. I'm not rich by any means but I can't stand to see a girl in trouble.  Weeks go by and she is finally stable. She is in a new apartment and has a new job. Things are finally looking up. Meanwhile I'm in the background providing as much support as possible. She is calling me everyday now to vent and to keep me updated. I'm finally getting the impression that we can finally resume what was started between. 

She calls me like she does and tells me how great things have been and that she meet someone at the college where she works. They have been sleeping together for months. And that's she's never felt more alive. And my heart just sunk. Why was I putting in all this effort and money? It was a lost cause. I didn't know how to react. So I told her I needed to hang up and compose myself. I then sent her a text that said I was just surprised and a little hurt. She texted back saying that I should have known that we were just friends. I didn't know how to react so I blocked her on everything. Maybe I was pretty but my feelings should count too right?

1l61mix,https://i.redd.it/kqg2med17m5f1.jpeg,Angela stole my bike in my dream last night,"This is so weird but I thought It’d be funny to post this here. I hope that’s okay so let me know if I should post it somewhere else! I’m not exactly sure if there’s a “smosh dream” page or something…. I’d be quite concerned if there was honestly lol

I’ve literally never had a dream about smosh or any of the members before, but I had the absolute STRANGEST dream of my life last night. The funniest part is parts of this could totally be a bit (maybe?) so I hope other people laugh from it a little.


I’m a college student right now and I’ve been really stressing over internships and employment and I guess that ended up showing up in my dream???? Basically, I got a position as an intern for smosh, except it was barely an internship. 

One of my jobs as an intern was to help hide the fact that Anthony and Amanda had psychic powers and would often cause strange things to happen on set as a result. So anytime something flew around or magically appeared we (the interns) had to quietly and discretely get rid of the “evidence.”

The only other job I can remember was helping set up and run errands for the crew and (very rarely) the cast. One example was running off to buy Josh some coffee from the shop that ran a floor below the office. There was a whole metal staircase outside that led down to this skater themed coffee shop- it honestly was so cool. (The shop later tried to compile evidence that there were wizards / magic people at smosh so we had to hide them in the bathroom at one point)

This last job relates to the title of this post. For some reason the cast went to this odd celebrity meet and greet in downtown LA as some of the celebrities. This “meet and greet” mind you was in an I-Hop. I remember seeing Tom Holland and Zendaya sitting in one booth and Tom Cruz in another, again very very weird dream. I was riding my bike around inside (in the aisles????) to check on everyone and make sure everyone had everything, when I went outside to find Chance who wasn’t in the building for some reason. I saw him standing in the parking lot of the I-hop, which wasn’t very far away so I didn’t feel the need to lock my bike when I put it on one of the bike racks. I asked him what was wrong and if he needed anything and he just asked if I could grab some food from across the highway street for him. I said yes of course (this was a dream so dream logic said it was normal) and walked across the street to grab him a sandwich from Dunkin or something. I don’t remember what the store was, but I do remember coming back across the street and not seeing Chance anywhere. I did however, see Angela get onto my bike and ride away from the I-Hop. 

When I tell you dream me was SO distraught it was the absolute funniest thing in the fucking world. I went over to the bike rack after watching her speed away and just threw my hands in the air like a disappointed dad. I am literally a broke college student so I can’t afford a new bike and most internships (in my field at least) aren’t for pay anyways, so I’m inferring that dream me wasn’t very lucky with getting a salary. Basically, Angela stole my only mode of transportation and I vividly remember walking back to my house in the middle of the road as if I was a car. 

How could you Angela I’ve literally never even met you wth 😭😭😭😭
