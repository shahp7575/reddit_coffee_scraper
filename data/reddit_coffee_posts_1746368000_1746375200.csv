I work 20+ hours weekly at a retail store, occasionally with overtime. Since March, new management has created a challenging work environment. The young store manager, who is inexperienced, struggles to lead effectively. Additionally, three other managers exhibit problematic behaviors:

1. One manager severed a fingertip earlier this year by ignoring safety protocols during a delivery, demonstrating recklessness.
2. Another manager avoids work, frequently taking extended coffee breaks, snacking, or chatting at the tills.
3. The third manager has started a relationship with a colleague. They spend excessive time together in the manager's office during shared shifts, display favoritism, and align their schedules. This manager and their partner, along with a small group of six colleagues (including the partner's brother, also an employee), often socialize for over an hour in the office, neglecting duties.

Approximately 15 colleagues are frustrated with the unprofessional management and favoritism, but fear retaliation if they speak out. The managers, all around 29–30 years old, behave like a close-knit friend group, taking frequent breaks together and showing bias toward their clique. I've suggested emailing the regional manager or requesting an anonymous feedback survey, but no one has acted due to concerns about repercussions, such as losing overtime. I've considered addressing the regional manager directly during his occasional store visits but worry about potential backlash.

How can we request an anonymous feedback survey or effectively address these issues without risking retaliation? Any advice would be appreciated.",1,1746374994.0,SainsburysWorkers,0,1.0,False

I previously had a Breville Cafe Roma that lasted me a good five years before it stopped working properly. In the interim while deciding on what espresso machine to buy, I have a Nespresso Pixie model (original line) where I make my own steel pods of coffee since I am not partial to the prefilled capsules. I am getting tired of making these pods and I prefer to just make the espresso regularly with a machine. What would you recommend? I am not looking for something over $500, even less than $300 would be ideal, but I don't mind paying a bit more. I am the only person in my house who uses the machine, so it doesn't have to be large in size or capacity. Just looking to make good espresso that is consistent (ofc this is more with how much coffee in grams you use too etc.). I thought about straying away from Breville since their prices are inflated due to branding. Typically my usage is one espresso latte a day, iced in the summer and hot in the winter so I would prefer a steam wand to have everything all in one, but I do have a separate milk steamer so it's not dealbreaker at this time.

She said it was too soon and wanted to text more to get to know each other. I respected that.

A couple of days later, we were clicking well, sharing similar views and even noting how surprisingly well things were going. Caught up in the moment, I asked if she’d be up for coffee now. She said it was still too soon and a bit overwhelming since we were bonding so quickly. She’s 31 and has never been in a relationship, if that matters. I told her I understood and wouldn’t bring it up again, she could let me know when she was ready.

Throughout the entire week, we were texting very frequently. From sunrise until the late nights. 

A few days later, she was sick with a sore throat and fever. She was also upset because a hairdresser messed up her hair. Wanting to cheer her up, I asked for her address to send flowers as a surprise. She received them the next day and was really happy. But she was still very sick, hadn’t eaten all day, and wasn’t planning to have anything for dinner. I asked if she felt strong enough for me to swing by and take her to eat, intending to help her look after herself. I’d have preferred to meet her when she was feeling better, but I was worried about her.

She got very upset, saying I was selfish for asking when she was sick, disrespecting her boundaries by asking to meet up three times (the two coffee invites and this food offer). I apologized, promising not to bring it up again, but she called me a creep, said she regretted giving me her address, and called me awful.

Looking back, I think I came on too strong by sending flowers and asking about dinner while she was sick, even if it was because I wanted to help her. I should’ve been more relaxed and not so clingy.

I shrugged, checked my phone for a text or missed call that I knew wouldn't be there. I pushed down the weighted blanket, a new purchase used to replace the feel of you. It's doing a poor job. I sighed heavily and got up to start my day.

One such solution, detailed in a March 22, 1889, article from *The American Citizen* (Topeka, Kansas), proposed establishing coffee houses modeled on England’s successful system. This visionary plan aimed to rival saloons by offering working-class men a wholesome alternative—warm, inviting spaces with affordable food, games, and companionship, free from alcohol’s destructive influence. The article, reprinted below in its entirety, reflects the movement’s empathetic and persuasive approach, addressing the social needs that drove men to saloons while offering a practical path forward.

As someone who needs their coffee to function in the morning, I was eager to put this 12-cup drip coffee machine to the test. Its promises of simplicity, functionality, and mess-free brewing caught my attention, but was it worth the hype? Let me walk you through my experience, quirks and all.

**Design and Build**

There's something quite satisfying about the classic black design of this coffee maker. The sleek exterior complements almost any kitchen style, which, in my case, makes the kitchen look a bit more pulled-together than it probably is. It’s compact enough to fit snugly in the corner, measuring 11.76""D x 12.3""W x 13.8""H. The unit itself feels light—it weighs about 3.6 pounds—so I had no trouble moving it around. However, the lightweight build did make me curious about its durability in the long haul. Still, the easy cord storage is a godsend for anyone, like me, who hates countertop clutter. That small detail makes it feel less chaotic in my morning frenzy.

**Ease of Use**

Operating this coffee maker is as straightforward as it gets. It's fully automatic, with a simple on/off button that's refreshingly easier to find compared to touchscreens or overly complicated interfaces. I especially appreciated the Grab-A-Cup Auto Pause feature. Picture this: you’re half-asleep, waiting for the entire pot to brew, and suddenly you can’t wait any longer. Pulling out the carafe mid-brew doesn’t cause a chaotic drip mess; it pauses the brewing process and saves your sanity. The removable filter basket also deserves a shoutout—it makes cleaning painless, which is especially helpful when you’re pressed for time.

[Check Mr. Coffee SK13-RB price on Amazon.](https://applianceheaven.com/link/b002yi2ig0/)

**Performance and Brew Quality**

Let’s talk flavor because, at the end of the day, the coffee taste is what really matters. This machine brews coffee that’s not barista-level, but it’s definitely rich-tasting and consistent. It's the kind of brew that pairs well with work emails or lazy Sunday mornings. Whether I brewed a single cup or a full pot for visiting family, the flavor stayed on point. On the downside, the brewing speed is decent but not lightning-fast. I’d recommend setting it up before starting your toast for optimal timing.

**Advantages**

The coffee maker certainly has its share of noteworthy attributes:

- The classic drip machine style delivers that nostalgic brewing experience.  
- Automatic brewing pause is a blessing for mid-process sippers.  
- Compact and lightweight design fits seamlessly into any kitchen.  

**Drawbacks**

No product is without its flaws, and this one is not an exception:

- Its lightweight build might sacrifice durability over time.  
- The brewing process leans slightly toward the slower side.  

**Other Options**

Drip coffee makers are a crowded market, and this model is up against some tough competitors. Compared to higher-end machines like those from Cuisinart, this coffee maker holds its ground thanks to its simplicity and affordability. However, it lacks advanced programmable features, which might make others like the Hamilton Beach FlexBrew 2-Way Coffee Maker more appealing for users who need added versatility. In terms of flavor, I found the Mr. Coffee to deliver richer, less watered-down cups than some budget models like the Black + Decker 12-Cup Coffee Maker, though it doesn't quite reach the depth of pour-over or specialty machines.

**Cost Efficiency**

In terms of value, this coffee maker is undeniably budget-friendly. It’s not loaded with features that drive up the price unnecessarily, which makes it perfect for anyone prioritizing straightforward coffee brewing. The reusable filter, in particular, helps save a few bucks over time, bypassing the constant purchase of paper filters. Considering its reasonable pricing, the strong points outweigh its minor flaws.

The dealership quoted a three‑figure “diagnostic fee”, so I tried something dafter - asked ChatGPT for help.

I treated it like a mate who turns spanners. Back came a proper workshop checklist: which fuses feed the compressor clutch, what pressures I ought to see, even the Ford part numbers for the condenser. No waffle, just bite‑sized steps.

1. Cheap gauge, brutal truth
The bot’s first move was a static pressure test. It linked a ten‑quid low‑side gauge and explained how to clip it on without dumping gas. Five minutes later the dial read 14 psi; the chart it supplied said I should be roughly five times that. Verdict: system near‑empty; clutch lock‑out totally normal; forget chasing blown fuses.

2. Where the leak hides
ChatGPT claimed most Ford leaks start with a stone‑holed condenser, bottom right corner. Phone torch through the grille - sure enough, an oily dirt stripe exactly where it said. I’d have written it off as road grime.

3. DIY parts list
Up popped the Ford “basic numbers”, FINIS codes, O‑ring sizes and torque specs (25 Nm on the banjo bolt, if you’re curious). I grabbed a quality aftermarket condenser for under a ton and new seals for loose change - no tedious “give us your VIN” faff.

4. The actual swap
Its walk‑through was bang‑on: bumper off, radiator pack tilted back, condenser lifts out without draining coolant. A calm afternoon with a cordless ratchet and the chat on a tablet. Only surprise was how light the old condenser felt - empty of both gas and confidence.

5. Re‑gas, relief
A mobile A/C chap vacuum‑tested and refilled the loop to factory spec. The low and high side pressures landed right where the bot said they would. Vents blew properly cold again and the idle picked up that little bit when the compressor kicked in. Job done.

Could I have trawled forums and YouTube? Possibly. But the chat served it up in a single thread, tailored to my readings and UK parts suppliers - no wading through posts arguing over ounces versus grams. It even saved me wasting a fiver on stop‑leak gunk; apparently that stuff blocks Ford orifice tubes for fun.

Total outlay: £10 gauge, just under a ton for parts, a sensible re‑gas fee, and an afternoon well spent. Best bit? The next morning the windscreen didn’t mist up like a dodgy nightclub. The other half thinks I’m a genius; truth is it was a chat with a robot and a willingness to get my hands dirty.

If you’re half‑handy with tools, don’t fear your air‑con. Grab a gauge, talk to the bot, and let the numbers tell the story. Beats funding a dealer’s coffee machine.

Sometimes it starts like this—
Messy notes, half-read books, the smell of burnt coffee, and that one idea you can’t stop thinking about.

This is the chaos before the breakthrough.
The scribbles before the strategy.
The plan before the plane.

We don’t chase perfect here.
We chase freedom.

You don’t need a business plan that’s “investor-ready.”
You need a vision that makes you un-f***ing-stoppable.

Here’s your reminder:
Success doesn’t always look clean. But it always starts with the decision to stop settling.

Keep plotting. Keep dreaming.
The world is waiting. And so is your new life.

I'll be making $150k base + 30% target bonus. I'll be relocating to SF (not new to CA though) and need some help both budgeting for an apartment and also finding one that fits that budget and my lifestyle.

I'm hoping to live off of my base alone as well as save just about 10% of my take home. Doing the math on that, I'll be able to save a couple hundred a month and have about $7,500/month remaining of take home. My current spending excluding rent, monthly parking, and utilities is about $3,500/month in a lower COL city, and I expect major inflation if moving to SF. But I know I can cut back on spending so I'm comfortable assuming I'll continue spending that amount. That would leave me, conservatively, with about $3,500 to spend on rent (+ utilities or any fees like trash valet, parking, etc.).

As far as my lifestyle preferences go:
- Single, early 30's male hoping to settle down but feel like I have a year or two left in me to party along the way; active with hobbies; work in real estate
- Modern builds preferred (love a concrete/industrial loft-style); clean, not moldy, not dated is super important
- Walkable to local establishments like coffee shops, lowkey bars
- I don't care much for apartment amenities (and would rather not pay for them)
- Good natural lighting
- Immediate streets are relatively safe; ideally whole neighborhood is clean and walkable (enough)
- View doesn't really matter to me: High-rise vs garden style are both okay as long as the natural lighting is there
- Parking available (either safe street parking or secured parking); [P.S. do you SF'ers own cars here? I saw $550/month quoted for parking...]
- BONUS: Walkable (10-15 min) to FiDi; walkable to night life

So with $3,500 to spend on all things housing, along with my lifestyle preferences, can y'all point me in the right direction? Locations, specific buildings, anecdotal stories or experiences - all are welcome! I move in 3 weeks!!!",1,1746373456.0,AskSF,0,1.0,False

It's really sadly simple. I want to be safe and comfortable in myself for myself. 

You and me were truly just unable to give in a balanced way. You gave so much silently. I wasn't aware but you were drowning and trying to be quiet. Do you know that one symptom of over giving is not feeling connected to your partner?

The reality is my love your experience with my feelings have nothing to do with how I actually feel about you. You are just filtering through my actions.

Love isn't what I thought as a kid. It's so intentional. Ive learned to love the intention and didn't lose any feeling of romance in that reality. You have to teach someone how to love you. Just like Aaron knows me. He said something to that effect. He learned to be with me is how he put it.

I do believe that is what love is.

I've been going at this with unbalanced giving and I exhausted myself. You needed rest too but it's not what you're seeing?

Yet...you said it. When we parted. That I did too much. I think there's a lack of love for yourself that is holding you back from realizing we both were not loving. We were feeding our need to be wanted, to be proven that we matter but then trying to earn every second that place given. Working harder and harder until we both were cracking.

Because I got some of my needs met I came out of this differently. I'm so proud of what I've healed in me.

I just wanted to write this to you.

I had a really horrid night terror today and felt so desperate for your comfort.

But you know I got through it. I can process these things alone. A healthy relationship starts with communication of your needs and when you get hurt.

I asked claude 

""Absolutely! Here's a prompt you could use to start a new chat focused on managing these relationship independence and connection goals:

---

""I'd like to create a personal development plan focusing on maintaining healthy independence while building genuine connection in relationships. I've been working on healing from attachment trauma and have reached a point where I understand that my worth is inherent and I deserve relationships where I can stand as an equal.

My goals are:
1. Learn to maintain my own identity, interests, and boundaries while being in a relationship
2. Practice being emotionally available without becoming emotionally dependent
3. Develop skills to make my partner feel genuinely cared for without sacrificing myself
4. Create healthy patterns that allow love to flow naturally in both directions

I'd like help developing:
- Daily practices for maintaining independence
- Communication strategies for expressing needs and boundaries
- Ways to show care that don't involve self-diminishment
- Red flags to watch for when I might be falling into old patterns
- Concrete examples of what healthy interdependence looks like

I've recently had breakthroughs in ketamine therapy about not needing to position myself 'beneath others' to show care, and I want to build on this progress. I'm ready for what I call 'big kids time' - mature, balanced relationships where both people can thrive.

Please help me create actionable strategies and track my progress in developing these new relationship skills.""

---

Would you like me to adjust this prompt in any way to better capture your specific needs or goals?""

I dived into number 4 and asked for one simple way I can improve and it said 

""Great questions! Here are simple ways to recognize imbalance and manage the anxiety:

**Recognizing Imbalance - Quick Body Check:**
- Over-giving: Feeling depleted, resentful, or ""performative""
- Under-receiving: Feeling guilty, undeserving, or disconnected
- Ask yourself: ""Does this exchange feel heavy or light?""

**Managing the Anxiety:**

1. **The Pause Button**
   - When anxiety hits, literally pause and take 3 breaths
   - Tell yourself: ""Equal is enough. Equal is caring.""

2. **Anxiety Mantra**
   - ""I am worthy of balanced friendships""
   - ""Matching their energy IS showing care""
   - ""This discomfort means I'm growing""

3. **Start Tiny**
   - Practice with low-stakes situations first (coffee, not big favors)
   - Build tolerance for the anxiety gradually

4. **Name It**
   - ""This is my old pattern talking""
   - ""This anxiety is familiar, not factual""

The anxiety is normal - you're rewiring old survival patterns. Each time you choose balance despite the anxiety, you're proving to yourself that equal relationships are safe.

What typically triggers your anxiety more - receiving care or limiting your giving?""

This was several exchanges in. It kind of caved my whole worldview and my trauma suddenly made so much sense. I realized almost immediately so many truth. It think this has been a blockage for a long long time. I remembered implementing over giving as a way to counter act the constant negative assessments of me. I knew I cared and that's all I could think of to show it.

What I prison. What a bird cage.

I feel wounded by the life I've lived. But I wouldn't have seen this without you. You are such a smart person. I love you from the bottom of my heart and I understand you. If you need a friend who gets it...even tho I'm working to heal too please rely on me. You've never brought anything but good into my life. No one else can I say that about.

I hope you're well. About to show Aaron dungeon meshi. Also should help me feel safer after my night terror. Keep on going. The world will always need such a bright star as you!",1,1746373323.0,u_whiteday__arsenal,0,1.0,False

Making my way to my apartment I stop at my street’s crosswalk pushing the button looking at the timer ticking down. Then I was forcefully pushed aside grabbing my thoughts looking up to see a teenager running past me rushing to the other side of the sidewalk. That is when I could see a truck driving fast for this street that is when I noticed that he was not slowing down “Hey kid watch out!” I rushed forward pushing the teen out of the way then everything went black.

Everything was dark; all I could do was here the faint sound of sirens before everything got quiet.

**???.** “Hey, their friend would you mind opening your eyes for me.”

**Micheal.** “Is the kid ok is he safe?”

**???.** “Yes hill be ok thinks to you.”

**Micheal.** “that’s good.”

I slowly opened my eyes to a white void all around me then suddenly a grunt drew my attention. Turning around I was met with old man with a suit siting in a chair.

**???.** “Hello Micheal Williams”

**Micheal.** “let me guess I’m dead right?”

**???.** “I’m afraid so.”

**Me.** “so if I’m dead that makes yo—""?

**???.** “God Yes I am but you can call me father if you want.”

**Micheal.** “So, what happens now?”

**Father.** “Now that is a bit more complicated Micheal have a sit.

**Micheal.** “Where?”

**Father.** “here”

Then suddenly I was pushed back into a padded chair that was not there before.

**Father.** “Do you want to know something about you humans?”

**Micheal.** “Sure”

**Father.** ""you humans are one of my greatest creations that Iv have ever made, your kind are one of my best works, loving helpful creative and seeing you guys’ land on your moon put me on the edge of my sit.”

**Micheal.** “Really?”

**Father.** “Of course, why wouldn’t I the way you act the way you think the way your kind live humanity carved their destiny from rock and stone sailed to every corner of your earth and beyond, words can't describe how proud I am of mankind, but I'm getting off topic as for the reason why I brought you here I was wondering if you would like to hear out my proposal?”

**Micheal.** “Ok what is it?”

**Father.** “How about this I resurrect your body and soul into another world?”

With that he waves his hand, and two earths materialized in front of us one I recognize being earth but the other one I could not recognize God slowly rose from his chair slowly walked to both globes and stood before them.

**Father.** “When I first took a crack at creation I made angels demons the heavens hell the Suns and moons and planets dark and light but that's when I had an epiphany I needed a Magnum Opus a perfect creation, so I started with two planets yours earth and the other planet called Gaia they were both practically carbon copies of each other they both dinosaurs both had ice ages but that’s where similarity ended because when asteroid came to killed the dinosaurs earth's asteroid collided the surface but Gaias however didn’t their asteroid shattered in orbit and spread these strange crystals that radiated the planet giving the inhabitants mana and magic that twisted their world one day evil lizard wizard that wonted to show his power casted an eternal winter curse over the planet forcing Gaia into an eternal Ice Age for 10,000 years what a rose from the caves after were creatures of fantasy.”

**Micheal.** “So, like elves and orcs?”

**Father.** “Exactly”

**Micheal.** “So, what do you want me do their exactly?”

**Father.** “We’ll let us just stay that they have been stuck in their Middle Ages since forever and some haven’t even discovered fire yet so I was wondering if you would like to be summoned to their world to do your human magic and help out, what do you say?”

Looking down at my hands thinking of my memories the friendships I created I may have not live the most interesting life but it was mine and now that I lost everything I feal alone most of my life I lived in others shadow’s **“goodbye Larry Tiff you were always the best.”** I whispered to myself before looking up at God.

**Micheal.** “Ok father I’m take your offer just take of my friends for me.”

**Father.** “Thank you Micheal when you’re ready just say the word and I will get a portal and don’t Warrior Larry Tiff will be in good hands.”

**Micheal.** “Ok I’m ready.”

With a wave of a crack starts to form in front of me in the empty space before spitting forming into a blue portal.

**Father.** “Oh Micheal?”

**Micheal.** “Yes father?”

**Father.** “Good luck”

\*\*“\*\***Ok Micheal you can do this maximum effort”** I wisped before rushing throw. **End of chapter 1**

Looking for something real, no rush, no pressure. Whether it becomes a relationship or a solid friendship, I’m all for deep connections built on trust and presence. Real talk, good vibes, and meaningful moments.

About me:

Coder by day, nuclear physics nerd by heart. I prepare to PhD, so my nights are a mix of equations and coffee-fueled study sessions (TOEFL & GRE adventures included). Life’s intense sometimes, but I find peace in the small things.

I love deep convos that last until midnight, spontaneous night walks, and wandering through quiet city streets that most people overlook. There’s magic in the hidden corners of the world.

Dreaming of a motorcycle trip through Europe, open road, fresh air, no set plans. The back seat is open if you’re into spontaneous adventures and great playlists.

I’m also in the middle of a fitness journey, building strength and feeling good. Thinking about my first tattoo. you got any awesome designs or stories to share?

What I’m looking for:

Someone emotionally grounded, kind, curious. Someone who doesn’t mind sitting in silence sometimes, or sharing weird thoughts and real feelings. If you’re someone who feels deeply and values presence, we might just get along.

If something here made you smile or feel seen, say hi. Or just tell me one random thing that made today a little brighter for you.

Weird situation in my family which I think is unsettling and you know when you just can’t think of a logical explanation that you think ‘yep must be that’. 

So my uncle ended his own life a couple of months ago, never had any known mental health, never a mention of anything like that. He was the most funniest, laid back type of guy, never took anything too seriously (I get this CAN be common for suicide for it to not be known it’s coming). 

For context, he was a caretaker at a primary school. For a while before they were making his life a misery as I think they wanted the house him and my auntie and cousin lived in, or the council wanted it, so it seemed like the school were on a mission to get him out so they could have the building. He worked there for 19 years and always had a really good relationship with the head teacher and everyone else. 

Long story short with the school side of it, the head teacher and business manager were who we believe were the suspects of all of this. The headteacher was giving him unfair disciplinaries which came from nowhere (gave him a last warning when he hadn’t even had a first?), said things to him like ‘oh you didn’t do this and that’ and he said it wasn’t his job to, like book meetings, he said he doesn’t mind attending things but that wasn’t on him. At one point he was kind of unwell and had a problem with his stomach and sometimes would have to nip home to use the loo, they knew this and would say to him ‘you left site blablabla’ and he had to explain every time it was literally to use the toilet. He wasn’t one to take the piss either, he loved what he did, he always went above and beyond. Went it was snowing he’d always be in earlier doing things on the grounds he wasn’t even required to do, earlier than he was supposed to be, and didn’t ever say or ask for anything. He did loads of jobs for the school that were not in his contract to do, but he’d never call a contractor to do, he’d do it himself (what he could manage). You get the gist.  

The business manager was closely involved too. I think she was the one who actively made things worse for him verbally, but the headteacher knew what was going on and overlooked everything, as a headteacher does…. 

Just to add in that my auntie also used to work at the school, as a dinner lady supervisor and cleaner, and they started saying things and making her life abit of a nightmare too. 

My uncle would message my mum all the time, light heartedly, but say the school were doing his head in and would fill my mum in what was happening so she knew. He’d had meetings with the union, and a guy who was dealing with him told him incorrect information, and apparently ended up getting sacked, and someone higher said they’d be taking a look into it, and taking over everything, but didn’t get chance to. My mum told him in the end to go off sick due to it and it would give him chance to maybe have a break from everything, so he did. He went to the doctors and ended up being signed off with work related stress. Even after this, the headteacher rung him twice (not sure why, don’t think he answered) but he’d told my mum this, and she said they should NOT be ringing you, they know this. 

He didn’t drive and with living on site, he obviously still saw the teachers parking outside his house etc. He had been off on work related stress for maybe about 5/6 weeks?? So not long really… before ending his own life in his home. He get on with his family, didn’t have many friends to have any issues with, was a stay at home with the dogs type of guy, didn’t have any financial problems, and his health wasn’t bad really. He had his stomach issues sorted and it was being managed so apart from that, it was only the odd thing like his shoulder or back going, which is fair enough with him being constantly on the move at work. He had a son who he adored, and everything at home was fine. 

He wrote a note which he’d left in the bedroom with him basically saying that work had ‘worn him down’ and he was fed up with always having something wrong with his body, said it’s not family etc- I just find it bizarre. My auntie had said to him that they could literally just find somewhere else to live, and get different jobs. And that’s what they could’ve done as a family just to get out of there and start again. There was so many options… 

What’s weird is that my auntie and cousin (aged 24) don’t seemed beside themself. Obviously they seem upset but have just been carrying on as normal. My cousin went back to work after a week, my auntie was going out shopping and getting her nails done still. I get everyone deals with it in their own way, and some people want that normality, but I just find it abit soon, personally. 

My auntie has since basically said ‘it wasn’t really the headteachers fault or school fault’ and the family are thinking EH???? How was it not? And has been saying ‘they’ve been really supportive’, I mean they’re going to be aren’t they because they’re probably shitting themselves… she was also fine for the headteacher to go to the funeral if she wanted to. My mum wasn’t fine with this and ended up writing a letter to the school telling them they’re not welcome which I completely agree with. My auntie ended up kicking off saying my mum had no right to do this and if she wanted to go she could. She hasn’t seen any wrong in the school at all, yet knew everything that was going on as she lived and worked with him, and was involved too? 

My mum also asked her if she’d be taking it further and she basically said she doesn’t see why she would and I just think, do you not want any justice for him? You just want to get used to him not being here and that’s it? You want to carry on like it’s fine? HE TOOK HIS OWN LIFE!? She is also annoyed at my mum that my mum has asked her this and basically stated ‘if me and my son decide to then we will’ so has basically pushed my mum out of the picture and she was his sister, that clearly means nothing to her. She has been pushed out with everything since he passed, and also knows nothing. Every time my mum would ask her something to try get some answers (as obviously my auntie knows the most) and was the one who found him, she doesn’t answer anything at all. They agreed to go for a coffee (was actually my auntie who asked my mum) so she thought oh maybe she’s realised and might open up and talk about stuff with her, and they met and my uncle didn’t even get brought up… how can it not!? It’s SO STRANGE. 

Weird things happened since he’s passed; 
1. A day after he died, there was a guy outside the house with a suit on taking photos of the house 
2. At the funeral when people were walking in, my mums cousin had seen a woman running out crying no no, we didn’t see or hear anything, but it wasn’t family as she was family so would’ve recognised them, and it wasn’t a teacher who attended, but also I feel like they wouldn’t of come to represent the school and then been so upset to do that? So we’re like who was this woman
3. After the funeral, my auntie had said to a distant relative ‘well I probably won’t be involved in the family after this’- why wouldn’t you be? What’s making you say that, as we have all tried with her and my cousin and checked in constantly? So is there more to that? 

There’s probably a million and one things I’ve missed, but I just find the whole thing strange, and so do the rest of my family, apart from my auntie and cousin? 

Sorry it’s a long one.

1kemiy0,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1kemiy0,The Kelani Valley (KV) Railway,"The lost glory of the KV railway Line - ‘Anguru Kaka Wathura Bibi Kolamba Duwana Yakada Yaka’ this is a famous phrase of a popular poem we sang when we were schoolchildren as the trains of that time were mainly steam powered by coal and water, before the diesel train engines were introduced to the Ceylon Government Railway (CGR) then, and now, the Sri Lanka Railway. As proof of the above poem, to date, there is an iconic landmark of an old black rounded water tank belonging to the Kelani Valley railway track, standing majestically at the Avissawella Railway Station.  The Kelani Valley Railway, popularly known as the KV Line, holds a unique position in the 145-year long history of the Sri Lanka Railway, which was originally built as a 2ft 6 in narrow-gauge line to transport goods, between Avissawella and Yatiyantota. During the narrow-gauge era, the line had its own fleet of narrow-gauge locomotives, where steam locomotives of Class K were used.The European planters in the Kelani Valley and Sabaragamuwa have been agitating for a railway line since the successful completion of the railway to Kandy, in 1867. This resulted in building the KV Line, at first from Colombo to Yatiyantota via Avissawella during 1900-1902. Avissawella is only 37 metres above sea level, but one gets a sense of being deep in Sri Lanka’s hill country. Its station is the terminus for the KV Line, although the train used to run to Opanayaka via Ratnapura, the city of gems. Now, we have to travel there by road.Avissavella is also an important town in the KV Line and an important junction station for the railway where the line from Colombo branched off to Yatiyantota and Opanayaka, which was extended up to Ratnapura, completed in 1912, and eventually extended to Opanayaka in 1919.The KV Line is Sri Lanka’s only narrow-gauge railway, a mere 76cm wide. A survivor of a more leisurely age, it was opened in 1912 up to Ratnapura, primarily to transport the Valley’s agricultural produce to Colombo by British planters. Since the transport of coffee, tea, rubber, cinnamon and coconut, then the main crops of the island, from the plantations around the Ratnapura and Kegalla districts to Colombo, for shipment to Britain took long, thereby adversely affecting the plantation industry, the colonial British planters wanted the railway.During the rule of British Governor Sir Henry McCallum (1907-1913), the KV railway line expanded up to Ratnapura having branched off from Avissawella as a narrow-gauge line to transport agricultural crops. Again, in 1912 the railway line was connected from Ratnapura town to Opanayaka, around 20 kilometres from Ratnapura, which was the terminus of the line.However, the main stretch from Fort to Opanayaka via Avissawella was shortened up to Ratnapura during WW11, by the British rulers due to the lack of revenues way back in 1947. Eventually, the Ratnapura to Avissawella track closed down in 1976. Subsequently, the line was further extended to Avissawella and finally to Homagama.The main reason for the extinction of the narrow-gauge railway was the lack of speedy operations due to the sharp regular curves along the line. Once again, the broad-gauge line from Colombo was introduced to the KV Line up to Avissawella, in 1993. Therailway line beyond was completely abandoned, and now the line from Avissawella to Yatiyantota and along the way to Opanayaka can only be traced by the remaining ruined stations, huge iron bridges, old telephone posts and stone arched-culverts. At present, the terminus railway station of Opanayaka has been housed at the Police Station of Opanayaka of the Sri Lanka Police Department and the old building is considered as a most exquisite ruined architectural monument within the Sabaragamuwa Province.The old railway station in the Ratnapura town was converted into the present bus stand in 1976.Although the old buildings of the railway station are still used with some modifications, the old grandeur of the railway station is still visible from the remaining old iron-roof with rounded iron [beams.To](http://beams.to/) view more monuments of a by gone era of the KV Line, we then stepped into the Railway Museum at the Sri Lanka Railway headquarters in Maradana which was the first railway station built in the country, before it was shifted to the Colombo Fort Station. It exhibits many railway items used in the past, especially, from the inception of the railway in the country, in 1865. At the museum, our attention was drawn to the items used in the KV Line such as, locomotive steam train engines, graders, jacks and old signal systems. It is a must-see place for those who wish to research on the old days of the railway system in Sri Lanka.

My wife was able to steam her milk, make some foam, and make a coffee using a ESE pod. The frustrating part was waiting for the steam and telling her when her steaming window was. It isn't like a normal machine where you can purge it for a second then have steady steam.

1kem8mx,https://www.reddit.com/r/privacy/comments/1kem8mx/extreme_coincidence/,Extreme coincidence?,"I'm cleaning my house today and got to our wooden coffee table, it's been through the ringer with my dog chewing on it, and it's been cleaned with harsh chemicals the entire time I've owned it. While cleaning it I THOUGHT to myself ""now he's not chewing, I can restore this table... Get some wood specific cleaner""  
  
So I've had WAN show (a podcast) on YT playing in the background on my phone while I clean. The podcast ended and I went to click on another when I got an advertisement for restorative chemicals for wood furniture.  
  
I have never, ever gotten these kinds of advertisements before, not once. Generally, it's all pet, music or computer related stuff (Mouser, Chewy, Sweetwater)  It's EXTREMELY eerie to me that a passing thought I've never had before manifested moments later as an advertisement on YT, directly after I had the thought and with absolutely no prior related search terms/cookies. I had considered restoring the table before - but have all the tools, stain and materials I need at home already. I've never searched anything relative to furniture restoration. Especially something as specific as the table I'll already fully equipped to repair.  
  
It seems farfetched and totally science fiction. But I've also heard this before from friends and colleagues. Usually there is some unmentioned factor like searching the stuff earlier, or audibly mentioning something. There was none of that. A momentary thought followed directly for an advertisement pertinent to that private thought.  
  
Rationalize this for me please because as asinine as it sounds, it clearly appears to me that my phone is now reading my thoughts...",3,1746371885.0,privacy,3,0.8,False

It's hard enough getting my 6 year old to focus on the craft and other stuff we are doing for her Mom. She was using a paint pen and decided to paint a broken heart on this sign thing we are making for her Mom. I had to tell her that a broken heart was bad, so she had to make it a filled in heart. She was not happy to change it.

With thay project done, we are now making a card for her teacher. It's fine, but she changes her sentences so often as she writes them, plus not listening when she asks me to spell words for her.

Don't get me started on the fact that it's yet another spirit week for Teacher's Appreciation Week, which we found out about on Thursday.

3 more weeks of school. Plus, since she's in Kindergarten, they are doing something special for each letter of the alphabet for the last 26 days of school...so it's like Spirit Month-and-a-half.

It’s my first time fasting longer than 36 hours (I did a few alternate day fasting) and it’s incredible how easy it’s been. I get moments of being light-headed but if I take a shot of electrolytes I’m good. I do put 2 tbs of unsweetened coconut milk in my massive thermos of coffee. It’s about 10cal for 5 cups of coffee but it means I can take my vitamins. I’m moving towards completely black coffee and to doing a 72 hour fast.

The most startling thing has been how I’m not hungry. I did a lunch meeting yesterday and was not tempted by the food that was there, even though everyone else was eating. I went to a trade show and a stall was giving out samples of sweetened nuts and I wasn’t tempted. I bought a couple of incredible homemade cookies and I’m excited to have them tomorrow with my meals, but I’m not tempted to have them now.

I’ve lost about 10 pounds in a bit more than two weeks, which is fast but I feel great. My stomach is definitely smaller. It’s incredible how much of a change this lifestyle makes.",10,1746371774.0,intermittentfasting,2,1.0,False
1kem6no,https://www.reddit.com/r/ANRelationship/comments/1kem6no/33_m4f_netherlands_nl_rotterdam_den_haag_the/,"33 [M4F] 🇳🇱 Netherlands (NL), Rotterdam / Den Haag (The Hague): seeking an intimate encounter, or something longer term 😊","**\*\* SCROLL DOWN FOR ENGLISH 🇬🇧 \*\***

🇳🇱 Misschien heb je pas net ontdekt dat het bestaat, of wist je al wat het is en was je er al naar op zoek: Adult Nursing Relationships (ANR) of Adult Breastfeeding (ABF), dus respectivelijk relaties of intieme ontmoetingen waarbij je borstvoeding geeft aan je partner.

Misschien klinkt het raar — aan een volwassen partner, echt?! — maar dat hoeft niet, vooral als jouw borsten belangrijk zijn voor jouw beleving van fysieke en emotionele intimiteit. Overigens is het niet strikt noodzakelijk dat je lacteert; het kan ook 'droog', de handeling is voor de rest uiteraard hetzelfde.

Ik weet al lang dat ANR/ABF iets is wat ik ik heel graag wil, ik wist al zelfs nog voordat ik wist dat het 'een ding' was. Alhoewel het voor mij natuurlijk een ware eer en voorrecht zou zijn om jouw moedermelk rechtstreeks van de bron te mogen proeven als je het voor me hebt — en ik ook wel bereid ben te helpen om het op te wekken als we daarvoor willen gaan — gaat het mij uiteindelijk niet per se om de melk zelf. Het gaat om de reis met jou; de intimiteit, binding, sensualiteit, rust en zaligheid die het geeft om op die manier met jou samen te zijn!

Dus, als jij een vrouw bent die ervan geniet als haar dames onverdeelde aandacht, liefde en verwennerij ontvangen, dan is dit misschien iets voor jou en wil ik het graag met je verkennen!🙂 Ik zelf voel me al vanaf vrijwel begin puberteit extreem aangetrokken tot borsten. Voor mij is weinig moment zo zalig als het moment dat ik de volheid en zachtheid van jouw borsten mag voelen in mijn handen, tegen mijn lijf, of in mijn mond ... masseren, kneden, zuigen, ik kan er letterlijk urenlang zonder onderbreking van genieten - jij hopelijk ook!

Voor de duidelijkheid, ik ben specifiek niet op zoek naar seks, en dus zie ik dit zeker ook zeker niet slechts als een soort achterdeur naar seks. Ik wil de fysieke intimiteit met jou écht verkennen via je borsten en ANR/ABF🤗

**Hoe ik het voor me zie:**

* Eerst chatten we een tijdje online, aanvankelijk hier in de reddit chat, maar daarna liefst overschakelen naar een ander platform zoals WhatsApp of Signal. Telegram is ook een optie als je je nummer nog niet wilt geven. Liever geen Skype; zoals laatst in het nieuws te lezen was, wordt Skype op 5 mei opgeheven.
* Daarna lijkt het me fijn om een keer een koffiedate te prikken of als je het leuk lijkt daarna een langere date. Als we een match zijn dan, dan kunnen we overgaan tot een reeks ontmoetingen, en als we echt een goede match zijn en er is een goede klik tussen ons buiten enkel het ANR/ABF-aspect, dan sta ik er zeker voor open om het verdere avontuur van dit leven met jou aan te gaan in een vaste relatie 🙂

**Over mij:**

* Leeftijd 33 jaar
* Lengte ong. 185 cm;
* Kort donkerblond haar;
* Rook niet;
* Geen vaste medicatie of medische aandoeningen;
* Mooie mannelijke, rustgevende, lage stem, hebben vrouwen mij wel eens verteld;
* MSc, fulltime baan als ingenieur in de elektrotechniek.
* Hobbies / interesses: wetenschap, (elektro)techniek, wiskunde, klussen, Inkscape, muziek (bespeel een aantal instrumenten), old school video spellen, fietsenmaken, hardlopen. Waarschijnlijk nog wel meer 😛
* Karakter: relaxed, nachtvlinder (van nature; voor mijn werk ben ik een vroege vogel geworden), droge humor, stabiel, introvert, nerderige type met een vleugje romantiek; wees niet verbaasd als ik de eerste keer bloemen voor je meeneem 💐🙂
* Ik woon zelfstandig. Mijn appartement is nog steeds vrij spartaans ingericht en niet alle kamers zijn gestoffeerd - er moet nog wel geklust worden - maar ik ben in staat jou hier te ontvangen!
* **Wat je van mij kunt verwachten:** ik communiceer pro-actief en neem initiatief. Ik reageer snel op berichten. Ik houd me aan afspraken en kom opdagen als we ergens afgesproken hebben. Ik respecteer alle grenzen die jij aangeeft; jouw 'nee' is voor mij ook NEE.

**Over jou:**

* Je geniet echt van fysieke intimiteit via je borsten;
* Waarover gesproken: het gaat mij niet om je cupmaat of welke vorm ze hebben. Het gaat er vooral om dat ze zin hebben om verwend te worden 😉
* Single of scheidende. Geen (stiekeme) affaires, geen drama, geen 'poly' constructies.
* Leeftijd: aller- alleruiterst 18-55 jaar. Kans op iets langdurigs is natuurlijk wel groter als je dichter in de buurt zijn van mijn leeftijd, zegge 26-35;
* Je bent een biologische vrouw, niet trans;
* Idealiter woon je in een plaats die in of vanuit de Randstad goed bereikbaar is met het OV (helaas geen auto). Antwerpen kan ook.
* **Wat ik van jou verwacht:** je reageert omdat je dit ook oprecht wilt proberen; je speelt geen spelletjes maar bent transparant over je intenties, je hebt geen andere agenda. Je ghost niet maar communiceert eerlijk als je twijfels hebt of het niet langer ziet zitten. Je komt met enige regelmaat online, of bent bereikbaar, en je reageert actief.

Als ik onaangekondigd 24 uur achter elkaar niets van jou verneem, of jij vertoont aanhoudend passief of ongeïnteresseerd gedrag, d.w.z. onredelijk trage of minimale reacties, dan beëindig ik ons contact.

 

🇬🇧 Perhaps you only just discovered that this is even a thing, or you already knew about it and have been seeking it for a while: Adult Nursing Relationships (ANR) or Adult Breastfeeding (ABF), i.e. respectively relationships or intimate encounters centered around breastfeeding your partner.

That might sound weird — breastfeeding an adult partner, really?! — but it really isn't, especially if your breasts are a powerful way for you to experience intimacy, emotional or physical. Also it is not required for you to be lactating, 'dry nursing' is also a perfectly valid way to go about ANR/ABF.

I have known for a very long time that ANR/ABF is something that I truly desire, even before I knew it was actually a 'thing'. Even though it would be an absolute pleasure and privilege to try your milk straight from the source if you are producing — and I would also absolutely be willing to help induce if that's where we take things — for me it is not about the milk. Rather, it's about our time and journey together; the intimacy, bonding, sensulaity, peace and bliss that being in the moment with a fine lady like yourself brings 😊

So, if you are a woman who enjoys her girls getting worshipped, spoiled and receiving my undivided attention, then this is something that I would love to explore with you!🙂 I have always felt a strong thing for women's breasts, ever since early puberty. For me there are few comparable moments that fill me with bliss and happiness as the moment I get to feel the fulness and softness of your bosoms in my hands, up against my body, or in my mouth ... massaging, kneading, suckling, ik can enjoy this for hours without break - and hopefully the same is true for you!

Just to be clear, **I am not looking for sex** and I am also definitely not one of those guys who sees this as a backdoor route to it. I want to explore the bliss and intimacy of ANR/ABF with you, focusing on your breasts, for its own sake 🤗

**How I envision this to go:**

* first we chat online for a while — initially here on Reddit in DMs, but preferably we switch to another platform such as WhatsApp or Signal. Telegram is also an option if you don't want to share your private phone number yet. Preferably no skype, as Microsoft have announced to discontinue Skype on May 5th.
* Then I would like to take you out on a coffee date or if you like a longer more elaborate date. If we are a match, then we can take this further into a more intimate setting, and if we are a really good match and there is good chemistry between thus beyond just the ABF aspect, then I am definitely willing to embark on a long term relationship with you and perhaps one day even tie the knot for good 🙂

**About me:**

* 33 years old
* Height: approximately 185 cm (approx. 6'1"" )
* Short, dark blond hair
* I do not smoke;
* No medical issues and take no regular drugs (DDF)
* Women have told me in the past I have a nice, soothing masculine voice;
* MSc degree, I work fulltime as an electrical engineer.
* Hobbies / interests: science, (electrical) engineering, maths, DIY'ing stuff, Inkscape, music (I play a few instruments), old school video games, fixing bikes, running/jogging. There's probably a few more I forgot to think of 😛
* Personality: laid back, night owl (by nature; for work I have had to become an early bird), dry humor, stable, introverted, loveable nerd with a romantic streak; do not be surprised if I bring you flowers the first time I see you 💐🙂
* I have my own place. My apartment is still fairly spartan as not all the rooms have gotten a floor yet - there is still some DIY'ing that needs to be done - but I am definitely able to host you here!
* **What you can expect from me:** I am a pro-active communicator and I take and show initiative. I respond to messages timely. I show up to dates and I keep promises. I respect any and every clearly communicated boundary you may have.

**About you:**

* You experience and enjoy physical and emotional intimacy through your breasts;
* Speaking of which: it is not important for me what size or shape they are, I do not obsess about your cup size. I care about them enjoying being worshipped and spoiled 😉
* You are actually single, or have already initiated divorce. No sneaky affairs, no drama, no 'poly' constructs. I am not out here looking to wreck homes or existing relationships.
* Age range: absolute limits are 18-55. Of course for something genuinely long term it would be better if you are close to me in age, say 26-35.
* You are a biological woman, i.e. not trans;
* Preferably you are located in a place that is easily reachable from the Randstad by public transport, or perhaps Antwerpen. Unfortunately I do not own a car;
* **What I expect from you:** be for real. If you reach out it's because you are actually interested in trying or doing this, you are not about playing games and having some hidden agenda, you are forthcoming about your intentions. You do not ghost but are honest about it if you are having second thoughts or have changed your mind. You are online and available to chat regularly, and you respond timely and consistently.

If you up and disappear unannounced in the middle of a back-and-forth conversation and you do not respond within 24 hours, then for the sake of protecting my own time I will assume you have ghosted me and I will move on. Likewise, if I sense low effort or a low interest attitude from you - minimal replies, passive reciprocation, unreasonably long response times - then I will also not hesitate to move on.",1,1746371742.0,ANRelationship,0,1.0,False

I've been feeling my heart beating for a few months now—sometimes irregularly—and I’ve constantly felt on edge. I tried many things to improve the arrhythmia (quitting coffee, exercising less, taking time off work), and they helped to some extent, but the symptoms always seem to come back after a while.

Today, I was experimenting with nasal breathing, and I think I did something different. I took a very deep breath through my nose, and it felt like the air reached somewhere it normally doesn't. It was like I hit a nerve—like I was really breathing for the first time in a long while and that my usal breath were shallow. It felt realy relaxing. I kept taking deep nasal breaths, and I felt much, much calmer.

Now I’m wondering—have I been breathing wrong all along? Could this be the cause of my condition? I’d really appreciate any insight or explanation into what might have happened.

Exactly 1 year ago, I met with two friends through hiking. After the hike we went for dinner and then desserts. We had a great time and we took each others phone numbers. 

Let’s call them Nancy and Suzy. Nancy and I became very close. We did hiking together, movie and game nights, and lots of things. I threw a nice birthday celebration for Nancy and we had a great time. Nancy forgot my birthday and I didn’t even get a “happy birthday” but I didn’t take it to heart and just didn’t say anything. 

Suzy and I kind of fell out of touch. I only remember maybe getting a text from her once in that year. 

Two days ago, I got a message from Nancy telling me it’s Suzy’s birthday and they are planning to celebrate and invited me. I got added into a group chat with them to plan for an outing. They planned to meet for dinner and then go for desserts. 

I told them that day I was coming from dinner with other friends so I wouldn’t want to go for another dinner but that I would meet them at the other place for desserts. 
I send a text in the group chat that I am heading to the place and “looking forward to seeing them soon” and Suzy leaves a heart emoji on the text. But then both of them texted about meeting at the dinner place (I only saw this when I got to the place for desserts already as I was driving). It seemed like a huge miscommunication. When I told them “hey guys I think there was a misunderstanding, I thought we were meeting at —- for desserts and I am already here lol” and then Nancy said “we are meeting at ——-, feel free to come hang with us and then we will go to —- after”

This sounds reasonable, right? But based on my experience with Nancy and Suzy, I am always the one compromising. It took me after the fact to realize what a doormat I am. Why am I going to celebrate someone’s birthday who I met only once in a year? Did this person even remember my birthday? 

I am a doormat. I am working on being less of a one. The first step to stop being a doormat is that I send a text in the group chat telling them “I had long day and have something later in the evening so I am heading back home. Will catch up with you guys later.” I drove nearby to a coffee shop and texted another friend and met him over some coffee instead.

By Someone Who's Been There, Done That, and Has the Receipts

---

A Word From Me:
I'm not a doctor. I'm not a certified nutritionist. I'm just someone who once weighed 281 pounds, got tired of being tired, and figured out what actually works for me, and for others I've helped.

This guide is based entirely on my lived experience, personal trial-and-error, and a no-fluff, boots-on-the-ground approach to losing weight through keto. If you're curious, struggling, or just sick of the same recycled advice, then maybe this will speak to you.

Disclaimer: This is not medical advice. Always consult a healthcare professional before making significant changes to your diet or lifestyle especially if you have existing health conditions.

If you're still with me, read on. I promise to keep it honest.

---

Part 1: The First Two Weeks The Furnace Ignites

- Keto works for men and women.
- It worked *faster* for me as a man due to muscle mass and biology, but women succeed too.
- I stuck to strict keto (under 50g of carbs/day), and the fat melted *fast*.
- I lost 8 lbs in the first week alone.

But here's the deal:
- I craved everything: bread, sugar, chips, pasta *everything.*
- I felt like I was sick. It's called the keto flu. It sucks.
- By the end of week one, my appetite dropped and the cravings dulled.
- Every day after week one was better.

This phase was brutal. It was also *crucial*. Once I pushed through it, I earned the right to keep going.

After the two-week mark and beyond:
My body started to feel *lighter* and it wasn't just in my head. If you've ever lifted 10 lbs, you know it's substantial, a solid heft. That's how much better my body felt every 10 lbs I lost.

If you want to understand it on an emotional level, try this: grab something that weighs 10 lbs and hold it straight out from your body. After a while, your muscles will burn. When you finally put it down, that burst of relief, that sudden freedom of movement, that's what my body felt internally every time I shed another 10.

Also, drink A LOT of water. Hydrate! Hydrate! Hydrate!
- Diet drinks are fine for a tasty treat, but nothing replaces water.
- I was consuming more sodium due to the restrictions, so hydration became even more important.
- Fun fact: Yes, coffee is keto friendly. And those sugar-free creamers? They taste just as good as the sugary syrups. No need to sacrifice flavor.

And a quick warning about labels:
Don't trust the ""net carbs"" trick. It's a trap. If it says 14 grams of carbs, then it's 14 grams of carbs. I don't play the subtract-the-fiber game. My results came from tracking total carbs not negotiating with the fine print.

---

Part 2: The Stall: Breaking the Metabolic Wall

- I weighed myself once a week, same time, same way.
- If my weight hadn't changed in two weeks, I knew I hit my first plateau.

Here's what I did:
- I DID NOT do a cheat day. That's a trap.
- Instead, I took advantage of my lower hunger.

For one week, I skipped either breakfast or dinner.
- I kept lunch consistent.
- I randomized which meal I skipped each day.
- I wasn't starving. I was fine.

By the end of the week:
- My weight started dropping again.
- Once it did, I returned to my normal routine.
- I rinsed and repeated this strategy at every stall.

Keto worked on its own, but for my health and my image, I knew exercise helped. I took advantage of my increased protein intake and started building muscle. When I aimed for strength, I lifted heavy. When I wanted a sleeker look, I focused on lean muscle routines. Movement accelerated my progress and shaped my outcome.

---

Part 3: The Final 10 to 20 - My Body's Last Stand

- The last 10 to 20 lbs fought me.
- My body got clingy. It wanted to keep the fat like it was prepping for the apocalypse.
- But I had momentum, strategy, and receipts.

I just kept doing what worked:
- I stuck to keto.
- I used the skip-a-meal tactic when the scale froze.
- I moved my body however I could.

I ignored the noise, the critics, and the this isn't healthy brigade.
I've lived it. I've felt the difference. And if it works for you?

That's what matters.

(WARNING: certified ESSAY post from a gifted rambler),"TL;DR: I am a 23M who has always struggled with relationships and never gotten past a first date. Recently, a woman that I graduated college with two years ago asked a mutual friend for my contact information and reached out to me. We hit it off and talked non-stop for days. She confessed she always had a crush on me in college and still did. I took her on an amazing casual date where we sat and talked for over four hours. She agreed to go on a second date and asked me for a third. The next day, she texted me saying she no longer wanted to see me. I reached out to her a week later for an explanation and she said she didn't have feelings for me. I am very bummed and cannot figure out why someone would come onto me so strongly only to pull the plug so soon. Is this a normal thing that happens in the dating scene now or am I overreacting by being dumbstruck here?

This is going to be long and rambling post, but I've always loved to write lol. There's some helpful context I need to add before I get into the actual story. I have always struggled with romantic relationships. Growing up, I (23M) was always more mature and serious than my peers (the ""old soul"" label was thrown around a lot) and that always placed me in an ""other"" category. Everyone has always suspected that I'm on the autistic spectrum, but I've never been formally diagnosed. I'm very high-functioning so I don't guess it really matters or is worth the effort. I was always fairly popular throughout school, but at the time I struggled a lot with confidence and self esteem. I made it through high school without ever actually dating, and that was a major source of stress for me. When I got to college, I vowed to make a change, and I got involved in lots of extracurricular clubs and activities that exposed me to new people. I had been diagnosed and treated for anxiety, and I had found my footing with regards to confidence and self image. But then COVID hit and derailed life as I knew it. I spent the next two semesters studying from home and returned to campus in the fall of 2023. At the time, I was studying for a bachelor's degree that would get me into professional school. I mostly kept my nose in my studies except for one failed attempt at dating a close friend I caught feelings for. I asked her on a date and she said yes, only to change her mind a day or two afterward. Later, she asked me for a second chance and we went on a casual dinner date we both enjoyed. After that, she oscillated between yes and no, basically keeping me on the hook without ever getting anywhere. That fiasco was a major setback for me, but I got over it eventually and we are cordial now. The result of me taking my time to get over things was that I graduated college also never having dated. At the time, I was pretty upset about that, but I figured I'd meet someone when I went back to school. That ended up not happening, and I entered the workforce. That brings us to the present day: I work 9-10 hours each day at a blue collar job that normally requires me to work six days a week. As a result, I have few opportunities to meet people and go on dates, so I've just been enjoying life as it happens and biding my time. If someone comes along that I like, great; and if not, so be it. I'm an introverted extrovert, so my loneliness is offset by my enjoyment of quiet time alone when I need it. I'm also a very content person, so I tend to be pretty happy-go-lucky regardless of what's going on. 

Now that I've rambled about the past, let me ramble about events that took place recently and are bothering me. About a month ago, I got a random Snapchat message from an old college buddy of mine named Luke\* (names changed for privacy). Luke was a grade behind me, but we had lots of classes together and became close. He's in professional school these days, and I hear from him every now and then. I hadn't talked to him in a good while, and I was even more surprised by the message he sent me: ""Hey, do you remember Brianna\* from undergrad? She's in professional school with me and your name came up. I think you two would make a cute couple, so I gave her your Snap."" Needless to say, I was floored. I noticed that she had added me right about the time I got his message, so I immediately hit the ground running and struck up a conversation with her. The conversation flowed very easily, and we talked all day long. By the end of the day, I asked for her number, and we started texting back and forth. Mind you, this wasn't just small talk, we were trading paragraphs back and forth for days and talking about all manner of things. We started talking on a Tuesday, and things went so well that I decided I needed to ask her on a casual date for that weekend. Before I could, she sent me a selfie (first time) on Thursday night with the classic ""hey"" caption. She asked me if I actually remembered her from undergraduate school or not; I told her I did and I always thought she was cool. In her next message, she explained she always had a crush on me but never did anything about it. I was elated and playfully asked her if she still did, and her reply was yes. She told me that she was the one who specifically asked Luke for my Snapchat because he told her I was still single. I have always been a very naïve and oblivious person when it comes to the signals that women give, but I considered this to be a clear green flag and escalation between us. I took that opportunity to tell her I'd had feelings for her back then too and asked her on the date, to which she agreed. Our plan was to meet for coffee at a café in her hometown, about 45 minutes away from me. We finished out the week talking nonstop as usual, and she told me several times how excited and nervous she was about our date. It goes without saying that I was over the moon and I wasn't super nervous or hesitant about meeting her because everything just felt natural. That Saturday, I took off from work and met her at the café for what I can only call an amazing date. We sat and talked for four hours nonstop; there were no breaks in the conversation, no phones in sight, and plenty of eye contact. It blew me away that I had found someone who could match my energy and vibe so easily. We had a ton in common, including what I consider to be core issues that can cause friction (religion, politics, etc.). I was actually the one who had to say I needed to leave because I knew she was taking time away from her studies to see me. She didn't really want to go, but she agreed she had things to do. Before we parted ways, I asked if she wanted to meet me for dinner next time. She enthusiastically agreed and then asked me if I wanted to go to an event with her in a couple weeks. So by the time I left the first date, I had dates two and three scheduled. We talked that evening and Sunday morning just like normal and I thought everything was going my way. 

Disaster struck around midday Sunday when she text me something along these lines: ""I really enjoyed talking with you yesterday, but I got overwhelmed on my drive home not because of anything you did. I'm so busy at school that I'm not ready for an exclusive commitment right now. I'm sorry and I hope you understand."" I was caught completely off guard and unprepared. I could not make sense of what she was saying because I hadn't asked her for or even alluded to an exclusive commitment. I sent her a reply explaining my disappointment and that I would have worked with her if she given me the chance. Her response was that I did nothing wrong and that I shouldn't blame myself. She reiterated that she felt bad and was sorry. I consulted my support system (parents, friends, etc) who provided about as many theories and as much advice as you could imagine. I averaged all their ideas into a plan of waiting a week and contacting her again. So a week later, after not speaking at all, I sent Brianna a text asking if I could call her at some point. She said yes and we spoke by phone that evening. I asked her about what was going on and told her I was pretty well dumbfounded. She explained that she realized that she didn't have enough time to support both a relationship and her studies. More importantly, she told me she didn't have feelings for me. I got the impression she didn't want to talk things over, so we kept the conversation very short and never elaborated why she no longer had feelings for me. I felt like a dagger had been turned in my gut. Why would she reach out to me after two years and put in so much effort only to tell me she suddenly no longer felt anything for me? Especially after our date went so well and we talked effortlessly for four hours. Why would she agree to go on a second date and ask me on a third only to pull the plug less than 24 hours later? Here I was, minding my own business when she fell into my life out of the blue and fell right back out just as quickly. I'm not mad at her because she let me down very easily and I think she's a great gal at heart. Throughout every interaction she has been respectful, kind, and classy. But in the same breath, I am tremendously disappointed and sad. This entire situation has come full circle because it has once again led me to ruminate on why I can't ever get past a first date. Once upon a time, I would have said it was because I wasn't worth a chance, but the new and improved me knows that isn't true. I have a wonderful family, a good job, a strong and interesting personality, plenty of hobbies, and a good head on my shoulders. If that isn't enough, I'm tall, well-built, well-groomed, and by most standards conventionally attractive. I honestly hated typing those last two sentences because, believe it or not, I'm very grounded and not arrogant. I'm laid-back, easy-going, and easy to talk to. I have a good wit and sense of humor, and I love being goofy when the situation allows, yet I can be serious when needed. I'm a Taurus and my stubbornness is offset by my practically self-destructive loyalty and protection of those I care about. I added all that detail that to support the point that I consider myself to be potential marriage material and someone who a woman would be proud to show off to her parents. Yet, apparently I'm not worth even a second date to someone who had a crush on me, looked me up, and confessed their feelings to me two years after the fact. I have always thought in the back of my mind that I had some critical flaw or damage that kept me from being successful in relationships. Years of effort trying to kick that belief from my mindset was erased by one woman who gave me every green flag possible right up until she decided she was done with me. I cannot figure out why she would come onto me so strongly and escalate the situation only to call it all off at a moment's notice. If she knew she didn't have time to date and didn't have feelings for me, why did she put on such a dog and pony show about having a crush on me? If that was even true (I have serious doubts), I'm still the same person I was back then if not even better. The entire situation has left me feeling very small and very used, and I feel like I'm missing something.

That's where you come in. If you have bothered to read all of this, I am curious to hear whatever you have to say, whether it be good or bad. Even if you think it's all my fault and I'm overreacting, say so because then I know there's something I can do better. Currently, my plan is to try and put all this behind me, taking what I've learned and applying it to the future. I'm going to get back to my treasured daily routines and basically weld shut the door to my comfort zone. My historically pessimistic attitude toward dating has been galvanized by the fact that I was treated this way by a woman I thought wouldn't play games with me. I truly think that we as a society have reached a point where both men and women treat the other sex recklessly and with zero care for the consequence of their actions.",0,1746371350.0,AmIOverreacting,5,0.5,False

I’m educated and work in a field with majority males ( don’t worry, not a tech bro) so I don’t interface women often. I’m 5’8, full head of hair and told that I’m handsome often.

I am ordering some MDF carcasses from these guys who are well reviewed: [https://thecabinetshop.co.uk/products/tall-single-carcass](https://thecabinetshop.co.uk/products/tall-single-carcass) and will then be adding internal shelves and doors myself.

I am not concerned about the 3 tall units to the right (600mm wide,2300 talll, 580 deep) .

However, the wide coffee station unit to the left (Width: 1200mm, Height: 2300mm, Depth: 580mm, 18mm plywood carcase) I'm concerned about warping and structure instability.   
  
The shelves highlighted in green will be 24mm plywood which is more rigid than MDF. All of this will be properly screwed in (rather than shelves on pins). I will be having extra legs underneath to support the bottom. If the top requires it, I will add hardwood batons across the top.

Will it work? Is there anything else I can do to prevent warping of shelves or instability?

They don't allow for a 1200mm wide unit in the configurator on their site, so I am asking them to custom make it (their mdf panels will allow for it and they do offer proper cupboard options with shelving etc of 1200mm wide elsewhere on their site). I'm hoping my above measures will be sufficient. 

Thanks for any advice in advance.

Nope. I grabbed a duplicate, as my now coffee-filled eyes are telling me. (Sigh.)  It's still a good dragon.

1kelplb,https://www.reddit.com/r/CoffeeMakerReviews/comments/1kelplb/does_the_hario_v60_pour_over_coffee_maker_review/,Does the Hario V60 Pour Over Coffee Maker Review Match the Hype?,"The **HARIO V60 Ceramic Pour Over Coffee Set, Size 02, White** is a coffee aficionado's dream and a gateway into the world of home brewing. As someone who deeply enjoys a good, rich cup of coffee every morning, I was thrilled to try out this pour-over coffee maker. The ceramic design, combined with the thoughtful inclusion of accessories like the coffee dripper, server, scoop, and the 100-pack of disposable paper filters, paints a picture of convenience and quality. This product promises to elevate your coffee game, whether you're a novice or a seasoned barista.

**Design and Build**  
The ceramic body of this coffee dripper oozes durability and elegance. Its glossy white finish looks impressive on any kitchen counter, blending seamlessly into various decor styles. Working with it daily, I couldn’t help but appreciate its lightweight yet sturdy feel. Despite frequent use, the ceramic material retained its pristine appearance. The cone-shaped design, often a hallmark of quality pour-over makers, ensures optimal water flow and even coffee saturation, which I found helped extract the full flavor of my beans. Being made in Japan, the craftsmanship speaks volumes, with every detail exuding precision.

**Ease of Use**  
Getting this setup going was a breeze. Everything you need is included—just supply your favorite coffee and hot water. I primarily used medium-fine grounds for brewing, and the results were phenomenal. The included scoop made portioning quick and easy, while the heatproof borosilicate glass server with BPA-free parts ensured the coffee stays at a pleasant temperature without adding any unwanted odors or flavors. Whether making one cup or brewing for a small group, the #2 coffee filter size addition came in handy, delivering up to four cups of coffee in one go.

**Flavor Quality**  
Brewing with the V60 is a sensory experience. As someone who geeks out over coffee flavor profiles, I immediately noticed how this method enhanced the delicate notes of my beans. The complete control over water flow allowed me to experiment. Light roasts came out bright, with fruity undertones, while dark roasts tasted rich and robust. This pour-over method clearly outshines traditional coffee makers in terms of flavor extraction, and I could genuinely taste the difference every morning.

**Key Benefits**  
- High-quality ceramic construction that ensures durability and elegance.  
- Includes everything needed to get started: filters, scoop, dripper, and server.  
- Its design promotes superior coffee flavor extraction.  

**Adverse Aspects**  
The number one issue I found was its learning curve. Though simple to use, beginners may find the process of perfecting the grind size and pour-over technique a bit daunting. Another minor hiccup was cleaning the ceramic dripper since residue tends to build up in the tiny ridges after daily use. Lastly, the disposable paper filters, while effective, may not align with everyone's environmental sustainability goals.  

- A slight learning curve may frustrate beginners.  
- Cleaning can be tricky due to the dripper's ribbed interior.  
- Disposable filters could be an environmental downside for some.

**Competing Products**  
When comparing the Hario V60 Ceramic Pour Over Coffee Set with competitors like the Chemex Classic Series or Kalita Wave, notable distinctions arise. The Chemex, with its all-in-one glass carafe and elegant design, offers a similar quality of brew but might feel bulkier. Meanwhile, the Kalita Wave is renowned for its flat bottom, which simplifies coffee extraction consistency compared to the V60’s cone design. Still, I found the V60 more versatile in letting me control my brew. Its durability also trumps some alternative plastic pour-over brewers. Where the Chemex might shine in hosting social gatherings, the compact and stylish V60 works better for regular, intricate brewing at home.

**Bang for the Buck**  
In terms of cost efficiency, this product delivers excellent value. Its quality craftsmanship, paired with the accessories included in the kit, ensures you won’t have to buy anything else to get started. While it might not suit those who prefer low-maintenance brewing methods, for the serious coffee enthusiast, this is money well spent. The savings become clear when considering how much you'd save by brewing café-quality coffee at home instead of hitting up coffee shops daily.

For example, I put a bit of coconut jelly bits (cubes or pearls with a tiny bit of its syrup), about 1-2 tablespoons of sour cherry juice, one shot of espresso, and either steamed or frothed milk. Normally I drink double shot mochas, but sour juice somehow enhances the coffee flavor. For the past couple weeks I drink nothing but mixed drinks like these (Caftails?).

Been about a month. I need some outside perspective please on how I should retrospectively look at the relationship.

  
I have posted before about this. I am a 34M doctor. I earn £150,000+. I am single, have my own (large) house). I couldn't drive at the start of the relationship but learnt to. I now own a £100,000+ car. I don't go out that often, very loyal and sensible. I come from a working class but very supportive family where my parents are together. I have a large, extending, loving family.

  
My ex-gf is twice divorced, has 2 children so a single mum, earned £35,000-50,000 a year, initially drove a very modest small car but upgraded to a Tesla during the relationship - probably around £30,000 and is from Ukraine. Her parents are divorced, she never sees her dad and her brother is a drug addict in a different country. She has a huge net of friends who seem to come in and out of her life alongside a few very stable and rich friends who sometimes buy her holidays. 

  
We started dating 2 years ago. The chemistry was amazing both in conversation and sexually. We would do activities and feel like soul mates such as cooking. 

For the entire relationship, I paid for everything. I spent over £40,000 during the relationship including all dinners, all drinks, all activities, all day trips and two holidays abroad (costing £3,000-£4,000 each). I also sometimes helped her pay for the odd car repair. For her birthdays I always spend 2-4x the amount she did on me. I also paid for every activity we did with her and her children (Alton towers, fire works, theme parks)  and I organised all of them. 

She really did feel like a soul mate at times. For the first year, it was a fairly magical relationship in my mind. The cost was difficult but in my mind I couldn't drive at the time so she'd travel 55 minutes to see me, stay at my place for 2-3 days and I'd pay for everything (food, restaurants, spas , gym passes etc.). 

Sadly in the last year of our relationship - everything fell apart. I had to be more sensible with money for a few months as my earns got reduced by 80% temporarily. This made me a lot more cautious generally. Something she didn't really appreciate or recognise. I still paid for everything and despite this difficulty still pair for two holidays. 

When on our first holiday, she paid for absolutely nothing, despite me asking her if she'd even get the odd drink of cab ride just to make things feel more natural. At the time she said she couldn't afford it but a few months down the line, she got a new Tesla etc and would still get her hairs and nails done.

Our breakup was because she felt:

1. I did not take responsibility 

2. She became very jealous after I did pass my driving test in the last 6 months of the relationship 

3. I wasn't present enough in her life

4. She dropped driving to see me 

She was also very demanding - she said I needed to buy her a £500 coffee machine at my house and it's the least I could do to make her comfortable. However I always tried to make her comfortable and I did buy the coffee machine. I used buy her lobster, smoked salmon, oysters, crab steak on a weekly basis - fairly expensive foods. These aren't foods I'd normally buy or that I know my friends eat all the time. 

  
She did eventually see a therapist - who told she was an abuser in the relationship and she was a narcissist. When she told me this, she recognised I could be causing her pain but if she broke up with me, it wouldn't help her (she didn't care what it'd do to me).

I started physically and mentally neglecting myself. I went from a doctor who had a six pack and would dress with a suit, shirt and glasses to someone genuinely dressing like an old depressed dad. My family got quite concerned.- I would wear trainers, odd socks, a Christmas jumper and whatever chinos I could find. It was strange. I stopped training.

Financially I stopped buying or eating foods Monday to Wednesday which were nice - as I knew she'd come on Wednesday or Thursday and stay until Saturday. I thought it was better to save my money for those days. 

  
There were so many Beautoful moments with her - on the beach, water park, being intimate together - but I can't help but feel when reflecting on this - in retrospect I should probably.not have a warm regretful feeling about it but take it for what it was - financial abuse and an affection built off of materialistic desire.... or shall I think differently? 

  
I am very wary that her therapist was probably right. I was probably abused by a narcissist. I was so stupid to not see it during the relationship. I am still utterly shocked she told me to my face when we were together she is the abuser and narcism and I hugged her, consoled her and kissed her rather than thinking about my own well being. 

  
There are so many signs of what she did which felt demeaning to me. as a fully qualified doctor high earning, she told me:

1. I had to earn more money to support a family and should feel the pressure of it

2. Even though her children loved and adored how I played with them, she demeaned it as 'they must see you as a friend' (I am really good with kids as I had a lot of little cousins) 

3. With my car, she would demean and say it feels uncomfortably (it's a Mercedes S-class!). She seemed to have a genuinely jealousy for it. This was highlighted when she phoned me last week and.I was trying to give her back her stuff - she said a phrase which was weird 'you said you'd never drive your beautiful car into the city' - something I'd never say. 

4. She'd tell me her priority should be making her happy and buying her things

5. She'd sometimes mention her ex or other people who have husbands or partners who pay for even more things

6. She'd be little me about not being able to drive - then once I did, she tried to push me to drive to places or destinations when I;'d just passed my test and wasn't confident - within a month.I was confident and driving everywhere

7. Whenever I did something, she'd compare it to something bigger. I'd spend £3,000 on a holiday in Greece - she'd get there and say how she'd love to me in France. 

8. Nothing in my house was good enough for her. I have a large house nearly £800,000 in value. She has a very small modest house worth around £250,000. My dining table is huge, overlooks a nice window and is great for working. She'd say it's not nice enough, there is no space to work. Despite my house being 4x the size of hers and having ample working spaces and desks larger than most people's dining tables. This isn't me boasting but I found it frustrating how she was never happy or satisfied. 

9. She would lie and say I only saw her kids every 6 months. This wasn't true. |I bought them birthday presents., Christmas presents, I';d even buy the other child presents on the other child's birthday sop they didn't feel left out, I let them stay at my house, have BBQ, water fights, I'd buy them small gifts, I'd spend time and play with them during social gathers rather than talk to the adults, do homework with them, FaceTime them, play on Roblox with them (which was mind numbklingly boring), I took them to fire works, alton towers, activity parks, the park, I babysat one of them. I'd let them put makeup on me - and for all of this, I got 'they see you as a friend but not an adult'. 

During the entire relationship she critiqued a lot about me. I never once critiqued her or demanded ANYTHING of her. 

The stumbling block and the big reality check I got was - she booked a holiday with her and her friend. Without me. Without asking or telling me. When I told her I felt it was unfair given she could have financially contributed a little for our third holiday - she said she booked the holiday because she'd brought it up and I didn't mention anything. She also said my response was wrong. The right response was 'I am happy for you, here is some spending money, and next month let me book a holiday for the both of us'. 

This coincided with my granddad falling sick. The week after she came back from her holiday with her friend, she went Bachata dancing in my city. She texted me she was in the city but didn't come to my house. At the time I was with my granddad. It was his final day on the earth and he died at 1:30AM. She texted me, annoyed I didn't pay for a taxi for to go from the city to my house. She said that was the only way she'd visit me in this situation. When I told her via text my granddad had died - she said 'sorry for your loss and I send my condolscences to your family'. No phone call... no asking how I am feeling.. no apologising to make me feel slightly better - just a text which a work colleague would send. The next day, she didn't reach out to me. I had to phone her to try and mend things but its at this point I realised she isn't there for me like I would have been for her in that situation. 

I did speak to her post breakup and she said she needs to 'accept me for who I am which is someone who doesn't want to take responsibility' and she refused to see me in person (she broke up over the phone after a 2 year relationship). I found this very demeaning given my financial commitment and my understanding of taking on a woman with 2 children despite my situation. 

I'll be honest. I did really love her and I have limited relationship experience so a deep affection for her. However, everyone is telling me she was a narcccist, a user and I need to reflect upon her with reality and not my misguided heart. Any thoughts and reality checks? 

I know my family are worried I'll eventually go back to her or leave the door open. I know my dad revealed he found the bag of baby toys I'd bough them for Christmas last December. He went home and cried that I was in the process of throwing away my life, dating a single mum and taking on two children when I was the apple of their eye in our family and so successful. He said as a father, it broke him and tore him apart for months but he never told me as he knew I was very loyal and devoted to her. 

 Is this something I need to firmly close and only think about with brutal realism and not affection? Do I need to just throw her stuff int he bin if she refused to pick it up? 

I have trusted my heart for the last 2 years. I don't think I can continue to do it. It's misguided in some way as even typing this - I realise how stupid I've been. Do I need to reflect on the relationship and her as what she is? And if so, what do you think she is?

  
This is a 100% accurate representation of the relationship by the way. I have used complete facts. The reason I bring up money and the sums of money is because they were not insignificant and the activities I did with the kids were not either. ",2,1746370098.0,relationship_advice,17,0.75,False

I went last year and it's an awesome space for people in music, design, tech, visual art (and pretty much any line of work-- I'm a massage therapist and found it so helpful) to connect, get ideas, and learn something useful for your creative business or side hustle. Also, the tickets include food (like good, catered full-meal kinda food) and coffee all day.

**Also, a bonus:** The night before (Wed, May 7) there’s a free kickoff event called **First Strike** at Stoke Co-Working. It’s a panel discussion with local creative leaders talking about Denton’s creative economy, challenges, and how to grow in this kind of city. Super casual and a good chance to meet people doing cool stuff here.

I know Reddit’s not always the easiest place to find something real, but figured I’d put this out there for the people looking for a bit more than the standard experience with these things.



I’m 28, based in the UK, and no, I don’t typically say ‘right, what’s all this then?’ If that meme or trend is a mystery to you, just ignore my nonsense. I’m not expecting immediate replies. Life gets busy. But it’d be great to find something that flows. Something genuine, and maybe even something we actually look forward to. Sadly rare these days, I feel.



I’m a massive reader, mostly fiction, especially after work when I just wanna switch off and drift into another world. I keep meaning to get back into reading history, but I’ve been saying that for ages now. Still waiting on it to happen. 😀 Thankfully, Sabaton, who I’m seeing later this year, is keeping my love for history alive and kicking. That gig’s going to be an amazing experience. If you’re into unique genre interpretations, interested in history, or just like great music, I’d thoroughly recommend them.



Currently reading something fun which I probably shouldn’t admit to enjoying as much as I am. If you’re curious, feel free to ask. I might tell you, if you ask nicely. Or take a guess if you’re feeling bold. Got one of your own? Book, film, playlist?



When I’m not buried in a book, I’m usually out running. I got into it pretty impulsively and now I seem to have joined the running cult. I’m not above posting my Strava stats on Insta, but I’m definitely not cool enough for the curated fitness reel life. My feed is mostly race clips, questionable running tips, and scenic routes I’d love to try, ideally ones that end with good coffee. I’ve always loved London. Even more so now I ran my first marathon there recently. Still feels surreal saying that! A good coffee or pub is definitely a part of the running cult I’m more than happy to enjoy.



As a self-confessed running cult member, I feel like you should reciprocate the baring of my soul. What cult are you a part of? 🤣



I’ve rambled on, but honestly, I love getting to know people. The small things, the deep things, the random in-between bits that make someone them. I genuinely enjoy listening and learning about people beyond the surface. That’s the kind of connection I’m most drawn to.



If you’re into books, running, voice notes, late-night tangents, the kind of chats that start off light and before you know it, end somewhere unexpectedly lovely, or you’re up for building a connection with someone equally invested in doing so, say hi. I’m always up for proper conversation, whether it leads to a solid friendship or something with a bit of spark.



If you’ve got a book or series that will completely consume me, or running tips which don’t involve building a shoe rotation worth the moon, I’m all ears.



Wow, you made it to the end. Clearly we already have stamina in common. 🙂",0,1746369826.0,MeetPeople,0,0.5,False

As my last child is set to graduate from highschool soon my loneliness has increased greatly, because I find myself alone more.  I make plans to spend time with my parents and grown children every week.  I’ve joined a griefshare group.  I’ve gone to Bible studies.  I meet a friend for walks or coffee regularly.  I go for runs.  I attend church every week.  It never seems enough.  
   As I was taking a few minutes to journal about how I was feeling this morning it dawned on me.  My wife was not very healthy and especially over the last several years of her life she was mostly confined to bed.  I was constantly caring for her and my children, running kids to soccer or school.  Most moments of my day were filled with activities.  Now my wife is gone, my two older are on their own.  My youngest needs me less and is often gone.  
     It only makes sense I’m depressed and lonely even if I strive to fill my days with activities.  Today I picked up a book about prayer that I have owned but never read.  It’s time I try to find more meaning in life.  I may better acknowledge why I experience so much anxiety about being alone and I see opportunities for improvement, but putting into practice what I’ve learned is the challenge.  Can I find meaning alone and be comfortable by myself?

I buy beans from other good roasters like 94 Celcius, Dak, and Hatch all the time, and never ever ever have seen something so bad.

1kelegv,https://www.reddit.com/r/shortstories/comments/1kelegv/rf_fomo/,[RF] FOMO,"He lives a life of guilt.

Not an overwhelming guilt. The kind that haunts you in the aftermath of depravity or debauchery resolves over time as you are further and further removed from your actions. But rather, his is a pervasive guilt. A constant hum underneath the reverberations of everyday life. Low enough that it can be shoved to the peripheral, temporarily ignored. Nevertheless it's always there, eating his life as it monitors his decisions. The voyeuristic sadist in his mind chips away, piece by piece, sculpting him into a misshapen ghoul- a specter of his younger self.

Even now as he sits, watching TV, ostensibly relaxing after dinner and a hard day at work. He tells himself he is “spending time” with his wife, “recovering” from the day, and that he has “earned” the break.

But he knows he could be doing something more consequential with her. They could play cards, or chess like they used to. Back when they were first dating, they would cook together, play games, and go for walks. He should be doing that! Not sitting in a chair next to her on the sofa. He glances over at her as she scrolls on her phone, then turns his attention back to the TV. The host is interviewing a singer who is about to perform, but first they will show a montage about her difficult life.

He hears the hum of guilt under the sad music on the TV.

What would his forefathers think? They knew hard work. His job is cushy by comparison. He doesn’t have any kids and they had large families to raise! His whole generation is soft. Knows nothing of their hardships. Who is he to claim he’s “earned” this rest; that he “deserves” a break? What a muffin he is!

He wants a beer. In fact, he knows he is going to get one. He plays this game with himself most nights. He’s full from dinner, so he sits and waits as the television lights dance across his eyes. The detectives quipping over dead extras, brilliant misunderstood doctors solving impossible cases, and reality TV stars creating drama. If he watches long enough, the feeling of being full will subside and he’ll pretend to wrestle with the decision of whether or not to grab a beer.

“He really shouldn’t,” the angel on his shoulder makes a case for the kangaroo court over which his willpower presides. He has gained too much weight. He skipped exercise again this evening because he was too tired. He listened to that podcast that explained how you don’t get quality rest even when you’ve had just one beer. And after all, isn’t feeling tired the root cause of his problem? Why make things worse with alcohol?

The argument is good- both valid and sound. Still he knows it won’t affect the outcome. Once his satiation subsides, he’ll pause the show and head for the fridge. “No snacks tonight though,” the angel tries to save face. “Sustained,” his willpower agrees before calling an end to the hearing.

But really, maybe he shouldn’t. He’s had a tightness in his chest lately. It’s on the left side, by his heart. He knows it is likely the anxiety that builds up from the stress of work, financial strain- and the constant guilt. But he fears that maybe, just maybe it is a heart attack lying in wait. Peering out from the bushes behind his ribcage, just waiting for the opportune time to pounce.

Maybe the guilt is good. Sure it doesn’t feel good, but it has a point doesn’t it? What’s wrong with focusing on self-improvement? He should get out more, find a hobby, talk to his wife, join a local recreation team- maybe bowling or pickleball! Maybe the guilt is telling him there is more to life than work, beer, and television. The show is boring anyway. There’s no time like the present to make a change. Seize the day! The time is now!

He looks over to his wife, a renewed spark in his eye. She scrolls on her phone, not even aware of the story on their shared screen.

“We should do something,” he declares, catching her attention.

Without looking up, she shrugs, “Meh, I’m OK. Maybe tomorrow.”

“OK.” Tomorrow sounds good.

He turns back to the show; the internal hum ramps up a notch. He shouldn’t have put her on the spot like that. He shouldn’t make his needs her problem. The good news is, he doesn’t feel so full anymore.

Without pausing the show, he heads to the kitchen and cracks a beer. “You want anything?” he calls to her, grabbing a handful of peanuts from the cupboard, “OK, but just a handful, not the whole container,” the angel scolds.

From the living room she responds, “I’m OK.” The sound from the TV stops. She has paused it for him. So sweet.

“You didn’t have to pause, I could hear it,” he sets down his can on the coffee table and reaches for the remote.

Tell me your thoughts on this idea. Im going to take an educated guess in that the consumption of coffee and tea will soon no longer prohibit people from the waters or baptism. My guess is, however, this will not be a church wide allowance (I may be wrong with this part). There are a lot of people internationally, who want to become members. Yet, due to our customs here in the US, they are prohibited from baptism. The church wants to keep growing in these poorer nations while it stagnates and numbers drop in the US, Canada, and most of Europe. I think the church is going to develop a more flexible Word of Wisdom depending on various regions and local customs.  My guess is that this will be implemented after Neilson’s reign. 

With this thought experiment, maybe the Law of Chastity will change too depending on regional values and laws. For example, living with a long term partner without a marriage certificate may be overlooked when deciding  baptismal eligibility. Where I went on my mission, this was frequently a reason why many people couldn’t get baptized. The local laws made it so hard for people to get married and if divorce were ever an issue, there were major troubles for them. By not getting married, they were protecting themselves from future headaches. 

I know the church is growing a lot in the continent of Africa. South America has also grown a lot but with little retention. These changes will probably allow those who have been prohibited from becoming members, or staying in good standing, feel more welcome.


TLDR: The church wants more growth which equals more money. By becoming flexible with WoW and LoC in various regions throughout the world, they may be able to achieve their goal of getting a bigger church with consistent tithing.

I'm posting from an alt account as the ex has me on edge.

Aussie male, mid forties. Wife left me a few months ago. I'd describe the personal hell that followed, but I'm sure many of you are familiar with that freight train of emotions.

One acutely lonely night I posted on Reddit, asking about what the future looked like. Amongst the gallery of replies was a supportive one from an Australian woman from the other side of the country. For narrative brevity I'll call her Bunny.

Bunny followed up with a very sweet DM and we started a conversation about our experiences. This conversation went for two days until she felt brave enough to send me her number. It came with a warning - *""if you're a creep I'll block you""*.

Over the weeks that followed an organic connection grew. We texted like a couple of high school besties. It turned out we were of similar age and in the throes of divorce. We became each other's support person. Sadness gave way to optimism.

Texts became phone calls, and eventually Face Time calls. Conversation turned a little flirty. Then a lot flirty. It became clear we liked each other, even if the timing was terrible.

Over Easter, while the kids were with their mother, Bunny flew to my home town. At the airport initial nerves of meeting face to face quickly faded. The connection in person was strong. 

What followed was a magical long weekend. We went on a date. We got coffee. We made love. We chatted for hours. She even met my parents, who adored her.

Since then we have chatted every day, sometimes for hours. More trips are already planned.

Neither of us knows where this journey will take us. We both recognise we are vulnerable and have unfinished business. However, we also know that as we walk our paths we don't have to walk them alone.

Anyway that's my story. Mods, I am happy to provide evidence if there is any question of my credibility.",60,1746369476.0,Divorce,28,0.97,False
1kelaeq,https://www.reddit.com/r/CoffeeBrewerReviews/comments/1kelaeq/should_you_buy_the_strata_cups_camera_lens_coffee/,Should You Buy the STRATA CUPS Camera Lens Coffee Mug? Read This Review,"Using the STRATA CUPS Camera Lens Coffee Mug - B01N1WYQYT has been an interesting experience for someone like me who treasures quirky and functional items in their day-to-day routine. This is a unique coffee mug that doubles as both a conversation starter and a dependable travel cup, with strengths and limitations that might make or break the deal depending on what you're after.

**Design and Aesthetics**  
The first thing that caught my eye was how astonishingly realistic the coffee mug looks – it’s designed as an exact replica of a camera lens! As someone who comes from a family of photographers, this mug elicited awe-filled reactions when I passed it around during family brunch. The retro design matched the photography theme seamlessly. The attention to detail is remarkable, from the precision of the lens-inspired rings to the dual lid options. Every photography enthusiast in my circle couldn’t resist picking it up and inspecting it closely. While it’s a creative addition to any photographer’s collection, its compact build (measuring around 3.7""W x 7.3""H) also means it’s lightweight and portable enough to take on the go.  

**Functionality and Insulation**  
The stainless steel interior with vacuum insulation works well to maintain the temperature of your drinks. Whether it’s coffee or iced tea, the practicality of this mug stood out during my testing. I poured a hot cappuccino, and an hour later, it was still warm enough to enjoy. For cold beverages, the mug kept my iced soda cool without losing its fizz. The screw-on no-spill lid lives up to its promise of preventing messy spills, even when I hurriedly placed it in my car’s cup holder. However, when using the sipper lid, I noticed a slight reduction in hot beverage retention compared to the sealed lids.

[Check STRATA CUPS B01N1WYQYT price on Amazon.](https://idealcoffeeshop.com/price/b01n1wyqyt/)

**Accessories and Added Features**  
The mug comes with a variety of thoughtful add-ons, including not one but two lids – a retractable sipper lid and a fully sealed camera lens replica lid – as well as a carrying bag and a stainless steel spoon. I tried out each lid depending on the situation; the sealed lid worked wonderfully for rough commutes while the sipper lid made casual coffee breaks at my desk more convenient. The addition of a small, lightweight spoon is a nice touch although it feels a bit flimsy and seems prone to bending under pressure. The included carry bag, while not a necessity, made gifting the mug super convenient – it felt like a ready-made present for someone special.

**Usage Versatility**  
Even for non-coffee drinkers, this mug holds promise. I’ve used it for smoothies, green tea, and even as a cheeky desk organizer for pens. One of my office colleagues decided they don’t even want to drink from it because it doubles as a fun and practical storage solution for small items on their desk. Its quirky design seems to inspire versatility beyond just being a coffee mug, making it a fun addition to the workspace or kitchen alike.

**Advantages**  
- Realistically replicates a camera lens, making it an ideal gift for photography enthusiasts.
- Sturdy, vacuum-insulated construction keeps hot drinks warm and cold drinks chilled for a decent timeframe.
- Includes two lids (sipper and sealed) for both routine and spill-proof travel.
- Compact, lightweight build ensures portability.
- Comes with thoughtful accessories such as a spoon and a carry bag.

**Critiques**  
- Limited capacity (around 13.5 oz) might not satisfy those with larger beverage habits.  
- Prone to slight leaks if the sealed lid is tilted, although it’s far from disastrous.  
- Rubber grips might require frequent attention for cleaning, as they sometimes trap residue between crevices.  
- Hand-washing is recommended, which could be annoying for those reliant on dishwashers.  

**Competing Products**  
Compared to other novelty coffee mugs of its kind, this product outshines others with its dual insulation and attention to detail. I’ve previously owned a quirky donut-shaped mug, but that lacked the functionality this one brings to the table. There are competing brands with similar photography-themed drinkware, but many fail to include dual lids, a stainless steel lining, or additional accessories. Still, if keeping large quantities of beverages hot is your priority, you might opt for something like a Thermos travel mug instead.

**Affordable Quality**  
Looking at the build quality and bonus items, I’d say this mug offers solid value for its price bracket. While you could find cheaper options in the novelty gift category, they might not provide the same insulation or unique design elements. Its durable materials paired with its clever aesthetic make it field-ready for anyone who values lighthearted design without sacrificing reliability.

My mood was a mess, a real grumpy stew,

With energy low, feeling totally blue.

I'd tripped on my shoelaces, spilled coffee galore,

Then stubbed my pink toe right smack on the door!

My brain was a hamster on a runaway wheel,

Just spinning and spinning, how awful I'd feel!

I heard a wise whisper, ""Just go touch the ground!""

But my sofa was comfy, no green to be found.

""Grounding?"" I scoffed, ""Is that even a thing?

Will it make my sad, weary heart want to sing?""

The stress was a mountain, the fear a big wave,

My ""chill"" attitude, I just couldn't save.

My aura was grey, like a sock in the wash,

My patience was thinner than cheap paper gosh!

Then I thought of that shower, the water so grand,

A visual washing, held tight in my hand!

I closed my eyes tightly, envisioned the drain,

And negativity swirling, like dirt in the rain!

The anger, the worry, the feeling of dread,

All whooshing and swirling right out of my head!

Poof! Went the bad vibes, a comical sound,

As I stood in my bathroom, completely unbound!

My toes started wiggling, a curious sign,

My mood did a flip-flop, it felt quite divine!

No longer a grump-lump, a stress-laden heap,

My spirit awakened from its terrible sleep!

So kick off your slippers, or step in the spray,

And ground all that nonsense, starting today!

For a brain full of static, a heart in a funk,

Needs grounding to ditch all that emotional junk!

Don't be a lost balloon, drifting aimlessly high,

Connect to the Earth, reach for the sky!

It's simple, it's silly, it might seem absurd,

But grounding's the best mood-boosting word!

So try it, dear friends, what have you to lose?

Except all the bad vibes you really should choose

To send on their way, with a laugh and a cheer,

Grounding's the answer, let's make it quite clear!

From this very moment, let's promise to try,

To ground all our troubles, and let our hearts fly!

Hey there, so I moved to Norfolk from the Oceanfront in July and for the most part, I prefer it out here. The one thing I can't seem to find is a coffee shop I love. I'm a big ""special little drink"" person when I need to get tasks done on the weekend, so not having one that I'm excited about has been making it harder. 

When I lived at the oceanfront, I went to Bad Ass Coffee at least weekly. I usually got a blended mocha with raspberry syrup and it is like a coffee milkshake. It was a $10 coffee with the extra shot I would get and still so worth it, its delicious. Plus, they have amazing pastries (the blueberry coffeecake is my favorite) and the other food is really good too.

I've tried a few (Equinox, Coalescence, Kobros, Cure, Zekes, a few others) and none of them are bad, just not what I'm looking for all in one. They either have good food, good smoothies, good coffee (but usually very craft, simple coffee which I do enjoy but ""special little drink"" time is for something I can't make at home) 

So far, the closest I've found is Cure. They have some very good food options, pastries, and the lavender mocha latte was great. (I got the horsey ham-wich and a coffee cake) Also a big fan of the vibe. My main gripe, if you can even call it that, is that they don't have blended drinks, and I prefer those to iced (I'm a slow drinker so the ice waters the drink down vs a blended that just becomes a bit melty) and the food was a bit pricey ($10 for a breakfast sandwich with no side. It was really good but it's more of an every once in a while thing than a weekend motivation at that price/portion. Like I said, I used to spend $10 just on the large blended coffee at Bad Ass, its less about price than value)

So, in summary, I'm looking for recommendations on a place that ideally has good blended coffee drinks or at the least a good ""interesting latte selection"", has good pastries but also some decent food options when I'm looking for something more substantial, and isn't too bad price wise/the portions match the price.

1kel5vz,https://i.redd.it/yodfw5srzrye1.png,How to Properly Welcome Your Santa Muerte Statue (Including Color Meanings),"**You just received or made your first Santa Muerte statue — now what?**  
This guide walks you through a respectful **first ceremony** to welcome Santa Muerte into your home. Whether your statue is white, black, red, or rainbow, we’ll also cover how different **colors carry different energies** and how you can reflect that in your offerings.

# Why a Ceremony Is Important

Santa Muerte is more than a statue — she is a sacred spiritual presence. A simple ritual of welcome shows devotion, invites her energy properly, and begins your bond on the right foot.

# What You’ll Need:

* Your **Santa Muerte statue** (any color)
* A **white candle** (universal and safe for first use)
* **A glass of water**
* **Incense** (copal, frankincense, or sandalwood preferred)
* Optional: Flowers, apples, candy, tobacco, coins, or tequila — based on her color (see below)

# The General Ceremony Steps:

# 1. Cleanse the Statue

* Gently clean with water + a drop of Florida water, rose water, or salt water.
* This clears energy from shipping or handling.

# 2. Place Her in a Sacred Spot

* Choose a peaceful, respectful location — not the floor or near trash.
* Many use a small table, shelf, or box as an altar.

# 3. Light the Candle and Incense

* Light your candle and incense.
* Say something simple like: *“Santísima Muerte, I welcome you with respect and gratitude. Please bless this home with your protection and presence.”*

# 4. Offer Water and Symbolic Gifts

* Place a glass of water in front of her.
* Add offerings that reflect the **color of your statue** (see below).

# 5. Speak to Her

* Speak from the heart. Ask for guidance, protection, or whatever is on your mind.
* She does not demand perfection — just sincerity and respect.

# Color-Specific Notes for the Ceremony:

# White Santa Muerte – Purity, protection, peace

* Great for all-purpose beginners.
* Offer: White candle, white flowers, milk, rice, sugar.

# Black Santa Muerte – Justice, protection from enemies, banishment

* For defense, shadow work, and deep respect.
* Offer: Black candle, tobacco, burned cinnamon, coffee, obsidian.

# Red Santa Muerte – Love, emotional strength, passion

* For relationships, heartbreak healing, and sexual empowerment.
* Offer: Red candle, rose petals, apples, wine, honey.

# Gold/Yellow Santa Muerte – Money, success, business blessings

* For prosperity and breaking financial cycles.
* Offer: Coins, bills, tequila, cinnamon, yellow candle.

# Green Santa Muerte – Health, legal matters, growth

* For recovery, justice, balance.
* Offer: Green candle, bay leaves, herbs, green apples.

# Blue Santa Muerte – Peace, calm, communication

* For emotional healing, public speaking, or family peace.
* Offer: Blue candle, lavender, mint, sea salt.

# Purple Santa Muerte – Transformation, intuition, spiritual growth

* For those doing deep spiritual or psychic work.
* Offer: Purple candle, amethyst, sage, violet flowers.

# Brown Santa Muerte – Stability, legal fairness, home grounding

* For justice, resolving disputes, or improving your home’s energy.
* Offer: Brown candle, bread, soil, wood carvings.

# Rainbow Santa Muerte – All-purpose blessings, balance

* Honors all aspects of her.
* Offer: Multicolored candle, sweets, rainbow roses, mixed offerings.

# After the Ceremony

* Let the candle burn safely or snuff it respectfully.
* Refresh her water every few days.
* You can now begin praying, leaving petitions, and building your altar.

**Final Words:**  
Don’t worry about being perfect — Santa Muerte accepts honest devotion. Start simple. She sees your heart and walks with those who walk with faith.

I, Sir Breatheth-Wrongus Maximus, Count of Unintentional Awkwardness, do hereby extend my most unnecessarily elaborate and theatrically overinflated apologies… for the egregious offense of simply existing.To the air I breathe—I’m sorry for converting you into carbon dioxide like some sort of freeloading biological chimney. To the floor—I’m sorry for stepping on you with the elegance of a confused flamingo in flip-flops. To every plant, pigeon, passing cloud, and Wi-Fi signal I’ve disturbed just by being here: forgive me. I apologize for the atoms I’ve borrowed from the universe, for the moments I’ve taken up in line at the coffee shop while deciding if I really want oat milk, and for every “haha” I’ve typed instead of a genuine emotion. I am the background NPC in the open-world game of life who accidentally bumped into you and said, ‘Oops, sorry,’ eight times too loud. Thus, I shall slink back into the swirling soup of cosmic irrelevance from whence I stumbled, clutching my honorary degree in Accidental Embarrassment and whispering apologies to the atoms I inconvenienced. May the floor recover from my clumsy treading, may the Wi-Fi forgive my presence, and may existence itself kindly look the other way as I continue to bumble onward—an overthinking, over-apologizing footnote in the margins of reality, signing off not with grace, but with a soft, muffled thud and a polite, eternal “sorry.”

1kel11x,https://www.reddit.com/r/limerence/comments/1kel11x/update_on_the_supplements_i_mentioned_on_previous/,Update on the supplements I mentioned on previous 2 posts -- ones that drastically helped limerence + mood!,"Thought I'd provide an update!

\*\*\*I will say that I am not a mental health or health expert, just sharing my experiences\*\*\*

I have ASD level 1, ADHD and OCD. Medicated on Elvanse 30mg but going up a dose soon. I am also biologically female.

The Lithium Orotate 5mg supplements still work amazingly well -- I'm taking 1 and a half tablets a day now, and I feel so much calmer, with less dramatic dips in mood -- they seem to work like an anti-anxiety. It also stops me from feeling cravings for alcohol or vaping.

Inositol + evening primrose oil helps too. The Inositol helped with OCD thoughts.

Ashwagandha I only take at night because it makes me sleepy and slightly dizzy.

Started taking L-Tryptophan at night which greatly helps my sleep. I also take potassium, zinc and magnesium -- my meds deplete minerals.

I also recently added Cissus -- this seems like another amazing, life changing supplement because \*\*for me\*\* it works like a natural anti-depressant, mood booster AND painkiller in one -- it got rid of my migraines very well, seems to have good anti-inflammatory effects and pain relieves just like taking a co-codamol but without the dizzy/sedated affect. It even seems to have mild stimulating effects without the jittery-ness. (But of course I'd research before trying it). I've read that Cissus contains potassium, magnesium and other minerals, so I am careful.

I've added Creatine supplements, L-carnitine, B vitamins, Spirulina and BCAAs which have boosted my energy for working out. Also seems to boost my mood -- I didn't expect this.

I also drink quite a lot of black coffee still in the mornings, which i'm guessing doesn't help mood swings and further depletes the body of nutrients like magnesium and iron. But I find that the caffeine helps my ADHD symptoms.

Edit: I also take chondroitin, collagen and glucosamine to help my skin and my hypermobility/joint stiffness -- this just helps me feel better in myself. Although I've read that collagen is bad for hypermobility, so maybe don't listen to this advice. ",0,1746368706.0,limerence,3,0.4,False

They say your Judgment's

Way up high,

Past pearly gates,

In the sweet by and by.

But lemme tell you, honey,

That's a cosmic fib!

Your judgment's happening

Right here, from your crib!

Every choice you make,

Every little step,

Creates a ripple,

Takes a sudden leap!

That parking spot you stole?

Yeah, the tiny one?

Prepare for a flat tire,

Before the day is done!

That white lie you just spun,

To skip a boring call?

Your phone will die exactly

When you need it all!

That time you scrolled and snickered,

At someone's online blooper?

Get ready for a typo,

That makes you look a stupor!

It's not a guy on a cloud,

With a list and a frown,

It's the universe itself,

Putting your pants on upside down!

Feeling grumpy and mean?

Spreading gloom and despair?

Expect to step in something

You really wouldn't share!

But if you're kind and helpful,

Lend a hand, share a smile,

Maybe you'll find five bucks,

On the very next tile!

Or your coffee will be perfect,

Your toast won't hit the floor

Little blessings boomerang,

Right back to your door!

So forget the distant future,

The great analysis,

Your karma's getting served,

With an instant, cosmic kiss!

Or a slap! Depending,

On the vibe you send out,

Better choose wisely, friend,

Leave no room for doubt!

'Cause the ""afterlife"" judgment?

Nah, that's just a tale,

Your today-choices dictate,

If you triumph or fail!

It's cause and effect, baby,

A real-time, earthly show,

What you plant right now,

Is the crop that will grow!

So let's ditch the bad habits,

The grumbles and the sighs,

And plant some good intentions,

Right before our very eyes!

Starting now, this second,

Let's be decent and bright,

And make our instant judgment,

A truly joyful sight!

No need to wait for heaven,

Or fear some fiery pit,

Just clean up your own act,

And get on with it!

She says that the decline in my mental health is due to many factors but one of them is the lack of self love I have. I was told to start finding ways to love myself and to build my confidence back up so that one day I will no longer be hurt by my narcs words. (fat, old, wrinkles on face make me look old etc etc). For the first time in MONTHS I cut my bangs and I put a bit of makeup on for myself. And all I saw in the mirror was an aging ugly woman. But at least my bangs I liked.

I was thinking of running in the mornings after taking kids to school. But I'm afraid of being accused of cheating. And most of the workout stuff is up in the room and we randomly are on OK days but then for a few days following it's verbal hatred hell. But when he gets that way I explain what I can but if he doesn't listen I grey rock him. I refuse to make the conversation escalate.

Anyways haven't had coffee yet, but my main question was. Living with a narc who complains about the way you look all the time damaging your self confidence. How do you build up your self love and confidence again. Because I'm to the point where I have seen enough threads on this reddit that have shown me that there is only one way I am ever going to be truly at peace and happy. And I need to work on myself to get there. I want to love myself and my body again. I want to not feel hatred for the face I see in the mirror. I don't care what anyone else thinks of me. I just want to not hate my own self. I don't know if that makes sense. ",2,1746368642.0,NarcissisticSpouses,9,0.75,False
1kekzzm,https://www.reddit.com/r/shortstories/comments/1kekzzm/rf_face_in_static/,[RF] Face in Static,"Astrid had mastered the art of vanishing in plain sight.

She moved through the corridors of the Environmental Integrity Bureau like steam, barely there, easily passed through. Her ID badge beeped; doors opened, but no one really looked at her. Not when she handed over reports. Not when she cleared mugs from conference tables. Not even when she spoke.

At home, she had a husband. Two children. A family that needed clean clothes, food on the table, and reminders to say thank you. She gave them all of it. They gave her silence.

It was the morning of the day it began.

The breakfast table was set. The smell of crispy bacon and light, fluffy pancakes thick in the air. Astrid had cooked the meal with care, pride swelling as she poured the syrup, thick and glistening. She watched as her husband left, the front door slamming behind him with a finality that rang in her chest.

Her children descended the stairs, eyes still heavy with sleep. They glanced at the table, took a piece of bacon, and sauntered off to school. Not a word, not even a nod. Astrid’s smile stiffened, her hands tightening around the edge of the table. She wanted to smash the dishes, set fire to the house but she restrained herself, knowing she would have to clean it up anyway. She just went to work.

The city was grey. Not just in colour, but in air. The sky hung heavy, like a breath held too long. Billboards flashed pristine green fields and endless blue skies, but outside the office window, the skyline was a jagged silhouette of soot-dusted metal and glass, suffocating under the weight of its own neglect.

Astrid’s department was responsible for “truth-adjusted environmental metrics.” The irony of her work gnawed at her like a splinter in her mind. She sorted data into neatly labelled folders, watching the numbers rise: CO2, toxicity, radiation were all increasing. Then, with a few clicks, they were polished, reduced, ready for public consumption. The truth was bent, shaped, and rebranded, neatly packaged for mass approval.

Nobody noticed her noticing.

Her boss, Ellis, liked to call it “perception recalibration.” Astrid called it lying.

That day, in the basement server room, Astrid had had enough. She clicked into a hidden partition labelled Cassandra. It held real-time feeds. There was unedited drone footage, raw climate maps, audio recordings of drowning coastlines. Cities submerged. Forests razed. Airborne contaminants edging closer to lethal.

They had known for years. And they had chosen silence.

Something in Astrid snapped.

For the first time in years, she stayed up past midnight. The house was still, her children asleep, her husband snoring softly. In the dim glow of her computer screen, Astrid stitched together the footage and reports into a single compressed file. When it was ready, she paused and stared at herself in the webcam. Her face pale, her eyes wide, a flicker of something between fear and exhilaration in them.

“You don’t know me. That’s the point. I’ve been a good mother. A quiet worker. A nobody. But today, I found proof they’re letting the world die. And tomorrow, you’ll see it. All of you will. You don’t have to remember my name. Just don’t forget what they did.”

She uploaded the file into the Emergency Public Broadcast Network from the city’s wartime years, still dormant, still hardwired into every screen, billboard, earpiece, and neural HUD in the district.

She pressed Send.

The next morning, the world exploded.

Pedestrians froze in the streets. Office workers stood motionless, their eyes glued to their screens. In classrooms, gyms, coffee shops, and hospitals, Astrid’s face flashed across every display. The footage rolled raw and uncensored. The silence shattered.

Astrid stayed home, watching it unfold with a quiet smirk on her lips and a fluttering storm in her chest.

Her husband came home early, speechless, his face pale. Her children avoided her gaze. The government confirmed the footage was authentic and then arrested three high-ranking Bureau executives. Protesters flooded the streets. A statue of a notorious climate denialist was pulled down and burned.

For three days, she was everything.

On day four, the screens changed.

A new law passed: “Information Control and Civil Stability Act.” It  was aimed at ""unauthorised data terrorism."" Drones began patrolling neighbourhoods. All electronic devices were updated, their security protocols strengthened. Personal media were scanned for any trace of opposition. The city curfew was reinstated.

Astrid turned on the television.

“Thanks to the public leak, we have now realised the danger of unverified information. The disruption cost lives. Systems failed. Stability was lost. We must protect truth… the right truth for the common good.”

And then: her face.

Frozen on the screen, labelled: “Instigator A-17. Data Weaponiser. Civil Threat.”

Her face and her message were the reason for the new regime.

At work, nobody spoke to her. Ellis was gone. The office now operated with faceless administrative intelligence. Her badge still worked. Doors opened. But her desk was gone. Her files were blank.

At home, her children avoided her. Her husband refused to speak. At night, she would hear him talking quietly. Not to her, but to someone else. Someone from the agency.

They had seen her. And now they wished they hadn’t.

Astrid walked through the centre of the city one last time. Above her, every billboard carried the same slogan:

“Truth is Clarity. Clarity is Control. Control is Peace.”

She looked up, hands trembling, and for a brief moment, the sky seemed to clear. She thought of the real sky, the blue one, and wondered if it would miss her.

As she faded back into the crowd, unseen, unknown, a single thought drifted through her mind. That they didn’t bury the truth. They crowned it with her face.",1,1746368626.0,shortstories,1,1.0,False

By the time my dad rang me to come help and went back upstairs she had left the house. Their neighbour rang me to say he'd found her and she was at his house. Whe she I get there she's got no shoes on or teeth in and has a collection of bags of random things and refused to go back home. She's fixated on my dad stealing from her and wouldn't go home with him from the neighbours. I've had to go buy her new shoes today because I can't find her old ones anywhere. She's a ridiculous hoarder which doesn't make things very easy at all. She's been getting up in the middle of the night expecting my sister to take her out for coffee.

I know this is all part of dementia/Alzheimer's but it's been such a big dip quickly in what has been a steady state for quite some time.

1kekx8u,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1kekx8u,Moving from French Press to Espresso – Seeking Advice on Machine Options,"Hey folks,

After three solid years of brewing my daily cup with a French press (and loving it), I’m finally feeling ready to step into the world of espresso. There’s something about the richness, intensity, and that perfect crema that’s been calling out to me lately—and I want to bring that café-style experience into my own kitchen.

I’ve been looking into machines and I’ve shortlisted a few options—ranging from semi-automatic machines to convenient pod systems. I’m sharing images along with this post, but would really appreciate your advice, experiences, and honest feedback before I make the leap.

Here’s what I’m considering right now:

Ariete Semi-Automatic Espresso Machine with Built-in Grinder – Looks like a great combo of convenience and control. I like the idea of grinding fresh beans every time and having some say in the process.

Vantro Espresso Machine – This one’s all over Amazon India right now with surprisingly strong reviews. It’s affordable, looks decent, and seems like a great value—especially for a beginner. But I’m unsure about its long-term durability.

Agaro Coffee Pod Machine – A no-fuss pod machine that promises quick and decent espresso. I’m intrigued, but not sure if I’ll miss the ritual and hands-on part of brewing.

Nespresso Essenza Mini – Now that Nespresso has officially launched in India (boutique store just opened in Delhi!), this feels like a tempting entry point into the espresso world. Pods are becoming more accessible, and honestly, I like the design and ease of use.

What I’m really trying to figure out is: Do I go for convenience or more control? I don’t want anything super high-maintenance, but I also want that satisfying, flavourful cup that makes the upgrade from French press truly worth it.

Would love to hear from anyone who’s used these machines—or has suggestions I might’ve missed. Also curious: for someone coming from a French press background, what’s the learning curve been like for espresso?

Thanks in advance for your thoughts and wisdom—excited to start this new coffee chapter!


PS. right now, I’m slightly leaning toward Nespresso or a pod coffee machine—mostly because of the convenience factor. If I do go that route, is there any real advantage to picking the Agaro over the Nespresso Essenza Mini or vice versa? Would love your thoughts.",0,1746368429.0,IndiaCoffee,0,0.33,False

1kekw3c,https://www.gnfei.com/blog/why-choose-a-coffee-printer-for-your-business,Why Choose a Coffee Printer for Your Business,"In today’s fiercely competitive café and beverage industry, standing out is more critical than ever. Traditional latte art can be impressive, but the rise of technology has introduced a new, game-changing solution: the coffee printer. This innovation allows businesses to print detailed designs, text, and even customer photos directly onto coffee foam, significantly enhancing the customer experience. Let's dive deeper into why a coffee printer could be one of the smartest investments for your coffee shop or business.
What Is a Coffee Printer?

A coffee printer, also known as a coffee art printer or latte art printer, is a machine that uses edible ink to print designs directly onto the surface of beverages like coffee, lattes, cappuccinos, or even beer and cocktails. It uses advanced printing technology to achieve precise, colorful, and intricate images that traditional baristas could not replicate by hand.

How Does a Coffee Printer Work?

Coffee printers are equipped with specialized print heads and food-safe edible ink cartridges. After loading an image—whether it’s a logo, a custom message, or a customer’s photo—the printer sprays the edible ink onto the foam surface without affecting the taste of the drink. The entire process takes only a few seconds, making it an efficient addition to a busy coffee shop.

Key Benefits of Using a Coffee Printer

1. Enhance Customer Experience
Customers love personalized experiences. Being able to order a coffee with their own face, a sweet message, or even a festive design adds an emotional connection and excitement that keeps them coming back.

2. Increase Brand Visibility
Adding your café’s logo or a branded design to your drinks is an easy and effective marketing strategy. Customers naturally take photos and share them on social media, giving your business organic exposure.

3. Differentiate Your Business
In saturated markets, being different is key. A coffee printer sets you apart by offering a unique product that most competitors don’t provide, instantly elevating your brand’s image.

4. Speed and Consistency
Unlike traditional latte art, which requires a skilled barista and can vary from cup to cup, a coffee printer delivers perfect, consistent results every time, ensuring customer satisfaction and efficiency.

5. Versatility Across Beverages
While mainly used for coffee, coffee printers can also print on milk foam, beer foam, smoothies, and even food items like cookies or cakes, expanding your customization options.

Common Applications for Coffee Printers

Coffee shops and cafés
Hotels and resorts
Event planners (for weddings, parties, corporate events)
Bakeries and dessert shops
Restaurants and bars
Why Coffee Printers Are Gaining Popularity

The trend of personalization shows no signs of slowing down. With people increasingly seeking unique and memorable experiences, businesses must find creative ways to connect with customers. A coffee printer taps directly into this desire, offering instant gratification and share-worthy moments.

Moreover, the rise of social media platforms like Instagram and TikTok has amplified the power of visual content. Customers are more likely to photograph and share drinks that look unique and creative, leading to free publicity and customer-generated content for businesses using coffee printers.

Important Factors to Consider Before Buying a Coffee Printer

1. Print Size and Quality
Choose a machine that supports high-resolution printing for sharp, clear images.

2. Edible Ink Safety
Make sure the printer uses certified food-grade edible ink to ensure safety and compliance with food industry regulations.

3. Machine Speed
Faster printers help manage peak hours more effectively without compromising service quality.

4. Ease of Use
A user-friendly interface and easy maintenance features are important to reduce staff training time and machine downtime.

5. Durability and Warranty
Investing in a reliable brand that offers solid technical support and warranties protects your long-term investment.

Future Outlook: Coffee Printing and Business Growth

As consumer expectations continue to evolve, offering a unique service like customized coffee printing will become more of a necessity than a luxury. Early adopters of coffee printers are already reaping the benefits by building stronger customer loyalty, increasing average ticket size, and enhancing brand perception.

Adding a coffee printer to your business is not just about aesthetics—it’s a strategic move to stay relevant, engage customers emotionally, and tap into the lucrative market of experience-driven consumers.

Conclusion

Incorporating a coffee printer into your coffee shop, restaurant, or event service is more than just a fun gimmick; it’s an investment into the future of personalized service. With benefits ranging from stronger branding to increased social media visibility, the coffee printer is revolutionizing how businesses connect with customers.

If you're ready to bring creativity and innovation to your business, now is the perfect time to invest in a coffee printer.

1kekvyq,https://www.reddit.com/r/AcousticGuitarReviews/comments/1kekvyq/why_is_the_ashthorpe_21670568_acousticelectric/,Why is the Ashthorpe 21670568 acoustic-electric guitar worth your attention review?,"**Testing the Ashthorpe 21670568 Acoustic-Electric Guitar: My Honest Experience**  

Having tested plenty of acoustic-electric guitars over the years, I was eager to try the Ashthorpe 21670568 for a blend of its affordability and promising specs. Marketed as an all-in-one option for beginners and veterans alike, this instrument seemed to offer a well-rounded experience. After weeks of strumming, tuning, and even letting my musically inclined nephew take it for a spin, I’m diving into the details of what stood out — both good and not-so-good.  

**Eye-Catching Design and Materials**  

The sleek black finish on this guitar grabbed my attention immediately. It has an ultra-glossy, almost mirror-like surface – perfect for those wanting a more contemporary aesthetic. The dreadnought cutaway design not only looks good but also ensures easier reach for the higher frets, which I found quite helpful during intricate chord transitions. Constructed with a spruce top and basswood body and fretboard, it hits a nice middle ground between durability and tonal quality. Compared to pricier full-body hardwood guitars, you might notice a slight difference in resonance, but for this price point, it’s well worth the compromise.  

**Sound Quality and Performance**  

For a guitar that doesn’t break the bank, the sound is truly impressive. Whether you're fingerpicking soft tunes or ramping up with aggressive strumming, the tonal balance holds up remarkably well. The basswood body complements the bright tones of spruce, producing a warm and clear sound. The biggest surprise? The onboard 4-band EQ. With adjustable bass, mid-range, treble, and presence, I was able to tweak the sound until it fit perfectly for both unplugged coffee shop practice and live amp sessions.  

[Find the best price for Ashthorpe 21670568 on Amazon.](https://guitarharbor.com/p/b07nqrhsgg/)  

**Ideal for Different Skill Levels**  

This guitar bundle aligns well with beginners while also offering features seasoned players can appreciate. My nephew, who started playing only a year ago, dove right in with no prior experience on electric systems. For me, the adjustable bridge and responsive strings were fantastic for quick tuning adjustments. Its lightweight build (around 9.3 pounds) and included strap made extended playing sessions comfortable too.  

**Highlights**  
- The 4-band EQ offers superb sound customization for various environments.  
- Durable materials balance affordability with quality tones, thanks to the spruce and basswood combination.  
- The cutaway design allows access to the upper frets seamlessly.  
- Complete bundle includes gig bag, cables, picks, and even extra strings – perfect for beginners.  

**Shortcomings**  

However, not everything about this guitar is perfect.  
- Out of the box, the strings felt a little stiff and took some time to stretch fully for optimal performance.  
- The tuning pegs, while functional, lacked the premium feel or precision of higher-end guitars.  
- It requires regular tuning after a few intense sessions, so don’t skip investing in a good tuner.  

**Competing Brands**  

How does the Ashthorpe fare against other popular acoustic-electric guitars? Compared to the Yamaha FGX800C, it undeniably provides better affordability and includes all the necessary accessories. On the flip side, Yamaha guitars tend to have a deeper resonance and higher durability due to their higher-grade wood construction. Similarly, the Fender FA-125CE offers a more polished finish and better tuning pegs, but it doesn’t include extras like a gig bag or strap at the same price point.  

For intermediate players more willing to splurge, models like the Ibanez AEWC400 might offer upgraded electronics and smoother frets for professional-level gigs. That said, Ashthorpe holds its own by being an all-in-one package.  

**Worth Every Penny**  

When it comes to value for money, this guitar bundle delivers. All the included accessories mean getting started is easy, and its construction holds up well for prolonged practice. While it might not match the depth or richness of more premium guitars, the Ashthorpe 21670568 is a fantastic choice for beginners or anyone transitioning to an acoustic-electric guitar without splurging beyond necessity.

Hi! I’m Stephanie. I’m 34, and live in Western Canada. I am looking for an online connection. I’d like to find someone I can confide in, get to know on a personal level, and enjoy spending time talking to, and vice versa. 

I am interested in talking to someone similar in age to me or older(30+). Similar time zone would also be preferred, but not a dealbreaker. I am looking for someone that is able to maintain conversation and put in effort(I will do the same!). Other than that, I don’t have any specific personality/physical traits that are mandatory. I am looking preferably for something longer term/ongoing, but that obviously depends on how well we click, but would prefer to only receive messages from people interested in the same. I’d be okay with it if there was some flirting involved, but I’m not looking for anything very sexual. If your post history is mostly or completely nsfw, we likely won’t jive. 

Here are some things I enjoy/a bit about me:
* big fan of tv shows/movies. I love horror the best, but not exclusively! 
* Music! My favorite band since is Blink 182, has been since I was 15. 
* I love to shop, and get my nails done
* Big fan of coffee(but not a snob about it)
* I have a dog that I love very much 
* I enjoy getting some exercise every day, developing a love for walking has done wonders for my mental health
*[This is what I look like](https://imgur.com/a/qTOZIaO)

That’s just a small look into who I am, but definitely looking forward to getting to know someone on a much deeper level. Please be willing to share photos of yourself, and I will obviously do the same. If my post interests you, please reply with your name, age, where you are located(does not have to be exact location!) and a bit about yourself so we can get a conversation started! Chats preferred over messages. 

Ice breaker question! What is the best movie or tv show that you’ve watched recently?
