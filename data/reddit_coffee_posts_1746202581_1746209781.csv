It was a solo date. So I‚Äôm an introvert, and going out alone usually feels like a nightmare. But after being cooped up at home for so long cuz of JEE and other entrance exams, I was losing my mind. So today, I went on a solo date and god it was tough. I was so nervous, felt like I was going to commit a robbery or something.
There weren't much people in the cafe. The staff were really nice. I ordered a cold coffee. It was really good. The place had great music and vibes. Didn't click more pictures. Sat there for about 30-40 minutes and it  turned out to be a great experience. 
10/10 reccomended!!!

1kd7tdu,https://www.reddit.com/r/AutismInWomen/comments/1kd7tdu/my_partner_asked_me_not_to_mask/,My partner asked me not to mask,"I am a highly anxious person, especially socially. As a result, I don't have many friends. This has been a point of contention in my relationship as my partner feels the pressure of being my 'everything person'.
He has asked me to accompany him to various social outings, some of which I have been able to attend, and others unable.

Last night, he told me his best friend invited us to go to their place for coffee today. I reluctantly said yes, as his best friend's gf would be there and it was an attempt at making me a new friend. I've met the best friend a few times but never chatted much and the girlfriend only once, about 1.5 years ago, and we barely spoke more than a hi/bye. 
Anyway, after I said yes, he noticed I was anxious and he tried reassuring me that they want to get to know me and I'm an interesting person, etc etc. Then he asked if I could promise him that I wouldn't mask with them. I immediately said no and I've felt terrible ever since. 
I know he meant it in the way that they would like me without my mask, but it feels like a criticism. Like this tool I've used my whole life to protect myself is thought of as an overreaction.

1kd7po2,https://www.reddit.com/r/marriott/comments/1kd7po2/marriott_long_beach_downtown_now_better_than/,Marriott Long Beach downtown (now better than Westin Long Beach),"
Recently finished 5 nights at LBD. Hotel has been renovated so it feels more modern. I usually stay half a block away at the Westin but wanted M Lounge access and to try it out. Glad I did. Westin is tired. Their lobby is nice but rooms need a Reno. Popcorn ceilings if that‚Äôs an indication. LBD room was smooth ceilings, modernist appointments. It was better.  Had some friends at the Westin and to be sure checked out their room. Still tired. 

This is a 12 floor hotel and my Titanium ‚Äúupgrade‚Äù got me on floor 11. It‚Äôs kind of amazing how every single hotel I stay in is ‚Äúcompletely booked‚Äù and no actual upgrades available. As such, I was bit annoyed when a colleague whose WIFE is Ambassador (and not even there) got a nicer room with terrace. Seriously Marriott needs to get their heads out of their asses. 

Bathroom lighting for the ladies is adequate. There is a built in magnifier mirror in the main mirror, which works if you are 4‚Äô0. I‚Äôm 5‚Äô9 so I didn‚Äôt bother trying to use it. No foot shelf in shower for shaving those legs. 

Room itself was quiet. I didn‚Äôt hear my next door neighbors nor footsteps from anyone on the floor above. Rooms are carpeted. There is a bay window with cushions which was a nice touch 

Bed wasn‚Äôt terribly comfortable. Bathroom smelled faintly like sewage the whole time. Thought it was my mind playing tricks on me but then a colleague told me that on his floor (4) he woke to horrendous smell. Walking to elevators he saw an industrial clean up hose and the sewage smell hit like a truck. He saw two back to back rooms with the actual sewage back up in the showers and floors.  Take from that what you will but def avoid floor 4 rooms. I‚Äôm thinking it‚Äôs highly likely the smell in my bathroom was related. They gave me some points to compensate. 

I had a Queen Mary view. Try to get a room with windows facing Ocean Blvd. Otherwise it is rooftops. Hotel location is walkable to lots of restaurants, the Promenade, Pike Place, Convention Center etc. 

Lounge was fine. Typical American breakfast fare but some California bougie upgrades like fresh watermelon juice, chia fruit bowls, yogurt mixes with fresh fruit etc. Only did eve one time and it‚Äôs the usual pre-packaged finger food fare like spring rolls and chips etc. Coffee machine offers lattes and the like.  

Bar in the main area is nicely situated and friendly bartenders. Food seemed way overpriced especially given all the restaurants nearby. Didn‚Äôt eat there. 

Parking is free. Yes. Free and in a covered garage. Major Bonus points for that. 

Overall I would give LBD a 7. Decent as a business traveler. Better than the Westin. Glad I got to bounce on a Friday as the weekend warriors were heading in and they tend to be missing the gene that allows them to realize that other people exist around them.

After a half a year of doing PT and some improvement in mobility and pain, I still had clicking and occasional pain when moving my hand certain ways.

I later went to a sports surgery specialist and did an MRI and found out the cause for my pain.

My doctor recommended PRP as an option because my injury wasn‚Äôt a complete tear so surgery wasn‚Äôt completely necessary but having been a year there was no guarantee that it would heal on its own any time soon.

The procedure cost 750 and wasn‚Äôt covered by insurance. I had some extra HSA/FSA money available and decided to try it.

A couple of weeks before the procedure they told me to cut out inflammatory medicine and not to drink coffee or alcohol 24 hours before the procedure. They advised that I drink plenty of water and to stay hydrated.

The procedure itself worked in two parts. The first was a blood draw where they located a vain and drew 60 ml of blood. It went quickly as I was well hydrated. I waited about 30-40 min for it to be run through a centrifuge and the concentrated platelets to be extracted.

The second part occurred while my blood was being processed with the doctor injecting a numbing agent, waiting some time, followed by the platelet injection.

I was informed that I may encounter pain for the next 3-6 hrs and swelling for up to 72 hrs after.

Tylenol was recommended for pain relief along with a couple of tablets of Oxi to get me through the first few days.

Luckily for me neither was the case. I had some pain early on but it was manageable. It kind of felt like there was an itch and like it did when I first got the injury. The next day there was a little pain so I was able to get by without any medication.

I read online that they advised continuing to abstain from Coffee and Alcohol for another 48 hrs after the procedure and decided to continue that after the fact.

Post procedure I was advised to wear a wrist brace and to minimize weight lifting and repeated movements of the wrist. I was also advised to continue to avoid anti inflammatory medication for the next month.

A month after the procedure I was to visit a hand therapy specialist.

I asked if I could continue to practice Jiu Jitsu post procedure and was advised not to roll but that drilling would probably be okay while wearing a wrist brace.

The wrist brace I picked up is linked here:

1kd7jjx,https://www.reddit.com/r/makemychoice/comments/1kd7jjx/i_want_to_break_up_with_my_girlfriend_of_4_years/,"I want to break up with my girlfriend of 4 years, but I‚Äôm afraid it‚Äôll turn into chaos like my last relationship did. (Plus TLDR)","I (26M) have been with my girlfriend (25F) for almost four years. We‚Äôre in a semi long-distance relationship‚Äîaround a 40-minute to an hour drive apart. There‚Äôs love between us. There‚Äôs history. But there‚Äôs also been a pattern of emotional imbalance, overreactions, miscommunication, and me constantly trying to keep the peace at the cost of my own peace of mind.

This isn‚Äôt the first time I‚Äôve thought about ending things. Actually, early in our relationship, I did initiate a breakup. I told her things weren‚Äôt working out, and after that, I also initiated a hangout. Not because I wanted to play games‚Äîbut because I still cared. I was unsure. I didn‚Äôt want to vanish‚ÄîI wanted to talk things through in person. But from her end, it seemed to completely throw her off. She took it as a weird attempt to break up with her while still keeping a foot in the door. She didn‚Äôt understand that I was trying to bring clarity, not confusion. I felt misunderstood‚Äîand I‚Äôve never really brought it up again since.

And now, years later, I feel like I‚Äôm back in the same emotional place. But this time, the weight is heavier.

Here are some things I‚Äôve been carrying:

We‚Äôve had emotional blowups over small things. Early on, we got into a major fight because we couldn‚Äôt use her bedroom‚Äîher cousin (24F now, but 21 at the time) was taking a nap. They all live in a three-bedroom house with her mom and brother, so she shared the bed with her cousin at the time. I said, ‚ÄúLet‚Äôs just do something else,‚Äù trying to stay calm. She snapped. Screaming, crying, chaos. I walked away. And I remember thinking: if I had flipped like that, I‚Äôd be labeled toxic.

She has this pattern of rejecting help, then feeling bad later. One time in D.C., the train doors almost closed on her and she dropped her drink. I picked it up to help, and she got mad‚Äîtelling me I should‚Äôve just left it. I didn‚Äôt understand why trying to help turned into a moment of frustration. Another time, we were in a drive-thru with her mom, and her coffee order came out wrong. I calmly suggested she could ask them to fix it. She said no. We didn‚Äôt argue or talk about it after‚Äîwe just moved on. But I never forgot it. It was another one of those quiet, unresolved moments where I wasn‚Äôt sure what she actually wanted from me.

There was also a situation involving shared laundry after we went to the pool together. I had already put both of our clothes in the washer and moved them into the dryer. That night, before heading to bed, I asked her if she could take them out of the dryer‚Äînot even fold them‚Äîjust take them out so I could get everything ready for the morning. She said no and suggested we just do it in the morning. I ended up getting up and doing it myself. When I came back upstairs, she was crying and said she should‚Äôve listened to me. I wasn‚Äôt trying to argue‚ÄîI was just trying to stay organized after a long day. Once again, something small turned into a heavy emotional moment.

I don‚Äôt feel like my boundaries are respected. Recently, I was really low on money‚Äîdown to less than $1 in one account and under $30 in the other after spending $800 on tires. I still had enough to cover a $5 McDonald‚Äôs meal and planned to treat us. I handed her my phone to pick something. She quietly added her debit card to my app and paid. I wasn‚Äôt mad at the help‚ÄîI appreciated it. But the part that felt off was that I‚Äôd already said I could cover it. She didn‚Äôt tell me. It just felt like another moment where my voice was skipped over.

There have been other smaller things too. On Valentine‚Äôs Day, we agreed not to do anything. But I still got her a small gift the day before‚Äîlow effort, but heartfelt. She didn‚Äôt get me anything, which was fine, because I had told her before that I don‚Äôt care for gifts. But then she felt guilty and got me a gift a week later. It was well-intentioned‚Äîbut again, I felt like I cared first, and she reacted after.

And yeah‚ÄîI‚Äôve made mistakes too. One year, I gave her a half-eaten bag of Reese‚Äôs for her birthday. That was thoughtless and I‚Äôve owned that. I‚Äôve also never invited her to my place, partly because I live with judgmental family members in a Caribbean household, and I‚Äôve always felt like I had to protect both her and myself from being judged.

As a result, I‚Äôm almost always the one going to her. But to be fair, she doesn‚Äôt have her own car. She used her mother‚Äôs car to travel everywhere‚Äîincluding to see me‚Äîbut that car was totaled. Public transportation from her place to mine is almost a two-hour trip. I chose to drive over there because it made more sense, and honestly, I didn‚Äôt mind. It never felt like an imbalance‚ÄîI just preferred it that way.

So no‚ÄîI‚Äôm not perfect. But I‚Äôm constantly reflecting. And lately, I feel like I‚Äôve been doing more emotional work trying to understand her than she‚Äôs done trying to understand me.

And here‚Äôs the real part I‚Äôm scared to admit:
I‚Äôve had a messy breakup before. It lingered for a long time. Hurt a lot. And now I‚Äôm scared that if I end things with her, I‚Äôll go down the same path‚Äîchecking her page, overthinking, regretting, wondering what she‚Äôs doing. That emotional spiral is what‚Äôs holding me back.

But it‚Äôs not just that. I also have this underlying fear that if I do break up with her, she might not take it well‚Äîand there‚Äôs a part of me that worries she might come looking for me. Whether that means showing up at my house or even my job, I don‚Äôt know‚Äîbut the fact that I‚Äôve even considered that as a possibility makes this more than just emotional hesitation. That unpredictability doesn‚Äôt feel safe. It feels like a potential threat, and that alone makes me hesitant to make a move, even if I feel it‚Äôs the right one.

And the fear isn‚Äôt coming from nowhere. In my last relationship before her, the person I was dating cheated on me, and then showed up at my house trying to talk things over‚Äîasking why things were the way they were and trying to convince me to get back together. I did‚Äîfor a little while. But when I broke up with her again a month later, she tried to come to my house again, called me repeatedly, and did everything she could to stay in contact. It was overwhelming, chaotic, and honestly, it messed with me. That experience is a big reason why I‚Äôm so hesitant now. I don‚Äôt want to repeat that nightmare.

I know deep down this isn‚Äôt working. I‚Äôve tried to express that before. But I don‚Äôt want this breakup to turn into another emotional storm. I just want peace‚Äîeven if it‚Äôs painful.

‚∏ª

Make my choice: Do I stay and hope for things to change‚Äîor finally let go and risk the aftermath in order to heal?

‚∏ª

TL;DR: I‚Äôve been with my girlfriend for almost 4 years. I tried to break up early in the relationship but felt misunderstood. Since then, I‚Äôve dealt with emotional imbalance, boundary issues, and feeling like I always give more first. I‚Äôve made mistakes too, but I‚Äôve tried. I‚Äôm scared to break up because of how messy my last one was‚Äîand because I‚Äôm not sure how she‚Äôd react if I did. My last ex cheated on me, showed up at my house, kept calling, and made the breakup messy and stressful. I‚Äôm afraid that might happen again. But staying feels like I‚Äôm slowly losing myself.

no matter what i do, the feeling just stays, and it‚Äôs worse now, with crippling anxiety and so many anxiety attacks through the day - it‚Äôs unbearable and hurts so much.

i‚Äôve tried listening to all kinds of music, but nothing helps. i seriously don‚Äôt want to keep living. and i hate what i‚Äôve put my family through.

i don‚Äôt even crave love or comfort anymore - i just want peace. but my mind doesn‚Äôt know how to give me that. and i‚Äôm struggling, really struggling, to hold on.

Title of the chapter Jaifar Abbas,"This story starts around 500 generations ago when a guy called ‚ÄúJaifar Abbas‚Äù controlled the world. Jaifar worked everywhere, he had bases on land, air, and sea. He was the first person to launch a rocket off of our planet, he was also the last. He had a monopoly in most of the markets. As the years progressed and his hair became grey he knew his time was near. Jaifar declared throughout the lands that his corporation would close when he died. He appointed his best friend with a button that shall be pressed when he dies, sparking the start of his plan. When he dies and the button is pressed all research and development tech will launch into orbit and re-enter the planet at a Secret research centre that will act as the primary and only base of operations for all his tech.
	After the plan was broadcast, explaining the operation with minimal details, people became frantic. The people of the world rioted. Everyone worried he would withdraw all the inventions he had made over the past 60 years and leave them stranded, alone in a dark ocean without a raft. The next day, thousands of people stood outside his mansion, waving signs that read, ‚ÄúC‚Äômon, man.‚Äù 
	‚ÄúNo they did not!‚Äù chuckled Shaleh jumping out of bed.

	‚ÄúLay down and close your eyes,‚Äù I said as I was putting Shaleh back to bed ‚ÄúYou need some rest‚Äù 

	‚ÄúOk, now finish the story‚Ä¶ please‚Äù

	‚ÄúFine, but you‚Äôll sleep after this.‚Äù 

As the crowd's commotion came to a climax, Jaifar came out on a balcony wearing a white long shirt that reached his toes, and over that a half-transparent black robe. He looked wise as always, tall in stature, trimmed beard, light moustache, his hair combed, but not perfect. He was looking like his normal self again. Jaifar held a megaphone (which was pretty new at the time) and made it produce a loud beep enough to make all 3000 people shut up and cover their ears.
 He said, ‚ÄúI will deploy 500 satellites for a new project I have been working on, it is a communications system that will allow people across the planet to communicate in a matter of seconds,‚Äù then he went back inside. 
The crowd was stunned, it was so quiet you could hear a pin drop. Jaifar, for the past few years rarely spoke, and when he did he spoke a sentence or two, people say he never talked, probably because he had so many secrets, but I think it was just because of his old age and him being too tired.
A few years passed by and interest died down a bit. Because of the new satellites, maps became more accurate, and an internetwork of wireless communication spread like a wildfire. There became - and for the first time - a worldwide map that had every bit of land and water in detail, except for of course The Great Desert. It is every explorer‚Äôs dream - mine as well - to explore what lies beyond its reach. The network provided great profits for Jaifars company because all the people on this planet used it. The network was free, but some software was not, and all software was run by Jaifars company. 
Even if Jaifar was insanely wealthy, he made sure to give back to the people, generous in give-
‚ÄúTell me about The Great Dessert,‚Äù blurted Shaleh, ‚Äúwhy is it special?‚Äù

‚ÄúI‚Äôll tell you later,‚Äù I said, ‚Äúyou need to get some rest‚Äù

‚ÄúOkay‚Äù
	I cut the story short, for it was getting late and Shaleh needed his sleep. I shut the lights and closed the door, going for a long-needed fresh whiff of air from the balcony. It‚Äôs good that I‚Äôm teaching Shaleh about our family heritage from an early age, I don‚Äôt want our young to forget about our family‚Äôs greatest - Jaifar Abbas. 

Chapter 2
	I had been indoors for the past few days for various reasons so the balcony became my outside spot. The balcony is not that big, only a few paces across, and has enough space for 2 chairs and a coffee table. The railing is made of columns of steel black in color that repeat in a nice, curving pattern, and all this looks upon the city skyline. Skylines aren‚Äôt my thing, but I admit this skyline is great.
 Shaleh and I moved in with our uncle because our house was getting renovated, so no adventures for now. We haven‚Äôt acclimated to this new life in the city, for there is a lot of contrast between our house on a farm near the woods and some grasslands, and the capital city life where business is booming, traffic is flowing, and people are flooding in. Capital city is the biggest city in this world, it has nearly 50 million people and a lot more in the suburbs around it. It is the center of the economic, social, and tourism worlds.

Our uncle is in charge of running the world's main server network, and so he lives in one of the best towers in the city. The tower is tall and luxurious, for my uncle likes to enjoy the riches god has given him - as he should. The thing I like most about it is the basement, where you can find a map on a screen that can zoom into any place on the planet, except The Great Desert.

The reason I‚Äôm obsessed with it is that my dad is in charge of mapping and navigation everywhere

1kd7fwv,https://www.reddit.com/r/WeightLossAdvice/comments/1kd7fwv/lost_on_where_to_start_and_very_new_to_this/,lost on where to start and very new to this community,"Hi all!

I'm struggling to find where to start for my weight loss and fitness journey. The market is so saturated with different things which is rendering me completely lost on where to begin. I was a pretty active kid in middle school to high school (volleyball, tennis, swimming, etc etc), but at the end of my freshman year of high school up until last fall (close to 6 years), I have had around 20 surgeries. At one point it was averaging about 1 surgery every 3 months, with 2 weeks to a month of recovery after each surgery. Last fall I had three surgeries in one week (yikes!). This made it almost impossible to get back into an active routine before being put under the knife again. After each surgery, I would gain about 10-20 lbs and then stagnate in recovery. Whenever I would try calorie deficits mixed with tolerable exercises (walking, running, HIIT in moderation) I would remain at the same weight for three months and then be right back in my doctor's office with another medical issue. This has made losing weight and remaining active almost impossible as it seems like all of my progress is essentially erased with each surgery. On the bright side, my last surgeries have proven to be quite effective in maintaining my symptoms and it's predicted that I won't need another one for 10 years (yay!). So, here are my goals, info, and questions for y'all:

Info about me: 22F, 5'2"", 240lbs, eating around 1,800 calories/day

Goals: I'd like to be more flexible, lose weight (cuz let's be honest, 240lbs is not helping with my medical complications lol), and feel stronger. My goal weight is 140-155lbs. I'm getting married in summer of 2027, so I would like to hit my weight goal by then. I would LOVE to be able to do things like pull ups, handstands, and the the splits! It's not just about losing weight for me, if I'm 160 or 170lbs and able to move better than I am now, I would be happy. I'm currently in healthcare and would also like to build my strength so that it is easier to do tasks like cleaning patients, lifting patients and equipment, and being able to maintain high activity where I'm actively on my feet for long periods of time. I do enjoy cardio and would like for that to be a part of some aspect of my workout routine, but not the whole of it.

Questions:

1. Workout routine: I have looked into calisthenics and pilates, but can't decide where to start or which, if either, is best. Based on my goals and my history, what would you recommend I try and how should I start? I want a routine that motivates me, but I don't have access to a gym and I can't afford joining a class or hiring a trainer. Ideally, I'd like a routine that is best to do at home or outside. If you have influencers or websites or youtube channels that you would recommend, I would love to take a look at them! Or, if you're willing to type up a whole routine for me, I would love you endlessly and would forever be in your debt.
2. Diet: Is my caloric intake still too high for what I want to achieve? I have a high protein and fiber intake and typically I try to balance my meals so that its vegetables >> protein > carbs, at least for my bigger meals. I have found it most difficult to have a balanced breakfast as that is usually the busiest time of my day, so I typically eat a cup of Greek vanilla yogurt and a banana, maybe adding in a fiber one bar if I need variety. For snacks I typically eat a special K protein bar, a gomacro bar, an outshine fruit bar, or an apple with peanut butter (no more than 2 tbsp) and raisins. For lunch lately I've been eating the Jennifer Aniston salad from The Real Food Dieticians website (very yum) with a side of cut up vegetables (broccoli, cucumbers, green bell peppers, etc). Then for dinner I have a some protein (lately a salmon fillet or chicken breast) with a carb (usually a noodle, jasmine rice, potatoes, or quinoa), and a vegetable (broccoli, green beans, asparagus, or mixed salad w/avocado caesar dressing). I will take any advice about my diet. Be as honest as you would like. Truly any help is appreciated. I did see a nutritionist and she suggested the diet as described above, but I feel like it's lacking.
3. Motivation: How do you stay motivated? It's been difficult for me to maintain a routine due to my medical situation, but I think if I have more motivation, then I would stick with it more. I do have a scale, but stepping on it every day and seeing the numbers stay the same decreases my motivation significantly. I have a partner who loses weight incredibly fast and we both have very different needs so it's difficult sometimes when I compare myself to him (or people on social media for that matter). I know, as of now, I have slow motility which makes losing weight all the more difficult and it makes this whole process feel hopeless sometimes. So any motivation tips would be great.
4. Are there other things you do to maintain health that are not exercise or diet related? I don't drink soda or coffee (I have a coffee maybe once a month) and I drink tea daily. Are there any other tips for maintaining health? I know I should be sleeping between 7-9 hours a night. Any other tips you can think of?

1kd7fk8,https://www.reddit.com/r/women/comments/1kd7fk8/a_beautiful_relationship_that_ended_too_quickly/,A beautiful relationship that ended too quickly ‚Äì can it be saved?,"Hey girls,

It‚Äôs hard for me to talk about personal things, but I feel like I need an honest opinion from the outside, so I‚Äôm going to tell you my story.

Three weeks ago, a relationship ended that meant a lot to me/ us.
Before I met him, I went through a very hard period in my life, especially with men: I was emotionally hurt, manipulated, used‚Ä¶ even physically hurt. Eventually, I moved to another city to start over.

A month later, I met Him. He was the first man to whom I told all the painful things from my past, because I trusted him.
And to be honest, he is one of the few people I‚Äôve been able to talk to about anything. He‚Äôs understanding, attentive, kind, never judged me, taught me a lot, never hurt me‚Ä¶ I really have nothing bad to say about him. On the contrary‚Ä¶

During that time, I started to become myself again: I smiled again, I laughed, I opened up, I felt free‚Ä¶
For four months, he was the one who insisted, who called, who took me out, organized outings, and always wanted to spend time together.

After four months, we made love for the first time, and everything seemed perfect. 
Things went well for another month, but then something changed‚Ä¶

He became distant, didn‚Äôt talk to me the same way, we stopped doing fun things together. We‚Äôd just stay at home or go out for a coffee from time to time. And from that moment on, I felt like we were no longer truly a couple.

Anyway‚Ä¶ in the meantime, his life also changed completely, like 180 degrees, and we had less and less time for each other. I missed that, and I showed him that I felt the absence (which is normal), but maybe it wasn‚Äôt good that I didn‚Äôt give him space to live his life without me as well‚Ä¶ and then all these little things started to add up.

He later told me that the fact that we were always together, that we didn‚Äôt have any time apart, suffocated him. Everything got too intense, too fast. I also had a family drama on my side, which unfortunately I dragged into our relationship, and that only made things worse.

During the last two months, I was already lost. I gained weight, cried a lot, I was sad and closed off. I was no longer that cheerful and free girl, but a shadow of what I used to be. And he saw that.

When we broke up, he told me that the ‚Äúspark‚Äù between us wasn‚Äôt the same anymore, and that there‚Äôs no point in staying together just to see if it might come back ‚Äì because if it doesn‚Äôt, we‚Äôd only end up realizing years from now that it didn‚Äôt work.

Two weeks later, we saw each other again. We were made love again, and honestly‚Ä¶ it had never been so beautiful between us. I saw his look, I know and feel that he still feels something for me‚Ä¶ But he hasn‚Äôt really reached out since. I messaged him once, but now I don‚Äôt want to do that anymore. 

I just want to show him that I‚Äôm the girl he first met, not the sad and desperate version from the last few months.

What felt strange to me was that when I went to his place after the breakup, none of my things had been moved. My toothbrush, shower gel, hair ties, even my underwear‚Ä¶ everything was exactly where I had left them. As if he didn‚Äôt want to erase my presence from his life (delulu is deluluing‚Ä¶)

Right now, I still have his laptop and some of his clothes. I‚Äôll have to return them by the end of next week. So we‚Äôll probably see each other again because of that.

My question for you is:

I know time heals everything, and if we‚Äôre meant to be together, we will be ‚Äî if not now, then maybe later.
I also know that he knows who I truly am, and that I‚Äôm not the sad, lost girl I became in those last couple of months.
I want to become myself again, first and foremost for me, to find my happiness again. I want to give him space, so he can realize whether he misses me or not‚Ä¶

But at the same time, I don‚Äôt want that little spark that still exists between us to completely fade away‚Ä¶

I‚Äôm sure many girls have been through this and have felt what I‚Äôm feeling now. And if a close friend were in my place, I‚Äôd know exactly what to say to her. But we all know it‚Äôs much easier to give advice than to follow it‚Ä¶ in your mind, everything is clear, but in reality, it‚Äôs so hard‚Ä¶

5 days later i wish him a happy birthday on instagram and he asks me if im ready for tonight. 

He then texted me the time to meet up. I was confused. We had plans? I didn't remember make them and we never followed up.with a text. 

I said: ""I'd  love to see you to celebrate, But I can't drive thirty minutes away for tacos because I am going phoenix for work and need to pack and shower. Let's grab a beer by our houses to celebrate instead!""

He then sent me a text along the lines of ""uhhh no."" And ""I appreciate you, but you hurt my feelings a lot and you don't always know how to be a good friend. I'm not sure I want to remain friends.""

I didn't text back. 

Months layer he texted me asking me how my Christmas was. We chatted a little, and I agreed to coffee. I never set a date or location and sort of didn't say no, but I just I'd love to and we'd see. I sort of wanted to blow him off.

I sorta didn't wanna hang out. 

A few weeks later I posted a picture of a friend at an annual event he was my date to last year, and he blocked me. 


1. We didn't formalize the birthday dinner ahead of time over text. We just mentioned it in an in person conversation. I have zero recollection of this conversation taking place.

2.  I offered to meet him nearby on his birthday for a drink to celebrate with him instead instead of a taco dinner 30 minutes away 

3. I thought we were cool because months later he messaged wanting to get coffee, 

4. He forgot my birthday. I turned 30 this year. I have a temporary hairloss condition and spend it at home alone sobbing and adjusting to antidepressants. I remembered his birthday and had it in my phone. 

Tldr: i know this was a while ago but im still mad about it. I feel like he has high expectations of our friendship.

We've been friends for a long time.  I hate to lose him. But there's no way I can keep him. I just keep running it over again and again in my head. 

We've had miscommunications before, but I always make an effort to be on time and do what I say i'm gonna do

1kd7f1t,https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoMoonShots/comments/1kd7f1t/kendu_why_kendu_is_the_next_multibillion_dollar/,Kendu - Why Kendu is the next multi-billion dollar memecoin,"**A quick intro to get everyone up to speed**

Kendu is over a year old and is currently on 3 chains(Ethereum, Solana and Base) with ETH being our native chain, we have around 18k holders and sit at 12 million market cap. Kendu's strength relies entirely on the community, there is no reliance on a ""team"", ""dev"" or ""KOL"", whilst it may take a bit more time and effort to grow, it means we have no ceiling. This gives Kendu an unlimited potential to grow and makes us far more stable. Kendu's emphasis on community is very similar to the 2021 method of running it up with notable coins like Shib, Doge and Pepe also following this same idea. 

**Kendu's Online Effort**

Kendu is very active on Reddit and Twitter, our Twitter output matches coins in the hundreds of millions, which shows just how strong and ""ahead"" of the game Kendu is. Furthermore, on Reddit we are absolutely **number one** please check out the recent top posts on each crypto subreddit(including this one), you will see mutliple Kendu posts and you will also see our engagement is 10x the next best!!!  
We are also on Titkok, CMC, Stocktwits(shoutout to them) and Instagram. We have a pretty decent presence on all of them but Reddit and Twitter are our ""bread and butter""

In the past we have also been featured front and centre on a Coinbase Advert. Yes, an official Coinbase Advert, this advert showcased Kendu up there with the very best.

We hit 50k Certik votes to gain a free audit, Certik is an extremely reputable security based company. The only other coin to reach 50k votes was Pepe, the one that hit 10 billion outside of a bull run!!!  
Certik rates Kendu's community as 98/100, I would advise you to check other reputable ""cult"" memecoins and see how Kendu compares. I will not call them out but you can see for yourself(Hint Kendu is ranked the best), you can see the full audit here: [https://skynet.certik.com/projects/kendu-inu](https://skynet.certik.com/projects/kendu-inu)

**Kendu's IRL Effort**

Whilst Kendu is a social media powerhouse, we excel in IRL initiatives. We are reaching a territory that no other coin has reached before and this is gonna be so attractive to retail. IRL products gives a coin some substance and it shows we are here to stay, Kendu is not some phase, we are a **BRAND**

Kendu's social media presence puts Kendu as a major player in this bull run, but our IRL dominance puts us above the rest of the competition and it is why I only hold Kendu

* Kendu Energy - An Energy drink company that sells both full sugar and sugar free versions, this is the only product that I have tried. It is GREAT
* Kendu Coffee - A coffee company that sells both caffeinated and decaf coffee farmed in Brazil
* Kendu Merch - t-shirts, caps, hoodies, you name it!
* Kendu animation - a team that is making a short, Japanese style, animation series about Kendu, they have released an episode so far!
* Kendu games - a board game made by 2 chads
* Kendu Creator- a 3d printable mask that can be used to make videos online, this means you can showcase your skills whilst still remaining anonymous
* Kendu pendants - A Kendu style dog tag
* Kendu Beer - not out yet, but it is in the making and the prototype is out
* Kendu Video Games - made by professional developers, this is not out yet but we have seen sneak peeks. I think it will be available on Steam.
* Tattoos - A lot of holders have Kendu tattoos, I have a massive amount of respect for these people. There is 1 that I cannot show though : )
* Murals - Spray painted art
* Kendu Entertainment, a glow in the dark pickleball tournament in India that is gaining lots of traction within the sport
* Kendu Street Team, they have visited 3 festivals in Florida with the most recent one being Florida Groves Festival. They give away Kendu Energy, merch and they also create murals!

**My Opinion**

I really think Kendu will reach the tens of billions this cycle, we are factually the strongest community in the space currently and we all know community strength is all that matters. Communtiy strength is what defines the price of a memecoin, the most obsessed, determined communtiies always win, it has been proven time and time again. All Shib, Pepe and other memecoin hall of famers had was a die-hard community, Kendu is no different.

My advice to you is to join our telegram or subreddit, but our tg is better, ask whatever questions you want and check out our vibes. Skip the Subway Sandwhich and put the money into Kendu, at 10 billion, $15 invested now would be worth $15000!!!

---

**Performance that Meets High-Volume Demands**  
Testing the Nuova Simonelli MAPPI13SEM02ND0002 espresso machine in a busy environment was a game-changer. I‚Äôve used a lot of espresso machines in my time, but this one truly stands out for its performance capabilities in high-volume settings. The Soft Infusion System is genuinely something to write home about‚Äîit produced a velvety, creamy espresso shot each time. Whether I was prepping a single cup in a rush or multitasking with multiple orders, the machine delivered with consistency. Though it boasts impressive steaming functions with the turbocream system, I noticed the milk frother needed a bit of practice for optimal results. If repetition is key to mastering espresso-making skills, this machine is the ideal partner.

**Design for Comfort and Efficiency**  
Its metallic finish and modern design add both aesthetic appeal and durability, fitting into contemporary kitchens and coffee shops alike. The design isn‚Äôt just about looks‚Äîit‚Äôs ergonomic! Long hours behind the counter were manageable because of how smoothly the operations flowed with its comfortable design. The inclusion of cool-touch steam wands is particularly thoughtful, saving my fingers from accidental burns. That said, the machine weighs a hefty 250 pounds, making installation a two-person task at minimum. Moving it around isn‚Äôt something you'll do lightly, so better find its forever spot before use.

**Advantages**  
- Soft Infusion System ensures high-quality espresso.  
- Cool-touch steam wands prioritize user safety.  
- Highly efficient and ideal for large-scale usage.  
- Ergonomically designed to reduce operator fatigue.  

[Ready to snag Nuova Simonelli MAPPI13SEM02ND0002? See Amazon‚Äôs price.](https://idealcoffeeshop.com/price/b00ep076ai/)

**Areas for Improvement**  
Despite being a semi-automatic machine, there‚Äôs a slight learning curve when it comes to perfecting milk texturing. I had to fine-tune the settings a couple of times to get it on par with barista-level precision. Additionally, the machine‚Äôs weight might pose challenges for smaller establishments or home settings without sufficient counter space and support.

**Critiques**  
- Heavyweight design may limit portability.  
- Milk frother requires fine-tuning and experience.  

**Operational Efficiency Suited for Demanding Professionals**  
The semi-automatic operation mode provides a balance between control and convenience. Some espresso beginners might lean toward fully automatic machines, but for seasoned coffee enthusiasts and professionals, this offers a satisfying middle ground. Switching between different brewing styles was seamless thanks to its reusable filter and portafilter compatibility, making it surprisingly versatile for its size and intended purpose.

**Peer Products**  
In testing, I compared this machine to the Breville Barista Pro and La Marzocco Linea Mini. While the Breville is far cheaper and more compact, it lacks the high-volume functionality of this beast. On the other hand, the La Marzocco Linea Mini provides similar premium-level espresso but at a significantly higher price. What sets the Nuova Simonelli machine apart is its perfect balance between price, performance, and professional-grade capabilities. It ultimately caters to a broader range of users, especially in commercial or busy environments.

**Value for Money**  
The first thing you'll notice is the quality-price ratio, which outshines others in its league. It‚Äôs not often that you find an espresso machine brimming with professional features yet priced in a range that feels justified. While you can find cheaper machines for home use, this one is a steal for anyone catering to high-volume demands. Its sturdy build and multifunctionality assure you that you're investing in years of reliable service. Whether you‚Äôre entertaining guests at home or running a coffee shop, it won‚Äôt let you down.

This story starts around 500 generations ago when a guy called ‚ÄúJaifar Abbas‚Äù controlled the world. Jaifar worked everywhere, he had bases on land, air, and sea. He was the first person to launch a rocket off of our planet, he was also the last. He had a monopoly in most of the markets. As the years progressed and his hair became grey he knew his time was near. Jaifar declared throughout the lands that his corporation would close when he died. He appointed his best friend with a button that shall be pressed when he dies, sparking the start of his plan. When he dies and the button is pressed all research and development tech will launch into orbit and re-enter the planet at a Secret research centre that will act as the primary and only base of operations for all his tech.
	After the plan was broadcast, explaining the operation with minimal details, people became frantic. The people of the world rioted. Everyone worried he would withdraw all the inventions he had made over the past 60 years and leave them stranded, alone in a dark ocean without a raft. The next day, thousands of people stood outside his mansion, waving signs that read, ‚ÄúC‚Äômon, man.‚Äù 
	‚ÄúNo they did not!‚Äù chuckled Shaleh jumping out of bed.

	‚ÄúLay down and close your eyes,‚Äù I said as I was putting Shaleh back to bed ‚ÄúYou need some rest‚Äù 

	‚ÄúOk, now finish the story‚Ä¶ please‚Äù

	‚ÄúFine, but you‚Äôll sleep after this.‚Äù 

As the crowd's commotion came to a climax, Jaifar came out on a balcony wearing a white long shirt that reached his toes, and over that a half-transparent black robe. He looked wise as always, tall in stature, trimmed beard, light moustache, his hair combed, but not perfect. He was looking like his normal self again. Jaifar held a megaphone (which was pretty new at the time) and made it produce a loud beep enough to make all 3000 people shut up and cover their ears.
 He said, ‚ÄúI will deploy 500 satellites for a new project I have been working on, it is a communications system that will allow people across the planet to communicate in a matter of seconds,‚Äù then he went back inside. 
The crowd was stunned, it was so quiet you could hear a pin drop. Jaifar, for the past few years rarely spoke, and when he did he spoke a sentence or two, people say he never talked, probably because he had so many secrets, but I think it was just because of his old age and him being too tired.
A few years passed by and interest died down a bit. Because of the new satellites, maps became more accurate, and an internetwork of wireless communication spread like a wildfire. There became - and for the first time - a worldwide map that had every bit of land and water in detail, except for of course The Great Desert.

‚ÄúTell me about The Great Dessert,‚Äù blurted Shaleh, ‚Äúwhy is it special?‚Äù

‚ÄúI‚Äôll tell you later,‚Äù I said, ‚Äúyou need to get some rest‚Äù

‚ÄúOkay‚Äù
	I cut the story short, for it was getting late and Shaleh needed his sleep. I shut the lights and closed the door, going for a long-needed fresh whiff of air from the balcony. It‚Äôs good that I‚Äôm teaching Shaleh about our family heritage from an early age, I don‚Äôt want our young to forget about our family‚Äôs greatest - Jaifar Abbas.

	I had been indoors for the past few days for various reasons so the balcony became my outside spot. The balcony is not that big, only a few paces across, and has enough space for 2 chairs and a coffee table. The railing is made of columns of steel black in color that repeat in a nice, curving pattern, and all this looks upon the city skyline. Skylines aren‚Äôt my thing, but I admit this skyline is great.
 Shaleh and I moved in with our uncle because our house was getting renovated, so no adventures for now. We haven‚Äôt acclimated to this new life in the city, for there is a lot of contrast between our house on a farm near the woods and some grasslands, and the capital city life where business is booming, traffic is flowing, and people are flooding in. Capital city is the biggest city in this world, it has nearly 50 million people and a lot more in the suburbs around it. It is the center of the economic, social, and tourism worlds.

Our uncle is in charge of running the world's main server network, and so he lives in one of the best towers in the city. The tower is tall and luxurious, for my uncle likes to enjoy the riches god has given him - as he should. The thing I like most about it is the basement, where you can find a map on a screen that can zoom into any place on the planet, except The Great Desert.

The reason I‚Äôm obsessed with it is that my dad is in charge of mapping and navigation everywhere

That he‚Äôs up early sweeping the stairs and the sidewalk in front of his home or how much care he takes with the trees and flowers outside his door. 

The house just next door is also lovely. At the bottom of the stairs are two stone lions, each with a paw raised. Most people pass by, they don‚Äôt even notice them, except for the fist bump man. He must work in the same neighbourhood and every time he passes, morning or evening, he gives the two lions a fist bump and continues on. 

For years now I‚Äôve seen him pass and I think to myself, I think I‚Äôd enjoy being friends with a person like that. I watched for weeks as he passed with his arm in a sling and I wondered what had happened to him. He‚Äôs always alone as he walks by.

I have a girlfriend and I really like her. Like, I already want to marry her. We‚Äôre both seventeen and we‚Äôve known each other since we were eight.
We started dating a couple years ago and it‚Äôs been amazing. There was a point of time where we didn‚Äôt talk for a long time because we were busy. I noticed that during that time my mental health got really bad. But then we started talking again and suddenly I felt great, I started laughing and joking again. I even stopped crying as much.
I don‚Äôt know how to tell her I love her though. Like, I‚Äôve even written poems about her. We play Minecraft and Roblox together. We both like writing and art, but she‚Äôs more of a writer and I‚Äôm more of an artist. She wants to be a clinical therapist and I‚Äôm still deciding what I want to be.
She fell in love first, apparently she talked about me a lot to her friends. But I feel like I‚Äôve definitely fell in love harder.
I love her laugh, it‚Äôs my favorite thing about her. I love her writing style, it‚Äôs sarcastic but still beautiful. She prefers tea over coffee, I‚Äôm the opposite. Her favorite color is purple and her favorite animal is a wolf. She likes Greek mythology, she has a cat named Hades. Her eyes are hazel, but look more green. She‚Äôs writing a book that I‚Äôve already become a fan of. She used to take up a lot of room when she slept, but not anymore. She likes crystals and witchcraft.

1kd73ul,https://v.redd.it/y0wbycb2neye1,I made an open source multi-agent platform with auto-routing to reduce agentic AI costs,"It's called Local Operator, and it's open source and free to download!

You can use it for a lot of other things but I find it personally helpful for working with files on my device, deep research, making product documentation, fixing difficult bugs in code, and other things that bridge between on-device and web knowledge bases. It's something I initially built for myself and I use it daily.

There's an option on sign-up called ""Radient Pass"" which sets you up for all the tool integrations you need in one go and uses a model auto-router to select the best balance of cheapest and best model for the job at every step of the agentic flow.  
  
You can also bring your own key if you wish, it supports keys for OpenRouter, Tavily, FAL, and other providers if you want to build your own stack.

The agents use code as a universal tool so they can fetch data for free for you from sources like Yahoo Finance and run technicals analysis, visualizations, do local file formatting, work with large data files locally, etc

Generally it's meant to be an agents platform that, together with Radient Pass, comes ""batteries included"" with a two-click sign-in where you don't have to fiddle around or configure anything to get agentic magic happening for you. Once you train an agent to research something or to do some particular process for you, you can then tap in other agents who may ask that agent questions if they also need the same specialized knowledge, so you can create agent-to-agent workflows conversationally.

The Radient Auto mode will often save you money relative to BYOK (Bring Your Own Key) with just OpenAI or Anthropic. For the report I generated in the vid (plus manipulations, conversions, follow up Qs) it cost about $2 but in other comparable tools it can cost $6 or more. The cost savings are something that I'm continuously working on to try to make agentic AI more affordable.

You can try it with Radient Pass with $5 of credit for free (more than enough to replicate the report in the video), and get $10 bonus credit when you make your first top-up. You can also use it BYOK if you want, though using Radient Pass buys me coffee to fuel my caffeine-induced hacking and keep making the platform better üôÇ

You can try it out by downloading it from here: [https://local-operator.com](https://local-operator.com)

1kd73rp,https://i.redd.it/qmrd1apgoeye1.png,Introducing Magpie BST,"**What is this?**¬†A new option for buying, selling, and browsing pre-loved jewelry and loose stones of all kinds!

**Why tho?**¬†The reddit BST‚Äôs are great but sometimes people need other places to list when they don‚Äôt have proof of purchase. (I always recommend loupetroop in those cases, but it has always felt, to me, like we need another place to go as well that‚Äôs FREE to use, looks nice, and can be utilized by our community of sparkle lovers. We used to have Diamond Bistro also but it‚Äôs been down for so long this time, I‚Äôm afraid it‚Äôs gone for good.)

Also, I know I‚Äôm not the only one who LOVES browsing preloved jewelry but there just aren‚Äôt very many sites that aren‚Äôt also marketplaces mainly for other things, like Poshmark. This idea has been on my mind for a long time.

So with an absolute TON of help from my wonderful husband, I would like to proudly announce my attempt at a jewelry-specific marketplace:¬†[**magpiebst.com**](http://magpiebst.com/)

Magpie BST is and will always be totally free to use! Create an account and browse, or make your own listings! Any kind of jewelry or loose stones are welcome. NO proof of purchase is required - list your pieces at whatever price you would like. Transactions will be off-site, between buyer and seller, just like here on reddit.

**FAQ**:

‚ÄúCoffee, what are you getting out of this?‚Äù - Nothing except:¬†

1. another option to direct people to when they need somewhere else to go with their pieces because they don‚Äôt have proof of purchase. It happens almost every day.¬†

2.¬† The creative satisfaction of finding out that I could make an idea come to life (I could not have done this by myself. My husband did many many hours of coding work and problem solving to make the site work and look decent)

Do you take a percentage of sales? - Absolutely not. I will be completely uninvolved in your transactions.¬†

I will be enabling ads on the site, and if we break even on the cost of running the server/paying for the website itself, I will be super pleased!

Someday down the road if this goes well, I may explore offering ‚Äúfeatured‚Äù listings - like Diamond Bistro did - for a small per week fee or something along those lines.¬†

**Important Info:**

\*Make your account with an email address that you don‚Äôt mind other users seeing. This is how the site sends you your messages/chat requests/communication and the email you use for that communication will be visible to other users. (This does not need to be your paypal email address - again, that part is between buyer and seller only)

Magpie BST is still being tweaked and polished. It is not completely finished but we are ready for users and listings. (We have already invited some BST community regulars to make listings so that there would be a little bit of content to see right away that isn‚Äôt just ‚Äútest‚Äù listings.) Please check it out and feel free to send me chats/messages if you have any ideas for improvement or run into issues using the site. Currently the site looks best on desktop but should be functional, if not the greatest looking, on mobile browsers. Please let me know what you think! I want this to be another great resource for all of us magpies to enjoy buying and selling our stuff, so we can all enjoy even more sparklies!¬†¬†",7,1746207875.0,MoissaniteCreations,0,0.89,False
1kd73rn,https://www.reddit.com/r/hotsleepers/comments/1kd73rn/why_do_i_get_so_hot_when_i_sleep_lets_discuss_here/,Why do I get so hot when I sleep? (Let's discuss here),"Since we‚Äôre in this subreddit, I‚Äôm going to assume that‚Äôs a question we‚Äôve all asked ourselves at one time or another when we‚Äôve kicked off our blankets for the tenth time during the same night. In my own case, it‚Äôs come down to a couple of things:

* Perimenopause, which I‚Äôve been dealing with for a while now despite not having a period for 20 years. (Might be TMI but I had a radical hysterectomy 20 years ago, although my oncologist left my ovaries and now they‚Äôre finally dying a slow death...) I take Effexor for the hot flashes rather than HRT, which helps, although I still tend to flash a lot during the changes in season regardless.
* Thyroid issues. I have Hashimoto‚Äôs, which is an autoimmune hypothyroid disease that typically makes me cold all the time. When my meds need to be adjusted or I‚Äôm having what I lovingly refer to as a ‚Äúthyroid fit,‚Äù I‚Äôll start running hot. Like really hot. That usually only happens when I‚Äôm in an extended period of stress, but sometimes I‚Äôll just have a flare that puts everything out of whack.

As it turns out, there‚Äôs a long list of reasons why we get hot when we sleep and if you‚Äôre new to this struggle, this information is for you.

Here's what I've found:

**1. You sleep hot because of your sleep routine**

It might seem kind of obvious, but there are aspects of your routine that might be sabotaging a good night‚Äôs sleep by roasting you:

* Heavy bedding, which I‚Äôm guilty of because I prefer to be bundled under a thick comforter no matter the season.
* Sleepwear (of any kind if it‚Äôs insulating your body heat in any way)
* Keeping the room too warm
* Sleeping with a partner whose body touches yours at all. My husband hates this, but I absolutely cannot have any part of me touching any part of him when I sleep...
* Same goes for pets on the bed
* Or your bed is literally just made of lava (in that case, I may not be able to help you)

**2. Health issues**

So I mentioned my own menopause and thyroid issues, but there are many other medical conditions that can lead to heat intolerance, night sweats, or just ‚Äúrunning hot‚Äù during the day or night:

Autoimmune disease, especially during flares (lupus, rheumatoid or psoriatic arthritis, Grave‚Äôs/hyperthyroidism, hypopituitarism, among others)

* Diabetes
* Metabolic disease
* Kidney disease
* Cancer or cancer treatments
* Vitamin deficiencies (iron or B12 in particular, but B6 and D can also reduce heat tolerance)
* Infections (short or long-term)
* Fever (obviously)
* Certain medications (antidepressants, stimulants, steroids, opioids, diabetes meds, NSAID pain relievers, triptans, and plenty of others)

**3. Food and drink**

What you eat before bed can affect your body temperature when you sleep as well as spike it throughout the day. 

Anything hot, whether soup, coffee, tea, or cocoa. (Especially if you‚Äôre perimenopausal or menopausal, that can spark an instant hot flash.)

* Alcohol
* Spicy foods
* Caffeine

**4. Lifestyle**

Being an athlete could also make you a hot sleeper, which might surprise you. Athletes tend to run hot because of their body‚Äôs higher metabolic rate and they‚Äôre prone to having a high core body temperature, in general.

* Long-term alcohol use
* Dehydration
* Evening or late-night exercise, which can raise your body temperature before bed.

There are likely more I‚Äôve forgotten to add because there are just so many of them. And researching all of this made me realize that my triptan could possibly be a trigger too... I have migraines but only take meds as needed (they‚Äôre not preventative).

Have you been able to pinpoint the reason(s) why you get hot when you sleep, or are you still trying to figure it out?

I was a pretty active kid in middle school to high school (volleyball, tennis, swimming, etc etc), but at the end of my freshman year of high school up until last fall (close to 6 years), I have had around 20 surgeries.  At one point it was averaging about 1 surgery every 3 months, with 2 weeks to a month of recovery after each surgery.  Last fall I had three surgeries in one week (yikes!). This made it almost impossible to get back into an active routine before being put under the knife again. After each surgery, I would gain about 10-20 lbs and then stagnate in recovery. Whenever I would try calorie deficits mixed with tolerable exercises (walking, running, HIIT in moderation) I would remain at the same weight for three months and then be right back in my doctor's office with another medical issue. This has made losing weight and remaining active almost impossible as it seems like all of my progress is essentially erased with each surgery. On the bright side, my last surgeries have proven to be quite effective in maintaining my symptoms and it's predicted that I won't need another one for 10 years (yay!). So, here are my goals, info, and questions for y'all:

Info about me: 22F, 5'2"", 240lbs, eating around 1,800 calories/day 

Goals: I'd like to be more flexible, lose weight (cuz let's be honest, 240lbs is not helping with my medical complications lol), and feel stronger. My goal weight is 140-155lbs. I'm getting married in summer of 2027, so I would like to hit my weight goal by then. I would LOVE to be able to do things like pull ups, handstands, and the the splits! It's not just about losing weight for me, if I'm 160 or 170lbs and able to move better than I am now, I would be happy. I'm currently in healthcare and would also like to build my strength so that it is easier to do tasks like cleaning patients, lifting patients and equipment, and being able to maintain high activity where I'm actively on my feet for long periods of time. I do enjoy cardio and would like for that to be a part of some aspect of my workout routine, but not the whole of it. 

Questions: 

1. Workout routine: I have looked into calisthenics and pilates, but can't decide where to start or which, if either, is best. Based on my goals and my history, what would you recommend I try and how should I start? I want a routine that motivates me, but I don't have access to a gym and I can't afford joining a class or hiring a trainer. Ideally, I'd like a routine that is best to do at home or outside. If you have influencers or websites or youtube channels that you would recommend, I would love to take a look at them! Or, if you're willing to type up a whole routine for me, I would love you endlessly and would forever be in your debt. 

2. Diet: Is my caloric intake still too high for what I want to achieve? I have a high protein and fiber intake and typically I try to balance my meals so that its vegetables >> protein > carbs, at least for my bigger meals. I have found it most difficult to have a balanced breakfast as that is usually the busiest time of my day, so I typically eat a cup of Greek vanilla yogurt and a banana, maybe adding in a fiber one bar if I need variety. For snacks I typically eat a special K protein bar, a gomacro bar, an outshine fruit bar, or an apple with peanut butter (no more than 2 tbsp) and raisins. For lunch lately I've been eating the Jennifer Aniston salad from The Real Food Dieticians website (very yum) with a side of cut up vegetables (broccoli, cucumbers, green bell peppers, etc). Then for dinner I have a some protein (lately a salmon fillet or chicken breast) with a carb (usually a noodle, jasmine rice, potatoes, or quinoa), and a vegetable (broccoli, green beans, asparagus, or mixed salad w/avocado caesar dressing). I will take any advice about my diet. Be as honest as you would like. Truly any help is appreciated. I did see a nutritionist and she suggested the diet as described above, but I feel like it's lacking. 

3. Motivation: How do you stay motivated? It's been difficult for me to maintain a routine due to my medical situation, but I think if I have more motivation, then I would stick with it more. I do have a scale, but stepping on it every day and seeing the numbers stay the same decreases my motivation significantly. I have a partner who loses weight incredibly fast and we both have very different needs so it's difficult sometimes when I compare myself to him (or people on social media for that matter). I know, as of now, I have slow motility which makes losing weight all the more difficult and it makes this whole process feel hopeless sometimes. So any motivation tips would be great. 

4. Are there other things you do to maintain health that are not exercise or diet related? I don't drink soda or coffee (I have a coffee maybe once a month) and I drink tea daily. Are there any other tips for maintaining health? I know I should be sleeping between 7-9 hours a night. Any other tips you can think of?

Coffee isn‚Äôt doing the trick anymore despite having a relatively low caffeine tolerance.

1kd6w8r,https://www.reddit.com/r/decaf/comments/1kd6w8r/day_10_best_day_since_quitting/,Day 10 - Best day since quitting,"Hello All, 

Today has been my best day since quitting. 

Anxiety and OCD is so low I am wondering why the hell I have not done this sooner. It also feels so good and even strange having such stable and consistent energy, like literally sitting at a 6-7 without that going away or getting tired at all. Despite that, I‚Äôve definitely still had cravings for coffee in some strange way, but also not really in a way that I am entertaining. I know that I can‚Äôt go back. The anxiety I was living with was so bad that I just can‚Äôt do that to myself again. Caffeine just isn‚Äôt an option for me. 

I was feeling really depressed and low yesterday, but went for a run and it literally caused my feelings of depression to evaporate. So, it you are feeling low in your quitting journey, go exercise and sweat in the sun. It will make a big difference. 

I still feel not very sharp mentally at my job, but I am hoping that continually gets better. It feels so good to be some what free from this drug, at least more than I have been in a very long time. I‚Äôm not going back. For those trying to quit, once you hit that point when you realize that you just can‚Äôt go back, that living, or rather just existing, with that level of anxiety just is no longer an option, quitting will be easier. The past 10 days have been so incredibly difficult, but I‚Äôm definitely starting to see the light at the end of the tunnel. 

Stay strong, everyone. Every post you read on here where people say it is worth it are absolutely correct.

1kd6va8,https://www.reddit.com/r/AmIOverreacting/comments/1kd6va8/aio_coworkers_at_coffee_shop_loudly_yelling_jew/,AIO? Coworkers at coffee shop loudly yelling Jew.,"I (28M) work at a chain coffee shop, and often work with 2 people, a shift lead Dan (21M) and barista Zack (26M). Names changed. I've had problems with Dan for about a year. I feel that he is rather rude and controlling, to both my coworkers and customers alike, but Dan is well liked by my manager and my other coworkers seem split on him. They either love him or roll their eyes at him.

Recently Dan and Zack have taken to calling each other Jew. This results in them often yelling ""Jew!"" across the store at each other, sometimes in front of customers! I think this is wildly inappropriate, and in conjunction with some of Dan's previous comments towards me (telling me I have no friends, belittling/minimizing my achievements, flat-out saying he's better than me and others at the store) I spoke with my manager Rachel (31F) and filed an HR report. 

However some time has passed and it seems to me like Dan has gotten away with just a slap on the wrist. Dan and Zack haven't yelled Jew at each other, but Dan continues to make fun of customers. He has one regular in particular he really dislikes and literally outright refuses to serve him all while making fun of his forehead; surely in the service industry this is unacceptable. I find it really difficult to work with Dan in particular, less so Zack, but in conjunction I feel that they bring out the worst in each other. I feel frustrated that it seems like the HR report didn't really do much, and it looks like while they won't yell Jew at each other, I still have to tolerate Dan's combative, self-obsessed behavior on the daily.

Should I take it as a win that they aren't yelling Jew all the time? Should I just learn to tolerate Dan? Am I overreacting?",2,1746207290.0,AmIOverreacting,2,1.0,False

Whenever I get deep into work, I completely forget to eat. I‚Äôll look up at like 3 PM and realize I‚Äôve had nothing but coffee. Then I just grab whatever‚Äôs fast, which usually means junk. It‚Äôs messing with my energy and I know it‚Äôs not sustainable.

So I‚Äôm actually trying to build a tool for myself that just tells me what to eat, keeps track of it, and adjusts. Kind of like an AI version of a meal buddy. I‚Äôm still figuring it out, but the idea is to make it brainless when you‚Äôre focused and don‚Äôt want to think about food.

I'm pretty new to this hobby (been reaally into it since maybe the start of the year) and have been considering getting a refractometer (found a good price for a Difluid R2).

My thought process is: if I get one and see that my dislike/like of the brew correlates to a certain variable (say tds or EY), I can then use that observation to make adjustments to my brew and maybe even develop a preferred extraction for said coffee (i hope this makes sense lol, basically using data *and* taste to dial in).

I understand you can probably do all of this without a refractometer but for some reason the idea of actually ***seeing*** the result of my brew is appealing to me, learning about high and low extractions sounds like a good time.

Has anyone been through a similar contemplation? Do you have a refractometer? Do you use it? Any advice? Thanks! <3

1kd6rjs,https://www.reddit.com/r/appliances101/comments/1kd6rjs/can_the_bella_rocket_blender_handle_daily/,Can the BELLA Rocket Blender Handle Daily Blending Tasks? An In-Depth Review!,"**Compact and Stylish Design**  
The BELLA 35181-043A Portable Rocket Blender has a design that truly caught my eye when I first unpacked it. Its sleek and compact build is perfect for a small kitchen like mine or even a dorm room. At just 4.46"" in diameter and standing 12.84"" tall, it fits neatly into any corner without dominating the countertop. I particularly loved the plum color‚Äîit adds a playful splash to your kitchen, especially if you're tired of the usual monotonous appliance finishes. The cord wrap feature at the base ensures tidiness, which a neat freak like me truly appreciates. While it looks great, the lightweight 2.55-pound build means it‚Äôs easy to move around, but I sometimes worried it might tip over, though so far it‚Äôs been stable in use.  

**Effortless Blending Performance**  
With its 240-watt motor, this little powerhouse tackled everything I threw in it. Whether I was making a morning smoothie loaded with frozen berries or a salsa mix with tough chunks of onion, it didn‚Äôt break a sweat. The 4-tip stainless steel blade slices through ice, seeds, and fibrous fruits easily, producing consistently smooth blends. I did notice, however, that if you overload the jars, it struggles slightly‚Äîbut that‚Äôs more about user error than the motor itself. The single-speed functionality keeps things simple, and honestly, that simplicity is underrated; I didn‚Äôt have to fiddle with complicated settings to get the results I wanted.  

**Quick and Easy to Use**  
The press and twist operation on this blender makes blending as simple as it gets. You load the jar, press it into place, give it a little twist, and you‚Äôre good to go. I appreciate that there are no complex buttons or digital displays because, let‚Äôs be honest, when you‚Äôre pre-coffee in the morning, simplicity is a blessing. Cleaning was another highlight. The parts, including the blending blade and the jars, are dishwasher safe. Goodbye to the days of scrubbing blades awkwardly by hand!  

[Check BELLA 35181-043A price on Amazon.](https://applianceheaven.com/link/b0czpfpfbn/)  

**Convenience for On-the-Go Lifestyles**  
The two 13.5oz BPA-free jars with lids are a lifesaver for someone constantly running out the door. They‚Äôre sturdy and fit easily into my cup holders, making them perfect for my morning commute. I tried storing a smoothie in the fridge overnight, and the lid kept it sealed and fresh‚Äîno leaks or spills at all. This on-the-go feature would be fantastic for busy parents, students, or anyone who hates being tied to their kitchen in the morning. However, keep in mind the 13.5oz capacity might not be enough if you're whipping up drinks for multiple people.

**Highlights**  
- Compact and stylish design fits small spaces while adding flair with its plum color.  
- 240-watt motor crushes ice, seeds, and frozen fruit for consistently smooth blends.  
- BPA-free jars and lids keep your smoothies portable and safe.  

**Areas for Improvement**  
- A larger blending jar option would be helpful for making bigger batches.  
- The single-speed feature, while simple, might feel limiting for those who want more control.  

**Space-Saving and Organizational Features**  
One of the standout features for me is the space-saving design. I‚Äôm the kind of person who likes everything in its place, and the blender‚Äôs stackable parts made storing it a breeze. The blending accessories nest together perfectly, leaving my tiny kitchen uncluttered. Plus, the cord wrap effectively eliminates the annoying chain of cords taking over your counter space.  

**Alternative Offerings**  
Compared to other blenders like the Magic Bullet or the NutriBullet, the BELLA Rocket Blender holds its own pretty well. While it doesn‚Äôt have the same wattage power as the NutriBullet, it does almost everything you‚Äôd need for single-serving blends, and at a smaller size, it‚Äôs far more space-efficient. The Magic Bullet might win in terms of brand recognition, but BELLA edges ahead when considering its BPA-free jars and easy-to-clean dishwasher components. Cost-wise, it feels like a solid investment you're unlikely to regret, especially if you‚Äôre not a professional chef and just need something reliable for daily use.  

**Value Proposition**  
For the price, this blender offers impressive features, from its powerful motor to its durable, BPA-free components. Getting a product with dishwasher-safe parts, space-saving features, and a sleek aesthetic is always a win. If budget is a concern, this model strikes a nice balance between affordability and performance, though it‚Äôs worth noting that it‚Äôs tailored for individual servings rather than family-sized portions.

I'm thick/fit...Built like a gym rat with the heart of a poet. 

I'm an early bird fueled by black coffee & personal growth. Romantic, physical, intentional, outgoing introvert. I love traveling, eating, & trying new things, but home is my haven. CrossFit, running, & hiking are all important to me as is curling up with a good book. 

I like intentional men who are confident, masculine, physical, & not shy about intimacy. 

I like versatility in all aspects of my relationships. 

I'm not casual. 

Monagomous. 

I'm very active but I also know how to rest hard. 
I workout 6 days per week and run on Sundays.

I walk my dog once per day at least. 

I like to hike (leisurely), camp, kayak, bike, and play pick up sports. I also like live music (but not huge concerts), local open mic nights, and other local activities (like farmers markets and related). 

For the more calm moments of my life, I like to read, do puzzles, journal, meditate and have good conversations with close friends.

Occasionally I'm down for going to a movie or live show. 

I'm not interested in clubs, night life, bars, staying out late, bright and artificial lights.

I have all the inner wiring of a straight man who just happened to have one specific switch flipped to the other direction. My preference for a partner is the same.

1kd6o3u,https://www.reddit.com/r/BoomersBeingFools/comments/1kd6o3u/boomer_cant_deal_with_someone_sharing_public/,"Boomer can‚Äôt deal with someone sharing public space, throws tantrum","It‚Äôs early morning on a beautiful Sunday. I decided to go out for a nice walk with my dog. We go to our local dog friendly coffee shop, which has a patio, boomer guy probably in his 60‚Äôs+, sitting alone on the patio and speaking to what I assumed was somebody on the phone through AirPods or something. We have no interaction at this point.

I go in collect my coffee and get a little pastry snack to share with my dog. I go back out onto the patio and sit on a stone bench, approximately 15 feet away, but is directly in the line of sight of this boomer. dog hopped up on the bench, and I start tearing off a small piece of the pastry to give to her after she does her obligatory shake trick because she‚Äôs a very good girl. 

Boomer gets up starts walking over to me and he‚Äôs still talking, again to what I assumed was someone on the phone with him, but now I can hear more about what he‚Äôs saying  ‚Äúit‚Äôs fucking disgusting. I shouldn‚Äôt have to see that.‚Äù ‚Äúeating like dogs.‚Äù ‚Äú you really had to sit there where I can see this.‚Äù 
he‚Äôs not looking at me and so it took me a second to even realize he might even be referring to me and my dog. He walks past us to throw something in the trashcan and then walks back to his seat.

On the way back to his seat, right as he gets to where I am sitting, he picks up one of the empty metal chairs on the patio, swings it at full arm length before roughly putting it down on the bench where I‚Äôm sitting (it didn‚Äôt touch me, but it was only inches away) with a comment something like ‚Äúnow I don‚Äôt have to fucking see your face‚Äù and goes back to his seat, which is now partially blocked in view by this chair. 

As he did, this, another customer was coming out of the coffee shop with her small child and we locked eyes in shock over what just happened. She turned to him and said 

‚Äúhey that‚Äôs not very nice.‚Äù
‚ÄúWell, I wasn‚Äôt talking to you‚Äù
‚Äúyeah, but I heard what you said to that person, and it was upsetting to hear‚Äù
‚ÄúYeah, well maybe you should go take a bubble bath to calm down sugar tits‚Äù

Understandably this woman decided to leave the situation. I was in so much shock about what I just happened that I didn‚Äôt know what else to do other than finish giving my dog the pastry before pointedly putting the chair back in its correct place and going into the coffee shop to let them know about the situation on the patio. I left, but called my partner to come walk me back home because my only way home was past the patio of the shop and I didn‚Äôt feel safe. 

My partner came and got me and as we were leaving this guy walked past us: I had told my partner what had happened said that‚Äôs the guy. My partner is not a particularly tall man but definitely someone who is clearly physically fit. He spoke to this man surprisingly softly just like ‚Äúhey I heard this happen. Can you tell me about what‚Äôs going on, brother?‚Äù Boomer, completely crumpled and started backtracking ‚Äú I never hit them with the chair it wasn‚Äôt like that‚Äù lol I didn‚Äôt say you hit me I said you swung it and were verbally aggressive. Guy folds like a cheap suit and walks away. Head hung mumbling to himself. We went back to the coffee shop later and found out that they kicked him out, and he apparently was mouth open shocked that they refused to serve him, couldn‚Äôt understand why.

Guy clearly gets off on bullying people he thinks won‚Äôt retaliate and got shocked when he actually had to immediately face a consequence. All because he didn‚Äôt like seeing me give my dog a snack on a public patio. Such a childish freakout over absolutely nothing. ",30,1746206795.0,BoomersBeingFools,11,0.97,False

Does it sound like sexual assault in your opinion?,"A few years ago I met a cop after I called the police to help me get a very drunk girl home safely from the bar. I didn‚Äôt know her, and her friends left her, which is why I had no other option. 

Anyway I ended up looking him up on LinkedIn after he drove me home from the hospital (I went with him to drop her off at the hospital- she was very sick) because I thought he was cute.

I saw he was getting his masters degree in social work at a women‚Äôs college (men can do grad programs) so I thought, oh wow, an evolved cop. 

He messaged me and said ‚Äúyou could‚Äôve just asked for my number‚Äù 

And from there, we started texting/hanging out casually- while he was working, like just doing surveillance or whatever small town cops do, I‚Äôd bring him a coffee and we‚Äôd chat. 

At the time, I was trying to live a Christian life and I told him I was planning on waiting until marriage to have sex. (Even though I wasn‚Äôt a virgin I‚Äôd been celibate like 4 years at that point. I came to religion later in life) 
He thought that was so cool, where have women like me been his whole life, etc. I also, just wasn‚Äôt ready for sex in general because I‚Äôve been SA‚Äôd many times in my life and I think my new religion was a good excuse to take a long break and think about my real feelings toward sex.

Anyway fast forward to our first official date. We went out to eat and things seemed pretty normal. Keep in mind he was completely off duty. 

He asked me to go to his car with him after we ate, just to talk. 

In the car, he had a gun openly in the center console. He made no mention of it but it was in clear sight. This was his personal vehicle. 

We start kissing, and it seems like he‚Äôs trying to push it further. Being the way I am, (a trauma survivor whose instinct is to fawn or freeze) I keep trying to keep it light and just be smiley and jokey about not wanting to progress, but was still open to kissing. 

Eventually he got me to put my hand on him, if you know what I mean, and he was grabbing my head and saying to say ‚Äúyes to daddy‚Äù 

I had not given him any signal I was into this kind of thing. If I‚Äôm honest, I was torn. Part of me reacted (physically, if you know what I mean.) but mentally I knew I didn‚Äôt want this and kept saying no. I think maybe I was partially just activated by adrenaline and fear. 

It didn‚Äôt go further than a HJ. But even that I was very reluctant to do. I eventually got him to drive me back to my car. (He had driven us somewhere more private) I told him there were too many people around or made up some other excuse, because clearly my nos weren‚Äôt working and I can‚Äôt help but think maybe jts because they were not firm enough and came across as teasing or me wanting to be dominated? 

After he left and I got into my own car, I was shaking from head to toe. Physically shaking. And I felt very dizzy, like very dissociative. Feeling that way itself was super triggering to me. 

I told him he didn‚Äôt respect my celibacy (via text) after this incident, and he kept texting me. I blocked him. 

It never occurred to me until years later, that with the gun present, and his insistence, it could be assault ish? 

I read he was accused of excessive force on a little old lady a year later (while working as a cop)

It took me less than 60 seconds to walk out of the building and up a short dirt hill to an upper staff parking lot where I would often go to appreciate the view at this time. 

By the grace of God, though I was operating on less than 3 hours of sleep the night prior, I was sensible enough to carefully scan my surrounds and take note of a figure across the parking lot about 50 meters off in the distance, dimly lit as the sun was rising. I didn‚Äôt think too much of it but a woman will always feel the hair on her neck raise when she spots a man, and this time I needed those warnings more than ever. As soon as the man (who was anywhere from 6‚Äù to 6‚Äù5 in height wearing a grey hoodie pulled up) locked eyes on me he sprinted full on at me. I took off screaming desperately, falling at the bottom of the small hill and spewing my left wrist and ankle. I barely managed to make it to the doors of the ER but thankfully I made it there untouched but terrified. 
I was able to catch a glimpse of my would-be attacker as I sat crying on the ER lobby entrance floor, he followed closely behind me swiftly pacing across the lot looking around, looking for me.

I just adopted a Golden Retriever puppy at 12 weeks old. He has been a week with us and mostly been doing fine either house manners. He goes to potty to his designated area with no problem, he is learning new commands and getting plenty of sleep.

However, we are not capable of getting him to like his crate. I feed him there, I have thrown multiple treats at different times of the day. He has an exclusive treat (frozen peanut butter) that he only gets to eat there, but he is not liking at all. He has all his toys and blankies there. I also bought him a cooling pad because I thought he might be getting hot.

For naps, he goes under a small coffee table and sleeps there. If I move him while sleeping to the crate he wakes up and returns under the coffee table.

What can I do to male his crate more attractive?

For reference this is his crate;

A detailed review!,"Testing and writing about the Invigorated Water RECHARGE Parent Alkaline Countertop Water Filter Dispenser became a curious little project for me. Initially, I was skeptical about the hype surrounding alkaline water, but after hands-on experience with this product, I found it to be quite an upgrade to my daily hydration routine. Although I genuinely enjoyed using it, there were some quirks and limitations worth mentioning along with its notable selling points.

**Convenient and Modern Design**  
I have to give credit where it‚Äôs due‚Äîthe design is sleek, compact, and functional. Its 13.5''L x 8''W x 11''H dimensions make it easy to place on any countertop without taking over much space. My kitchen has limited real estate, but this dispenser fit right in next to a few other appliances. Despite its compact construction, it has a whopping 52-cup capacity, which meant I didn‚Äôt need to refill it constantly. Impressively, it sits comfortably even in fridge shelves for those who prefer colder water. The anti-slip base added stability, ensuring it didn‚Äôt budge during daily refills.  

[Check Invigorated Water RECHARGE Parent price on Amazon.](https://usedwater.com/price/b07q29s2nh/)  

**Water Quality and Filtration Efficiency**  
The performance of this dispenser was the highlight for me. With the included three pH001 filters, my tap water transformed into mineralized, pH9 alkaline water. I could taste the difference! It removed the chlorine odor that I‚Äôve begrudgingly tolerated over the years and kept essential minerals like calcium and magnesium intact. Testing it further, I appreciated that the filters could purify up to an impressive 288 gallons combined. That‚Äôs a lot of clean water without having to swap filters frequently. It‚Äôs worth noting, however, that its filtration rate was 0.15 gallons per minute, so filling a glass wasn‚Äôt instantaneous but also wasn't frustratingly slow.

**Eco-Friendly and BPA-Free Build**  
What truly sets this dispenser apart is its sustainability. It‚Äôs made from BPA-free, food-grade materials, which made me feel a bit better about what I‚Äôm putting into my body. I‚Äôve significantly cut down on plastic bottle usage thanks to this product‚Äîsaving money over time and doing my bit for the planet. As someone who was hesitant to switch from bottled water to a filtration system, this felt like the right move. It‚Äôs also backed by its membership in the Water Quality Association, which adds a nice touch of credibility.

**Ease of Maintenance and Longevity**  
Setting up the dispenser required minimal effort; I‚Äôd call it practically dummy-proof. After the initial soak and rinse of the filters, I simply popped them in and started using it. Maintaining the unit was also straightforward‚Äîjust regular cleaning of the reservoir and replacing the filters after their lifecycle. That said, I found the cost of replacement filters to be on the slightly higher side compared to some competitors. It would have been nice if replacement filters were more budget-friendly, considering the upfront investment.

**Applications Beyond Just Drinking Water**  
Although I used this mostly for hydration, it came in handy for other purposes as well. My kids loved the taste of water from this dispenser, especially compared to the slightly metallic taste we had with our tap water previously. Additionally, I started preparing my morning coffee and tea with it, and the change in flavor was undeniable‚Äîsmoother and less acidic. For anyone into cooking or baking, incorporating this filtered, mineralized water into recipes could be a game-changer.

**Positives**  
- Transforms tap water into great-tasting, high-pH alkaline water.  
- Compact design that works on countertops or fridge shelves.  
- Filters last for up to 288 gallons combined‚Äîlong-lasting!  

**Caveats**  
- Replacement filters could be more cost-effective.  
- The filtration flow rate isn‚Äôt especially fast, requiring some patience.

**Product Competitors**  
Curiosity got the better of me, so I also looked into competing products. The Brita UltraMax dispenser, for example, is a close competitor in terms of size and ease of use, but it doesn‚Äôt offer alkalinity or mineralization. While Brita focuses on basic filtration, the RECHARGE Parent elevates your water quality by adding beneficial minerals. Another option I stumbled upon was the ZeroWater pitcher, which offers advanced 5-stage filtration to remove almost all dissolved solids. However, it doesn‚Äôt preserve minerals like magnesium and calcium, which I valued in this alkaline water system. What makes this product stand out is its dual focus on purification and alkaline boosting.

**Cost-Efficiency**  
For someone looking to replace bottled water and upgrade tap water into something healthier and tastier, this dispenser feels like a worthy investment. Although it falls on the pricier side compared to basic countertop water filters, its ability to filter high volumes and boost mineral content justifies the expense. Would I recommend it for someone on a tight budget? Perhaps not. However, for improving long-term hydration habits, it feels like money well spent given the convenience and quality it adds to everyday life.

Would any helpful migraineurs weigh in with their wisdom and experience?

I've had chronic silent migraines for the past couple decades but last year they got painful almost every day, so even though I've had this condition for a long time, I haven't learned how to deal with it. What I've already done: I started HRT for perimenopause (hasn't improved the migraines, but I feel so much better in other ways). Went on buspirone to lower stress levels. Went off NSAIDs for six weeks to make sure I wasn't having rebound headaches. Quit coffee and caffeine for six weeks. Added tea back when quitting caffeine didn't do anything for me. No obvious dietary triggers. I'm waiting to see a dentist about a brux guard for my clenching, I'm seeing an RMT weekly for my tight neck, and I have botox booked for next week. I'm doing daily stretches and strength training for my back to counter tight traps. Also seeing an optometrist soon to check for eyestrain/maybe try out some special sunglasses.

Here are my questions:

\-Thanks to this sub, two weeks ago I started taking 400mg of magnesium (glycinate+oxide blend), 400mg Riboflavin, vitamin D, Fish Oil, and l-theanine (holy shit, I love the latter). Are there any other goodies I should be adding, so I don't have to waste a future appointment with my GP having her make a recommendation I could get here?

\-My doctor gave me a script for rizatriptan two weeks ago and so far it hasn't worked. Problem is I have a mild or moderate migraine most days, so this would only help for the one or two days a month when I get zingers. Problem is the zingers evolve slowly from a mild headache, so there's no optimal time to take the triptan. The two times I tried it, zero effect, but at least I got to feel drunk for eight hours. Should I be aggressive about trying different triptans, ie ask for a script for a different one next time I see her? Just to get through this obligatory, ""gotta check off the triptans"" box?

\-My current go-to is whatever otc I have on hand--advil, robaxacet, aleve, but I try to not reach for these guys more than a couple times a week. Any other otc I should add to the arsenal?

\-Is there a treatment I should push for next time I see her? I don't want to go on an SSRI ever again. Amitriptyline is a no-go with another med I'm on, but maybe I'd be willing to go off the other med. Propanolol?

Basically I'm trying to tackle this as quickly and effectively as possible so I can get back to full-time money-earning and parenting my kids. Shit's been rough. Thanks for your help! This sub has been a gem.

He was in my home state for a summer job we fell in love in two weeks. I was obsessed with him and he was obsessed with me. Four days before he left he told me he leaves back to his home state in a few days and that his ex gf is pregnant but doesn't know if it is his or the man she cheated on him with. I follow him anyway leaving everything behind moving 17 hours away for this man. I knew he was my one true love. The baby is born and he finds out baby boy is his. A few weeks go by and the baby mama finds out he has a new gf(me obviously). BM tells him be a family with me or don't be in ur sons life. He stays with me. Christmas comes around she says drop me off at his sister's to be alone on Christmas otherwise baby is not coming to his family's Christmas bc she wants to be a family and all be together without me. He doesn't agree. She continuously does this. He starts resenting me but I'm still in love. Im not used to cold falls/winters. One morning i asked if we could smoke in the car instead of the garage bc its so cold I would like the heater. The car dies. Its my fault. Ive never seen him angry before. I tell myself im being dramatic bc of my trauma and i shouldnt be scared everytime a man is angry about something. Fast forward a few months we get an apartment. I'm so happy. I've never had my own apartment before and I've also never lived with any of my partners before. I can't believe it. I love when his son comes over. I love spending time with his son. I love it so much I dream of giving him a brother. It's not our time he says. He needs to figure everything out with his first child before having another one. I'm heart broken but I understand. He cheats shortly after moving in together. I'm devastated. I go back home but cant stop thinking about him. We're texting the whole time. He's sorry he'd do anything to have me back. Two months later I come back to him. The apartment feels different but as soon as I see him I'm so happy I never stopped loving him. Over the next two years he continually cheats and we continuously break up and argue over everything. I go home sometimes and he keeps the apartment but sometimes I stay in the apartment and he goes somewhere else. I'm not a touchy or very sexual person so I have been cheated on in every. single. relationship. We get back together. After a while he's ready for a baby and wants to marry me. I'm so happy. I'm also so delusional. He's really done cheating drinking and being so angry all the time this time. I know it. No one can tell me anything. We start looking at rings and trying for a baby. I fall in love with this ring it's so beautiful. I have this overwhelming feeling that he went back for the ring later that day. He did. We are so happy and so in love. Everything is perfect. Still no sign of a baby. I get a Facebook message from this girl. She's really pretty. She wants to be my friend. I'm so happy. I don't have many friends here. We start talking everyday but never hang out. It's Wednesday night. I'm sitting next to my bf we have a trip on Saturday to this beautiful garden out of town. I buy a new outfit and get my nails done. Not only do I hope this is it this is the day he proposes but I'm also the type of girl that needs a new outfit for every occasion. We're sitting on the couch and I look over. There she is. My new friend in his Facebook messages but there messages are blank. My heart sinks but I try to convince myself it has to do with him proposing. I'm nauseaus. He falls asleep I go into his phone. There's nothing. But something is telling me keep digging. After an hour of going thru his phone I am about to give up then I remember recently deleted messages. There's hundreds of messages with my new friend. My heart sinks. She had been in my house when I wasn't there. She was sleeping with my bf pretending to be my friend. I read that originally she wasn't even trying to be my friend. They had sex and wanted to include me. She isn't bi. Thats why I never realized she was ""hitting on me"" and not trying to be my friend. Even if she did know how to hit on women I am loyal and would have never entertained. I'm crushed. I screenshot everything and send it to myself then delete the pics from his phone. I send the pics back to him and throw his phone at him while he's sleeping. He wakes up looks at the pics and runs to the closet. He comes back with the ring I fell in love with. Throws it at me. Says wtf am I supposed to do with this then?! I say idk give it to one of the b****s you been f*****g. Be tells me what his plans were for saturday. But i cant forgive him this time. We break up I stay in the apartment this time. They start dating. He never loved me. I download tinder. Three weeks into talking to this new guy I'm pregnant. I don't know if it's his or my exes. I lose the baby a few weeks later. After wanting a child for three years straight and even dreaming of it before I was ever with this man I really just lost my baby. It's his fault. This would've never happened to me if it wasn't for him. We stay broken up for almost a year. He resents me for his baby mama with holding his son for not being in a relationship with her. I resent him for repeatedly breaking my heart and tearing me down to nothing. About ten eleven months into our breakup he's on his maybe fifth girlfriend I'm still with the same tinder guy. His new gf wants him to have nothing to do with me. We haven't talked in so long but his name is still on the lease and I still have our bed. He asks to take his name off the lease and get the bed back that we got together. I had been extremely sick and had been in and out of the hospital for the last three weeks. I'm struggling to walk and have been out of work. He doesn't care. He says I can sleep on the couch. I tell him take his name off the lease but if he wants the bed that bad he can dig it out of the trash after I cut it up. Somehow we eventually decide to hang out. He sees how sick I was and immediately decided to stop pushing for the bed/taking his name off the lease. He tells me he never stopped loving me he knows he fucked up he wants me back. I just want to be loved by him. I believe him. I'm tired of being sick and alone. I just want him to come home and take care of me. He comes home. We have sex and 24 hours later I had some issues down there. I go to the doctor turns out it's chlamydia. The girl he was with cheated on him drunk in front of him and gave it to him. He is not the only person to tell me this. I take care of it. Boom I'm pregnant a week later. I'm so happy. I wonder if he's truly changed and am so happy to finally be a mama. Not only that he's finally okay with having another baby bc it's finally in a court order that his baby mama cannot withhold his son anymore. Or so we thought... she continues to withhold him. He tells me to quit my job. He starts drinking heavy every day and we start arguing A LOT. He got my new car towed away drunk driving. I lose my car. My id and birth certificate is in the car. The car wasn't even in my name yet so I could not retrieve my belongings or get the car back. He quits his job too. We lose our apartment. We move in with family. I start a new job. The drinking gets heavier. I feel in my heart he's cheating again but he's gotten really good at hiding it this time so I never find actual proof. One night he's really drunk and I'm making us dinner. We just found it were having a boy. Dinner is ready I bring him a plate to the room and start eating. He never picks up his plate then a few moments later he says I'm gonna go to the bathroom. I hear him finishing using the restroom but then he runs outside so fast he left the front door wide open. I have a bad feeling. I hear his car peel out. I run outside and he's gone. He left so fast I didn't even see him by the time I made it outside. His phone is off. Has to have wifi for it to work. I can't even call him. About an hour later and me constantly checking his location five months pregnant with his child he's at walmart connected to the wifi. I call back to back to back until the location turns off. Another hour goes by I'm distraught reaching out to everyone to see if he's there. I don't care if he's cheating at this point I just want to know the father of my child is okay and isn't abandoning us. His location updates he's an hour away at a gas station. Do gas stations even have wifi?! I call over and over and over. No answer. The location stops. Two hours go by and the location hasn't updated. I call every police station and hospital within that hour drive. Nothing. No family or friends have heard from him. I post him in the are we dating the same guy. Find put he's cheated on everyone he's been with basically and has cheated on me more than I ever thought. But nothing recently or during pregnancy. His location updates at a coffee shop three hours away still doesn't answer. I'm not the only one blowing him up at this point bc he was extremely drunk that night. Location doesn't update for almost five hours. I haven't heard from him all night haven't slept I don't even care if he's cheating anymore. I turn my location off and go to my friends house. Not even thirty minutes into being there he calls me. Where are u I'm so sorry I was drunk driving around all night I shouldn't have left like that I'm sorry blah blah blah. I'm crushed. He wants me to come home but I do not want to see him. A few hours later his sister picks me up and takes me home. He's there he won't stop apologizing swore he didn't cheat just drove around drinking all night. I have no proof but don't believe that he didn't cheat bc how could he find random places with wifi hours away in my mind someone was with him giving him hotspot. The drinking gets worse. He starts mentally abusing me every single day. Even gets physical on a few separate occasions. Not hitting physical just grabbing pushing physical. I start recording how he treats me drunk. One day I've had enough. I threaten to go back to my home state if he doesn't stop drinking and treating me like this. My family doesn't want to help me unless I use the videos against him and press charges. I can't bring myself to do it. He keeps drinking and degrading me. I accept that I should press charges and leave. He immediately starts going to AA and cleaning up his act. Not fully and not very fast but just enough for me to feel guilty for wanting to take his son away the same way his first baby mama did. He says I'm worse than her. Eventually he's fully sober going to AA taking care of me doing everything right. Except he doesn't love me. I guess I've known he doesn't love me this whole time. He's sober now but won't touch me. Doesn't make me feel loved or compliment me. Everytime we try to have sex he just can't and everytime after I think about when he was drunk calling me fat ugly and stinky. (I'm 104 pounds prepregnancy recovered bulemic) I hate the way I look now. We don't kiss we don't cuddle. He tells me he can't wait to go to work and AA to be away from me. But growing his child makes me feel even more attached to him. I want to be with him all day talk to him all day and just be loved by him. He hates my guts. He goes to sleep pissed off by me wakes up pissed off by me no matter what I do. I could make him dinner, pack his lunch, have a clean house, have everything ready for the baby, give him a massage and he still won't be happy with me. I am so excited to be a mama and would never take his child away from him. I'm stuck 17 hours away from my family. I understand his trauma from his first baby mama so I genuinely could never. Especially since it's so obvious he resents me for not being in his first child's life. I can't help but feel this impending doom that he's waiting for me to go back to work so he can leave me. He constantly reminds me he's not happy with me. I'm gonna give birth any day so it's not like I can just leave. It just hurts loving someone so much and wanting them to love you so bad but they never can. I've wanted nothing more in my life than to be a mother but I can't help feeling like everything would be better if I just died during child birth. I want my son to have the best most beautiful life and I love this man so much I can't understand why he hates me. I just want to give him his son and die. I wish I didn't feel this way but it feels like the only way for him to be happy and have his son. ",1,1746206008.0,Postpartum_Depression,0,1.0,False

This Exec Claims They Were,"In a stunning development this week,¬†[Kohl‚Äôs announced the abrupt termination of CEO Ashley Buchanan](https://retailwire.com/kohls-ceo-fired-100-days-vendors-unethical/)¬†just 100 days into his tenure. The reason? What the company described as ‚Äúundisclosed conflicts of interest‚Äù surrounding vendor transactions, uncovered through an investigation by outside counsel.

But if Brittain Ladd, a business strategist and AI supply chain management and logistics consultant, is to be believed, this scandal was not just foreseeable ‚Äî it was avoidable. And Kohl‚Äôs had been explicitly warned.

# Buchanan‚Äôs Abrupt Exit Raises Bigger Questions

According to Kohl‚Äôs¬†[official statement](https://investors.kohls.com/news/news-details/2025/Kohls-Announces-CEO-Transition-Process/default.aspx), Buchanan was fired for breaching company policy by directing vendor contracts that posed ‚Äúundisclosed conflicts of interest.‚Äù¬†[The Wall Street Journal](https://www.wsj.com/business/retail/kohls-ceo-ashley-buchanan-fired-investigation-03936a9a?mod=hp_lead_pos2)¬†later reported that Buchanan had helped secure a multimillion-dollar consulting deal with Incredibrew, a vitamin-infused coffee company founded by his former romantic partner and ex-Walmart colleague, Chandra Holt.

Holt told the Journal, ‚ÄúI‚Äôve known Ashley Buchanan for 10 years, but I have not received any compensation for my Incredibrew business from Kohl‚Äôs.‚Äù

Still, the damage was done. Buchanan,¬†[who took over from Tom Kingsbury in January 2025](https://retailwire.com/kohls-names-new-ceo/), will not serve on the board or stand for re-election at the 2025 shareholder meeting.

# Brittain Ladd Says He Raised Red Flags Before Buchanan Was Hired

For Brittain Ladd, the firing wasn‚Äôt a surprise ‚Äî it fulfilled a warning he claims he issued months ago.

‚ÄúI had no doubt that Buchanan was going to break every rule that he could at Kohl‚Äôs,‚Äù Ladd told RetailWire. ‚ÄúAnd it happened.‚Äù

On August 30th, my best friend is turning 18, and I‚Äôd love to gift him a custom art piece based on one of his favorite movies - Alice in Wonderland.


I‚Äôm looking for someone who can draw him as Alice, while still keeping his core features recognizable (face and body). Kind of like a self-insert? Ideally, I‚Äôd love something in a semi-realistic anime style, since he enjoys anime a lot. He also prefers the Tim Burton version. 


Details:

Character(s): My friend with a background from Alice in Wonderland. If possible I‚Äôd love to include a few characters from the movie too but that depends if the budget is enough. 

I have my friend's consent to share his photos for this commission. But to protect his privacy I will only share reference photos directly with the artist I choose after discussion.


Pose/Expression: Your choice!


Style: Semi-realistic/anime with Alice in Wonderland from Tim Burton. You should be able to draw my friends features good so he's recognizable though! 


Usage: This will be a personal gift. He may post it online or use it as a profile picture.


Payment: I can only pay through platforms like Ko-fi or Buy Me a Coffee. (PayPal isn‚Äôt really an option for me)


Budget: 120+ Euros. 

Please let me know if that‚Äôs reasonable for what I‚Äôm asking, especially with the background and (maybe) extra characters. I‚Äôm happy to save up and repost later if needed. 


An LGBT+ friendly artist would be good too so both sides are comfortable with the commission! I hope that's alright. 


Deadline would be 25-29th August. 


Thank you so much for reading!

I was not clear in my original post. My wife never complained about lack of non-sexual romance in our relationship. As I said, we spend a lot of time together including dates where there is no physical intimacy.

In the first years of our married life, she was sometimes overwhelmed by my high sex drive. She expressed her concern and I respected that. I feel it is normal evolution of mutual understanding and respect in any relationship. My problem is that despite knowing my sex drive, she uses it is a bargain to make me succumb to her wishes and demands. I do not have an option to disagree on any issue (small or big) -  because if I disagree, there will be no pleasure for weeks or months. It is a punishment to have a different opinion. How is that fair to me? Many times I discussed this with her and she says her mood is switched off when she is unhappy that I do not support her point of view (POV).

After I controlled my libido, she never expressed any other concerns. In all honesty, I thought she was happy as long as I agreed with her POV every time. I made effort not to engage in disagreements because it would trigger her.  Inevitably, it is normal in any relationship that there would be disagreements. 

A few weeks prior to her proposal (of being with another man in a platonic relationship), we had a big argument about an important financial matter. I did not succumb to her opinion as it was not trivial issue. I wanted a clear discussion of pros and cons before we decided on the outcome. She did not like my disagreement with her.  Again for weeks, I was punished with no intimacy and pleasure.  So, out of the blue, she comes up with the proposal of being with another man. It was sugar coated to be a platonic and non-sexual partner with whom you can be romantic but without sex. I don't believe in such things. If she really wants such relationship, why not make that effort with your husband? why another man?  It was an escalation of the punishment because blocking bedroom pleasure did not work this time. I felt it was a clear blackmail that if I disagree with her now or future, she is entertaining the thought of another partner. I better fall in line.  

As we are from a culture where divorce is rare, she exploits that security for unreasonable behavior.  How do you think I felt when my wife proposed to have an affair with another man just because I have a different opinion in our family matters? How is it respectful just because she asked me? How can I ever trust and respect her as before? No, I cannot. I thought enough is enough. 

For all those who are criticizing me -  what will be your reaction if I proposed that either my wife satisfies my high libido or allows me to venture outside? Does it make it better just because I discuss with her? Both options are a loss to her. Her trust and confidence will be shattered. 

=======

I am from India and married (arranged) 10 yrs ago. I always had a high sex drive. My wife knows about this. Unfortunately, she always uses bedroom intimacy as a bargaining chip to make me agree to her demands. If I disagree with her on any matter ( big or small ), she would not speak to me for days nor allow me get close to her. For years, I suffered this treatment.

My wife is not as sexually active as me and I can understand that. She commented sometimes that my high sex drive makes her like a sex doll and I should leave her alone sometimes. I respected that and masturbation was my go to during these times. We had sex once or twice a week and rest of time I had to DIY.  This went on for a few years. But I never thought of another woman to satisfy my desires.

About an year ago, my wife said her colleague (woman) at work has a platonic male partner who is like a husband minus the sex. They go out for dates and do a lot of things romantically but physical intimacy (kissing and sex) is not allowed. Apparently her husband knows about this and is okay with it. My wife asked me if I am okay with this concept. I felt a slap across my face. I said I cannot think of how this okay or acceptable. I felt cheated and I explained my emotions and feelings to her clearly.  She did not expect that level of reaction from me. She said ""it was not her intention to go down that route. It was just a question.. blah blah blah""  but I knew she was lying. It was clear that she wanted intimacy from another man. It was just packaged as a non-romantic platonic friendship.  I was confused because as a couple we spend a lot of time together regularly- coffee dates, holidays, movies, dinner dates, adventure sports, events and so on. Then where is the need for another person? If she has decided to discuss it with me, I felt she already crossed the mental barrier of monogamy. In an unbelievable manner, she turned the blame on to me. As I was not meeting her needs, it is only fair for her to look for intimacy outside. I said ""What? what about all the talk about sex doll etc"" and her response was "" that was then, this is now "" .. whatever!

That day I changed. I never felt the same level of trust or respect for her. All these years, I suppressed my sexual needs to respect her feelings. And she thought it would be okay to involve another man.  I felt I was unfair to myself. There was no need for me to suppress my needs to her anymore. And so it started .. In this internet age, it was easy for me to find sex outside. The first time I was very nervous. I knew I was cheating on my wife and I did not want to do it but I wanted to do it because I felt I was already cheated. I wanted to prove to myself that it was not me who was not meeting her needs... it was the her! The girl I saw gave me an unforgettable experience. Thats it.. I had tasted pleasure in another form and I was hooked. The 2nd time was easier and by the next few visits, the betrayal feeling disappeared from me.

In the last 10 months, I must have gone out more than 50 occasions. I know it is wrong but I enjoy the kick.  I am addicted to the excitement before and the post nut clarity + repentance later. Rinse and repeat! My wife has not spoken about that platonic friendship again. Our relationship has not been the same. She knows the damage that her discussion has done. We cannot separate as our kids need us and our culture does not allow us to divorce that easily. Good thing is that I don't argue much anymore because I know she cannot punish me in the bedroom anymore.

I just wanted to blurt it out as it has been on my mind for a while. Irrespective of my wife's position, I know I am in the wrong.",2,1746205691.0,TrueOffMyChest,1,1.0,False

On August 30th, my best friend is turning 18, and I‚Äôd love to gift him a custom art piece based on one of his favorite movies - Alice in Wonderland.


I‚Äôm looking for someone who can draw him as Alice, while still keeping his core features recognizable (face and body). Kind of like a self-insert? Ideally, I‚Äôd love something in a semi-realistic anime style, since he enjoys anime a lot. He also prefers the Tim Burton version. 


Details:

Character(s): My friend with a background from Alice in Wonderland. If possible I‚Äôd love to include a few characters from the movie too but that depends if the budget is enough. 

I have my friend's consent to share his photos for this commission. But to protect his privacy I will only share reference photos directly with the artist I choose after discussion.


Pose/Expression: Your choice!


Style: Semi-realistic/anime with Alice in Wonderland from Tim Burton. You should be able to draw my friends features good so he's recognizable though! 


Usage: This will be a personal gift. He may post it online or use it as a profile picture.


Payment: I can only pay through platforms like Ko-fi or Buy Me a Coffee. (PayPal isn‚Äôt really an option for me)


Budget: 120+ Euros. 

Please let me know if that‚Äôs reasonable for what I‚Äôm asking, especially with the background and (maybe) extra characters. I‚Äôm happy to save up and repost later if needed. 


An LGBT+ friendly artist would be good too so both sides are comfortable with the commission! I hope that's alright. 


Deadline would be 25-29th August. 


Thank you so much for reading!

Been single for over 3 years after my last relationship ended badly, and honestly, I just needed that time to work on myself.

Last week I matched with this girl (29F) who seemed really cool. We've been texting back and forth, and after some good conversation, I finally worked up the courage to ask her out. She said yes to coffee this Sunday!

Here's the thing, it's been so long since I've been on an actual first date that I feel like a complete rookie again. My friends keep telling me it's okay to feel this way, but it feels so weird idk. We've had great text chemistry so far. She's into photography and hiking (both things I enjoy), and has a really awesome sense of humor. I'm genuinely looking forward to meeting her.

I spent the last few years focusing on my career and finally paid off my student loans last month (which felt amazing), but my dating skills definitely got rusty in the process.

Any advice for someone getting back into dating after a long break? How do I shake these nerves? Should I suggest an activity afterward if things go well or is that too much for a first meetup? Thanks everyone!",52,1746205508.0,dating_advice,5,1.0,False

Hello! Sorry for the long wait, but chapter 5 is finally here! I got caught up with some stuff, but I should be able to post more regularly now. Thank you all for your patience!

**Memory transcription subject: Lampry, avali pilot and technician**

**Date\[Standardized Human Time\]: March 7th, 2147**

That was probably the worst sleep I had gotten in awhile. While the temperature was rather comfortable, the bed, *if you can call it that* was as solid as an ice sheet, with only two pillows on one side of it. Avali beds were designed to cradle the entire pack. A bed was unique to a pack, with it being adapted as the pack grew to adulthood. While This ‚Äú*bed*‚Äù was certainly large enough for the pack, it was nothing more than a glorified box on stilts. The room was also especially quiet, with only the noise of the powerful air-conditioning unit to keep us company.¬†

We stirred from our groggy rest and tried to stretch out of our sleep. Despite our morning moodiness, we appreciated the second-to-none hospitality the aliens showed us. The room was clean, the fridge was stocked with ammonia bottles, and we had all the amenities we could need. I noticed my visor on the nightstand, its notification light Illuminated. I put it on, there was a message from David telling us to meet him and Velsia in the lobby for breakfast. The hotel staff were able to install an ammonia tank for our room, so we were able to shower before putting on our heat suits and heading downstairs.

There was a caf√© in the hotel lobby, with David sitting at one of the tables.

‚ÄúHello! You guys have a seat!‚Äù David greeted us, ‚ÄúI hope you all slept well?‚Äù

‚ÄúEh, it could honestly have been better,‚Äù I admitted.

‚ÄúI am sorry to hear that, what was wrong?‚Äù

‚ÄúJust the bed really, avali beds are much softer, and they are structured differently,‚Äù I explained.¬†

‚ÄúWe will get that fixed then!‚Äù David assured, ‚Äúfor now, Velsia has brought something to remedy that drowsiness.‚Äù

I saw the venlil walking up to the table holding a drink caddy containing four strange bottles, ‚Äúwe figured out how to brew coffee using ammonia!‚Äù she exclaimed, ‚Äúthese bottles are able to adapt with your suits, so you can drink normally!‚Äù

I looked at her, puzzled, ‚Äúwhat is coffee?‚Äù

‚ÄúIt's a hot caffeinated herbal beverage from the human homeworld,‚Äù she explained, ‚Äúyou should be able to drink it, but please do tell if you are at all unsure.‚Äù

Despite us being carnivores, herbal teas were a staple of avali culture back on Avalon. The concept was not foreign to us.

‚ÄúSo similar to tea, correct?‚Äù Ky‚Äôwi had shot up from his drowsiness, ‚ÄúI will take anything with caffeine right now!‚Äù

Velsia was surprised by the sudden enthusiasm, ‚Äúoh, well here you go!‚Äù She handed us each a bottle.¬†

I raised The bottle to my mask, and sure enough it made an audible *click* as it connected to the suit. My tongue was hit by a rich, warm scent that emanated up the suit's straw. I was cautious with my first sip, worrying that it may be too hot. As the liquid passed over my tongue, I was met with a taste like no other at the perfect temperature. It was a perfect blend of bitter and savory, untarnished by not even a hint of sweetness. I looked up from the bottle to see my packmates equally astonished by this taste of liquid gold.

The caffeine had set in and we felt much more energized. The ‚Äù*food*‚Äù that was brought out was not nearly as good as the coffee. It was liquefied nutrients that had to be drunk through a straw. It satisfied my hunger but not much else. We did manage to discuss letting the aliens sample our lab grown meat, so that better meals could be prepared down the road.

After breakfast, we were guided to a tunnel that led to the Sapient Coalition building on Skalga. David explained that the tunnel was both for security reasons, and to prevent us being swarmed by the press.¬†

As we walked, David and Velsia detailed out the interview process. It would be split into two parts, private and public. The private interview would have us meeting with scientists, doctors, historians, and security personnel who will study and scrutinize every detail about our species, while also info dumping us about the rest of the galaxy and its history. The public interview will have us in front of cameras discussing diplomacy and culture with the governor of Skalga, and a representative of the Sapient Coalition.

We reached a set of double doors at the end of the tunnel, the words *‚ÄùLower Lobby‚Äù* were inscribed above them. The door opened to an expansive room, with other doorways around its perimeter that presumably led to other important buildings. There was a reception desk at the center of the room with a venlil receptionist Conversing with a quadrupedal alien in a white coat.

He looked over to us from his conversation, ‚ÄúAh, you must be the new arrivals,‚Äù the small four-legged alien stated, ‚Äúmy name is Dr. Braely, I'm a Zurulian with the Galactic Institute of Medicine, I will be doing your physicals.‚Äù

The four of us took turns introducing ourselves to the Zurulian Doctor. He then led us to a ramp that brought us further down a level. We stopped at a door that had a protective suit hanging on the wall next to it.

‚ÄúWe made some modifications to some of the rooms here, to accommodate your unique biology,‚Äù Dr. Braely said as he equipped the suit, ‚ÄúI can wear this to keep me warm, and you can take off your suits once you are safely inside.‚Äù

We flicked our ears in acknowledgement. Once we were in the room with our suits off, we each got examined and asked questions. The physical was not too dissimilar from the one I received before getting my pilot's license back on Avalon, besides the few extra questions and tests that were to get a better understanding of avali biology. When it was Ky‚Äôwi's turn, the biologist couldn't help but have a full blown conversation with the doctor, asking each other a litany of questions.¬†

‚ÄúSo many interesting different species,‚Äù Ky‚Äôwi stated with awe, ‚ÄúI will certainly be busy with study and research for a while.‚Äù

After the physical, Dr. Braely guided us back up to the lobby to meet back up with Velsia and David.¬†

Velsia wagged her tail as she saw us, ‚ÄúAlright! with that out of the way, we can finally have a cultural information exchange and a rundown of galactic history.‚Äù

We were guided to a meeting room with a TV at one end. Velsia pushed a button on a remote to start a video. The information we were given was both fascinating and horrifying. If we had arrived just a few years earlier, we would have been hated entirely on lies. *Explains the volatile reaction from Nebza.* I have mixed feelings when it comes to the Arxur, as it seems the rest of the galaxy does as well; I feel it best to stay out of any involvement with them, if possible.¬†

Hearing of the atrocities committed by both the Arxur and the Federation, stabbed an aerogel shard into my soul. A part of me wishes the Illuminate had discovered the situation to intervene. Yet I could easily see that going awry. I had to tell myself that the past was the past, and the best we could do was to help out now.

The video was coming to an end. I was hit with the realization that the decisions made by my pack in the coming days, would directly affect how our species is introduced to the galaxy. While this was the goal we had set out on, the weight of this responsibility was finally beginning to set in.

Velsia and David reentered the room with another new face, a Zurulian who wasn't Doctor Braely. David wheeled away the TV, as Velsia and the Zurulian turned to face us.

Velsia addressed the pack, ‚ÄúWith that out of the way, I would like to introduce Doctor Jo‚Äôeva.‚Äù

‚ÄúHello, I'm Doctor Jo'eva, a psychologist with the Sapient Coalition. I Am aware you have met my brother, Doctor Braely.‚Äù

*‚ÄùDoctors Jo'eva & Braely‚Ä¶‚Äù* I noticed Ky‚Äôwi mumble to himself, making a mental note for later.

‚ÄúThe video you just watched,‚Äù the Zurulian continued, ‚Äúwhile it was primarily informative, it also served as your empathy test.‚Äù¬†

I recognised the name of the procedure from the video. I was puzzled as the example the video gave seemed much less pleasant. As if to read my mind, the doctor answered my unverbalized question.

‚ÄúCompared to the example in the video, we have been able to make the process less invasive, and less traumatic for the patient. With that said, I am proud to announce that you all passed with flying colors.‚Äù

After Doctor Jo'eva's explanation, the usually quiet Fel‚Äôdari was the first to ask a question.

‚ÄúThe video made it seem like empathy tests were a federation era practice. I had thought you were trying to distance yourselves from that ideology.‚Äù

‚ÄúThat‚Äôs a good question,‚Äù Doctor Jo‚Äôeva stated, ‚Äúwhile there is a constant drive against federation ideology, change can't happen overnight, and ideas, especially ones based on fear, tend to linger for generations. On top of that, some federation loyalist groups are floating around the galaxy.‚Äù

That last comment from the doctor seemed to put a look of concern on the face of the usually hard to read Fel‚Äôdari. After a small round of minor questions we each had for Doctor Jo‚Äôeva, we were moved to the digital library across the hall. We didn‚Äôt have time to do any major research; however, we were able to get good starts on topics that piqued our interests. Ky‚Äôwi researched some of the extremophile species and wildlife, Eikako looked over different star charts, While Fel‚Äôdari and I familiarized ourselves with different diplomatic traditions and customs to prepare ourselves for the public interviews to come.

**Memory Transcript Time Forwarded: 2.5 hours**

Our study window had concluded; we were ready to meet with the governor and SC ambassador. After the typical bit of security theater, which was just David and Velsia verifying that we are not a threat, we were moved into a cooled room to prepare for the interview. The interview would be conducted in a cooled room. We could wear our traditional pack garments for the galaxy to see. I huddled with my pack as we prepared ourselves to make history. David, who we figured out was a high ranking security officer, had come into the room to finally bring us face to face with the governor.¬†

‚ÄúHope you guys are ready!‚Äù David said.

‚ÄúReady as we‚Äôll ever be,‚Äù I responded as we were guided into the formal press room.

Off to my right was an array of cameras and microphones sporting the logos of different alien news agencies. In front of me was a set of four chairs. This was followed by a table holding what appeared to be a decanter surrounded by six ornate glasses. Further ahead of that of course, sat the governor himself. Next to him was another new species, a yotul I believe they are called, an SC ambassador. They both had on protective clothing, but their faces were exposed. Both had heaters directed at them.

The governor gave a formal ear flick as we approached, ‚ÄúHello, I am governor Cheln, it is nice to finally meet you!‚Äù

We responded with our own formal greetings as the governor directed our attention to the SC ambassador.¬†

‚ÄúAnd this is ambassador Kanna, she is with the Sapient Coalition.‚Äù

‚ÄúIt's great to meet you!‚Äù Kanna said as she extended her arm in the ‚Äòhandshake‚Äô greeting that was usually used by humans. I mirrored the greeting followed by the rest of my pack.

‚ÄúHave a seat,‚Äù Cheln directed, ‚Äúlet's get this started.‚Äù

We each took our places as the governor poured us each a drink, finishing with himself. While I did find it odd that a head of state would drink in the public eye, I am also not one to turn down a free drink.

‚ÄúThis alcohol was made right here on Skalga, I have selected it as it is one of my personal favorites and it can be consumed as-is without worrying about temperature,‚Äù he explained as he sat back down.

I took a sip from the glass, and it nearly hit me like a speeding snowmobile. I tried my best to keep my composure, hoping the reaction would at least not show on camera. I looked up to see Cheln down a gulp of his drink with nothing more than a satisfied sigh. *By the Oracle! What are these venlil made of?*

‚ÄúLampry,‚Äù Cheln paused in brief thought, ‚Äúwell.. I guess I shouldn't ask if there is a more formal way I can address you?‚Äù

‚ÄúI don't¬† understand what you mean,‚Äù I responded.

‚ÄúWell, some species have a second name they prefer in formal settings,‚Äù he explained, ‚ÄúI guess your response answered my question.‚Äù

That did sound similar to how we use pack names. ‚ÄúWell, if you want to address my pack as a whole, you can use our pack name, Ka‚Äôroe,‚Äù I explained, ‚Äúas pack leader, I will respond on my pack's behalf.‚Äù

The governor thought for a bit before the idea seemed to click in his head, ‚Äúok then Ka'roe, what brings you to Skalga?‚Äù

‚ÄúExploration and scientific discovery; pursuing the question of ‚Äòare we alone?‚Äô‚Äù I answered.¬†

‚ÄúWell I hope you got the answer you were looking for.‚Äù

‚ÄúA surprising answer, but a welcome one.‚Äù

Kanna leaned forward with a follow up question, ‚Äúbut why Skalga? How did you not come across any of the other habitable planets between Avalon and here?‚Äù

‚ÄúWell, because of our unique biology, we ended up looking in the wrong places,‚Äù I explained, ‚Äúthe only reason we made it to Skalga was because of its night side.‚Äù

‚ÄúI guess Skalga is a magnet for first contact,‚Äù Cheln commented, ‚Äúis your expedition government funded, or do you work for a company?‚Äù

‚ÄúWe are actually an independent pack, but we sell data to the Illuminate, and share our findings with allied packs.‚Äù

‚ÄúWait, what is the Illuminate?‚Äù Kanna asked.

‚ÄúOh right! The Illuminate is the central government of Avalon, many packs and tribes are members, though we are independent.‚Äù

‚ÄúSo is the Illuminate something we should be concerned about, would they be open to diplomacy?‚Äù

‚ÄúThe short answer to both those questions would be no. The Illuminate chooses to remain isolated, you won't talk with them any time soon,‚Äù I explained, ‚Äúbut that also means if you don't bother them, they won't bother you.‚Äù

‚ÄúWhat about some of the independent packs or tribes?‚Äù Cheln followed up, ‚Äúdo you recommend any that might be more open?‚Äù

‚ÄúThat is exactly what I was wanting to get to!‚Äù I stated with excitement, ‚Äúthere is one pack we are close allies with, Kaejull, who we are supposed to be meeting in just a few days. There are quite a few packs on their ship, the Celestial Spear.‚Äù

‚ÄúThat sounds like a great starting point,‚Äù Kanna said with intrigue.¬†

‚ÄúAnd now that I think about it, I believe there may be some Illuminate packs on board the Spear, so you may not be entirely out of luck with them either!‚Äù

‚ÄúWell that's even better! This has turned out to be a great first contact,‚Äù she turned to Cheln,¬† ‚Äúdon't you agree governor?‚Äù¬†

We painted the walls Swiss coffee white and am stuck on what to do with the baseboards/trim/doors. I absolutely love the cream colored contrast but it makes the stairs a sticky situation as we are not able to change out the stair bannisters.

I‚Äôm not sure if I can explain clearly so pardon if I use the wrong terminology. Above are pics of our stairs. I want all the trim and doors  to be a light griege color, but if you look at the stairs, I am unsure how to continue this grieve color up the stairs. The balusters are white and at its bottom end, it is connected to white wood. This was how the house was built (I checked on Zillow. all similar floor plans had this white wood that was cut and then tread and risers made of wood put in next to it.) ideally I‚Äôd remove the whole stair bannister but we don‚Äôt have the budget for that. We are replacing the tread and riser to be the same as the new hardwood we are placing in the entire house.

It is much easier to call it a day and just do white trims to match the stairs but I am so in love with contrast trim. I just don‚Äôt know how to incorporate it into the stairs.",4,1746205281.0,HomeDecorating,1,1.0,False

(he was married with kids.) Basically he said his kids were his sisters and that he helped her with them since she was a single mum, as for his wife he told me she died from cancer. (Sick bastard I know) When I finally found out the truth I nearly drank myself to death because of the guilt. I reached out to his wife to apologise. She surprisingly accepted and we became best friends, life‚Äôs fucked up but thankfully his wife went on to divorce him and is now with and amazing guy and his kids don‚Äôt speak to him anymore and call his wives new husband dad. 

Thank you for the lovely responses I appreciate it (:

I‚Äôm going to add some context as I‚Äôve had some negative messages/some confusion 

As I said in the post he told me he was widowed, he would come to work crying telling me all about the grief he was going through because of his wife‚Äôs passing. (He lied about his wife I wasn‚Äôt aware he was bs) I felt bad. So I tried be a good person and be there and listen and offer support. Unfortunately yes over time feelings did develop, it was wrong and I know/knew it. I‚Äôm not ‚Äúplaying the victim‚Äù I‚Äôm far from a victim in this his poor family were/still are. 

There was never any inappropriate behaviour in the workplace. He would ask me if I would meet him for coffee on days off so he could vent to me. I would say yes thinking this poor guy is reaching out for help. He made the first move not me. I just fell for him.

‚ÄúHow did I not know about his family it‚Äôs obvious‚Äù 
Because he never spoke in detail about them. He had pictures of them but not altogether. One was a picture of his wife on her own and others were him with the kids and extend family members. When he told me his wife died from cancer i didn‚Äôt want to bring her up thinking I don‚Äôt want to make him even more upset so I didn‚Äôt ask questions about her unless he brought her up to me. As for his kids he portrayed himself as the fun uncle who was a stand in father figure, so again I didn‚Äôt question it as it seemed genuine l had no reason to question it.

**>>RECEIVED DOWNLOAD COMPLETE ON APRIL 22, 2025**

Hey Mom, Dad‚Äî And, uh, hello to my future wife and hypothetical kids (if you‚Äôre digging through old transmissions one day)!

Just wanted to let you all know I made it up here safe. Pisistratus Station is‚Ä¶ well, let‚Äôs call it ‚Äúindustrial chic.‚Äù My habitation cell‚Äôs about the size of my old freshman dorm‚Äîminus the window, minus the door handle, and plus a constant low hum I haven‚Äôt quite figured out yet. Still, it‚Äôs home for now, and I can't complain.

Before we docked, I got a glimpse of the platform. I had no idea how massive it would be. The whole base is built into this rotating ring system‚Äîlike a wheel half-buried in the dark side of the moon. They said it turns at a fixed rate to create a centrifugal force that simulates Earth‚Äôs gravity. You can‚Äôt feel the rotation from inside, but knowing it's happening gives you this weird sense of motion in the back of your brain. The size of the platform blew me away‚Äîit must be at least a kilometer wide, maybe more. They didn‚Äôt really cover¬†*that*¬†in the training videos. It‚Äôs like living in a giant, quiet machine.

Sorry for the short notice on the departure. Once the company pushed us through our specialization certs, things moved¬†*fast*. One day you‚Äôre learning how to realign hydraulic lock seals in VR, and the next you‚Äôre vacuum-sealed into a shuttle bound for the far side of the Moon. They gave us a week‚Äîenough time to pack a duffel, sign a few papers, and say goodbye without thinking too hard.

Don‚Äôt worry though‚ÄîI'll make sure to snag some moonrocks for everyone. Maybe even some deeper core samples if I get in good with the miners. Some of them are already swapping stories about weird strata shifts and mineral anomalies‚Äîjust harmless tall tales, I‚Äôm sure.

I‚Äôve got orientation briefings in the morning‚Äîstation safety, maintenance protocols, door calibration standards. Nothing too wild. I‚Äôll send more when I get a better lay of the place.

Love you all. Tell the dog I miss him.

Alrighty‚Äîhope everyone‚Äôs cozy back home, tucked in, maybe sipping coffee or watching something dumb on TV. Up here‚Ä¶ it‚Äôs still night. Technically.

I found out that the far side of the Moon doesn‚Äôt really¬†*do*¬†mornings. When we docked, they told us it was ‚Äúnight‚Äù. Turns out, we‚Äôve got another ten days of darkness to go. Fourteen days of night. Fourteen of daylight. Like a celestial switch.

And the telescope? Yeah, you can forget that‚Äîthis side of the Moon never faces Earth. Not even a shimmer. Something to do with the rotation rate of the Earth and Moon mixed with their orbits. It‚Äôs just black sky and stars out there. Honestly, it‚Äôs beautiful, but it also feels‚Ä¶ heavy. Like the whole sky‚Äôs pressing in.

Anyway, I promised you updates, so here we go. Today‚Äôs briefing was actually kind of awesome. We learned why the station‚Äôs named¬†*Pisistratus*. He was some old-school Athenian leader‚Äîbenevolent, they said. Supposedly ushered in a golden age, redistributed land from the elites to the common people, built up the arts and the temples.

I guess that‚Äôs why so many of us are up here. Not just scientists, not just astronauts‚Äînormal people. Mechanics, janitors, miners. I might be the only one in my habitation sector with a degree, and it doesn‚Äôt even matter. That‚Äôs kind of the magic of this place‚Äîeveryone‚Äôs useful. Everyone has a job.

The miners especially‚Äîrough folks, but some of the highest-paid up here. They say the core‚Äôs rich with rare isotopes. Stuff you can‚Äôt even find in Earth‚Äôs crust anymore. I heard a guy say one of the new mines has veins that¬†*pulse*‚Äîprobably just a figure of speech. Right?

I got my assignment! I‚Äôll be stationed near the western airlocks, just off the corridor leading to Mine 7B. It‚Äôs a quieter sector‚Äîlower traffic. I monitor a bank of cameras, run diagnostics, cycle door tests. Six doors, one tech, one long hallway.

Honestly? I‚Äôm excited. There‚Äôs something kind of peaceful about it out there. Real quiet.

Anyway, more tomorrow. Love you guys.

Hey guys. Sorry I didn‚Äôt get a message out yesterday‚Äîit was‚Ä¶ kind of a whirlwind. Spent most of the day clearing out my little office nook near the West Wing airlocks.

You know, I figured everything up here would be sleek, futuristic, that kind of thing. But honestly? Some of my equipment feels like it belongs in a museum. My camera monitors are chunky old CRT-style boxes‚Äîno touchscreens, no fancy heads-up displays. The feeds are weirdly grainy too, with this low hum in the background. Like they‚Äôre running off‚Ä¶ older tech, I guess. I even had to dust some of them off.

Controls are tactile‚Äîclunky switches, big metal toggles. Kind of retro, which would be charming if there weren‚Äôt serious cases where a door could cycle improperly, and all of our oxygen is sucked out.

Yesterday I had to do a servo repair on Door 3. Nothing too wild, but it was different from what the crash course taught us. Wiring was off. Slightly older schematic. Still‚Äîpressurized doors are pressurized doors, right?

Today was quieter. Almost peaceful. I considered walking back to my habitation cell early and writing this, but I stayed in the office and fiddled with the terminal a bit.

Good news‚ÄîI got one of the IT guys, Ethan, to help me clean up the interface. He‚Äôs only been here a couple months longer than me, but he‚Äôs sharp. Showed me a bunch of back-end menus, some override protocols I didn‚Äôt know I had access to. Emergency lockdowns, remote seals‚Äîsome of it felt... above my clearance, if I‚Äôm being honest.

He said it‚Äôs standard now, that they updated things a while back. But the way he said ‚Äúupdated‚Äù was weird. Like the system's been layered over¬†*something older*.

Honestly, the computers themselves run pretty quick. Maybe they‚Äôve just got new guts inside old shells. Kind of getting the feeling that it‚Äôs how it is with this whole station, now that I think about it.

On a lighter note‚Äîcafeteria absolutely¬†*slapped*¬†today. Real apple pie. Not rehydrated, not vacuum-sealed‚Äîactual, warm, fragrant pie. I was sitting there wondering if that technically makes it a moonpie up here. Or‚Ä¶ maybe a moonpie up here would just be called a pie and the ones back home are the frauds? Got caught in that loop for a while.

Anyway, I‚Äôm clocking out soon. Crew from Mine 7B‚Äôs scheduled to return tomorrow. I‚Äôll be on door control‚Äîopen, cycle, seal. Easy stuff.

Gotta stay rested, even if all I‚Äôm doing is pushing buttons. Love you guys always.

Okay. Today was cool, but I have some questions.

The mining crew came back a little early‚Äînot an issue. The outer door camera showed them pulling up in the large buggy with a bag about the size of me, probably stuffed with ore and rare minerals. It looked‚Ä¶ uncanny, the way they hopped toward the airlock platform with the bag drifting behind the guy carrying it. Like it was deadweight, but not¬†*heavy*.

They keyed in the activation code, then radioed the keyphrase to my room, and I hit the confirmation. The base‚Äôs announcement system echoed through the halls, alerting everyone to the gravity shift. The low hum of the station‚Äôs rotation slowed until it stopped, locking into position with the platform.

Two of the miners lifted the bag as they entered. Cycling began‚Äîoxygen restored, pressure stabilized. Then centrifugal rotation spun back up. Gravity settled.

That‚Äôs when one of the miners lost his grip.

His side of the bag dropped to the floor with a force I could¬†*feel*¬†through the feed. There‚Äôs no sound on the cameras, but I swear I heard the thud in my chest. A dark liquid sprayed out across his boots and pooled fast.

It was thick. Not hydraulic fluid. Not oil. Something else.

Within seconds, Research techs in yellow badges were sprinting past my hallway viewport with a cart. I glanced back to the monitor just in time to see them load the bag‚Äîquick, methodical. Way too smooth to be their first time.

I stood to get a better look as they wheeled it past my window. Down the hall. Out of sight.

No one said a word about it. Not during check-in. Not in the logs.

I know it‚Äôs probably nothing. Ore can leak, right?

I hope nothing poisonous was in the liquid that got on the floor, but they cleaned it up pretty quickly, so I‚Äôm sure it's safe.

Anyway‚Äîtonight I swapped out my bedding and noticed a huge black, maybe brownish, stain on the mattress underneath. The look of it reminded me of the leak from the bag.

So, three things:My bed‚Äôs been used and the stain looks pretty fuckin old. Two‚Äîthe mining crews are supposed to work in teams of six. Only three came in with that bag. And three‚ÄîI hadn‚Äôt really thought about it until now, but‚Ä¶ why do they need both a code¬†*and*¬†a keyphrase just for me to let them in?

Why lock a door that tightly unless there‚Äôs something we‚Äôre trying to keep out?

Time to sleep before I overthink it. This kind of stuff is above my pay grade. Love you.

So‚Ä¶ two more of the crew came back today?

They didn‚Äôt have a vehicle. I watched them almost robotically leap across the lunarscape toward the keypad podium. No buggy, no extra gear. Just the two of them, silhouetted against the black horizon.

They keyed in the code and gave the keyphrase over the radio‚Äîquiet, raspy, almost like their comms were breaking up. I hit the confirmation key.

The announcement sounded, gravity slowed, oxygen cycled, they came in.

Fifteen minutes later, my supervisor shows up. Doesn‚Äôt knock, doesn‚Äôt greet me‚Äîjust asks why I stopped the centrifuge.

I told him about the crew, the radio call, the docking procedure. He just‚Ä¶ stared at me. Like I‚Äôd said something wrong. Then turned around and walked out before I could even ask.

I watched him cross the corridor outside my window at a brisk, determined pace, speaking into his radio the whole way.

Don‚Äôt get me wrong‚ÄîI was worried. Still am. But no one‚Äôs said anything. Not to me, anyway.

It‚Äôs been a few hours now, and we just entered a lockdown drill.

Except they¬†*really*¬†stressed that we treat it like the real thing.

Doors sealed, motion lights off, auxiliary power only. No one in or out.

Something about the phrasing‚Äîthe tone‚Äîit wasn‚Äôt just a drill. It felt more like a warning.

I don‚Äôt know what‚Äôs going on.

Mom, Dad‚Ä¶ I‚Äôm scared.

It‚Äôs been about three weeks since my last log. I had to wait. I had to survive.

I used the 14 days of light. That‚Äôs the only time it‚Äôs safe to move around.

They don‚Äôt come out as much when the sunlight hits the exterior corridors. I think the windows‚Äîthose thick, curved panes‚Äîact like traps.

They just stop and stare, motionless, when the beams catch them.

But the inner corridors? The ones without windows?

No light reaches there.

There‚Äôs no stopping them there.

The bigger rooms‚Äîthe ones with skylights‚Äîwere safer.

For a time.

I managed to reach Ethan from IT on the short-range comms link in my office. A few times.

While he was still alive‚Ä¶

The last time we spoke, he said he‚Äôd been sleeping in the hydroponics atrium during the lightshift. That dome gets full sun exposure during the light days.

It kept him safe from the things.

We didn‚Äôt talk often, but early on, he told me enough to make some guesses.

The team leads. The high-clearance personnel.

They‚Äôre not on base anymore.

I remember it now‚Äîclear as day.

The night of the lockdown, I was already in bed when the alert came through:¬†**Centrifugal Halt ‚Äì Platform Synchronization Inbound.**

I thought it was just another drill. I waited for the hum to return. For the soft sway of gravity to resume.

But it never came back.

Ethan told me later that week. He saw it‚Äîthrough a corridor window after he‚Äôd cracked open his cell door.

The Emergency Return shuttle lifted off from the south platform.

While we were still in full stop.

They left us here.

*All of us.*

Before I knew any of that, I‚Äôd already floated back to my office‚Äîhalf an hour of low-G silence behind me. Something felt wrong, even though I hadn‚Äôt yet realized the shuttle had left.

I keyed in my credentials. Accessed the override protocols.

I started by checking why the centrifuge hadn‚Äôt restarted. Why the platform hadn‚Äôt cycled.

But then I saw it.

The south platform wasn‚Äôt the only door with an administrator override.

The research corridors glowed orange‚Äîpathing active. Three internal doors were blinking red.

Not cycled.

Locked shut.

The only way to clear an administrator override is with a full facility reset.

That would cycle every exterior door. Re-engage gravity. And unlock every single pressurized passage across the station.

I didn‚Äôt do it.

But someone else did.

Another door tech, I‚Äôm sure.

I‚Äôm not responsible for this.

I understood what it meant when I saw the research facility manually locked down.

I understood.

Something was in the station that we couldn‚Äôt let spread.

When all of the doors unlocked, they clambered out.

Shambling¬†*humanthings*.

I‚Äôve seen them in person now.

Incomprehensibly grotesque.

Rotted. Necrotic. Elongated joints, with hanging jaws and stringy hair.

They move like they‚Äôre searching.

Like they‚Äôre remembering.

I know they‚Äôre remembering.

Because Ethan still comes to the locked door at the end of corridor R

‚Ä¶and stares through the camera.

Straight at me. I can see his mouth moving, rambling, but I won‚Äôt go near the door.

I have to go for now.

Without many of the engineers, the station's gone into auto-backup mode. A few generators are about to cycle on in a couple minutes.

And even though I‚Äôve locked off the corridors between my cell and my office‚Ä¶ When that noise kicks up, they get agitated.

I‚Äôve got a little crawlspace behind a panel in the office I hide in, in case one of them manages to open a door again.

Pray.

I wasn‚Äôt supposed to find this. But I did.

For days now, I‚Äôve been unlocking and relocking the admin corridors‚Äîwatching, waiting. The human things, they don‚Äôt remember their paths. They wander, bumping into walls or sealed doors, some drifting into new hallways before I shut them off. There‚Äôs one that drags a broken leg behind it, like a sack of tools. I timed its circuit through Sector D. When it was far enough down the hall, I made my move.

The door to Administrator Roan‚Äôs office was locked with a four-tier system‚Äîno easy bypass. I‚Äôve cracked two before‚Äîmaintenance overrides buried in the diagnostic logs. But this one‚Ä¶ it had a special key gate.

I thought I was screwed. Then I remembered something: Roan‚Äôs quarters.

I wasn‚Äôt shocked to find a few administrators left behind. The station layout, combined with the timing of the outbreak and subsequent evacuation, made it feel inevitable. What I didn‚Äôt expect was what I found in Roan‚Äôs quarters.

Her facility suit lay discarded on the floor, the remains of her body still inside, like she‚Äôd been eaten from the inside out. The suit‚Äôs fabric clung to her like a half-formed cocoon, and what was left of her‚Ä¶ I don‚Äôt even know how to describe it. Soft tissue, sloshing in my hands. I had to pry her keycard free from the inner lining of the forearm. It took a few minutes‚Äîand a lot of gagging‚Äîbut I got it.

When I made it back to the office and slotted the card into the master terminal, I thought it was all over. I was wrong.

That‚Äôs when I saw it.

A system-wide communications lockdown had been enacted during the final centrifuge cycle, just before the Emergency Return shuttle launched. Personal comms had been rerouted. Every outgoing message from standard personnel accounts was flagged as ‚Äúnonessential‚Äù and dumped into a queue.

They‚Äôre all still here.

Every message. Every cry for help.

Not just mine. Hundreds of them.

Audio. Video. Text logs. Some people were still recording even after the power started to fail in their sections.

Some of the messages are just static and sobbing. Others... Some of them talk about things that don‚Äôt make sense. Worse than what I‚Äôve seen.

There are names I don‚Äôt recognize. One man‚Äîsecurity, I think‚Äîkept saying he heard them whispering in the walls. That they knew his name. And that they remembered him.

I opened my own log queue. It was there. Everything I‚Äôve said to you. None of it ever left Pisistratus Station.

I sat there for a long time. Listening. To everyone. To no one.

There‚Äôs a backup transmission command on Roan‚Äôs computer. A hardline. The problem is, I have a list of thousands of servers to send transmissions to. I can manually clear the queue of each flagged log, but I don‚Äôt know which servers to send them to.

I think I have no choice but to send everything out. I‚Äôm hoping for help. I‚Äôm unable to establish a direct line to Earth‚Äîevery company line seems halted. I believe we were told that each transmission takes a week to reach Earth.

So, tomorrow, I‚Äôll send everything out. Today, I‚Äôll reroute some doors, maybe raid the cafeteria again. I should be good for months if I stay quiet.

I love you, Mom. Dad. I‚Äôll be home soon. ‚Äì Leon

I enjoy talking to new people and I guess I'm just interested in exploring and seeing what's out there. I'm seeking new chat friends mainly and to just see where things go from here. Also looking to start my masters this summer. All in all, I'm excited to see what the future holds.

I'm fit and work out daily. I especially like to do distance running and I'm getting stir crazy waiting for it to warm up so I can jog outside in the sun! I love camping and traveling as well. Unfortunately there's only a few good weeks of weather for the outdoors where I'm at, but I'm determined to make the most of it this year! Watching movies, reading, going to museums, appreciating art and music are some of my favorite hobbies/interests. I mostly listen to punk but I'll listen to anything from classical to rap. I also like to try new wines when I watch movies. Despite the sheer cold where. I live, I always have a cold brew coffee in the morning.

I recently got into baking and would definitely be interested in any recipes you have. I'm still a beginner but I've really been on a kick for it lately. Tea is something I'm also looking to explore deeper as well.

Working on trying to design a few more tattoos to add onto my arm. Been considering getting a neck tattoo but I figure taking awhile to make a decision isn't a bad thing in this case haha.

If you're interested in chatting, let me know more about you and feel free to send a song you've been listening to on repeat or an art piece that you enjoy. Hope to hear from you! ",1,1746205048.0,r4r,1,1.0,False

I am starting to feel the difference in areas (bras fit better, undies a little lose, less foot swelling and belly bloat.  My goal is another 54 lbs so pretty happy with things so far. 

Don't restrict my diet as I tend to undereat already, so bringing my calories up to 1400 with at least 100 grams of protein.  My sugar intake is low, so back to eating a little carbs (cereal, pasta, or bread).  Seems like I was doing everything wrong until I had several meetings with a nutritionist back in 2023.  The mochi nutritionist was great also and gave me a lot of tips. 

Things I noticed: I don't like coffee anymore (switched to herbal tea), have sugar cravings (which I have rarely had.  Natural food Suggestions to replace bad foods, currently snack on cereal or fruit).

Mochi shipments: had the delay like everyone else, but did receive.  Currently trying to place an order but the site keeps saying I do not have a default payment online (which I do).  Messaged them and told them to push the order through. 

After gaining 50-60lbs during a horrible marriage in my 20s, hypertension since I was 27, lost 2 immediate family members at 47 and 55, being diagnosed with metabolic disorder, PMR, and sometimes dobilitating sacroiliitis, I finally feel like I can get this weight off. I was never a candidate for surgical weight loss, and the other RX's were horrible.  

Really thank Mochi and other companies out there for making affordable products for us.  As someone that has a disabled husband that just had open heart surgery last year, glad I can afford all of his medical expenses and still take care of me.

## **Before the Coffee Gets Cold by Toshikazu Kawaguchi**


In a small back alley of Tokyo, there is a caf√© that has been serving carefully brewed coffee for more than one hundred years. Local legend says that this shop offers something else besides coffee‚Äîthe chance to travel back in time. Over the course of one summer, four customers visit the caf√© in the hopes of making that journey. But time travel isn‚Äôt so simple, and there are rules that must be followed. Most importantly, the trip can last only as long as it takes for the coffee to get cold.

I'm going to campaign very hard over the next month on Instagram and what not to try to sell as many as possible. Who knows, maybe 300% funded isn't out of reach.

I'm looking to make a coffee brand to pair with the Crowka Pot. I think I want to throw a smallish bag of beans in with every order, even the ones sold already.
Does anyone know any roasters in North Carolina or slightly beyond that would want to collaborate? Any digital artists want to take a crack at a bag concept or an improved box design? Any thoughts on the guitar music I played in the video?

OK, so I recently moved, which means that I had to go find a new doctor. I was really dreading it because there‚Äôs so much ignorance when it comes to ADHD medication especially if you take Adderall. The new doctor that I‚Äôve been seeing in both of our sessions, she asked me if I considered taking anything else besides Adderall, which of course I said no because that‚Äôs been the only thing that works for me. She also stated that I shouldn‚Äôt drink soda, coffee, tea, or energy drinks as it can make things worse but nobody that has adhd even uses that to help them focus. The last appointment that we had, I was prescribed the worst manufacturer for Adderall, which is Mallinckro. I‚Äôve been having horrible side effects with that. 


I had an appointment with her two days ago, and I told her that I wanted to go to my preferred brand teva. When she sent in script to the pharmacy, they did not have Teva extended release however they did have Teva in the immediate release 10 mg. When I called the doctors office to tell them the receptionist called me back instead of the doctor stating she did not want me taking immediate release and she did not give a reason. When I asked why the receptionist said that he was not sure but she said that I could either find a new provider, find a pharmacy that does have 10 mg Teva extended release or make an appointment with her as this was a different type of medication. 

This is really pissing me off because now I‚Äôm having to call around all these different pharmacies when my pharmacy that‚Äôs literally 10 minutes away from my house has teva 10 mg just immediate release. I requested a callback from her and the provider would not call me back which I thought was just rude considering that she didn‚Äôt give me an answer for not filling it in the first place This is honestly making me really want to switch providers as I don‚Äôt even know why she won‚Äôt feel the immediate release in the first place.

With the **Breville BES500BSS1BUS1 Bambino Plus Espresso Machine**, this ritual has become seamless, delivering rich espresso shots that rival what you'd find in high-end coffee shops. The compact yet sleek stainless steel design initially caught my eye, blending perfectly with other kitchen appliances while saving counter space.

**Design Perfection Without Compromise**
Measuring 7.6"" x 12.5"" x 12.2"", the Bambino Plus fits neatly in my kitchen. Its brushed stainless steel finish not only adds a polished look but also resists smudges, making it incredibly easy to clean. It‚Äôs lightweight, which I appreciated when repositioning it, but that did require steadying the machine with one hand while removing the portafilter. Small trade-off for such an elegant design that doesn‚Äôt feel overwhelming in my limited space.

**Optimal Performance for Everyday Use**
Operating this machine has been a breeze, thanks to its intuitive button controls. From single or double cup options to adjusting the steam for milk frothing, every function is easily accessible. The ThermoJet heating system, which heats up in just three seconds, is a game changer‚Äîespecially in the early rush of weekday mornings. And while I‚Äôm still working on my latte art skills, the automatic microfoam milk texturing produces creamy, velvety foam perfect for cappuccinos and lattes alike.

[Check Breville BES500BSS1BUS1 price on Amazon.](https://idealcoffeeshop.com/price/b07jvd78tt/)

**Highlights**
- Compact and space-saving design.
- Heats up incredibly fast with the ThermoJet heating system.
- Automatic microfoam milk texturing enhances flavor and texture.
- The auto-purge functionality keeps the system ready for consistent shots.

**Balancing Benefits with Limitations**
This machine truly excels in consistency. Its PID digital temperature control ensures optimal water temperature for each extraction, providing balanced espresso with an even crema every time. However, the included portafilter is on the lighter side, and you might want to consider upgrading for improved handling. For all its strengths, there‚Äôs also the automatic purge system, which, while handy, quickly fills up the drip tray‚Äîrequiring frequent emptying during busy mornings.

**Challenges**
- The machine's lightweight design means it may not feel as sturdy when operating the portafilter.
- Auto-purge tends to fill the drip tray quickly, requiring extra attention.
- Some creativity might be required to tailor milk texturing settings initially.

**Market Rivals**
When comparing the Bambino Plus to competing models like the Gaggia Classic Pro or Delonghi Dedica, its efficiency and simplicity stand out. While the Gaggia Classic Pro might appeal to enthusiasts who enjoy manual control, the Bambino Plus feels designed for those who want professional-grade results without the manual tinkering. The Delonghi Dedica is slightly more compact but can‚Äôt match the Bambino's advanced heating and milk texturing functions. Let‚Äôs just say, if you‚Äôre after barista-level coffee with minimal effort, the Bambino Plus has a definite edge.

**Cost Assessment**
Considering its sleek build, features such as the precise microfoam technology, and its ability to replicate caf√©-quality coffee, I believe this espresso machine offers exceptional **price-to-quality ratio**. It‚Äôs not the cheapest but offers a value that feels entirely justified.

While there are espresso machines that cost significantly less, their lack of consistency, performance, or overheating issues often overshadows the saved dollars. Investing in the Bambino Plus once could save you from frustrations in the long run.

I‚Äôm in a bit of a rut because my skin has gotten noticeably worse in the last few months that I‚Äôve significantly upped my sugar intake. Specifically breakouts on the upper neck and jawline. I wonder if it‚Äôs because I‚Äôm not always consuming sugar in isolation, for example having a ton of sugar in coffee with skim milk or a handful of dates/fruit with a bit of Parmesan. 

I‚Äôm a 27 yo female for reference. I know acne is a thyroid/hormonal issue, but I don‚Äôt know what else to adjust in my lifestyle for my skin to clear up. I eat no seed oils (only very occasionally) , prioritize sun/red light, only use lye soap and castor oil as skincare, do lymphatic drainage several times a week, take 400mg mag glycinate and 300mg benfotiamine per day, supplement collagen and gelatin, and still nothing. I also take progesterone every during luteal leading up to my period. And these are all things I‚Äôve been doing more or less for the last year or more and it seems my skin has only gotten worse in recent months. I also change out my pillowcase every couple of days. 

My other thought is, I blow glass and am in the hot shop at least 6 hours per week, the whole time I am typically sweating as it‚Äôs 85+ degrees in there. I try to rinse my face off afterwards but sometimes I forget and wait to shower when I get home.

This Exec Claims They Were,"In a stunning development this week,¬†[Kohl‚Äôs announced the abrupt termination of CEO Ashley Buchanan](https://retailwire.com/kohls-ceo-fired-100-days-vendors-unethical/)¬†just 100 days into his tenure. The reason? What the company described as ‚Äúundisclosed conflicts of interest‚Äù surrounding vendor transactions, uncovered through an investigation by outside counsel.

  
But if Brittain Ladd, a business strategist and AI supply chain management and logistics consultant, is to be believed, this scandal was not just foreseeable ‚Äî it was avoidable. And Kohl‚Äôs had been explicitly warned.

# Buchanan‚Äôs Abrupt Exit Raises Bigger Questions

According to Kohl‚Äôs¬†[official statement](https://investors.kohls.com/news/news-details/2025/Kohls-Announces-CEO-Transition-Process/default.aspx), Buchanan was fired for breaching company policy by directing vendor contracts that posed ‚Äúundisclosed conflicts of interest.‚Äù¬†[The Wall Street Journal](https://www.wsj.com/business/retail/kohls-ceo-ashley-buchanan-fired-investigation-03936a9a?mod=hp_lead_pos2)¬†later reported that Buchanan had helped secure a multimillion-dollar consulting deal with Incredibrew, a vitamin-infused coffee company founded by his former romantic partner and ex-Walmart colleague, Chandra Holt.

Holt told the Journal, ‚ÄúI‚Äôve known Ashley Buchanan for 10 years, but I have not received any compensation for my Incredibrew business from Kohl‚Äôs.‚Äù

Still, the damage was done. Buchanan,¬†[who took over from Tom Kingsbury in January 2025](https://retailwire.com/kohls-names-new-ceo/), will not serve on the board or stand for re-election at the 2025 shareholder meeting.

# Brittain Ladd Says He Raised Red Flags Before Buchanan Was Hired

For Brittain Ladd, the firing wasn‚Äôt a surprise ‚Äî it fulfilled a warning he claims he issued months ago.

All right, here it is ‚Äì please tear it apart!


Riptide

The scent hit him first‚Äîdark roasted beans, the ghost of cigarettes from a more permissive era.

""Just one?"" asked a waitress he didn't recognize, notepad in hand.

His gaze drifted toward the window, where afternoon sun spilled across the table‚Äîtheir table‚Äîilluminating a familiar scratch on its wooden surface. ""No."" The word emerged rough-edged, unpracticed. ""I'm meeting someone.""

He took his seat like a choreographed act on stage. He pondered over his cup of coffee. The city of angels had grown horns since he'd been away.

The bookstore where he'd waste hours thumbing through Bukowski and Miller was now some pretentious art gallery showcasing what looked like finger paintings. A juice bar now occupied the space where he'd once nursed whiskeys until dawn. The record store had surrendered to some boutique chain brand.

The only piece of history left unmolested, The Knight Owl. This weathered cafe stood defiant, its peeling sign a middle finger to the relentless tide of gentrification.

The waitress returned, setting down a coffee he hadn't ordered, black and steaming. ""Doing alright over here?"" Something flickered behind her eyes. Curiosity, perhaps. Or the particular brand of pity reserved for men who sit alone at tables for two.

""Just fine, thanks."" His smile never reached his eyes‚Äîa professional courtesy, like signing a receipt. She lingered a beat too long before turning away, her movements betraying interest beneath professional detachment.


""I don't remember you ordering another cup.""

Sarah took her seat across from him, light catching in her hair as it fell across her face. That half-smile playing at the corner of her lips‚Äîthe one that always preceded trouble.

He pushed the untouched cup toward the empty space before her. The porcelain scraped against wood. ""Black, just how you don't like it.""

Her laugh rippled through him‚Äîa well-worn vinyl record whose grooves he'd memorized through repetition. ""You never did learn that coffee isn't supposed to taste like punishment.""

Sarah leaned forward, elbows on the table, chin resting on interlaced fingers. ""So the prodigal son returns to the city of fallen angels."" Her voice dropped to a conspiratorial whisper. ""What finally dragged you back to this hellscape?""

""Job interview. Editor position at Apocalypse.""

""The literary magazine?"" One eyebrow arched. ""The one you always were reading?""

He nodded, watching as she didn't touch her coffee.

""Look at you, all grown up and selling out."" Mischief danced in her eyes, quicksilver and dangerous. ""Does this mean you're moving back? Becoming a permanent fixture in the landscape of Los Angeles again?""

The question hung between them, heavy as approaching thunder.
The caf√© speakers crackled to life with that Vance Joy song‚Äîthe one about riptides and being taken away. Cosmic punchlines delivered with impeccable timing.

""I haven't decided."" The lie tasted metallic on his tongue. He had decided. The words just refused to crystallize in his throat.

A glass of water appeared at his elbow, condensation beading its surface.
""It's getting pretty hot out there."" The waitress's voice pulled him back to the present, her eyes lingering on his face. ""Thought you might need this.""

""Thanks."" He looked up, really looked this time. She possessed that effortless California beauty‚Äîskin kissed golden by the sun, eyes amber like whiskey catching firelight.

""I'm Clarissa."" Offered unprompted, with a smile that reached her eyes. ""I'm relatively new here. Both the coffee shop and L.A.""

""Welcome to purgatory."" The quip earned him a genuine laugh.

""That bad here?""

""Worse."" His fingertip traced a water droplet's path down the glass. ""But you'll learn to love it anyway. Stockholm syndrome, but with better weather.""

As Clarissa walked away, Sarah's eyebrow arched in amusement. ""She's into you.""

""Don't start.""

""What? I'm just saying, she's cute."" A pause, weighted with intent. ""And alive.""

He flinched. Involuntary as a heartbeat.

""That's not fair,"" he whispered, the words barely disturbing the air between them.

""Fair left the building a long time ago, sweetie."" She leaned back, adjusting nonexistent sunglasses. ""Around the same time you did.""

Through the window, that new art gallery stood where Murphy's Books once welcomed literary pilgrims. Despite his initial contempt, something about its vibrant exterior caught his attention. Life, continuing without permission.

""You know,"" Sarah said, following his gaze, ""that place actually looks interesting. They're showing an exhibition on urban decay and rebirth. Very on-the-nose, but you'd probably like it.""

The light shifted imperceptibly, shadows lengthening across their table. Hours had evaporated, lost in conversation.
""You never told me how you've been,"" she said suddenly.

""You never asked.""

""I'm asking now.""

He studied her face‚Äîreally studied it‚Äîand the familiar ache bloomed beneath his ribs. ""I've been... existing. Moving through time. Writing words nobody reads."" His fingers tightened around the empty cup. ""Missing things I can't have.""

The song played again, as if caught in a loop. I wanna be your left hand man...

""You always were dramatic,"" she said, but her voice had softened, its edges worn smooth like sea glass. ""Remember what I told you the last time we sat here?""

He remembered. Every syllable branded into his memory, permanent as scars. ""You said I needed to stop playing it safe."" The words emerged grudgingly. ""That Los Angeles was eating me alive, and I needed to go before there was nothing left.""

""And?"" She pried.

""And I went.""

""But did you live? Did you do anything that scared you? Or did you just change locations and keep the same fears?""

Clarissa approached again, hesitating at the edge of his peripheral vision. ""You've been coming here every Tuesday for a few weeks now... always at this same table.""

His head snapped up.

""I just noticed the pattern,"" she explained, a flush coloring her cheeks like watercolor bleeding into paper. ""I don't mean to intrude.""

""You're not."" Sarah watched him silently now, wearing that expression he could never quite decipher. The untouched cup of coffee before the empty space had gone cold, a small monument to absence.

""Do they always stand you up?"" Clarissa's filling curiosity finally poured over the edge, ""It's just... You're always expecting someone but I've only ever seen you by yourself.""

""I should get going."" His hand reached for his wallet, a retreat disguised as practicality. ""What do I owe you?""

Clarissa shook her head, copper highlights catching in her hair with the movement. ""No, it's on the house today."" Giving him the most visceral smile he's s seen in a while.

He stood, suddenly uncomfortable with the weight of everything unsaid. Through the window, he could see the small bronze plaque installed outside the art gallery‚Äîformerly Murphy's Books, dedicated to the memory of Sarah Murphy, whose passion for literature touched countless lives.

""Thanks,"" he said to Clarissa. ""Maybe I'll see you next Thursday.""

Hope and caution tangled in her expression like competing currents. ""Maybe you will.""

The California sunset hit him full in the face as he stepped outside, harsh and unforgiving as truth. Behind him, the coffee shop stood as a monolith to what was. Before him, the city sprawled in all its reinvented glory, a testament to what could be.

Sarah was gone. Had been for ten years. But somewhere in that liminal space between memory and moving on, he still found her at their table, still heard her voice urging him toward the thing that terrified him most: a future without her in it.

Through the window, he watched Clarissa clear the table‚Äîone cup empty, one full. For a moment, he thought he caught Sarah's reflection in the glass, smiling that smile that always meant trouble.",1,1746203892.0,writers,4,0.67,False
1kd5hc2,https://www.reddit.com/r/CoffeeMakerReviews/comments/1kd5hc2/should_you_buy_the_mecity_kc101_coffee_maker/,Should You Buy the Mecity KC101 Coffee Maker Review for Your Kitchen Needs?,"The Mecity KC101 Coffee Maker entered my kitchen a few weeks ago, and I‚Äôve been using it daily since then. As someone who operates on coffee in the morning and tea in the evenings, it's like this product was built with my routine in mind. It's a sleek, modern machine designed to brew coffee, prepare tea, and even accommodate instant coffee. With its sturdy build and compact design, Mecity KC101 checks a lot of boxes. But, while I‚Äôm pretty satisfied, there are definitely some nuances to consider.

**Design and Build Quality**  
At first glance, this coffee maker has a polished aesthetic. Its stainless-steel finish gives it a high-end vibe, and the silver and black color scheme fits into my kitchen effortlessly. Measuring only 6.3 inches wide and 10.6 inches tall, it‚Äôs a blessing for small spaces. My countertop real estate is always a premium, but this model doesn‚Äôt hog space. Plus, with a light 4.6-pound frame, it's surprisingly portable. That being said, the buttons don‚Äôt give that slightly satisfying tactile click I appreciate in other appliances, but they do get the job done.

**Effortless Usability with Smart Features**  
Using the coffee maker feels like operating a device designed with simplicity in mind. Fill up the removable 1.5L reservoir, pop in a coffee pod, hit the brew button, and your steaming cup is ready in under two minutes! The smart flow management system is quite effective‚ÄîI‚Äôve tested all three brewing sizes (6, 8, and 10 oz), and each option delivers consistent results. Want some loose-leaf tea instead of coffee? The three included filters make it easy. I just added my favorite Earl Grey loose leaves, and voila! 

[Check Mecity KC101 price on Amazon.](https://tastefulcoffee.com/p/b09x1shwmg/)

**Performance and Brewing Speed**  
I‚Äôve used this coffee maker during breakfast rushes and in those ""I-need-coffee-right-now"" moments, and it hasn‚Äôt let me down. Brewing any of the three selectable cup sizes‚Äîwhether 6, 8, or 10 ounces‚Äîtakes about 60 to 100 seconds max. It's shockingly fast, saving me precious time in my busy schedule. The taste quality is consistent, too, as the flow management system ensures no weak or watery brews. That said, the brewing noise can be a tad louder than other brands I‚Äôve tried. It‚Äôs not deafening, but if someone‚Äôs sleeping in the next room, they might grumble.

**Good Points**  
- Compact dimensions are perfect for small kitchens and even travel.  
- Brewing options for coffee, tea, and instant coffee cater to versatility.  
- Quick brewing time ensures no unnecessary waiting.  
- BPA-free materials in the water tank and needle are a thoughtful touch.  
- Cleaning mode simplifies maintenance with vinegar and water descaling.  

**Areas of Concern**  
- Slightly noisy brewing operation compared to quieter models.  
- Buttons feel a bit less premium than the rest of the machine.  
- It‚Äôs not compatible with larger coffee mugs above 6.3 inches tall, which limits choices.  

**Maintenance and Cleaning**  
Cleaning this machine is straightforward‚Äîjust remove the drip tray and filter basket, give them a wash, and you're good to go. There‚Äôs also a dedicated descaling mode. Trust me, I put this feature to good use after I ignored my machine post-vacation. I followed the descaling instructions (no coffee pods, brew six cups of hot water), and the coffee maker was as good as new. The use of BPA-free materials for the water tank is a bonus, especially when you‚Äôre concerned with health and safety.

**Competing Products**  
This Mecity model inevitably invites comparisons to similar products like Keurig K-Mini and Hamilton Beach FlexBrew Single-Serve. While I appreciate Mecity KC101‚Äôs ability to brew tea just as efficiently as coffee, the Keurig K-Mini has an edge with its quieter operation and more polished button interface. On the other hand, the Mecity KC101 outshines the FlexBrew with its brewing speed and sleeker design. Both its compactness and multi-purpose filters give it a functional nod that's hard to ignore.

**True Value**  
Evaluating value for money is always tricky, but this coffee maker seems worth its cost given its features. If you‚Äôre looking for a multi-functional device that brews your coffee quickly and handles tea when you need it, this is a solid deal. Its minor shortcomings, such as a slightly noisy operation and mug size limitations, feel forgivable when compared to its flexibility and brewing quality at this price point.

1kd5gmp,https://www.reddit.com/r/BadBosses/comments/1kd5gmp/boss_yelled_at_me_today/,Boss yelled at me today.,"Basically just using this subreddit to scream into the void but if you happen upon this and have any comments or suggestions, I'm welcome to it lol. 

TLDR: our scheduling software had a bug or something in it today where it wouldn't allow me to log in and kept telling me my password was wrong. Usually, the system prompts every 90 days to change it at log in but I didn't get any sort of prompt to do that so at this point I'm chalking it up to a system problem. I go tell my boss and ask her to please log in so we can get the till up and going so I can call the help line to get my password taken care of. She looks at me and snidely goes, it's probably because you're typing the wrong password. I wasn't. So she gives me a temp password to reset mine and I go to log in with it and it still says incorrect password again. So I shout out to her that it's not working and she comes out and is like, let me watch you. So she watches me, said that I added an extra 'a' so I clear the text box and start all over again to enter a new password. Still doesn't work. Repeat a couple times, repeat. When it finally does sort of work, it tells me that I can't use the same old passwords but because I need a fairly quick and easy password to access my system, I just use the same password and change a number, as the system has allowed me to do since I started almost two years ago. So then I change it to a completely new, unused password and it *still does the same thing.* She then starts raising her voice and telling me I'm adding all these letters and numbers to the temp password but I'm certain I'm not then she boots me out of the chair to do it herself. At this point, I'm getting frustrated and sigh heavily and 'slam' my plastic coffee cup on the desk. Should I have done that? No but I'm literally getting yelled at and trying not to lose my shit and get myself fired. It's then my boss tells me I can leave for the day so I say, fine. She says something that I don't really remember in the heat of things but I explain that I'm trying to be communicative and offer solutions so we can get the business open but she's not hearing me out so yes, I'll leave. Then she says, yeah you should leave cause if you can't even log in, I don't know what you're doing.

I've literally never had a boss talk to me like this. Ever. I'm in my 30's, obviously not super old but I've been working since I was 15 like a majority of us so to say that this is the worse treatment I've experienced in my entire work life is pretty insane. I've also never been sent home from a job before, especially over something so trivial. 

I wrote down our entire interaction and plan on going back to work later to talk to her boss. Which I should have done a long, long, LONG time ago. Ugh. What a day and its only 10:30

After a few late nights and probably too much coffee, I built this weird little system where the AI picks its brain based on what you ask it. Kinda like having a smart assistant that knows when to use a calculator vs. a supercomputer.

The results blew my mind:

‚Ä¢ Everything still works perfectly (actually better in some cases)

‚Ä¢ It's weirdly fun to watch it choose different models

\* Burning through credits like crazy

\* Using GPT-4 for stuff my phone's calculator could handle

\* Manually switching between models (super annoying)

\* Having no clue which model was best for what

How I Fixed It:

I built two parts:

1. A ""chooser"" (using a super cheap model) that decides which AI to use
2. The actual worker who does the task

The tech stuff

\* Open Router (game changer for accessing different models)

\* Make (for all the automation stuff)

\* Slack (so I can chat with it)

\* Google Sheets (to see what's happening)

Some real examples that made me laugh:

Asked it to tell me a joke:

\* It picked Gemini 2.0 Flash (the free one)

\* Cost: basically nothing

\* Got the response in like a second

\* The joke was decent!

Asked to write a research post:

\* Switched to Claude 3.7

\* Costs a bit more, but way less than before

\* Came back with this super detailed thing

\* Even did its web research!

The funniest part?

However, I passed a little orange cat who had been hit by a car in the turn lane by the Adventist Church and the Credit Union. They seem to be pretty in tact still, but the longer they lay there they're just gonna get run over again and again and lay in the road alone :( I realize they are already dead, but the cat is likely missed by someone out there. It looks like my childhood cat and makes me sad. 

I would pick it up myself but I rent and I have no where to bury them. Is there someone I can call to come get the cat ? I don't want it to lay there and become a flattened pancake. People drive like assholes here and this could have been avoided.

It can happen a couple times a week or I can go months without it happening.

It wakes me up- I feel like my chest is tight or heavy, I start sweating profusely, my heart is racing and I can feel my heart beating in my head, head feels full(not sure how to describe it) and I have shortness of breath. This usually last just a few minutes and will slowly go away even though I still feel funny for a while after. 

I usually lay in bed and go through it but last year when I had one, I got up and ending up puking. Went to my doctor and they did blood work and ekg and the doctor pretty much said it could be night terrors. I do have anxiety but it doesn't feel this way when I do and I just dont think it's anything mentally.

This morning it happened and I sat up to sit in front of the fan. But then I felt sick so got up fast to go to the bathroom and fell down and started to black out. My heart was beating so hard and my clothes were soaked. It eventually passed but my head has still felt kind of funny since. I then had some diarrhea (not sure if it's related)

I have an appointment later today and am going to ask about a cardiologist referral. Im not good at advocating for myself but I'm really wanting to get this figured out.

1kd5d61,https://www.reddit.com/r/espresso/comments/1kd5d61/ascaso_duo_vs_lucca_a53_mini_budget_2800_us/,Ascaso DUO vs Lucca A53 Mini [budget $2800 US],"I've got a BBE that's 9 years old - never had a single issue.  I'm looking to make a significant upgrade to a new grinder and machine that will give me cafe-quality results and will also be a reliable long-term workhorse.

I am planning to pair the new unit with a DF64g2.  I roast my own beans every week or two and do regular, decaf, dark, light and everything in between, so I'm hoping for a machine that's  not too hard to dial in.  I make espresso drinks with and without milk (caps and lattes), along with pour overs (which is why I'm picking a grinder that can handle it all).  The espresso machine will likely pull 2 or 3 doubles a day on average.

Because there are other people in the house, simple operation (with volumetric controls) is a must have.  Thus, I'm down to two main options here listed in the title.  There's also a Bezzera DUO DE around the same price point as the Lucca A53, but I'm honestly intimidated by its size and weight (82 pounds!!!) and that it can only be shipped in a pallet.  I think that's more machine than I'm bargaining for.  There's also the upcoming Fellow Series 1 machine, but I just don't know enough about it and I don't find it particularly attractive (though I could possibly be convinced that it is the best option) after watching the into video.

As for my two main options listed above, I think the Ascaso is a bit more attractive, is faster to heat up, and I really like all the manual toggle switches, lights and the standard 58mm.  It's smaller and would easily fit my kitchen counter. But it seems very similar to my BBE with the thermojet technology, and I don't believe the steam is that powerful, and so I am not sure the end results will be that different from the BBE with the espresso or milk quality. I'm also not sure they are as reliable as Breville or Lucca (La Spaziale).  Basically, I want to drink my drink in the morning from a reliable machine and feel like it's just as good as my local cafe, but I don't know if Ascaso can quite do that.  Will the results taste noticeably better than the BBE?

Next, the Lucca A53 mini with wooden sides is also quite attractive to me, just not as much so as the Ascaso.  There are little silver buttons, no switches, no lights, and an odd 53mm portafilter (though people say it makes it easier to dial in). It has a sort of 70's diner vibe, maybe, that is not as slick as the Ascaso. But, I've read where people have that first taste and right away know they are in the big leagues and making REAL espresso drinks, as this is a commercially rated machine.  I've read where experienced baristas have said that it pretty much performs almost identically to machines they use at work. It is quite a bit more expensive though (almost 1k), larger and heavier, has a much longer heat up time with two brass boilers, but it also has volumetric control and a timer app (so I can turn it on an hour before I wake up in the morning).  I've heard the steam power is massive.  I've also read stories of small shops pulling 20 shots a day for a decade without a single issue.  Again, it is commercially rated, so I'm assuming that helps reliability too.

So which should I pair up with a new DF64g2?  A sleek, modern white Ascaso DUO or a walnut wood sided Lucca A53 mini?  I suppose the third option is to save money and preorder a Fellow Series 1, but who knows what quality I'm getting there.  Anyway, I've changed my mind 10 times already. Any experience or advice would be GREATLY appreciated! 

PS - A friend suggested the Elizabeth to me before, but it has shot timing buttons, not volumetric, so I'm not really interested as I switch coffees so often and resetting them constantly would be a hassle.  ",1,1746203554.0,espresso,2,1.0,False

1kd5a9t,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1kd5a9t,Week 15: Longitude - Swedish Tiger Cake / Marmorkuchen / Marble cake,"So I am quite behind posting/baking because quite a lot happened in the last three weeks... So here I am with a double contender! I know this cake as Marmorkuchen but I also figured out that swedish people call it Tigerkaka, which is quite an unfortunate name from a German perspective. (Sounds like Tiger poop). Nevertheless I am baking this one for my sanity since my actual attempt failed miserably. I don't want to talk about the pinocchio cake that was turned into a very delicate trifle. One day I will try it again and don't listen to my boyfriends request and my apparent stupidity in geometry. 

Since I am currently ill, I tried to cut corners wherever possible and it still turned out beautifully.  I followed the recipe from [The North Kitchen](https://true-north-kitchen.com/swedish-tiger-cake-tigerkaka/) very loosely. I tweaked quite a few things to make it work for my circumstances.  But it turned out well and everyone enjoyed it! I was scared that it may have too much coffee flavour but after baking it kind of mellowed significantly into a nice dark, rich note combined with the cocoa. You might serve with vanilla ice cream, whipped cream or vanilla sauce. For me, a glass of milk hits my nostalgia. Especially when the cake is a bit older and you soak the cake with some milk to make it insanely moist. 

So here is my recipe:

Base cake
- 4 cups pre-made cake flour mix (not cake flour! It is actually a sponge cake mix that consist basically of flour. sugar, starch, baking leavening and some salt. I suppose you could use a white or vanilla cake mix instead but idk)
- 4 large eggs
-  ¬æ cups oil
- ¬æ buttermilk ( I just measured a shallow ¬æ cup of milk and added some distilled vinegar, didn't stir because I forgot)
- nice amount of vanilla extract and butter aroma

Cocoa mix in
- ¬º cup hot espresso (I used a capsule machine and made ""fresh"" espresso with some crema on top)
- ‚Öì cup sugar
- ‚Öì cup mixed cocoa powder ( I ran out of dark and filled the cup up with some natural cocoa powder. 

For the pan some oil and natural cocoa powder (don't recommend, use either dark cocoa or just plain flour)

1. Mix the hot espresso with the sugar and cocoa. Let it bloom. Make the buttermilk, let it sit too. Oil and flour the loaf pan, set aside. Preheat oven to 375¬∞F/190¬∞C
2. Measure the cake mix in a small bowl.
3. Whip eggs with oil until the volume increased, it got paler and it seems to thicken a bit.
4. Put in the measured flour mix and mix until it thickens. Now add the vanilla extract, butter aroma and buttermilk. Mix until combined.
5. Take about half (maybe a bit less) of the batter and fil it into a small bowl and add in the cocoa mix in. Mix until well combined and streakfree.
6.  Now layer the batters into your pan - do 5 plain and 3 cocoa layers. First start with a layer of plain batter. Spread it somewhat evenly. Now pour on the cocoa batter evenly. Cover the cocoa batter with some plain batter and then top it with the cocoa batter again. Now cover it again somewhat with plain batter and follow that up with the remaining cocoa batter. Now top it with the remaining plain batter.
7. To swirl the layers use a small metal spatula. First start at one corner and stick in your spatula that  it almost touches the bottom.  Move your spatula to the closest corner then lift the spatula slightly and go back to the other side but in a slightly diagonal line so that you almost touch the wall roughly 1 inch beside your starting point. Now move your spatula down a but and repeat that movement until you reach the other end of your loaf pan. Now do one more straight line so that you are at the diagonal end of your starting point. Now move the spatula roughly one inch away along the long side wall of your pan until you reach the other end. Move your spatula one inch towards your starting point and then make a long straight  line across the pan to the other side. Pepeat that until you get as close as one inch to your pan's oyher long wall. Do one continous stroke. Do not lift the spatula completely out of the batter before you finished your stroke. 
8. Now put your pan into the oven and let it bake until you see that the top layer sets a bit. Reduce the temperature to 325¬∞F or 160¬∞C and cut across the long side with a sharp knife. Let it bake until a wooden stick comes out clean. It took about an hour for me. 
9. Let it cool slightly and then remove it from the pan to cool completely or serve while still warm. Enjoy!

1kd5a6g,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1kd5a6g,Week 15: Longitude - Swedish Tiger Cake / Marmorkuchen / Marble cake,"So I am quite behind posting/baking because quite a lot happened in the last three weeks... So here I am with a double contender! I know this cake as Marmorkuchen but I also figured out that swedish people call it Tigerkaka, which is quite an unfortunate name from a German perspective. (Sounds like Tiger poop). Nevertheless I am baking this one for my sanity since my actual attempt failed miserably. I don't want to talk about the pinocchio cake that was turned into a very delicate trifle. One day I will try it again and don't listen to my boyfriends request and my apparent stupidity in geometry. 

Since I am currently ill, I tried to cut corners wherever possible and it still turned out beautifully.  I followed the recipe from [The North Kitchen](https://true-north-kitchen.com/swedish-tiger-cake-tigerkaka/) very loosely. I tweaked quite a few things to make it work for my circumstances.  But it turned out well and everyone enjoyed it! I was scared that it may have too much coffee flavour but after baking it kind of mellowed significantly into a nice dark, rich note combined with the cocoa. You might serve with vanilla ice cream, whipped cream or vanilla sauce. For me, a glass of milk hits my nostalgia. Especially when the cake is a bit older and you soak the cake with some milk to make it insanely moist. 

So here is my recipe:

Base cake
- 4 cups pre-made cake flour mix (not cake flour! It is actually a sponge cake mix that consist basically of flour. sugar, starch, baking leavening and some salt. I suppose you could use a white or vanilla cake mix instead but idk)
- 4 large eggs
-  ¬æ cups oil
- ¬æ buttermilk ( I just measured a shallow ¬æ cup of milk and added some distilled vinegar, didn't stir because I forgot)
- nice amount of vanilla extract and butter aroma

Cocoa mix in
- ¬º cup hot espresso (I used a capsule machine and made ""fresh"" espresso with some crema on top)
- ‚Öì cup sugar
- ‚Öì cup mixed cocoa powder ( I ran out of dark and filled the cup up with some natural cocoa powder. 

For the pan some oil and natural cocoa powder (don't recommend, use either dark cocoa or just plain flour)

1. Mix the hot espresso with the sugar and cocoa. Let it bloom. Make the buttermilk, let it sit too. Oil and flour the loaf pan, set aside. Preheat oven to 375¬∞F/190¬∞C
2. Measure the cake mix in a small bowl.
3. Whip eggs with oil until the volume increased, it got paler and it seems to thicken a bit.
4. Put in the measured flour mix and mix until it thickens. Now add the vanilla extract, butter aroma and buttermilk. Mix until combined.
5. Take about half (maybe a bit less) of the batter and fil it into a small bowl and add in the cocoa mix in. Mix until well combined and streakfree.
6.  Now layer the batters into your pan - do 5 plain and 3 cocoa layers. First start with a layer of plain batter. Spread it somewhat evenly. Now pour on the cocoa batter evenly. Cover the cocoa batter with some plain batter and then top it with the cocoa batter again. Now cover it again somewhat with plain batter and follow that up with the remaining cocoa batter. Now top it with the remaining plain batter.
7. To swirl the layers use a small metal spatula. First start at one corner and stick in your spatula that  it almost touches the bottom.  Move your spatula to the closest corner then lift the spatula slightly and go back to the other side but in a slightly diagonal line so that you almost touch the wall roughly 1 inch beside your starting point. Now move your spatula down a but and repeat that movement until you reach the other end of your loaf pan. Now do one more straight line so that you are at the diagonal end of your starting point.

Pepeat that until you get as close as one inch to your pan's oyher long wall. Do one continous stroke. Do not lift the spatula completely out of the batter before you finished your stroke.

Ideally somewhere he could drive to in 45‚Äì60 mins, but he‚Äôs happy to do a train commute if that‚Äôs easier. I‚Äôm originally from East Sussex and know people who commute into London from there, so moving closer to home is on the table‚Äîbut I‚Äôm not keen to be right back towards home/so far down south that London is a full 'day out' trip as opposed to somewhere we could see friends for an evening and not have to stay over the night because it would take too long to get home. I know property on tube lines is going to be mad expensive, but it's something we'd consider. I also am aware that some places are a shorter commute on other rail lines compared to the tube, so in actuality if being somewhere further out that is genuinely a shorter journey than the tube would be, we're keen on that too. 

We‚Äôre not fussed about being close to central London‚Äîmainly for cost reasons, but also because we‚Äôd prefer somewhere a bit quieter and less hectic. My work will likely be in London, and since I don‚Äôt drive, I‚Äôd be fine with up to an hour by train.

Beta launching soon, sharing raw lessons learnt along the way.

\---

Hi! First of all, before diving into the good stuff, let me give you a little backstory and introduce myself quickly. Nice to meet you - I am Theo. I also go by the username VLRevolution.

Since I mostly build solo, I like to think that Theo is the CEO while VLRevolution is the dev - a clear separation of concerns, a concept commonly used in software development to keep things simple and write good code as a result. On a solo unicorn journey, it helps to be able to operate in multiple modes: sometimes to look at things from the perspective of the CEO, to make sure we don't get lost on the way, yet the responsibility of the daily grind falls on the shoulders of the rebellious rockstar dev whose heart always fights for his vision to see the light of the day.

I am a self studied full-stack developer, specializing in designing & building scalable real-time apps. I pride myself in my drive & talent for creating the best user experiences possible.

>**Lesson #1:** UX is the king!

For the past 100 weeks I've been building a project that I consider a dream project and this is my story.

**Why should you care:** I will share real valuable but mostly painful lessons.. It's like how 50 lays it down so poetically in ""Many Men"":

    ‚ÄúSunny days wouldn't be special if it wasn't for rain
    Joy wouldn't feel so good if it wasn't for pain‚Äù

Buckle up!

**The Spark: An Idea Born of Change (Summer 2023)**

Our journey begins about 6 months after ChatGPT went viral for the first time, at the beginning of the summer of 2023. As soon as ChatGPT exploded onto the scene I knew that my time had come: it was now or never - time was seemingly running out! I had that rare moment of inspiration that a revolution was on the verge of coming, but it took me another 6 months before I wrote the first lines of code towards what would eventually become my baby: UNI AI was born. I made the first commit on Jun 21, 2023.

The world had suddenly changed. We now had computers that could think, even if imperfectly. It was clear they would only get better. For me, this was proof that the ""singularity,"" predicted by great thinkers from von Neumann to Kurzweil, was real and near.

Personally, I believe that singularity is the moment each of us becomes superhuman by leveraging AI to transcend the limits of time, resources, and knowledge. I believe in the limitless potential within us all, and the project aims to provide the tools and ecosystem to help realize it.

However, the project didn't start out being called UNI AI. Now inspired by this incredible new technology that everybody was so excited about and trying to learn and understand, I was trying to come up with a world changing idea that this new generation of AI models could power.

I'm going to be fully honest with you in this post, no glazing, so that you know this is authentic and the lessons are therefore also raw and real: I was still a less than whole version of myself back then, struggling with some emotional wounds, still a victim of my vices.. So on one fateful evening, self-medicating with some herbs, my creative mind started racing and helped me to conjure up a vision for the next generation of computer apps, programs that mostly design and build themselves!

That was the lightbulb moment: a universal library of next-gen apps, easily built with just willpower and thought. A future where ideas are currency. This vision remains core to the project - building a community-powered ecosystem where your unique knowledge, experiences, and skills are invaluable and could potentially be monetized down the line through a creator economy model.

In a moment of inspiration, I named the project UNIAPP - the universal app, the last app you'd ever need. The tagline flowed naturally: ""UNIAPP - Dream, Design, Deliver.""

**Navigating the Labyrinth: Early Hurdles & Lessons**

In a rush of excitement, I started building a prototype to show a close friend and long-time business partner. Months flew by as I dove into the trenches. Naively, I thought a prototype would take just a few months. Big mistake! I was still relatively new to *app* development, despite being a senior full-stack developer.

>**Lesson:** Don't underestimate app development vs. web development. It‚Äôs a different beast. Always budget extra time for research & skilling up. Use downtime from slow progress to study & test.

The complexity was overwhelming. To speed things up, I leaned into automation.

>**Lesson:** Automations combined with AI are truly game-changing, especially for solo builders. A series of simple scripts (Node.js/TypeScript worked for me) inputting & outputting prompts & data can go a very long way!

By the end of summer 2023, I had a working prototype with over 2000 AI-generated ""chatlets"" (our term for these AI-powered apps). It was a dream realized, even if far from launch-ready. An app that built itself!

**The UNIAPP Setback & Rebirth as UNI AI**

Frustrated with the slow pace and feeling the pressure, I considered finding a co-founder to help raise capital. To pitch effectively, I needed to solidify the UNIAPP brand. That meant doing what I should have done on day one: checking for trademarks.

Fatefully, UNIAPP was already registered by an education application company. My beloved brand shattered instantly. Letting go was painful; I'd already registered domains and poured my identity into the name.

>**Lesson:** Check trademarks EARLY! And when setbacks hit, it's okay to feel down. Take time to grieve until you find the courage to pick yourself back up.

As the saying goes, ""it is what it is."" When life didn't give me UNIAPP, I eventually created UNI AI - a unique name that clearly reflects our mission: a universal AI platform.

**The Human Element: Partnerships, Funding & Resilience**

I offered my friend equal partnership: I'd build, he'd handle business and fundraising. This proved challenging. Lingering issues from a past venture, coupled with his doubts about UNI AI's ambitious scope, created friction.

>**Lesson:** Never partner with somebody who doubts the core vision. Passion can't be forced.

The nail in the coffin might have been OpenAI launching the GPT Store in January 2024 - an idea seemingly identical to UNIAPP, making us feel obsolete.

>**Lesson:** Never think your idea is unique. Assume competition exists or is coming. This builds confidence in your *own* execution and differentiation.

As one partnership faded, another formed. The very first member of an online community I'd started years ago became a small, early investor, believing in the vision when others wavered.

But bootstrapping remained incredibly difficult. Finding the time to build solo while sustaining myself felt like a constant battle.

>**Lesson:** Bootstrapping requires resilience, frugality, and unwavering faith. Be prepared for the grind. Be frugal, pursue scrappiness, and don't lose faith. Your Dreams need you!

I juggled part-time web development, freelance automation jobs, and even a full-time role for a few months, alongside taking loans from family. It‚Äôs the reality of building something from nothing.

**Refining the Vision: The Growth and Creation Engine (Mid-2024 - End 2024)**

Throughout 2024, I wrestled with UNI AI's unique value proposition while steadily building foundational features. I knew staying private was crucial to uphold our community commitment - building the AI project we all deserve, where value flows back to the users who build it.

Simultaneously, I was navigating personal challenges stemming from a failed relationship.

>**Lesson:** Avoid falling in love with someone not cut out for the startup life if you're pursuing a demanding dream. The paths often conflict. Fall in love with your dreams first; honor your personal journey. I now consider myself married to my business.

This period forced introspection. Starting in autumn 2024, I committed fiercely to my health - no compromises. It was time to heal.

>**Lesson:** The easiest way to lose focus is to neglect your health out of spite for past events. Forget what happened; focus on what you can make happen *now*.

My routine became rigorous: wake up, breathwork & meditation in the sun, mantras (self-love, gratitude, inner wealth), a 70-minute run (starting smaller and building up is key!), shower (finishing ice cold), simple breakfast, then deep work. An hour walk mid-day for brainstorming (my best ideas come then!), dinner, rest, more work, and finally, 1-1.5 hours of yoga (essential for preventing running injuries!). I even gave up coffee, finding more peace and better sleep without it (though I know that's polarizing!).

>**Lesson:** A holistic health routine (mind & body) is non-negotiable for sustained high performance and clarity, especially when bootstrapping. Find practices that resonate and sustain *you*.

This commitment brought clarity. I realized my earlier focus was flawed. I'd been trying to build an AI *better* than humans, potentially replacing us. Depressing, right?

The real lightbulb moment: What if AI didn't replace us, but *empowered* us to become our best selves? An AI fighting alongside us, revealing our limitless potential? That felt *empowering*.

This insight reignited my passion. UNI AI's true identity emerged: **""The Growth and Creation Engine,""** helping users **""10X Your Life.""** The focus shifted to building the Core Collections and \~80 premium chatlets centered on growth, mastery, creation, and transformation.

**Building the Ecosystem: Light Points & Community**

To make the community commitment real, I designed the Light Points (LP) system - UNI AI's loyalty currency. It rewards engagement and support, giving early believers a tangible stake and a voice.

UNI AI's ecosystem is gamified. Actions earn LP, a leaderboard helps track progress, and everyone has an equal chance to build their AI legacy. Even on the free plan, LPs allow limited access to premium features, offering a taste of the full potential. UNI AI is built for viral growth, with a promise to funnel value back to the community.

**The Road Ahead & Your Invitation**

The Growth and Creation Engine is almost ready. We're putting the finishing touches on the platform.

Does this sound interesting?

**You still have a chance to become one of the 2220 Founding Members.**

**Visit** [**uniai.io**](https://uniai.io) **right now and join the waitlist.**

You'll get a notification 48 hours before the Beta v0.9 launches, allowing you to claim your unique UNI ID. The first 2220 claimers lock in Founding Member status forever; all other early joiners get the almost-as-exclusive Early Adopter status.

Come build the future of AI together with us.

Don't let AI replace your life. Let it help you 10X it.

You deserve it all...

I'll finish with some wisdom from Kendrick Lamar's ""man at the garden"":

    ‚ÄúTwice emotional stability
    Of sound body and tranquility, I deserve it all
    Like minds and less enemies
    Stock investments, more entities, I deserve it all
    VVS', white diamonds, GNX with the seat back, reclinin'
    Bitch, I deserve it all‚Äù

Thanks for reading this far! This journey has been intense, filled with pivots and breakthroughs, both for UNI AI and for myself. Sharing it openly feels like the right way to start building the transparent, empowering community I envision.

Thin morning light leaked through the edges of the curtains, glowing faintly against the floral wallpaper that had yellowed from time and nicotine. The heater in the wall whirred a soft, constant hum that hadn‚Äôt been there when he‚Äôd gone to sleep. Or at least, he didn‚Äôt remember turning it on.

He blinked blearily at the alarm clock on the nightstand.

It blinked back, uselessly.

*12:00. 12:00. 12:00.*

*Power flicker, maybe. Or someone had unplugged it*.

He reached for his phone, thumbed the lock screen.

*Tuesday, 7:48 AM*

He sat up slowly, heart giving a little knock inside his ribs.

*Tuesday?*

That couldn‚Äôt be right. He rubbed at his face, checked again. Same result. The weather widget said 34 degrees and cloudy. The date sat still and unblinking.

He was sure it had been Sunday night. He‚Äôd gone to bed early, still sore from the drive. He remembered starting a journal entry.

His head turned toward the small desk.

There it was: his journal, spine crooked, pen lying across the open page. The entry date said Sunday, scrawled in his own hand. The last sentence trailed off halfway through a thought.

*No Monday.*

He moved to the edge of the bed and stared at the notepad beside the phone. He‚Äôd written something there, too:

*Ask Norah about the church. M-*

Just the single letter. Cut off.

There was a paper coffee cup next to it, half-drunk and lukewarm. He lifted it, sniffed it, tasted it. It was somehow both burnt and stale

He didn‚Äôt remember getting it. He didn‚Äôt remember *any* of yesterday.

His stomach turned with something smaller, more acidic than simple fear. Like stepping off the last stair in the dark and finding the floor lower than it should be.

He flipped open the journal and scanned back. Sunday‚Äôs writing was intact, but the ink shimmered slightly at the edges, like it had dried damp. He thumbed forward. Monday‚Äôs page was blank.

*No, not blank. Gone. Torn cleanly out.*

He checked his phone again. No photos since Sunday. No calls. No messages.

*No, Auggie, wait. One from Norah.*

‚ÄúHope you‚Äôre feeling better after yesterday. Let me know about the church thing.‚Äù

*Yesterday.*

*What church thing?*

He scrolled through his health app on a whim, something he usually ignored. A full set of steps logged for Monday. He‚Äôd walked several miles, and his heart rate spiked at 3:17 PM. But nothing else. No memory of being awake.

Outside the window, a crow landed on the motel‚Äôs rooftop A/C unit. It didn‚Äôt move. Just stared in through the glass like it had been waiting. August stood. The air in the room felt like the walls had exhaled during the night and filled the space with something breath-warmed and sour. He crossed to the window and pulled back the curtain just an inch.

The crow didn‚Äôt flinch. Its eyes reflected nothing. To his right, the motel sign buzzed, then stuttered.

*VACANT* blinked. Then, for just a heartbeat, the letters rearranged.

*VACUUM.*

He blinked again. It was off now, unlit.

August let go of the curtain and stepped toward the mirror over the sink. The glass was cracked in the corner, a jagged starburst he was sure hadn‚Äôt been there before. He wiped a line through the condensation, and for a moment, his reflection lagged behind.

Then it caught up, like a film buffering. He stared at himself, breathing shallow.

‚ÄúThis is stupid,‚Äù he whispered. ‚ÄúI was here yesterday. I *had* to be.‚Äù

He turned, grabbed his journal, shoved the pen into his pocket, and headed for the door. Behind him, the calendar page by the nightstand curled upward slightly, as if caught in a breeze that hadn‚Äôt touched the air.



The walk into town felt longer than it should have.

August kept his hands in his pockets, shoulders hunched against a breeze that didn‚Äôt stir the trees. The sidewalk was still damp from a rain he hadn‚Äôt seen, and the air smelled faintly of smoke and wet concrete. Overhead, the sky was clear while the puddles on the pavement winked like they hadn‚Äôt dried properly.

A man passed him near the corner of Main and Birch wearing a gray windbreaker, crooked glasses, familiar in a way August couldn‚Äôt place.

‚ÄúYou made it through Monday better than most,‚Äù the man said with a nod, like they were mid-conversation. August turned to respond, but the man had already moved on, walking briskly across the street.

*Better than most.*

*What the hell did that mean?*

He stepped into the corner store out of habit. The place hadn‚Äôt changed much. A few racks of fading snacks, a small cooler buzzing too loudly, the same wire rack of local papers near the register. He picked one up. The front page was grim and small-town predictable. Something about the county budget meeting and a missing dog.

The date at the top read:

*Tuesday, March 11th.*

A kid walked past outside, tossing newspapers from a canvas bag onto porches with mechanical rhythm. August opened the door just as the boy passed again.

‚ÄúFirst day back?‚Äù August asked.

The kid nodded. ‚ÄúYeah, been off since Friday. Sick as hell. Whole house had it.‚Äù

August didn‚Äôt answer. Just let the door swing shut behind him.

The woman behind the counter, whose name he thought might have been Marta or Martha, was already pouring a cup of coffee.

‚ÄúBack again?‚Äù she said. ‚ÄúSame as yesterday?‚Äù

He hesitated. ‚ÄúSorry?‚Äù

She held out the cup, steam curling from the lid. ‚ÄúYou got the dark roast yesterday. Said it helped with your headache.‚Äù He saw a cup identical to the one from his room. He accepted it slowly. The heat was real in his hands. The smell bitter and burned.

‚ÄúRight,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúThanks.‚Äù

The receipt printed automatically. Tuesday‚Äôs date, clear as ever.

Outside, the streets were waking up with old trucks rumbling by, a woman walking a dog that stopped and stared at him too long before moving on. August spotted Norah just past the hardware store, a cardboard box braced against one hip. She was trying to elbow open the trunk of her car with limited success.

He crossed the street.

‚ÄúNeed a hand?‚Äù

She turned, surprised. ‚ÄúOh, erm, yeah, thanks.‚Äù

He took the box, canning jars clinking gently inside, and helped ease the trunk open. When they set it down, Norah leaned back against the bumper and stretched her neck.

‚ÄúI‚Äôve been meaning to catch you,‚Äù she said. ‚ÄúYou seemed kind of‚Ä¶ off yesterday.‚Äù

August tried to play it casual. ‚ÄúDid we talk yesterday?‚Äù

She raised an eyebrow. ‚ÄúYeah? What, can‚Äôt you remember?‚Äù

He shook his head. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs fuzzy. What did we talk about?‚Äù

Norah looked at him with a concerned furrow to her brow, then shrugged. ‚ÄúYou mentioned wanting to check out the old church. Said something about the bell tower. I don‚Äôt know. You seemed distracted. Thought maybe you were still getting settled.‚Äù

He nodded like that meant something. She rubbed at her forehead, wincing faintly. ‚ÄúHonestly, I‚Äôve been forgetting stuff too. Probably just the air around here. Or the water. Or both.‚Äù She smiled, but it flickered.

Then she reached for the trunk and closed it. ‚ÄúAnyway, let me know if you still want to go look. I‚Äôve got the spare key. Church board never asked for it back.‚Äù

She waved and walked away. August watched her go. Her gait was steady. Normal. But her words sat wrong in his ears. Something about the tone was too rehearsed. Like she was trying to remember a memory she‚Äôd practiced, not lived.

He wandered further down the block, past the barbershop. Two older men sat on the bench out front, coffee cups in hand, sharing small-town stories like always.

‚ÄúWhole block on Birch lost power Monday,‚Äù one said. ‚ÄúClocks all fried. Had to reset mine three times.‚Äù

‚ÄúThat storm came outta nowhere,‚Äù said the other.

August didn‚Äôt stop.

Didn‚Äôt speak.

Just kept walking.

Because that was his street.

*And there hadn‚Äôt been a storm he could remember.*





The cemetery sat just past the edge of town, behind a leaning chain-link fence that had grown a tangle of vines and rust. August hadn‚Äôt meant to walk there; his feet had chosen to move away from the shops and chatter, back toward quiet.

The breeze had picked up. Not strong, just enough to stir the gravel at his feet. The clouds overhead were thin and slow-moving, low enough to smother the sun into a dull gray wash. He adjusted his jacket, hands deep in his pockets, and walked the narrow path that curved along the cemetery‚Äôs edge.

Something cold touched his shoulder. Like an ice drop gently tapping for his attention. Another drop landed on the bridge of his nose. Then a few more, dotting his sleeves.

He looked up. The sky above was hazy all of a sudden, though he hadn‚Äôt seen the clouds on the horizon. They weren‚Äôt dark, more the kind of cloud cover that said *maybe* rain, later, *if it felt like it.* Still, the drops were real. And cold. They left faint gray smudges on the fabric of his jacket. By the time he reached the cemetery gate, the drizzle had already stopped.

The latch gave a dry creak as he pushed it open. Inside, the ground dipped slightly, soft with uneven patches of grass and muddy tread. A few trees stretched out over the plots, their bare branches just beginning to bud.

He paused at the first row of headstones. There were flowers. Dozens of them. Most were old, with crisped edges, colors faded into paper-thin gray. But some looked fresh. Bright.

He knelt beside one with a bouquet of tulips, orange and cream, stems still firm in the soil. He touched a petal. Cool and unwilted.

*Tulips bloom in spring*, r*ight?*

It was March. Maybe that wasn‚Äôt strange. Still, something about them felt wrong. Like they‚Äôd skipped a step getting here.

He stood and moved further in. Some of the names carved into the stones stirred nothing. Others rang dim bells: old teachers, childhood neighbors, faces without anchors.

He stopped at one grave and stared. The name was familiar. He couldn‚Äôt say why.

The birth date read 1960. The death date, 1978.

*That doesn‚Äôt make sense*. Whoever this was, he remembered them being old when he was young. This math was backward.

He crouched, brushed at the stone. The texture was slick with moisture from the drizzle. Whatever it was. A patch of dirt smeared under his palm.

For a second, he thought he saw a word etched faintly across the surface, written in a narrow, slanted hand.

*sorry*

He blinked, and it was gone.

The wind picked up again, rattling the fence behind him. A flag by the cemetery entrance fluttered soundlessly, and for a moment, everything else seemed to still. No birds. No breeze in the trees. Even the hum of town behind him had gone flat.

Then, just as quickly, it all returned. The distant bark of a dog, the buzz of tires over asphalt. A normal afternoon again.

He rose slowly and turned back toward the road. A crow watched him from the bare limb of a sycamore near the cemetery gate. It tilted its head when he looked up, silent.

August held its gaze for a few seconds before it turned and took flight, wings heavy, disappearing behind the roofline of a nearby house.

He walked back toward the road. Over his shoulder, he saw that one of the bouquets had toppled sideways. A mess of tulips scattered, stems bent like they‚Äôd been dropped from a height. He couldn‚Äôt remember if they‚Äôd looked like that before.

He wiped at his jacket again. One of the earlier stains had darkened slightly, like ink bled into the fabric.

It didn‚Äôt come off.



The motel room hadn‚Äôt changed.

Same wrinkled sheets, same flickering lamp, same faint smell of mildew and dust baked into the carpet. The door closed with a tired click behind him, and August stood still for a moment in the half-light, coat still on, breath slowing. He crossed to the desk.

The journal was right where he‚Äôd left it. Open, spine crooked. Sunday‚Äôs entry still lay sprawled across the page in his own handwriting, the sentence still trailing off. He flipped forward. Monday‚Äôs page was still gone.

He checked the trash. He dropped to his knees, ran his hand under the bed. Pulled it back dusty, empty.

Back at the desk, he opened to Tuesday. Or what was meant to be Tuesday. The ink from earlier had blurred slightly at the edges. A smudge near his own name. He traced it with a thumb and it came away faintly gray.

The calendar still said Tuesday. Monday‚Äôs sheet still missing.

He hadn‚Äôt torn it.

He sank into the chair. Took a breath. Opened the journal again.

Some of the older entries were fine. Sharp, clean, the words exactly as he remembered. But others seemed off.

*Tampered with, maybe?*

He found a paragraph from last week about the drive up. A line he swore had ended with *‚Äúlonely stretch of highway‚Äù* now read *‚Äúlong stretch of highway.‚Äù* Just one word, but it snagged his gaze. Had he really written it like that? Was he misremembering? Or was the ink‚Ä¶

He ran his hand down the margin.

The paper felt strange. Not wet, exactly, but slack, like it had soaked up something and dried too fast. A few of the corners curled slightly, like old leaves left in sunlight.

He flipped to a blank page and started a timeline:

*Sunday: Arrived in Stillmark. Motel check-in. Talked to Norah?*

*Monday:*

He stopped.

What was there to say?

He tapped the pen against his knee. Then wrote:

*Monday: (missing)*

*Tuesday: Corner store. Norah. Cemetery.*

He pressed harder for the next line.

*I remember Monday.*

The pen stuttered. The ink came out uneven. The word *Monday* looked darker than the rest, like the paper had absorbed too much and left a bruise.

He lifted his hand. There was a faint gray smear across the heel of his palm, like ash or wet graphite. He wiped it on his jeans, then stared back at the page.

It didn‚Äôt look wrong, but it didn‚Äôt feel right either.

He grabbed the receipt from earlier, the one from the corner store. The timestamp said 9:17 AM. His phone read 6:03 PM.

Outside the window, the sky was already low and pale. Sunset too early, too fast. The light in the room had gone amber and long. He checked his health app again, thumb flicking down the screen.

*5:58 PM: 232 steps.*

But he hadn‚Äôt moved.

He stared at it, blinked, then turned off the screen and set the phone face-down on the desk. He opened to a fresh page and began to write:

*I was here.*

*I remember Sunday.*

*I lost Monday.*

*I am not losing Tuesday.*

He underlined the last sentence. Once. Then again.

The ink bled slightly. Just at the edges.

He stared at it for a long time. Then he closed the journal carefully, laid the pen on top, and slid it to the center of the desk, like anchoring something with weight.

The heater clicked on behind him with a hollow puff. The curtains stirred faintly, though the window was shut. He turned off the lamp.

As the dark settled in, he heard it, barely audible.

*Is that a page turning?*

Not blown. Not disturbed. Just turned.

1kd50ys,https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/1kd50ys/the_closing_shift_at_somnus_beds/,The Closing Shift at Somnus Beds,"Okay, deep breath. Here goes. This isn't easy to write, even now, over a year later. My hands still shake sometimes when the memory surfaces, unbidden, especially late at night when the house is quiet, when any small creak or settling sound can send my pulse hammering against my ribs like a trapped bird. This happened last year. I haven't told anyone the full story, just disjointed fragments, mumbled warnings nobody really understood or took seriously. But I saw a Somnus Beds commercial last night ‚Äì one of their offensively cheerful, brightly lit ones promising 'your best night's sleep, guaranteed' ‚Äì and the dread came back so strong, so visceral, I almost threw up right there on my cheap living room rug. I feel like I have to get this out, put it into words, solidify it outside my own head, maybe just to feel less utterly alone with the memory clawing inside me.



I needed a job, badly. University fees were piling up, a rising tide threatening to drown me, and my already precarious part-time gig washing dishes vanished overnight thanks to sudden corporate 'streamlining'. Rent was breathing down my neck, a constant, cold pressure at the base of my skull. Panic was a knot tightening relentlessly in my stomach, making food taste like ash. That‚Äôs when I saw the stark white hiring sign taped crudely inside the tinted window of Somnus Beds. It wasn‚Äôt glamorous, obviously, but it was full-time, paid slightly above minimum wage, and honestly, how hard could selling mattresses possibly be?



The manager, Mr. Henderson, was‚Ä¶ odd. Not in an obvious, easily categorized way, but fundamentally‚Ä¶ off-kilter. He possessed this unnervingly placid demeanor, eyes that seemed perpetually wide, holding an unnerving, almost reptilian stillness behind thick lenses. He smiled constantly, a thin, stretched expression that never once touched those placid eyes, like a poorly fitted mask revealing nothing beneath. He carried a faint, distinct smell ‚Äì lavender, sharp and incongruously floral, undercut with something metallic and dusty, like old pennies forgotten at the bottom of a damp drawer. During the interview, he barely glanced at my resume, focusing instead on me, his gaze lingering, making my skin crawl as he commented on my posture (""A bit tense around the shoulders, Alex. Chronic tension severely impacts the REM cycle, restricts restorative processes, you know.""), my apparent ‚Äòlevel of innate restfulness‚Äô. He spoke less about sales targets and commission structures and more about the profound importance of undisturbed rest, the delicate sanctity of the nocturnal environment. Despite the profound strangeness, maybe because of it ‚Äì it felt deliberate, performative, somehow ‚Äì he hired me on the spot. Desperation, I‚Äôve learned with chilling certainty, is a powerful, blinding force.



The store itself was mundane enough on the surface ‚Äì rows upon rows of mattresses laid out like pale slabs in a morgue under harsh, buzzing fluorescent lights. That specific, sterile smell of new fabric, plastic, and faint chemical treatments hung heavy in the air, failing to completely mask an underlying faint, persistent mustiness, like old water damage. Overly cheerful posters extolled the virtues of spinal alignment and deep sleep technology with aggressive, empty positivity. It was usually dead quiet, the silence amplifying every footstep on the industrial carpet, especially towards the end of the day. Henderson worked the day shift; my primary role was the closing shift, 1 PM to 9 PM, utterly alone in the echoing space for the final, longest, increasingly dreadful hours.



The first concrete sign that this wasn't just a quirky retail job came with the closing procedures. Henderson walked me through them on my first day with meticulous, almost reverent precision, handing me a laminated checklist, its edges slightly softened and greyed from repeated, perhaps anxious, handling. Most of it was standard drudgery: count the till, straighten the sad little pillow displays, vacuum the main aisles into obsessively neat lines, lock the heavy back storage door. But then came the other steps. Specific. Unyielding. Non-negotiable, Henderson stressed, his smile tightening infinitesimally at the corners, a flicker of something hard in his eyes.



Item 12: At 8:45 PM precisely, commence dimming of main showroom lights. (Standard enough.)



Item 13: Dim lights sequentially, strictly starting from the back (Storage end), moving towards the front entrance. Sequence must be maintained without deviation or pause. (Oddly rigid, ritualistic‚Ä¶)



Item 14: Ensure the protective white sheet completely covers the Somnus Platinum Restorative display model (Floor Model SR-001). Visually confirm all corners are tucked securely beneath the frame edge. DO NOT adjust sheet after 8:50 PM for any reason whatsoever. (SR-001. Their flagship beast, a king-sized altar of memory foam and dubious ‚Äòbio-resonant fibers‚Äô, perched on a raised, velvet-roped platform near the front window like some bloated, pale monarch awaiting silent, unseen tribute. Even in the bright daylight, it seemed to possess a subtle gravitational pull, a feeling of‚Ä¶ passive watchfulness. I dismissed it then as the intimidation of its absurd price tag.)



Item 15: From 8:50 PM until the moment the front door is fully locked and secured behind you, avoid looking directly at the covered SR-001. Peripheral glances are unavoidable; direct, sustained visual focus is strictly forbidden. (My internal alarm bells began a faint, insistent, chilling chime here.)



Item 16: When locking the front door, listen for the secondary, heavier ‚Äòclunk‚Äô of the internal magnetic lock engaging after the main deadbolt clicks into place. Confirm distinct auditory signal before departing premises. (Standard security, perhaps, but the emphasis felt... disproportionate, urgent.)



Item 17: Should any unusual sounds be perceived after 8:50 PM (e.g., rustling, soft sighing, rhythmic creaking, scratching, tapping), they are to be ignored completely. Maintain absolute focus on procedural tasks. Do not pause. Do not turn towards the sound. Do not investigate under any circumstances. Complete closing sequence without deviation or interruption. (Okay, that wasn't normal building noise settling. That was an explicit warning about something specific. Something anticipated. Something known.)



I remember asking Henderson about items 14, 15, and 17, trying to inject casual curiosity into my voice, a forced lightness to hide the unease coiling tight in my gut. He just offered that wide-eyed, unblinking smile, the placid mask firmly, immovably in place. ""Standard procedure, Alex. Ensures operational integrity and maintains the store's optimal sleep environment. Building quirks, you understand. Old ventilation shafts make peculiar noises, the structure settles quite audibly when the external temperature drops significantly. And the Platinum‚Ä¶ well, it‚Äôs our premier model. Unique composition. Requires‚Ä¶ specific handling. We treat it with a certain‚Ä¶ reverence. Keeps the display immaculate."" His explanation felt thin as tracing paper, rehearsed to the point of dissociation, utterly failing to address the core strangeness. But rent was due, wasn't it? And the stark fear of having no job was still, just barely, greater than the vague, creeping fear induced by a weird boss and his nonsensical rules. I convinced myself he was just an eccentric, maybe deeply superstitious, maybe just deriving some perverse pleasure from messing with the new guy. Harmless, just weird.



For the first couple of weeks, closing was eerily quiet, punctuated only by the hum of the lights and my own solitary movements. The hours between 6 PM and 9 PM stretched, thick with silence and a growing sense of profound isolation. I followed the checklist religiously, less out of belief and more out of the primal fear of screwing up and losing the only thing keeping me financially afloat. The sequential dimming felt performative but simple enough. Ensuring the sheet was perfectly draped over the SR-001, corners tucked just so, became an oddly ingrained, almost superstitious ritual I performed without conscious thought. Avoiding looking directly at the big, sheet-covered lump near the window turned into a strange, subconscious game ‚Äì easy enough if I focused intently on my tasks, wiping down counters that were already spotless, straightening brochures no one had touched all day. I‚Äôd hear the occasional groan from the building‚Äôs old bones, the HVAC system kicking on with a rattling sigh, but nothing that triggered Rule 17‚Äôs specific, chilling warnings. I started to relax, just a fraction, allowing myself the dangerous luxury of thinking Henderson was maybe just paranoid, the rules simply elaborate security theatre.



Then, about a month in, things began to subtly shift, like a radio station slowly drifting off frequency, fading into static and whispers. It wasn't a sudden event, more like a slow seepage of wrongness into the sterile showroom air, a gradual curdling of the atmosphere after sunset.



It began with flickers at the absolute edge of my vision. Sometimes, dimming the lights near the back, moving methodically forward through the deepening gloom, I‚Äôd catch a peripheral flutter of movement ‚Äì quick, dark, indefinite ‚Äì up towards the front, near the SR-001 under its white shroud. A snap of the head revealed nothing. Just silent rows of mattresses fading into shadow, inert and waiting. The air near the Platinum display developed a distinct quality after dark ‚Äì palpably colder, heavier, like stepping into a pocket of dead static electricity that raised the hairs on my arms and neck with an unpleasant tingle. And Henderson's signature scent ‚Äì lavender and old pennies ‚Äì began to manifest faintly near the SR-001 after 8:50 PM, sharp and unnervingly organic in the otherwise neutral, chemical-tinged space.



One Tuesday night, rain lashed against the large front windows, a relentless, drumming tattoo that blurred the streetlights into watercolor smears. The sound isolated me completely within the glass box of the showroom, a world away from the wet streets outside. I was vacuuming, the machine‚Äôs whine a high-pitched scream against the deluge, finishing up around 8:40 PM. 8:45 sharp, I started the dimming sequence, the clicks of the switches echoing unnaturally loud in the charged silence. Back lights off‚Ä¶ mid-showroom lights off‚Ä¶ As I hit the switch for the front section, plunging the room into a deep gloom pierced only by the faint green emergency lights and the watery, distorted glow from outside, I heard it over the dying whine of the vacuum.



A sound. Distinct from the rain. Not the building settling. Something else.



Soft, incredibly faint, dry. Raspy. Like a single, cautious fingernail being dragged slowly, deliberately, across tightly woven canvas. Sssk‚Ä¶ sssskkkk‚Ä¶ It originated, unmistakably, from the SR-001 display.



A frantic, painful hammering erupted behind my ribs, so loud I feared it was audible. I killed the vacuum switch, plunging the store into near silence, amplifying the rain and‚Ä¶ that sound. Sssk‚Ä¶ I stood frozen, every nerve ending alight, straining to hear, to pinpoint. Rule 17: Ignore them. Do not investigate. Henderson‚Äôs flat voice, the laminated words flashing behind my eyes like a faulty neon sign. I forced myself into motion, coiling the vacuum cord with hands that felt thick and clumsy, like numb sausages. My eyes kept darting, against my will, drawn like unwilling magnets towards the sheet-covered shape. In the dim, rain-streaked light, the white sheet seemed‚Ä¶ deeper, more opaque than cloth had any right to be. The shadows pooled beneath it looked unnaturally substantial, seeming to absorb the weak light entirely, hinting at immense density.



I stumbled through the remaining checklist items ‚Äì sweeping behind the counter with jerky, inefficient strokes, wiping it down with trembling hands that left damp streaks, setting the alarm panel, fingers fumbling on the keypad, pressing the wrong buttons twice. All the while, that faint ssssskkkk sound persisted, intermittent, sometimes pausing as if listening for me, then resuming, a bare, dry whisper beneath the drumming rain. I kept my eyes rigidly fixed ‚Äì on the floor tiles, the smudged counter, the glowing green numbers of the alarm keypad ‚Äì anywhere but the Platinum Restorative. My own breathing sounded ragged and loud in my ears.



Reaching the front door, key shaking visibly against the lock plate, I turned it. Click. The main deadbolt slid home with unnerving ease. I waited, breath held tight and aching in my chest, straining my ears past the rain and the frantic pulse hammering in my own neck and temples. The soft sssskkkkk seemed louder now, closer, perhaps just meters behind me in the vast, echoing showroom. Come on, come on‚Ä¶ lock‚Ä¶ please lock‚Ä¶ Then, finally ‚Äì a solid, resonant thunk. The secondary magnetic lock engaged with satisfying weight.



Relief hit me like a physical blow, making me sway on my feet. I yanked the door open and practically fell out into the cold, driving rain, pulling it shut behind me with a choked gasp. I stood there, instantly drenched, shivering uncontrollably, heart pounding against my sternum as if trying to escape, staring back through the streaming glass. The showroom was a pit of shadows, rows of mattresses like pale, silent tombs waiting for occupants. The white sheet over SR-001 was just a shape in the gloom. Still. Unmoving. Silent once more.



It was the rain, I told myself fiercely, teeth chattering from cold and adrenaline, the words a desperate litany. The wind whistling through a hidden roof vent. My imagination, stressed and isolated and chronically sleep-deprived, running wild in the creepy, empty store at night. But the feeling of profound wrongness, the chilling certainty that something else had been aware of me in there, listening, watching me move through the darkness, settled deep in my bones like a cold, spreading infection.



The following week, Henderson was on vacation ‚Äì attending a mandatory ""corporate sleep wellness and synergy retreat,"" according to a clinically worded memo left on the desk. A temp manager, Sarah, covered his shifts. Young, bright, blessedly, achingly normal, she seemed blissfully unaware of the store's... latent atmosphere, humming cheerfully as she worked. On her last day, she offered to close with me, ""Just so I can officially sign off on these insane Henderson protocols,"" she'd said with a conspiratorial eye-roll that felt like a lifeline. We went through the checklist. When we reached the peculiar steps regarding SR-001 ‚Äì the sheet, the specific timing, the avoidance, the sounds ‚Äì she chuckled, shaking her head.



""Henderson's little rituals,"" she whispered, leaning closer as if sharing a hilarious secret. ""He's legitimately obsessed with that one mattress. Swears it 'recalibrates the store's positive circadian energy field daily,' or some other pseudo-scientific garbage he picked up at a seminar.""



As we dimmed the lights, she wasn't meticulous about the sequence, flicking switches almost carelessly, humming a pop song. And when we got to Item 15, avoiding looking at SR-001, she laughed outright. ""Seriously? It's a thousand pounds of foam and springs, Alex. What's it gonna do, develop sentience and critique my posture?"" She deliberately turned, making a show of peering directly at it. ""See? Just a big lumpy rectangle under a perfectly ordinary sheet-""



She stopped. Dead stop. Mid-word, mid-gesture. Her smile evaporated instantly, wiped clean, leaving her face slack with sudden, stark confusion, which quickly morphed into dawning, horrified apprehension. Her eyes widened, fixed on the SR-001. The store fell utterly silent, save for the low, omnipresent hum of the emergency lights. Streetlights outside cast long, skeletal shadows that seemed to converge, deepening into an unnatural darkness around the SR-001 platform.



""What?"" I whispered, the ice from the rainy night returning with a vengeance, prickling my skin, constricting my throat. ""Sarah, what is it?""



""Nothing,"" she stammered, far too quickly, turning back sharply, her face pale. Her voice was thin, strained, trembling slightly. ""Nothing. Just‚Ä¶ the lighting in here at night is seriously messed up. Makes‚Ä¶ makes shapes look‚Ä¶ wrong. Really distorted."" But her earlier breezy confidence was shattered, replaced by a brittle, palpable fear that radiated off her in waves. She rushed through the remaining closing tasks, her movements abrupt, jerky, clumsy. Her eyes kept flicking nervously towards the front window, towards the sheet-covered bed, even as she desperately, obviously, tried not to. When we locked up, she mumbled a hasty goodbye without meeting my eyes and practically sprinted to her car, fumbling her keys, tires squealing sharply on the dry asphalt as she peeled away into the night as if fleeing for her life.



I never saw Sarah again. When Henderson returned the following Monday, looking infuriatingly tanned, rested, and placid ‚Äì almost glowing ‚Äì I cautiously asked about her, if she‚Äôd left any notes. He just gave the wide-eyed smile, that mask sliding effortlessly back into place, his gaze sliding past my shoulder towards the showroom floor, lingering for a moment on the SR-001. ""Her temporary assignment concluded precisely as scheduled, Alex. A temporary measure, efficiently fulfilled, as planned."" His tone was utterly flat, devoid of inflection or curiosity, discouraging further inquiry with chilling, absolute finality. The implication hung heavy and cold and suffocating in the air between us. Sarah broke the rules. Sarah saw something. Sarah was gone.



After Sarah's departure, after that night of shared, unspoken terror, the sounds escalated, becoming bolder, more frequent, less ambiguous. Not just the dry scratching, but the other sound, the one that truly burrowed under my skin and began to colonize my waking thoughts. A soft, rhythmic presence. Like slow, quiet breathing, but deeper, more resonant, possessing a strange, heavy, organic texture. Like air being steadily drawn into and expelled from something ancient and impossibly worn, like enormous, cracked leather bellows working gently, patiently, rhythmically, in the suffocating dark behind me. Huuuuh‚Ä¶ huuuuh‚Ä¶ It always started immediately after 8:50 PM, after the final light switch clicked off, always seemed to emanate directly from SR-001. Ignoring it became a nightly ordeal, a white-knuckled battle of will against my own screaming senses and the rising tide of raw panic that threatened to engulf me.



Over those final two weeks, the dread became a constant companion, a heavy shroud clinging to me even in daylight, tinting everything with grey anxiety. My shifts transformed into exercises in controlled terror, bordering on complete dissociation. I moved through the motions ‚Äì checklist, vacuum, wiping, locking ‚Äì like an automaton, functioning on autopilot while my ears strained in the gloom, cataloging the soft, impossible, sickeningly organic sounds that seemed to swell and fade behind me with horrifying regularity. I started dreading the approach of 8:45 PM like a condemned man awaiting the final, inexorable turn of the clock's hand towards midnight. Sleep became a forgotten country, fragmented and shallow when it came at all, haunted by faint rustling sounds and rhythmic sighs I couldn't be sure were real or just echoes permanently lodged in my exhausted, fraying brain. I thought constantly, obsessively, about quitting. Just walk out, mid-shift, leave everything, never look back. Forget the money, forget the degree. But the rent was still due, my bank account was a gaping wound, and the relentlessly logical, terrified part of my brain kept screaming ‚Äì what tangible proof did I have? Weird sounds? A freaked-out temp? An odd feeling? Who would possibly believe me? ""I left my stable, full-time job because I thought a high-end mattress was breathing?"" I needed the money. Or maybe, a darker, more insistent part whispered during the long, silent, terrifying hours, maybe I needed undeniable proof before I could grant myself permission to finally, irrevocably flee.



One night, perhaps the third or fourth before the end, the low huuuuh sound was joined by something new, something sharp that cut through the dread. A faint, intermittent tap‚Ä¶ tap‚Ä¶ tap‚Ä¶ Dry, light, yet insistent. Like something hard ‚Äì a long fingernail? a sharpened piece of bone? ‚Äì gently, deliberately rapping against the inside of a thick cardboard box, testing its confines. It came, undeniably, from the SR-001. My hand froze on the penultimate light switch, the one bathing the front third of the store in weak, revealing light. A powerful, primal, almost overwhelming urge surged through me ‚Äì flip the lights back on, consequences be damned, stride over there, rip off the sheet with both hands, and see what the hell was making that noise, what was trapped or waiting inside. My fingers actually tightened on the cool plastic switch, ready to defy everything, ready to know. But then Rule 17 slammed back into my mind with the force of a physical blow, Henderson's placid, smiling, utterly inhuman face superimposed over the memory of the laminated text. Do not investigate. Maintain absolute focus. Complete the sequence without deviation. Cold sweat broke out on my forehead, trickling into my eyes, stinging. I forced my hand down, plunging the area into deeper shadow, and practically ran through the rest of the closing procedures, the insidious tapping sound seeming to follow me, echoing slightly in the cavernous space, all the way to the front door. That night, the ingrained fear, the conditioning, the sheer power of the rules, was still stronger than the desperate need for proof. But it was terrifyingly close. The internal battle left me shaking.



The worst night‚Ä¶ the last night‚Ä¶ arrived cold and unnervingly clear. An unnaturally still night, the silence outside the store profound, absolute, offering no cover, no acoustic distraction, amplifying every sound within. I was already frayed beyond measure, running on stale coffee and sheer, brittle, vibrating adrenaline. I‚Äôd barely slept the previous night, convinced the rhythmic creaking from my own cheap mattress frame across the room was syncing up with something else, something distant and resonant and waiting. Walking into the brightly lit, cheerful, utterly mundane showroom that afternoon felt like willingly stepping into a meticulously baited, brightly illuminated trap designed just for me.



I performed the closing rituals with the hyper-focused, trembling precision of a bomb disposal expert handling unstable, sweating explosives. Dimming sequence perfect, each click deliberate, final, echoing. Checked the sheet on SR-001 ‚Äì completely covered, corners tucked tight, its smooth white surface betraying nothing in the residual light filtering from the street. Avoid looking. Don't look. Don't fucking look. The huuuuh‚Ä¶ huuuuh‚Ä¶ sound started almost the instant the main lights extinguished, louder tonight, sharper, more‚Ä¶ present, seeming to occupy the air itself. My hands were slick with sweat as I fumbled with the cash drawer keys, dropping them once with a clatter that echoed like a dropped tray in the silence, making me jump violently.



I was wiping down the front counter, forcing myself with monumental effort to keep my back mostly to the showroom, focusing intently on the repetitive squeak of the damp cloth on the laminate surface, trying to anchor myself to the mundane. The rhythmic huuuuh‚Ä¶ huuuuh‚Ä¶ was constant now, a heavy bass note under the crushing silence, seeming to vibrate not just in the air but deep within my own chest cavity. And then, the other sound returned, weaving through it, louder and hideously more distinct than ever before. A wet, soft clicking. Viscous. Lingering. Like teeth coated in thick, stringy saliva gently clicking, chattering together with slow deliberation. Click-uh‚Ä¶ click-uh‚Ä¶ huuuuh‚Ä¶



A wave of bile rose hot and stinging in my throat, cold sweat plastering my hair to my temples. Ignore it. Maintain focus. Do not investigate. The rules were a frantic, useless prayer wheel spinning madly in my head. But the sounds were so present, so physically close, so viscerally wrong, embedding themselves like barbed, parasitic hooks directly into my brainstem. I finished wiping the counter, my movements robotic, detached, watching my own hands move as if from a great distance. I walked stiffly towards the front door, eyes glued to the repeating diamond pattern of the worn floor tiles, counting them obsessively like stepping stones over a black, churning, bottomless abyss. Click-uh‚Ä¶ huuuuh‚Ä¶ click-uh‚Ä¶ huuuuh‚Ä¶ The sounds seemed to follow, swirling around me like unseen flies, amplified in the cavernous room. Closer now. Definitely closer. I could feel it ‚Äì a subtle but undeniable change in the air pressure around me, a localized drop in temperature that prickled my skin with painful gooseflesh, entirely unrelated to the dormant A/C system. And that smell ‚Äì lavender and pennies ‚Äì surged suddenly, overwhelmingly strong and cloying, gagging me, thick and metallic in the back of my throat. Beneath my worn sneakers, through the thin rubber soles, I felt it distinctly now ‚Äì a faint, low-frequency vibration pulsing steadily up from the floor, seemingly centered directly beneath the SR-001's platform. A deep, slow, rhythmic thrum. Like something huge and ancient and resting, stirring slowly within its confines. Preparing.



I reached the door. Key in the lock, scraping loudly against the metal plate in the ringing, expectant silence. Turned it. Click. The deadbolt slid home with a sharp, final crack. I waited, breath trapped painfully in my chest, every muscle locked board-stiff, listening with an intensity that felt like it might rupture my eardrums. The sounds continued, hideously clear in the charged silence. Right behind me. So close I felt a phantom breath on the back of my neck. Click-uh‚Ä¶ huuuuh‚Ä¶ The vibration in the floor seemed to intensify for a sickening second, a heavy, deliberate pulse.



Thunk. The heavy magnetic lock engaged with satisfying, heavy, absolute finality.



Relief crashed over me, dizzying, nauseating, almost bringing me to my knees. My legs threatened to buckle. I gripped the cold metal handle of the door like a drowning man gripping wreckage, ready to burst out into the clean, cold, blessedly normal night air and run until my lungs burned and my legs gave out.



But as I pulled the door open, the cool, blessedly ordinary air hitting my face, something inside me finally fractured. Snapped clean in two, the tension releasing in a silent, devastating implosion. All the weeks of gnawing fear, the rationalizations crumbling hour by hour, the suffocating isolation, Sarah's terrified face flashing in my memory like a strobe light, the constant, oppressive weight of the unknown, the tapping, the breathing, the clicking ‚Äì it all coalesced into a single, unbearable point of psychic pressure. Against every warning ringing like frantic sirens in my head, against Henderson‚Äôs flat, explicit prohibitions, against my own screaming survival instinct ‚Äì that dark, desperate, fundamentally human need for proof, for one concrete image to validate the encroaching madness, finally, irrevocably, overrode everything else. I had to see. I couldn't live with not knowing anymore. Not one more second.



I glanced back. It wasn't even a conscious decision. An involuntary spasm of the neck.



Just a quick, furtive glance over my shoulder, through the widening gap of the door, at the Somnus Platinum Restorative SR-001 basking in the weak, sallow, revealing glow of the distant streetlamp.



The white sheet was still covering it. Pristine. Smooth. Immobile.



Except it wasn't smooth anymore. And it certainly, horrifyingly, wasn't immobile.



My panic-stricken mind struggled to process the image, searing it onto my memory forever. The sheet was pulled taut, stretched impossibly tight over something underneath. Something that was vaguely, mockingly human-shaped, but grotesquely elongated, impossibly thin, the limbs beneath the fabric looking stretched and distorted beyond breaking point, like medieval rack victims hidden under a crisp white shroud. The proportions were nightmarishly, fundamentally wrong, alien. The lump where the head should be was far too small, disturbingly oblong, tilted back at an unnatural, broken angle as if gazing blindly towards the ceiling tiles. And the sheet‚Ä¶ dear God, the sheet itself was moving. Not just rustling. It was slowly, subtly, rhythmically pulsing. Expanding and contracting almost imperceptibly, like the shallow, diseased inflation and deflation of some enormous, pale lung. In perfect, sickening time with that hideous, wet huuuuh‚Ä¶ sound that now seemed to emanate from the very fabric.



And from the distorted head-lump, even through the thick, opaque white fabric, I saw it ‚Äì a dark, wet patch was slowly, sickeningly spreading outwards like a blooming ink stain on blotter paper. Viscous, glistening obscenely, like thick, dark saliva, or something fouler, staining the pristine white a deep, shimmering, oily grey in the dim, unforgiving light. That‚Äôs where the wet clicking was coming from. Click-uh‚Ä¶ click-uh‚Ä¶ A sound of‚Ä¶ testing? Tasting the air? Preparing to emerge?



I didn't scream. I couldn't. The air punched out of my lungs in a silent, agonizing gasp that left me momentarily blind, stars exploding behind my eyes. My vision tunneled to frantic pinpricks of light. I stumbled back violently, tripping over the threshold, catching myself painfully on the doorframe, slammed the heavy glass door shut with a resounding crash that echoed like a gunshot down the unnaturally quiet street, rattling the entire frame in its housing, and ran. I didn't look back again. I ran blindly, fueled by pure, adrenalized, primal terror, legs pumping mechanically beneath me, lungs burning, the sounds ‚Äì huuuuh‚Ä¶ click-uh‚Ä¶ huuuuh ‚Äì echoing not just in the empty street behind me but inside my skull, sharp, visceral, undiluted, unforgettable.



Shivering uncontrollably, fumbling frantically with my phone under the buzzing, flickering, indifferent halo of a streetlight blocks away, nausea churning violently in my gut threatening to expel the little I'd eaten, I somehow managed to stab out a text to Henderson with trembling thumbs: ""I CAN'T WORK THERE ANYMORE. I QUIT.""



His reply came back almost instantly. Disturbingly, inhumanly fast. Just two words, stark white against the black screen, devoid of punctuation or query or any semblance of human warmth:



""Understood Rest well""



I never got that last paycheck. I didn't dare go back, didn't dare call, blocked his number immediately with a visceral shudder. I broke my lease the very next day, paid a crippling penalty that wiped out my meager savings and plunged me into terrifying debt, moved to a different, distant part of the city under a heavy cloud of paranoia, terrified that somehow, something might have my forwarding address, might know where I went. I threw out my mattress ‚Äì the perfectly normal, inanimate object suddenly felt profoundly unsafe, alien, potentially permeable, a potential hiding place ‚Äì and slept on a pile of blankets on the cold, hard floor for weeks, jerking awake at every sound, before I could scrape together enough pathetic cash for the cheapest, thinnest futon I could find at a discount store. Something I could be absolutely certain was empty. Just foam and fabric. Nothing else. Please, God, nothing else.



I don't know what that thing was, or is. I don't know if it's intrinsically part of the SR-001 mattress itself, woven into its very fibers like some obscene technological parasite, or if the mattress is just a vessel, a high-tech cage, maybe even a sophisticated lure designed to draw something in or facilitate‚Ä¶ something else entirely. Does it feed on ambient fear? Bad dreams? The psychic residue of troubled sleep? The raw potential energy of the living? What, exactly, is Henderson's role in this obscene symbiosis? Is he a willing caretaker, tending his monstrous charge? A deluded worshipper? A detached supplier, procuring‚Ä¶ what? Sacrifices? And the question that claws relentlessly at me during the long, silent, sleepless stretches of the night, the one that guarantees I‚Äôll never truly rest well again: what happens when someone eventually buys that specific floor model? Or any SR-001? Do they take the thing home with them, nestled dormant in the foam? Does Henderson just replace the stained sheet, wipe down the frame, and wait patiently for the next closing shift, the next employee?



All I know for sure is that Somnus Beds is still open. Still expanding, apparently, new franchises popping up like fungal blooms after a storm. They're still running those offensively cheerful commercials on late-night TV and streaming services, promising rejuvenating slumber and perfect spinal alignment with bright, dead, vacant smiles. They're still selling the Somnus Platinum Restorative model, probably in dozens, maybe hundreds, of brightly lit, sterile showrooms across the country, maybe the world. And every single night, somewhere, perhaps in multiple locations simultaneously, someone is performing the closing procedures. Dimming the lights in precise, ritualistic sequence. Checking the corners of a pristine white sheet. Trying very, very hard not to look too closely as the clock ticks past 8:50 PM. Trying desperately, perhaps sometimes failing, to ignore the sounds. Trying to pretend, against all evidence, it‚Äôs just the building settling.



Sometimes, very late at night, when the house finally settles into its deepest silence and the darkness outside the window feels absolute, pressing close like a physical weight, I think I can still hear it. Faintly, like a phantom echo carried on the edge of hearing, or maybe just bubbling up unbidden from the scarred pathways of memory, impossible to erase.



Huuuuh‚Ä¶ click-uh‚Ä¶



Rest well? Henderson‚Äôs sign-off wasn‚Äôt a pleasantry. It wasn't a wish. It was a curse. A final, mocking reminder of the peace I lost forever in that sterile, silent showroom, sacrificed on the altar of a good night's sleep. I don't think I ever truly will rest well again.
