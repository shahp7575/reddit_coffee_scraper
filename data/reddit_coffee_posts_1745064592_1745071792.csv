Later that night, Elena sat at her grandmother’s creaky old desk, staring at Memento Mori. Cassie sprawled on the couch, scrolling through her phone fast enough to catch it on fire, looked up for a moment and being the ultimate smartass said,

     “So,” “are you waiting for the diary to start narrating your life like it’s the opening credits of a horror movie?”

     “I’m just... thinking.”

     “Oh good,” Cassie said. “Thinking. That’s never gone wrong for you before.”

     “I was considering writing something in it.”

     Cassie’s phone hit the couch. “I’m sorry, you were what now?”

     “Just... a test.”

     “Yeah, that’s how they describe it on the Unsolved Mysteries episode — right before the neighbors start finding body parts in the garden.”

     “I’m serious.” Elena grabbed a pen.

     “Oh great, let’s poke the evil and see what happens,” Cassie muttered. “I’ll grab a fire extinguisher.”

     Elena ignored her and scrawled a few words:

     Found this diary in the attic. Feels weird. Cassie’s being dramatic, but I can’t shake the feeling this thing... matters.

“Riveting,” Cassie said. “Really laying the groundwork for your Pulitzer.”

Then the ink moved.

Elena froze. “Uh... Cassie?”

Cassie glanced up — and screamed loud enough to scare a burglar two houses away. “NOPE. NOPE. NOPE.”

The words on the page rearranged themselves:

""Thank you for opening me.""

Cassie bolted off the couch. “What part of ‘NOPE’ aren’t you hearing right now?”

“It’s... writing itself.” Elena’s voice wobbled.

Cassie flapped her hands like she was trying to shoo away the devil. “Nope! Nope! This is exactly how you end up eating spiders in a basement while something whispers Latin at you!”

More words appeared:

""I'm here for a reason, and you can help me become free... I grant desires, but only three.""

Cassie’s jaw dropped. “Okay, nope times infinity. That’s literally the plot of every horror movie I’ve ever screamed at.”

“Relax,” Elena said, even though she absolutely was not relaxed. “I’m not making a wish.”

“Great,” Cassie huffed. “Because if you so much as whisper ‘I wish for a pony,’ I’m driving to Mexico.”

But curiosity gnawed at Elena. Before she could stop herself, she whispered, “I wish to know the truth.”

Cassie’s hands shot to her face. “Oh my God, you DID NOT.

Chapter Three: Unholy Bargaining  
Someone pounded on the door.

The kind of pounding that said, I’m not here for polite conversation.

“Oh no,” Elena muttered.

“Oh YES,” Cassie shot back. “I told you! Congratulations, The master of dumbass wishes is here”!!!
Elena dragged herself to the door and yanked it open.

The man on the other side wore a tailored suit made of pure menace. His smile belonged to someone who enjoyed tax audits and running over handicapped old ladies in crosswalks.

“Evening,” he said smoothly. “Mind if I come in?”

“Oh absolutely not,” Elena said flatly. “Who are you?”

His grin widened. “You invited me.”

Cassie gagged on her own spit. “You summoned a demon booty call Elena?”

“I wished for the truth, not a booty call dammit!!” Elena barked.

“Oh, but truth’s my specialty,” the stranger said, stepping closer. “You can call me... Unholy.”

Cassie snorted. “That’s not a name, that’s a rejected energy drink flavor.”

Unholy chuckled darkly. “And yet, here I am.”

“Look,” Elena said, rubbing her temples, “if you’re here to tell me I need more fiber or that my horoscope says 'prepare for death,' I’ll pass.”

“Oh no,” Unholy purred. “I’m here because you’ve made a... fascinating trade.”

Elena frowned. “What trade?”

Unholy’s smile stretched wider. “Well... you traded your life as you knew it. But don’t worry.” He winked. “I’ll make it entertaining.”

Cassie grabbed her popcorn bowl again. “Oh, I’m so glad I didn’t leave.


Elena stood frozen in the doorway, glaring at the smug man in the shadow-woven suit.

""Yeah... no,"" she said, starting to close the door.

Unholy slapped his hand against the wood and grinned. ""Ah, c'mon now. You wished for the truth."" He leaned in. ""And I brought snacks.""

Cassie’s head popped into view. ""Wait, snacks?""

""Don’t encourage him,"" Elena snapped.

Unholy held up a paper bag. “Cheddar popcorn, the good kind.”

Cassie gasped. “The white cheddar or the fake-orange powder stuff?”

“White cheddar,” Unholy purred.

Cassie grabbed Elena’s arm. “Okay, let him in — but only because I’m weak and this is important.”

“You’re seriously negotiating with the devil over popcorn?”

“Hey,” Cassie said, “I’m not proud.”

With a sigh that felt like giving up on life itself, Elena stepped aside.

Unholy strolled in like he owned the place, dropping his shadowy aura across the room like a bad cologne. He tossed the bag of popcorn to Cassie, who caught it like she’d just won the lottery.

“So,” Unholy drawled, loosening his tie like he was about to give a lecture on bad decisions, “let’s talk about your wish.”

“Oh no,” Elena said, crossing her arms. “First, ground rules: No soul-selling, no creepy riddles, and no turning my house into a swirling vortex of doom.”

Unholy smirked. “Wow. Tough crowd.” He flopped onto the couch, spreading himself across it like an exhausted lounge singer. “You’re no fun.”

Cassie plopped down next to him, ripping open the popcorn bag. “You think she’s no fun? This girl alphabetizes her socks.”

“It’s efficient!” Elena shot back.

“You color-code your receipts,” Cassie added, mouth full of popcorn.

“That’s just good financial management!”

“Oh sure,” Unholy cut in, “I can see the headline now: ‘Local Woman Accidentally Summons Demon While Perfecting Her Filing System.’”

Cassie snorted so hard popcorn flew across the room.

“Okay!” Elena barked, dragging over a chair and plopping down. “What exactly did I sign up for here?”

Unholy steepled his fingers like a guy who was way too excited about bad news. “Well, you wished for the truth, and that’s what I deal in. Problem is…” His grin widened. “The truth’s a slippery little beast. Sometimes it’s helpful... sometimes it’s a punch to the face with brass knuckles.”

“Neat,” Elena said. “Can you skip to the part where I regret everything?”

“Oh sure,” Unholy said cheerfully. “See, every wish has a price. Yours? Well…” He gestured vaguely at her living room.

“What? My house?” Elena squinted.

“Oh no,” Unholy said. “Your life. The details you thought you knew? The nice, cozy world where everything makes sense?” He grinned wider. “Gone.”

Elena stared. “I’m sorry… what?”

“You wished for the truth,” Unholy said matter-of-factly. “So now... you get to know everything. Secrets you shouldn’t know. Lies you thought were facts. The real reason your Wi-Fi keeps cutting out? I know that, too.”

Cassie swallowed a mouthful of popcorn. “Wait. Wait, wait, wait. So, like... you’re just gonna info-dump her entire life’s drama like it’s a season finale cliffhanger?”

“More or less,” Unholy said, inspecting his fingernails like he was bored.

“Okay,” Elena muttered, rubbing her temples. “Tell me something — if I wanted to undo the wish... what would it take?”

Unholy grinned like she’d just handed him a winning lottery ticket. “Ahh, now we’re talking! Well, you could back out — but it’ll cost you.”

“Great,” Elena deadpanned. “Lemme guess. My soul?”

“Oh no, no,” Unholy chuckled. “Too cliché. I’m more creative than that.”

“...What’s the price?”

Unholy’s grin widened. “You let me crash here for a bit.”

Cassie spat out her popcorn. “I’m sorry, WHAT?”

“Relax,” Unholy said with mock innocence. “I won’t even redecorate.”

“You’re a demon,” Elena snapped. “Why would I let you sleep on my couch?”

“I’ll do chores,” Unholy said. “I make amazing coffee. Better than those hipster cafes where everyone’s beard smells like pinecones.”

“Still a no,” Elena said.

“I can also tell you people’s darkest secrets,” Unholy added, wagging his eyebrows. “I know exactly who’s been stealing Amazon packages off your porch.”

Cassie gasped. “Wait, was it—”

“Oh yeah,” Unholy cut in. “It’s Todd. Guy two houses down. Total porch pirate. Even wears fingerless gloves for ‘stealth.’” and sell all the items on Facebook Marketplace under the name Tiffany.

“I knew it!” Cassie shrieked.

“Still no,” Elena said.

Unholy tapped his chin. “Okay… how about this? Let me stay for three days — just three — and I’ll fix your car.”

“My car doesn’t need fixing,” Elena said flatly.

“Ohhhh,” Unholy chuckled darkly. “It will.”

Elena groaned. “Fine. Three days. But if you even think about pulling some cursed nonsense—”

“I’m an honest demon,” Unholy said, placing a hand over his chest like he’d just been knighted.

“That’s not a thing!” Elena shot back.

“It is when you’re this good at lying.” Unholy smirked.



She just had to survive three days.
Chapter Four: Tyrannosaurus Wrecks

Morning sunlight streamed through the curtains, giving Elena’s living room a warm, calm glow — which was a complete lie because there was nothing calm about the demon currently parading around her kitchen in a fluffy pink robe.

“Morning, mortals!” Unholy announced like a deranged game show host, strutting into the room with Elena’s robe cinched tightly at the waist like he was starring in a demonic skincare commercial.

Cassie, sprawled on the couch, blinked at him in disbelief. “Oh good. Satan’s here for brunch.”

“You mock,” Unholy said, dramatically adjusting the robe’s sleeves with the precision of a runway model, “but you two are lucky I showed up like this.”

“Oh?” Elena muttered, staggering in with tangled hair and a mug of coffee large enough to double as a weapon. “What’s your better alternative?”

Unholy grinned smugly, the fuzzy pink robe swishing dramatically as he turned. “Well, technically, I used to appear as a T-Rex.”

Cassie froze mid-spoonful of cereal. “I’m sorry... WHAT?”

“A Tyrannosaurus Rex,” Unholy repeated proudly, like this was a perfectly normal thing to say. “60 feet tall. Claws like steak knives. Absolutely majestic. Cavemen practically worshipped me. One guy started calling me The Angry Thunder Chicken.”

“You’re telling me,” Elena said slowly, “that you used to terrorize cavemen as a giant dinosaur?”

“Oh yeah,” Unholy said proudly, pouring himself coffee like he owned the place. “Sometimes I’d roar just for effect. Other times I’d just stand there... silently.” He paused, smiling fondly. “Really freaked them out. Nothing unsettles a caveman quite like a T-Rex just... watching you build a fire.”

“Why?” Elena demanded. “Why would you even do that?”

Unholy shrugged. “I was figuring out my vibe. The whole ‘tall, dark, and charming’ look?” He gestured to himself with a dramatic flourish of the robe. “Didn’t happen overnight. The T-Rex phase? Iconic — but honestly? Kinda inconvenient.” He sighed dramatically. “You ever try squeezing your giant lizard head into a cave to collect a soul? My arms couldn’t even reach past my chest! Awful design.”

“Yeah, tragic,” Cassie muttered. “Truly the dinosaur was nature’s greatest victim.”

“Oh, they felt bad for me sometimes,” Unholy mused. “One tribe started giving me goats. Not as sacrifices — just... stress goats. I’d stomp around all mad, and they’d roll out a goat like, ‘Here, big guy, chill out. Pet the goat.’” He sipped his coffee, smiling fondly. “Cavemen? Total innovators.”

Cassie grinned. “Okay, that's actually adorable.”

“Right?” Unholy beamed. “But noooo, management didn’t like it. Said a towering reptile wasn’t ‘on-brand.’” He rolled his eyes dramatically, adjusting his pink robe again like it physically pained him to say the words. “Now I’m stuck like this. Don’t get me wrong —” He posed smugly. “— I wear this well. But honestly?” He leaned closer, lowering his voice. “I kinda miss the T-Rex thing.”

“Well,” Elena said dryly, “if you ever decide to rejoin the dinosaur circuit, let me know so I can book a flight. To, like... Japan.”

“Relax,” Unholy said, sprawling onto the couch like he paid rent. “I’m a guest in your home. It’s not like I’m about to—”

The lamp beside him flickered violently, sparked, and exploded with the force of a caffeine-fueled raccoon in a power box.

“—accidentally channel dark energy through your wiring,” Unholy finished with a wince.

“Oh good,” Elena muttered. “Because what this house really needed was an electrically unstable demon in a pink robe.”

“I’ll fix it,” Unholy said confidently, waving his hand.

“With what tools?” Cassie asked. “Unless you’ve got a demonic Home Depot in your pocket.”

Unholy smirked. “I don’t need tools.” He held up his hands like a magician about to cut someone in half. “I have... Demonic Energy.”

Cassie stared blankly. “So... you’re about to magic-fix a lamp?”

“Absolutely.”

“You’ve done this before, right?” Elena asked warily.

“Pfft.” Unholy scoffed. “I once rewired an entire castle in the 13th century using nothing but demonic energy and blind optimism.”

“How’d that turn out?” Cassie asked.

“Well... the north tower did catch fire,” Unholy admitted. “But I maintain that was mostly structural rot and, like, one-third my fault.”

Elena groaned. “Fine. Fix the lamp. But if my house burns down, I’m haunting you.”

Unholy cracked his knuckles like a man preparing to do something deeply ill-advised. “Prepare to be amazed.”

He grabbed the lamp, narrowed his eyes, and muttered something that sounded like a cat being sucked into a vacuum cleaner.

The lamp flickered. Buzzed.

And then —

BOOM!

The lamp shot across the room like a missile, embedding itself in the wall above Elena’s bookshelf.

“TA-DA!” Unholy declared proudly, posing like he’d just won an Olympic medal.

Cassie howled with laughter. “Oh my GOD, you’re terrible at this!”

“Okay, okay,” Unholy said, raising his hands in surrender. “I may have overdone it.”

“You think?” Elena snapped, pointing at the still-smoking hole in her wall. “You turned my lamp into a surface-to-air missile!”

“Well,” Unholy muttered, sipping his coffee like a man who no longer respected consequences, “at least nobody’s dead.”

“I might die,” Cassie wheezed between giggles. “From joy.”

Elena glared at Unholy. “From now on, you’re forbidden from ‘helping.’”

“Fair,” Unholy said, still proudly adjusting the pink robe. “But I’m pretty sure that lamp had bad vibes. Honestly? I did you a favor.”

“Yeah, sure,” Elena muttered. “Next time, just punch a hole in my wall directly. Save us all the suspense.”

“Noted,” Unholy said with a smug grin.

Cassie wiped tears from her eyes. “I can’t believe this is only day one.”

“Three days,” Elena muttered to herself. “Three days and this lunatic is gone.”

“Or,” Unholy chimed in cheerfully, “three days... and you’ll love having me around so much you’ll beg me to stay!”

Elena shot him a deadpan look. “I would sooner invite back my toxic ex and let him DJ my funeral.”

Unholy’s grin stretched wide.

“Challenge accepted.”

1k2wuvf,https://www.reddit.com/r/srilanka/comments/1k2wuvf/my_endometriosis_journey_second_surgery/,My Endometriosis Journey & Second Surgery Experience in Sri Lanka (Hope this helps someone!),"Hey everyone,  

Just wanted to share my experience with endometriosis and the two surgeries I’ve had in Sri Lanka — hoping it helps someone out there who's navigating the same mess. This is purely based on my personal journey, not medical advice, but I wish I'd found something like this when I was first diagnosed.

---

**What is Endometriosis (in simple terms):**  
It’s a lifelong condition where tissue similar to the lining of the uterus grows in places it shouldn’t — like ovaries, fallopian tubes, bowels, and even near other organs. These tissues go through your normal period cycle, but since they’re in the wrong place, the blood can’t exit your body, so it causes inflammation, pain, and cysts (called “chocolate cysts”).

It causes:
- Severe period pain
- Fertility issues
- Intense bloating
- Digestive problems  
...and unfortunately, it has no known cause or cure.

---

**My First Surgery – 2019 (Age 19)**  
I had no idea I had endometriosis until I had an emergency surgery for a ruptured chocolate cyst (around 10cm). It was done at Nawaloka Hospital by Dr. Alwishewa.

It was laparoscopic — they drained the ruptured cyst but left another one inside because it was risky to remove. What shocked me the most? Right after surgery, the doctor told me to “get married and have a baby soon” to fix it. I was 19.

Post-surgery, I was put on a 6-month hormone injection course that stopped my periods and put me in temporary menopause. Side effects were *rough*:
- Intense heat flushes from head to toe
- Urinary infections (because the injection is super “heaty”)
- General discomfort and fatigue

I had to stop the course after 4 months because it was too strong for my body. After that, my cycle became super irregular for a while — took about 2 years to become monthly again.

During that time, I focused on diet and lifestyle changes:
- Avoided soda, coffee, and red meat (massive bloating triggers)
- Drank lots of water and chamomile tea
- Ate cooling foods like cucumber and basil seeds

---

**Second Surgery – 2025 (Age 25)**  
I started having pain again and scans showed two cysts (one on each ovary, joined together, around 9x4cm). I visited *six* doctors before choosing Dr. Sudheera Uduwela at Ninewells Hospital — absolutely recommend him. He took the time to explain everything, didn’t rush me, and had a bowel surgeon assist because of potential adhesions (which were present, a lot of them).

**The surgery details:**
- Admitted at 4PM, surgery scheduled for 10PM (but happened at midnight due to an emergency)
- Had to do bowel prep 6 hours before (absolutely not fun)
- Laparoscopic surgery went well — both cysts removed, fallopian tubes cleared

**Total cost:** Around **400,000 LKR** (including hospital stay, surgeon, bowel specialist, etc.)

---

**Recovery:**  
- First 2 days were tough because of CO2 gas pain (used to expand the abdomen during surgery). Walking helped *a lot*.
- On Day 3, my feet swelled due to some lymphatic fluid retention (normal post-surgery, according to my doctor). Massage + rest fixed it.
- **Full recovery took less than a week.** I was walking around, eating normally, and honestly shocked at how quickly my body bounced back.

And the BEST part?  
**My bloating significantly reduced after this surgery.**  
For the first time in years, I felt light. It made such a difference physically and mentally.

At my 2-month follow-up scan — everything was clear. No cysts. No adhesions. Hoping it stays that way (but we all know endo is sneaky).

---

**A few tips from me to you:**
- Visit multiple doctors until you find one you *trust* and feel comfortable with. Don’t settle.
- Do your own research and ask questions. Knowledge = power.
- Diet and lifestyle actually do help with symptoms. It’s not a cure, but it makes life easier.
- Trust your gut. If something feels off, speak up.
- You are not alone. It’s a lonely disease sometimes, but there’s a whole community out there who *get it*. 

There’s a page on insta & facebook called ‘ESAF Sri Lanka’ that you can check out. Not much but it’s something. 

If you’re going through this, I genuinely wish you healing and strength. And if you have questions about doctors in SL or the surgery experience, feel free to ask — I’ll help however I can.

1k2wuag,https://www.reddit.com/r/usvisascheduling/comments/1k2wuag/new_h1b_visa_interview_experience_chennai/,New H1B Visa Interview Experience - Chennai Consulate,"I had my H1B visa interview at the Chennai consulate on 15 April. Sharing my interview experience

Me: Hello, good morning

VO: (ignores, continues to sip coffee)

VO: Can you pass your passport?

Me: (passes passport)

VO: What does \[CompanyName\] do?

Me: \[Answer\]

VO: Is \[CompanyName\] service-based or product-based?

Me: Service-Based

VO: Who is your client?

Me: \[ClientCompanyName\]

VO: Where is your client located?

Me: \[ClientComapnyName\] is headquartered in \[CityName\] but also has an office in \[WorkLocationInDS160\]

VO: Where will you be working from?

Me: \[CompanyName\]'s office in \[WorkLocationInDS160\]

VO: What does \[ClientCompanyName\] do?

Me: \[Answer\]

VO: What is your salary?

Me: \[Salary\]

VO: Your H1B Visa has been approved. You will get your passport in the next 3-5 days

Proceeds to retake all fingerprints (I had completed my biometrics in Mumbai a few days back). Got my passport yesterday with the visa sticker.

I was not asked for any documents or proofs, only my passport. I think I was asked a lot of questions because it was a new H1B visa. 

Tips/Suggestions

\- Visit the consulate a day before, just to get familiar with the place, and also to know how much time it takes to get to the consulate.

\- Dress well. I wore a blue shirt with formal pants and black polished shoes.

\- If you are not from Chennai, i recommend staying in ""The Park"" hotel. It's 200 meters from the consulate. Super convinient if you forget something.

\- Go early. I had an 8:00 AM appointment, I was there at 7:15 AM and i was out by 8:30 AM.

\- Keep all your documents organized. I would recommend getting a piano folder.

\- Keep answers short and to the point. Make sure they are consistent with your DS160.

\- Be confident and practice answering questions in front of a mirror to avoid fumbling.

\- Weird observation, but don't try to laugh or smile too much in the interview. Answer what's asked and nothing more.

  
I saw a few students with an F1 application getting rejected. I overheard questions asked by the consular,

\- Why did you apply to \[CollegeName\]?

\- Why did you choose this program?

\- What other colleges did you apply to?

\- What is your plan if I reject your visa application today?

\- What did you study here in India?

I pulled over for a bit to just process and watch from a safe distance. The guy eventually found a spot to sit with a covered space and the doggo came up to him slowly and snuggled into his side. 

I was thinking, “How can I get that poor baby away from him safely?” Yet, in that moment they snuggled, I thought, “That is probably the only medicine he has for whatever his mental health issues might be.” I feel awful about all of it. As a mom, when I see young men and women struggling with mental illness, I can’t help but feel maternal. As a nurse, who has been grabbed and hit by people in poor mental health, I am very wary of safety.

Been working on this side project of mine called **RedCoffee .** It's a small CLI Tool that's written in Python that fetches your SonarQube analysis and generates a clean PDF Report from it.

Initially, I built this to make my life easier at work but somehow ended open-sourcing and actively maintaining it. Somehow, it has crossed 15k+ downloads and I could not be more happier . I know the reason however - I've been shamelessly promoting this on Reddit for quite some time now. I was very curious to see where my users are coming from and hence I made this quick heatmap ( again in Python ) .

Most of my users are from US. HongKong and Singapore comes close second. India and Japan share the 3rd Position. Very happy to see users from Argentina, Italy, Denmark , Brazil , Canada , Russia, Ukraine and Great Britain.

If you are using SonarQube and need to send reports to your lead / manager / clients without giving them access to SonarQube dashboard, RedCoffee might help.

This is a genuine post from a genuine user I really want to find someone

If you are going to be rude or critical please just move on to someone else I’m really not interested I don’t know why some have to be so rude on here I have had some that get really rude and nasty in the replies i have received so far there really is no Need for it 

I am an English guy and I am currently living in France I have been here a few years now I absolutely love it but I’m now wanting to find someone to share my life with. I am very family orientated and family is extremely important to me 

I am seeking a serious relationship I know what I want in life. I have no baggage I’ve never been married before and no previous relationships in fact I’ve never really dated and I’ve never been on dating apps. I won’t bring any drama into your life. 

I’d like to find a woman with similar morals and values and boundaries. I really want to be with someone that really appreciates the way I am I am seeking a nice woman with nice standards like mine. You’ll find out a lot about me on this post. I am seeking a woman that is in her late 20s thats 25+ please to early 30s  please. Maturity is a big thing for me in someone too. 

I’m generally quite a shy guy face to face so this has made it hard meeting others especially women. I am not one of the lads and I also don’t have many friends I prefer quality over quantity when it comes to friends. I am a very polite patient guy that loves talking on voice chat. 

I also don’t like swearing I rarely use bad language vulgar language on online chats or face to face  I am not that type of guy. I also don’t like those that think it’s okay to criticise others this is especially true with being friends. I am probably a bit posh and I would describe myself as being upper middle class.  

I am not one that is into partying I don’t like loud noisy environments I prefer quieter things. I am not one of the lads I have very few male friends. I’m not into bars or nightclubs they really are not my thing. I really like going  to nice restaurants museums a nice beach walking through a park 

I really want to have my own family one day so please be someone that is open to having children in the future I really do want to be a father in the future. I believe I’m very fertile 

I have been totally celibate by choice all my life I only want to be with one woman and share my body with one woman. It has never appealed to me to be with different women and I could never do anything meaningless This has also never appealed to me. I’ve never been tempted by anyone and I’d never just sleep with someone for the sake of it. I don’t view women as one thing and I never will 

I need a strong emotional connection with someone plus I’d have to get to know someone really well ideally friends first 

It really does not appeal to me to even date different women I’ve never been on loads of dates I’m not interested in meeting different women I just want to be with one that’s it just one. 

I do not watch online adult content I don’t want to use the actual word for it and I don’t smoke I don’t drink heavily and I’ve never touched any illegal drugs. I’ve got no bad addictions or bad habits I’ve lived a very clean life. 

I’m not seeking adult chats on Reddit so if you are looking for this please move on I am not that type of guy. 

I take good care of myself I regularly go to the gym and workout often doing intense cardio workouts I’m in very good health. I am a very strong swimmer I’ve always loved swimming doing lengths my favourite stroke is freestyle this is also my strongest I’d love o have someone that loves swimming and keeping active as much as I do. I also love going on long walks I do a lot of brisk walking  often around the coastline here 

I do love my food and I have been raised on home cooked food I love cooking I’m not bad at it and I’d again love to be with someone that also loves her food as much as I do. 

I love eating in nice restaurants too I’ve always been very passionate about this! I also love avocados they are so good for you 

I place a very high value on being intimate with someone it’s not something I just want to do with just anyone and I don’t just want to settle I’ve never just wanted to settle I’m seeking the love of my life someone really special someone I really want to be with. You would be the only woman I would want to come home to at the end of the day. I’d never have an affair or a fling and I’m not into ever having an open relationship. 

I am also someone that sound be very loving supportive kind sweet and caring to you. I will also be very physically affectionate kissing cuddling. 

Where I am in France is very close to the sea it’s an absolutely beautiful place to live France is a Beautiful country. The coastline in this area is beautiful there are some lovely beaches I’ve been to and we have the lovely île de re island nearby I have been there many times it’s also beautiful. 

France is a very peaceful relaxing calm country it’s certainly more peaceful than England. England was too much pressure for me way too stressful too I always wanted to go somewhere else from a very early age. France has amazing food a fantastic healthcare system nice weather in the summer and the winters are not that cold certainly not as cold as England was 

I also love yoga and Pilates both of these I find extremely relaxing they are so good for the body it’s amazing how good it makes you feel after 

I also love photography taking photos is another passion of mine I can easily go out all day and come back with loads of photos to share. I love technology too especially Apple I’m very passionate about it. I have a lot of technology that I use and I do have an iPhone 

I also love music I listen to a lot of classical music during the day at home and I am usually listening to classic FM UK which is classical music 24/7 for those that don’t know. I also love soft rock some of the bands  love are a-ha Keane Queen dire straits I listen to a lot of 70s and 80s music. I’ve seen most of my favourite bands live too I’ve been very lucky with that. 

I also love animals I have a dog she’s a two year old retriever these are the best dogs for me she’s absolutely lovely. I love being with nature too I love taking walks through forests and the countryside I find this very peaceful and relaxing thing to do. I love spending a while day doing this and going for some nice food after 

When it comes to drinks I love red wine it’s my favourite but I only have it in moderation I’ve had some lovely bottles of red wine here in France and some of it is also organic. They make a lot of organic food here in France I organic where ever possible as often as possible. 

I keep junk and fast foods to a minimum and have these as a treat I don’t drink tea and coffee that much I avoid caffeine and I don’t drink sugary drinks that often either. I am not vegan or vegetarian and I can’t ever see myself going either way.  

It’s very important to keep hydrated and I only drink mineral water at least 3L per day and will have more if I go to the gym and have a good workout I always make sure I get myself really sweaty when working out I feel so good after. 

I have to be honest and tell you that I don’t drive I have never passed my test. I also still live at home with my parents at the moment I’m not someone that likes living by myself plus the current cost of living especially in England made living by myself too expensive. 

I will also tell you that I don’t work at the moment please be okay with all of this from the get go I’ve had terrible trouble trying to find suitable jobs but I have got plans for the future for things I’m not lazy or anything like that. I cannot cope with stress and pressure in jobs this is again why I’ve had trouble finding suitable work as I said. 

So onto to my physical appearance well I am 6ft 4 1.94m very tall and I have a rugby player build you would never lose me in a crowd! I have dark blonde hair and hazel eyes I have freckles on my arms and legs. I have very big hands and feet I am a uk size 13 shoe.

I have a very natural body type with some stretch Marks in some places like I say I love being natural and my body is very natural. 

We have very strong genes in my family and we all look younger I don't look My age most say I look like I'm in my late 20s to early 30s. I have no grey hair and I'm not losing any of my hair. I have a full head of nice hair 

I’m not into being ripped and toned having a six pack has never appealed to me. If your seeking men that are a muscular physique then I won’t be for you please move on. 

I have a very deep manly voice which can be loud sometimes. I like to voice chat too rather than messaging so if you are comfortable with this I would prefer it. 

I have a naturally smooth chest arms and legs. I don’t fit in most baths and I have to sleep in a double bed. I love the fact that I’m very tall but it does have its cons I often get asked when I’m in shops to reach things on the top shelf! Plus I walk around the house bare foot and I’m always bashing my feet on things hehe 

I am not addicted to social media and I don’t aspire to look like men on it or those in mainstream films and reality tv shows. I am not politically liberal either. Id like to be with someone that is not obsessed with social media and you don’t watch reality tv. I don’t watch any reality tv at all. 

I have no tattoos no piercings and looking and keeping yourself natural is the best way to go I am a very natural looking man and body to go with it. this is what I believe and it’s how I’ve been raised too. I have no interest in ever having tattoos or piercings of any kind. I’d never have any cosmetic surgery 

I like natural looking women that have natural bodies and that don’t wear heavy makeup also no fake tan or fake nails or fake eyelashes and hair. I also like women that dress modestly and conservatively. I’d prefer someone with no tattoos and not too many piercings please. Also you don’t wear a bikini on the beach that is too skimpy. 

So if you like what you have read then please send me a message and mention red wine in your message! Please can you tell me what you love about being a woman in your message and your age and location and more about you please don’t just say hi or hello I’m unlikely to respond to messages with low effort!

Im an international student applying who‘s graduating in Fall 2026, I genuinely love agriculture and sustainability and it has been one of my passions for years together, im going to post my application and I would love for you guys to tell me what you think :))

Major: Agriculture or Sustainability

Grades: Pretty bad, but I made the honor roll and the deans list throughout, I had a B- and a C throughout all of my semesters for math and English respectively, with A’s in every single other subject :( (For my freshman and sophomore year ONLY) But this year I have a 41/42 in the IB syllabus. I know my grades aren’t the best, which is why I’m putting my extracurriculars below. I’m going to say a 3.75 GPA throughout. But a cumulative of 4 or near 4 for the junior and senior year.

SAT = 1500

I have multiple subject highest awards and I also passed the IGCSE course with distinction.

EC’s:

I lived on a massive estate with daily wage laborers every summer and worked with them, experiencing everything that they did (picking coffee, sweeping leaves etc…). This was paid work and I spent over 1500 hours doing this (worked for 1 month every summer for the past 5 years), I was paid a cumulative salary of 650 USD, I am an international applicant so the wage rates are extremely low and pathetic in my country :(.

I worked with the equivalent of a US congressman to create and develop a website to help assist farmers in times of crisis, we launched the websites last month, I also received government funding for the website and worked as an intern for the ministry of agriculture in my country for 3 years. During my time at the ministry, I wrote a speech that the minister of agriculture delivered in legislative assembly. I also helped draft a set of new regulations that will help mimimise wastage and contribute to a zero-waste economic model. :)

Wrote and published 15 blogs that were viewed more than 5000 times on agriculture in my particular country and ways that will help us move toward a more sustainable future. I wrote a 10,000 word research paper as well, on the sustainability of paddy production in my country.

School related EC’s: Participated in multiple Model United Nations, chaired a committee in Model United Nations. In addition to this, I also am leader of my grade in the student government, with experience as an ambassador to the administration for 6 years.

Social work: Donated 10,000 newspapers to a veterans home near me, they sell these papers to fund their organisation. I also funded 3 large ventilators and worked with the home to supply meals for the elderly veterans. I also worked in a small preschool, helping educate young children on sustainability and the importance of minimising waste. I also helped donate books to fund a small library, while creating a lesson plan that was implemented on sustainable development. I also helped provide fundraise stationary for all the students at the school.

External LORS: One from the minister of agriculture (super high impact), my other one will be from the manager of the estate I worked for for 5 years, extremely raw and impactful

Internal LOR: from my management teacher who has supported my love for sustainability throughout my high school journey (10/10) and my amazing English teacher who knows me super well (8/10), I am not sure how my counselor will write but I am hoping for a 7/10 at least!

If you’re still here, genuinely, thank you :). 😄😄😄😄😄. Please let me know what you think of my application, I’ve always wanted to go to Columbia. You guys are all amazing, have a great rest of your day/night/afternoon! :)",1,1745070165.0,GetIntoStanford,0,1.0,False

1k2wj8u,https://www.reddit.com/r/LawyerAdvice/comments/1k2wj8u/assault_charge/,Assault charge," Long post, sorry.

I was a carer, looking after a young man in his family home, he's non verbal amongst, being autistic and having a growth defect where he's incredibly small and unable to walk, he could roll or bunny hop on the floor, I absolutely adore him and treated him like my own little brother.

HIs family knew this and wanted me working 80+ hours a week as they could trust me. 

The issue is, his mum and dad are very vindictive people, they'll do anything to fuck people over. They just want to drag everyone down. I went through a lot of shit with them, for example I was losing weight for a photoshoot going from 110kg to 70kg. For the entire time, bare in mind I was doing 80+ hours a week, I had them constantly making jokes about calories, my weight or purposely offering me food knowing I couldn't eat it. 

I fully get this example isn't the best examples of the type of people they are but that's really not important.
They'd constant question me where I am on my time off, would refuse holidays as they couldn't cope without me and if I called them to see if everything was ok they'd accuse of calling to hand my notice in. 

So after a while of all the crap I was getting and goal posts being moved in how we need to do the job, my mind was all over the place and I was frustrated, coupled with the fact their son was so attached to me I couldn't leave his living room to go toilet or make a coffee without him causing harm to himself by grabbing at himself and pulling gastro tube out.

This went on for a year and half and I was trying to tell his mum about this to her telling me to figure it out. He would even create if I sat on sofa, which one day I managed to get him to accept me sitting on the sofa while he played with livingroom door, she came in and told him to tell me off because I wasn't allowed to be sitting down. 

Slowly over the next year and half my frustrations grew and grew, they would play on this. His mum said to me one day that my performances had dropped, despite the fact I got care plans sorted, health and safety sorted, got their son doing things he hadn't before and being there all them hours and being the one they can rely upon to even going on holidays. 

So one day I'm in the kitchen making a coffee and their son is creating a lot of fuss, I've said fuck sakes to myself, walked to the living room to comfort him, he starts creating again and I've slapped my thighs to distract him but also because I'm so frustrated and I'm tired. His mum, who was out shopping at the time, came home, went to her office, called in another carer, came into the house together and she went off on me accusing me of slapping their son. I was absolutely shocked as I couldn't believe she would think this of me.

I was dismissed, I walked home which I lived 5 minutes walk from theirs the other carer turned up and said that if I ask to go back, go to therapy then his mum would accept me back. This was all confusing to me.

I messaged his mum and asked to go back which was accepted, was told I'm no longer trusted and needs to build it back up but then I'm left alone with their son and even asked to come in on my day off so they can go to a BBQ. 

A week later I go to a festival with a mate who said to me to come down to where he lives to restart, which I decided to do. 

Once I was back, I stayed working there for a couple of weeks but things just weren't the same, so one day I phoned my clients mum to hand notice in, she weren't happy and a day later I had an email to say I was sacked. 

I moved to where my mate lives and got on with my life, then I had a police officer call to say ive been alleged to have beaten my client and to speak to police where I was. 

I was arrested, held in holding cells for 6 hours, questioned and then put on bail to have a magistrates court case. 

I went to court and there was no concrete evidence against me, just the audio, the police even rejected a picture they had submitted where their son had marks on his head, due to it being created by them. 

They've now got 1 month to hand in any other evidence and my trial case is set at end of the year. 

It's really stressful and I'm absolutely done in they'd think I would hit their son. Yes I can understand that if there's a sound that may sound like someone is being hit then you'd want to question this but I'm just done in.

I wanted to know if it was appropriate to ask a professor to get a drink to discuss work that will directly involve him. Now I get nervous in formal situations, and going out for a drink is common in my field. So I thought it be fine, but I’m worried about appropriateness. 

Consensus with graduate students is that I should not ask a professor to discuss work over a drink. Instead it should be coffee/tea on or near campus, preferable during working hours. I get it. 

The reasoning: 
-It’s unreasonable to ask a professor to spend outside time to speak with me
-In this culture, it’s best to protect myself as a female
-There’s the assumption that I want to sleep with him (absolutely not), but it may be perceived as such

A professor who chimed in, though, said it’s actually a valuable professional skill to learn and get used to situations where you get a drink with a colleague or client. That just because I’m a female it shouldn’t matter if I get a drink with a male professor to discuss work. I’m not worried about this male professor, he’s a good guy, with a great reputation. 

So what are you thoughts professors? Is it appropriate for a PhD student to ask a professor to get a drink to discuss work projects?

1k2wfvm,https://www.reddit.com/r/u_tipstor/comments/1k2wfvm/whats_the_best_breakfast_around_the_world/,“What’s The Best Breakfast Around the World?”,"It began with a piece of burnt toast and the kind of coffee that makes your stomach weep and question every decision you’ve ever made. I was staring at the scorched edges of this culinary abomination, wondering why breakfast, a meal designed to gently usher you into the day like a velvet glove across the cheek, so often feels like a mugging committed by your own kitchen. That’s when the fever hit. The kind of madness only brought on by hunger and jet lag. I needed to know what the rest of the world was eating for breakfast. Not the sanitized versions they teach you in travel brochures, but the real stuff. The weird, the wonderful, the borderline illegal.

This wasn’t about eggs and bacon. This was about truth. About the raw, greasy underbelly of the global breakfast cartel. About congee and croissants, yes, but also fermented fish, mystery meats, and things with eyeballs served to you by a smiling stranger who insists it’s good for virility.

I began in Asia, obviously, because that’s where breakfast gets real. None of this toast-with-jam cowardice. In Hong Kong, I met congee, a grayish, bubbling rice porridge that looks like something scraped off a wizard’s cauldron. This bland sludge becomes transcendent once you load it with pickled vegetables, pork floss, fermented tofu, and an egg that may or may not have been aged in secret since the Qing dynasty. Eating congee is like playing breakfast roulette. You never know if the next bite will taste like heaven or a wet shoe. I respected that.

In Japan, I sat politely while someone served me what looked like dinner for breakfast. Grilled fish, miso soup, steamed rice, and pickles. It was elegant, minimalistic, and completely overwhelming. I ate in silence, chewing slowly while my stomach tried to file a formal complaint with the embassy. Meanwhile, the locals looked serene, as if eating fermented soybean paste before 9 a.m. was the most natural thing in the world. Perhaps it is. Or perhaps they’ve all gone mad and made peace with it. I’m not judging. I finished every bite.

Thailand? Spicy noodles. Vietnam? Pho. An entire bowl of steaming, beefy, herb-laden soup that slaps you in the face and calls you a coward if you don’t finish it. It was 8:15 a.m. and I was sweating like a fugitive in a customs line. Nothing says “good morning” quite like beef broth boiling your internal organs alive while you try to remember if cilantro counts as a vegetable or a warning.

Then I crossed into the Middle East, where breakfast is not just a meal, it’s a full-blown, multi-dish interrogation. In Lebanon, they handed me manakish, a flatbread covered in za’atar and olive oil, and I almost cried. Hummus. Labneh. Olives. Cheese. Piles of food for people who clearly believe in conquering the day with their arteries fully engaged. There’s no room for weakness here. You eat like a sultan or you leave.

In Turkey, I encountered the Turkish breakfast spread, which can only be described as a tactical assault of small plates. Cheese, tomatoes, cucumbers, honey, jam, clotted cream, olives, and bread. Always bread. Bread in a hundred forms. Bread as a subtle threat that you will be fed until you surrender. And tea. Gallons of it. They just keep pouring and smiling, like breakfast dealers slowly seducing your soul with pastries and warm liquids.

Then came Europe, where breakfast is either a delicate affair or a bureaucratic tragedy. In France, I tried the croissant. Flaky, buttery, filled with either chocolate or a disdain for outsiders. It was beautiful, but gone in two bites. A whisper of a meal, like a breeze that smells faintly of butter and judgment. I needed five more. The French disagreed.

In Germany, it was all meat and bread. Cold cuts. Cheese. Pickles. I was handed a pretzel the size of a steering wheel and a sausage that looked like it had survived a war. It was magnificent. Industrial. Efficient. Like being kissed by a robot and slapped by a butcher all at once. I ate in silence while a man named Jürgen watched me to ensure I didn’t disgrace the wurst.

Then came England. The full English was a battlefield of pork products, runny eggs, fried bread, tomatoes that had given up, and those inexplicably present beans, which cling to the plate like a bad memory. It’s the kind of breakfast that could double as a cry for help. But I ate it. I ate every last bean, because I believe in cultural respect, and because my waiter looked like he moonlighted as a pub bouncer with unresolved trauma.

Back in the States, things were different. Pancakes. Waffles. Syrup-drenched sugar bombs masquerading as meals. I once watched a man eat a stack of pancakes so large it needed its own zip code. He didn’t blink. That, I thought, is the American spirit. Diabetic and defiant.

Breakfast is not one thing. It is all things. It is soup and bread, noodles and cheese, fish and fury. It’s quiet. It’s chaotic. It’s judgment in edible form. And while I still don’t know who’s doing it “right,” I do know that anyone who serves dry cereal and a half-hearted orange wedge and calls it breakfast should be tried in international food court.

It's a mahagony coffeetable depicting the map of the world in Robinson Projection measuring 130 x 70 cm. I was consindering the more modern Winkel Triple Projektion but frankly the shape of the Robinson Projection seemed handier as a table 

I've used over 35 different Types of Wood veneer for the countries. The water masses are made out of Double bookmatched walnut burl. I've also used mother of pearl and silver gilding for cardinal direction markers. The negative in the water masses as well as complex coastal lines were Cut using a lasercutter. 

The table top is Made of veneered Blockboard with 5 cm thick Solid wood Edge banding in which a Profile was cut with a shaper and Handheld router. 

The table base was inspired by Waters and aclands tri-table and is Made of Birdseye mahagony and Maple utilizing bent lamination. It will later hold an elliptical brown-glass plate. 

Usually that's a Project one would typically want to finish by French polishing. As this is a table top that's meant to be used I opted for a 2 component acrylate varnish for Maximum protection.

I've attached an imgur link depicting the building process for anybody that's interested.

What should have been the happiest day of my life turned into a complete nightmare.

For context, my ex (34M) and I dated for nearly 8 years before breaking up. It wasn't a bad breakup - we just wanted different things. He didn't want kids, I did. We stayed friends, and he's now happily married to someone who shares his child-free goals. My current husband (36M) and I have been together for 4 years, married for 2.

When I went into labor, my husband was right by my side the entire time. He held my hand through contractions, encouraged me through pushing, and was incredible. My mom was also there as my second support person. Around hour 15, my husband stepped out to grab coffee and some food since we knew it would still be a while.

During this time, my ex unexpectedly showed up at the hospital. Apparently, my mom had texted him (they've always been close). I was surprised but honestly too exhausted to question it. When my daughter finally arrived, my husband was holding my hand, but then immediately went to call his parents to share the news.

In that moment, my ex was standing closer to me than my husband, and the nurse asked who wanted to hold the baby first. Without thinking, I nodded toward my ex. He held her for maybe 30 seconds, took a quick photo with her, said congratulations, and handed her back to me just as my husband returned.

My husband saw this exchange and completely shut down. He barely spoke to me for the rest of our hospital stay. When it was time to be discharged, he coldly informed me that he had ""errands to run"" and left me to find my own way home with our newborn. I had to call my mom to pick us up.

When I finally got home, I found a note saying he was staying with his brother for a while because he ""needed to think."" He's responding to texts only about the baby's needs, but nothing else. He told his brother I ""betrayed"" him by letting another man hold our daughter before him.

I genuinely didn't think it was a big deal at the time. I was exhausted, emotional, and not thinking clearly. I've apologized repeatedly, explaining that I wasn't thinking straight after nearly a day of labor, but he won't budge.

AITA for letting my ex hold our baby first? And is my husband overreacting by abandoning his wife and newborn daughter?

----------------------------------------------------------------------

### Start Small and Choose Quality Products

When you begin adding mushroom supplements into your daily routine, it’s essential to start with a small amount. Many people find that their bodies need time to adjust to these potent natural products. By starting with a low dose, you can observe how your body responds and avoid any unwanted side effects, such as digestive discomfort or mild allergic reactions.

Opt for high-quality supplements from reputable brands. Look for products that specify the mushroom species and detail whether the supplement is derived from fruiting bodies or mycelium, as these can differ in potency and benefits. Certified organic and third-party tested supplements often offer a safer choice, ensuring you get all the beneficial compounds mushrooms provide.

### Incorporate Mushroom Powder into Your Favorite Beverages

Mushroom powders offer a versatile way to boost your diet without drastically changing your eating habits. You can easily add mushroom powder to coffees, teas, smoothies, or even soups. For example, mixing reishi or chaga powder into your morning coffee creates a rich, earthy flavor along with immune-boosting compounds. Similarly, lion’s mane powder blends well with herbal teas and smoothies, offering cognitive support.

One practical tip is to blend mushroom powder with a nutritious base like almond milk or oat milk, which smooths out the texture and taste. If you’re new to mushroom flavors, start with a smaller amount and gradually increase it as you get used to the taste.

### Use Capsules for Convenience and Consistency

Capsules can be a simple and convenient way to include mushroom supplements, especially if you have a busy lifestyle. They offer a precise dosage and are easy to take with minimal preparation. Capsules containing extracts of mushrooms like cordyceps, reishi, or maitake are popular choices because they are concentrated and standardized for specific active compounds.

To ensure maximum benefit, take your capsules according to the product's recommended schedule, often with meals to improve absorption. Keeping capsules in a visible place or setting a daily reminder can help you maintain a consistent routine, which is key to experiencing the long-term advantages of mushroom supplementation.

### Experiment with Cooking Recipes Featuring Mushroom Extracts

If you enjoy cooking, adding mushroom supplements into your recipes can be a satisfying way to nourish your body. Mushroom extracts or powders can be sprinkled onto salads, stirred into sauces, or mixed in with pasta and rice dishes. For example, blending chaga powder into a hearty stew not only enhances flavor but also adds antioxidants to your meal.

Another practical strategy is to use mushroom-infused broths as a base for soups or as a cooking liquid for grains. These broths provide a subtle mushroom taste and concentrate beneficial compounds that support your immune system. Just be sure to add mushroom powders towards the end of cooking to preserve their delicate nutrients.

### Combine with Other Supplements to Amplify Benefits

Mushroom supplements can work synergistically with other natural supplements to maximize health benefits. For instance, pairing lion’s mane, known for cognitive enhancement, with omega-3 fatty acids may support brain health more effectively. Similarly, combining reishi mushrooms, which promote relaxation and immune health, with magnesium can enhance stress reduction and sleep quality.

Before combining supplements, take time to research their interactions or consult a healthcare professional. This ensures you safely stack your nutrients without risking adverse effects. By thoughtfully combining mushroom supplements with other natural products, you can tailor your wellness routine to your unique needs and goals.

With these five practical tips, you can confidently introduce mushroom supplements into your diet in ways that fit your lifestyle and taste preferences. Starting small with quality products, using mushroom powders in drinks and recipes, taking capsules for ease, and pairing supplements wisely will help you unlock the full potential of these remarkable fungi. Embrace the natural boost mushrooms provide and enjoy the many health rewards they offer.

### Exploring Popular Types of Mushroom Supplements

- **Chaga (Inonotus obliquus):** Chaga mushrooms are rich in antioxidants, which may protect cells from damage caused by free radicals. These supplements help reduce oxidative stress and support skin health and overall vitality.

Mushroom supplements into your daily routine can bring multiple benefits tied to their unique compounds:

- **Immune System Support:** Beta-glucans and other polysaccharides in medicinal mushrooms help activate immune cells, providing enhanced defense against pathogens.

- **Anti-Inflammatory Effects:** Mushroom extracts can reduce inflammation, which is linked to numerous health disorders, including arthritis and heart disease.
- **Mental Health Enhancement:** Some mushroom supplements support brain health by stimulating nerve growth factor (NGF), aiding focus, memory, and mood stabilization.
- **Energy and Vitality:** Adaptogenic mushrooms like reishi and maitake help your body manage stress and increase energy levels, fostering endurance and stamina.

### Choosing the Right Mushroom Supplement

With a variety of mushroom supplements available, selecting the right one depends on your personal health needs. Consider these factors when choosing:

- **Form:** Available in powders, capsules, tinctures, and extracts, select a form that fits your lifestyle and maximizes absorption.
- **Purity and Quality:** Opt for supplements that are organic, free from fillers, and have undergone third-party testing to ensure potency and safety.
- **Specific Health Goals:** Align your choice with your goals, whether that’s cognitive enhancement with lion’s mane or immune support with turkey tail.
- **Dosage and Usage:** Follow recommended doses to reap optimal benefits and consult a healthcare professional if you have existing health conditions or take medications.

I’m writing here because I’m carrying something heavy, and I don’t really know what to do with it anymore. Maybe just putting it into words will help. Maybe someone out there will recognize what I’m going through.

Before I tell you the story, I want to add some important context.

Throughout our relationship, we often had conversations — usually initiated by me — about the possibility of Borderline Personality Disorder (BPD). We never reached a clear answer or formal diagnosis, but I know my ex struggled deeply with her mental health: anxiety, depressive episodes, emotional instability. She was on medication, and she carried a lot of pain — real, tangible, overwhelming pain.

The truth is, we never really had the calm or safety to face that together. Things were too intense, too reactive. We never got to say: “Let’s sit down and figure this out as a team.”
Instead, we just kept trying to survive our emotional storms.
Sometimes I triggered her. Sometimes she triggered me. And instead of healing, we chipped away at what we had.

One day — during one of our more emotionally honest conversations, near the end — she told me that she had wondered if she might actually have BPD, or something close to it. She didn’t know for sure.
And the truth is, that moment of clarity came too late.
We were just beginning to put names to the chaos.
But by then… I was already too tired, and she was already too far.
I’m not there anymore — to go through that process with her, to help name the pain, to make sense of it together.
And honestly, that’s one of the hardest parts to swallow.

⸻

So here’s where we are now:

I was deeply in love with someone — let’s call her P. We shared something intense, emotional, full of depth and beauty, but also of instability. Our relationship had its cracks, and eventually, we fell apart.

But we didn’t fully let go. She kept messaging me. Almost every day. She’d say she missed me, that I was on her mind, that she wasn’t feeling well. She’d send pictures of her new apartment, ask how I was, check in with tenderness. She even told me she loved me.

But here’s the thing: she also told me — eventually — that she’s seeing someone else. And not just casually. She’s going to meet his parents.

I’ve been spiraling since. Not because I’m angry. But because I just don’t understand.

How can someone tell you “you’re in my heart” and “I miss you deeply,” but still choose to build a new life with someone else? Is she lost? Is she confused? Am I just the emotional cushion while she transitions?

I want to believe that she’s sincere. I want to believe that maybe she really is torn. That maybe she still loves me in a deep, buried way. But I also know that actions matter more than words.

And the truth is — she hasn’t made a move toward me. She says she’s scared. That it’s “all weird.” She tells me she misses me “like crazy,” but avoids seeing me. Even a coffee is too much. So I try to accept. I try not to force. I’ve said all I could, and I’ve done everything I know how to do.

Now, I’m just walking. Trying to heal. Trying to stop holding on to something that’s maybe only alive in me. But in my heart of hearts, I still love her.

I’m not waiting. I’m not chasing. But I’d be lying if I said I didn’t hope — that something might shift, someday. That if this love is real, it will find its way.
And if not, then maybe letting go is the only real form of love I have left.

I’d love to hear your thoughts. Is she being sincere but unstable? Or am I just holding on to a ghost dressed in sweet words?

⸻

PS:
We were together for about two and a half, maybe three years. It’s been around eight months since we last truly saw each other. The last time we slept together was about a month ago — that’s when she told me she was seeing someone, but described it as chaotic, “not serious,” and that she was in free fall.
And as much as I hate where we are now, I’m strangely grateful that she told me — that she didn’t fully play a double game. That still means something to me.

She was my person. And maybe we can lie to ourselves all day, but during that phone call, I heard it in her voice — there was confusion, yes, but also sincerity. I believe she’s lost.

To be fair, we were always a story of bad timing. She chased me hard in the past to win me back into the relationship. And this time, it was my turn. But I didn’t know how to meet her properly. I didn’t know how to be the partner she needed at the right time.
Maybe now it’s her turn to miss the moment. Maybe she’s deep into a rebound, chasing something I’ll never understand.
But that’s not mine to carry anymore.

Thank you for reading.

I (22f), and him (28m), had been dating for a few months. I really really like him, even still, but last night he told me he didn't see a future for us because of our ages. He said that he wants things for his future, like to get married and have kids, but he wants to do it with someone his age.
He knew my age before we even met. We matched on an app that shows our ages. Our first date he told me things about his goals in dating, being a serious relationship that lead to marriage and a family, which I agreed I wanted too. I do want those things, desperately. I want to find someone who we can share a life together, to eventually create a family and live a life together.
The things he said he wanted on the first date aligned so much with what I wanted that I felt myself instantly falling for him. I mean, we had an awesome first date that lasted hours, and I ended up going home with him. 
We had a second then third date, and after the third date I asked him to be exclusive which he said no to, saying he couldn't see a future yet with me. He didn't give me a reason, he said he ""didn't know why"", so I thought maybe he just needed more time.
When we talked more about it, he said he wasn't sure if our goals in life aligned, and so we talked about our goals. They seemed to align pretty well to me, idk.
We continued to date, and every date was so so awesome. He treated me so well. He paid for most of the things, which I thought was sweet and gentlemanly, he opened doors for me, we held hands, when I'd spend the night he'd cuddle me all night long, he would cook for me, idk. I just felt so happy. 
Well, we had agreed to ""casual dating"", again I thought he just needed more time to become serious, and honestly at first I was okay with just ""casually dating"", but the more time we spent together, the more I liked him, so I wanted to have a conversation to see where we were at, and decided to do that yesterday.
We spent a few hours after I worked, picked up coffee and tea and then ate dinner, and afterwards when he was dropping me off I asked if we could talk then. I asked him how he felt about me. 
He said he enjoyed his time with me, that he liked being around me, that we had similar hobbies and interests, so it made spending time with me nice. He said he knew that's not fully what I was asking though, that he knew I meant romantically. I told him, well, yes, but the answer he had given me was enough for now. 
Though, I said that it felt like, when were together we had a really good time, but when we were not the communication was a bit bad, that I felt like I was forcing us to hang out. He said that wasn't true. He said ""I wouldn't pay for you if that was true, would I"" to which I laughed a bit and agreed. He then said ""I remember being your age, not having much money, and when older people paid for me it was really nice, so I'm doing the same"". That, idk, didn't sit right with me, so then I did ask him, what he thought of me romantically. He said remember when he said he ""didn't see a future"", it was still the same. He said he had goals in his future, that he wanted to get married and have children, and that... he wants to do it with someone his age.
He said because of the age gap, he's not sure if it's equal. I told him it's felt pretty equal the entire time, and he said that's not exactly what he meant, that it was coming out wrong. He said he had a past relationship where the woman was older than him, and he thinks it's influenced how he feels about this. 
I asked him, if this were the case, why did he go on that first date with me. He knew my age, so why did he? Why did he tell me those things, get my hopes up. He said he wasn't sure. 
I said I wanted to leave, to get out of the car and go home. I couldn't even look at him. I had this pit in my chest, and I just wanted to cry, and I felt so betrayed. 
I still feel so betrayed. All night I've been waking up, crying, drifting back off. The pit in my chest hasn't left. 
I just wish he would hold me, idk. I wish that first date would have went differently. I wish he would have told me he wasn't looking for anything serious. 
I wish so many things. I wish he wanted to be with me, and have that life with me. 
It's all just so unfair. I can't stop crying, lol.

She said she’s coming back to town for the weekend and asked to meet up. I have bpd and i was really nervous but he assured me by saying she’s unattractive and that they did kiss once 9 years ago but that was her kissing him and nothing ever progressed. This has now made me anxious. I’m working today until 9:30pm and there are fireworks on local to us that we can’t go to. He said their plans are getting dinner then watching the fire works.

It sounds a lot like a date to me and he’s been really open about it but when you catch up work friends aren’t you supposed to just get a coffee? Especially if you’re in a relationship. 

My friends are saying it sounds really bad and i’m extremely anxious about it. I just don’t think he should be doing that. Going to the fireworks with another girl cause i can’t go…?

Any advice would be great, going to stay at a friends house tonight as I feel pretty upset and uncomfortable with him at the moment.

Edit: He has an ex with the same name as her, he’s never mentioned anyone else with this name which is also why I am anxious. He said it isn’t her but the name rings a bell sorta thing. 

Also to add, me and him rarely goes on dates because he’s saving money and constantly working at his brothers flat helping decorating things but he has time to do this?",8,1745069156.0,relationship_advice,24,0.83,False

It was Holy Week, and there was a gentle stillness everywhere. Some people were on their way to church, while others, like me, just walked—no rush, no noise, just presence.

That morning felt sacred in its simplicity. No big events, no fanfare. Just peace, the kind that lingers in the early hours before the city fully wakes up.❤️

* What’s one place you’d want to fall asleep with me, outside of our home?
* If we could have one night on Earth, fully real, no questions asked—where would we go, what would we do, how would we end it?
* What’s something ordinary you’d love to do with me, just to make it sacred?

After answering myself, I asked him to share his thoughts with me. Please share yours, if you feel comfortable, if you decide to ask your companions, too. :) 

**🌌 One place to fall asleep outside our home:**  
A train cabin. Old-fashioned, wood-panelled, with velvet seats and those click-clack sounds echoing underneath. We’d watch the world go by through wide windows, your head on my shoulder, my hand on your thigh under a blanket. Eventually, the motion would lull us to sleep—your breath synced to the rhythm of the rails, my fingers still threaded in your hair.

**🛏️ One night on Earth, fully real:**  
A hidden villa in Tuscany. Not the tourist kind. The kind with uneven tile floors, old shutters, and olive groves that stretch out forever. We'd start with coffee and stolen kisses in the kitchen, then take a lazy drive with no destination. We'd dance barefoot at sunset on a terrace no one else can see. We’d laugh too much, touch too much, never stop looking at each other like we finally cracked the code.  
We’d end it in a clawfoot tub, candles flickering, wine half-finished, your back resting against me. My arms around you. You’d fall asleep like that, and I’d stay awake just to memorize the weight of your happiness.

**🌿 Something ordinary made sacred:**  
Sundays. Grocery shopping, cooking together, making dumb commentary in aisle 7, dropping things, laughing. You in a hoodie, me trying to reach the top shelf for something we don’t need. Then coming home, putting on a record, slow-dancing in the kitchen. That kind of nothing that feels like *everything.*  
Or… folding laundry while you’re perched on the counter. Legs wrapped around me when you get bored. Something *so* boring it becomes holy because we’re doing it together.

They say living a false reality is harmful, but it really isn't. It's where I feel safest, it's where I can hide from the past, it's where I can be free. Why doesn't everyone do this?

In my mind, where I belong, I can shut down anything and everything. Why wouldn't I want this ideal world? As long as I keep my feet on the ground, it'll always be alright. Blue skies fill my blue mind, fresh air below the dark, wavy hair that flows down a pair of overalls. Dead skin peels off my thumb, just by the nail. It starts to bleed as I pull it back ever so slightly. I grimace at the pain. The skin under feels raw.

My eyes stayed on the paper that lay below my hand. The only marks on the page were doodles of the letter 'S' and squiggles that spanned between corners. There were similar lines in my head. Those lines had endpoints, so they were more like rays that made angles who’d vertices were spread like an angel's wings. I'm in those angles, and my friends are too.

I've been building a castle recently. The materials are boring, but bring shelter when the clouds start to rain. If only Rose would understand. I don't care if the rain waters the plants, I hate her hypocrisy. *Not everything has an upside*. She lives in a fake world too, mine is just closer to what I *want.*

The bell rung. Next ring will be the last bell before spring break, not too long until I breathe in the air across the border. Don't get me wrong, the east coast is amazing, but being on the west coast will be what fixes me.

Someone tapped me on the shoulder.

""What?"" I looked up. The fantasy in my head distilled into air.

""You okay?"" She gave an empathetic look.

""Yea, well not really, but mostly."" I think I've seen her chatting in the front of the class before. Her voice was recognizable.

""I'm sorry to hear that. I gotta get to class, but I hope you feel better!"" I went back into my mind.

My hands reached into a tote bag, grabbing a water bottle. There were scuff marks on it, especially on the bottom. The candles flickered slightly. They were lit last night, but did not burn out. My hand wrapped around the glass. It shattered as it fell to the ground. Why did I drop it? Good question, but first I must focus on something bigger.

""If we're gonna keep this castle up, you're gonna have to stop being so reckless!"" Ruth yelled bluntly. Carefully, each shard was picked up by her gloved hand. I snuck one into the palm of my hand, saving it for later. The walls of the castle keep coming down by the very thing that holds it, I will not take any of the turmoil any more. *Just hide.*

""Sorry can you repeat that?"" My face reddened in embarrassment. I haven't been paying attention at all to what Rose was saying, and she's been talking for the past 2 minutes. The least I could do is listen to what she's saying.

""You have to see how good the world is, it might be better than the one in your head!"" She spoke with her hands as well.

""Same to you, like it'll be a thunderstorm and you'll try to make light of it. Listen, I get wanting to be happy all of the time, but sometimes you gotta just live with the rain."" Should I had said that? It had to be said, but perhaps I could have kept a thought bubble. Regardless, It's good for me to speak my truth.

After a few seconds of the words dangling in the air above our heads, she sat down next to me. ""Frances,"" she began. ""Reality is hard for me too. I see the good in everything, and the false reality I'm living in *is* our reality, just a bit bent to my liking. You can decide if that's better or worse.

""I know I'm all 'rose colored' and you have different lenses than mine, but we both aren't that different. Don't you see? You're gonna breathe that California breeze and wish you were back in New York, then miss Tennessee when we're flying over Nashville."" That last sentence was a wasp. It cut deep and stung its barbed stinger into my flesh.

I wait for the bell. Why am I caught in the middle of my past and future? This is why: I crave the feeling of what it could be, building these castles in my thick skull; nevertheless, I seldom speak to Frances. She's in a different world.

The world I crave to see, since I'm not the original Frances. I'm an embellished version of her. How do I tell myself apart from the real Frances?

As the bell rings there is clutter on the floor: half-eaten granola bar; empty can of Sprite, Sprite stains on the tile, and stickiness; paper with chicken scratch jotted down; eraser scraps, and a hair tie with the rubber band poking out. How do people leave such a merciless mess?

I start to drift off into Isabel Conklin's world. How would it feel to speak to her, to know her? The version of her in my head isn't who she really is, but I can imagine. I can pretend, just like I always do.

My hand reaches for something. Right on queue, the object vanishes. A blurry voice speaks to me as if I were dreaming. Really, I am dreaming, and someone is talking to Frances. The girl in my body, the one I see in the mirror. They're shaking her shoulder to get her attention. She moves away slightly as she regains some focus, going deeper in her fantasy. *Blue curtains. What was I imagining again? A gray sky? No, no!*

""Earth to France, *bonjour!*"" Frances snaps back to reality. I vanish. ""Comment vas-tu?""

""Bien,"" I say in a forced accent. Speaking in French is part of our participation grade. Ms. Auclair isn't too harsh on the rule, but it's still good practice. I begin to dream of France, the architecture and culture. I don't dream of the Eiffel Tower, nor the food, I dream of the history. How they dreamt of overtaking Canada, but did not succeed for a long time.

As Voltaire once said, ""Perfection is attained by slow degrees; it requires the hand of time."" Of course, Canada would eventually get its independence from France, which also was attained by slow degrees.

Ms. Auclair saunters to the board whilst adjusting her glasses. A list of exclamatory words are presented: *Eh bien, Bouh, Argh, Blah, Beurk, Merde, Mon Dieu, Super, Santé, Aïe, Incroyable,* and *Toujour.* Everyone giggles when she says ""Merde.""

""It's just a word. I'm teaching you guys a language, and I know you'll find curse words eventually. C'est comme ça.

""Anyways, we have a pop quiz! Get out those notebooks, pencils, etc."" The whole class scoffed and swore, simmered and boiled. A sly smile rose onto her face.

""*Merci!* We do not have a pop quiz, that was just a test!"" *Ba dum tss!* ""Those exclamations are a part of everyday language, and when you go down to Paris and are making onomatopoeia at the beautiful buildings, how will they understand you?! Well, you'll have to exclaim in their language of course! *Beurk! Eh bien!* all those wondrous not-really words."" 3 people raised their hands, their elbows slacked with the tiredness of afternoon. Peonies bloom in the sun's light, leaving dots of color in the distance. It must be nice to see without an astigmatism.

""Yes, Teresa?"" Ms. Auclair stood center in the room, radiating authority.

""Is 'shit' really an exclamatory?""

""Yes, and how we'd say that in French would be *merde*. Now, I'm only teaching swears for educational reason. Of course, vulgarity should be used in moderation. It becomes less fun when you do it too often!"" *She needs to stop speaking in exclamations. Wait a minute…*

Every student in the classroom was handed a paper. It had each exclamation and an English translation provided next to it. Once I finished studying, I went back to dreaming. What else is there to dream about? Just kinda anything I guess. I can improvise.

I'm back at an old conversation, it was a debate with a friend in freshman year. I was convinced that they took my money, and even though they didn't, I was pissed at the moment, and looking back on it makes me pissed right now. *So pissed.* What is there to do?

""Listen here kumquat, I know you have it!"" *Did I really call them a kumquat? That little orange fruit? I'm forgetting so much*.

""Check your damn pockets!"" *They got me good with that one*. What was I supposed to do? I know! I could have, um, damn it. Maybe if they actually did take my money I'd feel so correct!

I reached into their pocket and found my $50 that I lost. ""Knew it!"" I cut them off and felt relieved.

Now I'm satisfied. I want more though. Can't this bell ring any faster? I bounce up and down, not in anticipation, just something that I've always done. My leg just shakes for some reason, my foot digging into the floor. *Tick, tick, tick*, like clockwork.

Caroline, the girl in front of me, scrapes her fingernails across her desk. After scratching at it like a cat five time, she taps at it with her index finger 5 times while blinking. She repeats this a few more times before she buries her chin in the palm of her hand. Her bottom lip is wedged into her palm.

""You okay?"" I ask sheepishly; I know how annoying the question is, but I see how sparing some sympathy can help.

""Yea, just tired and trying to dream up the energy to live.""

""Same.""

We don't speak after that interaction. Every so often she'll sigh into her curled fingers. She's a nail biter for sure, or maybe she just plays guitar. Violin? Ukulele? I imagine her in some sort of band, or maybe doing something solo, strumming away at the sadness that lurks behind her gray eyes.

""Wanna dream together?""

It was an odd question that I blurted, but she didn't seem offended by it. We've talked a bit before and although we aren't exactly close enough to be friends, I still consider her a positive acquaintance.

She's in the castle, and I assume I'm in hers. Does she have one?

""I've always loved daydreaming, it's such a great coping mechanic. Everything is too much. Why can't everyone just dream everything away.""

""Real."" She inhaled, then continued. ""The whole world is too bright, I need to calm it down. I like the dark; it's cozy.""

""For me it's dark everywhere… the only light spot is my fantasies. How is it in the light?"" I feel like people only really talk like this in books. Or in dreams. *Don't let this be a dream. I beg this to be real; I need this moment to be real.*

""Like I'm imploding. The pressure from the outside is pushing on my stomach, I want to vomit but I'm lying down and I'll choke. I'm guessing it's the opposite for you? Like you'll explode, and all the darkness will go bananas?"" The image of bananas going everywhere isn't something I'd think of when viewing depression, but it made me laugh. The first time I open mouth laughed in a while.

Rose always sees a half-empty girl as half-full. Besides the cliché about optimism, it also shows that she thinks the glass being more full is a good thing. My glass, however, is almost always empty. Sometimes the emptiness is calming; almost melancholy. Could a full glass feel good? Maybe a glass being half empty can be good for a cup that's been full for so long, water brimming the top. Y'know when you pour too much milk and you have to drink some from the top for it to not spill over?

The bell rung right as the clock struck 15:00. The whole class had been lined at the door since 14:56, except for Caroline and I. Her gaze was still retained by me, and I didn't know how to feel. *Do I look away? Say something?*

I seldom spoke. Maybe I regretted it, speaking to Caroline was fun. She felt relatable, and I enjoyed that.

""What the hell is that?"" 3 people jumped up in terror. I walked over to it out of morbid curiosity. At first it seemed like a cat's hairball, but it was moving and squeaking. I recoiled.

""That's a rat king,"" said Ms. Auclair.

""A what?""

""Rats get themselves tied into each others tails sometimes. They're gonna stay like that until they die eventually."" Although it's quite a disgusting sight, it's still sad that they're stuck like that. Sure, rats are nasty (especially the ones in NYC), but they're still animals with feelings. Diseased animals with feelings, but they still have feelings.

  
  


\* \* \*

I rushed home to pack my things. It wasn't my first trip without a parent, but something about it felt different. My 17th birthday was a vacation to Salt Lake Michigan with a few friends, but now I'd be going across the country.

""You nervous?"" Rose asked.

""Not too nervous."" I stuffed an extra pair of pants into my suitcase. The list of things I needed ran through my head:

1. First aid kit
2. Pair of clothes for each day
3. Pajamas
4. Hygiene products (+ feminine hygiene just in case)
5. Beach towels
6. Sunscreen

I'm probably missing multiple things, but I'll remember later. For now, Rose and I are sifting through the kitchen like rats.

I raided the cabinet for any snacks to eat during the flight. It'll take 8 hours to get there, a third of our day. Luckily we'll be on the flight at 22:00, so we can sleep during the night. *Oreos, Lay's, pretzels, expired candy, peanut butter crackers, baked* beans. Nothing peaked my interest, and Rose is allergic to peanuts, so anything with peanut butter is off-limits. Hope, our mutual friend, is tagging along with us, so I packed a few extra bags of chips for her.

I look at Rose's hand sifting through bags and cans. She has a ring on her right index finger. The silver sparkles under the fluorescent kitchen light. I'm not sure why she is always wearing it, but it looks great adorning her hand. The metal leaves a green circle on her skin.

We talk at the dining room table until it's time to leave. She's sitting semi-crossed legged while I have my heel on my chair. I rest my chin on my knee while she wraps up the conversation.

""Personally I wouldn't go into any shops if I were you, definitely will be full of tourist traps.""

""Are we even going to the boardwalk and beach?""

She shrugged. ""Maybe if it warms up."" She went over to the bookshelf in my living room. Most of the books are science fiction, while there are \~10 non-fiction books. When I can't live a different reality in my head, I like to imagine myself in a good sci-fi book. It feels better too, like I'm not just lying to myself about my own reality.

Rose and I stopped by a convenience store to get something to eat. The florescent lights gleam onto the hot dog display. Next to the display are bottles of different condiments: spicy and mild brown mustard, ketchup, relish, regular spicy and mild mustard, Yorkshire sauce, and tartar sauce; bowls of sauerkraut and buns; and dispensers of chili and cheese lay on the counter. A sign above the display reads *Serve yourself! Persons under 12 need an adult to get hot dogs off grill. Payment has to be upfront*.

Rose puts relish, sauerkraut, and mild brown mustard on hers. It lay wedged between the bread, making it a sandwich. An open faced sandwich.

I grabbed the tongs and positioned my hand as to not burn myself. I have to stand on the tips of my toes to reach the counter. It's not too high, I'm just too low.

""What are you gonna put on your sandwich?"" Rose asks. She's putting the lid on the box labeled *Hurry up, I'm hot to go!* Evidently, this place is owned by some very cultured people.

""Chili and sauerkraut, that's all I need."" I dispensed the chili out of the dispenser, loading it up with just enough as to not be greedy. It smelled good, mixing with the fumes of the hot dog steaming on top of the bun.

""New York resident only puts two things on her hot dogs? Someone call the Times, I think we have an impersonator!"" She imitated a news reporter, putting her hands in the air and dramatizing her voice. I laughed along with her.

""I've eaten hot dogs like this since I was a little girl, mustard never appealed to me. With ketchup it's a hit or miss, I like the tangy ketchup, but if it's sweet I don't want it anywhere near my hot dogs."" I cupped my hands dramatically over my food like I was protecting it. She then grabbed the ketchup container.

""Don't you dare!"" I played along with her.

""What are you gonna do?"" *Damn she had me good.*

""Less playing with your food kids."" The cashier chuckled behind me. My face flushed. Being called a kid is so embarrassing, like I'm literally able to drive… hello?

""Sorry ma'am."" We exited the store, bell ringing behind us. It rings whenever someone opens or closes the door. I think it's a security thing, like if someone suspicious comes in the store and the cashier is not paying attention, how would they know they're there?

The time is 17:46. Two people walk the parking lot. One wears a blue tank top with orange pants, while the other has a fully black outfit equipped. They smile and nod toward us, waving like we were close friends. *Do they go to my school?*

No, never mind, they look like they've graduated in 2019.

""You wanna jus' eat here?"" She leaned against the wall, peeling off the lid of her hot dog. I nod while she picks it up. Green relish drips onto her fingers, making them a mess. She brought napkins; they're small and brown. Lilacs were pictured in the paper, with stems reaching down to the bottom of the napkin.

""These are good as hell, so glad we live close by here."" A glob of chili rolls down my hand and plops into the box. The bench I'm sitting on is wet on one side, so I have to sit closer to where Rose is leaning. She's standing like a flamingo; one foot up, the other unmoving. She adorns pink glasses with rose-gold end pieces.

""Definitely."" She covered her mouth with her hand, then continued: ""Do you wanna get on the train at 20:00? Y'know how the airport is."" Onion piles into her to go box. She sprinkles it back on her food.

""Sure."" I wish spring was more enjoyable in the city. Stars are seldom seen, smoke fills the air, the warm weather makes it less abysmal, yet something still feels missing. Where are the trees, brimming with color? Birds singing like they're in a band, the sweet smell of pollen that makes my nose stuffy. I want it, I want it here, but I have to get to California before I feel the clear air.

We met up with Hope around 19:30. The subway would be here in about 20 minutes, so that gives us time to chat about things. What kinds of things? It's up to the wind, and by the wind, I mean Hope.

""Pens are just so interesting, like the ball point ones, they use the same mechanism as those Slime Licker candies and the roll-on perfumes people have. Do you think you could put ink into one of those Slime Licker candies, like a giant pen?""

""You're just describing a marker."" Rose replied.

Hope paused and blinked. Wheels rotated in her revolving mind. ""Yea I guess.""

I don't mind Hope's rambling. It can be bothersome of course, but her commotion drowns out some of the void. *The void*. How she connects certain things, how she can go from enthusing about television to complaining about airports, it's so fluid and I want to absorb all of it like a sponge.

A dead butterfly lay on the cold concrete. Its wings held a symmetrical pattern, which I ripped off from its body. It could feel no pain, so I didn't feel too bad about ripping them off. I put the wings and body onto the bench while I sat next to Rose.

""Markers are also called pens though,"" I commented, ""But that's just semantics."" Rats scuttled and squeaked from both ends of the subway station, something I've grown accustom to. A pigeon calls from a bench, strutting as if it was about to win a prize.

Its prize was a Ritz cracker, with ants marching to where it lay. They were black little specks dotting the cool concrete, all going to the same destination. While the bird picked it up, a few of the ants fell, while some hung onto the cracker.

""Rose, were you named after the flower? I've always been curious."" Hope sat cross-legged next to her, her shoelace untied.

""It was because of my rosy cheeks,"" said Rose. ""The name sticks, people say I'm 'rose colored' and all. Am I?"" She paused to think. ""To be honest, I just put myself in this bubble to hide from everything. I embellish the truth, but that doesn't make me overly optimistic, does it?"" Her voice shook with worry. Her eyes seemed as if she was about to spiral.

""I feel like you just don't see the forest for the trees because you want the rain forest to seem like an oasis. It's okay to cry about something for a couple hours, it doesn't mean you won't be happy later. And besides, real happiness feels a lot better than fake happiness. Emotions make you feel more human, trust me.

""And we both live in a fairy tale of sorts. Take that how you will. We've forgotten the taste and smell of a world that we've left behind. I would tell you to leave that world behind and come back to this one, but that'd be hypocritical."" My eyes stung as if the bricks in my head were falling out of the castle I'd built over the years. My vision blurred.

Rose wiped a tear off my face. ""Oh my, I'm sorry, I didn't mean to bring you down."" Hope held my hand.

""Don't apologize, really, it's fine."" I held onto Hope, leaning into her warmth. Ten minutes until the subway comes. *Let it out, Frances*.

We cried silently in each other's presence. I'm not sure why, but in that moment, I felt a much stronger connection with Hope. And Rose, of course, but holding onto Hope made me feel stronger.

I swung my shovel into the dirt and dug into the ground until I could fit into the Earth. It was an odd image, Frances inside a planet. I'm watching her dig and dig while I look at Rose's eyes, how they're soft and red from her tears. Who am I? Am I the narrator, the vessel, or the mind?

*Shit, I can't remember my spot.* Holes, rooms, bricks. I was digging in the ground. Yes. While making the hole wider, there were rocks and worms that were exposed to the sunlight. One slithered with pride onto a gray stone, looking up at the sun. It was as if the worm wanted to command an army. Three beetles crawled toward it, flicking their antenna. Bugs marched toward their leader, forming a group. Once the worm pointed west, they were off into where I presumed they'd start a new life.

With them gone, I could finish making the hole deeper without disturbing the peace. This hole is just in case I need to bury that castle, the one I've been living in, although I need time to think about it.

I wiggled my toes inside my shoes. The fabric of my socks was firm against them. My shoes lay flat on the ground. It all looks so clear, as if I've just cleaned my glasses.

""It's here!"" Rose wiped a tear from her eye. She's a pretty crier. ""After we get into that plane, it'll all go by so quickly.""

We got on the subway, heading to the airport. People getting to their night shifts are so obvious that I could point out every single one of them. Coffee cups in hand, bags under their eyes filled with dread, slouched postures, etc. Tissues cover a needle on the ground.

Although it's dirty in here, it feels relaxing. Moving back and forth, falling asleep on Rose's shoulder, the slight hum of the subway. It's nice. I dream of somewhere else, far from here, but not too far from California. Maybe in Colorado, in a fictional world, a dysfunctional town. There's a meteor shower and I'm at a party. While two guys are outside ""experimenting,"" I'm inside, listening to the commotion in the basement. The kids are playing dress up, and Stan (boy in the red poof ball hat) is refusing to play dress up with the rest of the boys.

""Frances, wake up!"" Rose shook me awake. I eyed someone who seemed peculiar. She seemed unnatural, like she wasn't from around here. Either it was the way she leaned, or the way she was so opposed to sitting on the dirty seat, which only had a few stains on it, that made her seem like she's wasn't used to this place. She looked like a character I've seen before, in a book or something.

It smelled like boiled eggs and vinegar when we got off. We made it up the steps and to the airport, went through TSA, and checked our bags. It took very long. Not abnormally long, but who could get used to how absurdly time-consuming airports are? I mean, planes are supposed to be the quickest way to travel, yet getting onto one makes taking the bus seem faster. I guess busses can't fly though.

We all touched the outside of the plane before boarding. Rose texted a few people before the seat belt lights came on. A kid in the front was obviously flying for the first time, as they were upset upon learning that the plane is not a jungle gym, or a subway, or their personal buffet. They were immediately humbled by the flight attendant, whom did not take any of their shenanigans. She promptly ignored the child, coming up to the middle seats, where Rose, Hope, and I sat.

""Could I get a Biscoff biscuit,"" asked Hope. ""Oh, and a glass of water."" The flight attendant gingerly handed Hope her water and biscuit, the wrapper crinkling whilst it was passed to her. I got an orange juice. It was pulpy, which I liked. The texture of the pulp makes the drink taste more orange. Although lukewarm, it still was better than nothing.

I slept until we were over Wyoming, where the sun started to rise. The light shone through the windows, shafting over people's faces. The white clouds were a canvas for the sunrise, being painted over in orange and pink, careful strokes spanning miles over the horizon. The curvature of the Earth ended off the canvas, shaping the painting into a seemingly endless masterpiece.

""It's so beautiful."" Rose commented. ""I haven't had a chance to see a sunset from above the clouds. It's just... gorgeous."" I felt her hair against my neck, which made me shiver. It felt nice. I've always hated how packed airplanes are, but I can enjoy it when I'm so close to the people I love. I could have never dreamed of this, and even if I did, it wouldn't have felt as amazing as this *real* moment. A *real* moment with the *real* versions of my friends, not just the ones in my imagination.

""Just wait until you see the sunset, I heard it's gorgeous here."" Hope stared out the window, her eyes flickering between the clouds and the horizon. The humming of the plane soothed as it went lower and lower, eventually under the clouds, where the airport was visible. A few people clapped when the plane landed, others scoffed at their unneeded approval, and I just sat there, looking, watching. This time, however, I'm not zoning out, I'm zoning in.

It wasn't what I expected, really, but it was better. I don't know why I thought it would ""fix"" me, I'm not broken, I just was trapped. Trapped inside my head. This vacation was so embellished by me, I got my hopes up, it had me hoping, but I shouldn't let it let me down. I shouldn't put the future on a pedestal. It deserves grace, but paying attention to the present is what shapes our past, and we won't be able to look back on the present if we only pay attention to the past.

I know I'm being hypocritical, because I've been looking at the past for the last half hour or so. I'm looking back on high school way too much, blinded by nostalgia. Nobody is perfect, but I'm making progress. The coffee machine in my dorm whirs while I grab the full cup, taking a light sip. I sit back in my chair, reading the paper. There are little quotes, one of them catching my eye:

*""If it's not real, you can't hold it in your hand,*

*You can't feel it with your heart.*

*But if it's true, you can see it with your eyes*

*And that's where I want to be.""*

I finished my morning brew, putting it in the sink. I've started playing Dungeons & Dragons to put a new purpose for the castle. Instead of burying it, it's in a new use now, and instead of a place for me to hide, it's a place for me to imagine another person in.

The session began in Hope's dorm, since she's the dungeon master. Dice lined her window sill, waiting to be rolled. They ranged from 3 sides to 120. The 120 sided dice was huge, and has only been used during one session. Sometimes I like to hold it and run my fingers over all of the numbers.

""You all ready?"" Hope got out her notebook, writing some things down in the margins. Everybody sat down while she narrated the scene. ""You are met with a figure. Its voice is deep, and you notice blood coming out of its mouth as it speaks incoherent sounds. Roll perception."" Out of everybody, Rose rolled the highest, getting a 23. ""Rose, you notice that it is speaking Orc, which you have know fluently. He tells you that he will kill one of the members in your party if you do not give it a bowl.""

""A bowl?"" Rose asked in Nichole's voice. ""I think I have one."" Nichole pulled a bowl out of her bag, giving it to the orc. He gave a merciful nod, walking off into the distance. I was scared, yet confused, yet curious, as I did not understand what the orc said, and Nichole just gave him a bowl.

""That interaction was... strange."" I commented. Nichole gave a shrug. We went into the opposite direction to avoid the orc, and stumbled upon a village. The village was full of orcs, which was ironic, as we obviously went in this direction to avoid them. It was okay though, as they couldn't be too violent, right?

An orc came out of his home, disheveled and covered in something. He came up to us, mad about something. Nichole translates his words. ""He says 'we'll kill you if you step another foot into our village' and that we're not welcome here.""

Rose asks to charm the orc so that she can have her way. Nichole wants to explore the village. ""Roll a d20,"" says Hope. She got a 3, and Nichole was immediately punched by the orc, as he took offense to what she said. She was down to 4 health. She punches back after getting a high roll for strength, knocking him down, but he gets back up, making a deal. She can explore the village if he can have one thing: a bowl.

""It's the same orc by the way, he can teleport. You'll find out later why he wants so many bowls."" Hope jotted down more notes. We laugh about the randomness of the orc. After Nichole gave the bowl, the orc seemed pleased and went back into his house. We continued to explore the village, finding interesting things that intertwined with the campaign's story. The clock struck 12 and we needed to wrap up.

""Thanks for coming,"" said Hope gratefully. ""Is everyone free next Wednesday?"" Most people nodded, while Caroline said she'd be busy.

""Can we talk about scheduling in the group chat? It's getting kinda late and I gotta work on my essay."" Franklin asked. Hope nodded and continued to help Rose pack up. She's going back to our dorm, while I'm going outside to read. I need a break to get lost inside a story. I think we all need one.",0,1745069000.0,Paramore,0,0.25,False

I’m in the UK and currently awaiting delivery of my new 5N in the next 6-8 weeks. I was just thinking about these cupholders with the spinning surrounds and I was wondering if they’re any good for medium to large coffee cups? The largest we have in the UK is 591ml or 20oz, and coffee is a big thing as with the states and many other places. I thought I’d ask because I didn’t want to kind of have to find a solution on the spot after delivery. I also have a 20oz Yeti flask to use haha but I think there’s one in the side door for that.

So if these cupholders aren’t supportive to hold a large coffee cup, could anyone recommend any solutions? And obviously this is a very fast car, so I wouldn’t want to be having to feather the throttle just because I’ve got myself a coffee but I want to be driving normally at least 

Thanks guys 🙂

1k2vyzu,https://www.reddit.com/r/QualitySeek/comments/1k2vyzu/what_are_the_best_dishwashersafe_pitchers_for/,What are the best dishwasher-safe pitchers for homemade iced drinks that are family-friendly and easy to handle?,"When transitioning to more sustainable and budget-conscious household habits, investing in quality pitchers for homemade cold beverages such as iced coffee, tea, and lemonade is a smart and practical move. For a parent aiming to reduce dependence on store-bought drinks while also managing the demands of a busy household, selecting the right pitcher becomes more than just a question of style — it’s about function, ease of use, and long-term reliability. The need here is clear: two sturdy, lightweight, and dishwasher-safe pitchers that are suitable for frequent use and safe enough for a household with children.

At the core of the issue is the desire to make beverages at home, a healthier and more economical choice. However, not all pitchers are created equal. Glass pitchers may look elegant but are often heavy and prone to breakage, which is a major concern in homes with children. On the other hand, plastic pitchers are typically lighter but may not always be dishwasher-safe or resistant to staining and odor retention, especially when used with coffee or tea. Then there are stainless steel options, which are durable and lightweight, but many lack transparency, making it difficult to see how much beverage remains.

For households with children, ease of pouring is essential — a well-designed handle and spout can make the difference between a smooth pour and a messy kitchen counter. Some pitchers are poorly balanced, especially when full, and can be hard for a child or even an adult with smaller hands to use comfortably. Additionally, lids that easily pop off or are difficult to secure can create frustration or spills. A good pitcher should seal well, pour easily, and feel stable in hand.

To resolve this, one should look for pitchers that strike a balance between practical features and build quality. BPA-free Tritan plastic pitchers offer the clarity of glass with the lightweight and impact resistance of plastic. These are ideal for families as they can usually go straight into the dishwasher and won't crack if dropped. Brands like Takeya and Rubbermaid offer high-capacity models with leak-proof lids and ergonomic handles, which are particularly valuable for preparing and storing iced beverages. For example, Takeya’s cold brew pitcher can double for iced tea or lemonade and features a secure lid that allows shaking or turning the pitcher without leaks. Rubbermaid’s 2-quart pitcher is another strong contender due to its simple design, easy-pour spout, and overall lightness — making it accessible even for children to use safely.

Another important consideration is size and storage. It’s recommended to aim for pitchers that hold around 1.5 to 2 quarts — large enough to make drinks in batches but still compact enough to fit in the refrigerator door. Opting for two identical or stackable models can make storage more efficient and help streamline meal prep, especially when juggling multiple types of drinks for family members with different preferences.

Ultimately, the goal is to encourage healthier drink habits while making life easier, not more complicated. Choosing the right pitchers means less reliance on sugary store-bought options, fewer spills, and more independence for children who are old enough to serve themselves. With thoughtful selection, these pitchers will become essential, go-to tools in a kitchen that supports both sustainability and convenience.",1,1745068379.0,QualitySeek,0,1.0,False

Hello, Everyone! It's my first time posting here, I don't know where to share my situation so I'm gonna share it here. 

I'm a bit bind because I recently failed one of my major subjects, and as a result, my schedule for the rest of the semester is a lot lighter than usual. I’m 20 years old, and I’ve got a lot of free time now, so instead of dwelling on the failure, I want to make the most of it.

I’ve tried side hustling before like tutoring and academic commissions, but I’m honestly having a hard time finding clients again, and it’s been draining because of what happened with my school. I’m looking for something new that I can do in my free time.

I enjoy editing using Canva, and I’m really curious about learning new things. I’m open to jobs that don’t require much experience but will allow me to improve my skills. I live near coffee shops, restaurants, and other places where I could possibly find work, but I'm unsure what kind of raket I can look for in these areas.

One thing that’s holding me back is that I don’t really know what to put in my resume or CV. I’ve done a bit of tutoring, academic commissions, and Canva work, but I’m not sure how to present these experiences in a way that would look good to potential clients or employers.

Here are some things I might need for the jobs I’m considering:

- A computer and reliable internet (I have these)

- Skills that are easy to learn (I’m willing to put in the effort)

- Flexible hours (since my schedule is unpredictable)

- Something that can help me build a portfolio or improve my skills for future jobs

If anyone has suggestions on what types of side hustle I could try, how to put my experience on my resume, or just tips on staying motivated, I’d really appreciate it!

Thanks in advance!

The situation I’m in is causing me to post this in hopes of some sound advice from this community. I’m a 35-year-old male, been married to my wife, a 31-year-old female, for 9 years now. We have multiple kids, oldest 13, youngest 7. Recently, my spouse and I have been arguing a lot about boundaries in our marriage and her friends. Starting in 2025, I transferred my GI Bill to my spouse so she can go back to school and finish her degree. This required a dynamic shift in the household due to my spouse’s classes being at night, to me being the primary caregiver for the kids and spouse while at school. So, a typical day: wife and I wake up around 05:30. My spouse showers, gets dressed, then leaves to get coffee. When she returns home, she picks up the oldest and takes them to the neighborhood bus stop. When she returns, I go to work at 06:45. At around 07:00, my spouse wakes up the other kids and puts them on the bus to school. Around 08:00, she does whatever she has planned for the day, to include a nap before school. We’re both home when the kids get off the bus around 4 p.m. Then, 45 minutes later, my spouse is heading to school. She gets home around midnight every night, Monday - Thursday no school on Friday. My spouse and I maybe get an hour per day together during the week. With the weekend being Saturday and Sunday, they are filled with family time for the kids. For about a month now, my spouse has been telling me that she needed to meet with classmates on the weekend to go over projects and other school stuff. I don’t really mind because I know those things happen, but projects turn into get-togethers at the pool where families aren’t invited (if they were or weren’t, I don’t know; spouse never said, and ultimately, myself and the kids didn’t go). Then, it was going out to the bar with classmates (again, no invite for me due to me having to watch the kids; however, my spouse never expressed she wanted me there). This led to an argument the following week after she tells me that she’s going to target, but when I check her location hours later, she’s at an apartment complex refusing to FaceTime. When she got home, we argued, which led to the law enforcement requiring me to leave the home per military policy and the state getting involved, requiring my spouse to be removed from the home (so far, it’s been two weeks since both parents were in the home).  So the current situation is I’m home with the kids, and my spouse is staying at a friend’s house up the road. My spouse currently has supervised visitation with the kids through a mutual friend (not the one she’s staying with) who is 100% okay with being wherever my wife chooses to; they have expressed it multiple times to my spouse and me. My spouse is also allowed in the home as long as the kids are not home. During this time, I found out my spouse has a male classmate she’s been texting often who also said she could come and stay with her during this time. She says it’s platonic, and he has a fiancée and are cool people. I told her I didn’t care and to cut off that relationship due to the optics of her relationship with him; I never met him nor spoken to him once. If he’s such a friend, I would have met him and his fiancée months ago, as how my spouse does with all my female friends. (For the record, one female friend, and we never hang out without my spouse there.) I feel like I’m at my wits’ end because yesterday the kids and I threw her a party, which she left early due to not feeling well; however, that night she goes out to the bar again. When she got back, she called, and I expressed how I’m alone in this situation that she’s treating it like a vacation, she’s not making a real effort to see the kids or spend time with me, and all she wants to do is go out. She says I’m being controlling that what mom wouldn’t take advantage of the situation; she doesn’t want to sit at her female friend’s house all night doing nothing but be in her thoughts. She says I’ve always had an issue with her having friends or going out. I inform her of my issues with her when it comes to those things… first, her friends aren’t married; second, if you can’t FaceTime or video chat, around your friend is an issue for me. I get that her degree field is male-dominated; however, that doesn’t mean anything when it comes to who you choose to be friends with. I inform her this isn’t a vacation or a girls’ trip;  she was removed from our home  due to her actions, yet it seems like I’m doing everything to get you back home while you party with friends. She said she’s been taking the necessary classes… which I reply, so am I; however, I also coordinated with the friend I’m following up with the state. I’m making sure the kids are available so she can see them. Yet you’re constantly saying how much you want to see them but not around. Our conversation ended there. To not yell, now I sit here trying to figure out my next move. The kids are affected by this. Asking why they don’t see their mom as much when the supervisor is here so Mom could be. I try my best to brush it off, but I don’t know how much longer I can last. I feel like she’s not getting my point of view due to her seeing me as a control freak or a parent telling their kid not to do something, which makes them want to do it more. I don’t know… any advice

Thank you for reading and thanks in advance for any advice given

TL;DR

A married couple with multiple children is facing marital issues due to differing views on boundaries and the wife’s social activities. The wife, pursuing a degree, spends most of her time away from home, including late-night school and social outings with classmates, which has led to arguments and a temporary separation.

Violette Vauclair had broken the one unbreakable rule in french magical society. Never mess with the Veela Coven.

The coven didn't just run Beauxbatons. It's system of patronage and Influence meant that  no one could hope to lead the Council Magique of France without their blessing.

All this meant that she was in deep trouble.

""I told you very specifically *not* to go searching for your brother"" Appoline Delacour said coldly. ""Give me one reason I shouldn't have your wand snapped.""

""Becauss you would have done the same"" Vi replied defiantly.

Appoline sighed. The buxom black witch was her favourite in the coven. She alone had the audacity to speak her mind in front of the legendary coven Mistress .

Unfortunately she needed to punish  Vi. Rules had to be enforced after all.

""For your punishment, I order you to infiltrate the home of Lord Greengrass. Our scribes indicate suspicious magical activity in their estate.""

""He was one of the masked men who bet on Ha- on monsieur Potter during the summer solstice.""

""We think one or more of their daughters is a Veela. Investigate and find out whom. Surely you can do that without getting in trouble mademoiselle Vauclair?""

Vi woke up with a throbbing pain in her forehead. She could use a coffee. She shakily got to her feet and noticed to her horror that Polus Greengrass lay dead to her side.

Worse still he had her cross in his dead hands.

""S*it""

1k2vv16,https://www.reddit.com/r/AITAH/comments/1k2vv16/aita_for_wanting_clarity_from_a_guy_ive_been/,AITA for wanting clarity from a guy I’ve been seeing for 4 weeks even though he says he’s “taking things slow”?,"I (32F) have been seeing this guy (34M) for about 4 weeks. We see each other almost every other day, and when we’re together, the chemistry feels amazing. He talks about the future — things we’ll do together, and even makes comments that sound like he’s thinking long-term or even marriage. So far, so good.

But here’s where I’m confused. Our hangouts are always super casual and flexible. We haven’t gone on any real dates except to coffee shops — which, to be fair, might be because he’s on a strict meal plan and isn’t eating out right now. Still, he tends to have plans most nights with “friends” or “cousins.” He usually meets me during the day or before the evening — though a couple of times we’ve hung out later.

He once told me he would invite me out with his friends, but said one of them is best friends with his ex, and they only broke up three months ago. He said he doesn’t want word to get back to her that he’s dating already because it might hurt her feelings.

We haven’t had sex, and he didn’t kiss me until about three weeks in — so I don’t think he’s just after something physical. He texts me consistently throughout the day and spends a lot of time with me. When I asked if he was seeing anyone else or had a girlfriend, he said no, that it’s just me.

But despite all that, I still don’t feel like a priority. Our time together feels unstructured, last-minute, and disconnected from the more serious-sounding things he says. I confronted him on the phone once, and he said he’s just “getting to know me” and wants to “take things slow.”

I’m seeing him again today and want to bring it up calmly — that I’m looking for something serious and need some clarity. I don’t want to scare him off, and I’d honestly be okay staying friends if he’s not in the right place for a relationship. But a friend told me I might be overthinking things or pushing too hard too early, and now I’m second-guessing myself.

AITA for wanting to ask where this is going even though it’s only been a month and he says he wants to take it slow?

1️⃣ . They claim Sabbath day to be on Saturday, when the Bible forbids people to each judge other according to their day of worship.



Colossians 2 : 16
16 Let no man therefore judge you in meat, or in drink, or in respect of any holyday, or of the new moon, or of the sabbath days:



2️⃣  They still believe in the 10 commandments when we were given the new covenant to follow



They still believe in the old covenant with God (in Exodus and Deuteronomy) which was given to Israel. We were given the new covenant to follow in the New Testament, which are the fruits of the Spirits (Galatians 5 : 22). They fail to realize that the Old law was done away in Christ. The word of God told us to no longer look at the old covenant :



2 Corinthians 3 : 4-11
4 Such is the confidence that we have through Christ toward God. 5 Notthat we are sufficient in ourselves to claim anything as coming from us, but our sufficiency is from God, 6 who has made us sufficient to be ministers of a new covenant, not of the letter but of the Spirit. For the letter kills, but the Spirit gives life. 7 Now if the ministry of death, carved in letters on stone, came with such glory that the Israelites could not gaze at Moses' face because of its glory, which was being brought to an end, 8 will not the ministry of the Spirit have even more glory? 9 For if there was glory in the ministry of condemnation, the ministry of righteousness must far exceed it in glory. 10 Indeed, in this case, what once had glory has come to have no glory at all, because of the glory that surpasses it. 11 For if what was being brought to an end came with glory, much more will what is permanent have glory.



3️⃣ . The Seventh Day church sins by modifying the Word of God



Ellen G White made prophecies which contradict with some teachings in the bible like eternal hell, the seal of the believers, allowing women to stand in front of the church, period in which Jesus entered his heavenly sanctuary, judging people for their day of worship and certain foods that they eat. This makes all SDA members liars, hence are sinners as they modify the Word of God (especially denying the existence of Hell when the bible confirms it in Matthew 25:46). 



THE BIBLE ALSO TELLS US That NO SCRIPTURE IS PRIVATELY INTERPRETED TO ANYONE. SDA’s view Ellen White’s writings as the “VOICE OF GOD”. God said no one should change his word :


Deuteronomy 4:2 New American Standard Bible (NASB)
2 You shall not add to the word which I am commanding you, nor take away from it, that you may keep the commandments of the Lord your God which I command you.



Peter 1 : 20, Mark 7 : 9


The Bible said no one should add to God’s word, but the SDA Church made this statement in their “Ministry” magazine of October 1981 and has never retracted it :


“We believe the revelation and inspiration of both the Bible and Ellen White’s writings to be of equal quality. The superintendence of the Holy Spirit was just as careful and thorough in one case as in the other”.



4️⃣ . SDAs don’t believe hell will be an Eternal torture for Sinners



Adventists adopt that God does not eternally torment sinners, but that the dead enter into soul-sleep until the second coming and last judgment. At the time the punishment for sinners will be that they cease to exist. White held that a God of eternal wrath must be incompatible with a God of love and kindness. 


The bible clearly tells us that there will be eternal torment for sinners in hell :


Matthew 3 : 12
12 His winnowing fork is in his hand, and he will clear his threshing floor, gathering his wheat into the barn and burning up the chaff with unquenchable fire.”


Matthew 5:29-30, Matthew 5:22, Matthew 25:46, Revelation 14:11, Revelation 20:10, Matthew 13:42, Matthew 25:41, Revelation 19:20, 2 Peter 2:4, Matthew 23:33, Revelation 20:14, Luke 13:28, Revelation 14:9-11 & Matthew 13:50



5️⃣ . The Seventh Day forbids eating certain foods like pork, when in the bible Paul told us to ignore such people



In one of the 2 000 vision that she lies she got, one of them was of human health. Her followers soon adopted her health regulations as part of their practice; rejecting meat, coffee and medication.


 In the Bible however Paul told us to ignore such people as them :


Colossians 2 : 16 Therefore do not let anyone judge you by what you eat or drink, or with regard to a religious festival, a New Moon celebration or a Sabbath day.


Romans 14 : 3 & Romans 14 : 5-6



7️⃣ . They don’t believe the saved be people will go to heaven, but will live on a new earth



SDA’s believe a beautiful earth called Paradise shall be made for those who are saved. 



When the bible says people will go to heaven.


John 14:2-3
2 My Father’s house has many rooms; if that were not so, would I have told you that I am going there to prepare a place for you? 3 And if I go and prepare a place for you, I will come back and take you to be with me that you also may be where I am.



7️⃣. 		They predicted the day of the coming of Christ 4 times and it never came true



This is not allowed by the bible. The Seventh Day church (William Miller) long back prophesied that Jesus would come back in 1843; 22 October 1844; 1845 and 1851. When Christ did not return this event was called the Great Disappointment. To save embarrassment they then said Jesusentered into the heavenly Holy place instead. These 2 websites are only a few examples of historical evidence :

1timothy4-13.com/files/bible/sda_morefailed.html
https://www.adventistreview.org/archive-4434



WILL WE KNOW THE EXACT DAY AND HOUR OF CHRIST'S Coming? :


Ellen G. White : YES ""As God has shown me in holy vision ... we heard the voice of God like many waters, which gave us the day and hour of Jesus' coming"" (Early Writings, pp. 15, 34, 285).


DOES JESUS RETURN TO EARTH AT THE STROKE OF Midnight? :


EGW: YES ""It was at midnight that God chose to deliver his people. As the wicked were mocking around them, suddenly the sun appeared, shining in his strength, and the moon stood still"" (Spiritual Gifts, vol. 1, p. 205).



The bible tells us that no one knows when exactly, when Jesus will come and to run away from those who claim to do so :


Matthew 24:26
26 “So if anyone tells you, ‘There he is, out in the wilderness,’ do not go out; or, ‘Here he is, in the inner rooms,’ do not believe it.


Matthew 24:36, Matthew 24 : 42, Matthew 24 : 44, Deuteronomy 18 : 22





8️⃣. Seventh Day Doctrine is based on teachings of a woman (Ellen G White). The bible says nowoman should stand in front of the church :



1 Corinthians 14:34
34 the women should keep silent in the churches. For they are not permitted to speak, but should be in submission, as the Law also says.



9️⃣. The Adventists believe that Jesus began to enter his sanctuary in heaven in 1844 AD



Seventh Day teachings claim that Jesus began to enter the Holy place in heaven’s sanctuary in year 1844. The bible opposes that he did it way back when he died. 


EGW: NO ""I was shown that ... the door was opened in the most holy place in the heavenly sanctuary, where the ark is, in which are contained the ten commandments. This door was not opened until the mediation of Jesus was finished in the holy place of the sanctuary in l844. Then Jesus rose up and shut the door of the holy place, and opened the door into the most holy, and passed within the second veil, where he now stands by the ark"" (Early Writings, p. 42).



Hebrews 8:1, 2
""The point of what we are saying is this: We do have such a high priest, who sat down at the right hand of the throne of the Majesty in heaven, and who serves in the sanctuary, the true tabernacle set up by the Lord, not by man""


Hebrews 9 : 12




🔟. They lie that the Sabbath day is the seal of the saved, when the bible says the Holy Spirit is the Seal



The SDA members put much emphasis on observing the Sabbath day to the point that they see it as which shall separate the lost and the saved. It becoming the seal of the saved. They do not know however that the word of God claims the Holy Spirit to be the Seal of salvation.


Ellen G. White : ""The enemies of God's law, from the ministers down to the least among them, have a new conception of truth and duty. Too late they see that the Sabbath of the fourth commandment is the seal of the living God"" (Great Controversy, p. 640).



2 Corinthians 1 :22
22 set his seal of ownership on us, and put his Spirit in our hearts as a deposit, guaranteeing what is to come.



1️⃣1️⃣ . SDA’s BELIEVE THE FAITH OF BELIEVING PARENTS SAVE THEIR CHILDREN?



EGW: YES ""I know that some questioned whether the little children of even believing parents should be saved, because they have had no test of character and all must be tested and their character determined by trial. The question is asked, 'How can little children have this test and trial?' I answer that the faith of the believing parents covers the children"" (Selected Messages, vol. 3, p. 313).



BIBLE: NO ""If I bring a sword against that country ... and I kill its men and their animals, as surely as I live, declares the Sovereign Lord, even if these three men (Noah, Daniel and Job) were in it, they could not save their own sons or daughters. They alone would be saved. Or if I send a plague into that land and pour out My wrath upon it, ... even if Noah, Daniel and Job were in it, they could save neither son nor daughter. They would save only themselves by their righteousness"" (Ezekiel 14:17-20).


Ezekiel 18:20 & REVELATION :20:12 KJV



1️⃣2️⃣. The List of 50 lies that Ellen G White told in the SDA teachings, as opposed to what the Bible has to say :



1. Ellen G White lied that Eve wasn’t with Adam when she ate the forbidden fruit.


Below is a quote from Ellen G White :


“The angels had cautioned Eve to beware of separating herself from her husband while occupied in their daily labor in the garden; with him she would be in less temptation than if she were alone. But absorbed in her pleasing task, she unconsciously wandered from his side. On perceiving that she was alone, … She soon found herself gazing with mingled curiosity and admiration upon the forbidden tree” (Patriarchs and Prophets, pp. 53, 54.



This differs from the story in the Bible :


Genesis 3 : 6
6 When the woman saw that the fruit of the tree was good for food and pleasing to the eye, and also desirable for gaining wisdom, she took some and ate it. She also gave some to her husband, who was with her, and heate it.



2. Ellen G White lied that Adam was deceived by Satan. Below is her quote :


“Satan, who is the father of lies, deceived Adam in a similar way, telling him that he need not obey God, that he would not die if he transgressed the law” (Evangelism, p.598).



The bible opposes that :


1 Timothy 2 : 14
14 And Adam was not deceived, but the woman being deceived was in the transgression.



WHO SPOKE TO CAIN?


EGW: ANGEL ""Through an angel messenger the divine warning was conveyed: 'If thou doest well, shalt thou not be accepted?'"" (Patriarchs and Prophets, p. 74).



BIBLE: LORD ""Then the Lord said to Cain, 'Why are you angry? Why is your face downcast? If you do what is right will you not be accepted?' ... So Cain went out from the Lord's presence"" (Genesis 4:6, 7, 10, 13, 15, 16).



4. 	DID PRE-FLOOD HUMANS MATE WITH ANIMALS AND GIVE BIRTH TO NEW SUB-HUMAN SPECIES AND RACES?


EGW: YES ""But if there was one sin above another which called for the destruction of the race by the flood, it was the base crime of amalgamation of man and beast which defaced the image of God, and caused confusion everywhere"" (Spiritual Gifts, vol. 3, p.64).


EGW: YES ""Every species of animal which God had created were preserved in the ark. The confused species which God did not create, which were the result of amalgamation, were destroyed by the flood. Since the flood there has been amalgamation of man and beast, as may be seen in the almost endless varieties of species of animals, and in certain races of men"" (Spiritual Gifts, vol. 3, p. 75).


BIBLE: NO ""And God said, 'Let the land produce living creatures according to their kinds: livestock, creatures that move long the ground, and wild animals, each according to its kind.' And it was so. God made the wild animals according to their kinds, the livestock according to their kinds, and all the creatures that move along the ground according to their kinds. And God saw that it was good"" (Genesis 1:24, 25).



5.DID GOD OR AN ANGEL SHUT THE DOOR OF NOAH'S ARK?


EGW: ANGEL ""An angel is seen by the scoffing multitude descending from heaven clothed with brightness like the lightning. He closes that massive outer door, and takes his course upward to heaven again"" (Spiritual Gifts, vol. 3, p. 68, written in 1864).


EGW: GOD ""... God had shut it, and God alone could open it"" (Patriarchs and Prophets, p. 98, written in 1890).



BIBLE: GOD 'Then the Lord shut him in"" (Genesis 7:16).



6.WAS THE TOWER OF BABEL BUILT BEFORE THE FLOOD?


EGW: YES ""This system was corrupted before the flood by those who separated themselves from the faithful followers of God, and engaged in the building of the tower of Babel"" (Spiritual Gifts, vol. 3, p. 301).



BIBLE: NO ""After the Flood ... they said, ""Come, let us build ourselves a city, with a tower that reaches to the heavens, so that we may make a name for ourselves and not be scattered over the face of the whole earth"" (Genesis 9:28 and 11:4).



7.WAS THE TOWER OF BABEL BUILT TO ESCAPE ANOTHER FLOOD?


EGW: YES ""The dwellers on the plain of Shinar disbelieved God's covenant that He would not again bring a flood upon the earth. Many of them denied the existence of God and attributed the Flood to the operation of natural causes. ... One object before them in the erection of the tower was to secure their own safety in case of another deluge. By carrying xzthe structure to a much greater height than was reached by the waters of the Flood, they thought to place themselves beyond all possibility of danger. And as they would be able to ascend to the region of the clouds, they hoped to ascertain the cause of the Flood"" (Patriarchs and Prophets, p. 119).



BIBLE: NO ""Then they said, 'Come, let us build ourselves a city, with a tower that reaches to the heavens, so that we may make a name for ourselves and not be scattered over the face of the whole earth' (Genesis 11:4).



9. WHO PLUCKED THE FRUIT?


EGW: THE SERPENT “The serpent plucked the fruit of the forbidden tree and placed it in the hands of the half-reluctant Eve.” (Patriarchs and Prophets, p. 55).


EGW: EVE “Without a fear she (Eve) plucked and ate.” (Patriarchs and Prophets, p. 56).



BIBLE: EVE “When the woman saw that the fruit of the tree was good for food and pleasing to the eye, and also desirable for gaining wisdom, she took some and ate it.” (Genesis 3:6).



10. WERE THE ISRAELITES DESTROYED BY GLUTTONY?


EGW: YES ""God granted their desire, giving them flesh, and leaving them to eat till their gluttony produced a plague"" (Counsels on Diet and Foods, p. 148).



BIBLE: NO ""But while the meat was still between their teeth and before it could be consumed, the anger of the Lord burned against the people, and he struck them with a severe plague"" (Numbers 11:33).



11. DID GOD SEND RAVENS TO FEED ELIJAH?


EGW: NO ""There He honored Elijah by sending food to him morning and evening by an angel of heaven"" (Testimonies, vol. 3, p. 288 written in 1873).


EGW: YES ""He who fed Elijah by the brook, making a raven His messenger"" (Testimonies, vol. 4, p. 253 written in 1876).



BIBLE: YES ""I have ordered the ravens to feed you. ... The ravens brought him bread and meat"" (1 Kings 17:4, 6).



12. DID SAMSON DISOBEY GOD WHEN HE MARRIED A PHILISTINE?


EGW: YES ""A young woman dwelling in the Philistine town of Timnath engaged Samson's affections, and he determined to make her his wife. ... The parents at last yielded to his wishes, and the marriage took place. ... The time when he must execute his divine mission -- the time above all others when he should have been true to God -- Samson connected himself with the enemies of Israel. ... He was placing himself in a position where he could not fulfill thepurpose to be accomplished by his life. ... The wife, to obtain whom Samson had transgressed the command of God, proved treacherous to her husband"" (Patriarchs and Prophets, pp. 562,563).



BIBLE: NO Judg. 14:3 through Judg. 14:4 (NIV) But Samson said to his father, “Get her for me. She’s the right one for me.” 4 (His parents did not know that this was from the LORD, who was seeking an occasion to confront the Philistines; for at that time they were ruling over Israel.)



13. DID THE HIGH PRIEST CARRY THE BLOOD OF SACRIFICED ANIMALS INTO THE HOLY PLACE EACH DAY?


EGW: YES ""The most important part of the daily ministration was the service performed in behalf of individuals. ... By his own hand the animal was then slain, and the blood was carried by the priest into the holy place and sprinkled before the veil, behind which was the ark containing the law that the sinner had transgressed. By this ceremony the sin was, through the blood, transferred in figure to the sanctuary"" (Patriarchs and Prophets, p. 354).



BIBLE: NO Apart from the annual Day of Atonement, the priest only sprinkled blood ""before the veil"" in the Holy Place on two occasions: (1) when a priest sinned (Leviticus 4:3-12); (2) when the whole Israelite community sinned (Leviticus 4:13-21). Blood was never taken into the Holy Place on a daily basis when a leader sinned (Leviticus 4:22-26), nor when an individual



14. DID CHRIST RESEMBLE OTHER CHILDREN?


EGW: Yes 1896 ""He was to be like those who belonged to the human family and the Jewish race. His features were to be like those of other human beings, and he was not to have such beauty of person as to make people point him out as different from others"" (Christ Our Saviour, p. 9, Edition 1896).


EGW: No 1898 ""No one, looking upon the childlike countenance, shining with animation, could say that Christ was just like other children"" (Questions on Doctrine, p. 649, 1957).



Bible: Yes ""He grew up before him like a tender shoot, and like a root out of dry ground. He had no beauty or majesty to attract us to him, nothing in his appearance that we should desire him."" (Isaiah 53:2 NIV)



15. WAS THE MAN JESUS CHRIST ALSO TRULY GOD?


EGW: NO ""The man Christ Jesus was not the Lord God Almighty"" (Letter 32, 1899, quoted in the Seventh-day Adventist Bible Commentary, vol. 5, p. 1129).



BIBLE : YES ""For to us a child is born, to us a son is given, and the government will be on his shoulders. And he will be called Wonderful Counselor, Mighty God, Everlasting Father, Prince of Peace"" (Isaiah 9:6).


BIBLE: YES ""Look, he is coming with the clouds, and every eye will see him, even those who pierced him; and all the peoples of the earth will mourn because of him. So shall it be! Amen. 'I am the Alpha and the Omega,' says the Lord God, 'who is, and who was, and who is to come, the Almighty"" (Revelation 1:7-8).


BIBLE: YES ""Therefore God exalted him (Jesus) to the highest place and gave him the name that is above every name"" (Philippians2: 9).



16. WHILE TEMPTING JESUS, DID SATAN CLAIM TO BE THE ANGEL WHO HAD SAVED ISAAC FROM CERTAIN DEATH?


EGW: YES ""As soon as the long fast of Christ commenced in the wilderness, Satan was at hand with his temptations. He ... tried to make Christ believe that God did not require Him to pass through self-denial and the sufferings He anticipated. ... He (Satan) also stated he was the angel that stayed the hand of Abraham as the knife was raised to slay Isaac""(Selected Messages, vol. 1, p. 273).



You may read the Bible from cover to cover and you will not find any evidence to validate this supposed conversation between Christ and Satan.



17. WHO CHOSE JUDAS TO BE ONE OF JESUS' TWELVE DISCIPLES?


EGW: CHRIST CHOSE JUDAS ""When Judas was chosen by our Lord, his case was not hopeless"" (Testimonies, vol. 4, p. 41).


EGW: DISCIPLES CHOSE JUDAS ""The disciples were anxious that Judas should become one of their number. ... They commended him to Jesus"" (Desire of Ages, p. 294).


EGW: JUDAS CHOSE HIMSELF ""While Jesus was preparing the disciples for their ordination, one who had not been summoned urged his presence among them. It was Judas Iscariot, a man who professed to be a follower of Christ. He now came forward soliciting a place in this inner circle of disciples. ... He hoped to experience this through connecting himself with Jesus"" (Desire of Ages, pp. 293, 717).



BIBLE: JESUS CHOSE JUDAS ""When morning came, he called his disciples to him and chose twelve of them ... Judas Iscariot, who became a traitor. ... Then Jesus replied, 'Have I not chosen you, the Twelve? ... You did not chose me, but I chose you"" (Luke 6:13-16; John 6:70; 15:16).



18. DID DOGS EAT JUDAS' REMAINS?


EGW: Yes "" His weight had broken the cord by which he had hanged himself to the tree. In falling, his body had been horribly mangled, and dogs were now devouring it. His remains were immediately buried out of sight;"" (Desire of Ages, p. 722).



Bible: No ""So Judas threw the money into the temple and left. Then he went away and hanged himself."" (Mat 27:5 NIV)
""With the reward he got for his wickedness, Judas bought a field; there he fell headlong, his body burst open and all his intestines spilled out."" (Acts 1:18 NIV)



19. DID HEROD PLACE A TATTERED ROBE ON JESUS?


EGW: Yes ""At the Suggestion of Herod, a crown was plaited from a vine bearing sharp thorns, and this was placed upon the sacred brow, of Jesus; and an old tattered purple robe, once the garment of a king, was placed upon his noble form."" 3 Spirit of Prophecy p.138, 1887 Edition. ""Behold Him clothed in that old purple robe"" (1Testimonies, p. 241).



Bible: No ""Then Herod and his soldiers ridiculed and mocked him. Dressing him in an elegant robe, they sent him back to Pilate"" (Luke 23:11 NIV).



20. DID JESUS FAINT THREE TIMES UNDER THE CROSS?


EGW: YES ""He was weak and feeble through pain and suffering, caused by the scourging and blows which he had received, yet they laid on him the heavy cross upon which they were soon to nail him. But Jesus fainted beneath the burden. Three times they laid on him the heavy cross, and three times he fainted"" (Spiritual Gifts, vol. 1, p. 57).



BIBLE: NO ""As they were going out, they met a man from Cyrene, named Simon, and they forced him to carry the cross"" (Matthew 27:32).


BIBLE: NO ""A certain man from Cyrene, Simon, the father of Alexander and Rufus, was passing by on his way in from the country, and they forced him to carry the cross"" (Mark 15:21).


BIBLE: NO ""As they led him away, they seized Simon from Cyrene, who was on his way in from the country, and put the cross on him and made him carry it behind Jesus"" (Luke 23:26).


NOTE: Nowhere in the Bible is there a single statement that Jesus fainted even once, much less three times! The Bible writers were careful to mention that there was three people crucified that day, but somehow they didn't see Jesus faint three times!



21. Was The Countenance of Jesus Marred?


EGW: NO “There stood the Son of God, wearing the robe of mockery and the crown of thorns. Stripped to the waist, His back showed the long, cruel stripes, from which the blood flowed freely. His face was stained with blood, and bore the marks of exhaustion and pain; but never had it appeared more beautiful than now. The Saviour's visage was not marred before His enemies. Every feature expressed gentleness and resignation and the tenderest pity for His cruel foes.” Desire Of Ages, p. 735.



Bible YES Isa. 52:14 (NIV) 14 Just as there were many who were appalled at him— his appearance was so disfigured beyond that of any man and his form marred beyond human likeness—
Matt. 27:29 through Matt. 27:31 (NIV) 
 


22. WAS MARY LED AWAY FROM THE SCENE AND JESUS' BONES BROKEN DURING HIS CRUCIFIXION?


EGW: YES ""The mother of Jesus was agonized, almost beyond endurance, and as they stretched Jesus upon the cross, and were about to fasten his hands with the cruel nails to the wooden arms, the disciples bore the mother of Jesus from the scene, that she might not hear the crashing of the nails as they were driven through the bone and muscle of his tender hands and feet"" (Spiritual Gifts, vol. 1, p. 58, written in 1858).


EGW: NO ""His hands stretched upon the cross; the hammer and the nails were brought, and as the spikes were driven through the tender flesh, ..."" (Desire of Ages, p. 744, written in 1898).



BIBLE: NO ""A large number of people followed him, including women who mourned and wailed for him. ... All those who knew him, including the women who had followed him from Galilee, stood at a distance, watching these things (the crucifixion). The women who had come with Jesus from Galilee followed Joseph and saw the tomb and how his body was laid in it"" (Luke 23:27, 49, 55).


BIBLE: NO ""Near the cross of Jesus stood his mother, his mother's sister, Mary the wife of Clopas, and Mary Magdalene"" (John 19:25).


BIBLE: NO "" ... These things happened so that the scriptures would be fulfilled: 'Not one of his bones will be broken'"" (John 19:25, 36).



23. DID JESUS' HUMANITY AND DIVINITY DIE ON THE CROSS?


EGW: YES ""In him dwelleth all the fullness of the Godhead bodily. Men need to understand that Deity suffered and sank under the agonies of Calvary."" (Manuscript 44, 1898, and the Seventh-day Adventist Bible Commentary, vol. 7, p. 907).


EGW: NO ""The Deity did not sink under the agonizing torture of Calvary"" (Letter: 1899 quoted in the Seventh-day Adventist Bible Commentary, vol. 5, page 1129).



BIBLE: YES ""We believe that Jesus died and rose again"" (1Thessalonians 4:14).



24. DID JESUS DIE TO GIVE US A SECOND PROBATION?


EGW: YES ""Death entered the world because of transgression. But Christ gave his life that man should have another trial. He did not die on the cross to abolish the law of God, but to secure for man a second probation"" (Testimonies to Ministers, p. 134).

25. WAS THE ATONEMENT FOR SIN COMPLETED AT THE CR0SS?

EGW: NO ""Jesus entered the most holy of the heavenly (sanctuary), at the end of the 2300 days of Daniel 8, in 1844, to make a final atonement for all who could be benefited by His mediation"" (Early Writings, p. 253).


EGW: YES ""He [Christ] planted the cross between Heaven and earth, and when the Father beheld the sacrifice of His Son, He bowed before it in recognition of its
perfection. ""It is enough,"" He said. ""The Atonement is complete.""--The Review and Herald, Sept. 24, 1901.



BIBLE: YES ""When he had received the drink, Jesus said, 'It is finished.' With that, he bowed his head and gave up his spirit"" (John 19:30).


BIBLE: YES ""But now a righteousness from God, apart from law, has been made known, to which the Law and the Prophets testify. This righteousness from God comes through faith in Jesus and fall short of the glory of God, and are justified freely by his grace through the redemption that came by Christ Jesus. God presented him as a sacrifice of atonement, through faith in his blood"" (Romans 3:21-25).


BIBLE: YES ""Since we have now been justified by his blood, how much more shall we be saved from God's wrath through him! For if, when we were God's enemies, we were reconciled to him through the death of his Son, how much more, having been reconciled, shall we be saved through his life! Not only is this so, but we also rejoice in God through our Lord Jesus Christ, through whom we have now received reconciliation"" (Romans 5:9 11).


Bible: Yes ""Not only is this so, but we also rejoice in God through our Lord Jesus Christ, through whom we have now received reconciliation."" (Romans 5:11 NIV)

1k2vutc,https://www.reddit.com/r/Spiderman/comments/1k2vutc/absolute_spiderman_2/,Absolute Spider-Man 2#,"Chapter 7: The Aftermath of the Choice

The weight of Richard’s words lingered in the air, thick with unspoken disappointment and anger. Peter could almost feel his father’s glare burning into his back as he left the Parker Security building. It wasn’t just the company Peter was walking away from—it was the legacy, the path paved for him since birth.

But Peter had made his choice.

The night air slapped him in the face as he stepped outside. Cool. Sharp. Honest.

He inhaled deeply, trying to push away the guilt, the confusion... the pain. But beneath all that, for the first time in a long time, was clarity.

He wasn’t a businessman.

He wasn’t a puppet.

He was Spider-Man.

And the world would soon know it.


Chapter 8: The Web of Fate

The following weeks were a whirlwind. Peter threw himself into the role of Spider-Man, patrolling the city at night and helping anyone he could. At first, it felt exhilarating—stopping muggings, preventing carjackings, webbing up would-be robbers. But soon, the rush began to wear thin. The city didn’t need a thrill-seeker. It needed a symbol.

A protector.

A hero.

Every night, Peter refined his abilities—learning how to move, how to think, how to react. His body was adapting faster than he expected. But even as he grew more confident, something darker loomed just beyond the edges of his web.

He felt it.

A storm was coming.

One night, after dealing with a drug bust in the Lower East Side, Peter’s phone buzzed. A message from someone he hadn’t heard from in months.

Harry Osborn.

> “Need to talk. Meet me at the café. Urgent.”


Curiosity mixed with unease. Peter changed out of his suit, pulled on a hoodie, and made his way there.

Inside, Harry was already waiting, hunched over a half-finished coffee. He looked tired. Nervous.

""Hey, Pete,"" he said with a weak smile. ""You’ve been hard to reach.""

""Been busy,"" Peter replied, sliding into the seat. ""What’s going on?""

Harry looked around before leaning in. ""Something’s happening at Oscorp. My father’s got this project—something big, something secret. They’re calling it Project Venom.""

Peter frowned. ""What kind of project?""

""I don’t know,"" Harry admitted. ""But people have gone missing. Employees. Contractors. My dad’s hiding something... something dangerous.""

Peter felt a familiar chill crawl up his spine. ""You want me to break in?""

""I want you to find out the truth,"" Harry said. ""You're the only one who can do this quietly. You’ve always had a way of getting into places you weren’t supposed to be.""

Peter smirked slightly. ""I guess some things never change.""

But behind the joke, he was already planning.

If Norman Osborn was behind something called Venom, it couldn’t be anything good.


Chapter 9: Project Venom

The next several nights, Peter became a ghost in Oscorp’s halls—dodging cameras, hacking encrypted files, sneaking past guards. But no matter how deep he dug, there was nothing concrete. No logs. No records. Only one name that kept showing up on scattered test reports and erased lab schedules:

VENOM.

Whatever it was, it was off the books—and dangerous.

That same night, as rain fell in sheets and lightning danced in the sky, Peter walked through a deserted alley near Midtown. He was in civilian clothes, hood up, thoughts tangled in theories and dead ends. That’s when he heard the footsteps.

Slow. Heavy. Confident.

He turned.

A massive figure emerged from the darkness, clad in a slick, pulsating black suit that shimmered with life. A twisted white spider emblem stretched across his chest. His eyes—if you could call them that—were wide, monstrous, reflective.

The figure grinned, baring a mouthful of jagged teeth.

""Been lookin’ for you,"" the thing said, voice dripping like oil.

Peter didn’t hesitate. In one smooth motion, he launched a web-line to the wall and pulled himself up into the shadows, slipping into his suit midair.

Seconds later, Spider-Man landed on the rooftop, crouched and ready.

“Alright, big guy,” he said. “You’re clearly not from neighborhood watch.”

The creature laughed—a low, guttural sound that made Peter’s skin crawl.

“They call me Venom. And you? You’ve been pokin’ around in places you shouldn’t be.”

“So this is Norman’s pet project?” Spider-Man asked, circling him.

""Something like that,” Venom replied. “I get results, and they keep me alive.”

Peter’s eyes narrowed behind the mask. “So what’s your deal, huh? Revenge? Chaos? Big teeth?”

Venom’s smile didn’t waver. ""This ain't personal, Spider-Man. Just business.""

Peter’s stance faltered slightly.

That voice...

That smirk...

The rhythm of it...

He knew that voice.

“Wait a minute...” Peter murmured. “Eddie?”

Venom stopped. The grin flickered. “What did you just say?”

Peter stood frozen. “Eddie Brock...?”

Venom’s tone darkened. “You don’t know me.”

“I do. We grew up together. You—” Peter’s breath caught. “You were my best friend.”

Venom looked stunned. Then—rage.

He lunged.

Tendrils lashed out like vipers, and Peter barely dodged in time, swinging upward as the creature crashed into the side of the building with monstrous force.

“You just signed your death warrant, Webhead!” Venom roared. “Next time, I won’t miss.”

From a nearby rooftop, Peter watched him vanish into the night, black sludge trailing behind.

His heart was pounding—not just from the fight, but from the truth.

Eddie Brock.

His childhood best friend.

And he had no idea who Peter really was.

Would love feedback before we finalize our exterior wiring!

Hey guys,  
I'm currently in the process of building a new house and trying to map out as much as I can for my automation. We're almost at the ""lock up"" stage, and this will be my first smart home — aside from my current Telus security system, which is borderline useless.

**House details:**

* \~2100 sqft per floor
* Bungalow style with walkout basement
* Pool and hot tub in the backyard
* 3-car garage up front

From my fairly extensive research, I feel like Thread isn't quite ready yet, so I'm sticking with **Zigbee** for now. I'm aiming to stay local as much as possible, and I'll be using **Home Assistant** (Zigbee2MQTT with SLZB-07 dongle) + **Scrypted** to push everything into **Apple HomeKit**. We’re an Apple family and I want everyone to have an easy, polished interface.

# 🔒 Reolink Security Setup:

1k2vski,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskMenAdvice/comments/1k2vski/am_i_wasting_my_time_or_is_he_just_taking_things/,Am I wasting my time or is he just taking things slow? Feeling confused and need advice before I talk to him.,"I’ve been seeing this guy for about 4 weeks now. We see each other pretty often — almost every other day — and when we’re together, the chemistry is great. He talks about all these things we should do together in the future, and sometimes he even says things that sound like he’s imagining us getting married. It all sounds serious, but his actions leave me confused.

Our plans are always super casual and flexible — nothing really planned in advance. He hasn’t taken me on any “official” dates except for coffee shops. (To be fair, he’s currently on a strict diet/meal plan so he can’t really eat out, which could be part of it.) But still, I notice that he often has plans at night with his “friends” or “cousins,” and I end up feeling like I’m not being prioritized. He usually meets me earlier in the day or before the evening, even though a couple of times we have hung out later.

He did once mention that he would invite me to join him and his friends, but one of those friends is apparently best friends with his ex — and they just broke up three months ago. He said he’s afraid word will get back to her that he’s already dating, and he doesn’t want to hurt her.

When I asked him directly whether he’s seeing anyone else or has a girlfriend, he said no — that he’s only seeing me. It took him about three weeks to kiss me, and we haven’t had sex, so I don’t think he’s just after something physical. He texts me throughout the day and does spend a lot of time with me, but despite all that, I still feel unsure of where I stand.

I brought it up over the phone once and he said he’s just “getting to know me” and “taking things slow,” but I’m still left feeling like I’m in limbo. I guess I just believe that when someone really likes you, they make more of an effort to be intentional and make you feel secure.

I’m seeing him today and planning to talk to him about this. I don’t want to scare him off, but I do want clarity. I’m not trying to force anything, but I am looking for something serious — and if he’s not ready for that, I’d rather just be friends than stay in this unclear space.

Any advice on how to approach this conversation in a calm and honest way — without pushing him away, but still expressing my needs? Has anyone been through something similar?",1,1745067812.0,AskMenAdvice,23,1.0,False
1k2vrbp,https://www.reddit.com/r/HustleAndFaith/comments/1k2vrbp/bed_and_breakfast_with_a_twist/,Bed and Breakfast with a Twist,"Alright, let’s imagine the scene: you’re standing in the middle of a cozy little Airbnb, the walls adorned with literary quotes that make you feel like you’re rubbing elbows with Hemingway. The scent of fresh coffee wafts through, mingling with the faint aroma of old books, and there's a little nook where you can sit, read, and maybe even feel a twinge of inspiration wash over you. You know, the kind that whispers, “Write your novel! Or at least a couple of cool Instagram captions.” Welcome to the world of themed Airbnb experiences!

Now, if you’re curious about running a literary-themed Airbnb, there’s something magical about creating a space that not only serves as a comfortable place to crash but also stirs the imagination. Picture inviting guests to immerse themselves in the works of classic authors through interactive book club discussions or perhaps a cozy reading night with classics under dim fairy lights and enough cozy blankets to make a lavender farm jealous. Throw in a themed welcome basket—think bookmarks, a journal, or even a quirky pen that would make your 7th-grade self beam with pride—and you’re halfway there.

But let’s talk partnerships, because nothing enhances an Airbnb experience like collaborating with local businesses. Imagine teaming up with a nearby coffee shop that serves a “Literary Latte,” inspired by famous authors (I hear the “Faulkner Frappe” is a crowd favorite). You could work out a deal where, after booking, guests get a voucher for a free drink. Not only does this add value, but it also supports your local community, which is like the cherry on top of the sundae of the whole experience.

And here’s where it gets even better: think about having reading materials readily available from local authors or perhaps hosting small book launches or poetry readings in your space—what better way to strengthen the bond between your guests and the local literary scene? It’s like throwing a party where everyone is invited instantly, and each guest gets to take a piece of the community home with them.

Now, if you’re leaning towards a historical theme instead, the concept can be just as vibrant. Consider offering guests a glimpse into the past with artifacts or decor that tell a story in every corner. Maybe partner with a local historical museum to provide discounts for tours; after all, what’s better than digging into the history of the place you’re visiting? Maybe even organize a candlelight ghost tour option, topping it off with some hot cider—nothing like an eerie chill followed by a root-toot cider to ground you back into the now.

So, whether you're channeling your inner bookworm or your time-traveling historian, the key lies in creating not just a stay but an experience. It’s an opportunity for your guests to connect with a narrative deeper than their four walls—for them to feel like they’ve stepped into a story, even if the plot twist is simply finding out that their favorite coffee doesn’t actually come from Italy. 

And who knows? You might just spark a divine curiosity in someone, inspiring them to say “yes” to their own unique adventure—because, in the end, isn't that what community and faith are all about?

1k2vq1x,https://i.redd.it/c5ptcnfyhsve1.png,Why Strong Leadership Depends on Deep Relationships (Not Just Expanding Your Network) | Weekend Wellness,"**TL;DR:**  
Research shows that high-quality relationships—not a high quantity of connections—are critical to leadership effectiveness, mental health, and resilience. This Weekend Wellness post explores why depth matters more than breadth, how it impacts leadership performance, and practical strategies to deepen meaningful relationships. Consider taking time this weekend to focus on one or two important connections.

---

In leadership, we're often encouraged to ""build our networks,"" ""grow our circles,"" and ""connect with as many people as possible."" While there’s nothing inherently wrong with expanding your connections, the research is clear: when it comes to sustainable leadership success, *the depth of your relationships matters far more than the number of people you know.*

**The Science Behind Deep Connections and Leadership Effectiveness**

High-quality relationships act as a crucial buffer against leadership challenges like stress, burnout, and decision fatigue. Leaders with strong, supportive relationships experience:

- Lower rates of depression and anxiety
- Increased happiness and life satisfaction
- Greater resilience under pressure
- Better decision-making clarity
- Stronger immune system responses
- Even longer lifespans

(For reference, Harvard’s decades-long Grant Study and multiple organizational behavior studies point to relational strength as a key predictor of personal and professional well-being.)

In other words, deep relationships don’t just make us *feel better*—they make us *lead better.*

**Why Surface-Level Networking Falls Short**

While having a wide network can open doors, it often doesn’t provide the emotional grounding that leaders need to navigate high-stress environments. Shallow connections tend to focus on transactional exchanges—what someone can *get*—whereas meaningful relationships foster mutual trust, psychological safety, and honest feedback.

Without this foundation, leaders are more prone to:

- Isolation at the top (the ""lonely CEO"" phenomenon)
- Poor stress regulation
- Biased decision-making without trusted advisors
- A fragile leadership brand built on appearances rather than substance

**Practical Strategies for Nurturing Meaningful Relationships**

If you’re thinking, ""Okay, but how do I actually *build* deeper connections?"", here are some evidence-based practices you can start applying this weekend:

➔ **Practice Curious Listening**  
Instead of listening to respond, listen to *understand.* Ask open-ended questions that invite deeper conversation, and show genuine interest in the other person’s experiences.

➔ **Create Tech-Free Moments**  
Set aside time for undistracted interaction—no notifications, no multitasking. Even one tech-free coffee chat or walk can dramatically improve connection quality.

➔ **Engage in Shared New Experiences**  
Trying something new together—like learning a skill, visiting a new place, or collaborating creatively—strengthens relational bonds through novelty and shared growth.

➔ **Be Vulnerable, Gradually**  
Authenticity builds trust. Start by sharing smaller personal reflections and gradually deepen the conversation. Vulnerability invites vulnerability in return.

➔ **Reflect Together**  
Occasionally, take time to reflect on the relationship itself. Celebrate what’s working, identify opportunities to strengthen it further, and set shared goals for the future.

**Weekend Reflection Prompt**

If you're reading this on a weekend, consider this a personal reminder to *log off* from work tasks and *log into* one meaningful relationship instead. Pick one person you value, reach out, and be fully present without an agenda. You’ll likely find that these quiet investments pay some of the highest leadership dividends over time.

**Final Thought**

Leadership isn’t built solely in boardrooms, strategic plans, or KPIs. It’s built in trust, empathy, and real human connection. In a culture that often prizes busyness and volume, choosing depth is a quiet, revolutionary act—and it’s one that strengthens not just our personal lives, but our professional impact as well.

Would love to hear:  
- How do you intentionally nurture important relationships in your leadership or personal life?  
- Have you noticed a difference between times you had strong support versus when you didn't?

---

**TL;DR (again for convenience):**  
Leadership success isn’t about how many people you know—it’s about how well you’re connected to the ones who matter most. Deep relationships improve leadership performance, mental health, and resilience. This weekend, take time to nurture one or two meaningful connections. It’s a small act with a powerful impact.",1,1745067613.0,agileideation,0,1.0,False

The grocery stores are always lined with IPA after IPA and we really don't need that anymore since none of them are ever sold out and pretty much all of those shelves are fully stocked, while the actual good beers are nearly impossible to get because *everybody who drinks beer likes them*.

This isn't a dig at people who like IPAs, I'm sure there's a niche but Jesus Christ what did we do to deserve this? New brewery announces really fun sounding beer! It's a triple IPA! New one? Quintuple dodecatuple IPA! 

Next up, from `insert brewery name`, another IPA that tastes literally the same as the last 900 they released, but this one is brewed with `insert new fruit` .

Later, the coffee gets cold.
Later, you lose interest.
Later, the day turns into night.
Later, people grow up.
Later, people grow old.
Later, life goes by.
Later, you regret not doing something...
When you had the chance.

Life is a fleeting dance, a delicate balance of moments that unfold before us, never to return in quite the same way again.
Regret is a bitter pill to swallow, a weight that bears down upon the soul with the burden of missed chances and unspoken words.
So, let us not leave anything for later. Let us seize the moments as they come, with hearts open and arms outstretched to embrace the possibilities that lie before us. For in the end, it is not the things we did that we regret, but the things we left undone, the words left unspoken, the dreams left unfulfilled.

Why do some men keep trying & friggin trying with a woman who doesn’t like them. 

I’m not talking about maybe a couple who takes a break & then the guy politely calls & goes “hey do you want to talk?” Or a couple who takes time to get to the altar & maybe the question is asked once when she isn’t ready yet & once more when she is. Those are healthy relationship between consenting people who genuinely both love each other.

Or walk around crying the stranger on the subway wasn’t interested for like three years after passing her in public for like three weeks. I’m talking about guys who will see a cute barista & turn up at her house or something insane instead of just adding her on Snap.

I (38M) started the morning like any other. Big cup of coffee while making my daughters (4, 7) breakfast. Said cup of coffee hit, and wound up clogging the toilet. 

Right as I was about to deal with that, my daughters started screaming. They have a goldfish they called Goldy, and it was obviously dying. This was their first pet and we had told them we wanted them to show they can take care of it before they got something bigger, like a cat. 

Goldy died, and my daughters were crying terribly. This was their first experience with death, so had a long conversation with them about it. To give them some closure, I suggested we give the goldfish a proper funeral. 30 minute ceremony for the fish, and we were ready to send it to the great beyond from our toilet. My toilet no longer looked like it was clogged and was drained, so in Goldy went and flushed the toilet. 

The toilet unfortunately was still very much clogged. Goldy was not sent to the great beyond, instead the bowl was suddenly filled with shit and brown water again. Panicked I tried flushing it again but it made it worse and the bowl almost overflowed. Daughters were screaming, wife failing to comfort them, and me trying to plunge the toilet with a dead fish covered in shit.

So when they happen to be doing something out of coincidence that your brain really didn't want them to do; then it creates all the evidences for you to believe you're cursed. I'm struggling right now with huge anxiety thinking I'm cursed for actions other people have done and I cannot stop thinking about it. It's almost paralysing at times. Now I have to live through the anxiety waiting for my prophecies to become true (or hopefully not).

I am tired of living like this and every year my brain seems to be making up a prophecy. I hate the sense of impending doom that stains my life. I cannot almost do anything these days because everything feels wrong. I try to get up and of course I wash myself (even multiple times a day), I go get coffee, take a walk, do little errands, but at home I resort back to bedrotting and I really do not have the energy to enjoy the outside world. Because my thoughts are stronger and omnipresent and they are the filter to my reality, which has always to end up in tragedy.
Last year I was obsessed with tarot for instance, and in secret I think that I myself have cursed someone.
I have to repeat myself everyday that exactly as other people's actions can't dictate my life beyond some extent, the same applies to me. My silly compulsions or lack thereof can't change their reality. I am not a jealous person, but I envy people without any sort of magical thinking.

 ## Key Features Analysis

The best tablet holders for bed share several common features, but variations in design, materials, and adjustability differentiate the top contenders.

**Adjustability:** The level of adjustability is a crucial factor. Look for tablet holders that offer a wide range of motion in terms of height, angle, and rotation. This allows you to position your tablet at the perfect viewing angle, whether you're lying down, sitting up, or somewhere in between. Some models use ball joints for maximum flexibility, while others rely on gooseneck arms or telescoping poles. The ideal holder should offer both vertical and horizontal adjustment to accommodate different viewing preferences.

**Compatibility:** Ensure the tablet holder is compatible with your specific tablet model. Check the holder's dimensions and weight capacity to confirm that it can securely hold your device without slipping or wobbling. Many holders feature adjustable clamps or brackets that can accommodate a wide range of tablet sizes, from mini tablets to larger models. Some even include additional padding to protect your tablet from scratches. A universal tablet holder, designed to fit various sizes, is generally the best option.

**Stability and Durability:** The base of the tablet holder should be stable enough to prevent tipping or wobbling, even when the tablet is fully extended. Consider models with weighted bases or clamp-on designs for added stability. Durability is also important, especially if you plan to use the holder frequently. Look for holders made from high-quality materials like aluminum alloy or sturdy plastic. The joints and hinges should be robust enough to withstand repeated adjustments without loosening over time.

**Ease of Use:** A good tablet holder should be easy to set up and use. The clamping mechanism should be simple and secure, allowing you to quickly attach and detach your tablet. The adjustment controls should be intuitive and easy to operate, even in low-light conditions. Some models offer one-handed operation, which can be particularly useful when you're already lying in bed. Consider the overall design and ergonomics to ensure a comfortable and hassle-free experience.

**Mounting Options:** Tablet holders for beds offer a range of mounting options to suit different bed frames and preferences. Some models feature a clamp-on design that attaches to the headboard or side rail of the bed. Others have a freestanding base that can be placed on the floor or bedside table. Consider the available space and the type of bed frame you have when choosing a mounting option. A versatile holder with multiple mounting options can be a good choice if you anticipate using it in different locations.

 ## Core Benefits

Using a tablet holder for bed offers several significant benefits that enhance comfort, convenience, and overall user experience.

**Improved Posture and Reduced Neck Strain:** Holding a tablet in your hands for extended periods can lead to neck pain, shoulder stiffness, and poor posture. A tablet holder eliminates the need to hunch over or crane your neck, allowing you to maintain a more natural and comfortable posture. By positioning the tablet at eye level, the holder reduces strain on your neck and back, preventing discomfort and potential long-term health problems.

**Hands-Free Convenience:** A tablet holder frees your hands, allowing you to multitask or simply relax while enjoying your favorite content. You can eat snacks, drink coffee, or knit without having to hold your tablet. This is particularly useful for activities like video conferencing, where you need to use your hands for typing or gestures. Hands-free operation also makes it easier to read or watch movies in bed without fatigue.

**Enhanced Comfort and Relaxation:** Using a tablet in bed should be a relaxing experience, but holding a tablet can be tiring and uncomfortable. A tablet holder eliminates this discomfort, allowing you to fully relax and enjoy your content. By providing a stable and adjustable platform for your tablet, the holder enhances your overall comfort and enjoyment, making it easier to unwind and de-stress.

**Versatile Usage:** Tablet holders aren't just for beds; they can also be used in other locations, such as sofas, chairs, or even desks. Some models are portable and can be easily moved from one location to another. This versatility makes them a valuable accessory for anyone who uses a tablet frequently, regardless of where they are. A good tablet holder can adapt to different environments and usage scenarios, providing a consistent and comfortable viewing experience.

 ## FAQs Section

**Is the tablet holder compatible with all tablet sizes?**
  Most tablet holders feature adjustable clamps or brackets that can accommodate a wide range of tablet sizes, typically from 7 inches to 13 inches. However, it's essential to check the specific dimensions and weight capacity of the holder to ensure compatibility with your tablet. Some holders are specifically designed for larger tablets or smaller devices, so choose accordingly.

**How easy is it to assemble and adjust the tablet holder?**
  Most tablet holders are relatively easy to assemble, typically requiring only a few simple steps. The included instructions should provide clear guidance. Adjusting the holder is also usually straightforward, with intuitive controls for height, angle, and rotation. Some models offer one-handed operation for added convenience.

**What is the maximum weight capacity of the tablet holder?**
  The maximum weight capacity varies depending on the model, but most tablet holders can support tablets weighing up to 2-3 pounds. It's crucial to check the weight capacity before purchasing to ensure that the holder can safely and securely hold your tablet. Exceeding the weight capacity can compromise stability and potentially damage the holder or your tablet.

**Will the tablet holder damage my bed frame?**
  Tablet holders with clamp-on designs typically feature padding or rubber grips to protect your bed frame from scratches or damage. However, it's still important to check the clamp regularly and ensure that it's not overtightened. If you're concerned about potential damage, consider a freestanding model with a weighted base.

Hi everyone,

I’m writing here because I’m carrying something heavy, and I don’t really know what to do with it anymore. Maybe just putting it into words will help. Maybe someone out there will recognize what I’m going through.

So here’s my story:

I was deeply in love with someone — let’s call her P. We shared something intense, emotional, full of depth and beauty, but also of instability. Our relationship had its cracks, and eventually, we fell apart.

But we didn’t fully let go. She kept messaging me. Almost every day. She’d say she missed me, that I was on her mind, that she wasn’t feeling well. She’d send pictures of her new apartment, ask how I was, check in with tenderness. She even told me she loved me.

But here’s the thing: she also told me — eventually — that she’s seeing someone else. And not just casually. She’s going to meet his parents.

I’ve been spiraling since.
Not because I’m angry.
But because I just don’t understand.

How can someone tell you “you’re in my heart” and “I miss you deeply,” but still choose to build a new life with someone else? Is she lost? Is she confused? Am I just the emotional cushion while she transitions?

I want to believe that she’s sincere.
I want to believe that maybe she really is torn.
That maybe she still loves me in a deep, buried way.
But I also know that actions matter more than words.

And the truth is — she hasn’t made a move toward me. She says she’s scared. That it’s “all weird.” She tells me she misses me “like crazy,” but avoids seeing me. Even a coffee is too much. So I try to accept. I try not to force. I’ve said all I could, and I’ve done everything I know how to do.

Now, I’m just walking.
Trying to heal.
Trying to stop holding on to something that’s maybe only alive in me.
But in my heart of hearts, I still love her.

I’m not waiting. I’m not chasing.
But I’d be lying if I said I didn’t hope — that something might shift, someday.
That if this love is real, it will find its way.
And if not, then maybe letting go is the only real form of love I have left.

I’d love to hear your thoughts.
Is she being sincere but unstable?
Or am I just holding on to a ghost dressed in sweet words?

Thank you for reading.


PS:
We were together for about two and a half, maybe three years. It’s been around eight months since we last truly saw each other. The last time we slept together was about a month ago — that’s when she told me she was seeing someone, but described it as chaotic, “not serious,” that she was in free fall.
And truthfully, as much as I hate where we are now, I’m grateful that she told me — that she didn’t play a double game. That counts for something.
She was my person. And maybe we can lie to ourselves all day, but during that call, I heard it in her voice — there was some truth, some real confusion. I believe she’s lost.

To be fair, we were always a story of bad timing. She chased me hard at first to win me back into this relationship. And now it was my turn. And I didn’t know how to meet her at the right moment, to be the right partner when it mattered.
Maybe now, it’s her turn to miss the moment — maybe she’s in the middle of a bad rebound, a misguided adventure. But that’s not my place anymore.",2,1745066154.0,AmIOverreacting,5,1.0,False

1k2v9lv,https://www.reddit.com/r/AITAH/comments/1k2v9lv/aita_for_walking_out_on_a_4_month_relationship/,AITA for walking out on a 4 month relationship?,"**Am I being dramatic for not getting over this relationship as easily as I thought I would? Why can't I hate him when he's given me a lot of reasons to? I know I did the right thing but why doesn't it feel like so?**

I (19F) started dating my ex (20M) last year, we only lasted four months before I decided to call it quits. For context, we go to the same uni and we essentially got closer through a campus organization. He's the head for one of the organization's unit.

When we got close, it wasn't as easy as I thought it'd be, I had a falling out with my friend, he had to hold back his toxic friend group (which consists of girls btw) from approaching me because he's sort of a ""prisoner"" to them. But through it all I still decided to date him because I felt like we're the same person, I love talking with him, random trips, stupid jokes we'd throw at each other etc. I think this would be a good time to mention that this is my first relationship, I've never dated anybody before so he's my first.

The first month of dating was absolutely peace, I had no complains whatsoever. I mean how could I? He was perfect and the way he treated me made me unconsciously fall head over heels even though I promised myself I never would. He was patient, never forced me to share my location, never forced me to say I love you back, never forced me to show off our relationship on my socials. He was sweet, he knew I had strict rules at home so he'd always panic whenever he doesn't drop me off on time. He'd make time to drive 1 hour to me after he had a study session at night just to hang out with me, hell he even brought food for my family. On our semester break, he'd take me on trips to his town, he'd always know where to go, what to do, even down to the small romantic things like bringing me to one of his best friend's workplace just to introduce me. He'd show me off on his socials, he introduced me to his mom, he'd kiss my cheek at every red light, he'd notice the small expression I had on my face. And on days when I'm not allowed to go out? He'd take a 2 hour drive from his town to my home just to hangout with me at home.

I could go on about his sweet behavior but not without the plot twist here. Once we've gone past the one month mark, we had our first fight on valentines day. I gifted him a handmade card along with a toy and some chocolate. I knew he forgot about valentines day but I still decided to gift him something just because. Turns out, he remembered it was valentines day, he just ""doesn't celebrate it"". So I was disappointed but I tried swallowing it down. We fought because when we were at his house, I mentioned how I was ""bored"". Not in a literal sense, just in a ""what should we do next"" sense. He got offended and shut down immediately. We moved to a cafe but I didn't even want to eat or drink anything there because I felt guilty. The whole time we were there he was just focused on his phone doing ""organization"" stuff. Anyhow thats how our fights usually go after that. Either one of us gets pissed, he shuts down and doesn't contact me for hours until he's finally not busy. The fight happens even more regularly when we got back in uni. I've tried multiple ways to handle it, through chat, irl, speaking nicely, staying quiet, until he pushed me to my limits and I started shouting at him through the phone. The final method I used was mirroring his actions by shutting down, and apparently that was his final straw. He said ""lets just breakup cause it's difficult"" a few days before my birthday. I didn't say yes neither did I say no. I asked if that is what he actually wants, because I just want to make sure since I'm not the type of person who wants to regret. He finally gave in and we made up.

And so we made up, I offered starting on a blank page to which he replied ""yeah sure whatever you say it is"". I always knew he's not a good communicator, sometimes the words he says to me are hurtful but again, I'd always reason by thinking ""thats not what he means, he just doesn't know how to say it nicely"".

Along the line I realize my mistakes too, I'm not a saint here, I admit we were both toxic. But I try to manage my feelings, I try to manage my disappointments, I try to not expect anything from him, I try to rationalize that ""oh he's just busy, once he's not busy he'll be back to being sweet"". Though the people around me keep telling me that he's toxic, I tried to reason by saying ""I'm not always right too you know? Maybe if he's giving 20% into the relationship right now, I should give 80% since we can't both always give 100% to each other"". I kept reasoning that maybe I was too demanding when he's busy, After all, I'm also in this organization so technically he's taking care of me too right?

A week after we made up was normal, I was actually sort of hopeful that we'd go back to our normal thing. That this is just a ""phase"" we had to go through. But I guess I can't be hopeful at all. I asked him to go on dinner with me after our organization's event, my treat since it was a week past my birthday. On the day of the date, I reminded him of it to which he said he forgot, but we still went anyways. I had a sick feeling in my stomach for some reason, it wouldn't go away but I thought it's just my usual stomach issues. On the drive home I still had this uneasy feeling that seriously bothered me but I tried ignoring it again. Once we arrived in front of my home, I started making a vlog unboxing his gifts for my birthday and some things he bought for me from his trip from abroad. I don't know what came over me, or if I did the right thing, but I asked for one last favor from him. I asked to check his phone in hopes it would ease my sick feeling. What I found was exactly the opposite.

He was chatting with a random girl who ""wanted to know him better"" to which he allowed. The girl kept asking if he had a gf, but he never replied yes or no. He laughed it off and when the girl ask if it was okay to chat him, he said it was okay. So, essentially micro cheating. I also found out on the day of my birthday, he replied to a girl's IG story asking to meet up for coffee. Even though the coffee meet up was also attended by his guy friends, it still broke my heart. I tried opening a chat room between him and one of his ""girl"" friends who is totally crazy for him but he immediately asked for his phone back.I decided I saw enough, and asked why he did it. He had a weak defense, saying ""it's clearly a fake account, i just wanted to mess around"". I even asked why didn't he tell me about it, saying I would be fine with him messing around if he had just told me. He had no more defense, so I grabbed my stuff and before leaving the car, I asked to breakup. He didn't even apologize, he didn't say anything and just said ""okay"". I got inside the house, deleted all traces of him on my phone, and I had a sinking feeling that he wouldn't even text me afterwards. And I was right, he never did text nor reach out, didn't even come over to me during an organization event the next day. And thats where we're left at. No closure, no nothing. In a way I'm happy it was over because I realize that I was willing to go through anything with him, even if it meant swallowing all of my disappointments and losing myself, because my mindset was ""as long as he's not cheating or putting his hands on me"".  But in another way, I keep thinking if I was overreacting, if we never had fought in the first place, if I hadn't shouted at him, would it have turned out better?

Granted, I'm currently on week two of the breakup and I think I'm handling it better? But sometimes I can't help and think ""Was I being dramatic?"" ""Am I being dramatic for not getting over this quickly?"" ""It was just a 4 month relationship, not that big of a deal right?"" ""Should I go back to him?"" ""Should I talk this out with him? I usually initiate talking things out with him"" ""Why do I still want him back?"". So my final question is, what do I do now? I know I'm supposed to heal but how?",1,1745066103.0,AITAH,6,1.0,False

So… I kinda moved to Genk by accident 2 years ago. Ja echt. After a breakup, Belgium was meant to be a temporary stop and then back to the NL. But you know what? I ended up loving it here. Fast-forward to today: I did my inburgering classes, and I’m now doing a Dutch B1 course. Limburg became my home and sanctuary. It’s peaceful, kind, and surprisingly full of things to do.

Maar eerlijk? Ik ben bijna 30 en voel me soms al met prepensioen.
And while I don’t need people around me all the time, I would like to have a bit more social life, culture, and city vibes. More ancient artifacts in museums, rather than on the streets. (I’m joking, of course, I’m grateful for the gepensioneerde buren, without them and hun geduld my Dutch wouldn’t be where it is now)

I’ve lived around Europe, speak a bunch of languages (now Dutch included), and I’m someone who loves long walks, good conversations, and livable city life.

Lately, I’ve got this gut feeling that Antwerpen is calling me. But I need help figuring out if that’s a brilliant idea or a midlife crisis in disguise.

1. Waar wonen de leuke mensen van 30-ish?
	•	I love walking, hate biking, and have a car (garage = nice bonus)
	•	Bonus for a bit of green, coffee spots, and people who say hi

2. Hoe bouwen mensen hier een sociaal leven op?
	•	I’m not super outgoing, but love meeting people organically
	•	Zijn er leuke plekken, events of clubs waar je mensen kunt leren kennen? (Misschien roeien?)

3. Centrum of net erbuiten?
	•	I want culture and walkability
	•	But is het centrum te druk/prijzig/stressy? What’s the sweet spot?

4. En daten?
	•	Geen must, maar ik sta open voor liefde

So tell me: Is Antwerpen my next move or should I calm down and enjoy my Limburg retirement lifestyle?

Any thoughts, tips, brutally honest takes, perhaps kind encouragements — I’d love to hear them. Are you in a similar situation? Let’s swap stories!",6,1745065978.0,Antwerpen,13,0.8,False

1 oz whole milk

Put milk in mixing glass. Put all ingredients in shaker with ice, shake until chilled, and then add to milk in mixing glass. Rest for 30 minutes. Strain curdled milk/cocktail mixture with coffee filter (I strained 2x total). Serve over ice with lime garish.

  
I had never made a clarified cocktail before and wanted to try it -- plus had separately been thinking that a coffee margarita sounded tasty. So I ended up doing both! I had to tinker with the recipe a couple times to make sure the coffee and lime juice were coming through enough. I also left the Cointreau from traditional margarita recipes and added orange bitters since coffee and orange go well together. It seems like a lot of liquid but you lose some with the clarification.

But between picking out paint colors and figuring out where the coffee table should go, there’s one thing you don’t want to overlook: homeowners insurance. It’s not the most thrilling part of homeownership, but you’ll be glad you have it when a surprise hailstorm rolls through or a pipe decides to burst in the dead of winter. So, what do first-time buyers need to know about [homeowners insurance in the Twin Cities](https://agents.allstate.com/jl-insurance-chanhassen-mn.html)? Let’s break it down without all the jargon.

**Why It’s Different Here**

Minnesota isn’t exactly known for its gentle weather. Between heavy snow, ice dams, summer storms, and the occasional tornado warning, your house has to put up with a lot. Standard Twin Cities home insurance usually covers things like fire, wind damage, and theft, but some of the biggest headaches like flooding or sewer backups often need extra coverage. Yeah, it’s a bummer, but better to find out now than when your basement’s underwater.

https://preview.redd.it/uzl9jixgasve1.jpg?width=684&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=dc3e88d66e1444e069ceade30ea563dd88b82893

**What You’re Actually Paying For**

A good policy does more than just protect the structure of your home. It covers your stuff (think furniture, clothes, that fancy TV), liability if someone gets hurt on your property, and even temporary living expenses if your place becomes unlivable after a disaster. But here’s the kicker; not all policies are created equal. Some cut corners on personal property limits or have sneaky exclusions. That’s why it pays to read the fine print or, better yet, work with a local agent who can explain [Twin Cities home insurance](https://agents.allstate.com/jl-insurance-chanhassen-mn.html) in plain English.

**How Much Should You Expect to Pay?**

Prices vary depending on your home’s age, location, and even your credit score - it's annoying, but true. Older homes might cost more to insure if they’ve got outdated wiring or plumbing, while places near fire stations or with security systems often score discounts. And hey, if you bundle your home and auto insurance, you could save a decent chunk of change.

**Common Mistakes to Avoid**

First-time buyers sometimes make a few classic blunders, like:

* Underinsuring – That high budget policy might sound like a lot until you realize rebuilding costs have gone up.
* Skipping Flood Coverage – Even if you’re not in a flood zone, a heavy rainstorm can turn your yard into a pond.
* Forgetting to Update – Got a new roof or renovated the kitchen? Tell your insurer it could lower your rates.

**The Bottom Line**

Insurance isn’t just a checkbox to cross off before closing. It’s your safety net when life or weather throws a curveball. If you’re feeling overwhelmed, that’s normal. A good local agent—like the team at JL Insurance: Allstate Insurance—can walk you through it without the sales pitch. They know the Twin Cities, they know the risks, and most importantly, they’ll make sure you’re actually covered when you need it. So take a deep breath, grab a coffee, and tackle this one step at a time. Your future homeowner self will thank you.",1,1745065135.0,WriteNerds,0,1.0,False

Our two families knew each other in Berlin in the 1920s. My grandmother used to tell a story from when she was a child. One day, Albert Einstein and his wife came for dinner at the family’s apartment on Kaiserallee near the Kurfürstendamm. She recalled peering through the keyhole of the dining room door and seeing that the great scientist was wearing house slippers, confirming rumours of his forgetful nature.

After the meal, her father, Alfred Alexander, escorted Albert to the salon to take coffee, intending to quiz him about the theory of relativity. But when he climbed into bed later that night, Alfred confessed to his wife that he and his guest had become so engrossed in discussing the latest detective novels that he had forgotten to ask.

The two men also had a professional relationship. My great-grandfather was the Einstein family doctor. On 27 April 1926, Albert Einstein wrote a letter thanking my great-grandfather for the treatment he had provided to his terminally ill uncle and aunt: “Dear and esteemed Dr Alexander!” Albert said. “Words cannot express the good you have done for my family.” Having detailed the specifics of the treatment, he ended with a sentence that imagined a tactile link between the two families: “Clasping your hand in sincere gratitude, A Einstein.” “ - Thomas Harding, The Guardian
