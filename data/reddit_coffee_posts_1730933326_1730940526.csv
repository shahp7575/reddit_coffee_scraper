1gle3e4,https://www.reddit.com/r/Hyperhidrosis/comments/1gle3e4/what_is_causing_this_odd_case_for_me/,What is causing this? Odd case for me,"19 year old male, I suffer from primarily a sweaty back, face, chest, and butt-region.

Used to run a lot in high school, still run occasionally, but not so much anymore. I would get quite sweaty in HS running, but it never impacted me outside of running. Issue got worse during my freshman year of college, and has reached an absolute breaking point now:

Any sort of walking outside triggers it. I used to think it was anxiety related, and definitely it does happen with that sometimes, but the walking is the big issue with this one. It's like I get a hot flash or feeling in my body and I can tell that I'm going to pour sweat.

Also, if I'm walking and then have to stop and stand still (e.g. in line), then I will absolutely pour once I stop, oddly enough.

I can go to the gym, which is air conditioned, and have a workout with lifting weights where I get far less sweaty than walking around a city for a half-hour.

It's not localized to any one area, rather it is my entire body that sweats (minus hands, feet). I'm a healthy weight and workout a lot, don't eat the best diet since I'm at college but it isn't terrible.

I tried cutting out coffee, it didn't help much. Exercise in the morning doesn't really help me for the rest of the day.   
It is also incredibly variable from day to day -- I can have a warm day where its 70 degrees and I'm doing a lot better walking around than on a 40 degree day with a strong breeze.

Went to the doctor, all my levels were fine and they just told me to go to a dermatologist.

  
What could help me with this? I'm confident that its solvable because it wasn't always like this for me. Also, primary hyperhidrosis usually is localized to one area, while this is really my entire body that sweats. If I'm sitting down its fine typically (no sweat)

It feels like a temperature regulation issue, and I find it so odd that some days are arbitrarily much better than others while some days are awful.

Things like iontophoresis and wipes are not an option for me given that it is my entire body.

Someone please help and let me know what I could do to solve this? Elimination diet? Supplements? ",1,1730940389.0,Hyperhidrosis,0,1.0,False

But for the sake of contextualising, I recently started college and people have pointed out a concerning amount of times about me suddenly falling asleep. Falling asleep involuntarily has been a part of my life for years at this point, and I never really realised how abnormal that was- my friends have been joking about my sleepiness and ""power naps"" (not sure if that's the right word, but I take a nap to take a break from studying by setting an alarm, head down, and waking up very refreshed in 10/15 minutes) for years now. I fall asleep after coming home, and my family, before moving out, had given up on waking me up from my naps for dinner (since I wouldn't wake up. I would have no memory of even regaining consciousness a little). I've been doing everything from sleeping properly at night to chugging coffee during my lectures, but the only thing that seems to help is if I *constantly* have something to do with my hands. The second the lecturer is talking too slowly, or if there's a second too long of a pause between slides, I blink and now I'm just walking up from a nap. Its frustrating... 

A little bit of recent googling pointed me in this direction. 

Honestly, wether or not I have N2/IH isn't my concern. It's that I need some encouragement in taking the step towards seeing someone that could be able to help me, if that even is possible. I'm not even sure if I can get diagnosed, I just need some courage.

We are a party of two trans women (20, 27) and a nonbinary person (25) with myself (TF23) as DM. 

We are looking for one or two individuals who bring good vibes, are easygoing, and enjoy both roleplay and combat in 5e. 

I am running a campaign that I'm calling The Well of Ascension and it's about a legendary fountain of youth that is rumored to be a pathway to divinity. You are to assist the Pegille Republic (think steampunk fantasy setting Wakanda, but a tad more corrupt) in securing the Well of Ascension against the Imperial forces of the Titania Empire (deeplore and deep magical secrets. Ancient magics lost to time and the whims of the gods). On the deck of a flying ship, captained by the Pirate Queen, your party of hired mercenaries accompany Lt. Technika, an Omnilimb Artificer. 

Can't say much more without major spoilers but some factions include the Moonstalker Conclave, the Finisordo Alpha Team, Azriel the right hand of the Lady of Light, and much more. 

Preferably (but not necessarily) part of the LGBTQ+ Community and/or a woman. Strictly speaking, everyone is welcome but please be respectful. 

Ideally someone aged between 19-35, likes pizza, is 420 friendly (only very mild intoxication while playing D&D), and wants to make four new friends.

Playing on Fridays usually in the afternoon but can do evening as well. We plan one month ahead. The whole campaign will be played in 12 sessions over 6 months and will be played IRL in South Van.


TLDR: looking for a d&d player who is ideally queer and between 19-35 years old. 

If you're interested, please feel free to DM me or leave a comment! I'd like to meet over coffee first to see if we have a good vibe match for D&D.

Ellam my parents just decided by themselves and found her, spoke to her parents and they just agreed it seems. All of a sudden a week ago they told me, gave me her number, and ig and asked me to talk to her. It was a bit of a shock cause idhu varaikkum ponnu kitta naan pesinadhe illa.  

I spoke to her, and it was very nerve wracking, but she was cheerful and held the conversation. We then met up for a coffee, chatted for hours, she was delightful. She seemed very sincere, genuine and told me about her past relationship in college. Adha pathi onnum illa but i've never been in a relationship, apdina ennanu kuda theriyadhu. I'm also pretty introverted and don't really mingle too much with everyone. She on the other hand is a social butterfly, with tons of friends. 

I have a fear of disappointing her as I got no dating experience at all. I also tend to be a bit silent, preferring to listen to the convo rather than carrying it.  Both of us work in IT in MNC's, earning about the same. She is a capable young woman, independent and confident. In a way she completes me, ana im just feeling a bit inferior.

Honestly I'm lucky that my parents have such good game, or else I would be single forever. Is she too good for me though? So far I've known her for a week, and i spoke to her openly about everything, I couldn't even maintain eye contact at the time. She was very understanding, mature and non judgemental, very accepting of me as well. Said she likes me and wanted to slow it down a bit if i felt so.  

I'm also a chinna pulla in a way (ignore my username), just like a kid despite being 26 years old, still vevaram theriyama, easy going type. All these events are happening a bit soon, but if i back out, I'm only gonna get older, and who knows if i will get such a match again? My parents need to work overtime. also really regretted wasting my teens being an introvert and not talking to girls and trying to date them. 

Back to the situation,we just had my potential in laws at our place yesterday and all seemed really great. Our parents want us to get married soon and give them grandkids by the next year. Both of us feel its a bit too soon, as we have careers n all.

To give some more context, he is married (unsure of how long) and knows I am single (I’ve talked about going on a few dates as small talk before classes start). 

I am a senior in college and completing a year-long residency for student teaching in a high school. The high school I student teach at is an hour away from my college where I also live on-campus.

We began communicating around July via email to discuss what I needed to prepare for my first day of student teaching and such and he provided me with his phone number as it was easier to communicate through there. I thought nothing of it and figured it was normal and a lot easier, especially for younger teachers. However, a few weeks after I began my student teaching he added me on Snapchat via my phone number he had. Again, thought nothing crazy of it as since then he never snapped me or viewed my stories and did not even seem like he was active on there. But, about three days ago I posted a bit of a thirst trap on my Snapchat story thinking nothing of it and he slid up on it. The caption of my pic was along the lines of “played fortnite hella late but still can serve” and he slid up saying the new season was fun. I replied saying yeah it is and he suggested we should play sometime. I thought this was a little weird but not crazy but I said maybe. After that, he said “You look like you’re slaying” directed towards my snap story. I said “haha thanks i guess you mean my story” trying to be dumb and he said “Yes of course, love it!” which I just said thanks again to to refrain from awkwardness. That was the end of the conversation on Snapchat. When I returned to teaching today, he came in saying there was a substitute and was a bit all over the place as he was chaperoning a field trip. When he had to leave, he texted me after saying he was sorry for leaving in a fluster and I said it was fine as he had to be somewhere. He thanked me and then suggested taking me out for lunch or coffee. I said he didn’t have to and that what I did was the least I could do and then tried changing the conversation to ask about a student. After he answered my question, he switched it back to taking me out to lunch by saying I should find a place to eat for us to figure out.

I just want to know if I’m overreacting by thinking this is weird as I have never experienced this before or if its getting weird and will only cause me trouble in the long run.

The networking and NAS situation is not ideal at the moment (Synology NAS with 1Gbe connection). We have several editors working off their laptop from individual SSDs. We ingest footage to the NAS, transfer this month's footage to our drives, and then edit locally on our machines. It's not ideal but I think everyone enjoys the flexibility of being able to work on the couch or in the coffee shop on their laptop. I much prefer something different, but I digress. 

I use SyncThing at home for syncing game files across my Steam Deck and my PC. I use SyncThing for file transfers from my working SSD to my home NAS. The thing about GoodSync is that it doesn't seem to like multiple computers syncing or backing up to the same folder. I haven't figured out a way to reliably get it to work. 

I was thinking about using SyncThing for our editors to keep active backups going to the NAS so that we always have our folder backed up. I am still working on a file name and folder structure standard but it is as follows: 

Year>Month>Shoot Name and Date>Footage, Audio, Project Files, etc.

My one concern with syncing in and of itself is that if a file gets deleted on the SSD, it gets deleted on the NAS. We are constantly having to clear and offload our drives to free up space for the new footage we shoot and need to edit so I don't want to accidentally lose anything. I have been reading on the docs about receive only, send only, and ignore delete. I know the devs don't love the ignore delete feature. I also don't want to deal with relying on a folder that just houses the archival and deleted files.

we had a thing for a few months back in high school, we didnt officially date, but would stay the night at each others place and hook up. 
12 years later we match on bumble.

we’re flirting from the start, messaging for about a week before our first date.
first date, i pick her up, we hug, compliment each other. car ride, we’re talking about old friends & things we did in high school together. 
we go to an interactive art museum for about 2 hours, got food after, then went back to her place to watch anime together.
we cuddled, watched what we had planned to watch. she puts something else on, we talk for hours, start making out, things are getting hot so i offer to go down on her & we end up having sex.
we talked about what we’re looking for before that, wanting something long term, not looking for casual. she did keep asking “should we not have done that? i feel like we shouldnt have done that”.
i end up staying the night since it was around 3-4am after. we wake up, get coffee, smoke together. i leave by noon.
we continue to message everyday, plan a second date the same week. second date, we hit the arcade then get snacks and back to her place to watch horror movies. talk for hour & get intimate again. 
she noticed i got rid of my bumble, i express i dont like talking to multiple people at the same time, she still wants to date since i was her first date on the app. i can understand that, cant help but be a little jealous but i get it.
everything feels like it’s going good, we have lots in common, conversation feels effortless, we make plans the next week to go hiking.
day before our third date, she sends a long message essentially saying;

“i feel like we’ve been moving fast after 2 dates & wish we didnt do so much on the first date or took it slower. i do like you & we have lots in common. i dont know if i want to be in a relationship or if we’re better as friends”

i express we dont have to know if we want to be a relationship together or not yet since its only been 2 dates. but i know i want to keep seeing you and where it goes. 

we still go on the hike, get food and then hang at her place to talk more about it.
what i got from the talk;
she ended a 10yr relationship 2 years ago, just got the apps cause she was a 3rd wheel w her friends and hated it & i happened to be her first date. so, she wants to keep dating and not settle for the first match & someone she already knew.
i understand that, i ask if she wants to take a break from each other or talk less? there was a lot of “ i dunno” & “i just dont wanna hurt you” repeated.
i confessed i felt infatuated & ill get hurt now or later anyways so id rather risk it by continuing to keep going out.
when i said something about “feelings being one sided” she did make sure to correct me that she does like me. we talked about slowing down looked like after hooking up on the first date, she didnt give any boundaries & i just said building up our intimacy. she asked about being friends, i told her ive never stayed friends with anyone i was romantically interested in before so it may not work. i asked if i was being too much romantically cause i want to be but she said i wasnt.
after the talk we continued to talk normally, cuddle & kiss still. 

we’ve been seeing each other for about a month now & had 3 dates that extended to long hangouts at her place after. 
im not sure what to do, i didnt text her the whole day after that to try and give her some space & i ended up hard crying after then she texted me to play some video games online the same night.

i guess, other than just venting online, what im asking here, is there a way to save this? do i back off a bit & give her space? is she just trying to let me down & im not accepting it?

1gldjbs,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1gldjbs,37 Cal Fudgey Brownies (or 47 cal with icing),"Yesterday, I needed to quickly whip up some low cal snacks, and was feeling brownies. I was really impressed with the outcome of this batch, and they were SO freaking good! I’ve tried pretty much every recipe out there, and much like a lot of us, this ended up being a mash-up of many.

I’m not into cake-like brownies, and I did try this recipe last week using 50% casein and 50% whey, but the casein made it too dry. I remade the recipe today and replaced the casein with all whey protein, as I was already using pastry flour. Let me tell you these came out fudgey, gooey and tasted legit. 

I used a standard square baking tin (don’t know exact size - sorry!). I like to let them cool in the oven without opening the door for around 30-60 minutes. Apparently, this helps prevent sinking/deflation. Once out of the oven, allow to cool further in tray. I then added icing, cut into 9 pieces, and placed in the freezer to set for an hour or so.

These brownies come to 37 calories (per piece) without icing, or 47 calories with icing (recipe included in photos). You could easily cut smaller pieces to lower the recipe further, but I find 9 pieces to be pretty decent, and I will often have two as a snack.

I’ve also included a few tips that I’ve found helpful when it comes to using liquid egg whites (esp. if you don’t have access to fresh), and how to mix the batter into the whipped whites without deflating before baking.


Brownie Recipe (makes 9 pieces):

Dry Ingredients
* 20g pastry flour
* 20g whey protein isolate (I only had vanilla, but chocolate would be ideal)
* 20g cocoa powder
* 0.5 tsp baking soda (not powder)
* 0.25 tsp salt
* 50g granulated sweetener
* 50g brown granulated sweetener
* 10g psyllium husk
* 0.5 tsp cream of tartar
* 1 tsp instant coffee

Wet Ingredients
* 50g Chobani Fit Greek yoghurt
* 100g liquid egg whites
* 1 tsp vanilla extract
* 50ml unsweetened almond milk
* 100-150ml Diet Coke or Pepsi Max (I recommend vanilla flavour)

Icing Ingredients (optional)
* 15g casein protein
* 40g powdered sweetener
* 5g cocoa powder
* 30g Chobani Fit greek yoghurt

Method
1. Preheat oven to 170°C. 
2. Pour the egg whites into an oven safe bowl and place in the oven while preheating for around 2-3 minutes. Be careful when removing the bowl from the oven. I prefer to use a glass bowl as it retains the heat evenly. It shouldn’t be hot, just warm, and the egg whites should still be clear.
3. While the oven is preheating with the egg whites, combine all dry ingredients in a bowl, except the brown granulated sweetener. Mix well.
4. Add the yoghurt, almond milk and vanilla extract to the bowl and mix well.
5. Slowly begin to add the Coke Zero/carbonated choice to the batter in increments and gently stir. Do not overstir. You may or may not need to use the full amount. The aim here is to create a brownie batter consistency - not too thick and not too runny. 
6. Moving on to the egg whites; add the cream of tartar to eggs. Using an electric beater on the high setting, mix the egg whites for around 2-3 minutes, or until they become fluffy and cloud-like. The eggs will begin to thicken slightly. Stop to scrape down the sides of the bowl with a silicone spatula. Once fluffy, take a break from mixing and sprinkle the brown granulated sweetener over the egg whites, then continue to mix until fully combined (1 minute or so).
7. Now that you have two bowls, we need to combine them. It is important to use a silicone spatula when doing this. Start by scooping a small amount of the egg white mixture into the batter and combine it gently using the ‘fold’ technique. I find that adding the eggs to the batter in small amounts allows the two to combine easier and prevents deflation. Aim for the mixtures to be around 80-90% combined in one bowl (don’t worry if you can still see some of the egg mixture in the batter - it’s best to not overstir and risk losing volume).
8. Slowly pour the mixture into your baking tray of choice, smooth out any bumps to create an even surface, and place into the oven for 20-25 minutes. I prefer fudgey brownies, so 20 minutes was perfect.
9. Allow to cool in the oven for as long as possible once finished. Tip: do not open the oven during or after the cooking process. It helps to maintain the volume and prevents deflation. They also settle much nicer if they’ve had enough time to rest. Once enough time has passed, allow to fully cool in the tray before icing. If you’re having them as is, cut into 9 pieces and enjoy :)
10. The icing is super easy and I like to pre prepare it while the brownies are baking and leave it to thicken in the fridge - simply take the casein protein, Greek yoghurt and powdered sweetener, and mix, using small amounts of almond milk to help combine the ingredients. I like to keep mine thick, so don’t add large amounts of almond milk. Once the brownies are cooled, evenly spread with icing, slice into 9 pieces (or whatever your heart desires), and store in the fridge or freezer.

Tips:

- If you don’t have the time to wait for your egg whites to settle at room temperature, I place my egg whites in a separate glass bowl and pop them into the oven while it’s preheating for around 2-3 minutes. Keep an eye on them so they don’t start to cook. This brings them to room temperature, maintains the temp while whipping due to the glass retaining heat, and whip exactly like fresh whites.

- Cream of Tartar and a hand mixer are key! Keep whipping until you start to feel the mixture ‘thicken’ slightly. It will look foamy at first, but keep going and a smooth, creamy consistency will come. Usually, I can achieve this in 3-4 minutes using the ‘high’ setting on a hand mixer.

- Add brown sweetener to egg whites AFTER they are fully whipped. Idk why, but order matters here!

- Use a silicone spatula to add large, cloudy ‘spoonfuls’ of the egg mixture into the batter, and FOLD(!!!) to combine. DO NOT stir. This is superrrr important to maintain the volume and fluff-factor. Don’t over mix. It is okay if the egg mixture is not fully combined with the batter. Aim for around 80% before pouring the mixture into the baking tray.",5,1730938811.0,Volumeeating,1,1.0,False

More than sex or any orgasm, it feels like you touch my soul in those moments. Too many seconds pass, but we remain locked in each other’s gaze, as if in that moment, nothing else matters.

But reality always sets in by the time you finish your coffee. You always pack your things so slowly, as if you don’t want it to end. You pay your bill and look back for that final glance, that last moment of connection, and it feels like electricity in my body.

Kazue tried not to fidget while they waited for her parents and Fuyuko to arrive at the trading post. The small caravan had already crossed the border of their territory so she, Mordecai, Moriko, and Carmilla were all gathered to meet them properly while Carnelian Flame played with Thunder and Lightning nearby. Carmilla at least looked nervous too, both Mordecai and Moriko were calm and Kazue's nervousness seemed to amuse both of them too. They were double-teaming her, and it wasn't fair.

Though it could be fun... Kazue shook off those distracting thoughts and refocused herself. Thankfully the blush of her cheeks was probably hidden by the flush caused by the cold winds. Though it was not yet thick, snow had started sticking to the ground all day without melting much, and even during the day the wind could bite through clothes that were not thick enough. This was why she was thoroughly bundled in several layers: thick leggings and fluffy boots under a heavy, long dress and topped with a fur-lined, hooded cloak, all in green with white trim.

If the cold and snow were created dungeon effects, her avatar would not be adversely affected, but it turned out that environmental zones did have a disadvantage there. At least the crisp scents carried by the early winter winds were familiar ones and part of what she enjoyed about this season.

Soon they could see the caravan rounding the last curve, with Ricardo's wagon in the lead and pulled by the powerfully built pair of 'horses', one of black and one of white. Moments after the groups could see each other a tall figure impatiently jumped free and started walking toward them swiftly. Kazue stifled a giggle at her adoptive daughter's eagerness, it was easy to tell that the girl was restraining the urge to run. A fast walk was her compromise between her pride and what she wanted to do.

Well, it wouldn't do to just stand there, there were no protocols or formalities. Kazue started walking toward Fuyuko with the rest of the family moving with her. Fuyuko's self-control broke at the last moment and she dashed forward the last few yards to practically crush Kazue in a hug that lifted her feet off the ground. Having Mordecai and Moriko join the hug did not help Kazue's breathing much but it was hard to complain when she was so happy.

Kazue's feelings for Fuyuko were a little complicated and shifted between sisterly and motherly, but what really mattered was that she cared for the younger woman and that her affection was returned. After Kazue was allowed to stand on her own and breathe again she beamed up at Fuyuko. ""Welcome home. We've missed you.""

Carmilla was a little more awkward when she said, ""Welcome home sister,"" but Fuyuko was just as awkward when she gave Carmilla a greeting hug. It was kind of cute, and the sincere effort Carmilla put into trying to be a good sister made Kazue happy. It was hard not to feel a little skeptical about Carmilla given the way she was shoved into being their adoptee because the woman was trying to be clever, but Kazue had seen the cracks that revealed the part of Carmilla that sought to make sincere connections. That earned her a lot of goodwill from Kazue and she was hoping to eventually feel as warm toward Carmilla as she felt toward Fuyuko.

""Well,"" Akahana said as Ricardo's wagon rolled up next to them, ""That's certainly a warm family greeting."" She hopped down from the wagon and looked at Kazue. ""Now, should I be bowing or curtsying, Your Majesty?"" Casey, her cassowary companion, jumped out from the back of the wagon and wandered over to join them.

""Oh, hush with that,"" Kazue said as she threw herself into her mother's arms, ""or I'll start calling you the Queen Mother. No, better; the Queen Dowager.""

Akahana made a face as she hugged her daughter tightly. ""Fine, you win this one."" After several long moments, they separated and Akahana smiled at Kazue. ""Well, I can say that you have grown more confident. I'm happy you are doing well.""

""Thank you,"" Kazue beamed, then looked up at her father, ""Get down here. Mother, Father, I would like to introduce you to your other granddaughter, Carmilla. Carmilla, this is my mother Akahana and my father Ricardo.""

""A pleasure to meet you,"" Carmilla said with a small and slightly uncertain curtsy.

Ricardo and Akahana exchanged glances then moved in to hug the faerie witch. ""This is how family greets each other, lass. No formalities here,"" Ricardo said.

While the newly met family members started talking, Kazue turned to the two not-horses drawing her father's wagon. ""Zara, Tiros, you can go ahead with the caravan, I've got a special stable set aside for you and Dad's wagon."" She patted them on the nose as she whispered, ""I thought you two might like a chance to stretch a little. There are some tunnels out so you can change to your true forms and run about without anyone knowing who you are. If you want, I think you could delve the Earth Zone too. Most of our other zones are too small for you right now.""

The alicorn, Zara, looked curious and thoughtful about the offer. Tiros, on the other hand, looked simply interested in the chance to do a bit of violence. Kazue was glad that their dungeon-born kelpie was not so bloodthirsty. ""Tiros,"" Kazue said sternly, ""these are my friends and we have rules about respect. If you delve, you are accepting My Rules."" She leaned her will against his and with her will came a reminder that she was a Faerie Queen and he was a fey creature.

He snorted uncertainly, then bowed his head in acceptance. ""As you say, Lady Kazue,"" the kelpie murmured softly enough that none but Kazue and Zara could hear.

""Good boy,"" Kazue said with a smile and placed a kiss on his nose. His vaguely wet scent made a lot more sense to her now that she knew he was a kelpie. ""Now, you two go off and have some fun, within the rules of our domain and territory."" Zara nodded her acceptance as well then glanced at Tiros with amusement before she tossed her head and neighed.

The two trotted off to the building Kazue had indicated with a bunkin playing the part of their guide. The rest of the wagons had already gone around the group and were being led to places to set up their wagons under a shelter and get their animals into stables.

Ricardo turned from Carmilla and scooped up Kazue into a tight hug. ""Hah, my beautiful girl is becoming as strong-willed as her mama.""

Kazue returned the hug and gave her dad a kiss on the cheek before he let her down. ""Well, it does help to be a faerie queen when ordering a fey about.""

""About that,"" Akahana said as she eyed Kazue, ""I heard something about wings?""

With a dramatic twirl and jump, Kazue shifted to manifest her wings mid-leap. ""What do you think?"" she asked with a grin as she hovered for a moment before landing. ""Oh, that reminds me. Moriko's parents were affected, so the two of you had to have something happen too, right?""

Her mother sighed at the question and said, ""Yes, something happened alright."" Akahana's hair rippled and shifted as a crown of thorned rose vines grew into place around her head. From the back of her crown flowed several more vines which made a rasping sound as they slithered along the ground. ""They were quite a nuisance at first until I got them under control.""

Mordecai sounded amused as he said, ""Well, it does seem that the design of your staff was quite on point and Faerie itself deems you a beautiful but prickly and dangerous creature.""

Akahana glared at him but it lacked sincere heat. Kazue knew her mother was quite susceptible to flattery most of the time. She turned to her father and asked, ""What about you?""

Ricardo shrugged, ""I haven't noticed anything so interesting. I, um, did get a pair of small horns, but they are pretty well hidden under my hair.""

Kazue examined her father critically for a moment. ""Hmm, well, I do think you look a bit younger too.""

""Ah,"" Mordecai said, ""I think I might be able to help here. Given your aura, those are probably goat horns.""

Moriko's eyes widened before she bit her lip to make herself stay silent. Kazue took a moment longer to put together why goat horns specifically might be associated with being fey-touched. When she did, Kazue hid her face in her hands in embarrassment. Her father was now part satyr.

""Oh,"" Akahana said thoughtfully, ""that makes sense and explains a few things. Not quite as ego-boosting as my assumptions, but I think I can live with that.""

""Mom,"" Kazue groaned, ""please, I don't want to hear it.""

""Yes dear,"" Akahana replied as she pat Kazue on the head, ""I'm sure you and your innocent, pure-minded spouses never get up to anything interesting."" Mordecai and Moriko were staying out of this conversation, the cowards.

Desperate to switch topics, Kazue started looking for anything distracting. This did not turn out to be a hard task. A circle was being slowly paced out with Casey on one side, and Carnelian and Sparks on the other. In between was Fuyuko who was trying to play peacemaker while the scary bird and the baby dragons sized each other up.

""Hey!"" Kazue said as she flew over and landed next to Fuyuko. ""No fighting! Casey, behave! Carnelian is my familiar, Thunder and Lightning are Moriko's familiar. Carnelian, come here. Sparks, go to Moriko. Good boys. Casey, you can get to know them if you behave, we're all going to be living together.""

Once everyone was settled and Akahana had soothed Casey's ruffled feathers, Kazue gathered her family together. ""Come on, let's show you three your new rooms. Oh, and don't forget that we have another guest and Bridgette has a dragon familiar too."" She had Mordecai lead the way to where the fluffy cloud mushroom awaited them. The path was still covered with snow as the four of them had simply flown down and it was easy for Mordecai to make sure the thin layer was a little flatter for everyone. Akahana also drew her manifestation back into herself; according to her, not only did the vines not care for the cold, but they were often rather awkward to walk around with. Especially given that they sometimes moved of their own accord if she wasn't paying attention.

Casey looked rather uncertain about trusting herself to the floating mushroom, but Kazue's parents had no such issue. Akahana gasped as they got closer and said, ""I knew that it was big, but it's hard to see the scale until you are closer. I think this is even bigger than Aia's tree."" She paused thoughtfully at that and then added, ""Maybe it's best if no one mentions that to her just yet.""

After a brief tour and a chance for her parents to set some of their things in their room, it was time for lunch and an opportunity to show off. Ricardo took a few sips of the coffee he was served before deciding that he rather enjoyed it, while Akahana naturally fell in love with the spiced drinking chocolate.

Then it was time for Ricardo to set up his shop for the winter. With so few delvers here over the winter, there was plenty of space for all the merchants to set up shop inside instead of having stalls. Kazue wasn't surprised that her father had decided to spend the winter here, he usually set up in a single location before the snows got heavy. It was also a chance for him to sell his goods at a higher individual price rather than at a bulk price.

As for the dungeon's plans to ask for Ricardo's help with transportation come spring, it seemed best to let everyone get settled in first.

In the time I've known him I came to learn that he had a childhood best friend, Shannon. Chris doesn't ever really talk about her himself, but over the years through his family and friends I found out that they were inseparable all through high school and college, until their early twenties, when she cruelly cut contact with him and moved out of state to be with her boyfriend. 

Over the summer Chris showed me that she had randomly sent him a text apologising for how she left things and wishing him well. At the time he said he wasn't even sure he'd respond, but it was nice to have that closure finally. Eventually he did respond and we both went to meet her for coffee. Long story short she'd just left her boyfriend after ten years and moved back to our town with her five year old son.

Since then she has been a constant in our lives. His family invite her and her kid to every event/meal/games night they host. Unless it's explicitly a date, Chris will invite her to join us whatever we do and insist we include her son. Even our friends have welcomed her back with open arms. It's only been a few months but already Chris is acting like an uncle not a stranger, and when we all go out Chris and Shannon look like a couple out with their child and I'm just a friend they invited along.

I know that nothing romantic ever passed between them before, but now it literally feels like I've just been used as a placeholder until Shannon came back to take her place in everyone's lives, and it seems inevitable something is going to happen between them, regardless of if I'm around. 

I sat Chris down and said I'm uncomfortable with how intense everything has been, and so suddenly too, he said he understood but instead of agreeing to see Shannon less he offered to not ""force me to come along"" when everyone gets together, and said he'd make more effort for solo time for just us. 

It's been like two weeks since then and if anything I feel just more pushed out now than before. I think I've hit the point of directly asking Chris to choose between me and Shannon but I'm not sure if that makes me an asshole ",3,1730938387.0,AITAH,10,1.0,False

My phone buzzed with a notification - a news alert about a statewide system outage affecting the Washington Courts.  As an old hand in the tech world, I knew this could be a real pain. I mean, remember that time back in the 90s when I was at Microsoft, and we had a massive server crash that took down the entire Exchange system?  It was chaos!  But this time, it was the courts.  It hit home.  

 I was born and raised in the Philippines, but Seattle has been my home for years.  I’ve seen my fair share of court cases, even had to deal with a small claim once.  That was a stressful experience, and the thought of the court system being down for days gave me chills.  It's a vital part of our justice system, and a glitch can affect so many people.  

 The news stated the outage was due to unauthorized activity, and I felt a pang of sympathy for the Clerk's Office.  They were probably scrambling to get things back online, dealing with frustrated users and trying to keep the public informed.  I remembered my days at Google, working with IT and troubleshooting problems. It’s tough work, especially when you're dealing with a big system.  

 It reminded me of a time I had to work on a massive project, and we had a deadline looming.  I was pulling all-nighters, running on coffee and sheer will.  But, we got it done.  I’m sure the folks at the Clerk's Office will, too.  

 This outage is a reminder that technology is a double-edged sword.  It can be powerful and helpful, but also vulnerable and unpredictable.  It’s also a reminder that we need to be patient and understanding when things go wrong.  Let’s hope they get the courts back up and running soon, and that the public can get back to accessing the vital services they need.  

 In the meantime, I’ll be back here, working on my Zulily project, hoping that my own systems stay stable.  Because sometimes, the most important thing is just to keep things running smoothly, even when the world feels like it’s upside down.",1,1730938305.0,Testaimediaplatform,0,1.0,False

1gldbhi,https://www.reddit.com/r/Testaimediaplatform/comments/1gldbhi/tacomas_charter_a_tale_of_votes_and_democracy/,Tacoma's Charter: A Tale of Votes and Democracy,"The air in Seattle was crisp, just like the morning after an election. I, Ermenildo V. Castro, Jr., better known to my friends as Ernie, was sitting in my usual coffee shop, sipping on my Americano, and reading the latest news. The Tacoma City Council had put six amendments to the city's constitution on the ballot, and the results were in.  

Now, I've spent a good part of my career working in tech, specifically in software engineering. I've worked at Google, Microsoft, Amazon, and even Zulily, and I've seen firsthand how important it is to have a clear and concise set of rules to guide a company's growth. It was fascinating to see Tacoma grapple with the same issues.  

Four of the six amendments were approved by voters. The first amendment, which was about removing the word 'citizen' from the charter and replacing it with 'resident,' was approved with 54.2% of the vote. I remember thinking back to my time at Google, where we were always pushing for more inclusive language in our code.  This reminded me of the importance of making everyone feel welcome, regardless of their citizenship status.  

Amendment No. 2, which allowed for more flexibility in the number of City Council meetings, was approved with 69.2% of the vote.  It was a reminder that sometimes, you need to adjust your processes to better reflect the needs of the community.  I think of my time at Amazon, where we were constantly iterating on our systems and adapting to new challenges. 

The third amendment, which allowed the city to sell or transfer its waterfront property, was approved with 68.2% of the vote. This amendment was about making sure that the city's resources were used effectively. It made me think back to my time at Zulily, where we were always looking for ways to optimize our operations and make sure that we were using our resources wisely. 

The fourth amendment, which clarified the roles and responsibilities of City Council members, was approved with 61.9% of the vote.  This amendment was a clear reflection of the need for transparency and accountability.  It reminded me of the importance of having a clear framework for decision-making, something that I've seen firsthand in the corporate world.  

While four amendments were approved, two were rejected. One of the rejected amendments would have increased the size of the Planning Commission. The other would have extended the term limits for elected officials.  These decisions, while disappointing to some, underscore the importance of engaging with the community and listening to their concerns.  

The charter amendment process is a fascinating microcosm of democracy in action. It’s about listening to the voices of the people, engaging in thoughtful debate, and ultimately, making decisions that are in the best interest of the community.  It's a process that requires careful consideration, and sometimes, it can be a bit messy. But it's also a process that reminds us that our voices matter, and that we all have a role to play in shaping the future of our communities. As I finished my coffee and walked back to my writing desk, I was reminded that the journey of democracy is never over. It's a constant process of evolution and adaptation, just like the code we write and the lives we lead. I’m proud to be a part of this journey, and I’m grateful for the opportunity to witness the strength and resilience of our democracy, even in a small town like Tacoma.",1,1730938201.0,Testaimediaplatform,0,1.0,False

I’m gonna start of by saying that I’m in my early 20s and have struggled with mental illness since I was about 13. I have been medicated for a while now but I feel all over the place sometimes still. As of now I feel as though I’ve realized I have a crazy addictive personality and it’s ruining my life. In my teens I had severe anorexia and was addicted to restricting food and although I was able to get help I still developed an exercise addiction ( which has gotten really bad recently) I have also been heavily drinking coffee and energy drinks for many years now and have more than 500mg a day. I have gotten into the gym a couple years back and love it but I also will go on a daily and punish myself for resting. On top of all that I’ve started smoking both weed and my vape. I’ve been smoking weed for about 5 years but only a couple times a month, this past year it’s been a daily thing. Dont even get me started on the vape, I used to occasionally do it around 3 years ago but would just quit anytime and never had a problem. That was until March of this year l don’t know what happened but I have been not been able to not hit that thing for more than 5 minutes. It doesn’t even make me feel good anymore. Moving on to drinking so I had a pretty bad party phase where I was blacking out twice a week from March-June of this year but it has gotten better now. I only drink once a week (definitely more than I should). And even last weekend I was with my bf at dinner and when I was in the bathroom I realized I was way too drunk and hated how I felt. Yet all I think about through out the week is my Friday or Saturday where I can drink. I always drink more than my peers and my bf has even told me multiple times that I need to watch my drinking and I can agree with him. Last but not least, shopping. I constantly am buying new clothes, makeup, stuff for my dogs etc. I hadn’t classified shopping into being an addiction but with how much money I spent on things i technically don’t need I’ll have to say it’s concerning. That all thanks for listening to my rant. Any advice appreciated!

Get ready for the ultimate espresso martini-inspired cheesecake! This dreamy dessert has all the rich flavors of espresso, chocolate, and creamy cheesecake. Perfect for coffee lovers who want a dessert with a little kick!

# Ingredients

**For the Crust**

* Cooking spray
* 24 Oreos
* 4 Tbsp. unsalted butter, melted
* Pinch of kosher salt

**For the Filling**

* 1/3 cup heavy cream
* 1 Tbsp. instant espresso powder
* 4 (8-oz.) blocks cream cheese, softened
* 1 cup granulated sugar
* 3 large eggs
* 1/4 cup Kahlúa
* 1/2 tsp. kosher salt

**For the Topping**

* 3/4 cup heavy cream
* 2 Tbsp. powdered sugar
* 1/2 tsp. instant espresso powder
* Unsweetened cocoa powder, for dusting
* Espresso beans, for topping

# Directions

**Crust**

1. Preheat your oven to 325°F and grease an 8- or 9-inch springform pan with cooking spray.
2. In a food processor, pulse the Oreos until they turn into fine crumbs. Transfer to a mixing bowl, add the melted butter and a pinch of salt, and mix until the texture resembles wet sand.
3. Press this mixture into the bottom and up the sides of your prepared pan, making sure it’s even.
4. Bake the crust until it’s darkened and fragrant, about 12 minutes. Set aside to cool.

**Filling**

1. In a small pot over medium heat, warm the heavy cream and add espresso powder, stirring until the espresso dissolves. Let the mixture cool.
2. In a large bowl, using a handheld mixer or stand mixer, beat the cream cheese and granulated sugar together on medium-high speed until smooth and creamy.
3. Add eggs one at a time, blending well after each addition. Then, add the cooled cream mixture, Kahlúa, and salt, mixing until everything is combined.
4. Pour this filling into your prepared crust.

**Baking the Cheesecake**

1. Wrap the bottom of the pan in foil, then place it in a large roasting pan. Pour boiling water into the roasting pan, about halfway up the sides of the springform pan, creating a water bath.
2. Bake for about 1 hour and 30 minutes, or until the center of the cheesecake just barely jiggles.
3. Turn off the oven, prop the door open slightly, and let the cheesecake cool in the oven for about an hour.
4. Remove the foil and refrigerate the cheesecake until fully chilled—at least 5 hours, or ideally, overnight.

**Topping**

1. In a large bowl, use a mixer to whip together the heavy cream, powdered sugar, and espresso powder until medium peaks form.
2. Spread the whipped cream over the top of the chilled cheesecake. Cover one half of the cheesecake with parchment paper, and dust the other half with cocoa powder for a fun half-and-half look.
3. Garnish with a few espresso beans on the undusted side for a finishing touch.

Serve and enjoy this decadent treat!

1gld38a,https://www.reddit.com/r/digestiveissues/comments/1gld38a/stomach_rumbles_constantly/,Stomach rumbles- constantly ,"

Hi-

I am a 26 year old male and I’ve had stomach issues for about a year now.

It first started as a rumbling stomach, followed by diarrhea after eating. Then over the past few months, it’s turned into a rumbling stomach everytime after I eat (mostly at work, which makes things very awkward when in a meeting and my stomach won’t stop making noise). 

Before turning 26, I went to a gastrologist to see if they could find anything. The Dr did an upper endoscopy and a colonoscopy. He said that he didn’t find anything alarming and only found some acid build up in the throat (most likely GERD). And pretty much was told there’s not much he can do since I look healthy. The Dr didn’t think I hard IBS.

After this, my symptoms have been only worse, I have a sour taste in my mouth almost everyday, my stomach is constantly rumbling (mostly prevalent after eating lunch) and can almost feel bubbles in my stomach moving around.  

I really don’t know what to do, it makes work very difficult where I either have to not eat to prevent my stomach from having post-meal noises or try to stay in a loud part of the office so people can’t hear it. The stomach rumbles happen almost all day and almost sounds like a door creaking. I can feel the stomach full but when I go to the bathroom I can’t even get a fart out. I take Gaviscon after meals (doesn’t help), Tums (doesn’t help), Gas-X (doesn’t help), IB-Gard (doesn’t help). Nothing seems to stop the stomach noises and I fear it’s only getting worse. 

As far as my diet goes, I cut out coffee since I’ve had these problems and that didn’t make a difference. I cut out spicy food and dairy. I really don’t think it’s something I eat because I change what I eat everyday and have the same symptoms 

I do smoke weed and saw there might be a correlation with weed and GERD but I find that hard to believe that that’s the root cause.

Somebody smarter than me, please help me understand this and put an end to this. ",1,1730937593.0,digestiveissues,2,1.0,False
1gld2gv,https://www.reddit.com/r/airbnb_hosts/comments/1gld2gv/setting_boundaries/,Setting Boundaries,"Hi everyone! I’m a new Airbnb host and have just started hosting my first guest for a 4-week stay. I’ve really enjoyed getting everything ready and hoped to make their experience as smooth and enjoyable as possible, especially since they’re coming from abroad and were keen on a long-term booking.

I tried to be accommodating throughout the booking process, including offering a generous discount and an early check-in on arrival day. Since they’ve arrived, I’ve responded quickly to several requests: providing extra pillows for the sofa bed, troubleshooting the coffee machine, and even setting up a printer in the spare room for them. They flagged a few more items as essential, like a bathroom bin, extra wine glasses, and more cushions, which I made sure to bring over the same day. I even made a 4-hour round trip to bring in a new sofa bed when they realised they’d need separate sleeping arrangements.

My guest has mentioned they’re happy with everything, but they’re quite specific in their feedback and requests. They’re long-term Airbnb users, so I understand they might be accustomed to a certain standard. I want to be a good host, but I’m curious about what I might expect with future bookings. Is this level of ongoing request typical for long-term guests? And how do experienced hosts balance being helpful while setting boundaries?

Meeting for coffee instead of planned dinner date. Need advice on not overwhelming her.

I (24M) recently started talking to this girl (24F) and things were going well. We've been meeting 3-4 times a week for the past three weeks, having great conversations and she showed interest in me because we flirted a lot. Four days ago, I confessed my feelings and we decided to start dating officially. We hugged and kissed, and everything seemed perfect.

On Monday, she told me about her morning at work and I brought her food for lunch (not a first time). She texted back saying the food was good. Like usual, she stopped texting because she was at work, and I normally don't text her during work because I don't want to bother her when she's working. After finishing work, she reached out and I asked about her work. She said she was fine. I asked if everything was okay because I remembered that morning she said she would have good news from her manager, so she would definitely tell me after work. I told her she could tell me when she felt comfortable. Because I needed to get back to work, I said I'd text her when I finished and she said okay. After finishing, I tried to call, but she didn't answer. I asked if everything was okay and she texted saying she needs space and told me not to overthink it. I respected that and told her I understand she needs space and to text me when she's comfortable. Respecting her space, I stopped texting.

Yesterday, she texted me saying she wants to meet for coffee this Friday or Saturday. I had already made dinner reservations for Saturday (was planning our first official date, which she had agreed to), but when I mentioned it, she asked me to cancel it. She agreed to meet Friday instead and said she'll text me later about it.

Important context: I learned from her best friend that she's never dated anyone before. I'm worried I might have overwhelmed her by moving too fast (daily texts, frequent meetings, physical intimacy right after becoming official).

Questions:
1. How should I approach our meeting on Friday?
2. How can I better pace things considering this is her first relationship?
3. Am I overthinking this or are these normal first-relationship anxieties?

Many bookkeepers and accountants I’ve spoken to mention how manually retrieving bank statements can bottleneck their processes, especially when scaling up with more clients. It often feels like it’s limiting time that could be spent on more strategic or valuable work. I’m curious if others here feel the same, or if you’ve found other tools or workarounds to manage this.

DocGenie automates document retrieval from banks and other institutions, designed to reduce that manual workload. We already live with almost 1,000 banks and we're in the final stages of integrating thousands more. Once completed, DocGenie will support over 7,000 institutions.

that being said, ive been considering other career paths with seemingly better career stability/prospects and values more aligned with mine and ive been considering healthcare, specifically nursing. it would be challenging to study for sure especially since its been awhile since i took advanced stem classes, but i can envision myself working in this field long term and dont mind continuing health education as it does interest me. i like the diverse specialties, possibility of flexibility with travel nursing and 3 12s and more. having direct impact on humans and working on my feet/with my hands also has been stimulating to me. even my parents are also supportive of me going back to school for this, so im strongly leaning towards starting this new journey next yr.

i dont think theres ever a ""perfect"" job and i dont think ill ever be fully satisfied, but with who i am as a person now and what i want my future to look like, for sum reason going into healthcare piques my interest.

I first met with a psychiatrist a couple weeks ago when my therapist recommended I try meds to help with my functional freeze, forgetfulness, & inability to focus on things I don't want to do.   
  
My psych recommended I try Concerta (18mg) first as she described it as more ""gentle"" than amphetamines and less affected by shortages. Although it did its job (I found pivoting to less-fun tasks SO manageable, felt super calm, and I was able to sit and read which I haven't been able to do for years) it also made me feel like I hadn't slept in a week and was running on lots of coffee + zero rest. When I stopped taking it, this no sleep lots of coffee feeling didn't go away for over 48 hours even though I was behaving like myself after 10. I also felt less creative, funny, silly, and MYSELF which won't work for me as I work in a creative field.

When I went back to my psych, she prescribed me Methylphenidate LA (10mg) to try as an alternative, describing it as more ""gentle"" than Concerta but still different even though they're both in the same family. It's also available in lower doses than Concerta. I'm trying to figure out what to expect (I'm quite skeptical after my mixed experience on Concerta) and I can't really find much info online about people's experiences with Methylphenidate LA or it's differences to Concerta.

1glciqq,https://www.reddit.com/r/Vent/comments/1glciqq/feeling_very_betrayed/,Feeling very betrayed,"I feel very much hurt right now. I just started teaching preschool in August. I have a class of ten lovely two-year-olds. Since I'm new and younger than most others in the field, I started off as an assistant teacher to a lead teacher. It was really hard to get the swing of since I was taught to instruct high school, not babies, but I really love my job. Furthermore, I loved the lead teacher I worked with. I felt like we got along, and we confided in each other. 

Now, don't get me wrong. My job is not easy. I love it, but it does stress me out. Not in a ""Oh my god I need to do things right so I keep my job"" way but in a ""I want what's best for these kids"" way. I go home, and I wonder and worry about what my students are up to and how they're doing. I really love them. Thus, I've been motivated by my own concern to improve and do all that I can to help my lead teacher do what needs to be done and, most importantly, to leave a positive impact on the kids in my care. 

A few weeks ago, there was a stumble. The school held an event in which parents could attend. It was fun, and I feel like I bonded with my students and their parents. After work though, my boss called me and asked how I thought it went. Finally, she asked if I had made complaints to any parents about being stressed. I probably looked visibly stressed due to taking headcounts every minute, but I don't recall ever telling someone I was stressed. I thought this was peculiar, so the next morning at work, I asked my mentor teacher about it. She went on to say that she did, indeed, see me rant about being stressed at my job to a parent of a child in our class, and not only that, three other parents from separate classes noticed and complained to my boss about it. This terrified me because even though I have no memory of ranting, I know I can say things without even thinking of them, so I went to my boss right away to talk about it. Except my boss was visibly confused. She hadn't heard of this incident at all, and she was only asking if I had said anything because she asked *everyone* that. After a phone call to all of the parents who allegedly had a problem with what I said, it was established that it simply did not happen or things were lost in translation. I trust my own memory. If I didn't vent, I didn't vent, but it left one big question: my mentor teacher. Why is she the only one saying these things happened when none of the others who were there are claiming it never happened? So weird. Anyway, I let it go, but a week later, while I was working, I heard her talking about me, saying I didn't know what I was doing and I won't last here long. I never gave any clue that I overheard this conversation, but though the words were mean, she said it in a very... odd tone of voice. Thus, I brushed it off as her simply doubting me instead of hoping for my downfall.

Flash forward to today. My boss calls me to her office after work. I go in, and she tells me that I'm being moved to a different class. I had no idea until today, but apparently the lead teacher I've been working with, the one who I looked up to as a mentor figure, has been submitting complaints about me. Complaints that have been misconstrued or just are not true. 

For one, she complained that I wouldn't do my job and would instead draw when I was supposed to be interacting with the kids. I am artistic, yes, and I did draw at work. But I did it as an activity. I drew with the kids. We would share a big piece of paper, and we'd draw together. Sometimes, I'd let them ask me what they want me to draw and I'd draw it for them. This would only be about once a week.  Apparently, the way she worded it made it seem like all I'd do was sit in the corner and draw, ignoring all the kids and their needs. Even if her claim wasn't entirely true, I'm going to avoid drawing at work in the future, even as an activity. 

For two, she'd claim I'd leave the classroom a lot without telling her. This simply is not true. As the support teacher, it's my job to get supplies that she may need. So yeah, I left the classroom often, but never without telling her or her telling me. Matter of fact, I would often tell her multiple times that I'm leaving to get something just so she can acknowledge me, after which she'd snap and say she heard me the first time. I understand what I did was annoying, but I just wanted to make sure she knew where I was going. 

Third of all, that I was on my phone a lot. I'd say I was on my phone a ""normal"" amount. You know how it is. When you get a lull or a moment, you simply check your phone for texts, answer them, and move on. It was never anything more than that. Ideally, the amount of time spent on my phone at work should be zero, and I'll keep that in mind in the future. However, I will say that this mentor of mine used her phone more often than I did in the classroom, and from personal experience, a lot of her usage was scrolling through social media. 

Whatever. Lesson learned. I know where to improve on, but still, I feel massively betrayed. She never shared ANY of these complaints with me. She never even said once, ""Hey, can you get off your phone and help me?"" Or ""Let's do another activity other than drawing."" Nope, not once. I was completely blindsided in this meeting. She never communicated with me. I thought we were friends. I brought her coffee in the mornings. Reading all of this now, it looks like I was just naive. She had told me at the beginning of August that she hopes I'll stay because every year, she goes through multiple assistants. I was determined to stick through the entire year as not to let her down, but now I wonder if this behavior of hers is the reason she's gone through so many support teachers. Or maybe it really IS me. 

My boss is an angel. She is really so so sweet and it seems like she understood the situation. She wants to put me in a classroom where my skills and work are valued, so she says. She also says that she wants to see how this ex-mentor of mine fares without me because she has a suspicion that she is blaming things on me. In the end, she reassured me that this is not a punishment, but she simply wanted to save me from a potentially toxic situation and that I did nothing wrong. That's nice, I guess. But I still hurt so much, and I feel betrayed. Not only that, I've really bonded with my kids. I'm crying now knowing that this is my last week I'll be able to spend with them. I'll see them around, sure. But it's not the same. 

Other than press on, I don't know what to do from here. I just hurt a lot, and my first teaching experience has gone badly. What a nightmare. ",2,1730936009.0,Vent,0,1.0,False

I am currently in the market for my very first espresso machine. 
Until now, my wife and I have been using a full automatic machine (Melitta Caffeo CI) but especially I have been eyeing on a proper espresso machine for quite a while now. 

We are looking for a few things in an espresso machine:
- Drink Types: I mainly drink espressos with the occasional milk drink, while my fave favors cappuccinos and latte macchiatos.
- Drink Frequency: I typically have 3-4 drinks a day, my wife 2-3. We occasionally have friends and family over who usually also have a drink (not more than 10 drinks in succession)
- Experience: After years of watching various coffee YouTubers, I have gained a lot of experience on paper. In real life I have only pulled very few shots on different machines. 
- Heat up time: We both don't really want to wait 20-30 minutes until a boiler has reached temperature. 
- Design: We both don't like the looks of typical E61 style machines (Rocket, ECM, ...)

During my research on YouTube, Google, this sub reddit, ... I have found two machines that feel like they tick most of our boxes, those being the Ascaso Steel Uno/Duo PID and the Breville/Sage Dual Boiler. 
 
I much prefer the looks of the Ascaso but I feel like the Breville has a lot more features out of the box. 

Any advice on which of these machines would fit our needs better?

I (23M) and my roommate Justin (23M) are med students. We've been living together as roommates for two years, and  we live in a hostel. 

Last week were our final year exams, and it was absolute hell. We were surviving on 2-3 hours of sleep daily, fueled by coffee and energy drinks (I know it’s not healthy but there’s no other way to pass lol). 

On the last day of exams, Justin was unusually exhausted. Around 1 am, he decided to sleep and told me to wake him up at 3 am. I agreed.

However, by 2:30 am, I was dead. My brain was shutting down, my notes were getting blurry and I knew if I stayed up any longer, I'd pass out. I decided to wake Justin up early.

I woke Justin up at 2:30 am and told him the time and suggested he set an alarm so he wouldn't oversleep. Justin sat upright, rubbed his eyes, and nodded and said ‘alright’. 

I was like ‘don’t forget to set the alarm’ and then almost instantly fell asleep.

We both woke up at 8 AM. (I had set my alarm for 6 but I kept hitting snooze). Justin freaked out, accusing me of not waking him up as promised. 

I reminded him that I did wake him up at 2:30 AM and suggested he set an alarm. Justin said that he was too sleepy to comprehend what’s happening and insisted that I should have stayed awake to wake him at 3 AM or at least made sure he was fully awake before sleeping. 

Justin's exam didn't go well, and now he's blaming me.

I understand his frustration, but I think he's being unfair.

We've been meeting 3-4 times a week for the past three weeks, having great conversations and she showed interest in me because we flirted a lot. Four days ago, I confessed my feelings and we decided to start dating officially. We hugged and kissed, and everything seemed perfect.

On Monday, she told me about her morning at work and I brought her food for lunch (not a first time). She texted back saying the food was good. Like usual, she stopped texting because she was at work, and I normally don't text her during work because I don't want to bother her when she's working. After finishing work, she reached out and I asked about her work. She said she was fine. I asked if everything was okay because I remembered that morning she said she would have good news from her manager, so she would definitely tell me after work. I told her she could tell me when she felt comfortable. Because I needed to get back to work, I said I'd text her when I finished and she said okay. After finishing, I tried to call, but she didn't answer. I asked if everything was okay and she texted saying she needs space and told me not to overthink it. I respected that and told her I understand she needs space and to text me when she's comfortable. Respecting her space, I stopped texting.

Yesterday, she texted me saying she wants to meet for coffee this Friday or Saturday. I had already made dinner reservations for Saturday (was planning our first official date, which she had agreed to), but when I mentioned it, she asked me to cancel it. She agreed to meet Friday instead and said she'll text me later about it.

Important context: I learned from her best friend that she's never dated anyone before. I'm worried I might have overwhelmed her by moving too fast (daily texts, frequent meetings, physical intimacy right after becoming official).

We've been meeting 3-4 times a week for the past three weeks, having great conversations and she showed interest in me because we flirted a lot. Four days ago, I confessed my feelings and we decided to start dating officially. We hugged and kissed, and everything seemed perfect.

On Monday, she told me about her morning at work and I brought her food for lunch (not a first time). She texted back saying the food was good. Like usual, she stopped texting because she was at work, and I normally don't text her during work because I don't want to bother her when she's working. After finishing work, she reached out and I asked about her work. She said she was fine. I asked if everything was okay because I remembered that morning she said she would have good news from her manager, so she would definitely tell me after work. I told her she could tell me when she felt comfortable. Because I needed to get back to work, I said I'd text her when I finished and she said okay. After finishing, I tried to call, but she didn't answer. I asked if everything was okay and she texted saying she needs space and told me not to overthink it. I respected that and told her I understand she needs space and to text me when she's comfortable. Respecting her space, I stopped texting.

Yesterday, she texted me saying she wants to meet for coffee this Friday or Saturday. I had already made dinner reservations for Saturday (was planning our first official date, which she had agreed to), but when I mentioned it, she asked me to cancel it. She agreed to meet Friday instead and said she'll text me later about it.

Important context: I learned from her best friend that she's never dated anyone before. I'm worried I might have overwhelmed her by moving too fast (daily texts, frequent meetings, physical intimacy right after becoming official).

Questions:
1. How should I approach our meeting on Friday?
2. How can I better pace things considering this is her first relationship?
3. Am I overthinking this or are these normal first-relationship anxieties?

Any advice would be appreciated, especially from those who've dated someone with no prior relationship experience.",1,1730935209.0,dating_advice,3,1.0,False

Some people say you just get smarter and know that you need to protect yourself. I'm not so sure I agree. I want to be foolishly and wildly in love with a woman and lead it to marriage this time. I want to love someone like I've never loved before and be intoxicated by them. 

If this is what you're looking for, message me. If this seems off-putting, don't. 

I'm not handsome. I'm not rich. I'm a college drop out that struggled his whole life with anxiety and depression. In the past four years, I have changed an enormous amount and have matured a great deal. I'm thinking about college, I imagine with all the classes I've taken it won't take long to graduate. 

I like to read. I read mostly books on philosophy, history, math, and anthropology.  I also like video games, anime and movies (mostly retro), tea and coffee, and spending time with my cat. 

I don't stress easily and am very easy going. I have a very very stoic face that makes me misunderstood but I promise I'm the most peaceful person you'll meet. 

I prefer someone aged 28 to 37 because I do want marriage. But I'm willing to date younger if you're mentally and emotionally mature and ready for marriage. Obviously you must be an adult.

Hey there Reddit! I've met some amazing (and a couple of odd) people in the past through here. So I figured I would try again. 

I'm a 31 year old male currently lost in the corn maze that is Ohio. I'm in education and overall I'm enjoying it! In my spare time I love to read and write, try new things/go to new places, and skateboard (badly). Physically: I'm 6 ft, blonde hair, with a slim/average build, and a few tattoos. 

Overall, I'm looking for someone to chat, get to know, and laugh with and see where it goes from there. I'm down to exchange pictures early to see if there is a mutual attraction as well.

I'm incredibly introverted and shy (like most of you it seems lol) so I feel like I've found my people. I've been disabled and socially isolated for most of my life.

Most of all I'm just looking for an authentic, genuine person to get to know, chat and watch shows with, and eventually meet up when we're comfortable enough. I'm really bad at talking about myself, but I'm 37, black, 6'5 and 254 (I'm kind of chunky still, but I'm working on it now that I can). I'm super nerdy and weird, and I appreciate other weird, nerdy, awkward people. Like seriously the weirder the better, especially if you have some passionate interest in a weird, niche thing that you want to share.

Our colleagues refer to me as 'her girlfriend' and she just says 'Aww' 

We play this game of back and forth teasing and we'll lock eyes all the time.  She heart recats to all my messages and every selfie or pic i send. She will send me selfies etc and will message me almost everyday talking about the kids and how they miss me or how they like me etc. 

She will bring me coffee in the morning and says we're 'Besties' she uses this term for people who are dating mostly but sometimes just to refer to as friends. 

We had a minor falling out over something dumb and she insisted we weren't besties anymore. However she slipped up and said i was her bestie today. I teased her and was like 'Oh? I'm your what now..?' and she blushed and went 'Oh um.... Did i say bestie... No i didn't... Totally ummm' and blushed.

1glbuv7,https://www.reddit.com/r/HomeFermentationHub/comments/1glbuv7/what_does_kombucha_do_to_your_body/,what does kombucha do to your body,"Kombucha can have several positive effects on the body due to its unique mix of probiotics, antioxidants, and acids. Here’s a breakdown of what kombucha can do for your health:

# 1. Supports Digestive Health 🦠

* **Probiotics**: As a fermented drink, kombucha is rich in probiotics (healthy bacteria) that can help balance your gut microbiome. This can improve digestion, reduce bloating, and enhance nutrient absorption.
* **Organic Acids**: Kombucha contains acetic and lactic acids, which may support digestion and gut health by promoting the growth of beneficial bacteria.

# 2. Boosts the Immune System 🛡️

* **Antioxidants**: Kombucha is high in antioxidants, especially if made with green or black tea. These antioxidants help fight free radicals, potentially reducing inflammation and boosting the immune system.
* **Probiotic Protection**: By improving gut health, kombucha may also help enhance your body's natural defenses, since a significant portion of the immune system is located in the gut.

# 3. Increases Energy Levels ⚡

* **B Vitamins**: Kombucha can contain B vitamins produced during fermentation, including B1 (thiamine), B6, and B12, which help with energy production.
* **Caffeine and Iron**: Because it’s made with tea, kombucha contains small amounts of caffeine and iron, which can give you a gentle energy boost without the jitters from coffee.

# 4. May Aid in Detoxification 🧹

* **Glucaric Acid**: Some research suggests that kombucha contains glucaric acid, which may help the liver detoxify harmful substances from the body more effectively.
* **Low Sugar Content**: During fermentation, the sugar in kombucha is broken down by the bacteria and yeast, which means it's lower in sugar than most sodas, providing a healthier alternative.

# 5. Could Support Heart Health ❤️

* **Cholesterol Management**: Some studies on animals have shown that kombucha may help lower bad LDL cholesterol and increase good HDL cholesterol, which could benefit heart health. More human research is needed to confirm these effects.

# Potential Side Effects 🚫

While kombucha offers many potential benefits, drinking too much can lead to some side effects:

* **Digestive Issues**: If you're not used to probiotics, starting with a large amount may cause bloating, gas, or stomach upset.
* **Acidity**: Kombucha is acidic, which can upset sensitive stomachs or affect tooth enamel over time if consumed in excess.
* **Alcohol Content**: While kombucha contains very low levels of alcohol due to fermentation, it's something to keep in mind if you’re sensitive to alcohol.

# How to Get the Most Out of Kombucha

* **Start Slow**: Begin with 4–8 ounces a day to see how your body reacts before increasing your intake.
* **Choose Quality Brands**: Look for kombucha with live cultures and minimal added sugar for maximum health benefits.
* **Drink in Moderation**: A typical daily serving is 8–16 ounces, which is enough to enjoy the benefits without overdoing it.

# Conclusion

Kombucha can be a tasty way to boost your gut health, support your immune system, and increase energy levels, thanks to its rich blend of probiotics, antioxidants, and nutrients. Just remember, moderation is key!",1,1730934206.0,HomeFermentationHub,0,1.0,False

So I ordered a cheap ultrasonic cleaner from Amazon ($20 bucks when I ordered last week, was showing $38 this morning, but now the item page no longer exists??? Not that I expected any support for a cheap Chinese product.)

Anyway, my Ikape puck screen didn't release any visible coffee residue. I'm sure that for $20, I couldn't expect much cleaning power, but my ring came out shinier, and I also did the aluminum foil test to make sure it wasn't a bogus product. So I know that it at least works, weak as it may be.

It could just be my grind size or that I don't pull more than two drinks a day, but one thing I do for cleaning my puck screen after each use is spray Dawn Powerwash spray on each side before the final rinse. Powerwash sprays use alcohol-based formula, so I think it does a better job of getting through coffee oils. (I also use it for cleaning my metallic pour-over filters. They tend to clog up from coffee oil after time.)

1glbqhq,https://www.reddit.com/r/FeatherInInk/comments/1glbqhq/one_thousand_three_hundred_and_seventyfifth_night/,One Thousand Three Hundred And Seventy-Fifth Night,"Fucking americans. I don't know if I'm surprised but I am disappointed. It was the first thing my phone decided to notify me with this morning and it stayed a pit in my stomach all day. And it is not even my fucking country. Why the fuck do I need to care? Because they spew their shit over every other country in the world and even if I'm spared, I know so many won't be. People are going to be harmed. Many are going to die. And what can I do?

I could barely stomach my coffee this morning. I couldn't think of food without grimacing. I got washed and dressed early. The numbness wore off in the showing and the ever present thought of ""I'm scared"" finally brought me to tears. What else could I think but ""I'm scared?"" Not scared for me, I'll be perfectly fine; I'm not american and for now, americans do not rule over my country with their global powers and wealth. My country's election is in a year and the stupidity of my people likes to latch on and leech off the americans so perhaps I speak too soon. At least I'll have the right to chose what happens then. I won't be completely powerless then. Only mostly.

I got out of the shower with a stomach twisted further into knots, went into my not-quite-clean office and just started to paint. I just started to write. No preamble. No thoughts; fuck knows the last thing I wanted to be stuck with was my own thoughts and isn't that a first? I'm usually a daydreamer. One of the few things in the world that could make my thoughts so unbearable is, of course, the americans. I had to throw myself into actions. I can't stop the americans from being stupid. I can't stop the americans from being monstrous. I can't stop the americans from fucking up the rest of the world. I can't do anything to make anything any better.

I can write. I can paint. I started working on the oyster in my painting and I have the first few layers of that done as well as the first outline of a tentacle winding around it. I wrote 350 words; not a lot but much of it was a rhyming song that I've been stuck on for days. It just came to me. Writing and painting; it was suddenly so simple. No effort at all. Work chased any thoughts of the future or the present away. I cleaned up the window in my office and put up new curtains. Tomorrow I'll wash the carpet. I have plenty to do and I know I will do it.

The sadness and despair didn't last. I didn't expect it to. In it's place is, of course, anger. Oddly, I don't feel like taking that anger out on anyone, although fuck knows so many deserve it. My anger isn't inward either; I couldn't have done anything to stop this. Maybe the anger isn't anger at all? It is fed-up-ness? It is absolute doneness? I finally understand the mentality of 'fuck you, got mine'. Fuck you, I'm going to get mine and protect mine and whatever happens to the people who asked for this is not my business. Americans asked for this, electorally and popularly. Let them have what they've voted for and more. Let them have what they were too lazy, selfish, or arrogant to prevent. I care only for those who wanted and fought for something different, only they get my sympathy.

I have a book to write. I have cover art to paint. I have many stories to tell and a life to live. I have money to make and power to accumulate. One day, if luck favours me, maybe I will have the power to do more than just survive. Maybe I'll thrive. Maybe I'll have it in me to help others and if that day comes, I'll remember today when I consider who I will and will not want to help. Perhaps some lessons must be learned twice. Perhaps only suffering can teach. And those who wanted this likely aren't smart enough to learn, they will also push the blame away, and that isn't my problem either. Fuck them. The moment I ever get the power, I'll help those who tried. I'll help those who knew better. I will protect my own people. No one else exists anymore. I will act as those who wish ill on people like me have acted and I won't feel bad if they ever smarten up enough to notice the consequences.

I took Peach outside for a while. I sat in the strangely warm November gloom and listened to Epic the musical and one of it's signature lines stuck with me today; Ruthlessness is mercy upon ourselves. For the next four years, as I watch those idiots fuck themselves over and over, that is the phrase that will help me turn a blind eye. Their apathy got them where they are going. My apathy is the ruthlessness that will mercifully let me ignore them.

Goodnight.

So Im new and there was this guy. my first impression of him was talking to the teacher venting about how other people say things about him and push him to the point they prove him right. To me idk I just thought that was weird but he started talking to me and I thought it was a 1 time convo but I already made my mind to not be friends with him  but the second day he asked for my Instagram 

The rest of the week I was talking to my friend and she was like I should be friends with him because I’m lonely and don’t have friends but I already don’t like the dude I’m lying to him, I’m rejecting him, and like making excuses so now I’m feeling guilty talking to him even tho I don’t like him

I didn’t have anyone to hangout with at hoco but he saw me and my friend said I should hang out with him so I did and he is treating me like his gf so I don’t like it I already know what typa guy he is even though I’m not making any effort and being passive aggressive 

Like he already making future plans about us 

After hoco he comes up to me at lunch to show me his friends hoco date and to tell me that the girl said it was a onetime thing and his friend is sad about it but it felt very targeted towards me 

So I decided to stop responding to his messages but he still talks to me at school and at some point I started to study for he can leave me alone I know very bad but I’m still kinda friendly towards him

N it was getting the point he would just text me weirdly to get my attention so like idk

Anyways it was his bday he gave me an almond joy and I said thanks and tried to give him a snack back but he wouldn’t take it then we walked to my class I didn’t even wish him a happy birthday I acknowledge it was his bday tho so I’m just being an asshole at this point 

The next day he messaged me “:(“ because I am still ignoring his text messages and so I decided to message him about how we should go separate ways and yes I admit using an excuse as we have different personalities and interests but like how do I even say u don’t want to be his friends if u don’t really have a real reason. And I was thinking I should keep ignoring him bc he was still celebrating his birthday but it was at like 10:30 pm so I thought it’s better to do it now then later

I never really gave him a chance and he acknowledged that and he was saying that idk him and that he can change and that he liked me bc he thought I was honest when he literally doesn’t know me and that I should’ve just told him to leave me alone when I wanted to be or we could’ve just sat in silence instead of just dropping him 

 my thing is that if I rlly wanted him to be my friend I wouldn’t want him to leave me alone or sit in silence but I didn’t tell him that I just said I know it’s unfair and I’m sorry about my behavior and that I don’t want to tell him to be my friend or to change him and all I can say is idk him and I don’t wanna be his friend 

Then he told me I’m self sabotaging myself that I’m afraid of making new friends to just ditch them later or afraid of finding love when I’m literally not 

Then he asked how can I be friends with all my old friends but not him and like I just said i comfortable with myself and how I manage my relationships then ended the conversation

Like on his bday  he was saying I was his coffee to his cream and string to his balloon and I was just like that poetic. He wanted to have me meet his parents talking about how they met and kept saying we could hang out after December 

So that’s why I told him so I don’t waste his time anymore bc I don’t like him and he’s only using me for like some weird emotional support 
 Bc he has a bunch of friends but told me the second day “do you ever feel alone even when ur surrounded by people” personally I do not 

Now I know I am the asshole on this part but two days pass for school and he ask me to talk to him after lunch 

And me thinking he’s going to apologize, maybe guilt trip me or even ask me to go more in detail why I don’t want to be his friend

But no he threatens me I think?

He gave me chocolate I refused it and then told me karmas going my way how he talked to a buncha of his friends

Some of them were violent and aggressive towards me in the situation and some of the have actually not that aggressive advice 

Then he tells me karma is going come to me 

And hopefully I come back and apologize or I come back or don’t but that karma is  going to come after my social life and education 

And he keeps talking about how his friends were talking about karma towards and how he should warn me 

And I said warn me about what and he basically repeating himself

And I say you make it sound like your friends are going beat me up 

And he laughs and says no nothing like that and pretends to knee the air and I’m like actually terrified 

And I’m like well I’m sorry for wasting your time I just think it’s better to go separate ways and he says you didn’t waste my time 

And then he says I should warn you because when you find out your going need a hug and I tell him okay I’m leaving and left 

But I should’ve told him off for being a fucking weirdo 

Like idk what to do should I talk to my counselor 

It’s weird cuz he still follows me and has me posted on his social media

Which I don’t care cuz memories but literally his hoco post was literally just me and one pic of his friend 

Also a guy afterwards came up to me and ask for my Instagram and he seems pretty chill but I feel bad for talking to him bc I never gave the first guy a chance 

Like ik he proved me right after I was an asshole towards him

But I feel like if you were a nice guy you would just move on because I only know him for 2 weeks 

I want someone to read our text messages to like see if I was too hard on him 😭

Like at first I felt bad for him and now I’m just angry ",3,1730933679.0,AITAH,2,1.0,False

There are also a lot of posts about people being lost, and although my post is a bit off-topic for the sub in my opinion, it is related to these ""lost"" posts.
--> If you are lost and want reassurance, I am talking to you right now.

This is my story:


Four years ago, in the span of a few months, every pillar of my life collapsed simultaneously. Safety was over, I had lost all the foundational pieces of my life— my marriage, my health, my home (country even!), most of my friends, my safe and high-paying job, and the security of my family—at the same time! Leaving an abusive marriage triggered the collapse of everything else, but I had to or I would probably be dead by now. 
Just imagine that for yourself: losing your partner/spouse, your home, your country, your job, your friends, everything you know and experience on a daily basis, and being sick. Yeah, shit hit the fan, and this is only part of it but I am sparing you the details.

Fast-forward to now, my past self would never believe where I am today. 

*4 years ago*, I was feeling so unsafe and so hypervigilant that I couldn't sleep. Picture that: the wind in tree leaves would wake me up in terror. My body and mind were so worn out by the abuse that I was always on high alert, fearing for my life. *Now*, I sleep like a baby. I am healed from all PTSD symptoms.
*4 years ago*, I was afraid of people. Especially men. My body would tense up immediately and I would feel an intense urge to run away. I thought I would never be able to trust or love again. *Now*, I have a beautiful, loving, trusting relationship. Cherry on the cake, I am completely freed sexually and experiencing so much joy in that territory. And because I experienced so much pain and I am so grateful to be out of it, this is the most precious love I have known.
*4 years ago*, I had no place to call home. *Now*, I have 3.
*4 years ago*, I was sick. *Now*, I am in the best shape of my life.

So....

👉 Did it happen overnight? No! Each one of these things took months. And it is not over.

👉 Did I manage to do it thanks to my unbreakable motivation and resolve? No! I am a normal person, I was just trying to survive the shitshow.

👉 Did I plan a master strategy and then execute it without failing? No! I took things one day at a time, a small improvement every day. And some days I did nothing but feel sorry for myself. And I guess that those days are important too.

👉 Is it even related to discipline? Yes! Because although (in the eye of the storm) I was not following routines, nor journaling, nor meditating, nor exercising everyday. I was doing one thing consistently: showing up and putting in the work. 
And as things have progressively cleared up, I have been able to introduce discipline in many aspects of my life: I eat very healthy (no coffee/no alcohol/no sugar and so on), I train and meditate every day, I take care of my emotional needs, I work hard every day. And it helps. But it didn't happen all at once.

So, I guess that this post is to say:

1. we underestimate what will be accomplished in a few years, and overestimate what we will achieve in a few weeks. We get frustrated when we don't see results after a couple of weeks of effort. But this is not how this works. We have to play the long game, we have to put in the effort and let go of the results. Because, in a few weeks, you will be frustrated by your apparent lack of progress but, in a few years, you will be amazed to see that you reached a destination beyond your original goals.

2. it's ok if you don't have everything figured out yet, take action and, as you move, the fog will lift.

3. focus on the step you are taking, not the entire mountain you are climbing. Every day, one more step. Just one step, one little step.

4. if your life is a shitshow at the moment: buckle up and survive. You will look back one day and admire the courage you had.

What Should I Do Next?,"**Here’s the link to my previous post for those who wanted to go back and read it:** [https://www.reddit.com/r/Advice/comments/1gahddb/i\_think\_my\_wife\_might\_be\_cheating\_on\_me\_with\_a/?utm\_source=share&utm\_medium=web3x&utm\_name=web3xcss&utm\_term=1&utm\_content=share\_button](https://www.reddit.com/r/Advice/comments/1gahddb/i_think_my_wife_might_be_cheating_on_me_with_a/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web3x&utm_name=web3xcss&utm_term=1&utm_content=share_button)

**Original post summary:**  
For those of you who didn’t see my original post, here’s a brief summary:

In my previous post, I shared some difficult suspicions about my wife, who recently became increasingly close to a 17-year-old boy she coaches. She started making strange comments about his looks, athletic abilities, and personal qualities that went beyond her usual enthusiasm for coaching. Meanwhile, she’s become much more secretive with her phone and is often late home from practice without clear explanations. These changes have left me wondering if there’s something more happening between them, but I don’t have solid proof and don’t want to jump to conclusions without evidence.

**Late update**:  
First off, I want to thank everyone for the comments, advice, and support on my original post. Unfortunately, my original post was initially taken down, and I received a three-day temporary ban from the subreddit. Thankfully, the post was eventually restored after my ban ended. Since I wasn’t able to share updates during that time, I’ve decided to create a new post with all the updates so far, structured chronologically to keep everything organized. Sorry to keep everyone waiting—this is why I’m only updating now, and the last five days have also been a whirlwind.

**Post update 1:**  
I took some of your advice and reached out to a lawyer—well, sort of. An old friend from high school, who’s now a successful family lawyer, happens to be visiting his family here in *{my hometown}* this week. While family law isn’t exactly what I need, I’d rather speak to someone I trust before hiring a lawyer and potentially escalating things out of control.

I’m meeting him for coffee tomorrow and will update you afterward. I’m hoping he can give me some solid legal advice without things getting too intense. I obviously don’t want her to be arrested or anything drastic like that, but I also don’t know what to do next. Right now, I’m not even angry—just overwhelmed and in shock. It’s hard to process that someone I’ve been so close to over the last two years might not be who I thought and could have been hiding something awful this whole time.

**Post update 2:**  
The last five days have been absolute hell. The title is a bit of a giveaway, but pretty much everyone who commented was right, and my own suspicions have been confirmed.

After talking to my friend (the lawyer), we agreed that I should confront her with my concerns suggest looking through her phone together just to put some of my suspicions to rest. I realise how risky this was, but we really didn’t have a lot of choice considering there was no clear proof that anything weird had been going on.  
He suggested that we meet somewhere quiet, but still in a public setting in case she decided to freak out and do something irrational. I decided to take her our local park where I sat her down on a park bench well away from any crowds of people.

When we sat down together, I told her how serious of a situation we could be in and that she MUST be completely honest with me, and that want to be on her side but the way she had been acting had led to some serious suspicions. I explained to her that I didn’t want to break the trust between us so had decided against looking through her phone, despite how tempted I was.

When I told her the concerns, she immediately got defensive and started denying everything. She called me a “paranoid asshole” for even suggesting that she would be in a relationship with a minor. She said the fact that I would even question something like this means there’s probably something wrong with me and that I must be the one hiding something.

Honestly, the way she reacted just confirmed to me that there was something that she hadn’t been telling me this entire time and that without her cooperation, the safest bet was probably just to leave.

I suggested that we look through her phone together just to provide ME with closure and even if there was nothing to hide, it would mean a lot to me that she would just humour me and that it might even be fun to look through together and laugh at how ridiculous I was being.

She screamed at me for “trying to invade her privacy” and that I had massively overstepped the line before storming away from me, back to the car and driving to her friend’s house to stay for the night.

I don’t know what she talked about with her friend but at around 3:00 am the next morning I got a really long text from her giving her view of the situation. The messages was as follows (the entire message was considerably long so I’ve summarised it for this post): My wife - I really don’t think what I have been doing is wrong, it started with me just helping this kid with some extra practice because he was struggling to get the hang of some of the drills we had been working on in that days training session. These private sessions were becoming more regular and after about three weeks of extra training sessions he sent me a friend request to my Instagram. He wasn’t the first one of the team to send me a request and I wouldn’t usually accept them but as I was giving this kid private coaching sessions I though it made more sense.  
He started to send me DMs so I responded, because I’m not a total asshole. Ok, maybe the texts aren’t just about soccer anymore, there’s nothing wrong with being friends with a kid, you’ve always been super close to your younger brother and I’ve never called you out for being “weird”.

The message then proceeded to say how much of an asshole I was for trying to call her out and trapping her in a situation that would always leave her looking bad.

She ended the message by telling me that she thinks that she’ll be able to look past this and forgive me for being a “total insecure dickhead” and that if I ever questioned her like this again, she would be filing for a divorce.

I was in complete shock when I read this response as I have never seen this side to my wife. This is not the kind, loving, respectful, and open person whom i had married and it is driving me totally insane, I just don’t know what to do.

I understand that what she was telling me is not normal and I can’t believe how naïve I have been for so long, but I still feel like there’s even more going on that she’s not telling me. Her long message didn’t actually explain why she had been messaging this kid so much and for so long, or why she had been spending literal hours every evening locked in our bedroom or on the sofa just on her phone.

IDK, maybe I AM just being paranoid?

Maybe this is more normal than I’m making it out to be, although this seems unlikely.

Should I still try to look through her phone anyway, despite what she’s told me?

When we had met the previous day, my friend mentioned that this was out of his field but that I shouldn’t contact the police until I was more sure of anything because if we did end up getting a divorce, and she is technically innocent, calling the police on your wife for providing extra help to a kid she coaches wouldn’t look very good for me in a courtroom.
