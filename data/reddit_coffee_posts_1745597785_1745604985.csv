They will not hire more people and if I went in today, it would have been just me and I probably would have snapped, finally. I will say this: I love almost all my coworkers. There is only one ahole who is a selfish, trash-talking b!tch. Everybody else is a sweetheart and works hard and helps out.

1k7rr9x,https://www.reddit.com/r/HFY/comments/1k7rr9x/the_esf_angels_in_armor_14/,[The ESF] Angels In Armor (1/4),"## Chapter 1: Arrival

Gaza Strip, June 2024. Noon.

The air was thick with dust and heat. Sunlight baked the shattered concrete and charred rebar as Israeli Merkavas crept forward in staggered formation through the ruins of Zeitoun, their engines growling like beasts ready to pounce. Drones circled above like vultures. Infantry fanned out behind armored bulldozers, pressing toward Gaza City with purpose sharpened by months of blood and fury.

Lieutenant Colonel Dov Mazar, Gaza One Actual, squinted past the optics of his command vehicle. His face was sun-worn, jaw clenched. Somewhere in the city beyond, his niece's left arm had been taken by a rocket-propelled grenade on October 7th. He didn't hate the people here. He just didn't have room for sympathy anymore.

Then the voice crackled over comms.

> ""Gaza One Actual, be advised, multiple unknown contacts are approaching your location at low altitude.""

He blinked. ""Say again?""

> ""Unknowns. Fast movers. No IFF. Bearing north by northeast, vectoring straight toward the city.""

Before he could respond, they came.

No sonic booms, no warning. Just long shadows and a tearing sound across the sky as five aircraft screamed in just above rooftop level - sleek, silver-black delta shapes with no visible insignia, too angular, too clean. They banked hard over the combat zone and released cargo.

Massive drop-pods broke free with concussive hisses, trailing white vapor. At first, Mazar thought they were munitions - some new deep-penetration ordinance, maybe American. But they didn't impact. They *slowed*, decelerating in synchronized bursts as retro-rockets ignited at the last hundred feet, stabilizers flaring out like petals. The pods hovered for a split-second, then *opened*.

What emerged didn't belong in any war Mazar knew.

They were humanoid - massive, bipedal, twice the height of a tank and shaped like soldiers of some terrible myth. Gleaming alloy skin. Broad armored shoulders. Fluid, weightless motion. Each bore a wireframe globe encircled by laurels on its chest, flanked by two crossed broken swords  -  alien and unfamiliar.

They landed with a ground-shaking *thud* in a perimeter around the makeshift refugee camp at Shuja'iyya. Dust swirled around them as they raised squat, heavy-barreled weapons. One rotated its head and spoke in a perfectly modulated voice, amplified for the battlefield:

> ""This area is under our protection. Civilians are not combatants. Any further advance or attack will be met with lethal force.""

It repeated the message, seamlessly, in Arabic.

> ""هذه المنطقة تحت حمايتنا. المدنيون ليسوا مقاتلين. أي تقدم أو هجوم آخر سيقابل بقوة قاتلة.""

And then in Hebrew.

> ""האזור הזה נמצא תחת הגנתנו. אזרחים אינם לוחמים. כל התקדמות או התקפה נוספת תיענה בכוח קטלני.""

Mazar stared.

""What the hell are those?"" muttered his gunner, half-risen from the hatch.

Mazar keyed into battalion net.

> ""Command, Gaza One Actual. We've got... robots. Giant ones. Unknown origin. They just drew a line around the camp and told us to back off. I repeat - hostile warning, but no engagement yet.""

There was no immediate response. Only the distant report of gunfire and the dull, electric hum of the mechs as they adjusted their stance.

From behind a collapsed wall, Leila Farrah's voice whispered excitedly into a mic.

> ""CNN, live from Gaza. Something extraordinary is happening. Several unidentified aerial craft have dropped what appear to be mechanized suits - larger than anything we've ever seen - around the refugee center. They're... protecting it. This is not IDF. This is not Hamas. These are *new players*.""

Her cameraman zoomed in on the insignia. ""Do you know that logo?"" he whispered.

Leila shook her head, eyes wide.

Far away in the IDF HQ, Brigadier-General Tamir Gonen stood in a command post, peering at the drone feed. He saw the line drawn. Saw the motionless titans holding the perimeter. He didn't flinch. But he issued the order without hesitation.

> ""All units halt. Air assets to hold position. Do *not* test them. Not until we know what the hell we're looking at.""

---

### IDF Southern Command HQ

The command post buzzed with tension, every station lit up, overlapping voices tumbling over each other in Hebrew and English.

> ""Southern corridor, Rafah - unknown units established overwatch around the hospital and school compound. No response to hails.""
>
> ""Beit Lahia reports same. Three of them, standing silent just outside the UN shelter perimeter. Infantry's holding position, awaiting orders.""
>
> ""Khan Yunis. They dropped in the marketplace, sir. *Right* in the middle of it. Didn't fire. Just...stood there.""

Tamir Gonen didn't answer immediately. He leaned forward, hands on the table, eyes scanning the real-time satellite feed assembling on the main wall. One by one, red tags - Israeli forces - froze along every axis of approach. And around each population center, blue rings had appeared, growing steadily with each report. Within the rings were the same figures: humanoid, colossal, unmoving. Always the same insignia.

It was as though someone had drawn a precise, deliberate box around every city, refugee camp, and dense civilian cluster in the Gaza Strip... and posted these things like guardian statues.

""Not one of ours?"" he asked quietly.

""No sir. No nation claims them. No chatter. No intel. Mossad's blind. Langley's calling them 'angels,' but they're just as in the dark.""

He exhaled slowly. A machine was humming in the corner - coffee forgotten mid-brew. A junior officer rubbed his face, muttering to no one.

> ""It's like they knew *exactly* where we were going. Where we were hitting. And they beat us there.""

Gonen straightened.

> ""They're not just protecting civilians. They're boxing us *out*.""

Someone laughed, sharp and nervous.

> ""What the hell kind of army defends refugees?""

Silence followed.

Then Gonen gave the only order that made sense.

> ""Tell every unit: do not engage. Pull armor back two klicks. Get me an open channel to whoever these things report to.""

He paused.

> ""And start sweeping our networks. I want to know who's been watching us. Because someone has been watching a *long* time.""

---

### Gaza Outskirts

The air was still again - too still.

Then came the call that turned Mazar's blood cold.

> ""Alpha Six is rotating turret.""

He snapped his head toward the far right of the formation. One of the tanks had edged slightly forward, its turret swiveling with the slow, unmistakable intent of target acquisition. Mazar keyed into the platoon net.

> ""Alpha Six, *hold your fire*. That is a direct order. Do *not* engage.""

No response.

As he clambered up from the hatch, ready to signal manually if he had to, something shimmered in the air.

A faint lattice of yellow light flickered to life around the Landmate closest to the rogue tank. Hexagonal, almost translucent. It played across the mech's frame like a net made of sunlight. At first, it did nothing - passive, humming.

Then the turret locked on.

Instantly, the lattice intensified. The yellow shifted to orange, then red - *deep*, angry red - focusing like a lens over the tank's barrel. Mazar could feel it before he could hear it: a vibration in his chest, like a pressure wave from an explosion yet to happen.

And then the mech roared.

It was a synthetic sound, but it tapped into something primal - metal scraping against metal, pitch-shifted into a lion's growl amplified a hundredfold. The sound echoed through the broken streets, bounced off ruined buildings, sent birds fleeing in all directions.

> ""Alpha Six, STAND DOWN, GODDAMN YOU!""

Leila flinched as the mech's howl washed over them. Her cameraman, to his credit, kept filming.

> ""Still live,"" he whispered.

The tank didn't stop. There was no flash of hesitation. No retraction.

The main gun fired.

A sabot round - tungsten dart, armor-piercing, meant to punch through enemy steel like paper - streaked downrange toward the Landmate.

And the grid pulsed.

Everything after that was a blur of light and motion.

The smoke hadn't even cleared.

Through the drifting dust, the red lattice clung to the Merkava like a curse - etched across its surface in flickering geometric patterns. The sabot round hadn't left so much as a scratch on the mech. It still stood, statuesque, unmoved.

Then it lowered its rifle.

No visible recoil. No audible shot - just a muffled pulse of displaced air as it fired once.

The round struck the tank dead-on, center of the glacis plate. What should have been the most reinforced part of the vehicle crumpled like foil. The sound wasn't an explosion, but a collapse - metal folding in on itself with sickening speed.

Then the fire came.

It leapt from the driver's hatch, the exhaust ports, the cupola - any opening where air could feed the inferno. In seconds, the tank was a sealed oven of white-orange flame. No hatches blew. No crew escaped.

Mazar didn't move. He didn't have to. He knew.

> ""They're gone,"" he muttered. ""All of them.""

Around him, no one spoke. The battlefield had gone utterly silent, save for the crackling roar of the burning tank. No one fired. No one ran. Even the air seemed afraid to move.

Mazar keyed into the battalion net, voice flat and final.

> ""This is Gaza One Actual to all elements. Weapons *cold*. Hold position. No further actions unless explicitly ordered.""

No one challenged him. No one replied. They all just obeyed.

Slowly, as if nothing had happened, the lattice shifted. The burning red faded to a muted amber, then back to that pulsing yellow. The light grid resumed its motion, sweeping across the battlefield like a scanner - passing over vehicles, personnel, even rubble - measuring, tracking, *watching*.

### CNN Breaking News, Expert Analysis

> ""With us now is retired U.S. Army Colonel James McTavish, formerly of the 68th Armor Regiment and a decorated veteran of multiple operations across the Middle East. Colonel, thank you for joining us.""

> ""Pleasure to be here, Emily.""

> ""We're looking now at the slowed footage from Gaza - specifically, the exchange between what are being called the 'Golems' and the Israeli Merkava tank. Colonel, walk us through what we're seeing.""

Footage plays on split screen: high-resolution, frame-by-frame sequence of the confrontation.

> ""So what you're seeing here is a textbook armored engagement - at least, on the Israeli side. The Merkava Mark IV is a top-tier main battle tank. It's designed to survive hits from just about anything in the region. What it's firing is an APFSDS round - armor-piercing fin-stabilized discarding sabot. That's a dart made of tungsten or depleted uranium, traveling at over a mile per second.""

> ""And yet it didn't do anything.""

> ""Correct. If you freeze the frame right here - "" *(Footage pauses as the round impacts the Golem)* "" - you can actually see the sabot shattering. It hits center mass and *disintegrates*. No deflection, no penetration, just fragmentation and vapor.""

> ""So the unit wasn't damaged at all?""

> ""Not visibly, no. No change in posture, no recoil, no system failure. That implies either armor material we don't understand or some form of active mitigation - shielding, energy dispersion, something *very* advanced.""

> ""And then the return fire?""

Footage resumes - one single flash, the tank imploding.

> ""This... this is the part that should be studied frame-by-frame in every defense ministry on the planet. The Golem returns fire with a single round. No muzzle flash, no shell casing. Just a pulse - something fast and invisible.""

> ""And the result?""

> ""Direct strike to the glacis plate. Penetration through multiple layers of spaced composite armor. Crew compartment fully compromised in a split second. From a tank survivability standpoint, that's total kill. The round didn't just breach - it likely *overpressurized* the interior or vaporized key components. That's *instantaneous fatality* for everyone inside.""

> ""In your professional opinion, how powerful is that weapon?""

> ""Let me put it plainly: on a tactical battlefield, there is no current weapon more effective than what we just saw. Short of dropping a MOAB or using nuclear arms, no army has *anything* that can deal that kind of damage to a tank, much less with this kind of precision. It makes the Golem the most dangerous combatant in any known theater today.""

> ""And what about the broader implications?""

> ""I'm not here to talk morality or strategy. I don't know who sent them or why. But from where I sit - this wasn't just a show of force. It was a demonstration of *supremacy*.""

> ""Colonel McTavish, thank you.""

> ""Any time.""

### IDF Southern Command HQ, Be'er Sheva. Thirty minutes later.

The operations floor was chaos wrapped in fluorescent light. Analysts huddled in groups, screens flickering with every imaginable angle - satellite, drone, helmet cams. But all eyes kept returning to the same feed: Leila Farrah's raw footage, replayed again and again, frame by agonizing frame.

> ""Frame 1832 - turret locks on target.""
>
> ""1833 - unit's lattice changes to red. No visible change in posture.""
>
> ""1836 - shot fired. 1837... impact.""

Silence. Then:

> ""That's not a sabot hit, sir. It's a *puncture*. A perfect one.""

An engineer leaned over another's shoulder, eyes wide as a new image loaded: a close-up, sent via secure channel by Mazar's forward crew. The Merkava's glacis plate - what was left of it - was cratered inward. Not shattered, not scorched by external heat.

Just *cored*.

A clean, 20-centimeter hole melted straight through the armor like a drill press made of hellfire. Edges molten, smoothed by temperatures far beyond what any known kinetic penetrator or shaped charge could produce.

""Could be directed-energy,"" one analyst offered.

""Not a beam,"" another snapped. ""There's no heat plume, no residual radiation, no dispersion. And that strike was instantaneous. No time of flight.""

Brigadier-General Tamir Gonen loomed behind them all, arms crossed, face carved from stone.

> ""So what are we looking at? A railgun? Particle lance? Plasma?""

None of them answered.

Behind them, another feed lit up - international news, all channels tuned to the same breaking footage: Farrah's broadcast, live. Millions had just watched an Israeli tank open fire on an unidentified guardian... and die in return.

> ""We've already got questions from Washington, London, and Berlin,"" someone muttered. ""The Arab League's calling this 'divine intervention.' Twitter's calling them angels. The Vatican put out a statement.""

Gonen didn't blink.

> ""We just got outgunned in full view of the world. Someone sent us a message, and they wrote it in *blood*.""

He turned toward the intelligence lead.

> ""Find me *everything*. Materials science, exotic weapon signatures, flight profiles, *any damn thing*. I want a full analysis of that shot. I want to know if it can be blocked, if it can be survived, or if we are *completely* outmatched.""

A pause.

> ""And someone get me Gaza One Actual. I want to speak to the man who stood twenty meters from that thing and lived.""

### Gaza Outskirts

The sun dipped slightly westward, shadows stretching long across the broken asphalt and dust-choked streets. The IDF column had gone from armored advance to improvised bivouac. Hatches open, helmets off, men sitting cross-legged in the shade of their own machines. It was less a military operation now, and more a roadside picnic - nervous, silent, and surreal.

The metal giants still hadn't moved.

Lieutenant Colonel Dov Mazar sat on the engine deck of his command Merkava, a cigarette burning low between his fingers, headset pressed tight to one ear. The line crackled to life.

> ""This is Brigadier-General Gonen. Mazar, report.""

He sat up straighter. ""Sir. We're holding position. No further provocation. Units - whatever they are - remain stationary. Grid pattern still active. Yellow.""

> ""You sent us a picture.""

Mazar exhaled slowly. ""Yes, sir.""

> ""That hole wasn't made by anything we've ever seen. Tell me exactly what happened.""

He hesitated, then spoke with clinical precision.

> ""Alpha Six went rogue. Disobeyed direct order. Locked turret on nearest unit. The light grid around the unit changed - yellow to red - focused like a targeting system. Then it *roared*, sir. Like a machine pretending to be a predator. We issued another stand-down, but the tank fired anyway.""

> ""And?""

> ""The unit fired one shot. No visible projectile. No warning. Instant strike. Hit the glacis plate and cored it like an apple. No secondary, no overpenetration. Just... annihilation.""

Silence on the line.

Mazar filled it.

> ""The thing's still standing there. Not even a scorch mark.""

> ""Describe the weapon.""

> ""Rifle-shaped. Squat, heavy barrel. Carried like a human would, but not clumsy. No recoil. No muzzle flash. It didn't look like it was *straining* to fire - more like it was annoyed.""

Another pause.

> ""What do you think they are, Mazar?""

He glanced across the camp. Soldiers were watching the things now with a kind of quiet reverence. Fear had curdled into awe.

> ""I think they're not here for us. Not unless we make them be. They're here for the people we were trying to drive out.""

> ""Any idea who sent them?""

Mazar crushed the cigarette out on the track armor beside him.

> ""Someone who knew exactly where we'd be. Exactly what we'd do. And decided *not* to let us finish it.""

He looked up again. The nearest unit hadn't moved in over an hour. Just standing, immobile. Watching.

> ""They're not tanks, General. They're not drones. They're not even just machines.""

> ""Then what are they?""

Mazar's jaw tensed.

> ""I don't know, sir. And I'm a little scared to find out.""

### CNN Live – ""Understanding the Golems"" Panel Discussion

**Studio Anchor (Emily Zhao):**  
> ""We're now joined by a panel of experts from different fields to discuss the psychological and symbolic dimensions of the Golems - those massive, unknown entities currently enforcing a still-undeclared ceasefire in the Gaza Strip.""

The screen splits into four:  
- **Dr. Mina Kalderon**, Professor of Semiotics, University of Toronto  
- **Dr. David Lutz**, Professor of Communications Theory, MIT  
- **Dr. Samira Qasrawi**, Professor of Anthropology, University of Edinburgh  
- **Janet Ryland**, Senior Strategy Director at ArchonPR, a top-tier marketing firm

**Emily Zhao:**  
> ""Let's begin with you, Dr. Kalderon. The grid - the green, yellow, red lattice that seems to project from these machines. What are we seeing here, symbolically?""

**Dr. Kalderon (smiling faintly):**  
> ""It's a visual language, Emily. A semiotic system built on color-coding that is *immediately* understood, no matter your culture or background. Green - safe. Yellow - caution. Red - threat. It's universal. They've designed this to bypass language and go straight to instinct.""

**Emily:**  
> ""Dr. Lutz, your take?""

**Dr. Lutz:**  
> ""It's *brilliant* communication. We're looking at a deterrence model that communicates intent without ambiguity. The Golems don't posture, don't taunt, don't provoke. They simply *inform.* The message is: 'You are being watched. Act accordingly.'""

**Emily:**  
> ""But then there's the roar - massive, low-frequency, almost animalistic. Doesn't that contradict their controlled, almost surgical demeanor?""

**Dr. Qasrawi:**  
> ""No, actually, it reinforces it.""

She adjusts her glasses, leaning slightly forward.

> ""That roar is primal. It bypasses logic and hits deep limbic triggers. We're talking about acoustic ranges that mirror predatory warnings - lions, bears, thunder. It's fear carved into our species across a million years. And yet, they use it *sparingly*. Only in moments of extreme escalation.""

**Emily:**  
> ""So it's not emotional - it's *deliberate*?""

**Dr. Qasrawi:**  
> ""Exactly. The Golems are not emotional entities. But they *simulate* what works. They're tacticians not just of war, but of *presence.* The roar says: 'You have crossed the line.' And for nearly every person who hears it, that's enough.""

**Emily:**  
> ""Ms. Ryland, from a messaging perspective - how do you interpret their restraint? Their silence?""

**Janet Ryland (calm, confident):**  
> ""It's controlled branding, whether intentional or not. The silence, the stillness, the refusal to overexplain - it *builds mystique*. The Golems don't demand legitimacy. They simply *act* with it. And when violence does occur, it's not chaotic - it's *surgical*. That's terrifying, yes, but also persuasive. They're presenting violence as *inevitability*, not spectacle.""

**Emily Zhao:**  
> ""So they're not just enforcers. They're messengers.""

**Dr. Lutz:**  
> ""Exactly. Every action is an encoded signal. They're writing new rules - not with treaties, but with behavior.""

**Emily Zhao (softly):**  
> ""And the world is watching.""

The panel nodded, each in silent agreement.",1,1745604697.0,HFY,2,1.0,False
1k7rr6f,https://www.reddit.com/r/CoffeeBrewerReviews/comments/1k7rr6f/explore_the_versatility_of_new_england_stories/,Explore the versatility of New England Stories milk frother review now!,"Testing out the New England Stories MF-BLACK-H1 milk frother has been an interesting journey. As someone who appreciates frothy lattes in the morning and rich cappuccinos in the evening, I was excited to try this compact, battery-powered handheld frother. After weeks of daily use, I’ve gathered insights about its performance, convenience, and limitations. Here’s my honest take.

**Sleek and Practical Design**  
The frother's slim design caught my eye the moment I unboxed it. It’s lightweight at just 2.9 ounces and finished in a matte black color that gives it a clean, modern aesthetic. Its ergonomic handle made it comfortable to grip, which is a lifesaver when you’re fighting morning grogginess. Unlike bulky frothers with stands, this one fits effortlessly into my kitchen drawer, saving counter space. Crafted with stainless steel and durable plastic, it looked sturdy enough to withstand regular use, though I admit, I was curious to see if it lived up to its promise of durability.

**Ease of Use**  
This milk frother is as straightforward as they come, and I mean that in the best way possible. It runs on two AA batteries, which regrettably aren’t included, but once I popped them in, the device was ready to go. With a one-speed setting, operating it is as simple as pressing the button. I used it to froth milk, whisk protein powders, and even mix hot chocolate. In about 15–20 seconds, it created a rich, creamy foam that made my homemade lattes rival those from my favorite café. That said, the one-speed setting can prove tricky for thinner liquids; I had to be strategic with cup sizes to avoid splashes.

**Advantages**  
- Efficient froth creation in seconds for coffee, matcha, or other mixes.  
- Compact design, ideal for storage and portability.  
- Stainless steel components ensure durability and easy cleaning.  
- Lightweight and ergonomic for extended use.  

[Check New England Stories MF-BLACK-H1 price on Amazon.](https://idealcoffeeshop.com/price/b09tt9tfsn/)

**Limitations**  
While it impressed in many ways, the frother isn’t without its flaws. For one, the lack of included batteries meant an extra errand for me before I even started. Its relatively short whisk stem (about 3.5 inches) limited my options for taller containers. Also, the one-speed setup, while functional, sometimes felt too aggressive for mixing lightweight powders or frothing liquids in smaller cups.  

- Short whisk stem makes it inconvenient for deeper mugs.  
- Requires battery replacement frequently with regular use.  
- Lack of stand increases the chance of storage damage.

**Strengths Compared to Competing Brands**  
Looking at alternatives like the Zulay Classic Frother or PowerLix, this handheld tool outshines them in portability and ease of use. Its lightweight build makes it feel less cumbersome than Zulay's heavier design. However, competitors like PowerLix offer models with dual power sources—both rechargeable and battery-operated—which would sideline my critique of frequent battery replacements. Some also include a stand for more convenient storage, an addition I would have appreciated in this product.

**Cost Efficiency**  
Considering its premium features and functional simplicity, I’d say this frother strikes a decent balance between cost and quality. For anyone who wants quick foam results without a steep upfront investment, it’s definitely worth considering, especially if portability is a priority. Even though some higher-priced brands come with more advanced features, you could argue this one provides the necessities at a cost-effective rate.

we went on a date and it was fun id say, we talked all along on a 3hour long walk+coffee. she returned to her hometown for easter and the flirting basically toned down but i didnt make much of it, like whatever.
a week later i asked her if shes still interested and she said yeah and that she liked me and our convos. 4 days ago she randomly said she “doesnt need anyone more to talk to bc im enough”.
at this moment, she knew of my past experiences that i felt like a consolation to other people. 

today i asked her how shes seeing it bc im aware that we saw each other only once but i didnt wanna remain unsure. she said “we saw each other only once and idk when im coming back to warsaw, atp friendly footing is okay with me”to which i responded “thanks for sincerity, i dont wanna lose sleep over anything unsure. all the best!” and well basically i didnt receive any message back to that.

and like is it wrong not to want to be friends here? i talked to my mom and my brother and they told me im an asshole for not wanting the friendship, and the truth is im trying to protect my peace.
im kinda having second thoughts, truth is i liked that girl but i dont necessarily want to remain in smth like that.",1,1745604474.0,dating_advice,1,1.0,False

I’m constantly on the lookout for something that not only promises to boost my energy, improve my focus, or enhance my overall well-being, but something that actually delivers on those promises. Enter **Nagano Tonic**—a product that has completely changed the game for me.

From the moment I first heard about Nagano Tonic, I was intrigued. Hailing from the pristine mountains of Nagano, Japan, it carries with it the promise of pure, natural ingredients sourced from one of the cleanest and most biodiverse regions on the planet. Nagano is known for its rich, centuries-old traditions of herbal healing, and the tonic blends some of the best elements of this wisdom with cutting-edge science. I’ve always been skeptical of “miracle” products, so I approached Nagano Tonic with a mix of hope and caution.

But after using this product for just a few weeks, I can confidently say that it has far exceeded any of my expectations.

# The First Impressions: Quality and Taste

When I first opened the bottle, I was immediately impressed by the sleek, elegant packaging. It’s clear that the company behind Nagano Tonic values both the aesthetics and the quality of the product. The dark, amber-colored liquid inside exudes a sense of purity and natural goodness. You can almost *feel* the richness of the ingredients through the bottle.

As for the taste—let’s just say it’s not your average health drink. Unlike many other tonics or supplements I’ve tried in the past that taste either overly synthetic or bitter, Nagano Tonic has a surprisingly refreshing, earthy flavor with subtle hints of green tea and Japanese herbs. It’s not overpowering, and there’s a smoothness to it that makes it easy to drink every day. I personally enjoy it chilled, but I’ve also mixed it into smoothies for an extra health boost.

# Immediate Effects: Energy, Clarity, and Focus

I’ve always been a person with a bit of a “midday slump.” It’s the time when my energy dips and my brain becomes foggy, making it hard to stay focused and productive. Since I started incorporating Nagano Tonic into my daily routine, that midday crash has become a thing of the past. Within 30 minutes of drinking a small serving in the morning, I felt an almost instant surge of clean, sustained energy. It wasn’t the jittery, caffeine-like energy that you get from a cup of coffee. Instead, it was a calm, steady sense of alertness that lasted for hours.

The difference was palpable. My mind felt sharper, clearer, and more focused. I found myself able to power through tasks with much more efficiency and without that nagging feeling of burnout that usually sets in after a few hours of work.

What I really love about Nagano Tonic is that it doesn’t just offer an energy boost—it also seems to improve my mental clarity and focus. This is particularly noticeable when I have to dive into complex work or creative tasks. It’s as though my brain is firing on all cylinders, and I feel more capable of tackling difficult problems. I’ve been more productive, creative, and even more organized, and I can only attribute it to this incredible tonic.

# Long-Term Benefits: Health, Immunity, and Vitality

After using Nagano Tonic for a few weeks, I started noticing even more profound changes. I’m no longer plagued by those annoying little aches and pains that tend to accumulate as we age, especially around my joints. I’m not saying Nagano Tonic is a “miracle cure,” but it certainly seems to have a positive impact on my overall mobility and well-being. My recovery times after workouts have improved, and I’ve felt generally more flexible and agile.

Additionally, I’ve noticed improvements in my immune system. I’ve always had a sensitive stomach and would often find myself catching colds or feeling a little run-down. Since incorporating Nagano Tonic into my routine, I’ve felt stronger and more resilient. I don’t know if it's the tonic’s potent combination of antioxidants, vitamins, and adaptogens, or the balance of minerals it provides, but I’ve been able to fight off the usual seasonal bugs without a hitch. The company claims that the tonic helps boost the immune system, and based on my experience, I’d say it’s true.

But perhaps one of the most remarkable long-term benefits I’ve experienced is an overall increase in my vitality. I wake up feeling more refreshed, sleep more deeply, and have more energy throughout the day. Even my skin seems healthier, glowing with a subtle radiance that I didn’t expect to see at my age. If I had to sum it up, I’d say Nagano Tonic has given me a much-needed “reboot” of vitality.

# Ingredients You Can Trust

One of the most impressive things about Nagano Tonic is the transparency around its ingredients. Each bottle is made with natural, high-quality components that are ethically sourced from the mountains of Nagano. The tonic contains traditional herbs like **ginseng**, **turmeric**, **gingko biloba**, and **matcha**, all of which are known for their potent health benefits. What sets Nagano Tonic apart is its dedication to using organic and wildcrafted ingredients that are free from artificial additives, preservatives, and fillers.

It’s rare to find a product in today’s wellness market that is both so effective and so clean. You can truly feel confident knowing that you’re nourishing your body with the purest ingredients available.

# The Cost: Worth Every Penny

Now, let’s talk about the cost. When I first saw the price of Nagano Tonic, I won’t lie, I was a little hesitant. But after experiencing the benefits firsthand, I can honestly say that it’s worth every penny. It’s not just a drink—it’s an investment in your health. The effects it’s had on my energy, clarity, immune system, and general well-being make it a valuable addition to my daily routine.

In fact, I consider it a non-negotiable part of my wellness regimen now. I’ve tried countless products that promise results but deliver nothing more than temporary fixes, but Nagano Tonic is the real deal. It’s something I truly look forward to each day, and I can’t imagine going back to life without it.

# The Bottom Line: Should You Buy Nagano Tonic?

If you’re looking for a natural, effective way to boost your energy, improve your mental clarity, and support your overall health, then **Nagano Tonic** is a must-have. It’s a product that I wholeheartedly recommend, and one that I’ll continue to use for the long haul. It’s not just a wellness trend—it’s a genuinely transformative product that works.

Whether you’re a busy professional, a parent juggling a million tasks, or someone who simply wants to feel better on a daily basis, this tonic is for you. You’ll feel the difference in just days, and the long-term benefits are well worth the investment.

Don’t just take my word for it—try it for yourself. Once you do, I’m confident that you’ll be just as hooked as I am. **Nagano Tonic** isn’t just a drink; it’s a lifestyle upgrade. I can’t imagine my day without it anymore.",1,1745604322.0,aliner,1,1.0,False

My boyfriend has recently gotten into Pokémon and has met many great people in the community and participates in trades and card shows. I can see how happy this hobby makes him and how many friends share this hobby with him. 

In the city we live in, stores are always dry out of pokémon cards so if you want to buy a pack of cards or a bundle, you have to wait in line for the drop or get really lucky to be in a store when the restock happens. For the past few weeks/months my boyfriend has been chasing these drops to get some pokémon cards. I have always without fail gone with him to these drops or restocks because the stores usually implement a limit per person. I have even gone with him on longer drives to get cards. There are even times when he’s in class and I’m not, I will go alone to these stores to check if they have stock or to make purchases or if he sees stock at a store, he’ll ask me to hurriedly come to buy some packs (because of the per-person limit). I would say up until today, I have always shown up for him - either with him or on my own. Typically, I always have to go out of my way to get these packs for him, it’s usually not convenient for me but I do it anyways because I actually love seeing how excited he gets over these cards and opening the packs and the anticipation of getting a good pull. 

Pretty early on when he was getting into the hobby, he invited me to open packs with him and made it fun for me too since my first pack had a really nice card in it. Ever since, we would open packs together and I always thought it was so much fun, but have always let it be his hobby. I’ll open the packs with him but all the cards are his and he gets to trade them or sell them etc. 

I work two part time jobs alongside being a university student and last night while I was at work, he texts me that he is going to sleep before I get home to wake up early for a pokémon drop at a store. I didn’t think much of it and I get home from work at 3am and fall asleep around 4am. He wakes up next to me around 5:30am and goes to the store to wait in line for the restock to happen. Some snafu happens and my boyfriend ended up having to go to another store because the first store notified the line that they didn’t receive the stock today. He gets to the other store and they don’t open until 10am so he texts me around 6:30am to ask if I can take stand in line in his spot starting at around 8:45am to wait for the store to open at 10am. He asked me to take his spot and purchase the product because he had an exam at 9am to take. The original store opens at 8am so he would have been able to buy his own items but because they didn’t receive stock, he had to go to this other store which opens at 10am, which conflicts with his exam. I didn’t respond to the text message at 6:30am because I was dead asleep so he calls me at 7:45am to wake me up. He didn’t call to talk but dialed me so that the vibration of my phone would awaken me to respond to his text. I very kindly deny his request to wait in line for him because I was very tired. I had only been asleep for about 3 hours and wasn’t expecting to have to wake up early and drive to a store and wait in a line to buy pokémon cards. 

I totally respect the hustle of waiting in lines for restock. I have even pulled up when he was in line and offered him coffee or snacks as a way to show support for his hobby. 

At first I said “I’m sorry but I’m exhausted” and he ‘accepted’ it saying “oh alright i’ll just leave the line then”. With some more messages from him, I could tell he was trying to guilt me into doing him the favor of waiting in line for him. But I stood my ground and told him that I felt he was guilting me and explained to him how tired I was. I do feel really bad that I couldn’t do him the favor. It wasn’t even because I didn’t want to because I have always showed up for these drops for him but I was actually physically exhausted from a late shift and had only been asleep for 3 hours max. 

He said a lot more guilting statements like “I would do this for you” or “my fault for asking” or “it’s a crazy drop”or “appreciate you trying”. I tried ignoring the messages and falling back asleep but if I didn’t respond within a minute or two he would send another one of those phrases. I feel like he was trying to rub it in my face that I wasn’t willing to help him and that I SHOULD be guilted or that I did something wrong. 

Then I responded explaining how I always help him with pokémon drops no matter how inconvenient it is for me but this was a huge ask especially because he knows how late I get back from work. That flipped a switch and he just started getting mean and bitter saying things like “you’re not touching anymore pokémon””you just make my life inconvenient” “and you wanna open my packs? f u”. I honestly only like opening the packs with him because I feel like it shows him I support his hobbies and that it’s something we can share (“share” is used loosely because all I do is open a few packs here and there). I have no interest in pokémon past the fact that I enjoy seeing my boyfriend get excited for something so wholesome. I have a feeling he said those things to hurt my feelings. 

He then kept pushing on and on about how I ruined this for him and that I “can’t just pull up and sit in a damn chair”. I feel horribly guilty but I also don’t think I’ve done anything wrong. Any advice on how to move forward or address a conversation would be appreciated.

TLDR: My boyfriend is guilting me for not waiting in line for a pokémon restock after a late shift at work. ",1,1745604247.0,relationship_advice,1,1.0,False

My sleep is messed up so if you're wanting soneone to chat all night and day with that's me.

I like games and play on Xbox and PlayStation. Space Marine 2 and Destiny and helldivers 2 are my go-to games. I enjoy shooters and action games and the occasional city builder or rts on pc. Any recommendations are welcome. I'm excited for the new Doom game. Will also be down playing games if we hit it off.

I like cooking and so far I haven't gotten sick or made someone else sick so you can say I'm like the Gordon Ramsay of cooking something edible. I do look at recipes in terror and sometimes actually cook them. Looking for cool chatters and maybe we can play games. Or not. Who knows.

Was a huge reader until the fire nation blessed me with sudden ADD or HD or 8k or whatever. Still have the Dune sequels to read. Big warhammer 40k novel enjoyer too.

Hmm how I would describe myself? Black hair. Beard. Brown eyes. Dad not. Hairy. I've been told I had nice eye lashes.

Pink Floyd is my favorite band. I mainly listen to rock and metal. But I do on occasion listen to the Macarena and Barbie girl as I shower or cook. Zeppelin, the doors and a myriad of other classic bands are always playing.

I like coffee too. Preferably caramel. Also a redbull fan. I can drink many of those. Probably shouldn't since I don't think that's medically sound.

Pretty much looking for some fun and maybe make a friend in the process. I like to think I'm a decent conversationalist but who knows. Not sure if this is enticing so far.

1k7rfo9,https://www.reddit.com/r/UnsentLetters/comments/1k7rfo9/cyan_red/,Cyan Red,"Dear Mr. Cyan,

It's been a little over a month since you broke up with me and yet we have been on quite the journey. From making the best out of me living with you until I moved out, to being apart, to trying fwb, to trying be just friends. It's been a journey. 

I wish the last day I lived with you was the ending because it was perfect. Because here's the truth: Holding onto the attachment only made it worse. 

I thought it was the end that day. Or maybe we could somewhat send memes to each other. I told you our physical relationship cannot continue when you suggested it. 

And we spent time apart and then I met you for coffee and you looked fragile. Understandably. And then we met for dinner and things switched to a fwb situation. I figured I would test it to see if I can do it. 

Turns out I can't. It's too complicated. Plus I ended up learning and realizing more about you. 

So I said we should just be friends and you were understanding but you also kept the door open on intimacy. I did not bite. 

Shortly after setting the boundary, you start asking for favours and trying to involve my brother - the same brother you showed zero interest and mild disdain for when we dated. 

And it felt weird but my brother was getting paid so I agreed.
But then you asked for more favours and I couldn't do it anymore. 

Because you see, friends can ask for favours. But friends also need to act like friends. Since I said we should just be friends, you stopped asking me about my day. You sometimes ignore my snaps or my memes. And we only have convos when you ask for favours or you're venting about work. It's incredibly one-sided. 

You probably have no idea what I'm up to. 

And last night when I told you my brother couldn't help anymore, you were short and distant with me. 

And I realized I was being used. 

I hope you find this letter. Because I probably won't tell you any of this. I have learned everytime I bring up an issue to you, you convince me I'm overreacting or spiraling. 

But I see clearly now. 

You were still attached after the breakup. Despite ending it, you still wanted access to me when it's convenient for you. 

My body, my connections, my listening ear. 

You keep taking and taking. But there is no giving. I can't rely on you. Sure if I want intimacy, you're open to that but buddy, I need emotional safety to enjoy that. 

That's another reason I ended the fwb thing aside from the emotional complication and feeling like I had no respect for myself. It was also because it didn't feel the same anymore. It felt hollow and I wasn't enjoying it. 

And it was because the love was gone. 

I thought being friends with you was the right choice because I still respected you and enjoyed talking to you. But I realized deep down it was actually because I didn't want to admit to myself that a beautiful (yet flawed) relationship does not have a happy ending. I was trying to force a good ending. 
But I realize now, as I continue to hold on, it gets worse. 

If you were anyone else, I would have ghosted you so fast. But because you came at a time I gave up on dating and you made me feel loved and you restored that hope, I finally opened my heart and got attached and fell for you. I was all in. And you were consistent for a while but then you suddenly decided you didn't want it anymore. 

And frankly? Thank goodness for that. Because I was over compromising and losing my self respect to make it work. I was ignoring huge red flags in hopes that we were the exception. That's on me. 

As much as I can be angry at you for the way you treated me before and after the breakup. 
I have to acknowledge that I had a part in enabling it. 

I could have stood on my boundaries initially. 
I didn't have to put up with the ex snapping thing. 
I didn't have to constantly question if I was overreacting. Because I wasn't. 
I wanted respect in our relationship. 

And even when I was deciding whether or not to be friends, I had a thought occur to me - if I can't even get respect in a relationship with him, how can I expect that in a friendship?

But I told myself that you were a good person and that you will be a better friend. 
But you're not. 

Because you told me that romantic relationships can transform into platonic ones. 

You used that as justification for texting you ex everyday WHILE we were dating. 

But here I am, as one of your exes. 
And you don't show the same effort. 

And I remembered you don't give that effort to your male friends either. 

It's just your ex and some of your female friends. 

Because it's not platonic. 
Is it Mr. Cyan?

Because if there is one thing I know, it's that - the only people that text you everyday is either your mom making sure you're still alive, or someone you are emotionally attached to or trying to get something out of. 

And you have shown yourself as pretty transactional. 

I can't do this anymore. 
It has become clear that you value me very little. 
And I kept holding on because I wanted to see the good in you and believe you were good. And I feel pretty stupid now.

You may have loved me and wanted long term at one point. But as soon as you realized you didn't anymore, suddenly your respect for me goes too. 
It becomes more of what's convenient and what can you get out of it. 

I can't do this anymore. 

Holding on to you has made things worse. 

Don't expect me to reach out anymore. 

I'm done.

I was a struggling literature major who worked nights in a bar. She was pre-law, aggressively intelligent, and somehow  God only knows how  she saw me.

We clicked immediately. First dates turned into deep 3 a.m. discussions. I composed poems for her. She'd leave post-its on my mirror. Other people felt the energy between us when we walked into a room. She made me feel visible in a way that no one ever had.

We married at 23. Our wedding was small but perfect. Rain hit during the vows and she laughed, saying “this is how we’ll grow  even in the storms.” I’ll never forget that.

For the first 5 years, it was heaven. We were broke, hustling, but so in tune. Then life… happened. I got a job that kept me on the road constantly. She started climbing the law ladder. We stopped syncing. We stopped laughing.

And worst of all we stopped trying.

We didn't cheat. Never yelled. We just… faded.

We divorced when I was 31. I thought I was freeing her. In reality, I broke my own heart.

Two years afterwards two years my younger brother Ethan (29M) told me he was dating someone.

It was Lena.

He sat me down, anxiously, and told me, ""I didn't mean for it to happen… we just ran into each other, started talking. I swear we never crossed paths talking like that before.""

They were married within a year.

My ex-girlfriend became my sister-in-law.

He invited me to the wedding.

I didn't go. I couldn't even speak. My own brother married the woman I was still grieving. My family said I was being immature. That ""love is messy"" and ""you had your chance.""

So I disappeared. For three years. Birthdays, holidays, missed them all. I couldn't look at either one of them.

Two months back, I saw her again. Sheer coincidence. A bookstore in Chicago. Same aisle. Same book in hand. Our eyes met  and it felt like somebody punched the breath out of my chest.

She smiled first. Anxiously. I didn't even speak. I just stared.

We talked for two hours. Then had coffee. Then met again. And again. And before we knew it, we were talking about us. About the life we had. The life we lost. The life we both still remembered in vivid detail.

She told me Ethan was never the one. That she had attempted to make it work since he was close enough to what she had lost. But it never felt right. ""He was close,"" she said. ""But he wasn't you.""

It happened one night. I am not going to lie. It wasn't planned. It wasn't calculated. But it felt inevitable.

She ended things with Ethan a week later.

He found out why.

He showed up at my apartment. Kicked in the door screaming. Punched a hole in my wall. Told me I was dead to him.

He said I'd ""waited like a vulture.""

Said I'd ""taken his entire world away from him.""

Our mom wept when she heard.

Our dad won't even talk to me.

But I swear to you  I didn't plan this. I didn't go after her. We just. found our way back to each other. In the chaos. In the wreckage. And somehow, it still worked.

We're not ""official."" We're not wearing rings or taking Instagram selfies. But Lena's with me. She sleeps beside me again. She looks at me like she used to — not like she's trying to recapture something, but like she finally got back the original.

And yet…

My brother's life is ruined.

He's crushed. Enraged. Possibly broken forever.

And I don't know if I just listened to my heart… or ripped out his.

I've been using it for a few weeks now, and I must say, it’s a mixture of impressive features, surprising downsides, and consistent performance. Whether you're brewing a quick cup for yourself in the morning or prepping for an intimate coffee session with friends, this gadget becomes a conversation starter.

**Design and Build Quality**

One of the first things that struck me about this coffee percolator is its sleek, polished stainless steel exterior. It looks elegant and fits well on any kitchen countertop, giving that retro aesthetic with a modern touch. The cool-touch handle and rolled edges on the lid serve both style and safety. It feels durable yet light, with a weight of only 2.64 pounds, making it easy to move and pour.

What’s particularly notable is the detachable cord, which significantly simplifies storage and pouring. However, the lid knob, though functional, feels a bit flimsy to me—it hasn’t given me problems yet, but I wonder about long-term durability.

**Ease of Use**

Brewing coffee with this machine is straightforward, even for someone like me who only has 10 minutes in the morning before the chaos of the day begins. The percolator is fully automatic, so once you add water, coffee grounds, and switch it on, it’s practically hands-free. This ""set it and forget it"" functionality is a lifesaver for busy mornings.

I especially appreciate the automatic keep-warm function. My mornings often involve running around, and it’s comforting to come back to hot coffee even after 15–20 minutes. However, be aware that the keep-warm mode keeps the coffee very hot—a bit too hot for some.

**[Grab Farberware FCP240 Electric Coffee Percolator at the best price on Amazon.](https://tastefulcoffee.com/p/b00008elea/)**

**Speed and Performance**

As promised, this percolator delivers coffee at approximately one cup per minute. The speed was a relief to me, as patience isn't always my virtue in the morning. With a 1000-watt power capacity, it consistently delivers rich, aromatic coffee. I brew medium roast coffee, and each time, the result is bold and evenly brewed—just what I need to kickstart my day.

However, I did notice a slight inconsistency with the brewing times on different occasions. It’s not a dealbreaker, but it’s something to keep in mind if you’re extremely precise about timing.

**Merits**

- Eye-catching stainless steel design that blends with most kitchens.
- Compact size suitable for small to medium spaces.  
- Detachable power cord for easier storage and serving.  
- Automatic keep-warm mode enhances convenience.  

**Limitations**

- Lid knob material could feel sturdier for long-term use.  
- Coffee temperature after brewing is extremely hot, which could take time cooling.  
- Slight inconsistencies in brewing time across uses.  

**Cleaning and Maintenance**

Cleaning the percolator turned out easier than I expected. The stainless steel basket is reusable, which means no dealing with a recurring expense of paper filters. However, the design means you need to be thorough with the rinsing to avoid trapped coffee grounds—missing this step even once made the next batch taste slightly off. Oh, and I highly recommend drying all parts immediately after washing to prevent water spots from forming and dulling the shine.

**Competing Brands**

Comparing this to other percolators on the market puts the Farberware percolator in a comfortable spot. I also tested the Presto Stainless Steel Percolator during the same period. While the Presto model boasts eight-cup capacity, it lacks the compact convenience necessary for single-person or small-family households. On the downside, this Farberware model doesn’t match the Presto’s all-metal build that feels slightly sturdier. Still, for portability and speed, Farberware gains an edge.

Another rival worth noting is the Hamilton Beach Coffee Percolator. Though it offers more advanced programmable features, I found its bulkier design less appealing for smaller kitchens. Plus, the Hamilton Beach’s price point is noticeably higher, making the Farberware a more attractive option for budget-conscious coffee enthusiasts.

It is a chill coffee date, so there shouldn't be much pressure, but Im already over thinking everything. Should I approach with a hug in the very beginning? Should i offer to pay (and what if i do that am i then expected to pay for every up comming date)? I hope I look like my pictures to her. I hope we can chat naturally. I hope I don't come of too shy that she thinks of me as friend material (so should i try to be a bit more confident and really try to flirt) or awkward. Should i kiss at the end of the date? If not, would it be weird to ask if she wants a kiss??? My mind is kind of going crazy, I just hope I can try to remain myself and not freeze up or try something stupid.

I wanted to spearhead a discussion on Still Life, a horror title that came out in 2005 (whew - 20 years ago - feel like I should have maybe posted this in PatientGamers). I started playing it last night and, honestly, the tone was... very 2000s. I'm not sure if it's a good thing or a bad thing. Actually, I think it's somehow more realistic than a lot of the new depictions of cops/detectives. While they are always working on rough cases - at least in some jurisdictions - the idea that they all need to be stoic, chiseled, depressed workaholics is a little... tiresome. At the end of the day, police work is just a job and having the mental fortitude to crack jokes is probably more normal than we all give credit for. I do find myself smirking at Victoria more often than not. Hell, even the set dressing has such personality - from Victoria walking in with a coffee holder into a room with creepy dolls hanging from the ceiling to the morgue Claire works in having ""Happy New Year"" streamers over it. It's so ridiculous but somehow feels more normal than the dark cop shows I've watched in recent times.

However, one gripe that I have is the keyboard controls are unusable on PC. I have no idea why but they could not have properly tested this. At least, in my game, the cursor when controlled by the arrow keys moves so wildly that it's more of a guessing game than anything else. I actually had to just swap to mouse when they had the nerve to introduce the *timed keypad to the morgue.* For what reason? Why do this to me? *^(Oh my god.)*

But I wonder if the crazy movement is because of my high frame rate. I've tried capping the frame rate in my Nvidia Control panel but it hasn't worked so far...

Anyways, I've been really enjoying it so far. I've only just gotten to the point where I get to play Victoria's grandfather (who had beautiful paintings. I would love one for myself) so I just wanted to see if anyone else  had any thoughts. I already have Still Life 2, so, I sort of want to speed run to play that one, too, but, I'm trying to be patient.

So, have any of you guys played Still Life? Or never heard of it? Any recommendations for similar games of the time period or even modern throwbacks?",2,1745603577.0,HorrorGaming,0,1.0,False

My doc decided to try desoxyn and I've started today with 5mg once a day.

And oh my god what a revelation it was. Most of the day I was calm and able to think straight how never before in my entire life. For the first time in my life, I was actually able to have a plan of things to do in my head and do those things in order and attentively, not hyperfocusing like ""one thing at a time feels up my entire brain and once I'm merely distracted there is no way back to what I was doing before"". And it seems like it could be a life-changing medication.

But there is a catch. Euphoria.
At some point I've started to feel so enormously happy like I'm high.
It lasted for few hours and then flattened out.

In the evening, I feel weird sensation of dissatisfaction, dysphoria. I kinda want to go back to that euphoria, but this urge is not so strong to be uncontrollable at the moment. I've decided to go buy some decaf coffee but to do so, it took me really forcing myself to leave the house.

This feeling of dysphoria at the end of the day, it scares me and I don't want it to grow into abuse of medication.

It appears to my this dysphoric sensation is a consequence of a previous euphoria and clarity.

I've heard that euphoria may be present during first days on desoxyn and is normal, but I'm afraid it might trigger unhealthy behavior and urge to take more meds than I'm supposed to. It is something you normally fight with when on desoxyn? Or it flattens out eventually leaving only concentration-related benefits?

I really want this to work since it seems like it can allow me to stop being amoeba-like ADHD creature I am, and, hopefully, have a full life, but addiction is not something I can afford gambling with.

As of now, the product they released costs $24.99.

I don't exactly know much about caffeine in general, so I read information to make this post. If I am wrong about anything, please kindly correct me. I'm pretty sure Fisch is a kids game (not saying that adults cannot play it, I'm just saying that it is intended for a younger audience.) so, I don't quite understand why they made a caffeine based product and stuck their name onto it.

I did some research before making this post about the dosage limit of caffeine a teenager can consume between the ages of 12 and 18 (which is very older than the playerbase of the game as of right now), and multiple sources say it's 100 mg of caffeine per day (not mentioning the fact that some sources say that teenagers within those ages should not consume caffeine at all.) Also, most, if not all sources, say that a child under the age of 12 years old should not consume any caffeine whatsoever, due to it causing issues such as irritability, nervousness, rapid heartbeat, and anxiety (and more dangerous issues in high doses.)  
  
With that being said, this energy drink contains 180 mg of caffeine per serving, which is almost twice the dosage limit a teenager between the ages of 12 to 18 can receive per day.

[Two sites say that the caffeine limit for ages 12 - 18 is 100 milligrams. There are multiple more sites that claim this. I did not list them here due to it not being needed, and it would also take up unnecessary space.](https://preview.redd.it/i433of68h0xe1.png?width=589&format=png&auto=webp&s=31d78058013965602b348eb1d280db94df37afbb)

Source for first paragraph: [How much caffeine is safe for your teen? | Riley Children's Health](https://www.rileychildrens.org/connections/how-much-caffeine-is-safe-for-your-teen)

Source for second paragraph: [Can Kids Drink Coffee and Caffeine?](https://health.clevelandclinic.org/is-caffeine-bad-for-kids)

\-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Some sources say that currently there is no proven safe dose of caffeine for children under 12.  
  
So, to make a quick summary: A child under the age of 12 should not consume products including caffeine at all, and a teenager between the ages of 12 to 18 is limited to consuming up to 100 mg of caffeine per day. I am pretty sure most of the playerbase of Fisch is under the age of 12 which means they should not consume caffeine at all, but even if that's not the case and they are over the age of 12, they are still limited to consuming up to 100 mg of caffeine per day. The product Fisch released and is promoting to (mostly) children has a serving that includes 180 mg of caffeine, which is over the limit I mentioned above.

[The nutrition statement image of the Tropical Kraken Surge energy drink. It can be found at the products page, which will be listed in the end of this post. Inside of the marked area, it mentions that it is \\""not recommended for children\\"".](https://preview.redd.it/2jzflg5bn0xe1.png?width=834&format=png&auto=webp&s=2987e65a8099d89faed1d26e976989109cf9d328)

The energy drink's site says in the nutrition statement that it is ***not recommended for children***, but not that it's dangerous to children and could pose danger. Plus, it's being advertised to a audience that is 90% children. I doubt anyone would find this and purchase it, unless they play Fisch, that is.

I do not know why I wrote this, but my whole point here is that caffeine can be dangerous for a teenager/child, especially in these doses, and Fisch is promoting this product to hundreds of thousands of children. By the way, before you immediately go in the comments and say that ""it's the distributors fault, not Fisch's fault"", keep in mind that Fisch is the one advertising this product to children, and Fisch is the one who partnered with this brand, and I repeat, this is a brand that makes energy drinks. Saying that it's ""not recommended for children"" in the most obscure and untraceable part of the product's page Is not going to stop little Timmy from ordering it, due to you (Fisch) telling him to buy it.

Don't send hate to anyone, I personally play Fisch myself and I enjoy it, but I just wanted to point this out, cause it seems really weird to me that they did this.

For context, I have really loved most of Emily Henry's books, and have been a fan since People We Meet on Vacation came out. My ""rankings"" of her other books are more or less Beach Read > Happy Place > Funny Story > People We Meet on Vacation > Book Lovers > and now, sadly, Great Big Beautiful Life.

Below is my review, copy & pasted from my Goodreads, but I'd love to hear others' thoughts (who either agree or disagree with me!) and I don't really use Goodreads as a way to interact with people much - so this felt like a promising place to start a conversation. It's a bit more of a word vomit rant in some parts; I just needed to get my initial thoughts down.

\*\* spoiler alert \*\*

2.25 stars  
I am sad. This is the lowest I have ever rated an Emily Henry book.  
This got much better in the second half, but there was absolutely no chemistry, build-up, or slow burn to make this relationship feel like something I cared about. I appreciated EH's attempt at branching out with the multi-generational storyline; it was very interesting and well done. I just couldn't care less about the relationship between Hayden and Alice. There wasn't even really any tension before he kisses her like 80 pages in???? And all of the ""sex but not sex"" scenes were supposed to build the tension but just felt sooo unrealistic and frankly a little annoying (you people ARE having sex. just not the penetrative type). All they ever do together is eat at midnight diners and make out; you are on a beautiful coastal island a few hours a way from a fun city. Go do something! 

The 'mystery of Margaret's life' plotline was good. I figured from the get-go that Jodi, Margaret, and Alice/or Hayden would all be related in some way so it was fun to see that play out. Definitely way too similar to Seven Husbands, but I enjoyed this aspect of the book overall. The back-and-forth between Margaret's story and Alice & Hayden's story was a great format choice, and I felt relatively intrigued into both plotlines throughout most of the book. The grandfathers & dad & mom, Margaret, Laura, Cosmo, etc. were all very well fleshed out characters with strong characterizations, imo.

In terms of writing: it felt weaker than we saw in like, Beach Read or Happy Place. The female m/c was much less relatable & realistic than I usually come to find in her books. I just wasn't really rooting for her in any meaningful way; her rough relationship with her mom, her sister's mystery illness, and her dad's death all felt like a thrown-in side plots to give her some depth (whereas m/c's like January & Harriet just have what feels like more ""built in"" depth, not forced like Alice). And how many times will she just ""go to get coffee""? I will say EH seems to have killed the italics bug for the most part - one of my biggest grievances with her writing in some of her other novels.

Also a few plot inconsistencies in a way that I have never noticed in any other Em Henry book: WHAT DID ALICE DO WITH HER PLACE IN LA???? Did she just pack up and leave an apartment for what turns out to be months and presumably longer since she ends up living with her mom? Did she end her lease before coming to Georgia, even though it was only supposed to be for what could have been a few days if she didn't get offered the job??? Was it mentioned and I just missed this??? I guess it's not too important, but I was wondering the whole time! I feel like Em Henry never leaves inconsistencies like this so it was bugging me. And at the end: WHY DO THEY NAME THEIR BABY AFTER HAYDEN'S GREAT AUNT (who was dead long before he met Margaret)? Her middle name being Grace makes a \*bit\* more sense as an ode to Margaret, but wouldn't Nicollet have made more sense as an ode to both Hayden's mom and his lost familial line?!

Alice's random situationship with Theo also felt so unnecessary and adds literally nothing to the plot/her character besides the ""hot date"" comment that turns into her moment with Hayden. Theo could have been a moment of ""aha"" for Alice - like, ""oh I'm kind of letting this guy drag me around and walk all over me. Maybe I should tell him so."" Instead she just kind of acknowledges this via her friends, and then just... forgets about him, in favor of Hayden.

All that being said, it was still fun to read, which is usually all I'm \*really\* looking for out of contemporary romance books. I guess my expectations are slightly higher for EH than some other authors who write in this genre. I didn't feel like it was worth the wait and anticipation for this book. A bit of a let-down in terms of how great some of EH's other books are. Maybe I'm just over the way she does the 'grumpy x sunshine trope' because I cringed a few times at the forced characterizations in this novel. There are so many great ways to write a romance book and it seems like it's gotten to a point where she choses from like, 3 options every time.

What hurts the most is knowing I might not be there on her big day to witness it all. tsk.

My github issue is here [https://github.com/karpathy/nanoGPT/issues/606](https://github.com/karpathy/nanoGPT/issues/606)



I'm trying to build a very small language model. Basically I read [Tiny Stories research paper](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2305.07759) in which the authors used very simple dataset of tiny stories generated from gpt-3 and gpt-4 outputs.. They showed that even models with 2 layers can generate coherent sentences.. These are some of the example repos [https://huggingface.co/raincandy-u/TinyStories-656K](https://huggingface.co/raincandy-u/TinyStories-656K), [https://huggingface.co/roneneldan/TinyStories-1M](https://huggingface.co/roneneldan/TinyStories-1M)

Now I got curious that how small a language model can be to generate coherent text but not only on a very simple dataset like Tiny Stories but rather a bit more complex and diverse dataset.. Basically I wanted to see that does model size has any link to dataset complexity and diversity.

So I downloaded Andrej Karpathy's [nanoGPT repo](https://github.com/karpathy/nanoGPT), Andrej Karpathy's [minBPE repo](https://github.com/karpathy/minbpe/), made some changes and created my own github repo [GATw](https://github.com/SrijanSriv211/GATw).

I scraped some wikipedia text, download chat-alpaca's and more such dataset. I kept the dataset neither too complex and diverse neither too simple like Tiny Stories.. I think I did a good job there.. I copy pasted all the text from some websites, research papers and books and made it webtext. Here's an image of my dataset folder.

I trained the tokenizer with `vocab_size = 4092`, `special_tokens = [""<|sot|>"", ""<|eot|>"", ""<|pad|>"", ""<|sep|>""]` on first 50 million chars of the dataset which contains \~200 million chars.. After training I tokenized my entire dataset which gave me this:

Ordered a large mocha, preferred it made a certain way (mocha powder in the milk, not the espresso or something) but he was really kind and talkative. Kind of person who's drink goes in the queue before he's in line. Everyone called him ""Mocha Dan"" for obvious beverage reasons.

One time he comes in during a rush with a friend (not normal). He gets to the till and we hand him his mocha as his friend places an order. She laughs ""haha, Dan, you really do come here too much! They already know your drink?"" Everyone on the line starts talking, like 5 people: ""Oh sure, we love Mocha Dan. Everyone knows Mocha Dan! I'd die for Mocha Dan."" I can see her smile starting to become fake, hiding some uncomfortable emotion.

Me: ""It's because he always orders a special mocha, it has nothing to do with his skin colour."" The RELIEF that washed over this woman. Everyone had a long laugh about it. But dear god, I am so glad I caught it.

*Nathaniel repeats this ugly phrase for almost a fifth time in this day. After he finally got a long waited grant on his life researches , he immediately bought a big lab , size is not any smaller than his own ego,  but the phrase ""Size doesn't matter"" seem to strike poor Nathaniel really hard in past months. Despite having the latest technologies, an extraordinary intellect and , of course,  a burning desire to show people in this world how the true power looks like , he couldn't move in his ""Life Formula"" project. No matter how much he tried , no matter how many frogs he tortured with electricity,  it all been ending with quite predictable outcome. Death. Nathaniel already hates this word with every fibre of his soul. He needs to overcome it , make it surrender to his intellect and then bottle up in glass , just like anything normal and explored could be. But instead death tricks him once again and again, leaving a burned and lifeless corpses of animals in his lab. This loud failure itches in Nathaniel's tired mind , whispering weird ideas of how limited is current science, what he wont be able to fulfil his destiny if this will prolong to be this way. But Nathaniel , who was pretty sure about science,  been ignoring all these thoughts for now. He walks towards first floor of his own house to heat up a cold dinner which was consisted from a once boiled carrot and a very weird looking piece of meat. Nathaniel's incredible brain tells him to better not eat this piece of rotten flesh although hunger speaks louder , as well this deafening failure silences all the voices of reason. After eating this quite pathetic ""Dinner"" , tormented Nathaniel heads up to his empty bedroom,  covering himself with a thin blanket...

""BRAVO,  BRAVO!""

""New step of evolution has been achieved!""

""My congratulations , Mister Nathaniel!""

*Everyone cheer him up in an seemingly endless crowd , a moustached man comes towards him with a golden statue of Nathaniel and with almost a welling up tears hands this big piece of gold to Nathaniel.*
???: ""Please,  accept our gift , Mr.Nathaniel! Its the least we can do for now!""

*Nathaniel rises his hand to get the reward he deserves and grabs...Blanket. Of course it was just a dream what have no connection to reality. For now. It almost feels like the Destiny itself tried to joke on poor scientist by teasing him with the rewards he can achieve yet doesn't give a ways to do it...But wait...Is it really doesn't help? After almost a year of fruitless efforts,  idea of using quite... questionable ways of science seems rather appealing and logical. Occultism? Of course! Soul science? With a pleasure. Although , Nathaniel stops on occultism in his mind while making coffee in dirty cup.*

*Nathaniel walks through cold wind , stepping past the railways and trying to orientate in this ""white darkness"". Finally he finds a sign with ""Library"" typed on it and walks in that direction , reaching a very big building and entering in it. He throws his coat towards nearby stand , of course, missing, and walks towards the gigantic bookshelf.*

Nathaniel: ""Excuse me , Miss , im trying to find an Occultism book...Yeah , yeah , no need for these ""Its not real"" , just show me where it is , babe...""

*Consultant gives him an annoyed look and silently points at one of the highest bookshelves and then walks away to not interact with such a rude man. Nathaniel quickly gets the book and finds out it was not really an Occultism book...It was just a guide on artifacts! Nathaniel was almost ready to scream on poor lady but then his attention catches a heavy looking book on one of pages...""Occultism Book , Tome 1"" Here it is. This is what he needs! As the goofy book says , this grimoire has been buried in the ground two decades ago by inquisitors who though it will dispel all the dark curses this book brought. The possible location is...Peru. Nathaniel is ready to curse everyone and everything in this world as he sees this. Peru! God damn Peru! He barely manages to buy himself a food after wasting all his grant and now he needs to save up for a Peru travel?! What a nonsense. Of course Nathaniel accepted that. Hunger is better than unreleased potential of domination and fame. He WILL get this book no matter what and no matter what come on his way and it WILL help him with his research. Nathaniel believes in that so it must be truth , yes?

Well, and yes and no. Lets leave our dear Nathaniel starving in his silly lab and talk about the Book itself for a bit of time. This Book , according to many legends what surround it, has been written by a Lucifer himself to give people more of free will. And what can give more free will than ability to use magic? Unfortunately , just like with Eve , Lucifer been pretty naive about thinking people will use it for good. The Book immediately got into hands of evil people who started to cause a chaos with its unlimited power. But the truth is what Book been made with kind intentions by a pure Angel, People's negativity and violence corrupts its true purpose , causing a very interesting reaction. Every spell now withers the reader, taking away their precious lifetime in exchange for the spell becoming true. Thanks god this book got into hands of pretty wise people ,at least for once ,who decided to bury it under ground to free the world from even greater evil. Seems like their plan is about to be ruined by just an ordinary human who craves for power and admiration, but will everything end good this time? Well, this is something we will find out slightly later.*",9,1745603219.0,HazbinHotelOCArt,4,1.0,False

Ello ello, I'm Lewis, 30M and from the UK.

I'll try and keep it short and sweet. Unlike me, I'm your typical tall skinny white guy.

I'm on the search for a new bestie to join me on this journey called life. Someone to share the day with, build a connection, have some fun, live love laugh toaster bath. I'm interested in investing in something long term with someone who we can be out silly selves.

I've come out of a long term relationship a while back and kind of missing that close connection with someone. I'm not looking for anything romantic, but I am looking for someone who wants a deeply connected friendship.

This isn't for everyone but ideally I'm looking for someone kind of clingy. Someone who wants to talk all day, checks their phone for messages from each other, doesn't care about stuff like double messaging or spamming the f*ck out of each other. Someone to get excited to check your phone for.


I'm like an onion. Peel back the layers to find out what's underneath. Try not to cry while you do it. I like my humour how I like my coffee, dark. I will probably p*ss you off.

Some stuff about me so you know I'm not a blank slate ready to get smashed to death by the hammer of life:

- Recently started the gym. About time I started taking better care of myself. I need someone to hold me accountable!
- When I leave the house I like to cycle, hike explore and occasionally socialise with the unlucky sods I call friends.
- Heavy metal fan - You'll sometimes find me ar a concert/gig with the above mentioned friends. Bloodstock 2025!
- I play games. Currently playing POE2 but was obsessed with Satisfsctory the past two months. You'll usually find me AFKing on OSRS.
- I've been creating an android game for the past year or so in my spare time. Programming is hard at times but very rewarding. 
- I also have a 5 year old daughter with my ex. Would be great to connect with other parents.

What I'm looking for in you:
- Age 21-40 - Not opposed to people outside this range but Ideally I'm looking for people around my age
- We don't need 100% compatibility on hobbies/likes, just show interest.
- Timezones don't matter. I work a crazy schedule
- Wanting to be supportive of each other and push each other
- Can hold a conversation and willing to put the effort in.
- Silly/chaotic vibes preferred

Celine Tate found out her husband, Adam Alvarez, was cheating on her.

The other woman was a college student.

Today was Adam's birthday. Celine had spent the whole day preparing a special dinner for him. Just then, his forgotten phone buzzed with a text.

She picked it up and saw a message from the college student. ""I fell while grabbing the cake. It hurts so much… Sobs…""

Attached was a photo—no face, just legs.

The woman wore pulled-up white socks with black round-toed shoes. She pulled up her blue-and-white skirt just enough to reveal her long, flawless legs.

Her fair knees were visibly reddened from the fall. The youthful vibrancy of her figure, paired with her coy words, carried an air of forbidden allure.

Rumor had it that wealthy businessmen tend to favor this type when choosing a lover.

Celine's grip on the phone tightened until her knuckles turned white.

Soon, another message came. ""Mr. Alvarez, meet me at Elysian Hotel tonight. I want to celebrate your birthday.""

It was Adam's birthday, and his mistress had planned a celebration for him.

Grabbing her handbag, Celine headed straight for Elysian Hotel. She had to see this woman with her own eyes.

…

When Celine arrived at the hotel, she was ready to storm in.

But before she could, she spotted her parents, Hayden Tate and Lucy Garcia. Shocked, she approached them. ""Dad, Mom, what are you doing here?""

The two froze for a moment before exchanging glances. Their eyes flickered as they said, ""Oh, Celine, your sister's back from abroad. We came here to drop her off.""

Carly Tate?

Through the gleaming floor-to-ceiling window, Celine spotted Carly inside. She froze instantly.

Inside, Carly was wearing the same blue-and-white skirt from the photo. So, the college girl was her sister.

Carly had always been a stunner, hailed as Mercity's ""Scarlet Rose"". Her legs, in particular, were the stuff of legends. They were the most beautiful in all of Mercity. Men practically worshiped her.

Now, those famous legs had ensnared Adam.

Celine almost laughed at the absurdity of it. She turned to her parents. ""So I'm the last to find out.""

Hayden's face twisted awkwardly. ""Celine, Mr. Alvarez never liked you.""

Lucy chimed in, ""Exactly. Do you know how many women in Mercity would kill to be with him? Better your sister than some stranger.""

Upon hearing that, Celine clenched her fists. ""I'm your daughter too!""

With that, she spun on her heels to leave.

Just then, Lucy's voice rang out behind her. ""Celine, tell me something. Has Mr. Alvarez ever touched you?""

Celine froze mid-step.

Hayden said sharply, ""Don't act like we owe you anything. Back then, Mr. Alvarez and Carly were the It couple in everyone's eyes. We only asked you to marry him on Carly's behalf after he fell into a coma from the car accident.""

Lucy gave Celine a disdainful once-over. ""Look at yourself, Celine. Three years as a housewife, running around after your husband. Meanwhile, Carly's a lead ballerina now—a true swan. You? You're just a frumpy little duckling. Be reasonable and give Mr. Alvarez back to Carly.""

Those words felt like a knife to Celine's heart. She blinked back her tears and turned to walk away.

…

By the time Celine returned to the villa, it was already dark. She had given the housekeeper, Sofia Dotson, the day off. The house was empty, with no lights on, leaving it cold and desolate.

Celine sat alone at the dining table in the darkness.

The table was set with a feast, but the food had long gone cold. Her homemade cake sat untouched, with the words ""Happy Birthday, honey"" scrawled across it.

Celine stared at it, her eyes stinging. It all felt like a cruel joke, just like her life.

Adam and Carly had always been the It couple in their circle. Everyone knew that Carly, the Scarlet Rose, was Adam's heart and soul. But three years ago, a sudden car accident left Adam in a coma, and Carly vanished without a trace.

The Tate family had brought Celine from the countryside and forced her to marry the comatose Adam.

When she found out that the man lying in that hospital bed was Adam—the man she had always loved—she didn't hesitate. She married him without a second thought.

After the wedding, Adam remained in a coma for three years. During that time, Celine took care of him tirelessly, never leaving his side. She gave up going out and socializing. Her sole focus was on his recovery.

She became a housewife dedicated to nothing but him. In the end, her devotion brought him back to life.

Celine lit the candles on the cake with a flick of the lighter.

The dim glow flickered, casting her reflection in the mirror in front of her. She looked at herself—the housewife in her dull black-and-white dress. She was lifeless, boring, and unremarkable.

Meanwhile, Carly had flourished into a lead ballerina. She was young, vibrant, and beautiful.

Celine was the ugly duckling, while Carly was the swan.

After waking, Adam had abandoned the ugly duckling and returned to the swan.

So, her sacrifice for the last three years had been for nothing.

Adam didn't love her, but she loved him with all her heart.

It was said that the one who fell in love first was always the loser in the relationship. And today, Adam had made her lose everything.

Her eyes filled with tears, and she blew out the candles. The house plunged back into darkness.

Just then, headlights pierced the night as Adam's Rolls-Royce Phantom sped up the driveway and parked on the driveway.

Celine's heart skipped a beat. He was back. She had thought he wouldn't return home tonight.

Soon, the villa's front door swung open. A tall, handsome figure stepped into view, bringing with him the chill of the night air. Adam was home.

The Alvarez family had long been royalty in Mercity. Adam, the heir to the Alvarez family, had been a business prodigy since childhood.

By 16, he had earned dual master's degrees from the prestigious Haffard University. By the time he reached adulthood, his first company had made waves on Finance Street. Now, he sat at the helm of Alvarez Group, crowned as Mercity's wealthiest man.

Adam strode in with his long legs. His voice was low and pleasant but distant. ""Why didn't you turn on the lights?""

With a flick of his hand, he turned on the wall light.

The harsh light made Celine squint. When she opened her eyes again, she looked at Adam.

He was wearing a hand-tailored black suit, every inch the picture of perfection. His perfect proportions and regal air made him the object of desire for many women.

Celine glanced at him. ""It's your birthday.""

Adam's face was a mask of indifference. His eyes lazily swept over the table. ""Don't waste your time. I don't celebrate birthdays.""

Celine sneered and asked, ""You don't celebrate birthdays, or you just don't want to celebrate it with me?""

Adam barely spared her a glance, as if he didn't want to waste time on her. ""Think whatever you want.""

Without another word, he turned and started toward the stairs.

This had always been their dynamic. No matter how hard she tried, she couldn't get close to him.

Celine stood up and. Looking at his indifferent back, she said, ""Today is your birthday. I'd like to give you a birthday gift.""

Adam didn't stop or turn to look at her. ""I don't need it.""

Celine smiled again. ""Let's get a divorce, Adam.""

Adam had already placed one foot on the stairs when he suddenly paused. He spun on his heel, his deep eyes locking onto her.

Chapter 2

Celine looked at Adam. Her voice was soft but unwavering as she repeated, ""Let's get a divorce, Adam. Do you like this birthday gift?""

Adam's expression remained indifferent. ""Are you suddenly asking for a divorce because I didn't spend my birthday with you?""

""Carly's back, isn't she?"" Celine asked.

At the mention of Carly, Adam's lips curled into a sneer. He stepped toward Celine with long strides. ""Are you bothered by her?""

As the youngest business mogul in Mercity, Adam exuded a powerful presence built from his wealth, status, and influence. As he advanced toward her, Celine instinctively took a step back. Her delicate back hit the wall.

At that moment, the world around her seemed to darken. Adam had already closed the distance, placing one hand against the wall beside her, trapping her between his solid chest and the wall.

He looked down at her with a mocking smile. ""Everyone in Mercity knows that Carly is the one I'm going to marry. Didn't you know that when you schemed to become my wife? You didn't mind back then, so why are you bothered now?""

Celine's face turned pale.

Yes, Adam was supposed to marry Carly. If it weren't for the accident, she would never have had the chance to marry him.

She would never forget the day he woke up. When he saw it was Celine beside him, the disappointment and coldness in his eyes were unmistakable.

Since then, they had slept in separate rooms, and he had never touched her.

He loved Carly.

Celine had always known that, but…

She looked deeply at Adam's face. Slowly, it began to merge with the image of the youthful boy he had once been.

""Adam, do you really not remember me?"" Celine thought.

It seemed that only she had stayed in the past.

Never mind. She would take these three years as her fulfilling her misguided love.

Celine pushed down the bitterness and pain in her heart. ""Adam, let's end this platonic marriage.""

Adam suddenly raised an eyebrow. ""Platonic?"" His deep voice was full of mockery.

He reached out and cupped her chin. His thumb brushed over her soft lips, pressing against them in an almost teasing motion. ""So that's why you want a divorce? You want to have sex?""

Celine's face flushed bright red, like a tomato.

That wasn't what she meant.

Now, his thumb was pressed on her crimson lips, rubbing with a malicious yet seductive force. Celine hadn't expected such a flirtatious side from a man so hot and refined.

He was actually playing with her lips with his finger.

Adam had never been this close to Celine before. She always hid behind those oversized black-framed glasses, wearing plain clothes, making herself look like an older woman.

But up close, Adam noticed how small her face was. Beneath those glasses, her features were delicate and striking, and those eyes were mesmerizing.

Her lips were soft, too.

Where his finger pressed, the red faded for a moment, then returned with a slight bounce. Her lips were not just soft but tender as well. It was an enticing sight that made him want to kiss her.

Adam's eyes darkened. ""I didn't expect you to have such strong desires. Do you long for a man in you?""

Suddenly, a loud slap echoed in the villa. Celine had slapped him hard across the face.

Adam's head jerked to the side.

Celine's fingers trembled with anger. She had been too humble in her love, allowing her heart to be trampled. How dare he humiliate her like this?

Furious, she said, ""I know you've never let go of Carly. Now I'll make it easier for you. I'll return the position as Mrs. Alvarez to her!""

Adam's expression instantly turned icy, like a sheet of frost had fallen over his handsome face. He had never been slapped before—not by anyone.

He stared at her coldly. ""Celine, you thought you could just marry me when you wanted and divorce me when you felt like it? What do you take me for?""

Celine sneered. ""A plaything, of course.""

Adam couldn't believe what he heard.

Celine fought back the pain in her heart and lied, ""You're just a plaything I took from Carly. Now I'm tired of playing with you. I want to throw you away.""

Adam's expression grew darker. ""Fine, Celine. You want a divorce? Alright. But don't come crawling back to me, begging to get back together!""

With that, he stormed upstairs and slammed the door to his study.

Celine seemed to lose all her strength. Her delicate body slowly slid down the wall. She crouched on the carpet, wrapping her arms around herself.

""I won't love you anymore, Adam,"" she swore in her mind.

…

The next morning, Sofia entered Adam's study.

Adam sat at his desk, reviewing documents. He was well-known for being a workaholic.

""Mr. Alvarez,"" Sofia called out.

Adam didn't look up. Sofia could tell that he was in a bad mood. The air around him seemed to freeze.

She carefully placed a cup of coffee on the table. ""Mr. Alvarez, Mrs. Alvarez made this cup of coffee for you.""

Adam's hand holding the pen faltered. The cold expression on his face softened slightly.

Was Celine trying to make peace?

To be fair, she was a good wife. She cooked according to his preferences, hand-washed his clothes, and took care of every detail of his daily life.

Adam picked up the cup of coffee and took a sip.

Celine definitely made this. It was exactly how he liked it.

Still, he was angry. She had slapped him last night, and that anger would not be easily soothed. A cup of coffee wasn't going to fix this.

Adam asked, ""Did Celine realize her mistake?""

Sofia looked at him with a strange look. ""…Mrs. Alvarez has left.""

Adam froze, his eyes snapping up to meet Sofia's.

Just then, she took something out. ""She left with her suitcase, Mr. Alvarez. She asked me to give this to you before she left.""

As Adam took the paper and opened it, the words ""Divorce Agreement"" jumped out at him.

Adam was left speechless. He had thought she was trying to make peace.

Sofia hesitated. ""Mrs. Alvarez said you should finish the coffee and sign the papers as soon as possible.""

Adam glared at the cup of coffee. ""Throw it out! All of it!""

Sofia thought he was enjoying the coffee earlier. Why didn't he like it anymore?

However, she didn't dare voice her thoughts. She quickly grabbed the coffee and left the room.

Adam's face darkened. He scanned the divorce agreement and realized Celine agreed to leave with nothing—no alimony, no property.

He sneered bitterly. She certainly had some nerve. She didn't want a single dime from him. What could a country girl like her possibly expect to live on without money?

He remembered how, three years ago, she had done everything she could to become his wife. Wasn't it all about the money?

Then his gaze fell on the reason for the divorce written by Celine in neat handwriting. ""The husband's health does not allow him to fulfill his marital duties.""

Adam was rendered speechless. His face flushed with rage.

This damned woman!

He grabbed his phone and immediately dialed Celine's number.

The phone rang a few times before her clear, calm voice came through. ""Hello?""

Chapter 3

Adam pressed his thin lips into a hard line. ""Celine Tate, get back here now!""

Celine chuckled. ""You want me to come back just because you say so? We're divorced, Adam. I'm not going to put up with you anymore.""

Adam gritted his teeth. ""I'm giving you one more chance to rewrite the reason for the divorce.""

Celine's smile widened. ""Is there something wrong with what I wrote? You've been awake for half a year now, but in all this time, you haven't even held my hand.

""You were in a coma for three years. Although your health seems fine now, I seriously doubt your manhood is working. You should see a doctor. I sincerely hope you can regain your masculinity soon!""

Adam was speechless. The veins on his forehead were visibly pulsing.

This woman had really lost it!

""I'll show you how capable I am in bed one day, Celine Tate!"" he gritted out.

""Sorry, you don't have that chance anymore.""

""Celine!""

A couple of beeps sounded, and the call was abruptly disconnected.

Adam seethed in rage. But before he could vent, all he heard was the busy tone.

Celine Tate!

…

Celine had already arrived at her best friend, Robin Smith's apartment.

When she hung up, Robin burst into laughter and gave her a thumbs-up. ""That was perfect, Celine! He's probably so mad right now he might burst a vein.""

Celine felt that it was because she had been too humble in the past that he had come to see himself as so superior.

People should love themselves before loving others. It was crucial to prioritize one's happiness.

Robin added, ""When Carly found out Mr. Alvarez was in a coma three years ago, she left him right away. But now that he's awake, he's going after her again. Honestly, it's better to be rid of a man like him.""

Celine unwrapped a piece of candy and popped it into her mouth. The sweet taste seemed to mask the bitterness in her heart. ""Robin, that's the difference between being loved and unloved.""

The one who was loved could act without fear, while the one who was unloved always remained cautious and insecure.

Robin glanced at Celine, who had already eaten a whole bunch of candies. She pulled Celine to her feet. ""Cheer up, Celine! When you let go of one tree, you'll realize you've gained a whole forest. I'll hire eight escorts and throw you a singles' party tonight!""

Celine laughed, pressing her forehead.

At that moment, Robin reached up and took off Celine's black-framed glasses. She tossed them straight into the trash.

""My glasses!"" Celine went to retrieve them.

Robin stopped her. ""Celine, you're too used to wearing those glasses from all your academic work. You should learn from Carly and dress yourself up beautifully.""

Celine remembered how her parents called her an ugly duckling while Carly was the swan.

It seemed that it wasn't just her parents who thought so. Adam probably saw her as an ugly duckling too.

Robin pulled Celine out the door. ""Come on. I'm taking you out for a full makeover—hair, nails, outfit, everything. I want Adam and the others to open their eyes and see just how beautiful you are!""

As they were leaving, Robin suddenly remembered something. ""By the way, Celine, you really don't want any of Mr. Alvarez's money?""

""I have my own money,"" Celine replied.

""Well, then you're leaving that money to Carly. She'll probably thank you.""

Celine was rendered speechless.

""Where's the card Mr. Alvarez gave you?""

Adam had always been generous and had given Celine a gold-plated black card, but she'd never used it.

Celine pulled the card out of her purse and said with a wink, ""Mr. Alvarez can foot the bill for our shopping today.""

…

Club 1996 had long been the playground for the wealthy elite of Mercity, where the rich heirs and socialites spent their money without a second thought.

That night, the DJ kept the music going, and the crowd danced wildly.

In one of the luxurious booths, Adam sat in the center, wearing a black shirt and black pants. His sleeves were rolled up to reveal his muscular forearms and a watch worth millions. He looked every bit the hot, aristocratic figure that had women in the club constantly looking his way.

Sitting beside him was his good friend, Benjamin Goodwin—the heir to the Goodwin family—along with a few other trust fund babies.

Benjamin laughed loudly. ""What's this I hear, Adam? Celine wants a divorce?""

The others joined in the laughter.

""Who doesn't know how much Celine is in love with you, Mr. Alvarez? She even wanted to marry you when you were in a coma,"" one of them said. ""There's no way she'd leave you now!""

""We should make a bet to see how many days Celine can resist before reaching out to Mr. Alvarez,"" another chimed in.

Benjamin said, ""I bet she won't even last a day. She'll probably send Adam a message any minute now. Haha!""

Adam's face, however, was shadowed and stern, showing clear signs of anger. He pulled out his phone and opened his chat with Celine.

The last message was from the night before. Celine had sent him a picture of a bowl of chicken bone broth with the message, ""Honey, even though your bone density is fine now, you still need to drink more chicken bone broth. Remember to come home early.""

As he scrolled up, there were daily messages from Celine. He had never replied. Not once.

But tonight, there was nothing from her, and Adam felt a surge of frustration in his chest.

Just then, a notification pinged, signaling the arrival of a new message.

Benjamin immediately chimed in, ""I knew it! Celine's messaging Adam right now!""

The notification pinged repeatedly as several messages came through in quick succession.

Everyone burst out laughing. ""I knew Celine couldn't hold back, but I didn't expect her to be so eager.""

Benjamin urged, ""Adam, quick, check what she's saying. She must be crying and begging you to get back together with her.""

Adam's eyes twitched. She had messaged him?

If she wanted to make peace, why all that hostility earlier? Wasn't she the one acting tough this morning?

The moment Adam opened the message, he froze.

Benjamin read it aloud. ""Dear VVIP, your card ending in 0975 has been charged 800 dollars at Dazzling Nails.""

Everyone went silent, staring in confusion.

Adam scrolled up and saw a series of transaction messages.

Celine had spent two thousand dollars at Urban Glow Salon, 86 thousand dollars at Chanel, and 24 thousand dollars at Louis Vuitton.

There were no messages asking for reconciliation, just notifications of her spending.

The group was dumbfounded. It felt like Celine had slapped them all across the face.

Adam's face darkened as he slammed his phone onto the table. It wasn't the money that bothered him. It was that she had gone straight to spend his money after their divorce.

The woman who had been so obedient and dependent on him for the past three years suddenly seemed to have shown her true colors.

Benjamin muttered, ""What's she playing at, Adam? She's getting her nails and hair done and went shopping for clothes. Is she trying to dress up like Carly?""

""Carly's the Scarlet Rose of Mercity, while Celine is just some country bumpkin. No matter how hard she tries, she'll never match up to her.""

""A swan is a swan, and an ugly duckling will forever be an ugly duckling. It will never turn into a swan.""

The group continued laughing at Celine.

At that moment, a commotion broke out in the club. Everyone's attention was focused on one place.

Someone gasped, ""You guys, look! An angel!""

Chapter 4

Celine had arrived.

After a full day of splurging at the mall, Robin whisked her off to Club 1996 for the ultimate single-woman celebration.

What Celine didn't expect was to run into Adam and his group. Naturally, she also heard their mocking remarks about her.

She recognized the people in the luxurious booth. They were part of Adam's social circle. Benjamin, in particular, was one of Adam's closest friends.

Back when Adam and Carly had their high-profile romance, everyone in the group adored Carly. Benjamin even treated her like Adam's wife.

In the past three years, Celine had never been able to integrate into their group. They made no effort to hide their disdain for her.

They'd slapped labels on her like ""desperate replacement bride"", ""ugly duckling"", and ""country bumpkin"".

When a man didn't love her partner, his friends wouldn't respect her either.

Robin's temper flared immediately. ""I'm going to tear their smug faces off!"" She started rolling up her sleeves.

Celine grabbed her arm firmly. ""Let it go, Robin. I'm divorced now. They're not worth the energy.""

Noticing Celine's calm and indifferent demeanor, Robin managed to rein in her frustration. As more and more eyes turned to Celine, calling her an angel, Robin's mood brightened. ""Let's go. Time for a singles party!""

Robin marched them to a luxury booth on the other side of the club. She waved her hand dramatically. ""Bring me all your male escorts!""

Back at Adam's booth, Benjamin and the other scions were still mocking Celine when they suddenly felt a sharp, icy gaze land on them.

They looked up to see Adam at the head of the booth, lazily lifting his sharp eyes to glance at them. His gaze was cold, displeased, and full of warning.

At once, the laughter froze on their faces. None of them dared to say another word about Celine.

Benjamin glanced at Adam. Even though Adam had never spared Celine a second look, she had tirelessly taken care of him for three years. Clearly, Adam still had some shred of sentiment left for her.

Just then, a wave of excitement rippled through the crowd. ""Such a beautiful angel!""

Angel? Where?

Benjamin followed everyone's gaze and immediately widened his eyes in surprise. ""Holy crap! That really is an angel!""

The others around him were equally mesmerized. ""When did an angel arrive in Mercity? And how come we've never seen her before?""

Benjamin tugged at Adam's sleeve. ""Adam, look at that angel!""

Adam was no stranger to women. He'd seen all types, from slender to curvy, so he wasn't interested in that ""angel"".

However, Celine's booth was directly across from his. The moment he looked up, his eyes landed on her.

Celine had ditched her thick-rimmed glasses, shedding her usual dullness and rigidity. Her tiny face was as fair as snow. Her naturally striking features exuded a fresh, otherworldly elegance. With her silky hair cascading over her shoulders, she looked like a living, breathing angel.

Adam's gaze lingered for two full seconds.

Benjamin was clearly thrilled. ""What do you think of that angel, Adam?""

One of the scions remarked, ""Mr. Alvarez won't be impressed. His type is more of a sweet beauty like Carly, not this cool, angelic vibe.""

""Yeah, but check out her legs! Those could definitely compete with Carly's,"" another added.

Celine, in a rare departure from her usual conservative style, was wearing a chic, short tweed dress that showed off her legs for the first time.

Her legs were perfectly toned, proportionate, and tantalizing. These were the kind of legs that made men's imaginations run wild. They were just as captivating as Carly's.

Adam glanced at the ""angel"" for two seconds and couldn't shake the feeling that this woman looked strangely familiar. He felt like he had seen her somewhere before.

Just then, a group of male escorts filed into the room, each one tall and hot. They lined up right in front of Celine.

Robin grinned. ""Celine, pick eight.""

Since Celine was celebrating her newfound freedom from a disastrous marriage, she decided to go all out. ""You, you, you… Stay.""

Benjamin was counting under his breath. ""One, two, three… eight. Did she just pick eight escorts at once?""

One of the scions chimed in, ""Why spend the money? All she has to do is ask, and we'd happily volunteer for free.""

Laughter erupted around the booth.

At this moment, Adam's phone buzzed again. It was a new transaction message. He picked it up to see what Celine paid for this time.

But this time…

""Dear VVIP, your card ending in 0975 has been charged 500,000 dollars at Club 1996 for eight escorts.""

Adam frowned at once. He reread the words ""eight escorts"" twice before snapping his gaze back toward the angel across the room.

The angel who had just splurged on eight escorts was actually Celine!

Adam was rendered speechless.

Eight escorts surrounded Celine and started pouring drinks for her one after another. ""Ladies, let's play a drinking game.""

Robin happily replied, ""Hell yeah! Let's do it!""

Celine lost the first round. An escort leaned in and held a glass to her lips. ""Here, let me help you drink.""

She took the drink, but the other escorts weren't having it. ""Why him? You drank his drink but not ours? Let us feed you too!""

Celine was feeling a little overwhelmed by the eager attention.

Across the room, Adam's sharp eyes narrowed dangerously. His chiseled jaw tightened as he stood and headed straight for Celine's booth.

Benjamin was taken aback. ""Adam! Where are you going?""

Celine was sipping her drink when a strong, defined hand reached over and grabbed her delicate wrist. He lifted her off the couch as easily as if she were a child.

Shocked, she looked up and was met with Adam's handsome face.

Celine froze for a moment, then quickly struggled to pull her wrist free from his grip. ""Let go of me, Adam!""

Adam's face was cold as he forcefully dragged her away.

Robin jumped to her feet. ""Hey! Adam! What are you doing? Let go of Celine!""

Benjamin and the scions who followed Adam were stunned, their faces filled with disbelief. They all wondered if they were hearing things.

""Celine? The angel is… Celine?""

""Is this the same Celine we've always known? The ugly duckling? She's actually gorgeous?""

Benjamin froze in place as he watched Adam drag the stunning figure away. ""Damn… Celine turned into a freaking angel the moment she ditched Adam.""

…

Adam's grip on Celine's wrist was unyielding. His strong hand was like an iron shackle. No matter how hard she fought, she couldn't break free. His long strides forced her to stumble along behind him.

""Let go of me, Adam!"" she shouted.

Just then, Adam swung his hand, and Celine's delicate back slammed into the cold wall. Her vision went dark as his tall, imposing figure pressed in, trapping her against the wall.

Danger flared in his eyes as he growled, ""Do you think I'm dead, Celine Tate? You're actually out here flirting with other men?""

Chapter 5

Celine frowned. ""What do you mean by flirting?""

Adam gritted his teeth. ""You're dressing like a slut!""

What? A slut?

""You better explain, Adam Alvarez!"" Celine snapped.

Adam lowered his gaze, eyeing her short dress. ""Your thighs are practically hanging out. Is that how desperate you are for people to look at your legs?""

Sure, her dress was a little on the shorter side, but Robin had chosen the dress for her.

She had said, ""You never show your legs, giving Carly the chance to flaunt hers. Tonight, let's show everyone who really has the best legs in Mercity.""

Celine raised an eyebrow. ""Seems like you were looking at my legs, Mr. Alvarez.""

Adam froze.

Celine leaned back against the wall, her posture lazy yet elegant. She slowly lifted her right leg and brushed her crystal heel against his ankle.

Adam stood there in tailored black slacks that highlighted his long legs, exuding an air of cold elegance and restraint.

From his ankle, Celine slowly trailed upward along his calf in a teasing, deliberate motion. It was both a seduction and a provocation.

Adam gave her a cold look. ""What are you doing?""

Celine smirked. ""Mr. Alvarez, whose legs do you prefer—mine or Carly's?""

Adam's gaze lingered on her, captivated by the delicate features of her face, which radiated an almost ethereal beauty. She looked like an otherworldly angel, yet here she was, boldly tempting him.

He'd noticed her beauty last night, hidden behind those black-framed glasses, but he hadn't expected her to be so striking.

However, there was something familiar about her face.

Celine's bright eyes sparkled with mischief. ""Has Carly ever tried to seduce you with her legs, Mr. Alvarez?""

Adam's breath hitched. He leaned closer to look at her. ""Celine, are you really such a slut? You think about men all day and even hired eight escorts!""

He avoided answering her question about Carly. That was perhaps the most polite way for a man to protect a woman.

His relationship with Carly had been a grand love story from their youthful, carefree days. Carly must have seduced him at some point. That was the only way to explain why she lingered so vividly in his memory.

Carly was truly blessed to have such a cold-hearted man remain devoted to her for so long. Adam must have never used a word like ""slut"" to describe her.

Though Celine was smiling, her eyes remained as cold as ice. ""Yes, Mr. Alvarez. There's an issue with your manhood. Since you can't satisfy me, I have to go find someone healthy. Let's get divorced already. If one man doesn't work, I'll find another who does.""

She said he had issues again! This woman was unbelievable!

Adam gripped her delicate jaw. ""Is this some sort of provocation? Are you so desperate to find out if I have issues?""

What?

Celine froze.

Adam leaned in close, his lips hovering near hers with an almost teasing proximity. Yet his words were icy and detached. ""Don't kid yourself, Celine. I'll never touch you. The one I love is Carly.""

The one he loved was Carly.

He didn't even need to say it. Celine already knew. Still, hearing it stung her heart. It wasn't a sharp pain, but a dull, relentless ache that spread in countless tiny waves.

Just then, a sweet voice rang out. ""Adam.""

Celine looked up only to see Carly standing there.

Carly, the renowned Scarlet Rose of Mercity, was a beauty with ruby lips and pearly teeth. Years of dance training had given her a graceful, supple figure.

Seeing her, Adam instantly released Celine and strode toward Carly. He lowered his gaze to meet hers. His eyes were filled with a warmth Celine had never seen before. ""You're here!""

Carly nodded before glancing at Celine. ""And this is?"" Carly didn't recognize her at all.

But Celine would never forget Carly.

The truth was, Celine and Carly were neither full nor half-sisters. Hayden wasn't Celine's biological father. He was her stepfather.

Once, Celine had a happy family. Her father, Aaron Tate, and her mother, Lucy Garcia, had been devoted to each other.

Aaron loved her dearly. He would lift her high into the air every day. ""My little Celine is going to grow up so happy.""

Then, one day, he was gone. His brother, Hayden, moved in with his daughter, Carly, into Aaron's house, and Lucy became Carly's mother as well.

Lucy remarried Celine's uncle. From then on, her affection was directed solely toward Carly, not Celine.

When Carly scored 99 on an exam and Celine scored 100, Lucy punished her. ""Why can't you let Carly shine? Do you always have to outdo her?""

When Carly fell ill, her hair was shaved off for chemotherapy. She cried that she looked ugly. Lucy immediately shaved Celine's head. ""You need to become ugly with Carly. That way, she'll stop crying.""

Night after night, Lucy, Hayden, and Carly would cuddle together, their laughter spilling out into the hallway. Celine would stand outside, crying while clutching the doll that Aaron had bought her. ""Mommy, I'm scared.""

Eventually, Carly started calling Lucy ""Mommy"". Lucy was thrilled, but Carly said, ""Mommy, you can only have one daughter.""

On a rainy day, Lucy drove Celine to the countryside and left her there.

Little Celine chased the car while sobbing. ""Don't leave me, Mommy! I'll be a good girl. I'll listen to you. I'll let Carly have everything! I want a hug, Mommy! I'm scared!""

Clutching her doll, she fell heavily into the mud. She watched helplessly as Lucy drove away, disappearing from her sight.

Celine would never forget Carly.",1,1745603078.0,Hot_Romance_Stories,0,1.0,False

1k7r2ei,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1k7r2ei,Trip Report - 1 Week Oman Road Trip,"I just finished an incredible solo week in Oman, and I'm shocked it's still off the radar for those outside of travel-oriented circles. The country offers so little of what I usually crave out of travel, but a Bourdain episode put a bug in my ear, and I wanted to experience the Middle East for the first time. I'm so glad I did.

# Muscat: 4 total Days/Nights

Spend less time here unless you use it for a side trip base/0 days like I did.

**Al Ghubrah/Al Khuwayr area was a great first night stay** because it's close to the airport, easiest to drive, and has tons of malls and hypermarkets where I could stock up for my roadtrip. I wouldn't base myself here longer though.

**Qurum Beach is great for beach/pool lounging, luxury travel.** I stayed here 3 nights at the end in a high end hotel, but avoid if you want cheap/local feeling/walkability relative to Oman standards.

**Highlights/Must-Dos**

* Sultan Qaboos Grand Mosque (only open a few days between 8-11am, so plan accordingly, and go early)
* The Opera House
* Mutrah
   * Walk the Corniche
   * Visit the Fort
   * Shop at the Souq, go at night, haggle for 50-60% of price and don't budge, buy cool shit
   * Find the obscure ""Fountain"" location on the map, near the end of the main drag, watch the sunset (even better, moonrise) around that area
   * Most of you probably want to stay in this area

**Wadi Shab** is the one thing I wanted to do badly and simply didn't have the energy for. I'd have made it a Muscat day trip though, it's \~a 90 minute drive away, or you can take one of many tours via hotels, Viator, Get Your Guide, etc. They usually stop at Bimmah Sinkhole too.

**Daymaniyat Islands Day Trip:** Most tours depart from Al Seeb port, and cost between $75-$150 USD. They're lackluster in the tours themselves (terrible food, little structured activity, it's a glorified water taxi) but the islands are so beautiful, the water is perfect for swimming, and seeing turtles while snorkeling is a treat. Don't skip it.

# Nizwa: 1 Day/Night

This was rushed but fine for me. For most of you. I'd recommend doing all of this in at least 2 days/nights depending on how much time you can spend at historical sites (I'm the type where I can walk around for an hour and be totally happy).

**Between Muscat and Nizwa, stop in Birkat Al Mouz.**

If you leave Muscat early you can spend your pre-check in hours in this amazing little village.

The area is a banana plantation with crumbling ruins you can (carefully) walk through unguided, and for free. The views and old buildings are stunningly beautiful, and the little town is charming. Stop at the Banana Cafe for some cake and coffee.

**Highlights/Must Dos**

* Nizwa Souq
* Nizwa Fort
* Walk the city walls
* Eat at Cheese Prata for a late night snack

*Note: Jebel Shams/Akhdar are basically ""can't miss"" stops in Oman. I did neither. It didn't make sense for my itinerary and I was willing to give them up because I'm lucky to live in a place where I get that kind of nature x10. You'll want to plan for these while you're around Nizwa over several more days.*

# Misfat al Abriyyin: 1 Day/Night

A short drive from Nizwa is a lovely village that's mostly great for rooftop cafes and short nature hikes. I could see someone wanting more time here, but I personally was fine with a short stopover.

Stay in one of the old guest houses, eat a traditional meal on a terrace, and wander through the trails. Bring bug spray here!

**In between Nizwa and Misfat al Abriyyin, you can stop at both Jabreen Castle and Bahla Fort.** Both are amazing sites to walk around in for awhile, and make sense on this route. Otherwise, you can add a Nizwa day as a base to cover these places.

# Wahiba Sands: 1 Day/Night

Absolute highlight of my trip. There's a few tour operators to choose from, but I highly recommend Starry Domes. You want a place in the dunes, not the lame flat areas nearby a lot of other camps. The operator was the kindest, most knowledgeable person as well, and the food was genuinely fantastic.

If you rent a 4x4, you can follow your operator into the desert yourself. Otherwise, most offer transfers and meet you in the town of Bidiyah, which is what I did.

**Ride camels, stargaze, play in the dunes at sunset, wear lots of sunscreen and long, loose clothes, have the time of your fucking life.**

# Budget, Transportation, and Accommodations

* Oman is not walkable (you might choose between 45 minute detours or Froggering a 6 lane highway).
* Inter/intracity transport is basically nonexistent.
* Everything you want to see is spread out.
* Shoestring accommodations are slim, and poor value for money.

**Renting a car is an absolute must,** and while I usually dislike this, it was a treat in Oman. It simplified a lot, gave needed respite from the heat, and was pretty magical just driving through the country and soaking it in. Gas is also dirt cheap.

I'd say make a detailed itinerary first, get your accommodation, excursion, and rental prices, and budget around that after.

# Basics

**Language:** Arabic, but English is ubiquitous. However, many people truly appreciated a simple ""shukran"" (thank you) after an interaction. It was met with warm smiles, almost like they just appreciated me appreciating them. You don't need basic phrases, but use them!

Almost every sign on the road and in shops were in both languages, you won't have an issue with this.

**Safety:** Absolutely no concern anywhere. Not a woman, so ymmv, but I saw nothing to suggest anything different for women, and I've heard tons of accounts confirming this anecdotally.

**Dress Code:** Mosques are an exception basically anywhere, but mostly you can dress how you like. As a tattooed guy, I got some looks in shorts and short sleeves, but my attire was *far* from an outlier.

For maximum respect, you'll do well to cover knees and shoulders, but most places you won't stand out if you're not in a tank and booty shorts. I will say, while I mostly think I struck the right balance, I could tell my attire was offputting and regret not bringing longer, loose fitting clothes specifically for some historical sites and smaller towns.

At beaches and pools, people are shirtless and in bikinis. You'll notice when you're sticking out, just vibe it.

**Food:** Omani food has a lot of unique and tasty elements, with a clear influence from India, Pakistan, and especially Yemen. As much as I generally liked it, I found it samey, and it wasn't easy just walking into a random restaurant that would be great. Maybe research some dinners.

Do try:

* Lots of dates
* Halwa
* Tons of amazing cakes and desserts with coffee/tea, there's a big culture for it
* Any skewered meat you can get your hands on
* Shuwa
* Called tons of different things, but anything with cheese/meat/veggies in bread like a quesadilla, just fucking munch that shit

**The People:** Advertised as some of the kindest, friendliest, most hospitable in the world, and deservedly so.

**Alcohol:** If you want to drink, bring in 2 1L bottles you get at Duty Free (for cost purposes, ideally, at the airport you're leaving from). You can't buy packaged alcohol anywhere, and bar options are incredibly expensive and mostly limited to hotel bars.

**Smoking/Vaping:** Few people partake, but most places had smoking areas. I'm a vaper, and I found a lot of conflicting info both from official sources and on forums about the legality of vapes. I brought my own, I'm genuinely not sure if you're supposed to do that or not but *can* confirm they sell them at Duty Free on the way into Muscat so they're clearly fine to have and use.

**Opening Hours and Such:** Fridays are their Sundays, so many things close or operate on limited hours. You'll also find the hours between noon-4pm ish many things close until after afternoon prayers. Honestly didn't find out why, but it's common especially for souqs and smaller businesses.

**Driving:** Be prepared for people to ride your ass if you're going under the speed limit. It's very common for people to move over lanes, or trucks to hug the shoulder to allow passing. They're mostly courteous and consistent, but sometimes they'll still ride your ass if you're just passing, even if you're over the speed limit.

Lots of cameras everywhere, so don't be reckless. Get used to roundabouts. Don't fucking run red lights, or try to beat the amber signal.

Annoyingly, it's not legal to mount phones so navigation can be a pain in the ass glancing down at a cupholder. If you're solo, be careful, definitely don't use your phone otherwise (not that you should regardless).

Google Maps spazzes a bit sometimes, and likes to give repeat directions like ""get on the ramp, take the ramp, take the ramp, stay on the ramp"" before giving you the next direction. Mostly worked fine, didn't like Waze.",57,1745603033.0,travel,2,0.98,False

Inside the private room at the hotel, beneath the glittering glow of a towering ten-tier champagne pyramid, Benson Gray stood with his newly hired assistant, Sophie Scott.

The two of them were cutting a birthday cake together, their fingers interlocked.

When Sierra Shaw entered the room, Benson didn't flinch or even look guilty. Instead, he spoke as casually as if they were discussing the weather.

""Sophie has the same birthday as you. She's here all alone, far from home, with no friends. So, I decided to move your birthday party to hers for now. I'll make it up to you in a couple of days.""

Sierra's smile faltered, freezing in place as her grip on her purse slowly tightened.

Today was her 25th birthday. Benson had promised he would propose to her on this special day.

She'd worn the elegant white dress he had gifted her, spent hours perfecting her hair and makeup, and arrived at the hotel excitedly.

But the sight before her felt like a bucket of ice-cold water cascading over her head.

The engagement ring she had dreamed of—the three-carat pink diamond she had spent years imagining on her finger—was now sparkling brightly on Sophie's hand as Benson held her hand.

A sting of pain blurred her vision. Still, she forced her feet to move. Approaching Benson, she took a deep breath and pointed directly at Sophie's hand. ""What about that ring?""

Benson shrugged with infuriating nonchalance. ""It all happened so suddenly, I didn't have time to prepare a gift. Sophie liked it, so I gave it to her.""

But that was her ring, the one she had spent three years choosing meticulously, imagining every detail.

She could almost hear the sound of her heart shattering. Her eyes reddened as her voice broke. ""And me, Benson? What about me? What do you take me for?""

Benson clicked his tongue in annoyance. ""Why are you acting so childish? Haven't I celebrated enough of your birthdays over the years? Can't you let Sophie have this one for once?""

Let it go? Why was it always her who had to back down? Benson had sabotaged the deal she was about to close to boost Sophie's standing in the company. He had stood idly by as Sophie spilled coffee on her, dismissing it as Sierra being overly dramatic.

And every time Sophie made mistakes, it was Sierra Benson that was expected to clean up the mess, hiding behind the excuse of, ""those who are capable should do more"".

All these years, what exactly had Benson taken her for? Did everyone else always matter more than she did?

Tears blurred Sierra's vision. She clenched her fists, desperate to preserve the last shred of dignity she had left. Without another word, she turned and hurried toward the restroom.

Behind her, a murmur of disapproval rippled through the small crowd of friends.

""Benson, you've gone too far this time.""

""You know how much Sierra cares about this proposal, but you brought Sophie here just to get under her skin?""

Benson, utterly unbothered, continued slicing the cake. He placed one piece on a plate and handed it to Sophie.

Sophie's eyes flickered with triumph, though she quickly masked it with a nervous, apologetic expression.

""Mr. Gray, it's my fault. I shouldn't have come and upset Ms. Shaw. I'll apologize to her later, okay?""

Benson gave Sophie's shoulder a reassuring pat, his voice calm and condescending. ""It's not your fault. She's just being overly sensitive. I've been meaning to break her of this habit of throwing tantrums for no reason.""

""Benson, aren't you worried Sierra might get mad and refuse your proposal?""

Benson exhaled a ring of smoke, a mocking laugh escaping his lips as though he'd just heard the most ridiculous joke in the world.

""She's been dying to marry me since she was a kid, desperate to slap the name Mrs. Gray on herself. How could she possibly say no? If she wasn't obedient enough, she wouldn't even have the right to stay by my side.""

The crowd around him erupted into cheers and laughter.

""That's our Benson! Even the campus queen of Oceanea University couldn't resist his charm!""

""Benson, teach us your ways when you've got time!""

""Pfft! Step one, find yourself a woman who's head over heels for you!""

Everyone in Vellmont City knew Sierra was practically Benson's shadow. The two of them were three years apart, childhood sweethearts. Sierra had followed Benson to Oceanea City for college, giving up her plans to stay by his side.

To support him during the early days of his business, Sierra abandoned her dream of studying piano.

She took on the role of his assistant, pulling all-nighters for a month straight just to help him close a single deal. She drank so much at business dinners that she developed stomach ulcers.

Their mutual friends often said Sierra loved Benson so much that she'd lost herself completely.

But Benson? He was so convinced Sierra would never leave him that he treated her cruelly without a second thought.

In the restroom, Sierra stood frozen, her hands covering her ears. She stared at her reflection in the mirror—a woman with red-rimmed eyes and pale skin.

Slowly, she forced her lips into a smile, one that looked more painful than tears.

""Sierra, it's been ten years. Can you stop being so pathetic already?""

Chapter 2 Breaking Up

Sierra wiped away her tears, retouched her makeup, and pushed open the restroom door. When she stepped out, the first thing she saw was Benson and Sophie, arms linked, clinking glasses in a toast.

""Ha ha. Benson, if you're gonna put on a show, go all the way! Why not head to the honeymoon suite after this?""

""Man, Benson's got it all—a classy, elegant wife and a cute, flirty little assistant!""

Sierra's heart twisted painfully as her gaze fell on their intertwined arms. This was the man she had loved for ten years…

Someone caught sight of Sierra returning and nudged Benson, their voice dropping to a whisper. ""Benson, that's enough. Sierra's back.""

""Sierra, they're just joking around and trying to lighten the mood. Don't—""

But Benson didn't even let them finish before cutting in sharply. ""I'm not putting up with her tantrums!""

Then he turned to face Sierra fully, raising an eyebrow as though daring her to react. ""If you don't like what you're seeing, then leave. Stop standing there ruining my mood.""

Sierra forced herself to breathe past the stinging ache building in her nose, her eyes locking onto Benson's. ""Benson, we're breaking up.""

Her words hung in the air, slicing through the room like a blade. The chatter ceased instantly.

Did they hear her right? Sierra had just broken up with Benson?

Benson froze. Then, with an incredulous laugh, he flicked away his cigarette butt. ""You're serious? Don't come crying to me later when you change your mind and want me back.""

""Sierra, I'm so sorry. Mr. Gray was only keeping me company for my birthday because I didn't have any friends. Please don't let this affect your relationship with him.

""If you're mad, you can slap me a few times, but please, I'm begging you, don't break up with Mr. Gray.""

Sophie stepped forward, grabbing Sierra's hand with trembling fingers. Her face was painted with a pitiful, helpless expression.

Slap!

The sound echoed through the room as Sierra's palm connected with Sophie's cheek.

Sophie froze, completely stunned that Sierra had actually hit her. A sharp sting radiated across her cheek, and she realized her carefully applied makeup was probably ruined.

""Sierra, are you crazy?"" Benson, equally shocked by Sierra's actions, stood frozen for a moment. Then, snapping out of it, he raised his voice and stormed forward.

He shoved Sierra hard, pulling Sophie behind him to shield her protectively. Sierra stumbled back from the force of the push, colliding with the edge of the coffee table.

Her arm caught the blade of the fruit knife lying there, and a thin, sharp cut appeared. Blood began to flow almost immediately.

Benson's eyes darted to the blood, and for a brief moment, his expression shifted. He instinctively stepped toward Sierra as if to help her. But before he could move further, Sophie clutched his arm tightly.

""Mr. Gray, this is all my fault. Please don't be mad at Sierra. I'm willing to take a few slaps if it means she won't be upset anymore.""

Benson's gaze shifted to Sophie's red, swollen cheek, and whatever guilt he'd felt toward Sierra dissolved in an instant. Anger and disgust replaced it.

""Look at you, so cruel and vicious. You don't have even a shred of the kindness that Sophie has. Right now, you're going to apologize to her.""

His voice was firm and biting, but all of it was in defense of another woman.

Sierra closed her eyes, forcing back the tears threatening to spill. The pain in her arm from the cut was nothing compared to the ache in her heart.

For years, she had been chasing after Benson, believing that one day he would turn around and truly see her. But the boy who had once risked his life, charging into a fire to save her, no longer existed.

And her? She was tired. She didn't want to chase him anymore.

Sierra opened her eyes and slowly stood. The blood from her arm had seeped into the delicate fabric of her white dress, staining it a vivid red. Her face was pale, but her expression was cold and resolute.

She looked Benson directly in the eye and said, ""I won't apologize. She asked for it.""

Without waiting for a response, she turned and walked toward the door. Her steps were firm, her back straight, her departure decisive and final.

""Benson, I don't think Sierra looked too good. She's bleeding a lot. What if something happens to her?"" someone said after a long moment of silence.

""She's not going to die,"" Benson replied irritably, frowning as frustration flickered across his face.

""Do you think she's really going to break up with you this time? How are you going to explain it to your family if she does?""

The Shaw family and the Gray family had been close for generations. Everyone knew the two families had an understanding about Sierra and Benson being together.

Benson let out a scoff and lit a cigarette. ""She won't. She's just throwing a tantrum. Leave her alone for a few days, and she'll fix herself up and come back to me.""

Chapter 3 Into His Arms

For as long as Benson could remember, Sierra had clung to him like glue, constantly meddling in his business. It was obvious that she adored him, but she always put on that aloof front, pretending she didn't care.

Her life was a quiet routine of reading, blending perfumes, playing the piano, and cooking—so dull, so lifeless.

Being around her felt suffocating like all the fun had been drained from his world. The only saving grace? She was obedient. There was no way she'd go through with breaking up.

She was just angry. Sierra had been mad at him before, plenty of times. He'd give her a small gift, toss out a few sweet words, and soon enough, she'd come running back to him with that same silly devotion.

""Just watch. Once this blows over, I'll send her a quick text. Next thing you know, she'll be at my place making me that special hangover remedy of hers. Women—you can't spoil them too much.""

He spoke with utter confidence, certain she would never leave him. His self-satisfaction brought a lazy smirk to his lips.

""Damn, Benson! You've got your girl wrapped around your finger!""

""Honestly, I'm jealous. Even my housekeeper isn't as attentive as she is!""

Benson chuckled, draping an arm around Sophie's waist. ""I'm in a good mood tonight. After we finish the cake, we'll head out for more fun. Tonight's on me—whatever you want.""

…

Sierra stumbled out of the hotel, the blood from her wound had soaked through half of her white dress, and the sight of it drew curious glances from passersby.

Their expression was full of ridicule as if they were watching a clown staggering through the streets. Tears spilled down her cheeks uncontrollably, and all she wanted was to disappear.

So distracted was she by her anguish that she didn't even notice the man stepping into her path until she collided headfirst into his chest.

""Mr. Gray!""

Adrian Cole, trailing closely behind, jumped in alarm. He quickly stepped forward, ready to pull away the woman who had just stumbled into his boss, Theo Gray.

His immediate assumption was the usual—a shameless attempt by yet another woman to throw herself at Theo.

But before Adrian could intervene, the woman staggered back on her own and collapsed to the ground. He blinked, momentarily thrown off. Was this some kind of scam?

""Hey! Don't even think about faking a fall here! You were the one who ran into Mr. Gray!"" Adrian snapped.

Theo's sharp gaze shifted downward, immediately catching the smear of blood now staining his shirt where the woman had collided with him. His brows drew together in a slight frown.

""I'm sorry. I didn't mean to,"" Sierra murmured instinctively.

She struggled to push herself off the ground, but her body felt utterly drained, her limbs limp and unresponsive. Her vision wavered, dark spot flickering at the edges.

At the sound of her voice, Theo's dark eyes flickered with a sudden intensity. He stared at the woman crumpled on the ground, and for a brief moment, disbelief flitted across his face.

Without hesitation, he crouched down beside her and reached out and brushed her disheveled hair back from her face.

Under the dim glow spilling from the hotel entrance, her features came into full view.

""Sierra,"" he murmured, his deep voice resonant and smooth, like the lingering note of a piano.

Sierra struggled to lift her head, her vision hazy, as though she were staring at a familiar face she couldn't quite focus on.

""You…""

Before the word could fully escape her lips, her world faded to black. She slumped to the side, unconscious.

Theo moved swiftly, catching her before she could hit the ground. His sharp eyes immediately zeroed in on the gash on her arm and the deep crimson soaking through the fabric of her white dress. His expression darkened, dangerous glint flickered in his gaze.

""Isn't she supposed to be getting married soon? How did she end up like this?"" he muttered, his voice low and unreadable. Whether it carried concern or disdain was impossible to tell.

Without hesitation, Theo scooped her into his arms. The motion was unexpectedly gentle, almost cautious.

She was all grown up, but why did she feel even lighter than before?

Adrian, who had yet to get a proper look at Sierra's face, was frozen in disbelief. The notoriously aloof, untouchable Theo, who prided himself on his indifference to women, was now cradling one in his arms.

Had the collision somehow sparked feelings?

""Mr. Gray, are you—"" Adrian began, his voice full of shock.

""The hospital,"" Theo interrupted.

""But you have an important meeting scheduled. We're at a critical stage in the negotiations! If you don't attend, we might lose the project!""

Chapter 4 Remember, My Name Is Theo

""Then forget it."" Theo's voice was low, cutting through the air with an icy finality.

Adrian instantly closed his mouth. Without another word, he hurried to open the car door, his movements sharp and efficient.

…

By the time Benson staggered home, it was already night. He stumbled through the door, clearly drunk, and started yelling the moment he crossed the threshold.

""Where's Sierra? Didn't she come to apologize yet? Tell her to make me my special hangover remedy!""

It wasn't long before the housekeeper emerged from another part of the house.

""Young Mr. Gray, Ms. Shaw isn't here,"" she said politely.

Benson froze, a frown of disbelief settling on his face. He pulled out his phone and scrolled through the messages he'd sent Sierra earlier, instructing her to have his hangover remedy ready. No reply.

Well, well, well. So Sierra dared to ignore him.

His fury simmered beneath the surface, and with a sharp motion, he flung his phone onto the bed, his expression darkening.

The housekeeper, sensing the storm brewing in his mood, spoke cautiously. ""Young Mr. Gray, would you like me to prepare the hangover remedy instead?""

""No! Get out!"" Benson snapped, his voice sharp and cutting.

Without another word, the housekeeper turned and slipped out of the room, closing the door behind her.

…

When Sierra woke up early the next morning, the sharp tang of freshly sprayed disinfectant in the hospital room made her wrinkle her nose in discomfort.

Squinting against the room's brightness, she blinked a few times before noticing a tall figure standing by the window.

For a moment, disorientation swept over her, and a flicker of hope sparked in her chest. Her voice, hoarse from disuse, broke the silence.

""Benson?""

The man by the window froze at the sound of her voice. Slowly, he turned to face her, his expression cold and detached.

With the sunlight streaming in behind him, his features were cast in sharp relief.

The way his eyelashes cast faint shadows beneath his eyes only amplified the natural intensity and sharpness he seemed to exude.

As Sierra took in the full view of his face, the faint hope in her eyes vanished in an instant. Her already pale complexion drained further, leaving her ghostly white.

""Uncle Theo? Why is it you?""

It was Theo—Benson's uncle.

""Are you disappointed to see me?"" His voice was cool and edged with a teasing trace of amusement.

Theo stepped closer, his tall frame towering over her as he approached the bed. The shadow he cast felt both overwhelming and inescapable.

Sierra had always harbored a conflicted mix of respect and fear toward him. She forced herself to remain calm, though her stiff expression betrayed her unease.

""No. I just mistook you for someone else,"" she replied carefully.

""Sierra, this is the second time you've mistaken me for someone else.""

Theo's sharp tone cut through the air, cold and laced with quiet disapproval.

Sierra's eyes flickered slightly as her thoughts drifted back to the first time she had met Theo.

It had been three years ago, at the Gray Manor. She had gone there looking for Benson and had spotted a young man standing in the garden with his back to her.

His build was strikingly similar to Benson's, and he was even wearing the same style of white loungewear Benson often favored.

A playful idea had sprung to her mind—she wanted to scare him. Moving quietly, she crept up behind him, stood on her tiptoes, and covered his eyes with her hands.

""Benson, guess who?""

Her voice had been sweet and cheerful, her face glowing with a bright, mischievous smile. But the response she received wasn't Benson's warm, sunny tone. Instead, it was a voice cold, smooth, and unexpectedly captivating.

""I'm not Benson.""

She froze, startled, her hands dropping as she stumbled backward in panic. The movement sent her tripping over her own feet, and she began to fall.

Before she hit the ground, a strong hand reached out, catching her and pulling her into a firm, steady embrace.

""Remember this, I'm Theo.""

The icy voice rang out above her, and when she looked up, her breath caught in her throat. His face was impossibly handsome, but his sharp, cold eyes sent a chill straight through her.

At that moment, she realized she had unknowingly played a trick on the infamous ""demon king"" of the Gray family, a man feared for his cold and ruthless reputation.

Sierra had been terrified. From that day forward, whenever she encountered Theo, she would avoid him at all costs.

Now, as her gaze flickered with unease, she knew Theo hadn't forgotten that day either. He truly did live up to his reputation for holding grudges.

""I'm sorry, Uncle Theo.""

Chapter 5 The Kiss Photo

Sierra lowered her head and apologized, her voice trembling slightly. She didn't dare open her eyes to meet Theo's gaze.

Theo's eyes fell to her hands, which were nervously clutching the edge of the blanket. A faint trace of amusement flickered across his face, almost imperceptible.

Without warning, he leaned down, closing the distance between them.

""I don't like it when people talk to me while looking somewhere else,"" he said.

His cold fingers brushed against her skin as he gently lifted her chin, forcing her to look at him.

Faced with his strikingly handsome features now magnified before her, Sierra's body tensed in an instant. Panic flickered in her wide eyes as unease wrapped itself around her.

""I said I'm sorry,"" she stammered.

""Sorry for what?""

His eyes, slightly upturned at the corners, carried an innate air of arrogance. Beneath his right eye rested a perfectly placed beauty mark that softened the sharpness of his expression.

There was no denying it, he was breathtakingly mesmerizing.

Sierra swallowed hard, desperate to steady her nerves. ""I'm sorry, Uncle Theo. I won't mistake you for someone else again.""

""Remember your words. If you don't, you'll face the consequences,"" he said with a deep, icy voice.

Then, he gave her a meaningful look before straightening up.

Sierra felt the weight of his gaze, her heart pounding uncontrollably against her ribs. She just mistook him for someone else. Did he have to be this angry?

""How did you hurt your arm?""

His cold voice sliced through the silence, sharp and deliberate.

Sierra's eyelashes fluttered as a wave of humiliation from the night before surged back to the surface. Her nose stung with the warning of tears she refused to let fall.

She swallowed hard, forcing herself to keep her composure as she steadied her voice. ""I fell. It was an accident.""

Theo's sharp eyes didn't miss the way her lips pressed tightly together, her emotions threatening to spill over. His gaze darkened.

""Uncle Theo, thank you for bringing me to the hospital. I'll transfer you the medical expenses. You're busy—I'm fine now, so you don't need to worry about me. Please, go handle your work,"" Sierra said at last, pasting a polite smile on her face.

Theo's lips tightened as he studied her smile—a smile that looked more painful than tears. His jaw flexed, but he said nothing.

Without a word, he turned and walked out of the hospital room.

The moment the door clicked shut, Sierra's resolve crumbled. She curled up on the hospital bed, her body shaking as soft, stifled sobs escaped her.

Outside the room, Theo stood motionless. Through the small window in the door, he watched her curled figure, his jaw clenched and his lips pressed into a thin line.

""Mr. Gray—""

""Find out what happened to Sierra at the hotel last night,"" Theo interrupted.

Adrian blinked, caught off guard by the sudden command. ""So much for the meeting today,"" he thought.

After crying for a while, Sierra finally reached for her phone on the bedside table. As she unlocked the screen, her eyes landed on Benson's messages pinned at the top of her WhatsApp.

""Sierra, I've been drinking. Remember to make my special hangover remedy.""

""Sierra, how dare you ignore my messages? There's a limit to how unreasonable you can be. If you call me now, apologize, and come to my place to make my hangover remedy, I'll forgive you for what you did today!""

Sierra stared at the messages, bitterness mingled with mockery as she reread his words. This was the man she had loved for years, a man who twisted every situation to make it her fault.

With a decisive motion, Sierra unpinned Benson's chat from the top of her WhatsApp. She didn't bother to reply. Instead, she opened her contacts and called her best friend, Madison Lloyd.

“Maddy, I'm at the hospital. Can you come pick me up?""

An hour later, Sierra sat in the passenger seat of Madison's car, listening as her friend unleashed a torrent of colorful curses.

""I swear to God, Benson is such a trashy piece! How dare he treat you like this? Cee, if you don't break up with him this time, I'm personally dragging you to get your eyes replaced!""

Madison's tone was fiery, laced with frustration and exasperation. She had hated Benson for a long time.

Sierra kept her head down, looking at Sophie's latest post on her social media story.

Freehawk City’s Dacre Street bustled with life on sunny mornings, the sidewalks filled with chatter, the scent of fresh coffee wafting from corner cafés. For a young boy like Varion Gerardis III, life seemed almost ordinary. At twelve years old, he was brilliant yet shy, his world revolving around his family and the sketches of futuristic gadgets in his notebooks. His father, Samson Gerardis, a world-renowned nanoscientist, nurtured Varion’s curiosity, often inviting him into their home laboratory, sharing secrets of technology that no one else had yet imagined.

Yet, behind the warmth of his childhood, shadows lurked. His mother’s tragic death during a kidnapping attempt had already fractured his world. His mother showed up to their doorstep, nothing but a head in a box. But what came next would shatter it entirely.





**The Night Everything Changed**

Varion’s 15th birthday had passed just weeks before the night his life collapsed. Sitting in his father’s study, reviewing old blueprints, he heard an unnatural crash. The air was still. Rushing downstairs, he found his father slumped over his desk—lifeless. No wounds, no sign of struggle. Just the eerie silence of death.

Authorities ruled it a heart attack, but Varion knew better. His father had always been in peak condition, maintaining rigorous health checks and following a disciplined lifestyle. The idea of sudden heart failure felt implausible. But more than that, something about the scene was off—the way his father’s body was positioned, the eerie stillness of the study, as if it had been carefully arranged. No signs of distress, no toppled furniture, not even a trace of struggle. It was too clean. Too perfect. And perfection, in death, was rarely natural.

Desperate for answers, grief clawing at his insides, he stumbled into the laboratory—his father’s sanctuary. The dim glow of monitors cast long shadows as he rifled through Samson’s research, seeking anything that might explain what had happened.

Then he saw it.

A containment unit buried beneath old research papers, hidden as if it were never meant to be found. Within it, a meteorite shimmered with an unnatural metallic glow. A strange force called to him. The moment his fingers brushed the surface, an icy shock coursed through his veins, tendrils of energy wrapping around him like a sentient force. The containment seals hissed open, unleashing a torrent of power that overwhelmed his senses. Light, sound, time—everything twisted and warped. His mind trembled under the weight of something foreign.

A bond was formed.





**Samson’s Hidden Work**

What Varion never knew was that his father’s research wasn’t just revolutionary—it was dangerous. Samson had not only studied Nanotechnology, but he was also studying something else. Bound, the mysterious extraterrestrial substance that granted humans superhuman abilities. But he had also captured something far greater: an alien from another planet.

During his work for the Global Hero Oversight Agency (GHOA), Samson had secretly collaborated with L.E.A.F. (Local Experimentalists of Astronomic Forces), uncovering traces of unnatural energy that led to a meteorite that crashed outside the GHOA headquarters. GHOA deemed this meteorite dangerous, but Samson had other plans for it. 

Samson had stumbled upon him by sheer luck. As he was leaving GHOA’s headquarters, he caught a glimpse of the alien from his peripheral vision. Driven by relentless curiosity, he pursued Vermadion. Bound by the royal laws of his homeworld, which forbade him from harming intelligent species without provocation, Vermadion was forced to surrender. Using the Pandora Containment Unit, Samson sealed the being inside, dedicating months to studying his physiology. His findings were groundbreaking—Vermadion was composed of advanced nanorobotics, a living symphony of nanites.

However, such research bred jealousy. Julius Goyle, Samson’s colleague, harbored bitter resentment toward him. His envy festered, setting the stage for the betrayal that would claim Samson’s life.

  




**The First Encounter**

At 17, Varion faced his first real test. In gym class, he was sparring with his friend, Rick Cassius. The session was meant to be light, just an exercise in technique—but something inside him stirred. As Rick lunged with a quick jab, Varion sidestepped—too fast. Before he could process it, he was behind Rick, his body thrumming with unfamiliar energy.

Rick spun, startled, asking Varion how he moved so fast. Varion didn’t respond. Rick noticed his eyes had a hint of gold in it, and just shrugged it off.

Varion had no answer. His heart pounded, his palms tingling with heat. Something wasn’t right. Rick came at him again, but when Varion raised his arm to block, Rick was sent flying backward, crashing across the gym. Silence fell over the room.

Varion blinked. Blinked again. He was suddenly awake. One moment, Rick was attacking. The next, he was halfway across the gym. Varion’s body felt refreshed—like he’d just woken from an eight-hour nap.

His teacher broke the silence. Complimenting him on the strength of his punch.

Varion looked around, dazed. His classmates gawked at him, but their words didn’t match what he felt. Because *he* hadn’t done it. Something inside him had.

Something that had just taken control.





**Meeting Vermadion**

When Varion was sleeping, a voice—commanding yet ancient—echoed in his mind, answering his question from earlier. “Who is in my mind?”

Vermadion revealed his true identity: a royal warrior from Ditrimius V sent to Earth to investigate the rapid spread of Bound. Samson captured him not too long ago. He had planned to escape, to take over Samson’s body if necessary, but upon seeing Varion, something shifted. The boy possessed an untapped potential, so he waited. But he was just buried in Samson’s research papers in the basement, until the day Samson died. The day when Varion discovered Vermadion. Rather than take over his body completely, Vermadion offered a choice: they would work together. In return for the alien’s strength, knowledge, and combat expertise, Varion would wield this power to help Vermadion study and search bound-related incidents.

But their partnership was not seamless. Vermadion’s warrior instincts clashed with Varion’s moral compass. The boy, reluctant to embrace his new abilities, hesitated at the idea of fighting. Vermadion, battle-hardened and pragmatic, saw hesitation as weakness.  
  






**Becoming Valiance**

In the years that followed, Varion honed his abilities. By day, he became a respected researcher at Freehawk University, delving into nanotechnology, the same field his father had pioneered. But Freehawk’s underbelly was rife with corruption, and crime had spiraled since the discovery of Bound as a substance for superhuman augmentation.

That was when he saw him—Julius Goyle. The same man who had once worked alongside his father, now a looming presence in the scientific community, and later in his time as Valiance, his greatest adversary as the villain Harbinger.

With Vermadion’s nanotechnology at his disposal, Varion crafted a suit—an extension of his extraterrestrial partner, capable of enhancing his physical prowess and concealing his identity. Freehawk’s streets were no longer ruled by fear alone. A new name whispered through the alleys, a symbol of defiance against the city’s corruption.

Valiance had risen.  
  


**Gaining Clarity**

Years later, as Valiance, Varion learned the truth when fighting Chrono—his father’s death had not been a random tragedy but a calculated erasure from existence itself. Deacon Goyle, operating under the alias Chrono, had traveled through time with a single mission: to prevent Samson Gerardis from ever becoming successful, thus killing him.

Deacon Goyle was the great grandchild of Julius Goyle, who had killed Varion’s father in order to maintain their family status in Freehawk, as in a distant future where Julius Goyle shined and was famous, they were successful and rich, and getting rid of Samson being successful only way he could maintain their status.

What Deacon didn’t know is that he created something worse. Upon killing Samson, he unknowingly sparked Valiance’s journey of coming into existence.

Armed with this knowledge, Valiance swore an oath: he would not only avenge his father’s murder but ensure that time itself would not be rewritten in favor of those who sought to undo him.

**War with Authority**

In 2012, the Global Hero Oversight Agency (GHOA) was founded by Silvis Ramos to monitor and control the growing superhuman population. Early in its development, the agency was approached by Chrono, a time traveler who warned that Samson Gerardis’ research would lead to global instability. Seeing Samson as a threat to their long-term control, GHOA chose to stay silent and allow Chrono to eliminate him, erasing one of the most brilliant scientific minds from history in the following year, 2013. This decision remained classified, buried beneath layers of secrecy.

Upon discovering their involvement in his father’s death when he was 24, Valiance’s hatred for GHOA solidified, making them one of his greatest enemies.

Pregnancy Test Result: Single Live Intrauterine Pregnancy

Species Test: 99% Probability Human

Alone in the doctor’s office while she got me some medicine, I read the simple lines of text several times before they truly made sense.

I was carrying a child.

I looked at the second line again, a smile breaking out across my face. A human baby born of me and Arthur, my fated mate.

I had to tell him right now.

I dialed his number with fingers that shook slightly, glad I was already sitting down. A bubble of happiness swelled up from my heart, and I released it with a laugh. The phone, however, went straight to voicemail, meaning his phone was off.

Swallowing my disappointment but all too aware that Arthur tended to avoid distractions while at work, including just ignoring my calls, I tried to keep my voice cheerful.

“Arthur, it’s Iris. I know you’re busy, and I wish you good luck with the candidacy, but I have some news for you. Great news.”

I pressed my lips shut. Voicemail was not the way I wanted to tell him. News this good needed to be told in person.

“Anyway, please give me a call when you hear this. Love you.”

I hung up and wrapped my arms around myself tightly. I felt ready to explode. If it were a normal day, I would hop in my car and drive to Arthur’s office.

But it wasn’t a normal day. Arthur was meeting with election officials and members of his party to see whether his bid as a presidential candidate would be accepted. A powerful alpha werewolf since his birth, he’d been working toward this goal his whole life, and there was no question he would make an exceptional leader.

This was no time for me to be pestering him, even if this were the best news of my life.

But tonight, when he returned home with his good news, I would tell him mine. Our good news.

The doctor returned with a smile and handed me a bottle. “Take two of these with food twice a day for your nausea.”

“Can you tell how far along I am?” I asked.

“Four weeks. I’d like to see you and your husband back here next week so we can go through your schedule for the next nine months.”

“He’s not my husband yet, but I’m sure he’ll be fine with that.”

She opened a folder and studied some pages in a failed attempt to hide her look of disapproval. “He’s human, I presume?”

“No, an Alpha werewolf,” I said. She looked up in surprise. “We’re fated.”

Her smile looked more genuine now that she knew I wasn’t some “human living off the system” but a future mother fated to mate with a socially prominent werewolf. This was providence working its magic.

“Such a rare and lovely match! Tell Brett to arrange that appointment, but call me if you aren’t feeling better with the medicine.”

I kept smiling as I walked to my car. Arthur would be so happy, and I knew he would be a wonderful partner in this pregnancy.

Although I was human and Arthur was of course a werewolf Alpha, lending him the highest possible social status, I had always believed that we could handle any judgment or prejudice our still somewhat hierarchical society might throw our way.

Because we love each other. Despite our polar opposite upbringings, fate had plans for us, drawing us irrevocably and irresistibly towards each other.

Besides, things were changing. Even fifty years ago a human-werewolf relationship such as ours, fated-mates or not, would have been seen as a laughable embarrassment for any Alpha. Though progress was slow, it was tangible, as humans began to prove themselves worthy of more than just positions of subservience.

Yes, both humans and werewolf-classes alike still preferred to mingle mainly amongst their own kind, Alpha’s being particularly notorious for this, but I had always chosen to focus on the progress, rather than the challenges humans still faced in our society.

On the drive home, I started to think about our wedding plans.

Arthur and I had been together for a year now and moved in together six months ago. It’s quite a long engagement for fated mates, but as a human, I’m fine with taking it slow. Now with the child, I guess we had to think about getting married.

I pulled up in front of our house and looked it over with new eyes. It was a two-bedroom. Would we need to get a bigger place now?

But then, if Arthur were to become the next Alpha President, we’d be living at the President’s Residence in the capital for the next ten years, twenty if he were re-elected. It was enough to make me giddy.

I set my purse down and went into the kitchen. I made myself a cup of herbal tea. No caffeine or alcohol for me for a while. I realized I was humming the Beatles’ song “Penny Lane” and laughed.

“You’re in a good mood,” a familiar and beloved voice said from behind me.

With a little squeal, I turned around, cup in hand. Arthur looked magnificent in his dark gray suit that set off the width of his shoulders and the trim lines of his waist and hips. More than that, he looked happy, his face uplifted by one of his rare deep smiles.

“You got it?”

He gave a little bow. “You are now looking at the latest and greatest candidate for Alpha President.”

I set down the cup and ran to him to wrap him up in a hug. He laughed, a rare event, and kissed me so deeply my toes curled. When he raised his head, I smiled into his face and wondered if our baby would inherit his dark hair and even darker green eyes.

“Your voicemail said you had news as well?” he asked.

I nodded, and it felt like I had champagne in my blood. I reached into my pocket and pulled out the report. Looking puzzled, he took it from me and unfolded it. His eyes scanned the page, and his smile disappeared.

I noticed his body going stiff and his dark brows pulled down in a frown. He looked at me, and his expression was shuttered.

“You're pregnant?” he asked flatly. “With a human fetus?”

“Well, yes, but don’t call it a fetus. It’s our baby, our perfect little baby.”

He looked back down at the test results, and now his eyes were hard and cold.

“Arthur?” I asked, my whole body going cold. “What’s wrong?”

# #CHAPTER 2: A New Reality

Iris POV

I waited for an answer, but Arthur just looked at me, his expression going from cold to unreadable. I was going to insist he say something when someone knocked loudly on our door. Arthur turned and opened the door wide, smiling his professional smile as several people came through.

I recognized some of them from articles and TV interviews where they’d been discussing Arthur’s possible candidacy, but others were strangers. They were all obviously, though not ostentatiously, wealthy, and they were all alphas, except two beta males who acted like assistants to their alpha bosses.

Feeling the pressure to be a gracious hostess, I stepped forward and welcomed them all to our home, but they only made the briefest eye contact with a few nods and then seemed to forget I existed.

“So, you’re the human?” one of them asked with that haughty but not quite insulting disdain I was so used to from alphas. He was about Arthur’s age but not quite as tall and sporting well-coiffed light brown hair.

I said something about my name, but no one seemed to notice that either.

“Why don’t you go upstairs and have a rest?” Arthur turned to me, and I was hoping he would use the moment to introduce me properly, but instead he said, “We can continue what we were talking about later.”

I wanted to protest, to point out that as his future wife and mother to his child I had every reason to remain with these people as they discussed Arthur’s future. But Arthur’s eyes had gone cold, not the ones that I familiar with, and with reluctance I agreed, stepping back from a part of Arthur’s life I had never truly realized before excluded me.

Yes, I thought as I climbed the stairs with what felt like lead in my shoes, my life with Arthur had always been private, but I had never thought he was ashamed of me or wanted to hide me from the other people in his life. Had I been naïve? Those alphas hadn’t treated me with the respect one would give to a housemaid.

I went into the main bedroom to change out of the suit I’d worn to the doctor’s and put on my jeans and paint-splattered smock, which made me feel better right away. My canvas was as I had left it, washes and waves of bright colors that would become the background to the field of wildflowers I was painting to celebrate my recent BA in fine art.

Growing up, I’d always known I wanted to paint. The only true obstacle was money, but I’d worked hard and received several scholarships to get through college in four years.

It took a little longer than usual, but eventually I was lost in my art, what Arthur liked to call my “other-world trance.” The brush was an extension of my body that allowed me to soar and dance.

I was painting in oils, which I ground and mixed up myself, and the images on the canvas were coming together just as I wanted.

I breathed in the smell of linseed oil, which I knew some people found harsh, but it was an old friend to me, like an actor and the smell of greasepaint, I supposed. It was the one area of my life where I had found praise and appreciation even from betas and alphas.

I found myself wondering if any of the Alphas downstairs liked art before sternly telling myself I didn’t need their approval.

I found it much harder to concentrate than usual. I’d been given two great pieces of news with the baby and Arthur’s candidacy, so why was I feeling so alone, so far removed from my mate? I scowled at my canvas. The joy I was trying to show wasn’t coming through; the lines looked uncertain and confused.

I painted undisturbed until the sun went down, powering through until I was a little happier with the painting, if not with my situation in general.

Painting in artificial light had never worked for me, even when my subject was abstract. I crept down to the kitchen and made a sandwich, listening to the murmur of the alpha’s voices in the living room, then went back upstairs and looked over the canvas I was prepping before giving it a good sanding.

I went to bed alone, feeling cold and unsettled. Much later, well past midnight, Arthur joined me, his body a little damp from his nightly shower. Still mostly asleep, I rolled over then and put an arm over his chest. He responded immediately, chuckling softly, and held me back tenderly.

I was half asleep, so it was not a good time to discuss our baby, but I felt my fears dissipate somewhat as he kissed my chin, my forehead, and then my lips. His warm hand ran over my shoulder and around my back, and again I was pleasantly overwhelmed with the sensation of the way my fated mate just fit against my body and, I presume, my soul. He pulled down the strap of might nightgown and kissed my shoulder, then down to my beasts, which he bared to the cool air of the room and his own warm breath.

I shivered, and I felt him smile. But even as I responded to his touch, I wondered how real this was.

I was still feeling that ambivalence the next morning, but I waited Arthur and I both had a little coffee before I asked, “Are you ready to talk about the pregnancy now?”

“Yes, we do need to talk,” he said, “but I have to get to the office.”

“I see. This evening, then?”

He shook his head and looked at his watch. “I have an alpha gathering and fundraiser this evening after work at the Waldorf, so don’t wait up for me.”

“The Waldorf?” I repeated, smiling at him with gritted teeth. “Sounds like fun. I’ve never been there.”

He shrugged and then drained his coffee. “Alphas only, like last night. You wouldn’t have anyone to talk to.”

I wanted to say he could introduce me to his friends and then I would have many people to talk to, but instead I pressed him for at least some feedback about our child.

He took his briefcase off the counter and checked inside. “If you want to keep it, I’ll cover all expenses, of course.”

“Expenses?” I asked, deeply disappointed and not bothering to hide it.

He looked up then. “Children are expensive, and my child should be raised with care and respect. You’ll need to step up for at least this year while I campaign.”

“But we’re fated mates,” I objected. “Shouldn’t we get married when we’re having a child?”

He looked at me sternly. “Voters will not like a human Luna.”

My mouth opened in shock. “That is so discriminatory! You told me you would be running on a platform for human-wolf equality!”

He looked like he restrained himself from rolling his eyes. “There’s a big difference between championing for people’s rights and shoving a human Luna down their throats.”

“What did you just say?” I leapt up from my stool and stood there.

He waved at me, using the motion to check his watch. “Look, I’ll easily be able to give you a million dollars for raising the kid,” he said, lingering slightly on the human slang for “child.” “That’s more than you’ll need.”

I almost threw something at him. “This is about your fatherhood to our child, not money.”

“Look, I have to get to work, and I’ll be working a lot more for a while. You tend to things as you think best.” He stood and grabbed his briefcase, and my anger just kept me standing there to watch him walk out of the kitchen. I heard the door to the garage open and close.

In a sort of fog, I cleaned up the plates from breakfast. What was happening? Was I the mother of his child, his fated mate, and his future wife, or not? And if not, what the hell was I?

I sat on the sofa in the living room, unable even to gather myself enough to paint. Nothing made any sense, and everything I had thought my life was wasn’t real. I was too stunned even to cry.

There was a brisk knock then, and I walked robotically to the front door, wondering if Arthur had forgotten something. A tall, beautiful alpha woman stood there.

“Hello?” I asked her. “May I help you? Who are you?”

“Oh, I’m Selina,” She said with a polished smile, “Arthur’s fiancée. I came to see who I’ll be sharing my husband with.”

# #CHAPTER 3: Phone Call

Iris POV

“What?” I asked, though I wasn’t any more shocked than I had been before opening the door.

Life had lost its context. This was just something on top of what had already occurred.

“May I come in?” she asked even as she strode past me with a whip of blond hair and whiff of expensive perfume. I watched from behind as she walked to the sofa, her long legs impeccably cased in black velvet pants and her top covered in wispy layers of purple silk. She set herself down.

“Do you have any coffee?” she asked.

“You’re going to marry Arthur?” I asked as I pushed the front door closed.

“Yes, and soon.” She looked smug. “At first, of course, when I heard he had some human lover he adored, I said no way, but then the situation was explained to me, and well, being Luna isn’t something one just turns down, is it?”

She frowned and looked at the armchair that so perfectly matched the sofa. “Aren’t you going to sit down?”

I walked over to the chair and sat. My feet felt a little numb, and so did my fingers.

“So,” she said the second I was in the chair, “he’s told me you’re pregnant, so obviously we need to talk about that. Also, do you have some sort of career you’re pursuing?”

“I think I need to talk to Arthur before you and I talk further,” I said.

“Call him,” she said with a shrug.

It was difficult to retrieve my phone from my pocket and dial Arthur with my numb fingers, but I managed it. It went to voicemail.

“I need to wait for him to see my number and call back.”

Selina snorted, looked at me with pity, and then pulled out her phone, which I saw she put on speaker after dialing a number. It rang twice.

“Yes, Selina?” Arthur’s voice asked, and my stomach sank. It was clear which of us Arthur took seriously.

“Honey,” she said, smiling at me in triumph. “What time are we going to see the engagement dress and rings tomorrow?”

Arthur sounded a bit impatient but replied, “Ten-thirty.”

“I’ve already booked the seaside mansion for the engagement party.”

“Do whatever you want,” he said, and I could see the expression easily on his face. “I’m hanging up.”

She made a little-girl face and spoke in a slightly higher voice. “Haven’t you told your little lover about this yet?”

“Her name is Iris.”

Selina raised her eyebrows at me as if to say I should be happy he admitted it. I didn’t care.

“And I told you, she doesn’t need to know.”

“Aren’t you afraid she’ll leave you once she finds out?”

“She needs my money.” Arthur’s response was quick and certain. “With student loans and a child on the way, how could she leave?”

Ah, I thought, and I found myself nodding as some things started to make sense, not the least was his offer of a million dollars to meet my “need.” That was evidently how he really saw me: not a future artist he was helping to meet her goals but just some gold-digging parasite. Did he think our child was a parasite too?

Selina was still talking into the phone “About the child, I’ve thought it over. I don’t want Iris to give birth before our wedding. It would be a scandal.”

“Forcing a woman to have an abortion is illegal, even a human one.” I noticed his tone was angry. He was probably worried people would find out and it would hurt his campaign. “Be careful you don’t end up in jail.”

So. Numb throughout my body now, I tried to make myself accept that Arthur didn’t want the child, and his only concern was avoiding legal trouble. I opened my mouth to tell him I was there and had heard every word, but Selina just made a kiss-kiss noise into the phone and ended the call.

“Well, I can’t force you, it’s true,” she said to me, “but you really need to scrape that thing out of you before it causes Arthur trouble. Besides, that my husband will have a human mistress is bad enough; I don’t need a child in the mix.”

She flung her hair behind her left shoulder, a well-practiced move. “Well, Arthur obviously doesn’t want to be the villain here, so as his fiancé, I will, but not heartlessly.” She laughed with a little trill.

“You’ll be living with us, I suppose, so the best story will be for you to be my assistant. I have one already, but another would be helpful.” She shrugged. “So, while I get a contract drawn up complete with NDA, get the fetus aborted and name your price.”

OK, even as a human facing an alpha, I had my limits about being humiliated.

“I’ll take a billion dollars at the end of the week to start, and then we can discuss my salary.”

Selina looked at me as though I’d peed on her shoe, which actually would be quite satisfying.

“I can’t get a billion dollars together in a week!”

I told her, “Then you can’t afford my child or afford me as your assistant.”

“This is ridiculous,” she announced, standing and flinging the strap of her Channel purse over her shoulder. “I’ll have Arthur deal with you.” In a few long strides of her legs, she left, slamming the door shut behind her.

Or rather, she would have, but I caught the door and called after her, “But don’t worry, I just want to talk to Arthur one more time. If Arthur really just wants to keep me as a mistress, I’ll leave soon.”

She didn’t bother to answer, probably thinking I was saying I’d leave to bargain for money.

I didn’t want money. I didn’t want some alpha woman smiling while she destroyed my life. I wanted an explanation, a conversation. I wanted to know my relationship with my fated mate wasn’t going to end so poorly.

But then Selina paused and turned with an even bigger smile than before. “You should attend the party this evening. There, you can talk to Arthur all you like.”

“Arthur said it was alphas-only.”

She laughed. “There will be plenty of your rank there, trust me.” Then she executed a perfect runway turn and walked toward a red sports car parked on the street.

I remembered the party would be at the Waldorf, so I didn’t have to ask anyone for the address.

Alone in the house, I bathed and shaved my legs and spent way too much time on my makeup. I had a very nice party dress in a red so deep it looked almost black, off the shoulder with a full skirt, a classic. I put it on almost defiantly, trying to find more strength inside.

I was going to a party, and I was going to enjoy it, damn it. I slid into my best shoes and called for an Uber.

The Waldorf was ablaze with lights and sparkling people. I went to the front door with my chin up and walked through the lobby refusing to make eye contact with anyone. At the door of the ballroom itself, however, I was stopped by a hotel employee dressed in red and black.

“Excuse me, miss,” he said. “Humans require an alpha escort beyond this point.”",1,1745602812.0,Hot_Romance_Stories,1,1.0,False
1k7qywu,https://www.reddit.com/r/AllThingsGoFestival/comments/1k7qywu/travel_lodging_and_activities_oh_my_a_locals_tips/,"Travel, Lodging, and Activities. Oh My! A Local's Tips and Tricks for Merriweather and How to Get Around.","I see many of the same questions about getting to and from Merriweather, where to get a hotel, and things to do around the area. Well, I grew up in Columbia and still live close by, so as a local, here are my two cents.

  
**Lodging** \- Try to stay in Columbia or another nearby town. ATG calling this a DC festival is scamming you, Columbia is 45 minutes from DC without traffic, and 1 - 2 hours with traffic. DC is notorious for having bad traffic on weekends and outside of rush hour. Also, be wary that the DMV has some of the WORST drivers in the country. (I have driven in the north, the south, out west, mid-west, even New Jersey, nothing is worse than driving in the DMV)

*Here are some places to look for lodging, and why I recommend them.* 

Columbia: This is the town the festival is held in, and you have access to 100+ miles of bike paths, so depending on where you stay, you can bike or walk to the festival. When I still lived in town, that is how I would get to and from MPP. 

Jessup/Laurel: This neighboring town is about 10 - 15 minutes from MPP. You still have access to the bike paths. It is along the Route 1 corridor, so there are stores if you need anything at the last minute. Plus, it's cheaper than Columbia. Please note: Route 1 isn't a road I suggest walking along. There are some parts that are just like a highway with a slower speed limit, and it can be unsafe.

Ellicott City: It's very close to MPP; it's up Route 29 about 5 miles. You cannot easily access the bike paths. It's a little more residential in some places, but if you stay along Route 40, it's very similar to Route 1, and I would caution walking along Route 40 for the same reason I caution Route 1. But Ellicott City is also home to Old Ellicott City, which is a beautiful historic town with lots of small shops, and has had Gordon Ramsay do a ""24 Hours to Hell and Back"" episode about rebuilding the city after a second tragic flood. 

Catonsville/Arbutus: It's a little further away, probably about 20 minutes, but it's an easy commute. Just be wary of any home Orioles or Ravens games because that will cause traffic in that area. Some parts are as expensive as Columbia, but it may have a wider range of hotel or Airbnb prices than Columbia. You'll need to drive or take an Uber from here.

Baltimore: It's 30 minutes down I-95 from MPP. TBH, it's not the smartest choice when attending this festival, but I love this city. There is so much to do, the food is amazing, the people are fantastic, and the Art scene in Baltimore is significantly better than DC's. Just visit; I promise you will love it in Baltimore.

  
**Transportation** \- I hate to say it and I wish it wasn't true, but the public transportation in Maryland sucks. As a car-dependent state, you'll likely have to use Uber, rent a car, or take a road trip. BUT if you stay in Columbia, you can use the bike paths and walk or rent a bike for the festival. 

If you want to use public transportation, here are your resources:

**What to do**—There is a lot to do around Columbia and the neighboring towns. I am including a list of my favorite things, but if you have specific questions, please let me know.

*Local to MPP* 

* Coffee from Mad City Coffee—It's literally down the street from Merriweather. Their coffee is good, and it's one of the few local coffee shops in Columbia. 
* Hike the Patapsco River - A fun spot you can hike and swim in easily is the Daniels Dam Area (I am a big hiker, so I have a lot of recommendations)
* Window shop in Old Ellicott City—It's a cool historic strip about 10 minutes from MPP. There are stores, restaurants, and bars, so you could easily kill an afternoon in OEC. Also, if you go, let me know if you find the hidden Gordon Ramsay. 
* Walk or ride the bike paths—I bring them up a lot because they should be used more often by tourists. You can get from one side of town to the other on these paths without having to ride on a road, but some spots cross the street to connect the paths. Four lakes are all connected by the paths: Lake Elkhorn, Wilde Lake, Lake Centennial, and Lake Kitamaqundi (this one is right next to MPP).
* Robinson Nature Center - I haven't been here in years, but they recently renovated their building and expanded their programming. 

*A little further from MPP*

* Visit Baltimore—For the same reason I say you should stay at a hotel in Baltimore, it's one of the best places I have been, and the community is fantastic. Visit the city once and you will love it. 
* Visit Fort McHenry—It is Maryland's only National Park. It has a beautiful viewpoint, and the tours are fun. If you go on the right day, there will be reenactors there. Also, please donate when you visit; it's a free park, but we want to support our National Parks. There is a cash box in the visitors center for donations. 
* Visit Annapolis—It's a cool historic city, very pretty. It's a little preppy for my taste, but the Naval Academy is super cool, and its main street is filled with fun window shopping and restaurants. 

*Now, some things to avoid* 

* Don't camp out for the festival - I have seen this asked a few times. The grounds of Merriweather are a PUBLIC park. Don't cosplay as homeless for a festival. If you do, I will tell the dog walkers that you are an art installation made to give their pets a place to piss.  Don't do it. 

Let me know if you have any further questions or want more recommendations! I hope this helps those planning to go!",8,1745602790.0,AllThingsGoFestival,1,1.0,False
1k7qxbx,https://www.reddit.com/r/VisitingIceland/comments/1k7qxbx/itinerary_feedback/,Itinerary feedback?,"Hi all! We are headed to Iceland June 20-July 3. The first week we'll be in North Iceland for a yoga/adventure retreat and the retreat center has all of our activities planned, so we're all set there. 

After the retreat, we're going to rent a car in Akureyri and have five nights before leaving for home (from KEF) on 7/3. I asked ChatGpt to help with a relaxed itinerary of some Iceland highlights and he gave me the below suggestions. Feedback? We definitely don't feel a need to cram everything in but would love to hit some highlights.

I know we need to book our accommodations like, yesterday, but these stops all seem to have plenty of availability on Airbnb so I think we'll be okay. 

  
Thanks for any thoughts! Obviously feel free to skim as this is a buttload of info LOL. 

**Itinerary for June 28-June 3**

After a week in North Iceland, enjoy a **five-night road trip** down the **scenic South Coast** to Reykjavík at a **chill, relaxed pace**. This itinerary highlights epic natural wonders – from **glacier lagoons** and **black-sand beaches** to **steaming hot springs** – while giving you plenty of downtime to unwind in cozy, scenic lodgings. Each day includes gentle drive times, must-see stops, and optional experiences to make your journey special.

# Itinerary Overview & Map

* **Night 1:** Jökulsárlón Glacier Lagoon area (or Höfn) – after a scenic long drive from Akureyri
* **Night 2 & 3:** Vík area – black sand beaches, waterfalls, and relaxing ocean-view stays
* **Night 4:** Golden Circle region (Flúðir or Hveragerði) – geysers, Gullfoss waterfall, and a hot spring soak
* **Night 5:** Blue Lagoon / Reykjanes Peninsula – geothermal spa finale near Keflavík (easy for departure

# Day 1: Akureyri to Jökulsárlón – Scenic Drive to the Glacier Lagoon

**Morning (Akureyri to East Iceland):** Start early from **Akureyri**, heading east on the Ring Road (Route 1). The drive to the Jökulsárlón area is long but beautifully varied – about **6+ hours of drive time without stops**​[handandarrow.com](https://handandarrow.com/traveling-iceland-day-6-dettifoss-and-a-long-drive-to-hofn/#:~:text=One%20of%20the%20tough%20parts,to%20Hofn%20takes%206%2B%20hours). Take your time and enjoy the scenery. Since you’ve already seen the Mývatn area, you can drive more directly today. Consider a **mid-morning stop in Egilsstaðir** (3.5–4 hours from Akureyri) to stretch and grab lunch or coffee. Egilsstaðir is the largest town in East Iceland and a good refuel point before you venture into the more remote southeast.

**Afternoon (East Fjords to Jökulsárlón):** Continue south from Egilsstaðir through the East Fjords region. The roads wind past fjords and mountains; if you’re up for a slight detour and the weather is clear, the coastal route via **Djúpivogur** offers charming fjord views. Otherwise, stick to Route 1 through the **Öxi Pass** (in summer) or the longer coastal road in winter. As you approach **Höfn** (about 3 hours from Egilsstaðir), you’ll see the vast Vatnajökull glacier to your right. If daylight allows, you might detour just before Höfn to **Stokksnes** for a stunning view of **Vestrahorn Mountain** with black dunes (small fee to enter the private land). This windswept headland is a photographer’s favorite, but even a quick look is worthwhile for the dramatic scenery.

**Evening (Jökulsárlón area):** Arrive in the **Jökulsárlón Glacier Lagoon** area by late afternoon or early evening. Jökulsárlón is a surreal sight – a glacier lagoon filled with **floating icebergs** that drift out to sea. If you have time before dark, stop by the lagoon for a preview of the blue icebergs bobbing in the water, and walk across to **Diamond Beach**, where ice chunks wash up on the black sand​[kimkim.com](https://www.kimkim.com/c/golden-circle-south-coast-reykjavik-5-days#:~:text=Next%2C%20visit%20J%C3%B6kuls%C3%A1rl%C3%B3n%20Glacier%20Lagoon%2C,view%20of%20the%20entire%20area). The low-angle evening light can make the ice glow, and it’s a magical introduction to the south coast. **Overnight** near Jökulsárlón or in **Höfn** (about 1 hour east of the lagoon).

* *If staying near Jökulsárlón:* You’ll be right next to the lagoon for a quiet sunset or early start the next day. **Hali Country Hotel** and **Fosshotel Glacier Lagoon** are popular choices offering cozy rooms amid the wilderness.
* *If staying in Höfn:* This fishing town has more dining options – treat yourselves to **locally caught langoustine (lobster)**, a regional specialty. Höfn’s harbor views and relaxed vibe make for a pleasant evening stroll. *(Höfn to Jökulsárlón is \~1 hour drive, so you can still visit the lagoon either on arrival today or next morning.)*

**Driving Summary:** \~470 km, \~6–7 hours without stops (Akureyri to Jökulsárlón/Höfn). By breaking for lunch and short photo stops, you’ll keep a relaxed pace on this long drive​[handandarrow.com](https://handandarrow.com/traveling-iceland-day-6-dettifoss-and-a-long-drive-to-hofn/#:~:text=One%20of%20the%20tough%20parts,to%20Hofn%20takes%206%2B%20hours). Aim to reach your lodging by around 6–7 PM to unwind after the journey.

# Day 2: Jökulsárlón to Vík – Glacier Lagoons, Waterfalls & Black Sand Beaches

*Dawn light at* ***Jökulsárlón Glacier Lagoon****, with icebergs drifting serenely – a must-see sight on Day 2.*​[kimkim.com](https://www.kimkim.com/c/golden-circle-south-coast-reykjavik-5-days#:~:text=Next%2C%20visit%20J%C3%B6kuls%C3%A1rl%C3%B3n%20Glacier%20Lagoon%2C,view%20of%20the%20entire%20area)

**Morning (Jökulsárlón & Fjallsárlón):** Wake up near one of Iceland’s most iconic wonders. Start your day with a visit to **Jökulsárlón Glacier Lagoon** when it’s quieter (many tour buses arrive later in the morning). Take a leisurely walk along the lagoon’s edge and watch seals pop up between the icebergs. If you’re interested in getting closer to the ice, consider a **boat tour** on the lagoon. An *amphibian boat* tour (\~35–40 min) is a gentle ride among the bergs, while a *zodiac boat* tour (about 1 hour) goes faster and farther, getting you closer to the glacier face. *Note:* These tours are popular – **booking in advance is recommended** as seats are limited​[icelagoon.is](https://icelagoon.is/tours/#:~:text=9%3A30%2C%2011%3A00%2C%2013%3A00%2C%2014%3A30%2C%2016%3A20,and%2017%3A40). Even without a boat, the experience from shore is fantastic. Don’t forget to walk over to **Diamond Beach** on the ocean side of the bridge, where smaller ice chunks wash up on black sand​[kimkim.com](https://www.kimkim.com/c/golden-circle-south-coast-reykjavik-5-days#:~:text=Follow%20the%20river%20under%20the,lagoon%20or%20near%20the%20shore) – great for photos.

Before leaving the glacier area, you can also stop at **Fjallsárlón**, another glacier lagoon 10 minutes west of Jökulsárlón. It’s smaller but offers a different perspective, with a view of the glacier tongue up close​[kimkim.com](https://www.kimkim.com/c/golden-circle-south-coast-reykjavik-5-days#:~:text=Continue%20about%2050%20minutes%20further,as%20far%20as%20you%20like)​[kimkim.com](https://www.kimkim.com/c/golden-circle-south-coast-reykjavik-5-days#:~:text=Day%203%3A%20Discover%20Skaftafell%2C%20Svartifoss%2C,and%20J%C3%B6kuls%C3%A1rl%C3%B3n%20Glacier%20Lagoon). There’s a short path to a viewing area and a little café – a nice coffee stop with glacier views.

**Late Morning (Skaftafell Nature Area, optional):** As you drive west, you’ll enter **Vatnajökull National Park**. If you’re up for a short hike, pull into **Skaftafell** (about 40 minutes from Jökulsárlón). Here you can do the **Svartifoss waterfall hike** – about 1.5 hours round-trip to see a beautiful waterfall dropping over black basalt columns​[kimkim.com](https://www.kimkim.com/c/golden-circle-south-coast-reykjavik-5-days#:~:text=Day%203%3A%20Discover%20Skaftafell%2C%20Svartifoss%2C,and%20J%C3%B6kuls%C3%A1rl%C3%B3n%20Glacier%20Lagoon)​[kimkim.com](https://www.kimkim.com/c/golden-circle-south-coast-reykjavik-5-days#:~:text=Visit%C2%A0Skaftafell%2C%20where%20you%20could%20spend,on%20an%20ice%20climbing%20excursion). The trail is well-marked and offers views over the Skeiðarársandur plains. If hiking isn’t in the cards, even a quick stop at the visitor center and a 10-minute walk to the **Skaftafellsjökull glacier viewpoint** is rewarding – you’ll see a glacier tongue up close without a tour. *(Optional adventure:* Skaftafell is also a great place for a **guided glacier hike** if you’re interested – a 2-3 hour walk on the ice with a guide. This requires booking ahead and starts typically around 9–10 AM or 2 PM. If you prefer this, you might skip another activity to allow time. It’s an unforgettable experience but can be tiring, so consider your energy for a “relaxed pace.”)

**Afternoon (Towards Vík – Canyons and Lava Fields):** Continue along the Ring Road through the *Öræfi* region and into **Kirkjubæjarklaustur** town (about 1.5 hours from Skaftafell). Just before reaching Klaustur (as locals call it), watch for the sign to **Fjaðrárgljúfur Canyon** (near the village of **Kirkjubæjarklaustur**). This spectacular mossy canyon is a 6 km detour off the main road, but worth it if time allows. From the parking lot, it’s less than 1 mile to walk along the canyon’s edge, with **amazing viewpoints** over serpentine rock formations carved by the river​[kimkim.com](https://www.kimkim.com/c/golden-circle-south-coast-reykjavik-5-days#:~:text=Continue%20about%2050%20minutes%20further,as%20far%20as%20you%20like). (The trail is easy and you can go as far as you like; even the first viewpoint is impressive.)

After stretching your legs at Fjaðrárgljúfur, drive through the vast **Eldhraun lava field** – an otherworldly expanse of bumpy moss-covered lava rocks, leftover from an 18th-century eruption. There are a few pull-offs where you can carefully step on a marked path to feel the springy moss (avoid damaging it though). As you pass the village of **Vík í Mýrdal**, you’ll notice the landscape change to black sand plains. This area, **Mýrdalssandur**, is a desert-like stretch formed by glacier outwash – you’re approaching the realm of the Katla volcano.

**Late Afternoon (Arrival in Vík & Beaches):** Arrive in **Vík** by late afternoon. Vík is a small seafront village with a famous **black sand beach** and towering sea stacks offshore. Check into your accommodation – aim for two nights in or around Vík so you can explore without packing up tomorrow. After settling in, you can do a short **evening stroll**: drive 10 minutes west of Vík to **Reynisfjara Beach** *if* the daylight is still good (or save it for tomorrow morning). Reynisfjara is known for its moody black sands and the **Reynisdrangar** basalt sea stacks rising from the ocean. Walk along the beach (keeping a safe distance from the powerful waves) to see the **basalt column cave** at the cliff base. This popular spot is often crowded mid-day, so evening or early morning is perfect for a more serene experience​[kimkim.com](https://www.kimkim.com/c/golden-circle-south-coast-reykjavik-5-days#:~:text=As%20you%20near%20V%C3%ADk%2C%20along,of%20large%20caves%2C%20as%20well)​[kimkim.com](https://www.kimkim.com/c/golden-circle-south-coast-reykjavik-5-days#:~:text=a%20pretty%20church%2C%20as%20you,of%20large%20caves%2C%20as%20well). Alternatively, drive up to the **Vík Church** on the hill in town for a panoramic view of Vík at sunset, with the sea stacks in the distance.

**Evening (Vík):** Dine in Vík – there are a few cozy options like **Sudur-Vík** (homestyle Icelandic fare in a historic house) or **The Soup Company** (famous for its red hot lava soup, a spicy meat soup served in a bread bowl – great on a cool evening). Enjoy a relaxing night. Many accommodations in the area are **guesthouses or hotels with ocean or mountain views**, perfect for unwinding. If the sky is clear and it’s fall or winter, you might even step outside at night for a chance at northern lights away from city lights.

**Driving Summary:** \~270 km, 3.5–4 hours without stops from Jökulsárlón to Vík. With stops at Skaftafell and Fjaðrárgljúfur, plan for a full day of unhurried exploration. Leave Jökulsárlón area by late morning to reach Vík around 5–6 PM comfortably.

# Day 3: Vík & Surroundings – Relaxed Exploration of Beaches, Cliffs, and Cozy Village Life

Today, enjoy a **slow-paced day** based around Vík – no major relocation, just exploring nearby natural sights and soaking in the atmosphere. Since you have two nights here, you can take the day as relaxed as you like.

**Morning (Vík’s Black Sand & Cliffs):** Have a leisurely breakfast. If you didn’t visit **Reynisfjara Beach** yet, go in the morning when it’s quieter. Watch for **puffins** on the cliff faces (if it’s summer, typically May–August) and marvel at the basalt column formations up close​[kimkim.com](https://www.kimkim.com/c/golden-circle-south-coast-reykjavik-5-days#:~:text=As%20you%20near%20V%C3%ADk%2C%20along,of%20large%20caves%2C%20as%20well). Next, drive up the gravel road to **Dyrhólaey**, the dramatic promontory west of Vík (about 20 minutes from town). Dyrhólaey has two viewing areas: a lower car park (for viewing sea arches and the coastline) and an upper car park near the lighthouse. The upper viewpoint, reachable by a steep dirt road, offers a **stunning panorama**: you’ll see the **massive stone arch** stretching into the sea and endless black beaches to the west​[kimkim.com](https://www.kimkim.com/c/golden-circle-south-coast-reykjavik-5-days#:~:text=Then%2C%20make%20your%20way%20to,they%20nest%20along%20the%20cliffside)​[kimkim.com](https://www.kimkim.com/c/golden-circle-south-coast-reykjavik-5-days#:~:text=Next%2C%20along%C2%A0Route%201%2C%20locate%20the,this%20may%20not%20be%20possible). Take in the ocean breeze and perhaps spot seabirds. *(Note: In high summer, parts of Dyrhólaey may close briefly for bird nesting – check signs, or visit later in the day if morning access is restricted.)*

After these beach visits, you might be ready for a warm-up. Consider stopping by the **Kötlusetur** (Katla Volcano Museum) in Vík, or one of the cute **cafés** in town (there’s a coffee house and a wool outlet where you can browse Icelandic sweaters). This is a good time to relax, write some postcards, or simply enjoy the views.

**Afternoon (Optional Activities or Relaxation):** The afternoon is free for optional adventures *or* pure relaxation – your choice! For a **relaxed pace**, you might enjoy a scenic drive or short walks. Some options:

* **Sólheimajökull Glacier Walk:** A 30-minute drive west of Vík is the parking for Sólheimajökull, a glacier tongue extending from Mýrdalsjökull (Katla’s icecap). It’s an easy 15-20 minute walk from the parking lot to the glacier’s edge where you can safely view the ice (do not walk on the glacier without a guide). It’s humbling to see the blue ice and ash streaks up close, and it’s usually much quieter than Jökulsárlón. This short excursion can be a nice add-on if you want some light exercise and icy scenery without a guided tour.
* **Katla Ice Cave Tour (from Vík):** If you’re interested in a unique experience and don’t mind a guided excursion, consider a **Katla ice cave tour**. These 3-hour tours typically depart from Vík or a nearby base, driving you in a super-jeep onto the Kötlujökull glacier to explore natural ice caves under Katla volcano. It’s a memorable adventure – walking inside blue-black glacier ice – but it will take up a chunk of your day and requires advance booking. If you prefer to keep things chill, you can skip this, but it’s an option for a special treat.
* **Reynisfjall Hike:** For casual hikers, there’s a trail up **Reynisfjall mountain** (the ridge west of Vík) starting from near the church. Even walking partway gives nice views over Vík and the coastline. Or simply wander along **Vík’s own beach** (near the town) to feel the black sand beneath your feet – it’s the same stretch of beach as Reynisfjara, just around the corner, and often almost empty.
* **Local Culture in Skógar:** If you didn’t get enough waterfall action, you could drive \~30 minutes to **Skógafoss** (we’ll be stopping there tomorrow anyway, so no rush). Next to Skógafoss is the **Skógar Folk Museum**, a small museum with historic Icelandic houses (including turf-roofed farm buildings) and artifacts. It’s a charming dose of culture and history, giving insight into traditional life in Iceland’s countryside. This could pair with a visit to **Seljavallalaug pool** (an old outdoor swimming pool hidden in a valley near Skógar) if you’re feeling adventurous: a 20-minute hike from a gravel road leads to this geothermal pool built in 1923​[kimkim.com](https://www.kimkim.com/c/golden-circle-south-coast-reykjavik-5-days#:~:text=,you%20to%20the%20relaxing%20pool). It’s undeveloped and surrounded by mountains – a bit cold and rustic, but a cool offbeat experience for a quick soak in nature. *(Only attempt if you’re okay with very basic conditions – there are no facilities, and the pool isn’t very hot, just warm.)*
* **Simply Relax:** Nothing wrong with taking a true rest day! You can return to your hotel or guesthouse in the afternoon and curl up with a book, enjoy a hot tub if available (some accommodations or nearby cottages offer outdoor hot tubs or baths), or take a nap listening to the sound of distant waves. The key is to recharge.

**Evening (Vík – 2nd Night):** For dinner tonight, maybe try another local spot in the Vík area – if you’re up for a short drive, **Black Beach Restaurant** near Reynisfjara has a unique setting by the beach (and great fish & chips). Or enjoy a casual meal at your accommodation if they offer one. Watch the sunset – perhaps from **Dyrhólaey** or the beach if you didn’t earlier – or simply from the comfort of a warm lounge. This is your second night in Vík, so savor the slow evening.

**Note:** If it’s a clear night and dark (late August to April), step outside before bed to scan the sky for the **Northern Lights**. In Vík’s rural setting, you have a decent chance if conditions are right (and it’s something on your wishlist).

# Day 4: Vík to Golden Circle (Flúðir/Hveragerði) – Waterfalls, Geysers & Geothermal Relaxation

Say goodbye to Vík this morning and journey west toward Iceland’s famed Golden Circle region. Today’s theme is **waterfalls and hot springs**, balancing sightseeing with a nice soak by day’s end.

*Behind the cascades of* ***Seljalandsfoss****, one of the South Coast’s iconic waterfalls you’ll visit on Day 4.*​[kimkim.com](https://www.kimkim.com/c/golden-circle-south-coast-reykjavik-5-days#:~:text=Your%20first%20stop%20is%C2%A0Seljalandsfoss%C2%A0waterfall%2C%20with,to%20the%20right%2C%20as%20well)​[kimkim.com](https://www.kimkim.com/c/golden-circle-south-coast-reykjavik-5-days#:~:text=Next%2C%20along%C2%A0Route%201%2C%20locate%20the,this%20may%20not%20be%20possible)

**Morning (South Coast Waterfalls):** Drive out of Vík heading west on Route 1. After about 45 minutes, you’ll reach **Skógafoss**, one of Iceland’s largest and most photogenic waterfalls. Skógafoss plunges 60 meters (197 ft) in a sheer curtain of water. Park at the base and walk right up to the misty foot of the falls – you’ll likely feel the spray (raincoat recommended). If you’re feeling energetic, climb the **370 steps** to the top of Skógafoss for a different perspective and a peek at the river gorge above; on a clear day, you can also look out towards the coast from up there. At the top, a *flat trail continues* (part of the Fimmvörðuháls route) with more waterfalls upstream if you fancy a short additional walk​[kimkim.com](https://www.kimkim.com/c/golden-circle-south-coast-reykjavik-5-days#:~:text=Next%2C%20along%C2%A0Route%201%2C%20locate%20the,this%20may%20not%20be%20possible) – even 10 minutes further reveals a couple of small falls, but remember you’ll have more to see today, so no need to overdo it.

After Skógafoss, drive 30 minutes further to **Seljalandsfoss**, another postcard-famous waterfall. Seljalandsfoss is unique because you can **walk behind it** into a cavern (accessible via a loop trail, about 5 minutes from the parking)​[kimkim.com](https://www.kimkim.com/c/golden-circle-south-coast-reykjavik-5-days#:~:text=Your%20first%20stop%20is%C2%A0Seljalandsfoss%C2%A0waterfall%2C%20with,to%20the%20right%2C%20as%20well). Do take the loop if conditions allow – it’s an incredible experience standing behind the waterfall’s curtain, looking out through the water at the landscape​[kimkim.com](https://www.kimkim.com/c/golden-circle-south-coast-reykjavik-5-days#:~:text=Your%20first%20stop%20is%C2%A0Seljalandsfoss%C2%A0waterfall%2C%20with,to%20the%20right%2C%20as%20well). The ground is wet and a bit uneven, and you will get damp from the mist, but it’s worth it! (Wear a waterproof jacket and watch your footing on the rocks.) Adjacent to Seljalandsfoss, just a few hundred meters to the left (north), there’s a hidden gem **Gljúfrabúi** – a smaller waterfall inside a mossy gorge. You can wade a short path through the stream to peek at it inside the canyon (waterproof boots helpful, or accept wet feet). It’s an optional mini-adventure if you don’t mind getting a little wet for a unique sight.

By late morning, you’ve seen some of Iceland’s most iconic falls! If you need a pick-me-up, there’s often a food truck or coffee stand at Seljalandsfoss parking in summer, or you can stop in the town of **Hvolsvöllur** 20 minutes down the road for lunch. Hvolsvöllur has a couple of cafes and the Lava Centre (an interactive volcano museum, if you’re interested in a quick indoor activity).

**Midday (Toward Golden Circle – via Flúðir or Hveragerði):** Continue west on the Ring Road to the town of **Selfoss** (about 1 hour from Seljalandsfoss). Here you’ll turn inland (north) toward the Golden Circle area. If you’re staying in **Flúðir** for the night, take route 30 north at Selfoss, which leads to Flúðir in about 30–40 minutes. If you’re staying in **Hveragerði**, you would actually turn off earlier (we’ll cover Hveragerði option below). For now, let’s assume Flúðir, since it’s closer to the classic Golden Circle sights.

* **Lunch idea:** If timing works out, a fantastic stop on the way is **Friðheimar Farm** (just off route 35 near Reykholt, on the way to Flúðir). It’s a famous **geothermal greenhouse farm** known for its **tomato restaurant**, where you dine in a greenhouse amid the tomato plants. They serve a delightful **tomato soup buffet, fresh bread, and even tomato ice cream and drinks**. It’s open for lunch until around 4 PM, and **reservations are recommended** because it’s popular. Friðheimar is roughly 15 minutes from Flúðir and makes for a unique cultural and culinary experience on your drive. If you prefer a quicker bite, there are also bakeries and grills in Selfoss town as you pass through.

**Afternoon (Geysir & Gullfoss or Secret Lagoon):** After lunch, you have some flexibility. Since you’ll be in the Golden Circle area, you can choose to visit one or two of the main sights **today**, or save them for early tomorrow. Consider your energy levels:

* **Option A:** **Relax Today, Sightsee Tomorrow** – If you’re a bit tired from the busy morning, head to your accommodation in **Flúðir** now (check-in mid-afternoon) and enjoy a **soothing soak at the Secret Lagoon**. The **Secret Lagoon (Gamla Laugin)** is located in Flúðir and is *Iceland’s oldest swimming pool*, fed by natural hot springs​[guidetoiceland.is](https://guidetoiceland.is/travel-iceland/drive/blue-lagoon#:~:text=%2A%20Fontana%20Spa%C2%A0,South%20Iceland%20town%20of%20Laugarvatn). It’s a large, rustic hot spring pool in an open field, with steam rising all around – a perfect place to unwind. The facility has showers and changing rooms; entry is usually available on the spot (though in summer you might book in advance just in case). Soaking here in late afternoon/early evening, surrounded by nature, is incredibly relaxing – exactly what a chill-paced trip needs. After your soak, you can have dinner at your hotel or a local guesthouse (many serve farm-to-table style meals). Get a good night’s rest and plan to do the Golden Circle sights first thing on Day 5 when you depart.
* **Option B:** **Sightsee Today, Relax in Evening** – If you’re still feeling enthusiastic and not too pressed for time, you can drive about 30 minutes north from Flúðir (or from route 35) to visit **Geysir** and **Gullfoss** this afternoon, then return to Flúðir for a late-day Secret Lagoon dip. In summer, it stays light very late, so you have plenty of time. Visiting **Geysir Geothermal Area** is a quick stop – stroll the path to see bubbling hot pools, steaming vents, and, of course, **Strokkur geyser** which erupts every 5–10 minutes, sending up a water column \~20-30m high. It’s always fun to wait for a couple eruptions (camera ready!). Next, drive 10 minutes further to **Gullfoss**, the “Golden Falls.” Gullfoss is a two-tiered mighty waterfall – there are viewing paths at two levels offering different angles. Feel the mist and hear the roaring water as the river drops into the canyon – it’s one of Iceland’s most beloved waterfalls​[kimkim.com](https://www.kimkim.com/c/golden-circle-south-coast-reykjavik-5-days#:~:text=Next%2C%20visit%20the%C2%A0Geysir%C2%A0geothermal%20area%2C%20with,that%20is%20sure%20to%20impress). By now, you might be nearing early evening. Drive back toward Flúðir to reward yourself with that **Secret Lagoon** soak before it closes (typically around 8 or 10 PM, depending on season). Floating in the warm mineral water, reflecting on the day’s sights, is pure bliss.

Whether you choose Option A or B, you’ll end the day with some relaxation. If you’re instead staying in **Hveragerði** (an alternative to Flúðir): adjust your route after Selfoss to head 15 minutes east to Hveragerði town. Hveragerði is known for its **geothermal activity** – there are hot springs right in town and a beautiful hot river in the hills (Reykjadalur, which you could hike to if time permits, around 3 km each way). For a chill pace, you might skip that long hike, but you can still enjoy Hveragerði’s **geothermal park or hot spring foot bath areas**. Lodging in Hveragerði puts you closer to Reykjavík for tomorrow. Either location is fine; Flúðir is better for being near Secret Lagoon and central to Golden Circle, Hveragerði is better if you want another town atmosphere and maybe an easy geothermal river walk.

**Evening (Golden Circle area – Night 4):** Spend a cozy night in **Flúðir or Hveragerði**. In Flúðir, the **Secret Lagoon** might have small geothermal hot pots and a casual atmosphere to meet other travelers. In Hveragerði, perhaps have dinner at **Restaurant Varma** or another local spot, enjoying farm-fresh ingredients from the region. Your accommodation could be a country hotel or guesthouse with countryside quiet or a river view. After dark, the countryside here can be very still – perfect for a good night’s sleep. If it’s winter and you’re lucky, you might even catch northern lights over the farm fields or greenhouses (the area around Flúðir/Reykholt has many lit greenhouses that grow vegetables using geothermal heat).

**Driving Summary:** \~190 km from Vík to Flúðir via waterfalls, plus whatever Golden Circle driving you add. Vík to Seljalandsfoss (with Skógafoss on the way) is \~140 km, \~2 hours. Seljalandsfoss to Flúðir via Selfoss \~100 km, 1.5 hours. Overall 3.5–4 hours driving spread through the day. It’s a day of many stops, but each is short and the distances between aren’t too long, keeping it manageable.

# Day 5: Golden Circle to Reykjanes (Blue Lagoon) – Geysers, Þingvellir & Blue Lagoon Finale

It’s your final full day, with a wonderful mix of iconic sights and a luxurious finish at the Blue Lagoon. By tonight, you’ll be near Keflavík for an easy departure or final hop into Reykjavík.

**Morning (Finish Golden Circle Touring):** If you stayed in Flúðir (and didn’t see **Geysir/Gullfoss** yet), drive out after breakfast to complete those stops. It’s best to head out by 8:00–9:00 AM to beat some crowds:

* **Gullfoss & Geysir:** In the morning light, Gullfoss is gorgeous. Spend \~30 minutes walking to the viewpoints (there’s an upper parking lot and a lower one; from the lower, a path leads right to the fall’s edge – wear a jacket for mist). Then head to Geysir area and catch a couple eruptions of Strokkur, maybe taking a short loop around the bubbling pools and fumaroles. There’s a visitor center across the road with restrooms, snacks, and souvenirs if needed.
* **Þingvellir National Park:** Next, drive towards **Þingvellir** (Thingvellir) National Park, about 50–60 minutes from Geysir on route 37/36. Þingvellir is a UNESCO World Heritage Site rich in history and geology. This is where Iceland’s first parliament (Alþingi) met in 930 AD – you can visit **Law Rock** (Lögberg) where chieftains once gathered​[kimkim.com](https://www.kimkim.com/c/golden-circle-south-coast-reykjavik-5-days#:~:text=Start%20with%20a%20tour%20of%C2%A0%C3%9Eingvellir,clear%20water). The park also sits in a rift valley **between the North American and Eurasian tectonic plates**, so you can literally walk between continents in the Almannagjá gorge​[kimkim.com](https://www.kimkim.com/c/golden-circle-south-coast-reykjavik-5-days#:~:text=Start%20with%20a%20tour%20of%C2%A0%C3%9Eingvellir,clear%20water). Park at the main visitor center or one of the lots by Almannagjá. Walk the path down into the valley – you’ll see the flag marking the historical assembly site. It’s about a 20-minute walk to the charming **Öxarárfoss waterfall**, which tumbles into the rocky canyon. Spend an hour or so exploring Þingvellir’s trails and absorbing the sense of history and nature. *(If you’re interested in snorkeling between the continents at* ***Silfra fissure****, that’s a famous activity here – but it takes a couple of hours and requires booking a tour, plus you’ll don a drysuit in cold water. Given the relaxed vibe, you might skip it this time unless it’s a bucket list item.)*

By midday, wrap up at Þingvellir. There’s a cafeteria at the visitor center for a quick lunch if you like, or you can wait until you get closer to Reykjanes.

**Midday/Afternoon (To Reykjanes Peninsula):** It’s time to head toward the **Blue Lagoon/Reykjanes Peninsula** for your final night. From Þingvellir, drive southwest toward Reykjavík and onwards to Reykjanes. The drive from Þingvellir to the Blue Lagoon area is roughly 1 hour 30 minutes to 2 hours (you’ll pass the outskirts of Reykjavík on the way, or you can take a scenic route via South Iceland’s coast). If you have extra time and energy, you could make a quick detour to **Kerið Crater** (a volcanic crater lake right off route 35 near Selfoss) on the way south – it’s a 15-minute stop to see a vivid blue-green lake in a red caldera (small entrance fee). Or, if you haven’t eaten, the town of **Selfoss** or **Reykjavík suburbs** can be good for grabbing lunch/coffee to go.

Aim to arrive near the **Blue Lagoon** by mid-afternoon. Many people like to **visit the Blue Lagoon in the late afternoon or early evening** (around 3–5 PM entry) to relax for a couple of hours and then have dinner. **Pre-booking your Blue Lagoon slot is essential** – the Lagoon limits entries and often sells out during peak times​[guidetoiceland.is](https://guidetoiceland.is/travel-iceland/drive/blue-lagoon#:~:text=The%20Blue%20Lagoon%20is%20open,a%20reservation%20are%20turned%20away). Hopefully, you’ve booked this in advance for today. Plan for at least **2 hours** at the Blue Lagoon spa (you can stay longer if you wish).

**Afternoon/Evening (Blue Lagoon Experience):** Check into your accommodation near the Blue Lagoon (there are two hotels on site – the Silica Hotel and the Retreat – if you’re splurging a bit, or various hotels/guesthouses in nearby **Grindavík** or by Keflavík airport). Then head to the **Blue Lagoon**, located in a black lava field near Grindavík. Sink into the **milky-blue geothermal waters**, which are rich in silica – you can apply the famous white silica mud mask to your face for a mini spa treatment. The lagoon’s warm waters (around 38°C / 100°F) will ease any travel fatigue. There are swim-up bars for drinks (optional, of course) and plenty of space to find your own little corner of bliss. As you soak, reflect on the journey you’ve had – floating in these hot waters surrounded by lava rock feels almost otherworldly and is a classic **Icelandic relaxation** experience.

After your soak, shower off and get dressed feeling utterly rejuvenated. If you’re staying at one of the Blue Lagoon’s hotels, you could indulge in a nice dinner on site (the **Lava Restaurant** at Blue Lagoon is excellent, reservation recommended; the Retreat Hotel also has the upscale Moss Restaurant). Otherwise, drive a short way into **Grindavík** town (5-10 min) for a casual seafood dinner – it’s a fishing town with some local eateries (like **Fish House** restaurant) known for their fresh catch.

**Evening (Reykjanes Peninsula – Night 5):** Tonight is your last night. You’re conveniently located only 20–30 minutes from **Keflavík International Airport**, and about 45 minutes from **Reykjavík city**. Enjoy the quiet of the Reykjanes Peninsula – perhaps step outside to admire the stars or the coastal air. If you’re not too tired, you could even do a short late-evening drive to see one or two Reykjanes sights: for example, **Gunnuhver geothermal area** (steaming mud pools and vents) or the **Bridge Between Continents** where you can symbolically walk from the North American to Eurasian plate on a footbridge​[kimkim.com](https://www.kimkim.com/c/golden-circle-south-coast-reykjavik-5-days#:~:text=,at%20Reykjanesviti%20lighthouse%20with%20beautiful)​[kimkim.com](https://www.kimkim.com/c/golden-circle-south-coast-reykjavik-5-days#:~:text=views%20of%20Iceland%20from%20atop,boarding%20your%20return%20flight%20home). These are usually empty at night – a cool, quick stop under the midnight sun or stars – but they can be done tomorrow too if you have time. Otherwise, just relish your final cozy night. Maybe enjoy a last Icelandic craft beer or some locally made chocolate as a treat.

**Driving Summary:** \~150 km (depending on route), 2.5 hours from Flúðir to Blue Lagoon via Þingvellir. It’s a bit of a driving day but broken into a few legs (Flúðir to Þingvellir, then to Blue Lagoon). By leaving around 9 AM and sightseeing, you’ll reach Blue Lagoon area by mid/late afternoon.

# Day 6 (Departure or Reykjavík): Farewell Iceland 👋

Depending on your plans, you might fly out today or head into **Reykjavík** for extra time. If you have a flight, it’s an easy drive (20 min) to **KEF Airport**. If flight is later or next day and you haven’t explored Reykjanes yet, consider a short morning outing: drive around the peninsula loop to see **Gunnuhver** (Iceland’s largest mud pool) and the rugged **Reykjanesviti Lighthouse**, or visit the **Blue Lagoon’s geothermally active surroundings** in the fresh morning light. **Keflavík** town also has the **Viking World Museum** (with a replica Viking ship) if you have a few hours to kill.

For those heading to **Reykjavík** instead: it’s about a 45-minute drive to the city. You could spend the day sightseeing there (museums, Hallgrímskirkja church, cafes) or simply relax after the road trip.

Either way, you’ve just experienced some of **South Iceland’s best** at a laid-back pace – from iceberg lagoons and waterfalls to steamy hot springs and volcanic beaches. It’s been a mix of adventure and relaxation, giving you both incredible memories and some well-deserved rest. Have a safe journey onward, and come back soon – **Bless bless!** (Icelandic for goodbye!)

1k7qwcx,https://www.reddit.com/r/pureretention/comments/1k7qwcx/wet_dream_common_causes/,Wet Dream Common Causes,"Every single time I had a wet dream during a streak of retaining at least one of the following criteria were met :

(Order going from “most definitely able to cause WD” -> “ehh maybe…” )



1. Sleeping with tight pants/heavy blanket or another pillow with some weight around your midsection/on top of your meat. 

My theory is that the weight is felt by your body which puts pressure on crotch which gives a “reason” for your meat to get hard during sleep. When you are awake and have a hard on, dont do anything but put some pressure downwards on your meat. Maybe pull it down with a cloth or something. Immediately the meat resists and gets harder. Embarrassing to say but back in my gooner days I used a massage gun on my meat. And boy did that shit get full fast with blood. Not only that, once it gets hard, and i barely tap it with the massage gun downwards to it, it swells. 
Similarly, having tight pants or pressure on crotch area while sleeping somewhat stimulates that feeling, and your brain does the rest.



2. Excess Caffiene. This is one thats been warned about in the SR communities not only for WD but relapsing in general. Ive read them but brushed them off because im a bigg coffee lover. 

However it was last week when I was going on a good streak that I had 2 cortados and 1 latte (all with 2 shots and 3.5 sugar packets EACH) in the morning and another latter in the night, that I realized my coffee/caffeine addiction might be too much. I ended up relapsing that day, but multiple other days of much coffee consumption but no relapse still led to me having a WD.

Im not a big biology guy so I cant tell you the chemical processes happening with all that caffiene but now I see why so many in the SR community warn against it. 
Not only that it fuccs up your gums and stains teeth and breath.



3. Edging the night before- self explanatory . You can probably guess the reasons why.



4.  Waking up in the middle of the night, doing an activity, and going back to sleep.

Ok this one I can’t really explain the why, but for some reason it just happens. Maybe its a me thing.
Anyways lets say you wake up around 4am. Youre very sleepy but you decide to stay awake and start your day a bit. For one hour you do miscellaneous tasks around the house or whatever. At 5 you go back to sleep and have a wet dream. For me it doesn’t happen when I wake up and go to the restroom for 5 minutes or get some water, but rather when i stay awake for a while. 
Once again this one might be a stretch so feel free to not give much weight to this. But it happened enough times to me.


5. Drinking too much water before bed.
My theory is that as an adult the days of peeing in your bed are long gone (until old senile age - God protect us ). So the “muscle” that prevents peeing is strong. But your body wants to release that full bladder, so it causes you to have a WD in order to empty the tank a bit.
Seems kind of far fetched but i believe this is the case.

# Best Reclining Sofa with Cup Holders [2025 Reviews]

The reclining sofa with cup holders is the ultimate relaxation station for any living room, home theater, or entertainment space. It combines the comfort of a traditional sofa with the added functionality of reclining seats and convenient cup holders. This makes it perfect for movie nights, binge-watching your favorite shows, or simply unwinding after a long day.

In a market flooded with furniture options, finding the perfect reclining sofa with cup holders can be a daunting task. This review aims to simplify the process by providing a comprehensive analysis of key features, core benefits, common questions, competitor comparisons, and ideal user profiles to help you make an informed decision.

 ## Key Features Analysis

The best reclining sofas with cup holders are distinguished by several key features that contribute to their overall comfort, durability, and functionality.

**Reclining Mechanism:** The quality and type of reclining mechanism are crucial. Look for smooth, quiet operation and sturdy construction. Power reclining mechanisms offer effortless adjustment with the touch of a button, while manual mechanisms typically use a lever or handle. The reclining range should also be considered, with some sofas offering full recline to a near-horizontal position.

The reclining mechanism is often made of heavy-duty steel and should be rigorously tested for durability. Sofas with power reclining options should also have a backup battery in case of power outages.

**Cup Holders:** The cup holders should be strategically placed and sized appropriately to accommodate various beverage containers, from standard coffee mugs to larger tumblers. Deeper cup holders are less likely to spill, and removable cup holder inserts make cleaning easier. Some sofas also offer cup holders with LED lighting or heating/cooling functions.

The material of the cup holders also matters; stainless steel or durable plastic are popular choices due to their resistance to stains and ease of cleaning.

**Upholstery Material:** The upholstery material significantly impacts the sofa's comfort, aesthetics, and durability. Common options include leather, faux leather (polyurethane or PU leather), microfiber, and fabric. Leather offers a luxurious feel and natural durability but requires regular maintenance. Faux leather is a more affordable and low-maintenance alternative. Microfiber is soft, stain-resistant, and easy to clean, while fabric offers a wide range of colors and textures.

High-quality upholstery will be resistant to wear and tear, fading, and stains. Look for materials that are easy to clean and maintain to prolong the lifespan of your sofa.

**Frame Construction:** The sofa's frame provides the structural support and determines its overall stability and longevity. Solid hardwood frames are the most durable option but can be more expensive. Engineered wood frames, such as plywood or particleboard, are more affordable but should be constructed with high-quality materials and reinforced joints.

The frame should be properly braced and secured to prevent wobbling or creaking. Check for corner blocks and reinforced stress points to ensure the sofa can withstand regular use.

**Padding and Cushioning:** The padding and cushioning determine the sofa's comfort level. High-density foam is a common choice for its support and durability. Memory foam conforms to the body for added comfort. Fiberfill is a softer, more affordable option but may compress over time. The cushions should be well-padded and evenly distributed to provide consistent support across the entire seating surface.

Consider the firmness level of the cushions based on your personal preference. Some sofas offer adjustable lumbar support for added comfort and customization.

 ## Core Benefits

A reclining sofa with cup holders provides several significant benefits for users seeking comfort, convenience, and relaxation.

**Enhanced Relaxation:** The reclining feature allows you to adjust the seating position to your preferred angle, providing optimal comfort for reading, watching TV, or taking a nap. This reduces strain on your back and neck, promoting relaxation and reducing stress. Imagine sinking into your favorite reclining position with a warm beverage in hand after a long day 鈥?the ultimate in comfort.

The ability to recline fully or partially allows users to customize their seating experience to suit their individual needs and preferences.

**Improved Entertainment Experience:** The cup holders provide a convenient and secure place to store drinks, preventing spills and keeping your hands free to enjoy your favorite movies or shows. This creates a more immersive and enjoyable entertainment experience, eliminating the need to constantly reach for a side table.

Having beverages within easy reach allows for uninterrupted enjoyment of entertainment activities.

**Convenient Storage:** Many reclining sofas with cup holders also feature built-in storage compartments in the armrests. These compartments can be used to store remote controls, magazines, snacks, or other small items, keeping your living space organized and clutter-free. This added storage space is particularly useful in smaller living rooms or apartments where space is limited.

The combination of reclining, cup holders, and storage compartments makes the reclining sofa a multifunctional piece of furniture.

**Increased Comfort for Guests:** A reclining sofa provides comfortable seating options for guests, especially those who may have mobility issues or require extra support. The reclining feature allows guests to adjust the seating position to their comfort level, ensuring a more enjoyable and relaxing experience.

Offering a reclining sofa to guests is a thoughtful way to ensure their comfort and well-being.

 ## FAQs Section

**What is the ideal seat depth for a reclining sofa?**

The ideal seat depth for a reclining sofa typically ranges from 21 to 24 inches. This provides ample space for comfortable seating while also allowing enough room for reclining. However, personal preference plays a significant role. Taller individuals may prefer a deeper seat, while shorter individuals may find a shallower seat more comfortable.

Consider your height and build when choosing a reclining sofa with an appropriate seat depth.

**Are power reclining sofas worth the extra cost compared to manual recliners?**

Power reclining sofas offer the convenience of effortless reclining with the touch of a button. This can be particularly beneficial for individuals with mobility issues or those who prefer a more precise and customizable reclining position. While power recliners are generally more expensive than manual recliners, the added convenience and functionality may be worth the investment for some users.

Ultimately, the decision depends on your budget, preferences, and needs.

**What is the best way to clean a reclining sofa with cup holders?**

The best way to clean a reclining sofa with cup holders depends on the upholstery material. For leather sofas, use a leather cleaner and conditioner specifically designed for furniture. For faux leather or microfiber sofas, use a mild soap and water solution and a soft cloth. Avoid using harsh chemicals or abrasive cleaners, as these can damage the upholstery. Regularly vacuum the sofa to remove dust and debris. Clean cup holders with a damp cloth and mild soap.

Always test any cleaning solution on a small, inconspicuous area before applying it to the entire sofa.

This happened a few months ago, and I’m still angry enough to chew drywall every time I think about it.

For context: I (29F) have a Bernese Mountain Dog named Waffles. He’s huge—around 85 pounds—but the biggest sweetheart you’ll ever meet. Like, the kind of dog that lets babies pull on his ears without flinching. People are always stopping us during walks to pet him or ask about him, and I usually don’t mind. He brings people joy. Cool.

Anyway, it’s a Saturday morning, I’m walking Waffles through this local park with a coffee in hand, enjoying the fresh air. He’s trotting along like a giant happy teddy bear, and we stop by this little fountain area that has some benches. Chill vibes all around.

Enter: Karen.

She’s got the haircut. She’s wearing an athleisure set that probably cost more than my rent and pushing one of those souped-up strollers that looks like it was built by NASA. Her kid—maybe 5 or 6—is dragging behind her looking like he hasn’t had a single peaceful moment since birth.

Karen spots us and immediately starts power-walking over like she’s late for her next entitled outburst.

Karen: “OH MY GOD. HE’S SO BIG! My son wants to ride him!!”

I laugh, thinking she’s joking. Spoiler alert: she was dead serious.

Me: “Haha, yeah, he gets that a lot. But no, he’s not for riding. He’s a dog, not a horse.”

Karen: Blink blink. “But he looks strong enough. It won’t hurt him. My son LOVES animals.”

I look down at Waffles, who’s now sitting politely, wagging his tail like a good boy. He doesn’t even know he’s the center of what’s about to be the most unnecessary drama of the day.

Me: “I’m sure he does, but Waffles isn’t trained for that—and it’s dangerous for both the dog and the child.”

Karen: “You don’t need training to sit on a dog. You just need to be gentle. Besides, your dog’s clearly bred for this. Why else would you have a giant dog if not for kids?”

At this point, I’m stunned into silence. Like… did she just say my dog was bred to be a jungle gym?

Then she leans down to her kid and says LOUDLY:  
“Well, some people are just selfish, honey. They get animals like this and keep them all to themselves. Not very neighborly.”

I swear to God, I heard the record scratch in my brain.

I tried to be polite. Really. I even forced a smile and said, “We’re just out for a peaceful walk, and I’d appreciate it if you’d respect that.”

She huffed and walked off in a cloud of designer perfume and audacity.

BUT WAIT. IT GETS BETTER.

About 15 minutes later, I’m sitting on a bench, giving Waffles some water and scrolling on my phone, when a marked truck pulls up and a man gets out. Khakis, clipboard, badge.

Animal. Freaking. Control.

Guy walks up and says, “Hi ma’am, we got a call about a possibly dangerous animal being walked off-leash.”

I’m floored. My dog is sitting ON HIS LEASH next to me. He’s literally tied to the bench. Like he’s the most dangerous threat in the park and not a gentle loaf of fur who once got bullied by a kitten.

Me: “Uh… are you serious?”

Him: “Yeah. Someone reported that you were allowing an aggressive dog to threaten children and refusing to restrain him. Said you became hostile when confronted.”

I explain everything. The whole “can my kid ride your dog” debacle. The entitled demands. The sudden storm-off.

Thankfully, the guy is clearly over it.

Animal Control Guy: “Let me guess… about 5’5, bob haircut, designer sunglasses, pushing a luxury stroller?”

Me: “You know her?”

Him: Sighs. “We’ve had calls from her before. She once tried to get a Golden Retriever impounded for barking near her car. You're not the first. Won’t be the last.”

He checks Waffles’ tags, pats him (Waffles rolls onto his back for belly rubs—such a threat), and says we’re obviously fine. But he gives me his card “just in case she tries anything else.”

As he leaves, Karen walks by AGAIN, with that smug smile like she just did a public service. I’m standing there, steaming, heart racing, jaw clenched—trying not to say something I’ll regret.

You know that moment when you rehearse a killer comeback five hours later in the shower? Yeah, I’ve got about twenty of those now.

So anyway… that’s how I got reported to Animal Control for not letting a child ride my dog like a pony. Hope she steps on a LEGO.

TL;DR: Entitled mom demanded I let her kid RIDE my giant dog, I said no, she called Animal Control and accused me of having an aggressive animal. Turns out she’s a serial Karen. The dog is fine. I’m still mad.",21,1745602480.0,CharlotteDobreYouTube,8,0.92,False

 buy my own car.

For context, I just finished college (26f) and landed a job making 90k after taxes. 

I currently share a car with my mom. Yes I can use it, but imagine you’re a high schooler sharing a car with your mom. you have to tell her everywhere you are going, come home when she needs the car, etc.

I am 26, almost 27 in may, make good money, and feel ready for my first car. My mom has said i am going to ruin the rest of my life, im running away from my family’s help, self-sabotaging, and families that stick together, stay together.

i dont get why i cant have my own car. my older brothers have had their own cars since they were 16. and for reference, one brother was a teen parent, a drug dealer, dropped out of college, purposefully ran over somebody over with their car, and has a DUI record. my other brother has multiple felonies, a DUI, and has been in jail multiple times. he does not have a license. and hes homeless now. this past year, he actually stole my mom’s car for 1 month. it was reported stolen and he was reported a missing person. finally, the police called and found the car trashed and crashed at a tow yard in another state. my mom actually blamed me for denting the car even though i didnt hit anything. well, turns out my older brother was sneaking into the house and stealing the car. LOL i knew i didnt hit anything!

my brothers have both been bought several cars by my parents. im not complaining they didnt buy me a car because they helped me pay for college. but they are actually planning to give my dad’s old car to my brother that stole my mom’s car. he doesn’t have a license or a job and hes 47.

I have been saving up since i was 18 to buy a car. i have no tickets and no accidents. why can’t i get my own car? why am i “running away” if i do that? my mom said i should reject the job that pays 90k with benefits for a coffee shop job that pays $10 plus tips no benefits because it is closer (so she will drive me there). the 90k job is 8 miles away while the $10 an hour is 5 miles away. If i ubered to my job, it will cost $800 per month cheapest. 

am i seriously being “too independent” or “ruining my life” by buying a reasonable used car under $20k? 

edit: 
ok thank y’all for validating me.

another question:
is it okay if i dont get the mom my mom wants?

when picking a car, i want to get my “dream” car that i wanted since i was a kid (again, under 20k). its not a fancy car. its just a car that i had a toy of and always said that would be my first car. i found one with less than 40k miles, got it inspected, no prior crashes, etc.

my mom either wants me to get the same exact car as her or whichever car she picks out. its my money, and this car is a graduation present to myself. i am the first to go to college in my family and i am very proud of myself. i know my mom knows more about cars than me and have more life experience. i know her car is probably a better option. 

but is it wrong if i want to have some fun in life & not play it perfectly safe & get the car i want?",5,1745602445.0,makemychoice,27,1.0,False
1k7qtlm,https://www.reddit.com/r/JEENEETards/comments/1k7qtlm/thermodynamics_and_life/,Thermodynamics and life,"The chapter of 'Thermodynamics' in physical chemistry remains to be one of my favourites, partly because it was taught to me in an excellent manner.

The second law was of much fascination to me.  
If I look at it from the empty side of the glass, I find it terribly depressing.

It states that the total entropy of an isolated system can never decrease over time. Or in other words, the universe is always moving from order to disorder.

This has profound implications for everyday life.

If I brew coffee, let’s say, I want it to remain hot. I like my coffee hot, and I would prefer it to stay that way if I want a sip later. But the moment I stop actively heating the coffee, it will start to cool down. I can pour it into a thermos, but it will cool down anyway, the process just takes longer.

We can apply this to other aspects of life as well. If I stop actively maintaining my garden it will turn into a chaotic jungle of twisted branches and weeds.

If I own a car, it will gradually wear down until it breaks down completely.

We can do work to maintain and even temporarily increase the order of things, but inevitably it all becomes less orderly.

No matter how hard I work, my things will break down, my body will wear down, I will die, the Sun will engulf the Earth, and the Universe as we know it will cease to exist.

We are striving towards order, but it’s a lost cause.

\*\*

However, as I look at it from the half-full glass perspective, it is one of the most beautiful features of nature.

I want my coffee to remain hot. However, I would like my car seat to cool down when the temperature outside is almost a hundred degrees.  
I want to experience a cool breeze on a hot summer day.

I would like my garden in order, but nothing matches the grace of a wild, beautiful rainforest that grows without maintenance.

I might die eventually, but having a time limit to life makes me want to make the best out of it.

The order we are striving to get is the order of mind. I recommend trying to accomplish that.

I’ll be sharing it with my followers as well.      May, Seattle

The clouds hung low, the weather brewing with mugginess. Just after the typhoon passed, the air carried a damp mist, accompanied by a gentle breeze blowing into the room through the window.

The clock ticked slowly, steadily pointing to eight o'clock sharp.

Just then, there was a light sound outside the door. Upon getting a response from Stella Carlson, Aurora, dressed in professional attire, entered the hotel's presidential suite.

Merbeil, where Aurora worked, was the best-known wedding planning company in the industry, specializing in high-end clientele. Of course, the services provided were also absolutely considerate and meticulous, worthy of the million-dollar fee.

Two months ago, Merbeil received a commission for a luxury wedding. After internal competition, Aurora stood out and officially won the planning for this luxury wedding.

The top-floor presidential suite at SIMO Hotel was elegantly simple in style, yet luxurious details were subtly embedded. Even the water glasses casually placed on the coffee table were custom-made by Queen-W.

Upon entering the room, Aurora saw the bride, Stella, standing silently by the window. With a polite smile, she kindly asked, ""Miss Carlson, it's still early, would you like to rest first?""

Upon hearing her voice, Stella turned around. Her bright eyes were clear and charming, with a soft light akin to water. With chestnut hair and red lips, her delicate features adorned her swan-like neck and shoulders. Her skin resembled porcelain. She was draped only in a loose bathrobe, yet her beauty stunned Aurora, who was also a woman, almost rendering her unable to look away.

The beauty's gaze fixed on the clock on the wall, which was moving constantly. Then, with a faint smile, she gently asked back, ""Is it still early?""

Her voice was soft, as if asking Aurora, yet also as if speaking to herself, which puzzled Aurora a bit. After all, it was just past 8 o'clock, and according to the wedding schedule, it would be another two hours before Mr. Malone arrived.

As the head wedding planner, Aurora naturally had some understanding of the groom and bride.

The Malone family was among the few prominent elites, and the groom, Aaron Malone, was the current head of the Malone family.

This well-known young man was truly the pride of heaven, born with a silver spoon, educated in prestigious schools. He successfully launched a startup while studying, which later went public, and then orchestrated the largest medical merger in the industry after inheriting the family business.

However, the wealthy bachelor, what people found most fascinating was a rumor.

Many gossip accounts speculated about the ambiguous relationship between the elite Mr. Malone and the rising starlet in the entertainment industry, Avery Fletcher. Naturally, Aurora was also curious. But after interacting with him during this period, she felt that Mr. Malone's attentive care for his fiancée, Miss Carlson, didn't seem fake.

Miss Carlson was both beautiful and graceful, not inferior to Avery, who stood out in the entertainment industry for her looks. It was heard that she entered the Radiant Arts Institute with outstanding results in liberal arts in Seattle, and later pursued further studies at the Lawton Business School, a definite academic achiever. Such an illustrious lady with outstanding credentials and a personable demeanor. After two months, Aurora had become a loyal supporter of Stella.",1,1745602362.0,Hot_Romance_Stories,0,1.0,False

I’ll go first:
Pour over + a spoonful of doce de leite (dulce de leche).
I’m Brazilian, and honestly? Nothing beats this for me. The rich caramel flavor from the slow-cooked milk creates a buttery, velvety texture that melts on your tongue — and when it meets the clean acidity of a light roast, something magical happens. It’s sweet, nostalgic, and perfectly 
balanced by the clarity of pour over.

I (late 20s M) recently cut ties with a friend — let’s call him Charles — and now I’m questioning how I handled things and whether I’m being too sensitive or if I need to set firmer boundaries.

Charles and I met through my school’s library, and we clicked pretty quickly. I ended up opening up to him about some deeply personal stuff — childhood bullying, family issues, and mental health struggles, including suicidal thoughts. I thought he was someone I could trust.

Over time, things started to shift. He brought me to his church group, which I initially liked, but then he and his brother began pushing political conversations — especially pro-Trump stuff — even after I said I wasn’t comfortable talking about politics. At one point, he kept pressing me about whether my beliefs were “just inherited from my dad,” and when I didn’t want to answer, he wouldn’t drop it.

I eventually told him his behavior was making me uncomfortable and that I wanted an apology. He refused to apologize over text and insisted we meet in person (also told me the friendship is over prior to meeting). When we did, I even bought him a coffee, trying to smooth things over, but instead of apologizing, he basically told me I had low self-esteem, that I was dragging him down, and that I was ""talking like the devil."" He also tried to pray with me, which I declined. The whole thing left me feeling belittled and disrespected, so I walked away and decided to end the friendship.

Since then, I’ve stepped back from the church group and distanced myself from anyone in his circle. But lately, I’ve started feeling anxious — his brother randomly removed me on LinkedIn, and Charles has acted like nothing happened when he sees me, giving me fist bumps and being weirdly friendly. Some of his friends have reached out, but I haven’t responded much — just said I’m busy.

Now I’m worried he might be sharing personal things I told him during our friendship — especially the mental health stuff — and using it to make me look bad. I feel like I’ve lost control of the narrative and it’s eating at me.

**AITA for cutting him off the way I did, and would I be the AH if I reached out to mutual friends to clear the air or explain my side? Or should I just let it go and focus on moving forward?**

But this just wastes the time of the state schools as a member of staff needs to spend all day in appeals, but it’s not like the school can say ‘oh alright go on then we will somehow reverse the government decision for you!’ As the schools have no connection to the government and just participate in the appeals as they are required to.

1k7qenc,https://www.reddit.com/r/koreatravel/comments/1k7qenc/trip_report_incheon/,Trip report Incheon,"Just thought I would pass on some information about my recent experience, hope this helps someone.

Had a very short trip to Korea, last minute accompanying a friend for a conference (I only had 1 week notice). We stayed 4 days in Incheon and day tripped to Seoul.

I purchased an LGU esim for my phone upon arrival at the airport, which took only about 10 minutes, including waiting in line. It was about $19 for 4 days of wifi (no calling), which was ok for my needs. Verizon wanted to charge $12/day for their international service, so this was a nice compromise.

We took a taxi to our hotel which was easy. We exited the airport and went to the taxi platform which appears to be marked by zone. Since we were going to Incheon, we went to the sign with that city name on it, and a taxi pulled right up. We showed the name of our hotel written in Korean, and he repeated it back to us in English to confirm, and we were on our way. I think it was about $22 to the Oakwood Premiere in Incheon.

We used a combo of subway, walking and taxi. I downloaded the kride app before going and also have Uber. I found that most of the time Uber was the cheaper option and found the drivers to be more pleasant/polite (greeted me, sd thank you upon exit, kride drivers didn't say a word).

One minor issue we noticed: when taking longer subway trips (like our 1 hour 45 minute ride to Seoul), Naver would say things like “take Line 1 toward National University,” but that destination didn’t appear on the station signs. We had to cross-check the route by pulling up the subway map to see which direction included stops toward National University—just something to be aware of.

That said, the subway system is very clean, well-labeled (with English signage), and announcements are made in English too, which really helps.

Incheon was so clean with lots of restaurant options, and the parks are absolutely beautiful. Really great for early morning walks. The Songdo Hanok village is good for a walk through and to take pictures. There are many restaurants (we didn't eat at any). Singson Street between Convensia and Central was lively and had lots of eating options.

There are many coffee/pastry options available. My only issue is that I'm an early riser and would love to get a cup of coffee and a pastry earlier in the morning. Unfortunately, most coffee shops I found to not open until around 10 am, with a few opening at 9 am. There are some 24-hour chains places such as megacoffee, but they're more like kiosks, not nice coffee shops where you can go and sit.

The concierge at my hotel explained it was because people don't start work until later in the day (not sure if that's true as we saw many on the subway at 6am when we went to Seoul for the day). At any rate, be mindful of the morning situation. Speaking of the concierge, they were very helpful in finding the best way to navigate and also in finding shopping and restaurants. We stayed at the Oakwood Premier, which had stunning views of Incheon (the tallest building in the area)

Just plan on not much being open before 10 am. Even the Lotte Mart grocery store next to our hotel didn't open until 10 am. I guess you could say the benefit to the late openings was that most places stayed open later in the evening (like 11pm). So if you're a night owl, you'll love that.

That said, if I were planning another trip to Korea, I wouldn’t choose Incheon as one of my main stops. We made the most of our time there and had a great experience, but Seoul offered so much more in terms of cultural experiences, food, drinks, and overall energy. Beyond Seoul, I know there are even more incredible places to explore. We stayed in Incheon simply because we had free accommodations there—but if given the choice, I’d base myself elsewhere next time.

Papago translation was a lifesaver. We didn't eat at a single restaurant with an English menu (as a seasoned traveler, this is not a complaint in any way; we weren't expecting English, just a statement). We really tried to go to places where locals would eat and had AMAZING FOOD. Papago saved us, not sure how we would've communicated without it. That said, make sure to indulge in Korean BBQ—try all the sides, they’re incredible! Eat as much Korean fried chicken as you can get your hands on, and don’t miss out on staples like kimbap, jajangmyeon, and bibimbap.

We only had one day in Seoul, and it was incredible—definitely wish we’d had more time. One thing that stood out was how early everything opens. We arrived around 7:45 AM and found plenty of coffee shops and restaurants already bustling.

We visited Changdeokgung Palace and the Secret Garden—both beautifully preserved and absolutely worth it. Just a heads-up: the Secret Garden requires a separate reservation at least 6 days in advance, or it’ll likely be sold out. Don’t miss it—it’s peaceful, lush, and stunning.

Unfortunately, Gyeongbokgung Palace was closed the day we visited, but we still had a great time exploring. It rained the whole day, but the silver lining was far fewer crowds!

We visited both Ikseon-dong and Insadong, and each had its own charm. Ikseon-dong was full of cafes and boutique shops tucked into narrow, hidden alleyways. The blend of traditional hanok architecture with a modern twist made it super photogenic—great for food and atmosphere.

Insadong, on the other hand, had more craft and souvenir shops, plus plenty of places to buy traditional teas. For us, it was Ikseon-dong for food and Insadong for shopping.

I really wanted to get in on some Kbeauty purchases, but really didn't have enough time to research exactly what I wanted to buy. I was able to use Papago at Olive Young to ask questions about my skin type and they had good recommendations. Wish I would've had more time to shop around and explore different stores for beauty products, but Olive Young was great for last-minute shopping.

One last note about Incheon Airport (ICN)—it has two terminals that are about 20 minutes apart, so make sure you go to the correct one. I took a Kride taxi from my hotel (for my departing flight) and asked the driver, “Korean Air?”—but got no response. I then used Papago to say in Korean, “My flight is international on Korean Air. Is this the right terminal?” Still, no reply.

Eventually, he pulled over and motioned for me to get out. I wandered around the terminal for about 20 minutes—completely exhausted from the short trip, jet lag, and long days of sightseeing—before I finally asked the information desk. They told me I needed to go *outside* and take the white shuttle bus labeled 'Terminal 2'.

It took another 20 minutes to reach Terminal 2. That mix-up cost me nearly an hour, so I was very thankful I had arrived at the airport three hours early. Just a heads-up for anyone flying Korean Air: they use Terminal 2!

Four days was way too short for a trip to Korea, but I’m so glad I went. My friend had to work for two of those days, so I explored on my own—and as a female traveler, I felt completely safe the entire time. These reflections are simply based on our personal travel experience over the three full days we had to explore, and aren't meant to spark debate or controversy—just sharing what we observed.

Please don’t expect everyone to accommodate your language needs. While we found Koreans to be incredibly kind and helpful, most didn’t speak English in the places we visited—and that’s perfectly okay. We didn’t expect them to, and made an effort to communicate using Korean and a translation app, which was part of the experience.

There are plenty of Western-style malls and restaurants if you’re more comfortable in English (though we didn’t visit any), but I really encourage you to step outside your comfort zone. Embracing the local culture made the trip so much richer—you won’t regret it.

I matched with this guy on Tinder (we can call him Jay), we chatted a bit and then agreed to meet up for coffee. Yesterday when we met up for coffee, at first I thought Jay didn't really look like the pictures on his profile but maybe they were older and he was still really cute in person.

So the rest of the date went amazingly well! We really vibed and our coffee date became dinner and then ice cream and then we went back to his place to watch a movie. We did end up hooking up and I slept over. Overall we're very compatible, we talked about keeping things casual and testing the waters for something more serious and even have plans to meet up again tomorrow. I look forward to get to know him better and even if it's just having fun and nothing more, I have no complaints.

But here's the weird thing. I checked his profile again and I could tell the photos are not of him. I reverse image searched them and they're from a ""rate me"" post here on Reddit. The guy from the photos is objectively handsome but Jay is honestly really cute and is really my type. I remember mentioning at some point that the photos looked a little off and he said that they were older when he kept his mustache short, but they're not of him at all? They all came from the same reddit post, so clearly he lied. Everything else we talked about during the date checked out when we went back to his apartment, like the books he has, his hobbies and everything else. I honestly think he just used fake photos for some reason and he kept with the lie when I mentioned it.

Should I be bothered by this and mention it to him when I see him next? I can foresee a lot of reasons to use fake photos on a dating app, especially since they look kind of similar to him and he's still very cute. He did just get out of a long-term relationship and he also works for a place as a public organizer, so I can see both of those being tricky. I still like him, I just feel weird about what happened and would like to move on without making things bad. Any advice?

Read This Review!,"Testing out the Maxi-Matic ECT-1027 and its performance has made my mornings a little more exciting, though not without some caveats. As an avid toast lover, I’ve had my fair share of toasters over the years, but this one brings a mixture of delight and occasional annoyance. From bagels to puff pastry snacks, I’ve thrown just about everything at this toaster to figure out where it shines and where it falters.

**Design and Build Quality**  
The design is minimalist and refreshingly simple. Its clean white aluminum exterior complements most kitchen decors without clashing. I instantly appreciated the cool-touch exterior because, like many others, I have an unfortunate knack for bumping into things in the morning before my coffee kicks in. The toaster is lightweight and compact, making it a fabulous fit for smaller countertops or camper kitchens. However, it does feel a bit less solid than some heavier models I’ve used in the past. It’s not flimsy, but the lightweight nature may leave some users questioning its durability after years of use.

**Functionality and Settings**  
Every feature appeared straightforward, which is perfect for someone who hates fiddling with unnecessary settings first thing in the morning. The seven browning levels provide decent versatility, whether you prefer your bread lightly kissed by heat or charred (my partner’s strange preference). The cancel function adds a good fail-safe if you suddenly realize your bagel doesn’t need that extra 30 seconds. However, while testing all settings, I noticed the results weren’t always consistent, especially at the highest browning level, which left some slices unevenly browned—a minor hiccup for perfectionists.

**Pluses**  
- The self-centering feature ensures most bread slices get toasted evenly.  
- Wide slots accommodate thick bagels, homemade bread, and, surprisingly, certain pastries without cramming.  
- The toaster’s crumb tray is a handy addition! It slides out smoothly and saves you the agony of turning the toaster upside down to shake stubborn crumbs loose.  

**Critiques**  
- Inconsistent toasting at the darker settings can lead to slightly uneven results.  
- The lightweight body feels less sturdy compared to bulkier models on the market.  
- While functional, the 750-watt power output seemed slightly underpowered for quick, even toasting during busier mornings.  

**Check [Maxi-Matic ECT-1027 Cool Touch Toaster] price on Amazon.**  

**Performance and Usage Experience**  
One of the standout features of this toaster is its extra-wide 1.5-inch slots. Anyone with a soft spot for artisan bread or chunky waffles will understand the struggle with narrow slots in lesser models. Whether I toasted bagels or fluffy specialty bread, the spacing worked perfectly. The self-centering mechanisms do their job well, ensuring even heat distribution most of the time. Yet, there were occasions (especially with uneven bread slices) where I felt like the distribution lacked uniformity. Not a dealbreaker, but noticeable for someone as picky as me!

**Who Is This For?**  
This toaster feels tailored for small households, dormitories, offices, or RV enthusiasts rather than heavily trafficked kitchens. Its compact yet efficient design is ideal for limited spaces, and the cool-touch exterior ensures added safety in environments with young kids—or clumsiness-prone adults like me.

**Competing Products**  
In comparison to other contenders in the market, I found this model slightly more affordable and lightweight, but less feature-rich than some premium alternatives. Rival toasters like the Cuisinart CPT-160 are sturdier and provide more wattage for faster browning, but they often lack the portability aspect of this machine. The self-centering feature here also outperformed when compared to an older Black+Decker model I used in the past, which often left one side of the bread pale and the other side overly done. That said, pricier models might deliver slightly more consistent performance, especially for darker browning levels.

**Smart Spending**  
Bang-for-the-buck enthusiasts will appreciate what this toaster delivers for its cost. While competing models offer advanced features such as dual-toasting controls or higher wattages, the Maxi-Matic ECT-1027 focuses on the essentials and scores well—especially for light or casual users. In my opinion, this toaster is worth considering for its above-average functionality at a relatively budget-friendly cost.

1k7q6lj,https://www.reddit.com/r/work/comments/1k7q6lj/meetings_vs_work/,Meetings vs Work,"Hi, this has been bothering me for a while now. Recently, we had a change in management, and we transitioned from no meetings and flexible morning hours to 2-3 meetings per day, with daily standups at 8:30 AM. I prefer having slow mornings to ease into the day and focus on coding until about 5:30 or 6 PM. However, the new manager is quite rigid and expects everyone to adapt to HIS schedule.

I feel caught between two options:

1. Work from 8:30 AM \~5:30PM: Attend all the meetings and then stay late to get my coding work done. The meetings in the morning usually last anywhere from 30 minutes to an hour, and I find it difficult to get back into focus right after since there's a natural need for some decompression time (like grabbing coffee or just taking a breather).
2. Attend meetings online and start work around 10:30 AM: This would give me a slower morning, which helps keep my body and nervous system regulated. However, I’m unsure if this would be acceptable to my manager.

I really enjoy my work but struggle with early mornings. This is my first job, and with the current uncertainty in the job market for engineers, I'm hesitant to change jobs. I want to make sure I'm approaching this situation in a balanced way. Any advice on how to handle this would be greatly appreciated.",1,1745600867.0,work,0,1.0,False

so I always was a „gifted child” and both my parents and myself put pressure on my academical development. I was okay with it since I liked studying, reading and just learning in general. I even plan my future to be around it, i want to be academic teacher and researcher so I chose to work on two degrees at once. 

My problems with stress started long time ago, like in second year of high school when I put too much pressure on myself with some writing competitions but then i was dealing with it pretty well. 

About a year ago my life turned upside down when I was visiting my friend in city across the country (we live in rather small country so it was like 8 hours train drive) and I felt sick the entire time when I was there. My stomach hurt so badly and I felt so sick and dizzy then we had to come back to my city with 2 days delay. When I come back home I was feeling even more sick and I ended up in hospital. I was not there long, not even a day and I got some pills that kind of helped but not much. After 2 or 3 months I went to my doctor and told her that i still feel shitty and she gave me the diagnosis: gastritis. From then I started keeping the diet but I still can’t eat nothing spicy, drink coffee, drink alcohol etc. and it is slowly ruining my enjoyment of little things. Like recently me and my boyfriend had our 3 anniversary and we went to this fancy restaurant where we paid more than 100 euros for our meals each and we had go home early because i was feeling bad. 

Las month i finally visited my psychiatry doctor and he told me i have anxiety disorder and he gave me some meds. I still don’t feel any influence but i want to believe that it is too soon. 

Every time I’m at university I feel stressed for no reason, I can’t study things I love, I lost all my motivation, hanging out with friends is hard for me and I’m so mad that my stomach is permanently damaged because of the stress. It is ruining me and my plans for future as well as travelling or just eating out (I pretty much stopped doing that at all because I don’t know how would I feel after and it’s stressing me even more). 

I think I just wanted to vent and maybe find someone that can relate to me and also please don’t be too ambitious or it can ruin you like it ruined me ",0,1745600631.0,mentalhealth,0,0.5,False

First take some time to learn your innate first reactions to things. Are you optimistic? Pessimistic? Do you often immediately jump to beating yourself up, etc? Get a clear idea of your own knee-jerk responses to things in life.

Clear your mind before talking to her. Even just a steadying/intentional breathe before posing a thought in your mind.

What pops into your head in response? If it isn't your typical knee-jerk, if it comes with a physical sensation, you can be pretty confident that is your answer from her.

Examples from just this past 24 hours for myself(with a side note that due to my traumas, my knee-jerk reactions are always negative. So any positive ""pops"" are certainly not my own mind interfering because that grey blob of fat is an asshole).

I've been needing to clear out something negative in my life and I did some banishing work. My immediate reaction was peace and moving on, when normally I'd be ruminating like a sonofabitch all day. Nope, just a clear thought of ""I heard you. I got you. Let go.""

Last night as I was getting home, I was taking off my rosary and it broke. My immediate response would normally have been, ""damn, I fucked up. I hope I can fix it."" But instead, I got a physical chill and a ""pop"" of feeling protected. An urge to place it back on her altar for her to clean before I fix it/wear it again. 

Finally this morning, I forgot to pour her coffee. I have a condition that decided to act up yesterday(still unsure if it's connected to all the above, any interpretation of that is welcome), but I'm inclined to think that my body is just being my body. Anyways, I was up all night dealing with it and was tired trying to get out the door for work. When I saw the cup empty on the counter rather that my typical knee-jerk of ""I'm such an idiot, how could I forget?"" I recieved a 'pop' of ""It's okay, you're tired and it happens."" A sense of understanding and peace.

Some other things are stressful right now and anytime my brain tries to dip into that, I sense a gentle energy pulling me back and telling me that it is okay, bumps happen in the road, but she is at the wheel. She knows the destination and will get me there safely and happily. I can just be a comfortable passenger for the moment.

Main point here is, you don't ALWAYS get something intense or loud for answers. Sometimes it's just a 'pop' that you might dismiss or ignore if you don't take a moment to learn yourself and learn her.

Be still and listen.

By Eugene McCombs, April 24, 2025  
​  
In the ever-evolving world of digital loyalty programs, **Fetch Rewards** has emerged as a standout player. With a user-friendly interface and a simple mission — to reward shoppers for their everyday purchases — Fetch has garnered a loyal user base and disrupted the traditional receipt-based rebate model.  
  
**What Is Fetch Rewards?** Fetch Rewards is a free mobile app that allows users to earn points by simply scanning their receipts from grocery stores, restaurants, gas stations, and even online purchases. Unlike some cashback or loyalty programs that require you to shop at specific retailers or buy particular products, Fetch offers a flexible system that makes earning points accessible to nearly everyone.  
  
Founded in 2013 and headquartered in Madison, Wisconsin, Fetch Rewards was created with the idea that every shopper should be rewarded for their purchases, not just those who use store-specific loyalty cards or apps. Over time, it has expanded from a niche grocery rewards app to a broad platform that covers nearly all types of purchases.  
  
**How It WorksUsing- Fetch Rewards is incredibly straightforward:**

1. **Shop anywhere** – Buy what you normally would at any store.
2. **Snap your receipt** – Take a picture of your receipt using the app.
3. **Earn points** – Points are awarded for every valid receipt, with bonus points for promotional items or participating brands.
4. **Redeem rewards** – Use points to redeem free gift cards from hundreds of popular retailers, including Amazon, Target, Starbucks, and more.

Fetch also supports eReceipts, allowing users to connect their email and Amazon accounts to automatically scan for online purchase confirmations, making it even easier to rack up points.  
  
**What Makes Fetch Different?** What sets Fetch apart from other rewards apps is its **simplicity**. There’s no need to clip coupons, browse deals, or activate offers. All receipts are eligible for points — even handwritten ones in some cases — and the app processes them in seconds. Fetch’s growing list of partner brands also means there are often promotions and sweepstakes for users to engage with, offering even greater rewards.  
  
Additionally, the app has introduced features such as **team rewards**, where users can refer friends and form groups to track points together, creating a social element that motivates continued engagement.

In other words, I really want to get abused fictionally. Is this fem-brained?","I'm trans, Idk if it's just the fem-brain talking or if I'm onto something here. Hear me out, please.

In media, you get all these smut books where there's a constant theme of ""dark romance"", and it's all centered towards women. Do whatever u want or something... So long as you're not hurting anyone is my stance on these books and, I highkey want the MALE VERSION of these books. I don't mean that I want the POV of the male abuser— fuck no. I want the POV of the male getting abused.

Like, we get all these books where a cold-hearted CEO kidnaps a coffee shop worker with a boyfriend because she resembles his dead wife or something... I WANT THAT but with a two-faced duchess who traps me in an island miles away from civilization, gaslights me into thinking I've always lived this way, and tries to make me forget about my family back in the mainland, all because I ""had the eyes of a loyal guard dog"".

Think about it... Us men don't have books like this. We don't get books where we get to be dorky boys who obsess over a certain topics and are secretly being fought over by two girls—and if we do get them, it's REALLY FUCKING CRINGE. Not in the ""To All The Boys I've Loved"" cringe way, too.—As late teens and adults, we don't get these dark romances either...

grandpa and A have always been mean and sarcastic so this was the straw that broke the camels back.

i started crying and mom talked to her, then grandpa joined in and he also was against it. 

when i changed my prounoun he just called me by my name to avoid saying he/him, and now that i was also changing that he said, ""well can't i just call you grandchild?"" like wtf?! i had a panic attack and mom yelled at them. then a few weeks later they called on x-mas and just tried to ignore everything and act as if nothing had happened so we went no contact.

 every time we talk to grandma she either misgenders me or deadnames me and also she is still in contact with grandpa and A, she talks to them and invites them for coffee.

this makes me feel unsafe.

we have tried to tell her that but she says ""my relation ships should not affect you"" so we decided to talk to a family therapist, it was actually kinda her idea.

we had our first meeting and she defended them and didn't really listen, we have decided to have one more meeting and if she still doesn't understand we will be forced to go no contact with her as well.

1k7prq9,https://www.reddit.com/r/neighborsfromhell/comments/1k7prq9/oh_well_i_tried_to_be_nice/,Oh well. I tried to be nice.,"I (34F) have lived in the same apartment with my family (husband 38M son10 Daughter7) for five years. We have gone through a few neighbors because the ages my kids have gone through have not exactly been quiet. Fortunately, our landlord has been incredibly patient with us. We’ve done our best to take care of the property and have always avoided complaining about neighbors that have in our opinion been louder than us. We keep our heads down and live our lives until our last neighbor came. He was a young man in his late 20s, he seemed very polite the first time we ran into eachother and introduced ourselves. The way the apartment was set up his bedroom shared a wall with our living room. He had an old bed on springs so every time him and his girlfriend had “playtime” we could hear everything. 

As time went on things got hard harder. He worked nights (so sleep all day) or the opposite , worked days and sleep all night. He would play music and loud TV in the evenings and then sleep all day which of course is when the kids are going nuts when they’re home (Weekends, school vacations) sorry if that was all confusing. 

He eventually got a second vehicle, which just had to be a motorcycle and he had a girlfriend that slowly started coming over to the point where she was here every day. Even on the days that he worked during the daytime, her car was here and she would go on runs in our neighborhood and because his assigned parking spot was directly next two hours she had this weird thing about cleaning out her car and would always empty out her drink cups into our parking spot and she had a thing for iced coffee. It drove my husband crazy because whenever he would get in his car, the ground was all sticky. She even had the nerve ones to come knocking on our door to ask for help with her car because the guy was sleeping. My husband was at work but being the neighbor that I am, I went out and helped solve the problem. 

As time went on, he would bang on our walls when the kids were home on  vacation or on weekends in the middle of the day. he stopped saying hi to us when we would cross paths outside. he’d rev up his motorcycle at 5 AM,  leave it running for a few minutes to warm up and wake us all up. But we never complained about any of this.

Almost a year went by and the kids were on Christmas vacation. On Christmas Eve we got a knock on the door and it was the girlfriend. I answered the door. My daughter was hiding behind me and we were all in matching PJs. I greeted her with a hearty “merry Christmas!”. she was all dolled up, obviously about to leave for a party and she immediately starts with how maybe we could start to quiet down once in a while and how her boyfriend works at night. Keep in mind, it’s *christmas eve* and she does not even live here! I shrug it off and remind her that this was just how apartment living is. I think she was a little taken aback. She kept push pushing how he works at nights, but what could I say? She started getting irritated and then threatened and warned me about telling the office. I looked at the time and looked her in the eye and said “you do know it’s *7:45* on Christmas Eve?” I could not believe this is happening. She didn’t respond to that, she continued to ramble on about the noise and her boyfriend’s schedule. I let her know that we’ve been living here for five years, that they weren’t the first neighbors we’ve dealt with I did slip up and told her we also know that your bed has springs. We can hear your guys stuff too. She looked like I had slapped her so I do regret that I again reminded her that this is just how apartment living is, but she kept cutting me off by saying thank you repeatedly turned her back on me and walked away. I then heard their car start up and leave. So she literally came over on behalf of her boyfriend who actually lives here, on Christmas Eve when they were about to leave for a party. 

My husband was listening from the living room the whole time, he was furious. We have always stayed under the radar because we know we aren’t easy neighbors. So I said fuck it. I wrote a very long email to the leasing office and let them know everything. Apparently they did not know he had brought in another vehicle, that she was there as often as she is,  she came to the door they were pounding on the walls. The list goes on. So remember that the confrontation was on Christmas Eve? They were evicted and moved out on January 1st. It’s now April 2025 a new couple just moved in with a baby. Wish us luck.

<p>In today’s fast-paced world, stress has become an unavoidable part of daily life. Instead of relying solely on pharmaceutical solutions, more people are turning to natural remedies—like adaptogens—to help the body manage stress and promote overall well-being. In this article, we’ll explore what adaptogens are, highlight the top adaptogenic herbs, and show you how to incorporate them into your daily routine with products from Cozy Farm.</p>
</section><section>
<h2>What Are Adaptogens?</h2>
<p>Adaptogens are a unique class of herbs and mushrooms that support the body’s ability to resist stressors by balancing physiological processes. They work by modulating stress hormones such as cortisol, helping you adapt to physical, chemical, and biological stress. Traditionally used in systems like Ayurveda and Traditional Chinese Medicine, adaptogens have gained modern scientific attention for reducing fatigue, improving mental clarity, and boosting resilience.</p>
</section><section>
<h2>Top 5 Adaptogenic Herbs to Know</h2>
<ul>
<li>
<strong>Ashwagandha</strong> – Supports healthy cortisol levels, energy, and stamina.</li>
<li>
<strong>Rhodiola Rosea</strong> – Enhances mental performance and combats fatigue.</li>
<li>
<strong>Reishi Mushroom</strong> – Known for immune modulation and stress relief.</li>
<li>
<strong>Holy Basil (Tulsi)</strong> – Calming herb that also supports respiratory health.</li>
<li>
<strong>Siberian Ginseng (Eleuthero)</strong> – Boosts endurance and overall resilience.</li>
</ul>
</section><section>
<h2>How to Incorporate Adaptogens Into Daily Life</h2>
<p>Adaptogens can be enjoyed as teas, tinctures, powders, or capsules. Add a scoop of adaptogen powder to your morning smoothie, brew a cup of herbal tea in the afternoon, or take daily capsules for consistent support. Always follow the dosage instructions on the label, and consult your healthcare professional if you’re pregnant, nursing, or have any underlying health conditions.</p>

1k7pr0s,https://www.reddit.com/r/waterfilterreviews/comments/1k7pr0s/can_frizzlife_mp99_under_sink_water_filter_meet/,Can Frizzlife MP99 Under Sink Water Filter Meet Your Needs? Detailed Review,"Testing the Frizzlife MP99 Under Sink Water Filter has been an enlightening experience, especially for someone like me who values clean, great-tasting water at home. The convenience of having a filtration system certified to NSF/ANSI 53 & 42 standards right under the sink makes a huge difference for anyone who’s concerned about water quality. My kitchen routine involves a lot of cooking and brewing coffee, so having water free from chlorine, lead, and unpleasant odors is critical. This filter has certainly impressed me, but like all products, it’s not without its minor quirks.

**Design and Installation Simplicity**  
A standout feature of the Frizzlife MP99 is its compact design. Measuring 5.5 x 5.5 x 13.4 inches and weighing a practical 4.4 pounds, it was easy to install and didn't take up excessive space under the sink. The included dedicated stainless steel faucet is polished and modern, fitting seamlessly into my kitchen's aesthetic. No plumbing skills are required for installation, as the step-by-step guide was surprisingly clear. The brass feed water adapter valve was another thoughtful touch, simplifying the setup even further.

[Check Frizzlife MP99 price on Amazon.](https://usedwater.com/price/b07j9qrvdm/)  

**Filtration Performance**  
What truly elevates this under-sink water filter is its two-stage high-precision compound filtration system. It removes contaminants like chlorine, lead, and particulates while maintaining beneficial minerals in the water—something I've struggled to find in other water filters. The 0.5-micron precision filter is a game-changer. After a few days of running water through the filter, I noticed that my coffee tasted richer, and there was no lingering chlorine smell in my drinking water. It's refreshing to have tap water as pure as bottled premium brands without the waste or expense.

**Convenient Features**  
This product stands out with its innovative auto shut-off design. The quick-change twist-in cartridge system is incredibly satisfying to use and reduces the dreaded mess from filter replacements. I found it delightful that I didn’t have to shut off the water supply while replacing the cartridge—this is a big deal if you've ever dealt with clunky systems that leak everywhere mid-replacement. Beyond that, the high flow rate of 1.08 gallons per minute exceeded my expectations. Whether I needed filtered water for cooking or to fill my water bottle quickly, the flow was just right.

**Merits**  
- The filtration is effective without removing beneficial minerals.  
- Setup is beginner-friendly, with no tools required.  
- The dedicated faucet and brass feed adapter add sophistication and utility.  

**Bad Points**  
- The upfront cost might feel slightly steep for some.  
- Periodic cartridge replacements, though environmentally conscious, require diligence.  
- The filter doesn’t come with a built-in water quality detector to show when it needs replacement.  

**Eco-Conscious and Cost-Saving Design**  
One of the most underrated aspects of this product is its focus on sustainability. Unlike other systems, you replace just the core cartridge rather than discarding the entire casing. This thoughtful feature minimizes plastic waste and saves money on replacements. Each cartridge lasts up to two years under normal usage, though for more effective filtration, replacing it every six to eight months works best in high-use households like mine. It’s comforting to make an environmentally friendly choice without compromising quality.

**Competing Brands**  
Having tried a variety of under-sink water filters in the past, this one holds its own against popular models like the APEC ROES-50 and the iSpring RCC7AK. While reverse osmosis systems like the APEC and iSpring offer ultra-purified water, they often waste water during the purification process—a notable downside for those conscious about water conservation. The Frizzlife MP99 bypasses this issue entirely and retains essential minerals, which is something those other systems tend to strip away. On the downside, the Frizzlife doesn’t quite match the advanced multi-stage filtration of the iSpring, which may make it less appealing for users dealing with particularly hard water.

**Value Proposition**  
The price-to-quality ratio of the Frizzlife MP99 is impressive when compared to its competitors. Even though it isn’t the cheapest filtration system out there, the convenience, design, and robust filtration justify its value. You’re paying for a system that not only improves water quality but also respects your time and the environment. It’s the type of investment you won’t regret if you value convenience and health.

1k7pqpy,https://www.reddit.com/r/BPDlovedones/comments/1k7pqpy/you_should_know_what_i_need/,You should know what I need,"I F30 was discarded several times the last 2 years by my M40 boyfriend. We have kids. When he stopped drinking a few years ago he totally changed into a monster. Constantly emotional abusing me, yelling at me in front of our kids, nothing I did was ever good enough etc. I didn’t recognise the person I used to know, and I still don’t. 

A month ago he was diagnosed, and it all makes sense to me now. The constant discarding, emotional abuse, cheating, lying, using me. 
One of the reasons he kept discarding me was because I wasn’t meeting his emotional and physical needs. He often told me that he felt numb and needed me to massage him, cuddle, scratch him etc. so he could feel better, or feel something. I was litterally doing alle of it many many times a day.  I would give him massage for an hour in the evening a few times every week.. But it was just never enough. 
But one of the reason he kept discarding me was because I wasn’t able to know what he needed, when he didn’t even know it himself. And if I couldnt do that for him, then it wasnt love.. 
He told me I should KNOW that he needed to be cuddled, and he would EXPLODE in anger if instead of just doing it, I asked him “Would you like me to give you a massage?” Or “Is there anything I can do for you?” 
One time I asked him if he would like a cup of coffee, and he blew up. 
Is that BPD trait?
I’m so confused If I was to blame for this. Should I be able to feel and know what he needs, without him telling me?

My thoughts were more like, ""This lamp is so cool and original. I'll take it without hesitation.""

Alright, let’s dive into this! Imagine this: you get to *pick* one hour of your day to upgrade—like a magical hour where time bends to your will. Sounds wild, right? 😄 It's kind of like picking a superpower! But here’s where it gets real—what do you use that hour for? 

For me, that upgrade goes straight to the **morning grind**. Picture it: instead of waking up groggy, heading straight to my phone, and diving into emails (seriously, who invented that?), I’d flip the script! Here’s the plan:

- **Mindfulness Minute:** I’d kick things off with a quick meditation session. Just 5-10 minutes to clear my mind and *set the vibe* for the day. If coffee is the fuel, meditation is the *secret sauce*! 🧘‍♂️✨ 
- **Journaling Joy:** Next, I’d jot down three things I’m grateful for. Ever notice how focusing on gratitude shifts your whole perspective? It's like putting on those amazing rose-colored glasses. 🌅 
- **Epic Movement:** Then comes a power workout! Nothing too crazy—just enough to get the heart pumping. I’m talking about a mini dance party in my living room or a brisk walk outside—give those endorphins a chance to strut their stuff! 🎶💃 
- **Goal Setting:** Finally, I’d take a moment to map out my day. What are the top 1-3 things I want to tackle? It’s like having a mini roadmap to keep me on track. 🚀 

But let’s be real for a second. Upgrading an hour isn’t just about what you do; it’s about creating **intentionality**. What if your choice isn’t about *more* but about *better*? 

So, maybe you’ve got a different hour in mind. 

- **Lunch Break:** Could you transform that sometimes-dreaded time into a networking bliss? Think of surprising a colleague with a lunch invite. Who knows what opportunities could unfold over a sandwich!?

- **Commute:** What about making your drive commute much more enriching? Instead of zoning out, why not dive into an audiobook or podcast that excites you? 🚌🎧 

- **Evening Wind Down:** Or how about turning that Netflix scrolling into something that feeds your soul? Swap one episode for reading a book or practicing a new skill! 📚 

The point I’m trying to make here is that even an hour can *change the game*. What’s your pick for the upgrade? Is it something hot in the morning, or a vibe shift during the evening? Let’s get those creative juices flowing! 

Ultimately, we’re all just trying to squeeze the most out of these hectic, beautiful lives we live! ✨",1,1745599591.0,MaximizeMe,0,1.0,False

Part of me feels like it’s his bedroom furniture now, but another part of me feels like it wasn’t bought by him (or even for him, really), that I will have to recoup the cost of replacing furniture for that space, and then we’ll have to haul it all back when this little experiment blows up… Do I tell him the furniture stays at my house and he has to buy his own furniture for his own house? Or do I let him take his bedroom furniture? Thoughts? 

EDIT: the furniture is antique and ***heavy*** wood. Granted, it does need to be refinished, but it’s not newer, pressboard, disposable type furniture by any standard. One of many concerns is that it will be damaged by repeated moving and/or not treated well in a new home where it will be valued less sentimentally. I love the ideas where people suggested finding alternative furniture for him to take with him and the current furniture remaining where it is. I agree that is a good compromise. When he is older and more settled, he can have this furniture, if he would like it then. Thank you to everyone who addressed the actual issue in a helpful and productive manner. 

From our house/storage, son is already getting a couch, coffee table, lamps, a dining table and chairs, as well as dishes and pots/pans for the kitchen. None of it’s great, but it is all functional. And my son has a bed frame he purchased as well as a queen mattress. Not to mention his girlfriend has a bedroom full of furniture at her parent’s house. All I am asking about is protecting an antique chifforobe, dresser, and bedside cabinet. ",0,1745599583.0,Parenting,69,0.28,False

They were patients, grandma was sitting in the waiting area and grandpa brought 2 ice-creams, handed one to her, waited for her to start eating and then he started eating his.

1k7plq3,https://www.reddit.com/r/JapanTravelTips/comments/1k7plq3/tips_and_recommendations/,Tips and Recommendations,"Just recently returned from an 8 day trip. Here are some recommendations and tips.

Shinkansen from Tokyo to Kyoto
We arrived at the Shinagawa station at around 0700 and were able to purchase the tickets there. Seats together were easier to get in the morning, than it was in the evening. Purchase for the Green Car if you want to reserve your seats. 

Kyoto
For those looking to do the whole kimono rental experience. I’d definitely recommend going with one of the shops within the temple area. If you’ve never worn the traditional footwear (Geta), then it can be a bit awkward and uncomfortable, so you’d want to be as close to the temples as possible.

Lodging in Kyoto 
We opted to stay at a capsule hotel for the night (First Cabin). Our family of three (Two adults and one 17yr old) stayed there without any issues. The facilities were clean and the staff were very helpful.

Nara
Go deeper into the forest for calmer/less aggressive deer and better pictures. Many of the deer you first encounter at the entrance to the park can bite or even hurt you if they have horns. One with little horns bruised me up quite a bit.
Look for a small shop deep in Nara Park that sells a delicious sponge cake. I highly recommend the Nara Honey Lemon flavor!
We ate at this place where they serve sushi that is pressed and wrapped in persimmon leaves, which is unique to Nara (Izasa-Nakatani-hompo Yumekaze-hiroba). The food and atmosphere was so warm and relaxing. One of our favorite meals of the trip. Try to get there around the time they open, because it’s a small place, and fills up quickly.

Akihabara
Went shopping for some anime souvenirs at Mandarake, Radio Kaikan, AmiAmi, Hard Off, and Book Off.

Nakano
Went to Nakano Broadway for some more souvenir shopping.

Ueno
We went to a cafe with foot bath and massage (Mominoki House). Would only recommend back massage if your back is sore. If not, then I’d highly recommend getting the foot massage! I received both, and in my opinion, the foot massage was better.

Sumida City
I recommend doing the Sumida River Walk, if the weather permits. You can even book river boat tours. There are a whole bunch of cool and trendy coffee/pastry shops around Sumida Park.

Tokyo Sky Tree
I thought it was ok if you just wanted to look at the skyline, but I went during the day and you could barely make out Mt. Fuji due to the clouds. I think it would be a much better view at night. 

Sumida Aquarium
I thought it would have been larger, but I guess since it’s in the same facility as the Sky Tree Tower, space is limited. Not worth it in my opinion.

Shibuya
Went to Shibuya Crossing, and ate at the all you can eat snack and beverage place above Starbucks (Share Lounge). We were able to get a good overhead view of Shibuya Crossing from the lounge. We had reservations for (ChikuChikuCafe), a hedgehog cafe that my step daughter wanted to go to. They give you time options, 30 or 60 mins, we went with the 60 mins option. We enjoyed it, but I think 30 mins would’ve been enough. Afterwards, we went and grabbed some coffee at Anakuma Cafe, where a Bear’s Paw hands you your drink through a little hole in the wall. We had reservations for custom made fragrances at The Flavor Design Store. I highly recommend it. The staff is super friendly and helpful, and each bottle is super affordable at 4400 yen. We went to Jins for eyeglasses. Reservations are recommended if you want an eye exam done as well, but we were only buying frames, so one wasn’t necessary.

Asakusa
We got there 30 mins or so before the shops began to open. We managed to get some Melon Pan with no line, super delish. The temples and shrines get crowded quickly, so try to take your pictures as soon as possible to get them out of the way. We went to a Cat Temple, which was a bit away from the main temples in the area, but it was cute and not crowded at all. We waited in line at Wagyu Ichinoya for almost 2 hours and it was good, but not worth the wait in my opinion. Bought an extra suitcase for cheap at D. Kelly. Had a very delicious and affordable Tonkatsu meal at Tonkatsu Oribe.",0,1745599448.0,JapanTravelTips,5,0.5,False

I appreciate the opportunity to be used and thought of by her leading up to her birthday even briefly. 

I appreciate the opportunity to humiliate myself and display her power over me quasi publicly. 

I appreciate her gentle and confident drain that isn't heavy handed. She knows I'll fold and her lack of ""convincing me"" is so attractive. 

I appreciate her respect of my limits and being able to sense when I'm drained and need the rest to make it to my payday. 

I appreciate her taking her time out of her night out with friends to give me the choice if I want to send to impress or give her friends a chuckle that she has a sub that will send on a whim of hers. Not giving me a number but letting me decide. Went a little heavy but that's totally on me and I can live with my decision. 

I appreciate i got a photo that want posted of her beautiful manicure (that I was lucky enough to send for) and pedicure ( that is was lucky enough to be given advance warning that I'll need to pay for it soon. Just by saying ""think I might need a new Pedi soon"" again, that gentle guidance I love. 

I appreciate that I get to think of her constantly now after being used so heavily and drained so well. 

I recently completed a goal my Domme gave me. I mean a smallish goal initially $1111 for her upcoming birthday and then another $333 added on for concert tickets with her friend. Plus money for a plane ticket for her friend to visit her on her birthday. I got to fulfill a Sephora order. The first in a long time. I can't tell you how much I love paying for that order for pickup with my humiliating pet name on the pickup order and hearing how amusing it is to the women working there when she picks it up. The way she just sent me screenshots of her Sephora basket without being pushy. We both know my place and it's nice to know we both silently understand what my role is. While out that night having fun while I was at work and getting a tipsy message asking if I wanted to impress her friends made me feel so thought of and validated as a sub. Also respectful of my limits just by asking me instead of telling me and not giving me a minimum but left the decisions up to me. I am riding pretty high and feel so so good about the privilege to serve. I am just grateful I have a side hüstle that is making this possible. ",8,1745599375.0,paypigsupportgroup,3,0.91,False

1k7pi0b,https://www.reddit.com/r/digitalnomad/comments/1k7pi0b/random_rant_about_living_in_mexico_can_anyone/,"Random rant about living in Mexico, can anyone else relate? maybe similar in your host country?","\>also please share your host countries experiences if you wanna share! I'd love to read em Sup homies!

\>this is super long so i totally get it if you wanna skip off, but I felt like I had nowhere else to get this all out. This is just for the lulz..

Hey so first off I just want to preface this post by saying I LOVE MEXICO and its people. I actually have blood relatives that are Mexican. theres tons of things I love about it which is why i've chosen to make this my home for the past several years. But this post isn't about all the awesome things about Mexico. This post is just a random rant about:

\-Random asss shit I've encountered living here  
\-Straight up anoyying ass shit  
\-Weird shit

Lol all that being said, heres a little bit more about me - I'm of mixed latino ethnicity, my spanish is fluent. I was born and raised in an english speaking country and I've been living in Mex for a few years. So i'm very aware of the culture and very much been ""in it"" my entire life so I feel I can share some perspective on it. Everywhere has pros and cons but for this post it'll just be focused on cons.

I just wanna use this outlet and see if anybody living in Mex, or any other developing nation who experiences anything similar. I'm sure things like barking dogs etc its pretty much standard in many developing nations. I'm gonna go a little deeper into other weird shit that happens here in Mexico. I'll break down each random thing I wanna rant about in point form, below.

1. Random ass noises at random ass times. I shit you not, there's this dude that comes around unpredictably on random days of the week at like 9am...playing the fucking trumpet at FULL blast. So, the entire time I'm thinkin its prob just a shitty neighbour. but NO...It's actually some random dude making rounds around the neighbourhood being a nuisance. But it gets weirder...This guy is expecting a TIP.... lmfao... one day I'm walking across the street and I see this guy playing and hes like going door to door asking people who are outside and stuff for tips like with a tip jar. Like.. bro WHAT? I swear you cant make this shit up... like you're walking around early am, and being a nuisance wasnt enough but you also THINK people are going to PAY YOU? for the priviledge of being anoyyed as fuck? Lmao insane.
2. another thing I've noticed and this is a real WEIRD one. IS...So I live in a small building and I'm on the 4 floor. And cross the street there is a little store, like a mom and pop 7/11 type of store. So theres lots of foot traffic in and out. and theres this kind of, stoop on the sidewalk. so you can technically sit down on it kinda like a bench if that makes sense. And theres these dudes just like random ass dudes... EVERY. FUCKIN. DAY... that just SIT THERE... and drink NON STOP and talk shit. From literally 8am when they open...till 11pm at night when the store closes, and even stay beyond that. They will sit there for HOURS at a time...Obviously at some point they F off, and I guess, go home to maybe take a shit or something....But then theyre RIGHT BACK like say an hour later. Its like they do SHIFTS on this stoop and just sit there and drink and talk shit the entire day. Guys...These are GROWN ASS like 40-56 year old men. Dont these fuckers work? In a place like mexico, thats what really just blows my mind... is HOW are they even doing this... I'm talking 7 days a week EVERY damn day.. at all hours of the day. its not a ONE off thing. And guys its SUPER HOT here like 35 degrees celcius and humid everyday. So theyre literally in that blazing heat the entire time too. ALSO....another crazy thing is like, imagine...just living in the houses right beside that store and having these losers just literally right outside your front door, all day long drinking and talking shit... and having to hear their conversations the entire day from AM till midnight. I mean im on the 4th floor of a building and i could hear them. Just no respect man, and thats the thing that gets me but at the same time its taught me what do look for when i look for apartments.
3. My experience has been with a lot of Mexicans, they just cant tell you no straight up. Theres been countless times where they will commit to something..Then when its the date for that thing..theyll just keep making random excuses basically until you just give up and stop asking. not even a ""hey i got X going on, not sure about that thing right now, but I'll let you know"" its more like ""Oh ya so, i cant monday because of X, but friday were good"" ... then friday comes and its literally the same script repeated till you give up...lmao kicking the can down the road.
4. An addition of point 3. But basically this same phenomena happens not just with randos but even ""professional"" people like lawyers, technicians etc. For example I was on the phone with a lawyer once. I told the lawyer the basics of my inquiry then I told him I wanted to make an appointment for X date. So I said alright awesome lets make that appointment for Thursday at 12pm. So i show up to his office at 12pm...Sitting there for like 40 minutes, till the receptionist passes me the phone(its the lawyer)...Hes shocked that im there. im like dude, do you not remember we made an appointment like fucking 4 days ago?... bro hits me with the ""Oh, but you didnt confirm so I wasnt sure if you were serious"" .... LMAO..... wtf do you mean? my literal words were ""Lets make an appointment for 12pm thursday"" How the fuck else was i suppose to say for you to know I was ""serious"" about it...Then theres other times where my air conditioner guy for example... one day the dude was suppose to come for a regular maintenance appointment(he was my guy for 2 years) ... just all of a sudden doesnt show up to the appointment then I never hear from him again. just total ghost. Other times, ESPECIALLY for appointments...I swear, the appointment will be set for say 12pm....its now 12:05pm, you call bro like yo where tf are you? and hell tell you in the most CASUAL non chillant way, that hell be there in like 30 mins...like hes not already late. But then if you ask him to tell you an actual time hell be here, hell tell you like 3pm...Which would be 3 hours late. Its like these people just have no fucking concept of time or respect...You could be waiting ALL day for some asss to show up. They give ZERO fuckss about YOU and YOUR TIME and what YOU have to do that day... lmao they act as if like, oh ya this dude got nothing going on he can just wait all day.
5. This one was so weird to me. So...At some restaurants here, they'll bring out some bread that you never asked for. So any normal person would think oh ok thats nice maybe its complementary with my coffee, for example.  But no...if you consume it, theyll just put it on your bill at the end. But they wont tell you theyre charging you for it when they bring it. And I find this ""type"" of shit happens ALOT...basically ANYTIME any place or service offers you literally ANYTHING it could be the smallest thing... theres always some angle. NOTHING is ever free. Literally at the barbershop, the barber will offer you a beer...And you're prob thinking oh wow what a chill ass dude... but nah, hes just doing that to charge your ass for it later and prob expect and good tip to for being ""Cool""... I just hate that fake shyt..and deception. Like the people here are very like, dont see the end game or the bigger picture of their actions.
6. Public display of affection here is VERY normal, which is meh...but sometimes it can just be flat out uncomfortable AF, when you're standing in like at a starbucks on a busy day with families everywhere and you got some couple just going at it right infront of you in the line. for literally the entire duration of the line.
7. Kind of to piggy back off point 6. I noticed mexican dudes are SUPER needy af..For example when I described the pda thing...Its almost always the dude like smothering the chick...the chick will kinda just go along with it but its almost like shes a little anoyyed... but its almost never the chick like initiating or being all over the dude...its always the dude just looking super desperate and grabbing or you know making that initial contact etc..
8. To add to point 8, obviously im talking about in general but chicks can be weird as hell too..Like I met this one mexican girl and honestly wasnt that into it, drunken night type shit... anyways, we exchanged numbers...And we never really built like any rapport or connection etc, and i was super cold and dry so she would get the hint...But she would just ring off my phone...I would ignore...And then she would randomly send me whatsapp sharing her location, when i never asked her for it...just totally randomly...OR send me random videos from facebook.... lmao so it can happen in reverse(the neediness) just more common the other way around.
9. Drinking is so common and normalized, that youll see people literally drinking on the job. Like for example a delivery driver for a big box company, and you just see a bunch of tall boys in the center console while hes working. Taxi drivers... Like its actually really messed up and concerning...But ironically enough, I havent really seen any crazy accidents...ofcourse they happen but im just saying from my own eyes. How normal this is in this society is mind boggling to say the least.
10. Another thing people do, is they will park their cars in some random street(right infront my building) and just hang out in their car for hours on end..They arent meeting anyone, dropping anyone off, nothing. Just sitting there in the car on their phone watching videos. Also sometimes couples will do the same and just start randomly having a makeout sesh... im talking full grown adults 30+
11. nobody knows how to drive, nobody cares if theyre holding up all the traffic behind them. theyll stop the car in the middle of the road and just start talking to their buddy.. and oddly enough itll take minutes before people start getting anoyyed enough to honk
12. related to the driving thing...People will be driving slow AF...And then just come to a FULL STOP. Theres tons of space on either side by the way to pull over and do whatever they gotta do like text or whatever. but no. they will just stop in the middle of the road to do or finish whatever they are doing for a solid 5 minutes knowing that theres cars coming behind...Not a care in the world.

Ingredients (per serving)
	•	1½ oz Jamaican pot-stilled rum (e.g. Smith & Cross)
	•	½ oz demerara or dark brown sugar (or simple syrup at 1:1)
	•	5 oz freshly brewed hot coffee (medium-dark roast)
	•	1 oz heavy cream, lightly whipped (to float)
	•	Grated nutmeg or a cinnamon stick, for garnish

Method
	1.	Preheat & sweeten
	•	Warm your glass (or mug) by filling with hot water; discard water.
	•	Add the demerara sugar to the warmed glass.
	2.	Build the drink
	•	Pour in the rum. Swirl to help dissolve the sugar.
	•	Slowly add the hot coffee, stirring gently until all the sugar is dissolved.
	3.	Top with cream
	•	Using the back of a spoon, float the lightly whipped cream on top of the coffee-rum mixture.
	4.	Garnish & serve
	•	Dust the cream with a little freshly grated nutmeg (or perch a cinnamon stick as a stirrer).
	•	Serve immediately—drink through the cream for that perfect hot-cocktail “cap.”

⸻

Tips & Variations
	•	Spiced twist: Drop in a clove or two during brewing, or add a pinch of allspice for an extra island vibe.
	•	Dairy-free: Swap heavy cream for canned coconut cream—whip it just enough to float.
	•	Stronger funk: For even more “guyana meets jamaica” character, split the spirit: 1 oz Smith & Cross + ½ oz aged Demerara rum.
	•	Sweetness level: Adjust the sugar to taste—or swap brown sugar for maple syrup for a deeper sweetness.

This little gadget claims to keep beverages warm and consistent, so I tested it every single morning for coffee, tea, and even a cup of hot chocolate. Let's dive into the specifics of this product and my personal experience.

**Design and Build Quality**  
The design stood out to me immediately—lightweight yet sturdy. Even without being excessively decorated, the aluminum material provides a sleek, no-frills aesthetic. Beyond appearances, the sealed insulated heating plate turned out to be incredibly functional. My coffee-loving coworker spilled water right next to it, but the splash-proof feature ensured the device kept working without a problem. Thanks to its long 59-inch cord, it fit on various desks around my office setup. However, I also noticed small remarks online about the build quality not meeting everyone's expectations, as some reviewers mentioned feeling the materials seemed a bit less premium than desired.

**Adjustable Temperature Control**  
One compelling feature I tested extensively was the adjustable three-temperature setting. It gently kept my drinks at warm temperatures, ranging from 104°F to 149°F (40°C to 65°C). Switching between temperatures requires just a tap on a single button, which is certainly convenient. My tea tasted delightful at the mid-setting, while the higher setting was ideal for coffee. This worked perfectly with my go-to mugs with flat bottoms, though rounded mugs didn’t heat quite as evenly.

**Automatic Shut-Off Feature**  
The auto shut-off system proved to be a lifesaver on more than one occasion, shutting off after four hours if forgotten. One of my colleagues even joked it saved her twice in one week when she rushed out, leaving the warmer running. Furthermore, the blinking indicator warning of residual heat added a layer of safety rarely seen in other warmers I've tested.

**Ease of Use and Portability**  
Its petite and lightweight nature made it an effortless addition to my home and work routine. Cleaning was relatively straightforward; wiping the heating plate with a damp cloth was usually all it took to keep it spotless. Over time, I even carried it along on weekend trips. Unlike many similar products, this one didn’t jar or seem prone to damage when tossed into a travel bag.

**Winning Points**  
- Three temperature settings allow versatility for different beverages.  
- Splash-proof design ensures durability against accidental spills.  
- Automatic four-hour shut-off reduces worries about overheating.  
- Compact dimensions fit easily on small desks or counters.

**Critiques**  
- Less effective with mugs that have curved or textured bases.  
- Material quality, while functional, could have felt more premium for the price.  
- Some users may find operation limited without multiple dedicated control buttons.  

**Safety and Compatibility**  
During my testing, it consistently managed mugs with bases up to 3 ⅝ inches but struggled slightly with larger or oddly shaped mugs. A silicone lid helped maintain beverage warmth longer, especially in cooler office environments. I tested this suggestion after noticing other users had success with silicone lids, and it made a difference when using the low-temperature setting.  

**Product Comparisons**  
Comparing it side-by-side with competitors like the Mr. Coffee Mug Warmer, this VOBAGA warmer stood out in terms of temperature control options. Where Mr. Coffee focuses on simplicity (offering just one heating level), this product feels more tailored to users who enjoy customizing heat. On the downside, pricier options like the Ember Mug boast self-heating capabilities, which provide even greater portability and precision, but cost significantly more. Ultimately, VOBAGA delivers solid results for a fraction of Ember's price point.  

**Price to Quality Ratio**  
Affordability was one of the key reasons I gave this product a shot, and it didn’t disappoint. While not the cheapest option out there, the combination of performance features like adjustable heat and safety settings makes it worth the investment. However, buyers searching for ultra-premium materials might need to adjust their expectations slightly.

1k7peen,https://www.reddit.com/r/EasyWebDesign/comments/1k7peen/how_to_get_free_or_cheap_web_design_work_from/,How to get free or cheap web design work from startups?,"Stop doing web design for free, if you want to earn money.

Many startups, you see, they need website. But cash? *Poof!* Gone. Like my chai disappearing on a Monday morning. They want fancy design, but wallet is empty. Why is this? Well, they focus on big idea, make product work. Website? ""Later,"" they say. Is like building car engine, but forgetting seats. No good! Startups also like change. Logo today? Different tomorrow. Spending big money now? Maybe waste.

So, how get web design work from these startups without starving? I tell you some secrets, but listen good.

First, build portfolio. No work to show? Nobody hire. You help startup with simple website. Is trade. You get experience, they get website. Sarah did this for a cafe. No money, but big portfolio piece. Then, paid jobs came like monsoon after summer. But be careful! Startup might ask for too much. Be clear. Write down what you do.

Second, internship. Find one, even if pay is small. Is like school, but real. You learn from pros. John did this, got full-time job. Good deal! Look on LinkedIn, AngelList. But, make sure they teach you. Don't just fetch coffee.

Third, equity. This is gamble. Startup give you small piece of company. If they become big like Google, you rich. But most die. Forbes says 90% fail. David got lucky, big payday. But, check company very good. Talk to lawyer. This is not easy thing.

Fourth, contests. Be careful! Some startups just want free ideas. You design logo, they steal. Bad! Research contest first. Read small print. Better to avoid sometimes.

Fifth, network! Go to startup meetings. Talk to people. Tell them you design websites. Good words spread fast. Is like sharing sweets with neighbors.

Sixth, help good cause. Design for non-profit. You feel good, plus, people see you are good person. This also brings business.

Remember these things: Write down everything you do. Protect design. Get testimonial. Know your worth. And be careful of red flags!

Tools you can use: LinkedIn, AngelList, Behance.

Free web design is good for start, but not forever. You learn, you grow, you charge money. Okay? Like my father says: ""Hard work, good reward."" Now, go design!

It’s cool to see such a quality shop where I grew up. Definitely try the Nestor Lasso while it’s still here. Incredible lattes.

1k7pcdo,https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/1k7pcdo/i_inherited_sleepwalking_from_my_dad_now_im/,"I inherited sleepwalking from my dad. Now I'm finding videos on my phone I don't remember taking, and I'm always headed for the same place","This is a bit of an odd one, but stay with me. 

Some background first—when I was about eleven, my dad killed himself. It was horrible, sure, but not exactly surprising. He never spelled it out, but his childhood sounded pretty horrible, and whatever he dragged out of that hellhole followed him into adulthood. I wasn’t there when it happened—if the town gossip is to be believed—when my mum found him, she took a long drag on her ciggie, blew smoke toward the ceiling and muttered to the constable, deadpan as anything: “Figures he’d go out like his dad.” 

Cold, yes. But technically accurate. He did top himself in the exact same way his dad did. 

Then about eight years later, my older brother followed suit. Eleven months after that, my uncle. Both of his sons, too, eventually—though I wasn’t close to my cousins, so I couldn’t tell you when exactly they clocked out. It was just something I learnt of months or years after the fact, after bumping into some mutual acquaintance in the grocery store and it was mentioned in passing.

Suicide clusters happen, right? It’s a thing. Some psychologist somewhere would probably say it was environmental or neurological or some fancy combination of both—poke around our grey matter and pin it all on some rogue gene or deeply ingrained trauma. Stamp a tidy little explanation on the mess and call it a day. 

That’s what I thought, anyway. Seemed logical. Made sense.  

I’d argue misery’s the default setting for most men—especially when there aren’t enough distractions to drown it out. My family lived remote for generations—miners, mostly—and if the Sunday markets or drinking by the creek isn’t your thing, there was sweet fuck-all else to do. Let’s just say there’s a reason our town of roughly eight hundred people is considered the ice capitol of Western Australia. 

I’m telling you this because that’s the theory I clung to for years. Why the men in my family kept dropping like flies. We were just a long line of blokes raised hard by mothers who were too exhausted to love properly, and fathers who were either working or already dead. So far removed from anything resembling connection that the isolation—that insulation—settled on us like dust. That feeling of being small, inconsequential, stuck. It wears you down. Inherited misery. Plain and simple. 

So, anyway. I turned seventeen, dropped out of school. My grades were shit, and every day I’d drive past the open pit at the Carbanak Resources Iron Mine and feel like if I didn’t move—didn’t do something—I’d end up at the bottom of it. So I left. Reached out to a cousin on my mum’s side I barely knew, who was looking for flatmates while she studied. Figured, why not. Gotta break the cycle somehow. 

And I did. Or I thought I did. 

About three months ago, I woke up standing in the middle of the bush.  

Now, there were a few odd things about this. 

One: it’s fucking disconcerting to wake up and not be in your bed—especially when you’re ninety percent sure that’s where you started. 

Two: I live in metropolitan Melbourne. Suburbia. Public transport. Good coffee. If you see a possum, it’s in a wheelie bin. And suddenly, I’m in the *bush* bush. 

I’m talking paperbarks and gums. Midgies going to town on me like I’m the best thing they’ve tasted in years. The ground’s water-starved and rough, my bare feet are shredded, and I’m one unlucky step away from a funnel web or something blowing a gasket in my ankle. Phone was dead.  

Took me almost two hours to stumble by way onto a highway, sweat-soaked and still in my pyjamas, before some trucker took pity on me and gave me a lift to the nearest petrol station where I had to borrow the clerks phone to ask my cousin for a lift.  

And listen—because I’m open to being told I’m crazy—I’ll level with you. I’d had a fair bit to drink the afternoon before. Not blackout or anything, but enough that the tail-end of the night’s a bit fuzzy. I remember taking dozens of photos in a photobooth—still have those pictures somewhere, my arms draped around people whose names I don't remember.

So that was my best guess: that drunk-me had gone wandering, maybe chasing a late-night kebab (wouldn’t be the first time), misjudged the direction entirely and just kept going. 

Only thing is, when I retraced the route later—by car—it would’ve taken me nearly six and a half hours on foot to get to where I woke up. Through bushland. No tracks. No roads. No clearings. Just scrub. 

Any other guy, any other family history, I might’ve called myself a bit of a legend and had a good laugh about it with my friends. Only, that day, when I woke up in the bush, I was so terrified I was *cold*, even staggering back in forty-degree heat.  

Because I’d seen this before. 

My dad used to do the same thing.

Towards the end—before he slung a length of rope over the steel beam in the shed and decided to see if he could fly—Dad would wander off all the time. 

Got to the point where Mum, who’d been sick of his shit for the better part of twelve years, just started leaving the back door propped open with an old shoe. Easier that way. Less banging when he tried to shoulder it open at dawn. 

Sometimes I’d be halfway through my Weetabix when he’d stumble back in, covered in dirt or leaves with this look on his face. He wouldn’t talk to me—he wasn't much for talking, full stop—he’d just head straight for the shower. 

I was young—he died when I was twelve—so I didn’t think much of it at the time. Just Dad being Dad. Bit weird. Bit cooked. Part of the background noise of childhood. 

It wasn’t until I got older that I realised what that expression was. That pinched, hollowed-out look he wore as he left bloody footprints down the hallway. Fear. I’m not talking jump-scare fear. I’m talking bone-deep, soul-wrung, world-ending terror. 

So, after my little excursion, I started keeping tabs on myself. Nothing serious—just made a point of plugging my phone in before bed, setting the location tracker, that sort of thing. I also tried to remind myself that correlation doesn't equal causation or however the fuck that phrase goes. Just because I might’ve inherited this quirk from my dad, who ended up offing himself, didn’t necessarily mean I was destined to go off and off myself too. 

But then it happened again.   
   
A few times, actually. 

The next time, I woke up in the middle of a freeway about thirty kilometres west of the city. Headlights flashing past either side of me. Four AM. Wearing mismatched shoes and my cousin's university hoodie, which I hadn’t seen since we moved in together. No memory. Not a whisper. Just the sick certainty that I’d walked there. On foot. No phone, again. Only reason I got back was some tradie on his pre-dawn commute took pity on me. 

Then there was the time I woke up in someone’s backyard. Suburban, manicured, silent. A child’s swing set creaking gently in the breeze. It was still dark, but the porch light flicked on while I was getting my bearings and this middle-aged woman in a dressing gown stepped out, saw me, and dropped her cup of tea. Just shattered it on the concrete like something out of a movie. I mumbled something—no idea what—and legged it.  

Booked in with a sleep specialist, took a look at the prices, cancelled it. Upped my melatonin intake, worked out like crazy to make sure I was dog-tired every time my head hit that pillow. Sometimes it helped, most times it didn’t.  

One time—this would've been about three weeks ago now—I woke up in the hallway of my flat. I’d returned home, somehow. Front door wide open, cold air pooling on the tiles like something had just come in or gone out. My breath was visible. My feet were wet. 

It was 3:12 AM. 

I didn’t remember getting up. Didn’t remember unlocking anything. I did the usual: checked my hands, checked the soles of my feet. Looked for blood, mud, ink. Nothing. Just the weird, hollow headache I was starting to associate with these episodes. And the feeling. That pressing. Like I’d missed a step going down the stairs and my guts were still catching up. 

I staggered back to bed. Slept like shit. It wasn’t until this morning that I noticed the notification. Storage Almost Full. Which was weird, because I’m not a big photo guy, hate being in them. Checked my gallery. 

There are hundreds of videos. I’m talking hours of them. 

All recent.   
All filmed with the front-facing camera.   
All of me. 

Just walking. Long stretches of nothing—quiet suburban streets, grassy reserves, the shoulder of a dark highway. And there I am, in frame the whole time, my own face staring back at the camera like I’m vlogging some existential crisis I can’t be arsed to narrate. No talking. Barely blinking. Just walking , all alone, and filming myself. 

Sometimes there’s a glint in my eye—like recognition. Like I’m listening to something. At times, I smile.

And here’s the odd part. If you scrub through the footage slowly—frame by frame—you start to see things. Not often. But they’re there. 

A shadow moving behind me in a place where there’s no light. A reflection in a window that doesn’t match my movements.  

And once—just once—you can see a shape behind me. In the distance. Far back. Like a tall man. Or not a man. Wearing something like a coat, but not quite right. Too long. Too thin. Arms down at its sides like they’re waiting to be used. You scrub too fast, and it’s gone. 

About two weeks ago, I called Mum. 

We don’t really talk. Not because she’s a bad person—she’s not, exactly. Not a good one either. Just someone wired entirely different to me. Her brand of love is the tough kind. If there’s softness in her, it’s buried deep beneath decades of not having the time or permission to show it. 

Anyway, I recorded our call. I had a feeling I might need to refer back to it. What follows is the exact transcription. Word for word. 

Setting the scene: she’d just spent a solid ten minutes unloading about Annee (my sister) getting sacked from her hairdressing apprenticeship—*“too soft, too slow, never had the follow-through”*—and I finally steered the conversation where I needed it to go. 

>**Me:** Mum, I’m sorry but I gotta talk about about dad for a bit. 

>**Mum:** Why would you wanna do that?

>**Me:** I’m starting to sleepwalk. 

>*She went real quiet for a moment. Sorry, I’m editorialising.* 

>**Mum:** Jesus. 

>**Me:** I’m getting it checked out. 

>**Mum:** Yeah?  

>**Me:** Yeah. 

>**Mum:** Between you and your brother— 

>**Me:** Hang on, what? *‘S’* had this, too? 

>**Mum:** Of course. You don’t remember him walking into your room some nights? Scared the absolute shit outta you— 

>**Me**: I was too young to remember, I guess. 

>**Mum:** Well, he did. Him and your father, both. 

>**Me:** Anyone else? 

>**Mum:** <silence> 

>**Me:** Please, mum, anyone else? 

>**Mum:** <silence> 

>**Me:** Mum— 

>**Mum:** I don’t want you jumping to any conclusions. 

>**Me:** I’m not gonna, but did others have this? 

>**Mum:** <silence> 

>**Me:** Did Uncle Andrew sleepwalk? Did his sons—the dead ones, what’re their names—Brayden, William—did they sleepwalk, too? 

>**Mum:** Yes. 

>**Me:** Jesus. Jesus Christ. And you never connected the dots—? 

>**Mum:** Connected what, *‘R’?* What is there to fuckin’ connect, I mean *really*. That sickness runs through the veins of the men in this family? Everyone knows that. It’s a shit hand you’ve been dealt, pet, but you’ve got a good head on your shoulders and you’ve not been getting any bad thoughts? 

>**Me:** I don’t want to kill myself, if that’s what you mean. 

>**Mum:** There you go, already a step beyond the rest. 

>**Me:** What bad thoughts, though? Did dad, did *‘S’* ever say— 

>**Mum:** I don’t wanna talk about this, *R.* 

>**Me:** Well, mum, I do ‘cause I’m pretty fuckin’ scared— 

>**Mum:** Don’t use that fucking tone with me. I don’t want you going off and looking into this stupid shit like your brother did, because diseased minds will cling to whatever conspiracy they can find, R, and I’m done fuckin’ burying my boys— 

>**Me:** What stuff? Did you say *‘S’* was— 

She hung up on me after that. Texted me a couple minutes later that she loved me, but that I’d upset her, and she was going for a lie down.  

Weird, right? And she’s let trip that my brother, who killed himself in his early twenties when I was fourteen, had been looking into it. Which suggested there was *something* to look into. 

So, I spent the next few days tracking down my aunt, and the widows of my two deceased cousins. Mum apparently got to my aunt first, she was tight lipped and told me I’d only make myself more crook by filling my head with crazy ideas—but the widows were more forthcoming, perhaps without any of that generational loyalty to hold them back. 

The stories were almost identical. Same pattern. First came the sleepwalking. Then came the filming. Both Brayden and William had hours of footage—just like mine. Shaky, low-light videos of themselves wandering aimlessly through the night, flash on, eyes reduced to glowing white orbs devoid of pupils, mouths slack.  

Now, hereditary sleepwalking? Sure. I’ll bite. Maybe it runs in families. Some weird quirk in the brain. You could probably dig up a journal article or two, slap a name on it, call it benign. 

But the filming? What element of your DNA is supposed to teach you to *pick up a phone and point it at your own face while unconscious?* That’s not muscle memory. That’s not evolution. That’s something else. 

And there was another thing. 

Neither Brayden nor William ever left town. They lived at home until the end. So when they sleepwalked, they always ended up in the same place: the *Carbanak Resources Iron Mine.*  

Every single time. 

That stuck with me. Got me wondering. 

So I pulled up Google Maps and started plotting out my own movements—every time my phone had recorded a walk, every midnight stroll I didn’t remember. I marked them all, measured headings, compared directions, laid them one over the other. 

Every single path pointed the same way. Not close. Not approximately. Exactly. Same vector. Same bearing.

Draw a straight line across the continent along that heading and you know where it lands? 

Dead centre of the *Carbanak Iron Mine.* 

Thousands of kilometres away. 

And somehow, without ever having been there, without ever seeing the place properly in my life, I’ve been trying to walk there in my sleep. 

Tell me how the fuck that’s supposed to be genetic. 

I asked the widows if they remembered anything else—any other signs, any other oddities. They hesitated at first, like they weren’t sure what counted, or maybe they’d spent so long trying to forget that dredging it back up felt wrong. 

But then the memories started to surface. 

They both said the same thing: their husbands hated being photographed. Not just camera shy—*hated it.* Something about the act itself would set them off. Brayden once smacked the phone out of his wife’s hand at their daughter’s third birthday. She was trying to film him singing over the cake. One second, he was fine, the next he was snarling, eyes wide, like she’d just shone a torch in the face of something buried deep underground. The phone shattered on the tiles. The kid started crying. 

William, apparently, went even further. He smashed every phone in the house. Every single one. Said they were watching him. Wouldn’t say who “they” were. Refused to buy his wife—then a stay-at-home mother—a replacement.

But the part that really stuck with me—William’s daughter, a little older by then, told her mum one day that her Polaroid camera had gone missing. Few days later, William found it in his own wardrobe. Inside, in an old shoebox, were hundreds of Polaroids. Hundreds. Crammed in like he was hoarding them. 

Almost all of them were photos of William. 

Unflattering angles. Off-centre, held at arms length.

The widow said she asked him—had he taken them? Were they some kind of weird art project or surveillance thing? 

But William looked like he was about to throw up. Not angry, not embarrassed. Scared. She said he acted like someone had broken into their home and left a box of photos behind. Like he couldn’t remember a single one. Like they weren’t his at all. 

Brayden never found anything like that, but he did say something once—just once, in a moment of clarity his wife said didn’t happen often by the end. They were talking about his dad, and his granddad before him. Both gone, both suicides. And Brayden had this far-off look in his eyes when he muttered it. 

“He was the first, you know. My granddad. The first in our line to do it.” 

She asked if he meant suicide. Brayden had said yes. Then added: 

‘Shouldn’t have taken that photo. Took the equipment down special. First time any of them had ever seen a camera, you know, or whatever they called it back then.’ Then he repeated: 'Shouldn't have taken that photo.' 

Then she asked what he meant, he said: 

‘Of that thing. Deep in the mines.’ 

He never said more after that. It was the first and last time he ever brought it up. 

A week later, he was gone too. 

And of course—how had I not put it together sooner?

My dad hated having his picture taken, too. 

There was this one time—I must’ve been seven, maybe eight. Won a disposable camera in some end-of-term raffle at school. Came home waving it around like a trophy. Dad walked through the door and I—just being a little idiot revved up on adrenalin—called out “smile, dad!” and clicked the shutter. 

He punched me in the mouth. 

Split my lip clean open. Camera went flying, smashed to bits on the kitchen tiles. I didn’t even cry—just stared at him, stunned. And he grabbed me by the shoulders, eyes wild, and snarled right into my face: “Never take a fuckin’ photo of me. *Ever* again.” 

I’d buried that one. Deep. One of a hundred little unpleasantries I’d filed away under normal childhood bullshit. But it came roaring back as soon as the widows started talking. 

And there was another thing—worse, somehow, because it had been good before it turned bad. 

Flash forward a couple years later. Camcorders were becoming more common. I wanted one so badly. I begged for weeks. Dad was reluctant—shifty, even—but eventually, he caved. Bought one second-hand from a guy at work. 

That summer? That was maybe the happiest I remember him. Us. We took a road trip down south, just the two of us. Stayed in dodgy motels. Ate crap food. Filmed everything. Goofy little scenes. Me doing dumb voices. Him pretending to narrate like a documentary host. It was golden. He was golden.  

And then we got home. 

We sat down to watch the tapes. First one played fine. Second one, too. And then—somewhere in the third—he went completely still. 

I remember the way his jaw slackened. Like something in the footage had reached out and touched him. Like he’d seen a face in the static. 

Then he lost it. 

Smashed the TV. Ripped the camcorder out of the wall and hurled it across the room. Tore the tapes apart with his bare hands. I tried to stop him, tried to ask what was wrong, and he just kept muttering “no, no, no, no” like a prayer. Like maybe if he said it enough times, whatever he’d seen would un-happen. 

We never talked about it. Not once. He acted like the whole summer hadn’t even happened. Like the trip was just some weird dream we both shared and forgot at the same time. 

But I think about it now, and I wonder—what are videos, really? 

A million photographs. One after another. Frame by frame by frame. 

Look—I know how this sounds. 

I do. 

Maybe it’s just a genetic thing. A curse passed down in blood and synapses. Some cracked family line of sleepwalkers with delusions of grandeur. Maybe we’re just born sick, and the sickness makes us search for patterns that aren’t there. 

But I’ve been thinking about filming myself. Properly. Just sitting down, facing the lens, and letting it run through the night. No walking. No GPS. Just me, and the dark, and the eye of the camera. See if it catches anything. See if it sees me. 

Problem is—I’m scared. 

And not just regular scared. It’s something else. I don’t know how to explain it, but the more videos I take, the more photos I find on my phone in the mornings, the longer the blackouts seem to last. Like something’s reaching through them, pulling time out of me. And the strangest part is, every time I wake up, I feel this deep, aching pull to go home. 

So yeah. That’s why I’m posting here. 

If anyone’s heard of something like this—sleepwalking, recurring directional impulses, hereditary aversion to being seen on film—I’d really appreciate anything. Articles. Journals. Even just stories. I’ll take anything at this point. 

Because here’s the crazy part. The bit I haven’t told anyone yet: 

Lately, I’ve been thinking about going back. Back to Carbanak. Not just to visit. To work. I’ve looked into it. There are job listings. Open positions. Labour shortages. It wouldn’t be hard. 

And I know it sounds insane—I know—but something about it feels *right*. There's this pull, navel-deep, and getting stronger every day.

Common sense tells me it's just my mining roots flaring up after a long haitus, my blood wanting to follow family tradition.

Only a little part of me is worried it's not really *me* that wants to go back at all.",13,1745598802.0,nosleep,0,1.0,False

I've already got Melozio decaffeinated on my list but is there anything that's close to that flavour? Or that intensity as I'm not much a fan of strong coffee. Something that works well as a cappuccino or latte? And as it's getting to the warmer months, something that works in an iced latte.

I have not gotten close to even a drinkable cup of coffee yet and and feel like I am wasting money every time I brew a cup since these beans are not cheap. So I am thinking of picking up some cheaper coffee beans such as Cost co's house blend which is less than half the price of what I am currently using. I figure I should at least use this until I can learn more about how to brew good tasting pour over and switch back to the fancier stuff then. Interested to hear people's thoughts on this and if they think this is a good idea or might have any downsides?

1k7p8v6,https://www.reddit.com/r/CoffeeMakerReviews/comments/1k7p8v6/does_the_bodum_34oz_chambord_french_press_coffee/,Does the Bodum 34oz Chambord French Press Coffee Maker Truly Impress? Review,"The Bodum 1928-16US4 Chambord French Press Coffee Maker is a staple in my morning routine. From its polished stainless steel finish to the high-heat borosilicate glass, this French press signifies premium craftsmanship. Manufactured in Portugal and styled classically, it gives me little reason to reach for another brewing method. I’ve tested its performance daily, and while I find it generally satisfying, there are noteworthy aspects worth mentioning.

**Design and Build Quality**

This coffee maker is an absolute beauty. Its chrome-plated steel frame feels sturdy but lightweight enough to move around comfortably. The borosilicate glass carafe not only insulates heat effectively but resists cracking, even after several accidental taps against my sink. The matte-black polypropylene handle is perfectly contoured, providing an ergonomic grip that doesn’t get too hot when pouring. However, since the glass is exposed, you’ll want to handle it with care—it feels durable, but you don’t want to test its limits unnecessarily.

**Ease of Use**

How simple can brewing coffee get? With this manual French press, it just takes coarse ground coffee and hot water to produce a rich, flavorful cup. Over the weeks, I’ve experimented with different grind sizes—always aiming for coarse—and water temperatures ranging between 92 and 96 degrees Celsius. The process is fuss-free, although timing is key. A four-minute steep time seems to hit the sweet spot for unlocking bold flavors without over-extracting. Cleanup is also surprisingly quick; the glass carafe and reusable mesh filter are easy to rinse off, although I sometimes wish the carafe felt less delicate during washing.

**[Check Bodum 1928-16US4 price on Amazon.](https://tastefulcoffee.com/p/b00008xewg/)**

**Performance and Coffee Flavor**

What sets this French press apart is its ability to bring out nuanced flavors in freshly ground coffee. Compared to drip machines, this coffee maker provides a thicker, richer mouthfeel. Coffee aficionados will appreciate the natural coffee oils that remain intact—no pesky paper filters to absorb them. While testing, I brewed standard hot coffee, and on warmer days, I ventured into iced coffee territory. Both methods yielded incredible results, though finer grinds (accidentally used once) caused some sediment to sneak into my mug—a minor hiccup from improper preparation on my part.

**Perks**

- Timeless and elegant design complements any kitchen.
- Durable borosilicate glass resists temperature changes and cracking.
- Reusable filter reduces waste and keeps environmental impact low.
- Easy-to-clean components for hassle-free maintenance.

**Negative Attributes**

- Sediment can accumulate in your brew if grind size isn't perfect.
- Glass carafe, while durable, still requires cautious handling during cleaning.
- Dripping might occur if not poured at the right angle.

**Capacity and Suitability**

Holding 34 ounces, this unit brews enough coffee for roughly eight small cups or four full-sized mugs. Sharing coffee with friends or family has been delightful, as everyone gets their fill without needing multiple brewing cycles. It’s portable too—I took it along on a road trip, and its manual operation meant no dependency on electricity. Fellow coffee enthusiasts who prefer simplicity and hands-on brewing will find this product ideal. On the downside, if you’re someone who finds manual brewing cumbersome, this might not be your cup of... well, coffee.

**Competing Products**

While Bodum’s French press offers undeniable charm, similar models like the Frieling Stainless Steel French Press and Espro P7 deserve a mention. Frieling boasts an all-metal construction, offering unmatched durability, although it sacrifices the visual appeal of Bodum’s glass carafe. Espro’s model promises a double micro-filter system, reducing sediment significantly—but for double the price. Those on a budget may look at SterlingPro or KONA French Press, but they lack Bodum’s polished aesthetic and long-established reputation.

**Cost Efficiency**

For its premium craftsmanship and consistent brew quality, this French press stands out as a cost-effective option. Sure, it’s not dirt-cheap, but its longevity and ease of use justify the investment over disposable alternatives. After all, why spend on coffee shop lattes when you can perfect your brew at home, right? Compared to its competitors, Bodum hits a sweet spot in offering a high-quality product at a reasonable price range.

No, you're NOT a nurse ✨️bestie✨️. Here's my take on how you were in the PICU, as I worked alongside you. One word, narcissistic.

I would float over to the PICU, and you were lazy AF and dangerous. Would always have other nurses watch your patients along with their own patient assignment, while you would do photos in the hallways and patients' rooms. You would also do photos and vlogs in the med room, patient rooms, hallways, break room, etc. Also, Sid was there daily bringing you food or coffee, and they let him into the locked unit any time he showed up when he had no police business to be there in the first place. A father of a patient recognized you from OF & demanded that you not be their kids nurse. During Covid, Sid was let in, while patients' parents weren't allowed in to see their very sick kids. I can go on and on. It was insane! They kept you there way too long, and you should have been long gone much, much sooner. You are what puts our profession in a dark light and being untrustworthy.

1k7p6wm,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1k7p6wm,Logan Paul's text messages regarding suing CoffeeZilla,"These screenshots come from CoffeeZilla’s Motion to Transfer and Stay proceedings, filed on April 15th and able to be found on [Court Listener](https://www.courtlistener.com/docket/68891856/paul-v-findeisen/). I screenshotted these directly from the filing, then edited the image sharpness and contrast to make the text a bit more legible. [I became aware of these messages due to this 20 minute video by “lawtuber” and licensed lawyer LegalBytes who summarizes this motion and provides her input, and I highly recommend giving the video a watch.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9MGrD7yxBNo&pp=ygULbGVnYWwgYnl0ZXM%3D)

The first 5 minutes of the video discuss the background of the case. **Notably Logan Paul is NOT suing CoffeeZilla for the original three part exposéthat CoffeeZilla did,** possibly because the statue of limitations elapsed. Instead Logan Paul is suing for CoffeeZilla’s later discussion that Logan Paul was not paying back the people allegedly scammed by Crypto Zoo, and discussion that the payback plan which eventually emerged was shady and incomplete. In these discussions CoffeeZilla referred to Logan Paul as a scammer, and Logan Paul is saying that CoffeeZilla had group texts showing that Logan Paul was not a scammer, and these messages instead indicate that Paul was oblivious to the scam running under his nose. In other words Logan Paul is claiming he was incompetent by hiring a bunch of crypto scammers who then used his project to pull off a crypto scam, but Paul is claiming that he himself is not a scammer and apparently will sue you if you make such a claim. If this post gets any traction I guarantee you somebody is going to comment blindly thinking this lawsuit is with regards to the original three part exposé.

I think the next most notable part of the motion is where CoffeeZilla paints a picture that Logan Paul is using this lawsuit to inappropriately get access to discovery information in the class action suit against him for CryptoZoo. LegalBytes at 08:50 in the video provides excerpts of filings made by Logan Paul (and used as evidence by CoffeeZilla in their motion) which indicate that this is the case. This further includes Logan Paul trying (and failing) to get access to text messages between CoffeeZilla and the lawyer who is leading the class action lawsuit against CryptoZoo, Tom Kherkher (or “Attorney Tom” as he is known on YouTube).

Lastly LegalBytes discusses these text messages at 13:00 in the video, how they fit into CoffeeZilla's motion to dismiss the defamation lawsuit against him, and closes out with her thoughts on how she thinks a jury would react to Logan Paul if these messages are put before them.",239,1745598431.0,youtubedrama,44,0.99,False
1k7p6pj,https://www.reddit.com/r/ADHD/comments/1k7p6pj/extreme_boredom_fatigue_highway_driving/,Extreme boredom fatigue highway driving,"My most dangerous symptom is this extreme boredom fatigue that suddenly hits me on long highway drives. It happens when there is a long straight section, same speed, same scenery, and it hypnotizes me into this state of extreme fatigue where I can feel my eyes getting heavy. 

I will realize this is happening and feel a fear that I might die from falling asleep here. I will want to pull over at the nearest stop to have coffee, run circles around my car, etc. to get out of this state. I know it is not actually fatigue from lack of sleep because once I hit the city (or anywhere where it is more stimulating to drive), I'm suddenly awake.

But sometimes it is quite far before I can pull over. So I will blast music, have food, drink water, sing, talk to myself, and I have even pinched my leg very hard so that the pain can keep me awake.

I drive a manual to keep me engaged. I try to avoid these drives by getting a ride from someone else when possible. I try to plan while my medication is active, which helps immensely. 


But sometimes, there are still situations where I am on one of these drives, the meds are wearing off, and I can't pull over in that moment.


What else can I do to keep myself awake, in that very moment? In those moments that I can't pull over and wasn't able to avoid the situation. Are there any mental, mindfulness type strategies? Ways to move my body while driving?

Scratching it became second nature to me. 

It was this hot, prickling sensation that drove me insane enough to scratch and scratch and *scratch*, until beads of red bloomed. 

I made coffee, knowing which hand to use, pouring coffee and creamer, so I could claw at my other hand. 

I tried everything for it. 

Over-the-counter ointment seemed to do the trick, but it was a temporary fix. 

The itch started to creep down my arm, stretching to my shoulder and neck, and then my face. 

I was scratching my hand, clawing at the flesh, panting, tears in my eyes, when the first pustule appeared, red, raw, and ugly. 

I smothered it with ointment, but it was already too big, a giant head sticking out of my palm. 

I scratched it again, my breath hitching, and the thing broke through, a human head erupting through my skin. Alex. 

I recognized his thick brown hair and glasses. I picked him out of the scab, my hands trembling, and squashed him between my thumb and index finger.

I applied more ointment, this time squeezing half of the tube onto my hand. 

But he just came back, three days later, this time right across my skin and down my arm. 

I picked each one of him out, my breathing labored. 

I started wearing gloves, but then he was appearing on my arms and legs, my stomach, even my face.

After painfully plucking every single Alex from my skin, I forced myself to go see a doctor. 

I showed the doctor my rash, every grisly pustule sticking from my flesh. 

I showed him my disgusting face, filled with him. He was *everywhere*. 

No matter how many times I picked him out, he grew back, bigger. I broke apart in front of my doctor, prodding my skin. 

“Please,” I whispered. “Can you get rid of it?”

The doctor’s lip curled. 

“Falyn, you know that's against the law.” He grabbed my hand and smiled. 

“It's beautiful and natural, and yours, sweetheart. You're going to be great.”

I plucked another squirming Alex from my arm. 

This one was *screaming*. 

“But I didn't even—”

“You know the law,” the doctor spoke under his breath. 

“Even if I *wanted* to help you, you know I… can't.” His eyes found mine, deeply empathetic and *sorry*. 

I left him doubled over in his chair, shoulders shuddering, masking sobs with coughing. 

I went home, my skin crawling. 

I grabbed a knife and stabbed each and every Alex growing out of me, until I was panting, heaving for breath, lying in a pooling warmth seeping under me.

“Falyn.”

Mom was screaming when she found me, barely conscious.

But I was smiling, my vision blurring, watching a headless Alex run down my leg.

Mom grabbed me, cradling me, her sobs echoing.

But for the first time since I found out I was pregnant one month ago, I was smiling.

I was free.

1k7oxjv,https://www.reddit.com/r/WashingMachineReviews/comments/1k7oxjv/how_does_the_super_deal_compact_mini_washer/,How does the SUPER DEAL Compact Mini Washer perform? Detailed review inside!,"The SUPER DEAL SD2304 Compact Mini Twin Tub Washing Machine entered my life as a potential laundry savior, and having used it consistently for the last few weeks, I have plenty to say about how it performs. The promise of a compact, portable washer for small spaces intrigued me right away, so I decided to put it to the test in my apartment. It's marketed as ideal for dorms, RVs, and even camping, but I primarily needed something that wouldn’t dominate half my bathroom while also lightening my weekly laundry load.

**Functional Design for Small Spaces**  
The twin tub design is, without question, one of the standout aspects. This washer is incredibly compact, measuring just 13.5"" D x 23"" W x 26"" H, and it conveniently fits into a corner of my bathroom. The plastic build kept it lightweight, only weighing 26.5 pounds, which made it super easy to move around when needed. However, I will admit the plastic material doesn’t exactly scream durability. That said, it hasn’t shown any signs of wear and tear yet, so fingers crossed. There’s also a tube for drainage—practical, though it feels a bit flimsy at 0.91 inches in diameter.

**Ease of Use & Initial Observations**  
The controls are as simple as they come. With rotary knobs for wash and spin timers, the straightforward approach might charm those who are not fans of overly complicated digital interfaces. I initially laughed a bit at the ""just sip your coffee and wait"" line in the user manual, but honestly, this thing makes laundry ridiculously chill. Clothes go in, water fills up, set a timer, and you're golden. Although I did find the translucent tub container window amusing because watching my laundry dance around became my accidental new hobby.

**Grab your SUPER DEAL SD2304 today—[check price on Amazon](https://mobilewasher.com/p/b07b94zr74/).**

**Performance and Cleaning Power**  
The machine delivers surprisingly well for its size. Equipped with a 1300 RPM motor and a water-efficient design, it handles delicate items like t-shirts and undergarments perfectly while also holding its own with heavier items like jeans. The washer can handle up to 8 pounds at once, while the spin dryer is limited to 5 pounds. This split capacity occasionally annoyed me since I had to break up batches when doing a heavier load. But what pleasantly surprised me was the cleaning power—my clothes consistently came out looking and smelling fresh. The new water flow technology also seemed to minimize tangling or twisting of fabrics, which was a game-changer for me. 

**Advantages**  
- Compact and space-saving design, ideal for small apartments or dorms.  
- Twin Tub feature allows simultaneous washing and spinning.  
- 1300 RPM motor provides powerful cleaning performance.  
- Simple controls are hassle-free and beginner-friendly.  
- Energy-efficient with low power consumption.

**Caveats**  
- Plastic materials might feel too flimsy for some users.  
- Limited spin dryer capacity compared to the washer.  
- Drainage tube could be longer and sturdier for better usability.

**Competing Alternatives**  
If you’re weighing the options, the Panda PAN6320W is a comparable portable washer worth checking out. It offers a fully automatic experience, including water level selection and slightly better capacity at 10 pounds for washing. But it sacrifices the twin tub system for a single load cycle, so you lose the ability to simultaneously handle washing and spinning. The Giantex EP22930 is another rival, boasting an even more lightweight design but lacking the motor power provided by the SD2304, which I value for tougher laundry demands.

Compared to these, the SD2304 excels in compactness and dual tub convenience. However, it’s worth noting that alternatives like the Panda come across as more premium in terms of materials and overall aesthetics.

**Affordable Quality for its Features**  
In terms of value for money, the SUPER DEAL SD2304 punches above its weight. It might not be the most luxurious washer out there, but for small living spaces or niche needs like camping or life in an RV, it does what it says on the tin and does it well. Spending on this won’t burn a hole in your pocket, and the energy-efficient operation is a long-term plus.
