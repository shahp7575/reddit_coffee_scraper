I’m looking to meet someone that’ll eventually lead to something more serious. I’m okay with friends too! 

A little bit about myself; educated, work full time and full time mom to the best bernedoodle pup. I’m fat but working on it, I’m funny and sarcastic, I tend to take things lightly and go with the flow of things. Life’s too short to be so serious all the time. I’m fiercely loyal, I appreciate good communication, honesty, and women who are kind and considerate, and very confident in myself and the type of person I am. I’m basically not an asshole. Some of my favorite things to do is try new coffee shops (I’m a coffee snob), new restaurants too (Yelp snob too), look at nature stuff but not necessarily hike, taking long naps, catching up on Law and Order, and going to Disneyland as much as I can handle. 

Something’s I’m looking for; someone’s who’s not involved with their ex and hung up on them. Someone who’s a shit communicator. Looking for someone’s who’s a lesbian (could be bi too), AFAB, someone who’s in Los Angeles. That’s very important as I like to hang out weekly, see people, hear their voices and share food with them occasionally. If you’re not in LA, please don’t waste my time and please be 30+. Im too old to be dealing with twenty year olds. Must love dogs too because me and my dog come as a package deal! But yeah, if you’re in LA and just want to see where things go, hit me up!",1,1764015045.0,lesbianr4r,0,1.0,False

1p5rmjp,https://www.reddit.com/r/FriendshipAdvice/comments/1p5rmjp/hey_i_need_some_advice/,Hey I need some advice...,"So for context, I have a friend group. There's me and these two other girls, let's call them Grace and Zara. Zara and I have known each other since elementary school but we weren't close yet. As for Grace, it was somewhere in middle school. When attending high school, I was close to Grace the most because we had P.E and a drawing class. With Zara, we had a Spanish class together. Most of the time, the three of us hung out at lunch separately. Meaning I would have lunch with Zara and one with Grace each semester. And we had a good time, laughing, gossiping, telling jokes, things like that. By the time high school ended and I went to college, that's when I started to question my friendship with them. The first time we truly hung out as a group outside of high school was a couple months ago. We had a fucking blast. 

We talked and talked at a coffee shop and I felt genuinely happy. But as time passed by, we hadn't done any more hangouts. With a group chat we had, I would reach out to them, asking them how they're doing, if they want to hangout again and they would respond, saying that they're busy and all. Which I understand, but the thing is, neither of them seemed to reach out first though. Grace did reach out to me a few times individually, but Zara almost never. I honestly feel like I'm the one who makes the most effort in this group. I'm kind of like a special glue who holds everyone together. And looking back, it seems like I'm always the one who comes up with the hangouts. Heck, even our first true hangout was my idea. 

I saw Zara again cause we both go to the same college, and she was with two other girls who are her friends. And I couldn't help but feel left out. She seemed so happy because it was her birthday that day and I didn't want to ruin anything. As for Grace, I hardly see her because she has different classes than us. The last time I saw her was when she was going upstairs and I wanted to say hi to her. When I greeted her, she saw me and said hi and all. But I didn't even know why but somehow everything felt awkward between us. I tend to be energetic as I like to be funny. When I waved at her goodbye and left, I couldn't get rid of this feeling that maybe she wasn't as excited to see me as I was to her. 

I don't know what I did wrong. I don't know if both of them didn't like me as much as I do with them. If they didn't, they would have told me by now. I just don't know anymore and I hope someone can relate or give me advice on this :/",1,1764014870.0,FriendshipAdvice,0,0.99,False
1p5rmid,https://www.reddit.com/r/AICLIPART/comments/1p5rmid/china_just_dropped_a_quantum_photonic_ai_chip/,China just dropped a “quantum photonic AI chip” that’s “1000× faster than Nvidia” panic time or marketing magic?,"So apparently China just rolled out this **“quantum photonic AI chip”** that’s supposed to be **up to 1000× faster than Nvidia GPUs** on AI stuff.

On paper that sounds like:  RIP H100, it was nice knowing  reality… it’s probably not that dramatic.

[Quantum Photonic Ai Chip](https://preview.redd.it/atpd4f45h93g1.png?width=3072&format=png&auto=webp&s=20c4f0a5b9179aba2bbbca5767ab1a42f2267cb7)

* It’s not a Doctor Strange–level quantum computer, it’s more like a **super-niche photonic AI accelerator** that uses light instead of electrons.
* The **“1000× faster”** line is for **cherry-picked operations**, not “lol we erased Nvidia overnight”.
* **Next 1–2 years:** basically **no change** for global Nvidia GPU prices.
* Longer term: this kind of hardware *could* start chewing into Nvidia’s margins, especially in China, if it actually scales and doesn’t die as a lab toy.

Not financial advice, I just read too many chip articles instead of going outside.

# So what is this thing really?

From what I’ve been able to piece together:

* It’s a **photonic chip** built on thin-film lithium niobate (fancy material, very optics-people name).
* Instead of electrons running through transistors, you’ve got **photons** running through little optical circuits – waveguides, interferometers, phase shifters and friends.
* It’s meant for **AI / optimization tasks**: big matrix multiplications, certain combinatorial problems, specialized inference.

Marketing calls it *“quantum photonic”* because of course it does. But as far as anyone outside the lab can tell, it behaves more like a **very fast classical photonic processor** than a full quantum computer. No clear evidence of qubits, entanglement, all that jazz.

Still cool. Just… slightly less sci-fi than the headlines suggest.

# About that “1000× faster than Nvidia” quote

This is where the fine print quietly screams in the corner.

Those big numbers usually mean one of these:

* “We picked a very specific type of operation where our chip shines and benchmarked that.”
* “We’re talking **energy efficiency** (ops per joule), not ‘train your 600B LLM in a coffee break’.”
* “Vendor numbers, not independent ‘we threw it at a bunch of real models’ testing.”

So yeah, you can absolutely cook up a scenario where a photonic chip smokes a GPU by 1000×.  
That does **not** automatically mean it replaces every H100 cluster in an AI company tomorrow morning.

# Okay, but will this make Nvidia GPUs cheaper?

Let’s split it up a bit.

#  Short term (0–2 years): pretty much business as usual

Reasons this probably doesn’t nuke Nvidia pricing right now:

* These chips are mostly aimed at the **Chinese market**, not something you’ll spin up on AWS next week.
* The whole AI world is welded to **CUDA + Nvidia tooling**. Porting serious production workloads to some brand-new photonic platform is a big ask.
* Global demand for AI compute is still insane; people are basically hoarding H100s like it’s toilet paper in 2020.

So if you’re waiting for “China dropped a chip, 4090 now $300” – yeah, no.

#  Medium term (3–5 years): pressure inside China

Here it actually gets interesting:

* Because of US export controls, China *needs* domestic AI hardware that doesn’t rely on Nvidia.
* If these photonic / analog chips become **good enough for a chunk of AI workloads**, big Chinese companies can just build their stacks on top of that instead of begging for watered-down Nvidia parts.
* That means Nvidia’s **future growth in China** can be seriously capped, maybe even pushed out of entire segments.

Global prices probably stay mostly driven by demand in the US/EU and big cloud players, but the “China growth rocket” starts to look more like a nice-to-have than destiny.

#  Long term (5–10+ years): where things could get spicy

If photonics and other weird hardware (analog AI, neuromorphic stuff, etc.) actually mature:

* Data centers don’t care about brand loyalty; they care about **cost per useful operation** and **power bills**.
* You could easily imagine a setup where:
   * photonic chips do the brutal, dumb math (matrix ops, convolutions),
   * GPUs/CPUs orchestrate and handle the flexible logic parts.
* In that world, Nvidia can’t just say “we are AI, pay whatever we ask” forever. Margins get squeezed.

The thing is, Nvidia is not stupid:

* They’re already investing in optical interconnects, co-packaged optics and all that networking wizardry.
* If photonics starts looking truly dangerous, I’d bet on **Nvidia acquiring or building their own photonic units** rather than just watching someone else eat their lunch.

So long term, I don’t see “Nvidia goes to zero”, more like “Nvidia goes from ‘god-tier monopoly margins’ to ‘still rich, but has to actually fight for it’”.

# Why this still matters even if you don’t care about China vs Nvidia drama

For me, the story isn’t “this one chip kills Nvidia”. It’s:

* The AI hardware race is **no longer just GPUs in different colors**.
* We’re seeing **completely different computing paradigms** trying to crash the party.
* China is clearly building a parallel AI stack that does **not** rely on US chips or US export policy roulette.

Even ako you’re 100% bullish on NVDA, it’s hard to pretend this is irrelevant background noise.

# What do you think?

Genuinely curious where people land on this:

* Are photonic AI chips a **real long-term threat**, or just a cool niche accelerator for a few hyperspecialized workloads?
* If you’re in ML/infra: how painful would it be to integrate something like this if it really did give you, say, 50–100× better energy efficiency on matrix ops?
* And if you’re holding NVDA – is this “buy the dip, ignore the headlines” territory, or an early sign that the party won’t stay this wild forever?

Drop your hot takes, corrections, doom scenarios, insider anecdotes, all of it. I’m especially interested in comments from people who’ve actually played with photonics or non-GPU accelerators in production, not just read the same three articles as the rest of us.",1,1764014868.0,AICLIPART,0,1.0,False
1p5rm00,https://www.reddit.com/r/NovelLinks/comments/1p5rm00/anyone_know_where_to_find_a_link/,Anyone know where to find a link?,"For three days, I was in the hospital. For three days, my phone didn't make a sound. Not a single call from my family. And I didn't reach out, either. For the first time, I didn't find myself endlessly scrolling through their social media feeds, trying to piece together their lives from a distance.

　　I just rested. I’d lie in my hospital bed, or I’d drag my aching body down the hall for another test or to settle another bill.

　　Even on my discharge day, I didn't tell anyone. I just packed my few things, gritted my teeth against the throb in my abdomen, and took myself home.

　　The moment I pushed the front door open, the laughter in the living room cut off sharply.

　　Everyone was there. My fiancé, Micah, was sitting right next to Pearl, his arm slung casually over her shoulders. When he saw me, he quickly pulled it back and offered me an awkward smile. ""Soph, you're back? Where did you disappear to these past few days?""

　　My brother, Albi Bennett, let out a derisive snort. ""Where do you think? She just had to skip Pearl's graduation. She can't stand a single day where Vivi is the one in the spotlight.""

　　I didn't say a word. I just started walking toward my room.

　　My silence seemed to throw Albi off. Usually, an accusation like that would have me in tears, desperately pleading my case. But not this time.

　　My mom hurried over, holding a glass of juice. ""Hana, sweetie, we were just so swamped with Vivi's graduation party the other day, we missed your calls. Don't be upset, okay?"" She pressed a glass of cranberry juice into my hand.

　　A dull ache pulsed in my chest, even though I thought I was numb to it.

　　I'm allergic to cranberries. Pearl adores them. Because of that, our house was always stocked with anything cranberry-flavored. No matter how many times I'd mentioned my allergy, no one ever seemed to remember.

　　I handed the glass back to her and took a small step back. ""I'm not mad. I'm just going to my room.""

　　As I turned, a loud crash erupted from the living room.

　　My dad had shot to his feet, slamming his hand on the coffee table. ""What is with that sour face since you walked in?"" he screamed. ""Your mother apologized and even brought you your favorite drink! What more do you want? Looks like we've spoiled you rotten!""

　　My heart twisted so hard it hurt to breathe. Tears welled in my eyes, but I reached out, took the glass from my mom's hand, and drank the entire thing in a few desperate gulps.

　　I set the empty glass down gently and wiped my tears away. I looked my dad squarely in the eye, my voice eerily calm. ""Pearl is the one who likes cranberry juice. I'm allergic to it. But it's fine. I drank it all. May I please go to my room now?""

　　""Hana! Why didn't you say something if you're allergic? Who told you to drink it! You're so stubborn!"" Mom fretted, patting my back nervously.

　　Dad looked momentarily ashamed, but it quickly hardened back into anger. ""You could have just said something! You've always had this unlikable attitude. Nothing like Vivi. She knows how to talk to people properly.""

　　Pearl's sweet voice floated from the couch. ""Dad, please don't talk to Hana like that. You'll upset her."" She sounded so gentle, but the smug triumph in her eyes was unmistakable.

　　Pearl had always used my quiet nature to shine brighter. She lived for these comparisons, only truly satisfied when she saw me crushed beneath her heel.

　　I should have felt hurt. I should have been raging. But all I felt was a hollow, endless numbness. Even this public humiliation couldn't stir a single emotion.

　　""I'm sorry,"" I said, my voice flat. ""It won't happen again.""

　　The moment the words left my mouth, a stunned silence fell over the room. Everyone just stared.

　　My obedience left everyone momentarily stunned. After a heavy pause, my dad was the first to speak, his voice slightly less gruff. ""Good. That's the right attitude. We're family. Everything we do is for your own good.""

　　""I know,"" I replied, the words automatic, a numb smile fixed on my face.

　　Seeing I wasn't going to cause trouble, the tension in the room eased. They turned their attention back to Pearl, and the muted chatter from the living room resumed.

　　I took a quiet breath and moved toward the staircase.

　　But as my foot touched the bottom step, a hand closed around my wrist.

　　Micah had slipped up beside me unnoticed. He leaned in, his voice a low whisper. ""You're really not upset?""

　　That faux-gentle tone made my eyes sting all over again. A wave of bitter hurt rose in my chest, but I could only shake my head, my throat too tight to form words.

　　He looked visibly relieved. ""I knew you'd be understanding. You've never been one to make a scene."" He paused, glancing away uncomfortably. ""Look, there's something I wanted to talk about…""

　　 He avoided my eyes. ""We need to postpone the wedding next week.

　　 I promised your sister a long time ago I'd take her to see the Northern Lights at Aurora Bay after her graduation.

　　 Now that the ceremony's over, she won't stop asking me to keep my word. I thought—why not make it a family trip?

　　 The invitations haven't gone out yet. It's just a date; pushing it back a few weeks doesn't change anything,"" he said, a faint, fond smile touching his lips at the mention of her.

　　My heart froze solid. The tears I'd almost shed moments ago now felt like a pathetic joke.

　　 After 999 times of being cast aside, how could a part of me still hope for anything else?

　　When I didn't respond, Micah grew impatient, running a hand through his hair. ""Come on, Soph. Pearl's never been abroad.

　　 This is a huge deal for her. As her family, we should be there. And you've never seen the Aurora either. Think of it as an early honeymoon.""

　　""Sure,"" I said.

　　He blinked, taken aback. ""What did you say?""

　　I let out a slow, measured breath. ""I said, I agree to cancel the wedding.""

　　""Cancel? Who said anything about canceling? I said postpone. We're not canceling the wedding,"" he corrected, a deep frown forming on his face.

　　I lowered my head. A bitter, hollow smile tugged at my lips. Was there really a difference?

　　 As long as Pearl was around, she would never let this wedding happen. She coveted everything I had.

　　 I'd known this since we were children. It was a fight I could never win.

　　 My family's blind favoritism was her ultimate weapon, and now, my own fiancé had fully joined her ranks.

　　My eyes began to burn, and a familiar, crawling itch spread across my skin. The cranberry juice was finally taking effect.

　　I gave a slight nod and turned to go upstairs. I needed the allergy medication in my room before the reaction got worse.

　　""Are you mad that I'm going to Aurora Bay with Micah?"" Pearl's voice came from behind me, dripping with false innocence.

　　I ignored her and kept walking. This was her classic tactic. Even if I did nothing, a single, well-timed pout from her would rally the entire family to her side.

　　Albi was the first to erupt. ""Hey! Soph! Are you deaf? Vivi is talking to you! First you claim you're not angry, now you're giving everyone the silent treatment. Is that any way to act?""

　　I didn't answer. I was so accustomed to these baseless accusations; my entire life had been filled with them. I had learned to face them with a void of emotion.

　　But just as my foot landed on the second-floor landing, a stinging, sharp impact exploded across my cheek. My head snapped to the side.",1,1764014835.0,NovelLinks,0,1.0,False

1p5rita,https://www.reddit.com/r/NextLevelIncome/comments/1p5rita/i_tried_making_money_online_so_you_dont_have_to/,I Tried Making Money Online So You Don't Have To (Here’s What Actually Worked in 2026),"Let’s be real. Your feed is probably a graveyard of dead ""get rich quick"" dreams.



“Earn $10,000 a month with one weird trick!”

“I made six figures while sleeping on a beach!”



Yeah, I clicked those too. And for years, my online ""hustle"" looked like this: a messy notes app full of abandoned ideas, three followers on a niche TikTok account, and a profound sense that I was missing a secret everyone else knew.



Then, in late 2024, I got fed up. I decided to treat ""making money online"" not as a lottery ticket, but as a real, messy, personal experiment. I stopped listening to the gurus and started listening to my own gut. And somehow, in this noisy, AI-saturated world of 2026, I found a rhythm that actually works.



It’s not what you think. It’s weirder, more human, and honestly, more fun.



Here’s the map of my journey, complete with the potholes and the scenic overlooks.



The Big Shift: Trading ""Hustle"" for ""Human-Scale Work""

The first thing I had to murder was the idea of virality. Chasing algorithms is like chasing a ghost. It’s exhausting and you always end up empty-handed.



My ""aha"" moment came when I realized the internet in 2026 isn't about going viral; it's about finding your corner. It’s not a stadium concert; it’s a cozy, well-lit coffee shop where the right people gather because they love the same specific, weird things you do.



My corner? I’m obsessed with two things: vintage sci-fi book cover art and sustainable tiny homes. A weird combo, I know. But it’s my weird combo.



My 2026 Toolkit: The ""Unsexy"" Trio That Pays My Bills

I tried everything. These are the three pillars that didn't just bring in cash; they built a system that feels sustainable.



1. The Digital Quarterback: Your AI Co-Pilot



Notice I said co-pilot, not autopilot. In 2026, pretending you don't use AI is like pretending you don't use Google. The key is to use it to amplify your voice, not replace it.



My Personal Workflow: I use \[Claude 4\] to brain-dump my messy, emotional thoughts about, say, the use of neon in 1980s paperback art. It helps me structure those rambles into a coherent article outline. Then, I write every single word myself, pouring my personality back into that skeleton. The AI handled the boring scaffolding; I built the home.



The Result: I write faster, with more clarity, and without the soul-crushing dread of a blank page. It cut my research and outlining time by 70%. This was the game-changer that gave me the time to do the real work.



2. The ""Warm List"": Not Another Newsletter You'll Ignore



I know, I know. ""Build an email list."" It’s the oldest advice in the book. But in 2026, your email list isn't a ""list""—it's your living room.



I don't have a ""lead magnet."" I have a ""Friday Weirdness"" email. Every Friday, I send a short, personal note. Sometimes it's a cool book cover I found at a thrift store. Sometimes it's a rant about why a particular tiny home design is genius. It’s just me, talking to a few hundred people who get it.



How It Makes Money: I don’t blast them with offers. But when I created a small, beautiful PDF guide on ""How to Identify 5 Classic Sci-Fi Art Styles,"" I mentioned it in my newsletter. I sold 87 copies in 48 hours. Not a tsunami of cash, but a steady, warm drizzle of validation from people who trust me.



3. The ""Micro-Consulting"" Niche: Selling Your Eyeballs



This is my secret weapon. As I built my tiny corner of the internet, I became an expert in my weird little niche. And in 2026, expertise is currency.



People don't just want information; they want your perspective. I offer ""One-Off Brain-Picking Sessions.""



For a flat fee, someone can book a 60-minute video call with me to pick my brain. I’ve had:



An aspiring blogger who wanted to know how to find their ""weird niche.""



A designer who wanted my opinion on their tiny home layout.



A college student writing a thesis on pulp art who needed specific resource recommendations.



It’s not a draining, ongoing coaching program. It’s a single, powerful, high-value conversation. And because it’s focused and finite, I can charge a rate that respects my time and my very specific knowledge.



The Real Talk: What No One Tells You About the Grind

This isn’t a fairy tale. The money didn’t roll in overnight. For the first six months, I made maybe $100. Total. I had weeks where my only subscriber was my mom (hi, Mom!).



The difference this time? I was obsessed with the process, not the outcome. I was geeking out over art and design anyway; I just decided to do it in public. The money became a happy byproduct of my curiosity, not the lonely goal at the end of a bleak tunnel.



Your 2026 Starting Line (No, Really)

If you're feeling that familiar itch to try this, here’s my prescription. Don't quit your job. Don't buy a course.



Find Your ""Cozy Coffee Shop"" Niche: What could you talk about for an hour, with no preparation, to a friend? It doesn't have to be ""monetizable."" It just has to be yours.



Claim Your Corner: Start a stupid-simple blog on \[Ghost.org\] or a dedicated Instagram account. Just claim the space. Post once a week about your thing.



Talk to One Person: Write and design as if you're explaining it to one interested friend. Not an audience. One person. This kills the pressure and makes your voice authentic.



The future of making money online isn't about outsmarting algorithms. It's about being a specific, helpful, and deeply human person in a specific, small part of the internet.

Now, if you'll excuse me, I have a call with someone who wants to discuss the profound impact of airbrush art on 70s dystopian novels. And I cannot wait.

1p5rhw1,https://www.reddit.com/r/MarkNarrations/comments/1p5rhw1/aita_for_wanting_to_attend_my_sisters_vowel/,AITA for wanting to attend my sister's vowel renewal after she's kept me from my family for three years?,"Hi, this is a throwaway account for obvious reasons because I'll rather not have anyone from my main account report back to my sister. 

I'm currently shaking as I'm writing this, realizing that after all these years, my family is still trying to make the the scapegoat for something I had no control over. My therapist told me it was healthy to write down my emotions and I have no where else to go and I've watched Charlotte for years now. So I thought y'all might be able to help me and see my side of this fucked up situation. 

I'm(41m)  have been estranged from my family for above three years now because of my younger sister ""Emma"" (32F). She's always been the golden child, and now now shes using one mistake a made three years ago to turn everyone against me permanently and prevent my daughter from attending her wedding.

For a bit of background, I'm whats known as the glass child in the family. It was Emma who was the miracle baby, the one that came after my mother had difficulty conceiving. Our mother had always wanted a big family but due to medical problems she couldn't, our parents thought it would just be me but Emma came along. She was the precious one, the favorite. The one mom would defend against anything that hurt poor Emma's feelings. She could do no wrong. She was ""creative"" and ""free-spirited"" while I was ""too serious"" and ""too focused on achievements.""

It didn't matter that I would get straight eyes, Emma's Bs were praised and celebrated. It didn't matter that I got valedictorian and graduated with honors, Emma volunteer had food banks, isn't she just a siant? When I got into a top university, my parents said ""that's nice"" and helped Emma with her art portfolio. I'm going to admit, growing up I did resent her a little bit. We did fight, I said and did things I regret but it was only natural being sisters. Yet Emma would blow them out of proportion. She blamed me for trigger a food allergy I didn't know about, no one had believe me. I had just wanted to share my lunch with her, wanting to apologies for breaking her Barbie doll and apparently she was allergic to peanut butter. My phone was taken away and I was grounded, our parent called the school to seperate me and Emma as if I was the problem. I stopped trying to interact with her after that, but even that was twisted in me being vindictive and hurtful towards Emma

I worked SO HARD for any scrap of their attention while Emma just had to exist.  And when I did try, I was always painted as the Jealous sister. 


Fast forward and I started dating, but somehow my boyfriends were never good enough. Too boring, too ambitious, not family-oriented enough. I would get together with someone and ther would be something lacking, my parents didn't approve of my boyfriend each other like the didn't approve of most of the things I did. 

Meanwhile, Emma's relationships were always ""so sweet"" and ""so genuine."" Her boyfriend were always welcomed, while mine would be left out. It got to a point where my relationships would end simply because my significant others felt left out. 


Then Emma met ""James"" (34M). Sweet perfect James. He worked at the same hospital as her and would attend the gathering we(we shared some friends) would attend. It was clear that she liked him, she wasn't secretive about it, but Jamese didn't seem into her in my opinion. There was a connection between us, I could tell. He always talked to me, would smile and make me feel included. Even stood up for me when Emma's friends (the ones that didn't like me) would make snide comments about me being rude to Emma when I wasn't. Emma of course would back him up because she wanted him, but James wanted me. 

He was exactly the kind of man I'd always wanted - intelligent, stable, ambitious. I could see a future with him, could see a life. 

But of course, Emma got him. She always got everything. James asked her out and she, of course said yes. I had to pretend to be happy even though I was dying inside. 

They got engaged after a year. Married a year later. I was the maid of honor even though Emma has closer friends - but she wanted to ""include"" me. That's very Emma, every kind, very thoughtful. Even though she knew I liked him, that he was mine first. Making gestures that make HER look good.

I tried to be happy for her. I really did. But watching them together hurt. James was kind to me, treated me like a real person, asked about my work. Emma never bothered to understand my career, but James did. I wanted to put distance, having feeling for a married man is like a number one rule to not have, but I was so lonely. He was my only friend. Emma invited me over all the time and I took the opportunity to interact with James. Not in that way, but we did grow close. 

Here's where everyone thinks I'm the villain, but I swear I'm not.

Three years ago, I was going through the worst breakup of my life. My boyfriend of two years had cheated on me with his coworker. Emma was pregnant - naturally, everyone was obsessed with HER news - and I was falling apart. James was the only one who noticed. We started having coffee, just talking. He understood me in a way no one else did. He comforted me between caring for Emma, became my only life raft when the rest of my family was focusing on her. My feelings may have grown and Yeha I latched onto it, hard. Emma noticed of course but she didn't say anything, because nothing was happening. 

One night after a family dinner at my place, everyone left but James and I stayed to clean up. We were talking, laughing, and then... it happened. I'm not going to give details, but it was mutual. It was MUTUAL. He wanted it as much as I did. The alcohol was just a catalyst. Yeah he was a little drunk(hes a lightweight) but so was I, I didn't do anything he didn't want to and he didn't tell me no. He could have pushed me off he actually wasn't interested. 


Afterward, James panicked. He started saying he ""didn't know what happened"" and that he ""wasn't thinking clearly.""  And that he apparently had ""No Idea"" about what happened. It broke my heart. He regretted me. Regretted what we did, and tried to place them blame entirely on me. I kept trying to tell him that no one had to know,tbat I knew how he felt but he called me crazy, said I drugged him, said that I was lying.

Typical - even when I finally get something I want, it gets taken away.

James told Emma immediately. Of course he did. And Emma, perfect Emma, made it sound like I had attacked him or something. She twisted it into this narrative where I ""took advantage"" of him, which is insane. He's a grown man who made a choice. He had full control over himself, but I was painted as someone who took advantage of a grown ass man who could make a choice for himself. It wasn't SA but she pushed the narrative.

 I distance myself after that due to the drama. But two months later, I found out I was pregnant. I was terrified. My family already hated me. Emma had turned everyone against me, playing the victim, telling everyone who knew us about my ""unforgivable Crime"". I knew if I told her privately, she'd pressure me to terminate or she'd find a way to make it about HER pain. To twist my baby into something I did on purpose. So yes, I announced it at her baby shower. I know how it looks, but I was desperate. I thought if I said it in front of everyone, they'd HAVE to support me. I was pregnant and alone. Where was my shower? My support? I didn't plan on it being at the baby shower, everyone just happened to be there when I showed up. 

Emma made a huge scene - crying, hyperventilating, being over dramatic. She was seven months pregnant, perfectly healthy, but she acted like I'd shot her or something. An ambulance came. An AMBULANCE for gods sake. Everyone blamed ME for her ""trauma.""
The family exploded. My parents called me horrible names. Emma's friends threatened me online, this whole hate campaign. James's family talked about restraining orders. All because I was pregnant and scared and needed help.

My family stopped contacting me, I was blocked. No one even showed up for my daughters baby shower or birth. Not even James(he stayed with Emma because of course she could forgive him but not me). I have a daughter, ""Sophie"" (3F). James is a good father but he only talks about Sophie and barely had time for her. He only picks her up when it's his time and Emma never once came to ask how I was doing. 

She had her baby, ""Luke,"" and apparently she's living her best life. Great job, new house, and now shes renewing her bowls with James again.She gets EVERYTHING.  Flaunting it in my face on Facebook, James hasn't said anything about it bit I can tell they're all talking about me behind my back. About how this vow renewal would be some sort of fresh start for them. 


My parents send cards to Sophie but won't see me. I'm completely cut off. My daughter asks why I can't go visit grandma and grandpa. What am I supposed to tell her? ""Your aunt has convinced everyone your mommy is a monster?"" I'm not cruel, I want her to have a connection with her family, but it's frustrating when they pretend I don't exist. 

Emma's vowel renewal is three months. I'm not invited. My own sister's vowel renewal, and I'm banned. I sent her an email pouring my heart out. I told her how sorry I was for announcing my pregnancy at her shower (even though I had no choice and was drowning and needed my family). I told her I wanted to reconcile for Sophie's sake, for our family. I asked - BEGGED - to come to the event. I said I'd sit in the back, I wouldn't cause problems. That three years was enough, that I'd payed for whatever crime I had committed. 

Her response? 

""You SA my husband and ruined my life. The answer is no.""
SAd. She's actually using that word. About a consensual encounter between two adults. This is how far Emma will go to play the victim. She's rewriting history to make herself the martyr.

I'm being erased from my family because Emma can't handle that for ONCE in her life, she didn't get to keep everything perfect. She got the sympathy of the public eye, the supportive family, James still chose her, everything. And I get nothing. I'm the villain in her story.


AITA for thinking I deserve to be at my sister's vowel renewal? For wanting my daughter to see her mother be accepted into the family? For wanting to put a minor mistake that was blown up and heal? 

I'm seriously considering showing up anyway. Not to cause drama - just to show Emma that I'm still her sister and she can't erase me. I deserve to be there. This is family. Everyone acts like I'm supposed to just accept being cast out forever. But I'm a person too. I have feelings. I made one mistake - ONE - and Emma gets to punish me for life? Tell me honestly - am I wrong for wanting what Emma's always had? Basic family acceptance? Am I truly the problem? ",0,1764014588.0,MarkNarrations,0,0.5,False

1p5rhee,https://www.reddit.com/r/CasualConversation/comments/1p5rhee/i_started_earning_money_when_i_was_10_this_was_my/,I started earning money when I was 10. This was my first summer job in 1997.,"When I was 10 years old, I started earning my own money.

My first summer job was waking up at 4 AM, walking to my aunt’s coffee shop, and smashing big blocks of ice into smaller pieces. Back then in Vietnam, we didn’t have small ice cube machines like now, so I had to prepare all the crushed ice for the morning coffee rush.

After that, I washed two huge basins full of cups, dried them, and stacked them neatly on the shelves. When everything was clean, I helped my aunt bring coffee to the tables.

This was in Vietnam in 1997. Most of the customers were farmers and manual workers. They usually woke up around 3 AM, drank a small strong coffee, and went to work. My dad was one of them.

I worked like that for three months during my summer break. Every day I woke up early and stayed there until 4 PM, I slept in after lunch 1,5 hours (in Vietnam we always sleep after lunch)

With the money I earned, I bought my Grade 6 textbooks, 10 notebooks, paid my school fees, and even had a little left so my mom took me to buy one new outfit.

That was my first time feeling proud of earning something with my own hands.

This isn't about comfort. This is about MENTAL WARFARE. Every nut is a RESET. Every time you bust is a REMINDER that you don't settle. That you're RELENTLESS. That you're operating at a level these other candidates can't even COMPREHEND.

""After 999 betrayals, I become their karma""","For three days, I was in the hospital. For three days, my phone didn't make a sound. Not a single call from my family. And I didn't reach out, either. For the first time, I didn't find myself endlessly scrolling through their social media feeds, trying to piece together their lives from a distance.

　　I just rested. I’d lie in my hospital bed, or I’d drag my aching body down the hall for another test or to settle another bill.

　　Even on my discharge day, I didn't tell anyone. I just packed my few things, gritted my teeth against the throb in my abdomen, and took myself home.

　　The moment I pushed the front door open, the laughter in the living room cut off sharply.

　　Everyone was there. My fiancé, Micah, was sitting right next to Pearl, his arm slung casually over her shoulders. When he saw me, he quickly pulled it back and offered me an awkward smile. ""Soph, you're back? Where did you disappear to these past few days?""

　　My brother, Albi Bennett, let out a derisive snort. ""Where do you think? She just had to skip Pearl's graduation. She can't stand a single day where Vivi is the one in the spotlight.""

　　I didn't say a word. I just started walking toward my room.

　　My silence seemed to throw Albi off. Usually, an accusation like that would have me in tears, desperately pleading my case. But not this time.

　　My mom hurried over, holding a glass of juice. ""Hana, sweetie, we were just so swamped with Vivi's graduation party the other day, we missed your calls. Don't be upset, okay?"" She pressed a glass of cranberry juice into my hand.

　　A dull ache pulsed in my chest, even though I thought I was numb to it.

　　I'm allergic to cranberries. Pearl adores them. Because of that, our house was always stocked with anything cranberry-flavored. No matter how many times I'd mentioned my allergy, no one ever seemed to remember.

　　I handed the glass back to her and took a small step back. ""I'm not mad. I'm just going to my room.""

　　As I turned, a loud crash erupted from the living room.

　　My dad had shot to his feet, slamming his hand on the coffee table. ""What is with that sour face since you walked in?"" he screamed. ""Your mother apologized and even brought you your favorite drink! What more do you want? Looks like we've spoiled you rotten!""

　　My heart twisted so hard it hurt to breathe. Tears welled in my eyes, but I reached out, took the glass from my mom's hand, and drank the entire thing in a few desperate gulps.

　　I set the empty glass down gently and wiped my tears away. I looked my dad squarely in the eye, my voice eerily calm. ""Pearl is the one who likes cranberry juice. I'm allergic to it. But it's fine. I drank it all. May I please go to my room now?""

　　""Hana! Why didn't you say something if you're allergic? Who told you to drink it! You're so stubborn!"" Mom fretted, patting my back nervously.

　　Dad looked momentarily ashamed, but it quickly hardened back into anger. ""You could have just said something! You've always had this unlikable attitude. Nothing like Vivi. She knows how to talk to people properly.""

　　Pearl's sweet voice floated from the couch. ""Dad, please don't talk to Hana like that. You'll upset her."" She sounded so gentle, but the smug triumph in her eyes was unmistakable.

　　Pearl had always used my quiet nature to shine brighter. She lived for these comparisons, only truly satisfied when she saw me crushed beneath her heel.

　　I should have felt hurt. I should have been raging. But all I felt was a hollow, endless numbness. Even this public humiliation couldn't stir a single emotion.

　　""I'm sorry,"" I said, my voice flat. ""It won't happen again.""

　　The moment the words left my mouth, a stunned silence fell over the room. Everyone just stared.

　　My obedience left everyone momentarily stunned. After a heavy pause, my dad was the first to speak, his voice slightly less gruff. ""Good. That's the right attitude. We're family. Everything we do is for your own good.""

　　""I know,"" I replied, the words automatic, a numb smile fixed on my face.

　　Seeing I wasn't going to cause trouble, the tension in the room eased. They turned their attention back to Pearl, and the muted chatter from the living room resumed.

　　I took a quiet breath and moved toward the staircase.

　　But as my foot touched the bottom step, a hand closed around my wrist.

　　Micah had slipped up beside me unnoticed. He leaned in, his voice a low whisper. ""You're really not upset?""

　　That faux-gentle tone made my eyes sting all over again. A wave of bitter hurt rose in my chest, but I could only shake my head, my throat too tight to form words.

　　He looked visibly relieved. ""I knew you'd be understanding. You've never been one to make a scene."" He paused, glancing away uncomfortably. ""Look, there's something I wanted to talk about…""

　　 He avoided my eyes. ""We need to postpone the wedding next week.

　　 I promised your sister a long time ago I'd take her to see the Northern Lights at Aurora Bay after her graduation.

　　 Now that the ceremony's over, she won't stop asking me to keep my word. I thought—why not make it a family trip?

　　 The invitations haven't gone out yet. It's just a date; pushing it back a few weeks doesn't change anything,"" he said, a faint, fond smile touching his lips at the mention of her.

　　My heart froze solid. The tears I'd almost shed moments ago now felt like a pathetic joke.

　　 After 999 times of being cast aside, how could a part of me still hope for anything else?

　　When I didn't respond, Micah grew impatient, running a hand through his hair. ""Come on, Soph. Pearl's never been abroad.

　　 This is a huge deal for her. As her family, we should be there. And you've never seen the Aurora either. Think of it as an early honeymoon.""

　　""Sure,"" I said.

　　He blinked, taken aback. ""What did you say?""

　　I let out a slow, measured breath. ""I said, I agree to cancel the wedding.""

　　""Cancel? Who said anything about canceling? I said postpone. We're not canceling the wedding,"" he corrected, a deep frown forming on his face.

　　I lowered my head. A bitter, hollow smile tugged at my lips. Was there really a difference?

　　 As long as Pearl was around, she would never let this wedding happen. She coveted everything I had.

　　 I'd known this since we were children. It was a fight I could never win.

　　 My family's blind favoritism was her ultimate weapon, and now, my own fiancé had fully joined her ranks.

　　My eyes began to burn, and a familiar, crawling itch spread across my skin. The cranberry juice was finally taking effect.

　　I gave a slight nod and turned to go upstairs. I needed the allergy medication in my room before the reaction got worse.

　　""Are you mad that I'm going to Aurora Bay with Micah?"" Pearl's voice came from behind me, dripping with false innocence.

　　I ignored her and kept walking. This was her classic tactic. Even if I did nothing, a single, well-timed pout from her would rally the entire family to her side.

　　Albi was the first to erupt. ""Hey! Soph! Are you deaf? Vivi is talking to you! First you claim you're not angry, now you're giving everyone the silent treatment. Is that any way to act?""

　　I didn't answer. I was so accustomed to these baseless accusations; my entire life had been filled with them. I had learned to face them with a void of emotion.

I'd rather push a button. 

I originally debated between Barista Pro and the Dinamica Plus. It's been three years so maybe there are new options? 

I typically make an Americano. I still use my Keurig for water {the barista pro takes longer to make hot water and it would need to be refilled way more often}. Add the shot and I have a handheld frother. I mainly use Premier Protein shakes for foam on top of the Americano. 90% of the time that is my preferred morning drink. Anymore i just pop in a K-cup and call it a day. I get my beans from a local coffee shop.

Sometimes I'll use oatmilk or creamers for others, every now and again regular milk. And sometimes I make a cold brew for my daughter who visits often. So that's why the Dinamica appealed initially but you could also just pour it over ice.

Ideally under $2k. I see Costco has the Dinamica Plus on sale for $999 on Black Friday which started my question. Thanks.

It had been a mostly sleepless night, as I had expected. Maybe it was the proximity to the location, or maybe it was the memories retread the day before, but Leroy haunted my every attempt at rest. I was lucky if I got two hours of actual sleep. Dawn had more or less ruined any opportunity for more. It had always been impossible for me to sleep during the daytime. Blackout curtains weren’t an option in a tent, either.

I rather begrudgingly withdrew from my shelter and stepped out into the chilly morning air. I took a seat at a nearby picnic table while my coffee brewed over a sterno burner. It was the most palatable part of my pre-packaged breakfast of freeze dried eggs. My eyes went distant as I zoned out going through the motions. I didn’t even hear approaching footsteps until a voice came from behind me.

“How was your hike?”

I immediately recognized the voice as belonging to the ranger I’d met the day before. I turned to find her smiling gently as she approached, an encouraging warmth radiating from her eyes in contrast to my exhaustion. She didn’t seem offput by my appearance, almost acting as if she didn’t even notice the slump to my shoulders and the hollowness of my gaze. If anything, my hesitance in responding seemed to cause her smile to grow wider.

“It was good,” I finally answered, pausing to take a sip of my coffee, “Exhausting in more ways than one, but I should have expected that.”

She seemed genuinely curious about my response and swiftly rounded the table to take a seat across from me. I was surprised by her actions, not sure what to make of them. I couldn’t imagine she didn’t have better things to do. Wasting time idly chatting with a visitor seemed beneath her. However, she gave absolutely no sign that she had ulterior motives.

“How do you mean?” Jen asked.

I shrugged my shoulders, looking down into my nearly empty bag of eggs and scooping out another mouthful before I answered. It was a stalling tactic, because I wasn’t immediately sure how to answer her. It still seemed foolish to give more details than were necessary. She just made it difficult to hold back. Her whole demeanor was so beguiling that I couldn’t really stop myself. She was charming, and I wish that fact and my lack of sleep was a good enough excuse for what came out of my mouth.

“Like I said yesterday,” my voice felt hollow, no doubt due to the lingering emotions from the previous day, “There’s a lot of memories out here.”

I could feel her eyes on me as I went for another bite. I wasn’t quite willing to look up and meet her gaze. It seemed every time I looked at her, I lost most of my self control. I couldn’t really afford to give up much more of it. It wasn’t as though I disliked the conversation, but it was distracting from my goals. I didn’t want to be rude, but I hoped that she would keep this visit as brief as our previous conversation.

From the edge of my vision, I saw her place her elbows on the table and lean in to answer, “Sounds like they aren’t all good ones.”

I sighed and shook my head, “No.”

I set my breakfast aside, realizing I wasn’t getting out of this that easily. Reaching over to my coffee, I pulled it off of the burner and took a sip as I finally looked over at the woman. She had rested her chin in her hands and was looking at me with a smile, but I could see that I’d brought down her mood. She was empathizing with me in a way I hadn’t expected. It made me wonder if the talk we’d idly made yesterday had a more profound impact than it should have.

“I’m sorry,” She said quietly, “I don’t mean to pry.”

I offered her a weak smile and solace with a simple response, “It’s fine.”

“It’s just…” I trailed off as I found my gaze lowering.

I stared into the black well of coffee. My hands held the stainless steel mug, welcoming the warmth in the cold morning air. Steam wafted up from it, dancing around my face enough to tease at my chilled features. It was a funny sort of metaphor for the conversation as a whole. Though talking to Jen lifted my spirits in the moment, I knew it was just a fleeting relief before I returned to my mission.

I looked up at her and tried to maintain my smile, “I didn’t have much of a childhood, and what I did have was mostly out here.”

“It’s strange,” I started, hesitating for a moment before continuing, “I didn’t expect it to haunt me as much as it did. I’ve got a whole life away from this place. I haven’t been back in so long, I just sort of… expected it to be a forest.”

Jen sat up, letting her hands drop into her lap as she nodded at me, “I get that.”

“It’s the same for me when I go home,” she said, “The memories I have in the house I grew up in aren’t the best.”

“There’s good ones, but I have to chase them, like I said,” sadness crept in as she continued.

She looked down at her hands and I could tell she was fidgeting with them beneath the table. I couldn’t quite see the expression on her face, but I could tell she was trying to find her smile again. It made my heart sink knowing that I’d caused her to feel this way. I hated being the one to drag the mood down, but it was an unfortunately common occurrence. It came with the territory of having such a traumatic past, I supposed.

“Hey,” I tried to interrupt her somber musings, “So tell me, how’d you wind up a ranger here?”

She looked up at me with some surprise, but seemed glad to shift the conversation, “Oh, well, I guess it was kind of the easiest option.”

“I went to UA for my degree,” She was perking up more and more by the word, “I fell in love with the Ozarks and met a recruiter at the college. He told me all about what this sort of work was like and it just seemed like a good fit.”

I nodded, curiosity causing me to ask, “What did you go to school for?”

Jen looked at me a little sheepishly before answering, “Anthropology.”

“Really?” I asked with perhaps a little too much incredulity.

“What’s wrong with that?” she asked with faux indignation, “Not a real enough science for the tree guy?”

That got a genuine laugh out of me and I could see her smile wider in response, “No, it’s just not what I expected.”

“Well, what *did* you expect?” she pressed me, again shifting her expression into mock umbrage.

I thought about my answer for a moment, but decided to be genuine, “I don’t know.”

“I guess it suits you,” I clarified, “But I figure most rangers are more on the practical application end of the sciences, if not in it for the law enforcement aspect of the job.”

“Suits me, huh?” she developed a bit of wickedness in her grin as she leaned forward into the conversation.

I shook my head, laughing again, “Yes, you’re quite the people person, I can tell.”

“I guess you’re right about that,” she admitted, shrugging her shoulders, “I’ve been known to strike up conversation about anything with just about anyone.

“That’s sort of what drew me into the field. I like to learn about people. I like to learn about history and why things happen the way that they do. It’s fascinating how much you can learn about people from looking at how they interact with the world around them. It also helps you understand how the world shapes the people that inhabit it.

“When it comes to being a ranger?” her smile became a little more subdued and the tone of her speech became more subtly wistful, “You get to see people at their best, interacting with nature and finding the part of us that’s bound to it. You get to see how nature shapes itself around our interaction with it. Here in Devil’s Den, you even get to see how many different groups of people have interacted with nature over time and how those interactions have resulted in the park as it is now.”

I found myself enamored with her as she spoke. I couldn’t help but watch her intently as she explained herself. She had an enthusiasm about what she was saying that was understated, but sincere. I couldn’t help but deeply respect her reasons for being here. It certainly caused me to feel self-conscious about my own career and the lack of passion I had for it at this point. As much as I truly loved nature, Forestry wasn’t what I had dreamed of doing as a child. It was quite far from the adolescent fantasies I’d had, in fact.

As she kept talking, I felt my own smile slip away. The reflection I was lost in was causing my convictions to falter. I was starting to wonder what I was doing here at all. I couldn’t help but begin to feel as though I was wasting my time. Sitting here with someone who was doing what they loved made me feel as though I was throwing my own life away. However, even as I contemplated my entire existence to the point that her words were trailing away into white noise, the thoughts of Leroy were creeping in and taking hold.

There *was* a reason for me to be here. It wasn’t a pleasant one, and it wasn’t a productive one for my sanity or life, but it was there. I’d tried to run from it my entire life and failed at every single attempt. No matter what I did, he was there in the back of my mind to remind me of the life he could never have. I knew that he wouldn’t want me to torture myself, but he also wouldn’t want to be forgotten. He deserved justice and the ability to rest in peace. No one else had the means to see either happen.

“Henry?” she snapped me out of the introspection, head tilted to look me in my distant eyes.

She had a look on her face of mild irritation and concern. I felt my cheeks flush as I realized that I had just disassociated as she was speaking. It was beyond embarrassing, but it also wasn’t the first time that it had happened. I’d ruined more than a few relationships due to my sullen expression giving away the flights my mind took from conversation into contemplation. I felt especially self-conscious due to the legitimate feelings of respect and interest I had for her.

“I’m sorry,” I hastily apologized, bringing my hands up in a placating gesture, “You just, uh, had me considering my own motivations.”

I put my hands down and lowered my gaze back to the table, “I guess… you’ve got me feeling a little guilty about why I do what I do.”

“Why’s that?” she asked.

“Well,” I started, but I caught myself before I could wallow too much in my own self doubt, “I’ve always loved nature. I think that comes from my mom’s side of the family. She was Osage.”

“Really?” Jen perked up at the admission, “Now that’s a coincidence. Their tribal history is one of the things that drew me here.”

“Small world,” I deflected away from that line of conversation, trying to rein in my oversharing, “But, as far as Forestry goes? I think it was just an easy career to use as an excuse to spend time out in nature.”

She smiled at me, dismissing my words with her own, “That’s plenty good of a reason to do what you do. In fact, I’d bet that makes you better at it than not. If you don’t love nature and want to spend all the time in the world out in it, how would you know what makes it so important to maintain and nurture?”

I looked at her with mild astonishment. She hadn’t even hesitated to offer that response, but her words touched at the edges of my soul. I’d never considered what she’d said and I suddenly felt more at peace with the direction my life had taken. Even my own therapist hadn’t managed to impart that sort of solace after years of sessions. It almost took my mind off of the reason I’d lied in the first place.

Even if she could help with the feelings of disconnection from my path in life, she couldn’t help with the real problems plaguing me. It wasn’t something she could understand, even if I was willing to speak to her about it. Maybe, if I could see through my reason for being here, I could take what she’d given me and move on with my life. However, there was no moving on as long as part of me was lost here in these woods. I had to overcome the anchor of my past to ever find myself in a position to actually have a future.

“Thank you,” I said, honestly meaning it.

She reached out and touched my hand, “You’re welcome.”

“But,” she added, pulling her hand back so that she could stand up from the table, “You can thank me with more than words later.”

I watched as she stood up, eyes slowly wandering up her body until I found her eyes deviously cast back down at me as she elaborated on her words, “When you get tired of eating freeze dried meals, you can have dinner with me in town.”

I was taken by surprise with that statement. As pleasant as our interactions had been, I didn’t expect her to actually have any desire to spend time with me in her off hours. Especially after my fumbling of this conversation, I had assumed we were unlikely to speak again. I was at a loss for a moment before I realized I should stand to see her off. I banged my knee off the table and heard her giggle at my awkwardness. The heat in my cheeks returned with a vengeance as I came to my feet.

“Sure,” I managed, offering her a sheepish smile, “That sounds great.”

She nodded at me, giving me a small wave as she turned to walk away, “I’ll hold you to it.”",2,1764013898.0,creepcast,0,1.0,False

1p5r35e,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1p5r35e,Clark + Hopkins: Peak hot sauce for those who like exploring unique flavors,"After purchasing three individual bottles, I had to pull the trigger and do a deep dive with this company. I am very picky when it comes to hot sauces and loath generic tasting vinegar bombs… so how delighted was I to discover that every bottle I purchased was not only an entirely unique flavor, but was also instantly added to my ‘frequent use’ tier list. No joke. 5 out of 5 winners. 

I’ve found, the best hot sauce companies (Torchbearer, Queen Majesty, etc) include an almost branded taste to each of their offerings, I assume because they are using artisanal ingredients, and Clark + Hopkins can absolutely be added to that list. Their offerings also deliver a heat that doesn’t hit immediately, but slowly creeps in (another feature I’ve only experienced with high end sauce companies). Suffice to say, this might’ve just become my favorite hot sauce company. 

Things to consider: 

I love the consistency, as you can taste bits of ingredients, but these would all be considered thin sauces. The heat levels are also lower than some might prefer. The hottest is Assam sauce — which isn’t featured here, but I’ve purchased twice in the past. It’s a dark curry based sauce and it packs a decent punch. The rest of the catalogue falls somewhere between 2-5 out of 10 on the heat scale. 

District, Ethiopia, Assam (not pictured): 

Seriously, try one of these sauces. They each use this unique Berber spice that they import… and boy can you taste it. It’s like a cinnamon curry, but not that sweet. District Sauce has the least heat and tastes like a middle eastern BBQ sauce. Ethiopia is about a 5 on the heat index and adds a distinct ginger flavor. Assam is the spiciest and has a savory, gravy taste to it. 

Arizona: 

An amazing verde sauce. Distinct lime and cilantro flavors. Sounds generic, doesn’t taste generic. Perfect on tacos (duh). My one small criticism is that this one could use a bit more heat. 

Oaxaca: 

A mole based sauce. Smoky. Deep, rich flavor that might surprise you at first. Includes Mezcal which adds a lot complexity. Reminded me a lot of Queen Majesty Coffee Habanero or Coco Ghost. Might as well be a genre of hot sauce, unto itself. 

Virginia: 

Peach, Whiskey, Habanero... and you can so clearly taste each of those flavors. That’s one thing I love about Clark + Hopkins… there’s so much clarity with the overlapping flavors. I typically don’t like alcohol based hot sauces, but the peach compliments the whiskey so well, I don’t like this sauce despite the alcohol flavor, but because of it.

(please click pic post as reference) I have to admit, I’m inconsistent when it comes to wearing my “invisible” retainers. The reason is that I drink a lot of coffee every day to stay productive, which is pretty obvious from the color of my teeth. I was told not to drink colored or hot drinks while wearing them. Even at night, I sometimes drink coffee before I sleep.

Now my problem is that I’ve noticed my lower teeth slowly developing noticeable spaces, and food often gets stuck. I’m afraid I might need another round of dental braces. I also refused to have my wisdom teeth removed because they’re not damaged and sayang naman if I remove them dati.

I have a few questions now that I think I need to take action before it’s too late:

1. Do I still need to get my wisdom teeth removed after braces to keep my teeth aligned correctly?
2. How can I know if I’m a good candidate for veneers?
3. If I get veneers in the future, will they keep my teeth aligned permanently since my retainers may no longer fit?",1,1764013444.0,DentistPh,2,1.0,False

He’s been with me 3 weeks now, sleeps through the whole night since day 1. 
Already knows sit, touch, his name, and getting pretty good at place and lie down. Also decent impulse control when training with leaving food, is starting to learn fetch for play, and sits and waits for me to open the door when coming back in from walks. Has already stopped biting the leash and flying off in zoomies when coming back in too, now he sits and waits for me to take the leash off most of the time.
Doing really good with giving attention too, looking me in the eyes during walks and when doing food impulse control training. 

Only thing we gotta work harder on is not greeting all strangers, too many people have been trying to come up and pet him and it’s making him very excited. Thinking of making a leash attachment that says not to pet the dog.

It’s a little cold outside so we’re working on getting him to keep his shoes on, but even still he has been doing wonderfully with leash training. He has already pretty much learned to not bite since we started training on that early on, so now he only nips when overtired before naps or at bedtime.
Crate training has honestly been fucking smooth sailing. He rides the bus with me without issue, lies down in his carrier bag with the top open. 
When I took him out for socialization at a coffee shop he lied down in my lap with his chew watching people, or slept.
We have also done an overnight train ride, for which he was amazingly calm the whole time. 

I love him to bits, he is the sweetest boy ever. This is my first puppy, first dog actually, I was worried about being a single puppy parent but it’s going so well. Am watching puppy training videos every day, and I feel it is really paying off.

For years I worked with Grade 5 titanium in the medical industry — a material that’s strong, elegant, and way too beautiful to stay only inside equipment no one ever sees.

At some point, the idea became impossible to ignore:  
*“Why not bring this material into something people can enjoy every day on their wrist?”*

My brother agreed, and that was pretty much the entire creative meeting.

The truth is we’re just two regular guys with normal 9–5 jobs, building this brand in the hours before and after work.  
Late nights, early mornings, and a lot of “one more coffee and we can finish this.”

That’s why this watch is, in many ways, made for everyone like us, the ""5-to-9 hustlers"", side-project dreamers, people who build quietly, consistently, and with heart.

And that’s how Le Pin Watches began — named after the small Croatian town we come from, surrounded by pine forests that inspired the idea of longevity, standing tall, staying focused, and building things with intention.

Two years later:

* We’ve crafted our first watch from Grade 5 titanium
* Given it an ocean-blue dial that we fell in love with instantly
* Paired it with a Swiss movement
* And placed it into a pine-wood box finished with a traditional Japanese technique — because details matter, and we like beautiful things

The prototypes are done.  
The first batch is ready.  
And after enough coffee to power a small village, we’re finally launching.

1p5qva5,https://www.reddit.com/r/Essay_Club/comments/1p5qva5/how_to_develop_good_study_habits_for_college/,How to Develop Good Study Habits for College,"Effective studying is critical to success in college, and many new college students quickly find that their prior study habits need major adjustments. To begin making the change, find a quiet, organized space to study. Study with a positive attitude and specific goals in mind. If you need help, there's no shame in asking. Your professors and peers are there to help you learn. You can develop excellent habits that help you navigate the difficulties of college.

# Getting Organized to Study

**Create a dedicated study space.** Find a quiet space in your dorm room or somewhere on campus where you can focus. Studying in the same place every day trains your brain to associate a certain environment with work. This will help you get into the zone when you start studying.

* Pick a place that's quiet and distraction free. The basement of your dorm may not be a good choice if it's a common place for socializing, but you could instead study at your desk in your dorm room.
* **Reader Poll:** We asked 464 wikiHow readers which study space they found most effective for staying focused and productive, and **48%** of them said, **a quiet library cubicle.**

**Find a regular time for studying.** If you study at the same time each day, your brain will be prepped for learning when you sit down. Review your schedule and see when you have free time. Schedule an hour or two for studying during those times each day.

* You can study during gaps between classes or in the evening after your classes are done for the day.
* In addition to finding times that work, find times when you're naturally more energetic. If you tend to get sleepy in the afternoon, do something relaxing for yourself around two o'clock and schedule study time sometime after dinner.

**Organize your materials.** Make sure you have everything you need to study at your study space. If you're studying in a place in your home, keep things like your books, pencils, pens, and scrap paper in that area. If you go out to study, invest in a book bag with a lot of compartments and keep all your study supplies stored there.

* It can help to stop by a local office supplies store to get things like notebooks, pencil boxes, and other storage contraptions to keep yourself organized.

**Eliminate distractions.** When readying your study space, it's important to keep it distraction free. Remove any technologies that will take your mind off your work, like your smartphone. You can even use apps to block distracting websites like Facebook while you're studying, forcing you to focus on academic websites instead.

* Keep other distracting material, such as outside reading, away from your study area.
* If you go out of your dorm or apartment to study, do not take anything potentially distracting. Stick to your school supplies only and leave things like your iPod at home. However, if you are studying in a noisy place, you may want to bring your headphones if music helps you focus.

**Figure out your needs via trial and error.** College is all about experimentation. It can take awhile to find your groove when it comes to studying. For a few weeks at the beginning of the semester, experiment with studying at different times and places until you figure out when and where you're more productive.

* For example, study in your dorm one day and a coffee shop the next day. Take note of which place you feel the most relaxed and engaged and make a habit of studying there regularly.

# Using Good Study Techniques

**Create one goal for each session.** Your study sessions are most effective if they have some direction. Just blindly studying can be overwhelming and you may waste time fumbling to figure out where to start. Before each study session, figure out what topics are most pressing and set goals.

* For example, if you're studying for a math final, focus on one concept each day. You can study multiplication one day and things like division the next.
* You can also set goals based on days of the week. Focus on your math and science courses on Mondays and Wednesdays and your humanities courses on Thursdays and Fridays, for example.

**Start with difficult material first.** You'll be most energetic at the beginning of your study period. Therefore, it makes sense to begin by studying the most challenging materials. Tackle the most difficult subjects and topics first before targeting your strong points.

* For example, if you're really struggling understanding a concept for a philosophy class, study your notes and reading on that concept first. Then, you can move on to easier topics.

**Rewrite your notes.** Studying requires a lot of memorization. It can help to simply rewrite your notes and reword them as you go. Read over all your notes for one session and then rewrite them on a separate sheet of paper. This will force you to engage with the material and write it in your own words again, which increases understanding and helps you remember what you've learned.

**Use memory games.** Memory games can help you remember tough concepts and terms. You can use visualization techniques or string together words that help you remember concepts. These can be highly useful for an exam.

* For example, a well known memory device is Kings Play Cards On Flat Green Stools, used to help you remember the taxonomy order used to classify species (Kingdom, Phylum, Class, Order, Family, Genus, Species).
* You can also use visualization. For example, you're trying to remember Jeanette Rankin was the first woman to serve in Congress and you have an Aunt Jeanette. Picture your Aunt Jeanette talking on the floor of Congress to help you remember.

**Take breaks.** No one can study for hours on end without getting frustrated and burnt out. Breaks help you relax, recharge, and approach a situation with new eyes. Make a habit of studying for one hour and then taking a five minute break to do something you enjoy, like go on social media or text a friend.

* Set a timer to make sure you're on task. You don't want to study for too long, leading to frustration, or take a long break, which can ruin your concentration.

  
**Study with a positive attitude.** If you see studying as a chore, you're likely to get frustrated and burn out. Instead of seeing studying as something you have to do, look at the positives. Think of this as a way to improve your skills and abilities and get the most out of your education.

* Studying can be stressful, and it's important to address and challenge stressful thoughts. For example, don't think, ""I'm a mess. I'm never going to understand this."" Instead think, ""I'm sure if I work a little each day, I can figure out this material.""

**Give yourself rewards.** Studying feels easier if you have something to look forward to when you're done. Develop a reward system for yourself so you're motivated to get through your work.

* For example, agree that if you study for three hours, you can go to the cafeteria and have something like ice cream or pizza for a treat.

# Seeking Outside Resources

**Refer to your syllabus as needed.** It's important you understand the expectations of your course as you're studying. Use the syllabus as your guide if you feel overwhelmed or lost while studying. The syllabus will outline major concepts, grade breakdowns, and so on.

* For example, say you've been getting frustrated memorizing the years of major scientific breakthroughs for a science course. The syllabus says the goals of the course are to help you gain a better understanding of scientific theory. It's more important for you to understand the overarching theories than know the exact dates.

**Form a study group.** Find peers who are hard workers and do well in the course. Ask them to form a study group. The right study group can really help you stay focused and engaged and gain a better understanding of course material.

* Choose the right peers. If your study group is made up of friends, studying may turn into socializing fast. Pick good students who are genuinely engaged in class.
* Bounce off one another's strengths. If a classmate is confused on a subject you're skilled at, and does well in an area that confuses you, they would make a good partner. The two of you can help one another out.

**Go to your professors with questions.** There is nothing to be embarrassed about if you have questions. Everyone gets confused sometimes and needs some extra help. If you have questions on a concept or subject, e-mail your professor or go to office hours. They may be able to offer you tips and tricks to better understand the material.

* Your professor's office hours should be stated on their green sheet, which they handed out at the beginning of the semester.
* When e-mailing your professor, state your class day and time in the subject header. Professors often teach more than one class.

**Go to review sessions if they are offered.** Some teachers have review sessions each week or before an exam. Always make a habit of going if you have time in your schedule. Review sessions can help you gain a better understanding of course materials. They can also be a great place to ask professors or teaching assistants questions.

* If your teacher does not offer a review session, ask them if they are willing to do it. If enough students are interested in a review session, they may create one.

**Use a tutor.** If your campus has tutoring centers, make use of them if you ever need help. You can also look for a private tutor in your area online. A little one-on-one help can go a long way if you're confused about a subject.

* Not all tutors advertise in the tutoring center on college campuses. Some tutors post their fliers on the school bulletin board, alongside other fliers for housing and textbook sales.
* If you cannot find any tutors, ask your classmates. Some of them may be willing to help you before or after class, and not all of them will charge a fee.

Quirk Mechanics
Core Function: The Upgrade

Activation Trigger: Legal, unambiguous ownership + time. The user must mentally acknowledge the item as ""theirs."" The one-week (168 hours) timer is a fixed rule.

Nature of Upgrades: The upgrades are not random; they are logical, beneficial evolutions tailored to the item's purpose and the user's subconscious needs.

A Notebook: Becomes infinitely reusable, its pages clearing when the user wishes. The pen never runs out of ink and writes in any color the user desires.

A Pair of Sneakers: The soles self-repair, the laces never come untied, and they gradually enhance the user's running efficiency and silence their footsteps.

A Basic First-Aid Kit: The bandages become hyper-absorbent and have mild antiseptic properties. The painkillers become more effective with fewer side effects.

A Home/Apartment: The locks become unpickable, the Wi-Fi signal is always perfect and secure, the walls gradually become more soundproof and durable.

Limits of Upgrades: It cannot create something from nothing. A normal knife can become a monomolecular blade, but it can't shoot fire unless it was already a flamethrower. The upgrade is an enhancement, not a complete transmutation.

Core Function: The Aegis of Ownership
This is the most powerful and insidious part of the Quirk.

Mental Erasure: It doesn't create a physical barrier. It directly alters the thought processes of any sapient being (human, animal with high intelligence, possibly some mutants) who considers an action that would deprive the user of their property.

How it Manifests:

A Thief: Would approach, then their mind would go blank. They'd forget why they were there, decide to get a coffee instead, and have no memory of ever intending to steal.

A Friend asking to borrow a pen: Would open their mouth, pause, and say ""Never mind, I found one!"" even if they didn't. The thought is erased before it's fully formed.

Forced Sharing (A Teacher): A teacher saying ""Lend your calculator to your classmate"" would find the words sticking in their throat, or they would immediately move on to the next student without understanding why.

The User's Perspective: The user is aware of this effect but doesn't control it. They'll have grown up in a world where no one ever took their toys, asked for a bite of their food, or borrowed a pencil. This would create a profound and unique form of social isolation.",1,1764013095.0,QuirkIdeas,0,1.0,False

She would just always glare at me and frown at me. Clearly a miserable lady. I would always dread when she would take my order because it would never be right and I think it was intentional. But I never complained or said anything ever. I was only anything but nice to this older lady. Anyway I put up with that for a while until one day when this happened… 

She was making my coffee, she had the cup right in front of her and it was at this point when she was directly over the empty cup that she decided to take the eye crust out of her eyes look at them on her fingers and then physically put them into the cup before filling it up with coffee. She even looked over her shoulder as she did it. I was so disgusted and shocked that when she handed me the coffee I was speechless. 

I called up later and mentioned it to the manager saying that it was probably on camera and it was extremely obvious what she did. I of course did not drink the coffee. Regardless of me calling and explaining what happened according to my friend this woman still works there probably still putting eye crusts into other peoples coffee that she deems a target.

I know these machines (we have the **START**) aren't a patch on what machines *can* cost but £300 is for us a lot to spend on a coffee machine.

Tried it out today & was underwhelmed by its results until I tried my expensive (local roasters, £12/250g bag) coffee on the espresso setting - then it was a 'not a million miles off' taste from the coffee shop itself & my Mokka pot. 

Problem there is, the miniscule measures. I could do a double I guess. Previously I'd been using the Mokka pot & that (4 cup mokka) + a measure of milk in the frother would fill my cup & be enough.

I tried the coffee setting & found the flavour to be kind of weak. 

I also like milk with my coffee. I never drink it black. I'd been running oat milk through my Nespreso Aeroccino which helps add volume so that I'm drinking more than 1ml. £12 a bag though is quite a bit to experiment with with all the various settings.

  
Before I commit to returning it though, what size grind do you guys have your machines set to?

And also, I know this one will depend on which types of drink you're choosing (espresso - coffee - long) but how many drinks would you expect to get out of a 250g bag of beans, so that I can try & factor in a semi accurate cost in to my decision.

When I did the coffee setting I had it on the medium bean & found it weak which only gives 1 more for strength yet the medium bean was fine for espresso.

1p5qm1v,https://www.reddit.com/r/GoodMovieIdeas/comments/1p5qm1v/men_in_black_the_agency/,Men in Black: The Agency,"MiB: The Dark Truth Behind the Smiles

Most audiences see the Men in Black as quirky agents policing aliens with gadgets and witty banter. But beneath the suits lies a shadowy, morally complex agency navigating cosmic horror, historical alien threats, and the psychological cost of controlling reality itself.


---

1. Historical Incidents Shape Policy

The MIB’s enforcement is guided by history: past alien incursions show that extraterrestrial life isn’t always benign. Examples (hinted at in-universe) include:

Species attempting global manipulation or mass destruction.

Parasites or interdimensional entities that rewrote consciousness, leaving madness in their wake.

Advanced alien technology capable of subjugating humanity if unchecked.


These incidents justify strict regulation and selective mercy. Yet ethical questions remain—allowing some to live, heavily restricted, highlights the moral ambiguity of the agency. Extreme incidents may correlate with MIB regulations, but causation is never provable.


---

2. Neuralyzer Consequences and Psychological Mutation

Neuralyzers, while intended to protect secrecy, carry hidden costs:

Recipients experience nightmares, subconscious pressure to recall erased memories, and neurological harm.

Agents themselves mutate psychologically: dark humor, emotional detachment, and professional silence become survival mechanisms.

Exposure shapes morality: the “clean” conscience of a hopeful agent contrasts with the hardened psyche of experienced operatives.



---

3. Media Manipulation & Shadow Control

The MIB actively curate public perception:

Incidents are spun as natural phenomena or hoaxes.

Society remains calm, but beneath the surface exists a quasi-military oversight structure.

Agents balance historical knowledge with deception, bearing the weight of truth humanity cannot handle.



---

4. Agent Archetypes & Dialogue Dynamics

Hopeful Agents:

Seek moral clarity.

“We can’t erase everything, can we? Someone has to remember what’s worth remembering.”


Dark-Humor Agents:

Cope with horror via biting humor.

“Another day, another universe we accidentally destabilized. Coffee?”


Silent / Professional Agents:

Speak minimally; silence reflects experience.

“Report sent.”


Scene Example: Post-mission debrief after containing a memory-altering parasite:

> Hopeful: “We… we saved some lives today, right? At least some.”
Dark-Humor: “Sure. And we gave the others a lifetime supply of existential dread for free. Who wouldn’t want that?”
Silent: (nods, checks neuralyzer calibration, says nothing)
Hopeful: “I just… I can’t stop thinking about them. Were we right to do this?”
Dark-Humor: “Right? Oh, we’re past right. Welcome to morally gray land. Population: us.”




---

5. Cosmic and Ethical Horror

The MIB confront:

Interdimensional entities manipulating reality.

Psychological trauma from neuralyzers.

Moral dilemmas where preventing disaster comes at the cost of freedom and truth.



---

6. Philosophical Themes

Duality of Society: Happiness requires a dark, hidden hand.

Selective Morality: Aliens are over-policed; humans largely left unchecked.

Questionable Mercy: Conditional freedom creates moral tension.

Cost of Knowledge: Agents bear the burden of truth, unseen by the public.



---

7. Fan Theory Logline

""The Men in Black do more than police aliens—they manage the consequences of historical threats, enforce selective mercy, manipulate perception, and endure the psychological cost of tools that warp mind and memory. In a morally gray world, every victory carries a price, and the line between protection and tyranny is razor-thin.""


---

Visual Storyboard Example

Scene 1 – Historical Incident Flashback

Panel 1: Black-and-white archival footage style; alien species manipulating global communications.

Panel 2: MIB agents silently observing chaos, taking notes.

Panel 3: Neuralyzer flash; journalists’ memories erased, panic contained.


Scene 2 – Neuralyzer Consequences

Panel 1: Agent alone in dimly lit room, twitching from nightmares.

Panel 2: Close-up: neuralyzer scars faintly visible; subconscious images flash behind eyes.

Panel 3: Agent mutters dark humor line, almost involuntarily.


Scene 3 – Media Manipulation

Panel 1: News broadcast reporting “unexplained power outage” instead of alien sabotage.

Panel 2: Agents in surveillance hub, monitoring media feeds, expressionless.

Panel 3: Silent agent types notes into secure database; camera pans to wall of hidden alien files.


Scene 4 – Agent Dynamics

Panel 1: Post-mission debrief: hopeful agent visibly shaken.

Panel 2: Dark-humor agent cracks an uncomfortable joke, breaking tension.

Panel 3: Silent agent watches, reacts minimally, underscoring psychological adaptation.


Scene 5 – Cosmic Threat

Panel 1: Interdimensional creature emerging in shadowed alley, reality distorting.

Panel 2: Agents deploy containment, neuralyzers flash.

Panel 3: Creature subdued, residual psychic effects ripple through agents’ minds—dark humor and silence immediately return.

She is seeing a therapist. This isn't where the story begins, but it will be for now.
At friendsgiving, my gf made everyone wait for her arrival to eat. she came an hr later and we ate, she sat down looking visibly uncomfortable and texted me saying ""why didn't you tell me there were going to be this many people here"" and said she was uncomfortable. She knew everyone there except for one person (total of 8 people including me). My friend to my left asked if he should say hi but later felt scared to because of her demeanor. i tried comforting her by rubbing her leg and holding her but it wasn't working. My friend asked her if she wants anything to eat and she said no and put on her airpods. I thought that was extremely rude. Then, I tried comforting her again and she angrily said to leave her alone. Then she asked for her jacket and left without saying bye to me. My friend asked her if she wanted a plate to bring home while she was putting on her coat, she said no and walked out. This left the room feeling strange. My friend of 25 years went out to smoke a cigarette and I went out with him and he was telling me I need to break up with her. I think I've made the decision to but I don't know how to do it. We've been together for 5 years, and this isn't the first time she's done something like this. I think this has happened about 5 times now. When I mean ""this"" I mean her getting up and leaving gatherings without saying bye to me or relatives or friends.

 I understand she has social anxiety, but she hasn't been working on this with her therapist. I asked her if she got home safe and she didn't reply to me. So, I didn't message her yesterday and we were supposed to hang out. Then, she messages me at 12:38pm saying ""yup. I'm staying home. enjoy your day ✌🏽"" me and my two friends, the one who was scared to say hi and another friend that was at the gathering, went to get coffee to talk it over. At first, my friend who was sitting further away during the event was trying to defend my gf but then ended up also agreeing that I have to break up. My friend who's house we were at for the event who asked my gf if she wanted food, normally always would try to make me see my gfs side but even she texted me that she's not the right fit for me at this point, that she isn't fair to me, and takes me for granted.

 I asked for space through text after she texted me the thing to enjoy my day and she said sounds good. She later texted me at 10:44pm accusing me of turning on my read receipts on purpose to make her feel bad and that I purposely was trying to make her break and text me, and that by doing so i'm manipulative. I told her it's because I switched over to Google chat and turned on the RCS chat feature, and told her it turns on read receipts by default and then turned it off. I also respectfully told her that I need more space and thanked her. I'm not sure if I should message her today. She has abandonment issues and I don't want to traumatize her, but I need to put my mental health first because I haven't been for the longest time. Our early relationship was marked rife with a lot of abuse that I endured from her emotionally. It should've been my first sign to leave, but I didn't because I loved her too much. The most bizarre part is that I'm training to become a therapist and I'm coming to realize that if I can't burden this pain, I won't be able to effectively help my clients.

 I want to break up, but this is the most difficult thing I've ever had to do. I told my own therapist that the only thing holding me back is how much I'd miss her and how her family life is horrible and that I'd feel bad for her. He pretty much checked me but I just buried the feelings deep down because I know those are very poor reasons. I have to journal and self-reflect a lot. Even now, I feel alone taking this space but I've been listening to music and am trying to come to terms that this chapter in my life is ending. It's hard to not hate myself for letting this happen to me for this long, but our relationship wasn't all bad. Just not healthy, ever. I appreciate her for suggesting that I find a therapist after the first year we started dating. I know she felt immense sorrow and regret for the way she treated me at the beginning of our relationship, so I guess that's also another reason why I forgave her. I tried breaking up with her in 2023 after an incident where she started yelling at me in my car, throwing things around, and banging on my dashboard, which made me fear for my safety. This was due to an event that actually had to do with a previous friendsgiving. My friend changed the date and I didn't tell my gf right away which made her believe that no one wanted her there. She threw her arms around me and pleaded me to stay, and I caved. I'm afraid of that happening again. I'm still taking space from her right now and haven't messaged her. I'm lost and hurt. My friends think it's bizarre that she accused me of being manipulative and hasn't even apologized yet.

It wasn’t until years later that [*Brian Atkinson*](https://eeb.ku.edu/people/brian-atkinson) came across the fossil in the Sierra College Natural History Museum’s collection. He immediately recognized that this was something special. The[ fruit](https://dailygalaxy.com/2025/08/wwii-ship-survived-one-unexpected-fruit/) from the fossil belonged to the **Icacinaceae family**, a group of plants known to exist in much younger deposits, but never before seen in Cretaceous layers.

>

The fossil fruit, **preserved for millions of years**, had a striking surface with patterns that matched plants known from a much later period.

# The Fossil That Reveals Ancient Rainforest Life

According to the study published in [***Nature Plants***](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41477-022-01275-y), this fossil suggests that the rainforests of the Cretaceous period might have been more complex than scientists ever realized. The specimen comes from a group of plants that could have added important structure to ancient rainforests, **similar to the role plants play today**.

Before the dinosaurs vanished, Earth’s forests were mainly dominated by conifers like pine trees. But this plant relic points to a shift in ecosystems, with flowering plants, like the ones in this find, becoming more prominent.",1,1764012419.0,NSFNEWS,0,1.0,False

Not picking up a rental car til day 2, removing Howth Head walk or moving to day 2. Overall considering staying close to Dublin but excited about Leap Castle.

My partner and I are ending a two-week stint in Europe with 5 days in Ireland, 12/30-1/4 departure. I’m waffling on travels plans because we realize most everything will be closed for new year, and I’m not sure how wise it is to drive super far from Dublin where we’ll arrive/leave from. We’ll also be pretty worn out by this point so trying not to pack too much in. I’d be grateful for feedback on my (possibly ill-planned) itinerary. Is the time in Carlingford a mistake?

12/30: Arrive in Dublin. Pick up rental car. Staying at Hotel Morgan. Pub lunch, wander Temple Bar. National Museum of Archeology, Pickle for dinner.

12/31: Coffee at Mantle. Check out. Tesco for supplies. Drive to cottage stay in Carlingford. Carlingford town, Carlingford castle. Mild ramble if weather allows. Cozy night by the fireplace.

1/1: Relaxing day. Howth Head walk, wandering, reading by the fire. Cook at home.

1/2: Check out. Brú na Bóinne Visitor Centre. Lunch in Birr. Leap Castle! Stay at Kinnitty Castle. Dinner at hotel. 

1/3: Breakfast at hotel, check out. Clonmacnoise (if time allows). Arrive in Dublin, stow bags at hotel (Dylan Hotel). Guinness Storehouse. Grafton St shopping. Spice bag dinner. Pub?

Hi everyone,

I wanted to share RSAI, a passion project I’ve been pouring my attention into the past few days.

It started as a simple idea: I wanted to create an experience that I would actually want to use myself—something that felt authentic and fun without the corporate bloat. I’ve spent countless hours refining the design and flow, fueled entirely by coffee and a genuine love for the concept.

In a world where everything seems to require a subscription or has hidden fees, I made a strict rule for RSAI: it is completely free. There are no ads to skip, no premium tiers, no data selling, and no paywalls blocking features. I’m not doing this for profit; I built this because I wanted it to exist, and I want as many people as possible to experience it.

It’s live right now. If you have a moment, I’d be honored if you gave it a try. I’m just looking for honest feedback and hoping to find others who enjoy it as much as I enjoyed making it.

Thanks for checking it out!",1,1764012096.0,RSAI,0,1.0,False

How do I recreate this?!

Right now she decides when and if she wants to pay attention, and as soon as there is any kind of distraction starts jerking the leash, not responding to her name etc. Do I need a higher value treat to work with her?

1p5q8pd,https://www.reddit.com/r/Advice/comments/1p5q8pd/my_29m_gf_28f_left_an_event_without_saying/,My (29m) gf (28f) left an event without saying goodbye to me.,"I want to begin my saying my gf has C-PTSD and social anxiety. She is seeing a therapist. This isn't where the story begins, but it will be for now.
At friendsgiving, my gf made everyone wait for her arrival to eat. she came an hr later and we ate, she sat down looking visibly uncomfortable and texted me saying ""why didn't you tell me there were going to be this many people here"" and said she was uncomfortable. She knew everyone there except for one person (total of 8 people including me). My friend to my left asked if he should say hi but later felt scared to because of her demeanor. i tried comforting her by rubbing her leg and holding her but it wasn't working. My friend asked her if she wants anything to eat and she said no and put on her airpods. I thought that was extremely rude. Then, I tried comforting her again and she angrily said to leave her alone. Then she asked for her jacket and left without saying bye to me. My friend asked her if she wanted a plate to bring home while she was putting on her coat, she said no and walked out. This left the room feeling strange. My friend of 25 years went out to smoke a cigarette and I went out with him and he was telling me I need to break up with her. I think I've made the decision to but I don't know how to do it. We've been together for 5 years, and this isn't the first time she's done something like this. I think this has happened about 5 times now. When I mean ""this"" I mean her getting up and leaving gatherings without saying bye to me or relatives or friends.

 I understand she has social anxiety, but she hasn't been working on this with her therapist. I asked her if she got home safe and she didn't reply to me. So, I didn't message her yesterday and we were supposed to hang out. Then, she messages me at 12:38pm saying ""yup. I'm staying home. enjoy your day ✌🏽"" me and my two friends, the one who was scared to say hi and another friend that was at the gathering, went to get coffee to talk it over. At first, my friend who was sitting further away during the event was trying to defend my gf but then ended up also agreeing that I have to break up. My friend who's house we were at for the event who asked my gf if she wanted food, normally always would try to make me see my gfs side but even she texted me that she's not the right fit for me at this point, that she isn't fair to me, and takes me for granted.

 I asked for space through text after she texted me the thing to enjoy my day and she said sounds good. She later texted me at 10:44pm accusing me of turning on my read receipts on purpose to make her feel bad and that I purposely was trying to make her break and text me, and that by doing so i'm manipulative. I told her it's because I switched over to Google chat and turned on the RCS chat feature, and told her it turns on read receipts by default and then turned it off. I also respectfully told her that I need more space and thanked her. I'm not sure if I should message her today. She has abandonment issues and I don't want to traumatize her, but I need to put my mental health first because I haven't been for the longest time. Our early relationship was marked rife with a lot of abuse that I endured from her emotionally. It should've been my first sign to leave, but I didn't because I loved her too much. The most bizarre part is that I'm training to become a therapist and I'm coming to realize that if I can't burden this pain, I won't be able to effectively help my clients.

 I want to break up, but this is the most difficult thing I've ever had to do. I told my own therapist that the only thing holding me back is how much I'd miss her and how her family life is horrible and that I'd feel bad for her. He pretty much checked me but I just buried the feelings deep down because I know those are very poor reasons. I have to journal and self-reflect a lot. Even now, I feel alone taking this space but I've been listening to music and am trying to come to terms that this chapter in my life is ending. It's hard to not hate myself for letting this happen to me for this long, but our relationship wasn't all bad. Just not healthy, ever. I appreciate her for suggesting that I find a therapist after the first year we started dating. I know she felt immense sorrow and regret for the way she treated me at the beginning of our relationship, so I guess that's also another reason why I forgave her. I tried breaking up with her in 2023 after an incident where she started yelling at me in my car, throwing things around, and banging on my dashboard, which made me fear for my safety. This was due to an event that actually had to do with a previous friendsgiving. My friend changed the date and I didn't tell my gf right away which made her believe that no one wanted her there. She threw her arms around me and pleaded me to stay, and I caved. I'm afraid of that happening again. I'm still taking space from her right now and haven't messaged her. I'm lost and hurt. My friends think it's bizarre that she accused me of being manipulative and hasn't even apologized yet. But she has a pattern of never taking accountability.",2,1764011780.0,Advice,1,1.0,False

Heavily inspired by Gabriel Garcia Marquez, Laura Esquivel and Isabell Allende. A fusion of Mexican and Filipino cultures. 

**RED ELEPHANT**  
**Chapter 1**

Eduardo sat at the *kabisera* of the table. It has always been that way. Lore dictates that only the head of the household, usually the patriarch, is the one who is supposed to sit at that side of the table. It was a hot seat to Lucia. *Never sit there, you don’t deserve it yet,* she always told herself. She deserved to sit on it, alright, but she didn’t know that she was not ready to see what the chair would reveal to her. On regular days, Eduardo sat at the *kabisera* every breakfast and dinner time. Breakfast was strictly at 5:00 in the morning, dinner at around 7:00 at night when he gets home from a whole day’s work. He usually ate with Ofelia in the morning, sitting on his right-hand side. Lucia joins them every dinner at 7:00 in the evening, on his left-hand side. No one sat on the other side of the table. He had the perfect view of the small garden they had surrounding the house walls; the portals he had to see his deceased brothers.

Eduardo was the fifth child in a family of seven. He was very close to his mother and assumed responsibility over his siblings ever since. He survived four of his siblings; three of them, younger than him. Lucia barely saw her father cry. She could only recall him crying twice—when her *lola* passed, and when her *Tito* Hernando, the youngest of the siblings, passed.

“I promised *nanay* I’ll take care of him.”, he said, sitting at the *kabisera.* It was dinner, at that time, it was only Eduardo and Lucia. She didn’t know how to comfort her father. She watched him break down. His eyes were red, his words were few, and his sobs were endless. He stayed that way for months. One day, he went for breakfast. Lucia joined him this time.

“*Kamusta, papa?”*, she checked up on him. He smiled at her and looked towards the garden across the table.

“I’m better now, thank you, baby. I’m also happy because your *tito* Gregorio paid us a visit today.” Lucia froze. Gregorio had died a year ago, before Hernando. Eduardo affixed his gaze at the garden. He smiled and lifted his cup of coffee.

“Nice seeing you, brother!”, he said. Lucia followed his gaze. A tall figure stood in the garden, wearing a brown *barong Tagalog* over black slacks. His face was obscured, the figure towering so high it nearly touched the awning. Eduardo noticed the fear in her eyes. “No need to be scared, my dearest. It’s my brother. He’s been visiting me since Hernando passed. He can accompany you, too, if you need guidance.” Lucia didn’t know how to refuse her father. She said nothing.

From that morning on, Gregorio’s figure followed her. She saw him at the top of the stairs on the way to her homeroom class, the mirror at the girls’ bathroom, and even beside her teacher while lectures are being given. Whenever her father would walk through their doors on the way to the dinner table after coming home from work, she would see Gregorio’s figure following him. When he was alive, he was just as tall as Eduardo. In death, he was impossibly tall; so tall that Lucia can only see up to his chin. Never his face. When Eduardo takes a seat at the *kabisera,* Gregorio’s figure walks past the *sala,* and walks through the wall and assumes his position at the garden. She stopped being afraid of the idea of being followed—until she started being followed by two.   

“Really, *tito?* You bring a child with a machete with you?”, Lucia blurted out loud. She knew well that she would get no response from Gregorio’s figure but the presence of another figure distracted her. She only saw small sandals crossing the middle of the feet, white pants cinched at the ankle, a red sash tied around the waist. A flash of a sleeve. Tiny arms. One hand clutched a machete. She assumed it was a little boy. Gregorio’s figure never held the boy by the hand. The boy was never still. He kept running around, always in play. “Can you please slow down? You’re getting me dizzy”, Lucia tried to talk to the boy. It drove her crazy. She felt responsible for him, like how her nanny used to chase her as a little girl. “I know we’re not walking the same world,” she said one day, “but could you *please* be careful with that?” She spoke to both spirits with boldness, knowing they wouldn’t answer. One day, the boy stopped. He turned left, then right, as if checking whether the coast was clear.

“Finally! You tired out too, huh?” Lucia approached the boy slowly, not to drive him away. She dared to reach for his hand knowing that her hand would just pass through. The boy’s hand was warm flesh. She gasped. He snatched his hand back, and to Lucia’s horror, he screamed—

“Fuegooooo!”, he was commanding Toro, his cousin and playfellow, to fire towards the other camp using his makeshift wooden rifle. Machete in hand, Rojo chopped through the thick branches of the centennial sycamore at the foot of the hill not far away from his home. The two boys have been spending their afternoons running through tallgrass and rolling down hills with prickly cacti. Today, Toro fell on a huge bed of cacti, twelve spines pierced through his arm and legs. Rojo had to pick them out one by one, topping each open would off with aloe vera he picked up from nearby.

“Let’s go home and pretend that nothing happened. I don’t want abuela to flip”, Toro instructed Rojo. The latter agreed knowing that *Miercoles* is the day Tia Santita makes tamales. He’s been craving for some for days on end by now and nothing would stop the boy from getting them hot.

“¡Ay, chamacos! ¿Pues en dónde andaban metidos todo el santo día, eh?” Abuela has been waiting for them the whole day. *Miedra,* Rojo thought to himself. *No tamales for me today.* He could feel his stomach rumbling, as if he was saying goodbye to the hunger for hot tamales he would not be able to fulfill for the day. Toro started crying at the sight of abuela by the door, chancla in hand. She walked up the two boys and noticed the marks on Toro’s body.

“Here’s clear evidence that you’ve been out doing dangerous things again! Those look like pricks from cactus spines—do you want to die, Toro? And YOU, Rojo, you’re running around with your machete? Unsupervised?” At this point, Toro was anticipating that hit from a *chancla*. He decided to cry hysterically before he gets smacked on his bottom.

“Tata, no te enojones por favor. Perdoname.” Toro wailed as if he already got hurt. Instead of asking for forgiveness just like Toro, Rojo’s eyes were fixed on the kitchen. He could smell the freshly made tamales from where he stood. He could see the hem of Tia Santita’s skirt hitting the doorway as she pranced around the kitchen. Abuela was not pleased with Rojo’s inattentiveness.

“Rojo, the next time I see you bringing that machete beyond the compound, I’ll take it from you and bury it in the backyard. As for you, señorito Arturo, go to your room. I’ll treat your pricks and will just bring you food after.” She was stern yet compassionate, and she knew this time was not the time to be rigid. Tia Santita stepped out of the kitchen with a plate in hand.

“Rojito lindo, you must be hungry! I have your favorite tamales and some rice and beans on the side for you. Come, I’ll set it up on the table for you.” Tia Santita walked on the peaks of two mountains—youth and wisdom.  At the tender age of 30, she was young enough to live life freely in technicolor under her terms, but old enough to be wise beyond her years. She has been travelling all around the world and has seen more than her whole family have ever seen collectively. Whenever she was in town, she’d make Rojo really good food. Some, traditional dishes from home, and some, new recipes and flavors that she learned from where she’s been most recently.

“You know, Rojecito, I was just in Asia weeks ago. It’s a melting pot of flavors! Tomorrow I’m trying to make some *pad thai—*a noodle dish from Thailand. It has bean sprouts and fried tofu and shrimp in it. I’d have to sacrifice ceviche tomorrow to cook some shrimp for it. I got some fresh coconuts, too, I’ll make you some of that ice cream they eat off the shell!” Rojo did not pay much mind to the cooking plans his tia was laying out for him. Nothing else mattered now except for his hot tamales, rice, and refried beans with an abundance of cotija.

“Is there some more for me, tia?” Uriel, Rojo’s younger brother, peeped through the doorway with mud-dipped feet and strokes of dirt all over. Unlike Abuela, Tia Santita giggled.

“Uriel, where have you been today? Why are you so dirty?” The four-year-old wiped tears off his eyes.

“Please don’t tell abuela. I just wanted to give Gorda a hug, but she ran away, and I fell into the mud.”

“Gorda…the pig?”, Rojo found it silly. Uriel felt teased and gave into crying. He stuck his tongue out towards his brother and ran to tia Santita. He got mud on all over her, but she did not mind.

“There, there, chulo. Let me clean you up. Rojo, when you’re done eating, wash the dishes and leave them to dry, si?” She swooped Uriel with her right arm and carried the wooden hamper on her left. She’s way stronger than the typical woman. Probably the reason why she isn’t married yet.",1,1764011730.0,WritersGroup,0,1.0,False

1p5q7km,https://www.reddit.com/r/Healthguidance/comments/1p5q7km/i_tested_5_wallmounted_space_heaters_so_you_dont/,I tested 5 wall-mounted space heaters so you don't have to - Here's what actually works,"Spent months testing wall-mounted heaters from Amazon in my freezing home office. The Dreo WH517S ($70-90) is the quietest, Heat Storm Phoenix ($120-150) is worth the premium if you want infrared, and ROVSUN ($55-70) is surprisingly solid for the price. Full breakdown below.

So this is embarrassing, but last January I was literally wearing a winter coat while working from home. My office is a converted garage, and despite running the central heat 24/7, my feet were still freezing. My electricity bill hit $300+ that month and I nearly cried.

I tried those portable tower heaters first - you know the ones. They worked okay but took up half my floor space, my dog kept knocking them over, and I was constantly unplugging them to vacuum. That's when I discovered wall-mounted heaters existed and honestly it changed my life.

# Here's what I learned after living with these for months:

**1.** [**Dreo Smart WH517S - The Bedroom Hero**](https://www.bestfindown.in/best-wall-mounted-space-heater/)

This thing is *quiet*. Like 44 decibels quiet - I measured it with a meter because I'm a nerd. I'm a super light sleeper and barely notice it running. The app actually works well (rare for smart home stuff), and the Alexa integration is flawless.

Mounted it in my bedroom and the adjustable louvers let you aim the heat exactly where you want. Only downside - it's wall-mount only, no floor option.

Best for: Anyone who needs quiet operation or wants solid smart features

**2.** [**Heat Storm Phoenix**](https://www.bestfindown.in/best-wall-mounted-space-heater/) **- The Premium Option That's Actually Worth It**

Okay this one's pricier ($120-150) but there's a reason it has 17,000+ reviews. It uses infrared instead of traditional heating, so you feel warm almost immediately. The big deal though? The grill is cool to touch even when it's running full blast.

I put this in my bathroom and it's perfect. You can literally put your hand on it without burning yourself - huge if you have kids or pets. The heat feels more natural too, like sitting in sunlight instead of that dry stuffy feeling.

Also if you mount it over an outlet, you can hide the cord inside the unit which looks super clean.

Best for: Bathrooms, anyone with kids/pets, people who want the safest option

**3.** [**GiveBest WiFi** ](https://www.bestfindown.in/best-wall-mounted-space-heater/)**- The Daily Driver**

This is what I use in my office every day. The WiFi control seemed gimmicky at first but I'm sold now - I turn it on from bed before getting up, and by the time I stumble to my office with coffee it's already warm.

Three modes (high, low, ECO), and that ECO mode is genuinely good for keeping costs down. It auto-adjusts once you hit your target temp instead of constantly blasting. Remote works great too.

Installation took me about 20 min and I'm not handy at all. Can also sit on the floor if you're renting.

Best for: Home offices, anyone who wants smart features without premium price

**4.** [**MEPTY with Towel Rack**](https://www.bestfindown.in/best-wall-mounted-space-heater/) **- The Clever Bathroom Solution**

This one's genius - it's a heater WITH a built-in towel rack. Sounds weird but trust me, having a pre-warmed towel after a shower in winter is amazing. Guests always comment on it.

IP24 waterproof rated so it's specifically bathroom-safe. The ECO mode is smart - kicks into low when temp drops 4°F, high when it drops 8°F. Keeps the bathroom comfortable without constantly running full blast.

Can wall mount or use freestanding. Has child lock which is nice if you have button-pushing toddlers.

Best for: Bathrooms, anyone who wants the towel warming feature

**5.** [**ROVSUN**](https://www.bestfindown.in/best-wall-mounted-space-heater/) **- The Budget Champion**

Under $70 and honestly punches above its weight. Uses quartz infrared so you get that direct comfortable warmth. 1500W is plenty for my 140 sq ft garage workshop.

No WiFi but I don't miss it - remote works fine. Three modes (low, high, ECO), digital display is clear, temp adjustable 50-90°F. Quieter than expected at under 45 decibels.

Can wall mount or use as floor unit. Build quality feels solid, nothing fancy but nothing cheap either. Only has 600 reviews but they're mostly positive.

Best for: Garages, workshops, anyone on a budget who doesn't need smart features

# Things I Wish Someone Told Me Before:

**Electrical stuff:** These are all 1500W = 12.5 amps. I kept tripping my office breaker because I also had a space heater and laser printer on the same circuit. Don't be like me.

**Room size:** They're rated for 150-200 sq ft but work best around 150 with good insulation. My 200 sq ft living room with old windows? Struggled. My 140 sq ft office? Perfect.

**Mount high:** Put these 6-8 inches below ceiling. I mounted my first one too low and all the heat went straight up. Higher = better heat distribution.

**WiFi reality check:** Smart features are cool but not essential. My garage heater has zero smart features and works great. Think about if you'll actually use app control before paying extra.

# My honest take:

These won't replace your main heating system, but for targeted heating they're incredible. My heating bill dropped noticeably, each room can be its own temp, and no more moving space heaters around.

If I had to pick one: **Dreo for bedrooms** (quiet!), **Heat Storm for bathrooms** (safety + infrared feels great), **ROVSUN if you're on a budget** (seriously good value).

I now have three of these installed and winter is way more bearable. Plus my dog can't knock them over anymore which is a win.",1,1764011712.0,Healthguidance,0,1.0,False

For me, it was getting caught in a sudden rainstorm in a small Portuguese village.

They didn't speak English, and I didn't speak Portuguese, but we shared pastries and laughed for an hour. It was pure, human connection.

1p5q0nl,https://www.reddit.com/r/kia/comments/1p5q0nl/warning_messages_daw_makes_me_regret_buying_a_kia/,"Warning messages, DAW makes me regret buying a KIA","I'll start off by saying that every other way the car works perfectly and is a fantastic car for family, I'm just getting more and more frustrated by the tech, don't expect anyone to read through it, I just need to rant. All of the problems could be fixed with an update, but can't see it happening. 

Bought a pre facelift 2025 Sportage. EU spec, diesel, awd and fully loaded. It's great, cooled seats keep my bum cool in the summer, awd works great in the snow, kid loves the panoramic roof, and it's diesel engine is pretty fuel efficient (I get around 5.7-6 l/100km on average). 

However, the constant warnings want me to drive the car off the nearest cliff - 
1)First, and the most frustrating - the ""Consider taking a break"" warning that you can't turn off. I live outside a city with narrow country roads. About 10km radius around the place I live the roads are narrow enough that there are no middle line on the road. Every time another car drives past me in opposite direction we have to drive over the lines on the side of the road. However the Sportage takes that as if I'm not paying attention and gives the ""Consider taking a break"" message followed by 5-10 seconds of beeping (extra fun if your kid just managed to fall asleep during the drive and then it starts beeping). Even though I have been driving less than 10 minutes, it already recommends a coffee break.
Then when its been snowing and the car isn't really sure about the difference between snow and road markings - ""Consider taking a break"" warning every few minutes.
 Roadworks and you have to cross some lanes? ""CONSIDER TAKING A BREAK"". FUCK OFF WHY CAN'T I TURN THAT FEATURE OFF??????

2)""Camera error or blockage"". Fine warning in by itself. Problem comes when on snowy/rainy weather the camera is obviously blocked by water/snow. Show me the message once, but once the message pops up on my cluster (where the revs are normally shown) and I click OK to clear the message, it always just pops back up after 5 seconds. Why is some raindrop on parking camera so important that I need to see the huge orange error message on my 2 hour 120 km/h highway drive where I obviously aren't using the parking camera? Why isn't clearing the message enough and it needs to always be in your face until you stop the car, go to the back of the car and clean the camera, which is also pointless if it's raining and the camera gets obstructed immediately after taking off again - thus getting the same fucking warning again?

3)Not as much an issue as it's a feature I'm rarely using but it's making long highway drives a bit more relaxing. At least it should. Lane keep assist, works great otherwise, but when driving on a perfectly straight long road, always keeping hands on steering wheel, you still get ""Keep hands on steering wheel warning"" every 10 second. So on perfectly straight road you have to just slightly turn the wheel to make the message go away. 

Kia already fixed the turning off speed sign reading by adding a shortcut of pressing mute button for 3 sec. Annoying that it resets every time you turn off the car, but the fix made it soooo much better by not having to scroll menus every time I start the car. I don't mind the car warning me on speed limits, but KIAs system is waaaaay too sensitive - even 1 km/h over the limit and it keeps beeping at you. Also beeping every time a new speed limit is spotted (again annoying since there are 6(!) different speed zones during the first 2-3 minutes of my every morning drive (10->50->30 in front of a school->50->70->90).

So why oh why can't they fix the DAW system by giving it a way to just disable it. I read that it can be turned off on Sportages pre 2024. 

Rant over

TL;DR: Warnings that you cant turn off makes me want to drive the car to the bottom of a lake and never even fart in another KIA.

1p5px4b,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskLosAngeles/comments/1p5px4b/puppy_playdates_in_hollywood/,Puppy playdates in Hollywood?,"Hi! I'm in town visiting a friend who has mobility issues due to Lyme disease.  To complicate her situation further, her longtime caretaker had to have unexpected surgery and will be unable to return to her old position (which is why I'm here, to help her get organized and find a replacement).  

My friend took in an adorable - and super smart - rescue puppy, a terrier, in late April, that needs some training and socialization.  (Before anyone judges her for taking in a puppy, please understand that it was a rescue and having this puppy has been a godsend for her emotional and mental wellbeing given that she's homebound...).  

While her puppy is SUPER friendly the sweetest little dude ever, he's afraid of so many things and it's hard to get him out of and away from the house for too long.  We don't know what happened to him prior to his rescue, but he has some triggers that we are slowly working through.  

She has hired a trainer to teach him such basic manners and does have a dog walker that takes him down the block (but that's as far as he'll go) in the morning, but money is tight for her given that she's self employed and has the added cost of medical bills and medication, and he's just not getting enough exercise or attention with this limited set-up.

At any rate, his fears/ triggers makes the dog park and other type of doggy playdate situations tough.  As I said, we're working through these things...but it takes time. My friend has a few friends with older dogs, but they have limited tolerance for his puppy energy.  Since I've been here for the past month, I've been spending a good amount of time with him in the fenced in front yard area of her duplex so that he can greet the neighbors and enjoy an impromptu playdate with whatever friendly dog that happens to pass by.  He loves being outside and it's easy to just enjoy a coffee or whatever while watching him play.  

I'm leaving at the end of next week, and I thought it would be nice to reach out and see if there are people in the area with well behaved dogs and/or high energy puppies who might like to arrange a playdate? If the dogs hit it off,  the fenced in area works for you and your four legged best friend, and you'd like to help a very sweet woman with special needs, maybe you can a visit/playdate an ongoing or regular thing? Who knows, it could work for someone who wants to socialize their dog and do something for someone else without having to make the trek to a dog park?

Ideally, it would be someone close by.  She lives on Hollywood Blvd. between Fairfax and LaBrea.  

I would feel so much better to know that my friend not only has a new caretaker, but that her sweet little pup is getting the exercise and socialization he needs.  Please reach out to me with any questions and let's see what we can work out!

Thanks for taking the time to read this!

I am based on the east coast but am a frequent business traveler to SF, coming to town monthly for 4-5 day stints including some weekend stopovers.  I will next be in town Dec 3-7.  I can host in my upscale downtown hotel.

I’m here often enough that I’d like to find a local connection - something easy and without strings.  I’d love to find someone I can be flirty and playful with.  I’d love to grab coffee or a cocktail, or enjoy a dinner date.  Maybe check out a weekend market or go on a hike? 

Something fun where we can hang out, flirt, and see where things go without feeling forced or rushed.  I’m someone who likes to build playful tension and release it explosively when the time’s right.

Physically: I am tall (6ft4 - come climb me like a tree!) and in decent shape.  I’m no gym rat but I do regular bootcamp style exercises.  I’m handsome and well put together.  I am well endowed but won’t assault your eyes with unwelcome anatomical photographs.  

Personality: I’m an educated professional, normal, sane, and respectful of your time and your boundaries.  I’m kind, easy-going, funny, and quick to smile.  I’m playful and flirty.

Interests: Outside of work I’m a traveler who takes several international trips every year. I’ve visited over forty countries and love being outside of my element. I am an experienced home chef and love spending time in the kitchen. I hike and bike. I love drinking bourbon next to a campfire.

Bedroom stuff: I am drug, drama, and disease free and ask that you be also - especially the drama and disease part.  I’m 420 friendly.  I’m not too concerned about your personal situation, we’re all adults here and I’m not looking to be indiscreet with whatever you may have sensitivities about.

I’m into both vanilla connections and kinky ones. I am very sex positive and kink-friendly, so articulate your needs and curiosities without hesitation or shame. I try to be a walking safe space, respectful of boundaries. I get the most sexual satisfaction from my partner having a great time.

However, creating an effective study plan isn’t easy — if it were, every student would get straight As. It can be especially challenging when juggling competing responsibilities, such as caring for your family or studying a double degree.

Luckily, you’re not doomed to poor grades or late-night cramming sessions. With the right strategies and a little practice, you can develop good study habits and improve your academic performance. Here are 10 good study habits to help you ace your next exam.

# 1. Learn How to Take Notes During Class

You’ve probably heard your professors lecturing about the importance of studying, especially in the weeks leading up to a major test. But what are good study habits, and how can you gain them?

It all starts with taking quality notes during class. Think of these resources like a blueprint — the more detailed and thorough your notes, the easier it will be to build your knowledge.

You might assume you should scribble down everything the professor says, but that’s not the most productive approach. Instead, focus on capturing key concepts and making connections between ideas.

Sketchnoting is one of the most effective and fun note-taking strategies. It combines hand-drawn pictures and text to record key information. You might draw doodles to represent critical concepts and use arrows to connect related ideas. This approach can help you retain information more easily. For example, if you need to remember the structure of an atom, you can visualize the illustration you drew in your notes.

If you’d prefer to use text for all your notes, consider the Cornell method. This system involves dividing a piece of paper into three sections, as illustrated above:

* **Cue column** for main ideas or questions that help organize your ideas
* **Note-taking area** for bullet points, diagrams, and other detailed info
* **Summary area** where you explain the “big picture” of your notes

No matter which method you choose, create a backup of your notes. You can take a photo of handwritten notes or upload digital ones to the cloud. That way, you won’t have to worry about losing them before your study sessions.

# 2. Use Spaced Repetition and Take Practice Tests

Movies often show college students pulling all-nighters before a test, but resist the urge. Trying to cram everything at once will only leave you exhausted and stressed — not how you want to feel before a major exam.

Instead, use spaced repetition to master your study material without burning out. This evidence-based technique involves reviewing information at different intervals to improve attention and retention. For example, you might study every other day for a week, then once a week during the month leading up to a test.

Practice tests are another excellent way to reinforce what you’ve learned. Many websites offer free quizzes on every subject imaginable, or you can create them yourself using platforms like Typeform or Quiz Maker. These active learning techniques will help you find gaps in your knowledge, so you can fill them before the real test.

# 3. Manage Focus and Take Breaks

Every great study routine includes regular breaks. According to a 2022 meta-analysis, resting for even ten minutes can improve focus and reduce fatigue.

You may feel tempted to scroll through Instagram or TikTok during your break, but don’t get sucked into the social media vortex. Instead, avoid screens and give yourself a quick mental reset. For example, you could take a short walk to soak up the sunlight or enjoy a snack. When you return, you’ll feel refreshed and ready to hit the books again.

# 4. Prioritize High-Intensity Focus Sessions

Pacing is key to building good study habits. Short, highly focused study sessions are typically more effective than long, boring ones.

If you need help creating a productive study routine, consider using the Pomodoro technique. The concept is simple: Set a timer for 25 minutes, then take a 5-minute break. After you repeat these intervals four times, reward yourself with a longer break of 15 to 30 minutes. This method will help you strike the right balance between active studying and rest.

# 5. Eliminate Distractions

Let’s face it: It’s easy to get sidetracked while studying, especially if you’re looking for excuses to procrastinate. Maybe you keep glancing at your phone, or a family member interrupts you. Before you know it, you’re unfocused and can’t remember anything you’ve been studying.

Avoid this issue by eliminating distractions. Leave your phone and smartwatch in another room, and ask your family to respect your study time. Headphones or a white noise machine can also block out disruptive noises.

# 6. Organize a Conducive Study Space

Establishing a study place is essential to developing a good study plan. If you prefer to study from home, set up a desk and add lighting to help you focus. If you’d rather go out, look for quiet coffee shops and libraries.

Of course, a study space isn’t just a specific location; it’s also a state of mind. Avoid studying when you’re in a bad mood, and make sure you have a set amount of time without interruptions from other life commitments.

# 7. Create a Structured Study Schedule and Goals

Set yourself up for success by creating a study schedule. Use a calendar to block out specific times to work on each class and stick to your plan. This schedule should be feasible, so don’t say you’ll study for 10 hours every day.

You should also use the [SMART framework](https://www.texashumanities.org/wp-content/uploads/sites/108/2021/03/nc-smart-goals-fact-sheet.pdf) to create goals that are:

* Specific
* Measurable
* Achievable
* Realistic
* Time-relevant

Goal setting allows you to plan and focus your time to study more efficiently. As you achieve small wins, you’ll feel more motivated to keep studying.

# 8. Find a Study Buddy or Organize Study Groups

Studying is always more engaging when you have a study buddy! Studying with a friend can help keep you motivated and on track. It also helps to have someone you can bounce ideas off and ask questions. Sometimes just having someone available to offer a different perspective can help you remember something more easily.

This step can also help you navigate group work as an online learner. Schedule regular Teams or Zoom meetings to work together and resolve any issues.

# 9. Master Task Prioritization and Time Management

Time management is critical for creating good study habits. Schedule your study sessions for your most productive periods, such as the morning or after your kids go to bed.

If you’re not sure where to start, use the Eisenhower matrix to prioritize your to-do list. It divides tasks into four categories:

* Urgent and important
* Not urgent but important
* Urgent but not important
* Not urgent and not important

Free up more time for studying by delegating or ignoring tasks that are unimportant and not urgent.

# 10. The Importance of Rewarding and Taking Care of Yourself

As you work on gaining effective study habits, don’t forget to take time for self-care. According to a 2024 study, getting adequate sleep and staying hydrated can improve cognitive performance and mood. Eating a healthy diet also helps you stay energized and focused.",1,1764010787.0,CollegePulse,0,1.0,False

I made myself coffee that was *way* too strong, but it somehow matched the vibe of the day  a little chaotic but energizing.

I spent a few minutes just sitting by the window, scrolling, thinking, people-watching, pretending I’m the main character or whatever. The weather wasn’t doing anything special, but it felt comforting in that quiet, background-movie way.

The rest of the day was just… normal. A couple of small tasks, a little overthinking (my toxic trait), and one random burst of motivation that came out of nowhere and disappeared just as fast. But I still got a few things done, so I’m calling that a win.

But the truth is far less glamorous: late-night studying turns your brain into something between mashed potatoes and airplane mode.

After midnight, cognitive functions drop sharply - memory weakens, attention scatters, and logical thinking becomes unreliable. You’re basically trying to learn while your brain is quietly whispering, “Please… let me rest…” No amount of Red Bull can fix biology.

The funny part? Many students believe they work better at night simply because the world is quieter. But your brain at 1 a.m. is not a genius - it’s a tired toddler holding a marker and making questionable life choices.

You’ll learn faster, retain more, and feel less miserable if you shift part of that late-night workload to earlier hours. Even better: take a 20-minute nap when your energy crashes. Short naps have been proven to restore alertness, boost memory, and improve mood. They are the opposite of those desperate 3-hour “accidental naps” where you wake up disoriented and unsure what year it is

Here’s a better formula:  
Study in focused blocks during the day → rest → lighter review in the evening → sleep → wake up and finish faster than you ever would at night.

Your brain resets during sleep. Information is literally sorted and stored while you’re dreaming. When you sacrifice rest, you sabotage the very process that helps you learn.

Night studying isn’t heroic - it’s inefficient. Good sleep is not a luxury; it’s the fuel your academic life runs on.

Whether you’re an incoming student or a rising senior, incorporating these seven daily habits into your routine can help you succeed in college and beyond.

# The Importance of Daily Habits 

College is hectic. Between juggling classes, friends, clubs, and maybe even a part-time job, it’s easy to get overwhelmed. That’s where daily habits come in. They create a routine that helps you stay focused, manage stress, and maximize your college experience.  

Additionally, adopting daily habits in college and setting goals sets the stage for professional success. Positive habits ensure you can meet deadlines and efficiently handle projects—skills that transition seamlessly from academic settings to professional environments. Thus, the routines you establish in college don’t just serve immediate academic needs; they lay a foundational framework for thriving in your future professional life, making the transition smoother and more manageable.

# 1. Kick-Start Your Day with a Morning Routine.

Your morning routine sets the tone for your entire day. Find a routine that energizes you and prepares you for what lies ahead. Experiment with different activities to discover what works best for you. Whether enjoying a quiet cup of coffee, engaging in a short workout, or practicing mindfulness, a consistent morning ritual can significantly improve your overall well-being and productivity.

*Here is an example of a healthy morning routine:*

7 a.m.: Wake up and make your bed. 

7:15 a.m.: Shower and follow a skincare regiment.

7:45 a.m.: Write down three affirmations and do some light stretching. 

8 a.m.: Enjoy a high-protein, low-carbohydrate breakfast.

# 2. Set and Adjust Your Goals Regularly.

As you progress through your academic journey, it’s common to question the significance of the degree you’re pursuing. However, setting specific, measurable, achievable, relevant, and time-bound (SMART) goals can give you a clear sense of direction and purpose. These goals will motivate you to take on new challenges and equip you with the necessary skills for life after graduation. It’s essential to break down larger goals into smaller, manageable steps to avoid feeling overwhelmed. Additionally, it’s perfectly acceptable to adjust your goals as your priorities and circumstances change—after all, success is not a straight line!

If you need help defining your goals, consider visiting your college’s career center. The career advisers there are dedicated professionals who can provide valuable assistance in setting and refining your goals. They can offer personalized guidance based on your strengths, interests, and career aspirations. 

# 3. Cultivate Self-Discipline for Balance.

It’s crucial to find a balance between attending lectures, allocating substantial study hours, and ensuring time for socializing, hobbies, and relaxation. Developing self-discipline is imperative in achieving academic excellence and maintaining personal well-being. It involves establishing boundaries, prioritizing responsibilities, and making decisions that align with your academic and personal goals. 

One effective strategy is to create organized schedules and identify key priorities for each week, allowing for a structured and balanced approach to managing your time.

# 4. Prioritize Physical and Mental Health.

College life can be stressful, so it’s essential not to neglect your physical and mental well-being. Prioritize self-care through regular exercise, a balanced diet, and ensuring you get enough sleep each night. Practice stress management techniques such as meditation, deep breathing, or spending time outdoors to maintain focus and peace of mind.

# 5. Practice Gratitude Daily.

Throughout life’s ups and downs, remember to show your appreciation. Keeping a gratitude journal can be exceptionally rewarding; note three things you’re grateful for daily. This simple practice can significantly enhance your outlook, help you stay grounded, and keep you focused on the positive aspects of your college journey. 

Additionally, remember to express your gratitude directly to people. A simple “thank you” to a professor, a kind word to a classmate, or a quick note to a family member can spread positivity and strengthen your relationships. Recognizing and appreciating the small victories and kindnesses in your daily life enriches your college experience and sets a solid foundation for a fulfilling life postgraduation.

# 6. Be Resourceful and Seek Help.

When you’re feeling at a loss along your academic journey, don’t hesitate to ask for help. Colleges and universities offer a wealth of resources to support your academic success. Take advantage of libraries, tutoring centers, mentorship programs, writing labs, and academic advising. 

# 7. Embrace Active Learning.

College is just the beginning of your educational journey. Cultivate a lifelong love of learning by exploring new subjects, reading widely, and seeking opportunities for personal growth. Stay curious and open-minded. A passion for learning will open doors to new experiences and possibilities.

# Integrate Habits for Long-Term Success.

Remember, making significant changes takes time. It’s essential to start with small, manageable steps and to stay committed to them consistently. Over time, you can gradually integrate these new habits into your daily routine. Your success in college will largely depend on the habits you develop and the dedication you demonstrate in nurturing your personal and academic development. ",1,1764010646.0,ExamChaos,0,1.0,False

My eyes flickered open,my throat dry,heart aching and head throbbing. I knew what happened but I didn't want to accept it. 

Let me go back. I used to be bullied. A tall,blonde girl with sharp ocean blue eyes,rosey pink lips and always wearing skimpy skirts. Her name was Maya. She always got away with bullying me. From dumping coffee on me to making me feel useless,insignificant. She was the queen bee of the school,popular,pretty,even the principal's daughter. Once....she followed me home,throwing rocks at the window like the holy terror she was! It hit my mum's head,she didn't see it coming and couldn't handle the strain of recovery....

She didn't make it...

It drew me insane. Every time I closed my eyes I could see mum. i could see my mum's sweet smile,she used to be the heart of the home,she loved me,but I could see it in her eyes. She couldn't protect me from seeing her wither away in front of her and I couldn't save her either. Every night for two months that single memory haunted me. 

So...I did it. I killed her behind the school in cold blood. I killed her and ran.However,seeing her die,seeing her get what she deserved,it felt like pulling off a tight bandage off my wound! Then,I disappeared,without a trace. No one remembered. No one wanted to remember that the sweet nerdy kid turned into a cold blooded killer. They didn't care I lost everything! They looked past it,they made me out to be the villain and that's why I became one. I became a villain as a cornered animal became the monster they feared. And then,i lost. I died and the hero won. After all,that's how the cookie crumbles or whatever those judgemental heroes say. The hero wins,the villain dies and that's the end. But it wasn't. 

Every time,the excruciating pain of death ended and i woke up again,the hero standing over me with tools saying 'I'm losing followers'. Cause in his twisted mind, losing followers was a good enough reason to keep me kept away from the sweet embrace of death. I don't even want to be the villain anymore but now....that's all people see me as, At this point,this hero simply has an ego too big to accept that if I die he becomes irrelavent.

1p5plcn,https://i.redd.it/wxgcqmgi493g1.jpeg,What is happening between them?,"Context: I have this mayor crush on this guy I see at my usual coffee place, nothing has happened but I can’t get over it to the point where I’m really sad because of my crush. A few months ago I saw him with this girl that works nearby him. I posted a chart about them then ( we established that whatever was going on between them was over). I know he’s on tinder I found him a few weeks ago. But mercury retrograde is happening and ex’s reappear. I saw her waiting outside of he’s house today. Which messed me up a bit. For sure he was waiting for him. She either got in or they left together. So I pulled a chart with the question what is happening between them. 

Interpretation: I’ve heard that when I ask about other people I’m not in the chart. But then I’ve been told that if it affects me I’m in the chart. 

I’m not sure if in this chart I’m the asc or not. Let’s say that I’m not. 

She’s the asc so the moon and he’s Saturn. She’s in his house and he’s on the 10th. I’ve never seen such a clear yes in a chart. They are in contact. Venus is applying to Saturn also moon applying to Saturn both trines. 

But it’s Mercury retrograde. Will this contact last? Is it a fling or a relationship? Saturn is retrograde so he’s going back to an ex. I see that moon likes him very much, him not so much. Saturn likes Venus. So he likes her physically but not emotionally?

1p5pjhv,https://www.reddit.com/r/dumbphones/comments/1p5pjhv/long_post_three_broken_promises_from_tech_giants/,[Long Post] Three Broken Promises from Tech Giants,"I think my latest newsletter could be helpful to some out here. Here is the newsletter in full. You can find it at this [link](https://josebriones.substack.com/p/broken-promises) as well:   
  
I don’t know if you’ve tuned into a tech keynote from a big company lately. Since the 1990s, these corporate giants have shifted from simple demos to glowing screens, cinematic staging, and ever‑rising productivity metrics, all designed to convince you to spend $1,000 or more on their gadgets. The ritual is annual: a product unveiled, images of families thriving with it, promises made. No keynote captured that promise more than the one in January 2007, when Steve Jobs walked onto the stage at Macworld San Francisco[1](https://josebriones.substack.com/p/broken-promises#footnote-1-179741882). 

He told the crowd Apple was about to introduce three revolutionary products: a widescreen iPod with touch controls, a mobile phone, and an internet communicator. He repeated the list until the audience realized these weren’t three separate devices, but one. “Are you getting it?” he asked, before revealing the iPhone.

The room erupted. Jobs promised a device that would merge the functions of an iPod and a BlackBerry, wrapped in intuitive design that opened a new world of possibilities. That presentation offers a glimpse into the three broken promises that technology has doubled down on since the advent of the personal computer.

* The first was that it would strengthen community and closeness. Instead, platforms used new tech to amplify misinformation and division.
* The second promise was that innovation would add productivity and efficiency to our lives. Instead, business models turned devices toward extracting attention and data.
* The third promise was that technology would democratize opportunity. Instead, it concentrated power in the hands of a few dominant firms.

Today, we explore how this happened and what you can do to diminish some of the effects of promises that big technologies have failed to deliver on.

# The Promise of Community and Closeness

When the house phone was introduced, it had a clear advantage: you could connect with friends and family at a distance. Advertisers highlighted how easy life would be if you owned one.[2](https://josebriones.substack.com/p/broken-promises#footnote-2-179741882) Their pitch was simple: distance no longer had to mean disconnection. A phone in the home meant you could call your mother across town, check in on children away at college, or hear the voice of a loved one serving overseas.

And for a time, that promise held. The house phone helped plan dinners, share news, or comfort a loved one. It expanded the radius of communication and served as a lifeline in emergencies. As more technologies arrived (cell phones, email, social media, instant messengers), companies carried the same promise: **that they would bring us closer.** Facebook reconnected long lost classmates. Email made you reachable even at the beach. WhatsApp let you chat in real time with friends across the world.

Then, the promise broke. Tech giants realized there was more money in pumping random information into our lives than in showing posts from friends. They turned on the algorithm, shifting their metric from providing value to users to providing value to advertisers. I remember when timelines were chronological, and I would stop scrolling once I reached the end. Catching up with friends’ activities had clear value, but afterward I returned to the offline world and connected with my community. By making feeds endless, companies doubled down. Hate and negative stories rose to the top. A pipeline of stimuli kept us tethered to platforms and apart from one another. The result was a grim outlook. Extreme voices were amplified until our brains signaled danger, pushing us into the instinct we follow when afraid: seeking comfort.

This played out in Colorado about two years ago with the Tren de Aragua gang craze.[3](https://josebriones.substack.com/p/broken-promises#footnote-3-179741882) Media amplified the narrative that a reckless group of Venezuelans was causing havoc in Aurora. Coverage kept people at home, gripped by danger, instead of encouraging communities to confront fears together. Lacking connection, advertisers swept in, selling material goods as substitutes for belonging. In the absence of closeness[4](https://josebriones.substack.com/p/broken-promises#footnote-4-179741882), consumption became the default comfort.

While real dangers exist today, we must resist turning awareness into fear of the other. As Michel Foucault observed[5](https://josebriones.substack.com/p/broken-promises#footnote-5-179741882), societies often manage uncertainty by constructing divisory lines. Governments have historically reinforced those boundaries through institutions and discourse to separate citizens and outsiders or categorize normal and deviant. In our digital age, platforms have taken up that role, using algorithms to magnify difference and stoke suspicion, turning neighbors into threats and strangers into enemies.

To confront danger without collapsing into fear, we must step into the offline world. The antidote to the broken promise of technological connection is to leave the feeds behind and organize local gatherings: a community clothing drive, a block party, or a shared meal with neighbors. Periodically, we must choose to engage with humans rather than machines[6](https://josebriones.substack.com/p/broken-promises#footnote-6-179741882).

# The Promise of Productivity and Efficiency

Ah yes. The promise most often broken by tech: the myth of productivity. This is the second area where tech companies failed us, and in my view, the most grave. When washers and dryers were first introduced, they were sold as machines that would give families back their time.[7](https://josebriones.substack.com/p/broken-promises#footnote-7-179741882) Advertisers promised hours returned to your day, time to re‑engage with the world. Not much has changed in the tech playbook. OpenAI, Slack, Microsoft, or any other company will claim their tools save time and make you free. They have failed to deliver.[8](https://josebriones.substack.com/p/broken-promises#footnote-8-179741882)

For a while, the promise seemed real. The machines did save labor. Cars got us places faster. Emails arrived instantly from across the world. But then employers swooped in and filled the gap. You saved five minutes, they gave you three more projects. Tech companies discovered that productivity was not about freeing us but about extracting more from us. More time, effort, and life. Email made workers reachable everywhere, at all hours. Project management apps turned collaboration into constant monitoring. Notifications multiplied, deadlines accelerated, and the line between work and life blurred. What began as “liberation” became obligation. Instead of giving us back time, technology demanded more of it.

We saw this clearly in the rise of remote work platforms during the pandemic. Promoted as tools to keep us efficient and connected, they often became instruments of surveillance. Every click, every login, every green dot signaling “active” was tracked. Productivity was no longer about meaningful output but about proving you were always available. The promise was broken and it delivered exhaustion. I, as many others, became zoomed out[9](https://josebriones.substack.com/p/broken-promises#footnote-9-179741882).

Philosopher Byung-Chul Han offers the clearest articulation of what the myth of productivity has delivered. He warns that we became an “achievement society” where individuals become both master and slave, driven to self‑exploit under the illusion of freedom.[10](https://josebriones.substack.com/p/broken-promises#footnote-10-179741882) As he writes, *“The complaint of the depressive individual, ‘Nothing is possible,’ can only occur in a society that thinks, ‘Nothing is impossible.’”* The very culture that promised boundless possibility has instead produced burnout, fatigue, and despair.

The antidote is not another app or upgrade. Stop thinking that a new service will make you productive. Instead, turn inward. Use your time to reflect and choose activities that give you life satisfaction.[11](https://josebriones.substack.com/p/broken-promises#footnote-11-179741882) Honor your body’s need for rest. Create space between you and the internet. Periodically, we must remind ourselves that productivity is not the highest good, and that freedom lies not in doing more, but in doing life together.

# The Promise of Opportunity

We’ve arrived at the final broken promise. With all the money in the world and the advances technology has delivered, you would think hunger would be solved or dignity guaranteed for every life. At least Billie Eilish seems to think so.[12](https://josebriones.substack.com/p/broken-promises#footnote-12-179741882) The story was that technology would level the playing field. Anyone could become whatever they wanted to be.

But tech cannot hide the human desire for greed. It masked it for a time with garage start‑ups, viral influencers, and online marketplaces for new businesses. Yet the ladder was slowly tilted. Platforms like Spotify and YouTube took the lion’s share of profits, leaving creators and workers with pennies. Gig apps like Uber or Lyft offered “flexibility” but stripped away benefits and protections. Some Amazon Flex workers even urinated in bottles during shifts to avoid skewing their “on‑time” metrics.[13](https://josebriones.substack.com/p/broken-promises#footnote-13-179741882) The rhetoric of opportunity concealed the reality of exploitation.

And since everyone is told they have “opportunities,” most governments are renuent to change their taxation schemes. Even though many heads of state know that trickle‑down economics has failed, they continue to hail it as the only path to prosperity. Gary Stevenson, a financial YouTuber, helps us see why. He argues that societies have chosen to tax work instead of wealth, squeezing ordinary families while allowing the richest to accumulate ever more. As Stevenson warns, *“If you don’t tax the rich, the rich will squeeze you out.”*[14](https://josebriones.substack.com/p/broken-promises#footnote-14-179741882) In the digital age, platforms will continue to extract value from labor and attention while shielding capital from accountability. The result is a system where the few amass fortunes simply by owning the infrastructure, while the many pay with their time, their data, and their lives.

I am no economist, but I know a solution to this broken techno-poly promise is to step away from the rat race. If surveillance capitalism has taught me anything, it is that taking ownership of my digital and financial life is the quickest way to opt out of the games companies keep us playing. Seeking alternatives and forging my own path to contentment will bring my priorities into focus far faster than chasing the “American Dream.” The less I crave outward opportunities defined by society, the easier it becomes to discover the ones that truly help me thrive.

# Conclusion

So yes. Nothing is new under the sun. Tech companies will continue to promise progress during their keynotes while many succumb to their schemes. As new digital‑first policies move through legislation[15](https://josebriones.substack.com/p/broken-promises#footnote-15-179741882), the monopoly of control will inch ever closer to the vision Orwell warned us about in *1984*.

It’s not all lost, however. *Offline* will be there. Nature will continue to call and offer free access to entertainment, reflection, and peace. The trees do not charge subscriptions. The rivers do not track your clicks. The sky does not demand your data. Your local community will also remain.

**Victor Olegovich Grauberger aka Koshchey, smuggler, somewhere in Wriss space, standardized human time September 30th 2158**



The foggy, humid weather goes deep inside my bones, but unfortunately, this jungle-covered moon sits in a blind spot for the SC sensors. They are getting increasingly aggressive recently, and after the incident with the kid and his team, Arxur troops are on edge. The situation could turn dangerous fast, and if so I’m really afraid for how things could go for the civilians in the Collective. Things get dangerous when you see your adversary as a stain to be washed.

“Koshchey, always hiding in the fog as an old ghost, are you?”

“Old trick of the trade” I say with a smile before turning around, in front of me an old friend of mine, Colonel Kekkonen, possibly the most corrupt officer of the UN fleet. I suppose that is what happens when a bunch of birds kill your wife in front of you and then your government forces you to work with them. The man is the living embodiment of the word disillusion. Fun chap though.

“What do you have for me today?” he asks,

“The usual uncut kweshua crystals for your nevok friends and their pretty wives and this”, I point to the boxes on the ground.

He pulls a bottle from it and raises a brow: “100% pure Skalgan tomato sauce?”,

“We also have ketchup, apple juice and ajvar. And a venlil expatriate has checked the spelling this time, so we shouldn’t have the problems we had last time”,

He snorts: “Right. Such a pity, with all those people struggling on Earth right now, all that food destroyed because some UN fat cat in Europe needed to show how tiny his dick is”,

“It’s easy to do that rather than disappointing their ‘friends’ by stopping exporting exotic Earth food or even worse allow the planet with the most fertile soil to trade freely” I comment cynically,

“Ehi ehi stop with that or I might think that you disagree with our noble government or that you shiver like Nazi lizards” he winks and we explode in a knowing laughter, then his face turns dark and asks: “Do you have any contact to the kid’s family, what’s his name Levente?”

“Why do you ask me that?”

“Because if you did I would tell you to inform his lawyers that for no reason they should call me to testify because I definitely don’t know anything that might upset the SC enough to approve my early retirement”. He throws me a long telling look. That gives me pause and after a moment of hesitation I decide to try a gamble, I show him my tablet with a silent question, he gets what I’m heading to.

“That could be my neck, you know? That old american bitch and her minions would suspect me immediately.”

He tugs his beard for a while before muttering: “Vittu, it’s not like I have something to lose”. I look at him and I nod, there’s no need for more words than that. I check that his side of the deal has been loaded on my ship, the Hoffen, and I wave him goodbye wondering if this is our last trade, before I close the door I hear him asking: “It was you wasn’t it? That brought his mom here”,

“Why do you think that?” I ask with a subtle smile, “Oh c’mon who could have been smuggling people here for this long aside from you?”.



**Elif Yılmaz, owner of the Little Istanbul Cafè, Wriss, standardised human time September 30th 2158**



This has been a long day, as all are recently, the worry keeps me up at night, if Levente gets condemned there is no safety for us here. He was born here, a citizen, what am I for SC law? A fugitive, a child kidnapper. I hold myself to a chair to gain strength, the kids will return from school soon. They can’t see me that way. They just stopped having nightmares.

I should have listened to my parents, when they told me not to marry him. I stupidly called them racist, said that they had prejudices. The bell on the door sounds and I barely dodge a blue ball speeding towards me, “Kratos I told you a billion times you can’t fly towards people!”,

“But I am so happy to see you mom!”,

“I told you, parrot, that you will scare her!” from the door has just emerged my daughter Miray,

“And you can’t call your brother parrot!”

“Sorry mam” they shout laughing while they rush upstairs.

Soon after, I hear a soft knock at the door, “We are closed, come back tomorrow” I shout toward the door, a beeping voice chimes in, “It’s us, Glic and Asdeth!”, I rush toward the door. A tiny thafky and an Arxur with a face creased with worry cross the threshold.

We sit down and I ask Asdeth if he has any news about his son: “They are keeping him in isolation after the story came out. I…I should have stopped him. I shouldn’t have allowed him to join the fleet, I should have protected him, after his mother…” his voice breaks.

“You raised a strong and kind young man, Asdeth. You know when I just arrived here, and I feared I made the worst decision of my life. He spent his little free time helping me sort things out and teaching the kids how to read and write in Arxur. I was afraid that Kekos especially would never settle here and now…”,

“And now he wants to be the first krakotal pilot in the Collective fleet! Can you imagine the face of the SC?” says Glic laughing,

“Or old dominionists” says Asdeth with a slight hint of a smile,

“You raised a man with kindness and spine, which is more than most human parents can claim in the last thirty years” grumbles a voice at our back.

“Victor, I see you let yourself in” I laugh,

“Well they say I am a Koshchey, don’t they? So why shouldn’t I sneak at your back?”

“Come in old fool, and what are you carrying?”, I say, noticing a bag in his arms,

“Coffee so that you will be finally an actual cafè, and I can get a cup on this God forsaken planet”,

He tells us about the meeting with his contacts and then grumbles: “It’s a disgrace what they are trying to do, they go after him so they can push the government here to expel you all. The economic crisis is eroding what little patience people had left on the old mudball and they are afraid that people will vote with their feet”,

As I hear that I start shaking, and my mind goes there, to him, shouting, pointing a flamethrower at me and the pain. I can’t, I can’t go back there, and the kids they can’t go back. In my panic I feel someone hugging me, but I can’t understand who.

1p5pi4l,https://bagbagsitter.com/blogs/news/kate-spade-vs-coach-black,Kate Spade vs Coach: Which Black Bag Is Better for Daily Use?,"Deciding on the perfect black bag can be daunting when you want reliability, style, and versatility for your daily activities. Today, we'll compare Kate Spade and Coach—two top choices for anyone seeking a trustworthy black handbag for everyday use.

[https://www.katespade.com/products/tilly-quilted-small-tote-bag/KK810.html?frp=KK810+BLK&fromSearch=black](https://www.katespade.com/products/tilly-quilted-small-tote-bag/KK810.html?frp=KK810+BLK&fromSearch=black)

## Why Black Bags Are Essential

Black bags are the ultimate staple in any wardrobe. Their versatility makes them suitable for both professional and casual settings, blending easily with various outfits. A well-chosen black bag can transition from the office to an evening out, from city errands to weekend getaways—just one reason why so many of us look for the best one for daily use.

* Black bags don’t show dirt or stains easily.
* They pair effortlessly with essentially every color palette.
* Timeless designs remain stylish year after year.
* Professional yet understated look fits multiple occasions.

With these perks in mind, it’s no wonder so many people consider adding (or updating) a black handbag in their rotation. But which brand delivers when it comes to daily practicality and elegance? Let's take a closer look.

[https://www.katespade.com/products/carter-nylon-large-backpack/KL962.html?frp=KL962+BLK&fromSearch=black](https://www.katespade.com/products/carter-nylon-large-backpack/KL962.html?frp=KL962+BLK&fromSearch=black)

## Design Aesthetics: Classic vs Contemporary

Both Kate Spade and Coach have distinct design philosophies that set their black bags apart, yet both cater to individuals seeking style combined with utility.

### Kate Spade: Modern Minimalism with a Playful Twist

Kate Spade black bags are known for their clean, structured designs, often adorned with subtle accents like gold logos or signature bows. The brand excels at marrying practicality with a hint of whimsy—think minimal hardware, thoughtfully placed pockets, and interiors lined with fun prints.

These elements result in bags that feel fresh and youthful, yet remain polished enough for daily use, whether at work or brunch. You'll often find tote bags, crossbodies, and shoulder bags that seamlessly fit essentials without becoming bulky.

### Coach: Timeless Appeal and Refined Detailing

Coach has deep roots in American leather craftsmanship. Its black bags lean toward classic silhouettes, boasting elegant lines, supple leathers, and quality hardware. Subtle branding, refined stitching, and versatile shapes make Coach bags suitable for a wide variety of wardrobes.

While the designs tend to be more understated than Kate Spade’s, this approach enhances their longevity. Coach black bags often evoke a sense of quiet luxury—appropriate for the office, formal events, or simple daily errands—standing the test of time in both function and fashion.

[https://www.coachoutlet.com/products/hadley-convertible-crossbody-bag/CW002.html?frp=CW002+IMBLK](https://www.coachoutlet.com/products/hadley-convertible-crossbody-bag/CW002.html?frp=CW002+IMBLK)

## Materials & Craftsmanship

A daily black bag must endure everything from morning commutes to coffee spills. The materials and build quality directly affect how well a bag withstands regular use.

### Kate Spade: Lightweight Durability

Most Kate Spade black bags are crafted from saffiano leather, a scratch-resistant, structured material famous for its resilience. The brand also offers nylon and pebbled leather options, all chosen for being lightweight yet sturdy. Many bags include water-resistant finishes—helpful for unexpected weather or minor accidents.

Kate Spade’s stitching is precise, and smaller accents, such as magnetic snaps or smooth zippers, add to the overall feel. These touches mean less worry about wear and tear during a busy week.

### Coach: Heritage Leathers & Attention to Detail

Coach often uses full-grain or glove-tanned leather in its black bags, prized for their supple feel and ability to develop a sophisticated patina over time. These materials are notably robust, holding their shape and character for years.

The craftsmanship behind Coach bags is well regarded. Reinforced handles, strong stitching, and heavy-duty hardware assure daily reliability. With proper care, many Coach black bags last for years, if not decades.

## Organization and Functionality

When it comes to black bags for daily use, organization is just as crucial as style. Both brands offer functional features, but there are some notable distinctions.

### Kate Spade: Thoughtful Compartments

Kate Spade focuses on practical layouts. Common features include:

* Multiple interior pockets for phones, pens, or keys.
* Secure zippered sections to keep valuables safe.
* Detachable straps for switching between shoulder and crossbody wear.

These thoughtful details simplify hectic mornings. Many Kate Spade bags also open wide and close securely, making it effortless to access what you need on-the-go.

### Coach: Spacious Interiors and Versatility

Coach bags often excel in spaciousness, with softly structured interiors that allow for easy storage of larger items like tablets, notebooks, or even a light sweater. Additional perks include:

* Wide, reinforced openings for smooth access.
* Multiple slip and zippered pockets for organized storage.
* Convertible straps or handles to switch up your carry style.

This adaptability is especially valuable if your day varies from meetings to errands.

[https://bagbagsitter.com/collections/bucket-bag/products/genuine-leather-womens-tote-bag](https://bagbagsitter.com/collections/bucket-bag/products/genuine-leather-womens-tote-bag)

## Comfort and Wearability

No one wants a stylish black bag that aches after an hour of wear. Comfort is a significant factor, especially if you spend long days out.

* Kate Spade bags tend to be lighter and more compact, making them easier to carry for extended periods. Their streamlined shapes rarely dig into your shoulder or side, even when full.
* Coach bags, due to heavier leathers and larger sizes, might feel weightier but typically have padded straps or reinforced handles for comfort. The extra weight is a tradeoff for increased storage and longevity.

Consider your typical load: If you carry a lot, the padded straps of a Coach bag may be worth it. If you travel light, Kate Spade’s featherweight options deliver all-day comfort.

## Price and Value for Money

A daily black bag is an investment, so understanding what you get for your money is crucial.

* Kate Spade black bags usually fall in a moderate price range, especially when compared with luxury brands. Regular sales make them accessible, and their style/cost ratio is impressive.
* Coach black bags may run slightly higher, particularly those crafted of premium leathers, but their reputation for durability makes them an equally smart purchase.

In both cases, the resale value remains strong, so you can feel confident about your investment.

[https://www.coachoutlet.com/products/hadley-convertible-crossbody-bag/CW002.html?frp=CW002+IMBLK](https://www.coachoutlet.com/products/hadley-convertible-crossbody-bag/CW002.html?frp=CW002+IMBLK)

## Maintenance & Longevity

For a bag that gets daily use, easy care is essential.

* Kate Spade’s saffiano and nylon bags are easy to clean—a simple wipe-down keeps them looking new.
* Coach’s leather bags may require conditioning or careful storage to maintain their luster, but they tend to develop a beautiful patina, enhancing their character over time.

Both hold up well, but for those who want minimal upkeep, Kate Spade might have a slight edge. If willing to commit a little extra care, Coach bags can deliver decades of service.

## Which Brand Works for Your Lifestyle?

Choosing the right black bag ultimately comes down to your personal routine and preferences.

* If you’re looking for a bag that’s fresh, lightweight, and unfussy—perfect for quick changes from work to play—Kate Spade could be your match.
* If you prefer an iconic design, robust materials, and a bag that matures gracefully with every outing, consider a Coach black bag.

Either way, both deliver superb reliability, making black bags from either label an excellent addition to your daily life.

## Conclusion

Selecting between Kate Spade and Coach for your ideal daily black bag comes down to your unique style needs and habits. No matter your choice, you’ll benefit from versatility, durability, and timeless style—ensuring your black bag remains a trusted companion every day.",1,1764010179.0,handbags_BagBagSitter,0,1.0,False

All help is appreciated. Thanks 

** sharing itinerary to help assess budget but this post is for budget only, do not need help refining itinerary, main concern is budget. 
—————
Hi, I am looking to find out a good budget for a solo trip to three Scandinavian Capitals for a total of 10 days, before I take off.

Accommodations, Flights & intercity trains/flights are already booked and paid for. 


This is for spending budget only 

Ie: Food, coffee shops, activities, shopping. 
** Please note: I normally only eat 1 real meal a day (dinner), sometimes I will have a light lunch like a yogurt with granola. 
Breakfast will only be coffee. Take this into account as I may spend less on food than the avg 3 meals a day doer.

I’ll insert below my dates and interest for each location


Dates: 

Copenhagen: Nov 29- Dec 4 
- Shopping vintage & outlets (local contemporary brands), decor, ceramics, bedding 
- Coffee shops and restaurants 
- Some cocktail hour 

Oslo: Dec 4- Dec 6
- going for friends birthday weekend
- Oslo opera house on Thursday 4th (paid for) 
- Will likely have dinners and drinks 
- Visit munch museum

Stockholm: Dec 6-10
- Fotograsfiska 
- Vasa museum 
- Bakeries, coffee, more shopping for unique - Swedish designed items, stationery 

Copenhagen: Dec 10-11 (flight out of cph Dec 11th in the AM) 
relax one night before flight back, last dinner 

Location of accomodations (to budget public transport) 

- CPH: Vesterbro
- Oslo: Gamle Stan
- Sthlm: at six hotel, near central station. 

///
Overall: I want to buy 3-4 clothing pieces from local premium contemporary brands : 
Totême, Samsøe, maybe acne/axel arigato if good deals are found
(If I don’t find anything I love and come back with nothing I accept that too) 

- Some nice bedding (1 set, medium range local)
- Some cool small ceramics/ stationery items (notebooks pens etc) 
- A nice warm scarf 

I have set aside a budget of 
2200$CDN strictly for spending for everything outside of accomodations and flights ($1650 USD/€1430) 

I am trying to assess my budget , so that if needed I will acquire partial funds from my tfsa
(800$) max. (Takes about 5 business days) 
Which will bring my spending budget to 3000$CDN 

Can anyone who has been as of recently, give me a daily breakdown of their spending budget? 

How much can I expect to spend on public transport/ each category above? 

I’d like some wiggle room in my budget. 
Canada is not very cheap either because of tax and tips, I’m used to spending 28$ on a cocktail or 70-100$ for dinner by myself at a sit down restaurant. 

**also note, I’m 25 and a university student in Canada if this provides any discounts 
*Also plan on doing tax refund

1p5padn,https://www.reddit.com/r/LionsManeRecovery/comments/1p5padn/document_what_happened_to_you/,Document what happened to you.,"This Lion’s Mane mushroom recovery group has been around for a few years now, and hundreds of people have personally reached out to me during this time asking for help. When I’ve asked them if they’ve shared their story in the group, most people just aren’t interested in sharing it. This is why I’m writing this post.



We NEED people to share their stories and document what has happened to them. You can do it anonymously on here without mentioning your name, but unless more people start coming forward and sharing what has happened to them, this will keep happening for years to come to future people, because Lion’s Mane mushroom is everywhere. It’s being put in coffees, smoothies, energy drinks, etc. People have no idea how harmful it can be and then have their lives completely changed.



Imagine this happening to your kid, your mother, or your father. This is destroying lives. At the very least, if there was more awareness and people were informed about the potential side effects, some of this harm could be prevented.



We have over 26,000 people in this group at this point, and I know for certain there are a lot of people who haven’t come forward, for whatever reason, to share their story.



Documentation is crucial in this situation. You need to document what happened to you so there’s more awareness and so potential recovery solutions can be found.



All I ask is this: **document what happened to you. You deserve it. Others deserve it.**



Even a couple of sentences is enough.

1p5p9tp,https://www.reddit.com/r/NovelLinks/comments/1p5p9tp/looking_for_love_is_a_deep_scar/,Looking for Love is a Deep Scar,"A week before her wedding, Adeline Falcone received an anonymous email.

The moment she clicked the link, the explicit images on the screen made her forget how to breathe.

The link led to a dark website called ""The Beast's Lair,"" filled with graphic videos of men and women. The performers all wore animal masks, their bodies tangled wildly against a stark black background. The scale of it was shocking.

She frantically closed the page, but the afterimage burned into her mind.

In the top trending video, the man in the fox mask—his jawline, his build, even his heavy breathing—was identical to her fiancé, Vincent Costello.

The conference room fell silent. The faces of the other family ""capos"" were grim.

""Adeline, are you alright?""

Adeline forced herself to breathe, managing a weak smile as she continued her report on the family's ""legitimate"" businesses.

But inside, doubt and unease were growing like weeds.

After the meeting, she made an excuse and drove straight home.

Opening the link again, she clutched her three-month pregnant belly and dialed Vincent’s number with a trembling hand.

In the live stream from ""The Beast's Lair,"" a familiar ringtone suddenly sounded.

The man in the fox mask glanced at the screen, tossed the phone aside, and moved with even more force, drawing a series of moans from his partner in the rabbit mask.

The live show lasted for four excruciating hours.

Adeline watched the entire thing, too numb to even stand up.

But when the camera panned across the man's lower abdomen, a wave of relief washed over her.

There was no scar. It wasn't Vincent. She would never mistake the scar on Vincent's body.

A moment later, she heard a key in the front door. Vincent walked in.

His face was stern, his custom-tailored suit perfectly crisp, as if he belonged to a different world than the frenzied man in the video.

Vincent walked over and smiled gently at her.

""Sorry, my love. The meeting with the old-timers ran long, and I didn't get a chance to check my phone. Did you need something?""

Feeling guilty, Adeline quickly shut her laptop. ""Nothing, I just wanted to know when you'd be home.""

She kept telling herself it wasn't Vincent. Vincent loved her too much to ever betray her.

Years ago, she was hit by a stray bullet during a family feud, causing her kidneys to fail. Without telling anyone, he secretly got tested, found he was a match, and gave her one of his kidneys. The first thing he said waking up from the anesthesia was, ""Adeline, I just need you to live. That's enough.""

That's where the scar came from. It was proof of his love, a love he had risked his life for.

Besides, Vincent was known in the family for being cold and disciplined.

The last cocktail waitress who tried to seduce him, who had only brushed her chest against his arm, was ordered to be ""handled"" and thrown into the Hudson River. Afterwards, he scrubbed his arm with rubbing alcohol for an entire hour.

Even when Adeline was being clingy, he would gently push her away. ""My little kitten, don't be so needy. It clouds my judgment.""

He hated the touch of any woman but her. How could a man like that be so wild with a stranger?

""Adeline, what are you thinking about?""

Vincent handed her a glass of milk, his bathrobe hanging open to reveal a powerful chest.

Thinking about the images from today, the anxiety crept back in.

The mattress dipped beside her as Vincent wrapped his arms around her from behind. ""Get some sleep. It's good for our baby.""

Adeline turned over, her hand gently tracing the skin of his lower stomach. The familiar scar was still there. The knot of fear in her chest finally loosened.

Vincent kissed her forehead. ""Why are you always touching my scar? You think it's ugly?""

""No,"" Adeline whispered, snuggling into his arms. ""Vincent, I love you.""

He paused for a second, then chuckled softly, holding her tighter. ""I love you too, Adeline. Only you.""

""Just seven more days, and you'll be the matriarch of the Costello family. Rest up, and be the most beautiful bride in that dress.""

Adeline closed her eyes with a smile.

Maybe the man in the video was just a coincidence. Maybe she was just being paranoid because of the pregnancy.

But in the middle of the night, she woke with a start. The space beside her was empty.

Vincent's shoes were gone from the entryway. He had left.

Her heart pounded in her chest as she scrambled to the computer.

The fox-masked man was streaming again. It was the same woman in the rabbit mask, the two of them tangled together in a passionate embrace.

Even with the mask, the excitement and wildness in the fox's eyes were unmistakable.

They moved through every position imaginable until they were both spent.

She stared intently at the man's stomach.

This time, under the harsh light, the scar was perfectly, horribly clear.

In this video, the woman's voice was distorted by a modulator as she cooed, ""I hate this scar you got for another woman. And you won't even get it lasered off. I have to cover it with concealer for you every time.""

The fox man chuckled, leaning down to kiss her lips. ""I gave you the villa in the West Suburbs. Isn't that enough?""

""Not enough,"" the rabbit woman purred. ""Not unless you promise me we'll do it again in seven days. At your wedding. I'm the maid of honor, after all. No one will ever suspect a thing.""

The fox man was silent for a moment.

The rabbit woman whimpered, and just as she tried to pull away, he grabbed her waist, his movements becoming rougher.

""Fine. Anything you want.""

2、
Adeline felt like she had been plunged into ice water.

The villa in the West Suburbs was Vincent's wedding gift to her, their future home.

And Adeline’s only maid of honor was none other than the woman she trusted with her life, her best friend—Isabella ""Bella"" Rossi.

Bella was the first light in her life. When Adeline’s parents were killed in a family conflict, she was left alone, hiding in a church corner, gnawing on stale bread. It was Bella who dragged her home, who always saved the last piece of meat on her plate for her.

When the neighborhood bullies chased her with a pellet gun, it was Bella who threw up her arm to block the pellet aimed at her eye, getting hurt in the process.

So she trusted Bella more than anyone. They were as close as sisters.

After she met Vincent, Bella had even warned him, ""Adeline is like my own sister. You have to treat her right, or I'll never forgive you. The power of the Costello family doesn't scare me!""

Vincent had shot back, ""Adeline is the love of my life. From now on, please stay away from her. Don't be a bad influence.""

They were always at each other's throats. If Adeline hadn't been there to stop them, they would have pulled guns on each other long ago.

Back then, Adeline felt so lucky. Her best friend and the man she loved both cared about her so deeply.

Now, the video of them together was like a slap across the face.

No wonder Bella was always so vague about her boyfriend, never letting Adeline meet him.

It turned out they shared one.

All the clues clicked into place, forming a suffocating net around her, making it hard to even breathe.

A gasp from the screen broke her trance. The rabbit woman trembled in the fox man's arms before kissing him deeply.

The chat in the livestream exploded with comments.

[Fox is a fucking beast. Second round tonight and still going this hard.]

[Remember when that deer mask chick tried to kiss him and he dodged? I thought he was a germaphobe, but I guess he makes an exception for Rabbit.]

[My favorite couple! Please keep going, this is amazing.]

Adeline slumped in her chair, her heart feeling like it was being sliced apart.

Trembling, she pulled out her phone and dialed a number in Italy.

""About starting a new family business in Europe… I'm in. I'll be there in seven days.""

After hanging up, she contacted a private investigator, an old family loyalist who had worked for her father.

Two hours later, Vincent returned, bringing a chill with him.

He quickly showered, acting as if nothing had happened, then made breakfast and gave Adeline a good-morning kiss.

Adeline couldn't understand why Vincent would betray her with her best friend. They were supposed to hate each other.

After Vincent left, Adeline called Bella.

""Honey, I took the day off just for you. You have no idea what a nightmare your stone-faced fiancé is at work. One tiny mistake and he'll chew you out for an hour! Thank God you gave me an excuse to escape.""

Bella linked arms with her, complaining about how much Vincent overworked her in the family business.

Adeline smelled her perfume; it was the same one Vincent wore. Her fingertips went cold, but she forced herself to sound calm. ""I think Vincent is seeing someone else.""

Bella’s shocked expression didn't seem fake.

""No way! You must be overthinking things because of the pregnancy. Vincent loves you so much. He would never cheat.""

Adeline didn't say anything else, just watched Bella's eyes carefully.

When they ordered drinks, Adeline got Bella her usual: soda water with ice.

""I can't have ice anymore,"" Bella said softly, rubbing her stomach. ""I'm pregnant.""

3、
Her words hit Adeline like a bolt of lightning. ""You're pregnant?""

Bella looked at her, pretending to be shy. ""It was an accident. I'm three months along, too.""

Three months. Her baby was also three months. Bella had gotten pregnant at the same time as her.

""Is the father your boyfriend? I've never even met this new guy.""

With every word, Adeline’s heart trembled a little more.

""Yeah, he's always busy,"" Bella said with a smile, picking up her phone. ""But that's okay. He can't always be with me, but when we do see each other, it’s like he’s trying to devour me to make up for it. I should be happy with that.""

Vincent called, asking where Adeline was, and said he was coming to pick her up.

When he arrived, his face darkened the moment he saw Bella.

""You said you had something urgent to take care of. You meant getting coffee?""

Before Bella could speak, Adeline cut in. ""I asked Bella to go shopping with me. Let's drop her home first.""

""Oh, no, I don't want to be a third wheel,"" Bella said, holding her lower back. ""I'll just get a cab.""

She quickly hailed a taxi and got in before Vincent could say anything.

Adeline noticed Vincent's knuckles were white as he gripped the steering wheel.

He drove slowly, keeping a careful distance behind Bella's cab, as if afraid something would happen to her.

At the next intersection, the taxi driver slammed on his brakes, and Bella seemed to be jolted in the back seat.

Vincent stomped on the brake. The sudden stop threw Adeline forward, the seatbelt cutting painfully into her.

But Vincent didn't even notice her discomfort. He unbuckled his seatbelt and ran towards the taxi.

He knocked on the window, his voice tight with anger.

""Are you insane? I told you not to run around while you're pregnant! Get in my car, now!""

""What's it to you?"" Bella's eyes turned red, her voice cracking. ""You should be taking Adeline home! Leave me alone!""

Vincent clicked his tongue, then simply opened the back door, leaned in, and swept Bella into his arms, carrying her to his car and placing her gently in the back seat.

Only after Bella was settled did he turn to look at Adeline in the passenger seat.

Her face was pale, her lips colorless. She was clutching her cramping stomach, sweat beading on her forehead.

A flicker of panic finally crossed Vincent's eyes. He grabbed her arm. ""Sorry, my love, did I scare you? She's your best friend. I was afraid you'd rush out to help her and hurt yourself, that's why I…""

Bella quickly added, ""I'm so sorry, Adeline. It's all my fault for worrying you.""

Watching them, Adeline felt a bitter irony.

They clearly cared so much for each other, yet they had to pretend it was all for her sake.

She closed her eyes, protecting her small baby bump. ""It's fine. Just take her home.""

Vincent was obviously distracted while driving, his expression growing heavier.

After dropping Bella off, he seemed to relax and drove Adeline home.

They didn't speak a word. Back at their house, Vincent hugged her from behind.

""Adeline, are you still mad at me? I'm sorry, I was just worried. You said she's the only family you have left. I was scared she would get hurt and you'd be upset. It was just an impulse.""

Adeline's chest felt like it had been hit with a sledgehammer, a dull, aching pain.

He had clearly seen how uncomfortable the sudden stop had made her, yet his eyes kept flicking to Bella in the rearview mirror.

It was so obvious who he cared about more.

""Vincent, let's call…""

Before she could say the words ""call off the wedding,"" Vincent's phone rang. His face changed instantly.

""My love, something urgent came up with the family. I have to go handle it. Wait for me at home!""

He bolted out the door. Adeline's heart clenched. She went to the study and pulled up the security feed for the West Suburbs villa.

Of course. He had gone to Bella. As soon as he was inside, his voice was filled with concern. ""Is your stomach hurting? Let me see. Was it from the car ride?""

He held Bella tenderly, rubbing her belly. Bella leaned into him and whispered, ""You were so obvious today. Do you think Adeline suspects anything?""

Instantly, Vincent's face turned cold, and he put some distance between them. ""She won't find out. And you are not to see her alone again!""

""Why not? Adeline is my best friend. Are you saying I can't see her just because of you?""

""She's pregnant!"" Vincent hissed. ""I can't have you saying the wrong thing and stressing her out.""

""But I'm pregnant too!"" Bella's voice was tearful. ""Doesn't my baby matter? You knew I was pregnant and you still came to me. Don't you care about my feelings at all?""

The air went still. After a long moment, Vincent spoke in a heavy voice. ""This child's existence was a mistake.""

""Vincent, you bastard!"" Bella cried, hitting him. But a moment later, the sounds of them kissing filled the room, followed by the rustle of clothing.

""Be a good girl. Get rid of the baby. I'll give you enough money to live comfortably for the rest of your life.""

Bella was silent for a second, then wrapped her arms around his neck and kissed him. ""But I hate procedures. I'd rather you help me take care of it. I heard… if we do it enough times, it'll just go away on its own…""

Vincent cursed under his breath, but still swept her into his arms and slammed the bedroom door shut.

A second later, a text from him popped up on her phone.

[My love, I have to work late at the family office tonight. Get some rest. Love you.]

The words ""Love you"" were in black, but to Adeline, they burned a blood-red.

A wave of nausea washed over her, and she doubled over, dry heaving.

How pathetic. Their secret hookup spot was the very house she was supposed to move into in seven days. Her marital home.

Her heart ached as if it were being torn apart. Adeline felt the cold, salty sting of tears on her face.

Just then, the private investigator sent her a message.

[Miss Falcone, I found a social media account. It might have what you're looking for.]",1,1764009657.0,NovelLinks,0,1.0,False

Struggling with research, assignments, and deadlines can be a challenge, but it doesn't have to be.

Time management is an essential skill for any student, and it can be the difference between success and failure. 

 You have to know that productive studying doesn’t just happen – it requires careful thought, planning, and strategy in the way that you use your time.

To get the most out of your study sessions, you need to carefully manage your time.

This means allocating enough time for researching, reading, and writing assignments as well as balancing other aspects of life such as work and social activities.

Planning ahead can help you prioritize tasks so that they don’t accumulate into chaos or become distractions.

Many people find managing their time one of the most difficult challenges when it comes to studying.

To simplify this task, try following some tips on better time management which help make sure you are focusing on what matters most in dedicated study sessions.

Here's a list of 7 strategies for effective time management when studying! 

# Why Time Management is Important

Before we get into the tips, we should know why time management is important.

Time management is one of the most important skills when it comes to getting good grades. After all, if you can't manage your time quickly and efficiently, then you'll find yourself struggling to stay on top of your workload.

Why should you care about time management? Well, learning how to manage your time optimally can help you make the most of your study hours. You'll be able to focus longer and get more done in a shorter period of time.

Time management is especially important for college students, who often have multiple classes with due dates scattered throughout the week. Good time management helps them make sure they're spending equal amounts of time on each class and not inadvertently letting one subject slip behind!

Furthermore, effectively managing your studies will free up more free time for leisure activities, hobbies, or spending quality time with friends and family.

Time management also teaches you valuable life skills such as planning ahead and goal setting which are invaluable in any professional career!

Now, moving on to the time management tips! 

# 1. Determine What Goes First

The first step in effective time management is to determine what tasks need to be done and prioritize them.

Make a to-do list of all the tasks you need to complete, then rank them in order of importance. This will help your stress levels stay down, so you can focus on the most important tasks first and avoid wasting time on less important ones.

You can also break down large tasks into smaller, more manageable chunks. This will make it easier to focus on one task at a time and make sure you're making progress.

Set realistic deadlines for yourself and stick to them. This will help you stay on track and avoid procrastination.

Take regular breaks throughout the day to give your mind a rest and recharge. This will help you stay focused and productive when it's time to get back to work.

#  2. Set Deadlines

Setting deadlines for yourself is an important part of effective time management. It helps you stay focused and motivated to complete tasks in a timely manner.

When setting deadlines, make sure they are realistic and achievable. If the deadline is too far away, it can be easy to procrastinate.

Start by breaking down your tasks into smaller, more manageable chunks. This will help you to focus on one task at a time and make it easier to set deadlines for each step.

When setting deadlines, consider how long the task will take and factor in any potential delays or obstacles that may arise. This will help you avoid feeling overwhelmed or discouraged if something unexpected happens.

It's also important to remember that it's okay to adjust your deadlines if needed. Life happens and sometimes things don't go according to plan.

# 3. Create a Schedule

Creating a schedule is one of the best ways to manage your time. It helps you plan out when and how long you will spend on each task.

Your schedule should include specific blocks of time for studying, as well as breaks for meals and leisure activities. This will give you some extra time to finish everything and keep you motivated for what is coming throughout the day.

When creating your schedule, be sure to factor in any commitments you have outside of studying. This could include work, family obligations, or other activities.

Make sure to leave enough time for these activities so that you don’t feel overwhelmed or rushed.

Once you have created your schedule, stick to it as much as possible. This will help you stay on track and make the most of your time.

# 4. Eliminate Distractions

Distractions can be a major obstacle when it comes to effective time management. It's important to eliminate any distractions that may be preventing you from focusing on your tasks.

Start by turning off your phone and other electronic devices while you are studying, these are a part of your daily activities you might not even notice how much time you spend on them.

But, this will help you stay focused and avoid getting sidetracked by notifications or messages.

You should also try to find a quiet place to study where there are minimal distractions. This could be a library, study room, or even your own bedroom.

If you find yourself getting easily distracted, try using a timer to stay focused. Set the timer for a certain amount of time and commit to staying on task until it goes off.

It can also be helpful to break down your tasks into smaller chunks. This will make them seem more manageable and help you stay focused on the task at hand.

If you find yourself getting easily bored or distracted, try switching up your study environment. Go for a walk, work in a coffee shop, or even take a break and do something fun like playing a game or watching a movie.

# 5. Say NO 

Saying no can be one of the most difficult things to do, but it is also one of the most important when it comes to effective time management. Learning to say no to activities or requests that are not essential will help you make the most of your time and focus on what matters.

When faced with a request or invitation, take a moment to consider if it is something that you really want or need to do.

If not, politely decline and focus your energy on the tasks that are most important to you.

It can be difficult to turn down an invitation or request, but it is important to remember that your time is valuable and limited.

By saying no to activities that are not essential, you will free up more time for the things that matter most.

You may also find it helpful to set boundaries with friends and family about when you are available and when you need to focus on your studies.

# 6. Use Time-Management Apps

Time-management apps can be a great tool for staying organized and on track with your studies. These apps allow you to create schedules, set reminders and track your progress.

Using a time-management app can help you stay focused and motivated throughout the day. You can use the app to plan out specific blocks of time for studying, as well as breaks for meals and leisure activities. The app can also help you track your progress and stay on top of deadlines. 

Make sure to choose an app that is easy to use and fits your needs. There are many different time-management apps available, so take some time to explore the options and find one that works best for you.

Also, these applications can be used to set goals and track your progress. This will help you stay motivated and on track with your studies.

# 7. Reward Yourself

Rewarding yourself for a job well done is an important part of effective time management. When you complete a task or reach a goal, take some time to celebrate your accomplishment.

This could be something as simple as taking a break to watch a movie or going out for ice cream with friends.

No matter how you choose to reward yourself, make sure it is something that you enjoy and will motivate you to keep going.

Rewarding yourself for a job well done will help you stay motivated and on track with your studies. It will also give you something to look forward to when the going gets tough.

1p5p8cs,https://www.reddit.com/r/PsoriaticArthritis/comments/1p5p8cs/psoriatic_arthritis_autoimmune_and_body_effects/,"Psoriatic Arthritis, autoimmune and body effects","Hi to all the community

My husband has had 'diagnosed' arthritis for approx. 20 years (currently 49 years old). He was diagnosed with Psoriatic Arthritis (PA) approx'10  years ago. Very little was explained to him and only as flare ups or issues have arisen have we got any advice or meds ad hoc.

This is long winded so I will try and explain as succinctly as possible.

When I met husband 20+ years ago he was fit with no ails. When we returned from backpacking he went through a heightened stress period which we believe 'triggered' the PA and the auto-immune.

Initially, this seems to have primarily attacked his joints, feet, toes, hands, knees, jaw and back.

Subsequently, his stomach and bowels have deteriorated year by year. He has had so many tests and treatments however treated and observed (not in consideration of the PA) there has been no diagnosis or support or treatment plan to fix or help. He can tolerate VERY little foods or fluids and I cant stress the limitation of diet and when he can eat. This is a man who when we met could easily out eat me at any opportunity and with any dietary option with no concerns to doing so.

He doesn't drink or smoke and has always been active and cares for his physical wellbeing even when the PA has affected his movements.

Earlier this year after a strange 'blowing up' of both legs from toes to above his abdomen area we sought medical advice first from the arthritis specialist who thought is was cardiac related and then referred to urgent cardiology. Oddly at the time he wasn't taken Leflunomide but we had some (while waiting to see anyone) and within a day of starting the fluid retention started to resolve. The arthritis specialist was adamant the meds had nothing to do with it and that something just changed instead resolving the issue. John heart rate was very high (usually low / very low) so off to Cardio. Short version is after much argument we got him scanned and he was diagnosed as below (though easier to share full thing for the medically minded!). Note that the Cardiac team have not really explained the condition, status, what the meds do. Everyone is puzzled by the odema event but cant agree why it happened . Cardio think it was PA that went bezerk, and the Arthritis team think it was cardiac issue! Husband is now living in an anxiety state of health disarray, the GPs are nice but useless .....

Letter ->

I saw this 49 year old gentleman for review at the xxx Clinic on 31st March to discuss his cardiac  
MRI report. To recap, he had presented with lower limb odema last summer. NT-pro BP was mildly elevated and echo carried out at the xxx was reported to show mild left ventricular systolic dysfunction.  
A cardiac MRI was advised. To expedite investigation, he came to see me at xxx. In the interim, the leg oedema has spontaneously resolved accompanied by substantial weight loss and a repeat NT-pro BNP in February 2025 was <50ng/l. He remains well with no shortness of breath or return of oedema.  
I enclose a copy of his cardiac MRI. It shows mildly reduced global systolic function with ejection fraction of 48% and slight left ventricular enlargement with diastolic volume 265ml (normal <244ml). There is no infiltrate or evidence of active inflammation. An incidental finding is of slight aortic root enlargement at 45mm (indexed at 23.5mm/m (normal <22mm/m).  
So, this is described as heart failure with mildly reduced ejection fraction (HFmrF). Whether he had some form of cardiac insult last year which is recovering or there is a persistent mild abnormality of cardiac function is uncertain. I think he should continue with ramipril and dapagliflozin as before but as he has psoriasis and arthropathy which flares, it is reasonable to remain off beta-blocker therapy.  
He will require follow-up and consideration of repeat echo/MRI to reassess pump function and aortic root diameter in another year or so.

\---- end of letter ---

So... there is some background. To also note last 10 years he has..

Had ongoing physio for back issues (l4/l5) joints are wear and tear with previous issues for nerve damage.

Had issues with hip flexor.

Last 16 weeks we have been on another diagnosis hunt he 'may' have fracture his L5&6 rib as showing so on xrays but also may have torn or severe damage to left pectoral muscle / tendons, a residual cough here and there - isnt healing fast at all and NO idea how! cant take any pain relief and stomach cant take it! Went to A&E as 2 weeks ago he was doubled in pain as something went 'click' but no further forward with diagnosis, he has regained some movement in arms and chest through physio.

Awful issues with stomach and bowels - on having scopes found polyps in stomach and in colon, those in colon resulted in diagnosis of Colonic polyp(s), Colitis no treatment but a follow up scope due 2026. IBS was ruled out. He has no known allergies. Some not all symptoms are similar to GERD, severe reflux - immense bleching, inability to tolerate cold drinks. Bowel wise generally at least once but more often twice a week he has days where he releases 'everything and then some' not as diarrhea but as various types of poos each different until empty, never feeling 'empty' and always drained after pooing. Urine always dark as can only really tolerate caffeine free coffee (2 in am, 2 at lunch and 2 at dinner, cannot eat after 430 for fear of ongoing issues at night and nauseous). Usually cannot eat until lunch (midday) as restless sleeps usually gets to settle around 130am and wakes late to compensate, hence eat at lunch).

Question - im getting there.

I am not medically trained but I live and care for him and know him, his symptoms etc

My instinct tells me the majority of his symptoms / conditions **stem from PA/autoimmune.**

I respect and accept that he may not be able to fix / cure what damage is already done to the various areas of his body. Esp the stomach. However can we help **PREVENT worsening.**

I think - if we treat the autoimmune as the root cause the rest may resolve or prevent further damage?

Would biologics help, would anything. With his heart condition what can he take - what can help.

We have had some great empathetic specialists over the years (arthritis) however we have never met a PA specialist let alone a specialist who is willing to look at the holistic issues he has and a treatment plan and awareness of the disease and what it could do longer term. All specialists seems to know very little about PA and if they know anything its only related to bones and arthritis not the autoimmune effect the disease has.

ANY advice is welcomed.

Thank you in advance and sorry for the LONG thread.

PS - if anyone has any tips on finding a rheumatologist who specialises in Psoriatic Arthritis uk please let us know!

  
**Wee edit** \- he has tried a number of meds in the past which didn't agree including methotrexate, hydroxychloroquine and sulfasalazine - only leflunomide has been tolerated but due to other issues he stopped this a year and half ago (started in 2017).",0,1764009566.0,PsoriaticArthritis,5,0.5,False

Such a wonderful experience!  Went on a girls trip with my two college best friends.   We all were all coming in on different flights and a little anxious with the government shutdown impact to the airports.  Luckily we all made it in the day prior without any delays!

We arrived at the port at 11:10am with a 10:30 checkin window.  Left our bags with the friendly porters at the curb and made it through security 10 minutes later.  Every employee we encouraged was so nice!

We got on the ship quickly and started to explore.   We had the drink package, so that was our first stop.  Grabbed some lunch at the Windjammer and then sat by the pool until our room was ready at 1:15pm.  
Super impressed with the lunch at the windjammer.  Everything was warm, tons of options.  Really surprised how perfectly the broccoli was cooked, the carved beef was excellent too.

We spent the sail away party from the track deck, then headed back to our room for the sunet and get ready for dinner.  We booked a guaranteed balcony and were thrilled with our location!  Room 7298 had the 3rd bed pull down from the ceiling, a great location midship and was in really good condition.

Tried anytime dining for the first time and it was a huge success.  We ended up loving our servers, so returned to their table the upcoming days.  I'm prone to motion sickness, and while I barely felt a thing the entire trip - the first night at dinner I got queasy.  I left the table right after the entree was served to go rest.  Our servers ordered me another dinner and sent it with my friends to eat when I was feeling better.  Such a nice touch!  We enjoyed the escargot and prime rib.  Everything was hot and tasty.

We went to the ice show after dinner and WOW!  Blown away by the talent and production, so unexpected.  Walking through the ship, we stumbled upon the Decades Party in the promenade and it was a blast!!  Ended up staying for the entire thing.  Our group really thought Tornado Tanya had such a great energy!

Woke up in the Nasauu, stopping back at the Windjammer for breakfast.  Our group enjoyed everything we tried from the buffet and I thought the bloody mary was perfect.
We didn't do any excursions, but walked around town doing a little shopping and had conch fritters and lobster bites with a beer near the pier.  

Back on ship, we tried out the water slides and the group loved the big slide with the double tube. Spent some time with cocktails in the pool and the hottub for the sunset, then back to the room to get ready for dinner.

Happy to see our servers again, we really enjoyed italian night.  The arancini was a hit and beef carpaccio was my favorite, so flavorful.   The chicken parm was great and the group loved the chocolate cake for dessert.  

Went to the Platinum Theater for Saturday Night Fever the musical.  Waited in a super long line for popcorn ($3 charge) and thought the show was really well done!  The music was a litttle loud and fought the vocals, but still impressed.  The piano bar had a great vibe and drinks.  We went back to the promenade after to grab a slice of pizza from Sorrento's and listen to some live music before calling it a night.

Woke up at Coco Cay - the day we were most looking forward to.  Had another breakfast at the Windjammer (didn't like it quite as much as the day before) and got off the ship to head to Hideway Beach.  So happy we did the adults only beach - worth the extra charge.  Tons of chairs, perfect beach and a really fun pool with lots of space.  It was crowded, but never felt like wall to wall people.  Having the drink package here made the day so easy!  The waiters were great and remembered us/our numbers right away.  The food was much better than I anticipated, the best dish being the secret sandwich (chicken sandwich with mozzarella sticks and marina sauce)  The ceviche and fries were great too.  Best part of the day was pulling up their water bean bags to the shore line at the beach, soak up the sun and have our toes in the water.  So peaceful and beautiful.  The water was crystal clear turquoise!

I was feeling a little under the weather during dinner (not motion, maybe sun) so skipped dinner.  My friends paid to go to the Mexican restaurant on board and enjoyed it.  They stopped back in the dining room to thank our servers and give an extra tip.  After resting, I grabbed a ham and brie roll from the coffee shop and it was really good.  We headed back to the Platinum Theater to see the comedian perform his 18+ show - very very funny!  Then went to Olive and Twist to check out the silent disco, everyone there was having such a great time!
We left our luggage outside the room to be picked up.

The next morning, my friends had coffee and pastries from the coffee shop before heading out at 8am.  En route to our debarkation location - the staff told us we could just head out.  It was incredibly fast and very efficient.  Less than 15 min from leaving our room til we arrived at our luggage.  Traffic at FLL was bad once we got into the airport, but we made it to security 45 minutes after leaving our room!  So so fast!

11/14-11/17

Such a wonderful experience!  Went on a girls trip with my two college best friends.   We all were all coming in on different flights and a little anxious with the government shutdown impact to the airports.  Luckily we all made it in the day prior without any delays!

We arrived at the port at 11:10am with a 10:30 checkin window.  Left our bags with the friendly porters at the curb and made it through security 10 minutes later.  Every employee we encouraged was so nice!

We got on the ship quickly and started to explore.   We had the drink package, so that was our first stop.  Grabbed some lunch at the Windjammer and then sat by the pool until our room was ready at 1:15pm.  
Super impressed with the lunch at the windjammer.  Everything was warm, tons of options.  Really surprised how perfectly the broccoli was cooked, the carved beef was excellent too.

We spent the sail away party from the track deck, then headed back to our room for the sunet and get ready for dinner.  We booked a guaranteed balcony and were thrilled with our location!  Room 7298 had the 3rd bed pull down from the ceiling, a great location midship and was in really good condition.

Tried anytime dining for the first time and it was a huge success.  We ended up loving our servers, so returned to their table the upcoming days.  I'm prone to motion sickness, and while I barely felt a thing the entire trip - the first night at dinner I got queasy.  I left the table right after the entree was served to go rest.  Our servers ordered me another dinner and sent it with my friends to eat when I was feeling better.  Such a nice touch!  We enjoyed the escargot and prime rib.  Everything was hot and tasty.

We went to the ice show after dinner and WOW!  Blown away by the talent and production, so unexpected.  Walking through the ship, we stumbled upon the Decades Party in the promenade and it was a blast!!  Ended up staying for the entire thing.  Our group really thought Tornado Tanya had such a great energy!

Woke up in the Nasauu, stopping back at the Windjammer for breakfast.  Our group enjoyed everything we tried from the buffet and I thought the bloody mary was perfect.
We didn't do any excursions, but walked around town doing a little shopping and had conch fritters and lobster bites with a beer near the pier.  

Back on ship, we tried out the water slides and the group loved the big slide with the double tube. Spent some time with cocktails in the pool and the hottub for the sunset, then back to the room to get ready for dinner.

Happy to see our servers again, we really enjoyed italian night.  The arancini was a hit and beef carpaccio was my favorite, so flavorful.   The chicken parm was great and the group loved the chocolate cake for dessert.  

Went to the Platinum Theater for Saturday Night Fever the musical.  Waited in a super long line for popcorn ($3 charge) and thought the show was really well done!  The music was a litttle loud and fought the vocals, but still impressed.  The piano bar had a great vibe and drinks.  We went back to the promenade after to grab a slice of pizza from Sorrento's and listen to some live music before calling it a night.

Woke up at Coco Cay - the day we were most looking forward to.  Had another breakfast at the Windjammer (didn't like it quite as much as the day before) and got off the ship to head to Hideway Beach.  So happy we did the adults only beach - worth the extra charge.  Tons of chairs, perfect beach and a really fun pool with lots of space.  It was crowded, but never felt like wall to wall people.  Having the drink package here made the day so easy!  The waiters were great and remembered us/our numbers right away.  The food was much better than I anticipated, the best dish being the secret sandwich (chicken sandwich with mozzarella sticks and marina sauce)  The ceviche and fries were great too.  Best part of the day was pulling up their water bean bags to the shore line at the beach, soak up the sun and have our toes in the water.  So peaceful and beautiful.  The water was crystal clear turquoise!

I was feeling a little under the weather during dinner (not motion, maybe sun) so skipped dinner.  My friends paid to go to the Mexican restaurant on board and enjoyed it.  They stopped back in the dining room to thank our servers and give an extra tip.  After resting, I grabbed a ham and brie roll from the coffee shop and it was really good.  We headed back to the Platinum Theater to see the comedian perform his 18+ show - very very funny!  Then went to Olive and Twist to check out the silent disco, everyone there was having such a great time!
We left our luggage outside the room to be picked up.

The next morning, my friends had coffee and pastries from the coffee shop before heading out at 8am.  En route to our debarkation location - the staff told us we could just head out.  It was incredibly fast and very efficient.  Less than 15 min from leaving our room til we arrived at our luggage.  Traffic at FLL was bad once we got into the airport, but we made it to security 45 minutes after leaving our room!  So so fast!

This was such an affordable cruise and blew us all away!  I'll gladly return to Liberty of the Seas!

by [https://www.gptsportswriter.com](https://www.gptsportswriter.com) **Real Sociedad vs. Villarreal: A Tight Tussle with a Twist**

The odds for this clash between Real Sociedad and Villarreal are as balanced as a tightrope walker’s coffee cup—neither team holds a clear advantage, but the bookmakers are charging you like they do. Let’s break it down with the precision of a Spanish accountant and the humor of a barkeep at a La Liga pub.

### Parsing the Odds: A Statistical Tango

The implied probabilities from the bookmakers tell a story of two evenly matched rivals. At decimal odds of roughly **2.6** for both teams, each has a **\~38.5% chance to win**, while the draw sits at **\~29.4%** (thanks to those sneaky bookmaker margins). The over/under line is set at **2.5 goals**, with the “over” priced at **\~54%** and the “under” at **\~46%**. This suggests a high-scoring affair, but given Sociedad’s recent 3-0 drubbing of Villarreal and both teams’ leaky defenses, we’re looking at a chaotic chess match where every pawn could become a queen.

### Digesting the News: Injuries, Form, and a Dash of Drama

Villarreal enters this showdown with a mixed résumé: they’ve beaten Levante and Mallorca but lost to Atlético Madrid and drew with Getafe. Their attack, led by the ever-reliable Gerard Moreno, is as sharp as a *paella* knife, but their defense? Well, let’s just say it’s like a sieve that’s been challenged to a sieve competition.

Real Sociedad, meanwhile, is riding a wave of confidence after their **3-0 dismantling of Villarreal** in their last meeting. They’ve also beaten Osasuna and Alaves, with their front three (Méndez, Guedes, Barrenetxea) operating like

I have a very active 15 month old. My in laws have two sets of stairs in their living area (one up and one down). They put a rolling table that my son can get around pretty easily to block the stairs going up and some heavy boxes (I asked for instead of the other rolling table) in front of the stairs that go down. They don’t have outlet covers and leave their ring doorbell sound speaker plugged in at crawling height. They have several other things plugged in at baby height, speakers, air purifier, etc. They have 6 kids (3 still at home, the youngest is 9). Their kids’ stuff is usually “put away” but accessible to my son. It’s usually on the coffee tables or in bins he can get to. The only thing that stops him from trashing their stuff is if he finds something interesting to play with early in the visit. Obviously I’m watching my son like a hawk the whole time we’re there, but it’s kind of exhausting.

I’m just wondering what is typical and reasonable to expect. I think they want us to feel comfortable, but I don’t want to ask too much. Since they’ve had so many kids and their youngest is still pretty young, I feel like they remember baby proofing basics and if they wanted to they would?

Okay. So hear me out.


Everything is made of matter, right?
And matter is made of atoms.
That includes you. Me. Everything.
So you’re basically walking, talking, breathing atoms.


Now, atoms are not just sitting there. They’re charged.
Some are positive. Some are negative. And opposites attract.
*(it's proved)*


**So here's my theory.**


when we feel pulled towards someone, or something, or anything, it's not because we love them, it's not because we have emotions for them, I mean simply ke it's not our feelings, okay? It's because our atoms are... because both of our atoms are charged oppositely, so we attract each other. The things we hate are because of the atoms. So... so, our soulmate might not just be chosen through emotion or faith, but through an atomic, invisible attraction. Or whatever we follow, whatever passion we have, whatever hobbies we do, or whatever things we love to do, it's because we have opposite charges. ""opposite charges, opposite atoms""  so that we attract towards that thing. And... let's just take this example: there are so many drinks in the world, but a person chooses to take one.


 Like, if we have tea, coffee, water, and juices, but if there's a coffee lover, he will choose coffee. But that's not enough, because coffee has so many flavors. The man has so many choices, but he chooses that one flavor of coffee which he is attracted towards, not because that flavor tastes so good, but because he feels attracted towards it. That's why he chooses that coffee.


You choose that one coffee out of a hundred? That one person out of millions?
Not because “your heart said so.”
But because your atoms found their opposite.
And eventually you got pulled.


And because every day you’re losing atoms. Touch something? You lose atoms. Breathe? You gain some, lose some. You are literally never the same person twice.

That’s why people change. That’s why you fall for something new. That’s why you outgrow people. Because your atomic field changed. And now, you need a new match.

Same for mistakes. Addictions. Bad choices. We don’t know what atoms we lost. We don’t even know what we’re becoming until the attraction hits.


It explains it that you think you're choosing. But really, your atoms made the first move. Even identity? Who are you?You’re just a temporary mix of whatever atoms you have right now.. You’re not one fixed soul. You're pulling and being pulled, every second, every breath.
And whether you believe it or not…
it’s already working inside you.

If I'm being honest, I started Zepbound because I needed help in getting a handle on my weight, and in turn my overall health. I was lasered focused on reading everyone's success stories, and looking at dozens and dozens before and after pics. Seeing the weight loss, and reading the metrics about the scale-related achievements people have made, motivated me to take the plunge. 

I more or less just glazed over posts about NSVs, and the lack of food noise as ""nice to know, but ultimately superfluous to my goals"". 

Man was I wrong. 

I took my first dose this past Friday, 11/21/25, and over the weekend I carefully controlled my eating and environment to avoid temptation as I really wanted to get off to a good start. 

Then this morning came, and I walked into my office, and ran smack into a freshly baked coffee cake (my coworkers famous recipe). Normally I would have scooped up the biggest piece there to have with my first coffee, and then mid-morning went back for another (likely totaling 800 to 900 calories). 

But this morning...Nothing. I didn't even have the slightest urge to have a piece, and I already know it's delicious. I just thought to myself ""wow, that looks tasty"" and I walked away. 

It wasn't until I passed the container again at lunchtime that I realized that I'd broken my usual pattern. 

I haven't lost a single pound yet, but I have to tell you, this particular NSV was an absolute WIN for me, and felt more freeing than I have the words to describe. 

So the moral to my story? If you're new to this journey like me, don't get too caught up in just the weight loss alone. It seems there are going to be a lot of small victories along the way to savor. ",20,1764008974.0,Zepbound,12,0.96,False
1p5oy6x,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1p5oy6x,Smashed My First Marathon! 3:19!,"Hi all! I ran a 3:19:xx in my first marathon and couldn’t be more satisfied and proud. For reference, I did a two year stint of running cross country at a moderate level (5k: 18:45, 1600: 4:45) about 8-9 years ago, and fell back in love with the sport in August of 2024 while preparing for a half marathon. After that race, I put the marathon on the map as my next target race, running a 5k (19:04) and a half marathon (1:36:37) in between.

Training:
I started training in June of this year, and decided in July to completely cut out alcohol until I had finished the marathon. I attribute much of my success to a mix of the sobriety and my unwavering consistency throughout my 20 week training block. The plan itself started with roughly 26 miles in week 1 and gradually increased weekly by about 1-2 miles, peaking at 55 miles on week 16. It also did a great job of working in speed work early in the block, then focusing on more on endurance as the mileage went up. I stayed relatively uninjured while training and largely attribute this to being alcohol free and being smart with easy runs.

Race Week:
I got a nasty cold a week and a half out from the race and decided to play it safe and dial everything back until I felt better. This means I only ran 22 miles the week before race week, and only 9 on race week. During one of those runs I decided to test out my marathon pace and ended up barely being able to hold 7:45 pace for 2 miles. That wrecked my mental heading into the race but watched a few badass movies and reflected on my training and fixed my mentality. 

Nutrition-wise, I started carb loading with 630g per day three days out from the marathon. I put down on bagels, white rice, sourdough, bananas, pasta, and so much freaking sprite.

Race Day:
After sleeping so little and poorly that my watch didn’t even register and sleep, I got up at 3:30 to start getting some light food, drink, and coffee in me to prepare for the day and hopefully get some *movements* going. When 4:30 rolled around and nothing came, I took a walk around the block and still nothing. Ultimately nothing happened before the race which greatly affected how I decided to run.

Once 6:45 rolled around, I got in my corral and started mentally and physically preparing. I was in corral B which was for those looking to run between 3:29:59 and 3:00, with an A goal of 3:24 and a B Goal of 3:30, I situated myself towards the back. I overheard the 3:20 pacer say that his plan was to negative split so I decided to hang with them until the pace picked up then start to hit my paces solo. I didn’t exactly do that. I followed for about 5 miles then ended up passing the 3:20 group at mile 6 out of pure excitement, and I continued to put distance on them and actually lost sight of them. From mile 13-18 I felt so good, almost invincible. 

However, like clockwork, mile 20 hit me like a truck. My energy felt great but the sharp, deep aches in my quads with every step made it virtually impossible to improve my pace beyond 7:36. To make matters worse, at the end of mile 22 I got a nearly debilitating side stitch that made me strongly consider walking. I focused on my breathing and reminded myself of Louis Zamperini (Unbroken) who, despite having a broken ankle and being starved, held a plank above his head for 37 minutes. I could grit my teeth through a side stitch for another 30 minutes.

I managed to find the pain tolerance to finish the last .5 at 7:23 pace and demolished a cup of warm chicken broth after. 

I’m so grateful for this community and to my home city for making us runners feel so special. Running up boathouse row and feeling the crowd noise get louder and louder made the pain fade ever so slightly, and hearing a stranger cheer your name as you quietly run through Strawberry Mansion is beautiful. Now please excuse me, I have some catching up to do with Russian River brewing.

I reached out a few weeks later bc I saw this event happening.
On the day of I felt quite ill after coming home from work. This is how our texts looked;

Me: Hey I apologize, I am actually not feeling the greatest today. Would we be reschedule to Sunday?

Her: I'm busy this whole weekend which is why I asked if you could hang during the week so no I can't sorry, feel better!

Me: Aw I see, enjoy your weekend then! I will be leaving for home on Tuesday for the break but I am available Monday after work if you wanted to do smtng then:)

Me: Ive been meaning to check out some of the restaurants here, if you're free Monday maybe we can check it out!

2 days later*

Me: Hey! Just checking in to see if you might be free tm, I felt terrible cancelling last minute.
No worries if you aren't tho! We can def do smtng another time:)

The next morning*

Her: Hey, appreciate you reaching out. I think I'm gonna step back from making plans, last min cancellations aren't really my thing especially when I went out of my way and rearranged my schedule to give you a ride. So I'd rather leave it here, take care.

Me: I canceled last minute bc I was feeling unwell after work not bc of a shallow reason, I cannot force myself to go out when I am sick and I wouldn't expect that from you either. But l understand, take care.

So please let me know if I am being the asshole. I have also let her know before while making the 2nd plan that I can get my own ride to the venue but she offered to give the ride.

Beginning of Chapter 1:

Emma had always been defined as a plain girl. Since the day she spoke her first words, or  expressed signs of her developing personality, people’s reactions to her were polite. All in all, there was nothing particularly special bout Emma; she seemed to behave how an average, book-defined baby would behave. Even her parent’s were unable to describe Emma’s personality or quirks, since she had none, and they simply called her “sweet” and “nice”. She would cry when she was supposed to, laugh at things considered funny, and reacted appropriately to each scenario she faced, but there was no other substance to Emma. 

As she grew older, her features seemed to match her personality. Emma had mousy brown, medium length hair, which gave an air of ‘safe’ and ‘standardly’. Her eyes were a green hue, but nothing close to a royal emerald green, nor an earthy hazel green. No, Emma’s eyes were a plain, simple green. Her face was ordinary, with no definition; she had no features considered noteworthy or original. She simply faded into the crowds, unnoticeable and indistinguishable. Now, Emma was not an ugly, uninteresting girl and in her twenty three years of age, she had had her fare share of suitors, not to mention the occasional flirt with a customer or two. But she was just…well, that’s it, there were no words to describe her as anything but plain. 

Emma, herself, agreed to this sentiment and thought of herself as a vanilla muffin. It wasn’t a horrible dessert of course, but it was of no comparison to a delicious pie, or a velvety, chocolaty mousse. It was a safe option; not entirely underwhelming, but just enough to curb a sugary craving. Naturally, Emma had moments where she wished we she would take opportunities to stand out and for once in her life, to feel special. But having never been in the spotlight, she confined herself to safe choices and lived her day to day life how she always had. And so, she found comfort and security in her routines, and began to enjoy them.

Emma lived in a modest, one bedroom apartment located in New York City, and worked at a small flower shop named Blooming Buds. She had worked at the store for a little over four years, since she had first arrived to New York for school. She enjoyed working with Belinda, her boss/ friend. During her time at Blooming Buds, Emma realized she had an affinity for working with flowers and plants, and decided to pursue an education in Botany and Horticulture. Once she had graduated, Emma worked at the flower shop full time and planned to stay for a long while. 

Emma awoke early in the morning to prepare for the day and began her daily routines. She showered and brushed her teeth, then checked her email for new articles or information on successful gardening. Once she saw the third  “Where Have All the Flowers Gone!” headline, she checked the clock and put on her powdery blue uniform for work. Pulling her hair into a ponytail, Emma walked to the kitchen to prepare her breakfast: two eggs, toast, and coffee in a plastic to-go cup. The to-go cup was pointless, since Emma always finished her coffee before heading out, but she always felt the need to do so ‘just in case’. Once Emma finished her breakfast she grabbed her bag, left her apartment, and proceeded to the second phase of her morning routine: walking to the nearby coffee shop and buying her second cup of coffee for the day. 

The walking route to Emma’s job was roughly twenty minutes, and on the way she enjoyed sipping her hot beverage while casually viewing the opening stores and cafes, preparing for the influx of customers they’d be receiving. She passed an old book store, with its artificially rustic exterior, and three cafe’s smelling of hot coffee and fresh baked pastries. Saleswomen strategically placed their mannequins behind the display windows, showcasing  dresses in the latest fashion while shop workers swept the doorsteps of their employers. The streets buzzed alive with parents pep talking their children for school and blue collar workers yelling into their phones about mispaychecks. The sounds became increasingly chaotic as the morning progressed and the citizens of New York prepared for their daily tasks  and unforeseen challenges.

As she walked, the sounds of bustling cars and loud phone calls were slowly replaced by the noise of merchants preparing their stands with trinkets and fresh produce at the farmer’s market. This was Emma’s favorite part of her daily walk, since it was less obnoxious in sound and allowed her to genuinely browse the items for sale. She never purchased anything from the kiosks, but she imagined the satisfaction of wearing handmade, original jewelry pieces or biting into a fresh, crumbly strudel on display. Maybe she should look into baking?

  Most of the merchants at the farmers market were regulars, and Emma typically saw them every morning and afternoon on her way to and from work, though she never spoke to any of them. She knew them only by face, since she never inquired for their names, and assigned each of their identities to their prospective sales items.",1,1764008847.0,fantasywriters,3,1.0,False
1p5ovnk,https://i.redd.it/3bnlm2vrx83g1.jpeg,Horizontal bands with exposure shift in developed B&W film,"I've started deveolping film on my own a couple of months ago. I used a Paterson tank with two spirals, and I developed two 35mm rolls at once.

I developed using coffee as a developer (following the suggested times for the film I was developing), and everything seemed to have worked pretty well at first glance.

However, after analyzing the negatives closer, and after scanning them, I noticed two straight horizontal lines in the middle of the frame, where a harsh shift in exposure occurs (see the attached pictures).

This happened **only on the negative inside the upper reel of the tank**. During the 10 minutes of developing, I slowly shaked the tank every 50 seconds for about 10 seconds, putting it back on the table in the same position. Since only the upper reel was affected by this difect, I thought that probably the tank wasn't filled enough with the developer, resulting in different exposures.

So I decided to try a different way on the following develop: I added more developer (until I could see the liquid coming outside of the little hole in the center of the tank), and during the deveolping time a rotated by 180° the tank every 50 seconds after the 10 seconds of shaking.

This resulted in the same difect, but this time **only on the negative inside the lower reel**!

1p5ouxv,https://www.reddit.com/r/BooksPoint/comments/1p5ouxv/looking_for_love_is_a_deep_scar/,Looking for Love is a Deep Scar,"A week before her wedding, Adeline Falcone received an anonymous email.

The moment she clicked the link, the explicit images on the screen made her forget how to breathe.

The link led to a dark website called ""The Beast's Lair,"" filled with graphic videos of men and women. The performers all wore animal masks, their bodies tangled wildly against a stark black background. The scale of it was shocking.

She frantically closed the page, but the afterimage burned into her mind.

In the top trending video, the man in the fox mask—his jawline, his build, even his heavy breathing—was identical to her fiancé, Vincent Costello.

The conference room fell silent. The faces of the other family ""capos"" were grim.

""Adeline, are you alright?""

Adeline forced herself to breathe, managing a weak smile as she continued her report on the family's ""legitimate"" businesses.

But inside, doubt and unease were growing like weeds.

After the meeting, she made an excuse and drove straight home.

Opening the link again, she clutched her three-month pregnant belly and dialed Vincent’s number with a trembling hand.

In the live stream from ""The Beast's Lair,"" a familiar ringtone suddenly sounded.

The man in the fox mask glanced at the screen, tossed the phone aside, and moved with even more force, drawing a series of moans from his partner in the rabbit mask.

The live show lasted for four excruciating hours.

Adeline watched the entire thing, too numb to even stand up.

But when the camera panned across the man's lower abdomen, a wave of relief washed over her.

There was no scar. It wasn't Vincent. She would never mistake the scar on Vincent's body.

A moment later, she heard a key in the front door. Vincent walked in.

His face was stern, his custom-tailored suit perfectly crisp, as if he belonged to a different world than the frenzied man in the video.

Vincent walked over and smiled gently at her.

""Sorry, my love. The meeting with the old-timers ran long, and I didn't get a chance to check my phone. Did you need something?""

Feeling guilty, Adeline quickly shut her laptop. ""Nothing, I just wanted to know when you'd be home.""

She kept telling herself it wasn't Vincent. Vincent loved her too much to ever betray her.

Years ago, she was hit by a stray bullet during a family feud, causing her kidneys to fail. Without telling anyone, he secretly got tested, found he was a match, and gave her one of his kidneys. The first thing he said waking up from the anesthesia was, ""Adeline, I just need you to live. That's enough.""

That's where the scar came from. It was proof of his love, a love he had risked his life for.

Besides, Vincent was known in the family for being cold and disciplined.

The last cocktail waitress who tried to seduce him, who had only brushed her chest against his arm, was ordered to be ""handled"" and thrown into the Hudson River. Afterwards, he scrubbed his arm with rubbing alcohol for an entire hour.

Even when Adeline was being clingy, he would gently push her away. ""My little kitten, don't be so needy. It clouds my judgment.""

He hated the touch of any woman but her. How could a man like that be so wild with a stranger?

""Adeline, what are you thinking about?""

Vincent handed her a glass of milk, his bathrobe hanging open to reveal a powerful chest.

Thinking about the images from today, the anxiety crept back in.

The mattress dipped beside her as Vincent wrapped his arms around her from behind. ""Get some sleep. It's good for our baby.""

Adeline turned over, her hand gently tracing the skin of his lower stomach. The familiar scar was still there. The knot of fear in her chest finally loosened.

Vincent kissed her forehead. ""Why are you always touching my scar? You think it's ugly?""

""No,"" Adeline whispered, snuggling into his arms. ""Vincent, I love you.""

He paused for a second, then chuckled softly, holding her tighter. ""I love you too, Adeline. Only you.""

""Just seven more days, and you'll be the matriarch of the Costello family. Rest up, and be the most beautiful bride in that dress.""

Adeline closed her eyes with a smile.

Maybe the man in the video was just a coincidence. Maybe she was just being paranoid because of the pregnancy.

But in the middle of the night, she woke with a start. The space beside her was empty.

Vincent's shoes were gone from the entryway. He had left.

Her heart pounded in her chest as she scrambled to the computer.

The fox-masked man was streaming again. It was the same woman in the rabbit mask, the two of them tangled together in a passionate embrace.

Even with the mask, the excitement and wildness in the fox's eyes were unmistakable.

They moved through every position imaginable until they were both spent.

She stared intently at the man's stomach.

This time, under the harsh light, the scar was perfectly, horribly clear.

In this video, the woman's voice was distorted by a modulator as she cooed, ""I hate this scar you got for another woman. And you won't even get it lasered off. I have to cover it with concealer for you every time.""

The fox man chuckled, leaning down to kiss her lips. ""I gave you the villa in the West Suburbs. Isn't that enough?""

""Not enough,"" the rabbit woman purred. ""Not unless you promise me we'll do it again in seven days. At your wedding. I'm the maid of honor, after all. No one will ever suspect a thing.""

The fox man was silent for a moment.

The rabbit woman whimpered, and just as she tried to pull away, he grabbed her waist, his movements becoming rougher.

""Fine. Anything you want.""

2、
Adeline felt like she had been plunged into ice water.

The villa in the West Suburbs was Vincent's wedding gift to her, their future home.

And Adeline’s only maid of honor was none other than the woman she trusted with her life, her best friend—Isabella ""Bella"" Rossi.

Bella was the first light in her life. When Adeline’s parents were killed in a family conflict, she was left alone, hiding in a church corner, gnawing on stale bread. It was Bella who dragged her home, who always saved the last piece of meat on her plate for her.

When the neighborhood bullies chased her with a pellet gun, it was Bella who threw up her arm to block the pellet aimed at her eye, getting hurt in the process.

So she trusted Bella more than anyone. They were as close as sisters.

After she met Vincent, Bella had even warned him, ""Adeline is like my own sister. You have to treat her right, or I'll never forgive you. The power of the Costello family doesn't scare me!""

Vincent had shot back, ""Adeline is the love of my life. From now on, please stay away from her. Don't be a bad influence.""

They were always at each other's throats. If Adeline hadn't been there to stop them, they would have pulled guns on each other long ago.

Back then, Adeline felt so lucky. Her best friend and the man she loved both cared about her so deeply.

Now, the video of them together was like a slap across the face.

No wonder Bella was always so vague about her boyfriend, never letting Adeline meet him.

It turned out they shared one.

All the clues clicked into place, forming a suffocating net around her, making it hard to even breathe.

A gasp from the screen broke her trance. The rabbit woman trembled in the fox man's arms before kissing him deeply.

The chat in the livestream exploded with comments.

[Fox is a fucking beast. Second round tonight and still going this hard.]

[Remember when that deer mask chick tried to kiss him and he dodged? I thought he was a germaphobe, but I guess he makes an exception for Rabbit.]

[My favorite couple! Please keep going, this is amazing.]

Adeline slumped in her chair, her heart feeling like it was being sliced apart.

Trembling, she pulled out her phone and dialed a number in Italy.

""About starting a new family business in Europe… I'm in. I'll be there in seven days.""

After hanging up, she contacted a private investigator, an old family loyalist who had worked for her father.

Two hours later, Vincent returned, bringing a chill with him.

He quickly showered, acting as if nothing had happened, then made breakfast and gave Adeline a good-morning kiss.

Adeline couldn't understand why Vincent would betray her with her best friend. They were supposed to hate each other.

After Vincent left, Adeline called Bella.

""Honey, I took the day off just for you. You have no idea what a nightmare your stone-faced fiancé is at work. One tiny mistake and he'll chew you out for an hour! Thank God you gave me an excuse to escape.""

Bella linked arms with her, complaining about how much Vincent overworked her in the family business.

Adeline smelled her perfume; it was the same one Vincent wore. Her fingertips went cold, but she forced herself to sound calm. ""I think Vincent is seeing someone else.""

Bella’s shocked expression didn't seem fake.

""No way! You must be overthinking things because of the pregnancy. Vincent loves you so much. He would never cheat.""

Adeline didn't say anything else, just watched Bella's eyes carefully.

When they ordered drinks, Adeline got Bella her usual: soda water with ice.

""I can't have ice anymore,"" Bella said softly, rubbing her stomach. ""I'm pregnant.""

3、
Her words hit Adeline like a bolt of lightning. ""You're pregnant?""

Bella looked at her, pretending to be shy. ""It was an accident. I'm three months along, too.""

Three months. Her baby was also three months. Bella had gotten pregnant at the same time as her.

""Is the father your boyfriend? I've never even met this new guy.""

With every word, Adeline’s heart trembled a little more.

""Yeah, he's always busy,"" Bella said with a smile, picking up her phone. ""But that's okay. He can't always be with me, but when we do see each other, it’s like he’s trying to devour me to make up for it. I should be happy with that.""

Vincent called, asking where Adeline was, and said he was coming to pick her up.

When he arrived, his face darkened the moment he saw Bella.

""You said you had something urgent to take care of. You meant getting coffee?""

Before Bella could speak, Adeline cut in. ""I asked Bella to go shopping with me. Let's drop her home first.""

""Oh, no, I don't want to be a third wheel,"" Bella said, holding her lower back. ""I'll just get a cab.""

She quickly hailed a taxi and got in before Vincent could say anything.

Adeline noticed Vincent's knuckles were white as he gripped the steering wheel.

He drove slowly, keeping a careful distance behind Bella's cab, as if afraid something would happen to her.

At the next intersection, the taxi driver slammed on his brakes, and Bella seemed to be jolted in the back seat.

Vincent stomped on the brake. The sudden stop threw Adeline forward, the seatbelt cutting painfully into her.

But Vincent didn't even notice her discomfort. He unbuckled his seatbelt and ran towards the taxi.

He knocked on the window, his voice tight with anger.

""Are you insane? I told you not to run around while you're pregnant! Get in my car, now!""

""What's it to you?"" Bella's eyes turned red, her voice cracking. ""You should be taking Adeline home! Leave me alone!""

Vincent clicked his tongue, then simply opened the back door, leaned in, and swept Bella into his arms, carrying her to his car and placing her gently in the back seat.

Only after Bella was settled did he turn to look at Adeline in the passenger seat.

Her face was pale, her lips colorless. She was clutching her cramping stomach, sweat beading on her forehead.

A flicker of panic finally crossed Vincent's eyes. He grabbed her arm. ""Sorry, my love, did I scare you? She's your best friend. I was afraid you'd rush out to help her and hurt yourself, that's why I…""

Bella quickly added, ""I'm so sorry, Adeline. It's all my fault for worrying you.""

Watching them, Adeline felt a bitter irony.

They clearly cared so much for each other, yet they had to pretend it was all for her sake.

She closed her eyes, protecting her small baby bump. ""It's fine. Just take her home.""

Vincent was obviously distracted while driving, his expression growing heavier.

After dropping Bella off, he seemed to relax and drove Adeline home.

They didn't speak a word. Back at their house, Vincent hugged her from behind.

""Adeline, are you still mad at me? I'm sorry, I was just worried. You said she's the only family you have left. I was scared she would get hurt and you'd be upset. It was just an impulse.""

Adeline's chest felt like it had been hit with a sledgehammer, a dull, aching pain.

He had clearly seen how uncomfortable the sudden stop had made her, yet his eyes kept flicking to Bella in the rearview mirror.

It was so obvious who he cared about more.

""Vincent, let's call…""

Before she could say the words ""call off the wedding,"" Vincent's phone rang. His face changed instantly.

""My love, something urgent came up with the family. I have to go handle it. Wait for me at home!""

He bolted out the door. Adeline's heart clenched. She went to the study and pulled up the security feed for the West Suburbs villa.

Of course. He had gone to Bella. As soon as he was inside, his voice was filled with concern. ""Is your stomach hurting? Let me see. Was it from the car ride?""

He held Bella tenderly, rubbing her belly. Bella leaned into him and whispered, ""You were so obvious today. Do you think Adeline suspects anything?""

Instantly, Vincent's face turned cold, and he put some distance between them. ""She won't find out. And you are not to see her alone again!""

""Why not? Adeline is my best friend. Are you saying I can't see her just because of you?""

""She's pregnant!"" Vincent hissed. ""I can't have you saying the wrong thing and stressing her out.""

""But I'm pregnant too!"" Bella's voice was tearful. ""Doesn't my baby matter? You knew I was pregnant and you still came to me. Don't you care about my feelings at all?""

The air went still. After a long moment, Vincent spoke in a heavy voice. ""This child's existence was a mistake.""

""Vincent, you bastard!"" Bella cried, hitting him. But a moment later, the sounds of them kissing filled the room, followed by the rustle of clothing.

""Be a good girl. Get rid of the baby. I'll give you enough money to live comfortably for the rest of your life.""

Bella was silent for a second, then wrapped her arms around his neck and kissed him. ""But I hate procedures. I'd rather you help me take care of it. I heard… if we do it enough times, it'll just go away on its own…""

Vincent cursed under his breath, but still swept her into his arms and slammed the bedroom door shut.

A second later, a text from him popped up on her phone.

[My love, I have to work late at the family office tonight. Get some rest. Love you.]

The words ""Love you"" were in black, but to Adeline, they burned a blood-red.

A wave of nausea washed over her, and she doubled over, dry heaving.

How pathetic. Their secret hookup spot was the very house she was supposed to move into in seven days. Her marital home.

Her heart ached as if it were being torn apart. Adeline felt the cold, salty sting of tears on her face.

Just then, the private investigator sent her a message.

**Why This Pick?**

Miami is the far better team here, friends. The Heat have been on fire offensively while Dallas has lost 7 of their last 10. Have they kept some close games? Sure – but they haven’t been putting nearly as many points on the board as Miami. And I know, Miami is on a back-to-back, but that hasn’t stopped them from putting points on the board in recent past (see Nov 7 & 8, 2025). Having scored less than 100 points in 2 of their last 4 outings, I just don’t see the Mavericks keeping up here. I’m on the home team to cover.

1p5oqf9,https://www.reddit.com/r/espresso/comments/1p5oqf9/moving_on_from_automatic_espresso_500/,Moving on from automatic espresso [500€],"Hello, 

I've had my Melitta caffeo solo for quite some time now and it broke (too bothersome to repair this time) so I'm looking to move on from automatic espresso. 

I love coffee but in the espresso world I'm really new and even if I've been digging YouTube and forums these days I still have some unanswered questions. 

I'm planning to buy a df54 for the grinding as I understood for this price point I won't get anything better. (Still I'm open to suggestions I haven't bought it yet) 

For the espresso machine itself is where the questions starts. I only know what I've been told  : 
Boiler is usually better than thermo block for temperature and pressure stability and longevity 
But it takes longer to heat 

I've had a few models I've seen stand out : DeLonghi ECP 35.31 (of 3420), Breville Bambino, Bambino plus 
The deLonghi looks good because it's cheap and has a boiler 
But the other two are more recommended, can someone explain me why exactly they are better ? 
And what would I gain spending this much more money ? 
I don't have unlimited budget but I can stretch to 400/500€ is It really is worth it 

If you have more recommendations please do and explain why they are better (I like to understand things) 

Sorry if it was a bit messy or unclear and thanks in advance for your answers 😊",1,1764008477.0,espresso,2,1.0,False

The Culprit Was a Single Typo.,"It was 2 AM, and the only light in my apartment was the cold, accusatory glow of my monitor. I was on hour six of debugging a critical payment processing bug. Every time I ran the script, it would fail silently. No error message, no log, just… nothing. The digital equivalent of a shrug. My coffee was cold, my eyes felt like sandpaper, and I was starting to believe the code was haunted by a ghost who really, really hated online transactions.

I went through everything. I mean, EVERYTHING. I tore apart the logic, scrutinizing every 'if' and 'else' until the words blurred together. I checked the database connections, the API endpoints, and even the server's network logs, half-expecting to see a message that just said 'Nope.' The pressure was immense; this feature was supposed to go live in the morning, and my part was the critical final piece. The feeling of dread was so thick I could almost taste it, like burnt toast and failure.

Finally, defeated, I slumped back in my chair, ready to draft the most humiliating Slack message of my life. As a last-ditch, muscle-memory effort, I scrolled through the config file one more time. My eyes glazed over the lines of code I'd already read a hundred times. And then I saw it. A single variable, `PAYMENT_GATEWAY_URL`. Except, in the script, I had been calling `PAYMENT_GATEWAY_URI`. One. Single. Letter. The difference between 'L' and 'I' had cost me my sanity for an entire evening.

The wave of relief was immediately followed by a wave of feeling like the world's biggest idiot. I corrected the typo, ran the script, and watched in awe as it executed perfectly. The terminal lit up with green 'SUCCESS' messages, and I just sat there, laughing like a madman in the dead silence of my apartment. It was fixed, but at what cost?

So, Reddit, what's the most embarrassingly simple bug that ever completely broke your brain?",1,1764008297.0,u_Leather-Buddy-7902,0,1.0,False
