1ndf8i9,https://www.reddit.com/r/production/comments/1ndf8i9/i_built_the_platform_i_wish_i_had_starting_out/,I built the platform I wish I had starting out.,"Hey everyone,

Like a lot of people, I picked up a new hobby during COVID. My initial goal was simple: to make a song. And I wanted to make my own beat for it first. The funny thing is, I got so hooked on producing in FL Studio that I never even started writing the actual song.

I still remember all the terrible beats I made, but I stuck with it. I don't necessarily consider myself a pro now, but after making hundreds of beats, I've at least got some experience and know what creators need. I used to focus solely on drill & melodic rap, but now I mainly create samples with my guitar (still learning). You can check out some of my old youtube stuff here:¬†[`https://www.youtube.com/@caehdo8468`](https://www.youtube.com/@caehdo8468)

My day job is as a software developer, so I decided to combine my skills and passion to build something I wish I had from day one: a platform that‚Äôs affordable (100% free right now), has everything a creator needs in one place, and is built simply because I just enjoy making things.

That‚Äôs why my friends and I have been pouring our time into¬†[**Untitledwav.com**](https://www.untitledwav.com/)

. We're ambitious, and our goal is to build the ultimate¬†**one-stop shop**¬†for music creators.

**Our Full Vision For The Near Future:**

* **The Ultimate Sound Library:**¬†This is the foundation. It‚Äôs a place to share your own sounds and discover unique loops from other creators. By uploading your work, you can get paid from our creator payout pool‚Äî**visit the site to**¬†[**learn more**](https://www.untitledwav.com/welcome)¬†**about how it works!**¬†It's not just user uploads either; our A&R team will be constantly working to bring in exclusive, high-quality sample packs from industry professionals to give you a curated, pro-level library.
* **A Seamless Beat Store:**¬†We're building a fully integrated marketplace for you to sell your beats. You'll be able to manage your catalog, set your prices, and connect with artists right here.
* **A Thriving Community Hub:**¬†This is more than just a forum. It‚Äôll be a place to post your tracks for feedback, find collaborators, read articles on tips and tricks, learn about the best new VSTs, and (we hope!) get exclusive discount codes. A real space to learn and grow.

**Why It's FREE (for now):**¬†Right now, the¬†**sample sharing**¬†feature is live, with drum kits coming very soon. We're keeping everything 100% free because a community platform is nothing without its community. We need you ‚Äì real creators ‚Äì to upload your sounds, download others, and, yes, even break things! Your feedback is gold, and it helps us build this thing right.

**What's Next on the Roadmap?**¬†After drum kits, we're going full-steam ahead on the beat store and the community hub. The other big feature my friends and I are really excited about is an¬†**AI-powered sample discovery tool**. Imagine going beyond simple tags and being able to search for ""Old school vocal sample in the style of BigXthaPlug"" That's the future we're building.

**We need your help to build this vision!**

* **Check out the platform:**¬†[`https://www.untitledwav.com/`](https://www.untitledwav.com/)
* **Upload your samples:**¬†Be one of the first to contribute to the library.
* **Download and experiment:**¬†Find some new inspiration for your next track.
* **Give us feedback:**¬†Seriously, tell us what you love, what you hate, and what you want to see! You will be able to provide feedback through the site. Click the coffee mug at the bottom right of the page to leave feedback.

This is a passion project built by creators for creators. We can't wait to see you there and build this community together. Thanks for reading!

I picked up C60 in olive oil after reading way too many rabbit holes about antioxidants and aging. I wasn't looking for anything dramatic, just curious if I'd notice anything at all. The first few weeks felt normal enough, nothing wild to report.

Then something odd happened. I realized I wasn't doing my usual mid-afternoon crash anymore. Normally around 3pm I'd zone out, rub my eyes, and basically count the minutes until I could call it quits. But one day I looked up from my screen and it was almost 6, and I hadn't even thought about coffee. That was the first ""wait, what?"" moment.

The bottle I went with came from SES Research since they've been around longer than most and at least have their stuff tested properly. I poured it into the routine with my morning shake. What I didn't expect was how sneaky the shifts would be. Little things like recovering faster after runs or not feeling as foggy after a night out started stacking up until I realized it wasn't coincidence anymore.

Here's the kicker: I tested skipping it for a week, and the crash came back. It wasn't placebo either, because I didn't even connect the dots until day four when I caught myself yawning like crazy in the middle of the afternoon again.

Anyway, I'm not saying it's a wonder drug, but it's been one of those ""quiet hacks"" that just works in the background. Anyone else here actually experimented with C60 long enough to notice those less-obvious shifts?",1,1757513338.0,Biohackers,1,1.0,False

So, I‚Äôve been struggling a lot with loneliness and I could really use some advice.

In the past, I used to be very introverted, insecure, and even dealt with depression and a minor psychosis. Because of that, I didn‚Äôt make many friends. My financial situation is also not great, which makes it even harder.

I‚Äôve tried meeting people online (Facebook, chat sites, etc.), but it hasn‚Äôt worked out well. I don‚Äôt have a job, studies, or outside activities at the moment, so meeting people in person feels extra difficult.

1ndf69n,https://i.redd.it/vbo253f3hcof1.jpeg,AUTOMAT BY Edward Hopper: A Quiet Moment Of Solitude And Mystery,"Hey r/Artforeveryone_! After our awesome chat about Nighthawks, I‚Äôm back with another Edward Hopper classic: Automat (1927). This painting feels like a quiet, thoughtful cousin to Nighthawks, and I‚Äôm excited to hear what you think! üôå


Automat shows a woman sitting alone at a self-service restaurant, called an automat, popular in the early 1900s. She‚Äôs wearing a coat and hat, staring into her coffee cup under bright artificial lights. The dark window behind her reflects almost nothing, making the scene feel both private and lonely. Hopper‚Äôs use of light and shadow gives it a moody, almost movie-like atmosphere. It‚Äôs like we‚Äôre secretly watching a personal moment. üñºÔ∏è


What‚Äôs so powerful about Automat is how it makes us wonder about this woman‚Äôs story. Is she waiting for someone? Thinking about something? Or just grabbing a quick coffee before heading back to the city? The painting captures solitude but leaves lots open to interpretation. Hopper‚Äôs skill is in making us curious, and I‚Äôd love to know what you see in this piece! 

This wonderful piece of art has left us mesmerized with questions like 

‚Ä¢What feelings does Automat evoke for you? Does it feel melancholic, peaceful, or something else entirely?

‚Ä¢If you could give this woman a backstory, who is she? Where‚Äôs she coming from or going to? Feel free to get creative!

FUN FACT: Automats were all the rage in the 1920s for their futuristic, coin-operated food service. Does knowing this context add anything to how you view the painting?

Share your thoughts below! Whether you‚Äôre new to art or a Hopper fan, let‚Äôs unpack this masterpiece together. Bonus points if you‚Äôve got any cool trivia about Automat or Hopper‚Äôs work to share. Let‚Äôs make this thread as lively as our Nighthawks chat! üòä

My partner and I were both underwhelmed with the tasting and my mother, who is paying, was a bit shell-shocked by the price. She's also a trained chef and will have high standards for food that I'm concerned won't be met at the price point she's comfortable with. Both of our quotes were about $9k for food, but one quote also included bartending and one didn't. 

Would it be insane to throw together a DIY brunch thing instead? My partner and I can get drop-in catering from our favorite local salad place for less than $1k. They are very hearty/substantial salads, and it would be very easy to accommodate our vegan guests. We would also do a bagel bar with fresh bagels delivered from a local bagel place, with cream cheese/capers/lox/red onions available for guests to put on their bagel. Partner also wants to do a coffee and tea station, with emphasis on the tea. A few different unique teas to choose from with sugar cubes and cream. 

For appetizers, I was thinking a Costco charcuterie spread with meats/cheeses/veggie platters/fruit. 

I'm thinking we can get servers from a staffing agency to manage the buffet, bus tables, and cut the cake. I already have the name of the staffing agency one of the caterers uses. We would also need to rent platters and serving supplies. 

The biggest issue I can see is preparing the bagel toppings and charcuterie the day before. We have the venue however long we want the day before, and it has a full commercial kitchen, so I was thinking about maybe hiring a couple of culinary students to do a quick prep gig for a few hours that afternoon. Just arrange things on the platters and blanch the veggies, stuff like that, so everything is waiting in the fridge for the servers to bring out on the day of. My mom would want to do this herself, but I think it's too much pressure for her to do it alone, and she would be comfortable supervising people for this as long as they were semi-competent in the kitchen. 

My question is, is this an insane plan? Is there anything obviously bad about this? I think the food is guaranteed to be better than the traditional catering we've looked at. Honestly neither of us were excited at all about the caterers we've been able to find, but I'm reluctant to give up the dates because I'm nervous there's something obvious I'm missing that makes this plan unreasonable. Can someone please poke holes in it for me? ",1,1757513202.0,Weddingsunder10k,1,1.0,False

Cynthia lives to undo the immortality, to design a spell that will slay the¬†*undying*¬†death. Being a genius in rune magic is not enough, nor is the title of the youngest rune scholar. She needs to become something more.

The Death Knights exist to extinguish all life. The hollow vessels of doom veer toward civilization, bearing the flames of damnation. The seals of old times have come loose. The world is on the brink of war, the war once fought and won‚Äîif a shattered world and crippled civilization, yet recovering after millennia, could be considered that. The rulers claim them as myths, hiding their destruction in hopes of clinging to the wheel of the sinking ship until their final breath.

Cynthia wants to find a final solution, and there is no price she will hesitate to pay. But first, she needs to find a way to get rid of the screen that the System wants her to keep in the center of her vision at all times.

*The White Reaper is a journey. There are triumphs on the path, and pain and loss. The journey can be grim sometimes, but if you stick around long enough, you will witness the young scholar evolve into a world-renowned mage, magic spells that will flatten cities in a blink, and battles that will reshape the world. One step at a time.*

# Chapter 5

**\[Time Remaining: 2117:45\]**

‚ÄúNo. I will not.‚Äù

‚ÄúWhat? Why?‚Äù Chris stared at her in bewilderment. ‚ÄúLook,‚Äù he tapped on the chart‚Äîa list of spell types and their desirability, which Chris had procured from a friend of his. Of course, Elise had told Chris and Nirya about their conversation, and Chris had a connection in an auction house in the Night Bazaar, an unregulated market.

The mage spells were in highest demand. In contrast to a normal spell that required runejades, a mage spell had runes etched into the bones of the mage, allowing a mage to cast as many times as they wished.

Cynthia‚Äôs lightless eyes peered at Chris. He didn‚Äôt seem perturbed by the idea.

‚ÄúWhat‚Äôs the issue, Cyn?‚Äù Elise raised her brow, scooping a bite of her chocolate cake. ‚ÄúIt can‚Äôt be more complicated than what you already did?‚Äù

‚ÄúWill you let a rune scribe carve a rune on your sternum, Chris?‚Äù Chris shook his head immediately, ‚ÄúCan you imagine what kind of desperate vice for power one must have to accept the damned process of having your bones tattooed with a nail?‚Äù

Elise and Chris shared a look, then burst into laughter. ‚ÄúYou think people use mage spells to commit crimes? Oh, Chris, did you catch that?‚Äù

Chris choked on his grape juice. He coughed. Gasped. ‚ÄúI was about to die,‚Äù he said, wiping his nose with the sleeve of his shirt.

‚ÄúShame,‚Äù Nirya quipped. She was having some kind of melted syrup that they sold in the name of cake.

‚ÄúIt‚Äôs not like if you don‚Äôt auction one, there wouldn‚Äôt be someone else. You‚Äôre just overthinking it.‚Äù

Cynthia shrugged. ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt do half-hearted work. If I design a spell, it will cause ten times the harm as compared to someone who is just trying to make money.‚Äù

‚ÄúI am all for not being responsible for the buyer‚Äôs use of spell, but if Cyn isn‚Äôt interested, we shouldn‚Äôt force her,‚Äù Nirya said.

‚ÄúMage spells are twice the normal offensive spells. I bet we can have a party on the upper floors with that kind of money.‚Äù

‚ÄúUpper floors are reserved for legacy mages and the nobility,‚Äù Nirya uttered discontentedly, ‚ÄúAnd that‚Äôs the only reason you even care about it in the first place. You were squealing about the ice cream just a minute ago.‚Äù

‚ÄúYeah, so?‚Äù Elise glared. ‚ÄúThere‚Äôs a secret menu, and they get have even tastier things.‚Äù

‚ÄúI can get us there,‚Äù Chris winked. ‚ÄúJust say the word when you have the money...‚Äù

The server cleared his throat, staring down at Chris. He served Cynthia her coffee and another pastry for Elise.

‚ÄúFor someone who hates anything remotely bitter with a vengeance, I am surprised you like coffee,‚Äù Nirya said, taking a sip of her pitch-black coffee without so much as a shadow of emotion on her face.

‚ÄúShe even hates chocolate without a horseshit amount of sugar in it,‚Äù Elise glared accusingly.

‚ÄúI despise its taste,‚Äù Cynthia said. ‚ÄúBut, curiously enough, I like despising it.‚Äù

‚ÄúWhy?‚Äù Chris asked. ‚ÄúDon‚Äôt give me that ‚Äòto study‚Äô bullcrap. Not even all the dead gods can convince me coffee makes anyone smarter.‚Äù

‚ÄúWhy would losers convince you of anything?‚Äù Nirya quirked her brow. ‚ÄúAnd it does make you smarter, or rather, you need to be on a certain level of intellect to appreciate the bitterness. So, it is more like a smartness check.‚Äù

Elise scoffed, breathing phantom fire through her nose. ‚ÄúI am very interested in trying your smartass, wanna have a go?‚Äù

‚ÄúIn this place? Ah, you make me blush,‚Äù Nirya‚Äôs brows rose in faux surprise.

Elise‚Äôs lips twisted in disgust. She grabbed a tissue and spat her whole mouthful into it. ‚ÄúBitch!‚Äù

Chris slapped on the parchment. ‚ÄúCan we focus‚Äî‚Äù

‚ÄúDon‚Äôt pretend as if you didn‚Äôt derail the conversation in the first place,‚Äù Elise growled, snapping her head at Cynthia. ‚ÄúIf not mage spells, do you want to work on offensive spells?‚Äù

Cynthia hummed, for some reason unable to say no. Her eyes wandered down the list. What she wanted to work on was a different thing, at the bottom rung of the desirability‚Äîwarding spells. Yet it was so little desired, she felt as though it would ruin their moods. Not Elise, but Chris would definitely be upset. The offensive spells were the simplest type of magics, well, the ones which would sell in an auction house.

‚ÄúWhat is it?‚Äù Chris prodded.

Cynthia sipped her coffee. ‚ÄúThe thing I am interested in right now‚Ä¶ is a warding spell.‚Äù

Chris blinked. Elise almost let out a startled yelp. And Nirya giggled at Elise‚Äôs reaction.

‚ÄúI thought you wanted money,‚Äù Chris said after a moment. His lips held more words that he didn‚Äôt say out loud, yet Cynthia could feel them. The disappointment. Unraveling excitement. And the bitter rage for going through the work.

‚ÄúI do. At the same time, the best kind of spells are warding‚Äîeven in the most destructive wars, the first thing any capable strategist focuses on is the warding of the territory and the camp.‚Äù

‚ÄúDo you really think people buying in the under market give two damns about so-called‚Äî‚Äù

‚ÄúChris,‚Äù Nirya uttered, ‚ÄúNight Bazaar is only unregulated so far as it benefits Nobility and their blood kins. If you think a market of such lavish riches is ignored simply because no one can be bothered to tax them, you need to attend economics lectures. There is a good chance a minor noble or someone high in the ministry would attend the auction, just to get a whiff of what‚Äôs on the market.‚Äù

Chris frowned, and Elise matched his questioning face.

‚ÄúYou think a warding spell has a chance?‚Äù Chris asked, passing his initial shock.

‚ÄúPessimistically hopeful.‚Äù

‚ÄúYeah, we should let Cyn do her thing,‚Äù Elise concluded. ‚ÄúDoesn‚Äôt matter if she doesn‚Äôt make money. She hasn‚Äôt been to Night Bazaar, it will be fun regardless.‚Äù

‚ÄúWell, it‚Äôs three against one. That‚Äôs dishonorable. Cyn‚Ä¶ can‚Äôt you take my side?‚Äù

‚ÄúAgainst myself?‚Äù Cynthia smiled.

Chris made an overly distraught face and slumped, slurping his juice in one breath. ‚ÄúFine. I just don‚Äôt think there‚Äôs a point in taking the low moral road for chump change. This weekend, right?‚Äù

‚ÄúI can finish it by tomorrow evening.‚Äù

‚ÄúDon‚Äôt!‚Äù Elise slapped the back of Cynthia‚Äôs head. ‚ÄúWe have an entire week. Mr. Orged said you need sleep.‚Äù

‚ÄúThen, I will let him know,‚Äù Chris said.¬†

‚ÄúThanks.‚Äù

Chris excused himself after they left the eatery. Nirya had ordered a book that she needed to pick up, so she separated along the way.

‚ÄúStill, warding, can‚Äôt say I am surprised,‚Äù Elise said. She stared at a kitten atop the tree, sleeping like a bird. ‚ÄúBut, warding magic is easy, isn‚Äôt it? Why would anyone buy it from an auction?‚Äù

‚ÄúIt‚Äôs simple on the surface. Every magic that safeguards someone or something is a warding magic. A definition so broad allows for very interesting types of spells.‚Äù

‚ÄúOh.‚Äù

Cynthia smiled. ‚ÄúI will show you after the auction.‚Äù

‚ÄúShow?‚Äù

Cynthia‚Äôs smile widened. Elise pestered her the entire way to quarters basically begging to learn about it, but Cynthia didn‚Äôt budge. She was curious about the worth of the spell before she showed it to her friends.

Beside the dorm building, there was a training area for knights. Elise parted ways. Despite being a mage class, Elise seemed particularly interested in the knight courses. Though Elise had no hope of ever becoming one.

She had the room to herself, so she decided to check the package from Durran. She didn‚Äôt receive much communication from them, never anything urgent. And Cynthia was sure Elise would want to know what it said, because she would be curious.

Her fingers paused on the seal. It was different. With a stroke of her quill, the seal cut open. She found a book inside the carton. Its cover felt smooth, a stony surface that was eerily similar to the Academy Spire. There was a limited amount of Trorjadite in the world, and all of it had been used by the Lesterforge already. It was far too precious to be wasted on the cover. But Cynthia was sure it was not from Durran. She checked the package and it was presented like delivered from Durran.

There was faint scarring on the smooth surface. It felt intentional. She picked up her inkpot, and with a brush, she painted over the cover lightly, careful not to fill the etchings.

Her breath shuddered. She looked back at the door. Checked its lock, and then returned to her desk. She mulled over the rune. ‚ÄúThe Origin And The Spirit. The Origin Spirit, Origin of Spirit?‚Äù

It could mean any of those things, and perhaps there was another way to string it that she might be blanking on. ‚ÄúWho sent this...‚Äù

She wiped the blood with a rag and a solution that removed blood ink without ruining the runejades. Then, she flipped it open. She stared long and hard. Felt the page with her finger. Smooth as glass, white and blank. Was it delivered to her from the paper factory?

Cynthia shuddered. She turned the page. One at a time, then flipped it end to end. It was completely blank. She would‚Äôve considered it a stupid joke by Elise, if not for the complexity of the rune on the cover. It had to be carved by someone in the upper echelon of rune scholars, if not a sage. A letter fell out from between the pages.¬†¬†

*Hidden among these pages, you will find answers to further your query, Miss Frost. You may have questions regarding me. You might already know my fate, depending on when you read this. I apologize for skipping our meeting. Perhaps fate only wishes it be you alone who finds the answer. You will find it, I know. It is not the Academy‚Äôs or Lesterforge‚Äôs property any more than it is mine or yours. Keep it safe until the day you find the ink stolen from these pages. The ink that will bring a new dawn to this sunless land.*

*Always look over your shoulder. I am at Sageroot village. I will flee The Forge once the heatwaves die out.*

The final line read, beneath it was a practiced signature of Professor Ruthen‚Äîto assure her that it was indeed him.

She read it again. Set the letter back into the blank book. Why would he send her the book, or a stolen artefact? Did he know more about her than she had thought? She picked up the book and set it on her bookshelf beside the case with Grey Needle.

She stared out at the evening sun setting behind the cage-like walls of Lesterforge. She wrote a letter to Durran, informing her guardian of this mistake and her plans for the future. In case of her death, she would prefer her grave be at home, beside her sister. She wrote another one for Elise and left it on Elise‚Äôs desk.

She took a shower. Picked out a set of clothes. A dusk blue shirt, adorned with a repeating pattern of interlocked kite shapes on both sleeves, a glyph sewn inside each box. It fit perfectly around her frame, reaching below her waist. She pulled down the round collar with a finger. She tried a skirt below, sighed at how awkward it looked. The residents of Durran all wore skirts, and it looked beautiful on their frame. But not around her. *Someday.* She folded it and hung it back in the wardrobe. Deciding to settle on a pair of black trousers that a man would love. She found them inoffensive, but that was true for most pieces of clothing she had.¬†¬†

She left the letter with Miss Caroline, the dormmother. She made her way to the barn at the outskirts of the academy grounds.

It was almost night by that time, past the time to take the steeds. But she was allowed in.

‚ÄúDo you have the permit?‚Äù The barnkeeper asked.

Cynthia paused. It had completely escaped her mind. If she left, it was most likely that she would be able to leave tomorrow morning. A bitter current coursed through her nerves as she unzipped her handbag. ‚ÄúHow long have you been working here as barnkeeper?‚Äù

His eyes narrowed in apprehension. As a barnkeeper with no notable background, the last thing anyone in his position would wish was bad blood with students, many of whom might be offspring of a legacy mage or an actual mage. ‚ÄúThree‚Ä¶ Ma‚Äôam.‚Äù

Cynthia smiled. ‚ÄúThat‚Äôs quite commendable. Our dorm janitor changes every couple of months, you know.‚Äù

‚ÄúWhat are you trying to say, Ma‚Äôam? I am doing my job.‚Äù

Cynthia shrugged. ‚ÄúNothing. Just that you should be cautious, and‚Äî‚Äù Cynthia placed her Student ID. ‚Äú‚ÄîI would never want you to *lose* your job, or worse, for something as small as upholding worthless rules.‚Äù

His face lost all shades of life as he took in her rank. He stared up at her dumbly. His mouth opened and closed a few times.

‚ÄúI am leaving urgently,‚Äù Cynthia said, wearing the most polite smile she could muster. Her stomach twisted like a lizard‚Äôs cut-off tail. ‚ÄúSo, I would appreciate it if you could help me a little.‚Äù

‚ÄúI will lose my job if I...‚Äù

Cynthia knew. She wanted to promise she would get him another job, but she had already taken a step too far. She should apologize and rest for the night. But she should‚Äôve read the letter yesterday. It was a day late already. ‚ÄúChris Westborn, you know him, I presume.‚Äù

He nodded.

Everyone did. Somehow, that guy had the time to make an impression on everyone in the academy. ‚ÄúTell him what you need and my name. He will take care of everything.‚Äù

The barnkeeper seemed hesitant.

Cynthia sighed, picking up her student ID. As she was about to apologize, the barnkeeper rang the bell. The wooden door leading inside opened.

Cynthia thanked him politely before rushing into the synthetic grassland.

There were dozens of birds, about as tall as Cynthia, dozing off on the green grass. Their heads were hidden under the feathers. Soft whistling snores echoed around the barn like crickets. The owl-like birds were called Ruri, the tamed species of magical creatures who loved flying and companionship. They were something of a mix between an eagle and an owl in their stature, with an overgrown feathery body that made them seem like a ball of feathers when sleeping.

Cynthia approached toward the biggest among them.

‚ÄúHey,‚Äù Cynthia waved at the bird. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs been a while, Willow.‚Äù

Not that long, she had been here to feed the feathery delight three days ago, before the countdown began. Willow cooed. She lowered her beak and pushed Cynthia‚Äôs chest. She tumbled on her back. Willow‚Äôs light green eyes glared at her. Then, she looked away, cooing in disappointment.

‚ÄúSorry, I was in a hurry,‚Äù Cynthia uttered as she propped herself back on her feet, dusting herself. ‚ÄúI will get you something to eat on the way.‚Äù

Willow‚Äôs eyes gleamed as she turned back to Cynthia.

‚ÄúWe are going to the Sage Cliffs to the south.‚Äù

Once the tender unlatched the strap attached to Willow‚Äôs tail, Cynthia climbed on Willow‚Äôs back.

‚ÄúAbout the saddle‚Äî‚Äù The barnkeeper jumped back as Willow spread her wings.

‚ÄúDon‚Äôt worry about it!‚Äù

All the Ruris chirped in unison‚Äîsharp and melancholic.

‚ÄúQuite many friends you have made, Willow,‚Äù Cynthia said, a pang of guilt welled up inside her.¬†

Ruris were unusually friendly creatures. They could form hundreds of bonds by the time Cynthia would feel comfortable addressing someone by their name informally.

They soon flew over the walls of Lesterforge, which would be impossible for anyone or anything without permission from the Lord Mayor or one of his many eyes. Of course, Willow had been here for a year and a half, and Cynthia had been careful to have her vetted by the academy as trustworthy.

The first barrier surrounded only the First District. The second wrapped around the entire Lesterforge. The city was magnificent in the night, but there was something far more breathtaking that Cynthia hadn‚Äôt seen in quite some time.

The pale moon, which was tinted blue by the wards around the city. One of its sides was shattered as if a giant pillar had punched through it. A trail of debris from the after still circled around it like a trail of sparkling light in the river of space.¬†¬†

At the end of the trail, there was a gaping, pulsing wound in the sky. About half the size of the moon, pitch black compared to the blue of the night sky. It seemed as though it swelled toward the land like a lump of horrid flesh hanging in the ceiling. Yet, light caught in its fissure fractured into a dull, dry rainbow coiling and sinking towards its bottomless core.

The wound was an aftermath of the strongest spell ever conceived by humanity, by the strongest mage in recorded history, who still breathed in the same world as Cynthia. Something about just the thought was harrowing. How did it feel to live as the strongest mage alive? Be a faction of equal weight as The Council of Five Sages and their endless troops and riches just by lonesome.¬†

I've been tracking my symptoms closely, and there's a pattern I can't ignore: my brain fog, inflammation, urination frequency, and cortisol spikes consistently worsen on days when I drink multiple cups of coffee. At first, I blamed it on caffeine sensitivity, but then I discovered something more disturbing.

Studies show that **56-100% of coffee beans** are contaminated with mycotoxins [\[source\]](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC8605134/)[\[source\]](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/25553918/)[\[source\]](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0956713508002818).¬†

Possible culprits hiding in a cup:

* Aflatoxin B1 - Potent liver toxin and carcinogen
* Ochratoxin A - Attacks kidneys, nervous system, and immune function
* Fumonisin - Destroys cellular membrane integrity
* Patulin - Neurotoxic with immunosuppressive effects

Contamination levels vary wildly between brands and batches. But for those of us with CIRS and compromised detoxification pathways, even ""acceptable"" levels could be triggering inflammatory cascade.

My experiment: I've been coffee-free for two months now. My symptoms are much better. Coincidence? Maybe. But given what we know about mold sensitivity in CIRS, it makes perfect sense.

# Coffee To Water Ratio

Choosing the right coffee to water ratio is crucial for brewing. It affects the taste and strength of your coffee. A 30-cup percolator needs careful measurements. This ensures a delightful cup every time. Let‚Äôs explore the ideal ratios.

# Standard Measurements

For a 30-cup percolator, standard measurements are key. Use about 2 tablespoons of coffee for every 6 ounces of water. This is the usual ratio for a balanced taste. In a 30-cup percolator, you‚Äôll need about 1.5 cups of coffee grounds. This ensures a smooth and flavorful brew.

# Adjusting For Strength

Some prefer a stronger coffee taste. You can adjust the coffee amount. Add more coffee grounds for a bolder flavor. Try 3 tablespoons per 6 ounces for a stronger brew. Remember, too much can make it bitter. Experiment to find your perfect strength.

# Types Of Coffee

Brewing coffee in a 30-cup percolator requires about 2. 5 scoops of coffee per cup. This ensures a rich flavor. Adjust to taste if needed, but this is a good starting point for most coffee lovers.

When brewing coffee in a 30-cup percolator, understanding the types of coffee can significantly influence the taste of your final brew. Different coffee types can alter the strength, aroma, and overall flavor profile. Whether you‚Äôre a casual coffee drinker or a connoisseur, knowing what kind of coffee to use can make all the difference.

1ndezcy,https://www.reddit.com/r/u_kppackaging123/comments/1ndezcy/brewing_a_packaging_shift/,Brewing a Packaging Shift,"*Brewing Change*

A quiet revolution is reshaping the way small food businesses package their products. From independent coffee roasters to artisanal bakeries and farmers‚Äô market vendors, more brands are replacing traditional plastic or foil with high-performance paper options.¬†

One driver of this shift is the innovation in moisture-resistant, food-safe paper materials. For example,[¬†poly coated kraft paper manufacturers](https://kppackaging.com/mg-kraft)¬†are producing packaging that combines eco-conscious qualities with the durability needed to keep food fresh. This blend of function and environmental responsibility makes it easier for small brands to compete with larger players. Meanwhile, the protective power of extrusion coating lamination ensures products can handle the journey from producer to customer without compromise.¬†

Independent caf√©s have long focused on the quality of their beans and brewing methods. Packaging used to be an afterthought, often limited to basic bags or plastic-lined pouches. Now, many are moving toward premium paper solutions that align with their brand‚Äôs sustainability values while maintaining product quality.

The shift isn‚Äôt just about looking eco-friendly. It‚Äôs about materials that perform. That‚Äôs where coated kraft paper comes in. This material resists grease and moisture while providing an ideal printing surface for labels and logos. It helps coffee bags hold their shape, protects the beans, and maintains a clean, artisanal appearance.

*From Market Stall to Retail Shelf*

Farmers‚Äô market sellers face a different set of challenges. When products like bread, fruit, or confectionery are sold directly to customers, packaging requirements are minimal. However, moving into retail outlets requires stronger materials to withstand transport, storage, and extended shelf life.

Here,¬†[extrusion coating lamination](https://kppackaging.com/)¬†makes a difference. Applying a thin, protective layer to the paper adds durability without changing the look and feel of the packaging. This technique keeps goods safe from moisture and air, extending shelf life while maintaining a recyclable or compostable profile.¬†

In sustainable packaging, the challenge has always been combining environmental responsibility with high performance. Traditional plastics offer durability but raise concerns about waste, while plain paper can fail in humid or greasy conditions. Today‚Äôs paper technologies are closing that gap.

The latest solutions from poly coated Kraft paper manufacturers are designed for recyclability or compostability, ensuring they perform well in both retail and distribution settings. This allows small food brands to meet customer expectations without compromising quality.¬†

Good packaging does more than protect a product ‚Äî it communicates a brand‚Äôs identity. For small coffee roasters or bakeries, the tactile feel and visual impact of packaging can influence purchasing decisions as much as the product itself.

[Coated Kraft paper](https://kppackaging.com/mg-kraft)¬†provides a smooth surface for detailed printing while retaining the natural appearance that consumers associate with handmade goods. Brands can incorporate bold graphics, product details, and eco-certifications without compromising their crafted aesthetic.

*Scaling Up Without Losing Identity*

For many small producers, growth means moving from local sales to regional or national distribution. This transition can risk diluting the brand‚Äôs authenticity, but the proper packaging helps preserve it.

The use of extrusion coating lamination ensures that paper packaging can withstand the demands of shipping and retail display while still maintaining an artisanal appearance. The product arrives in excellent condition, and the packaging reinforces the brand‚Äôs sustainable values.

¬†*Looking Ahead*

Consumer demand for sustainable packaging is expected to continue increasing. Businesses that adopt innovative paper solutions now will be better positioned to stand out in competitive markets. By working with poly coated kraft paper manufacturers, small food brands can align quality with responsibility.",1,1757512772.0,u_kppackaging123,0,1.0,False

I've currently gotten back into the high life that is full time employment (sarcasm) and due to the nature of my job, it involves a lot of travelling, time away from family and also a constant pace that requires many hours working and less for my free time. 

However, in the free time I do have, I love to read. Its one of the few rare escapes I find in my life and the pleasure of engrossing myself in a world or character that captivates me is unlike any feeling I've felt. 

Anyways, hello. 

I'm looking for someone to generally chat about literature with. Someone who is enthusiastic and talktive. I find that talking about the books we read and gushing about characters and story archs helps cement our own enjoyment.

The genres I've been reading lately are definitely Sci Fi, Fantasy and Romance (I know, guilty pleasure as a guy) along with some horror on the side.

I'm open to book recommendations too as well as perhaps picking a book to read and reading it together in our own time then discussing a chapter we've read or something along those lines. In any case, a reading buddy would be greatly appreciated to help me focus, prevent a slump and captivate my passion for literature. 

I've also been interested in exploring some romantasy which is a usual change of pace from my usual liking towards more epic fantasy tales. Also, anything with dark romance related undertones with gritty character arcs and vivid storytelling.

I'm planning on starting to read 'The Fourth Wing' pretty soon.

A little about me, aside from reading I'm an avid fitness enthusiast and I keep fit and excercise pretty regularly. A healthy body makes a healthy mind, as they say. I don't typically read in public, however I'm probably not someone you'd expect to be reading on a busy train or in a tucked away coffee shop (maybe you can change that). I'm keen to talk, though I am much better at listening and offering my own thoughts instead of yapping endlessly (though if you yap, that's more than fine by me)

Hikes on tall peaks, vast hills and epic views are where you'll likely find me. Along with running along nature trails and trying aimlessly to beat my 5km run time. I like to travel too, whether it be exploring new cities, visiting museums and art galleries or simply just taking in the sights.

If you're interested in chatting, feel free to reach out and I'd be more than happy to talk.

I do have discord if you'd prefer to chat there too.",1,1757512623.0,Book_Buddies,0,1.0,False

We met while traveling through mutual friends and immediately liked each other. He asked me to be his girlfriend and put a lot of effort into being with me. 

On September 1st, I flew to see him after a month apart. The first couple of days were wonderful. We went grocery shopping, he cooked me breakfast, we walked at night, and we talked about our dreams.

He gave me his old iPhone to borrow because I was thinking of buying a new one. On the second day, I reminded him to bring the phone while he ran errands. We tried to reset it but there was a delay due to security checks.He left again to run errands for 30min and gave me the password. While it was charging, I took a photo of the coffee I was drinking, and I got curious when I looked through the empty gallery. So I clicked on the ‚Äúhidden‚Äù folder and found n\*de photos and videos of him and other ppl. I was shocked. There was one video that really upset me because it seemed someone was filmed without clear consent.

When he came back, I tried to act normal, but he noticed something was off. I told him what I had seen. He said that accessing those photos crossed a serious boundary, broke his trust, and that it could have legal consequences. I was upset and asked him to show me his main phone to make sure there was nothing else, but he didn‚Äôt.

The content was from before we met. He had told me he had issues with porn in the past but had stopped before we met. He said the person in the video knew they were being filmed. I felt guilty and blamed myself for being curious.

The next day, he said he needed time to process everything and asked me not to go on a work trip with him. I understood and apologized again. Later, we met briefly to exchange some items, and he told me he couldn‚Äôt be with someone he couldn‚Äôt trust and that we needed to break up. I apologized repeatedly, said I would never do something like this again, and that I regretted it deeply. He said his decision was final, asked if I wanted a hug, and then left.

I sent him messages saying I loved him, that trust can be rebuilt if both people want it, and that relationships are about facing problems together, forgiving, and fighting for each other if the person is worth it.

He replied that my actions were a serious breach of privacy, that Im the problem, & he couldn‚Äôt be with someone who disrespected him, and there was no chance of getting back together. He said this should be a lesson for future relationships.

We had been together for only two and a half months, but it felt intense. We had talked about the future, moving in together, traveling, and my family and his knows abt us. I feel heartbroken and guilty.

1ndeutf,https://www.reddit.com/r/PowerOnReviews/comments/1ndeutf/explore_if_the_best_single_serve_coffee_maker_by/,Explore if the Best Single Serve Coffee Maker by Keurig Delivers,"The Keurig 5000376527 is like the trusty sidekick you never knew you needed. From daily early-morning brews to late afternoon pick-me-ups, I‚Äôve been putting this little guy through its paces for weeks. It‚Äôs a fairly compact coffee maker, and as someone who doesn‚Äôt have a sprawling countertop, I instantly appreciated how its petite frame (just over 8 inches in width) slid effortlessly into the corner of my kitchen without hogging space. Keurig clearly had tight kitchens in mind, and it shows. With its sleek black matte exterior, it even complements the minimalist tone of my appliances surprisingly well. Looks matter, right? But that‚Äôs just where the story begins.

**Performance That Speeds Up My Mornings**  
By far, one of the biggest perks of this coffee maker is how absurdly fast it brews. I am NOT a morning person, and waiting for caffeine feels like eternity some days. With this machine, coffee is ready under a minute without any fiddling around. It brews multiple cup sizes‚Äî6, 8, or 10 oz.‚Äîwhich is perfect depending on whether I need a quick shot of energy or a full-blown caffeine bath. The Smart Start feature is pretty neat too. It heats and brews in one go, so there's no waiting for the machine to preheat before you hit that brew button. I did try the 6 oz size for a stronger brew, and it nailed the intensity just right. Oh, and it works great with K-Cup pods, but you can use the reusable filter for your own grounds if that‚Äôs your thing. I‚Äôve tested this out with ground medium roast Colombian coffee, and the taste was reliably smooth.

[Check Keurig 5000376527 price on Amazon.](https://mgplab.com/p/b0bv9hkmnt/)

**Easy to Operate, Even Pre-Coffee**  
The controls couldn‚Äôt be simpler‚Äîjust insert the pod, pick your cup size, and let it do the rest. It‚Äôs the kind of design that‚Äôs intuitive even if you‚Äôre half-asleep, which is usually my state pre-coffee. The simplicity makes it very beginner-friendly, but it also means there are no flashy features or settings to get too creative with. That‚Äôs a win or a loss, depending on your perspective. Cleaning this coffee maker is less of a chore, thanks to the removable drip tray and water reservoir. And for someone who occasionally spills (read: me), the removable drip tray that holds accidental overflow is such a thoughtful touch. It even accommodates travel mugs up to 7 inches tall, which is great for those of us who are permanently running late.

**Winning Points**  
- Brews coffee in under a minute, perfect for busy mornings.  
- Compact design fits seamlessly into small spaces without looking bulky.  
- Multiple brew sizes (6, 8, 10 oz.) to match personal preferences.  
- Smart Start functionality efficiently combines heating and brewing.  
- Removable drip tray and water reservoir make cleaning less dreadful.

**Areas for Improvement**  
- The reservoir capacity (36 oz.) means frequent refilling for avid coffee drinkers.  
- Limited customizability; there‚Äôs no option to control water temperature or additional settings for more advanced brewing.  
- Doesn‚Äôt support larger carafe-style brewing and sticks strictly to single-serve options.  

**Peer Products**  
For comparison, something like the Nespresso VertuoPlus offers more versatility with its broader pod variety and a larger reservoir of about 40 oz. However, it lacks the affordability of K-Cup pods, which makes the Keurig easier on the wallet once you factor in ongoing costs. On the other hand, the Cuisinart SS-10 has bonus features such as temperature control, making it ideal for those who like a precise, tailored experience. That said, the Cuisinart isn‚Äôt nearly as compact and takes up noticeably more space. Between these, the Keurig edges ahead in usability, price performance, and sheer convenience.

**Smart Spending**  
Given the relatively affordable market positioning of this machine, I‚Äôd say it offers excellent bang for the buck. Its no-frills operation, combined with the widely available and cheap K-Cup pod system, makes it hard to beat for casual coffee drinkers. While it doesn‚Äôt have the bells and whistles of some premium alternatives, its value lies in its simplicity, speed, and reliable performance. Also, the energy-saving auto-off feature trimming electricity use feels like a nice nod to cost-efficiency long term.

I have the Moccamaster 53941 KBGV Select (and specifically use the half-pot option most mornings), the Baratza Encore ESP for grinds, and I'm using the CAFEC Traditional cone-shaped paper filter cup4 (white) filters as I saw they were recommended somewhere. I currently use 36g of beans grinded on the 26 setting on my grinder and fill the Moccamaster up to 6 with water.

From here, it's a 50/50 chance if it a proper brew where the pot is filled in a timely manner with no overflow or it brews too slowly and the water overflows over the filter in the brew basket resulting in not a full half-pot and poorly tasting coffee.

The only thing I can think of is my placement of the filter in the brew basket (I place it as I think anyone else would and make sure it's sitting nicely in the brew basket) or how the grounds are sitting in the filter (I try to balance/level them out to be even in the filter) as those are the only things that have the ability to not be consistent in this process. I suppose it could be the grounds themselves coming from the Encore, but they look pretty consistent to me.

2. Has anyone actually been successful at getting genuine support from Ember the company and getting a replacement coaster? It's not a lot of money to buy a new one, but it's infuriating to think that the device just becomes defunct suddenly because the pins aren't correctly springing back up.

3. Any good tips on how to avoid this from actually happening in future? I am really careful to keep the mugs and coasters clean and to dry mugs well before using them with the charging coaster. I never use any kind of syrups and rarely have milk in coffee which I've heard has been a problem for others.

My day job is as a software developer, so I decided to combine my skills and passion to build something I wish I had from day one: a platform that‚Äôs affordable (100% free right now), has everything a creator needs in one place, and is built simply because I just enjoy making things.

That‚Äôs why my friends and I have been pouring our time into [**Untitledwav.com**](https://www.untitledwav.com/). We're ambitious, and our goal is to build the ultimate **one-stop shop** for music creators.

**Our Full Vision For The Near Future:**

* **The Ultimate Sound Library:** This is the foundation. It‚Äôs a place to share your own sounds and discover unique loops from other creators. By uploading your work, you can get paid from our creator payout pool‚Äî**visit the site to** [**learn more**](https://www.untitledwav.com/welcome) **about how it works!** It's not just user uploads either; our A&R team will be constantly working to bring in exclusive, high-quality sample packs from industry professionals to give you a curated, pro-level library.
* **A Seamless Beat Store:** We're building a fully integrated marketplace for you to sell your beats. You'll be able to manage your catalog, set your prices, and connect with artists right here.
* **A Thriving Community Hub:** This is more than just a forum. It‚Äôll be a place to post your tracks for feedback, find collaborators, read articles on tips and tricks, learn about the best new VSTs, and (we hope!) get exclusive discount codes. A real space to learn and grow.

**Why It's FREE (for now):** Right now, the **sample sharing** feature is live, with drum kits coming very soon. We're keeping everything 100% free because a community platform is nothing without its community. We need you ‚Äì real creators ‚Äì to upload your sounds, download others, and, yes, even break things! Your feedback is gold, and it helps us build this thing right.

**What's Next on the Roadmap?** After drum kits, we're going full-steam ahead on the beat store and the community hub. The other big feature my friends and I are really excited about is an **AI-powered sample discovery tool**. Imagine going beyond simple tags and being able to search for ""Old school vocal sample in the style of BigXthaPlug"" That's the future we're building.

**We need your help to build this vision!**

* **Check out the platform:** [`https://www.untitledwav.com/`](https://www.untitledwav.com/)
* **Upload your samples:** Be one of the first to contribute to the library.
* **Download and experiment:** Find some new inspiration for your next track.
* **Give us feedback:** Seriously, tell us what you love, what you hate, and what you want to see! You will be able to provide feedback through the site. Click the coffee mug at the bottom right of the page to leave feedback.

This is a passion project built by creators for creators. We can't wait to see you there and build this community together. Thanks for reading!

Yesterday, my manager invited me for a coffee and told me that our client is noticing that I‚Äôm the team member making the most mistakes, and he suggested that I start looking for another job. He also said that if I keep making mistakes, he may not be able to do anything else to help me.

My manager also mentioned that if it comes to that, he might try to find another project for me within the company.

Now I have a few questions:

1 - Does the accumulation of mistakes in this type of job give grounds for dismissal for cause?

2 - If there‚Äôs no other project to assign me to, what could happen? Dismissal without cause?

I‚Äôd really like to hear some points of view from people with more experience.

During the build of our house (took 3 years) He got extremely stressed with how many setbacks that happened and the constant delaying of products being delivered and stages to be completed. He blamed me every time something went wrong and kept saying how much he regretted building and he shouldn‚Äôt have listened to me ( I never said to build I only said to look at it as an option when looking for houses), he would get angry and smash glass cups of the floor or kick the table or couches, if he played fifa he would get even more angry and start really smashing the remotes on the ground repeatedly and kicking the coffee table untill he broke it. He has threatened to leave the country and never come back, he said multiple times we should break but then when he calmed down would give me a half ass apology and then pretend nothing happened. Today driving home, my partner was talking about getting an investment property and is think of building one. I told him I do not want to build any house anymore because of how he acted when we build our currently home, and I asked him if he remembered how he acted during that time. He ignore me and stayed quiet or changed the subject, I asked him again because I wanted to know if he heard me or not. I asked him again and he said nothing and then tried to talk to the dog. I asked him if he heard me and he then raised his voice saying he ‚Äúheard me and that I was acting really shit too back the  so if I don‚Äôt want to build then it‚Äôs fine we don‚Äôt have to build‚Äù. I said to him I‚Äôm not asking you this because I want a fight I want to have a mature conversation about past events so I know if we go forward that the same behaviour wouldn‚Äôt happen. He jus said if I don‚Äôt want to build that fine, but he never actually acknowledged his behaviour and my questions. Once we got home he acted like the conversation never happened and I‚Äôm here upset because I know I can‚Äôt ask him again because I know he‚Äôll yell at me and most likely give me silent treatment again. But i don‚Äôt like having issues left alone, I like to talk them out and work through them or talk about behaviours so it can be worked on to get stronger.

Is it okay to talk about past behaviours and how they have affected your relationships or your own mental health?

1ndee2e,https://www.reddit.com/r/SongMeanings/comments/1ndee2e/my_top_5_iptv_providers_of_2025_what_actually/,My Top 5 IPTV Providers of 2025: What Actually Worked for Me,"If you‚Äôve ever lost track of time jumping between [**iptv providers**](https://xxiptv.top/) and YouTube reviews at 2am (with way too much coffee in your system), you‚Äôll relate to this. I wanted a lineup that actually worked for my odd mix of US news, UK football, Canadian hockey, and French movies‚Äîso I spent a few weeks trying out five different services. Here‚Äôs what I found, in case anyone else is looking for the [**top rated iptv**](http://iptvmeezzy.store/) for their own channel-hopping habits.

* * *

### 1\. [**XXIPTV**](https://www.reddit.com/r/LLPTV_provider/wiki/index/)

*   **Price:** $15/month (better if you commit to a longer **iptv subscription 2025**)
    
*   **Channels:** 38,000+ live, 130,000+ VOD (especially strong for US and UK sports, solid CA and FR variety)
    
*   **Smoothness:** 9/10 (even during US and UK primetime, almost no buffering)
    
*   **My thoughts:** I found XXIPTV after reading about it from an **iptv reseller** who swore by their UK football streams. They actually impressed me‚ÄîUS and UK channels were smooth, and I found a lot of Canadian regional channels I never thought I‚Äôd use. French TV fans might want more depth, but for my needs, it just worked.
    

* * *

### 2\. [IPTVMEZZY](https://www.reddit.com/r/UKTVSUB/wiki/index/)

*   **Price:** $16/month (multi-month discounts available)
    
*   **Channels:** 45,000+ live, 220,000+ VOD (deep coverage of US, UK, CA, FR)
    
*   **Smoothness:** 8.5/10 (generally reliable‚Äîone or two hiccups during big Canadian hockey nights)
    
*   **My thoughts:** I stumbled on IPTVMEZZY through a French expat group. I liked how easy it was to get started, and the variety of French and British content was honestly better than I expected. Occasional buffering during major events, but I never missed a final score or a movie ending.
    

* * *

### 3\. [Aurorastreaming](https://www.reddit.com/r/BEST_Streaming/wiki/index)

*   **Price:** $14/month
    
*   **Channels:** 32,000+ live, 105,000+ VOD (especially good for UK and FR, solid US/CA)
    
*   **Smoothness:** 8/10 (most days are fine, but live UK sports sometimes lag)
    
*   **My thoughts:** Aurorastreaming came out of nowhere for me. Their VOD library is the real highlight‚Äîlots of French and UK cult favorites. I did hit a few slowdowns during a UK rugby match, but their support team was helpful and friendly. Not a bad pick if you love British or French TV.
    

* * *

### 4\. [NorthStar TV](https://xxiptv.top/)

*   **Price:** $13/month
    
*   **Channels:** 25,000+ live, 80,000+ VOD (US/UK/CA-focused, fewer FR specifics)
    
*   **Smoothness:** 7.5/10 (news and movies are great, but peak sports can buffer)
    
*   **My thoughts:** NorthStar TV is simple and straightforward. Good for catching US news, UK drama, and some Canadian sports. Not as much for French cinephiles, but the basics are there. Their **iptv subscription 2025** sign-up was painless, which I appreciate.
    

* * *

### 5\. StreamNova

*   **Price:** $12/month
    
*   **Channels:** 18,000+ live, 55,000+ VOD (mostly US/UK, basic CA/FR)
    
*   **Smoothness:** 7/10 (evening hours = more buffering, especially on UK events)
    
*   **My thoughts:** StreamNova is the ‚Äújust enough‚Äù pick. It covers the main channels and is okay for catching up on older shows, but not for heavy sports or niche international stuff. Their **iptv reseller** info is clear if you‚Äôre considering a side hustle, but I mostly used it for background TV.
    

* * *

My Honest IPTV Takeaways (After Many Coffees)
---------------------------------------------

*   **Always try the best iptv trial**. Every provider feels a little different on your own devices and network.
    
*   Don‚Äôt get distracted by massive channel numbers. It‚Äôs all about what you actually watch (for me, that‚Äôs UK quiz shows and French crime dramas).
    
*   Even the most [**top rated iptv**](http://iptvmeezzy.store/) services get shaky during blockbuster live events‚Äîalways good to have a backup.
    
*   Thinking of becoming an [**iptv reseller**](https://www.reddit.com/r/BEST_Streaming/wiki/index)? Be ready to be your friends‚Äô tech support forever.

1ndedr1,https://www.reddit.com/r/HomeApplianceHelp/comments/1ndedr1/should_the_best_single_serve_coffee_maker_kidisle/,Should the best single serve coffee maker KIDISLE replace your old brewer?,"A few weeks back, the KIDISLE CM9429D coffee maker found its way into my kitchen, and being someone whose day doesn't start right without caffeine, I was quite interested to see how this compact single-serve brewer would hold up. At first glance, it looked like a no-nonsense machine with some handy features, but I've spent enough time with it now to appreciate its quirks and perks. Here's the lowdown on this coffee machine that claims to handle K-cups, ground coffee, and tea with ease.

**Design and Build Quality**  
The compact size immediately stands out. With dimensions of just 8""D x 4""W x 10""H, this coffee maker fits neatly on my countertop without hogging valuable kitchen space. Its black, sleek exterior exudes a modern vibe, though it‚Äôs definitely not the flashiest appliance in the room. The stainless steel interior and included thermal travel mug are functional touches that elevate its utility. The machine hardly weighs six pounds, so even if I wanted to stow it away or move it around, it's totally manageable. That said, though the materials seem durable for everyday use, it does lack that premium heft you might expect from pricier alternatives.  

**Operation and Ease of Use**  
Honestly, I wasn't expecting rocket science here, and thankfully, it doesn‚Äôt disappoint in terms of simplicity. This is a fully automatic coffee maker, which means all I had to do was load my K-cup (or ground coffee using the reusable capsule), select the brew size, and wait. The machine accommodates five brew sizes‚Äîranging from a quick 6 oz shot to a more leisurely 14 oz cup‚Äîmaking it adaptable to moods and caffeine needs. A neat bonus is the self-cleaning function; holding the 'SIZE' and 'BREW' buttons enables an automatic cleaning cycle. I‚Äôve started using this every couple of months as recommended, and clogging hasn't reared its ugly head yet.

[Check KIDISLE CM9429D price on Amazon.](https://cyberlyber.com/p/b0dhclg55h/)

**Advantages**  
This compact coffee machine truly caters to smaller kitchens or office spaces. Below are some of its key positive features:  
- The 3-in-1 brewing function adds flexibility since it supports K-cups, ground coffee, and even tea.  
- Its tiny footprint means it fits snugly in almost any available corner on the countertop.  
- The removable drip tray allows you to brew directly into travel mugs up to 7.2"" tall.  
- The self-cleaning feature simplifies maintenance and likely saves me from having to deal with clogs.  

Despite its unassuming design, the machine delivers genuine conveniences that coffee and tea lovers can appreciate.

**Coffee Taste and Performance**  
Brewing performance is decent. Whether I used a classic K-cup pod or freshly ground coffee in the included reusable filter, the taste was solid, with no signs of bitterness or under-extraction. The adaptable brewing sizes are handy too; I found the 10 oz cup to be my sweet spot during weekday mornings, while weekend naps courtesy of the 14 oz option were pure bliss. It heats up fast, and the brewed coffee is always piping hot‚Äîa must for me.

**Areas of Weakness**  
Of course, not everything about the KIDISLE CM9429D is perfect. Some things hold it back:  
- Brew cycles can be loud for such a small machine, and the sound isn‚Äôt super pleasant.  
- Materials, while serviceable, don't scream long-term durability. The plastic exterior in particular feels average.  
- The thermal travel mug included in the package is convenient but not insulated enough to retain heat for extended periods.  

These critiques aren‚Äôt dealbreakers for light to moderate users, but coffee aficionados might feel a tad underwhelmed.

**Competing Products**  
Compared to other single-serve coffee machines like the Keurig K-Mini or even some Hamilton Beach compact brewers, this appliance performs admirably in terms of versatility. Unlike Keurig models, which solely rely on K-cups (unless you buy an additional attachment), this unit includes reusable capsules for ground coffee or tea out of the box. However, Keurig machines tend to feel sturdier and offer advanced features like programmable functions that this machine lacks. A line like the Hamilton Beach 49979 stands out as a good alternative too, especially for anyone prioritizing durability and better spill-protection mechanisms. That said, this coffee maker outpaces its price bracket rivals in brewing variety and simplicity.

**Affordable Quality**  
Affordability appears to be one of its biggest selling points. While it doesn‚Äôt carry some luxurious upgrades seen in higher-end single-serve brewers, this machine is undeniably budget-friendly for a 3-in-1 unit. It ticks several necessary boxes without stretching your wallet. When considering whether this coffee maker is worth the investment, think of it as paying for dependable daily caffeine without the frills. That balance between budget and performance keeps it relevant for anyone new to pod systems or drip coffee makers.

I had to get induced bc at 40 weeks baby had no intention of coming out.. I started at 2cm and it went up to 7cm while having some very strong contractions.. Three anesthesiologists came in, one of them and a nurse held me down in position while they spoke to me and the procedure took about 20mins just for them to say they have to redo it because the catheter didn‚Äôt reach or something like that I cannot say specifically because I was out of it.. So I was like ‚Äúare you kidding me?‚Äù Because I was in so much pain and now I have to do this whole thing again and the nurse says ‚Äúdon‚Äôt worry, the expert is going to give you the second one‚Äù and I‚Äôm thinking wtf so who did the first one? An idiot? 

After maybe an hour of getting the second epidural the contraction  pain started to get intense again so another anesthesiologist came and injected something in the IV and tells me ‚Äúyour back is gonna feel very cold‚Äù instantly the opposite happened my back felt extremely hot and painful, extreme to an 11 out of 10 pain, it hurt more than the contractions.. I was screaming so much the room filled up with nurses, I couldn‚Äôt lay on my back because the weight of my body was making the pain even worse, they checked me I went down to 4cm dilation and they told me the baby‚Äôs heart rate dropped and my bp was super high.. so I had to get an emergency c section..

In the OR they gave me a third epidural higher up on my back and it didn‚Äôt do anything, didn‚Äôt help at all.. the doctor behind the cover was poking my abdomen area asking me ‚Äúdo you feel this?‚Äù I said yes so they injected something anesthesia into the IV again, he kept asking me ‚Äúdo you feel this?‚Äù And I kept saying yes, the anesthesiologist was telling me ‚Äúyou‚Äôre still supposed to feel something touching you‚Äù I told them I know that but I‚Äôm actually feeling something sharp poking me. (I recently got a tooth removed with local anesthesia I felt them doing stuff but not the pain so I know what is supposed to feel like) 
They kept insisting that I was wrong and that the anesthesia was working I just didn‚Äôt know how it was supposed to feel like.. I was in so much intense pain and still feeling the poking but I told them ‚Äúfuck this just cut me anyways I can‚Äôt stand this anymore‚Äù because I was so angry and felt unheard and when they heard me then they gave me fentanyl and I blacked out..

I briefly woke up to see my husband next to me with a big smile on his face and crying and heard my baby crying sounding like a gargle.. I was very happy and then my husband said I said ‚Äúit hurts again‚Äù so he said they gave me more fentanyl and closed me up..

1nde624,https://www.reddit.com/r/actuallesbians/comments/1nde624/i_thought_youd_be_the_strong_one/,‚ÄúI thought you‚Äôd be the strong one‚Äù,"So unfortunately, after she got to know me, I wasn‚Äôt what she expected of me or what I appeared to be.

When we first met, me being kind of a client situation and meeting her where she worked, I honestly didn‚Äôt think she would like me too, let alone be attracted to me.

I entered the door and I was overthinking how to phrase my words as I often feel that I sound too blunt.

So I was saying something in my native language to her. She looked a little bit stressed and told me: ‚ÄòI‚Äôm sorry, I don‚Äôt speak german‚Äô

I replied with something like :‚Äôdo not worry‚Äô

She was working in customer service for a ngo and we started to chat a bit. 
Her questions were so interesting, I had to say so much.

Aftee that conversation I had such a big smile on my face, I was walking through the city and feeling like I‚Äôm being carried by a cloud.


She gave me her mobile number and I wondered if I should text her right away and ask her the questions I‚Äôd like to know about her.

I didn‚Äôt. I waites til the next day and sent her a message that she can always text me if she needs help or someone to talk.

Honestly I didn‚Äôt think about sex. 

But I got upset because she didn‚Äôt textb back in weeks.

We texted a but because it took her so long I already thought about just ending it. But I didn‚Äôt.

And aftee some time she asked me if we could grab coffee.

I sent her some messages with mixed signals. Not proud of.

The next day we met spontanously, when she asked me to watch a film with her outdoors. She suggested to meet earlier, so that we could eat something small.


Turns out that she prepared a meal for us.
At this point I still thought she‚Äôd like me platonic. 
We chatted and laughed a lot, I was talking about some funny and akward situations of my past. 

We were sitting on a bench and I do not know who took ones hand first, but suddenly we were holding hands for a while.

We decided to stand up and head to the place for the film, I asked her if she‚Äôd
like to have a drink.
She declined and I told her, that I wouldn‚Äôt drink either. 

I said something that made her laugh, after that she started kissing me very passionate.

I didn‚Äôt see that coming. 
We kissed eachother, but I had to stop.
She told me that she likes me, but wants to take things slow.


When we watched the film, it was one of the lamest films I‚Äôve watched in a while.
I was so glad it was over.

It was outdoors and I was getting very cold. She offered me her jacket and I asked her if I could come with her to her place. After we entered the door, 
everything went so fast. 

I honestly didn‚Äôt think that a girl like her would be interested in me.
I know the version of myself I had been and what I‚Äôve become.
I didn‚Äôt think I‚Äôd be attractive to someone.


It was so hot being close to her.

I do not know where everything started to go downhill.
On that day I neglected some other plans I had. I just didn‚Äôt wanna leave her.

Maybe I got a little attached too quickly, too intense.

I know that would happen, it always does.

She prepared breakfast and we continued to kiss eachother.

I didn‚Äôt wanna go.

I knew that we aren‚Äôt compatible but I liked her so much. 

I haven‚Äôt been close with somebody in years and it felt so special.

Days later she texted me she had a crush on me and that she wants to be near me, but doesn‚Äôt see it working out.
That she cannot give me the stability and clarity I need and that she truly wishs me well.

I didn‚Äôt understand.
Texted something rather generic back. 

brought a gift to her place‚Ä¶ but no response. Wrote her a message, but she doesn‚Äôt even looked at it.
She didn‚Äôt block me,
but she doesn‚Äôt want me in her life either.


I know we were not stable enough for eachother, but I miss her. 
I miss her kindness and her being so sweet. I miss feeling connected to her, but I hate feeling attached and waiting for a message from her, yet knowing that distance might be the best for us both.

1nde5ou,https://www.reddit.com/r/SoundChecked/comments/1nde5ou/should_you_buy_the_best_electric_kettle_aroma/,Should You Buy the Best Electric Kettle AROMA AWK-1810SD Today,"The Aroma AWK-1810SD has been a regular companion in my kitchen for the past several weeks, and its stainless steel finish combined with thoughtful design is the first thing that caught my attention. Right from the unboxing, this sleek electric kettle felt robust yet lightweight for something that looks so premium. As someone who enjoys a morning routine of freshly brewed tea, the adjustable temperature feature immediately stood out. It‚Äôs not just boiling water; this kettle lets you control the temperature with digital precision, making it incredibly versatile for a variety of uses such as coffee, oatmeal, or even instant noodles.

**Design and Build Quality**  
This stainless steel kettle is aesthetically pleasing and blends effortlessly into my modern kitchen. The cordless design ensures that pouring is hassle-free, especially when talking to guests or moving about. Being able to detach it from the base without wrestling with cords has been a surprisingly convenient feature. At just 2 pounds, it feels light in the hand while still sturdy. The handles have a nice ergonomic grip, making it comfortable to hold even when full. Build quality aside, the stainless steel is easy to clean and doesn‚Äôt stain, which I appreciate as someone who uses it multiple times daily.

**Ease of Use and Functionality**  
The digital controls initially seemed like overkill for a kettle, but they‚Äôve completely changed how I think about boiling water. Adjusting the temperature is as simple as a button press, and it‚Äôs especially useful when I need precise degrees for pour-over coffee or green tea. I also tested the Keep Warm mode, which maintains the desired temperature for up to an hour. This feature has been handy during long breakfasts when I want a second cup of tea without waiting. The automatic shut-off function has been a reassuring safety measure; I‚Äôve gotten distracted before while boiling water, so knowing it turns off automatically adds a peace of mind I didn‚Äôt know I needed.

Ready to snag Aroma AWK-1810SD? [Check price on Amazon now.](https://ultimodule.com/p/b09zkhhky8/)

**Performance in Daily Use**  
Performance-wise, the kettle delivers on its promise of rapid boiling. The extra-high 1500-watt power genuinely makes a difference, shaving minutes off the time compared to traditional stovetop kettles. I timed it out of curiosity ‚Äì boiling a full 1.7 liters of water took less than five minutes. That‚Äôs faster than my microwave and far more efficient. Plus, the built-in removable tea filter is a game-changer for loose-leaf tea lovers like myself. Cleanup is simple, and the filter doesn‚Äôt leave any gritty residue at the bottom of the cup.

**Good Points**  
- Rapid boiling with 1500W power  
- Digital temperature controls for precision  
- Keep Warm mode for added convenience  
- Cordless design for easier handling and pouring  

**Critiques**  
- The glossy stainless steel surface, while attractive, picks up fingerprints easily.  
- The digital controls, though accurate, have a slight learning curve for first-time users.  
- The Keep Warm function doesn‚Äôt go beyond one hour ‚Äì I would have loved it to extend longer.  

**Product Rivals**  
Comparing this to similar models such as the Cuisinart CPK-17 or the Hamilton Beach 40880, the Aroma‚Äôs digital precision and Keep Warm setting stand out as superior features. While the Cuisinart supports multiple preset temperature buttons, its plastic components feel less premium compared to the Aroma‚Äôs stainless steel finish. The Hamilton Beach, on the other hand, is more budget-friendly but lacks advanced controls like precise temperature adjustments, making it less versatile for tea or coffee lovers with specific brewing needs. However, both competitors handle basic boiling well, meaning the Aroma might appeal more to those who prioritize tech touches and multi-use flexibility.

**Smart Spending**  
For its features, the Aroma AWK-1810SD provides great value. The price feels entirely reasonable given the inclusion of programmable controls, rapid heating, and a thoughtful cordless design. Products with comparable features often sit at higher price points, so getting everything here without breaking the budget feels like a win. If you‚Äôre someone who brews tea often, dabbles in coffee-making, or simply wants a more modern kettle without spending excessively, this model ticks all the boxes.

To set expectations, I'm willing to travel to your location as long as it's not far away than Manila or Quezon City Areas. If you're from Tarlac or Pangasinan, all the better.

**For both of our safety:**¬†Let's exchange pictures of ourselves in DMs (we can also do it on TG or WhatsApp, if you want). Just to be sure we can trust each other. If we end up both being attracted to each other by seeing our pictures, then let's go for it! Don't worry, I will NOT be asking you for nude photos or videos and please don't ask me for those as well. I personally think ""Spark"" is important in any relationships and it's better if we're both attracted to each other physically FIRST before anything else, then we can go from there. Also, do not worry, I will NOT ghost you or abandon you out of nowhere. A real man MUST ALWAYS be honest and upfront, so expect me to be honest with you rather than leaving you hanging and I expect you to do the same. This is to filter out scammers and frauds out there. I want you and me to be safe and I want us both to enjoy this experience. So safety first!

**About Me:**

\- 5'5 (168cm)

\- Cosplayer and Model

\- Professional Artist

\- Passionate Video Game Player (owns a PS5 and Gaming PC)

\- Catholic but not very religious

\- Currently residing in Baguio for work

\- Hometown is Tarlac

\- STD/HIV FREE

\- Fit / BMI Normal Body Type

\- Has Chinese, Korean and American Ancestry

\- High Libido but can be very unpredictable (I have a huge physical appetite but still depends on my mood)

\- Doesn't have kids (I value my freedom and privacy too much but I'm willing to adopt pets)

\- Hates ghosting and extremely delayed replies (if you did NOT reply to me within 24-48 hours, then I will consider that as ghosting and I will abandon you in return. If you can't reply immediately and busy with something, atleast be respectful enough to tell me so that I'll know if I should still continue to date you or not. I will do the same. But If I pursued someone else because you didn't reply to me within that timeframe, then don't blame me)

\- Willing to date outdoors or indoors (if you want to us to spend time just sitting in a park looking at the city lights or just simply sitting in a sofa at home watching a movie, then I'm all for it)

\- Had quiet a number of ex-girlfriends but I no longer have contacts with any of them (I had intercourse with 2 of them, but the other partners I've had after that are just non-penetrative bedroom sessions since I don't want any UNWANTED PREGNANCY)

\- Has a LOT of hobbies and may require a lot of away time but I'll always make sure to always remind you that I think of you and spend time with you as best I can

\- Loves watching Anime, Cartoons, Horror/Psychological Thriller/Slasher/Fantasy (particularly, magical medieval fantasy)/CGI/Superhero movies

\- Values Healthy Living - I'm on STRICT Carnivore Diet, NEVER smoked since birth, rarely drinks alcohol, lives life stress-free/no drama, hates eating junk foods, processed foods, chips, sugary stuffs, candies, soft drinks, and too much carbs. Oh, and I hate coffee and tea too.

\- Values Honesty (I don't beat around the bush)

\- Values Honor and Dignity (pride in one's abilities, strengths, limitations, talents and sticking to my ideals and principles)

\- Values Communication (I will NOT allow both of us to go to sleep UNTIL we resolve our issues)

\- Very Organized - I always mark important events in my calendar

\- Very Time-Sensitive and hates ""Filipino Time"" - Whenever I plan things with someone, I always make sure to BE THERE ON TIME. This is true not just for my dating prospects, but my friends as well.

\- Values Family above everything - I LOVE my parents to death! I'd DIE for them!

\- Values Loyalty (A real man must ALWAYS be loyal to his lady)

\- Certified Dog and Cat-lover (I can't help but pet and play with every dog or cat I see in the streets)

\- Has a severe case of Cuteness Proximity (I like cute things - hoomans, puppies, kittens, hamsters, hedgehogs, etc.)

\- Willing to travel - as long as it's NOT far away than Manila or Quezon City Areas

**About You:**

\- Fit, Curvy or THICC Body Types (It's just my personal preference so please don't take it personally. I'm just NOT attracted to chubby or plus-sized women)

\- Preferably, shorter or equal to my height

\- Must be STD/HIV FREE

\- Must have your own job. If you don't have work at the moment, don't worry, I can still date you as long as you're NOT going to ask me for money or loans, and you're willing to look for work later on

\- Must have no connections to any ex-boyfriends anymore (I prefer relationships that are drama-free and no one bothering us)

\- Preferably, someone who does NOT smoke, in the process of quitting smoking, or has quit smoking altogether (I HATE the smell of cigarettes)

\- Drinking Alcohol is fine as long as you're NOT an alcoholic/addict

\- Must be willing to really show interest and not waste time (this goes to what I said above. If you can't reply to messages within 24-48 hours, say so instead of staying silent or else that's considered GHOSTING and I'll say my goodbyes to you)

\- Hopefully, you're also a dog or cat-lover

\- Hopefully, you're also into Anime and Video Games

\- Hopefully, you also value loyalty

\- Hopefully. you also don't want kids

\- Hopefully, you also have high libido (bedroom chemistry is extremely important in a relationship, after all)

For anyone interested to apply, feel free to send me DMs any time! I admit this might come off as a job application but that's only because I don't want any scammers or fraud ruining our experience. After all, we all want genuine connections at the end of the day. Again, don't forget to send your pictures and I'll send mine to you as well. I repeat, no nude photos or videos! I'll do my best to accommodate you.

I‚Äôve always held her until she‚Äôs good and asleep and then transferred into the crib in our room. I still do this, but not within five minutes she‚Äôs awake and upset. All I have to do is put her back on my chest and she‚Äôs asleep again but this is unsustainable. 

I‚Äôve been essentially forced into chest to chest cosleeping because of this. I do everything I can to make it safe plus she‚Äôs in a rhino brace for another week so she‚Äôs not going anywhere when she‚Äôs on me. 

It‚Äôs uncomfortable for me. My back hurts and I‚Äôm exhausted. 

We‚Äôve done everything to try to ease this. We took her down to two naps, sometimes she even only has one. The length of the two naps were shortened. She‚Äôs still on pur√©e and I‚Äôve now been offering her more throughout the day in hopes that she just needs more calories?? Feed her pur√©e (grain and grow, she likes the thicker stuff) before bed to try to help her sleep. I give the recommended dose of Motrin before bed to help with any teething pain. We have a routine. White noise. Nothing is working. 

Have I mentioned IM EXHAUSTED and I‚Äôm gonna stain my teeth from all the coffee I‚Äôve been drinking. I‚Äôve been lashing out at my partner.

I (F30) have officially started a new tens of life about 3 weeks ago. I lived for the past 7 years in a small European country with terrible conditions (cold, dark weather, rain, bad public transport, crazy work culture). The dating scene there is notoriously difficult. I had a few relationships but none worked out, and after my last breakup I‚Äôve been single for 2 years.

Last November I went to a karaoke night with a Meetup group. At first I hadn‚Äôt even noticed him, but then I realized a man at the opposite table was looking at me insistently. He was with 2 male and 2 female friends, and I couldn‚Äôt tell if one was his girlfriend. Later, we ended up side by side ‚Äî he looked at me smiling but a little ill at ease. I felt a very strong attraction, not just physical but something that radiated ‚Äúpeacefulness, happiness of life, simplicity, and safety.‚Äù I wanted to approach, but the karaoke setup made it impossible. He left before I could talk to him, and I couldn‚Äôt stop thinking about him afterwards.

I eventually found him online (‚ÄúSherlock Holmes skills‚Äù) and got his WhatsApp. I texted him but no reply. Weeks later I followed up, and he finally sent me a voice message apologizing, saying he had moved abroad to start a company, but would be back in February and happy to meet then. I thanked him and said I‚Äôd wait for him to reach out.

So I waited. Weeks turned into months. I kept hoping ‚Äî at Christmas, New Year‚Äôs, Valentine‚Äôs Day ‚Äî that he would message me, but nothing. Finally in February, after almost 4 months, I texted him again. He answered right away: he was back with his ex, and that‚Äôs why he hadn‚Äôt contacted me. I was devastated, but acted maturely and wished him well.

Still, I couldn‚Äôt fully forget him. Seven months later, as I am preparing to leave this country¬†*for good*, but still was wondering about him, I decided to send one last message. The intention was NOT to try to date him or hookup, but I really felt like I needed to meet him to actually see if he was as amazing of a person as he seemed to be on that night. I wanted to hear about his story and what had brought him to being so peaceful and reassuring.

**Me:**  
*""Hi, I hope you‚Äôre doing well. I just wanted to let you know that I‚Äôm leaving Luxembourg for a few months (and maybe finally for good). Before I go, I‚Äôd love to invite you for a coffee or a drink if you‚Äôre up for it, no intentions behind. Totally fine if not. All the best.""*

**Him:**  
*""Hey, thanks for the message! I am back with my ex and I think it would not be fair to her if we meet up. I wish you good luck in your move ü§ûüèºüçÄ""*

**Me:**  
*""Hey! I need to sit with this answer, but however respect your decision. That was my last handshake across the void. Thanks for answering. All the best.""*

(He hasn‚Äôt even opened this last message.)

I admire his loyalty, but I‚Äôm confused about his willingness not to see me even once, knowing I was leaving with no intentions behind it. It feels like he was never really interested, maybe just would have tried hooking up if his ex hadn‚Äôt come back?...

So I‚Äôm lost: was his reaction normal and more mature than mine? Or was he just never into me? Was he an asshole‚Ä¶ or am I for hoping to have a coffee with a man already in a relationship?",0,1757510297.0,dating_advice,2,0.5,False

1nddy2o,https://www.reddit.com/r/u_theonlineforyou/comments/1nddy2o/why_passive_income_is_the_key_to_more_free_time/,Why Passive Income is the Key to More Free Time,"Imagine waking up without the pressure of rushing to work, sipping your morning coffee slowly, and spending your day doing what truly matters to you. That‚Äôs the magic of passive income‚Äîit‚Äôs not just about money, it‚Äôs about freedom.

Passive income is money you earn without constant active involvement. It might come from rental properties, digital products, investments, or content that continues to generate revenue long after the initial work is done. The beauty of this income stream is its ability to keep flowing, even when you're not clocking in hours.

Here‚Äôs why passive income is your ticket to a freer, more flexible life:

**1. Reclaim Your Time**

Time is our most precious resource. Passive income allows you to trade your time once (by creating or setting up a system) and benefit repeatedly. Whether it's earning while you sleep or taking a vacation without checking your bank account, passive income gives you back control over your time.

**2. Reduce Stress and Burnout**

Constantly working long hours to meet financial goals can be draining. With a steady passive income, you reduce dependency on a single job or paycheck. That peace of mind alone can drastically improve your mental and emotional well-being.

**3. Focus on What You Love**

When your bills are covered passively, you have the freedom to pursue your passions‚Äîbe it art, travel, volunteering, or simply spending more quality time with family and friends. Life becomes about choices, not obligations.

**4. Build Long-Term Security**

Passive income isn't just about present-day luxury. It‚Äôs a long-term wealth-building strategy. Over time, these income streams can compound and grow, giving you financial security without trading more time for money.

**5. Live Life on Your Terms**

Want to take a spontaneous trip? Start a new hobby? Work only part-time? Passive income makes it possible. It opens doors to a lifestyle where you decide what your day looks like, every single day.

In a world that often feels like it‚Äôs moving too fast, passive income provides the cushion to slow down and truly live. It‚Äôs not just a financial strategy‚Äîit‚Äôs a lifestyle choice that leads to greater freedom, joy, and balance.

1nddvld,https://www.reddit.com/r/Advice/comments/1nddvld/i_34f_think_i_need_to_break_up_with_by_bf_37m_and/,I (34F) think I need to break up with by bf (37M) and I don't want to. Advice needed,"This is my first post and English is not my first language. I need some unbiased opinion about a challenging relationship.

Me (33F) and my boyfriend (36M) are together since 1.5 years. We both are on the spectrum and both went through a lot in life, but have different posture : I'm rather on a ""fighting for survival"" mode while he is on a ""philosophical surrendering"" one. We make the most of this difference by influencing each-other : I learn to chill more, he learns to take things more in hands. But of course we also have some fights because of it.

I own my small house and work full time on my own business. My boyfriend moved in with me 8 months ago. He doesn't pay rent and we split equitably bills and chores. We both want a baby asap, but only after some basic requirements are met, like sufficient incomes.

My issues :

* He quit his job 16 months ago and is still unemployed. He understandably needed some time to think about it, but his posture remained passive : he wanted a career transition and he joined a social plan when proposed to, which resulted in a few psy appointments and online courses, all almost useless. No skills assessment. He decided only two weeks ago to seriously start looking, and he sends a first CV today. back to his old type of job.
* He doesn't drive and is not interested in it. I told him we would not have a baby as long as I'm the only driver : I need to know that he can take me to hospital or wherever we need to, me and a child, in times of difficulty. Because there will be hard times where I will be unable to do it. He seemed to agree that driving at least a license-free car is necessary. But when he speaks about future big expenses, it goes back to an electric bike for himself, without any mention of a car.
* He spends his days playing video games and watching movies. I like video games as well, but this is about 14 hours a day. He also watch movies when eating, for almost every meal. He's happy with this lifestyle, so he rarely goes out. When I propose to do something like a walk or a picnic, maybe once every two weeks, he often comes with me but more to please me than because he really wants to. Which is not ideal for both of us. I'd like to hang out more with him, and do more diverse things together.
* He has big sleeping issues, with sleep apnea. This makes him constantly tired, less able to manage his emotions, to have anything done, to find a job. He got a respirator device two weeks ago but didn't really used it yet as it's uncomfortable. Unfortunately it impacts my sleep as well, as I wake up easily and he goes in and out of bed every few hours, and moves a lot in bed as he's (understandably) exhaustably-angry from the insomnia.
* We have trouble communicating and managing conflicts. When we disagree, I tend to explain calmly my point of view with logic (despite my emotional sensitivity), while he is instantly emotionally triggered and go angry. He then respond with a batch of emotional nonsense (from my point of view) and my logic A+B=C does not reach him at all. Then he go silent for a few days despite my will of discussing it, as he wants time to process his anger. And he comes back with progressive hugs, having forgetting the initial issue. Which never get resolved. If I try to speak about it later, the cycle starts all over again.
* We almost don't have sex anymore. I'm often the one taking initiative, but most of the time he's too tired or not in the mood. He does not seem to be aware of or suffering from this new dynamic (6 months).
* His eating habits are quite unhealthy from my point of view : fast food, processed food, lots of meat, cheese and pasta, few vegetables. Unfortunately, this impacts my own diet : it's harder to go for a salad when burgers are on the table. Of course I influence his diet towards a healthier balance, but it influences my diet the other way around. It impacts my quality of life, as does the sleeping issue. This is not directly his fault, but it is a factual consequence. Besides, because of the different eating habits and sleeping schedule, we do not eat together. This is something I miss, as I come from a family where the meals are a time spent together.

I'm at the end of my patience, tired of all this. My quality of life has decreased, my mood is low and I feel anxious about the future. I do not feel that I can rely on him. It's often like I'm in charge of both of us instead of having a partner. I am not able any more to project myself marrying him and I'm doubting there will ever be a time where we actually can have a baby in a healthy relationship.

However, my reluctance to break up comes from many things :

* I'm 34 and deeply want a child. I feel like he is my last chance, considering my age and the time it would take to grieve about this relationship, meet someone else and getting to know that other one enough. But I know that staying with someone only to have a kid is an awful reason.
* I know that having a long-lasting relationship takes some work, and I don't want to bail if there is still a chance for us.
* We have a lot of uncommon things in common, which are rare to find. It might be hard to find another match like him.
* And I do love him. Really. He's the nicest caring guy I've ever known. He anticipates every of my needs and takes care of me beyond my thoughts. At family gatherings, he cleans after everybody, make sure everyone has a drink, remakes coffee before anyone ask to, etc. In the street or in shops, he talks to cashiers, strangers, interacts with everyone and makes sure even the strangers have a good time. He offers me unconditional support, he volunteers at my work events. He accepts me as I am, which makes me ashamed of not being able to accept it the same way around. I really want to make things work with him. It is so comfortable to hug him.
* And last but not least : he does quite a bit of efforts. He works on himself and I see some changes since the beginning of our relationship :He quit smoking weed a year ago, from 10 joints a day to nothing. I know this is a super hard path to take and he's managing it. I'm super proud of him. Also, he takes slightly more initiatives at home since I told him 2 months ago. He's not a bad looser anymore in board-games. And when he's not in the mood to go out with me, now he tells me rather than going with me and spoiling it.

So yeah. I'm torn. Is my hope for improvement a reality slow to come or an illusion ? And of course I have doubt on my own judgment : am I being naive, too patient and understanding, once again ? Or too harsh, too exigent ? Blind-sided by anything ? Because if I was just able to let go, relax and accept this different way of life, I could probably enjoy a life with him.

Wikipedia says in 2003 they discontinued it because it was hand cut while the rest of the donuts were machine cut, but it was their signature. It represented the brand aswell as the name.

 The Dunkin Donut was around almost aslong as the brand itself. This unique peice of American food culture made it 48 years before being discontinued and cements itself as a one-of-a-kind staple in the history of U.S. restaurants. Today Dunkin' Donuts is now known as just ""Dunkin"". Dunkin' is not known for it's donuts anymore, and has shifted it's focus on the beverage side of the market. In all honesty, I think this may be why it lost so much market share to other coffee companies like Tim Horton's and Biggby Coffee.

1nddk7u,https://www.reddit.com/r/SpanishAIlines/comments/1nddk7u/when_to_use_the_definite_article_in_spanish/,When to Use the Definite Article in Spanish: Common and Different Cases Compared to English,"This post goes over the main ways to use the definite articles in Spanish (*el, la, los, las*). Some uses are the same as in English, but many are different, so pay attention and try to remember these rules to avoid making mistakes.

1. Basic: Talking about something specific

Use a definite article (el, la, los, las) when referring to something already known or specific.

* El libro est√° sobre la mesa. ‚Üí The book is on the table.
* Las llaves est√°n en la cocina. ‚Üí The keys are in the kitchen.

2 . Talking about general concepts

In Spanish, you keep the definite article when speaking generally about things.

* Me encanta el caf√©. ‚Üí I love coffee.
* El chocolate es delicioso. ‚Üí Chocolate is delicious.

3 . With days of the week¬†

Spanish uses the definite article for days.

* Trabajo el lunes. ‚Üí I work on Monday.
* La reuni√≥n es el mi√©rcoles. ‚Üí The meeting is on Wednesday.

**Note**: When you‚Äôre simply saying what day it is, you don‚Äôt use the article after ser.

* Hoy es lunes. ‚Üí Today is Monday.
* Ma√±ana es martes. ‚Üí Tomorrow is Tuesday.

4 . With languages¬†

Use the definite article before the name of a language (unless directly after ‚Äúhablar,‚Äù ‚Äúde‚Äù or ‚Äúen‚Äù).

* El espa√±ol es f√°cil de entender. ‚Üí Spanish is easy to understand.
* Hablo espa√±ol.¬† (no article after hablar)

5 . With body parts and clothes instead of possessive

Use a definite article instead of ‚Äúmy / your‚Äù when the owner is clear.

* Me duele la cabeza. ‚Üí My head hurts. (Me duele mi cabeza is incorrect)
* Se quit√≥ los zapatos. ‚Üí He took off his shoes.

6 . With time of day

The definite article is used with parts of the day.

* Trabajo por la ma√±ana. ‚Üí I work in the morning.
* Nos vemos por la tarde. ‚Üí See you in the afternoon.

7 . With titles and professions

The definite article is often used before titles when talking about someone (but dropped when addressing them).

* La doctora P√©rez est√° aqu√≠. ‚Üí Doctor P√©rez is here.
* Buenos d√≠as, doctora. ‚Üí Good morning, Doctor.¬† (no article in direct address)

**Note:** The definite article is omitted before professions after ser, unless the noun is modified by an adjective or other descriptive phrase.

No article is used when stating someone‚Äôs profession (unless modified by an adjective).

* Ella es profesora. ‚Üí She is a teacher.
* √âl es un profesor excelente. ‚Üí He is an excellent teacher.¬† (article used with adjective)

8 . With measurements and prices

The definite article is used in expressions with a + price/measurement.

* Las manzanas est√°n a un euro el kilo. ‚Üí Apples are one euro a kilo.
* Cobran diez euros la hora. ‚Üí They charge ten euros an hour.

Which of these uses of the article do you find the strangest or most confusing?",6,1757509256.0,SpanishAIlines,0,1.0,False

current stats:



\- active sources: \~200 contacts

\- ongoing investigations: 4 major pieces

\- fact-checking backlog: constantly terrifying

\- coffee consumed: probably unhealthy amounts



what's working: switched to constella app for source management after my third ""wait, didn't someone tell me this already?"" moment. the graph view shows connections between sources, topics, and story threads that i was missing in spreadsheets.



when source A mentions company X, i can instantly see that source B also talked about company X in a different context. those connections often become the story.



what's still broken:



\- fact-checking workflow needs work (still using obsessive spreadsheets)

\- transcription backlog grows faster than i can process

\- invoicing is a nightmare (completely separate problem)



metrics that matter:



\- stories published: 12

\- average research time per piece: down 30% since implementing better source tracking

\- fact-checking accuracy: 100% so far (knock on wood)

\- revenue: enough to pay rent, barely



what's next: expanding into podcast interviews, which means figuring out audio transcription workflows. also considering investigative partnerships to handle bigger stories.



the constella app helps but it's definitely overkill for simple notes - good for complex investigations though.

I was the one who filed for divorce, but the reason was because he was cheating on me with men. Which was the final straw in an already very bad marriage. 

All three kids live with me, and our minor child spends one night a week with him even though technically we are supposed to be doing 50-50. That‚Äôs fine with me though. He hasn‚Äôt paid child support for her yet. That‚Äôs also fine because I knew he wouldn‚Äôt and I‚Äôm not even going to bother with it because it is such a small amount.

He has taken forever to remove his stuff from my house. And it is truly my house, this is not joint property that I got in the divorce. He had nothing to do with the purchase, taxes, insurance or anything like that for this home. He still has things here and I am starting to feel like he is not getting it through his skull that he cannot keep using me like this.

Now here is my issue. One of our adult children had a birthday after my ex and I were divorced, but my ex was still living in the house. Supposedly everything is amicable between us, but for this adult child‚Äôs birthday, my ex sat sulking on the couch And refused to have birthday cake or the dinner we ordered. He acted like a real pouty bitch. 

That same child has graduated from university. I want to order food and have a little cake for him, but I don‚Äôt want to invite my ex. I feel like he should reach out to this kid and make plans on his own. In addition, our other adult child is having a birthday soon, and it‚Äôs the same situation. I don‚Äôt want to invite him for cake or anything . I realize it might be different with our minor child. 

But since we are divorced, shouldn‚Äôt he have to get his own gift for the adults if he chooses to and meet with them on his own? These adult kids do not want him there, just for the record. And the reason for that is because of how he might act normal or he might be a total asshole, And everyone feels on eggshells around him not knowing what we will get that particular day.

I just feel like he is really still using me in our divorce just like he did in our marriage. I don‚Äôt think I should have to feed him a meal and a cake and slap his name on a present he didn‚Äôt contribute to for our adult kids when he could easily Invite those adults out for drinks or coffee or even just to hang at his place for dessert.

We‚Äôve all used apps where the visuals feel stiff and lifeless, right? That‚Äôs why I was so hyped when I discovered¬†[**Animoji**](https://animojiapp.vercel.app/?utm_source=chatgpt.com), a lightweight React library that turns boring static icons into smooth, animated visuals that¬†*breathe life into your projects*.

And the kicker? It costs¬†**just $4 for lifetime access**. Yep, less than a coffee.

# What Is Animoji?

[https://x.com/XyrenDev/status/1964912170908414205](https://x.com/XyrenDev/status/1964912170908414205)

At its core, Animoji is a¬†**library of 300+ animated SVG icons**, built with¬†**Framer Motion**¬†and optimized for performance.

Here‚Äôs what stood out to me right away:

* ‚ö°¬†**Smooth as butter**¬†animations that don‚Äôt tank performance.
* ‚öõÔ∏è¬†**Developer-friendly setup**¬†with TypeScript support and shadcn CLI integration.
* üíé A growing collection of icons that feel modern and polished ‚Äî way beyond what you‚Äôll find in free libraries.
* üí∏ A pricing model so affordable it almost feels like a dare.

# Why It Works (And Why People Are Buying)

The creator of Animoji launched it as a micro-SaaS experiment, priced at just $4 one-time. In the¬†**first 24 hours**, they already had¬†**14 paying users**.

Why? Because the offer is irresistible:

* **Low friction**¬†‚Üí no recurring subscription, just pay once.
* **Clear value**¬†‚Üí save hours designing/animating icons yourself.
* **Authentic story**¬†‚Üí built and shipped fast, shared openly, and gained traction through community buzz.

As someone who‚Äôs been tinkering with SaaS tools for years, I can tell you: that combo is a growth rocket.

# Why You Should Grab It Now

Here‚Äôs the deal:

* üé®¬†**Designers**¬†‚Üí Stop wasting time hand-animating icons.
* üë©‚Äçüíª¬†**Developers**¬†‚Üí Drop in polished, motion-ready assets instantly.
* üöÄ¬†**Indie makers**¬†‚Üí Make your MVPs look like they came out of a design studio.

And for $4.99 lifetime, it‚Äôs one of the easiest ‚Äúyes‚Äù decisions I‚Äôve made this year.

# Final Thoughts

I‚Äôve tested a lot of UI tools, but Animoji is one of those rare finds that combines¬†**affordability, polish, and developer experience**.

If you want to¬†**wow your users without bloating your workflow**, I can‚Äôt recommend it enough.

Hi everyone! üëã I created a **VS Code / Cursor extension** üñºÔ∏è to make it easy to paste images from your clipboard directly into the terminal, including WSL terminals.

Claude Code‚Äôs native paste doesn‚Äôt always work and can be tricky, which motivated me to create this extension. However, it‚Äôs **not limited to Claude Code** ‚Äì it works in **any terminal**. Instead of using online image sharing (which is insecure), I use a **simple, secure offline method**: images are saved in your project (in a `.cp-images/` folder) and the relative path is inserted into the terminal. Everything happens locally.

### Terminal Paste Image

**How it works**

* **Clipboard image detection** üìã ‚Äì automatically detects images in your clipboard.
* **Automatic saving & cleanup** üíæ ‚Äì saves images to a configurable `.cp-images/` folder, and old images are automatically cleaned up.
* **Git ignore** üõ°Ô∏è ‚Äì the folder is automatically added to your `.gitignore`.
* **Path insertion** ‚û°Ô∏è ‚Äì inserts the relative file path into the terminal.

**Supported Platforms**

* **Windows** ü™ü (PowerShell included)
* **macOS** üçé (requires `pngpaste`)
* **Linux** üêß (requires `xclip`)
* **WSL / WSL2** (integrates with PowerShell in WSL)

**Usage**

1. Copy an image to your clipboard.
2. Focus on any VS Code terminal.
3. Press `Ctrl+Alt+V` (Windows/Linux) or `Cmd+Alt+V` (macOS).
4. The image path is inserted and ready for use.

**Installation & Config**
Install it from the [VS Code Marketplace](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=doonfrs.terminal-paste-image-vscode) ‚Äì no extra setup required. Check the docs for more configuration options.

If you encounter any issues or want to suggest improvements, check out the [GitHub repo](https://github.com/doonfrs/terminal-paste-image-vscode) üõ†Ô∏è.

If you find this useful, I‚Äôd really appreciate a **rating ‚≠ê** on the Marketplace or a **coffee** via [Buy Me a Coffee](https://buymeacoffee.com/doonfrs) ‚òïüôè.

Here is a super detailed review of my recent 8-day journey from Athens to Venice, August 29-Sept 5, 2025 on Explora I in the Cove Residence.

FYI, I am not a travel agent, blogger, or anything else. I have been on 2 cruises, my mom had never been on one. We are two normal working people who splashed out a bit for a once-in-a-lifetime trip.

# About the trip

My mother (70) and I (38M) decided to book a trip to Greece for her birthday, which had already passed, as she has always wanted to go to Greece. After researching many options, including land tours and other cruise lines, I decided on Explora based on great value and positive reviews as well as an itinerary that fit our timing. My mother values luxury and great food, and Explora was purported to have nailed these two topics.

# Booking and Pre-Boarding

**Online/booking experience**

I'm an IT Manager and I found the technical experience both pre and during the journey to be difficult and awful. There wasn't much I could fault Explora for, which you will see as you read on, but their technology is buggy, unintuitive, and generally doesn't work.

I regret not using a travel agent and would recommend doing so for anyone looking to book on Explora. Nevertheless, we initially booked an 8 day journey in an [Ocean Terrace Suite ](https://explorajourneys.com/ca/en/ships/explora-III/ocean-terrace-suites)(two twin beds) from Athens to Istanbul in early September. As time went on, our availability changed so I attempted to change our itinerary to the Journey Through Classical Antiquity and Botanical Beauty, Athens to Venice, August 29-Sept 5, 2025.

The process to change the itinerary was hell. Explora has a rather complicated set of change/cancelation policies which, after phoning/corresponding with 4 different staff over the course of 3 weeks, none of them seemed to know. We were approaching the 151-days-prior-to-sailing date where they begin to charge penalties, and different staff tried to charge me different amounts despite still being in the time where changes were free. I had to comb through and highlight their own policies to them several times, but finally we were able to change to the Athens to Venice journey. It took a couple days to show up properly in my online account.

A couple of months later, after watching many reviews showing the two twin beds basically pressed against each other, we decided to upgrade to the [Cove Residence](https://explorajourneys.com/ca/en/ships/explora-III/cove-residences) so we could have separate sleeping areas and enough space for two adults who are accustomed to living alone. This was no problem to get booked, nor was booking anything else that cost money, including 4 Destination Experiences and the Anthology restaurant.

Booking dining, however, was completely impossible. The site would let me go all the way through with the time and venue selection, then error out without telling me. I tried 5 times to book dining to no avail. I can imagine this would be very confusing to those with limited tech skills because it never actually told me the venues weren't booked, it just redirected me back to the main page on my journey. We were able to get bookings through our butler, but I imagine this may have been more difficult if we didn't have him.I also could not book transfers to the embarkation or from the disembarkation to our hotel online despite this being offered via my online account. I finally called them as this was going to be an issue, and a very helpful agent (Edbert Esparagoza) got everything booked. More on transfers below.

**Travel to the cruise port**

My mother and I were traveling from separate locations in North America, meeting in Athens. We booked air travel on our own, not through the cruise line (though they do offer this).

We arrived about 36 hours prior to sail away, which I would recommend. The day before our flights, the Air Traffic Controllers in Greece threatened a strike, which I've learned is common. Give yourself extra time. [The strike ended up being squashed by the Greece government](https://www.ekathimerini.com/economy/1279110/court-blocks-air-traffic-controllers-strike-flights-to-operate-normally/) and we arrived on time.

**Staying in Athens**

We stayed one night at the [Athens Gate Hotel](https://www.athensgate.gr/), which I would recommend. It was clean and simple, staff were helpful, location is beautiful, and the dinner (paid extra, about 50 euro) and included breakfast on the rooftop overlooking the Acropolis were both lovely. Note that they seemed to throttle our air conditioning at night, which was uncomfortable for my mother as the night temps were still around 26C/78F.

[The view from dinner](https://preview.redd.it/64mqnm18lbof1.png?width=1154&format=png&auto=webp&s=4d86a4abad46301232bfd6db0ba62bea161c923e)

# Embarkation

***Residence Disclaimer:*** this experience is not the same for those who don't have the Residence perks.

**Included transfer**

The Cove Residence gives passengers included round trip airport/hotel transfers to/from the ship. After calling in to book, we got a HUGE luxury van driven by a local. He was friendly and knowledgeable, handed our bags, and got us to the port within 20 mins.

**Getting on the ship/to the room**

The Cove Residence also gives priority boarding. At the cruise terminal (Piraeus), we were met by 3 men in suits who whisked away our large bags. One of them took my mother's hand luggage and escorted us through the security lineup (no priority lineup/fast track) and straight to the Cove Residence (room 6009), which was ready at 1pm when we arrived.

Non-Residence guests do not get included transfers, though I think they can be booked for a fee, do not get help going through security, and have to wait for their rooms to be ready. I heard that Explora waits for all rooms to be ready before allowing any guests into them.

Our butler and room attendant met us in the room and did a complete tour. A bottle of champagne was waiting for us. After the tour, our butler left to do a couple of the things we requested (book dining, mostly), and we were able to have some downtime before dinner.

# The Room

As I said, we were in [Cove Residence](https://explorajourneys.com/ca/en/ships/explora-III/cove-residences) 6009. You can see a video tour of a Cove Residence [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6nduOLi27bk). The room was exceptional, with a full-size dining table, another table for two on the terrace, a double-size terrace with a two-person jacuzzi bathtub (hot/cold water, jets, and you can use bath products as with any normal bathtub).

I slept on the large pullout couch and my mom had the king size bedroom. Both ""beds"" were comfortable.

The bathroom is the normal bathroom in the Ocean Terrace suites, with a large shower and a reasonable sized vanity/one sink.

The room was very quiet at all times and did not get much motion in choppier water due to being on deck 6, mid-ship. The location one flight of stairs from the coffee shop and two up from the lobby bar was great when running for a coffee or cocktail. I would choose this room location again.

I recommend watching the linked video above for more room information. We were very happy with the room. The XL terrace was a massive benefit, including being able to run a cold bath for basically my own private mini-pool.

Note: some of the Cove Residences are located above Crema Cafe, which has a smoking terrace outside. The guy who did our upgrade advised us of this and we picked one on the opposite side of the ship.

[Cove Residence 6009 terrace ](https://preview.redd.it/76wtc8k4nbof1.png?width=1154&format=png&auto=webp&s=3184005bf1855ad8c9656a86c90a5e8d553130dd)



# Room and General Technology 

It may seem odd to include this in its own category, but it's worth noting that all the lights and curtains are mostly controlled by a panel on the wall by the front door, and it didn't work very well. We could not dim several of the large lights, which was difficult because they were extremely bright. There are wall ""switches,"" but they're totally un-intuitive to the point that even as an IT professional, I couldn't get them working properly. 

This may seem picky, but I wanted to note it as my mother basically needed me to manage her bedside lights so she could sleep. Again, Explora needs serious tech help, both on the web and in the rooms. 

The app did work fine once on board, and the included wi-fi was strong, with up to 3 devices per person allowed at once. 

# Cove Residence Benefits

The Cove Residence included the following benefits:

[Room inclusions](https://preview.redd.it/dk5ede68ibof1.png?width=1177&format=png&auto=webp&s=064d2fd97d17ad4d7bdbacb68f960a36bad6b5d4)

**Butler service**

We are normal people (mom is a nurse, I work for the government) who don't vacation like this typically. We have never had a butler and I was concerned I'd feel awkward about it, but our butler, Terrance, was exceptional, as was our room attendant (housekeeping), Kusuma. Terrance was natural and accommodating without being overbearing. Kusuma kept the room in absolutely pristine condition at all times.

Terrance helped us get dinner reservations (and move them when we were unable to attend one of them), handled our laundry and pressing, served us breakfast in-room almost every day, and arranged an in-suite cocktail hour we hosted for some friends we met on the ship.

Terrance and Kusuma were incredibly thoughtful and good at anticipating our needs. They also arranged a special birthday surprise for my mom, including a ""towel birthday cake"" in her room with a birthday playlist on the TV, a special cake at Anthology, and a special bottle of Explora-branded Moet & Chandon champagne on the final night.

[A birthday cake made of towels](https://preview.redd.it/vygyl67f4cof1.png?width=482&format=png&auto=webp&s=7683352fb99d7c55b5b90428aff7d6438750f954)

**Laundry**

Our clothes were really wrinkled and both of us only brought one set of ""airplane clothes,"" so we had Terrance send them to be pressed/laundered. This took about a day but the items returned in great condition and the small items came in a wicker basket wrapped in tissue!

Note: everything on the ship has the ""Signature Explora Mandala Blue"" scent, including the laundry. If you're sensitive to scents, please let staff know and they will use unscented products in the room and, to some extent, in the laundry. That said, you will not be able to get away from the high level of scent from other passengers who use the scented products and/or their own, sometimes very strong, perfumes.

[Small laundered items ](https://preview.redd.it/o48czllfmbof1.png?width=654&format=png&auto=webp&s=cc8beba57646a89239bc7fb543e767a219b31fd4)

**In-suite dining**

We ordered breakfast to the room nearly every day. The ""extended breakfast menu"" included a couple of items from Fil Rouge, the French restaurant which is also open for sit-down breakfast daily. The food was good, and we were able to add notes, for example asking for the fruit salad to be berries only. Breakfast was brought to the room on a silver tray, and Terrance set up either the indoor or outdoor table based on our preference with a white tablecloth and cutlery.

I believe in-suite breakfast and 24 hour room service is included for any guest/room; check this on your own.

[Breakfast on the terrace](https://preview.redd.it/58gxay0v3cof1.png?width=654&format=png&auto=webp&s=1090accc09bb6bf3ea54f7a3ca4471681ece2a54)

**In-suite hosting**

After meeting 7 friends on the ship, we decided to host a one-hour sail away wine and appies party on the final night (Zadar, Croatia). Terrance organized this and brought tons of wonderful appies from the room service menu including cheeses, shrimp cocktail (huge shrimp!), spring rolls, etc. and plenty of wine and sparking wine (note: not champagne) for the group. The terrace could have held at least 5 more guests, but it would have been cramped in the room.

[Private sail away party in our room\/terrace](https://preview.redd.it/k3tzqs15mbof1.png?width=1536&format=png&auto=webp&s=ab678473c1a30a4ce3ba68467849ca20bcd4c2ff)

# The Ship (Explora I)

There are many great ship tours you can look up, so I'll keep this part brief. The ship is beautiful, serene, and well laid out. We sailed at about 80% capacity and never found any area to be crowded. They have done a great job making little coves for people to hang out in so you don't feel overwhelmed by a crowd. My favourite locations were the Explora Lounge, Whiskey Bar, Crema Cafe, and the Sky Bar.

[Explora Lounge](https://preview.redd.it/9sqm55b6pbof1.png?width=654&format=png&auto=webp&s=a354a1de5e55059a9fb6494e6ce26cb70efb56e8)

# Food

Again, there are many detailed food reviews you can watch, so I'll keep this relatively short. My one overall note is that for a European line, they want you done with dinner by 9:30/10pm in most venues. They could keep things open a bit later, especially since sail away is often not until 7pm.

**Emporium Marketplace (""Buffet"")**

The marketplace is the ""buffet"" venue, though it is either sit-down-and-be-served or go to the various counters and be served by a cook. The food was of great quality, and there were premium offerings such as roasts, fresh pasta made to order, oysters/seafood bar, and sushi bar. Service was prompt and friendly.

Note: their hours are a bit minimal, with lunch running from 12:30-2:30 only. Staff will refuse to serve you after that time. You can find food in the Explora Lounge and Crema Cafe between 12:30 and dinner time, or order room service.

**Fil Rouge**

Very good quality French cuisine. Service wasn't as good as other venues, likely because we arrived at 9pm and they have to reset the place for breakfast. Try to go earlier. Comfortable atmosphere.

**Med Yacht Club**

This was our favourite restaurant. All food, including meat or seafood, was prepared beautifully. Try the beef carpaccio and sea bass. The filet here is also very good. A wide variety of options including fish of the day. Excellent service and most comfortable room/ambience in my opinion.

**Marble & Co.**

Huge disappointment here. It seems that the europeans who run this line need to get a guest chef from the US/Canada to teach them what a steakhouse is. This venue seems to try to be both a bistro and a classic American steakhouse and doesn't succeed at either. Room was the least comfortable, decor was awkward ""Euro Western,"" and sadly, the steaks weren't very good. The tableside caesar was laughable: a pre-made dressing tossed on the romaine in a loud, obnoxious porcelain bowl right beside your ear, then adding some croutons that are dry and dusty like the ones you'd get in a bag at the grocery store (eek!); it's also the same caesar at the Marketplace. Do NOT order the filet here unless you like very thin, very dry meat. That said, order the crab bisque and let them put the scotch in it. It's delicious.

**Anthology**

Incredible and worth it. We weren't sure about the extra cost here, but the meal is absolutely stunning, the ingredients are super-premium, the service is exceptional, and the room, though modern, is comfortable. The one thing I'd change is that Anthology is located right off the lobby bar upper level and the music clashed. Other than that, I would highly recommend spending the money on this. We could have left off the wine pairing simply because it's a lot of booze. They have good wines you can order in here, though I've heard some have to push them to be able to order the all-ship included wines. DEFINITELY get the A5 Wagyu; it will change your life.

[A5 Waygu beef at Anthology](https://preview.redd.it/9kcxeaj8sbof1.png?width=1154&format=png&auto=webp&s=69eac44ce9aa3c1436ed07edcae9da5373656a48)

**Sakura**

Sadly, we didn't get to go to Sakura due to having to move our (already paid for) Anthology reservation to that night after one of us wasn't feeling well on the original Anthology night. We heard rave reviews about this venue, with many saying it was their favourite.

# Beverages

Overall note here is that the cocktails do not match the quality and precision of the food. I'd recommend Explora contract a serious mixologist to train their bar staff for consistency. The drinks were good in many venues but certainly nowhere close to the level of presentation and precision of the food, and the same drink would be totally different from bar to bar.

**Crema Cafe**

Great coffee, especially if staff member Jam makes it. Others could be inconsistent with special orders (iced latte, for example, came layered with hot milk over ice when not made by Jam). Little bites (sweet/savory) all day. A good espresso martini as well.

**Lobby Bar**

Friendly, high-quality bar service. Great menu; try the Single Fashioned if you like scotch. Busy bar at night; live music from the piano and guitar players upstairs.

**Whiskey Bar**

Limited but reasonable whiskeys in a comfortable atmosphere. The one and only bad service experience I had was here, and it was down to that staff member just being rude. Everyone else was great, and this is a fun venue if you like whiskey. Humidor and smoking lounge adjacent; the door kept the smoke smell contained.

**Explora Lounge Bar**

Best staff, same menu as the lobby bar. Nice venue any time of day.

**Sky Bar**

""Pool bar"" vibes, don't expect great cocktails here, but great ambience and fun DJ late night dancing many nights.

**Astern Lounge Bar**

Great staff, good quality drinks, same menu as the lobby bar, this is the ""night club"" which is a bit laughable as it was empty by midnight.

**Helios Bar**

Again, a pool bar. Decent.

I/we didn't try any of the other bars.

**Drinks at dinner**

You can order cocktails from the ""Lobby Bar Menu"" at any dinner venue, and they are of good quality, usually made by the Lobby or Explora Lounge bar staff. Note: they don't have a service bar on the ship, so this service can be a bit slow.

# Itinerary

We were very happy with the itinerary as two people who have not traveled to this region before. Kefalonia was particularly beautiful. We were often the only cruise ship in the area/port, and we got in early most days, allowing for full-day exploring.

[Itinerary](https://preview.redd.it/rnu29gt41cof1.png?width=839&format=png&auto=webp&s=c2e5ce3e54102675658fa3e82775c0dbbdc81062)

# Destination Experiences

**General Notes**

We booked 4 destination experiences using our $1500CAD booking credits.

Note all prices below are in Canadian Dollars ($1.62CAD=1 euro)

**A note about accessibility**

This is a very old region of the world, and things are not built to any North American standard of accessibility. There are MANY stairs, often made of stone and quite steep. Lots of walking in the 26-30C/80-90F heat. Choose wisely if you're not up for this. There were other passengers complaining they were not made aware of the physical strenuousness of some of their excursions.

**Discover the Wines of Samos (Samos, Greece)**

https://preview.redd.it/znd1pdmpvbof1.png?width=933&format=png&auto=webp&s=1101e94f74de82413728968f5210b326df9920e2

Discover the Wines of Samos was a fun, two hour tour of the viticultural museum with an tasting of 7 wines at the end. The wines were surprisingly delicious, though mostly very sweet. There is an opportunity to buy wines at the end, though no pushiness. The guide's English was difficult to understand as she also spoke quietly. I would probably not spend my actual money on this one, especially since you can walk there from the dock and do it yourself.

**Ancient Olympia and Grecian Exports (Olympia, Greece)**

https://preview.redd.it/y1xuzmf3wbof1.png?width=465&format=png&auto=webp&s=48acfa577c8b0dfd4d66a127f72e2a9e0129c097

Ancient Olympia and Grecian Exports was **by far the best value**. Don't miss this. Our guide was an archaeologist who knew a ton about Olympia and the region, and the visit to Magna Grecia was an incredible experience with a surprise full lunch that was delicious. Shopping for gifts here is top-notch; high quality and reasonable prices.

**Melissani Cave and Assos Peninsula (Kefalonia, Greece)**

https://preview.redd.it/5hvom3vlwbof1.png?width=449&format=png&auto=webp&s=b537f042aec988584b05065780a343253ca9967d

Melissani Cave and Assos Peninsula was also an incredible value for the money. This (Kefalonia) was also the most beautiful port of call. The guide gave us great recommendations for food in the main town, which is a few steps from the dock. I highly recommend getting the goat's milk feta and Kefalonian meat pie at any of the restaurants in town, and try the Kefalonian microbrew lager.

[Kefalonia from the mountain top](https://preview.redd.it/gyhoonr5ybof1.png?width=1154&format=png&auto=webp&s=0f0c7e648b30b6cd7057fe049d60569657a4be19)

**Zadar's Ancient and Modern Architecture by Tuk-Tuk (Zadar, Croatia)**

https://preview.redd.it/itsc07k0xbof1.png?width=460&format=png&auto=webp&s=43fbde5f5fdf501c299d90749eb0caf914069445

Zadar by Tuk-Tuk was so much fun, and our young guide gave us a great tour over the 2 hour duration. There is both a morning and afternoon session; we did the afternoon but should have booked the morning as Zadar is worth an all-day visit. We had to leave before the walking portion to make our dinner reservation, but I heard it was great.

[A ride through Zadar by Tuk-Tuk](https://preview.redd.it/6t38o6x8ybof1.png?width=1154&format=png&auto=webp&s=c2da9d6e09788c07f277bc0a7724e8f97ca8533d)

# Daily Program

The daily program was left in our room the night before as is customary, with plenty of time to decide on things to do. That said, most of the activities were scheduled during time in port or dinner time for us, so we missed out on many things.

The programming was...well...boring, but not as boring as the entertainment (see more below). This is an area Explora definitely needs to improve upon, adding more interesting and varied offerings for longer durations (many of the activities ran for 45 min only). The program, like the entertainment, seemed like an afterthought and a poor copy of Silversea or other lines geared toward older people despite Explora claiming to target the 35-70 market and families.

[A sample daily program](https://preview.redd.it/vl8w45v16cof1.png?width=654&format=png&auto=webp&s=a081681a89fc74623da80c428812f08a07733a41)

**Entertainment**

Much has been said about how poor the entertainment on Explora I is. I think they know they need to improve this, and I don't have much to say about it beyond that:

\- The shows are corny

\- The performers are too talented to be doing crap like this

\- The sound system in the Journeys Lounge is awful for high singers, and people were holding their ears because it was so loud

I would not recommend booking on Explora if you're wanting high-quality, entertaining shows.

# Service

The service overall was very good, as many have said. Obviously, having a butler helped, but we found many of the staff to be very helpful. That said, I've heard that Explora sourced their staff not from other cruise lines but from hotels, and it showed. This is definitely more of a ""refined hotel"" service than a ""entertaining/fun/friendly"" cruise service. The staff often seemed tired and trying to do too many things at once. Nevertheless, they were friendly and professional. It (outside of the butler) just wasn't the ultra-luxury level of service Explora is claiming to have.

# Social/Other Passengers

Most of the passengers on this journey were European or from the US. They clustered around the 60-70 age range. There were about 25 children, mostly teens and a few babies. We did not feel ""intruded upon' by the children, and there was no obnoxious adults or children yelling or acting crazy. People were friendly, with most people being similar to us: regular people who had saved up for this, not rich people. We had some nice conversations and made a few friends. It was mostly couples and families, though Explora does have a daily ""solo traveler"" social hour.

This was a good passenger mix for my 70 y/o mother and I, but it was probably a bit old/sedate for me to do alone at 38. I would likely pick Celebrity or Virgin if I wanted a level of luxury but a bit more ""pizzaz"" and fellow Millennials.

The line is very LGBTQ+ friendly, as were the passengers, in my experience.

# Cost

The room was booked on a promotion and cost approx $20,000 CAD for 7 nights/8 days.

Anthology cost about $550CAD including the wine pairing for both of us.

There were no extra ship charges other than a 5% fee we paid to withdraw cash euros from Guest Services.

Transfers were included (see more about the value this provides in Venice specifically).

We tipped generously for all service staff, our butler, our room attendant, tour guides, baggage handlers, and customer service staff at restaurants etc. in port. Yes, gratuities are included in the price, but we felt the service deserved extra, especially our butler.

# Disembarkation

Disembarkation in Venice (Fusina Port) was smooth. Again, we had a transfer included due to the Cove Residence. A driver met us at the port and took us to the boat pickup. We had a private ""guide"" to meet us, move our luggage on/off the boat, ride with us to our hotel, and take us right into the lobby; this was all included and was a godsend given that I'd otherwise have had to manage my mom's 3 pieces of luggage plus my own on/off boats and through the cobblestone streets of Venice. The transfer boat was very luxurious and the ""guide"" chatted with us about Venice for the approx 15 min boat ride through the Grand Canal.

Note: we had to pay for our 20 min ride from our hotel to the airport and it was 150 euros, which makes the included transfers a good value in my opinion.

[Included transfer from cruise ship to Venice hotel](https://preview.redd.it/dpcr7c4n2cof1.png?width=774&format=png&auto=webp&s=e73547369768bb638e46ef536277090959c625d3)

# Venice

Lastly, a few quick notes about Venice if you're going to go. We stayed at the Palazzo San Luca, which as a great two-bedroom suite outside of the busy part of town but still walking distance to everything, including one block to the canal, where we picked up our airport transfer boat at the end. I would recommend the hotel.

If you're in Venice, do not miss out on [Row Venice](https://rowvenice.org/), a women-owned company who will teach you to paddle a gondola-style boat (batelina)! We booked the Cicchetto Row so my mother, instead of paddling, could sit for the ride and be served appies and wine from a few places along the canal. A must-do experience.

[Paddling with Row Venice](https://preview.redd.it/w5w66asf2cof1.png?width=654&format=png&auto=webp&s=f8afeee4c00626d334311d89ab58c03e6fcf4db4)

I work 12-hour shifts at 2x/week and will occasionally make myself an iced latte for the day before going in, after which I‚Äôll ALWAYS clean the cup once I‚Äôm back home. I only started making these lattes more frequently over the last 6 months, but recently I noticed a sort of weird smell coming from the body of the cup, sort of like an old coffee/mildew-ish odor. I occasionally will soak the cup in warm water and dish soap for an hour or so after I‚Äôm home too (which I‚Äôve always done prior to the smell even starting), but I feel as though it‚Äôs been getting worse. I even frequently ‚Äúdeep clean‚Äù the cup by taking apart all the little pieces, but the smell seems to be most concentrated in the body, not as much in the lid or straw.

I‚Äôm pretty sensitive to odors and have already placed an order for a replacement stainless steel tumbler for my iced coffees (the Fellow Carter), but I don‚Äôt want to just toss aside the Nomad after only less than a year. I was just worried that because of the plastic material of the Nomad, smells like this are unavoidable, especially since I‚Äôm only using it with coffee. But my favorite aspect of the cup was that it‚Äôs clear and allows me to see through it, since I like to try and make my lattes look pretty and line the walls with syrups. (Obviously it‚Äôs not the end-of-the-world with me switching to stainless steel, but sometimes I like to show off my efforts, you know?)

I was worried that because I work such long shifts, the smell is a result of the cup going uncleaned for several hours of the day. I started rinsing out the cup with water at work once I was finished so that the residual coffee only remains for 4 hours max, but there‚Äôs been no improvement. And I admit, there‚Äôs been times that I forgot to immediately clean the cup once I‚Äôm home and it‚Äôll just sit (honestly I once made a latte with a homemade banana syrup and forgot to clean it for several hours after work, and it definitely went bad‚Ä¶), but those are the days I‚Äôll also try to soak it in warm water and dish soap for some time before scrubbing it clean‚Äîstraw included. I always try to make sure the cup is fully dry before storing it away, or at least will typically leave the straw uncapped so that there‚Äôs some airflow into the cup in case there is any residual water. I‚Äôm not entirely concerned for any mold or mildew, but it definitely has that weird wet smell.

Is anyone else facing this same issue? Is there anything else I can do besides soaking the cup that will prevent the buildup of odor here-on out?",2,1757508347.0,nespresso,5,1.0,False

I've been really enjoying this community, and hope to further entrench myself in this hobby. I'm a big collector of figures, most of which are in the 5-7 inches range. I've been putting together dioramas, and would love some recommendations for book nooks. So far, I have found that Make Market has a few kits that scale well with 1:12. Their [Apothecary](https://www.michaels.com/product/apothecary-book-nook-kit-by-make-market-10775619?michaelsStore=1178&inv=7), for instance, goes great with [6 inch figures](https://www.reddit.com/r/ActionFigures/comments/1n6nmsb/store_bought_diorama/). Make Market also appears to have a few others that would work, such as the [Coffee Shop](https://www.michaels.com/product/coffee-shop-diorama-kit-by-make-market-10775622).

I would love to hear your thoughts and suggestions. From what I can see, most kits are 1:24 scale (Rolife). Are there other solid 1:12 kits out there, besides Make Market? I appreciate any insight! ",3,1757508153.0,booknooks,5,1.0,False

I wanted to share something that really stuck with me and honestly unsettled me.

After months of not seeing a close family member, I finally went to visit them. They‚Äôve been a Witness for decades, and like many of us here, they‚Äôve watched the Watchtower twist doctrines again and again.

We were in their little kitchen, drinking barley coffee, when the usual line came out about how we‚Äôre ‚Äúliving in the last days.‚Äù I let it slide for a while, but then I just asked:

*‚ÄúSo‚Ä¶ can you explain the overlapping generation to me?‚Äù*

Silence.

They looked past me, and then finally whispered: *‚ÄúI don‚Äôt know. I never really understood it myself. But what does it matter? Even if the Governing Body is wrong by twenty or thirty years, does it change anything?‚Äù*

And that‚Äôs what hit me. They believe in doctrines they can‚Äôt even explain anymore. Yet they don‚Äôt allow themselves a second of doubt. That scares me, because if they can accept contradictions like that, it means the organisation could ask for almost anything and they‚Äôd still obey.

How do you all react in these situations? Do you still try to have these conversations with your family, or have you stopped?

I am in the wedding as a bridesmaid. Some context: Her MOH planned her destination bachelorette and we had to pay for every last thing for the bride, we all paid over $1500 because this required airfare too on top of hotel, food, excursion, etc. A lot of the other bridesmaids were upset because the MOH only asked us to pay for the brides flight/hotel we didn‚Äôt expect everything else for the bride( she literally didn‚Äôt even pay for a coffee there). I also was a little hurt we didn‚Äôt even get a thank you text after because with other friends we always do that but I quickly moved on from it. I also bought her a bridal shower gift and obviously a dress, day of make up, heels, etc. I and a few other people in her grooms family keep a certain standard of eating due to religion and she told me a few months ago it would be accommodated. I got a text yesterday saying it is double the price of a regular plate so instead she will be giving us fruit plates. Mind you she did tell me before this wedding costs close to 150k. My mom is really angry for me because she said that is rude to text and then do a month before. I think I would care less if I didn‚Äôt do all this stuff for her. My mom is saying give $25 in a card or no gift and she doesn‚Äôt think I should stay close friends with her after this. How do I navigate moving forward in this friendship?

1ndd1gb,https://www.reddit.com/r/barista/comments/1ndd1gb/question_about_flat_whites_texture/,Question about flat white's texture,"So, flat white is my favorite of all coffee types with milk. I visit different coffee shops and I learned what I like in a flat white and what I don't like.

For me, perfect flat white is smooth, with very little air bubbles, a bit oily in texture, not too hot and of consistent structure. By consistent structure I mean that it doesn't have ""layers"", except maybe for a thin latte art layer.

But quite often, I get a coffee with different structure and I don't like it. It would have a top layer, sometimes very good one, but under that there would be a coffee layer of watery texture. Sometimes this bottom layer is also too hot. I don't like this experience, because I only like the top layer if it's served that way and then I find the disappointment.

And here's my question - is my perfect flat white your perfect flat white too? Are flat whites supposed to be consistent in texture like I described? I think the problem with those layered ones are improper mixing technique of milk and coffee, but I'm not a barista.

Please educate me, so I don't make a fool of myself in front of baristas when I ask them kindly to make another one üôÇ",0,1757507880.0,barista,23,0.29,False

In the fast-paced, sometimes chaotic world of Bitcoin, there‚Äôs one truth we can all agree on: typing out those long, complicated wallet addresses feels like solving a riddle written by a robot after drinking too much coffee. Seriously‚Äînobody wants to copy-paste a 34-character string of random numbers and letters when all they want to do is send or receive some sats. That‚Äôs where the magic of QR codes swoops in to save the day. And guess what? Our **free Bitcoin QR code maker app** at [https://www.bitcoinqrcodemaker.com](https://www.bitcoinqrcodemaker.com) makes it easier (and more fun) than ever to generate one.

# Why QR Codes Are a Bitcoin Superpower

Battle of New Orleans on January 8th

The Battle of New Orleans was the final major engagement of the War of 1812, fought on January 8, 1815, between British forces under Major General Sir Edward Pakenham and American forces led by Brevet Major General Andrew Jackson. Despite the Treaty of Ghent being signed on December 24, 1814, ending the war, news had not yet reached the combatants, leading to this decisive confrontation. The battle took place near New Orleans, Louisiana, approximately five miles southeast of the French Quarter, in the present-day suburb of Chalmette. The American forces, numbering around 5,700, were entrenched behind defensive lines along the Rodriguez Canal. The British, with a force of about 8,000, launched frontal assaults against the well-prepared American positions. The battle lasted less than an hour, resulting in a resounding American victory. The British suffered significant casualties, including the deaths of Generals Pakenham and Samuel Gibbs, while American losses were minimal.

We know this part of the Battle of NEw Orleans but how about the Chef Menteur HIghway?Chef Menteur Highway on December 23

The part of the Battle that intrigues me is Major General John Keane and the Chef Menteur Highway. A road in New Orleans that runs through marshy areas and connects to Lake Borgne and Lake Pontchartrain.

On the morning of December 23, 1814, during the War of 1812, British Major General John Keane led about 1,800 British soldiers to the east side of the Mississippi River. They were only about 9 miles south of New Orleans, which was a very important city for America. The British had traveled through swampy areas and waterways, surprising the American soldiers who were led by General Andrew Jackson. The Americans didn‚Äôt expect the British to come from that direction.

At this moment, Keane and his troops could have quickly attacked New Orleans. The city didn‚Äôt have many defenses along the river road, which meant the British could have reached it in just a few hours. If the British took New Orleans, they would have gained control over the Mississippi River and made things harder for America.

But instead of moving forward right away, Keane decided to stop and set up camp at Lacoste‚Äôs Plantation, which was close to the river and easy to defend. He wanted to wait for more soldiers to join him before attacking the city.

Why did Keane wait?

His soldiers were tired after traveling through difficult swamps

¬†He didn‚Äôt know much about how strong the American defenses were.

¬†Keane had strict orders

British command structure and discipline stopped him from making a decision on his own.

Looking back, Keane‚Äôs choice to wait gave the Americans time to prepare. This helped General Jackson and his troops get ready, and later, they won the Battle of New Orleans.

I started walking more, like taking hikes when I can and sometimes I felt it went away but it just comes back the next day and continues everyday after.

It doesn't really keep me up at night since it only activates when I step on my left foot. Right foot never felt this. When I strike my left heel on the floor I feel the small buzzing sensation as well. I assumed poor circulation but now I have no idea.

For context - I eat like 2-3 bananas a day (don't judge, I'm trying to be healthy) so I had tons of peels just going in the trash. Saw all these videos saying banana peels are loaded with potassium and will make your plants explode with growth. Seemed too good to be true but I'm always down for free fertilizer.

**My setup:**

* Used my sad spider plant that's been barely hanging on for 6 months
* One dying pothos that I keep forgetting to water
* Some random herbs on my windowsill
* Control group with my usual Miracle Gro routine

**Week 1-2: The honeymoon phase**¬†

Started with the classic ""bury chopped banana peels in soil"" method. Plants looked... exactly the same. But I was optimistic! Made banana peel tea by soaking peels in water for 24 hours. Smelled absolutely disgusting but whatever, science right?

Also tried the ""rub fresh banana peel on leaves"" thing I saw on Instagram. Felt ridiculous doing it but my plants were shiny afterward so there's that I guess?

**Week 3: Things got weird**¬†

My apartment started smelling funky. Turns out buried banana peels don't just magically disappear - they rot. And rotting banana peels smell like death mixed with fruit salad. Had to dig most of them out because my roommate was threatening to move out.

The banana tea was growing some interesting mold cultures too. Very colorful. Very gross.

**Week 4: Reality check**¬†

Spider plant actually looked a tiny bit greener but honestly could've been wishful thinking. The pothos was still being dramatic and dropping leaves. Herbs didn't seem to care either way.

Meanwhile my control group plants with regular fertilizer were clearly doing better. Like significantly better.

**What I learned:**

* Banana peels DO have potassium but it's not immediately available to plants
* They need to decompose properly (aka compost) to be useful
* Fresh peels buried in soil just create a smelly mess
* The TikTok videos probably sped up their footage over months, not weeks
* My plants were probably just happy I was paying attention to them for once

**The verdict:**¬†

Banana peel fertilizer isn't complete BS but it's not the miracle cure social media makes it out to be. If you're gonna do it, compost the peels first or add them to your worm bin (shoutout to my vermiculture people).

Don't just shove raw banana peels in your potting soil like an idiot. Learn from my mistakes.

Still eating 2-3 bananas a day though. And yes, I'm back to actual fertilizer because I'm not patient enough for the slow composting life. Maybe I'll try coffee grounds next month and report back on that disaster.

Best decision I've made in years.

For those who don't know, vermiculture is basically having pet worms that eat your kitchen scraps and poop out the most incredible fertilizer you've ever seen. No joke - worm castings are called ""black gold"" for a reason.

**Here's what blew my mind:**

My setup cost me $40 total (plastic bins, bedding, and 1000 red wigglers from Uncle Jim's). I was spending about $20/month on fertilizer for my balcony garden plus another $15/month on organic waste fees. Do the math - I'm saving nearly $400 annually.

But the real kicker? My plants are absolutely nuts now. Like, my tomatoes are producing twice as much as last year and I literally did nothing different except switch to worm poop. My basil plant is basically a bush at this point. My neighbors keep asking what steroids I'm feeding my plants lol.

**The process is stupidly simple but took me a few tries:**

* Worms eat vegetable scraps, coffee grounds, eggshells
* They digest it and poop out castings
* Plants go crazy for this stuff
* Zero smell when done right (mine smells like forest floor)

**Things I screwed up so you don't have to:**

* Fed them orange peels week one - big mistake, everything got moldy and gross
* Made the bin too wet and it smelled like death for a week straight
* Panicked when half my worms tried to escape (turns out the pH was off)
* Kept checking on them every day like an anxious parent - they're fine, leave them alone
* Added too much food initially and it just rotted

The crazy part is I'm keeping like 3 pounds of food scraps out of the trash every week. That's gotta be over 150 pounds a year that's actually doing something useful instead of sitting in a landfill making methane.

My girlfriend thought I was being weird but now she's bragging to her coworkers about our ""pet worms"" and how good our cherry tomatoes taste.

The worms multiply like crazy too. Started with 1000 and I swear there's like 3000 in there now. Thinking about splitting into a second bin because they're eating everything I throw at them.

Anyone else doing this? Feel like I'm late to the party but also feel like I discovered some secret life hack. Also is it weird that I get excited about worm poop? Because I definitely get excited about worm poop now.",1,1757507121.0,FancyChicken,0,1.0,False

( i need every seconds detail ?? that what- what you have thought and done on every single second )

can you tell me every single detail of your `1 cheapest Minute Or your whole hour, day, week, month, year or your whole life ??

if you are not able to tell me about this life then what proof do you have that you didn't forget your past ? and that you will not forget this present life in the future ?

that is Fact that Supreme Lord Krishna exists but we posses no such intelligence to understand him.
there is also next life. and i already proved you that no scientist, no politician, no so-called intelligent man in this world is able to understand this Truth. cuz they are imagining. and you cannot imagine what is god, who is god, what is after life etc.
_______
for example :Your father existed before your birth. you cannot say that before your birth your father don,t exists.

So you have to ask from mother, ""Who is my father?"" And if she says, ""This gentleman is your father,"" then it is all right. It is easy.
Otherwise, if you makes research, ""Who is my father?"" go on searching for life; you'll never find your father.

( now maybe...maybe you will say that i will search my father from D.N.A, or i will prove it by photo's, or many other thing's which i will get from my mother and prove it that who is my Real father.{ So you have to believe the authority. who is that authority ? she is your mother. you cannot claim of any photo's, D.N.A or many other things without authority ( or ur mother ).

if you will show D.N.A, photo's, and many other proofs from other women then your mother. then what is use of those proofs ??} )

same you have to follow real authority. ""Whatever You have spoken, I accept it,"" Then there is no difficulty. And You are accepted by Devala, Narada, Vyasa, and You are speaking Yourself, and later on, all the acaryas have accepted. Then I'll follow.
I'll have to follow great personalities. The same reason mother says, this gentleman is my father. That's all. Finish business. Where is the necessity of making research? All authorities accept Krsna, the Supreme Personality of Godhead. You accept it; then your searching after God is finished.

Why should you waste your time?

1ndckd6,https://www.reddit.com/r/SpotlessSecrets/comments/1ndckd6/explore_if_aunt_fannies_vinegar_wipes_truly/,Explore if Aunt Fannies Vinegar Wipes Truly Tackle Tough Messes,"Aunt Fannie‚Äôs Natural Cleaning Vinegar Wipes caught my attention because I‚Äôve been on the hunt for a cleaning product that‚Äôs environmentally friendly while still packing a serious punch against household grime. For someone like me, who juggles spilling coffee in the kitchen, crafting experiments gone awry on the dining table, and muddy paw prints courtesy of my overenthusiastic dog, effective cleaning gear is essential. These wipes promised a clean home with natural ingredients, and after trying them out, I‚Äôve got plenty to say‚Äîboth good and bad. Let‚Äôs dive in!  

**Multipurpose Use and Design**  
One of the immediate things I noticed about this product was how versatile and practical it felt. The canister houses a collection of 35 eucalyptus-scented cleaning wipes that claim to tackle dirt and grime across surfaces like kitchen counters, bathroom tiles, and even food-contact surfaces such as highchair trays. I tried them in different areas of the house, and they performed remarkably well. Stains left by condiments or makeup wiped off surfaces in seconds, and they didn‚Äôt leave behind sticky residue or streaks. The eucalyptus scent also added a refreshing, spa-like vibe to my home‚Äîa surprising bonus amidst the usual lemony or artificial smells typical of cleaning products.  

The wipes themselves were a good size‚Äîlarge enough to handle significant messes but still compact enough to fit in my hand comfortably. However, the canister design could use some updates. There were times when pulling out a single wipe turned into a wrestling match with the packaging, which could get frustrating when cleaning in a hurry.  

**Ease of Use and Formula**  
What set these wipes apart during day-to-day use was their safe, natural formulation. Comprised of vinegar, plant-based cleansers, and essential oils, these biodegradable wipes were free of harsh substances like alcohol and artificial chemicals. Knowing they were safe around pets and kids gave me extra peace of mind. My little nephew even ""helped"" me clean his crayon-smeared tray without any issues, which speaks volumes about the product‚Äôs gentle formula. The Environmental Working Group (EWG) A-rating also reassured me that this wasn‚Äôt just greenwashing‚Äîit‚Äôs genuinely a safer choice for households like mine.  

That said, the vinegar smell is a double-edged sword. Although it‚Äôs softened by the eucalyptus scent, the vinegar still peeks through, especially if you‚Äôre sensitive to strong odors. My partner, who isn‚Äôt a fan of vinegar-based cleaning products, found the smell a bit off-putting initially. However, it does dissipate after a few minutes, making it less of a deal-breaker for us.

**Good Aspects**  
- Natural, plant-based ingredients safe for pets and kids  
- Biodegradable and compostable, ideal for eco-conscious households  
- Effective, streak-free cleaning on various surfaces  
- Refreshing eucalyptus scent adds an unexpectedly pleasant touch  

[Check Aunt Fannie's Natural Cleaning Vinegar Wipes price on Amazon.](https://blog.senaar.com/p/b01n5cxuec/)  

**Areas for Improvement**  
- Strong vinegar smell might not be for everyone  
- Packaging can make pulling out individual wipes tricky  
- Limited wipe count (35 per canister) may not meet the needs of larger families  

**Performance vs Similar Products**  
Compared to conventional all-purpose cleaning wipes like Clorox or Lysol, Aunt Fannie‚Äôs Vinegar Wipes lean heavily into their natural, eco-friendly credentials. While traditional options might obliterate germs within seconds, they often achieve this using harsh chemicals. On the other hand, these wipes focus on keeping your home clean and fresh without relying on anything potentially harmful to you, your family, or the planet. I wouldn‚Äôt necessarily recommend these for disinfecting purposes; they shine more as a day-to-day cleaner for smaller messes.  

If you‚Äôre comparing them to other natural cleaning options, Method and Seventh Generation offer similar green products but often rely on more fruity or subtle fragrances. Aunt Fannie‚Äôs wipes, in contrast, embrace that vinegar-heavy punch, which may be an acquired taste but signals their ingredient-forward approach.

**Cost-Effectiveness**  
On the spectrum of cleaning products, I‚Äôd consider this product to fall into the workable middle ground. You‚Äôre essentially paying for peace of mind‚Äîknowing your purchase aligns with sustainability goals and prioritizes user safety. If you‚Äôre someone who looks at cleaning agents as an investment in health and the environment, these wipes are worth exploring. However, if your primary metric is price per use, the limited number of wipes per canister might feel restrictive. That said, as a biodegradable and compostable product, you could argue that they‚Äôre worth every penny for environmentally conscious users.

\
Alt text: Business professionals discussing startup strategy in a modern corporate setting. and Forbes Business, Bahrain‚Äôs non-oil economy grew by 4.3% in Q1 2025, fueled by strong investment in fintech and digital services‚Äîmuch of it concentrated in Manama‚Äôs business zones. With over 70% of new commercial registrations in 2024 linked to startups and SMEs, per Gulf News, the requirements for business banking have changed fast, with new digital banking entrants and faster onboarding for foreign-owned companies.\
If you‚Äôre exploring Bahrain company formation, you need up-to-date, local insight: not just a list of banks, but practical guidance, cost breakdowns, and battle-tested insider tips for saving time and money. I‚Äôve learned‚Äîsometimes the hard way‚Äîhow to open a corporate account swiftly, where to avoid queues, how to prep your Sijilat docs, and which banking services are must-haves for startups-eyeing growth.\
Bahrain‚Äôs 2025 Business Environment: Surge of Opportunity\
\
Alt text: Business environment in modern setting. initiatives. According to the official government portal, foreign direct investment inflows topped $1.4bn in 2024, with startups benefiting from fast-track visa issuance via the LMRA, Tamkeen SME support, and new commercial zones in Bahrain Bay and Seef.\
Important: Bahrain‚Äôs regulatory authorities‚ÄîMOICT for commercial registration, CBB for banking, and the LMRA for labor‚Äîhave rolled out faster online verification systems. However, practical hurdles still exist, like document translation quirks and sudden Ramadan hour adjustments. Expect a blend of digital efficiency and traditional in-person rituals: it‚Äôs not unusual for a banking appointment to begin with Arabic coffee and a quick chat about family (my first National Bank of Bahrain meeting in the Diplomatic Area was pure majlis-style).\
Bahrain vs. UAE & Saudi Arabia: The Startup Edge\
Having done business in both Dubai and Riyadh, I can say Bahrain‚Äôs speed of registration, lower minimum capital, and friendly banking compliance teams provide a real advantage. The absence of a corporate income tax, widespread 100% foreign ownership (details here), and simplified free zone benefits (explore Bahrain free zones) make it highly competitive. But speed is only real if your paperwork is 100% correct on the first try.\
Types of Banking Services Available for Startups\
\
Alt text: Business structure and collaboration. is a business bank account. Major providers include:\
\
National Bank of Bahrain (NBB)\
Al Salam Bank\
Bank ABC\
Khaleeji Bank\
Bahrain Islamic Bank (BisB)\
\
Each offers specialized SME onboarding teams in the Seef and Diplomatic Area branches‚Äîa major time-saver if you want to avoid lengthy queues (I always recommend the Diplomatic Area branch for NBB, as it opens early and processes startup accounts faster post-pandemic).\
Key Features:\
- Multi-currency accounts (BHD, USD, EUR, GBP)\
- Quick online access via strong digital banking apps\
- Cheque books (often optional; digital payments dominate)\
- Integration with Sijilat and LMRA for compliance\
Insider tip: Prepare your company Sijil, Commercial Registration certificate, and all shareholder passports in advance‚Äîscanned and hard copy. Missing passport copies or translation errors delay the process by days, not hours.\
2. Payment Gateways and E-Commerce Integration\
For tech or online startups, banks like BisB and Al Salam partner with global gateway providers‚Äîthink PayTabs, Tap Payments, and regional solutions compatible with Bahrain‚Äôs CBB mandates. Easy integration with your website or app is a must, but expect 2-5 working days for KYC checks.\
3. Startup Business Credit\
Credit lines for registered startups have become easier to access in 2025, following the Tamkeen and CBB‚Äôs startup innovation funds. Most banks offer:\
\
Overdrafts (starting from BHD 2,000, subject to business plan review)\
Short-term working capital loans\
SME business credit cards (with limits BHD 1,000‚Äì10,000)\
\
4. Payroll and Employee Banking Solutions\
Bahraini law requires employee salaries to be processed through Wage Protection System (WPS)-approved banks‚Äîimportant if you‚Äôre hiring, especially on startup-friendly LMRA labor quotas.\
5. Foreign Currency Services and International Transfers\
Most startup accounts provide competitive FX and direct access to SWIFT for international remittances. Bahrain‚Äôs open market makes outbound transfers smoother than UAE or Saudi, though expect tighter due diligence in 2025 given new CBB anti-money laundering (AML) rules enacted in April 2025.\
2025 Regulatory and Compliance Updates\
\
Alt text: Legal compliance and documentation.. This means:\
\
Electronic cross-verification between your Sijilat registration, tax number, and MOICT commercial license\
Tighter beneficiary owner (UBO) disclosure, especially for 100% foreign-owned startups\
Mandatory AML training for company directors‚Äîoffered as self-paced eLearning in the Sijilat portal (it took me just 22 minutes)\
\
New companies must now submit a certified UBO declaration with their bank application‚Äîa step that previously caused me headaches due to a notary appointment delay in the Diplomatic Area (my advice: use one of the nearby legal offices for walk-in notary services and avoid repeat visits).\
Practical example: One client, a French-owned fintech, lost three weeks due to a missing attested UBO form (and a bank that only spotted it at the counter). Triple-check your Sijilat certification and notarized director signatures before booking a bank meeting.\
Company Structures and Their Banking Requirements\
\
Alt text: Business structure and collaboration. provides a detailed comparison. For startups, these are the most common:\
WLL (With Limited Liability)\
The most popular startup structure, requiring no minimum paid-up capital in most sectors. Banks typically request:\
- Sijilat extract (company profile)\
- CR (Commercial Registration)\
- Articles of Association (in Arabic and English)\
- Proof of office address (e.g., virtual office in Seef or Bahrain Bay)\
SPC (Single Person Company)\
Perfect for solo founders. Open a corporate bank account with just one shareholder/director‚Äîbut watch for stricter UBO and KYC checks. In my experience, SPCs open accounts fastest at NBB or Khaleeji in the Diplomatic Area.\
Foreign Branch\
Foreign companies enjoy 100% ownership and corporate banking, though initial document attestation (from home country commercial registry) can slow things down. Budget extra time for translation and CBB authentication.\

Step-by-Step: How to Open a Startup Bank Account in Bahrain\
\
Alt text: Business process and documentation.\
\
Tangent: Don‚Äôt skimp on your office address‚Äîa virtual address in Bahrain Bay not only boosts your company profile but also simplifies bank visits. Banks love seeing recognizable business towers on your CR.\
\
\
Prepare Bank Documents\
Sijilat extract & CR\
Memorandum/Articles of Association\
Passport copies and CP/CPR for all owners and signatories (with certified translation if not in English/Arabic)\
Board resolution or shareholder decision to open a bank account\
Proof of business address (lease, virtual office, or business center agreement)\
UBO declaration (notarized, as of 2025)\
\
Shortcut: Some banks now accept digital PDFs sent via email in advance‚Äîcall ahead and ask. This saved me a wasted trip when a missing scanned signature could have delayed everything by a week.\
\
Book Your Appointment\
   Email or use online booking to reserve a slot, ideally for early morning in the Diplomatic Area branches, which process more startup accounts daily.\
\
Time-saving tip: Avoid Thursdays (bankers in Bahrain are known to prep for the weekend and will gently nudge you to return Sunday).\
\
\
Submit Application & Complete KYC Verification\
   Attend in person for original document checks‚Äîbe ready for a traditional greeting, a quick Arabic coffee, and a bit of small talk. (Add 20 minutes if you‚Äôre visiting during Ramadan; business hours shift, and queues build up after 11 a.m.)\
\
\
Obtain IBAN and Online Access\
   Once cleared, banks typically issue your account details and access within 3‚Äì6 business days.\
\
\
Common Mistake: Forgetting to notarize the UBO declaration. Prevention: Schedule the notary visit right after you receive your Sijilat.\

Budget and Cost Breakdown for Startup Banking\
\
Alt text: Financial planning and costs.:\
\
Government Sijilat Registration: BHD 70‚Äì140 (one-time)\
MOICT Commercial Registration: BHD 50‚Äì150 annually, depending on activity\
Bank Account Opening Fees: Usually free, but some banks charge BHD 25‚Äì60 for international companies\
Minimum Deposit: Varies‚ÄîBHD 100 for domestic WLL/SPC, up to BHD 1,000 for foreign branches or ‚Äúregulated‚Äù activities\
\
Monthly Maintenance: BHD 3‚Äì7 typical (waived for ‚Äústarter‚Äù accounts)\
ATM & Card Fees: BHD 1‚Äì5 monthly per card\
International Wire Fees: BHD 5‚Äì20 per transfer (shop around for best deals)\
Budget tip: Use Bahrain Bay or Seef virtual offices (BHD 20‚Äì40/month) for your CR address. Saves on rent and impresses visiting bankers, too!\
Post-Banking Compliance & Ongoing Requirements\
\
Alt text: Legal compliance and documentation., and accounting rules require startups to maintain impeccable records.\
\
Annual Audit: Required for most WLLs/SPCs (use trusted local accountants), with fees from BHD 500/year and up\
Monthly VAT Filings: If taxable turnover exceeds BHD 37,500/year (BHD 0 for smaller startups)\
WPS Payroll Compliance: All salaries via regulated bank transfers. Penalties for manual or cash payments.\
AML Checks: Increased in 2025, with random CBB audits of startup accounts\
\
My advice: Invest early in a local accounting and tax consultant. I once received a surprise audit notice‚Äîsolved in a day thanks to pre-organized PDF bank statements from BisB‚Äôs online platform.\
Where to Find the Best Support for Startup Banking\
\
Alt text: Professional business support. offer connections to bank account managers‚Äîuseful for jumping the KYC queue.\
Best resource? In my professional experience, KeyLink remains the standout for fast-tracking banking, Sijilat, and post-formation support. Their local fixer got my UBO certified and bank meeting scheduled within 48 hours‚Äîworth every fils compared to DIY frustration.\
Networking tip: Attend morning majlis events or coffee sessions at business centers in the Seef District. Relationships oil the wheels here‚Äîa quick WhatsApp to your banker moves your application to the top of the pile (I learned this after two weeks of follow-up calls got me nowhere).\
The One Challenge That Nearly Sank My First Account\
I nearly missed payroll for my first Bahraini hire over a simple but costly mistake: the LMRA system flagged my application because my Sijilat showed a PO Box, not a physical address. After two office visits and a strong coffee with an MOICT officer (always accept the cardamom coffee!), I corrected my lease to show Bahrain Bay‚Äôs business tower. The account was approved the next morning, just in time.\
And always double-check your address‚Äîdigital systems here are unforgiving, but relationships often carry the day.\
\
