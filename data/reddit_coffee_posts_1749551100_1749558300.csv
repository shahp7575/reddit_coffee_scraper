1l7xbjy,https://www.reddit.com/r/roasting/comments/1l7xbjy/the_developed_light_roast/,The Developed Light Roast,"Background: OK, I am a professional coffee roaster and have been for about two years. I work for a small local coffee shop that has been in business for around 10 years. We purchase high-quality green beans and use a Diedrich 25kg capacity roaster. I also use artisan software for data tracking. 

I consider my roasting philosophy to be third wave, as in I appreciate the subtle complexities found in lighter roasts (ie. floral, fruity accents).  I roast dark as well because we offer a variety for customers of course. I basically use Scott Rao’s method of a steady declining RoR = good tasting cup. 

However I am finding that when I roast light (drop the beans right into FC), that I am missing some complexities. It feels like it hits and then drops off instantly in flavor (if that makes sense). If I go further, I start to lose those light attributes though, and it gets too roasty IMO. 

Thoughts on how to keep it light whilst also developing  even more flavor? 

Sidenote: I have found also that plateauing in the middle of the roast doesn’t give me what I’m looking for, and tends to taste baked in the cup. 

Thanks in advance! Happy roasting everyone. ",1,1749558111.0,roasting,0,1.0,False

Long story ensues that I hope Reasonates and can help..,"I think I remember when it started. I’d had a late-ish meeting and left my home office (god this feels like first world problems with that leading statement) to go to my lounge room and I walked into the room crying, but as I remember it, I was viewing myself walking into the room crying. I was devastated. I thought a somewhat demotion meant I was a shit human, mother, partner, employee…essentially a drain on humanity. Since then in 2022. I’ve been different. About 16 months later, I thought my job and manager was the problem. I went into a secondment with a higher position. More pressure, no staff, brand new manager (in a position I applied for out of desperation). I was so lucky. I failed. Not only that, I failed on what feels a grand scale (in my mind).  I couldn’t seem to process what my manager was saying to me, I thought I was going crazy, to the point I got an MRI at the start of the secondment.

Flash to 3 months later and I feel like every day I’m waking up with a new set of issues. Not sleeping, chronic over thinking, given a literally impossible task in my new role. A 4 yo girl starting kindergarten. Fighting w partner over parenting technique. I broke. I tried limply to stand up for myself with my manager who in one meeting started a one note shared note with documented complaints about me. I confronted him thinking I was being performance managed. I broke again, in front of him, HR and a support person. I would walk down 10 flights of stairs so no one would see me crying…

If been seeing doctors for 3-5years. Saying how tired i was (many tests ensued, including that I might have PMDD, the closest diagnosis I’d receive) and in one instance, sent a nasty email to my sister (who I don’t talk to anymore, and I maintain what I said was justified from my view).  My mask has dropped.

I can’t hold it in anymore. Before the issue with HR, my nights with my you g daughter (4), devolved in to yelling and an uncontrollable rage. My mental health is spiralling. I never laid a hand on her, which I am grateful for, but my concern lingers that the damage is done..

A week later, I am out of the shower and crying on the couch. I am high strung and sad. I am so sad. I’ve failed as a mother. My daughter is the best thing I’ve done in my life. I call lifeline and then admit I’m not ok and take myself to ED, a 40 min drive away. My daughter wouldn’t get in the car with her dad so I took her. With the iPad and headphones, in a backseat child’s chair. My fingers were gripping the steering wheel so tight and I kept on repeating hope: hold on, pain ends - something I learned from a counsellor after trying to get end my life in 2017:18. After around 600 hours of leave (I am so so so lucky my work has paid, unlimited sick leave), I’m semi functional, but no where near my prior self. My work has been incredibly gentle with me. Even my bosses, bosses boss took me for a coffee and said it wasn’t me, it was my last manager - incredibly validating but i still not like who I was. I find myself stimming. Having irrational outbursts. Pms is like something I’ve never experienced. Last week, I had two horrendous days and I’m not even in the office… my stress tolerance is in the minus. To the point, I was at work and laughing heaps, I had this weird numbness in the back of my neck (which I think has happened before but I don’t know when). It’s like my neck muscles farigued, TMS? 

If you’ve made it this far, thank you. 

I am hoping someone else in this space might have had some or any experience with this? 

My grandfather was an alcoholic, my mum drank a lot. My dad, I am convinced is autistic (ex-engineer, energy). I am trying to find patterns and a solution and it is driving me crazy. I will try anything that might have worked for you! I’m hoping to get back into therapy after I try and get my money issues sorted..

My mum had to quit work at some time in my teens and quit work. But she was dealing with her own trauma, was not interested in parenting, eventually divorced my dad (my sister informed me and I was bewildered that they didn’t do it sooner! But that also resulted in my mums creepy boyfriend, so not great..)",1,1749558094.0,Perimenopause,0,1.0,False

I’ve lived both sides of this soul - sucking saga:  
**As a job seeker?** Spent *weeks* bleeding into resumes, only to get radio silence after those “We’re thrilled about your application!” emails. You pour your soul into bullet points, and it feels like tossing a love letter into a black hole.  
**As a recruiter?** Drowned in 500+ CVs that all blur together—like reading the same grocery list, but for “synergy” and “thought leadership.” Trying to spot “culture fit” in a PDF? Might as well guess a stranger’s personality from their Netflix history.  
So I built **SwipeHire**—not because I’m some genius, but because I was *tired of watching good people get lost in the noise*. Let’s break down why this might actually fix things (and why I’m spilling this here, where the internet tells it like it is).

# The Problem: Hiring Is a Robot - Run Dating App (And Nobody Signed Up For That)

Resumes don’t tell stories—they’re just keyword - stuffed resumes in disguise. Recruiters skim, candidates ghost, and “culture fit” becomes a buzzword for “people who talk like me.” It’s dehumanizing. We deserve better.

# The SwipeHire Fix: Let’s Bring Back the “Human” in “Human Resources”

Forget lifeless bullet points—**we’re putting people back at the center**:

* **For job seekers**: Ditch the resume. Record a 30 - second video instead. Show your *vibe*—the quirks, the passion, the “why you do what you do.” No more hiding behind jargon; let your personality *breathe*.
* **For recruiters**: Swipe through video profiles like you’re scrolling for coffee dates (but, you know, for jobs). See how someone *communicates*, how they think on their feet, whether they’d actually vibe with your team—**before** you dig into their work history.

And the AI? It’s not here to judge—it’s here to *help*:

* Job seekers get AI script tips (e.g., “Add that story about the time you fixed a crisis—recruiters eat that up”).
* Recruiters get match scores that factor in *culture fit* and skills—no more keyword bingo.

Oh, and ghosting? We’re nuking that. If you get rejected, the AI sends personalized feedback (e.g., “Your video was fire, but highlight X skill for these roles”). No more guessing why you got the silent treatment.

# Why I’m Sharing This on Reddit (Not LinkedIn, Where People Pretend to Be Perfect)

This isn’t a shiny “product launch.” This is me, a regular person, saying: *“I built something messy, and I need your help to fix it.”*  
Reddit’s the only place I trust for raw, unfiltered truth. So:

* **Want to beta test?** DM me. We’re small, we’re scrappy, and we’ll hook you up.
* **Got feedback?** Spill it. I’ve already messed up plenty (like when people hated recording videos, so we added AI avatars for shy folks… or when “too many filters” made the app feel like a spreadsheet).

Let’s be real about the numbers, too:

* Beta user spreaded over 5 continents (job seekers + recruiters)
* $0 revenue (we’re pre - revenue, testing pricing—no “gotcha” paywalls here)

# Let’s Talk—No Corporate BS Allowed

What’s your hiring horror story? The time a recruiter asked “What’s your biggest weakness?” and then ghosted? The resume you spent 10 hours on that got auto - rejected? Drop it below—I’ll use it to make SwipeHire *less* terrible.

Think video resumes are cringe? Let’s debate. Maybe I’ll change your mind… or maybe you’ll change mine. Either way, let’s *actually talk* about how to fix this broken system.  
And if you want to try SwipeHire? Comment “Fix hiring” or DM me. Let’s rebuild this thing together—because hiring shouldn’t feel like a dystopian chore.  
P.S. If this flops, at least I tried to yank hiring out of the corporate void. Onward—even if it’s messy.

I'm tall, fit, I have a beard, I'm on my last year of studies, I have a nice job, I'm funny, I'm outgoing, I play sports, I do interesting stuff, I read, etc. I am however also bald so I see how that may be a hindrance.

If I meet a girl in a group setting, I can turn on the charm and I can land a date, but only if she's with me long enough to see my personality. When I'm out in a club, a bar, a coffee shop, anything like that, I can't even get a number. Whenever I do get a date, it doesn't work out because we live 200 miles apart or something like that.

I feel like I'm confident, however it is a bit of a hit to my ego when I'm out with my two friends and they get approached by girls pretty much every time. I wouldn't say I'm jealous, I love those guys, I'm happy for them. However, why not me, lol. I don't look particularly worse than either of them. I don't know if I'm missing some sort of natural charisma or whatever when I have my mouth closed.

I'm a horrible texter, but I'm really in my element in an environment where I get to talk. I rely a lot on my humor which only works through my tone and gestures. I'm great at telling stories, I'm great at getting along with anybody, making conversation around a table and just being the life of the party. 

I might sound like an arrogant asshole when I say I'm a total catch, but I don't care because I know it's true. I admit I am picky. However, I still don't get why it won't work out for me. I might be too burdened by it, but I truly feel like that's the only thing I'm missing in my life and it's something I'm truly craving and can't shake off. My friends like to tell me that ""it'll happen when you least expect it"" and I just hate hearing that because it isn't comforting at all. It most often comes from those that have been in relationships since they were 15.

I feel like the biggest reason for my frustration is the peer pressure. I'm at an age where a big chunk of my friends are moving in together, getting engaged, getting married. We were hanging out last weekend and one couple talked about the renovations in the apartment they're about to move into, another talked about a trip they took, a third one talked about their anniversary and what they're going to do. Meanwhile I'm here, stagnant and falling behind.

While I'm not lonely because I do have close friends and all that, I feel lonely because I don't have anyone I can share my struggles with without feeling embarrassed or anyone who can hug and comfort me when it's rough.

I truly don't understand what the issue is. To be clear, I do not blame women for my failures. They owe me nothing.

Feel free to ask any questions if you want me to elaborate on something more and then give to me like it is. Give me some advice to, if nothing else, help me make peace with the fact that nothing's going on.",1,1749557994.0,dating_advice,1,1.0,False

[Original Post](https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/8zw3r6/my_22f_childhood_boyfriend_22m_contacted_me_again/) **July 18, 2018**

All through elementary school I had a mutual crush on the same boy “Tad”. We were “boyfriend and girlfriend” and went to school dances together, partnered up for activities, etc. Tad eventually moved before middle school and we lost touch.

A few weeks ago, I got a Facebook friend request and it was Tad. He later sent me a message saying hello, and that he’d been looking through some old yearbooks and thought of me. We chatted in a friendly, catching up way for a while, and agreed to meet up for coffee. We did, had a nice conversation, and he seemed normal enough. I really didn’t get any weird vibes during these interactions. It just seemed like catching up with a childhood friend, talking about old classmates, etc.

However, after coffee Tad texted me and said, “I gotta ask you something. Do you think we could be a cute couple now like we were as kids”. I responded that I had just gotten out of a relationship and wasn’t looking for anything right now. I told him that in any case, we’d need to get to know each other again as adults, since our prior “relationship” was a childish crush/friendship. He seemed a little offended by this and said his feelings had never changed, and he had looked for me for years.

I know I’m not ready to jump right into a relationship, but I’m wondering if it’s even worth getting to know this guy again/giving him a chance or if I should just cut contact. The friends I’ve told think it’s a bit creepy, and that’s my intuition, as well. He seems think we had an actual dating relationship as children and be confused as to why I don’t immediately want to date him. Any thoughts on how to handle this?

TL;DR: Guy I “dated” in elementary school contacted me again and wants a relationship. He seemed confused when I told him we’d have to get to know each other as adults and said he searched for me for years. Creepy, or should I give him a chance and try to at least get to know him again?

**enrichmentonly**

>You kinda had a first date with him. Was there chemistry? Were you attracted to him? Did you have common interests?

>The most positive things you say about him in your post is that he seemed ""normal enough"" and that you ""didn't get weird vibes"". That's not like a huge endorsement.

>It doesn't sound like this is somebody you WANT to date.

**Meloetta**

>>I agree. It sounded like there was no spark when they met up, no connection beyond ""distant friend"". While no one should expect to be in love with their SO immediately, they should expect some kind of ""I'd really like to see him again"", even if it's just as a friend.

>>Someone else has mentioned the societal push to downplay intuition, and I'd like to add to that the societal push to ""give every guy a chance"". Not every guy is for you, even if they're perfectly nice. There's a special kind of connection that needs to be felt by both parties to be successful, not just ""he's nice enough"".

1l7x8uj,https://www.reddit.com/r/confessions/comments/1l7x8uj/the_hall_pass_dilema/,"The ""Hall Pass"" dilema","Seeking advice.
So, I'm 50 (m) and been with my partner (44, f) for about 5 years. Over the past 2 to 3 years there's been a noticeable decline in her sex-drive (due to side effects of medications - antidepressants, etc - as well as her self confidence and health limitations (weight etc). I have tried speaking with her about it a number of times, and tried to offer moral support, asking if she would attend counselling with me, and seek a best way forward.
Since the decline started, she has offered me a ""hall pass"", for me to ""scratch my itch with someone else"" whenever I need to. To date, I haven't taken the offer of a Hall pass, despite it being over 6 months since we were last intimate, and 7 months since the last time before that, and again roughly 6 months the time before. During one conversation where she offered the Hall pass, I said that if she really wanted me to use the Pass, that maybe she should find the other person (so it's setup by her, rather than me seeking someone).
For the past few years I've had a single (F) friend slightly older than myself, and so far we've been in a platonic friendship, nothing more than a hug and peck on the cheek, the same as my partnerssister has done many times. My partner has not yet met my friend, but my partner has occasionally suggested that I ""hang out"" with my friend, and says she has no objections to me having this friend.
Over the past year, there have been a couple of occasions where I'm unsure if my friend was just being friendly, or whether they were testing the waters or subversively flirting with me.
On one occasion, she asked me over to help with some minor handyman type tasks, we agreed on a time for me to arrive. When I arrived, I knocked on the door, and she answered about 2 minutes later, wearing (apparently) only a towel, as she was ""just in the shower"". She quickly showed me around her place, then went to get dressed (but left the bedroom door ajar - I didn't pursue or see anything). She returned fully dressed and showed me some of her artwork hanging in her home, as well as showing some of her framed ""glamour"" style photos of her in lingerie (no nudity, nothing revealing) from about 5 or 10 years ago. I helped out with the handyman tasks she asked for, and returned home.
On another occasion, I was helping her move furniture, she asked me to be there ""for coffee and a chat"" 15 minutes prior to her other friends arriving to help. I arrived at the agreed time, we had coffee and started talking, but her friends arrived early. Some of the furniture she asked me to move, were drawers from her dressing table, with her clean bras and underwear sitting folded neatly on top of the pile in the drawer. I said and did nothing regarding this occasion, and when the furniture was finished being moved, I returned home.
Then today she was discussing with me about what costumes we were planning on wearing to an upcoming fancy-dress event we're attending (she's coming with her teenage son, who I know, and I'm bringing my partner, and it's the first time my partner will meet my friend, whom she's heard about for a while).
During discussion with my friend about her costume, she very openly stated that she still doesn't know what underwear she'll wear under the costume, and started talking about how she might wear one of her older bras (from when her bust was less full), to ""make them sit up more"", or maybe buying a new bra, for the same effect. She mentioned her wanting to accentuate her bust, a couple of times in a short period of time. I jokingly said that owing to the time period of the fancy dress, that underwear was probably optional, but that if she did wear something to accentuate her bust (which I'm only guessing, is perfectly fine, she's just concerned about the effect of gravity and age), it would certainly get guys attention.

I feel like she (my friend) might be dropping hints or testing my response, but I'm also not sure if she's just open with what she talks about, and is comfortable talking with me and being in my company.
I feel that my partner is openly encouraging me to have this friendship, as it gives her some quiet time and gives me opportunity to have a friend (who isn't a member of extended family, or a workmate).

Do I talk to my friend, and let her know about the Hall pass situation? What are the chances that my partner will tell her, or suggest it?

You can always tell when she is spinning and not totally honest when she does these things .  Mouth dropping .. almost ready to cry . 

Her full on return to Preacher Ashley which likely got her in the mess she is running from to begin with … is back … with the cross necklace not seen in Europe but back to the God world salad.  Huh . 

We know way too much about the Petrones now  ,  it may actually be good for the MOD to pin the known information at the top of this snark for reference !  We seem to add people daily so this that could serve as a way to catch up !!! 🍿

My thought on this whole thing is that they were shamed in some way and are running . I think she also is bored by her life , never happy in the slow and steady , and needed a new project . 

They came into money one way or another. Which pushed this all along . I do not think they are normally flush with money . Aside from her clothing purchases and cheap hotel trips they seem cash poor . They even seemed cash poor and cheap in Europe aside from Ashley’s purchases . 

What has become clear to me is she really is a B to atleast her kids .. so likely others . Her comment to G2 about bikes being destroyed , Q to untangled the Merc aprons and then how bitchy she sounded when G1 asked if they were tipping Friday . 

I can snark , laugh around , but she is showing her true colors and obviously treats her kids like servants to her.  

I am very curious on the church thing .  I can see without help from family how they got the TN “ land” . And soon all that will be public records . 

I think they will be miserable in TN .. the LBK house and Merc will not sell and they will be hit by more storms.  

She will be painting crap in TN black by this time next month .. “finding Joy in the in between “ of waiting for construction to begin.., which likely never will if Merc and or LBK house doesn’t sell for a big profit .  

They will do family walks around their 11 acres and come back covered in ticks and mosquito bites . They will stare at a big green pool ., unless they saved money to fix that first . 

They will leave kids and go to Franklin and Nashville for the night .. and fly to Miami on the regular . 

You won’t see an animal on their “ farm“ any time soon . 

She will have Loriann there painting and stenciling like a crazy lady . 

We have seen this all before . 

Pack up your Uhaul Ashley with all your personal crap and the kids one box each . 

Drag their butts to small town TN .. and tell us how great it is .  

Hopefully you are bringing your big family living table for all your organic meals , family time and making granola . 

Bye bye dream of kids living at the beach , hanging out with friends at Merc after “school” , riding a bikes for coffee . Walking down the street for a drink .  Prancing on the beach in bikinis .. BYE BYE

See ya pretty great life .. we are running for the hills !!!

Reddit’s the only place I trust for raw, unfiltered truth. So:  


* **Want to beta test?** DM me. We’re small, we’re scrappy, and we’ll hook you up.
* **Got feedback?** Spill it. I’ve already messed up plenty (like when people hated recording videos, so we added AI avatars for shy folks… or when “too many filters” made the app feel like a spreadsheet).

Let’s be real about the numbers, too:  


* Beta user spreaded over 5 continents (job seekers + recruiters)
* $0 revenue (we’re pre - revenue, testing pricing—no “gotcha” paywalls here)

# Let’s Talk—No Corporate BS Allowed

What’s your hiring horror story? The time a recruiter asked “What’s your biggest weakness?” and then ghosted? The resume you spent 10 hours on that got auto - rejected? Drop it below—I’ll use it to make SwipeHire *less* terrible.

  
Think video resumes are cringe? Let’s debate. Maybe I’ll change your mind… or maybe you’ll change mine. Either way, let’s *actually talk* about how to fix this broken system.  
And if you want to try SwipeHire? Comment “Fix hiring” or DM me. Let’s rebuild this thing together—because hiring shouldn’t feel like a dystopian chore.  
P.S. If this flops, at least I tried to yank hiring out of the corporate void. Onward—even if it’s messy.

1l7x6rj,https://www.reddit.com/r/tifu/comments/1l7x6rj/tifu_by_turning_a_routine_extraction_into_a_full/,TIFU by turning a routine extraction into a full on dental disaster,"So, I’m a dentist, and I’ve been yanking teeth for over a decade, but yesterday, I turned a simple third molar extraction into a scene straight out of a horror flick. Buckle up, because I’m still spiraling, and I need to get this off my chest before I lose it in the op next week. It started innocently enough. Patient comes in, mid-20s, nervous but chill, here for a lower left 8 that’s been giving them grief. Radiograph shows it’s mesioangular, partially impacted, nothing I haven’t seen a million times. I’m thinking, “Easy peasy, in and out in 20 minutes, maybe I’ll even grab a coffee after.” Spoiler: I did not get that coffee.

I numb them up with a good ol’ IANB, throw in some buccal infiltration for kicks, and we’re vibing. Patient’s got their noise canceling headphones on, blasting some lo-fi beats, and I’m in the zone, elevator in hand, ready to luxate this bad boy. The tooth’s cooperative at first slight mobility, no drama. Then, I swear on my loupes, this molar decides it’s auditioning for The Exorcist.

I’m working the periosteal elevator, trying to get some purchase, when the damn thing fractures. Not just a little crack oh no, this tooth explodes into what I can only describe as coronal confetti. I’m staring at a pulpal mess, and the patient’s still bobbing their head to their playlist, oblivious. I’m like, “Okay, stay calm, just section it and move on.” So, I grab the high-speed, diamond bur spinning like my anxiety, and start troughing around the roots. That’s when I realize the distal root is practically shaking hands with the inferior alveolar nerve. Great. Just great. I’m sweating through my nitrile gloves at this point, and my assistant (bless her), she’s new and hands me a rongeur like it’s a peace offering. I’m trying to finesse the fragments out, but the buccal plate decides it’s done with life and just… crumbles. Now I’ve got a bone window that looks like I took a jackhammer to it, and I’m pretty sure I’m one wrong move from a paresthesia lawsuit. The patient’s still chilling, thank God for articaine, but I’m mentally writing my resignation letter.

Here’s where it gets unhinged. I’m fishing for the last root tip, and my suction slips because of course it does, and I accidentally yeet a chunk of amalgam from an adjacent 7 into the patient’s throat. They gag, I panic, and my assistant screams, “IS THAT A TOOTH?!” No, Karen, it’s not a tooth, it’s a rogue filling, and now I’m wondering if I need to call ENT or just pray they cough it up later. I’m yelling, “Spit! Spit!” like a deranged cheerleader, and they finally hawk it into the spittoon. Crisis averted. Kinda. By some miracle, I get the root out, patch up the socket with some collagen sponge, and throw in a couple of resorbable sutures. The patient’s none the wiser, thinks it went “fine,” and I’m standing there with a fake smile, my scrubs soaked like I ran a marathon. I send them off with post-op instructions and a Vicodin script, praying they don’t notice their jaw feels like a construction site.

Now I’m home, sipping whiskey out of a coffee mug, wondering if I should’ve gone to optometry school instead. My assistant keeps texting me memes about “dentist life,” and I’m questioning every life choice that led me to this moment. Did I mention the patient left a 5-star Yelp review? Said I was “super chill.” I’m not chill. I’m a walking OSHA violation.

And to top it all off, this morning I get a text from the patient asking if it’s normal to find a tiny piece of “shiny stuff” in their cereal. I’m 99% sure it’s just their granola, but now I’m paranoid it’s another chunk of amalgam staging a jailbreak. Send me to dental purgatory, I’m ready.

TL;DR: F’d up a routine wisdom tooth extraction, turned it into a buccal bone massacre, yeeted an amalgam into the patient’s throat, and somehow got away with it. Send help (or whiskey).",6,1749557725.0,tifu,2,0.75,False

1l7wzs6,https://www.reddit.com/r/MedicalCannabis_NI/comments/1l7wzs6/follow_your_nose_terpenes_and_wellness/,Follow Your Nose – Terpenes and Wellness,"Unlocking the wellness benefits of terpenes through aromatherapy.

  
As research advances and the Cannabis market matures, more brands are ditching broad decades-old classification terms like “indica vs. sativa.” Instead, today’s packaging comes with two more important words: dominant terpenes. 

While more seasoned smokers may understand these scientific terms and their meaning, talking terpenes isn’t always an easy language to become fluent in. This type of higher education takes expert help and can quickly overwhelm rookie rollers or the newly canna-curious. 

To get advice on how consumers can conquer these complexities, we linked up with Jamila Owens-Todd – a Naturopathic Doctor, Adjunct Professor of Cannabis Pharmacology, and Chief Science Officer of a medical Cannabis manufacturer. The answer involves using aromatherapy to experience the wellness benefits of terpenes, and you only need one tool: your nose. 

Aromatherapy is the practice of using chemical compounds called aromatics for therapeutic benefit. This link between scent and mood explains why a fresh pot of coffee brewing can wake you up in the morning or how the soothing smell of lavender before bed makes you sleepy. In the Cannabis plant, terpenes are one of the elements that impact not only a strain’s fragrance and flavor, but also the way it makes you feel. 

“Terpenes are essential oils. They’re aromatic, volatile molecules, and the way we receive many of their benefits is through inhalation,” explains Jamila. “So I would just start there and let the nose lead you. The fact that you’re able to inhale, ignite those nasal passageways, and get the nervous system engaged simply from smelling the flower is really all you need. If you have five different types of strains in front of you, smell each one. The one that resonates with you the most, *that* is your flower.” 

Naturopathic Doctor and Cannabis Pharmacologist Jamila Owens-Todd.

But what if you live in a state or shop at a dispensary that doesn’t allow you to smell the product before purchasing it? Jamila went on to explain how you can take the power of scent a step further to elevate your smoking experience once you’ve taken your haul home. By understanding the connection between scent and terpenes, you can actually guide your Cannabis consumption throughout the day based on mood, environment and desired effects. 

Let’s say you wake up with a long list of tasks looming over your head. You may want to start the day with a strain that immediately makes you feel uplifted and euphoric after taking a big whiff – this likely tingles the nostrils and is high in limonene. After powering through a few productive hours of work, you take another smoke break, this time with a cultivar high in pinene such as OG Kush. It smells fresh and crisp, and in turn helps you feel focused, cerebral and ready to crush the afternoon – much like a mental walk through the woods. After you finally look up from the laptop, the day has already turned to dusk and it’s time to unwind with a high-linalool strain like Lavender Diesel that is soothing, herbaceous and gentle on the exhale before hitting the hay.

Listening to our nose is a huge part of connecting your mind, body and spirit through Cannabis. This approach gives us a deeper relationship with the plant, allowing us to welcome all the wellness benefits it can provide. As Jamila put it, “Before you even start to spark up your flower, just take a good whiff. … Let the nose lead you … is the plant selecting you, or are you selecting the plant? If you allow yourself to be vulnerable in that way and just take that smell in, you’ve already engaged in terpene medicine. And then, once you ignite the flower, you get even more benefits of that aroma and those terpenes.”

1l7wzha,https://www.reddit.com/r/NVC/comments/1l7wzha/the_moment_of_fulfillment_is_not_when_you_think/,The Moment of Fulfillment Is Not When You Think,"There's a saying of Marshall Rosenberg, that gets right to the heart of our human experience: ""Everybody has to pee.""

On the surface, it’s a simple biological fact. But it’s also a perfect illustration of a supposed ""unfulfilled need.""

Consider this: You’re in a workshop, engrossed in the session. The coffee during the last break was yummy. A familiar pressure begins to build. You try to hold out for the next break, but the discomfort becomes an overwhelming distraction. You're caught between your body's urgent signal and your mind's fear of appearing ""impolite"".

Then, a shift happens. You decide. You gather a small measure of courage, catch the facilitator’s eye, and rise from your seat.

Here is the crucial question: In that entire sequence, when was your ""need"" truly met? Was it only after you returned from the restroom?

I believe it was much earlier, and that, in my experience at least, it has literally nothing to do with actually peeing or not peeing. Fulfillment didn't happen at the end of the journey; it happened at the beginning. It arrived in the precise moment I made the wholehearted, non-negotiable decision to honor what I truly wanted to do: get up and go pee.

**The peace came with the decision, not the action.**

This is my experience of life, at least. What we label as ""needs"" are, to me, actually **desires**, and they are not states of lack. They are currents of life, already complete, waiting for us to align with them. The struggle is never about the desire itself, but **about our resistance** to it.

In that sense, **our desires are already fulfilled** and merely await our recognition of it.

When we realize this, we see that nothing external can truly hold us back. Fulfillment is always available. It is the simple, gentle recognition that we are already connected to a flow of love and that our desires are how that love seeks to express itself in the world.

I’ve been testing these grain-free dog treats with my golden retriever, Max, and my coworker’s picky Chihuahua, Daisy, during our lunch breaks at the office for a few weeks now. My goal? See if these pocket-sized snacks live up to their reputation as a healthier, convenient option for training and rewarding pups without sacrificing quality or flavor. Spoiler alert: they’re pretty awesome…but there are things to consider.

**Packaging and Size**  
I noticed right away that this product doesn’t bother with any flashy gimmicks. The bag is simple, resealable, and easy to store, which I appreciated. At 8 ounces, it's the perfect size for dog owners who go through treats quickly or those who just need something to keep in their pockets for training sessions. The packaging dimensions (9.57 x 7.44 x 2.6 inches) feel compact, and the weight (a light 4.8 ounces) makes it portable. Keeping the pouch in my bag on a hike was no hassle.

**Winning Points**  
- Grain-free formula with real bacon and blueberries.  
- Convenient resealable bag for freshness.  
- Tiny, crunchy treats perfect for training.  

[Find the best price for Charlee Bear ZT3130 11 on Amazon.](https://petof.com/p/b00op9lg4g/)

**Ingredients and Health Benefits**  
The ingredient list impressed me for its minimalistic and clean approach. These treats omit wheat, corn, soy, and artificial preservatives, which makes my job as a pet parent easier—I don’t have to worry about common allergens or unhealthy additives sneaking in. The standout ingredients are the bacon and blueberries. Blueberries, as a special highlight, are a wonderful antioxidant source, and bacon…well, that’s like candy for dogs. Max instantly perked up the first time I offered him one of these treats, and he’s been hooked ever since. Daisy, the Chihuahua, is notoriously picky, but even she couldn't say no to a bacon-blueberry combo.

**Taste and Texture**  
Although I haven’t personally taken a bite (tempting, though), the dogs’ reactions say it all. The treats are small and crunchy but not hard enough to hurt Daisy’s little teeth. For Max, who happily chews through almost anything, the crunch adds a satisfying texture. My friend tried the treats on her senior dog, too, and even with some missing teeth, they were easy to break into halves.

**Less Favorable Aspects**  
- Limited to one flavor (bacon and blueberry).  
- Crunchy texture might be challenging for dogs with severe dental issues.  
- Not suitable for pet parents looking for soft or moist treats for very young pups.

**Pocket-Friendly Design**  
There’s a reason Charlee Bear advertises these as “Pocket Perfect.” I put this to the test on numerous occasions—purchasing coffee, jogging, and even balancing three grocery bags. No crumbly disasters or greasy spots plagued me, which is a huge win. I’ve used treats from other brands, and let’s just say my phone’s screen didn’t love lingering oily fingerprints. These stayed clean and compact, which I think makes them ideal for multi-tasking dog parents or trainers.

**Product Contenders**  
Compared to other dog treats in this category, like Zuke’s Mini Naturals or Blue Buffalo Bits, Charlee Bear manages to deliver on convenience and health ingredients while maintaining a competitive edge. Zuke’s, for instance, appeals to dog owners looking for softer treats, but they don’t match Charlee Bear’s almost non-existent calorie footprint, which matters for pups who can’t afford calorie-laden extras. Blue Buffalo’s blueberry options are delicious (according to Max), but they feel too sugary compared to Charlee Bear’s balance of sweet and savory.

**Affordable Quality**  
For a brand that prioritizes clean ingredients and excludes fillers, this product’s price is a pleasant surprise. Many premium options in the market amp up costs unnecessarily, but Charlee Bear strikes a sound balance between quality and affordability. Considering these treats last for multiple weeks in my household—even with daily training sessions—I'm confident they’re a smart financial pick.

I always struggled with editing apps for quick photobooth-style pics for my Insta stories, way too much work. So, I built my own fix!

Since I'm just starting with web dev, the frontend is plain HTML and JS, styled with Tailwind CSS (highly recommend for beginners way easier to learn than raw CSS and less annoying). The backend runs on FastAPI (Python), and for image filters, I used the python library pilgram. JS gave me some headaches, but after sleepless nights and way too much coffee, everything worked out the way I wanted.

So, I’ll tell you a story. We were talking with this guy that we have common interests with and I thought we could potentially work. We exchanged messages, I asked him several clarifying questions about kids and separation etc etc, he seemed interested and kept messaging me with good morning for several days, but no hint of asking to meet. So I straight up said - how long do you wait before asking someone out? He said he’d love to meet and would love to meet for coffee or lunch. I said, ok sure, Friday lunch? He said he can’t do Friday. Maybe we can talk on the phone. Didn’t offer an alternative date - strike 1. I said I hate talking on the phone to strangers. His response was lol. Strike 2. I said I might be free tomorrow night after work - he said he’s busy seeing his children and something about us needing to find point of connection. I went - woah, and suddenly felt like I’m doing all the heavy lifting here trying to make a meeting happen and yet he was the one consistently messaging me for days clearly with enough points of communication. I wrote a message about how I’m going to back off and this doesn’t feel right and it feels like I’m the one working hard to make this happen and really I’m just a simple creature from that old real world where I want to meet the person and not invest into fantasies or go into overthinking. He replied « Oh, crickey. I didn’t want to give this impression. » 
Yep, we are in Australia, but it’s my first crickey ever from a man. I thought about it for a bit and if I should sleep on it and not get upset about a storm in a teacup and then I thought again - I was rather heavily hinting at meeting to begin with. He rejected my times twice without offering an alternative. I basically found myself in my trigger space - starting to get to feel like I’m being rejected rather than chased and working for something that should happen organically and that a guy should pursue. So I let go and unmatched. I recognise that I got impatient with the whole hinge thing I just want to meet in person and not waste time on messages, but here again is that old chestnut - no, initiating dates as a girl doesn’t work, they think it’s too easy and don’t try hard enough or value you and put effort, and the whole thing is pointless. And the most ridiculous thing I think he was more interested in me that other way around, he wanted to keep talking and ask me things etc but I got bored. Why do I need to tell you about my day for several days in a row if it’s not going anywhere. Anyway, thank you for the lesson, man who I will never meet, and maybe there’s a lesson for some of you too. Some women genuinely just want to meet asap it have a plan in place.

Meetings are a good example. Most of us stand around chatting, and he’s left either craning his neck up or slightly rolling back to get a better angle. It’s subtle, but it changes the dynamic.

The coffee machine is another one. It’s on a high counter, with awkward buttons and a tiny screen. Technically usable, but clearly not designed for everyone.

And the accessible bathroom? There is one. On one of the three floors. Not the one we work on.

It’s these kinds of small things—things that don’t look like barriers on paper that got me thinking. What are some of the everyday annoyances or challenges wheelchair users deal with that rarely get talked about?

Honestly, I find it kind of ridiculous. We live in one of the most developed countries in the world, and stuff like this is still an issue. And I’m not even comparing it to less developed places—I was born in a country that’s still considered quite developed, and things there are way worse.

I've recently started enjoying coffee after years of not liking/drinking it, my daily coffee is either a cup out of a pad based machine or the office coffee machine, those are ok but i've really enjoyed coffee from proper coffee bars/shops way more.

  
I'd like to upgrade my experience at home now as well , and because i don't have the room for a full on espresso machine i started looking into pour over. 

During my research the last days i've become enchanted with the Chemex, the way it looks and supposedly rendering a less bitter coffee when done right (that's what i dislike about the pads/office machine, those taste bitter and burnt on their own). However i also read that it's tricky to get a good cup with the Chemex for a beginner.

  
What would you guys suggest to start out and would learning a v60 be just as tricky as learning a Chemex ?

I already have a (non goose neck) temperature controlled kettle and i'm aware i'd need the following :

\- Grinder (planning on getting the hario mini mill slim plus)

\- Scale

\- Brewer + filters

Diagnose it in under 90 seconds with this free tool! \[Check it out now.\](https://nomadincomedetector.gleam.ink/)\*



\#### The Digital Nomad Zeitgeist

Let’s cut through the noise. The digital nomad isn’t just a person with a MacBook on a beach. It’s a seismic shift—a rebellion against cubicle captivity. The myth? That this is a new phenomenon. The movement? Older than your favorite startup, but turbocharged by tech.



\#### Pre-Digital Wanderers: Nomadism Before Wi-Fi

Before fiber optics, there were footpaths. Ancient nomads roamed for survival, not Instagram likes. Think Silk Road merchants, wandering philosophers, and artists chasing inspiration across continents. The urge to move? Baked into our DNA.

\#### The Birth of Remote Work: 1970s–1990s

Flashback: rotary phones, fax machines, and the first whispers of “telecommuting.” Visionaries in the ‘70s dreamed of working from home, but the tech was clunky. By the ‘90s, laptops appeared—heavy, slow, but portable. The first laptop lugers blazed trails in coffee shops and airports.



\#### The Internet Arrives: 1990s Dot-Com Disruption

Dial-up screeches echoed through living rooms. Suddenly, the world was connected. Early digital pioneers—coders, writers, hustlers—realized they could work from anywhere with a signal. The first online freelancers emerged, untethered and unstoppable.

\#### Coining the Term “Digital Nomad”

Who coined it? The phrase “digital nomad” first surfaced in the late ‘90s, crystallized by the book “Digital Nomad” (1997) by Tsugio Makimoto and David Manners. They predicted a world where tech would free us from offices. Prophets, not just authors.



\#### The 2000s: Broadband and Borders Blur

Broadband killed the dial-up dinosaur. Suddenly, Wi-Fi cafés popped up in every city. Freelancers, designers, and coders realized they could work from anywhere—Bangkok, Berlin, Buenos Aires. The rise of location independence wasn’t just a trend. It was a tectonic shift.

\#### The Laptop Lifestyle Goes Mainstream

Social media poured gasoline on the fire. Instagram feeds filled with palm trees and laptops. The digital nomad “influencer” was born—part marketer, part mythmaker. Suddenly, everyone wanted in on the secret.



\#### Economic Upheaval: Recessions and Remote Work

The 2008 financial crisis shattered old job models. Companies slashed office space, embraced remote work. For some, it was necessity. For others, opportunity. The workforce scattered—geographically and ideologically.

\#### The Rise of Coworking Spaces

No more lonely freelancers in pajamas. Coworking spaces exploded—first in garages, then in every city worth its salt. These were more than offices. They were tribes. Collaboration, community, caffeine on tap.



\#### Visa Innovation: Countries Court the Nomad

Governments woke up. They wanted nomads—spending money, bringing skills. Enter the digital nomad visa. Estonia, Portugal, Barbados—suddenly, borders were less barrier, more invitation.



\#### Pandemic Acceleration: 2020 and Beyond

COVID-19 hit. Offices emptied. Suddenly, remote work wasn’t a perk—it was survival. Millions discovered they could work from anywhere. The digital nomad movement went from fringe to mainstream overnight.

\#### Tech Stack: Tools That Unleashed Mobility

Cloud computing. Slack. Zoom. Trello. The smartphone became the digital nomad’s lifeline. Work, collaborate, create—all from a hammock or a hostel.



\#### Global Hotspots: The Nomad’s Map

Bali. Chiang Mai. Lisbon. Medellín. These cities became magnets—cheap living, fast Wi-Fi, vibrant communities. Living anywhere became an economic strategy, not just an adventure.



\#### Challenges and Critiques

It’s not all sunsets and smoothies. Loneliness bites. Legal gray areas lurk. Locals sometimes resent the influx. And let’s be honest—there’s privilege baked in. Not everyone can pack up and go.

AI and automation are rewriting the rules. Will everyone become a nomad? Maybe not. But the boundaries between work and wanderlust are dissolving. The next frontier? Limitless.



\#### Conclusion: The Nomad’s New Normal

From ancient wanderers to Wi-Fi warriors, the urge to roam never died. Now, it’s supercharged. The digital nomad isn’t a trend. It’s the new normal. And the journey? Just getting started.

I know many of us here struggle with the same dilemma: we want to simplify our lives with a dumb phone, but we're practically forced to stay on smartphones or loose contact with friends, family and work, who all use WhatsApp.

I've been working on a solution - a bridge system that forwards your WhatsApp messages to your dumb phone as regular SMS, and lets you reply back through SMS.

The setup

* A small Linux server (Raspberry Pi, old laptop, or VPS) running the WhatsApp bridge
* An old Android phone as SMS gateway (stays plugged in, connected to WiFi and cellular)
* SMS flatrates for both your dumb phone and the gateway phone (3 euros each per month for me in Germany)
* Re-authenticate WhatsApp every 14 days (WhatsApp's limitation)

How it works:

* The server connects to your WhatsApp account and monitors incoming messages
* When someone messages you on WhatsApp, the server forwards it to the plugged in Android phone (gateway)
* This phone sends an SMS to your dumbphone: ""Sarah (#24): Hey, are we still meeting for coffee?""
* You reply: ""#24 Yes, see you at 3""
* The gateway reads your message and forwards your reply back through the server to Sarah on WhatsApp (minus the #24 obviously)
* To everyone else, it looks like you're actively using WhatsApp

Still early stages, but folks here with the same problems might find the concept interesting. Anyone else been thinking about solutions like this? Generally this should be adaptable to include Facebook messenger, instagram dms, or other services.

For the first time in this ENTIRE year back at college I was able to keep my eyes open when our course leader was explaining theory and stuff to us.

Usually I'm struggling to keep my eyesopen even sometimes micro napping and almost falling out of my chair. 


Today I skipped coffee again and I feel fantastic, though I do miss the feeling of a warm drink. My entire education fell apart around 16 as I was always tired and distracted, looking back I was always drinking energy drinks every day to try and quell it now I guess it was making it worse, which also lead to behavioural problems and constant isolation from my classmates

We got her at a few weeks old.

So the story with Bubbles is a friend of a friend's cat got out, and came back pregnant, and Bubbles was the only kitten. Judging by her personality, her dad was either a mountain lion, or a wood chipper, maybe a mix of both lol.

Anyway, Smokey *hates* Bubbles with every fiber of her being for some reason. She did the whole hiss and growl / swipe at her thing in the beginning, then kinda started to warm up to her, even pinning her down and grooming her on occasion to try and get her to sit still. It seemed like things might be ok in time once Bubbles learned some boundaries.

But then a couple weeks After we got her, Bubbles *wrecked* herself *bad* out of nowhere in a high speed crash with the coffee table zooming around the house. Like bleeding from her eye, face puffed up, scared shitless she was gonna die from brain bleeding kinda bad. She spent 24 hours in an emergency vet clinic, and came home with a cone, and instructions to keep her as still as possible for a week.

She physically attacks Bubbles every time she sees her, the day is constantly filled with yowling and hissing / growling, chasing Bubbles out of the room on sight, it's crazy how bad she goes after this cat. Bubbles doesn't help being young and antagonistic, either.

# 375 Cups? Best Coffee Maker Reviews & 2025 Buying Guide

coffee, the elixir of life for many, fuels our mornings and powers us through long days. But what if you needed to brew coffee not just for yourself or a small group, but for a crowd? Imagine catering an event, hosting a large meeting, or running a busy office. That's where the concept of a ""375-cup"" coffee maker comes in. While a single machine might not brew that exact quantity at once, it represents high-volume brewing solutions designed to meet considerable coffee demands.This guide explores the world of large-capacity coffee makers, helping you choose the best option for your needs and providing insights into the market trends of 2025.

## Key Features Analysis

When selecting a high-volume coffee maker, several crucial features should be considered. These features directly impact the efficiency, reliability, and overall quality of the brewing process.

**Brewing Capacity:** This is,of course,the most meaningful factor.

Brewing capacity dictates how much coffee the machine can produce in a single batch or over a given period. Instead of a single ""375-cup"" machine, you'll likely be looking at commercial-grade brewers capable of producing several gallons per hour or multiple smaller brewers working in tandem. Pay attention to the stated cup size used by the manufacturer, as this can vary. You want to consider total output per batch, total output per hour, and total refill time needed, to ensure it meets your requirement.

**Brewing Time:** The faster the brewing time, the quicker the coffee is ready.

Brewing time directly correlates to the efficiency of the coffee maker. A shorter brewing cycle allows for quicker turnaround and the ability to meet high demand during peak periods. Look for models with rapid heating elements and efficient brewing mechanisms that minimize waiting time. Consider models with bypass features that would allow for partial brewing.

**Material & Durability:** Sturdy construction ensures longevity.

Material and durability are essential for commercial-grade coffee makers. These machines are subjected to heavy use and need to withstand the rigors of daily operation. Stainless steel components are generally preferable due to their resistance to corrosion, staining, and impact. Look for reinforced constructions and well-designed mechanisms that can withstand the demands of high-volume brewing.

**Ease of Use & Cleaning:** Simple operation saves time and effort.

Ease of use and cleaning are critical for streamlining operations and maintaining hygiene. Intuitive controls, clear instructions, and easily accessible components simplify the brewing process and minimize the risk of errors.Removable parts and dishwasher-safe components make cleaning and maintenance more efficient. Many commercial brewers have automated cleaning features allowing for hands-off maintenance overnight.**Temperature Control:** Consistent temperatures ensure quality coffee.

Precise temperature control is crucial for extracting the optimal flavor from coffee grounds. Maintaining a consistent brewing temperature throughout the cycle ensures a balanced and flavorful cup of coffee. Look for models with advanced temperature regulation systems that prevent overheating or under-extraction.

**Water Filtration:** Clean water equals clean coffee.

An integrated water filtration system is highly desirable for improving the taste and quality of the brewed coffee. Filtration removes impurities, chlorine, and other contaminants that can negatively affect the flavor profile. Some models come with built-in filters, while others can be connected to external water filtration systems.

Key features of high-volume coffee makers include:

* Large brewing capacity
* Rapid brewing time
* Durable construction
* User-kind design
* Precise temperature control
* water filtration

Investing in a high-volume coffee maker offers a multitude of benefits,particularly for businesses and organizations with substantial coffee demands.The advantages extend beyond simply providing a large quantity of coffee.

**Time Savings:** Eliminates the need for frequent brewing cycles.Time savings are a significant advantage of using a high-volume coffee maker. Rather than brewing multiple small batches throughout the day, a single large batch can satisfy demand for an extended period. This frees up staff time and reduces the labor costs associated with continuous coffee readiness.

**Cost Efficiency:** Bulk brewing reduces waste and lowers supply costs.

Cost efficiency is another noteworthy benefit. Bulk brewing typically results in lower per-cup costs compared to single-serve options or individual brewing methods. Additionally, it minimizes coffee waste, as the brewed coffee can be stored and served as needed.

**Consistent Quality:** Ensures uniform taste and strength across batches.

Consistent quality is improved with a high-volume coffee maker’s precise mechanism. These machines maintain consistent brewing parameters, such as temperature and water-to-coffee ratio, which ensures a uniform taste and strength across all batches. This is particularly important for maintaining customer satisfaction and upholding brand standards.

**Convenience:** Provides readily available coffee for large groups.Convenience is a key factor for businesses and organizations with lots of demand. It makes it easy to provide fast and efficient service to employees, clients, or event attendees. The convenience factor enhances productivity and improves morale.

## FAQs Section

Choosing the right high-volume coffee maker can be daunting. Here are some frequently asked questions to help guide your decision-making process.

**What is the ideal brewing capacity for my needs?**

determining the ideal brewing capacity depends on several factors, including the number of people you need to serve, the frequency of consumption, and the duration of peak demand periods. Estimate the average number of cups consumed per hour or per day, and then choose a coffee maker that can comfortably meet or exceed that demand. It's always better to err on the side of higher capacity to avoid running out of coffee.**how do I maintain and clean a high-volume coffee maker?**

Proper maintenance and cleaning are essential for prolonging the lifespan of your coffee maker and preserving the taste of the coffee. Follow the manufacturer's instructions for descaling and cleaning, typically involving a solution of water and vinegar or a commercial descaling agent. Regularly clean the brewing chamber,filter basket,and serving carafe to remove coffee residue and mineral buildup. Many newer models have built-in cleaning features to simplify this task.

**Can I use pre-ground coffee or do I need to grind my own beans?**

Both pre-ground coffee and freshly ground beans can be used in high-volume coffee makers, but freshly ground beans generally deliver a superior flavor. Grinding your own beans allows for greater control over the grind size, which can affect the extraction and taste of the coffee.Though, pre-ground coffee offers convenience and consistency, especially for large-scale operations. Ensure that the grind size is appropriate for the type of brewing method used by your coffee maker.

**What type of filtration system should I look for?**
The type of filtration system you choose depends on the quality of your water supply and your personal preferences. Activated carbon filters are effective at removing chlorine, odors, and other impurities that can affect the taste of the coffee. Sediment filters remove particulate matter and sediment,while water softening filters reduce mineral buildup and scale formation. Consider a model with a multi-stage filtration system for optimal water quality.

## ‍Key Features Analysis

The best black ‌leather men's backpacks are distinguished by a range of key⁢ features that contribute to​ their overall quality, functionality, and aesthetic appeal.‌ these features include the type of leather used, the construction methods employed, the storage capacity ‍and ‌organization options, and the comfort and security features ​integrated into‍ the design.

**Leather Quality:** The quality‍ of the leather is arguably the most‌ vital factor.⁢ Full-grain leather, known for its durability and natural beauty, is the gold⁣ standard. ⁢Top-grain leather offers a good ​balance of quality and ‌affordability. Genuine leather,​ while⁢ less ‌expensive, may not be as durable.Look⁤ for backpacks that specify the type and origin of the leather used, as this can be⁤ a strong⁣ indicator of its longevity and overall value.

Black ‍leather backpacks using full-grain‌ leather only get better ⁣with age by forming their own patina. ⁢Many full-grain leather goods are known to last ‌years ‍if not a lifetime, but they⁣ should be paired with‍ quality hardware. In 2025 ⁤we may even ⁤see some ⁣manufacturers creating products ⁣with vegan ⁣leather, which will be a great option to real leather products for ⁤some consumers.

**Construction and stitching:** The way the backpack is constructed and stitched⁢ together plays ⁤a crucial role in its durability and resistance to daily wear and tear. Look⁣ for‌ backpacks with reinforced stitching, especially at stress points such as the straps and seams. High-quality zippers,‍ buckles,⁣ and other hardware⁢ are also essential for long-lasting performance.The internal lining​ should ⁤be made from a durable material such as canvas or nylon.

Manufacturers that implement⁤ reinforcement​ into​ their stitching and zippers are​ setting themselves up for‍ success. Consumers will likely be happy to pay more for a product that they can trust to ⁢be durable. There‍ are even ⁢companies that offer lifetime‌ warranties on their products, which shows they have complete trust in their​ products.

**Storage and Organization:**‍ A well-designed black leather backpack ⁤should offer ample storage space and thoughtful​ organization options to accommodate your daily⁢ essentials. Look ⁢for backpacks with multiple compartments, including padded⁤ laptop sleeves, internal pockets ⁢for smaller items, and external pockets ‍for fast access to frequently used items such ​as⁣ phones, wallets, and keys. The​ capacity of ‌the backpack should be sufficient to meet your⁣ needs​ without being overly bulky or ⁤cumbersome.

Many individuals these days carry around a multitude of devices and items.Make sure that ⁢you buy a backpack that you can depend on to hold your ⁢items securely, and to do it with​ style. Organizational features will surely be something people ​look for when they​ purchase one ⁢of these​ items.

**Comfort ‍and Ergonomics:** Comfort is paramount,especially if you plan to carry the backpack for extended periods. Look ⁣for backpacks with padded shoulder straps, a padded⁣ back panel, and‍ adjustable straps to ensure‍ a agreeable and‍ secure fit. Some backpacks also feature sternum straps and waist ⁣belts for added ‌support and⁢ stability. The design should distribute the ‍weight evenly across your shoulders and back to ‌minimize ​strain.

comfort is one of the essential aspects people consider when buying a leather backpack. People ‌that use backpacks are doing so to transport items, so make sure whenever you buy a ⁢leather backpack⁣ you consider how comfortable it is‌ going to ‌be.

1l7w7fa,https://www.reddit.com/r/GuyCry/comments/1l7w7fa/think_im_on_the_verge_of_a_breakdown/,Think I'm on the verge of a breakdown,"Hi,

I think I’m on the verge of a breakdown. If I’m being honest, I’ve probably been hovering at the edge for years, but now it feels like one foot has slipped off the cliff.

I’m 36. I’ve been with my wife for 19 years, married for 12. We met young and had our first child at 18. Life came at us fast, and we’ve been in survival mode ever since.

Over the years, my wife has struggled with depression and had postnatal depression after both children. During one of the lowest periods, she had an emotional affair and even went missing at one point, which led me to contact the police to ensure she was safe. That was many years ago, but I realise now I never fully processed it.

More recently, she was diagnosed with cancer. Thankfully, the treatment went well and she’s now physically okay, but emotionally, it triggered another wave of depression.

Through all of this, I’ve tried to be there for her. But in doing so, I lost myself. My confidence, my identity, my self-worth, they’ve slowly eroded. I didn’t just become a partner. I became her carer, whether she asked for it or not. I’d help her get out of bed, skip work to support her at home with the kids, and carry the emotional burden of keeping things together.

Somehow, I kept my career going, and we’re doing well financially. But it’s come at a personal cost. I’ve absorbed years of stress without an outlet.

In the past few months, things have shifted. She’s started going out again, seeing friends for coffee, going out in the evenings. On the surface, that’s a good thing. But it’s triggered intense anxiety in me.

Part of it is rooted in past trauma. I worry she’ll disappear again. Part of it is how emotionally dependent I’ve become. Through always being the one to hold her up, my emotional stability is now completely tied to her. If she’s gone, I panic. If she’s distant, I spiral. I wait around for her like a dog waiting at the door.

I have no friends. I’ve poured everything into work and her. So I talk to her, about everything I’m feeling. And eventually, she reached breaking point. She told me, “I can’t manage my own mental health and take care of someone else’s too.”

I understood her perspective. But I also felt crushed. After nearly 20 years of being there for her, I couldn’t lean on her for even a few months without it becoming too much.

Lately, I’ve tried to bring up the emotional fallout from her past actions, the affair, the lying, the fear. She told me I should’ve dealt with that a decade ago. Maybe she’s right. But the truth is, I never had the space to. I didn’t have time to fall apart. I was keeping everything else going, kids, job, house, her.

She’s also said that some of my behaviours feel controlling. I don’t stop her from going out, but I do get visibly anxious, and I check in more than I should. It’s not about control. It’s about fear. But I know it doesn’t feel that way to her.

We’ve spoken about separation. We agreed to work on things. I promised to manage my anxiety. She promised to communicate better.

She seems lighter these past few days, happier. And instead of relief, I feel resentment. It’s like she gets to be free, to grow, to heal, while I’m silently falling apart.

I was supposed to travel for work today. I got there, turned around, and came home. The anxiety won.

I get obsessive thoughts. What if she’s not okay? What if she realises she doesn’t need me if I’m not there?

I take blame and responsibility in that due to personal and professional reasons, had problems going on and I was pulling away from the relationship and became inconsistent, but then again she never took responsibility for not spending time with me besides going out, partying, daily coffees. No sleepovers, no vacations together, not even showering together, no intimacy or depth in the relationship. I was very supportive of her, pushing her to do things, courses, gym, trips, extra things that will help her in life, while diminishing possible time that we can spend together during the week, and yet somehow I turned out to be the villain in the end. I even got to meeting her parents, her family, being present for events with her but I burned out massively, took me a while to figure what was going on with me, I gave her the world, I would have climbed grabbing the stars for her, but after being burned out not spending enough time with her, I dipped into mirroring her toxic behaviour, she kept me in the dark for months, giving me crumbs while I desperately needed some time away with her, one late night conversation, a shower together, anything. She cried and said she loves me and she will love me forever, but she wasn't emotionally capable of anything right now, she wanted a go-with-the flow lifestyle, apparently us reconnecting in the future is also a possibility. I even feel stupid now writing her a letter, coming out clean with all my mistakes, expressing my deepest emotions. She didn't meet me in any way close to anything I did. Well, news flash, she got a new guy after two weeks, had him lined up before the trip. She's still trying to give me crumbs while dating him, trying to strike a small talk conversations, stalking my socials, posting things that are related to us.

## Authoritative Summary & Key Financials

J.M. Smucker Co. (NYSE: SJM) reported its Fiscal Q4 and full-year 2025 results marked by significant impairment charges, a resulting net loss, stable free cash flow, and strength in its core U.S. coffee segment. These results reflect transformational portfolio shifts—including the Hostess Brands acquisition and several divestitures (Voortman, Sweet Baked Snacks value brands, Canada condiment business, Sahale Snacks).

**Headline Statistics:**
- **Q4 Net Sales:** $2.14 billion (-3% YoY; -1% ex-divestitures/FX)
- **FY25 Net Sales:** $8.7 billion (+7% YoY; flat ex-acquisition/divestitures/FX)
- **Q4 Net Loss/Share:** $(6.85) (vs. $2.30 prior year)
- **FY25 Net Loss/Share:** $(11.57) (vs. $7.13 prior year)
- **Q4 Adjusted EPS:** $2.31 (-13% YoY)
- **FY25 Adjusted EPS:** $10.12 (+2% YoY)
- **Q4 Free Cash Flow:** $298.9M ($816.6M full year)
- **Q4 Cash Flow from Ops:** $393.9M (down from $428.1M)
- **Q4 Gross Margin:** 38.4% (down 300bps)
- **Q4 Operating (Loss):** $(599.1)M vs. $406.0M gain prior year (due to $980M of asset impairments)

## Deep Dive: Catalysts & Segment Trends

### Impairment Charges Drive Losses
Smucker absorbed $867.3M in goodwill impairment (Sweet Baked Snacks unit) and $112.7M in trademark impairment (Hostess brand), leading to a GAAP quarterly net loss of $729M. Excluding these, adjusted EPS remains solid and free cash flow stable, underscoring underlying operational health.

### Portfolio Reshaping: Acquisitions/Divestitures
2025 results reflect the first full quarter of Hostess Brands and the wind-down of lower-performing brands and international assets. These actions compressed reported sales but aimed to refocus on higher-margin/scale categories.

### By Segment (Q4):
- **U.S. Retail Coffee**: Net sales up 11% to $738.6M, driven by higher pricing for Folgers & Café Bustelo (+10% price realization); margin down 300 bps to 28.6% due to input cost inflation.
- **Frozen Handheld & Spreads**: Sales flat at $449.8M; segment profit down 5% on equipment write-off and higher costs.
- **Pet Foods**: Sales -13% to $395.5M, impacted by contract manufacturing rolloff, divestitures, and volume decline in dog snacks. Segment margin up 160 bps on lower cost base.
- **Sweet Baked Snacks**: Revenue -26% (or -14% ex-divestitures/FX); profit -72% with 1,280 bps margin contraction, reflecting Hostess integration expenses and mix shift.
- **International/Away From Home**: Sales +3% to $308.9M; profit +13% driven by net price realization (primarily coffee).

### Full-Year Financials
- **Net cash provided by operations:** $1.21B
- **Free cash flow:** $816.6M
- **Net debt repayments:** $177.6M in Q4
- **Dividends paid:** $455.4M (full year); Q4 dividend per share $1.08 (+2%)

## FY26 Outlook & Technical Analysis

- **Net Sales Growth (guidance):** +2% to +4%
- **Adjusted EPS (guidance):** $8.50 - $9.50
- **Free cash flow:** $875M (midpoint)
- **Capital Expenditures:** $325M
- **Adjusted Gross Margin (guidance):** 35.5%–36.0%
- **Interest Expense:** $380M (rising, reflecting acquisition-related leverage)

**Liquidity & Leverage:**
- **Cash:** $69.9M
- **Current assets:** $2.15B | **Current liabilities:** $2.65B (current ratio ~0.81)
- **Long-term debt:** $7.04B (up from $6.77B)
- **Shareholder equity:** $6.08B (down sharply, reflecting impairments)

The quick ratio and leverage ratios reflect elevated leverage due to recent acquisitions but with a declining net debt profile and robust free cash flow, SJM appears able to manage current debt.

## Risk Factors
SJM highlights exposure to commodity inflation, supply chain disruptions, tariff impacts, integration uncertainties around Hostess Brands, increased debt service, and shifting consumer behavior as key near-term risks, in addition to the potential impact of regulatory and policy changes.

---

## Concluding Insights
Smucker’s Q4 2025 results are marked by large impairment charges tethered to portfolio shifts and the Hostess acquisition—masking solid core operational performance. While EPS on a GAAP basis fell substantially, underlying adjusted EPS and free cash flow remain healthy. Strategic focus is now on margin expansion, deleveraging, and category leadership in coffee and convenience.

1l7w1xs,https://youtu.be/J4BFflBKx1A,3 Very Scary TRUE RV Park Horror Stories,"# ""Gravel and Glass"":

I was thrilled about this RV trip. My friend Jack and I had been dreaming it up for months, a break from our hectic lives in the city. We wanted somewhere quiet, far from traffic and crowds, just the two of us with nature. After scrolling through websites, we found this RV park that looked perfect—nestled in a valley, surrounded by towering pines, with glowing reviews about its peacefulness. The online photos showed neat rows of RV spots, a small pond, and a little office shack that looked like it hadn’t been updated since the ‘80s. It was exactly what we needed. We rented a compact RV, nothing fancy, just enough for a long weekend, and hit the road.When we pulled into the park, it was quieter than I expected. Only three other RVs were scattered across the lot, their awnings rolled up, no signs of life. The office was just like the pictures—a weathered wooden building with a flickering neon sign that read “Check-In.” The guy behind the counter, middle-aged with a stained baseball cap, barely glanced at us. He slid a crumpled map across the counter, circled our spot with a pen, and mumbled, “No loud music.” I nodded, but his lack of interest left me uneasy. Jack grabbed the map, and we drove to our spot at the far end of the park, right up against a dense line of trees that blocked out the rest of the world.The spot was isolated, which I thought was great at first. No neighbors, no noise—just the pines and the faint hum of insects. We parked the RV, its tires crunching on the gravel, and started setting up. Jack unfolded our camp chairs, set up a small propane grill, and tossed a bag of chips onto the rickety table we’d brought. I checked the RV’s locks, tugging on the door and windows to make sure they were secure. It was a habit from living in the city, but out here, it felt a little silly. “This place is dead,” Jack said, cracking open a soda. “Feels like we’re the only ones here.”“It’s peaceful,” I said, trying to shake off the weird feeling in my chest. “Just what we wanted, right?” He shrugged, and we got to work grilling burgers. The smell of charcoal and meat filled the air, and for a while, everything felt normal. We ate, talked about work, and laughed about old college stories. As the sky darkened, we built a small fire in the pit, the flames casting shadows on the RV’s white exterior. The park was silent, no voices, no cars, just the occasional rustle of leaves in the trees. We locked up around 10:30 p.m., double-checking the door. I climbed into the narrow bunk at the back, and Jack took the fold-out couch near the front. The RV creaked as we settled in, but I fell asleep fast, lulled by the quiet.I woke up hours later, my heart hammering. Something was wrong. I lay still, eyes wide, trying to figure out what had pulled me from sleep. Then I heard it—a soft thud, like something heavy brushing against the RV’s side. My mouth went dry. I checked my phone: 2:17 a.m. The screen’s glow felt too bright, and I dimmed it, listening hard. Another thud, then a faint scrape, like metal dragging across metal. My stomach twisted. I slid out of the bunk, my bare feet cold on the RV’s floor, and crept to the nearest window. The blinds were down, but I lifted one slat, just enough to peek outside.Two figures stood near the RV’s door, their shapes blurry in the darkness. One was tall, lanky, wearing a dark hoodie. The other was shorter, broader, his hood up too. They weren’t talking, just moving carefully, like they didn’t want to make noise. The tall one tugged at the door handle, first gently, then with more force. The RV rocked slightly, and I froze, my breath catching. They weren’t just passing by. They were trying to get in.“Jack,” I whispered, my voice barely audible as I shook his shoulder. He groaned, half-asleep, his arm flopping over the edge of the couch. “Jack, wake up. Someone’s outside.”His eyes snapped open, and he sat up, rubbing his face. “What?” he hissed, keeping his voice low. I pointed to the window, my hand shaking. He crawled over, lifting the blind just enough to see. His face went pale, his jaw tightening. “Who the heck are they?” he whispered.“I don’t know,” I said, my voice trembling. “They’re messing with the door.” We heard another scrape, this time near the back window, like they were testing it. My heart pounded so hard I thought it might burst. I remembered the air horn we’d packed for emergencies, stashed in a drawer by the sink. I grabbed it, my fingers fumbling with the cold metal canister. “Should we call 911?” Jack asked, pulling out his phone.“Who’s gonna come out here?” I said, my voice tight. “The office guy didn’t even care we were here. Let’s try scaring them first.” Jack nodded, grabbing a flashlight from under the couch. His hands were shaking too, but he tried to look calm. I moved to the door, air horn in one hand, phone in the other. “Ready?” I whispered. He gave a quick nod, aiming the flashlight at the window.I took a deep breath and pressed the air horn. The sound was like a scream, a sharp, ear-splitting wail that tore through the silence. I heard a shout outside, then the crunch of gravel as footsteps scrambled away. Jack flicked on the flashlight, the beam slicing through the dark. It caught two figures sprinting toward the trees, their hoods up, one of them stumbling over a root. Then they vanished into the shadows.We stood there, frozen, the air horn still buzzing in my ears. “Are they gone?” Jack whispered after a minute, his voice hoarse.“I think so,” I said, but my hands wouldn’t stop shaking. I kept the air horn ready, my eyes darting to every window. We sat in the dark, the flashlight off to save the battery, listening for any sound. The RV felt smaller, like the walls were closing in. “What if they come back?” I said, my voice barely above a whisper.Jack swallowed hard. “They won’t. That horn probably scared them off for good.” But he didn’t sound sure. We debated calling the police, but the signal was weak, and the idea of waiting for help in the middle of nowhere felt risky. “Let’s just stay awake,” I said. “If we hear anything else, we call.”Jack nodded, but his eyes kept flicking to the windows. I sat by the door, air horn in my lap, checking my phone every few minutes. The minutes dragged on, each one heavier than the last. Jack tried to stay awake, but his head kept nodding, his breathing slowing. I didn’t have the heart to wake him again. I just sat there, listening to the silence, my nerves on edge.Around 3 a.m., it started again. Footsteps, slow and deliberate, crunching on the gravel. My blood ran cold. I shook Jack awake, my hand gripping his arm. “They’re back,” I whispered, my voice barely holding together. He jolted upright, grabbing the flashlight. We heard a low voice outside, too muffled to make out words, then a loud thud against the RV’s side. The whole vehicle shook. Another thud, harder, and then a sharp crack—glass breaking near the back window.“Hey!” a voice shouted, rough and angry. “Open the door, now!” My heart stopped. Another bang, like something heavy slamming into the RV. I pictured a crowbar, a bat, something meant to break through. Jack fumbled with his phone, his fingers shaking as he dialed 911. “Police, please,” he whispered, his voice cracking. “We’re at Pine Valley RV Park, spot 27. Someone’s trying to break in.”The banging got louder, more desperate. I heard the crunch of glass underfoot, like they’d shattered the back window completely. “Stay away!” I yelled, my voice breaking. I hit the air horn again, the sound blasting through the RV. The banging stopped for a second, and I heard cursing, then more footsteps—closer now, circling the RV. My hands were sweating so much the air horn nearly slipped from my grip.Jack whispered into the phone, giving details as fast as he could. “Two guys, hoodies, they’re breaking the window,” he said, his voice trembling. The operator told him to stay calm, that help was on the way, but it felt like forever. Another loud crash came from the back, and I saw a hand reach through the broken window, fumbling with the latch. I hit the air horn again, holding it down until my ears rang. The hand jerked back, and I heard more shouting, then footsteps running.In the distance, sirens wailed, faint but growing louder. My knees felt weak, but I kept my eyes on the windows, waiting for another shadow. The red and blue lights finally flashed through the trees, and the sirens screamed closer. The footsteps didn’t come back. When the police arrived, two officers with flashlights searched around the RV. They found footprints in the dirt, a dented crowbar tossed near the trees, and shards of glass from our broken window. “You’re lucky you had that horn,” one officer said, scribbling in his notebook. “This park’s had trouble before—break-ins, theft. You did the right thing staying inside.”They searched the woods but found no one. The men were gone, melted into the night. We taped up the broken window with duct tape, the cold air seeping through the cracks. We didn’t sleep, just sat there, watching the windows until dawn. At first light, we packed up, the RV’s interior a mess of glass and duct tape. Jack looked at me as we pulled out, his face tired. “No more empty parks,” he said, his voice flat.“Yeah,” I said, my hands still gripping the air horn. We drove in silence, the memory of those footsteps, the shouting, the shattering glass replaying in my head. Later, we bought a proper alarm system for the RV, one with motion sensors and a siren. We got pepper spray too, and I’ve been looking into getting a dog—something big, with a bark that carries. That night changed everything. RV camping used to feel like freedom, a way to escape. Now, it’s a reminder to always be ready, to listen for those thuds in the dark.

  


# ""The Watchers at Site Nine"":

I was done with the city—its blaring horns, packed sidewalks, and the constant grind of work emails piling up. I craved quiet, a place to breathe, so when a friend mentioned a small RV park buried deep in the woods, I didn’t hesitate. I packed my RV with canned food, a stack of books, my old Nikon camera, and a folding chair, picturing a week of nothing but trees and solitude. The drive took hours, winding through dense forests and rolling hills, the road narrowing until it was just a dirt path, gravel crunching under my tires. When I pulled into the park, I felt lighter, like I’d already left my stress behind.The park was tiny, maybe a dozen sites total, surrounded by towering pines that blocked out most of the sky. A clear stream ran along the edge, its water gurgling over smooth rocks, and I picked a spot right beside it. The sound was soothing, like nature’s white noise. I spent the first hour setting up—unrolling the awning, hooking up the water, arranging my camp stove. As I worked, I noticed the only other people around: an older couple, probably in their 60s, at the site next to mine. Their RV was a hulking thing, old and battered, with chipped paint and a cracked windshield. What really stopped me, though, were the blackened, charred sausages hanging from the branches of a gnarled oak tree near their site. They dangled on twine, greasy and dark, swaying slightly. It looked wrong, like some kind of ritual or warning. I shook my head, telling myself it was just quirky camper behavior. People get weird when they’re out in the woods.I decided to break the ice, walking over with a wave. The woman was pinning damp clothes to a sagging clothesline, her hands moving fast, like she was in a hurry. “Evening,” I said, keeping my tone friendly. She glanced up, her face etched with deep lines, eyes sharp. “Evening,” she rasped, her voice rough like she’d been chain-smoking for decades. “Nice spot, right?” I tried, gesturing toward the stream. She gave a quick nod, barely looking at me, and went back to her clothes. The man was sitting in a faded lawn chair, sharpening a knife against a whetstone, the slow scrape of metal making my neck prickle. He didn’t acknowledge me at all. I mumbled a “See you around” and headed back, feeling like I’d interrupted something.As I unpacked my cooler, I spotted something else: a small trail camera strapped to a pine tree, its lens aimed directly at my site. It was tucked into the branches, almost hidden, but the angle was unmistakable. My RV, my fire pit, my chair—all in its view. That didn’t sit right. Why would they need to watch me? I walked back over, heart beating a little faster. The man was still sharpening his knife, the sound louder now. “Hi,” I said, forcing a smile. “I noticed your camera’s pointed at my site. Is there a reason for that?” He paused, the knife hovering, and looked at me for the first time. His eyes were pale, almost gray. “Just keeping an eye on things,” he said, his voice flat. “You never know what might happen out here.” I waited for more, but he went back to his knife. “Fair enough,” I said, my mouth dry, and walked away. His words echoed in my head, vague but heavy, like a warning I couldn’t quite grasp.That night, I built a small fire and sat outside, trying to focus on the crackle of the logs and the stream’s soft rush. But the quiet didn’t last. From the couple’s site, I heard low voices—muttering, laughing, a constant hum that never stopped. It wasn’t loud enough to make out words, but it felt deliberate, like they were talking about something they didn’t want me to hear. Every so often, a sharp, high laugh cut through—hers, I think—and it made my skin crawl. I kept glancing at their site, but their fire was just a dim glow, and I couldn’t see them clearly. The camera’s red light blinked in the dark, steady and unyielding, like an eye that never closed. Then came the rustling—soft at first, like leaves brushing together, from the bushes near my RV. I grabbed my flashlight, my pulse racing, and swept the beam across the trees. Nothing. No eyes glinting back, no movement. Probably a squirrel or a deer, I told myself, but my hands were shaking as I set the flashlight down. I stayed by the fire a little longer, but the voices, the laughter, the rustling—it all felt too close. I locked the RV door that night, something I never do when camping.Sleep didn’t come easy. Every creak of the RV, every snap of a twig outside, made me bolt upright, listening. By morning, I was exhausted, my eyes gritty. I stepped outside to make coffee, hoping daylight would shake off the unease. That’s when I heard it: a chorus of loud, frantic crow calls, harsh and urgent, like they were screaming. I looked toward the couple’s site, and my stomach dropped. Under the oak tree, where those sausages had been hanging, there was a dead crow on the ground. Its body was twisted, one wing bent at a sickening angle, feathers scattered like confetti. The sausages were gone—not a single one left, no scraps, no twine. Just the crow, lifeless, and that trail camera still pointed at my site, its red light glowing. I stood there, frozen, my coffee mug trembling in my hand. Had an animal taken the sausages? Had the crow gotten caught somehow? My mind raced, but none of it added up. The camera felt like it was taunting me, recording every second of my fear.I didn’t want to stay another minute. I started packing up, moving faster than I ever had. I folded the chairs, rolled up the awning, unhooked the water line, my hands clumsy with adrenaline. As I tossed my cooler into the RV, I saw the man standing at the edge of my site, just watching. He wasn’t whittling now, just standing with his hands in his pockets, his face blank. “Leaving already?” he asked, his voice low and even. I swallowed hard, trying to sound calm. “Yeah, think I’ll try another park. Got some friends waiting.” It was a lie, but I didn’t want him to know I was alone. He nodded slowly, his eyes never leaving mine. “Be careful,” he said, and the words felt like ice down my spine. I climbed into the driver’s seat, my heart hammering, and started the engine. As I pulled onto the dirt road, I glanced in the rearview mirror. He was still there, standing in the same spot, watching me go. A small smile curled his lips, just enough to make my skin crawl.I drove for hours, not stopping until I was far from that park, my knuckles white on the steering wheel. I kept checking my mirrors, half-expecting to see their battered RV behind me. I don’t know what was going on with that couple—the sausages, the camera, the crow—but it wasn’t right. I’ve camped all over, but I’ve never felt that kind of dread before. I haven’t been back to an RV park since, and I don’t think I ever will.

  


# ""Lot 12"":

I rolled my camper into the RV park just after dusk, the tires grinding over cracked pavement littered with cigarette butts and bottle caps. The place was a mess—faded awnings sagged over rusty trailers, picnic tables were splintered and stained, and a neon “Vacancy” sign buzzed and flickered like it was on its last legs. I’d lost my job two months back, then my apartment when the rent piled up, so this rundown park, tucked off a lonely highway, was my only option. It was cheap, out of the way, and home to a mix of travelers passing through and folks who looked like they’d been stuck here for years. Something about it felt wrong, though, like the air was thick with secrets nobody wanted to share.I parked in Lot 12, next to a sagging trailer with a crooked porch light that cast a sickly yellow glow. A guy named Joe, maybe 60, with a gray beard and deep lines etched into his face, sat outside in a folding chair, smoking a cigarette. He gave a half-wave, his eyes scanning me like he was sizing me up. “New here?” he called, his voice gravelly.“Yeah, just getting settled,” I said, trying to sound friendly as I unhitched my camper.He took a long drag, exhaling smoke that curled in the dim light. “Keep to yourself. Safer that way. Folks here don’t like nosy types.” His tone was low, almost a warning, and he flicked his cigarette butt into the dirt before heading inside. I stood there, keys in hand, wondering what he meant, a knot forming in my stomach.That first night, I couldn’t sleep. The park was too quiet, the kind of silence that feels like it’s hiding something. My camper smelled of mildew, and the thin mattress creaked every time I shifted. Around 2 a.m., a low rumble broke the stillness—a car engine, slow and deliberate. I sat up, heart thumping, and peeked through the blinds. Headlights swept across the lot, pausing on Lot 10, where a young woman lived. I’d noticed her earlier that day, maybe 20, thin as a rail, with stringy brown hair and bruises on her arms that looked fresh. She moved like she was scared of her own shadow, always glancing over her shoulder. An older man, heavy-set with a shaved head and a mean stare, was always near her, barking orders like “Move it!” or “Don’t make me tell you twice.” The car, a dark sedan with tinted windows, idled by her trailer. The older man stepped out, his boots crunching gravel, and yanked the woman out of her trailer door. She stumbled, her hands up like she was bracing for a hit. Her face, lit by the headlights, was pale, eyes wide with fear. He shoved her into the back seat, slamming the door so hard it echoed. The sedan peeled out, tires spitting dirt, and the park went silent again. I stood frozen, my breath shallow, unsure if I’d just seen something I shouldn’t have. I thought about calling the cops, but what would I say? I didn’t even know her name.The next morning, I made coffee in my tiny camper kitchen, the image of her scared face stuck in my head. Joe was outside again, tinkering with a rusty bike. I walked over, mug in hand, trying to act casual. “What’s the deal with that girl in Lot 10?” I asked, leaning against a tree.Joe didn’t look up, just kept twisting a wrench. “What do you mean?”“Saw her last night. Looked like she was in trouble. Some guy pushed her into a car.”He stopped, wiping his hands on a rag, and glanced around like he was checking for listeners. “Listen,” he said, voice barely above a whisper, “best not to get involved. Things happen here. People come and go. You start asking questions, you’ll wish you hadn’t.” He pointed the wrench at me, not threatening, but firm. “Keep your head down, you’ll be fine.” He turned back to his bike, conversation over.His words stuck with me, but so did her face. Over the next few days, I couldn’t shake the feeling that something was wrong. The park felt creepier each night—car engines growled at odd hours, shadows moved between trailers, and I’d hear muffled arguments, voices sharp but words unclear. I started noticing the woman more. She’d sit on a plastic chair outside her trailer, head down, picking at her nails while the older man loomed nearby, yelling things like “Hurry up, we’re late!” or “Stop whining, you’re lucky to be here.” Once, she dropped a bag of groceries, apples rolling into the dirt, and he grabbed her arm so hard she winced. Our eyes met for a second, and I saw desperation, like she was silently begging for help, but she looked away fast when he noticed.By the fourth night, I was jumpy, checking my locks twice. I woke up to a faint scratching sound outside. Heart pounding, I grabbed a flashlight and peered out. Nothing but empty lots and that buzzing neon sign. In the morning, I found a note tucked under my windshield wiper, scrawled in black pen: “Mind your own business. Or else.” The words sent a chill down my spine. I scanned the park, but it was just Joe in the distance, hosing down his trailer, and a couple of kids riding bikes. Someone knew I’d seen something. My truck’s tires were fine, but I noticed fresh scratches on the driver’s side door, like someone had dragged a key across it. I crumpled the note and shoved it in my glovebox, hands shaking.I tried to follow Joe’s advice, to stay out of it, but I couldn’t. That evening, I saw the woman alone, lugging a trash bag to the dumpster at the edge of the park. She looked worse—pale, a new bruise blooming on her cheek, her eyes red like she’d been crying. I grabbed a bag of my own trash as an excuse and walked over. “You okay?” I asked, keeping my voice soft, like I was talking to a scared animal.She froze, the bag slipping from her hands. Her eyes darted around, checking for the man. “Please,” she whispered, voice trembling, “help me. They’re coming back for me tonight.”“Who’s they?” I asked, stepping closer, my pulse racing.“The men,” she said, barely audible. “They… they take people. I didn’t know when I came here. They promised work, but it’s a lie. I can’t stay.” Her words spilled out fast, like she’d been holding them in too long. Before I could ask more, the older man’s voice boomed from her trailer: “Get back here, now!” She flinched, grabbed her bag, and hurried off, leaving me standing there, my mind racing.That night, I couldn’t sleep. I turned off my lights and sat by the window, watching Lot 10 through a crack in the blinds. Around midnight, the dark sedan rolled in, its engine a low growl. The older man dragged her out, her wrists bound with a zip tie. She was sobbing, pleading, “Please, don’t do this!” He slapped her, hard, and shoved her toward the car. I grabbed my phone, hands sweaty, and slipped out the back door of my camper, crouching low in the shadows.I crept closer, hiding behind a rusted pickup truck parked nearby. The man was talking to the driver, a tall guy with a shaved head and a snake tattoo curling up his neck. “She’s the last one for this run,” the driver said, lighting a cigarette. “Boss wants her gone tonight.”“Pay up, then,” the older man growled, pocketing a thick wad of cash from the driver’s hand.My fingers shook as I dialed 911, whispering my location and what I’d seen. “Please hurry,” I said. The operator told me to stay safe, that police were on the way, but the car door slammed, and the engine roared to life. I couldn’t wait. I ran to my truck, parked at the lot’s edge, and followed the sedan, keeping my headlights off and staying far enough back to avoid notice.They drove to an old warehouse a few miles away, surrounded by a sagging chain-link fence and overgrown weeds. I parked behind a cluster of trees, my heart hammering. The sedan’s taillights glowed red as they pulled her inside, her muffled cries echoing in the quiet. I grabbed a flashlight and my pocketknife, not sure what I was planning, but I couldn’t just sit there.I crept to the warehouse, sticking to the shadows. The main door was locked, but a side window was cracked open, smeared with grime. I peered inside. The woman was tied to a metal chair, head slumped, while the two men argued near a stack of crates. “Get her ready,” the driver said. “Truck’s here in an hour. We’re behind schedule.”My phone buzzed—low battery, 5% left. No time to call again. I noticed a fire alarm on the wall outside, its red casing chipped but intact. It was a long shot, but I pulled it. A piercing wail shattered the silence, red lights flashing inside. The men cursed, one shouting, “What the hell is that?” They scrambled, one running to check the door.I used the chaos to slip inside through a side entrance, staying low behind a pile of old tires. The woman saw me, her eyes widening with hope. I crawled over, whispering, “I’m getting you out. Stay quiet.” I cut the zip tie with my knife, my hands clumsy with adrenaline. She rubbed her wrists, tears streaming down her face. “Thank you,” she whispered.We moved toward the side door, but footsteps pounded closer. “Someone’s here!” the driver yelled. I pulled her behind a crate, holding my breath as a flashlight beam swept past. When it moved away, we ran, her hand gripping mine so tight it hurt. We burst out the side door and sprinted for my truck. A shout rang out behind us—“Stop them!”—but I didn’t look back.I fumbled the keys, started the engine, and peeled out, tires kicking up gravel. She was curled in the passenger seat, sobbing. “They were going to sell me,” she said, voice breaking. “They’ve been doing it for months, using the park to find people.”“Who are they?” I asked, checking the rearview mirror for headlights.“Traffickers,” she said. “They promise jobs, a place to stay, then trap you. I was running from my ex, thought the park was safe. They got others, too. I heard them talking.”I drove to a 24-hour gas station, its fluorescent lights a beacon in the dark. I parked near the entrance, where a clerk was visible inside, and called 911 again. She told the cops everything—names, descriptions, the warehouse, even the sedan’s license plate she’d memorized. I gave my statement, the note from my windshield still in my pocket, its words burned into my brain. The cops took her to a safe place, promising to follow up.The next morning, I packed my camper, every creak in the park making me jump. Joe watched from his porch, shaking his head like he’d expected this. “Told you to stay out of it,” he muttered as I drove past. I didn’t reply.A week later, I saw a news report about a police raid at the warehouse. They’d busted a trafficking ring, arrested six men, and rescued three others who’d been held there. The park was mentioned, a “hub” for their operation, luring desperate people with cheap rent. I threw out the note from my windshield, but I still check my locks at night. Every engine rumble, every flash of headlights, takes me back to that park, wondering who’s out there, waiting in the dark.",1,1749554102.0,horrorX,0,1.0,False

Tinder : Totally shitty after 2021. Yeah I hopped on the the app sometime during 2020 pandemic. The app was good but after 2021 it went downhill. The app was filled with catfish accounts and so many fake profiles and that gave me an ick. Plus the app was very glitchy and those bastards banned me for no reason. Met only one person from it. Also I remember the weird verification process where you had to make weird faces. 0/10

Bumble : A decent app. Found my first relationship and my first fling from there. The crowd is good and there are very less catfish accounts. Reporting system works like a charm. Good customer service. Got good amount of likes in one point of time. 7/10

Hinge : Here I faced cut throat competition. Barely got any likes. The crowd here seems rich and great. But yeah the app has improved a bit as there were catfish accounts before. The only shitty thing is that you get very less likes and comments. 6/10

okCupid : The worst of them all. So many fake profiles and nobody is active there. Apart from relationship many people were there only to look for friends and gain Instagram followers. I got likes from people who don't live in Mumbai despite me writing in the bio that swipe only if you're living in Mumbai.  3/10

Boo : Useless app. Like okCupid, nobody there is active. The app was designed with the intention of matching people with personality instead of their pictures but here pictures are required and that defeats the purpose. 2/10

Aisle : Didn't use the app much. Matched with one girl who was like you must meet my parents before meeting me and mind you this was for a first date. 1/10

Schmooze : Good app for swiping memes and uploading them. However there are so many minors on that app. That is concerning. And yeah looks like people over there don't talk much. 4/10

Feeld : The app is literally filled with couples looking for a third or catfishes. You need to pay if you need to get your face blurred in your profile. 1/10

Other apps like Coffee Meets Bagel and Plenty of Fish, I'd rate them 3/10

## Key Features Analysis

The selection of a hot beverage dispenser depends greatly on its technical specifications and capabilities. These factors ensure efficiency, durability, and ease of use in a high-traffic buffet setting.

**capacity and Throughput:** The perfect dispenser must address the volume of customers at your business.

capacity is a critical factor, particularly for high-volume breakfast buffets. Dispensers should hold a sufficient quantity of liquid to minimize refills during peak hours. Look for dispensers with capacities ranging from 3 to 5 gallons per chamber, depending on your anticipated demand.Throughput, the speed at which the dispenser can heat and dispense beverages, is equally critically importent. Models boasting rapid heating elements and efficient dispensing mechanisms can substantially reduce wait times and keep customers satisfied.

**Temperature Control and consistency:** Maintaining consistent beverage temperature is integral to a satisfying customer experience.Precise temperature control ensures that beverages are served at the ideal temperature, preventing them from becoming too hot or lukewarm. Look for dispensers with adjustable thermostats and digital displays that allow for precise temperature settings. Advanced models may also feature automatic temperature monitoring and adjustment to maintain consistent heat levels throughout the dispensing process, regardless of usage patterns.

**Insulation and Energy Efficiency:** A key feature that will help businesses save on energy costs.

Effective insulation is crucial for maintaining beverage temperature and reducing energy consumption. Dispensers with double-walled construction and vacuum insulation provide superior heat retention, minimizing heat loss and reducing the need for frequent reheating. Energy-efficient models also contribute to cost savings by consuming less electricity during operation. Seek out dispensers with certifications like Energy Star to ensure optimal energy performance.

**material and Durability:** Selecting a dispenser that can withstand continuous use.The material used in the construction of a hot beverage dispenser directly affects its durability and longevity. Stainless steel is the preferred material for interior and exterior components due to its resistance to corrosion, ease of cleaning, and ability to withstand high temperatures. Polycarbonate or Tritan plastic spigots and lids offer good durability and resistance to cracking or breaking.Heavy-duty models with reinforced construction are better suited for high-volume buffet settings were they will be subjected to heavy use and potential impacts.

**Cleaning and Maintenance Features:** Easily disassembled parts simplify the cleaning process.

Dispensers with easy-to-disassemble components and smooth, non-porous surfaces are essential for simplifying cleaning and maintenance. Removable drip trays, spigots, and internal parts facilitate thorough cleaning, preventing the build-up of residue and bacteria. Dishwasher-safe components further streamline the cleaning process. Look for dispensers with self-cleaning functions or descaling programs to maintain optimal performance and extend the lifespan of the equipment.

Portion control features, available on some dispensers, further reduce waste by ensuring that customers dispense only the amount of beverage they intend to consume. Efficient heating elements and insulation minimize energy consumption, lowering utility bills.

**Enhanced Operational Efficiency:** More efficient machines reduce burden on staff.

Automated features, such as automatic temperature monitoring and self-cleaning functions, reduce the workload for buffet staff, freeing them up to focus on other tasks. Easy-to-use dispensers reduce the need for constant monitoring and adjustments.quick-fill capabilities and large-capacity reservoirs minimize refill frequency,streamlining beverage service during peak hours.

## FAQs Section

Understanding common questions about hot beverage dispensers can help in the decision-making process. Here are some frequently asked questions and thier answers.

**What are the typical power requirements for a hot beverage dispenser?**

Most hot beverage dispensers for commercial use require a standard 120V electrical outlet. Though, some high-capacity or high-output models may require 220V outlets, so it is indeed essential to check the specifications before purchasing. The wattage rating indicates the power consumption, which can range from 500 watts for smaller dispensers to 1500 watts or more for larger, more powerful units.

**How often should I clean and maintain my hot beverage dispenser?**

Daily cleaning is recommended to remove any spills or residue. A more thorough cleaning, including disassembling and cleaning the spigot and internal components, should be performed weekly or bi-weekly, depending on usage. Descaling is necessary every 1-3 months, depending on the water quality in your area, to prevent mineral buildup. Regular maintenance, such as replacing worn parts and inspecting the unit for leaks, should also be performed periodically to ensure optimal performance and longevity.

**Can I use different types of beverages in the same dispenser?**

While some dispensers are designed for specific beverages like coffee or hot chocolate, many models can accommodate a variety of hot liquids, including water, tea, and milk-based drinks. However, it is essential to thoroughly clean the dispenser between different beverages to prevent flavor contamination. Some dispensers have separate compartments or dispensing heads for different beverages, which can mitigate this issue and improve efficiency.

**What features should I look for to ensure the dispenser is user-friendly for both staff and customers?**

look for dispensers with clear and intuitive controls,easy-to-read temperature displays,and ergonomic dispensing mechanisms. Spill containment features, such as drip trays and splash guards, help to minimize messes and prevent accidents. Dispenser height and spigot placement should be accessible to a wide range of users, including those with disabilities. Simple disassembly and easy-to-clean components make maintenance easier for staff.

It’s driving me crazy to have him constantly in the house. Previously he worked a full time dayshift job for 35 years so I got used to my quiet time but now I’m constantly overstimulated. Before I would get up, drink my coffee in complete silence, have the house cleaned by noon, and then have an afternoon of reading a book in a silent house before he got home. 

Now? The television is on and blasting 24 hours a day. He never turns it off. The house is never quiet like I’m accustomed to. He also sits up all night so he sleeps from approximately 4am until 1pm, so I have to tiptoe around for half the day and forget cleaning while he’s asleep. Speaking of cleaning, I still do all of the household chores although he has nothing better to do. And 90% of the kitchen mess is his anyway because he’s home for meals instead of eating at work. 

I get zero quiet time. Even when he’s asleep the tv is on top volume. And when he’s awake he’s constantly talking. He never shuts up. He will literally see me with an open book and gets his feelings hurt when I don’t want to have a full blown conversation at the moment. I’m definitely a homebody so it’s not an option for me to get out of the house for some peace, I much prefer being at home. I’ve urged him to pick up his previous hobbies, such as hunting, fishing, and hiking but he refuses. He’s content to stare at the tv for 15 hours a day and talk talk talk the entire time. 

I feel terribly guilty because I’m beginning to resent his constant presence. I love him dearly but jfc I need space and quiet! I have my 4 year old grandson 50-75% of the time here recently and even when I get a break from him I still have to deal with my bf. I could never voice these thoughts out loud and hurt his feelings. It’s his house too and he’s perfectly entitled to spend his retirement however he wants to. But damn…I guess I just need to get used to no quiet and no alone time.

Rose Marshall had been in love for ten years before she found out the truth: all those years of living frugally and saving up to support her boyfriend’s PhD… had gone straight into her best friend’s pockets.  
  
…  
  
She never imagined that after spending over ten hours on a train to visit him, what she’d walk into would feel like a knife to the heart.  
  
Her boyfriend—the one who had been with her since high school, who had sworn over and over that he’d grow old with her—was now strolling hand in hand with her best friend, Vivian Brown, under the shade of the plane trees.  
  
Vivian’s belly had already started to show. She was pregnant.  
  
It was like someone had dropped Rose into an ice bath. Every cell in her body froze, her limbs trembling uncontrollably.  
  
She didn’t want to believe Ethan Walker had cheated. But those interlocked fingers and the way they looked at each other—syrupy sweet and intimately familiar—shattered her unshakable trust.  
  
Ethan didn’t notice her. He and Vivian turned into the apartment building.  
  
Rose stood alone in the blazing sun, feeling like a discarded child. Even the 140°F heat couldn’t thaw her frozen heart.  
  
""Ethan Walker,"" she called out, refusing to back down.  
  
Through the glass doors, she saw Ethan’s back go rigid. His arm shot away from Vivian’s like it had been spring-loaded.  
  
Slowly, he turned around. His expression shifted wildly—from panic to embarrassment and everything in between.  
  
He said something to Vivian. Vivian stayed where she was while Ethan came to Rose alone.  
  
""Hey, Rose...""  
  
He stood in front of her, awkward and guilty, like he’d just been caught red-handed. ""Why didn’t you tell me you were coming? I could’ve picked you up.""  
  
""I thought my arrival would be a surprise,"" Rose said bitterly. ""Didn’t expect it to scare you instead.""  
  
Ethan looked at her with guilt all over his face. The Rose standing before him was nothing like the strong, proud woman he knew. She looked like a doll caught in the wind—empty, lifeless.  
  
She had loved him for ten years. She used to be the light in his life. His family had struggled, and back in school, other students looked down on him, but Rose never did. She pushed him to chase his dreams. When he had no money, she gave him every dollar she’d saved from work after graduation. And when he left home, she took on the burden of caring for his parents without a second thought.  
  
Ethan knew he owed her—more than he could ever repay.  
  
""Rose, it’s too hot out here. Come inside and we’ll talk.""  
  
He reached for her arm.  
  
Rose yanked herself back, flinging his hand away like it burned her.  
  
Ethan froze.  
  
Rose stared him down. ""Ethan, just give me one honest answer. How long have you been with her?""  
  
""Not long,"" he muttered.  
  
""How long is not long?"" Her voice shot up, sharp with rage and disbelief.  
  
""A year,"" he said.  
  
Rose staggered. Her face went completely pale.  
  
""You still had the nerve to ask me for money?""  
  
""I know it wasn’t right, Rose. But Vivian got pregnant—it wasn’t planned. We were desperate. And you know I’ve been buried in my thesis—I didn’t have time to work. That’s the only reason I asked.""  
  
As Rose stared at him, he suddenly felt like a stranger. So unfamiliar, it scared her.  
  
""I sent you thirty thousand dollars over the past three years. I want every last cent back."" Rose was kind, but her kindness was for people who treated her right.  
  
Ethan panicked. ""Are you trying to ruin me? I don’t have that kind of money!""  
  
Tears welled up in Rose’s eyes. ""Ethan, don’t push me.""  
  
Ethan’s tone softened. ""Rose, this isn’t all my fault. I told you—I was lonely here. I needed someone. And you refused to live with me before marriage. I’m a man. Having a girlfriend like that felt like being single. So yeah, I slipped up with Vivian. But love doesn’t have a right or wrong. Since we weren’t meant to be, why not let me and Vivian be together?""  
  
Rose actually laughed. ""Fine. You two can have each other. But I want my money back. And after today, I never want to see either of you again.""  
  
She didn’t give him a chance to speak. Grabbing her suitcase, she turned and walked away.  
  
Vivian, her so-called best friend, didn’t even try to explain. She couldn’t even meet Rose’s eyes.  
  
Rose booked a return ticket on the next train out.  
  
The breakup hit her like a heavy pour of liquor—leaving her dazed for days.  
  
She’d never been a drinker, but now she spent every night in a bar, drowning her shattered nerves in alcohol.  
  
""Dr. Marshall. Drinking’s bad for your health.""  
  
The voice was smooth and deep. A slender hand snatched the glass from hers.  
  
Rose looked up through her drunken haze.  
  
The man in front of her had a cool, elegant air—and a face that rivaled any A-list celebrity. But years of insomnia had left dark circles under his eyes. It didn’t take away from his looks. If anything, it made him even more dangerously attractive.  
  
She recognized him. He was one of her patients—suffering from sleep disorders.  
  
He’d always been tight-lipped about the cause, so she never prescribed nerve suppressants without fully understanding the situation. Instead, she gave him her number and told him to call whenever he couldn’t sleep.  
  
They’d talked a few times late at night. It wasn’t nothing.  
  
""Mr. Jefferson, I just got dumped,"" she slurred. Normally reserved, she now seemed desperate to tell the whole world.  
  
Houston Jefferson paused, then said gently, ""All you lost was someone who didn’t love you.""  
  
Something about that sentence made the dam inside her break. She sniffled, choking on her own tears.  
  
""We were together ten years. We were supposed to get married this year. But now he’s with my best friend. My family’s been pushing for a wedding. I don’t even know what to tell them.""  
  
She clutched her head, yanking her hair so hard it made her scalp tingle—like the pain could drown out her heartbreak.  
  
""Marry me,"" Houston said quietly.



**Chapter 2 My Perfect Hubby**



Rose thought she must’ve lost her mind—there was no way she’d just heard what she thought she did. ""Mr. Jefferson, what did you just say?""  
  
""Rose, marry me. I may not have a PhD like your ex, but I’d never live off you. I’ll cover all the household expenses. You can use your income however you want. And I would never betray our marriage or do anything to humiliate you.""  
  
Under normal circumstances, if someone had proposed to her out of the blue like that, Rose—a woman who prided herself on her rationality—would’ve assumed he’d taken leave of his senses.  
  
But now, with her heart in tatters thanks to Ethan, and her family breathing down her neck about marriage, Rose found herself wavering.  
  
Almost without thinking, she nodded. ""Mr. Jefferson, I’m willing to marry you. But I want to split the household expenses fifty-fifty. Equal status. And I want fifty percent say in all family decisions."" If there wasn’t going to be love, she wanted equality.  
  
Houston’s lips curled faintly. She worked at one of the top hospitals in the city, but that meager salary? No way it could cover half his lifestyle.  
  
""I respect your terms,"" he said.  
  
""So… should we go to the civil office now?""  
  
""Sure,"" Houston agreed without hesitation.  
  
…  
  
The breeze blew gently as they arrived, and the wind only seemed to heighten the alcohol still swirling in Rose’s system.  
  
She looked up at Houston in a daze. He wore a perfectly tailored black suit, dignified and composed. The white shirt underneath, paired with a blue diagonal-striped tie, gave his mature aura a surprising edge of youthful charm.  
  
He looked just like a groom.  
  
Houston, too, was sizing up Rose.  
  
He’d seen her in a lab coat before—poised, focused, almost intimidating. But in casual clothes, she had a fragile softness that stirred something protective in him.  
  
""Rose, I hope you understand—marrying me is for life. In my view, divorce doesn’t exist. Only death can end a marriage.""  
  
Rose’s cheeks were flushed, her steps still a little wobbly, but she nodded firmly. ""Good. That’s exactly how I see it too.""  
  
Houston turned and walked inside.  
  
Rose followed like a puppet on strings. They approached the marriage counter, filled out forms, took photos, went through every step, and finally received two marriage certificates.  
  
""Congratulations,"" said the clerk warmly. ""You two might be the most perfect match I’ve ever seen.""  
  
""Thank you,"" Rose mumbled, dazed.  
  
Houston had clearly heard one too many compliments in his life—he didn’t even flinch at the praise. Cool and collected, he slipped the marriage certificate into the pocket of his suit, then strode confidently toward the exit with those long, evenly proportioned legs.  
  
Rose had to jog to keep up. When Houston realized she’d fallen behind, he suddenly stopped to wait.  
  
She caught up, slightly out of breath. ""My legs are too short. I can’t run fast.""  
  
Houston’s gaze dropped to her legs. They were long, lean, and pale—better than most supermodels.  
  
Without warning, he swept her up into his arms. ""I’ll carry you.""  
  
The next morning, Rose woke up with a pounding headache.  
  
The first thing she saw was a ridiculously handsome face. Her heart nearly leapt out of her chest. She instinctively threw back the covers to make sure she was fully clothed—and only then could she breathe again.  
  
Houston was a light sleeper. Her panicked breathing woke him instantly, and he opened his dark, mesmerizing eyes.  
  
Noticing her panic, he gently tapped her nose. ""Relax, Rose. I wouldn’t waste my first time on a drunk.""  
  
She relaxed a little, but her eyes still held a wary edge.  
  
Frowning, Houston reached for the marriage certificate on the nightstand and handed it to her. ""We got married. Don’t tell me you forgot?""  
  
Rose swallowed hard. Images from the night before flickered through her mind in fragments. She slumped, embarrassed.  
  
""Regretting it already?"" Houston asked.  
  
Before she could shake her head, he added, ""Well, it’s too late. You dragged me to the civil office. You’re responsible for me now. You can’t just wake up sober and pretend none of it happened. I’m not about to be some divorced man with baggage.""  
  
Rose puffed up her chest. ""Don’t worry. I’ll take full responsibility.""  
  
But in her head, she was spiraling—*What have I done? What if he turns out to be violent? Or a gold digger? Or worse… a narcissist?*  
  
Just then, her phone rang. The screen flashed: *Ethan Walker*.  
  
She glanced awkwardly at Houston. ""Um… it’s my ex.""  
  
""Darling,"" Houston said smoothly, ""need my help?""  
  
That one word—*darling*—snapped Rose back to her senses. She had a husband now. She couldn’t have anything to do with another man.  
  
She declined the call.  
  
But Ethan was relentless. The phone kept ringing.  
  
Houston extended his hand. ""Give it to me."" There was a note of authority in his voice.  
  
Rose hesitated, then placed the phone in his palm.  
  
Houston answered the call. Ethan’s anxious voice came through, ""Rose, you finally picked up. Something happened at home. Can you go check on my mom? My sister said she hasn’t been eating and even started coughing up blood. Can you take her to the hospital? Stay with her a few days? I’ll treat you to a nice dinner later.""  
  
""You done?"" Houston’s voice cut in coldly.  
  
Ethan was stunned silent for a moment. Then he exploded, ""Who are you? Why do you have Rose’s phone?!""  
  
Houston replied, ""Rose broke up with you. Stop dragging her into your mess. She doesn’t owe you anything. If you bother her again, I’ll make sure you regret it.""  
  
He hung up—calm and elegant.  
  
But a moment later, the phone rang again.  
  
This time, Rose answered. ""Ethan, we’re over. Your family’s problems are none of my business. Don’t ever call me again.""  
  
""Rose, who was that guy just now?"" Ethan sounded furious.  
  
""You don’t have the right to ask about my personal life anymore,"" she said coolly.  
  
Ethan was momentarily speechless.  
  
Then he let out a long sigh and said helplessly, ""Rose, I know our breakup hit you hard. But please, don’t throw yourself away on some random guy. I’d feel awful.""  
  
""Ethan,"" she said, her voice like ice, ""one more reminder—we’re not friends. We’re complete strangers now. Stay out of my life.""  
  
She hated him. Hated him.  
  
Ethan tried one last angle. ""Rose, your medical notes are still at my place. What, are you never going to come back for them?""  
  
Rose’s heart faltered. Those notes—years of her hard work and dedication. It wasn’t something she could just leave behind.  
  
Houston noticed the concern in her eyes. ""Do you need something from his home?"" he asked.  
  
Rose nodded. ""My medical notes.""  
  
""I’ll take you,"" Houston said.  
  
Ethan’s voice came through the phone again. ""And don’t forget to take my mom to the hospital.""

**Chapter 3 Awakening**



Rose hung up on Ethan without hesitation.  
  
A short while later, Houston pulled up in his sleek black Mercedes. About an hour later, the two of them arrived in front of a run-down apartment complex.  
  
Houston eyed the dilapidated building with a frown. The reek of mixed garbage drifted out from the trash area, and grime was caked between the uneven stone slabs on the ground. For someone with OCD-level cleanliness like him, the scene instantly made his stomach churn.  
  
Rose glanced back at him. ""Why don’t you wait in the car?""  
  
Houston nodded. ""Yeah.""  
  
As soon as she turned away, he ducked into the car and shut the windows, finally managing to suppress the wave of nausea.  
  
There was no elevator in the old building, so Rose ran up the stairs. Through the windshield, Houston watched her without blinking, a soft, indulgent smile touching his lips.  
  
By the time she reached the seventh floor, Rose was panting. She knocked on the door to apartment 701. After a long wait, Ethan's sister finally answered.  
  
""Rose, what took you so long?"" Chloe Walker complained.  
  
""I’m just here to pick up the stuff I left here,"" Rose said bluntly, not letting the girl get the wrong idea.  
  
Chloe blinked. ""But my brother said you were coming to take my mom to the hospital.""  
  
""I’m a psychiatrist,"" Rose said coldly. ""Your mom’s condition is outside my scope.""  
  
Chloe scowled. ""So now that you and my brother broke up, you’re just cutting ties?""  
  
She started muttering, ""It’s not like you and my brother even lived together. And he never hid the fact that he liked Vivian. He just didn’t want to hurt you since you were so into him. Was that really such a crime? Do you have to be so petty?""  
  
Rose’s face darkened. From what she was hearing, Chloe had known about the affair all along—yet kept it from her, while happily accepting her help and support all year.  
  
Without another word, Rose brushed past her and entered the study, dragging out a box of her precious handwritten medical notes.  
  
Chloe grabbed her arm. ""Since you’re already here, can’t you take my mom to the hospital too?""  
  
Rose was done being the Walker family’s free on-call maid. She shook Chloe off sharply. ""No.""  
  
""You’re a doctor! What kind of doctor just lets someone suffer?""  
  
Rose stopped mid-step. Her professional oath wouldn’t let her walk away from a patient in need. A doctor’s duty was to ease suffering—even death row inmates had the right to treatment.  
  
She turned back. ""Where is she?""  
  
Chloe opened the door to the her mom's bedroom. Through the gap, Rose saw Samantha Brooks sitting on the bed, her face pale and gaunt, eyes vacant. A dark, wet stain had spread beneath her on the floor—she’d wet herself. Something was very wrong.  
  
Rose rushed in, setting aside her personal feelings, and began a full checkup—pupils, heartbeat, pulse. Then she turned and snapped at Chloe, furious.  
  
""She’s in critical condition. Why the hell didn’t you take her to the hospital earlier?""  
  
Chloe looked lost. ""How was I supposed to know? I’m not a doctor! She was totally fine yesterday!""  
  
""What do we do now?"" Chloe stammered. She was just a college freshman and clearly panicking.  
  
""Ask your brother,"" Rose said icily.  
  
Chloe immediately called Ethan. After a few words, he told her to hand the phone to Rose.  
  
Rose didn’t want to take it, but Chloe shoved it at her.  
  
""Rose, my sister’s still young. She can’t handle this kind of thing. Just do what you think is best. I trust you. Please help my mom.""  
  
Rose let out a bitter, disbelieving laugh. ""Ethan, what the hell did I do in a past life? Run over your dog? Burn down your house? Whatever bad karma I owe, I’ve paid it. I don’t owe you anything.""  
  
Ethan lowered his voice like he was trying to smooth things over. ""Look, I know I messed up. But you’re a doctor. Walking away now? That’s not who you are. Karma’s a real thing, Rose.""  
  
""You’re disgusting,"" Rose growled through gritted teeth.  
  
Half an hour later, Houston spotted Rose coming down the stairs—with Ethan’s mother slung on her back.  
  
He jumped out of the car and ran over. ""Let me.""  
  
He gently took Samantha from her, lifting her onto his back instead.  
  
Chloe’s jaw dropped. Houston’s air of elegance, his strikingly beautiful face, the luxury car that had to cost over six figures—she couldn’t take her eyes off him.  
  
""Rose, who is that? He looks rich. Is he single?""  
  
Rose ignored her. Instead, she quickly opened the car door so Houston could carefully settle Samantha in the back seat.  
  
Then Houston got into the driver’s seat. Rose started to open the passenger side door, but Chloe darted ahead.  
  
""Rose, I get carsick. Can I sit in the front?""  
  
Rose blinked. Since when did Chloe get carsick?  
  
""That seat’s reserved for my wife."" Houston’s cold voice cut through the air like a blade.  
  
Chloe turned bright red and climbed out, reluctantly taking the back seat.  
  
But when she saw Rose slide into the passenger seat, she froze.  
  
""Why does she get to sit there?"" she muttered.  
  
Too bad neither Rose nor Houston bothered responding.  
  
At the hospital, Rose used her credentials to get Samantha admitted quickly. But when it came time to pay the bill, Chloe didn’t budge.  
  
Rose handed her the receipt. ""Go pay.""  
  
Chloe gawked. ""I don’t have any money. Can’t you just finish what you started…?""  
  
Out of habit, Rose reached into her bag to pull out her card—but Houston placed his hand over hers.  
  
His voice was low and forceful. ""If you’re broke, go ask your brother. Rose doesn’t owe you anything. You’re not her family. You’ve gotten all the help you’re going to get. Rose, let’s go.""  
  
Chloe flushed with shame.  
  
By the time Rose and Houston left the hospital, the sun was beating down fiercely.  
  
Houston got a call from his company and looked at her apologetically. ""Rose, the chairman just dropped in. I’m really sorry—I’ve got to head in right now.""  
  
As someone who also worked for a rigid system, Rose understood. She waved him off generously. ""Don’t worry about me. Go. I’ll talk to you later.""  
  
Houston handed her his keys. ""Take my car home. I’ll come pick you up later. At *our* place.""  
  
Then he turned and hurried across the street to the crowded bus stop.  
  
Rose stared after him, dumbfounded. When she saw his tall figure squeezed awkwardly into an overpacked bus, something in her chest stirred unexpectedly.



**Chapter 4 The Wedding Falls Apart, A New Groom Appears**



Rose drove the Mercedes back to the Bloomingdale Residence, parked it in the garage, and took the elevator upstairs. She was hoping to sneak in quietly, but the moment she opened the door, she found her mother—Linda Smith—standing right there.  
  
""Rose, you’re home!"" Linda yanked her straight to the couch, then launched into a barrage of questions.  
  
""So? How did it go with Ethan? Did he finally agree to a New Year’s Day wedding?""  
  
Rose looked at her mother’s hopeful face and didn’t know how to break it to her.  
  
""Mom… there’s no wedding.""  
  
Linda threw up her hands. ""What do you mean there’s no wedding? You promised me before you left that you’d get Ethan to say yes this time. I already told everyone—friends, family—the whole New Year’s Day celebration is on the books! Do you have any idea how embarrassing this is for me?""  
  
Rose kept her head down in silence.  
  
Linda’s voice rose. ""We’ve made every compromise. We didn’t ask for a dowry, didn’t ask him to buy a house—we’re practically giving our daughter away for free. What more does that boy want? Rose, call him. Right now. I want to hear from him directly—when the hell does he plan to marry you?""  
  
Rose squirmed with discomfort. She and Ethan had broken up. Contacting him again wasn’t even on her radar.  
  
Seeing her hesitating only made Linda angrier. ""That Ethan’s been stringing you along for years. If he really loved you, he could’ve married you *before* going off for his PhD!""  
  
Rose’s face burned.  
  
Her mom was right—Ethan never loved her the way she’d hoped. She’d been too stubborn, too proud, convinced that since she’d chosen him, he was the one. But love changes. He had already run away.  
  
""Mom… maybe I should just break up with him…"" Rose tested the waters carefully.  
  
Linda’s fury exploded. She grabbed Rose by the ear and yelled, ""Are you insane? You supported that man for ten years—fed him, paid his tuition, carried him through school—and now that he’s finally about to start making money, *you* dump *him*? What, you want all those years to be a total waste? And let’s be honest—you’re not exactly twenty anymore. Where do you think you’re going to find someone better than him?""  
  
Just then, Rose’s father—Sam Marshall—walked through the door holding a wedding invitation. When he saw Linda’s sour face, he froze.  
  
Linda spotted the invitation and exploded again. ""What are you doing with that? We don’t need it anymore. Toss it.""  
  
But Sam held it to his chest like it was gold. ""Relax. It’s not ours. It’s from Aaron Brown, next door.""  
  
Then he adjusted his gold-rimmed glasses and added excitedly, ""Vivian—Rose’s best friend—snagged herself a golden goose. Aaron was bragging nonstop about how his daughter might not have a degree, but she landed a man who does. And get this—she’s already pregnant. They’re getting engaged on New Year’s Day.""  
  
It felt like someone had dumped a bucket of ice water over Rose’s head. Ethan and Vivian… were getting married on New Year’s Day?  
  
She’d spent ten years with Ethan. Every time she brought up marriage, he had an excuse. But with Vivian, after *one* year, he was ready to settle down?  
  
Did he *ever* love her at all?  
  
Linda, already on edge, lost it. ""Look at Vivian! She still ended up with a PhD husband and is getting married after one year. And you? I don’t care what you say. You and Ethan are getting married on New Year’s Day.""  
  
Sam tried to play peacemaker. ""That’s right. I already talked to Aaron—we’ll hold a joint wedding. Make it festive, big and bold!""  
  
""Dad, Mom, I *don’t* want to get married on New Year’s Day."" Rose’s voice was firm.  
  
The second she said it, Linda practically had a meltdown. ""If you’re not getting married on New Year’s Day, then don’t bother calling me your mother!""  
  
The outburst triggered her heart condition. Her lips turned visibly blue. Rose was so frightened she couldn’t say another word.  
  
Panicked, she gave in. ""Okay, Mom. Don’t get worked up. I promise—I’ll get married on New Year’s Day.""  
  
The effect was instant. Linda’s condition stabilized almost immediately.  
  
Later, once Linda had fallen asleep, Rose crept back to her room, weighed down with worry. She flopped onto the bed, her head spinning over the idea of a wedding on New Year’s Day.  
  
Would Houston even want a ceremony?  
  
She couldn’t help remembering all the times she had begged Ethan to marry her—each conversation painful and humiliating. She had absolutely no confidence this time.  
  
Just then, as if summoned by her thoughts, her phone rang. It was Houston.  
  
She picked up, and his deep, velvety voice came through, sounding cheerful. ""Rose, I’m outside your place. I came to take you home.""  
  
She nearly dropped her phone. That’s right—he’d told her earlier he’d pick her up after work.  
  
But she hadn’t told her parents about the marriage yet.  
  
Rushing to the front door, she whispered to him, ""My mom’s heart acted up earlier… Maybe don’t mention the wedding just yet.""  
  
Houston paused. Was she asking him to hide their marriage?  
  
Linda’s weak voice called out from the living room. ""Rose, who’s here?""  
  
""A patient,"" Rose lied quickly.  
  
Sam helped Linda out to the living room. Both of them froze when they saw Houston standing there with high-end gifts in hand.  
  
A luxury bottle of whiskey—Sam’s favorite. Expensive tonic supplements—Linda’s go-to.  
  
This was supposed to be a patient bribing their daughter?  
  
""Mr. Jefferson…"" Linda said awkwardly. ""We’re just regular folks. Rose finally got a good job, so please don’t bring gifts. If her company thinks she’s accepting bribes, it could cost her everything.""  
  
Houston shot Rose a sharp look. Because of her lie, Linda now thought he was a pushy patient trying to butter them up.  
  
He had never *bribed* anyone in his life—people usually tried to bribe *him*.  
  
""Madam,"" he said coldly, ""yes, I’m Dr. Marshall’s patient. But we’re also friends. These are just small gifts—my way of being polite as a guest.""  
  
The tension in Linda’s chest eased. Smiling now, she said, ""Well, if you’re Rose’s friend, then stay for dinner!""  
  
""Gladly,"" Houston replied.  
  
Linda was stunned.  
  
She’d only said it to be polite—how did he actually agree?  
  
Turning to Rose, she sighed, ""Since your friend’s staying, make something nice for dinner. There’s abalone, lobster, beef—cook it all.""  
  
Sam, meanwhile, pulled Houston toward the couch. ""Come on, Houston. Sit, sit.""  
  
Rose gave Houston a worried glance. Her parents had always been tough on any man who came near her. Who knew what kind of test they’d throw at him next?



**Chapter 5 The Scheming Son-in-Law and the Crushed Rival**



""I’ll go start cooking, then."" Rose headed toward the kitchen, throwing anxious glances back at her parents, who were clearly being overly warm to Houston. She felt a pang of worry for him.  
  
She took pork ribs, fish, and shrimp out of the fridge… but as she weighed the ingredients, a sharp clarity hit her like a splash of cold water.  
  
Baby back ribs, Cajun blackened fish, garlic butter shrimp—those were all Ethan’s favorites.  
  
But this meal wasn’t for Ethan. It was for her new husband, Houston.  
  
Rose put everything back and instead prepared a bowl of homemade chicken noodle soup with a few simple farmer’s market sides—roasted carrots, sautéed greens, nothing fancy, but comforting and nourishing.  
  
Meanwhile, in the living room, Sam and Linda sat across from Houston, all four eyes sharply inspecting him.  
  
They’d always believed that any man who came to their house looking for Rose was just trying to make a move on her.  
  
Now that Rose was supposedly engaged, their default approach to male visitors was simple: block, dismantle, and destroy.  
  
""Houston,"" Linda began, ""Rose and Ethan are getting married on New Year’s Day. You *must* come to the wedding.""  
  
Houston’s smile curved upward. His wife marrying another man? And he was expected to attend as a guest? Sorry—he wasn’t *that* open-minded.  
  
""New Year’s Day?"" he repeated. ""What a coincidence. I’m getting married that day too.""  
  
Of course he’d be at the wedding. He was the groom.  
  
Linda glanced at Houston’s bare finger and a flicker of suspicion crossed her face.  
  
""Well, what are the odds? Houston, be sure to send me an invitation. I’d love to attend your wedding.""  
  
Houston smiled and shot back, ""Then I’ll take one of Rose’s invitations too.""  
  
""Sam, the invites,"" Linda said quickly.  
  
Sam opened the drawer of the coffee table and handed him a pre-printed wedding invitation.  
  
Houston accepted it with both hands. His eyes narrowed as they landed on the names: Ethan and Rose, surrounded by a little heart with the words *Forever Together*.  
  
His smile vanished.  
  
So it really had gotten that far between her and Ethan?  
  
Houston was fiercely competitive. Ethan was part of Rose’s past—but there was no way he’d allow himself to lose to that man.  
  
""Well, looks like Ethan finally came to his senses. Congrats to Rose. She *finally* got what she wanted."" He deliberately emphasized *finally*, highlighting how long Ethan had dragged her through the mud.  
  
Sam and Linda’s expressions darkened. Their resentment toward Ethan flared again.  
  
""Where’s the wedding being held?"" Houston pressed.  
  
Their faces fell even further. The truth was, the Marshalls were footing the entire bill. If word got out, it’d make Rose look desperate.  
  
""Rosewood Estate,"" Sam muttered. He’d picked the venue himself—a budget-friendly place with a classic touch.  
  
Houston frowned. ""Rosewood? That place is leftover colonial architecture from the last century. Only hosts budget weddings. Nothing special except the low price. Rose deserves better than that.""  
  
Sam and Linda lowered their heads, guilt setting in.  
  
Houston had just dragged Ethan’s name through the dirt, and his smug, cold gaze sparkled with calculated triumph.  
  
When Rose came out with the food, she found her parents looking defeated and Houston sitting there like he’d just won a war.  
  
She blinked in confusion. Her parents—usually iron-willed interrogators—had *lost* to the quiet Houston?  
  
Linda looked at the table and frowned. ""Rose, didn’t I tell you to make the seafood? How could you serve this to a guest?""  
  
Calling him a guest—there was distance in that word.  
  
Rose explained, ""Houston has severe stomach issues. He can’t handle rich food.""  
  
Linda fell quiet.  
  
Houston looked at the chicken noodle soup on the table—perfectly balanced for digestive support. The colorful vegetables, the careful seasoning—it was simple, but obviously prepared with thoughtful care.  
  
His heart warmed. He had only casually mentioned his stomach problems during a clinic visit, but Rose had remembered. She really was a gentle, thoughtful woman.  
  
He pulled out a chair and sat down naturally.  
  
When Rose joined him, she also sat beside him—just as naturally.  
  
Linda and Sam exchanged a glance. A silent question hung between them.  
  
""Rose, how do you know Houston has stomach problems?"" Linda asked, her voice laced with suspicion.  
  
Rose nearly choked. ""He… he’s one of my patients.""  
  
""You’re in psych, aren’t you? Since when does a psych doctor treat stomach problems?"" Linda pushed.  
  
Rose explained, ""A lot of psychiatric patients have gastrointestinal issues. It’s common.""  
  
Linda finally let it go, giving Houston a sympathetic look.  
  
""Don’t worry, Houston. My daughter might be young, but she’s very skilled. I’m sure she’ll cure you in no time."" She emphasized the doctor-patient relationship.  
  
Houston looked at Rose and nodded. ""I believe in her.""  
  
Dinner was tense. Sam and Linda kept circling back to the idea that Rose was marrying Ethan—not Houston. Meanwhile, Houston took every opportunity to throw shade at the so-called groom-to-be.  
  
When the meal was finally over, Rose exhaled heavily. While her parents washed the dishes, she leaned over to Houston and quietly said, ""Time for you to go.""  
  
Houston blinked. ""And what about you?""  
  
Rose whispered, ""You saw how hard they’re guarding me. There’s no way I’m getting out tonight.""  
  
""So when are you coming home?"" Houston frowned.  
  
She hesitated.  
  
He leaned in, lips brushing her ear, and murmured, ""Don’t forget, I’m a normal man. I didn’t marry you to sleep alone.""  
  
Her ears flushed red. Embarrassed, she nodded. ""I’ll come back soon.""  
  
Houston stood, turned to her parents, and said politely, ""Mr. Sam, Madam Linda, I’m heading out. Thank you for dinner.""  
  
Sam called out cheerfully, ""Take care now!""  
  
""I’ll walk him out,"" Rose added quickly.  
  
Her parents froze.  
  
Outside, the two of them walked side-by-side through the dim little path behind the complex.  
  
Suddenly, Houston stopped and held out his hand.  
  
Rose flinched. Physical intimacy always made her nervous. Even with Ethan, their relationship had been practically platonic in the beginning. The first time he tried to kiss her, she’d slapped him on reflex—left him stunned and sulking. Ever since then, Ethan never touched her without asking first.  
  
When she didn’t move, Houston just grabbed her hand and pulled it into his.  
  
They walked like that—quiet, hand-in-hand.  
  
Rose felt like she was someone’s pet, following obediently behind.  
  
At the parking lot, Houston turned and wrapped his arms around her narrow shoulders. His sharp eyes glowed with a rare softness.  
  
""Darling, let me hold you.""



**Chapter 6 Stirred by Love, Shameless Ex**



Houston held her tightly and murmured, ""If you don’t want to go public with us just yet, I’ll respect that. But in private… shouldn’t you at least call me ‘hubby’?""  
  
Rose blushed so hard her heart almost burst out of her chest.  
  
""I…"" she stammered, unable to finish.  
  
Houston looked down at her flustered face and couldn’t help but chuckle.  
  
He’d been surrounded by bold, flashy women for years—women who chased him without shame. But Rose’s soft, shy demeanor? That was something rare. Precious.  
  
He let her go without pressing. ""Don’t forget to think about me.""  
  
Rose nodded. ""Okay.""  
  
Houston gave her one last look, then got in the car and drove off.  
  
She stood there, palms still covering her burning cheeks, cursing herself. *Why didn’t I just call him hubby? He is my husband, after all!*  
  
Her three-day holiday was over. The next day, she returned to work.  
  
At the entrance of the psych department, she ran into her supervisor, Dr. Noel Carter, who was rushing toward the conference room but stopped when he spotted her.  
  
""Dr. Marshall,"" he said with a hint of hesitation, ""we’ve got a new PhD intern. Admin’s keeping a close eye on him. You know we’re short-staffed—if he performs well, they’re planning to offer him a permanent spot. I’d like you to mentor him.""  
  
Rose gave a calm nod. ""Sure.""  
  
She had an awkward status in the department—unmatched in both expertise and reputation, yet still just a regular attending physician. No overseas degree, no connections. Just pure skill. And yet, whenever a knowledge problem popped up, management always turned to her.  
  
Noel walked a few steps, then suddenly turned back. ""Oh, right—he’s twenty-nine, male, handsome, and brilliant. Honestly, we all think you’d make a good match. Ever consider not being single?""  
  
Rose froze. Back when she dated Ethan, he never once came to her workplace. No wonder Noel assumed she was single.  
  
""Dr. Carter, I’m engaged,"" she said, choosing her words carefully. She had no intention of explaining her surprise marriage.  
  
Noel blinked. ""Oh. I see."" He scratched his head, clearly embarrassed.  
  
Rose let out a quiet breath of relief.  
  
As Noel disappeared down the hallway, she turned toward her office—and stopped cold.  
  
There, standing in the dim corridor in a white coat, was Ethan.  
  
Tall and thin, he stared at her with a shadowed, unreadable expression.  
  
In a sudden flash of clarity, she realized—the intern Noel had mentioned… was him.  
  
Ethan’s low voice echoed through the empty hallway, tinged with anger. ""Rose, how could you just abandon my mom and sister at the hospital? You know they didn’t have the money to pay. Do you know how panicked they were?""  
  
She stood frozen, stunned.  
  
She wanted to walk past him and never look back. But her savings were still with him. That alone forced her to hold back the disgust and step closer.  
  
""Ethan, on what grounds do you think you get to scold me? I’m nothing to you anymore. Your mom’s medical bills? Why should they come out of my pocket?""  
  
Ethan hadn’t expected this. The Rose he used to know would’ve accepted it all without a fight. This version—fierce, calculating—threw him off.  
  
""Even if you were heartless enough to dump them, I still appreciate that you brought my mom in. I don’t like owing anyone favors. So… are you free tonight? Vivian and I want to treat you to dinner.""  
  
The sarcasm in his voice was thick.  
  
Rose rolled her eyes so hard she almost saw her brain. ""If you’ve got money for dinner, how about paying me back first?""  
  
Ethan’s tone turned sour. ""Why are you so obsessed with money now? We were together ten years—was it all just about money? Stop bringing it up every time you see me. I’ve started my internship. Once I get a salary, the first thing I’ll do is pay you back.""  
  
Rose snapped, ""What else *do* we have besides money?"" She stormed off, face dark.  
  
But Ethan called after her. ""Rose—""  
  
She paused, part of her still foolishly hoping for something.  
  
When she turned around, she instantly regretted it.  
  
""I’m serious about Vivian. We’re getting engaged soon. So I hope you understand—we’re never getting back together. Stop telling people I’m your fiancé. I don’t want Vivian getting the wrong idea.""  
  
Rose let out a sharp laugh.  
  
""Don’t flatter yourself. My fiancé has *nothing* to do with you.""  
  
A flicker of doubt crossed Ethan’s face. ""Don’t tell me… you’ve already found someone else? Rose, that’s not like you.""  
  
Ethan had always seen her as the loyal, devoted type. She was—right up until he betrayed her.  
  
She stared at him, heart twisted in bitterness. *This man knew how deeply she loved, and he still chose to betray her.*  
  
""You know what, Ethan? I f\*cking regret ever meeting you.""  
  
She walked off without looking back.  
  
During lunch break, Rose got held up treating a patient and missed the cafeteria hours. She planned to grab some cheap noodles outside—she hated noodles, but she just needed something in her stomach.  
  
But before she could leave, a stream of deliveries started arriving.  
  
One after another, delivery workers came into her office: roses, a warm lunch, gourmet fruit snacks for later. Her desk was quickly covered.  
  
The spectacle caught the attention of her coworkers—and Ethan, who happened to be nearby.  
  
""Dr. Marshall, your admirer sure went all out,"" someone teased.  
  
""Well, who can blame him? Dr. Marshall’s gorgeous, elegant, kind… guys would line up around Crestview just for a chance.""  
  
Ethan’s face darkened. The flowers were an eyesore.  
  
He’d never given Rose anything this extravagant. She wasn’t the flashy type—she’d always been serious, practical. She probably hated this kind of thing… right?  
  
But then he saw her pull out one of the cards.  
  
He didn’t know what it said, but for the first time in forever, he saw her smile. A real one—sweet, a little shy, radiant.  
  
He’d never seen Rose look like that. So soft. So beautiful.  
  
Then her colleague, Gisselle Young, snatched the card from her hand and read it aloud—

1l7vn2b,https://www.reddit.com/r/ParentalAlienation/comments/1l7vn2b/trying_something_new/,Trying something new.,"Reunification with my daughter (17) is going well. We had coffee this morning, and I got a full recap of the last fortnight in her world. She won't come to stay (there are some signs that she at least partly understands what is happening, she's scared her dad will kick her out if she does), but I get time with her now, every few weeks, and it's nice. We didn't do formal therapy, I just got a lucky break that my refusal to give up and my tendency to meet her hate with love managed to break through after two years. It's slow going, but at least my dutiful acceptance of the role of second fiddle keeps my ex off her case.

My son (13) still wants nothing to do with me, though, and he and his dad now attack in a pincer movement formation. I spoke to my son's school today, as I noticed increasing absences, and I just wanted to make sure he was okay. He's not, not really, but the school are working with him, so I am glad to hear that, and hold out hope that he'll get through the strife without too many scars. I'm not going away, but the approach to loving him has to be a lot more subtle, because he's the kind of kid who is easily radicalised. If I hang back, and pick my moments, his rational self has a chance of surviving this. If I try too hard, his dad will go harder. And at the end of the day, I'd rather my son never knew the sacrifices I made to make his adult life easier, than be right about his dad's behaviour and make waves that sink him forever.

Tonight I let all of the feelings out in one big, long story. My partner listened for an hour, and said almost nothing. When I was done, he put his arms around me. He asked if it felt better out than in, and when I said yes, but I'm conscious that I can't always offload on him, he said, 'Why not? I can clear my schedule like *that*'. I know we don't do a lot of this here, in this place where we show our figuratively bloodied arms and bruised faces, but I just want to say that I'm grateful to have a loving partner. It took a long time for this not to get a rise in him - no one wants to see the person they love beaten this way, and there are direct impacts on them as well - but he's kind of smashing it now. And it keeps me on an even keel. For those of us fortunate enough to have someone kind and loving in our lives, life is just a tiny bit easier. I am grateful.

No diagnosis, still undergoing medical investigations but all tests coming back ‘normal’ so beginning to think I may have ME/CFS. i trawled the main subreddit but found it all very sad, scary, and hopeless, which is not the info i want to surround myself with, so thought i would come on here for perhaps a more hopeful outlook? 

Background:
September 2023 started getting sick with colds/flu like symptoms every 3-4 weeks but was totally fine in between. I have had covid at least 3 times since 2020 but not sure if related and didn’t experience prolonged symptoms after infections. continued til May 2024 then was perfectly fine all summer til September 2024 where the periodic illnesses started again - this time every 2 weeks (immune tests all fine). December’24 & Jan’25 I felt perfectly healthy and fine. end of Jan I had a few drinks with some friends and next day developed heart palpitations which led me to have a bad panic attack. then ensued  2 weeks of the most dysregulated i’ve ever felt — constantly anxious to the point where sometimes i would be gurning like i was on some kind of stimulant, extreme nausea and vertigo, couldn’t sit still, frequent panic attacks. I managed to calm myself down and then I got ill, usual winter cold symptoms, not too severe and not covid. Recovered then a week later (roughly mid Feb’25) I was hit with a wave of fatigue & other symptoms that have basically never left.

Symptoms mainly bad fatigue, constant head & facial pressure and pain, sore throat most mornings on waking, general foggy feeling like my head is enveloped in a cloud, continued and worsened palpitations, massive increase in heart rate from minor activity (but doesn’t seem to be postural so prob not POTS?), malaise, almost constant stuffy nose without actual congestion, shortness of breath sometimes so bad that it feels like i am getting no air in (tho i defo am, oxygen levels totally fine), muscle & eye twitching, temperature dysregulation. 

I would have random 1 or 2 days in a row where I felt totally fine, and after a bad flare in march I even went on a climbing holiday in Spain for a week and felt completely normal - zero symptoms, which only returned when I got back to the UK, and for at least a month they weren’t any worse than they had been before the trip - if anything they were better. but since then i’ve not really had any good days and it feels like it’s only getting worse.

I was still managing to go to uni, my capacity was a lot less but still did like 4-5 hours in the library quite a few days of the week and managed it alright, sometimes doing chill activities and walks on the weekend. didn’t crash or anything it was just a consistent rough feeling. then just over a week ago i crashed big time and spent the last week totally housebound. fatigue like i’d never experienced it before, unable to cook for myself and barely able to get up and down the stairs. ended up in the emergency room for the worst palpitations i’ve ever had but strangely enough had the energy to navigate the emergency room just fine and felt i had more ‘energy’ (i use that lightly, still felt exhausted) than i’d had in days. since then i felt a bit better - left the house to go for a (decaf) coffee with a friend and didn’t crash in the evening. managed to do the same yesterday but by 3pm i was in bed feeling horrific, like every cell in my body was nauseous, and had to remain there for the rest of the day. this morning i feel a bit better, but still fatigued, headache, fog ect. as usual. guessing that could have been PEM but never really experienced that before as my symptoms have always been pretty consistent , and gradually worsened by the end of the day. sometimes i’d even have 2 or 3 hours in the morning of feeling totally fine before symptoms coming on out of nowhere. 

i have had so so many blood tests, a chest x-ray and ECG and all are normal. 

bit confused . does this resonate with y’all? does it sound like me/cfs?

if so — pls give me advice that you would have wanted to hear early on in your journey. I want to remain hopeful and orient myself towards recovery from the offset because right now I feel so scared and like my life is ending when it’s only just begun (just finished my bachelors after a tough few years, and have been really excited for life to come but now…). 

so tips for not getting worse/ managing emotionally & physically / getting better ? I appreciate its not straight forward ❤️ much love to all",4,1749552586.0,cfsrecovery,1,1.0,False

I can't understand why so many people say traditional braces are more problematic - you need to clean and floss your teeth after each meal even with aligners. Living a social life is a challenge too - drinking any beverage like coffee, tea, wine, or beer, going out to restaurants, the cinema, or even cycling when you can't drink isotonic drinks or eat a banana.

Literally, even walking and having an ice cream or grabbing sparkling water in the park requires you to stop, wash your hands, remove the aligners, and repeat the same process after you've finished eating. I have the feeling that everything I do now revolves around the aligners, while they were supposed to make my life easier - at least that's how I understood it.

I haven't had braces but I think with them I wouldn't have to bother at all. I'd wear them all the time, and it would always be easy to rinse with water if I can't brush my teeth properly at the moment.

I hope I'll get used to it, but it seems super annoying for now.

Giving My Innocence to My Stepfather
💋😍🔥🔞I was in such a rush to give away my V-card.
But I never imagined it would be… to the man who had raised me.
“You’re so tight…” he moaned, voice low.
Yet—his voice—felt oddly familiar.
Finally, he gave a final thrust, his behind grinding to a halt. Then he reached over and flicked on the light.
We both froze.
“Leah?” His voice cracked.
My heart dropped.
Chapter 1
My stepfather clicked off the television and turned to look at me. As always, when his piercing blue eyes fell on mine, I couldn’t help but shudder with excitement. John, my stepfather, smiled and spread his hands out in a helpless shrug.
“Weatherman says it’s going to stay cruddy like this until tomorrow morning. The state has put a warning out not to go out on the roads.
Supposed to be the storm of the century. Looks like we’re hunkering down tonight. Just you and me, kiddo.”
“That’s okay, Daddy. I’ve got some mac and cheese we can eat for dinner.”
My stepfather laughed and walked over to me. He wrapped his arms around me and squeezed me into him and I nuzzled my head into his chest, breathing in deep and enjoying his musk and the warmth of his body against mine.
He released me and held me out in front of him. I was wearing a pair of tight jean shorts and a white tank top and I noticed his eyes travel down and linger on my cleavage for a moment. I smiled sweetly up at him. He cleared his throat and met my gaze.
“So, honey,” he said, “what do you think of your new place?”
I looked around at my new apartment, not quite believing that I was finally on my own. After eighteen years of living at home, having my own space in a new town was an odd feeling. Mostly I missed the idea of being away from my stepfather. I could tell from the way he had been acting all weekend as we settled me in that he was feeling the same thing. He had been reluctant to see me off to college, and though he hadn’t said anything about it, his voice had had a wistful quality to it since we’d left the house the day before with a trailer full of my stuff.
“I love it, Daddy. Though I’m a little nervous to start college.” My father smiled.
“You are going to have such a good time, sweetie. College is one of the best times of life. Just be sure to study hard, but also make room for fun. Oh,
and be careful about the boys.” “Dad!”
“I’m serious,” he said, grinning. “You are going to meet a lot of them, and being the beautiful woman you are, they are going to want to do things to you. Just make sure you only do what you’re comfortable with and make sure to use protection.”
“Daddy!” I repeated. “Everything is going to be okay. I’m not interested in those types of boys anyway.”
“That’s what you say now. But I still need to warn you. Even though I’m sure you are already sexually active, it makes me feel better as a father to warn you—“
“I’m not sexually active,” I interjected.
“You’re not?” From his eagerness, I could tell that he was pleased by the news.
“No, Daddy,” I cooed, sidling up to him and wrapping my arms around his large frame, “I’m not. I’m saving myself for someone special. I don’t want to just give myself away to anyone, you know?”
My father bent down and kissed the top of my head, some strands of my curly brown hair sticking to his stubble as he straightened back up and squeezed me tight.
“Good for you, honey. I know the man that you finally give yourself is going to be very lucky. Even though I’m your father, I have no problem telling you that you are absolutely beautiful.”
“Thanks, Daddy.”
“I love you, sweetheart.” “I love you, too.”
“Now,” my father said, pushing me away from him once more. “What’s say we build that new coffee table of yours before the lights go out and we drown?”",1,1749552401.0,Hot_Romance_Stories,0,1.0,False

(i will not promote).,"I got an intro with a well known VC last week. The meeting generally went well, but I can’t determine if they were just being nice or actually think my idea has potential. 

The meeting was scheduled for 30 minutes and they gave me an hour. The TLDR of it was that they think I need to find a technical co-founder and also try to build a scrappy v1 once I do. I’m not technical, more growth/GTM and clinical operations. 

They actually connected me with a technical founder that they backed in the past that lives near me. I agreed to get coffee with the guy, but didn’t get a ton of other context. Not sure if they’re saying this guy would be a good co-founder or if maybe he can possibly help me find someone locally to work with. 

Any way, I followed up right after the meeting thanking them for the connection and for the time. They followed up right away, making it sound like they’re excited to reconnect in a few weeks, although nothing hard set in stone.

This is my first interaction with a VC other than via email. Can anyone help me interpret how this meeting actually went?

I’m at the point where I need to decide if I just stop now or if I actually try to find a co-founder and build this. I have 2 kids under 2 and work full time, so working on this will likely cut into one of those two things. I know the company is a good idea and if I don’t start it someone else will- I just also don’t want to look back in a few weeks and have lost my full time job because this is detracting my focus.

There’s a starbucks on a military base that I have access to. it’s smaller, with no drive through or mobile ordering. I’m home for college for about 2 1/2 months, and they seem like they really need people, so I was thinking about applying.

However, i’ve never worked in any coffee shop ever. I’ve worked at a smoothie place, but nothing with coffee so i’d be a complete newbie. there are also 2 weeks (one during June and the other in july) where I have something else planned and wouldn’t be able to work.

I know training new people can be a bit of a nuisance, especially when it’s busy. In your experience, should I apply? or would it be more of an inconvenience?

Some of us get here 30 min early so we can be first in line so we're able to clock in first. For context, if you're more towards the back of the line, you'll end up clocking in late. So those of us that get here early will usually set our cups/ coffee in the line to mark our spots and then go sit in the break room to wait to clock in. Me personally, I usually put my coffee in line (I'm always 2nd in line) I set my coffee down, go to the bathroom, then get back in line.

Well this new guy started recently and he just wants to skip the whole line every time and this morning I've had it. He had gotten better about it so I thought someone had explained to him how the lined worked. But this morning when I came out of the bathroom he was standing in front of my spot. I figured this was fine for now as he was just talking to the girl in front of me and would move when it was time to clock in. 

But he did not. He did that thing where he stayed real close to the person in front of him to make it a point that he was next. So I tapped him on the shoulder and told him I was next, before him. He looked real angry, shook his head no and mumbled something that sounded like ""no tf you weren't"". I said, ""yes, I was. I got here 30 min early. How are you gonna try to jump in front of me?""

There was even 2 or 3 other people telling him that I was in line before him and he still wouldn't move. The person who was first in line let me go before her so I was able to technically clock in before him but damn. I need advice on how to deal with this. If this had been the first time he'd done this I would've let it slide. Like I did the first time, when he cut in front of 25+ people.

But if this happens again, especially after today, I know my attitude will get the best of me and I'll end up saying something real rude like ""learn your place, new guy. You don't get to come in here just doing whatever you want and pushing people out of the way.""

I can be petty if I have the energy for it. I'll get here an hour early and I'll make a big ass sign that says ""OP is here!"" 😅😅",1,1749552205.0,Advice,4,1.0,False

It’s contagious, magnetic, and sometimes, even more powerful than a lengthy introduction. But what if your own smile is something you often hide in photos or behind your hand during a laugh?

https://preview.redd.it/7pnktqlcw26f1.png?width=800&format=png&auto=webp&s=c6fc045c2ca50dab0c50d8ba4ae588967d535962

In a place like RMV 2nd Stage, where brunch scenes at local cafés and spontaneous laughter over neer dosa and filter coffee are common, not feeling good about your smile can quietly take a toll. That’s where smile makeover treatment steps in, not just as a cosmetic upgrade, but as a life-changer. 

# What Exactly Is a Smile Makeover?

A smile makeover is not the same for everybody. It’s a customised combination of dental procedures designed to enhance the appearance of your teeth, gums, and smile. Whether you’re dealing with discolouration, chipped teeth, uneven gums, or all of it together, a smile makeover covers everything under one roof.

It’s like the difference between just ironing your shirt and getting a full outfit tailored; you feel different, and it shows.

# Common Concerns a Smile Makeover Can Address

Many people from all walks of life consider a smile makeover for a variety of reasons:

* Stained or yellow teeth
* Gaps between teeth
* Crooked or misaligned teeth
* Worn-down or chipped teeth
* Uneven gum lines
* Missing teeth

And let’s be honest, when you’re at a friend’s wedding near Sankey Tank or speaking in a client meeting at Hebbal, the last thing you want is to be worrying about how your teeth look in those candid camera clicks.

# What’s Included in a Smile Makeover?

Think of a smile makeover as a customised thali at your favourite Andhra mess, you only get the dishes you need, and it’s all made to suit your taste (or in this case, smile goals).

Here are some procedures often included:

# 1. Teeth Whitening

For those who’ve battled years of coffee stains from darshini-style filter coffee near BEL Road.

# 2. Veneers

These wafer-thin covers can correct chips, gaps, and discoloration, giving you a uniform, picture-perfect smile.

# 3. Crowns

Ideal for damaged or weak teeth, they restore both function and aesthetics.

# 4. Orthodontic Treatments

Clear aligners or [**braces**](https://smylexl.com/braces-treatment-in-rmv-bengaluru) to straighten teeth without turning your smile into a construction site.

# 5. Gum Contouring

Fixes uneven or excessive gum visibility, because nobody wants their gums to photobomb their teeth.

# 6. Dental Implants or Bridges

If you’ve lost a tooth (or a few), these can bring back your full smile and bite power, no more chewing only on one side while pretending you’re okay.

# Why It’s Not Just About Looks

A quote by Phyllis Diller says, “A smile is a curve that sets everything straight.” And that couldn’t be more true. A confident smile doesn’t just change how others see you, it changes how *you* see yourself.

# The Journey of Smile Makeover Treatment

The process usually begins with a detailed consultation. Your dentist will assess your smile, understand your concerns, and plan the treatments required. It’s all done step-by-step to match your goals, schedule, and comfort.

The beauty of opting for a smile makeover treatment in RMV 2nd Stage is the accessibility. You don’t need to travel far or wait endlessly. Everything from consultation to follow-up can be comfortably managed locally, and yes, you’ll still have time to grab your favourite dosa at CTR.

# A Quick Recap Worth Smiling About

From tackling stained, crooked, or [**missing teeth**](https://smylexl.com/missing-teeth-types-and-effective-treatment-solutions/) to boosting confidence before a big presentation or celebration, a smile makeover addresses more than just dental flaws. It combines multiple treatments into a personalised plan that suits your needs, lifestyle, and aspirations. And when you do it right, it doesn’t just transform your smile, it reshapes your self-image.

i want to tell you how it all happened, starting from when everything was quiet. my younger brother, who is 21, had serious health problems for as long as i can remember. three months before his surgery, he left college and came back home. he spent his days in his room, saying only a few words when he needed food or coffee, and then going back to sleep. he got no calls, no messages from his friends, he simply spent the whole day in silence. we used to try to speak with him, but he kept quiet. we thought he might be having a mental breakdown because of his health struggles 
then came the day of his surgery. we were all nervous, not knowing what to expect. after one month of recovery, something changed. the doctors had told him to walk for at least one hour each day, and he did. he started cooking simple meals for himself, sitting with us, and even joining in our gossip. overall, he began to feel happy. he still spent most of his time in his room, but now there was a spark in his eyes that wasn’t there before, two months after surgery, his phone buzzed with messages from a girl. i found out by mistake because his phone was unlocked. i felt guilty reading his chats, but at first it was just simple texts like “how are you?” or “i am okay.” nothing serious. i wondered who she was, but didn’t focus too much on that, as weeks went by, their messages grew longer. soon they moved from texting to voice calls and video chats. around three months after his surgery, he began walking to the park near our colony to speak with her for close to an hour. he said the internet at home was slow, and the park gave him better reception. watching him leave just to talk on video felt strange. our family is conservative, and he had not introduced her. the only way he could call or video-chat her was by going outside.

now they were in a relationship, and i don’t know why, but it feels so weird and funny to me.

i decided to look her up online. she was studying at a top college in delhi, and she was beautiful, involved in campus life. here was my brother who had dropped out of college, was still recovering, and did not have a job. it felt odd that she would spend so much time talking to him. her campus offered so many options then why was she with him? he could not meet her in person or travel alone to her place for at least two years, because of his health and financial situation. he couldn’t even take her out to dinner (he wasn’t allowed outside food or snacks.) why were they doing this? my mind couldn’t comprehend what kind of relationship this was, with no clear future. they were both around 21 (she in her third year of college) probably the same age as him
so why were they both acting like this?

i have so many questions. does she really care about him, or is she just seeking attention? she could easily find someone on campus, so why was she drawn to my brother? did he lie to her about his academics and health?

I've never been to this sub and I don't think I'll ever come back (except for my post).
I'm a 22-year-old male truck driver. I'm a rather solitary person and I have trouble meeting new people. But recently, I met a girl (20 years old) with whom I played a lot when I was little. When we were little (until we were 14), we saw each other regularly and were inseparable. Our parents actually said we were a couple. Which I didn't think, for me, she was one of my best friends. And around the age of 15, I didn't see her again until I was 21. While we didn't see each other again, I had a girlfriend who made me sick (depressed) to the point where I was afraid to go out with a girl. But recently, I got my fingers out of my ass and decided to try to get back into a relationship.  So recently we talked again, we had coffee, and we talked about the world.
At the end of our coffee, I felt weird, almost as if I'd fallen in love with her, or at least she hadn't left me indifferent. Later, I sent her a message and confessed how I felt (I didn't feel embarrassed saying it since we've known each other forever).
I told her I liked her and that if she wanted, we could continue seeing each other and ""flirting."" She replied that she wasn't against it, but that she didn't know if she'd want to go out with me afterward.
I told myself that nothing ventured, nothing gained, and I chatted about everything and nothing, and we tried to set up a date to see each other again.  But nothing was done, we almost forgot each other... And today we saw each other again, and strangely, I had that feeling again. We didn't talk much, but I still had this feeling of being in love with her.
And the problem is, I don't know if she feels that way too. I don't want to break off this newly rekindled friendship, but at the same time, I don't want to continue like this, doing nothing.
Anyway, help me, give me advice, or simply your point of view.
Thank you so much to those who respond seriously.

1l7vc6v,https://www.reddit.com/r/Hyperhidrosis/comments/1l7vc6v/find_a_way_to_manage_not_a_solution/,"Find a way to manage, NOT a solution","M23. First time poster on this subreddit (I created an account just to make this post). I thought I'd finally contribute to this awesome community and try help make a difference ❤️

Sorry in advance for the long post. But this is years worth of my thoughts, feelings and experience put into words.

TL;DR: this is what I would tell my younger self: The method is very simple. Accept this condition as part of your life, learn to MANAGE (not “solve”) by finding a suitable/effective treatment, and take control over your HH, DO NOT let it take control over you!

History

I first developed hyperhidrosis when I was around 15 in High School. Life was suddenly different when I noticed my armpits drenched doing nothing while the aircon was on. Also, it was the first time I noticed my hands and feet sweating?! It only got worse - to the point where my my pit stains would cover the ENTIRE length of my t-shirt. I was too embarrassed to shake hands with anyone, and I lived in socks and black clothes.

For context, I live in Australia so most people are generally hot/sweaty during summer. But I knew it wasn't normal when winter came around and I was still DRIPPING sweat from my hands, feet and armpits when it was 15 degrees.

I was an extreme extrovert as a kid/teenager. Safe to say (like many of you probably) this condition took advantage of me in all social situations, and I quickly became reserved/introverted. Life wasn't the same and my mental health was plummeting (as if being a teenager/young adult wasn't already hard enough!!!).

It is my STRONG recommendation (especially if you have severe symptoms, like me) that you pursue treatment. I say this subjectively, as it has dramatically increased my quality of life (I can wear any colour clothes, shake hands confidently etc.). I do not really agree with those posts that say “hey man, don’t let it hold you back, go live your life”. That’s because even if it wasn’t socially embarrassing and anxiety inducing, it’s also damn inconvenient! My hands used to sweat so bad that I couldn’t text on my phone because my fingertips were so wet. So yes, I do feel seeking treatment is very worthwhile.

If treatment isn’t an option for whatever reason (money, time, accessibility etc.), please just do as many things to minimise sweating as you can (reduce caffeine intake, eat clean, get plenty of sleep, workout etc.).

Treatment

DISCLAIMER: I will set out only the treatment I’ve tried before, there are other options out there. Regardless, go seek a professionals diagnosis from a GP/Dermatologist if you haven’t already. That is ALWAYS the first step (especially since excessive sweating can sometimes be caused by all types of other conditions).

Glycopyrrolate
Glyco was the first treatment I tried around age 19, prescribed by my dermatologist. There are already plenty of posts explaining how it works, but I want to share some advice you might not hear as often. While Glyco can be effective, keep in mind it’s a systemic medication, meaning it reduces sweat across your whole body, not just specific areas like your hands, feet, or underarms. You’ll likely feel “dry” all over, which can come with side effects like dry mouth, dry eyes, and constipation. If you have generalized hyperhidrosis, Glyco might be a solid option. But if you’re like me, and your sweating is limited to the hands, feet, and underarms, it won’t necessarily fix those areas. When taking Glycco, I would still sweat from them, especially when hot or nervous. Probably around 50% of my usual sweating on hands, feet and underarms, even while the rest of my body stayed completely dry. One thing I don’t see mentioned enough is the risk of overheating. I run, lift, and do a lot of sport. Glyco worked so well on my body that I’d barely sweat during intense workouts except from those small areas (hands, feet), which isn’t enough to properly cool you down. So if you’re using Glyco, please make sure your dosage is balanced. Sweating during exercise is both normal and necessary.

Also note that Glycco is very much a way of life. For most, you'll have to take it on an empty stomach and won't be able to eat breakfast. Some people even find that is loses efficiency with hot meals/drinks. You'll always need gum, water, mints around to ensure your mouth is kept wet (note: dry mouth = bad breath). These are all manageable side effects which I was able to put up with for about 2 years. But I was still a little unhappy due to my hand, feet and underarm sweat being somewhat unresolved.

2. Iontophoresis

I bought a machine from DermaDry. Again, there are various posts about this device so please go consult them for more detail. I will say that this machine didn’t work for me (at all). It is designed to target the underarms, feet and hands so I was very excited to try it given the “shortcomings” I experienced using Glyco. But between the significant time commitment, and limited effectiveness for me personally, I decided to discontinue. P.S. A lot of people have success with this treatment so don’t write it off!

3. Antihydral and Driclor

Same as above, please just search these products in the sub to find out more detail. What I will say, is that these are very simple products. I use driclor for my underarms every second day on average. From the outset I was entirely convinced this would not work for me (given none of the ""strong"" antiperspirants from the supermarkets did). It’s a basic roll-on deodorant I buy from Amazon but it's changed my life. I would say it cuts my underarm sweat by about 90% (i.e. sweat exactly like any other person - no sweating when cold, or aircon, and minimal sweat when hot/nervous/exercise). I would probably get 100% effectiveness if I used it everyday. However, like everything, moderation is key!

Antihydral is really strong and effective. I use this on my hands & feet about every 5-6 days on average (closer to every 3-4 days during summer). Just apply overnight and wash off in the morning - so simple! But like everything, this comes with its side effects. The antihydral is so strong that it will dry up your hands. Another weird side effect is that your hands will prune quickly underwater. To manage the dryness I moderate my applications, and use some lotion (I know, sounds hilarious!). To be clear, the antihydral is also imperfect. If I miss a spot when applying, then I will sweat from that spot specifically. However, you will quickly get used to how to apply this (i.e. which areas of your hands/feet sweat more, and require more cream).

Conclusion (pls read)

I have struggled REALLY badly with my mental health at times because of this condition. Last year, for the first time ever, I completely broke down and cried in front of my parents bc I was so overwhelmed by the “control” this condition had on my life (i.e. always wearing black clothes, not being able to eat breakfast when I was taking glyco, stopping coffee - which was damn hard as a lawyer!). I felt like I was so “different” to everyone, and that they would never understand my struggle.

Now that I’ve mature past my teens, it becomes glaringly obvious that EVERYONE (yes, everyone) has their own insecurities and conditions - no matter how small or large. Some people are balding, some are born with out limbs, some have severe mental disabilities, some are blind, some have severe acne, and WE have hyperhidrosis. Putting things in perspective goes a long way…

So, there is a very clear message I want to send. If you have been diagnosed with hyperhidrosis, accept you have a condition, and learn to MANAGE. Do NOT attempt to “solve” this condition in its entirety. If you try to solve it (i.e. come up with a perfect solution/answer) you will ultimately fall short, and it will lead to more unhappiness. At the current state of science, there is no perfect or permanent solution, and every treatment will have its own shortfalls and side effects. Through some trial and error, you will find a treatment that works for you.

57.	



As you have observed, Willa spends a good deal of his time in front of mirrors, checking his dress, makeup, and hair. 

On this occasion, he is paying more attention to his appearance than ever before.

His shredded nerves are made worse by Mr Hunter banging on the dressing room door.

“Come on, sissy, hurry it up!”

“Yes, Sir. Coming Sir. Just a moment.” He then adds a plaintive, “Please!”

Willa’s problem is his chastity cage. As tiny as his wife’s lover has chosen for him, Willa fears it will peek through the delightful bunny girl outfit Mr Hunter has had him wear for the first photo shoot.

 No matter how he twists, he cannot see any signs of a bulge, helped not only by the tiny steel cage but also by the breathless constriction of the bunny girl costume. In addition to spandex, the outfit is built around a merry widow corset, tightening the waist to impossibly small dimensions. 

Obviously, the figure forming and shaping tights aid the silhouette appearance, moulding his hips and thighs nicely.

Oh my God! If his wife, Avery, could see him now. How they would giggle at the floppy bunny ears and collar. But they would both be impressed with the enhancement of Willa’s figure. Oh, and the firm white collar with bow and the matching wrist cuffs is so amusing! 

The heels make his legs seem crazily long, helped by the high cut of the bunny girl garb.

He wants to rub between his thighs, but is fearful that he might spurt through his chastity cage and create a mess on the groin of the uniform.

“Sissy!” More banging on the door.

Oh, why are men so impatient? Confidence feeds his self-assurance from how he knows he looks. 

So, Willa finally opens the door, desperate to see Mr Hunter’s reaction.

She can immediately see what he thinks. His long, haggard face opens up, as if his eyes need to be wide to take in the vision before him.

“Fuck me,” he says.

Willa giggles before pirouetting around to shake his fluffy tail at the lusty male.

Mr Hunter’s long hand grips Willa’s face, shocking the sissy into remaining perfectly still.

“If you were a real girl …”

Willa waits with his mouth hanging open for Mr Hunter to finish his sentence.

But the masculine male merely shakes his head and wanders back into his studio to turn on the lighting.

“Come on, sissy, get your arse moving!”

Willa giggles as he clip-clops as quickly as his heels will allow into the space below Mr Hunter’s home. It has been turned into a neat professional photographic studio stuffed full of props, like a small movie studio.

Lifting up the camera and stand, Mr Hunter marches to one corner where the set consists of a simple bar, before a large picture of bottles on shelves.

“Get your cute tail in front of the bar and pick up the tray.”

Willa does so with a big grin on his pink lipsticked mouth. 

Oh, this is so much fun!

“Now hold the tray, like a bunny girl. No, dumb bitch, get your hand underneath it.”

“Sorry, Sir,” Willa laughs, obeying his instructions.

Willa is put through a variety of poses and stands. He has to turn this way and that, smile, and appear sultry, cock one knee in front of the other, else keep apart her black, panty hosed legs.

It is when bending over and shaking his ‘tail’, as Mr Hunter describes it, that he notices the photographer speaking more slowly. Gone are the rapid-fire directions. They are replaced with deep intakes of breath each time Willa poses.

Mr Hunter seems to analyse every inch of his model’s body like a scientist studying a specimen.

The tall man moves the camera aside and clicks his fingers towards the floor before him.

“On your knees, bitch.”

Odd, Willa thinks, that he is being given a pose when the camera is pointing elsewhere.

From his knees, Willa stares up with an eager to please smile, feeling the cute ears flap as he moves.

“Open your mouth, tramp.”

“Yes, Sir.” 

Willa obeys, her eyes wide with interest at where these instructions are heading.

It is then that Mr Hunter grapples at the top of his jeans, impatiently pulling them open and unzipping his fly.

“Oh!”

Mr Hunter’s thick, long veiny penis is already bustlingly erect, and pointing at Willa’s bunny ears.

Wow! Do all real men have huge cocks?

The photographer has to push down his manhood to guide it into the shocked sissy’s pretty open mouth.

Willa tries to repeat his ‘oh’, but he is quickly gagged by the dick pushing across his tongue until it touches his throat.

No! 

Willa chokes and pulls back his head with closed eyes. He places his hands on the photographer’s hips, keeping him at a short distance.

Pulling his wet cock from the succulent mouth of the sissy, Mr Hunter steps over to the police jail set, returning briskly with a set of steel handcuffs shimmering under the intense studio lights.

Settling back on his heels, Willa watches these events passively, accepting whatever is happening.

In seconds, Willa’s hands are cuffed resolutely behind his back, so his fingers can rest against his fluffy white tail.

With his dick still out, though not quite so firm. Mr Hunter picks up a camera and clicks pictures of the erotic sight at his feet.

“You are something else,” the man growls.

An aroused Willa manages to say breathlessly, “Thank you, Sir.”

After a few shots crouched down around the bunny girl, Mr Hunter rises and rams his cock into the sissy’s mouth with such force that he has to use his free hand to grip the blonde hair of the dumb bitch and hold the sissy in place.

Glaring, gasping panic from Willa as his mouth is filled, and he cannot retract his head.

The thick dick pushes over Willa’s tongue hitting the back of his throat, making him retch. When he tries to pull back his head, Mr Hunter twists his hair to force his mouth further forward.

Willa, looking up with helpless, round eyes at the man holding the camera. A sight that makes the already aroused Mr Hunter need to fuck the mouth with all his energy.

He rams his cock into the little mouth a few more times, before removing it and pointing it as a weapon at the dazed sissy.

The chunky, long dick twitches before sending an avalanche of gooey sperm streaming over the face of Willa, who immediately closes his eyes and tries to wriggle away.

Mr Hunter keeps Willa in place easily by twisting the sissy’s hair even more cruelly.

The vision of the bunny girl squirming helplessly, with the ears flapping and the tail on the cute bottom wriggling, makes Mr Hunter more aggressive and lustier than he has ever felt before.

After an age, the spray slows. Mr Hunter jerks a few more times before breathlessly saying, “Clean it up, Sissy.”

Willa manages a hoarse, “Yes, Sir,” before the cock presses resolutely between his pink lips. His tongue laps at the mess on the cock, greedily wanting every drop.

After the violent previous minute, this has more of the sexual satisfaction experienced by Willa than when he sucks his Master’s vibrator in the privacy of his bedroom. There is something comforting about slurping at Mr Hunter’s softening cock. As if it is a pleasant reward. It is more satisfying than his Master’s plastic vibrator.

If he were lying in a bed right now, Willa would twist over and suck the cock while rubbing his caged dick against some raised pillows.

Hearing the sissy's happy murmuring, Mr Hunter releases his grip on his blonde hair and strokes the head gently, like an adoring pet.

“Clever girl. Good girl.”

Oh my. Those words, ‘good girl’! Will Willa ever get used to hearing them without cumming in his little chastity cage?

Mr Hunter sits on a chair, still stroking the sissy’s hair.

“You are something else,” he mumbles to himself.

Willa says, “Thank you Sir,” before licking around the tip of the photographer’s cock.

Mr Hunter takes a few more shots of the ejaculate covered, cute sissy before saying, “If I had my way, I’d keep you like this forever.”

Willa giggles, “Aw. Thank you, Sir.”

“Bunny girl outfit. Hands cuffed. Covered in my juices! Marked as mine.”

Willa is so used to being held in bondage that he has completely forgotten he is helplessly cuffed. He looks up at the self-satisfied man, slumped in the chair with his camera, with a smile.

“Well, it’s a shame,” Mr Hunter says, “but I guess, I need to release you and have you clean up your face for the next shots.”

Only a fifteen minute drive away, Willa’s wife, Avery, is also on her knees. She is naked in her bedroom, staring up at her Adonis-like lover. 

Her eyes, too, fall to the waving cock, like an animal hypnotised by a cobra’s sway.

And she too waits patiently to be told she can do what she desperately yearns to do: suck her man’s cock.

Her Master teases her. Makes her wait.

“Who owns you bitch?”

“You do, Sir.”

“I own every fucking inch of you and that dumb sissy husband of yours. Got it?”

Her eyes close, and she emits an animalistic growl. 

“Suck it, bitch!”

With eyes half closed, Avery leans forward in slow motion to alight on her treat.

With the same satisfaction that her sissy hubby felt she feels the cock fill her mouth. It is so right. 

With a feral groan she starts sucking on it, feeling it grow harder and bigger in her soft mouth.

Unlike her hubbie, she is very experienced at sucking the cock of her man and lovingly slurps it deeper and deeper. This was a skill Marvin most wanted to develop in his slut. She uses her fingers to rub the cock to greater action, revelling in the aggression of her man.

When he cums, Avery tries to swallow what she can of his seed but ends up dribbling out a great deal of his wonderful juices.

It is as if nature is bringing the hot wife and her sissy hubbie closer and closer together. Like two railway tracks now running in parallel.

Both are under the firm hand of the wife’s powerful lover.

They will have so much to gossip about tomorrow.

But that will be after Willa’s excruciating introduction as an obedient maid to his own close friends and neighbours, Frank and Jenny. 



















58.	





No one pouts like a put-upon maid who thinks life is unfair.

Being totally helpless to remedy any problems and not even permitted to speak, a poor maid has to stand in the kitchen serving his wife and her lover their breakfast and try to use telepathy to indicate he is unhappy.

Finally, Avery puts down her morning coffee cup and says to her lover, “Sir, perhaps the maid should be allowed to see some of the pictures Jackson took of her?”

Marvin grins at the way his slut and her kids automatically refer to the cuck hubbie with feminine pronouns. 

“Dunno,” he grunts. “Maybe.” He stares hard at the maid, making him blush and stare at the floor. “Maybe the ones of her as a schoolgirl? Those in the lingerie are hilarious.”

Avery grins, “I love her in the bunny girl outfit. That one of her bent over. Just wow!”

Of course, Willa wants to see those, but he is also fearful that Mr Hunter shared the more embarrassing pictures of him. Like the ones of him sucking his cock or facially drenched in Mr Hunter’s semen. And, oh God, the video of him looking straight into the lens as Mr Hunter took him so aggressively, all the while spanking Willa’s backside and making him say demeaning words into the camera.

Marvin laughs, with that ugly laugh that Willa so much detests. “And one of her was a dumb bride, with a veil but no dress. Just the corset, stockings and shoes!”

Aw! Willa fumes. He loved that one. He even gave Mr Hunter a kiss on the cheek when he saw the first images of him as a bride in lingerie.

But of course, Willa is not permitted to be part of the conversation, so he can do no more than inwardly fume.

Marvin rises from his seat, pulling back his awesome shoulders. 

“We'd better make a move to your neighbours. Pick up the girls.”

Avery immediately fusses about her maid, flicking at his hair and studying his makeup.

“Oh, Jenny can be such a bitch, Willa. We need to make sure you look perfect. I don’t want her finding fault with the appearance of my maid.”

“Erm, Mistress, I don’t think we should be …”

Avery isn’t listening. She takes a step back to study her maid from her heels to her hair. 

“You need to change your apron. Get out a neat fresh one. A nicely ironed one. Oh, and make sure you brush your hair.”

How Willa hates having his wife’s Bull in the same room. He knows he is always seconds from a severe punishment. So he must be doubly careful about speaking.

“Mistress. I can’t help feeling that you don’t want me wandering into Jenny’s house with me in a maid’s uniform. Especially with this ridiculous frilly apron!”

His wife purses her lips and raises her eyebrows, making her maid nibble his pink lips with trepidation.

“Maid!” Avery says firmly, “You will be on display for them. I want no nonsense or silliness from you. Got it?”

Marvin glares at the nervous maid. “You listen to your Mistress. You will walk behind us to their house …”

“Walk?” Willa shouts. “But Master. I can’t walk along the streets dressed like this …”

Too late, Willa pushes her pumped-up lips tightly shut.

Marvin says, “We’ll forget your maintenance spanking with the paddle this morning.”

A relieved Willa says, “Oh, thank you, Master. Thank you.”

Marvin grins, studying his maid’s reaction as he says, “In view of you talking back, we will make it six stripes of my belt.”

“B-b-but, Master, I really …”

Avery shakes her head. “Really, maid! You know how to get yourself into trouble. I trust you are not going to embarrass me in front of Jenny and Frank.”

Oh God! Jenny and Frank, his neighbours!

Jenny has always been one of those bullies of a woman who teased Willa even when he was William. He knows she will be in her element, terrorising him as a maid.

But worse, her husband Frank is a real man. He is one of those macho, sports-watching, beer-drinking men who is great fun to be with but will be a nightmare for poor Willa in his present station.

Willa feels sick and just wants it all to stop.

“Mistress. I’m really sorry, but I just can’t do this,” Willa sniffs.

Moving the kitchen chair to the middle of the room, Marvin settles his bulk on it and pats his thighs. “Over my lap, girl.”

By the time he rises, pulling up his panties over his scored bottom, Willa knows that his Master has gone easy on him with the belt. Just six stinging welts to his bare bottom. So he thanks him with great sincerity after it is over.

But even with the fresh, crisply ironed apron and with his hair immaculately brushed, the step down onto the drive makes poor Willa shake. His collar bells are tinkling around his neck making him feel sick.

“Mistress, perhaps I should remove the collar. You know, you don’t want me attracting attention and …”

A sadistic smile pushes back Avery’s sexy lips. 

“Why maid, you look absolutely drop dead gorgeous, just as you are.”

Marvin smirks as he reaches out and uses his fingers to make the bells jangle.

“I wouldn’t want you any other way, maid,” he says.

It is when Marvin slams the front door and pockets the house keys that Willa feels total terror. He hadn’t even thought about not having any keys to the front door. Like a child he is actually locked out of his own house until someone opens the door for him.

“Right, maid,” the Bull announces, “you will walk two steps behind us. You will walk with a straight back and be the cute, elegant maid I know you can be.”

Willa wants to protest but doesn’t know what to say. As soon as Marvin wraps his arm around Willa’s wife, they walk down the path to the road, Willa steps cautiously forward in his heels.

Each time he has stepped outside wearing a skirt and stockings he is aware of how vulnerable he feels. The cool air tickling his bare thighs. No man has any idea what it is like to wear a flirty, flared skirt over stockings and frilly panties.

Though the couple aren’t moving quickly, Willa, because of the high heels, has to skip along to keep up.

Though the collar bells only tinkle gently, they might as well be like a church tower bell to the terrified house servant.

Once they hit the pavement, Willa feels ill. There are a few people dotted along the street, all of whom perk up at the sight of a fully dressed maid walking obediently behind the good looking couple.

It is barely a four minute walk, but for Willa it is a life time. He keeps his eyes fixed on his wife’s lovely curvy bottom, though he is feeling no arousal from it. The humiliation totally overwhelms him.

Nausea blurs his vision. He doesn’t look anywhere other than his wife’s bottom which no longer looks sexy. It is just a place to focus his thoughts on, try and take his mind ff of his dreadful journey.

Even as each short high heeled step follows the previous one, his mind is repeating, I can’t do this, I can’t do this, over and over again.

How on earth could he have thought that living out this fantasy would be hot?

It is mind-numbing agony.

The four minute journey is a walk without time. It takes forever to reach Jenny and Frank’s door. Willa feels an overwhelming urge to run away. But he cannot get back into his house as his Master has the house keys. Perhaps he could hide behind the garage. 

Maids suffer from a lack of logic at the best of times, let alone when they dumbly planning their own escape. If he hasn’t a key to the front door, he sure as hell no longer has a key to his own garage door.

In any case, even if he merely hides in the back garden, then, of course, both Master and Mistress would be angry with him and he would suffer some dreadful punishment.

The front door opens and a grinning, tight blue jeans-clad Jenny peers out. She has a tight tee shirt with a pretty design over her curvy boobs.

 “Oh, hi! Come on in!” She looks past them at the terrified maid, lowers her eyelids, and says, “Especially you!”

Once Willa is gratefully inside Jenny’s house, there is a good deal of cuddling, hugging and kissing of cheeks.

“Avery has told me so much about you, Marvin. And just wow! You really are a helluva man!”

Avery laughs, “Hands off, I found him first!”

“Well I can see why you’ve moved on!” She gins evilly at the flustered maid. “And just look at you William! Oh, sorry, Willa!” 

As Willa had feared, Jenny is lapping up his torment.

He blushes and looks down at their wood-panelled floor.

Marvin says, “Be best if you just call her maid for now. I don’t want her getting ideas above her station.”

Jenny grins the way a shark might, showing her even white teeth. “Oh no, Marvin, we don’t want her getting above her station.” 

She steps towards the maid, and although they are the same height, Willa feels his neighbour's strength in her presence. She puts her fingers under his chin and tilts up his head, forcing him to look at her. She wants to relish every last vestige of her wimpy neighbour's shame.

“Now, Heather and Amy have been telling me all about how they put you in the corner when you are naughty. Is that right?”

Willa turns to his Mistress but not daring to move his chin from his tormentor’s fingers.

“Mistress!”

“Now, maid,” Avery says, feeling energised at her power, “I hope you are not going to tell Jenny any naughty fibs.”

Jenny loves this! Like many women, she has always wanted to exert power, and like many women, has never been able to do it. Just looking at the cheeks of Willa bursting red with mortification, makes her pussy tingle.

Gritting her teeth, Jenny uses her fingers to turn Willa’s face back to hers, “So? Maid? Is that right? Do two six year olds make you stand in the corner when you are naughty?”

Willa squeaks a, ‘yes’.

Marvin says, “Maid, I don’t think Jenny can hear you.”

With his tummy revolving and his eyes seeking to avoid the sight of the gleeful bully, Willa says, “Yes, Miss Jenny. It is true.” Shame makes him hunt in his mind for a way to mitigate the revelation. He blurts out, “But only when I am naughty!”

Jenny howls with laughter. “Oh, my God. You are sex on a stick. I love this!”

With a proud smile, Avery says, “And again, Jenny dear, the maid is also mine!”

Jenny strokes the hot cheek of the maid, “Well, I want to see your maid serve us some wine, and beer for the guys.”

Avery is in her element, showing off her power to Jenny. Her pleasure heightened by the clearest evidence that Jenny loves the idea of a sissy maid to push around. She must ache with jealousy at Avery’s control

“Be a good girl, Willa,” Avery smiles, “and serve some white wine from Jenny’s fridge and a couple of beers for your Master and Frank.”

Oh God. Frank! 

Willa had hoped Frank would be out playing golf on the Saturday morning, but clearly Willa’s shame is about to envelop and drown him.

“Yes, Mistress,” he whispers and sets off through their living room to the kitchen.

Shock.

Frank is sitting in an armchair, buried in a newspaper. He glances over the paper, with his face creased in pain at the sight before him. He checks out the heels, the surprisingly nice stocking-clad legs, and the trim figure of the maid, before reaching the surprisingly cute face framed in the blonde hair and shakes his head.

“Listen, Will, I just want nothing to do with this. Got it?”

“Yes, Sir,” Willa manages to get out, trying to shrink his entire body so that he can be invisible.

“And I don’t want to hear any of that Sir shit neither!”

“Yes, Sir, I mean, no Sir.” Oh god. How much of an idiot is Willa going to make of himself.

Jenny says, “Oh don’t be such a grouch. And her name is Willa,” she turns to Avery, “Or maid. That’s right?”

“It is,” Avery says, sitting on the sofa, leaving room for her lover to crush up to her with a cuddle. “But it is up to Frank. The only person who doesn’t get a say is the maid.”

Everyone laughs except for an annoyed Frank who stands and crosses to the sofa where he shakes hands with Marvin. 

“Good to meet you. Sounds like a crazy thing you’ve got going down over at Avery’s house.”

Avery says, “Maid? Weren’t you given instructions?”

“Yes, Mistress,” and gratefully Willa flees from the room to the sanctuary of the kitchen.

Like all domestics, Willa is learning how safe he can feel in the kitchen. He can’t get into trouble when alone with the pots and pans.

He hears laughing from the sitting room and knows they are laughing about him. Rather than feeling aroused at the humiliation, the shame and helplessness are so thickly painful that his little dick shrivels in the metal chastity cage.

More laughter, and this time he hears Frank chuckling.

Oh God! Is Frank being won over?

From upstairs comes the gentle thumping of little feet running over carpeted floor boards, with the occasional little girl’s squealing with laughter. 

No doubt Heather, Amy and their friend, Petra. Hopefully, he will not be exposed before yet another young child.

Without anyone to instruct him, Willa agonises over whether to take in the bottle of opened wine or to pour two glasses in the kitchen and carry those into the room on a tray.

Why is it so hard to make such simple decisions? How he wishes his Master and Mistress could have told him exactly what they wanted.

He opts to pour two glasses of wine, plus half a glass of beer, and then leave the bottles on the tray.

With a deep breath of courage, he lifts the tray and carries it clinking into the sitting room.

With relief, he sees that Master and Frank are no longer present, just the giggling pair of Avery and Jenny.

The two women break off from their conversation like children caught in the act of being naughty. Willa wonders what they are hiding from him but settles the tray on a table before them without a word while desperately avoiding eye contact.

Avery says, “Maid, the men are in the games room watching the golf. You know what men are like.  Why don’t you be a good girl and take their drinks to them.”

Willa knows his wife is showing off her power to her friend and is painfully aware that Jenny is relishing this new dynamic.

“Yes, Mistress,” Willa says, moving the bottle and wine glasses carefully on to the table.

He lifts up the tray with just the beer bottles and glasses and heads for the games room.

“Oh, and Maid,” Jenny grins. “Hurry straight back. I think you’ve got something to show me!”

Willa’s tummy turns over with dread at what that might mean, but says, “Yes Miss Jenny,” and continues on his way.

The games room is at the rear of the house, and Willa knows it well from his time as William. They were close sporting buddies watching football and golf on their TVs. Frank has a mega sound installation around his huge screen 4K TV.

But that was in a previous life. 

Frank was clearly disgusted by his first meeting with William as Willa, the maid. So, it was very painful to knock on the door of the games room, not knowing the reaction he was going to experience.

“Come on in,” Frank calls out.

As soon as Willa enters in his heels, he sees Frank turn away in abhorrence and shake his head.

The World Series Golf tournament is playing on the TV. Willa wasn’t that interested in sport when he was William but always had a laugh with Frank. It was just easier to pretend he revelled in the sports than admit he didn’t get sport.

Marvin simply grins, relishing his maid’s predicament. “Very good maid. Now pour us our beers and hand them to us.”

“I’ll do my own,” Frank states, barely moving his lips.

Willa pours his Master’s beer just wanting to get out of the situation.

“Na,” Marvin says. “I can tell you don’t get it, Frank. That’s fine, but it would be great if the maid could serve you. Isn’t that right, maid?”

Willa’s mouth is dry as sandpaper as he croaks, “Yes, Master.”

He hands Master his beer and, as Frank hasn’t said a second ‘no’, he pours his old friend’s beer as carefully as he can.

The froth sits on top of the beer like a creamy crown as Willa’s shaking hand passes the beer to Frank. 

Frank gives the maid a desultory look, but Willa notices that he runs his eyes quickly up and down his body and legs.

“You look fucking ridiculous!” Frank spits out. “You know that?”

Willa wonders whether to apologise for looking ridiculous but knows that silence is always best when uncertain.

Then Frank nods his head to one side. “Alright. Pretty hot. I mean for a guy. But still ridiculous.”

“Yes, Sir. Thank you, Sir.” Oh God, why did he thank Frank?

Willa swallows and looks hopefully to his Master.

“Dismissed girl,” Marvin grins.

No maid has ever been more grateful to get out of a room and close the door behind them.

He stands for a moment, trying to get a grip on his breathing before returning to the sitting room. His mind full of explaining to Frank why he did it. ‘It was just a game,’ he’d say. 

As soon as he enters, the two women stopped gossiping.

Were they talking about him as the maid, or Avery’s new lover?

Jenny wiggles to the front of her chair and crooks her finger at Willa.

Obediently, Willa approaches.

“Put the tray down,” Jenny says.

He does. When will this trial by fire be over?

“Now, your Mistress has told me about your little secret. And I do mean, little!” She wiggles her little finger, making the two women crack up with laughter.

Willa chooses the path of silence.

“Hey,” Jenny says, her eyes narrowing with malice, “why don’t you lift up that darling little skirt of yours, and show me what’s underneath?”

Relief. Jenny wants to see his humbling frilly panties which Marvin insists he wears.

As embarrassing as lifting up his skirt is, it is far better than some of Willa's worst thoughts.

“Oh! What pretty panties,” Jenny laughs. “I think even your daughters would find those too childish!”

He closes his eyes, dying of shame but also knowing he is getting erect in his cage. It is so much easier without the spikes blocking his growth.

“Now,” Jenny says, her eyes flashing with mischief, I hear you have a little device hidden in your enchanting panties.”

Feeling his tummy drop, Willa says to Avery, “Mistress, please. Please!”

Avery wriggles to the edge of her seat. 

“Aw, Willa, Jenny here wants to take a look at our little secret. So be a good girl and show her.”

Willa closes his eyes, knowing he is trapped. Using just his index finger, he pulls down the front of his panties until he feels his fingertip pass over the cage part of his chastity cage.

“Oh my God,” Screams Jenny. “I’ve never seen anything like that before. His little dickie really is locked away!”

Avery is revelling in her position of flaunting her control over her sissy maid. “Tell Jenny who gets to keep the keys.”

Willa closes his eyes, feeling the eyelash extensions flutter on his skin.

He speaks hoarsely, dying inside. “Master holds the keys to the chastity cage, Miss Jenny.”

He feels his steel cage tugged and looks down to see Jenny’s staring at his crotch with eyes wide open yet blank, as if close to an orgasm. “Jesus fucking Christ. I just love this. Love it.” She twists the cage slightly making the maid wince. “You were never a real man, were you sissy?”

Willa says quickly, “Oh, no Miss.”

Still, the pressure from the hand of his neighbour continues. “Aren’t you glad your wife is now being serviced by a real man?”

Willa knows the answer to that one. 

“Oh yes, Miss Jenny.”

“I have just got to get one of these!” Jenny says loudly. “Like right now.”

A male voice from behind them. 

“Get what? What are you spending my money on now?” It’s Frank.

Jenny pushes the panties up into position and slaps away Willa’s hand holding up the front of his maid’s skirt. The maid’s dress flops down into position.

Falling back against the back of the sofa, Jenny is all innocence, “A maid like this.”

Frank comes into view, and Willa immediately drops his head needing to be anywhere other than in the presence of his former pal.

“No way.” Frank narrows his eyes. “Pervert.”

“Oh,” Jenny laughs. “You’d love one of these.” She adopts a rich low voice, mimicking her husband, “Hey bitch fetch me a beer. Get me some cashew nuts.”

“There’s plenty around.”  Marvin has joined them.

Jenny says, “What do you mean?”

Marvin shrugs his hefty shoulders, “Avery’s sister, Nicole, got one as soon as she met Willa here.”

Avery is bursting with pride. “As soon as Nicky saw my sissy maid, she just had to get one. So Marvin rang around and now she has one.”

Jenny’s face is seriously stern, “Frank, I want one. And I want one like yesterday.”

Frank nods, “I’ll think about it.”

Marvin says, “You know, a lot of guys come round to it. Think about it, it’s late at night, your wife is asleep and you are desperate to have your cock sucked while chucking a nice cold beer down your neck.”

Frank is angry. “Willy? Er Willa? You suck … I mean you actually …”

Willa feels bitter phlegm rise into his throat. He needs to throw up but hasn’t yet been dismissed.

“Hey,” Marvin says, “they love doing anything that pleases anyone else. That’s what sissies live for. Service. What does it hurt? They’re happy, you’re happy. Everyone’s a winner.”

Frank eyes the maid from her neat heels, up her lovely stockinged legs, and shapely thighs, over her narrowed waist and the small boobs to the impossibly cute blushing face and nods.

“How much do they charge?”

Marvin smiles. “That’s the thing. They don’t. All they need is a firm hand and a nice uniform.”

Jenny can feel her husband’s initial reserve fall away. “What do you think, Frank? Give it a go?”

Frank takes in a deep breath of consideration. “I don’t know.”

Oddly, Willa feels his own sense of pride at helping win over the old chauvinistic Frank. 

Marvin says, “I tell you what. Why not see how my maid performs tonight, serving pizzas. Then let me know and I’ll make a call.”

Jenny squeals, “Frank come on, come on.”

Willa is shocked. He’s staying all day and serving dinner to them all? He’ll be glad when the three months are up and he is allowed to discuss matters with them.

Frank says, “Well, all right. Let’s see how …”

That’s all he can say before Jenny grabs him hard and gives him a hard squeeze.

I used to be a mafia princess. Now? I’m just the help. I gave up my empire for love. Walked away from the Rossini name, the gold, the power—all for one promise Edmund made me on my eighteenth birthday.

“One day, baby, I’ll take you around the world.”

Thirty years later, I’m invisible in my own home. Mocked by my grandsons. Ignored by my son. And replaced—body and soul—by my perfect, venomous sister-in-law, Elizabeth.

I knew. Everyone knew. Elizabeth was Edmund’s mistress. But I kept my mouth shut. I believed—foolishly—that Edmund would change.

Then came my forty-eighth birthday.

I dared to ask Edmund for one thing—a cruise. Just a simple cruise.

He brushed me off like I was nothing.

But the truth hit me like a bullet.

I found their cruise tickets. Edmund and Elizabeth, sailing away with my son, my daughter-in-law, and my grandsons—all celebrating Elizabeth’s birthday.

I was left behind by all of them.

I smiled, bitter and cold. Grabbed my suitcase. Booked the next flight back to my real home.

Back to the dangerous daughter of a mafia king—the one Edmund always feared and the alliance he’s been desperate to control.

That was the moment I found my voice—clear. Calm. Sharper than a blade.

“The divorce papers are waiting for you.”

There was a stunned pause, then Edmund’s voice cracked through the line, “You’re joking. You can’t divorce me.”

I laughed. Cold. Cruel. Cutting through the silence like a knife.

“I can.”

\--

I was supposed to be the ghost in the house.

I never asked for jewels. Never asked for roses. Just one promise. One promise.

A cruise.

Edmund had said it back when he still had a soul. “One day, when we're rich,” he whispered into my hair, “I'll take you around the world, baby. Just us.”

That was before the money. Before the empire. Before I became his wife in name, and his maid in practice.

And today’s my 48th birthday. No one ever greeted me. No cake, no candles.

And I thought maybe—just maybe—it could be mine.

I brought it up after dinner. He was still in his chair, polishing his pistol with that same old cloth like it was a sacred ritual. The flatscreen TV was playing some old Western no one was watching. My heart was pounding harder than it should’ve been.

“Do you remember what you told me… on my 18th birthday?” I asked quietly.

He didn’t look up. “Which part?”

“That we’d travel. See the world together. You said once the business settled and our boy was grown… we’d go. On a cruise. Just us.”

“Are you out of your mind?” Edmund chuckled, “You think you deserve a cruise? Look at you. You look like a bamboo stick. One gust and you're gone. You think the captain’s gonna see you and roll out a red carpet? No, Doris. He’s gonna think you’re hauling walking bacteria on board.”

""But today is—""

""Today's what?"" He finally looked at me. His face was older, heavier now. “You’re not young anymore. The world’s not kind to women like you out there. You're not like Elizabeth.”

There it was. The name that always hovered between us.

Elizabeth. My sister-in-law. His brother’s widow. Slim, golden-haired, always dressed like she stepped out of a fashion magazine. She judged me with her eyes every time we were in the same room. Edmund never corrected her.

“She’s younger,” he continued, “travels for business. Makes appearances for the family. She’s part of the image. But you—you’ve always been the one behind the scenes. That’s where you shine. The house. The family. You keep things running.”

Behind me, the twins were laughing. My grandson.

“Yeah, Ma, you look like a skeleton in a funeral dress,” said Lyle, smirking.

“Smells like old mop water and something foul,” Nash added, pinching his nose.

They burst into snorting laughter. No one stopped them. No one ever did.

Lester, our pride and failure, leaned against the fridge and shouted across the kitchen, “Hey, Ma. Wash my clothes, yeah? My wife is busy right now. And bleach the white ones this time, unless you wanna ruin another set.”

“I’m not your maid,” I murmured.

“What was that?” he snapped.

“I said I’m not—”

He threw a half-empty soda can at the floor. “Then what the heck are you? Because you sure as heck ain’t doing anything else in this house! You don’t bring money in.”

My blood boiled.

“I raised you,” I snapped. “Fed you. Stayed up when you had fevers. I’ve been working since before you were born.”

“Well, maybe you should’ve worked on smelling better. You smell like a rotten corpse,” one of the twins piped.

“Yeah,” snickered his brother, Nash. “It’s embarrassing just seeing her. Our classmates said she’s so ugly, they get scared when she shows up to pick us up. Like some cast member from The Walking Dead.”

They both burst into giggles. Then Edmund grabbed his pistol off the mantel, inspecting it like it mattered more than me.

“We got money, Doris,” he muttered. “You know that. But I’m not wasting it on some useless help. You’re here. You got two hands. Why on earth would I hire a maid when you’re the woman of the house?”

The woman of the house. That was whatever he called me.

But I didn’t own anything. Not a car. Not a card.

Every cent I needed, I had to beg for. And if I asked for more? He’d demand an itemized receipt. Penny by penny.



\---



That night, when the noise died down and the family disappeared into their rooms, I walked to the bedroom, pulled out the old red suitcase from the closet. The one he bought me in Naples before our wedding.

Before the world twisted into what it is now.

I looked down at my hands. They didn’t look like mine anymore. Lined. Broken. Tired.

I used to be someone. A Rossini. The daughter of a mafia king. The girl born with gold in her mouth and fire in her spine. But I gave that up for love. I disowned myself from my family, thinking Edmund’s love was enough.

And now?

Now I was just the ghost in the house.

No kingdom. No crown. I have enough already. Maybe, leaving this family is the best birthday I could give to myself.



Chapter 2

The next morning…

I heard about the dinner from Lyle—he blurted it out while stuffing potato chips in his mouth.

“Elizabeth rented the whole top floor of the Luciana Hotel! Fancy, huh? Dad says she booked it just for us. Big celebration.”

I paused mid-mop. “Us?”

Nash answered, “You’re not coming, Ma. Grandpa said you're... not up for it. I mean, look at you.""

Not up for it... Like I was sick. Or senile. Or something to be pitied.

By sunset, the house was empty. Edmund had shaved. Wore the cologne he only touched for business deals and funerals. He stood tall in his navy suit, fixing Lyle’s and Nash collar like a proud grandfather, and Lester wore his best suit.

“Remember,” Edmund said to them, “Elizabeth’s doing this because she loves us. She's family.”

“We know, grandpa. That's why we love Elizabeth more than Grandma Doris.” they answered in unison.

And then, nothing. No goodbye. No we’ll bring you something. Just the sound of the front door closing like a coffin lid.

The quiet afterward was insulting. A hollow that screamed louder than any slap.

I stood in the middle of the hallway, in my house slippers, holding a basket of unfolded laundry. My stomach growled. I hadn’t cooked. What for?

Out of spite, I turned on the TV. They were on the news.

A live segment from the Luciana Hotel.

Cameras panned across crystal chandeliers and violin quartets. There they were—Elizabeth in her fur shawl. Edmund beside her. My son and his wife smiling like politicians. Lyle and Nash sipping soda in a tiny tuxedo.

The reporter called it: “A private Morroco gathering—Elizabeth’s homecoming. The family behind one of the largest shipping fortunes in the country.”

I was not in the shot. Not in the credits.

Not even in the whispers.

They toasted champagne. I sipped stale coffee.

They laughed under golden light. I wiped a smudge off the glass door.

And just when I thought it couldn’t cut deeper, the camera caught a brief, brutal moment:

Elizabeth leaned toward Edmund, whispered something, and they both laughed.

My son chuckled too. I didn’t know what she said. But I knew it was about me.

I felt it in my teeth.

\*\*\*

Hours later, just after midnight, the door opened again. I turned. Hoped, stupidly, it might be my son. But no—it was them.

Elizabeth’s heels clicked confidently across the marble as she half-carried Edmund, drunk and swaying, into the house. His tie hung loose, lips pink from too much wine. Eyes bleary, glazed.

“Oh, Doris,” Elizabeth said with a smirk, spotting me standing by the staircase like a ghost. “Didn’t think you’d be awake.”

She steered Edmund toward the hall, her arm looped through his like a bride on her wedding day. “Lester and the twins are staying at my penthouse. Too tired to come back. But Edmund… well, he can’t sleep in strange beds. Poor thing.”

A lie.

I knew it.

She came here only to shove the truth down my throat.

“I told him not to worry,” she continued sweetly. “I’d bring him home. Take care of him. It’s what family does, right?”

Then she reached into her tote and tossed a plastic container at my feet. It bounced once, landed near the rug.

“Leftovers,” she said. “Go eat, sister-in-law. You look like a sickly little stick. You should really take better care of yourself. Bet you weight like 30kls.""

I didn’t move.

My fingers curled into fists at my side.

“I’ll put Edmund to bed,” she added with a sly smile. “I know you two don’t share a room anymore. He told me. Said your side of the bed always smells like disappointment.”

I took one step forward. Just one. My palm twitched. Slapping her would’ve felt good. Almost holy. But what for?

My heart was already cracking in my chest like ice under boots. And the real punishment was in what I saw next—

Edmund, drunk and limp, smiled at her like she’d hung the moon. “Elizabeth’s so pretty,” he mumbled. “Smells like peaches. Mmm. Doris smells like dishwater and arguments.”

They climbed the stairs together. I stayed behind. Frozen. Shaking. She laughed once more before they disappeared down the hall.

And I realized—

They didn’t kill me.

They just replaced me.

\*\*\*

I waited.

Not because I cared. Not because I hoped. But because I needed to know.

The clock ticked past one. Then two. Still no sign of her. The upstairs lights stayed on. No footsteps on the stairs. No sound of a door closing. Only muffled laughter. Then silence.

I sat on the edge of the couch in my robe, untouched coffee cooling on the table. The house smelled of lemon cleaner and betrayal.

Maybe she fell asleep in the guest room. Maybe she just—

A thump.

Then another.

Not heavy. Rhythmic. Too… intimate.

My blood chilled.

I rose, like something pulled me forward by the throat. I climbed the stairs, slow as a prayer. The hallway stretched like a graveyard path. The door to our bedroom—his bedroom now—was cracked open.

And I saw.

Elizabeth, unclothed, straddling Edmund. Her red nails dug into his chest like claws. Her head tilted back in a mess of curls. And Edmund—my husband, my life partner of 30 years—grunting beneath her like an animal.

My legs stopped working. My mouth went dry.

She cried out loud, shameless, her voice like a blade across my spine.

“Ohh… Brother-in-law—don’t stop. Fill me. Ruin me like she never let you.”

Edmund murmured, “You’re perfect. Not like her. You’re everything, Lizzy—”

I ran.

I didn’t cry. I ran. Straight to the downstairs bathroom and vomited until my ribs cramped.

The sound of them still echoed in my ears, louder than sirens.

“Harder—make me forget she ever existed!”

“You were always the one, Lizzy. Always.”

He was fifty. She was forty-five.

And still, they had no shame. Not even a sliver of decency. They weren't just in-laws. They weren’t even just lovers. They were conspirators. Twisting the knife slowly—together.

I stayed on the cold tile floor, knees pressed to my chest, my body shaking in waves I couldn’t stop. It wasn’t about the intimacy. It was about being erased.

Replaced.

They didn’t just want to humiliate me. They wanted to watch me rot in the house I built. But a woman who survives this?

She doesn’t stay on the bathroom floor. She remembers. She plans. She learns how to haunt quietly.



Chapter 3

I woke before the birds.

No alarm. No reason. Just the reflex of a woman trained to serve everyone but herself.

No tears. No ache. Just breath. In, out. Hollow.

I wiped my face with a damp cloth. Lip balm. Hair tied low. Not beautiful—just functional. Alive enough to pass.

Then I reached under the bed.

The red suitase was there. I dragged it out, unzipped it two inches. Cash from quiet sales—empanadas, lumpia—no questions asked. Passport, maiden name. A photo of me at eighteen. Smiling. Bold. Untouched by the slow erosion of marriage. I zipped it shut.

Downstairs, the kitchen was still dark. I boiled water, cracked eggs, sliced bread. My hands moved on their own. Stir. Season. Flip. Feed.

I was pouring coffee when I heard them behind me—bare feet against the hardwood. Her giggle first. Then his laugh.

They slid into the kitchen like a couple on a honeymoon. Elizabeth wore one of Edmund’s button-downs, half open. Her legs bare. Hair tousled like she’d just rolled off him, which she probably did. Edmund looked freshly showered, like their night together was some kind of baptism.

“Coffee, Doris,” she said, yawning like a cat in sunlight. “Make his strong, mine half and half. You know how he likes it.”

I handed them their mugs without a word.

Edmund didn’t even glance at me. Just sipped. Then said, “Bacon and omelet, Doris. Lizzy loves it the way I do. None of that salty mess you used to make. She's watching her figure—not that it shows, huh?”

Elizabeth chuckled and leaned against the counter like she owned it. “Not everyone wants to look like a stick wrapped in sadness, sweetie.”

I smiled. Not out of kindness. Just strategy.

Smile. Just smile. You’ve cooked for enemies before.

I cracked more eggs. Let the oil sizzle. Pretended I didn’t hear them talking about the night. About the penthouse. About how soft the sheets were. About how Edmund snored less when he was “with her.” About how my shampoo made him sneeze. They ate like I was the maid. Talked like I wasn’t real.

Then the front door flung open.

“Family’s here!” Lester’s voice boomed like a sitcom dad. “Let the party begin!”

Loisa followed behind him, heels clicking against the tiles, holding up a new designer purse like it was the Holy Grail. “Mom, look! Elizabeth gave me this! Can you believe it? Real leather! Italian! And these earrings? Gifted. God, she’s such a giver.”

She twirled like a child. Like she didn’t already own closets full of things Lester bought for her. Not that he ever bought me a single scarf.

Behind them, the twins stormed in with that careless energy only teenagers have. Lyle was wearing sunglasses indoors. Nash had something massive covered in brown paper.

Loisa laughed again, too loud. “Didn’t you hear? Lizzie gave us the whole penthouse. We slept like royals. You should’ve seen the tub. Bigger than our bedroom.”

“Oh, and the view,” Lester chimed in, opening a bottle of wine without asking. “From the 36th floor? Breathtaking. Sun hits the windows just right. Like a painting. Like—perfect.”

It was nine in the morning.

Nash and Lyle dragged their ‘surprise’ into the living room and tore off the cover. It was a giant, glossy print of the family, taken at the Luciana Hotel gala. Everyone dressed like aristocrats. Posed like nobility. Elizabeth in the middle. My sons beside her. Edmund’s hand resting on her body.

I wasn’t in the picture.

“Look, Grandma!” Nash said with a smirk. “Don’t we look like a real family here?”

Lyle added without blinking, “Too bad you weren’t there. Oh wait—yeah. You were left behind. Guess you looked too much like our maid.”

The room exploded with laughter. Even Edmund. Even my son. Even Loisa, wiping tears from her eyes.

Elizabeth just sipped her coffee and said cheerfully, “Don’t worry, Doris. I’ll leave some of my old dresses in your closet. And some perfume. They’re a little tight on me now, but I think you can squeeze in.”

Edmund chuckled, not even looking at me. “You can dress a corpse in Versace—it’s still a corpse. She still smells like disappointment.”

Loisa practically screamed laughing. Nash and Lyle clapped each other like it was a roast battle.

And me?

I picked up their dirty plates. I washed them one by one. I stared out the window at the neighbor’s lemon tree, blooming.

They think this is the end. But they haven’t seen what I look like when I stop begging to belong.



\---



That night, when the laughter died and the wine ran out and the house went still, I crept into the living room. I stood there staring at it again.

The portrait. Massive. Hung dead-center in the sala like a crown jewel.

Lester made a whole production out of placing it there. Right above the console table. Right where no one could miss it. Where guests would pause and admire the happy family and say, “What a beautiful household you have.”

A lie, printed in high gloss.

I didn’t even hear Edmund come in until he was behind me.

“What, jealous again?” His voice always sounded rougher when he was bored. “You stare at that thing like it’s gonna cry for you.”

I didn’t answer. What was the point?

He scoffed. “Come on, Doris. If I could turn back time… I swear, I would’ve left you back in the province. Should’ve married Elizabeth from the start. She’s better than you in every freaking way. Classy. Successful. Knows how to run a business. Knows how to shut up.”

I turned away, still quiet.

That’s when he kicked me.

Right in the knee. My leg buckled, and I dropped with a thud I was too tired to even burst at. The floor met me like an old friend. Cold. Familiar.

The tears came without permission. Warm and humiliating. Not because of the pain. No. I think it was because of the sound of him walking away like I wasn’t even there.

“Enough drama,” he muttered. “You’re too old for this thing.”

Then his phone rang.

I could still hear my breath catching in my chest when he answered it.

The tone of his voice changed instantly. “Hey, baby,” he said, like I wasn’t even on the floor. “Mmm, I missed you already.”

I wiped my face slowly, one sleeve at a time.

His voice dropped into something warm. Giddy. Teenage. “Yeah, yeah, I’m packing. Can’t wait to see you in that bikini again. This cruise’ll be insane. You and me. Open sea.”



Chapter 4

I didn’t follow Edmund.

He walked away, still giggling with Elizabeth like a boy on prom night, whispering into his phone about bikinis and champagne like I wasn’t still on the floor with my knees aching and my soul halfway gone.

I stood. My knees creaked. My hand smudged across the tile, picking up dirt and pride. I walked to the bathroom. Closed the door quietly. Stared into the mirror like I didn’t know the woman staring back—eyes puffy, cheek red, hair undone. Like someone who tried to cry underwater and failed.

There’s no funeral. But I’m mourning.

Not for him. Not for us.

For me.

For the girl I used to be before love took her name and silence stole her voice.

Just then, he passed by. Didn’t knock. Didn’t ask if I was alive. Still on the phone, laughing—then paused long enough to say, “Pack my things. Business-leisure trip. We leave tomorrow.”

No “please.” No glance. No soul.

I nodded. Not that he was looking.

I dried my hands on the crooked towel. Walked to his room like a maid. Opened the closet. Chaos—suits tangled with polos, shoes under dirty laundry. A grown man living like a spoiled teen.

I started folding his shirts. White linen. Navy power. Cleaned his cufflinks with my sleeve.

Then I bumped the side table.

A folder slipped. I picked it up, expecting tax papers. But inside—cruise tickets.

I blinked.

I read them twice and my fingers tightening.

Edmund Morocco. Elizabeth Morocco. Lester. Loisa. Lyle. Nash.

My name wasn’t there.

Not even as a +1. Not even as a footnote.

The cruise? The one I dreamed of...

But now? Elizabeth’s birthday is in three days and he has time? He remembered hers.

Not mine.

Never mine.

I folded the tickets gently. Like they could bleed.

Then I packed his suitcase. Polished his shoes. Ironed his pants. Lined up his deodorant and vitamins like hotel staff would.

Lester walked in. No knock. “Ma, pack my stuff too, yeah? Loisa’s busy.” He sipped a beer. “Don’t forget the twins. Nash wants his charger. Lyle needs the blue swim shorts. Snacks too—they get bored.”

Then he left. And I packed it all.

Tiny shorts. Rolled t-shirts. Loisa’s perfume wrapped in a sock. Ziplocked snacks labeled with love.

Then I went to my room. Quietly. Closed the door.

I sat there on my bed, hands trembling, and my mind drifted back. Back to when I was just eighteen.

When Edmund wasn’t a man who kicked me in the knee or forgot my name on a cruise ticket.

Back when he said things that sounded like promises…

\*\*\*

I was fresh out of school, a girl still unsure of her own shadow.

Edmund looked at me, eyes soft and serious, like I was the only thing that made sense.

“Doris,” he said, holding my hand like it was the only thing steady in his wild world, “I swear, I’ll take care of you. Always. No matter what happens, you’ll never have to worry about a thing.”

I smiled, my heart so full it felt like it might burst.

“Even if the whole world turns its back?” I asked, barely breathing.

He nodded. “Especially then.”

Then another flashbacks...

A summer evening under the stars. We lay on the grass, tangled limbs and whispered dreams.

“I don’t care about money, or power, or the legacy,” Edmund said, voice low and fierce. “You’re the only future I want. You and me, we’ll build something real. Something no one can take.”

I laughed, feeling invincible.

“You make me believe in forever.”

He kissed me like he meant it. Like forever was ours already.



But then came my father.

The man with a crown no one dared challenge.

When I told him I loved Edmund — his blood wasn’t the right kind, his family not the right name — my father’s face twisted with something colder than winter.

“Doris,” he said, voice like steel, “you’re dead to me. You don’t get to drag our name into this dirt.”

I stood my ground, tears burning but voice steady.

“I’m not your possession.”

He laughed, cruel and hollow. ""You are my daughter, yes. But you’re no Rossini anymore,” he spat. “Marry that boy if you want, but don’t expect me to recognize you. You are dead to me. If you come back, I’ll kill you myself. And you know I don’t bluff.”

I swallowed hard. “I love Edmund.”

“You love a shadow. You’ll die in that darkness.”

\---

And now—thirty years later—Edmund’s true colors bled through all those pretty words. That boy who promised to care for me, who whispered forever, was gone.

Replaced by a man who could kick me down and never look back. A man who packs his bags for a cruise with another woman and leaves me packing silence.

And I sit here, wondering how a love so loud became a ghost I can’t outrun.

I smiled bitterly and reached for the landline no one uses anymore. Dialed a number I hadn’t called in thirty years.

It rang.

Once. Twice. Three times.

Then—

“Hello?”

It was him.

My father. Older. Tired. But still him. Still warm in that quiet, exhausted way.

I couldn’t speak. Held the receiver like it was keeping me upright. Tears slipped down, soft and unstoppable.

“…F-father,” I whispered. My voice cracked. “…It’s me. Doris.”



Chapter 5

The line was still warm in my hand when I heard my father’s voice. Calm. Tired. Like the kind of tired that’s lived a thousand lonely nights waiting.

“Come home, Doris,” he said.

“I’ve been waiting for you for twenty years.”

Twenty years. Twenty years of waiting. And me, too afraid or too proud or maybe just too broken to pick up the phone.

My knees almost gave out, but I caught myself. Instead, I sank to the edge of the bed and let the tears fall.

“I’m coming home,” I whispered, voice barely a ghost.

He didn’t say anything more. Just the sound of his breath, steady and real, a lifeline. I hung up before I could say goodbye.

That’s when Edmund walked in. Like a shadow slipping through the cracked door. His eyes were cold — calculating — like he could smell the truth on me and hated it.

He didn’t even bother to pretend.

“I know you saw the tickets,” he said. Smirk like he was telling a joke. “Limited to six, Doris. Me. Elizabeth. Lester. Loisa. The twins. That’s it.”

I swallowed the lump in my throat.

“You’re deliberately excluded.”

His voice dropped to a dead calm. Like ice melting on concrete.

“When I get back, I’ll buy you a diamond set. Take you to Hawaii.”

Like those words were supposed to be a consolation prize. Then he turned, walked out without another glance. Just like I was air.

I stood there a moment, silent. Staring at the door he just closed behind him like a coffin.

The next morning, I moved through the motions in the kitchen. Omelets, bacon, toast — the smell sharp and mocking.

From the living room, I heard the twins. Laughing, shouting like it was Christmas morning.

“This cruise is the biggest ever!” Lester yelled. “We’re going to have so much fun!”

Their voices were bright, innocent. And cruel.

Then Elizabeth showed up, arms loaded with takeout bags.

She dropped them on the counter with a loud thud and sneered, “I don’t like Doris’s cooking,” she announced, loud enough for everyone to hear. “It’s like chewing on cardboard or swallowing salt straight from the shaker. Bland, over-salted, and completely uninspired—just like her.”

The room went still for a moment, and then she tossed her head, eyes gleaming.

“You know, family dinners used to mean something. Now? It’s just a reminder of how pathetic some people are. Doris tries, bless her heart, but you can’t polish a stone that’s already cracked all the way through.”

The twins giggled, but Lester wasn’t done.

“Yeah, Mum, I mean, why even bother pretending you care? You make food like you don’t want us here. Like you’re waiting for us to leave just to be alone with your failures.”

Loisa nodded, picking up the thread with a sharp grin.

“Honestly, it’s kind of sad, mum. You cook like you’re punishing us. Like every burnt edge and dry bite is your little protest. But we’re not fooled. We see right through you.”

Elizabeth snatched a bag from the counter, opening it with exaggerated care.

“So family, eat this. Real food. Food that people who actually matter deserve. We leave in an hour.”

Their eyes flicked over me like I was some ugly secret they all shared but refused to admit out loud.

I watched as they dug in like they were starving, piling their plates, asking for more drinks, more snacks.

“Get me water.”

“Pass the salt.”

“More napkins.”

Invisible, I faded into the background, biting down the bitterness that wanted to choke me.

Just before they left, Edmund’s voice cut through the kitchen like a whip.

“Where’s my wallet?”

He spun around, eyes sharp, accusing me without a word.

“You’re hiding it, aren’t you?” His eyes burned. “Because that’s what you do—hide things. Hide from responsibility, hide from respect, hide like the useless, jealous little nobody you are.”

I shook my head quietly.

He didn’t wait. His hand slapped my face. Hard.

The world spun. Blood poured from my nose like a cruel joke.

I collapsed.

The floor was cold and steady beneath me as my vision blurred. Then Elizabeth inhaled sharply, her voice dripping with fake innocence.

“Oh! Sorry, brother-in-law,” she said, voice syrupy sweet. “I must have taken your wallet by mistake while digging through my earrings. You know how clumsy I am.”

She pulled it from her bag with a smirk only I noticed. I knew. It was a setup. A way to make me small. To humiliate me in front of everyone.

The family gathered their bags like it was a holiday, smiling and shouting their goodbyes.

Lester, pretending to be kind: “Don’t worry, Mum. I’ll bring you a fridge magnet.”

Loisa added, “And I’ll bring you a keychain.”

“We’ll bring you dirty laundry, Grandma.” The twins laughed and even made silly faces.

Their words hit like knives, soft but sharp.

The door slammed shut behind them.

Silence.

I didn’t wait. Didn’t cry. I walked straight to the bedroom, dropped to my knees, and dragged my old bag out from under the bed. I grabbed it. Zipped it. Left everything else behind.

I took a cab and went straight to the airport.

Then my phone buzzed.

Edmund.

\> Guard the house while we’re gone. We’ll be out for a week. Don’t mess anything up.

Another message followed instantly.

\> Sorry I slapped you. But you provoked me. If only you weren’t always so jealous. You ruin things for yourself.

I stared at the words, the gall of it. A man who’d used his hands to silence me now using words to rewrite history. Still blaming me for his cruelty.

I smiled — not out of joy, but clarity.

Then I blocked his number.

Deleted the thread. Gone.

I slipped the phone into my coat pocket, stepped onto the plane, and didn’t look back once.

I was done guarding a house that had never been a home. I was going back to the only place that ever was.

Home.

She always wore it. The thin chain kept the heart-shaped locket pressed to the hollow of her throat. Her braid of brown hair fell off her right shoulder and down the front of her conservative dress. My mom always wore the most conservative dress. She was such a fifties housewife, staying at home, keeping everything clean, being subservient to dad.
Like always subservient. She would fetch him beers when he watched TV after work and always made sure his coffee was topped off during breakfast. Every day when he came home from work, Mom would be waiting for him, ready to take his jacket and massage his feet.
And she did it with a smile on her face. She loved my dad. And I didn’t blame him. He was a handsome man, tall, dark-haired, and muscular. Sometimes he made my body ache with desires and I would have to masturbate in my room hoping my twin sister Alice didn’t notice.
Now Alice and I weren’t identical twins but fraternal. We looked as much alike as any other normal set of sisters. She was taller and slimmer than I was but my breasts were bigger and my hair finer. It fell in a similar braid to my mother’s down my back, almost the same shade of brown.
“Mom, we’re going to be late,” Alice shouted from the car, her head shoved through, her bushy, tawny hair spilling about her delicate face. We both inherited Mom’s small nose and delicate cheekbones, making us look fragile and innocent.
“In a moment, dear,” my mom shouted, always full of patience. She turned to me and stroked my hair. “While I’m gone it will be up to you to take care of him, okay. Be obedient and a good girl. I know you will be. You love being a good girl for your daddy.”
My cheeks warmed. Ever since I realized that my dad was a muscular hunk beneath the dress shirts he wore for his office job, I found myself wanting to do whatever he said, running errands, fetching him drinks, doing things Mom normally did for him so I could be around him. It made my heart almost float out of my chest when I did.
I just wanted to be close to my dad. I was a daddy’s girl, but so were lots of my friends. My friends, including my best friend Sun, were all jealous that I had the cutest dad.
Alice, on the other hand, was a brat. I was glad she was going with Mom to Grandma’s. Three weeks of just me and Dad while Mom helped Grandma adjust after Grandpa’s hip surgery. I could have gone, but it was my choice to stay.",1,1749551315.0,Hot_Romance_Stories,0,1.0,False
