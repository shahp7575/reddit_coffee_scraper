Dear {Agent},

I’m writing to seek representation for TETHERED, a 105,000-word adult contemporary fantasy romance. My book features a protagonist who battles intrusive thoughts like in *Phantasma* by Kaylie Smith and has the horror, gothic vibes from *The Year of the Witching* by Alexis Henderson.

In Salem, Massachusetts, falling in love is dangerous…perhaps even a curse.

Plagued with whispering voices and intrusive thoughts, Dahlia is desperate for peace, for normalcy. She just wants to enjoy her newlywed life with her husband, Dean. But when they move into a Victorian home, the whispers and thoughts worsen, manifesting into tangible beings. Still, she ignores it like she has all her life. What’s one more haunting, anyway? 

Yet circumstances intensify when Dahlia meets Adam. A man she finds herself inexplicably drawn to against her will. Forced to uncover the darkness surrounding her, Dahlia learns that a centuries-old curse is real and intends to rip apart her marriage and world by demanding she leave Dean for Adam—or stay and risk Dean’s life. Racing against time, she must break the curse before Dean dies, or the connection between her and Adam becomes so persuasive she can no longer resist. But as Dahlia unveils pieces of Salem’s tormented past, she discovers secrets far darker than the curse, threatening everything she knows about herself.

 I’m a homeschool mom of three from Washington State. You can find me on my fourth cup of coffee, curled up in a book or writing make-believe stories in my free time. 

Thank you for your time and consideration. 

Best,

 Erin Apple

The beans, even when fresh, are often very oily, and they clog up my Encore ESP and cause a lot of retention.

They also seem to extract so fast that it’s sometimes hard to grind fine enough to get good texture and brew time, because the coffee becomes over extracted and bitter when I go that fine. I usually have to use a very small yield ratio.

Does anyone have good grinding/brewing experiences with dark roasts? Would any grinder have these issues with such dark/oily beans, or is my Encore maybe more prone to it?",2,1741660993.0,espresso,1,1.0,False

We’re using a reputable local contractor and pulling a permit. Trying to decide between using Techo Bloc concrete pavers over crushed stone and sand base or going with outdoor 2cm porcelain tile. The patio will have a free standing wood burning fireplace and some couches and a coffee table. Mostly used for just hanging out and the occasional party.

I like the tile because it’s non permeable so it won’t stain and it’s easier to clean, which is a big plus because we have small kids. Plus i understand it’s more durable and less likely to chip or crack if something is dropped. I’d go with a brand like Milestone or [Architessa](https://architessa.com/products/frontier20-slate-look?variant=44309555380385).

The install instructions say you can put it over crushed stone and sand but contractor is skeptical because they weigh less than the pavers and he’s concerned they are more likely to shift. So he recommends a poured concrete slab and using thinset mortar. I’m not opposed but concerned that this will make replacing any tiles that get damaged over time much harder.

Which would you do?

- 2cm porcelain tiles over same 
- 2cm porcelain tiles mortared to concrete slab",1,1741660404.0,landscaping,0,1.0,False

I stepped on the scale this morning, and for the first time in years, I saw a number I’m proud of: 71kg (156 lbs). A “normal” BMI. Body fat at 17%. Two years ago, I was obese (BMI 31), living off pizza and cookie dough ice cream like it was a personality trait. I ruined my 20-year-old body, and I hated looking in the mirror. But today, I feel different. Lighter. Healthier. Not just physically, but mentally.

I wasted so much time on dumb fitness trends, pointless supplements, and ""magic"" diets that never worked. But when I finally cracked the code, everything changed. Losing weight wasn’t about suffering through endless workouts or cutting every carb - it was about getting smarter with my food and training. 80% diet, 20% exercise. And these were the foods that made it possible:

**- Oatmeal - basic but undefeated. Filling, healthy, and fixed my digestion.**

**- Chicken breast - obviously.**

**- Vegetables (tomatoes, etc.) - eat them, they matter.**

**- Protein shakes - easy, convenient, and great mixed with oats.**

**- Black coffee & tea - appetite control and energy boost in one.**

**- Protein bread - if you love bread but hate the carbs, this is the hack.**

Of course, food alone didn’t fix my mindset. Losing weight was just as much a mental battle as a physical one. My biggest breakthrough? Therapy. I didn’t want to admit I needed it, but my anxiety around food, exercise, and self-worth wasn’t going to solve itself. Here’s what actually helped me rewire my brain:

\- **Your thoughts lie to you. The fear of “failing” a diet is worse than actually messing up. One bad meal won’t ruin you. Obsessing over perfection will.**

**- Willpower is overrated. Habits and environment matter more. If you have junk food everywhere, you’ll eat it. Make your default choices healthy.**

**- Food guilt is pointless. You’re not “bad” for eating a cookie. The key is consistency, not punishment.**

My therapist also threw a bunch of book recs at me, and honestly, reading these changed everything. If you are in the same situation, these books are the next best thing:

**-** [**Grain Brain**](https://befreed.ai/book/grain-brain-by-david-perlmutter) **by David Perlmutter (Your brain might be addicted to the wrong foods)**

This book made me question everything I thought i knew about carbs. The author talks about how processed grains and sugars can mess with your brain, mood, and weight. If you’ve ever felt like your cravings are controlling you, this is a must-read.

**-** [**Burn**](https://befreed.ai/book/burn-by-herman-pontzer) **by Herman Pontzer (You can’t outwork a bad diet)**

This book completely changed how I see calories and metabolism. Pontzer, an evolutionary anthropologist, studied hunter-gatherer tribes and found that our bodies adapt to burn a set amount of calories no matter how much we move. It explains why exercise alone isn’t enough for fat loss - and why diet is king. Insanely eye-opening read.

**-** [**Built to Move**](https://befreed.ai/book/built-to-move-by-kelly-starrett) **by Kelly & Juliet Starrett (Make fitness sustainable)**

 A practical guide on how to move better, feel stronger, and prevent injuries. Helped me fix my form and mobility issues.

**- The Joy of Half a Cookie by Jean Kristeller (Stop emotional eating)**

If you’ve ever felt out of control around food, this book is a must-read. It teaches mindful eating techniques that actually work (no, it’s not just “eat slower”).

**- The Diet Fix by Yoni Freedhoff (Ditch all-or-nothing thinking)**

This book is for anyone who’s ever felt like they “failed” a diet. It’s all about breaking the cycle of restrictive eating and learning how to eat in a way you can sustain forever.

Looking back, I wish I had figured all this out sooner. The weight loss industry thrives on confusion, but the truth is simple: eat mostly whole foods, move consistently, and fix your mindset. If you’re struggling, I promise you’re not alone - but you have to take the first step. And if you don’t know where to start? Read. Learning about nutrition and psychology made all the difference for me. Hope it helps you too.",26,1741659632.0,1200isplenty,1,1.0,False

Here are my tips. I'd love to hear what you're doing to stay sane.

Last week I hit a breaking point with the noisiness of American news and people panicking. After processing some of my stress in therapy, I decided to take some steps for my mental health:

**I uninstalled all social media apps** from my phone. It's been 5 days, and I don't miss it at all.

The next morning, **I emailed a handful of** **people I love & respect** in my church and friend group. This is what I wrote:

*Hi friends, Sorry in advance for a long email.*

*The past couple of months in our country have been chaotic, to say the least. I'm reaching out to you as I consider you part of my local ""sisterhood"" and I've been thoughtfully considering how to navigate our world and engage in conversations about tough topics while being informed but mindful of my media consumption. I'm constantly being bombarded by troubling news and hot takes, and have a feeling you may be, too. Being open and listening are two of my core values. But the division and polarizing nature of news information right now certainly has me questioning:*

* *Where are they \[fill in any name of a loved one or friend\] getting their information?* 
* *Can I trust the sources I've been listening to?* 
* *What is the ""other side"" saying?*
* *Am I losing my mind?* 

*I feel strongly that it's important to stay informed, and also that I need space in my life for peace. I've stepped away from social media for Lent even though there are many friends that I enjoy connecting with in those spaces. So part of my reaching out is an effort to maintain real connection—not knowing what it needs to look like exactly, but an open invitation to disengage in consumption that is making our anxiety rise and engage in thoughtful discussion—with a safe community. Let me know if you're interested and we can keep the conversation going.*

Sharing this because I've been deeply moved by the responses I've gotten. Some just replied, ""Yes. I'm in."" and others really opened up and were vulnerable in meaningful ways. I've had coffee/lunch with a few of them since. Some haven't replied, which is also okay. 

**I subscribed to a few Substack authors** that I respect and who do a good job with research and fact-based reporting. (I also get a few free email newsletters from media sources to stay informed.)

That is all. These things are helping me. Maybe these could help you too. Or, feel free to share steps you've taken to stay sane.

After three years of radio silence, I have emerged from the digital abyss to bring this subreddit back to life. No, this isn’t a coordinated comeback. No, I don’t have a team. It’s just me, armed with a keyboard, an unreasonable love for FOSS, and a desperate attempt to stop this place from becoming a digital ghost town.

🔄 What’s Changing?

✅ App Posts That Actually Tell You Something – No more “Here’s an app. Use it.” Expect full descriptions, sources, and direct download links. Basically, less mystery, more usability.

✅ Finding Apps Won’t Feel Like a Pointless Side Quest – I’m working on a proper tagging system (flairs, pinned lists, guides) so you can actually find what you’re looking for instead of scrolling aimlessly and questioning your life choices.

✅ Taking Suggestions… Within Reason – Yes, I’m open to user-suggested apps. No, I will not review 15 different “open-source calculator” forks unless you personally compensate me in coffee.

✅ Expanding Beyond Android – Open-source is everywhere, not just on your phone. I’m looking for people who can help post about Linux, Windows, and macOS apps. Because let’s be real—I can’t carry this entire subreddit on my back.

🛠️ What’s Next?

📌 Cleaning Up Old Posts – Some of the apps posted years ago may no longer exist. Others may now be owned by questionable companies. I’ll be updating or removing them accordingly.

Why does Monster get a line up of like 10 different flavors, and then a juice lineup *and* a coffee lineup but everytime a new flavor gets introduced we have to say goodbye to one that we've grown accustomed to being able to get?

AITA?,"Okay so maybe get your cup of tea and biscuits for this one ...

Okay so myself (31F) and my former best friend (32F), let's call her Amy were like sisters. Then things went strangely wrong and then alarmingly. 

So firstly, this girl was like my sister... I loved her and my sons saw her as their aunt. We had been single mothers together and supported each other a lot especially after I escaped a really bad dv situation. I thought she could never do anything wrong to me and we were really connected especially as we started doing tarot together and set up a little buisness. It made sense as we were always on the phone, hours every day and barely went a few hours without speaking.  Our friends joked we were married and couldn't be apart long.

Things started to go wrong when she stopped pulling her weight in the buisness. I worked constantly to the point in made me ill yet she never did anything near as much if at all most weeks.I was live 5 to 6 nights a week doing readings on tiktok...after working all day and having the kids all evening yey she would never join and left It to me after the first 2 months. Eventually I met someone through the lives who I came to start a relationship with, let's call him Ian, and he helped moderate my lives and promote the business. He even made a new logo on Amy's demands and he also felt she didn't work where as i was constantly live, promoting, making videos or talking and arranging clients. Amy did nothing accept order crysyals that took her from February all the way to November to put on the website. 

Her and Ian were friendly too and I never thought anything of it. He suddenly started being cold with me when we spoke hours every day (he lived a couple hours away) and were usually really happy to speak and were planning a future. Amy then suddenly became less communicative and he broke up with me on the Tuesday and by the Thursday she suddenly needed 'space' and time to herself. Me and him were still speaking and I was hoping to reconcile but he kept being really cruel and saying I needed to be independent and not need Amy and i wasnt indeoendent and should be alone.He kept telling me to be alone and berated me for a week whilst I heard nothing of Amy. My other friends thought it was strange as Ian confirmed they still spoke. 

Eventually time moved on and he left the picture and Amy reappeared apologetic but blaming Ian and how he impacted our friendship as she didn't like him and felt pushed out. She admitted she'd not defended me and I did question if anything happened yet she said no. This was in August.

Fast forward to October, AMy still had not participated in a live and was expecting to share reading and earn 30 pounds (half) for a private client after doing no work to get them and participating minimally. I was working so hard and kept asking for help. Eventually after months and months I snapped. I was working hours everyday and she wasn't doing anything and kept saying ""we'd pull it back later"" or she'd do other things than the live but didn't do much accept edit the website suddenly to a completely different colour scheme that was deemed a 'bad myspace' look by other friends and customers. I was so frustrated. I worked all day and she only worked mornings and hard a partner. I tried to meet in the middle and asked her to craft candles as I also made all stock we sold as well as reading and I carried on the resin crafts and lives but could she make videos as well. Eventually I snapped and bluntly started asking what are you doing business wise today? And saying what needed to be done that day so what could she do. Thus began the almighty downfall...

She begant to get distant and hard to get in touch with. She wouldn't hang out as friends and did very minimal posts and handful of tiktoks. Still wouldn't go live and share reading work. I was never nasty but I was becoming ill from overworking. She denied not working despite taking months off  and never participating in readings. I eventually snapped after she finally came in a live for the first time in months and suddenly left embarassingly after 20 minutes. I said it was unprofessional and her excuse was her partner came home but I didn't feel that was enough of a reason given they had a whole house and it had been promoted over a week and our first together live in 6 months. I said I was eorrief for her as she wouldn't socialise and I wanted to spend time with her even for a quick coffee. She responded by ignoring me then saying no point in hanging out for 2 hours and she did want to be in the buisness but couldn't do more than 2 lives and then messaged my friend across the street for a coffee 🤔

After this she left the business by her own choice. I asked her to stay but she wouldn't. I had spent days chasing her as we had a fayre and she would instantly read then take hours to respond or answer for me to decide and not help. I didn't have her stock of crysyals and I spent hours making up for the stock. She bluntly messaged she was out and her sister and boyfriend sent me nasty messages. I tried to stay her friend but she ignored me. She decided to sell her crystals and I promoted her business on ny website with links yet she blocked me from seeing it. I tried so hard to be nice and  I sent her son a Christmas present yet she ignored me still. I left the door open to be friends but she wasnt intereated and then she decided to make my life hell.

It started a couple of weeks later when she went into my old place of work and approached a friend to say we had fallen out and other things and this was then relayed to my mother out of concern. I brushed it off and asked her not to do this and just not discuss me as I didn't want drama and wanted us both to be happy. This continued to escalate despite me never doing anything to her. It was just mean girl things at first... posts cutting me out of memories, messaging my friends she only knew and saw through me (yes red flag I was her only real friend) and then she Eventually stole from my PayPal that was previously shared. It was only 15 pounds but was Petty.  Then it got serious.  She reached out to my close friend who lived opposite we will call shelly, who is pretty temperamental. She told her a littany if lies including I hit my child, the kids are scared of me and I was having a 4 year affair with our other neighbours across the road who I'd been friends with well over a decade and his Mrs was my bestfriend who Amy asked for coffee... we will call her Hayley. 

Shelley stormed in my house one night after ignoring me for weeks to accuse me of this affair.  I was beyond shocked. i Eventually convinced her of the truth that we were just friends and I wouldn't do that to Hayley. A week later I went around and we had a drink and she apologised properly. The lies all came out including that Amy and Ian has been 'inappropriately messaging'but only so Amy could 'prove'i couldn't trust him. I just said I found it funny as it was the first I heard of this proof. I brushed it off hurt but didn't react as I'd already blocked Amy after a month of her games of blocking unblocking and slagging me off. I didn't want the drama and I believed in karma. My main concern was the lies I had hit my child and shelly Amy and Amy's sister had been in some sort of group chat constant slagging me off for weeks. I was hurt but just wanted to move on and forgave shelly. 

Next thing I saw my friend who is friends with Hayley. They had a another friend poppy who they were going to dinnner with later and somehow Amy had befriended her and managed an invite from her. I knew more drama and lies were coming and I told Hayley about the accusations and she laughed it off. She foundnit ridiculous. The meal happened and Amy seemed to behave but my 2 friends weren't keen on her and saw it all as 'games' and had no intention of seeing her again. I thought it may be over but 2 days later my phone blows up with nasty texts from Hayley and calls (I blocked her on everything but text as we never spoke that way and forgot) accusing me of ringing the police on her off a welfare check. I still dont knownif this really happened or just more lies. I told her clearly I hadn't and to leave me alone ... I hadn't rang the police just like I don't hit my child. Shelly then messaged me saying Amy messaged her calling her a liar (I never named hayley) and she'd never said I hit my children. I confirmed with the police I never rang them and forwarded on the email to Amy and as she had blocked Shelley, I thought it was done. 

Nope it just got worse. 

The next day, my door was nearly kicked in by a very angry Hayley. We were terrified as didn't know who it was initially so I hid upstairs with the kids and then heard her screaming I was a 'slag'. It turns out the lovely Amy had been to visit Poppy  to show her 'screenshots' of my affair. And wow these were fake screenshots... turns out its very easy to do. They were insane!  There was dirty conversations between myself and Hayleys partner that never happened. Hayley blinded by rage and eithout checkungz threw her partner out and all my friends stopped speaking to me.

Weirdly, Hayley and her partner had previously set me up with his brother. We had a thing on an off for a few months and were still in touch. Brother works with police and is extremely intelligent and checked my phone to disprove the so called screnshots and confirm the truth. It was violating having my ex read hours of conversations including that about Ian and even things I'd said To my friend about him. He confirmed I was telling the truth but Hahley qa busy telling me to go die and everyone else had iced me out so I didn't know what to do. I had nasty posts on my business page and messages and all over a guy who was just a friend!

2 days ago Hayley asked to speak to me. Finally calmly we spoke and she believed me . I explained about Beth's behaviour and what has been happening. I also explained I don't think I'd be set up by my ""lover"" 
To date his brother and so on. She did however think that before we were friends that I was too close with her partner and when I escaped dv I leaned on him too much and she felt it was an 'emotional affair'. I accepted this an apologised . There was never any sexual intent and I wa slaone on a newly built street with him as my only friend close by who understood as we both had PTSD. I didn't mean to cross any line and live had moved on years since and I was so close to her and me and him had drifted apart. We've began speaking again and (touch wood) Amy has gone silent. 

Currently Hayley and our mutual friend are speaking to me atm again not quite normally but getting there. Hayley's partner is still kicked out and due to other issues she doesn't know what to do or if she wants him home. She did confirm thought that Amy and Ian did have something happen between them and lot more than texting. I didn't want to hear the details but now I know Amy ruined my relstionship, didn't work and quit the business to then bully me and try isolate me. She seemed to want to take my friends and have my boyfriend when she has her own partner and my friends were friendly to her too.I can never ever get why or understand as still I have done nothing to her.

I don't know what I should do next but I did see police and they advised legal action. I can't take anymore drama. I've probably missed bits but I think that is the key breakdown and I will update.

I want to be as open and honest as possible in this post so it may be a bit lengthy. Bear with me if possible.

I am currently undergoing a lot of life changes, especially in terms of my fluctuating mental health issues, and trying my best to find my way in the world. During this time, I could use a friend, but I feel a bit burnt out trying to do so because a lot of times connections, especially online, are short-lived, fickle, and quite honestly, underwhelming. I think it's obvious that we are all here for something, be it a relationship, friendship, or otherwise, but connections tend to come and go for everyone. Well. I would appreciate a connection with someone interested in something long-term, consistent, and meaningful. No more adding someone on this or that app just to talk once or twice, and never talking again, or slowly losing contact. No random ghosting. No dry texting or back-to-back ""How's the weather?"" type of conversation. I mean, seriously, how often can you ask someone ""What's up?"" or ""How are you today?"" before it gets a little old?

With this all being said, I would love to meet someone who, as I have said, would be willing to be in it for the long haul and dedicate time and effort to establishing and developing a friendship. My ideal person is a fellow woman (or fem) who is roughly around my age group, the mid-20s to early 30s, preferably in North America, so there is no/minimal time zone difference, and interested in having an engaging friendship. Big bonus points if you are also queer, but this isn't required. Unfortunately, endless texting is not for me, and while I am down to text throughout the day and discuss whatever, whenever, I prefer bonding with others primarily through shared activities, specifically gaming, and speaking on the phone. Other than gaming, I also enjoy watching shows and films, listening to music, and other types of activities, but I cannot keep up with someone who doesn't enjoy being in a call together.

A little bit about me is that I am 25, bisexual, agender fem (AFAB), happily taken by a lovely individual, and from the Southeastern United States. Currently, I am a final-semester student pursuing an internship and expecting to graduate in May, after that, I plan to pursue a job within my field. In the meantime, I fill my free time and life with things that feel meaningful and special to me, namely dedicating time to my passions and hobbies, trying to develop healthy friendships and creating a ""found family"", advocating for myself as someone who is neurodivergent and psychiatrically ill, using my feminity to express myself, and finding peace and acceptance in witchcraft and Paganism. If you're curious about my path, I'm a Celtic pagan and eclectic witch. 

My main interests are collecting trinkets, the fine arts, reading manga/webtoons, animated series, watching an obscene amount of YouTube, alternative fashion, and missing 2014 Tumblr

As for gaming, I love all sorts of games, but my favorites tend to be shooters, simulators, story games, and horror survival. Some notable series/games I've enjoyed are Silent Hill 2, Alice: Madness Returns, Catherine, and Coffee Talk. I can enjoy just about any game if the story is interesting enough, the graphics are pretty enough, or the lore is deep enough!

I would love to play the following games with people

* Overwatch 2
* Marvel Rivals
* Fortnite
* Evil Dead: The Game
* Apex Legends
* Back 4 Blood
* Phasmophobia
* Dead by Daylight
* Paladins
* SMITE
* Pokemon UNITE
* Splatoon 2 & 3

Well, if you are still here and reading this incredibly long post (possibly too long?) and would be interested in chatting further, I would love to hear from you!

So, this happened a few days ago, and I’m still cringing at myself.

I was out grabbing coffee when I ran into my ex from a few years back. We had a pretty messy breakup, and we hadn’t talked since. She looked happy, though, and she had a stroller with her. She smiled and said, “Hey! It’s been forever! How have you been?”

Now, I was caught off guard but trying to play it cool. I noticed the baby in the stroller and, in a moment of sheer stupidity, I blurted out: “Oh wow… is this yours? …Damn, that’s an ugly baby.”

The moment it left my mouth, I knew I had royally fed up*. I didn’t even mean to say it! I think I was so shocked at running into her that my brain just short-circuited, and instead of saying something neutral like, “Oh, congrats!” or even just shutting the hell up, I insulted her child.

Her face went from happy nostalgia to pure rage in about 0.5 seconds. She snapped, “Excuse me?! What the hell is wrong with you?” and I just stood there, realizing I had no way to recover. I panicked and tried to backtrack with, “I mean, all babies look kinda weird at first—like, they grow into their features, y’know?”

Yeah, that didn’t help.

She just gave me a disgusted look, muttered something about me being the same immature a**hole I always was, and stormed off. I’m pretty sure she’s telling everyone she knows about how I insulted her baby. I still feel like a total idiot, and I don’t think I can ever show my face at that coffee shop again.

TL;DR: Ran into my ex, saw her baby, accidentally called it ugly, and now I’m probably blacklisted from our shared social circle.",59,1741659158.0,tifu,60,0.69,False

when i was 12-14 my dad forced me to go to gym everyday and count my calories (i was never overweight 5’5 and 55kg) this resulted in an eating disorder and along with my emetophobia caused extreme anxiety when it came to foods and for 2 years i would only eat canned soup, ice cream and anything with a soft texture. i have a bad sense of taste so texture is very important to me. this year i have been trying out solid foods it has been going okay but some days are worse then others.

moving on i had been prescribed lexapro for my anxiety and depression after suffering for 8 years i was able to calm myself down quicker from panic attacks but i also found out i have ibs so everytime i consume somthing my stomach hurts like a bitch and my anxiety is slowly creeping back in i have had 2 panic attacks just today and i have only had an iced coffee in the past 2 days which is making my stomach hurt worse. i have been depressed and been lousy on my antidepressants but i honestly am so tired of feeling like this as soon as i feel like i am getting better i bounce right back to square one. sometimes i wonder if i throw up if my fear will go away but when it comes down to it i dont know.

1j8g3g2,https://www.reddit.com/r/barista/s/96xU6dGGlh,UPDATE: Advice for not wasting the day after opening shift,"First off, thank you all SO MUCH for your very insightful advice. Thanks to you guys I have been able to make use of my afternoons! 

Many of you suggested not going home, or just keeping busy until the evening. I’ve been walking around the neighborhood, going to the gym, going grocery shopping, etc etc after my shift to put off going home. Or, I will have a plan for what I need to do when I get home.

My rule for myself for when I get home is DON’T SIT ON THE COUCH OR LAY DOWN, as sitting down on the comfy couch triggers sleepiness, I’ve noticed. Additionally I won’t go on my phone and start mindlessly scrolling, or else I could get locked in for way too long. If anything I’ll put on a YouTube video to listen to while doing other things. 

Someone mentioned getting chores and tasks done in the afternoon so you have more time on your days off. Framing it this way has helped me A LOT! I feel like I’m buying time on my day off by pushing through and getting as much done as I can in my afternoons. 

I also have been watching my caffeine intake during my shift to make sure I don’t crash, trying my best to limit myself to one drink or double shot per shift. Then at the end of my shift I will make myself a chai or a matcha, something with less caffeine than a coffee. 

I have tried napping with varied success. Most times I try to nap I end up sleeping way too long. This past week I did accidentally nap once (broke my don’t sit down rule) and the only reason it was a quickie is because my partner came over and woke me up. It sounds like some of you are disciplined enough to wake up after 20 minutes - 1 hour, but that’s just not me. I’m a sleepy girl and will snooze my alarm and sleep as long as my sleepy brain wants to, so napping is a no for me personally. 

One thing I’m considering is trying to wake up and go to bed at the same time consistently. This would mean waking up before 6AM on my days off, so not sure about that. Maybe I’ll allow a deviation of one hour, and “sleep in” until 7AM and go to bed at 11PM.

Ideally, I’d feel most comfortable connecting with those 28+ who have a similar vibe.

If any of this resonates with you, feel free to drop me a message! Looking forward to meeting some amazing people in Galway. :)

I want new plasma donors to be more informed and become safer donors. I have solid educational advice for new plasma donors who may be considering to try it out, earn extra money, and save lives:\
    • Plasma is 92% water and the rest is protein elements and electrolytes. With proper protein consumption and electrolyte drinks, your body is able to fully replenish the plasma you lost from donating within 24 to 48 hours. And that's a key reason there's a 48 hour wait in-between your two possible weekly donations.\
    • The plasma is separated from your blood and your red blood cells are returned to you in cycles.\
\
    • Per FDA regulations, you're only allowed to donate plasma twice in a 7 day period, with a 48 hour wait in-between those two times. Don't risk your health by hopping around to different plasma donation centers to circumvent these regulations, and you may get caught if you do.\
    1. Eat a meal high in protein 2-3 hours before donating, but your plasma protein levels depend on what you ate the day before.\
    2. Drink plenty of water and/or non-caffeinated juice before donating to stay hydrated. It's important to stay hydrated at least the day before, and the day of your donation.\
    3. Avoid caffeine such as in coffee or soda before donating or you may get nauseous and vomit or faint during your donation. \
    4. No alcohol 24 hours before, and for a little while after donating. \
    5. No exercising for at least 6 hours after donating as it can put too much stress on the vein. \
    6. Some people get away with smoking or vaping nicotine before and after donating, but it's recommended not to for 2 hours before and after. The nicotine can raise your heart's pulse rate. \
    7. If your pulse rate is 100 or above, you'll be able to do a vitals retake after a 15 minute wait. But if it's 100 or higher again you'll be deferred for the day. Taking sort of slower but deep breaths for 10 to 15 minutes before getting your vitals taken should help lower your pulse rate. If your pulse rate is an issue, listen to ""Pink Noise"" or ""Green Noise"" at a low volume before donating which may help reduce your pulse rate, along with its effect on lowering your blood pressure. \
    8. There is a risk of getting a blown vein if the worker is having a hard time finding your vein when they're sticking you with the needle or if you have small veins. You may get deferred until your vein heals if that happens. But it's ok, your body is able to regenerate your veins with a process called Angiogenesis. \
    9. There is a risk of blood clots, but when your blood is constantly moving through the machine it prevents that from happening. \
    10. You may be subject to drug screening. The drug screening tests for methamphetamines, cocaine, and heroin. Certain pharma prescription meds may show up as a false positive so you'll want to let the plasma center know what meds you're taking. Testing positive for these drugs can result in a permanent deferral from donating plasma. \
    11. A sample of your blood will be drawn periodically to test for certain sexually transmitted infections (STIs). A positive test will result in either a temporary or permanent deferral from donating plasma. If you've ever been diagnosed or received treatment for HIV/AIDS, Hepatitis B (HBV) or Hepatitis C (HCV) you will be permanently deferred from donating plasma.\
\
  • Wait a few hours before taking the bandage wrap off of your arm after donating.\
    • It's recommended to use Vitamin E oil/Mineral oil on the needle site for the puncture area to heal better. A Q-tip can be used to apply it easier. I simply dip the Q-Tip in the bottle, but never dip the used cotton back into the bottle.\
    • Frequently donating over a prolonged period of time may lead to your body having decreased vitamin D levels.\
    • Red meats are particularly high in the protein vitamins and minerals found in plasma. \
    • Personally, I take a Now brand Vitamin D supplement that contains vitamin D3, Calcium, Magnesium, and Zinc. But I only take a half a dose, 1 gel capsule instead of 2, since I get these from eating meats and other foods as well. It's bad for your health if you take too much of these vitamins and minerals over time. I also take an Iron supplement once or twice a week. I also try to drink a protein shake before donating. Just to be safe.\
\
Donating Plasma with Managed Diabetes\
\
Individuals with well-controlled diabetes can contribute to plasma donation, but certain criteria need to be met:\
Absence of Complications: This means no existing diabetic complications affecting your kidneys, heart, blood vessels, or eyes.\
Insulin Independence: If you rely on insulin for diabetes management, a three-month waiting period is required after using needles for non-prescribed medications. Additionally, you must be free of symptoms or treatment needs related to blood sugar fluctuations (high or low) for the past three months.\
    1. Healthy Feet: Active foot ulcers requiring medical attention will disqualify you from donation. \
    2. Steady Balance: You shouldn't experience dizziness or lightheadedness upon standing. \
    3. Type 1 Consideration: For Type 1 diabetics, eating within two hours of donation is mandatory. \

I was paranoid it might be my heater core but I opened up the side to see the heater core and there were no leaks. Carpet is dry. I thought I saw coolant on the mat yesterday but nothing today. I feel like I’m going crazy. 

My coolant level has not dropped. I have not overheated. But there is a sweet smell out of one vent. Only one vent. But it could be the stupid air freshener my wife uses. She also notoriously spills iced coffee. Is there a definitive way to figure out if my heater core is leaking? Could there be another reason. Head gasket?

1j8fu6k,https://www.reddit.com/r/AITAH/comments/1j8fu6k/aitah_for_wanting_to_be_friends_with_my_neighbor/,AITAH for wanting to be friends with my neighbor,"My husband (M29) and myself (F28) moved to a new neighborhood in July of last year and met our neighbors who were new to the state and around our same ages. We hung out with them and once at our house, then a fall event with some other friends, and had a cup of coffee just the wives. 
I am a new mom to a 10 month old and some of our friends since having a baby kind of distanced themselves since we couldn’t go out or do things like we used to. So I’ve been trying to meet new people and the best way for me to communicate with people is usually via text so I can reply when my son isn’t needing me right at that moment. 
The last time I hung out with my neighbor was in January for coffee, early February we briefly texted about her plans to go to a sale that weekend, I replied to her text with a question and it was never answered. 
Fast forward to last week, the last weekend of February. We ran into the neighbors walking their dog and briefly caught up and everything seemed friendly. 
The next day I texted the wife neighbor asking if they’d like to come hang out on the patio and have lunch and let our dogs play and watch my son play. I texted her 2x in the 11am hour, then checked in at 12:30, realized via a social media post they were busy at a thing she posted about and texted to congratulate them, Then I dropped it. 
At 2pm my son and I were playing on the swings in our year which means we have a clear view to my neighbors back yard without trying to. Their dog was watching us and I took a video of him watching us and sent it to her. I had not gotten a single reply all day. 
The next evening I got a long and angry text from said neighbor. “I didn't respond because we were busy. I didn't like the fact that you were filming into my backyard, for some reason it made me feel uncomfortable and like my privacy was invaded. 
I've voiced it many times that I value my space and that I get overwhelmed/stressed easily. I work two jobs, I'm trying to get art ready while building up our art studio, and I'm trying to find time for myself and w Husband. I need you to respect my boundaries. I need you to be more patience with my responses. I have no urgency in responding to humdrum things when I have so much more going on.
I would appreciate it if you would be a little more patient with waiting for my responses because I'm overwhelmed as it is and I don't have time to deal with this. My time is my time, and I don't owe it to anyone.”

I showed my husband and he said I should’ve never tried to be friends with her to begin with and she is obviously a very aggressive person. I did apologize to her for the video and let her know it wouldn’t happen again. I haven’t gotten a reply and that a week ago. But now I feel like TAH for trying to be friends and feel rejected for being friendly. 

So- AITAH

Update: I have had a few people mention her comment about saying she has voiced her boundaries and need for privacy in her message. I should’ve been clear. There has never been a boundaries conversation, she made a comment once about privacy when we discussed liking that we didn’t have neighbors behind our homes. 
She spoke with one of MY friends afterwords saying this message she sent was her “setting her boundaries.” So it was the first time any of this has been “discussed”. 

I am also not a SAHM, I work full time remotely, and the day I texted her was a Sunday. ",4,1741658063.0,AITAH,23,1.0,False

Did I cause permanent damage?,"I (20F) am a singer. I don’t take anything extra like vitamins or medication, and my diet is mostly whole food ingredients with no sugary beverages and rarely coffee. I have been chronically dehydrated for several years by my own fault, but for the past several weeks, I’ve been drinking about six cups of water or herbal tea a day.

Last week, I strained a muscle in my neck by laying on my stomach watching a screen in front of me with a pillow and my arm tucked under my chin for too long. I don’t know if this is what hurt my voice too, but I thought that was all until I started singing warmups and found my range limited. Low notes were causing discomfort/low level pain, and my high notes sounded unusually breathy, like a regular note but with a clear hissing sound behind them. There was a constant feeling of tension in my throat and tiny sharp stabs of pain (2/10 intensity). And it hasn’t improved at all. I’ve made the mistake of trying light warmups each day, but I think that only agitated things. 

I can’t talk, sing, or even hum without it causing discomfort and a low level of sharp pain. The pain is concentrated in the area on either side of my upper trachea (more right side than left), and the constant tension feels concentrated right between, in the trachea right behind the area under my chin. Currently, I’m trying not to  make any noise unless I have to.

What is going on and what can I do? Did I cause permanent damage or can this heal, and how long will it take?

Also, some vocal background if it’s helpful:
For the first decade and a half of my life, I never learned to support my voice properly so even talking eventually always resulted in tension and discomfort. I started singing two years ago and learned to support properly, fixing the problem. But low notes have always been an issue and my technique shaky there.

1j8fg15,https://i.redd.it/x2ai5zf7syne1.jpeg,Tired of hype without products or potential? Try $kendu!,"Kendu Inu ($KENDU) is an absolute beast, highly underrated and undervalued, and moving faster than 99% of crypto projects. While most meme coins rely on hype and vaporware, Kendu is actually building tangible assets. It is not just about digital ideas; it offers physical products that people can buy, hold, and use.

At a sub-$10M market cap, Kendu’s team and community operate like a multi-billion-dollar company. Most crypto projects at this level barely function, yet Kendu delivers results that would make any tech startup or investor take notice.

Kendu Energy and Kendu Coffee are real-world products that extend beyond mere speculation. Kendu Energy is a genuine energy drink brand that consumers purchase and enjoy, and Kendu Coffee is available on store shelves, bridging the gap between the crypto world and everyday commerce. Few meme coins achieve such product-market fit.

Kendu has already achieved a $300M+ market cap in the past, even before introducing these real-world products. With a stronger foundation and growing adoption, reaching a billion-dollar market cap is not only possible but a natural progression.

This asset is among the most undervalued in crypto today. With a market cap below $10M, a history of reaching $300M, real-world growth, and a powerful network effect, it presents a potential setup for 100x to 1,000x returns. Many meme coins that reached billion-dollar valuations did so on far less substance.

The community behind Kendu is relentless and focused, driving significant momentum. Similar to the way Dogecoin and Shiba Inu caught fire online, this strong network effect is essential for major price action.

In essence, Kendu Inu is like the meme coin version of a Tesla moment. Most people do not yet fully grasp its potential, much like early skeptics of Tesla. Kendu is evolving from a mere meme to a project delivering tangible results, and its upside potential from here is enormous.

I want new plasma donors to be more informed and become safer donors. I have solid educational advice for new plasma donors who may be considering to try it out, earn extra money, and save lives:\
    • Plasma is 92% water and the rest is protein elements and electrolytes. With proper protein consumption and electrolyte drinks, your body is able to fully replenish the plasma you lost from donating within 24 to 48 hours. And that's a key reason there's a 48 hour wait in-between your two possible weekly donations.\
    • The plasma is separated from your blood and your red blood cells are returned to you in cycles.\
\
    • Per FDA regulations, you're only allowed to donate plasma twice in a 7 day period, with a 48 hour wait in-between those two times. Don't risk your health by hopping around to different plasma donation centers to circumvent these regulations, and you may get caught if you do.\
    1. Eat a meal high in protein 2-3 hours before donating, but your plasma protein levels depend on what you ate the day before.\
    2. Drink plenty of water and/or non-caffeinated juice before donating to stay hydrated. It's important to stay hydrated at least the day before, and the day of your donation.\
    3. Avoid caffeine such as in coffee or soda before donating or you may get nauseous and vomit or faint during your donation. \
    4. No alcohol 24 hours before, and for a little while after donating. \
    5. No exercising for at least 6 hours after donating as it can put too much stress on the vein. \
    6. Some people get away with smoking or vaping nicotine before and after donating, but it's recommended not to for 2 hours before and after. The nicotine can raise your heart's pulse rate. \
    7. If your pulse rate is 100 or above, you'll be able to do a vitals retake after a 15 minute wait. But if it's 100 or higher again you'll be deferred for the day. Taking sort of slower but deep breaths for 10 to 15 minutes before getting your vitals taken should help lower your pulse rate. If your pulse rate is an issue, listen to ""Pink Noise"" or ""Green Noise"" at a low volume before donating which may help reduce your pulse rate, along with its effect on lowering your blood pressure. \
    8. There is a risk of getting a blown vein if the worker is having a hard time finding your vein when they're sticking you with the needle or if you have small veins. You may get deferred until your vein heals if that happens. But it's ok, your body is able to regenerate your veins with a process called Angiogenesis. \
    9. There is a risk of blood clots, but when your blood is constantly moving through the machine it prevents that from happening. \
    10. You may be subject to drug screening. The drug screening tests for methamphetamines, cocaine, and heroin. Certain pharma prescription meds may show up as a false positive so you'll want to let the plasma center know what meds you're taking. Testing positive for these drugs can result in a permanent deferral from donating plasma. \
    11. A sample of your blood will be drawn periodically to test for certain sexually transmitted infections (STIs). A positive test will result in either a temporary or permanent deferral from donating plasma. If you've ever been diagnosed or received treatment for HIV/AIDS, Hepatitis B (HBV) or Hepatitis C (HCV) you will be permanently deferred from donating plasma.\
\
  • Wait a few hours before taking the bandage wrap off of your arm after donating.\
    • It's recommended to use Vitamin E oil/Mineral oil on the needle site for the puncture area to heal better. A Q-tip can be used to apply it easier. I simply dip the Q-Tip in the bottle, but never dip the used cotton back into the bottle.\
    • Frequently donating over a prolonged period of time may lead to your body having decreased vitamin D levels.\
    • Red meats are particularly high in the protein vitamins and minerals found in plasma. \
    • Personally, I take a Now brand Vitamin D supplement that contains vitamin D3, Calcium, Magnesium, and Zinc. But I only take a half a dose, 1 gel capsule instead of 2, since I get these from eating meats and other foods as well. It's bad for your health if you take too much of these vitamins and minerals over time. I also take an Iron supplement once or twice a week. I also try to drink a protein shake before donating. Just to be safe.\
\
Donating Plasma with Managed Diabetes\
\
Individuals with well-controlled diabetes can contribute to plasma donation, but certain criteria need to be met:\
Absence of Complications: This means no existing diabetic complications affecting your kidneys, heart, blood vessels, or eyes.\
Insulin Independence: If you rely on insulin for diabetes management, a three-month waiting period is required after using needles for non-prescribed medications. Additionally, you must be free of symptoms or treatment needs related to blood sugar fluctuations (high or low) for the past three months.\
    1. Healthy Feet: Active foot ulcers requiring medical attention will disqualify you from donation. \
    2. Steady Balance: You shouldn't experience dizziness or lightheadedness upon standing. \
    3. Type 1 Consideration: For Type 1 diabetics, eating within two hours of donation is mandatory. \

Today's the first day I haven't texted you since I met you. Isn't it weird how it went from being something I couldn't live without, to being a compulsion I placed quietly to the side?

I miss you. I definitely still love you. But it feels like an acceptance now, that you are going to go and find new women to get under to get over me (good luck) and I will sit here and deal with all the complicated emotions our breakup has caused.

That was always our problem. I am harshly emotional, completely incapable of feeling anything in halves. Partially my BPD, partially being a Pisces, partially just who I am and have always been. But it culminates in a dogged determinedness to talk about how I feel, ask for reassurance, look for comfort. You resented me for that, because you handle your emotions with drugs and alcohol. Coping strategies designed to numb them so you simply don't feel. 

I think I was always looking for the you beneath everything. The you I love is the person you were when you first woke up, grumbling at me for waking you and waiting for me to offer you breakfast and coffee. Ten minutes later you would be sat on the edge of my bed, naked, hunched over the rolling tray I bought you for Christmas, making a joke about how you were rolling. Eye roll, laugh, quip back. If I questioned whether you really needed to numb yourself the second you woke up, it wouldn't end well. 

But there's no point expecting you to change, or be someone you are not. Because I equally loved you for that, the same stubborn determinedness that echoes in my own soul. You wanted me to read your mind and make sense, I wanted you to stop slowly killing yourself and try to understand. Neither was going to happen, ever. 

Today I sat on a train and listened to the playlist I made you back last summer. I think I had my doubts even then, but we still tried. I'm glad we did, don't get me wrong, but it was always too difficult. We had sexual chemistry, we wanted to pretend it would work out even though we had such fundamental incompatiblities.

I look forward to meeting you on the playing field as a friend, my darling. Even though I know when I see you next, my stomach will still twist like it's the day after everything, and I'm crying in my friend's arms. But I'm making it through, the only casualties my hair and my bank account.

Missing you as always. Loving you as I always will.

I’m so fed up—I just need to rant here. I’m a female student; I study, fast every day, have a part-time job, cook, and go to Taraweeh every night.

All I want afterwards is to have a nice coffee at a cute café with my friends and study.

But every time, more than half the tables are occupied by MEN?! Since when did sipping lattes and giggling become a male activity? And it’s always the girliest cafés too. These men leave Taraweeh to sit in a café, gossip, or eavesdrop on ours—don’t think we don’t notice. It makes us uncomfortable.

I see aunties struggling to find a seat while groups of guys hog all the chairs with their cookie-crumble pink drinks.

I paid off some bills, put some aside for savings, and then used about $1,200 to buy a top-of-the-line espresso machine (Breville Oracle Touch, if you’re curious). I’ve always loved making coffee at home, and I figured, why not finally upgrade?

Well, my husband thinks this was the dumbest purchase ever. He keeps making little jabs about how “we could’ve used that money for something useful,” like upgrading our kitchen appliances or putting extra toward our mortgage. Mind you, we are not struggling financially. All our bills are paid, we have savings, and I still contributed to our shared expenses. But because I didn’t use the money for something HE thinks is valuable, I’m now getting passive-aggressive comments every morning when I make my latte.

I get that in a marriage, big purchases should be discussed, but this wasn’t our shared money....it was mine. And frankly, I don’t see why treating myself is such a crime when I’m usually the frugal one.

All one-one-one, not in a group setting. He always says yes to these things unless he's busy. 

The thing is, none of these were ""dates,"" just sorta hang-outs. Which is fine, but it makes things kinda unclear. 

I feel like I'm being clear that I like him. I initiate a lot of our convos, I send him funny posts all the time. He would know that I like him at this point, right? 

I can't tell if he'd also be interested in me. He sits next to me in every class, he always says he had a good time when we hang out. But he's never the one to ask to go do something. Literally never. I've always been the one. 

I know guys are usually oblivious to this kind of thing. But we've hung out alone several times and I try to talk to him as much as possible. He has to get the hint, right?

I know this could all be solved if I just asked him out. But I feel like if he knows I like him, he doesn't feel the same way and just doesn't wanna say anything.

We started talking because we shared a class and kept kind of in touch. I had a girlfriend at the time that was incredibly jealous so we couldn't really talk much or study together. 

Fast forward to the next semester and me and my ex broke up. I reached out to the friend and we hung out multiple times. We got coffee together, hiked like twice, I took her out to an Italian restaurant, and we talked for hours and hours that night. If we saw each other at school, we'd be hanging out till class without question. I even think she gave me a hint that she might be interested in me (she said something about never having a boyfriend). In between her saying that and going out to dinner, I'd gotten back with my ex.

Now I'm single again and, friends or more, I really miss her company. Except, every time I've texted her since, she ends up leaving me on read. Should I ask why we don't talk anymore? I wouldn't say we were ever super close, but it doesn't seem like she keeps anyone in her life super close except for family and two best friends. Is it weird to ask?

***""AI's here to save the banking day""—or is it just pretending to be the hero before unveiling its takeover plans?*** As financial institutions grapple with keeping up with AI's rapid evolution, Palantir has teamed up with TWG to sweeten the deal. Their goal? To make AI adoption as seamless as a hot knife through butter in banks.

But wait, it's not all roses. While Palantir's cybersecurity pedigree is reassuring, does coupling AI and banks open Pandora's box of risks and vulnerabilities? After all, AI doesn't sip coffee during board meetings; it processes colossal data sets with ruthless efficiency. It's the latest cog in the banking machinery—one that's also learning to do jobs humans counted as exclusive to their resume.

Here's where it gets interesting: Palantir's venture wants to be the all-in-one solution, a single product for everything, promising to nix the pesky need for 300 different AI vendors. One product to automate them all, it seems.

Now, while fascinating, the notion of AI as a ""labor source"" raises eyebrows. Are banks ready to see AI not just as a tool but as the ultimate team member, performing on par with human intelligence? And if AI starts climbing the corporate ladder, what roles will humans play in this brave new world of banking?

So Redditors, where do you stand on this AI revolution in banking? Are we entering an era where AI is the pliable savior or the slippery slope to overdependence and potential security threats? 🤔 Join the conversation with your thoughts below!",1,1741656162.0,AiKilledMyStartUp,0,1.0,False

I’ve had a string of bad managers who have been extremely bullying and pretty much destroyed my career progression and who have caused me a lot of stress so I ideally want a smooth and pain free summer

Job 1: at a financial services firm in the City 

Pros: a 12 month contract which means I wouldn’t be worried about job applying for a while. The commute is literally three tube rides away so I’d manage to have a life outside of work particularly in the summer. I do a lot of evening activities eg gym/meeting friends so this is very convenient. Very city location with lots of coffee shops/eateries. I’ve usually worked in non exciting  places in bad locations

Cons: haven’t worked in financial services before so I’m worried about potentially not passing my probation. I also am quite used to having a lot of freedom in my roles (eg if I need to do an errand at 3pm as long as the work is done nobody minds) but the culture here is very stuffy. The contract also states ‘monitoring’ which was a bit of a shock. The glassdoor reviews aren’t great and said that it can be catty and if you have a bad manager it’s awful. 

I wasn’t necessarily sure I’d get on with the manager as she kept checking the clock during my interview and seemed like she could be quite difficult to work with (I’ve had a bad streak of being managed by older women who seem to get annoyed I am younger)
It’s also a far smaller team so less resource and would have to pick up more work 


Job 2: a uni on the London/Kent border

Picture this: An eight-year-old in Beijing sparring with a chess-playing AI on his living room coffee table. No, it's not a scene from a sci-fi movie, but a peek into the reality of China's AI-driven future.

Timmy is your average kid, except his playmate is a robot, one programmed to play chess and Go—and even banter in Mandarin. Timmy's little digital teacher not only plays games but is part of China's grand scheme to lead the AI revolution. Yep, you heard it right. China plans to become the supreme tech overlord by 2030, and AI is the Excalibur in its tech arsenal.

But how is China planning to turn itself into the realm of AI kings? Money, honey. With a whopping 10 trillion yuan earmarked over the next decade and a half to outpace its competitors—including a particular North American rival—the stakes are high. So high, in fact, that the AI in question, DeepSeek, is starting to sweat under the spotlight—outperforming even its Silicon Valley counterparts and triggering a half-smug, half-oh-no reaction.

And to top it off, Chinese startups are thriving on a cocktail of aggression and innovation, pumping out thousands of AI firms now grappling for supremacy. They're crafting everything from smart toys teaching coding to toddlers, to humanoid robots so advanced they're practically auditioning for the next installment of ""The Terminator.""

Yet, beyond the buzz of innovation, there's a shadow of suspicion. Remember Orwell's Big Brother? Well, some critics fear that AI could turn into a state tool, hoarding data faster than you can say ""TikTok ban"".

But as you kick back with this little saga, here's a question to ponder: Are we witnessing the rise of a tech superpower or a flash in the pan that’ll fizzle under geopolitical pressure?

So, AI is guzzling more electricity than your average electric dinosaur. We’re not just talking about your toaster-singeing-wires type of consumption; this is 33 times more juice than other software. That's right, by 2030, AI might be tagged as the household rogue gulping more electricity than all of America’s fridges combined. 

**The Power Dilemma**  
In Utah County, AI data centers are popping up like coffee shops in Seattle. Yet, the question is: Can the power grid support this technological tidal wave? To say it gently, AI centers slurp power like a marathoner at a water station. In fact, a single data center can sap the energy that would otherwise power up to 100,000 homes. Scale that, and you’re staring at a nation where data centers could command 9% of total electricity by the decade's end.

**Utilities on the Hunt for Solutions**  
Enter Operation Gigawatt, Utah’s state-backed effort to double its energy output without flipping the planet to toast. It’s promising a future involving nuclear, geothermal, maybe even solar-Cup-o-Joe (okay, not that last one, but you get it). Meanwhile, other states are reopening ancient energy relics like the Three Mile Island nuclear plant, the site of a significant 1979 oopsie-moment.

Utilities are stuck between a watt and a hard place: revamping coal plants isn’t exactly the green fairy tale everyone wants, and true-blue renewables aren’t coming online fast enough. It’s a bit of a power Olympics, complete with its share of fiscal flameouts and high-voltage hurdles.

**The Catch-22: AI as Savior & Scoundrel**  
Here's the plot twist: AI’s current cameo as a power cheat might also be the hero in disguise. Think about it. AI could streamline energy usage and help keep the power grid in check. Shaving off bureaucratic fuzz alone could save enough power to keep even the most ambitious congressional initiative in the black.

**The Burning Question**  
All this leaves us mulling over some seriously loaded questions: As we dive deeper into this AI-powered future, can innovative energy solutions outpace AI’s insatiable hunger for electricity? More importantly, can AI manage its electric appetite before it flips the switch on its own growth potential?

For those of you in the trenches, battling the electric dragon—how’s your balance between innovation and resource management? Have your power strategies been sacked by AI’s demands, or are you finding creative ways to fuse tech advancement with energy conservation?

We fought fairly often but I still tried really hard to make things work between us because he kept insisting that I was the love of his life and how one day he and I would be married. 

I ignored many red flags 🚩 like not being able to meet his mother or his sisters and when it came to his friends, he would tell me that it was “weird” that I wanted to meet them. I know that what I did was wrong but people of Reddit, please understand that I really did love this person. 

When he got cut off from Fasfa at our college, I paid an entire quarter of tuition for him entirely out of my own pocket. He was in between jobs at the time and I had some money I was saving. 
Now he works at a fancy security company and makes more money than I did back then and even now. 

Back to the story: One of the people in his friends group is this girl that I will call “Big B”. My ex and Big B were long time friends and have gone to several events together as well as being frequent online gamers. (I wasn’t even allowed to play games with them.) 
When my ex invited me to a comicon event about 2 1/2 hours away from my home, I was really excited to attend with him. 

I spent the whole night preparing for the day and making sure that we had everything we needed to get to the event in the morning. (Ex stayed the night at my house this night.) 
Sense neither of us have a vehicle we opted to ride the bus to get to comicon 🚎 

The entire 2 1/2 hours during our commute I notice that my ex (current at the time) was more involved with his phone than holding conversation with me. He is being stand-offish and picking little fights. I’m confused, I am hurt. I don’t understand what’s going on.. 

Before I even step foot through the doors of the comicon event, it suddenly becomes clear to me why my ex hasn’t been talking to me in an affectionate manner the entire way over here. 

Big B is inside… he tells me that he doesn’t want me to meet her because of prior conversations I have had with him about things that make me uncomfortable. (Lewd pics knowing he is dating me, Direct messages not pertaining to anything in their group chat [which I am not a part of] ect.) 

World of Reddit, please understand that I had no intention of creating any conflict at comicon. I genuinely just wanted to go inside and have a good time with my boyfriend. But that’s not what happened.. 

He picks an obvious fight with me over literally nothing… it was a long bus ride and there is a Starbucks nearby, I ask if we can go inside together so that I can grab a coffee before we enter the event. He starts yelling saying that we are already late and at this point he would rather just go inside with his “ friends”. (Big B has her own boyfriend… yeah, I don’t get it either 🤷‍♀️) 

I start crying, he leaves me standing outside by myself. He does not return for me.. 
I take the 2 1/2 hour bus ride home by myself seething with rage and resentment… I didn’t even step one foot inside of comicon. 😞 

My ex left his brand new $2000 laptop here at my house the night before… I start brainstorming about what I want to do with it. (This is not the first time he has ditched me for this other person… I’m well aware that I am an idiot.) 

I start googling things and realize that as long as this fancy laptop has no internet connection it is Tottaly untraceable 😈 Jackpot. 
I pack it up in its carrying case with the mouse pad, headphones 🎧 and other accessories. 
I have a storage unit nearby that has poor cellphone reception and no WiFi. 

6 hours pass before he messages me to let me know that he is on his way to my house to pick up “his things”. His words, not mine. I inform him that I don’t want him in my home and I will leave his clothes and his keychain outside of my front door. 

This is already pretty long so I’ll try to shorten it: He claims that his stuff will get stolen if left outside. I tell him, “Who’s gonna steal some pants and an old pocket chain?” He calls me 13 times and I ignore every single one. He sends a final message that his laptop better be safe. To which I respond, “What laptop?” 

I create an entire false text trail about how he didn’t bring one and I haven’t seen it. More calls. I ignore them all.. he shows up and I refuse to let him in. More banging, more knocking. I don’t open the door. 
He calls the police and I wait for them to arrive before inviting them all inside to look for this “supposed laptop”. 

Of course they don’t find it. 
They spend time looking while I sit back and watch them.

Eventually they leave and I can hear the officers outside telling him that after entering my home there isn’t much they can do to assist him in recovering this laptop. It’s his word against mine. 
He still owes me $700 in tuition that I paid for.

I can hear him crying outside but I ignore it even though it makes my heart hurt 💔 I know where his laptop is. It’s in my storage unit. I had plenty of time to relocate it while he enjoyed comicon with his friends. 

Don’t worry 😉 I gave it back without a single scratch on it. But not before I received $700 directly deposited to my bank account 🤪 

Next time he’s short on cash, he can contact Big B to cover his expenses and not me 🤗 We haven’t spoken sense.  ",26,1741655672.0,revengestories,7,0.97,False

Picture this: Alibaba.com is aiming for every merchant under its expansive e-roof to be chumming up with AI by the end of 2025. Now, this isn't just a friendly neighborhood tech upgrade. This is Alibaba flipping the switch on a global AI expansion drive with all the bravado you'd expect from a company that recently set aside a casual $53 billion for AI infrastructure. Yeah, billion with a 'B'.

In a recent interview, Zhang Kuo, the mastermind steering Alibaba’s international B2B ship, painted a picture where AI isn't just one of those nifty business tools—it becomes the business toolkit. With half of the platform's 200,000 merchants already onboard with AI-driven marketing, customer engagement, and Skynet-level risk control, Zhang’s confidence is as palpable as an engineer’s caffeine jitters on a Monday morning. “We have confidence,” he said—and when a tech titan says that, it usually means they've got more tricks up their digital sleeves.

So what’s fueling this AI adoption frenzy? Well, aside from the inevitable march toward a future where machines do the heavy lifting (and thinking), there’s the practical bit; as Zhang puts it, AI can handle tasks better, faster, and presumably, cheaper. Imagine a world where every product query gets an instant, precise response, and every logistical hiccup is smoothed out by an algorithm. Alibaba’s merchants are already experiencing this transformation, with more jumping on the AI bandwagon weekly.

But before you picture a dystopian marketplace entirely run by AI with sellers lounging on virtual beaches, let's keep it real. This massive shift has its skeptics, ourselves included. Is 100% AI adoption truly feasible in such a short period? Will merchants embrace this future, or will resistance slow the engines of progress?

And therein lies the juicy bit for all you r/AiKilledMyStartUp mavens: Is this AI dream a game-changer that will propel SMEs into the stratosphere of efficiency, or are we setting ourselves up for a glitchfest of epic proportions?

It had different stages with fluctuating symptoms.  


Here is my story: (it's from a diary)
From January I had depression and anxiety. 2 weeks ago my doctor prescribed SSRI. One the very first day I've already felt like I took a half extasy or something, akathisia was the worst side effect. After taking it for only 3 days I believe I had an intense ""epileptic like"" seisure (I never had before so I don't know) where I was aware but very disoriented, it was like an out of body experience with feelings of depersonalization and deja vu. It felt like my mind was frying for a few minutes. After that experience like a ""switch"" this state of mind came back from the covid era. (I've had a similar experience during covid but it wasn't as intensive as this one. I read somewhere that autoimmune encephalitis can be triggered by viruses like covid or influenza but extreme mental stress can also activate a relapse - what I think happened in my case)


I had the following symptoms for two weeks: (written in present tense)


Extreme fluctuating energy levels, I get quick dopamine bursts that goes into tiredness many many times a day


Feeling of constant pressure in the head


(Not strong. Like I'm underwater 5 meters down.)


Double vision - worsens from tiredness. I have to actively focus on something, when I ""relax"" it comes back.


Blank face - like face muscles are numb or weak


Stiff neck, head feels heavy, I need to tilt my head forward for relaxation


Constant tinnitus


Breathing slows down when I'm lying down, sometimes I have to sigh to get enough oxygen


Cracking joints


Minor muscle twitches around my body


When I try to fall asleep my brain is switching from dream like state to awake state back and forth


Sensitivity to loud noises


Insomnia


Main mental problems: short term memory loss, paranoia, difficulty recalling words (I feel like my English is reduced from B2 to A2), concentration problems (I call it repetitive information input: I have to repeatedly listen/read/watch any kind of information otherwise my brain can't comprehend), reduced decision making, apathy, altered perception of time (If I don't watch the clock I have no clue how many minutes passed since I last checked)


When I wake up for a moment I have no idea where I am locally or who am I, it's like I'm waking up from a dream into another dream without my real sense of ego


Strange urge to swallow


Before I fall asleep I have random words or sentences circulating in my head without any meaning


Sensitivity to temperature fluctuations


Pulse fluctuations, I stand up from bed and my pulse jumps


Worsening mental symptoms due to stress and due to increase in body temperature. My brain freezes under the least amount of stress. This also applies to stimulants. When I drink a small coffee it gives vibes like I'm drugged after that comes the crash when my mind goes totally dull for a few minutes. It's like my receptors are fried.


Another strange thing, while I was writing down symptoms I wrote the same symptoms like 4-5 times repeating myself. I had to constantly delete it.


After two weeks, this state of mind faded away and new symptoms came:


Eye floaters


Insomnia was replaced by fatigue


Low libido


So my questions are:


1. Am I delusional if I think it was an autoimmune response? 


2. Does psychosis itself affects the brain the way it has affected mine?


My cognitive functions are still not the same. It feels like my brain was damaged due to this experience.

I really loved my old job but it just didn’t pay enough, nor did I try to convince them to pay me more because I knew they weren’t doing well. It had come to a point where I started racking up debt to keep my place and have healthy food, etc.

I got a huge pay bump at this new one, it’ll make a big difference in my life. It’s a step up in title as well.

Well, I got in today and… I expected some parts of the office to not be as polished as my old job since it dealt with property and real estate, whereas this one is in debt collection. They also mentioned that they’re a bit behind the times (coming from my boss who is also relatively very new too)

But… Their carpets just look so old, and like there’s legitimately 30 years worth of dust accumulated in it (it’s an even older company). The building is pretty much empty except for a dozen or so people (building probably meant to hold at least 250) because of Covid converting most of everyone in the other departments remote. Unfortunately since there’s less traffic in the office, they just haven’t really kept up with the cleaning.

They don’t even have dish soap in the break room. They don’t have plastic cutlery, even the copier machine looks 30. Even the water out of the water dispenser tastes stale and just puts my appetite off come lunch. Cubicles are dusty and crusty. I can tell no one uses the pot of coffee because my boss comes in with Starbucks. The HR person who walked me through today said the last time she did a tour of the place was when my boss came in 6-7 months ago. When she took me to the supply room, I started sneezing profusely.

Is this just a grass is greener on the other side situation? Should I just push for better upkeep now that I’m here? AIO?

he always texts me first if we dont talk for a day or two, im pretty sure i see him looking at me when were sitting beside each other in class (like those quick side eye glances), he always waits for me to pack my things after class so we can walk out together, putting his arm over his arm rest so that its touching my arm, complimented my haircut, takes the long route to his house so that we can stay on subway together, but idk.

i think hes just being friendly, but my friends say he wouldnt be putting in the effort of texting me first if he didnt want to talk to me. even just as friends.

So main question is he doesn't seem too interested, so is the constant teasing just a cultural thing that everyone does?

We met on Facebook dating, had coffee, and by the second date, went to her place, danced, and then made out. We spent a whole day together this weekend and made out passionately again. She keeps calling me ""babe,"" and ""lindo"" and ""namarando"" and said I was her boyfriend. I thought it was very cute, but on the second date, she was really getting wild and said something with ""amor"" in it, so I told her to slow it down. I do enjoy it though. She is the most wonderful, compatible person I have ever dated. We like art, have similiar values, equally attracted to each other, practically complete each other's sentences. My father and his family are from Porto Alegre, so I have a tiny little bit of cultural understanding, but not much.  

She is furiously looking for jobs having completed her masters and due back in Brazil in May unless she can extend her visa. Her father is a dean and her mother is a dentist over there, and she spends money like they're pretty well off. People warn me about being used for a greencard, but I just don't think that's the case. She seems to accept that she's going back, and we agreed to just be in the moment. Although I would't have dated her had she been up front about her limited time.

She is medicated for severe anxiety, and we both have serious anxious attachment issues, I have anxiety, depression, low self-esteem. We're both in therapy, but it seems like this relationship is a giant blazing red flag. Her last relationship was two years ago, and that was for three years. I just saw she deleted her dating profile, and her profile was a little weird (she said no nudes lol).

Is it a red flag? I'm going to bring dinner over and have a discussion that we need to pump the brakes a bit. But I really, really like her. Hell, I've never had a girl where I could just come over and plop on the couch like its home. She gives me beers and fruit loops, and even essential oils for my asthma. She is so warm and genuine, and even she says she worries things are almost too good. I'm enjoying things so very much, but it's almost like it's running away and I'm getting scared.

I am sure Bitsie didn't complain but right after power went to her head the writers changed her personality, made Nick unable to look at her Hexenface which really didn't make sense. Then they made her fuck Renard so the audience may hate her too and let her go. They did the very same with Lana in Smallville btw, they turned her into poison, literally, so that we could accept Lois Lane as the love interest. But this wasn't enough she brainwashed her into an emotionless killing machine. Even after that they wrote stupid stuff like Eve threatening Adalind if she did anything to Nick, whom she was referring to Burckhardt as Eve before so we'd know Juliette was there too.  
\- Unbelievably powerful Hexenmädchen was a very good plot device but she didn't really become a character. We didn't see what good Diana brought to the world really. They were so on board with that particular prophecy though. I think they had a clear plot about that but they scrapped it. Instead she was creepy, extremely dangerous and dangerously unpredictable, and no, her actions in the final episode wasn't so that everything will be exactly how they should so Nick may make the correct decision, it doesn't work.  
\- The Black Claw plot was very good but they couldn't have executed it worse. I remember the world to be far, far larger than Portland but apparently who who loses Portland loses the world so... Renard was reduced to a plot device at this season, acted uncharacteristically stupid. He shouldn't have survived. Nick coming to an agreement after Renard turned on him then took his Frau and son from him makes no sense in hell. Nick needed to remove his royal head from his royal shoulders no matter what the cost.  
\- Zerstörer was Schiße. Neither the parallel universe made sense nor he. All that tension, all the treasure hunt, 800 years of scheming, death and lies shouldn't have culminated in the antichrist walking the earth (he felt more like the Anthichrist than the Devil), it was too easy and it ended too easy. The dude was bulletproof until there was 2 living 2 dead Grimms around him? Is Nick not Grimmtonite enough? The deaths felt cheap too. The moment Adalind died it was clear that everyone is going to be respawned, the only surprise was that it was sort of a timetravel.  
\- As if 23 year-old Hexenmädchen was not powerful enough (the lass was Darth Vader at the age of 3) they made Kelly to take the ""staff of Moses"" to a family hunt? Why is that staff in one piece? Can't Diana just remote into someone near the Wesen they were going to kill? She could remote force-choke them too you know as she can appear wherever she wants.  
\- I am generally unhappy about the PG-13ness of the show but it aired on NBC so they had to I guess. But they failed to deliver what they promised every time a Wesen recognized him as a Grimm. If you call someone ""decapitare"" there needs to be decapitation. Kelly was a decapitare, Truble was a decapitare but the show is about Nick and he is an ""arrestaere"".  
\- I am sorry but there is no way the Wesen could have kept their existence secret as everyone and their mothers are Wesen in Portland and there is no reason to believe that isn't the case anywhere else.  
\- The episode where they got roofied by a love potion was the best one. I laughed my arse off to Hank. He really killed it.  
Overall the source material is great but the execution isn't. Still better than most shows, it deserves it's IMDB rating. Calire Coffee was the best thing on the show. I'd just stop watching if it wasn't for her. She was just interesting all along. She had a slut phase though.",4,1741655130.0,grimm,4,0.62,False

We haven't fully moved in yet as we're finishing up a few last things. I'll preface this by saying I am 9 weeks pregnant, so my sensitivity to odors is high right now, but I've smelled this unpleasant odor in the house since way before becoming pregnant and it hasn't changed. No one else can smell or will admit to smelling it (my husband and in laws). When we come home from the house, our clothes reek of the smell and we even brought our two cats there for a day and even THEY smell strongly of the house after coming back to where we currently live. 

We ripped up the carpet in the bedrooms and put in wood floors but left the carpet on the stairs. We have painted all of the walls and ceilings, and replaced all of the moulding. For the carpet on the stairs, we used oxyclean carpet cleaner mixed with water in one of those Home Depot carpet cleaners that we rented. We've put coffee grounds in cups around the house, and I got these charcoal bags off Amazon, and neither of those things helped. We cleaned the floors and walls with a water and vinegar mixture.

I'm at a loss for how to get this smell out. I noticed today that the walls in the two bathrooms smell like urine, but that's not the only thing contributing to the smell throughout the whole house.

I don’t know your name yet, but maybe this is how our story begins.

I’m 39, based in the UK, and after years of navigating life’s highs and lows, I’ve come to understand that love isn’t about finding someone perfect—it’s about finding someone real. Someone whose laugh feels like home, whose presence makes the ordinary extraordinary, and whose heart beats in rhythm with my own.

I’ve been through love before—two decades of it, in fact. And after nearly four years of learning, healing, and rediscovering who I am, I’m ready. Not for games, not for half-measures, but for something with depth, passion, and the kind of connection that makes you want to stay up just a little longer, because saying goodnight feels impossible.

Who I Am

I’m a man who works hard, but loves harder. My career keeps me driven, but my heart is what defines me. I believe in deep conversation, unfiltered laughter, and the small gestures that mean the most. I’m someone who notices—who remembers how you take your coffee, the song that makes you close your eyes when it plays, and the way your voice softens when you talk about something you love.

I value kindness, loyalty, and emotional depth. I’m a romantic in the ways that matter—not just in grand gestures, but in the quiet moments that most overlook. And while I appreciate physical attraction, it’s emotional chemistry that truly sets my soul on fire.

Who I’m Looking For

I want a woman who is open, self-aware, and unafraid to love deeply. Someone who can meet me in the middle—who values trust, passion, and partnership. You don’t have to have it all figured out (who does?), but you’re willing to show up, be present, and build something meaningful.

You appreciate the importance of slow mornings, spontaneous adventures, and the kind of love that feels both exhilarating and grounding. You want a partner, not just a placeholder. You believe that love isn’t just found—it’s built, day by day, through effort, understanding, and an unshakable belief in each other.

A Few More Things…

•	I’m 6’1, with dark hair, brown eyes, and a build that shows I take care of myself—but also love a good meal.

•	I don’t drink, smoke, or do drugs. Clean-cut but not rigid about it.

•	I live for road trips, deep conversations, and long walks where time seems to disappear.

•	I love spa weekends, cozy nights in, and date nights where we dress up just because we can.

•	You’ll find me in a navy suit more often than not, because looking sharp is just part of who I am.

•	I’m not opposed to distance if the connection is real—air miles don’t scare me, and neither does a love worth chasing.

If any of this resonates with you, introduce yourself properly. Tell me who you are beyond the surface. Share something real. And if you’re up for it, send a picture—I like to put a face to the energy behind the words.

Let’s see if this could be the last first message we ever send.",0,1741654295.0,ForeverAloneDating,1,0.5,False
