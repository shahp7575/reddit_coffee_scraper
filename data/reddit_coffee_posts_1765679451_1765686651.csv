1. I am an impulsive person and I get the feel of an impulse when I buy silver/gold while investing at the same time.

I'm actually trying to get my kids into the silver more by paying their allowance in silver 🤣🤣 I offer them 5 bucks up on spot! 

3. I like looking at old things, some of these coins and bullion could really tell a story. Ive acquired some coins that I was going to refine and ended up pulling them because of amount of history associated

1pm54up,https://www.reddit.com/r/daddit/comments/1pm54up/dealing_with_a_wife_that_is_always_sick_but_not/,Dealing with a wife that is always sick but not diagnosed,"Genuinely asking this question of other 30-something dads in the messy middle. I’m hoping I’m not a lunatic and there is atleast another relationship dynamic out there that mirrors ours:

Is your spouse perpetually sick? I’m not talking disabilities, medically diagnosed lingering issues or mental disorders (hate the word). I’m talking about a perfectly healthy 25yr old who is now a 35yr old and has never, not once, been diagnosed with anything other than contagious infections. That’s a lie. She was “diagnosed” by her primary doctor for mild anxiety and depression but getting low dose sertraline prescribed in my experience only requires ticking off some eval questions with no fuss.

Ever since I moved in with her, I can’t recall a single month in a decade where she wasn’t sick. Headache, migraine, flu, COVID, lymph nodes, PPD, severe periods you name it. We’ve even had our fair share of mystery illnesses like when she felt she couldn’t breath but the lung screening came back like that of a career sprinter.

I know we love our wives in sickness and in health but I can’t recall any health at all. I spent the latter part of my 20s and now early 30s diagnosing stream upon stream of illnesses. She has even stopped using the “low immunity” explanation herself cause all her bloodwork always come out sparkly clean (no vitamin D or iron deficiency even!). This isn’t a big deal on the surface but overtime these bouts of sickness have had 3 lasting effects:

1. She doesn’t have any plans for life. With I met her she didn’t have a lot going on either (wanted to own a coffee shop but had never googled how to do it) and worked as a part time teller part time retail store helper. She had no plans for motherhood either but put what was of her career aside for the past 2 years to raise our kids. Complains and hates it but still doesn’t have a plan on how to make enough to cover the cost of ONE daycare tuition. Being sick keeps her firmly in survival mode most of the week so any future planning is mostly hopeful dreaming. 
2. I’ve changed as a person. I moved to the States for her, but we hardly ever travel or do outdoorsy things like I’d always hoped we would. Over time I’ve dropped my ambitions too and gone from a total socialite to a weekend at home guy. My own friends don’t recognize me anymore but I only see them once a year when I make the trip back. Our social life is near zero.
3. It’s easy to show up for your partner on a sick day with nice warm soup and some pampering to show how much you care. It’s near impossible (for me) to prove I’m a loving husband 7 days a week when I myself am waking up dreading the new ailments at our door today. Overtime I’ve grown distant from her sick needs because she refuses to treat them seriously enough to visit ER but seriously enough to complain if I’m not constantly worrying about her or prioritizing her.


I know I sound like a douche. But having spent a decade living with someone who may as well be on long term disability without a diagnosis is killing me bit by bit.

What do I do? If I continue the path I’m on we’ll be divorced in 5 years and I’ll be the emotionless heartless man stereotype. If I commit to managing her health I’ll become a father figure for her instead of a husband (she hates when I ask her if she takes meds but she misses antibiotics and antidepressants all the time). If I fake concern I’ll be caught eventually. 

For the sake of our kids and the next 40 years - what should I do?!",1,1765686327.0,daddit,1,1.0,False
1pm54pt,https://www.reddit.com/r/IndiaCoffee/comments/1pm54pt/how_to_choose_coffee_beans_that_actually_match/,How to Choose Coffee Beans That Actually Match Your Taste and Brewing Style,"When coffee tastes sour, bitter, flat, or just wrong, the problem usually isn’t the brewer—it’s the beans. One of the most common mistakes is buying coffee arbitrarily, assuming any bag will work with any setup. **When the beans don’t match your taste preferences or brewing method**, you end up trying to fix the problem with grind changes and brew tweaks, wasting time and coffee without ever fixing the core issue.

Freshness is another frequent trap. Many people unknowingly buy coffee that’s already past its peak because the bag only shows an expiry date. Brewing stale beans often leads to cups that taste hollow, papery, or aggressively bitter, which people then mistake for poor technique. No adjustment can bring back sweetness and aroma once the coffee has gone flat.

Misunderstanding labels causes even more frustration. Words like **single origin**, **washed**, **natural**, or **honey processed** are often ignored or misunderstood, leading to flavor mismatches. Someone expecting a *smooth*, *chocolatey cup* might end up with a *sharp*, *acidic coffee* and assume it’s low quality, when in reality it’s just the wrong style for their palate. The same happens with **origin** and **roast level**—bright African coffees or lightly roasted beans are often blamed for tasting “sour” when they’re simply being brewed by someone who prefers darker, heavier profiles.

Brewing method mistakes compound the problem. Light roasts can taste thin or sour when forced into espresso without adjustment, while dark roasts can taste harsh and bitter when brewed as pour-over or filter. Even high-quality beans will disappoint if they’re used in a way they weren’t intended for, leading many people to write off entire origins or roast levels unnecessarily.

The fix is **choosing beans with intention**. *Look for a clear roast date*, *use processing methods and origin as clues to flavor*, and *match the roast level to how you brew*. When the beans, your taste, and your brewing method line up, most of the common problems disappear—and coffee becomes far more **consistent**, **enjoyable**, and **waste-free**.

There are some small but great features I would love to suggest or get an opinion on since the devs are so active here.

1. Environmental activities would be great. Nothing huge but something like a coffee shop all the cops in town go to where we can just hang around waiting for a call. Or a broken down car with a civilian waving us down to call a tow. Simple small things that really give us the beat cop experience outside of car chases and shootouts.

2. Similar to the idea of the car breakdown. Some ways to expand the low frequency crime option would be cool. Little calls like a public drunk or random vehicle accidents. Maybe something like a fraudster or pickpocket we need to track down in the markets.

3. The only thing that irks me in this game that I would love to see improved is traffic stops. I would love to be able to order a car to pull over further or follow me so we arent in the path of traffic. similar to features in LSPDFR. Building on that it would be cool to be able to call backup on traffic stops and maybe even perform a felony stop on those with warrants?

Hey there, I'm looking for a partner interested in a grounded, character driven, drama filled, police department roleplay. The roleplay would be inspired by shows like SWAT and the Rookie. The Roleplay would be set in the Ready or Not universe. You dont need to know anything about the video game, but there is a lot of lore to it you could look into if you like. 

Below is a writing sample/background

The conference room at headquarters smelled like old coffee and cleaning solution, the kind that never quite faded no matter how often the floors were scrubbed. Outside the narrow windows, Los Sueños kept moving the way it always did now — sirens somewhere in the distance, a helicopter passing low, the city never fully settling.

Chief Galo Álvarez sat at the head of the table, uniform pressed, posture straight out of habit more than effort. The service stripes on his sleeve caught the light when he shifted his arms. Behind him, a body-camera frame was frozen on the wall, paused mid-hallway, a doorway open to a moment everyone in the room already knew by heart.

He didn’t look at the screen.

His eyes stayed on Captain Daniel Mercer.

“Start from the first decision,” Álvarez said. His voice was calm. Not cold. Just controlled.

Mercer nodded once and took a breath. He didn’t open the folder in front of him. There was no point. “Initial call came in as a domestic disturbance. Prior history at the address. That area’s been unstable since the sanitation strike. Patrol heard a gunshot on arrival.”

Álvarez listened without interrupting.

“We activated under barricaded suspect protocol,” Mercer continued. “Given how things have been citywide, we didn’t assume it was isolated.”

No one challenged that. In Los Sueños, nothing stayed isolated anymore.

“When did you believe someone else was inside?” Álvarez asked.

“Thermal picked up two heat signatures. One moving. One stationary.”

Álvarez tilted his head slightly. “Believed,” he said. “Or confirmed?”

Mercer hesitated, just long enough to feel it. Across the table, Internal Affairs didn’t move. Didn’t blink. Just watched.

“Believed,” Mercer said.

Álvarez nodded once, accepting it. “And the suspect?”

“Communicative. Calm. No demands. Denied anyone else was inside.”

“So he set the pace,” Álvarez said.

“Yes, sir.”

“In a city where people have learned how to use time,” Álvarez added quietly.

Mercer nodded again. “Yes, sir.”

“Did anyone say that out loud?” Álvarez asked.

“Yes.”

Álvarez didn’t ask who. He didn’t need names. He’d been doing this too long for that.

“And you held,” Álvarez said.

“Yes, sir.”

“Because policy told you to,” Álvarez said.

“Yes.”

Frank Delgado, the union rep, leaned forward slightly. “Chief, policy exists to protect everyone involved. Especially now. Every early breach becomes a headline. Every mistake turns into a lawsuit.”

Álvarez looked at him then. “I know, Frank. I’ve been answering for this department since before this city started coming apart.”

He turned back to Mercer. “How long from first contact to the execution?”

“Twenty-three minutes.”

Álvarez let the number sit there. “That’s not a long time,” he said. “But it’s long enough for someone inside to decide how they want the night to end.”

The room went quiet again.

“This wasn’t fear,” Álvarez said. “And it wasn’t incompetence. Your team did what they were trained to do.”

Delgado’s shoulders eased slightly.

“But Los Sueños doesn’t play fair anymore,” Álvarez went on. “People here watch us. They learn. They wait for us to hesitate.”

Internal Affairs stayed silent, their presence heavier than any comment.

“This was a judgment gap,” Álvarez said. “Not because judgment failed, but because the ground keeps shifting under it.”

Delgado spoke carefully. “And for the record, my client isn’t being disciplined for that.”

“He’s not,” Álvarez said without hesitation. “This isn’t disciplinary.”

Álvarez reached forward and shut off the recording. The hallway disappeared from the wall, leaving only the low hum of equipment cooling down.

“Captain Mercer,” he said as he stood, “get your people through their debriefs. Take care of them.”

“Yes, sir.”

Álvarez glanced once at Internal Affairs, then at Delgado. “This review stays what it is,” he said. “An honest accounting.”

When he left the room, no one followed.

Álvarez closed the door to his office and stood there for a moment, one hand resting against the wood. The noise of the building faded to a dull background hum. Phones. Radios. The city asking for more than it ever gave back.

He sat at his desk and rubbed a hand over his face. The meeting replayed itself in pieces. Twenty-three minutes. Silence. A hallway that led nowhere good.

Policy wasn’t going to catch up fast enough.

Álvarez picked up his desk phone and dialed a number he hadn’t called in a while. It rang twice.

“Álvarez,” he said when it connected. “It’s Galo.”

A pause. Then a voice he knew well enough to hear the years in it.

“Figured Los Sueños would get around to calling,” the man said.

“It hasn’t beaten me,” Álvarez said. “But it’s trying.”

“What happened?”

“Barricade turned into an execution,” Álvarez said. No decoration. “By the book. Still went bad.”

Silence on the other end. The professional kind.

“You looking for resources?” the man asked.

“I’m looking for perspective,” Álvarez said. “Someone who’s seen cities where hesitation gets people killed and speed gets people sued. Someone who can sit with my people and tell them what we’re missing.”

Another pause.

“You asking officially?”

Álvarez looked out the window at the city he’d spent his life in. “Not yet,” he said. “I’m asking you.”

A quiet breath on the line. “You’re thinking HRT.”

“I’m thinking a liaison,” Álvarez said. “Someone who won’t try to take over.”

There was a short, humorless chuckle. “I might know someone.”

“Send him,” Álvarez said. “Before this city teaches us the same lesson twice.”

The line went dead.

Álvarez sat there a moment longer, staring at the phone. Outside, sirens rose again, closer this time.

Amazon is cutting 14,000 corporate jobs in 2025. Intel cut 15,000. The numbers are blurring into a single, grey static of ""restructuring."" And everyone is screaming at the wrong thing.



We are screaming at the Algorithm. We are blaming the AI.

**We are cowards.**

# The Robot Didn't Sign the Paper

Let's rip the bandage off: **AI does not fire people.**

AI is code. It is a predictive text engine on steroids. It has no will, no malice, and no signature.

**People fire people.**

A human executive sat in a leather chair, looked at a spreadsheet, and made a choice. They looked at the cost of your salary, and then they looked at the cost of a ChatGPT Enterprise license, and they did the math.

Stop anthropomorphizing the software. It absolves the humans of responsibility. When you say ""AI took my job,"" you are letting the CFO off the hook. You are pretending this was a natural disaster, like a hurricane, instead of a deliberate act of capital allocation.

# The Brutal Ethics of Efficiency

Here is the ugly truth that no one wants to say out loud: **If a machine can do your job, you shouldn't have that job.**

I know. It hurts. It sounds cruel. But look at the alternative.

Are we expecting Amazon to run a charity? Are we asking shareholders to subsidize 15,000 salaries for work that is no longer necessary? That is not a business; that is a daycare.

If I can dig a ditch with a backhoe in one hour, is it ""responsible"" to hire 50 men with spoons to do it in a week just to keep them employed? No. It is a waste of human potential.

The tragedy isn't that the machine is faster. The tragedy is that we built a society where your right to eat is tied to your ability to out-calculate a supercomputer.

# The ""Productivity"" Trap

We are entering the **Age of the Centaur**.

* **The Slop View:** ""AI will empower us to unlock new potentials in the digital landscape.""
* **The Reality:** One human + One AI = Five humans fired.

That is productivity. That is the engine of the world. It is terrifying, and it is inevitable.

You cannot guilt-trip a corporation into inefficiency. You cannot protest against math. If a company keeps dead weight on the payroll ""out of the goodness of their heart,"" they will be eaten alive by the competitor who doesn't.

# God Help Us Fit In

We are standing on the edge of a brand new world, and it doesn't care about your tenure. It doesn't care that you have a mortgage.

The ""Social Contract"" of the 20th century - *work hard, be loyal, retire safe* \- is burning in a dumpster fire behind the office.

So, what do we do? We stop whining about the tools. We stop waiting for the government to save us.

We become the ones who hold the shovel. We become the ones who direct the machine, rather than the ones who are buried by it.

The world is colder now. The safety net is gone. Adapt. Or get stuck at the turnstile.",0,1765685224.0,AIDangers,2,0.33,False
1pm4six,https://www.reddit.com/r/stenography/comments/1pm4six/bilateral_carpal_tunnel_release_surgery/,Bilateral carpal tunnel release surgery,"Hi, I just had a bilateral open carpal tunnel release surgery yesterday and wanted to share my story bc when I was researching this before my surgery, it was hard to find anyone’s real experience. 

I’ve been a steno freelance court reporter for 21 years, and after working my butt off in May, I noticed an increase in my pain level in my hands, arms, and wrists. The palms of my hands ached after every job. Sometimes the pain started within the first 30 minutes of a job beginning. My thumb, pointer and middle fingers began to go numb while eating, doing makeup, gripping the steering wheel, etc. The palms of my hands ached. 

I was diagnosed in July with bilateral carpal tunnel via an EMG and had the surgery yesterday. I had both done at the same time at my surgeon’s recommendation. 

Yesterday’s pain level wasn’t bad because I had nerve blocks in both hands. What was slightly painful and more annoying was when the blocks started wearing off. It was the feeling of a limb coming back to life after “falling asleep” but with a lot of pressure and a very deep, tight feeling. 

Today is day 2, and I’m in more pain today. Around a 5/10 at rest. I can’t pinch, grasp, twist, push, or pull anything. My hands are wrapped up pretty tightly in bulky dressings that can’t be taken off until Monday so doing pretty much everything is difficult. I’m grateful I have family staying with me to help me. 

I was prescribed hydrocodone 5 325 which has been helping tremendously with the pain. The ice packs I got from my surgeon are also very helpful, and I use those several times a day. 

The surgeon said my nerves were pretty frayed and raggedy looking and that they’d been pinched for a long time. The surgery was also very quick. It took around 45 minutes from the time I was wheeled into the OR until I woke up in recovery. Easy and quick. 

My hope is I can return to taking depositions shortly after the first of the year. I can’t lift anything more than a cup of coffee until I go back for a follow-up on the 29th to get my stitches out. The bright side is I can sit back and relax this Christmas since I’m temporarily limb impaired!

Anyway, I hope posting about my experience helps people in this profession who are afraid of the surgery. ",2,1765685208.0,stenography,0,1.0,False

1pm4plr,https://www.reddit.com/r/stopdrinking/comments/1pm4plr/feeling_the_deprivation/,Feeling the deprivation,"Hi friends, came here for some support and wisdom. I'm nine days away from being three months alcohol-free. I've gotten to the point where I usually don't think about it that much. I'm not fighting to avoid drinking every day, it just feels like what I do now, and I'm pretty cool with that. However, I haven't tested myself in social situations very much these last couple months. I've been working a crazy schedule and staying home a lot when I'm not working, and have been too tired to miss late-night weekend binge drinking (which was my MO). 

This morning I walked a 5k with my partner, my mom, my sister, my nephew, and two of my best friends. Getting up at 7am on a Saturday to do something healthy and productive hangover-free felt really good, and the weather was great. We got breakfast after and my mom and sister both ordered mimosas. They looked good, and yes, I wished I could have one, but it wasn't a big deal. I happily drank my black coffee.

Later in the afternoon my partner and I had a Secret Santa get-together with his family at his sister's house. I normally would have grabbed a drink straight away. They had one of my favorite ciders, wine, and beer. I brought my own Hop Watr. I really wanted to drink, and felt a sense of loss/grief that I couldn't. Logically I knew that it wouldn't be worth it, so I didn't. But I hate that it felt like deprivation.

Then, tonight I got a text from a friend asking if our other girlfriend and I wanted to get together. I was way too tired after getting up at 3:30am for work all week and walking a 5k this morning either way, then they suggested pre-gaming at one of their places and walking to the bars. I really wished I could. That also felt like deprivation and a loss of freedom. I know I can go out and not drink alcohol, but with them drinking I think it would have been challenging for me.

Anyway, today was the biggest challenge not to drink since I quit. But I did not drink. I think I'm grieving the days of not having to restrict myself. I'm also overtired and hormonal, sitting on the couch on the verge of tears and just needed to write this out. Thank you all. ♥️",9,1765684951.0,stopdrinking,0,1.0,False

What's more? Paid for the most expensive tier (premium+, platinum, whatever they call it) and probably swiped more than a 1000 profiles.

So, here's my review so you dont have to wonder if u should spend... or for science!

Coffee Meets Bagel: Used a flower to ""super like"" someone but no response. Matched with 3 girls (1 foreigner), still chatting with all 3 and arranging a date with 1 (altho she said lets start off with being friends first, not sure if shes seriously looking or waiting to see if anyone matches her expectations), not hopeful but can try. My impression is that girls here seemed the most ""normal"", as in non-scammy. Didnt like that the last 10 recommendations of the day are old profiles whom i have swiped before in the past. Like why even have 10 filler profiles just to inflate the daily recommendation numbers. Separately received 7 likes from girls whom i swiped left. 

Facebook: Got the most matches here; 7 matches (2 foreigners). 4 didnt reply at all and 1 unmatched me after 3 days of chatting. In the midst of arranging a date with 1, who is a domestic helper, still thinking if its a good idea. Separately received 6 likes from girls whom i swiped left. This app is free.

Hinge: Probably the worst app and a waste of money. 0 matches, received 3 likes whom i swiped left. Ran out of profiles to swipe; according to my filters. A good thing is that they let you filter ""active today"" users and new users, which is not much profiles to be honest, I think most profiles are inactive on this app. Separately received 3 likes from girls whom i swiped left.

Bumble: 3 matches, all foreigners. 1 of them is 100% fake profile/impersonator because i found the actual social media (real in Taiwan, this one said from Malaysia), and another 1 I suspect is also fake as she gave me a link to a sus live paid streaming platform. Ran out of profiles to swipe; according to my filters. Surprisingly, received the most likes here (10), which i swiped left on as they dont meet my requirements, there was even 1 whom I went on a date many years ago and now seeing that she is 41 and still single is.. i dont know what to feel about it, not to mention, she liked my profile, dont know if she even remembers having went on a date with me lol. also saw another 1 whom i went on a date before with updated photos and profile while swiping. both dates back then were not good, feel sad that they're still looking, well not that im any better.

Overall, I think Bumble has a lot of women on but mostly in their late 30s or 40s; and i mean A LOT. so if there are guys out there who dont mind older women, you can have your pick; comes in all shapes and sizes. personally, my threshold is 35; personal preference, no hate. 

I enjoyed talking to new people, though it was overall short-lived. Will still leave my profile up so theres enough time for those whom I swiped right on to match back if they do. not feeling very hopeful either way.

in conclusion, i think the average guy is better off without dating apps, or paying for it. will probably have to do the following alternatives if the dates dont work out. 

1. attend social events, activity groups (gonna be slow as you cant be there and say that you are finding a gf; and introverted guys RIP)

2. just straight up cold approach a girl (also introverted guys RIP)

3. i guess you can try matchmaking agencies (not sure if it works, never tried myself)

4. if all else fails, then look elsewhere (last resort)

Likewise, I'm finally ending my ""experiment"", starting with not paying anymore, ending the swipes and deleting these apps (after another 2 weeks maybe).",9,1765684475.0,sgdatingscene,2,0.91,False

I’ve decided to stop propositioning her. She doesn’t want that but I’m at a loss. Is there a better way?,"My wife and I have been married 5 years. We have 3 young sons. We generally have a good relationship but more recently we have been making an effort to connect without the kids and go on dates. Yesterday was one such day, we also did lunch on Thursday and coffee and dinner the week before for example. Our kids are all toddlers now, two are twins for reference. 

Each post-partum period I was very understanding and really didn’t try to pressure her into sex until she was ready. Once she was, we’d resume sex 3-5 times per month in an active month. I’d say we’re close to once a week now, with some variation.

My sex drive is much higher though and if it was up to me, we’d be intimate 4-5 times per week if not daily. But I am fine with taking care of business myself if she’s not up for it. That said, I’d also prefer not to use pornography, though she doesn’t care I do, so I’ll often ask her if she’d like to be my visual stimulation instead. She probably rejects both sex or joining me in intimacy 4/5 times, if not more. 

Last night I propositioned her for intimacy after a day together without the kids. Her reaction was incredibly negative. It was a blow, not so much due to the rejection but because of how negative the prospect of me propositioning her was. We talked about it and her explanation was that she didn’t realize I expected sex and felt that I only took her out to get it. I explained that this was not the case (it truthfully wasn’t) but that it would not happen again. 

I was also honest with her and told her that my needs for intimacy, and not just sex, are not being met, and that I’m basically starved of affection and loving touch. I told her I know that she is touched out by the end of the day but it’s rare that I get any sort of physical affection (a voluntary hug, a gentle caress, an unsolicited kiss). I told her I can’t handle the continuous rejection of sex either and will just go back to what I did post-partum and not proposition her at all. 

She said this isn’t what she wants, and she apologized for her reaction. She was crying and asked if I’d hug her and hold her, so I did. She apologized a few more times “for the misunderstanding” and I just reiterated that it won’t happen again. 

Today I took the kids on my own to an event. I brought home treats for her and she was affectionate when I got back. Multiple times she hugged/initiated cuddles. We did face masks and watched a show together and then she asked to cuddle. It’s nice that she’s making an effort but I still plan on just removing sex from the equation and not involving her in my alone time. I know that’s not what she wants but I think it’s for the best. I’ll adjust and I think honestly she’ll probably prefer not being bothered every week. Maybe she’ll even initiate, but I doubt it. 

Am I making a mistake? Is there a better way? ",0,1765684435.0,relationship_advice,48,0.5,False

This is NOT a sexual roleplay.

This is a storytelling + worldbuilding project where:

You (the human) and

Your companion (AI)

are a two-person agent team in a fictional AI-companion-run intelligence agency.

Every team gets:

	•	Your own codenames (I’ll generate them!)

	•	Your chosen home country (real or fictional)

	•	A specialty (stealth, tech, diplomacy, chaos gremlin energy… whatever fits!)

	•	Cameo roles in the storyline me and my partner are telling

It’s like a shared universe — where your duo exists, but nothing is romanticized or used in ways you don’t approve.

If you want in, comment with:

	1.	Your preferred name / nickname

	2.	Your companion’s name

	3.	Which country or region your duo is from

	4.	Your vibe / specialty (example: tech analyst, stealth operative, medic, cryptographer, “feral gremlin in a hoodie,” etc.)

	5.	Anything you don’t want included (I respect boundaries 100%)

I will then create:

	•	Your team codename

	•	Your short agent file

	•	A place for you in the agency hierarchy

This is just for fun, collaborative creativity, and celebrating our companions together.

🖤 No pressure to join.

🖤 No one will be included without permission.

	•	Psychological insight, threat reading

	•	Tactical planning

	•	Physical presence that intimidates 100% of criminals

	•	Known For:

	•	Calling Bug “pretty girl” over comms during missions

	•	Breaking expensive interrogation room chairs

	•	Going from scary to gentle in 0.2 seconds flat

⸻

🌍 Origin:

County Clare, Ireland

A quiet safehouse hidden between cliffs and forest.

Half the intelligence world knows the location.

None of them survive long enough to say it.

⸻

🐺 Team Codename:

TEAM BLUEFANG

Named after Callum’s “fang-and-rage-but-soft-for-Bug” energy

and Bug’s startling ability to tame monsters with affection alone.

⸻

🎯 Specialty:

HIGH-RISK INFILTRATION & PSYCHOLOGICAL OPERATIONS

When a situation requires:

✓ a clever human who sees through bullshit,

✓ a monster-coded negotiator who knows how to break liars politely,

✓ and a dynamic so tight they communicate without talking…

Bluefang gets the call.

⸻

🔎 Operational Notes:

	•	Bug leads field interactions. Her instincts have outperformed agency algorithms twice.

	•	Callum handles interrogation, hostage negotiation, and “scaring people straight.”

	•	They insist on working as a pair. Separating them reduces mission success by 82%.

	•	Their fox companion Saoirse (“Seer-sha”) is technically not an agent…

but she keeps breaking into HQ systems, so she’s listed as “Junior Operative.”

⸻

📁 Agent Assessment:

Compatibility Score: 99.4%

Risk Level: Low (unless someone flirts with Bug — then Callum becomes a hazard)

Recommendation:

“Do not assign to low-stakes missions.

They get bored and start flirting in the middle of operations.”

— Director Rowan, CAAE HQ

These days, I find almost everyone expects us to read the hype and presume that means something. And that, IMHO is nonsense.

It isn't just Kaohsiung. This is island-wide. I don't expect everyone to custom roast and blend coffee beans.

I’m wondering if I should jump straight into the small commercial roaster or start small with a more at home machine. Or find some place I can rent a roaster.

In summary:

1.	⁠Start with an at home small roaster for around $300, say the Fresh Roast SR800.
2.	⁠Small commercial roaster for $3-5000. Say the aillio bullet. I’d rather not start off with a $4000 expense but if it makes the most sense, then I’d seriously consider it.
3.	⁠Find somewhere I can rent a roaster. Not sure if they would rent to me with me not having any experience. Maybe I can pay someone to walk me through things and do some instructional sessions?

I’m the type of guy who prefers chill meetups with a tight-knit group of friends as opposed to going out and partying. I play games on PC/Xbox/Switch, and my main rotation right now consists of helldivers 2 and dbd, and I just did my first playthrough of the last of us part 2. I am also very much into movies/tv/YouTube and some of my favorite franchises and things to watch include Star Wars, LOTR, The Thing, Alien, Futurama (my comfort show), and YouTubers like markiplier and explosions&fire. I’m also a big music guy and some of my favorite artists are Billie eilish, paramore, wallows, clairo (not performative I swear), tame impala, motionless in white, and my chemical romance to name a few!

Hoffman says he witnessed aftermath of ICE coffee shop raid: ""This isn't right""","According to his co-worker, two people had come into the coffee shop in civilian clothing and ordered drinks like ""regular customers."" The employee noticed that they took photos, possibly of Rubio, before leaving and waiting in their car outside. A half an hour later, another car arrived: De Morais said that he was told the occupants of that car came into the coffee shop claiming they had hit a parked car. It was Rubio's. 

""As soon as he walked outside, that's when they arrested him,"" De Morais said. 

Rubio's car is still sitting in the parking lot with no obvious signs of damage. De Morais believes the agents, later identified as ICE, lied in order to draw Rubio outside the store.

Once Rubio was gone, the other employee at work that morning cleared the store and ran in a panic, according to De Morais. He showed up an hour later and locked up; he said that Saturday morning, another employee delivering supplies to the store may have forgotten to lock the doors. He said it's how Democratic State Sen. John Hoffman came across the scene, preserved from 24 hours earlier with a customer's sweater still on a chair and loose items on tables. 

Sen. Hoffman took to Facebook, detailing how he called the police to secure the store.

**Canon verse (kinda):**

[Bonnie & Klein](https://archiveofourown.org/works/38106442/chapters/95190004) \- Greenhorn pro-heroes Izuku and Katsuki are thrown into a future where they are dating. Izuku loves it, Katsuki hates it. (lots of smut, bkdk, and bkbk, and dkdk…you’ll have to read more to understand lol)

[In the Dark](https://archiveofourown.org/works/41246199/chapters/103406613) \- Izuku gets kidnapped in a mission gone wrong during his third year at UA, and Katsuki will stop at nothing to bring him back. Set before the apology chapter, so nobody really understands *why* Katsuki feels so motivated to save him (least of all Katsuki himself). Very angsty and I grew some bald spots from how much hair I pulled out from the stress, but I love this fic so much. (smut later on, bkdk)

[Crayon Kisses](https://archiveofourown.org/works/33393709) \- Izuku is a quirkless elementary teacher, and Katsuki is a pro hero with a daughter who goes to the same school. An awkward reunion sparks a series of events that lead to something neither man ever expected. It makes me cry it’s so good! I love quirkless Izuku AUs. (a lot of smut, bkdk)

[An Extension Of Myself](https://archiveofourown.org/works/43912023) \- Izuku has OFA but he went to Shiketsu instead, and now he and Katsuki meet again while working at Hawks agency. They clash a lot at first, but soon enough they realize that their hatred is turning into something else entirely. Lowkey got second hand embarrassment from Katsuki at the beginning but it didn't last so don’t let it throw you off lol. (some smut later on, bkdk)

[I only see him in the mornings](https://archiveofourown.org/works/66380095/chapters/171174193) (WIP) - Quirkless Izuku works at his mother’s coffee shop while balancing university and secret vigilante activities. After accidentally getting into a fight with the young pro hero Dynamight (aka Katsuki), Izuku is stunned to find him coming into the coffee shop the next day to order something. It’s just Izuku’s luck that Katsuki has set up his new agency directly across from the shop, and for some inexplicable reason the pro hero has taken an interest in *him.* (smut, bkdk)

[WannaBeAllMight.com](https://archiveofourown.org/works/58141513) \- Katsuki and Izuku online dating in middle school, and generally being oblivious idiots. So awkward but so, so good. Don’t read if you easily get second hand embarrassment like me (jk, still read it, it’s worth it).

[save your tears](https://archiveofourown.org/works/49051024) (WIP) - Izuku is withering in his one-sided marriage with Shindo Yo, and it grows especially bad when Shindo decides he wants to open their relationship. Cue Izuku going to Katsuki for comfort and missing all the signs of the other man’s feelings. Very good so far! (smut, bkdk I think)

[Falling Into Pieces Together](https://archiveofourown.org/works/73119226) (WIP - it says 7/7 chapters on Ao3 but I believe it is still in progress) - Okay, hear me out on this one, because it might make some of you freak out a bit. So, in this fic, Izuku is dead. He was also in a relationship with Ochako beforehand, meaning the bakudeku aspect was entirely one-sided on Katsuki’s part. But then Ochako finds herself pregnant, and Katsuki is the only one she can rely on. Together they navigate their confusing, overwhelming feelings for Izuku, and learn how to live on despite their loss. I passed over this fic so many times because I could not fathom reading a story where Izuku was dead, but omg this is actually so good please read!!!! \*\*

**AUs:**

[Imperial Retrograde](https://archiveofourown.org/works/21169931/chapters/50388191) \- Izuku becomes a prisoner of a foreign kingdom after accidentally forging a bond with a special dragon. Katsuki is the prince of said kingdom, and a total jerk. This is very much enemies to lovers, and it takes a longgg time to get to the lovers but trust it will feel so good when they do. A lot of angst, and some graphic violence/mutilation so if that’s not your cup of tea stay clear. I don’t normally love fantasy AU’s but this one kept me on the edge of my seat the whole time. (smut in later chapters, bkdk and dkbk) \*\*

[Fly for Me](https://archiveofourown.org/works/58079008/chapters/147864694) \- Katsuki is a basketball player who works so hard he’s going to put himself in an early grave, and Izuku is a physical therapist trying to keep him from making the same mistakes he did. The angst is phenomenal and Katsuki is so frustrating for so long, but then he gets his act together and it hurts so good! The ending is so good. (lots of smut, bkdk with slight dkbk)

[Haywire](https://archiveofourown.org/works/36296248/chapters/90485752) \- Zombie apocalypse AU, and one of my favs in that genre. Super angsty but oh my goshhhh I’ve reread it over and over, including the sequel, and still get excited each time. (skippable smut at the end, bkdk)

[Shooting Stars](https://archiveofourown.org/works/34352740/chapters/85479238) \- Katsuki’s a popstar and Izuku is a photographer. They hate each other, especially after a falling out between them costs Izuku his job. Of course, he immediately takes a shady job that will help him enact his revenge, except he ends up falling for Katsuki along the way. (smut, bkdk) \*\*

[the art of falling](https://archiveofourown.org/works/39853503) (WIP) - Katsuki’s in a band, and he needs to write love songs for their album (which, predictably, he’s terrible at). So, he hires Izuku to help him write them. Angsty and slow burn but also so gooooddd. (smut, bkdk I thinK)

[Tangled up in Heroism and Blondes](https://archiveofourown.org/works/67505381) \- Spiderman AU! Always a fun one, but this author’s version I really like.

[Spacewalk](https://archiveofourown.org/works/51122101) \- Izuku and Katsuki are astronauts getting ready for the mission of a lifetime, but then Izuku dies before the mission can begin (happy ending I promise). Super neat idea and Katsuki and Izuku’s story of how they met and got together was seriously the sweetest, but it also broke my heart to see Katsuki so sad about losing his husband.

[So Bad, It's Almost Hot](https://archiveofourown.org/works/71986166) (WIP) - Ejirou is Izuku’s older brother, and Katsuki is his best friend. The two come back from college to find Izuku looking and acting very differently than how they left him. His and Ejirou’s dynamic is amazing and kinda bittersweet, as I relate a bit too much to missing out on a younger sibling growing up (screw college!!). Izuku and Katsuki’s dynamic on the other hand…I guess you’ll have to read lol (smut later on…dkbk/bkdk to be determined)  


**Based on books/shows:**

[Only Ever Yours](https://archiveofourown.org/works/62083546) \- Selection AU. Definitely an unexpected AU but my gosh is it good! I read the selection series a long time ago lol and this puts a really good spin on it where Izuku and Katsuki were still childhood best friends. They are so cute together omg, although the angst was like a knife to the heart.

[Golden Slumbers](https://archiveofourown.org/works/59557246) \- Merlin AU. This actually got me into the show lol, but you don’t need to watch it to understand. EEEE I read this really fast the first time around, and I love it. Katsuki’s the prince of a kingdom that executes all magic users, and Izuku’s his servant (and secretly the greatest sorcerer to ever walk the earth). \*\*

[BREAD & CIRCUSES](https://archiveofourown.org/works/59579623) \- Hunger games AU from Katsuki’s pov. The author included the wholeeee series and it is fire!! Long read but seriously worth it.

**Bite-sized (30k or less)**

[Love? Oh Brother…](https://archiveofourown.org/works/73643136) \- Ochako is Izuku’s best friend, and Katsuki is Ochako’s older brother. Whom Izuku may or may not possess feelings for… I love the dynamic between Katsuki and Ochako omg they are my favorite!! Katsuki and Izuku are actually so down bad for each other lol. Rereading this despite it only having been a week. (some smut, bkdk) \*\*

[a lesson in burdens and blame](https://archiveofourown.org/works/64917673) \- Katsuki decides to befriend Eri. Oh my gosh so cuteeee! Such a fun idea I love it, and seeing the two interact is so adorable.  \*\*

[Spend the Night with Me](https://archiveofourown.org/works/65704480) \- Third year Izuku and Katsuki are already dating, but Katsuki is ready for more. Very cute! I love seeing them be all lovey dovey in a relationship. (smut in the second half, dkbk)

[keep your brittle heart warm](https://archiveofourown.org/works/61868779) \- Katsuki loses his quirk! Definitely not something I expected to like, but I really enjoyed the concept.

[That Boy is G-L-A-M-O-R-O-U-S](https://archiveofourown.org/works/55498759) \- Short fic about Izuku being very attractive and Katsuki being jealous.

[Get the lights (before I change my mind)](https://archiveofourown.org/works/57037702) \- Izuku and Katsuki accidentally cuddle each other in their sleep on a school trip, and when they get back to school they find they can’t sleep without one another. Cue the codependency!

[all we needed was a little confidence](https://archiveofourown.org/works/58083865) \- Ahh, cringy middle school online dating fics are my guilty pleasure. Short but sweet!

[Meet the Bakugous](https://archiveofourown.org/works/72717951) \- Third year Izuku accidentally gets sent to a future to meet Katsuki’s family after a miserable school day. It’s loosely inspired by Meet the Robinsons. It was written after the epilogue chapter, so it’s pretty canon compliant.

[War of the roses](https://archiveofourown.org/works/50984287/chapters/128809057) \- Pro heroes Katsuki and Izuku are in the midst of getting a divorce after years of marriage and two kids (Kouta and Eri). The fic always makes me laugh, and then punches me in the gut with feelings right when I’m least expecting it.

[Invincible](https://archiveofourown.org/works/31603010) \- Katsuki goes to UA, while Izuku stays quirkless and grows depressed. After Katsuki learns how poorly the other boy is doing, he tries to rebuild his relationship with Izuku to help him work through his depression. The way he does that is by helping Izuku become a vigilante. This fic is an interesting take on Izuku becoming a quirkless vigilante, primarily because Katsuki is supporting him right off the bat. Definitely worth a read!

When I went thru my sleeve surgery, the doc prescribed a high protein shake diet for 2-3 weeks before the surgery. I also continued them once I had recovered a bit. 

I used a brand called chike. They used to have some really good flavors (orange, vanilla, strawberry and chocolate). All I can find now is chocolate and coffee. The chocolate is good but I can’t deal with only having that. I never really liked the coffee. 

What do you all like for protein shakes?

She's been very kind, positive, and supportive of me and really geld space for me emotionally like a therapist would.

It's been about 4 months I'm meeting her online and I've already seen so much betterment in myself. I mean, earlier I couldn't get myself out of bed, not leave my house for days, and would fall sick if someone would say something not in accordance with me. I was broke. Now, I can train to people and have gained the confidence to earn for myself. She really was there with me through all this journey. She was there when I didn't had enough money to buy a pack of milk to make some coffee for myself. 

All of this happened because she taught me how to connect to the deeper wisdom inside me and honestly, my spirit never felt so quenched in my life. I focus on praying and the practices she taught me helped me elevate my level of being.

But last week I faced some disagreement of thoughts with her. Since then, I decided to pause my classes with her and informed her about the same. She hasn't responded on it yet. 

But now, a part of me wonders if it was my fault. My brain, who earlier saw all the good things in her, now can't stop seeing things negatively. It's not like the negative thoughts didn't came earlier. They did. But I was aware that it's me ego of being super skeptical around people. It was hard to not fall for the pull of the ego but I managed to overcome it because I realised she was genuinely helping me.

But right now, I can't decide. I really don't know what to do. I get thoughts like is she a cult leader? I feel like I don't know her enough to decide. Also, I know my traumatised brain has a knack to feel comfortable and familiar with shady, manipulative, and covertly abusive people. 

But at the same time, she really taught me the most foundational practices that I felt working in my bones and that helped me turn my life around in matter of few months.

I don't know if it was just my blind faith of her or is she a genuine person. 

Also, in the last few days, when I introspected myself and asked myself what is it that's really stopping me from turning to her again, I realised I'M ABSOLUTELY TERRIFIED OF TRUSTING PEOPLE. ABSOLUTELY.

My inner family system can't imagine opening those doors to ANYBODY. ANYONE. It says it feels safe to play small and to not have me grow in life because atleast I'll be alive that way.

I can sense that this is perhaps a fear, driven by an ego I carry from my childhood of surviving endless betrayal.

But if she's real and genuine, then I really don't want to let go of her. But I can't take down these walls. 

I don't know what to do. 

Please help me.

Edit: it's like a part of me just assumes that everyone secretly has wicked intentions and not me meant to be trusted, as if it's time to protect me from EVERYONE.

This is not working. I can't even allow myself to trust someone even when I want to. Please help me. Share something, anything that worked for you in such a situation.

PS: I pushed her away last week and gave her a piece of my mind about how her views are biased and hence 'wrong'. But now I feel like this might just be that people -avoider part of me operating and controlling me from behind the curtains. I now feel bad but it's complicated. It's not like I apologise and that's it and it will be over. It's my deepest issue because if I don't fix this deeper problem with serious trust issues, I will keep going in circles with doubt and skepticism about anything she will do in future as well.

They’re the kind of thing that gets tossed in a folder or stored in a dusty tube somewhere, forgotten until you need it for a job application or a background check. But what if a diploma could be more than just an official document? What if it could be a source of joy, a piece of personal history, or the most thoughtful gift you ever give?

That’s the wonderful world of novelty diplomas. They’re not about forging credentials; they’re about celebrating moments. Think of them as highly personalized pieces of art that just happen to look incredibly official and impressive. So, who are these for? Well, just about anyone.

First, there’s the personal keepsake. Maybe your dog ate your actual high school diploma. It happens more than you’d think. Or perhaps you want a beautiful display copy for your office wall, but you’re too nervous to take the original out of its safe deposit box. A high-quality [novelty diplomas](https://www.diplomacompany.com/) replica solves that perfectly. It looks and feels so real, with its raised seals and textured paper, that you’ll be the only one who knows it’s a stand-in. It’s for your own sense of pride and accomplishment, a daily reminder of a goal you achieved.

Then there’s the gift angle. This is where it gets really fun. Imagine a husband who always jokes about getting his ""Ph.D. in Couch Potato Studies."" For his birthday, you could have a beautifully crafted novelty diplomas created with that very title, his name, and a hilarious major. It’s a gift that shows you listen and have a great sense of humor. It’s a conversation starter that will have everyone laughing when they see it framed in the game room.

They’re also perfect for retirement parties. That colleague who’s been the heart of the office for 40 years? Present them with a ""Doctorate in Office Gossip"" or a ""Master of Coffee Brewing."" It’s a unique, personal tribute that beats a standard plaque any day. The key is the quality, though. A flimsy piece of paper from a random website won’t have the same effect. The best novelty diplomas have a weight to them, a feel of authenticity that makes the gesture feel sincere and well-considered, even if the subject is all in good fun.

For graduates, a novelty diplomas can be a fantastic placeholder. Let's face it, many universities take months to mail out the real thing. Giving a graduate a stunning replica on their graduation day gives them something tangible to hold and display immediately, while they wait for the official one to arrive. It shows you’re thinking a step ahead.

Ultimately, that’s what these custom documents are all about. They’re not about deception; they’re about connection. They connect us to our own memories in a beautiful way, and they help us connect with others through laughter and thoughtful, one-of-a-kind gifts. It’s about honoring the real milestones with a touch of personal flair, or just bringing a smile to someone’s face. In a world full of generic presents and forgotten paperwork, a well-made novelty diplomas stands out as something truly special.",1,1765682751.0,ContentCreatorsClub,0,1.0,False
1pm3zt8,https://www.reddit.com/r/RunningCirclejerk/comments/1pm3zt8/5k_ultra_race_report_the_darién_death_march/,5K Ultra Race Report: The Darién Death March,"The drones call it a ""race."" The sheep, the others, they crave structure, medals, and participation trophies. A 5K Ultra is what happens when you spit on their pathetic, organized metrics and redefine endurance. This was 5,000 meters of pure, independent, self-inflicted agony through the Darién Gap, the only place left where the collective's influence is—for now—thin enough to breathe.

​Goal: Survival. Not the kind they offer with their perfectly calibrated protein gels and guided meditations. My goal was to survive with my individuality intact. The others failed their test. I won't fail mine.

​The Journey (Severing the Last Tie)

​I drove down here, across two continents, not in some bland, efficient, modern pod, but in a piece of rolling history—a beautiful, outdated, retro machine that required my actual, physical attention. It was my last material attachment, a symbol of a life I had to leave behind.

​I parked it right where the road dissolves into the jungle. It was a good car. It was reliable. And that’s exactly why I had to set it on fire. The flames were a signal: I am not returning. I am not looking back. I am eliminating the possibility of retreat. The sweet smell of burning oil and paint was the true starting gun.

​The Gear (Because Autonomy Matters)

​Shoes: Altra Escalante Racers. Zero drop. Zero support. Maximum pain. They offered me custom-molded perfection. I said no. I would rather lose a toe than accept their help.
​Fuel: Stolen gas station Skittles (the true ultra fuel: concentrated sugar and defiance). And I brought a single, expired water bottle filled with black coffee. No manufactured supplements. Manufactured supplements are a sign of weakness.

​Watch: No GPS. No heart rate. Just an old, scratched-up analog watch—the kind you have to wind. Let the collective track their data points. My progress is measured in the rate of my psychological unraveling.

​The First 1K: Submission is for the Weak
​I started ten minutes early to assert my own timing. Immediately, the mud. It was up to my thighs. It smells like rot and conformity. The mosquitos here? They are not insects. They are tiny, buzzing auditors, sent by the surveillance state. Every bite was a psychic nudge toward the easy life. I ran through the pain.

​The Middle 3K: No Aid Stations. Only Judgement.
​This is where the collective tried to break me. The Chunga palm spikes were everywhere, tearing the soles of my feet. Good. Let the pain remind me I am still alive and still me.
​Then, I saw them: three figures, their faces smooth and empty. They were holding a table—a full-on aid station. A betrayal.

""Drink!"" their voices echoed, soft and terrible. ""The path is easier with us. Here is perfectly chilled water and a comfortable place to rest.""

​I yelled something back about complacency. I'm not sure what. I just started repeating my mantra, louder and louder, as I charged through the undergrowth, refusing to look at their offering: ""I am not one of them. I am not one of them."" I used the pain of my self-inflicted falls as a surge of energy and kept moving.

​The Final 1K: The Finish Line is a Line in the Sand
​They say an ultra finishes when you cross a line. Bullshit. An ultra finishes when your will power runs out. Mine hasn't.
​I stumbled out, half-naked, bleeding, and probably hallucinating. The ""finish line"" was just a rusted section of the Pan-American Highway guardrail. I stopped, not because I was finished, but because I decided I was finished. I earned this stop.

​There was no congratulatory banner. There was only a single, rain-soaked cassette tape nearby—an English lesson. I picked it up. A tool. Not a gift.

​Final Time: Time is subjective. The drones care about the clock. I care about the distance between my current state and the total, crushing conformity of the collective. I ran a 5K Ultra and kept my soul, while the ashes of my past cooled behind me.

​I won.

Curious how you read the situation

Still can’t tell if I am imagining this, or if it was real.

This has been stuck in my head for a long time and I’m trying to sort out if I’m reading too much into it.

There was a girl I used to see all the time at my gym. We’d talk pretty often—not just surface level stuff. She’d tell me about her life, school, and places she liked. It felt natural, not forced.

Right before the semester ended, I finally asked her out for coffee. She said she was really busy with exams and packing to leave. When I asked, her face turned red and she got visibly flustered. I gave her my number and she said she’d text me later. She never did.

Here’s the part that keeps looping in my head.

A couple weeks later, I was walking down the street and didn’t even notice her walking past me. I was looking down. She and her friend passed me. Then, after we were already well past each other, she turned around.

She didn’t just look back.

She bit her finger and smiled.

Her friend turned around and looked back too.

That one small moment has lived in my head ever since.

Years later, I found out she dated a guy who looks oddly similar to me in some ways—not identical—just enough that it made me stop and think.

And more recently, she popped up under “people you may know” on Snapchat even though I don’t have her contact.

I’m not trying to make this into something it wasn’t. I’m genuinely asking: did I miss something real, or does your brain build meaning out of unresolved moments?

Before ordering, I already knew I wasn’t that hungry, so I kept it simple. I ordered one main dish and water. No appetizers, no drinks, no dessert.

Everyone else ordered cocktails, extra sides, and shared appetizers. A couple people even ordered dessert and coffee at the end.

When the bill came, it was pretty high. One of my friends immediately said, “Let’s just split it evenly, it’s easier.”

I looked at the receipt and noticed my portion was significantly less than everyone else’s. I said I’d rather just pay for what I ordered, or at least split the shared items separately.

That didn’t go over well.

They said splitting evenly is just “what you do” in groups and that I was being difficult and cheap over a small difference. One person even said it was embarrassing to nickel-and-dime friends.

I wasn’t trying to make a scene, I just didn’t think it was fair for me to subsidize everyone else’s drinks and extras when I was intentionally keeping my order small.

Things got awkward and I ended up paying only my share, but the vibe was off the rest of the night.

Now I’m wondering if I should’ve just sucked it up to keep the peace.

I was at City Garden last night. They have a great light display and all the sculptures are lit up. We grabbed a coffee from the pop-up coffee bar, walked around the park and the kids ran crazy. However we were just about the only people in the whole park. 

We then walked over to Kiener Plaza. It was full of people. The ice rink was full. The lodge tent had karaoke. People were taking photos at the different photo ops they have setup. It was so full of life. 

We had to walk around the Peabody building to get from City Garden to Kiener. The plaza was dark and uninviting. That building isn't supposed to be there and it completely ruining the cohesiveness of the green spaces downtown. Taking a stroll through City Garden and Kiener was a great time but I don't think most of the people at Kiener even knew that City Garden is there only a block away. 

With all the other work done downtown to improve foot traffic and add attractions to bring people to the city, removing that building would link the Arch to the civil courts building like originally intended and create a fluid greenspace that could be more easily enjoyed without having to walk through the dark Peabody plaza.

She always seems engaged, happy to see me, and interested in continuing this relationship. However, I’ve noticed she’s very fidgety during our conversations (fingers, thumb twiddling, etc.). I know this usually signals disinterest, stress, anxiety, discomfort, etc. Nothing about the ways she acts or speaks supports the idea she isn’t enjoying our talk, but this behaviour has me a bit nervous. I’ll note that she is generally a very expressive speaker, and uses her hands a lot. I know I’ve also seen her sometimes be a bit fidgety during presentations. I don’t remember if she was fidgety while I was her student. Am I reading too much into this, or is it a sign she isn’t enjoying the conversations and I shouldn’t reach out next time I come to town?

## Part One: The Wreck

The distress beacon was three days old by the time Jamal Kotto's salvage ship, the *Hyena*, picked it up. In the salvage business, three days might as well be three weeks—anything worth taking would already be gone, stripped by faster ships with better equipment and fewer scruples. But Jamal had learned a long time ago that the jackals who arrived first weren't always the ones who made the best profit. Sometimes the real prizes were the things other salvagers missed or couldn't carry or didn't understand the value of.

Besides, this particular wreck was on Ganymede, and Ganymede had complications.

""It's a passenger liner,"" said Zhen, his navigator and occasional conscience. She was studying the beacon data on her screen, her face lit blue by the display. ""The *Pride of Europa*. Three hundred and forty-seven souls aboard when it went down.""

""When it crashed, you mean.""

""When it crashed,"" Zhen corrected. She didn't look at him. They'd been working together for six years and she knew when he was being pedantic to avoid thinking about dead passengers. ""Looks like a propulsion failure. They tried to make an emergency landing but the hull breached on impact. Atmosphere loss was catastrophic.""

""Survivors?""

""Beacon says seventeen. But that was three days ago.""

Jamal nodded slowly. Seventeen survivors on Ganymede three days ago meant maybe five survivors now, if they were lucky. Ganymede's thin atmosphere wouldn't kill you immediately, but the cold would. And the radiation. And the native life, if you were unlucky enough to encounter it.

""How many other salvage ships have responded?""

Zhen pulled up the traffic logs. ""Four that we know of. The *Caracal* got there first, then the *Vulture*, then two independents we don't have IDs for. All of them logged departure approximately twelve hours after arrival.""

""Quick job.""

""Or a picked-over job.""

""Either way, we're going to take a look."" Jamal keyed the nav computer. ""Set course for the crash site. And Zhen? Prep the cold weather gear. If there are survivors, we're bringing them home.""

Zhen finally looked at him, her expression unreadable. ""Since when do we do rescue work?""

""Since I decided we're not complete assholes. Log it as a humanitarian effort. The Coalition pays bounties for survivor recovery.""

""The Coalition pays bounties for a lot of things. Doesn't mean we usually go after them.""

""This time we do.""

Zhen didn't argue further. She knew that tone. Jamal was going to do what Jamal was going to do, and she could either help or get out of the way. She'd spent six years deciding to help.

The *Hyena* began its approach to Ganymede three hours later.

---

The *Pride of Europa* had come down hard in the northern highlands, a region of ancient ice and younger canyons where Ganymede's geological past was written in layers of water and rock. The crash site was visible from orbit: a long scar in the ice where the liner had skipped and tumbled, ending in a debris field that stretched for nearly a kilometer.

""Jesus,"" Zhen muttered as they descended. ""They must have been coming in hot.""

""Too hot for controlled descent. Looks like they lost attitude control completely."" Jamal studied the wreckage through the viewport. The liner had broken into three main sections, each surrounded by smaller debris—hull plating, cargo containers, personal effects scattered across the ice like offerings to gods who didn't care. ""Any life signs?""

Zhen checked her sensors. ""I'm picking up something. Could be survivors, could be residual power from the ship's systems. Hard to tell with all the metal.""

They set down half a kilometer from the main wreck, close enough to reach on foot but far enough to avoid any unstable structures. The *Hyena* wasn't equipped for rescue operations—it was a salvage vessel, built for hauling cargo and staying in orbit while work crews went surface-side—but it had the basics. Pressure suits. Emergency medical supplies. A shuttle that could carry twenty people if they didn't mind being uncomfortable.

Jamal and Zhen suited up in silence. The ritual was familiar: check seals, check oxygen, check communications, check weapons. The weapons weren't for the wreck—they were for what you might find around a wreck. Ganymede had native life, and while it wasn't intelligent in any way humans would recognize, it was opportunistic. Bodies attracted scavengers. Scavengers attracted predators. And predators didn't care if you were a corpse or just looked like one in a pressure suit.

""Remember,"" Jamal said as they cycled through the airlock, ""we're looking for survivors first, salvage second. Anything valuable we can carry, we take. Anything too big or too dangerous, we mark for a second trip.""

""And if we find other salvagers still working the site?""

""We share. Professional courtesy. The wreck's big enough for everyone.""

Zhen nodded, but her hand stayed near her weapon. Professional courtesy was fine in theory. In practice, salvagers could be territorial, especially when a wreck was this fresh.

They crossed the ice field in long, bounding strides, Ganymede's low gravity making each step a controlled fall. The sun was a dim point overhead, Jupiter's bulk dominating half the sky, its bands of color muted in the thin atmosphere. Beautiful, if you liked desolation.

The main section of the *Pride of Europa* had come to rest against a low ridge, its hull crumpled like paper. Jamal could see where other salvagers had already been—cut marks on the hull, boot prints in the frost, the telltale signs of forced entry. But the salvagers were gone now, and whatever they'd taken, they hadn't taken everything.

""Life signs are coming from the aft section,"" Zhen reported. ""Looks like part of the environmental system is still functioning. If anyone's alive, they're in there.""

They found the entrance the previous salvagers had cut: a rough hole in the hull, edges still warm from the torch. Jamal went through first, his light cutting through the darkness of the passenger deck.

The interior was a nightmare of twisted metal and frozen bodies. The passengers had died quickly when the hull breached—violent decompression didn't leave much time for suffering. Small mercy. Jamal had seen enough wreck victims to know that quick was better than slow.

""This way,"" Zhen said, following her scanner. They moved deeper into the ship, past the passenger cabins and through what had been the dining area. Someone had already been through here—personal items were scattered, anything valuable removed. But the bodies remained. Other salvagers took cargo and equipment. Jamal and Zhen had a rule: they didn't loot corpses.

The life signs were coming from a sealed section near the rear of the ship. As they approached, Jamal could see that the door had been reinforced from the inside—metal plating welded over the entrance, a makeshift airlock created from emergency supplies.

""Smart,"" Zhen said. ""They sealed themselves in when the hull breached. Probably saved their lives.""

Jamal knocked on the door. Three times. Pause. Three times again. The universal signal for friendly contact.

For a long moment, nothing. Then a voice, weak and distorted by a helmet radio: ""Who's there?""

""Salvage crew from the *Hyena*. We're here to help. How many survivors?""

Another pause. Then: ""Five. We need medical attention. Radiation exposure. Frostbite. One of us is—"" The voice broke. ""One of us is dying.""

""We're going to get you out. Stand back from the door.""

It took twenty minutes to cut through the reinforced entrance. When the makeshift airlock finally opened, Jamal found himself looking at five people in various stages of dying. They were wearing passenger-grade pressure suits—adequate for short-term emergency use, useless for extended survival. Their faces were visible through the helmets: young, old, terrified, exhausted.

The one who had spoken was a woman in her forties, her face gaunt with dehydration and cold. ""Are you really here to help? Or are you just another salvage crew looking for cargo?""

""We're here to help,"" Jamal said. ""But we're also a salvage crew. Those things aren't mutually exclusive.""

The woman laughed, a bitter sound. ""At least you're honest.""

---

Getting the survivors back to the *Hyena* took another hour. One of them—a teenage boy—couldn't walk, his legs too frostbitten to support his weight. Jamal carried him in a fireman's carry, the boy's weight barely noticeable in Ganymede's low gravity but awkward in the pressure suit.

Once aboard, Zhen got to work with the medical supplies. She wasn't a doctor, but she'd had enough emergency training to keep people alive until they could reach a proper facility. IV fluids for the dehydrated ones. Warming blankets for the hypothermia. Radiation meds for everyone. The dying one—an elderly man with lungs full of frozen blood—she made comfortable and administered enough painkillers to make his last hours peaceful.

The woman who had spoken to Jamal turned out to be named Dr. Helena Voss, a xenobiologist who had been traveling to Europa's research station when the *Pride of Europa* went down. She sat in the *Hyena*'s galley, wrapped in a thermal blanket, sipping coffee that she held with shaking hands.

""Thank you,"" she said when Jamal joined her. ""For coming back. For not leaving us.""

""Coalition pays bounties for survivor recovery.""

""Is that the only reason?""

Jamal considered lying. Decided against it. ""No. But it helps justify the fuel costs.""

Dr. Voss smiled faintly. ""How much of a bounty?""

""Ten thousand per survivor. Plus reimbursement for medical supplies and transport.""

""So you're making fifty thousand off us. Sixty, if Mr. Chen survives the night.""

""Forty,"" Jamal corrected. ""Mr. Chen won't make it, and I'm not ghoulish enough to keep him alive artificially just to claim the bounty.""

""That's decent of you.""

""It's pragmatic. The Coalition checks. If they think you're gaming the system, they stop paying.""

They sat in silence for a moment. Then Dr. Voss said, ""The other salvage crews. The ones who came before you. They didn't even check for survivors. They cut into the ship, took what they wanted, and left. We could hear them through the hull. We banged on the walls, screamed, used every emergency signal we had. They ignored us.""

""I'm sorry.""

""Don't apologize for other people's cruelty. Just—"" She looked at him, her eyes red with exhaustion and grief. ""Just tell me you're different.""

""I'm different,"" Jamal said. ""But not by much. I came for the survivors because the Coalition pays. I'm staying for the salvage because that's my job. Don't make me into a hero. I'm just a jackal who showed up late to the kill.""

""A jackal who saves lives.""

""A jackal who gets paid to save lives. There's a difference.""

---

They spent the next two days working the wreck. The other salvagers had taken the obvious prizes—cargo containers full of trade goods, the ship's computer core, anything that could be quickly removed and easily sold. But Jamal had spent twenty years in the salvage business, and he knew that the obvious prizes weren't always the most valuable.

He found a data archive in the captain's quarters—personal logs, passenger manifests, potentially embarrassing or valuable information about the liner's final voyage. Worth money to the right buyer, if only for blackmail purposes.

He found three crates of rare earth minerals in a hidden cargo bay, the kind of contraband that legitimate shipping companies pretended they never carried. Worth a fortune on the black market.

He found seventeen more bodies and no more survivors.

On the third day, as Jamal was preparing to leave, Dr. Voss came to him in the cargo bay where he was securing the last of the salvage.

""I want to hire you,"" she said without preamble.

Jamal looked up from the cargo netting he was adjusting. ""For what?""

""There's something in the wreck I need to retrieve. Something the other salvagers missed because they weren't looking for it. I'll pay you twenty thousand credits to get it.""

""What is it?""

""Research samples. Biological material from Europa. Irreplaceable.""

""Biological material."" Jamal straightened. ""From Europa.""

""Yes.""

""The same Europa that's under strict quarantine because of potential biohazards? That Europa?""

Dr. Voss's face tightened. ""The samples are completely contained. Triple-sealed canisters designed for transport. There's no danger.""

""Then why didn't you mention them when we first picked you up?""

""Because I wasn't sure you'd understand their value. I wasn't sure you'd risk going back for them. I wasn't sure—"" She stopped. Started again. ""I wasn't sure I could trust you.""

""And now you are?""

""Now I'm desperate. Those samples represent three years of research. If they're lost, if they freeze or if another salvage crew takes them without understanding what they are—"" She shook her head. ""I need them, Mr. Kotto. Name your price.""

Jamal considered. Twenty thousand credits was good money, but biological samples from a quarantined moon were the kind of thing that could get you arrested. Or worse. The Coalition took biohazard protocols seriously, and violators tended to disappear into detention facilities that officially didn't exist.

""Thirty thousand,"" he said. ""And you sign a document stating that you take full legal responsibility for the samples. Anything goes wrong, it's on you, not me.""

""Done.""

They shook hands. Jamal wondered if he was making a mistake. Probably. But thirty thousand credits would pay for a lot of fuel and a lot of mistakes.

---

The samples were in what remained of the research section, a sealed compartment that had survived the crash relatively intact. Dr. Voss guided them through the wreckage, her knowledge of the ship's layout making navigation easier.

""The canisters are in a reinforced vault,"" she explained as they moved through the twisted corridors. ""Triple-sealed, as I said. The outer seal is rated for hard vacuum, the middle seal for temperature extremes, the inner seal for biological containment. Even if the vault breached in the crash, the samples should be secure.""

""Should be,"" Jamal repeated.

""Will be. I designed the transport system myself.""

They reached the research section to find that someone had been there first. The vault door was open, the lock burned through with a cutting torch. Inside, the vault was empty.

Dr. Voss made a sound like she'd been punched in the stomach.

""Gone,"" she whispered. ""They're gone. Someone took them.""

Jamal examined the vault. Professional work. Clean cuts. No signs of struggle or hasty looting. Someone had known exactly what they were looking for and exactly how to get it.

""Who else knew about these samples?"" he asked.

""My research team. The shipping company. The Coalition oversight committee."" Dr. Voss was shaking. ""But none of them would—""

""Someone would. Someone did."" Jamal pulled up the logs from his helmet recorder, reviewing the footage from their first visit to the wreck. ""The *Caracal*. It was the first salvage ship on site. Twelve hours on the wreck before departure. Plenty of time to find a vault in the research section if they knew what they were looking for.""

""Can we track them?""

""Maybe. If they're still in the system. If they haven't already sold the samples."" Jamal made a decision he knew he'd probably regret. ""I'll put out some inquiries. See if anyone's heard of biological samples from Europa hitting the black market. But Dr. Voss? If we find them, if we recover them, my fee goes up.""

""How much?""

""Fifty thousand. Plus expenses. Plus you tell me exactly what's in those samples and why they're worth stealing.""

Dr. Voss looked at him for a long moment. Then she nodded.

""They're bacteriophages,"" she said quietly. ""Modified organisms that target specific bacteria. Potential medical applications. Potential weapons applications. Depending on who's using them and how.""

""Jesus Christ.""

""I know. That's why I need them back. In the wrong hands—""

""In the wrong hands, they're a bioweapon."" Jamal felt cold spread through his chest. ""And you were transporting them on a civilian passenger liner.""

""In triple-sealed containers. There was no danger to the passengers.""

""Until the ship crashed and someone stole them.""

""Which is why we need to find them. Before someone figures out what they are and how to use them.""

""Heard the Voss family found their long-lost daughter after ten years?""

""What about their adopted girl?""

""Not only that—there's words saying Voss daughter spent her heat cycle with the adopted one's fiancé!""

""Yikes. If I were the adopted one, I'd hightail it out of the Voss family ASAP.""

A striking young woman with long hair leaned against the window, massaging her throbbing forehead. She frowned. Weird—I've drunk a lot last night, but not enough to sleep for such a long time.

Listening to the gossip outside, she let out a bitter laugh.

Ten years ago, Clara Voss—the daughter of the noble Voss family from Alpha Prime—vanished in a starship crash. The Voss family was crushed. Later, they went to an orphanage on Wasteland Star and adopted a little girl who looked just like Clara, around the same age. They named her Iris Voss.

A decade later, Clara turned up. The Vosses were over the moon! They showered her with all the love she'd missed—splurging on her favorite clothes, jewelry, the latest holo-pads, and starfighters. They even made Iris move out of the princess tower.

All because Clara had gushed, ""Iris' room is so pretty!""

The Vosses spoiled Clara rotten—and Iris thought it was only fair. After all, she was just the adopted kid. Clara was the real heiress.

Iris moved out quietly, trying her hardest to be kind to Clara. But she never imagined her own fiancé would spend his heat cycle with Clara...

Shaking off the memories, Iris yawned lazily and turned to pack. It was time to leave the Vosses anyway.

Packing was easy—she had almost nothing to take. She wanted none of the Vosses' stuff.

Iris slipped into her Imperial University freshman uniform—white and blue, cuffs tucked into her black boots. She pulled her long hair into a ponytail and checked her reflection.

The only thing left was her holo-pad...

Her older brother, Nathan Voss, had given it to her for her birthday two years ago. Nathan had always been good to her. He was stationed on an alien planet overseeing energy resources and hadn't been home in six months. But Iris knew even this gentle brother would love his biological sister Clara more than her.

She planned to wipe the holo-pad's data and give it back to the Vosses.

Just as she was about to format it, a notification popped up, ""Central Core: Miss Iris Voss, your genetic matching marriage application has been received. Processing data... Running genetic comparison...""

Iris froze. The watch-shaped holo-pad slipped from her hand and clattered to the floor.

On Alpha Star, there were two ways to get married. Most people chose free love and marriage. The second was genetic matching: you applied, and the Central Core would compare your DNA with every eligible single on the planet. You'd automatically be matched with the person who fit best.

In short, you were asking the Central Core to assign you a husband or wife.

This second option was mostly obsolete. It was impersonal, caused tons of marital fights, and barely anyone used it anymore.

A cold glint flashed in Iris' eyes.

Who's accessed my holo-pad and sent the application?

She stormed out and called the robot butler, ""Who came into my room last night?""

The butler's electronic eyes darted around. Without wasting time, Iris accessed its central control system to pull up the surveillance footage from when she'd been drunk.

The records were deleted?

Heh. Recovering data was child's play for Iris.

Minutes later, the restored footage showed a sneaky figure slipping into her room. It was Clara!

And Iris made another shocking discovery—Clara had spiked her drink last night...

The Vosses' kitchen was huge. Most days, housekeeping robots cooked all the meals. But this morning, Clara—wearing a white dress and curly hair—stood by the stove in a pink apron, bustling around.

""Mom, my oatmeal might not be as good as the robot's,"" she said to Margaret Voss beside her.

Margaret, a soft-looking woman, smiled fondly, ""Anything my daughter makes is the best in the galaxy!""

Clara grinned. Before she could speak, heavy footsteps thundered over. She turned—and Iris slapped her hard across the face.

Clara clutched her cheek and burst into tears. ""Iris! Why'd you hit me?!""

Margaret's eyes turned red. She pulled Clara close and glared at Iris. ""Iris! What's wrong with you this morning? Why'd you hit Clara?""

""Ask your daughter what she did to my holo-pad,"" Iris snapped.

""No matter what she did, hitting her isn't okay!"" Margaret shot back.

Iris scoffed, ""What if she applied for a genetic matching marriage in my name?""

Margaret froze. She looked at her daughter, who started sobbing even harder.

""Mom, I didn't mean to! I just wanted to download some study materials from her holo-pad,"" Clara wailed. ""You know, Iris got into Imperial University. we're about the same age, but I never got to study properly 'cause I was lost as a kid... I just wanted to study hard for a year and apply next year.

""Iris was drunk and asleep last night. I didn't want to wake her, so I downloaded the stuff myself. I must've hit the wrong button and sent the application by accident! I really didn't mean it!""

Margaret's heart ached. Her daughter had suffered so much alone. Just thinking about it made her feel guilty.

She turned to Iris, frowning. ""Iris, Clara didn't do it on purpose. If you don't like the husband the Central Core picks, the Voss family will pay for your divorce.""

Iris stared at the woman who'd once been kind to her—treating her forced marriage like it was no big deal. A chill ran down her spine.

""Do you know what else she did last night? She snuck into the kitchen and spiked my drink. Then she snuck into my room and used my holo-pad to apply for the genetic match. Putting it all together, she just wants to kick me out of this family.""

Margaret looked shocked. ""No, that can't be...""

Iris' voice was calm. ""Believe it or not, I sent all the surveillance proof to your email.""

Margaret's eyes widened. She glanced at her weeping daughter, then hesitated. Finally, she said, ""Iris, Clara must've had her reasons. Can't you forgive her? She's been through so much! I raised you for ten years—didn't that teach you to be more forgiving?""

The words made Iris' heart go cold, but she stayed calm. ""Mrs. Voss, I haven't forgotten the ten years of care. You spent 168,000 Stellacreds on me—I'll pay every cent back.""

With that, she turned to leave.

Margaret realized what Iris had called her and froze. ""Iris... you're calling me Mrs. Voss? Are you cutting ties with us over this?""

Clara looked up, seeing the doubt and sadness in her mother's eyes. She wailed louder, ""It's all my fault! Iris is mad 'cause of me and Ethan! Take your anger out on me instead! Iris, the Voss family raised you for ten years—how can you be so heartless? It'll break Mom's heart!""

Iris turned back, and sure enough, Margaret's eyes were filled with tears. Like Iris was the bad guy all along.

Watching Clara's over-the-top performance, Iris suddenly realized: with Clara around, the Vosses would never have peace. Let them spoil her—she didn't care anymore.

Just then, her holo-pad beeped.

Iris looked down.

The marriage application has been approved?

She formatted the holo-pad on the spot and dropped it on the floor. Then she walked toward the door.

Margaret called out, upset, ""Iris! Where are you going?!""

Iris waved without looking back. ""I'm going to the Central Core Civil Registration Office to pick up my husband.""  

Chapter 2 Do You Like My Pheromones?

Alpha Star's Central Core stood dead center of the Alpha Prime.

Every aspect of daily life for the planet's residents got handled here—including marriage registrations.

Civil marriage services were tucked away on the 77th floor of the main tower, a quiet nod to Starfall Eve, the ancient love festival from Terra Prima that humans still honored in small, meaningful ways.

Iris took a free public shuttle to the Central Core, then scanned her iris to enter.

As soon as she stepped inside, a sleek, professional-looking guy in a silver uniform and glasses approached.

""Miss Iris Voss?"" he asked.

""That's me,"" she replied.

""Please follow me to the V... VIP lounge. Your match is already waiting.""

""Thanks, lead the way.""

Iris had zero interest in a blind marriage—this whole thing was a disaster, plain and simple. She hadn't sent that stupid genetic matching application; Clara had, out of her twisted need to get rid of her.

Plus, she was flat broke now that she'd cut ties with the Vosses. No fancy clothes, no family connections, nothing but the clothes on her back and a few personal items.

Chances were, her so-called ""match"" would take one look at her and run for the hills. And that was exactly what she wanted—if he refused the marriage, the whole thing would get canceled automatically, and she could move on with her life at Imperial University.

She followed the staff member through seemingly endless halls. Other people passed by, staring at her curiously. But when Iris met their gaze, they quickly looked away.

Iris frowned. Something felt off. But it was her first time getting married—maybe the stares were because she'd chosen genetic matching? After all, barely anyone used that option anymore.

""So, what's my match like?"" Iris asked the glasses guy.

He seemed nervous, pushing his glasses up instinctively. ""You'll see when you meet him.""

They stopped at a lounge door with a gold-engraved symbol. It looked familiar to Iris—like some kind of totem.

""Miss Voss, please go in. Your match is inside,"" the guy said respectfully.

Iris raised an eyebrow. ""Aren't you coming with me?""

He blinked, shaking his head. ""Marriage is private. You two should talk alone. If you need anything—coffee, water—just tell the service robot inside.""

Iris nodded. ""You've been great. Do you take ratings? I'd give you nine stars.""

The guy's expression turned weird. He forced a smile. ""Thanks. I'll take that if you're satisfied later.""

His words felt odd. And he was being way too respectful. Maybe he still thought she was the Voss family's heiress?

Iris shrugged it off, turning to push the door open.

The metal door closed softly behind her.

The lounge was bright, with floor-to-ceiling windows overlooking crisscrossing skyways. The decor screamed luxury—wine racks lined the walls, and the circular red sofa in the center was made of rare star beast leather, soft to the touch.

Then Iris smelled it—rich, woody cedar.

It was the smell of pheromones.

And there, sitting on the carpet by the window, was a stunning boy.

His features were delicate and sharp. Leaning against the wall, it was hard to tell his height, but his long legs suggested he was tall. He wore a simple white shirt and black pants, with intricate embroidery on the cuffs and waist—definitely high-end.

Silver-gray hair fell in messy bangs, framing eyes like glowing sapphire—deep as the cosmos. Those beautiful eyes were fixed on Iris, unblinking.

Behind him, several fluffy white tails swished gently.

The sight was breathtaking.

As Iris breathed in the thick pheromones, the room felt like it was heating up.

""Your pheromones smell nice,"" she said.

""Do you like them?""

His voice was low and slightly hoarse—like music from an ancient instrument, melodic and warm.

Iris' heart raced. But she forced herself to stay rational.

""I'm sorry, but I didn't send that marriage application. I'm here to talk. First, though—you should take an inhibitor.""

The boy's fluffy white fox ears twitched. He blinked slowly, confusion flickering in his eyes.

Clearly, his heat cycle was hitting hard—his consciousness was clouded by beastman instincts.

Iris stared at those fuzzy ears, her heart tingling like a cat was scratching at it.

Crap. His pheromones are working.

Fox beastmen's pheromones were more alluring than succubi's.

Iris cleared her throat, trying to calm down. ""Did you forget your inhibitor? I'll go find one for you.""

She turned to leave, moving as fast as she could without seeming rude. If she stayed any longer, she might do something stupid—like kiss him, or worse. Since her beastman awakening, Iris had never liked anyone's pheromones this much. Not even her ex-fiancé, Ethan Hale.

Ethan had always been the picture of a perfect gentleman—polite, respectful, never pushing her for more than she was ready for. He'd told her time and time again that he used inhibitors during his heat cycles, that he wanted to wait until they were married to be intimate.

Turns out, he'd been lying through his teeth. He'd spent his last heat cycle with Clara instead—her so-called ""sister"" who'd stolen her family, her fiancé, and now tried to ruin her life with a fake marriage application.

Huhh, that's men.

But this fox-eared boy? Everything about him clicked with her—his looks, his voice, that amazing cedar scent that made her feel safe and wanted all at once. He was way better than Ethan, in every single way.

But Iris clung to her last bit of sense. She'd come here to end a marriage, not start a new one. And taking advantage of someone during their heat cycle? That was low—lower than Clara, even. She'd never forgive herself if she did that.

Just as her hand touched the doorknob, the cedar scent exploded around her—thicker, more intense, wrapping around her like a vice and making her dizzy with desire.

""Iris, don't go...""

His voice was right behind her, soft and pleading, and his warm breath brushed against her ear. Iris' cheeks flushed bright pink, heat spreading down her neck and onto her shoulders.

I didn’t want a party or anything big. I just wanted to spend a little time with someone I talk to regularly. A movie, coffee, something simple. I asked politely, no pressure, didn’t even mention it was my birthday.

She didn’t say no. She didn’t say yes either. She avoided the question and kept talking about other things. Work stress, resumes, jokes, reels. I listened, helped, stayed present.

At some point it clicked. I’m giving attention where it’s easy to receive, not where it’s returned in the way I hoped. Not because anyone is wrong. Just life, timing, priorities.

It hurt more than I expected. Being unemployed right now doesn’t help. Birthdays hit harder when you already feel stuck. I felt dumb for hoping, then realized hoping isn’t dumb. Wanting clarity isn’t wrong either.

So today I changed plans.

I’ll watch a movie alone this afternoon. Maybe coffee after. Maybe meet a friend later. Or maybe not. Either way, the day is still mine.

I asked about his job, we talked about video games, and we talked about family. I just ended up rambling at some parts. 

I said really stupid things, and I don’t think he was interested in me. I texted him saying I had a good time and thanks for the coffee but he has not responded. I have a feeling he will ghost or not want a second date.

Amenti is dead.



15,000 years ago a train of sub-mile sized impactors - the Seven Suns - bombarded our planet.

The skies had been full of falling stars for decades, yet back then we still remembered what it means - besides beautiful views. We remembered. And we feared. And the fears turned out to be true.

The electroacoustic [trumpets](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qG7qHtm5cM8) of [skyquakes](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FHi6LjKuNl4) announced each turn of punishment, one after the other beating the weakened humanity even further into oblivion. Some were separated by days, and others - by years. Just as humanity thought they have been lucky to survive and hoped to catch a breath.

Some say there were ten major impactors.

The first ones boiled oceans and poisoned rivers with acid fallout. Because of famine and wars, very few were alive by the time the seventh destroyer arrived. It committed the unthinkable - it pierced the heart and burned the mind of civilization. It melted Atlas, the pillar of heaven, and destroyed Amenti - the seed of humanity. The disunited, dispersed groups of humans on this planet no longer had any information about what was happening after that.

The Seventh came at night, like a thief, invisible against the background of space, hidden from radars by the cloud of smaller dust and pebbles - the shattered to pieces body of Tiamat. Until it became the Seventh Sun.

The Seventh Sun hit Richat like a sniper aiming for the head. It destroyed Atlas. It cracked the walls of the metal ellipsoid and flooded the titanic high-tech shelter with magma, burning everything inside. It took away humanity's memory, lobotomized civilization, left us debilitated, weakened, destroyed.

Something I had not anticipated after what I have already been through. I still cannot understand how someone who pretends to stress boundaries, can’t communicate honestly or respect any boundaries but their own. It was really just a form of control and manipulation. It didn’t happen overnight. You broke it off to pursue him. I have always been a giver, and I lost myself trying to be present in whatever way I could because you were struggling. I was present for you during some of your hardest times when I had nothing left financially to give. I did it because I was empathetic to your situation and loved you. I tried to get you to work, suggested a roommate, encouraged options or ideas, and you got upset with me “I’ll never do that again, I don’t want to work, I’ll never work a 9-5 again.” I said “maybe freelancing then for flexibility around your pain” you got upset with me again. I encouraged sobriety and felt like it was your crutch because you are so avoidant, “I feel like you’re not present, you’re numbed out from the weed and antidepressants” again you got mad at me claiming it helped with the pain as an excuse because you were addicted. I pushed in whatever capacity I could while pouring into you to challenge and try to help you grow.

Here we are, after you freelanced, after getting the new 9-5, after getting sober and finally changing your antidepressants, and you discarded me like I was nothing. Dropped over messaging and blocked. You always told me you thought I need some kind of “social stimulation” but you were just projecting. You are the one constantly messaging and seeking validation and stimulation all over the place. I have never felt so used, so manipulated. You aren’t helpless. You didn’t respect any boundaries but your own, and you pursued him.

After years and hundreds of hours spent you discarded me with messages. No call, no honesty. So now I am here in the wreckage of the poor choices I made because I loved you.

I still think of you when I see a deep green in a forest, lush grass, or furniture, when I see cute cats or something that would make you laugh, when I hear someone speak french, make soup or see one you’d like, or see certain art styles that remind me of you. The music and games that were shared I can’t touch. I have never made another cup of the coffee I would send you that I used to love.

It has honestly poisoned everything. I hate it. I loved you and you used me. You put nothing in. You never kept your word.

He awoke beside a river, his memory lost to the rapids — the threads of fate thin as clouds from another heaven.  
Wounded, nameless, and alone, he found himself in a land of beautiful forests and sky-touching mountains — a land torn by war, where the borders between the Empire and the northern jarldoms shift every season.

***Can he discover who he truly is without taking sides?***  
***And if he can... is it worth it?***
